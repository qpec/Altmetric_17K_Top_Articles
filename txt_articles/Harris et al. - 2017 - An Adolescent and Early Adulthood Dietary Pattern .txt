Abstract
Adolescence is a highly susceptible period for mammary
carcinogenesis, but few prospective studies have examined the
role of adolescent diet in breast cancer risk. Reduced rank
regression has previously been used to identify a dietary pattern
associated with markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein,
IL6, and TNFa receptor 2). We investigated whether an adoles-
cent and early adulthood inflammatory dietary pattern was
associated with breast cancer among 45,204 women in the
Nurses' Health Study II using reduced rank regression. Partici-
pants completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1998 about
their high school diet (HS-FFQ) and a FFQ in 1991 when they
were ages 27–44 years. Among women who completed the HS-
FFQ, 1,477 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed during 22 years
of follow-up. An adolescent and early adulthood dietary pattern
characterized by inflammation was associated with an increased
incidence of premenopausal but not postmenopausal breast
cancer. Women in the fifth quintile of the inflammatory pattern
score had multivariable adjusted HRs for premenopausal breast
cancer of 1.35 for adolescent diet [95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 1.06–1.73; Ptrend ¼ 0.002] and 1.41 for early adulthood diet
(95% CI, 1.11–1.78; Ptrend ¼ 0.006) compared with women in
the first quintile. The corresponding RRs for postmenopausal
breast cancer were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.60–1.17) for adolescent and
0.76 (95% CI, 0.54–1.06) for adult intake. Overall, our findings
support the notion that an adolescent and early adulthood diet
characterized by high intake of sugar-sweetened and diet soft
drinks, refined grains, red and processed meat, and margarine,
and low intake of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables,
and coffee may increase the incidence of premenopausal breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 77(5); 1179–87. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Adolescence and early adulthood are highly susceptible periods
for breast cancer carcinogenesis during a woman's life course.
Mathematical models of breast cancer etiology have demonstrated
that the years before first birth are critical in establishing breast
cancer risk (1) and animal models support this period of increased
vulnerability (2–5). Thus, the focus on dietary exposures during
later adulthood may not target periods of heightened vulnerability.
Adult dietary patterns and breast cancer risk have been
examined in several studies and recent review articles of this
literature have suggested a possible inverse association between
"prudent" or healthy dietary patterns and breast cancer risk but
the results are not conclusive (6–9) and only one study has
examined adolescent dietary patterns and breast cancer risk
(10). Most previous studies on dietary patterns and breast
cancer risk have used principal components analysis (PCA),
which results in patterns that reflect the correlation structure
between foods and consequently the derivation of the dietary
patterns is independent of the endpoint of interest. Reduced
rank regression, another technique for deriving dietary patterns,
allows the selection of intermediate biomarkers that are spe-
cifically associated with the endpoint of interest and may be
more predictive of disease risk (11).
We sought to investigate the relation between an adolescent
and early adulthood dietary pattern associated with markers of
inflammation and breast cancer among women in the Nurses'
Health Study II. We also examined whether the associations
between the adolescent and early adulthood dietary patterns and
breast cancer differed by the menopausal status of the cases and
the hormone receptor status of the tumor.
Patients and Methods
Study population
The Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) was established in 1989
when 116,430 registered nurses from 14 states completed a
baseline questionnaire on lifestyle factors and medical history.
Follow-up questionnaires are sent to participants every 2 years to

 collect updated information on lifestyle factors, diseases, and
other health-related topics. Implied consent was assumed upon
completion and return of the questionnaire. This study was
approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and
Women's Hospital.
In 1997, participants were asked if they would be willing to
complete a supplemental food frequency questionnaire about
diet during high school (HS-FFQ; ref. 12). The HS-FFQ
was completed by 47,355 women (83% of those sent the
questionnaire) in 1998 when they were 33–52 years old.
Women were excluded from the current analyses if they had
an implausible daily caloric intake (<500 or �5,000 cal; n ¼
1,407), left more than 20 items on the HS-FFQ blank (n ¼ 219),
were missing height (n ¼ 126), or were diagnosed with any
cancer, except nonmelanoma skin cancer (n ¼ 399) before
1989.
Dietary assessment and dietary pattern identification
Adolescent diet was measured using the 124-item HS-FFQ.
This questionnaire was specifically designed to include foods
that were commonly consumed during the period from 1960 to
1980 when the women would have been in high school. Adult
diet was assessed first in 1991 (dietary baseline), when parti-
cipants were ages 27–44 years, and every 4 years after using a
FFQ listing over 130 food items. Participants were asked how
often, on average, they had consumed each type of food or
beverage between the ages of 13–18 years (HS-FFQ) or during
the previous year (adult FFQ). Nine responses were possible,
ranging from never to 6 or more times a day. The validity of the
HS-FFQ has been assessed in a population of young adults who
had provided information 10 years earlier about their current
diet while in high school. The HS-FFQ was compared to three
24-hour diet recalls and two 131-item self-administered Youth/
Adolescent Questionnaires (YAQ), which were administered
when the participants were ages 13–18 years (13). For the daily
intake of 25 nutrients, the mean corrected correlation between
the HS-FFQ and the YAQs was 0.58 (range ¼ 0.40–0.88). In
addition, within a subset of NHS II participants, recall of
adolescent diet was reasonably reproducible and valid (14).
To assess reproducibility, the HS-FFQ was readministered to
333 NHS II participants 4 years after the initial HS-FFQ and to
assess validity, the mothers of NHS II participants reported
information on their daughters' adolescent diets using the
HS-FFQ. The average Pearson correlations for nutrients were
0.65 (range ¼ 0.50–0.77) for NHS II participants and 0.40
(range ¼ 0.13–0.59) for mothers report. The average Spearman
rank correlation for foods were 0.60 (range ¼ 0.37–0.77) and
0.30 (range ¼ 0.10–0.61), respectively (14).
The inflammatory dietary pattern has been previously identi-
fied in a subset of women in the NHS using reduced rank
regression (RRR), the derivation of this pattern has been described
in detail elsewhere (11, 15, 16). In brief, biomarkers of C-reactive
protein (CRP), IL6, and TNFa receptor 2 (15, 16) were assayed in a
subsample of adult women who were controls from previous
nested case–control and validation studies. The mean adult
dietary intake from two FFQs completed within 0–3 years of
blood draw was calculated and foods were grouped into up to 39
food groups. RRR was used to produce a linear function of food
groups that explained the variation in the response variables
(the biomarkers of interest). Food groups were retained in the
pattern if the P value of the coefficient of the stepwise regression
model was <0.05. A simplified pattern was then generated using
stepwise linear regression with the RRR factor score as outcome
and the food groups as predictors. Using the inflammatory pattern
previously derived as described above, we then calculated sim-
plified pattern scores for adolescent diet and early adult diet (1991
FFQ) by summing the intakes of the identified food groups taking
into account their positive or negative associations with the
original pattern scores (17). The inflammatory dietary pattern
was characterized by higher intake of sugar-sweetened and diet
soft drinks, refined grains (white bread, English muffins, bagels or
rolls, muffins or biscuits, white rice, pasta, tortillas, pancakes, or
waffles), red (hamburger, beef, lamb, pork, and meatloaf) and
processed meat (hot dog, bacon, sausage, salami, and bologna),
margarine, corn, other vegetables (celery, mushrooms, green
pepper, eggplant, summer squash, and mixed vegetables), and
fish (tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, bluefish, swordfish, and
other fish), and lower intake of green leafy vegetables (spinach,
iceberg or head lettuce, romaine or leaf lettuce), yellow vegetables
(carrots, yellow/winter squash, yams), cruciferous vegetables
(broccoli,
brussel
sprouts,
cauliflower,
kale/mustard/chard
greens, cabbage/coleslaw), and coffee.
Ascertainment of breast cancer
On each biennial questionnaire, participants were asked
whether they had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the
previous 2 years. All participants who reported breast cancer were
asked for permission to review the relevant medical records and
pathology reports, to confirm the diagnosis. Estrogen receptor
(ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status information was
available for 86% of the cases in our analytic cohort. Cases of
carcinoma in situ were censored at the time of diagnosis.
Covariate assessment
Information on known and potential risk factors for breast
cancer was collected on the baseline and biennial questionnaires.
Women were considered premenopausal if they still had periods
or had at least one ovary remaining and were <46 (for smokers) or
<48 (for nonsmokers) years old. Women were considered post-
menopausal in the analysis if they reported being postmenopaus-
al during follow-up due to natural menopause or surgery with
bilateral oophorectomy. Women who reported hysterectomy
without bilateral oophorectomy or whose type of menopause
was unknown were not classified as postmenopausal until they
reached the age at which 90% of the cohort had reached natural
menopause (54 years for current smokers, 56 years for nonsmo-
kers; refs. 18, 19).
Statistical analysis
We examined three exposure windows for early life dietary
patterns; adolescent intake (ages 13–18), early adulthood
intake (assessed in 1991 when participants were ages 27–44
years), and the average of adolescent and early adulthood
intake (representing cumulative exposure from adolescence to
early/middle reproductive years). In the primary analyses of
these three exposures participants contributed person-time
from study entry until diagnosis of breast cancer, diagnosis of
any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), death,
loss to follow-up, menopause (only for the premenopausal
analysis), or end of follow-up on June 1, 2011, whichever
occurred first (described hereafter as the combined analysis).

 This analysis includes all cases of breast cancer diagnosed
before and after return of the HS-FFQ. In sensitivity analyses,
participants contributed person-time from return of the HS-
FFQ (1998; described hereafter as the prospective analysis).
This analysis was restricted to only incident cases of breast
cancer diagnosed after return of the HS-FFQ. Cox proportional
hazards regression models with age and questionnaire period
as the time scale were used to calculate HRs and 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CI) with the lowest quintile as the
reference. Tests for linear trend were performed by assigning
the median value of each category to all participants in that
group.
We considered two main covariate-adjusted models; the first
adjusted for adolescent characteristics and the second addi-
tionally adjusted for adult characteristics. We included the
following a priori potential confounders in the adolescent
characteristics model: age (continuous), total adolescence cal-
ories (continuous), height at age 18 (continuous), age at
menarche (<11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15þ years), body mass index
(BMI) at age 18 (continuous), adolescent physical activity (<21,
21–35.9, 36–53.9, 54–80.9, 81þ metabolic equivalent tasks
[METS]/week), and family history of breast cancer (yes, no). In
addition, the following covariates were included in the ado-
lescent and adult characteristics model which represents the
final model: age at first birth (<25, 25–30, 31þ years), parity
(nulliparous, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4þ), oral contraceptive use (never use,
past use <5 years, past use 5þ years, current use <5 years,
current use 5–9 years, current use 10þ years), adult physical
activity (<3, 3–8, 9–17, 18–26, 27–41, 42þ metabolic equiv-
alent tasks/week), alcohol consumption (nondrinker, <7.5,
7.5–15, 15–29, 30þ g/day), weight change since age 18 years
(continuous), and history of benign breast disease (yes, no). In
the analyses including postmenopausal women, we addition-
ally adjusted for menopausal status/age at menopause (pre-
menopausal, unknown menopause, <45 years, 45–46 years,
47–48 years, 49–50 years, 51–52 years, 53þ years), and hor-
mone use (premenopausal, postmenopausal never users, post-
menopausal past users, postmenopausal current users). Cate-
gories were created for missing data. The derivation of meno-
pausal status in this cohort has been described previously
(18, 19).
Competing risks analyses were used to examine whether the
associations between each dietary pattern and breast cancer
differed by hormone receptor status (20). This method allows
for the estimation of separate associations of each dietary
pattern in tumors with both ER- and PR-positive receptors and
ER- and PR-negative receptors, and tests whether each dietary
pattern has statistically different regression coefficients for
different subtypes. All tests of statistical significance were two
sided. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3
(SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
Among the 45,204 women who completed the HS-FFQ,
1,477 total cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed
during 22 years of follow-up including 870 cases of premen-
opausal breast cancer and 490 cases of postmenopausal breast
cancer. Women in the highest quintile of adolescent inflam-
matory pattern score had a higher BMI at age 18, were less
physically active in adulthood, had gained more weight since
age 18, and were more likely to have ever used oral contra-
ceptives than those with in the lowest quintile (Table 1).
Women in the highest quintile of adolescent inflammatory
pattern score had an average intake of refined grains and red
meat of 3.3 and 1.2 servings/day, respectively, whereas those in
the lowest quintile had an average intake of 1.5 and 0.6
servings/day, respectively. In contrast, those in the lowest
quintile of adolescent inflammatory pattern score had an
average intake of leafy vegetables of 0.7 servings/day compared
with 0.3 servings/day in the highest quintile (Table 1). Similar
differences in intake levels were observed for foods in early
adulthood (Table 1). The Spearman correlation between the
adolescent inflammatory pattern score and early adulthood
inflammatory pattern score was 0.31, the correlation between
adolescent and later adulthood was 0.24, and between early
adulthood and later adulthood was 0.34.
Among all women there was no significant association
between a higher inflammatory dietary pattern score in ado-
lescence and overall breast cancer incidence; however, a signif-
icant association was observed between a higher adolescent
inflammatory dietary pattern score and incidence of premen-
opausal breast cancer. Women in the fifth quintile of adolescent
inflammatory pattern score had a multivariable adjusted HR of
1.35 (95% CI, 1.06–1.73) for premenopausal breast cancer
compared with those in the first quintile (Ptrend ¼ 0.002). The
association observed in the prospective analysis (n ¼ 536 cases)
was slightly attenuated but the trend was still statistically
significant (HR for fifth quintile, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.97–1.80;
Ptrend ¼ 0.01). No association was observed with postmeno-
pausal breast cancer (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.60–1.17; Ptrend ¼
0.33). A similar pattern was observed for the inflammatory
dietary pattern in early adulthood, with no significant associ-
ation overall or among postmenopausal women and a signif-
icant increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer among
those consuming an early adulthood dietary pattern associated
with inflammatory markers (HR comparing the fifth to first
quintile, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.11–1.78; Ptrend ¼ 0.006; Table 2).
Among women who had completed both the adolescent and
early adulthood FFQ (n ¼ 42,770), we examined the average of
the two intakes. Among all women a significant association was
observed between a higher average inflammatory dietary pat-
tern score and overall breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.25; 95%
CI, 1.03–1.52; Ptrend ¼ 0.04). This appeared to be driven by the
association with premenopausal breast cancer (HR, 1.49; 95%
CI, 1.16–1.90; Ptrend ¼ 0.002) while there was no significant
association with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence (HR,
1.01; 95% CI, 0.71–1.43; Ptrend ¼ 0.62; Table 2). The associa-
tions between the adolescent and early adulthood inflamma-
tory dietary patterns and breast cancer remained the same when
we adjusted for a more recent adult inflammatory pattern (data
not shown).
We also evaluated the relation between the inflammatory
dietary pattern and risk of breast cancer for ER-positive/PR-pos-
itive and ER-negative/PR-negative tumors (Table 3). No signifi-
cant differences were observed in the effect estimates when ER-
positive/PR-positive and ER-negative/PR-negative cases were
compared (all Pheterogeneity � 0.06); however, the strongest asso-
ciation was observed for the average of adolescent and early
adulthood intake and premenopausal ER-negative/PR-negative
cases (HR for fifth quintile, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.17–4.16; Ptrend ¼
0.009).

 We also examined the individual components of the inflam-
matory pattern score to explore if any specific food or food groups
were driving the observed association with premenopausal breast
cancer. Higher adolescent intake of processed meat was the most
strongly associated with premenopausal breast cancer risk (HR for
fifth quintile, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07–1.68). None of the other
adolescent food groups were statistically significantly associated
with increased premenopausal breast cancer risk, although a
suggestion of an increased risk was also seen with adolescent
refined grain intake (HR for fifth quintile, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96–
1.56). When the average of adolescent and early adulthood intake
was examined, none of the individual food groups were statisti-
cally significantly associated with risk but the highest suggested
risks were observed for processed meat (HR for fifth quintile, 1.20;
95% CI, 0.94–1.54), red meat (HR for fifth quintile, 1.19; 95% CI,
0.92–1.53), and refined grains (HR for fifth quintile, 1.16; 95%
CI, 0.91–1.48).
Discussion
Our findings suggest an increased risk of premenopausal
breast cancer among women consuming an adolescent and
early adulthood diet that is associated with markers of inflam-
mation. This increased risk did not extend to postmenopausal
breast cancer and was not significantly different by hormone
receptor subtype.
Few studies on adolescent diet and breast cancer have been
undertaken because of the difficulty in assessing diet during

 this time period. Among the limited number of previous
studies, higher adolescent soy (21–24) and fiber (25–28)
intake have been suggested to have an inverse association
with breast cancer risk, whereas red meat has been suggested
to increase risk only among premenopausal women (29).
Dietary pattern analysis, in which different combinations of
food intake are examined, is a complementary approach to
the study of individual foods and nutrients that takes into
account diet as whole by examining the cumulative effects of
foods (30). However, adolescent and early adulthood dietary
patterns have rarely been examined in the context of breast
cancer risk.
Most previous studies examining dietary patterns and breast
cancer risk have focused on adult dietary patterns derived using
principal components analysis (PCA)/factor analysis (6–9). More
recently, a dietary inflammatory index (DII) has been developed
on the basis of an extensive literature review of diet and inflam-
matory markers (31). A meta-analysis of adult dietary patterns
derived using PCA/factor analysis has suggested an 7% reduced
risk of breast cancer for women in the highest category of adult
prudent/healthy dietary pattern score (95% CI, 0.88–0.98; ref. 7).
Among the three study populations that have examined adult
dietary inflammation potential and breast cancer outcomes, two
reported no significant association with overall breast cancer risk
(32–34) and one reported a borderline positive association
between DII and breast cancer (35). To our knowledge, the NHS
II cohort is the only study to examine adolescent dietary patterns
derived by PCA, whereas no studies have examined an adolescent
diet DII and breast cancer risk. In an analysis including both pre-
and postmenopausal breast cancer cases, we previously observed
a significant inverse trend with greater intake of a "prudent"
adolescent dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of vege-
tables, fruits, legumes, fish, and poultry but no association with a
"Western" dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of refined

 grains, red and processed meats, sweets, and potatoes (10). In
PCA, the derived patterns reflect the correlation structure between
foods thus are independent of the outcome of interest. The
method for deriving dietary patterns that we utilized in the current
analyses reduced rank regression, may result in dietary patterns
more predictive of disease risk as this method utilizes interme-
diate biomarkers that are associated or potentially associated with
the endpoint of interest (11).
The inflammatory pattern we examined has previously been
associated with type II diabetes (16) and depression (15) in the
Nurses' Health Study. However, to our knowledge, no previous
studies have examined the association between this dietary
pattern and incidence of breast cancer. The increased risk we
observed for this dietary pattern was limited to premenopausal
breast cancer. The risk factor profiles for pre- and postmeno-
pausal breast cancer differ. Postmenopausal breast cancer has
been found to be more strongly driven by hormonally related
risk factors, whereas fewer modifiable risk factors have been
identified for premenopausal breast cancer (36–39). Some
studies have suggested that hyperinsulinemia and glucose are
associated with increased premenopausal breast cancer risk
(40–42). The association between the biomarkers used to
define our inflammatory pattern (CRP, IL6, and TNFa receptor
2) and breast cancer risk is not entirely clear; however, this may
be due to previous studies of these biomarkers examining
primarily postmenopausal breast cancer. CRP has generated
nonsignificant positive associations (43–45), significant asso-
ciations among subgroups (46), or no association (47) with
predominantly postmenopausal breast cancer risk in previous
studies. IL6 has been nonsignificantly associated with post-
menopausal breast cancer in a pooled analysis of two studies
(43) and may have prognostic value in women with breast
cancer (48), whereas TNFa has been shown to contribute to
tumor progression in mammary cell lines (49). Our inflam-
matory dietary pattern was characterized by higher intake of
sweetened soft drinks, diet soft drinks, refined grains, red meat,
processed meat, margarine, corn, other vegetables, fish, and
lower intake of green leafy vegetables, yellow vegetables, cru-
ciferous vegetables, and coffee. The mechanism(s) through
which this type of diet during adolescence and early adulthood
may influence risk is not clear; however, these results are
consistent with the established association between chronic
inflammation and multiple types of cancer (50). This pattern
may influence the risk of premenopausal breast cancer through
pathways unrelated to the specific inflammatory biomarkers
used in the pattern derivation.
There are several limitations to our study. First, we did not
have biomarkers available from our participants during ado-
lescence to identify the inflammatory pattern. Instead, we
utilized a dietary pattern previously derived in primarily post-
menopausal women in the NHS (15, 16) and then used a
simplified score approach (17) to create these patterns in the
women who had completed the HS-FFQ and early adulthood
FFQ. If food intake during adolescence or early adulthood has
different influences on inflammatory biomarker levels, this
would not be reflected in our adolescent dietary pattern. In
addition, the inflammatory biomarkers were not specifically
chosen for their association with breast cancer. However,
regardless of how the pattern was derived, we observed a clear
association between the inflammatory pattern in adolescence
and early adulthood and premenopausal breast cancer that is
unlikely to be entirely explained by bias or chance.
Another limitation is that diet during high school was self-
reported by participants when they were 33–52 years old and
some error in its measurement is expected. However, the recall of
adolescent diet in the NHS II has been demonstrated to be
reasonably valid and reproducible (13, 14). In addition, our
combined and prospective analyses yielded consistent results,
thus any misclassification was likely nondifferential resulting in
an attenuation of the true effect. Because a purely prospective
cohort study linking adolescent diet to breast cancer would span
many decades of data collection, the use of recalled diet in a
prospective analysis provides an important means for studying
dietary exposures and later life outcomes.
In conclusion, we observed an association between an adoles-
cent and early adulthood inflammatory dietary pattern, charac-
terized by high intake of sugar-sweetened and diet soft drinks,
refined grains, red and processed meat, margarine, corn, other
vegetables, and fish, and lower intake of green leafy vegetables,
cruciferous vegetables, and coffee and the risk of premenopausal
breast cancer. This association was strongest when the cumulative
effect of adolescent and early adulthood diet were considered
together but did not influence risk of postmenopausal breast
cancer. This is an important finding as much less is known about
modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer. Whether
this association is mediated through inflammatory processes or
other mechanisms deserves further study.
