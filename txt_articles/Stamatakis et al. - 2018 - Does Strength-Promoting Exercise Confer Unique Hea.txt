ABSTRACT  
Public health guidance includes strength-promoting exercise (SPE) but there is little evidence on 
its links with mortality. Using data from 11 cohorts we examined the associations between SPE 
(gym-based and own bodyweight strength activities) and all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) mortality. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression examine the associations 
between SPE (any, low/high volume, adherence to SPE guideline) and mortality. The core 
sample comprised 80,306 adults aged ≥30 years corresponding to 5,763 any cause deaths 
(681,790 person years). Following exclusions for prevalent disease/events in the first 24 months, 
participation in any SPE was favorably associated with all cause (0.77, 95% confidence interval: 
0.69 to 0.87) and cancer mortality (0.69, 0.56 to 0.86). Adhering only to the SPE guideline of (≥2 
sessions/week) was associated with cancer (0.66, 0.48 to 0.92) and all-cause (0.79,  0.66 to 0.94) 
mortality; adhering only to the aerobic guideline (150 minutes/week of moderate or 75 
minutes/week of vigorous intensity or equivalent combinations) was associated with all-cause 
(0.84,  0.78 to 0.90) and CVD (0.78, 0.68 to 0.90) mortality. Adherence to both guidelines was 
associated with all-cause (0.71,   0.57 to 0.87), and cancer (0.70, 0.50 to 0.98) mortality. Our 
results support promoting adherence to the strength exercise guidelines over and above the 
generic physical activity targets.

INTRODUCTION 
Regular physical activity participation has a well-established association with reductions in all-
cause, cardiovascular, diabetes and cancer-related mortality (1, 2). In the last decade, strength 
promoting exercise (SPE) has become an integral component of physical activity guidelines 
around the world (3, 4) with the World Health Organization recommending at least two sessions 
per week.   
Current SPE guidelines are primarily intended to increase strength and function and there are few 
data on associations with chronic disease and mortality. Participation in strength exercise has 
been associated with reduced risk of type II diabetes in men (40-75 years) (5), women (36-81 
years) (6) and working age populations (30-64 years) (7). These associations were independent 
of aerobic exercise, conferred greater benefit when combined with aerobic exercise (5, 6), and 
were more pronounced in older adults (7). Compared to aerobic forms of physical activity, SPE 
is unique in its ability to promote increases in muscle size and strength, with higher muscle mass 
(8, 9) and strength (10) previously associated with a lower mortality risk. Thus, SPE may be 
promising for reducing premature mortality and chronic disease risk.   
However, few studies have explored associations between strength promoting exercise and 
cause-specific mortality. SPE has been shown to be associated with reduced risk fatal and non-
fatal myocardial infarction among adult men (11) and all-cause mortality in cancer survivors 
(12), and recent studies have shown also shown reductions in all-cause mortality amongst adults 
who meet the guidelines of two sessions per week (13-15). However, limited conclusions can be 
drawn, with the few published studies limited to usually older adults residing in the US (13) and  
small cohorts (12, 14, 15) with no measures taken to account reverse causality by removing 
 6 
 
prevalent cases (13-15) or excluding events at the first few months of years of follow-up (11, 13-
15).    
The aim of this study was to examine the associations between SPE and all-cause, cardiovascular 
and cancer mortality; and to compare the SPE and aerobic activity guidelines in terms of their 
associations with mortality outcomes.     
 
METHODS 
Sample 
The Health Survey for England (HSE) (16) and the Scottish Health Survey (SHS) (17) are 
established household-based population surveillance studies running since 1991 and 1995, 
respectively. Each year samples are selected using a multistage, stratified probability design 
aimed at recruiting a nationally representative sample. Trained interviewers visited the selected 
households, and the recruited participants were administered the study questionnaires. All survey 
participants gave written consent to have their death flagged on the NHS Central Mortality 
Register. This study includes individuals aged ≥30 years old from HSE 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 
2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008 and SHS 1995, 1998 and 2003, with the corresponding linkage to 
mortality data. Each baseline survey was approved by the relevant Research Ethics Committees 
in England and Scotland.   
 
Mortality outcomes 
Participants were followed up for mortality until 31/12/2009 (SHS) or 31/03/2011 (HSE).  
Diagnoses for primary causes of death were recorded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) and Tenth Revision (ICD10). Cancer deaths 
 7 
 
were identified using ICD9 140.0-239.9 and ICD10 C00.0-D48.9 codes; CVD deaths were 
identified using ICD9 390.0-459.9 and ICD10 I01.0-I99 codes. 
 
Assessment of strength-promoting exercise and other physical activity 
Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire (18) that inquired about participation in 
sports and exercises in the four weeks prior to the interview. Participants were shown a card (see 
supplement, Illustration e1) with 10 exercise groupings including workout at a gym/weight 
training/exercise bike that we labelled “gym-based” SPE and exercises such as press-ups and sit 
ups that we labelled “own bodyweight” SPE. For each positive response participants were asked 
if they had participated for at least 15 minutes, the frequency (number of occasions), and 
duration per occasion. “All strength exercise” (total SPE) was defined as the sum of gym –based 
and own bodyweight SPE. The questionnaire also included items on domestic physical activity 
(19)  and walking (20) that have been described in detail elsewhere (19, 20). All physical activity 
variables were summarized to reflect weekly averages. In a large validation study, the Spearman 
correlation coefficients between accelerometry counts and self-reported activity converted to  
weekly MET-minutes was 0.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36, 0.46) for women and 0.32 
(CI: 0.26, 0.38) for men (18).    
 
To minimize misclassification arising from likely inclusion of aerobic exercise, the volume of 
the gym-based workout was weighted using age and sex-specific proportions of total gym-based 
activity that was reported to be “strength work out at a gym using machines or free weights 
derived using the pooled samples of the 2008 (21) (n=12,360) and 2012 (22) (n=6,883) that 
included additional questions specifying the nature of the gym-based activity (Table e1). On 
 8 
 
average, 63% of the gym-based activity in those two years was SPE, with a tendency for a 
decrease by age group from 86% in those aged 30-35 to 61% among those 75 years or older.  
The physical activity compendium (23) was used to assign the Metabolic Equivalents (MET) for 
all physical activity to calculate total MET-hours/week. Like previously (24) we estimated 
adherence to the aerobic guideline as 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity or 75 
minutes/week of vigorous intensity or equivalent combinations of moderate and vigorous non-
SPE / non-domestic physical activity (4). We also computed an alternative interpretation of the 
aerobic guideline defined as accumulating at least 7.5 MET-hours/week (25) of any type and 
intensity (26) non-SPE physical activity   . Adherence to the SPE gudeline was defined as 
reporting partticipation in at least two sessions per week on average.  
 
Covariates 
Height and weight were measured by the interviewers using standard protocols (16, 17); body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared.  
Additional questions assessed age, educational attainment (age completed full time education), 
presence of longstanding illness, weekly frequency of alcohol consumption, smoking habits 
(never smoker, ex-smoker, currently smoking 1-10 cigarettes/day, currently smoking 10-19/day, 
currently smoking ≥20/day), psychological distress/depression (12-point General Health 
Questionnaire score), and number of fruit and vegetable servings consumed the day prior to the 
interview.   
 
Statistical analysis  
 9 
 
Analyses were carried out using SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Inc). Cox proportional-hazard models 
were used to examine the associations between total and type-specific SPE and all-cause, cancer, 
and CVD mortality with “no participation” set as the reference category. Log-minus-log plots 
were used to examine the proportional-hazards assumption and no violations were observed.  
Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, all covariates listed above, and weekly MET-hours of non-
SPE activity. We examined associations between overall participation (none/any)    and volume 
(none/low/high) with mortality outcomes. High and low weekly volumes were classified using 
the sex-specific medians of the corresponding variable (Table e1). We examined the association 
between meeting the strength promoting guideline (≥ 2 sessions/week)(4) and mortality; and 
compared associations with meeting the general (aerobic) one using a 4-level variable: meeting 
neither of the two recommendations (referent), meeting the SPE recommendation only, meeting 
aerobic recommendation only, and meeting both recommendations. To minimize the possibility 
of spurious associations due to occult disease we excluded participants who died in the first 24 
months of follow-up. We excluded those with prevalent cancer at baseline from the cancer 
mortality analyses; those with prevalent CVD (angina/stroke/ischemic heart disease) from the 
CVD mortality analyses; and both prevalent CVD and cancer from the all-cause mortality 
analyses. Unless otherwise stated in the results, the own bodyweight and gym-based SPE were 
not mutually exclusive.   
We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to minimize bias and enable a more robust 
interpretation of the results: 
• We examined the role of dietary confounding by repeating all main Cox analyses with 
additional adjustment for fruit and vegetable consumption (27) in a sub-sample.   
 10 
 
• To minimize the possibility that the associations between SPE and mortality are not due 
to the aerobic exercise element included in the gym-based SPE question, we repeated 
various Cox models with adherence to the SPE guidelines calculated using own 
bodyweight exercise only.   
• We examined whether total activity is an effect modifier by including an aerobic physical 
activity*SPE term in fully adjusted Cox models and we performed stratified Cox analyses 
by physical activity level.  
• As smoking is a causal risk factor for all three study outcomes and is significantly linked 
to participation of SPE, we also carried out a sensitivity analysis restricted to non-
smokers.     
 
RESULTS  
Sample characteristics 
The core sample comprised 80,306 participants corresponding to 736,463 person years and a 
mean follow-up of 9.2 (SD 4.5) years. Among them 36.2% met only the aerobic guidelines, 3.4% 
met only the SPE guidelines, and 5.5% met both. Characteristics of the core sample by overall 
SPE participation are presented in Table 1 (that includes all eligible participants prior to 
exclusions described below). Compared to non-participators, SPE participators were younger,  
had a slightly lower BMI, were less likely to have longstanding illness, be current smokers, be 
depressed, or to only meet the aerobic physical activity guideline; and more likely to have 
finished full-time education at age ≥19. In total, 1,891 participants had cancer and 5,292 had 
major CVD at baseline and were excluded from the corresponding analyses. Another 938 
participants died in the first 24 months of the follow-up and were excluded from all further 
 11 
 
prospective analyses. The main analyses included 72,459 (all-cause mortality), 73,937 (CVD) 
and 77,195 (cancer mortality) participants.   
 
Association between strength-promoting exercise and mortality 
Figure 1 shows the fully adjusted associations between mutually exclusive categories of SPE and 
mortality. Own bodyweight SPE showed clearer associations than gym-based SPE in terms of  
all-cause and cancer mortality; compared to no SPE participation, participation in both types was 
linked with the largest all cause (0.51, CI: 0.33 to 0.79) and cancer (0.25, CI: 0.01 to 0.60) 
mortality risk reductions.    
 
Table 2 presents the associations of own bodyweight SPE, gym-based, and total SPE with all-
cause mortality. Participation in both SPE types was consistently associated with lower risk of 
all-cause mortality in both partially adjusted and fully adjusted models, with evidence for a 
modest dose-response association with higher volumes. Similarly, in fully adjusted models, the 
hazard ratio for low weekly volume of total SPE was 0.81 (CI: 0.69 to 0.95), and 0.75 (CI: 0.64 
to 0.88) for higher weekly volumes.   
All three SPE variables were associated with CVD mortality in the partially adjusted models but 
further adjustments materially attenuated these associations considerably (Table e3).    
Table 3 presents the associations between SPE and cancer mortality. Own bodyweight (0.69, CI: 
0.56 to 0.86) and gym-based (0.61, CI: 0.45 to 0.84) SPE were both associated with cancer 
 12 
 
mortality. Participation in any strength exercise was associated with cancer mortality in a dose-
response manner. 
There were no significant interactions between total physical activity and SPE participation in 
any outcomes (all P > 0.35). Among participants who did not meet the aerobic physical activity 
guideline (n=39,369), participation in any SPE was associated with a lower all-cause (fully 
adjusted HR: 0.76, CI: 0.65 to 0.89) and cancer (0.65, CI: 0.49 to 0.87) mortality. Among 
participants who met the aerobic guideline (n=33, 840), SPE was associated with all-cause (0.89, 
CI: 0.77 to 1.03) and cancer (0.75, CI: 0.59 to 0.95) mortality. In the sub-sample (n=33,063, 836 
deaths /326 cancer deaths) with additional adjustment for fruit and vegetable consumption all 
associations between SPE and mortality outcomes observed in the full sample persisted. For 
example, the all-cause mortality hazard ratios for any SPE participation was 0.44 (CI: 0.25 to 
0.77) and 0.60 (CI: 0.39 to 0.91) for own bodyweight SEP (data available on request).   
 
Adherence to strength exercise and aerobic guidelines 
Compared to not meeting the SPE guideline, adherence to the SPE guideline was associated with 
all-cause (0.80, CI: 0.70 to 0.91) (Table 2) and cancer (0.68, CI: 0.54, 0.86) (Table 3) mortality. 
These associations were materially unchanged when adherence to the guideline was calculated 
from own bodyweight SPE only (e.g. for all-cause and cancer mortality the hazard ratio was 0.81 
(CI: 0.70 to 0.94) and 0.69 (CI: 0.54 to 0.90) respectively.  
 
 13 
 
Figure 2 presents the fully adjusted comparisons between the aerobic physical activity and SPE 
guidelines with those adhering to neither guideline as the reference group. Adhering only to the 
SPE guideline was associated with lower risk of cancer (0.66, CI: 0.48 to 0.92) and to a lesser 
extent with lower risk of all-cause mortality (0.79, CI: 0.66 to 0.94). Adhering to the aerobic 
guideline only was associated with lower CVD (0.78, CI: 0.68 to 0.90) and all-cause (0.84, CI: 
0.78 to 0.90) mortality.  Adhering to both guidelines appeared to elicit additional risk reduction 
for all-cause (0.71, CI: 0.57 to 0.87),and cancer (0.70, CI: 0.50 to 0.98) mortality.  Results in the 
analyses that employed the alternative definition of the aerobic guideline (>7.5 MET-hrs/week of 
any type and intensity) were broadly similar but also provided clearer evidence for an association 
between meeting both guidelines and CVD mortality (Figure e1).  When we calculated 
adherence to the SPE guidelines using own bodyweight exercise only we observed similar 
differences between the associations that the SPE and aerobic guidelines exhibited with mortality 
(Figure e2).. Among non-smokers (n=54,285), the associations between gym-based SPE and all-
cause mortality were attenuated compared to the main results presented in Table 2. The 
associations of all other SPE indicators (including adherence to the SPE guideline and 
participation in any SPE) with mortality in this sub-group analysis changed very little and not in 
a specific direction (Table e4).  
 
DISCUSSION  
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the participation in SPE and all-
cause, cancer and CVD mortality. SPE participation was linked with a 23% reduction in all-
cause mortality and a 31% reduction in cancer mortality. In addition, there was some relatively 
 14 
 
modest evidence of dose-response relationship, with higher volume of SPE having a slightly 
greater reduction in all-cause mortality. Adherence to both the SPE and aerobic guidelines  was 
associated with a greater risk reduction in mortality than aerobic physical activity alone (Figures 
2 and e1). The lack of association between adherence to the aerobic guideline alone and cancer is 
surprising, given that previous studies suggest that the beneficial associations between total 
physical activity (SPE and aerobic combined) and overall cancer mortality often appear at 
amounts below the current recommendations (26, 27). One possibility is that, in the absence of 
SPE, amounts of aerobic activity in excess of 150 minutes of MVPA/7.5 MET-hours/week are 
needed to reduce cancer mortality risk. However, this interpretation is not supported directly by 
empirical evidence as we are not aware of any studies that have specifically assessed associations 
between adherence to the guidelines through aerobic physical activity only and cancer mortality. 
It is worth noting that muscle strength, the primary adaptation attributed to SPE, has been 
associated with reduced cancer mortality independent of aerobic fitness (28).  
 
While the effects of aerobic exercise on morbidity, mortality and clinical health outcomes are 
well documented, much less focus has been given to SPE within a public health context (28). 
Our analysis showed that own bodyweight exercises that can be performed in any setting without 
equipment, yielded comparable results to gym-based activities (e.g. Figure 1). This has practical 
implications because strength training may be perceived as an activity primarily conducted 
within a gym or clinical setting where important participation barriers may be present, e.g. social 
inhibitions, limited access, and financial constraints (29). Our study also highlights likely gaps in 
public health practice as, with very few exceptions (28), studies estimating the prevalence (30) or 
burden (31) of physical inactivity as a chronic disease risk factor do not consider strength 
 15 
 
exercise in its own right. For example, when adherence to the SPE guideline is taken into 
account the prevalence of physical inactivity in Australia (28, 32) and U.S. (33) increases to ~80-
85%, (vs. ~50% when only the aerobic guideline is taken into account).       
 
Participants who adhered to the World Health Organization guidelines of 2 sessions of SPE per 
week had a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality. These findings are generally consistent with the 
19% and 31% reduction in all-cause mortality reported by Kraschnewski et al (2016) (13) and 
Dankel et al (2016) (15), respectively. In contrast, we report a 49% reduction in cancer mortality, 
with Kraschnewski et al (2016) (13) showing no significant effect. Interestingly, we observed 
reductions in cancer mortality only in individuals who met the SPE but not the aerobic 
guidelines.  Strength training has been shown to lower circulating levels of sex-hormones (34), 
reducing the risk of breast and endometrial cancer in women, and prostate cancer in men (35). In 
addition, strength training has also been shown to be a powerful adjunct therapy in the treatment 
of cancer, particularly to combat muscle dysfunction  and cancer cachexia (36), as well as the 
side effects of anti-androgenic medication often prescribed in prostate cancer (37). SPE 
participation has been associated with a 33% reduction in all-cause mortality in cancer survivors 
(12). Taken together, SPE prior to diagnosis may reduce the risk of cancer mortality, but may 
also reduce all-cause mortality risk in cancer survivors. However, observational studies of SPE 
and cancer mortality in individuals free from a cancer diagnoses are lacking, and thus future 
studies are warranted on the effects of this modality of exercise on cancer mortality.   
 
 16 
 
The present study showed a lack of evidence for an association of SPE with CVD mortality 
which is in agreement with previous literature (13, 15). However, participation in at least 30 
minutes of SPE per week has been found to confer similar benefits in risk reduction as 2.5 hours 
of brisk walking for fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction in men (11). Randomized 
controlled trials of resistance training have been shown to increase arterial stiffness in younger 
adults (38), with higher arterial stiffness associated with all-cause and CVD mortality (39). 
However, recent evidence show reductions in pulse wave velocity following 12-weeks of high or 
low intensity resistance training in younger men (40). Similarly, aortic reservoir pressure in pre-
hypertensive and hypertensive older men was also shown to reduce following resistance 
training(41). Thus, the association between SPE and CVD mortality remain unclear and warrant 
further investigation. Thus, the effects of SPE on arterial stiffness remain heterogeneous, but it is 
possible that increases in arterial stiffness due to SPE may offset any potential benefit on other 
CVD risk factors such as reductions in blood pressure (42). 
 
Previously in 8,772 adults, participation in 8-14 SPE sessions per month was associated with a 
reduction in all-cause mortality, with no benefit observed at higher frequencies (15). In our data 
there was some indication that higher volume and higher perceived intensity of SPE were 
associated with a greater reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality, respectively. Interestingly, 
higher muscle strength, as opposed to participation in SPE was found to be more strongly 
associated with reductions in mortality (14), suggesting the outcome of strength is more 
important than the behavior of SPE itself. This provides further evidence for a potential dose-
response relationship, with experimental data (43) showing that SPE at higher volume and 
intensity have greater benefit on muscle strength. Experimental data on the isolated effects of 
 17 
 
progressive resistance training (PRT) on mortality are sparse. In an RCT of 124 older adults who 
had surgical repair of osteoporotic hip fracture, those who received PRT had a 81% and 84% 
reduction in mortality and nursing home admission respectively than those who received 
standard care (44). The anabolic response to high intensity PRT have been associated with 
improved glucose metabolism (45), reductions in systemic inflammation (46), reductions in 
depressive symptoms (47), improvements in cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive 
impairment (48) as well as aerobic capacity and functional and mobility outcomes (49), all of 
which can collectively reduce mortality risk. 
 Our study has utilized a pooled population sample and is one of the largest in the field of SPE 
epidemiology.   We took robust approaches to minimize the chances for reverse causality (e.g. 
our analysis is the only one to exclude both prevalent disease cases and events occurring within 
the first two years) and performed several sensitivity analyses towards the same end, including 
adjustments for dietary factors in a sub-sample. A key limitation of this study was the use of self-
reported assessment of strength exercise and the use of a 4-week recall time frame. Both of these 
characteristics of the exposure measurement may have resulted in regression dilution bias and 
attenuation of the “true” association between strength training and outcomes. At present there is 
no feasible substitute to the self-report assessments of  SPE (50) which is the standard in public 
health surveillance (28, 51). The question on gym-based exercise enquired about some forms of 
aerobic exercise and while attempts were made to reduce measurement error by weighting 
estimation by the volume of SPE gym-based activity, we acknowledge the possibility that some 
aerobic activity was included. However, own bodyweight SPE showed similar of higher levels of 
mortality risk reduction (Figure 1) compared to the gym-based indicator;  and calculating 
adherence to the SPE guideline using the own bodyweight indicator only did not materially 
 18 
 
change results (Figure e2). Both of these analyses support the robustness of our overall SPE 
findings..  SPE questions in the literature have ranged broadly from “weightlifting” (5, 6, 11),  
unspecified/unreported questions on “strength training” (11), specific  questions  on 
“calisthenics, free weights, or weight training machines” (12),  specific questions on “physical 
activities specifically designed to strengthen your muscles, such as lifting weight or doing 
calisthenics” (13), or “physical activities specifically designed to strengthen your muscles, such 
as lifting weight, push-ups or sit-ups?” (14, 15). Our SPE measure included elements of weight 
training (5, 6, 11, 12) and calisthenics (12, 13, 14, 15) and as such it captures the elements 
previously used addressed in the literature.   
Low statistical power may have compromised some of our results. For example,  in the 
combined associations of SPE and aerobic guidelines with CVD mortality the group adhering to 
the SPE guideline only had 42 events (event rate 1.6%), although it is worth noting that in the 
case of cancer mortality we did detect an association in the same group despite the low number 
of events (38 events, event rate 1.4%). 
 
In conclusion, participation in any SPE was associated with a 23% reduction in all-cause 
mortality and a 32% reduction in cancer mortality. In terms of mortality risk reduction, 
adherence to SPE guidelines appears to be at least as important as adherence to the aerobic 
guidelines. Our results support the value of specifically promoting adherence to the strength 
exercise guidelines over and above the generic physical activity targets.

aDetermined through cancer registration records or self-reported (using the long standing illness module); bGroups were defined using the  sex-
specific medians of the corresponding variable (see Table e2) cModel adjusted for age and sex dModel also adjusted for  long-standing illness, 
alcohol drinking frequency,  psychological distress, body mass index, smoking status, education level, and weekly physical activity volume 
excluding the volume of  strength-promoting activity that is the main exposure in the corresponding model; eGym-based exercise weekly volumes 
were weighted using age (10 year bands) and sex-specific proportions of total gym-based activity that was “Strength work out at a gym using 
machines or free weights” derived from the Health Survey for England 2008 and 2012 datasets  (see Table e1);  f participation in at least two 
sessions of strenghth promoting exercise per week. This analysis is adjusted as (c) and (d) above including weekly aerobic physical activity 
volume.
