ABSTRACT
Background Little is known about the value of clinical
examination in relation to diagnostic imaging for acute
groin injuries in athletes. Primary aim: to investigate
whether clinical examination tests predict a positive or
negative MRI result (MRI±). Secondary aim: to assess
accuracy of clinical tests to localise injury in MRI+ cases.
Methods We consecutively included 81 male athletes
with acute groin injuries. Standardised clinical
examination (palpation, resistance and stretch tests) and
MRI were performed within 7 days of injury. Diagnostic
statistics including positive and negative predictive values
(PPV/NPV) were calculated.
Results 85 acute injuries were found on MRI in 64
(79%) athletes with 17 (21%) athletes having MRI−
injuries. Palpation had the highest NPV (91–96%, (95%
CI 69% to 99%)). 3 specific adductor examination tests
(resisted outer range adduction, squeeze test with hip
neutral and long lever, and passive adductor stretch)
showed 80–81% (95% CI 63% to 91%) probability of
an MRI+ adductor lesion when positive, all with high
accuracy of a correct MRI location (PPV 93–97% (95%
CI 76% to 100%)). Hip flexor tests showed poor ability
to predict MRI+ lesions (PPV 34–63% (95% CI 20% to
84%)) and low accuracy (PPV 17–71% (95% CI 7% to
85%)).
Conclusions 21% of athletes had negative imaging
and the absence of palpation pain was best at predicting
an MRI− result. Specific adductor examination tests
accurately predicted MRI+ adductor injuries. Hip flexor
clinical tests were poor at predicating and localising MRI+
injuries in the hip flexors. Clinical examination appears
sufficient to diagnose acute adductor injuries, whereas
MRI could assist in accurately locating acute hip flexor
injuries.
INTRODUCTION
Acute groin injuries are common in many sports,
but reporting of groin injuries in epidemiological
studies often lack description of pain onset (acute/
gradual),1–3 which limits information on diagnostic
variations, injury incidence and treatment related to
this injury type. Diagnosing groin pain in athletes
can be challenging due to the complex regional
anatomy,4 multiple differential diagnoses5 and het-
erogeneous terminology.6 Diagnostic terminology
in
acute
groin
injuries,
however,
appears
less
diverse than for long-standing groin pain, and is
usually related to specific muscles. Although this
could simplify diagnosis of acute groin injuries, dis-
crepancies between clinical diagnoses and radio-
logical findings have been found.7 The reasons for
this discrepancy are still unknown, but could be
related to the pain presentation of the athlete
during the clinical examination. More data on the
association
between
clinical
examination
and
imaging findings in acute groin injuries are needed
to understand the diagnostic value of commonly
performed clinical examination tests and imaging.
Specific clinical examination tests for athletes
with long-standing groin pain have good intra-
tester
and
inter-tester
reproducibility.8
Paired
combinations of clinical examination tests are used
to categorise groin pain into several defined clinical
entities,9 10 and there is international agreement on
diagnostic
taxonomy
for
athletes
with
long-
standing groin pain.5 This taxonomy was also
suggested to be usable for acute groin injuries, but
data to inform decision-making on the best clinical
examination tests are lacking.5
MRI is currently considered the best available
investigation to confirm the location of acute
muscle injuries, due to its supreme soft tissue con-
trast and high resolution,11 although considerable
prevalence of imaging negative results in acute
muscle pain has been reported.7 12 13
Since MRI is not readily available for many clini-
cians,
further
investigation
of
the
association
between clinical examination tests and the presence
of MRI lesions and their location is required.
The primary aim of this study was to investigate
the ability of specific clinical examination tests to
predict a positive or negative MRI injury in the
tested muscles group in athletes with acute groin
injuries. The secondary aim was to assess the accur-
acy of the clinical examination tests to predict the
location of the injury in MRI-positive cases.
METHODS
Participants
Athletes with an acute groin injury were consecu-
tively
included
prospectively
over
two
sports
seasons (August 2013 to May 2015) from an out-
patient department at a specialised sports medicine
hospital in Qatar. Inclusion criteria were: male ath-
letes, 18–40 years old, participating in competitive
individual or team sports, attending the hospital
clinic within 7 days of acute-onset groin pain sus-
tained during sport, and with MRI performed
within 7 days of injury. Exclusion criteria were:
gradual onset or exacerbation of ongoing groin
pain, clinical signs or symptoms of prostatitis or
urinary tract infection, or other known coexisting
chronic diseases, such as significant hip osteoarth-
ritis. Ethical approval was obtained by the Shafallah

 Medical Genetics Center and the Anti-Doping Lab Qatar
Institutional Review Boards (IRB project number 2012-013 and
EXT2014000004). Written informed consent was obtained
from all athletes at inclusion.
Clinical examination
All athletes were initially assessed by a sports medicine phys-
ician, with a research physiotherapist present, to determine eligi-
bility. On athlete consent, a more extensive standardised clinical
examination was performed by the physiotherapist, who was
blinded to the MRI results. Three types of clinical pain provoca-
tion tests were used: palpation, muscle resistance and stretch
tests.8 9 The clinical examination tests were grouped into three
categories: (1) hip adductor, (2) hip flexor and (3) abdominal
tests (table 1). Full test descriptions are included in online
supplementary
appendix
1.
All
clinical
examination
tests
included bilateral comparison, and were deemed positive if the
athlete recognised the specific acute injury pain for the tested
area. If the player reported pain or discomfort during a test
unrelated to the acute injury pain, the test was considered nega-
tive. The modified Thomas test is normally used as a hip flexor
test, but in this study it was also considered as an abdominal test
and hence considered positive if an athlete reported abdominal
pain during the test either in addition to or isolated from any
other groin pain.
MRI assessment
MRI was performed on a 1.5 T system (Magnetom Espree,
Siemens) using a body matrix coil and eight standardised
sequences as described in detail in a previous publication.7 In
brief, the protocol included two coronal T1-weighted and
short T1 inversion recovery (STIR), one sagittal fat-suppressed
proton density-weighted, three axial T1-, fat-suppressed proton
density-, and fat-suppressed T2-weighted, and two axial oblique
fat-suppressed proton density- and T2-weighted sequences. The
MRI scoring was performed by an experienced musculoskeletal
radiologist not involved in the clinical practice and blinded to
any clinical information. Each potential muscle location was
scored individually as MRI-positive (findings of oedema with or
without structural disruption, as well as complete tears or avul-
sions) or MRI-negative (no acute lesion). This dichotomisation
has shown almost perfect intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibil-
ity both on an athlete level (k=1.00 and 0.89, respectively
(95% CI 0.76 to 1.00)) and for the number of acute lesions per
athlete (k=0.94 and 0.91, respectively (95% CI 0.77 to
1.00)).14 All MRI lesions were categorised into (1) ‘adductor’
(adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, pectineus,
gracilis and obturator externus), (2) ‘hip flexor’ (rectus femoris,
iliacus, psoas (or iliopsoas if both or no differentiation could be
made) and sartorius), (3) ‘abdominal’ (rectus abdominis, trans-
verse abdominis, internal and external obliques, and conjoint
tendon) or (4) ‘other’.
Statistical methods
Predicting a positive or negative MRI
W
e used the individual clinical examination tests relevant for
the specific areas as described in table 1. The 2×2 tables were
created using a clinical examination test result (positive/nega-
tive) compared with the MRI result (positive/negative) in the
location relevant for the test, for example, a ‘true positive’
could be a positive adductor stretch test and a positive MRI
lesion in the adductors. A ‘false positive’ could be a positive
adductor stretch test and a negative MRI for an adductor lesion.
W
e then calculated prevalence of the positive examination tests,
sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive and negative likeli-
hood ratios (LR+ and LR−), and predictive values (positive pre-
dictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) in per
cent) for all tests including continuity corrected CIs. W
e used a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve including area
under the curve (AUC) to determine an optimal cut-off point
for the number of tests discriminating between a positive and
negative MRI in the tested area. The AUC is also reported for
all tests individually.
Predicting accurate injury location in MRI-positive cases
Since there is no definite way of determining which structure is
truly injured in MRI-negative cases, we therefore excluded all
MRI-negative cases for use in the further analysis. For this part
of the analysis, we thereby consider MRI as the reference stand-
ard. This will in turn provide a clearer overview of the accuracy
of the individual tests, which can then be used to guide diagno-
sis of players with a negative MRI or players without MRI per-
formed. Different 2×2 tables were then created using the
specific test results, now in comparison to a positive/negative
MRI in a different location, for example, a ‘true positive’ being
a positive adductor stretch test and an MRI lesion in the adduc-
tors. A ‘false positive’ could be a positive adductor stretch test,
but an MRI lesion in the iliopsoas and not the adductors. Sen,
Spe, LR+, LR−, PPV and NPV
, as well as AUC, were calculated
again for each test. Values were also calculated for cases where
all the examination tests were positive or all were negative for
both analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS soft-
ware (V
.21; IBM Corp) and an online statistical calculator
(vassarstats.net/clin1.html).

 RESULTS
During the study period, 100 athletes presented with an acute
groin injury eligible for inclusion. Of these, 13 athletes did not
wish to participate in the study, and 6 athletes initially con-
sented, but MRI was performed more than 7 days after injury.
A total of 81 athletes could therefore be included in the study
analysis (mean age: 25.8 years (SD 4.4, range 18–37), mean
height: 179.7 cm (SD 9.1, range 162–210), mean weight:
77.5 kg (SD 14.1, range 47–125)). All athletes were registered
with national sports federations and playing at the highest or
second highest national level. The athletes were mainly football
players (47 soccer (57%) and 16 futsal (20%)). The other sports
were basketball, handball, volleyball, table tennis and shot putt,
from which seven, five, four, one and one athlete were included,
respectively.
In 17 athletes (21%), no acute lesion was found on MRI. In
the remaining 64 patients with MRI-positive findings, 85 differ-
ent acute lesions were found (table 2). The adductor longus was
the most frequent MRI lesion location (52% of all athletes).
Only one MRI lesion (1.2%) was found in the abdominals. There
were four MRI-positive lesions in muscles not initially considered
in the groin area. Three vastus medialis injuries were reported in
conjunction with an adductor injury, as well as one isolated
tensor fascia latae injury. There were two cases where an acute
MRI lesion was reported in more than one classification group-
ing: one combined adductor and abdominal (adductor longus
and rectus abdominis), and one combined adductor and hip
flexor (adductor longus, gracillis and sartorius). No adverse
effects were reported from performing any of the included tests.
Predicting a positive or negative MRI
Results for the predictive ability of an MRI lesion in the specific
muscles examined with the individual examination tests pre-
sented in table 3 for the adductors and table 4 for the hip flexors.
The adductor tests with the highest PPV of a positive MRI in
the adductors were resisted adduction in outer range, squeeze-0°
and passive adductor stretch (PPV 80–81% (95% CI 63% to
91%), table 3A). Positive hip flexor tests had poor ability to
predict a positive MRI in the hip flexors (PPV 34–63% (95% CI
20% to 84%), table 4A). Since there was only one MRI lesion
in the abdominals, analyses of the individual clinical examin-
ation tests for the abdominals were not performed. Instead, a
simple overview of the frequency of positive findings in the tests
relevant
for
the
abdominals
can
be
found
in
online
supplementary appendix 2, where it is noticeable that clinical
examination tests were often positive without MRI findings.
Owing to severe pain, two athletes could not be positioned in
the Thomas tests position, and an additional four athletes could
not perform the second part of this test involving knee move-
ment, and were therefore excluded from the specific test ana-
lyses (four of these six athletes were diagnosed with an
adductor longus avulsion). The ROC curve analysis showed that
the cut-off number of positive tests for the adductors and hip
flexors was 3 (both p<0.001).
Predicting injury location in MRI-positive cases
Results of the accuracy of the clinical examination tests are
shown in tables 3B and 4B,C for the adductors, iliopsoas and
rectus femoris, respectively. In general, when adductor tests
were positive, there was a high probability of finding an
adductor injury on MRI (PPV 89–100% (95% CI 60% to
100%), table 3B). Specific palpation of the gracilis and pectineus
was, however, less accurate with PPVs of 33% (95% CI 2% to
87%) and 38% (95% CI 10% to 74%), respectively, both with a
relatively low prevalence resulting in large CIs. Positive tests for
iliopsoas and rectus femoris injuries showed poor predictive
ability in accurately locating injuries (PPV 17–71% (95% CI 7%
to 85%), table 4B, C).
DISCUSSION
Clinicians can be confident in locating or ruling out adductor
injuries using simple clinical tests. In contrast, the low PPVs of
accurately locating hip flexor injuries suggest that MRI could
improve the accuracy in the diagnosis of these injuries. The dis-
cussion focuses on the PPV and NPV
, as these are more easily
interpreted by clinicians and patients. Owing to the lower
number of MRI hip flexor lesions, and resulting statistical uncer-
tainty, these specific results should be interpreted as a founda-
tion for further research.
Predicting a negative MRI
Around one in five MRIs were negative. If all clinical tests were
negative, we found very low probability of finding an acute
lesion on MRI: 0% (95% CI 0% to 24%) for adductors and 7%
(95% CI 1% to 24%) for hip flexors. There were only two cases
where all hip flexor tests were negative and a positive hip flexor
lesion was reported on MRI, both in the sartorius. Therefore, it
is highly unlikely to find an acute lesion on MRI, when all stan-
dardised clinical tests used in the current study are negative.
Predicting a negative MRI might be harder when some tests
are positive and others negative. The results of individual tests
should therefore be considered. Of these, palpation showed the
highest probability of a negative MRI with an NPV of 91%
(95% CI 69% to 98%) for adductor palpation and 96% (95%
CI 85% to 99%) for hip flexor palpation. There were only two
cases with false-negative adductor palpation tests. For clinical
purposes, no pain on palpation can be considered a key test to
predict a negative MRI.

 Predicting a positive MRI
When all grouped clinical examination tests were positive, we
found the highest probability of a positive MRI, with a PPV of
83% (95% CI 58% to 96%) for all adductor tests, and 86%
(95% CI 42% to 99%) for all hip flexor tests positive. All tests
were positive in only 31% of cases, so while this combination
has fairly good predictive ability, athletes often present with
fewer positive tests.
W
e examined whether a minimum number of positive tests
exists to predict a positive MRI. W
e found three positive tests to
be the optimum cut-off, yet the predictive ability of this three
test cut-off for adductor and hip flexor tests was worse than the
majority of the individual tests (PPV 76% (95% CI 62% to
87%), and 54% (95% CI 34% to 73%)), respectively. Clinicians
are therefore better off relying on their interpretation of individ-
ual tests rather than a specific cut-off number of positive tests.
The best individual adductor examination tests to predict a
positive MRI in the adductors were resisted outer range adduc-
tion,
squeeze
test
with
neutral
hip
and
long
lever
arm
(squeeze-0°),9 10 and passive adductor stretch test. The predict-
ive values of these tests were similar to having all tests positive,
and as these tests are more often positive (43–59%) than all
adductor tests are positive (22%), these individual tests are
likely to be of most benefit for clinicians attempting to predict a
positive MRI in the adductors.
The best individual hip flexor test to discriminate between a
positive and negative MRI in the hip flexors was palpation.
However, the PPV of an MRI hip flexor lesion was similar to
chance. All individual hip flexor tests had limited capacity to
predict a positive MRI, indicating that hip flexor tests were
often positive without positive MRI findings in the hip
flexors.
Predicting injury location in MRI-positive cases
The highest accuracy in predicting the MRI lesion location was
when all tests for either the adductors or hip flexors were posi-
tive. When all adductor tests were positive, the PPV of an MRI
injury in the adductors was 100%. This suggests that when clini-
cians are presented with an athlete with all adductor tests posi-
tive, there is no need for an MRI if the sole purpose is to
confirm the injury location. For the iliopsoas and rectus femoris
test, this was considerably lower with a PPV of only 71% (95%
CI (0.30% to 0.95%) and 43% (95% CI 0.12% to 0.80%)) for
an accurate location, respectively. Clinicians can therefore not
be certain of an accurate location even when all tests are positive
and can consider imaging if a higher level of confidence regard-
ing injury location is required.
The very high PPVs of most of the individual adductor tests
indicate that MRI is not needed to confirm the injury location,
and that the diagnosis of an acute adductor injury can be com-
fortably made using clinical examination alone. In our study,
squeeze-0° had the highest PPV with a 97% (95% CI 85% to
100%)
probability
of
an
accurate
injury
location.
This
squeeze-0° test has also been shown to be a superior test to
other angles (45° and 90°) for pain provocation induced in the
adductor region,15 and seems to be the best resistance test to
include in the assessment of acute and long-standing adductor-
related groin pain. The clinical entity adductor-related groin
pain has been defined as ‘adductor tenderness AND pain on
resisted adduction testing’,5 which is in line with our results,
where adductor palpation also had a high probability of an
accurate location, PPV 92% (95% CI 79% to 97%). For palpa-
tion of the adductors, we specified three different adductor
muscles, as these were thought to have the highest palpation
reproducibility. W
e found that palpation pain of the pectineus
and gracilis was not very prevalent, which is most likely
reflected in the poor PPVs compared with the adductor longus.
Clinicians should therefore be cautious in specifying clinical
diagnosis to these structures.
Palpation of the iliopsoas and rectus femoris were the individ-
ual tests with the highest probability of an accurate injury loca-
tion as reported on MRI. Both had a 100% probability of a
negative MRI when the test was negative; however, the prob-
ability of an accurate location was not much different than
chance when the test was positive. Accurately predicting the
injury location in the initial clinical examination of acute hip
flexor injuries therefore appears challenging. The poor PPVs of
these tests could explain the previously reported discrepancies
between the clinical diagnoses and imaging findings for acute
iliopsoas and rectus femoris injuries.7 This could also have an
influence in relation to the general taxonomy of groin pain,
where the clinical entity ‘iliopsoas-related groin pain’ is defined
as iliopsoas tenderness, and is deemed more likely if there is
pain on resisted hip flexion and/or pain on stretching.5 Our
study shows that using these clinical criteria is likely to result in
inaccurate classification of acute injuries in this area. Further
research with a larger number of hip flexor injuries is required
to provide more specific recommendations in this regard.
Limitations
The relatively low prevalence of some injuries, especially hip
flexor injuries, is reflected in the fairly large CIs, which should
be considered in the interpretation of our results. Therefore, we
cannot draw firm conclusions from the study for hip flexor or
abdominal injuries. However, on the basis of our results, clini-
cians dealing with injured athletes on an individual basis can be
comfortable in diagnosing the location of an adductor injury
based on clinical examination alone, whereas MRI might be
needed to diagnose injury location in an athlete with an acute
hip flexor injury. W
e also found that the MRI result was often
negative, reflecting limitations in using MRI as a diagnostic gold
standard for injury location in athletes with acute groin injuries.
Further research is required to elucidate whether current MRI
methods are not sensitive enough to detect minor injuries, or
whether there could be other explanations for the acute pain
that potentially cannot be visualised at all. In the future, more
advanced MRI such as compositional and other techniques
including T2 mapping, diffusion-weighted imaging or spectros-
copy might help in elucidating these cases further. A previous
study using MRI in the assessment of long-standing groin pain16
showed that in asymptomatic soccer and non-soccer players,
adductor longus musculotendinous lesions were reported in 2
out of 34 (6%) and 40 (5%) cases, respectively. A clear distinc-
tion between whether these reported lesions could potentially
be related to an older injury was, however, not included in that
study. All positive MRI lesions in our study were divided into
acute and non-acute, with only the acute lesions included in the
analysis. W
e found high intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibil-
ity for this differentiation; intra-rater k=1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to
1.00) absolute agreement 100%, and inter-rater k=0.86 (95%
CI 0.71 to 1.00) absolute agreement 96.7% (Serner et al14). W
e
believe this limits the potential for false-positive MRI findings,
which could have a minor influence on the values provided in
this study. Additionally, it is beyond the scope of this study to
conclude on the clinical implications in relation to potential
treatment and prognostic variations in response to the diagnos-
tic considerations, such as injury severity.

 CONCLUSION
Specific adductor examination tests (resisted outer range adduc-
tion, adductor stretch and the squeeze test in hip neutral pos-
ition) individually provided ∼80% probability of predicting a
positive MRI in the adductors. These adductor examination
tests also provided very high probability of predicting an accur-
ate injury location. In contrast, individual hip flexor pain provo-
cation tests had poor ability to predict a positive MRI, and poor
accuracy. The absence of palpation pain was the best test result
to predict a negative MRI in athletes with acute groin injuries.
What are the findings?
▸ A negative MRI was found in one in five athletes (21%)
with acute groin injury. The absence of palpation pain in the
adductors and hip flexors had the highest predictive values
for ruling out acute injury on MRI.
▸ Positive individual adductor tests provide ∼80% probability
of a positive MRI in the adductors, with the highest positive
predictive values for resisted outer range adduction, squeeze
test with hip neutral and long lever, and passive adductor
stretch.
▸ These specific adductor tests also show high accuracy (92–
97% probability) of confirming that the injury is located in
the adductors on MRI.
▸ Individual hip flexor tests are poor at predicting a positive
MRI and locating which hip flexor muscle is injured.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Clinicians can use clinical examination in acute adductor injuries
to predict whether an MRI will show an acute injury in the
adductors or not. Additionally, since the clinical adductor
examination tests showed high accuracy in MRI-positive cases,
the clinical examination appears sufficient to confirm the
location of acute adductor injuries. In contrast, when clinicians
assess acute hip flexor injuries, they can be less confident about
predicting the injury location, as seen on MRI, using clinical
tests. This knowledge may influence the decision whether or not
imaging with MRI is required.
