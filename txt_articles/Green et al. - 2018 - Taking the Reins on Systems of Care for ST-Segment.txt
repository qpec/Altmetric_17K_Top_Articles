eart disease remains the leading cause of death in the 
United States1 and, in 2013, accounted for $96.4 bil-
lion in total healthcare expenditures.2 Every year >750 000 
Americans suffer a myocardial infarction, and 30% of these are 
ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI).3 The 
time from first medical contact (FMC) to treatment in STEMI 
is a critical determinant of patient outcomes.4 Emergency 
medical services (EMS) systems that can take patients directly 
to a hospital capable of performing immediate percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) may dramatically shorten delays 
by bypassing other hospitals that do not provide such ser-
vices. When a patient initially is taken to a non-PCI–capable 
hospital, considerable treatment delays are introduced as the 
patient must be evaluated, triaged, and wait for a second EMS 
transport to be called, arrive, and take the patient from the ini-
tial hospital to the PCI hospital. However, not all EMS provid-
ers have the ability or authority to diagnose a STEMI and drive 
past the nearest hospital to a PCI-capable hospital.

States differ greatly in their policies for EMS, and hospi-
tal bypass for time-critical conditions such as heart attack or 
trauma is far from universal in the United States.5 Although 28 
states have mandatory hospital destination policies for trauma 
patients, only 9 states currently have such policies for STEMI.6

Background—Early success with regionalization of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care has led 
many states to adopt statewide prehospital STEMI hospital destination policies, allowing emergency medical services to 
bypass non–percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals. The association between adoption of these policies 
and patterns of care among STEMI patients is unknown.
Methods and Results—Using data from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, from the National Cardiovascular Data 
Registry and Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry, 6 states with bypass policies 
(cases included Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts) were matched to 6 states 
without bypass policies (controls included South Carolina, Minnesota, Virginia, Texas, New York, and Connecticut) 
a priori on region, hospital density, and percent state participation in the registry. Using the matched sample, logistic 
regression models were adjusted for patient- and state-level characteristics. Outcomes were receipt of reperfusion and 
receipt of timely percutaneous coronary intervention. Our study cohort included 19 287 patients at 379 sites across 12 
states. Patients from states with hospital destination policies were similar in age, sex, and comorbidities to patients 
from states without such policies. After adjustment for patient- and state-level characteristics, 57.9% (95% confidence 
intervals, 53.2%–62.5%) of patients living in states with hospital destination policies when compared with 47.5% (95% 
confidence intervals, 43.4%–51.7%) living in states without hospital destination policies received primary percutaneous 
coronary intervention within their relevant guideline-recommended time from first medical contact.
Conclusions—Statewide adoption of STEMI hospital destination policies allowing emergency medical services to bypass 
non–percutaneous coronary intervention–capable facilities is associated with significantly faster treatment times for patients 
with STEMI.  (Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2018;11:e005706. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.117.005706.)

STEMI.7 Thus, states may be best suited to lead regionalization 
efforts through regulatory mandates by acting as a neutral broker 
and directing resources toward this goal,8 but few states have 
taken on this responsibility and some lack the regulatory author-
ity to establish such systems.6 Recently, state governments such 
as Illinois and Colorado have considered legislation to promote 
this process for STEMI, but these bills were ultimately tabled. 
As additional state governments grapple with the administra-
tive and financial commitment to regionalize STEMI systems of 
care, they need data on the impact of state government participa-
tion in this process. In this study, we sought to answer the fol-
lowing question: are patients who live in states that have adopted 
mandatory statewide hospital destination policies for STEMI 
more likely to receive reperfusion therapy or immediate PCI 
within guideline-recommended time frames than patients living 
in similar states without such policies?
Methods
We identified all patients with STEMI who arrived at the final desti-
nation hospital Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes 
Network (ACTION PCI center) by EMS using ACTION Registry-Get 
With The Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) data from January 1, 
2013, to December 31, 2014 (Figure 1). The registry is a large quality 
improvement registry with voluntary participation from hospitals in the 
United States.9 ACTION Registry-GWTG serves as the hospital data 
collection and evaluation mechanism for American Heart Association 
Mission: Lifeline. The Duke Clinical Research Institute serves as the 
data analysis center and has an agreement to analyze the aggregate 
deidentified data for research purposes. Several authors of this article 
are part of the Duke Clinical Research Institute and had full access to 
all the data in the study and take responsibility for its integrity and the 
data analysis. The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not 
be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the 
results or replicating the procedure. The registry has been granted a 
waiver of informed consent by the designated internal review board for 
the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, which oversees the ACTION 
Registry-GWTG. Hospitals participating in the registry submit clinical 
information on the medical history, hospital care, and outcomes of con-
secutive patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome using an on-
line, interactive case report form supplied by ACTION Registry-GWTG.
In 2013, Kupas et al6 conducted a survey of all state EMS directors 
or EMS medical directors to define current characteristics of statewide 
policies for EMS in the United States. Fifty states responded to the 
survey, which identified 9 states as having mandatory statewide hospi-
tal destination policies used by all EMS providers within the state that 
guide EMS transport of patients with STEMI directly to a PCI-capable 
hospital if appropriate. Each of these states’ EMS offices was con-
tacted, and the date of policy adoption and full implementation was 
confirmed. States that had implemented their policies by 2013 were 
selected as case states in our analysis. Using a greedy matching algo-
rithm, 6 states with hospital destination policies (cases) were matched 
to 6 states without hospital destination policies (controls) a priori on 
region, hospital density, and percent state participation in the registry.
We constructed several regression models to isolate the effects of 
living in states that have adopted hospital destination policies. Our 
key outcomes were (1) primary PCI within 90 minutes and (2) 120 
minutes from FMC and (3) overall receipt of reperfusion therapy. 
Using the matched sample, logistic regression models adjusted for 
patient- and state-level characteristics and accounting for case–con-
trol match were fitted for receipt of any reperfusion therapy and PCI 
within guideline-recommended time frames. To account for the case–
control match, indicator variables for each case–control match were 
included in the logistic regression models.
Results
Our case states were Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, North Caro-
lina, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts and were matched to the 
respective control states: South Carolina, Minnesota, Virginia, 
Texas, New York, and Connecticut, with 19 287 patients at 379 
sites (Table 1). The number of patients and number of sites var-
ied greatly between individual states, but overall contributed to 2 
well-balanced groups of patients (Table 2). Patients from states 
with hospital destination policies were similar in age, sex, and 
comorbidities to patients from states without hospital destination 
policies (Table 2). They were more likely to be white, have pri-
vate insurance, and reside in rural areas in unadjusted analysis.
Hospital-level characteristics between the 2 groups were 
similar, with more than three quarters (78%) of patients admit-
ted to hospitals having on-site cardiothoracic surgery avail-
able, 77% classifying as nonacademic, and a mean number of 
hospital beds of 448. States without hospital destination poli-
cies tended to have a lower hospital density and population 
density than states with hospital destination policies. State-
level median household income, race, and percent participa-
tion in the registry were comparable between groups (Table 3).
When we examined intermediate steps in the process of 
STEMI care, we noticed interesting trends. Rates of prehospital 
ECG utilization were high, and patients in states with hospital 
destination policies were more likely to have a prehospital ECG 
obtained (74.7%) than patients in states without hospital desti-
nation policies (68.7%). The time of symptom onset to hospi-
tal arrival was no different between the 2 groups, even though 
patients in states with hospital destination policies received treat-
ment faster from the time of FMC. However, there was a >10% 
missing rate for the variable symptom onset to reperfusion time. 
Finally, the median time from symptom onset to hospital arrival 
was quite lengthy in both groups, 1.5 hours overall with a 25th 
quartile of 1 hour and a 75th quartile of 2.7 hours (Table 2).
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Time to treatment in ST-segment–elevation myocar-
dial infarctions (STEMI) is a critical determinant of 
patient outcomes.
• Reducing delays relies on a robust emergency medi-
cal system (EMS) that can transport a patient directly 
to a percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hos-
pital, even if it means driving past a closer hospital.
• Competition between hospitals, physician groups, 
and EMS agencies presents substantial barriers to 
the establishment and implementation of successful 
EMS systems of care for STEMI.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• State-level EMS policies improve quality of care for 
STEMI patients.
• STEMI patients who live in a state with a state-
level policy that allows EMS to take them directly 
to a hospital with the ability to immediately perform 
percutaneous coronary intervention receive guideline-
recommended care faster than STEMI patients who 
live in states without a state policy.

Several important observations are demonstrated in 
Figure 2. First, patients living in states that have adopted 
hospital destination policies were significantly more likely 
to receive timely primary PCI. This time advantage persisted 
at 90 and 120 minutes from FMC, respectively (odds ratio 
[OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–2.12 and OR, 
1.44; 95% CI, 1.06–1.95). Second, overall unadjusted rates of 
receipt of any reperfusion therapy were high at 96.8%, with 
a trend toward higher use for patients in states with hospital 
destination policies in the adjusted analysis (OR, 1.77; 95% 
CI, 0.96–3.24). In summary, living in a state with a statewide 
prehospital plan for EMS transport of STEMI patients is asso-
ciated with faster treatment times.
Some patients in our study (13%) were transported by EMS 
to a non-PCI–capable hospital first and subsequently were 
transferred to a PCI-capable hospital. The American College of 
Cardiology/ American Heart Association treatment guidelines 
for STEMI care recommend that patients who arrive directly to 
a PCI-capable hospital receive PCI in <90 minutes and patients 
who are transferred into a PCI-capable hospital receive PCI in 
<120 minutes from FMC.3 Therefore, we examined if patients 
were more likely to receive PCI within the relevant guideline 
time recommendation, taking into account their mode of arrival 
to the PCI-capable hospital (direct arrival versus transfer-in). 
Figure 3 demonstrates that after adjustment for patient- and 
state-level characteristics, 57.9% (95% CIs, 53.2%–62.5%) 
of patients living in states with hospital destination policies 
when compared with 47.5% (95% CIs, (43.4%–51.7%) living 
in states without hospital destination policies received primary 
PCI within their relevant guideline-recommended time from 
FMC. This analysis reinforces our conclusion that living in a 
state with a statewide prehospital plan for EMS transport of 
STEMI patients is associated with faster treatment times.
Discussion
Our study suggests that statewide hospital destination poli-
cies for STEMI organized by the state government allow 
EMS providers to more effectively triage patients to meet 
guideline recommendations. STEMI patients living in states 
with statewide hospital destination policies were more 
likely to receive any reperfusion therapy and were more 
likely to receive timely PCI than STEMI patients in states 
without such policies.
The implications of these findings are broad and impor-
tant. There are several potential explanations for why a state-
wide plan for EMS transport of patients with time-critical 
conditions would be more effective than local or regional 
policies. Many EMS agencies provide services in multiple 
counties and health systems, so having a statewide hospi-
tal destination policy streamlines expectations for patient 
transport, data collection, and quality improvement. A state-
wide system of EMS care for STEMI can account for and

facilitate coordination with multiple involved agencies such 
as fire, law enforcement, EMS, hospitals, and public health 
to better ensure accountability and system integrity.5 In addi-
tion, state governments currently license EMS and other 
healthcare providers, so policies developed by a state lead 
agency may better account for the training and qualifications 
of various healthcare providers caring for STEMI patients 
within a state. Finally, a state lead agency has the potential 
legal authority and resources to designate and recognize spe-
cialty receiving centers.
Still the question of governance10 remains controversial 
in EMS systems of care, and despite these advantages to 
state leadership, many states have not created statewide sys-
tems of emergency care for time-critical conditions.6 Some 
state EMS offices lack the statutory authority to recognize or 
designate specialty receiving centers or to enforce statewide 
hospital destination policies. A potential reason has been the 
lack of clear evidence for their benefit that has pushed for 
greater movement in this area. Other concerns have been 
raised that these policies may disadvantage non-PCI–capa-
ble hospitals, but evidence for this is lacking.11 Our findings 
suggest that state EMS offices can be very effective in orga-
nizing systems of care for STEMI that enhance the quality 
of STEMI care, extending the reach of prior public policy 
directed toward in-hospital quality metrics for STEMI12 to 
the out-of-hospital setting.
Our data show that STEMI patients receive primary PCI 
in a timelier manner in those states that facilitate direct EMS 
transport to PCI-capable hospitals (OR, 57.9%; 95% CIs, 
53.2%–62.5% versus OR, 47.5%; 95% CI, 43.4%–51.7%,

respectively). It also is noteworthy that the overall reduction 
in time from both FMC to balloon and door to balloon seems 
rather modest at 4 minutes for patients living in states with 
hospital destination policies. Controversy remains over the 
potential clinical significance of reducing total ischemic time 
by a few minutes when times are already within guideline-
recommended time frames. For example, Menees et al13 did 
not find a significant reduction in in-hospital or unadjusted 
30-day mortality associated with annual trends in improve-
ments in door-to-balloon times by roughly 16 minutes on a 
population level. Nallamothu et al,14 however, reanalyzed the 
same data after accounting for the potential of an ecological 
fallacy and demonstrated that effects at the individual level 
are important even if modest at the population level. The 
mean door-to-balloon times in our study, of 48 minutes for 
patients living in states with hospital destination policies and 
52 minutes for patients living in states without hospital des-
tination policies, were well within guideline-recommended 
time frames for both groups. Many mitigating factors affect-
ing STEMI mortality continue to exist when considering 
both population- and individual-level effects, and most car-
diologists still agree that minimizing total ischemic time 
improves patient outcomes.
A key challenge we noted was that a substantial number 
of patients failed to access EMS or delayed accessing EMS. 
For example, 27% of potentially eligible (129 968/478 285) 
STEMI patients in our study (Figure 1) self-transported to 
a hospital, without using EMS. This finding is consistent 
with previous work.15 Thus, failure to access EMS identi-
fies yet another objective for process improvement. In our 
study, time from symptom onset to presentation remained a 
substantial barrier to timely care in both study groups. This

factor is largely influenced by the time it takes for a patient 
to call EMS. Community health literacy about heart attack 
symptoms and the importance of calling 9-1-1 remain addi-
tional barriers to timely STEMI care. Although statewide 
EMS mandates for hospital transport of STEMI patients 
seem to expedite guideline-compliant STEMI care, delay 
or failure to access EMS remains an important objective for 
improvement.
Our finding that a state-level policy intervention focused 
on EMS processes improved STEMI care is consistent with 
prior studies,16 showing that modifying EMS processes can 
improve STEMI care without increasing the number of PCI-
providing centers. Despite an estimated increase in US PCI 
capacity of 44% between 2000 and 2006, with an estimated 
521 new PCI programs, access increased only marginally 
at an estimated 1%, defined as 60 minutes or less ground 
transportation driving time.17 Similarly between 2004 and 
2008, a 16.5% increase in PCI capacity translated into only 
a modest 1.8% increase in access to timely PCI.18 Thus, it is 
noteworthy that the improvements in STEMI care delivery 
seem to have been achieved without expanding the number 
of PCI-capable centers.
Our method for selecting control states used a reproduc-
ible and nonbiased approach to identify patients as similar 
as possible to the patients in case states. An unintended, but 
serendipitous consequence of this was the inclusion of sev-
eral control states that have sophisticated systems of STEMI 
care championed by the private sector and without formal 
state government policies. Although inclusion of these states 
potentially diluted the strength of the associations observed 
in this study, it provides a unique counterbalance to the argu-
ment that local and regional solutions are as effective as 
state-led systems of EMS care for time-critical conditions.
Our study has a few limitations. First, we evaluated a 
state-level policy intervention in a cohort of voluntary hospi-
tals with incomplete penetration of the registry in every state. 
For this reason, we used penetration of ACTION Registry-
GWTG within each state as a criterion for state selection and 
matching. Second, some states without hospital destination 
policies have local and regional systems of care that are not 
accounted for in our analysis. The registry does not collect 
location of FMC by EMS in the field, and, therefore, we 
were unable to adjust for driving times to the nearest PCI-
capable hospital. Third, patients had to survive to arrival at an 
ACTION hospital to be included in this analysis, and thus, we 
may have missed patients who died before evaluation within 
the healthcare system or en route to definitive therapy. Finally, 
our study is observational and cannot definitively determine a 
causal link between hospital destination policies and patterns 
of care for STEMI patients. Yet the study of state-level policy 
interventions is rarely assessed using randomized designs 
and, thus, frequently relies on natural experiments that com-
pare interventions across similar communities.
Conclusions
Statewide EMS policies directing transport of STEMI patients 
to hospitals for immediate PCI improve their timely receipt of 
guideline-recommended therapy.
