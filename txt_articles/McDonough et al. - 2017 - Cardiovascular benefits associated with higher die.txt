First published February 7, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00453.2016.—The World
Health Organization ranks hypertension the leading global risk factor for disease,
specifically, cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure (BP) is higher in Westernized
populations consuming Na�-rich processed foods than in isolated societies con-
suming K�-rich natural foods. Evidence suggests that lowering dietary Na� is
particularly beneficial in hypertensive individuals who consume a high-Na� diet.
Nonetheless, numerous population studies demonstrate a relationship between
higher dietary K�, estimated from urinary excretion or dietary recall, and lower BP,
regardless of Na� intake. Interventional studies with K� supplementation suggest
that it provides a direct benefit; K� may also be a marker for other beneficial
components of a “natural” diet. Recent studies in rodent models indicate
mechanisms for the K� benefit: the distal tubule Na�-Cl� cotransporter (NCC)
controls Na� delivery downstream to the collecting duct, where Na� reab-
sorbed by epithelial Na� channels drives K� secretion and excretion through
K� channels in the same region. High dietary K� provokes a decrease in NCC
activity to drive more K� secretion (and Na� excretion, analogous to the
actions of a thiazide diuretic) whether Na� intake is high or low; low dietary
K� provokes an increase in NCC activity and Na� retention, also independent of
dietary Na�. Together, the findings suggest that public health efforts directed
toward increasing consumption of K�-rich natural foods would reduce BP and,
thus, cardiovascular and kidney disease.
dietary potassium; dietary sodium; ENaC; hypertension; NCC
ACCORDING TO THE World Health Organization, the leading risk
factor for global disease burden is high blood pressure (BP),
accounting for 7.0% of the global disability life years (DALYs)
(34). In this analysis, the dietary risk factors contributing to
disease burden, and relevant to hypertension, include diets low
in fruits, diets high in Na�, and diets low in vegetables (4.2%,
2.5%, and 1.5% DALYs, respectively). Hypertension and these
dietary factors contributed primarily to cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs), such as ischemic heart disease and stroke (34). While
deaths from heart disease and stroke have been halved during
the past 40 yr, hypertension prevalence remains very high, and
only 50% of hypertensive individuals have their BP under
control (32). The thesis has been presented that the interaction
of the dietary Na� surfeit coupled to relative K� deficiency,
rather than either alone, is the critical environmental factor
contributing to the hypertension in Western cultures (2, 3).
These World Health Organization study findings suggest that
lifestyle modification, specifically consumption of diets high in
fruits and vegetables (rich sources of K�) and low in Na�, may
reduce the disease burden of hypertension and, thus, morbidity
and mortality of CVDs. This minireview aims to summarize
the evidence for influences of dietary Na�, K�, and the
Na�-to-K� ratio on BP at the level of population studies,
interventional studies, and molecular mechanisms.
Population Studies on the Influences of Dietary Sodium
and Potassium
Habitual daily salt intake, which can range from 0.05 g
NaCl/day in the Yanomamö population to �10 g/day in West-
ern cultures (Table 1), correlates with the rise in BP with age
across populations (38). Interestingly, populations consuming
very low Na� exhibit low BP coupled to greatly elevated
components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system com-
pared with those consuming a “Western” diet (2, 45). When
people move from isolated to industrialized societies, their BP
and dietary Na�-to-K� ratio rise, leading experts to postulate

 that the hypertension is linked to the rise in the Na�-to-K�
ratio (2, 3, 68). In a study of vegetarians living in Massachu-
setts, mean arterial pressures were 10–15 mmHg lower and
rose less with age than in nonvegetarians (53). While vegetar-
ians consume abundant K� and alkali-rich fruits and vegeta-
bles, it is not clear whether these dietary constituents are
simply markers for a “healthy” diet or whether a diet with a
lower Na�-to-K� ratio provides the benefit itself. Additionally,
whether the putative benefit is due to lower Na�, higher K�, or
the Na�-to-K� ratio has not been clarified.
Regarding dietary Na�, Mente and colleagues recently re-
ported, in a pooled study of �100,000 people from 40 coun-
tries, that the association of urinary Na� excretion (a surrogate
marker for Na� intake) with cardiovascular events was actu-
ally U-shaped (39, 40). In 50% of participants, Na� excretion
in this meta-analysis was 4–6 g/day. When stratified into
hypertensive and nonhypertensive populations (n � 60,000
each), high Na� excretion (6–12 g/day) was associated with
increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the hyper-
tensive population alone, whereas there was no significant
association within the normotensive population, with Na�
excretion between 4 and 12 g/day (39). Mente and colleagues
recommended that people with hypertension and high-Na�
diets should be specifically targeted for lowering dietary Na�.
The recommended salt intake of 2.3 g/day (28) is about half the
average amount consumed in this study. In hypertensive and
nonhypertensive groups, Na� excretion in this recommended
range was associated with significantly elevated risk of cardio-
vascular events and death (39). This unexpected finding stim-
ulated commentaries that suggested the following caveats: 1)
numbers were low in the low-Na� analysis—only 10% of the
population excreted �3 g/day and only 4% excreted �2.4
g/day, the current recommended maximum; 2) results were
based on a single morning urine; 3) Na� excretion may have
been low because some individuals were ill; and 4) there was
no consideration of K� excretion (12). Related to the last point,
a previous study of the same population did extract the rela-
tionship between K� excretion, Na� excretion, and BP (40):
the highest BPs were observed in the group with Na� �5 g/day
and K��1.9 g/day (Na�-to-K� ratio �2.5) and the lowest BPs
in the group with Na� �3 g/day and K� �2.5 g/day (Na�-
to-K� ratio ~1), indicating that the Na�-to-K� ratio was an
important predictor. Before we leave the topic of dietary Na�,
it is worth discussing the salt-reduction program undertaken in
the United Kingdom (24). Between 2003 and 2011, there was
a 15% reduction in salt intake in the general population (from
9.5 to 8.0 g/day, estimated from 24-h urine Na�). During this
time period, BP decreased 3 mmHg and stroke deaths and
ischemic heart disease decreased 40% after adjustment for
multiple factors, including fruit and vegetable intake and body
mass index, both of which increased.
Earlier studies are worth noting. The Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File (69),
conducted between 1988 and 2006 in 12,000 people, used 24-h
dietary recalls and reported that higher dietary Na�-to-K� ratio
increased the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Interest-
ingly, the ratio was a stronger predictor than dietary Na� or K�
alone. For the more recent Prevention of Renal and Vascular
Endstage Disease prospective study of �5,000 nonmedicated
normotensive individuals, 24-h urine (a more rigorous assess-
ment of intakes than dietary recall) was collected twice at 3- to
4-yr intervals and participants were followed for 7.6 yr, during
which time 20% developed hypertension. The authors calcu-
lated that “six percent of all incident hypertension cases
seemed to be attributable to suboptimal dietary potassium” and
concluded that strategies to increase K� intake to the recom-
mended 90 mmol/day (3.5 g/day) have the potential to reduce
the incidence of hypertension (30). Three additional studies in
smaller populations are also worth noting. Hedayati and col-
leagues (26) used robust linear regression to examine the
relationship between urinary Na�-to-K� ratio and BP in 3,303
African Americans and non-African Americans of both sexes.
They discovered that higher BPs correlated with higher urine
Na�-to-K� ratio (1.6-mmHg rise in systolic pressure for each
3-unit increase in urine Na�-to-K� ratio); the effect was more
pronounced in men than women and in African Americans.
Rodrigues and colleagues (51) investigated the effect of K� on
the contribution of dietary Na� to BP in a population of 1,661
Brazilians with mean urinary Na�-to-K� ratio of 5. No appar-
ent benefit of dietary K� was evident in participants excreting
�6 g NaCl/day. In contrast, an inverse association of BP with
K� intake was evident in participants consuming �6 g NaCl/
day, and those in the highest quartile of K� excretion exhibited
no hypertension, supporting the idea that K� blunts the influ-
ence of high Na� intake on BP. There have been very few
studies of the development of hypertension in children, yet a
prospective study in adolescent girls warrants discussion.
Buendia et al. (7) assessed Na� and K� intake by dietary recall
and BP in 2,185 girls age 9–10 yr followed up yearly for 10 yr.
The study did not detect an effect of Na� intake on BP with age
[range 2.5 g/day (low) to � 4 g/day (high)]. On the other hand,
K� intake [range �1.8 g/day (low) to �2.4 g/day (high)] was
inversely correlated with BP. The study concluded that ado-
lescents should eat K�-rich foods to blunt the developmental
rise in BP.

Urinary Na� and K� levels are used as surrogate biomarkers for dietary Na� and K� intake (which assumes input � output at steady state). Individuals in
isolated communities generally consume unprocessed foods, leading to overall low-Na�–high-K� diets; e.g., the diet of Yanomamö natives of the Amazon is
very low in Na�, which provokes renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation (44, 45). When people move from isolated to industrialized societies and
increase consumption of salted processed foods, their Na� intake rises and K� falls, raising the dietary Na�-to-K� ratio above 1 and lowing levels of renin and
aldosterone (2, 3). On the basis of epidemiological and interventional studies such as the DASH diet (5), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends
consumption of a diet with a Na�-to-K� ratio below 1, specifically, Na� �2,300 mg/day (100 meq) and K� 4,700 mg/day (120 meq) (62).

 In further support of a K�-rich diet, in a study of �500,000
people in China between 30 and 79 yr old, without CVD or
antihypertensive treatment at baseline, participants were que-
ried regarding frequency of fresh fruit consumption, a rich
source of dietary K� (14). BP (systolic reduced 4 mmHg),
blood glucose (reduced 9.0 mg/dl), and risks of major CVDs
such as ischemic heart disease and stroke (adjusted hazard
ratios of 0.60 for cardiovascular deaths) were significantly
lower in participants who reported daily or frequent fruit
consumption than in those who ate fruit rarely to never. Based
on studies like these, Drewnowski and colleagues (13) ana-
lyzed the monetary cost of diets based on K�, Na�, and
Na�-to-K� ratios and concluded that K�-rich diets were as-
sociated with higher costs, while higher-Na� diets were not.
These investigators recommended that lowering costs of cer-
tain K�-rich foods could be an effective mechanism to lower
the dietary Na�-to-K� ratio and recommended identifying
low-cost high-K� foods that should be promoted (e.g., dried
beans, potatoes, coffee, skim milk, and bananas).
A number of studies also indicate that higher dietary K�
slows the decline in renal function during chronic diseases.
In a study of Japanese type 2 diabetic patients followed for
11 yr, Araki et al. (6) reported that higher K� excretion was
associated with a slower decline in renal function and CVD
progression and suggested that future studies should eva-
luate the effects of increasing dietary K� intake in this
burgeoning population. A 2014 study from the ONTARGET
and TRANSCEND investigators (58) evaluated 29,000 partic-
ipants with established vascular disease or diabetes at high
cardiovascular risk for a mean of 4.5 yr and evaluated renal
outcomes, including glomerular filtration rate decline, protein-
uria, and hyperkalemia, as a function of fasting morning urine
Na� and K� (as surrogates for intake). They observed no
association between Na� and any renal outcome over a range
of intakes from 3 to 6 g/day. In contrast, there was a strong
linear association between higher K� intake and reduced renal
outcomes over a range of intakes from 1.7 to 2.7 g/day. The
authors state that their findings do not support recommenda-
tions to lower Na� intake to �3 g/day, and they suggest that
high-K� diets may benefit the kidney; they recommend against
prematurely restricting dietary K�, especially in patients with
normal plasma K� concentration ([K�]). A 2016 study ad-
dressing the effects of dietary Na� and K� on the progression
of patients from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal
disease or death concluded that progression is reduced when
chronic kidney disease patients consumed the lowest quartiles
of Na� and K�, suggesting that as the kidney fails and
medications that affect Na� and K� transport are added, the
renal capacity to regulate K� homeostasis is compromised and
K� is no longer beneficial (25).
Interventional Studies on the Influence of Dietary Sodium
and Potassium
While studies show an inverse association of BP with K�
intake, it remains possible that K� intake is an indicator, rather
than the actual mediator, of the benefit. Interventional studies
have been conducted to address whether K� intake is an actual
mediator of the cardiovascular benefit. Twenty-five years ago,
in a small study of hypertensive individuals with controlled
BP, Siani and colleagues examined the impact of simple
nutritional advice aimed at increasing K� intake from natural
foods (56). In those given dietary advice (n � 26), K� intake,
estimated from urinary K� excretion, increased to 50-70 meq/
day, but urine K� did not change in the controls (n � 21); urine
Na� remained unchanged in both groups. After 1 yr, 81% of
the patients with the elevated dietary K� reduced their medi-
cations by 50% compared with 29% of the patients not con-
suming more K�. A meta-analysis of 33 studies in which
dietary K� supplementation was the only intervention variable
(with 2,609 participants) concluded that K� supplementation
significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 3.11 and 1.97
mmHg, respectively; the effects were larger in the studies in
which participants consumed more Na� (68).
Not specifically a K� supplementation study, the highly
regarded Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)
studies investigated the impact of consuming a diet rich in
vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products (including whole
grains, poultry, fish, and nuts) and reduced in fat, red meat,
sweets, and sugar-containing beverages. The DASH diet, ad-
ministered to participants consuming low, intermediate, or high
levels of Na� for 30 days, lowered BP at all Na� levels. The
greatest impact of the DASH diet was observed in the group
consuming the highest levels of Na� (5, 54). The effects of
fruits and vegetables per se, studied in parallel, were shown to
lower BP but were not as effective as the DASH diet. The
DASH diet has been shown to be effective in hypertensive
individuals, the elderly, and African Americans (4). Recently,
recognizing that poor dietary habits are leading drivers of CVD
and that lifestyle modifications are the first recommendation in
hypertension, Gay et al. carried out a meta-analysis comparing
the efficacy of a number of different dietary interventions on
BP: the DASH diet, a low-Na�–high-K� diet, a low-Na�–
low-calorie diet, a low-Na� diet, and the Mediterranean diet
(20). The DASH diet had the largest effect, reducing systolic
and diastolic BPs by 7.6 and 4.22 mmHg, respectively. In
comparison, the low-Na�–high-K� diets decreased systolic
and diastolic BPs by about half as much as the DASH diet, and
the other diets had even smaller effects. The impact of the
DASH diet score (calculated on the basis of reported intake of
fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, legumes and
nuts, red meat, and soda) on subsequent kidney disease was
examined prospectively over 23 yr in a cohort of 15,000
participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study
(49). More than 3,000 participants developed kidney disease.
While the study did not include measures of albuminuria (an
indicator of renal disease), the results did indicate that partic-
ipants in the highest DASH score quartile were 16% less likely
to develop kidney disease than those in the lowest DASH score
quartile; interestingly, the dietary components that appeared
most beneficial were nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy. Overall,
a DASH-style diet, which has a lower Na�-to-K� ratio, ap-
pears beneficial for lowering BP and slowing progression of
kidney disease, but the exact component(s) that provide the
benefit are not clear.
One of the most deliberate interventional studies to examine
the effect of dietary K� on cardiovascular health was con-
ducted a decade ago by Chang et al. (9) in a population of
elderly Taiwanese male veterans with normal renal function
living in retirement communities. K�-enriched salt (49%
NaCl-49% KCl) was provided to two kitchens (n � 635) and
regular salt to three kitchens (n � 916); condiments such as soy

 sauce and monosodium glutamate were not restricted. Partici-
pants were studied over 31 mo. Intakes of Na� and K� were
estimated on the basis of urinary excretion normalized to urine
creatinine (UK/UCr, UNa/UCr) in ~25% of the participants:
UNa/UCr decreased 10%, and UK/UCr increased 70%. At 30 mo,
a 40% relative risk reduction in CVD mortality was evident,
indicating that a minor adjustment in dietary salt intake, raising
K� 70% and lowering Na� 10%, can have a major impact on
CVD mortality. On the basis of the results of this study, a 2014
study in 282 hypertensive Tibetans living at high altitude asked
whether a 65% NaCl-25% KCl-10% MgSO4 salt substitute
could lower BP (71). After 3 mo, systolic and diastolic BPs
(after adjustment for baseline and other variables) decreased ~8
and 3.5 mmHg, respectively, lending support to this simple
approach to reduce BP in remote populations.
A review of 52 studies conducted between 1990 and 2013 by
Aaron and Sanders (1) concurs with the findings of the popu-
lation and interventional studies discussed above. The authors
do not provide a recommendation for a lower limit for Na� or
an upper limit for K� consumption, but they do conclude that
raising dietary K� blunts the effects of high dietary Na�,
especially in overweight and aging adults. They recommend a
general strategy of modest Na� restriction with increasing K�
intake to control BP, prevent kidney disease and stroke, and
reduce CVD mortality.
Molecular Mechanisms That Facilitate the Cardiovascular
Benefits of Raising Dietary Potassium
Why does elevating dietary K� reduce the incidence of
hypertension and CVD, even in the presence of normal-to-high
dietary Na�? The answer appears to lie in homeostasis hierar-
chies: the body does a balancing act to maintain circulating
Na� mass and volume, K�, and osmolality, among other
factors. K� has a high homeostatic priority because of its
critical importance in determining membrane potential and,
thus, nerve and muscle function. Na� and volume homeostasis
appear to take a backseat to K� homeostasis, because K�
homeostasis is maintained by the concerted regulation of Na�,
as well as K�, transporters and channels in the renal distal
nephron, the subject of numerous recent reviews (15, 16, 23,
47). In this aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (Fig. 1), Na� is
reabsorbed along the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) via Na�-
Cl� cotransporters (NCC), influenced by NCC distribution in
the plasma membrane vs. subapical vesicles and, by activating
phosphorylation, “NCCp” (46, 55). Na� reabsorption by NCC
determines the fractional delivery of Na� downstream to the
epithelial Na� channels (ENaC), which reabsorb Na� when
activated by proteolytic cleavage in the plasma membrane (31).
Na� reabsorbed by ENaC provides an electrochemical driving
force for K� secretion via the renal outer medullary K�
channel, as well as flow-sensitive K� channels (27, 67). Thus
K� secretion and excretion are dependent on the state of Na�
transporter (NCC and ENaC) activation, which is also key to
Na� and effective circulating volume (ECV) homeostasis.
Recent studies investigating the molecular mechanisms respon-
sible for excreting K� shed light on this relationship (48, 50,
59). Whether K� is provided by gavage, with a meal, or
infused into a rodent, [K�] in the extracellular fluid provides a
signal to rapidly dephosphorylate NCC, which reduces Na�
reabsorption in the DCT, provoking a downstream shift in Na�
reabsorption to ENaC, where it drives K� secretion and ex-
cretion (Fig. 2B) (50, 59). Since ENaC activation cannot
completely compensate for the inhibition of higher-capacity
NCC, the K�-rich meal provokes acute increases in urinary
Na�, as well as K� (50, 59, 64). As summarized in Table 2,
columns III and IV, the natriuretic consequences of K� adap-
tation can contribute to reducing ECV and BP, likely contrib-
uting to the association between high-K� diets and lower BP in
the population studies discussed above (15, 47) and in individ-
uals consuming the DASH diet (5). Conversely, a low-K� diet
(or factors that increase urinary K� loss) provokes an increase
in NCC abundance and phosphorylation, especially evident
with high-salt diet consumption, in order to reduce Na� deliv-
ery to ENaC and reduce urinary K�; the NCC activation during
Na�-replete–K�-deficient feeding in rodents is associated with
a significant antinatriuresis and a rise in BP (61, 66). These
findings are reminiscent of the hypertension evident in indus-
trialized populations consuming high-Na�–low-K� Western
diets and suggest that BP rises because the body places a higher
priority on K� than Na� and volume homeostasis (Table 2,
columns I and II).
The issue of the homeostatic hierarchy of Na� vs. K� in the
distal nephron was directly addressed in a 2011 study in rats by
Frindt et al. (17), who investigated the physiological conse-
quences of Na� depletion with and without accompanying K�
depletion. The results showed that ENaC activity was in-

presented with higher urinary K� and lower plasma K� concentration after an
overnight fast (not shown), leading to the hypothesis that the increased NCC
abundance was secondary to K� depletion, a response that decreases Na�
delivery to ENaC, which drives K� secretion via K� channels such as the renal
outer medullary K� (ROMK) channel. This hypothesis (top) was supported by
data from the study of Vieras et al. (65) of rats fed a diet in which K� was

 creased, as expected, during Na� depletion with normokalemia
and that ENaC activity was unexpectedly reduced during Na�
depletion plus low K� intake, presumably to reduce the driving
force for K� secretion. In the low Na�-low K� intake set, the
abundance of DCT NCC doubled. This coordinated pattern of
NCC and ENaC regulation in response to low K� intake
supports the notion that K� homeostasis takes the higher
priority and that other pathways are called in to manage Na�
and volume (19). Additionally, the results of this low Na�-low
K� feeding experiment provide an explanation for why low-
ering dietary Na� may not lower BP in patients with low
dietary K� intake and why simply raising dietary K� may
lower BP (Table 2, column II vs. column III).
Recently, progress has been made in understanding the renal
sensing of K� status. Interestingly, a key sensor is located in
the DCT (upstream from the location of K� secretion), where
regulation of NCC activation controls Na� delivery to ENaC
and the drive to secrete K�. Specifically, low plasma [K�]
activates a heteromer of K� channels located in the basolateral
membrane of the DCT cells (Kir4.1/5.1, the K� sensor), which
hyperpolarizes the membrane potential and lowers cell Cl�
concentration, which relieves the inhibition of the WNK-
SPAK kinase cascade, leading to NCC phosphorylation
(NCCp) and activation, which reduces Na� delivery to ENaC
downstream (60, 61).
How does the renin-angiotensin system interface with K�
homeostasis in the control of plasma [K�] vs. ECV and BP?
The stimulus to increase NCC during low Na� intake has been
attributed to a direct effect of angiotensin II (ANG II) stimu-
lation in many studies (52). In response to acute ANG II
stimulation, we observed increased NCC trafficking to the
plasma membrane (55) but not acute changes in NCC activat-
ing phosphorylation (33). In contrast, there is agreement across
laboratories that chronic ANG II infusion is associated with
increases in both NCC abundance and activating phosphoryla-
tion (8, 43, 63). Relevant to NCC phosphorylation, ANG II
also directly stimulates ENaC activity acutely (35) and chron-
ically (21, 36), thus increasing the driving force for K�
secretion and excretion. We postulated that K� depletion
during chronic ANG II infusion was the primary stimulus
driving increased NCCp, rather than ANG II per se. Our recent
results support this hypothesis (65): ANG II (vs. control)-
infused male rats presented with ENaC activation (assessed as
cleaved �ENaC) along with the predicted urinary K� loss,
lower plasma [K�], and increased NCCp (Fig. 1). A single
K�-rich meal did not reduce NCCp or increase K� excretion,
suggesting a K�-depleted state in which the ingested K� is
directed to replenish intracellular stores. However, doubling
dietary K� intake during the chronic ANG II infusion normal-
ized plasma [K�] and prevented the increase in NCCp (Fig. 1),
in support of the conclusion that the rise in NCCp during ANG
II infusion is due to the K� loss, which stimulates the DCT K�
sensors, depolarizes the membrane, decreases cell Cl�, and
activates NCCp. Incidentally, the dietary K� supplementation
did not blunt the ANG II hypertension, likely because of the
multiple antinatriuretic effects of ANG II (e.g., ENaC activa-
tion). Nonetheless, coupled to the evidence that a low-K�–
Na�-replete diet can raise BP (66), these findings suggest that
recommendation of a DASH-style diet to prevent K� depletion
and reduce distal tubule NCC-mediated Na� reabsorption
should be considered.
Fig. 2. Raising dietary K� counteracts hypertension in spontaneously hyper-
tensive rats (SHR). A: at baseline, with dietary electrolytes at 0.2% NaCl and
0.5% K�, blood pressure (BP) is 148 mmHg. Raising dietary NaCl to 8%
increases BP to 182 mmHg if K� is kept at 0.5%, but BP does not increase if
K� is also raised to 2% (146 mmHg). [Redrawn from results of Ganguli and
Tobian (18).] B: dietary K� intake, under conditions of normokalemia, inhibits
Na� reabsorption via DCT NCC, which increases Na� delivery downstream to
ENaC, where Na� reabsorption drives increased K� secretion. Net result is
increased excretion of Na� and K�. C: summary of results from a small study
of SHR fed 2% NaCl � 1% KCl or 2% NaCl � 4% KCl from 6 to 13 wk of
age (37). Tail cuff BP [mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean of weekly
measurements from weeks 11–14 after 3 wk of adaptation] was 24 mmHg
lower in SHR fed 4% KCl; overnight urine Na� (UNaV) was marginally
increased by 25%; NCC total abundance, measured by immunoblotting, was
decreased ~15%, and ENaC activation, estimated from abundance of the
cleaved (clvd) �-subunit, was increased ~20%, supporting the model linking
increased K� secretion to decreased Na� reabsorption.

IMPORTANCE OF DIETARY Na�-TO-K� RATIO

 The observation that raising dietary K� can lower BP (even
in the face of high Na� intake) is not new. In 1990, Ganguli
and Tobian (18) demonstrated that the level of dietary K�
determined the degree of salt-sensitive hypertension in spon-
taneously hypertensive rats (SHR). With a ratio of 0.25% NaCl
to 0.5% K�, baseline BP was 146 mmHg in this hypertensive
rat strain. Raising dietary NaCl to 8% increased BP 36 mmHg
when K� was kept at 0.5%, but 8% NaCl did not raise BP
when dietary K� was also increased to 2% (Fig. 2A). Mortality
in these stroke-prone SHR after 14 wk on diets was 90% in the
8% NaCl-0.5% K� group and only 5% in the 8% NaCl-2% K�
group. Remarkably, decreasing NaCl from 8% to 0.24% in 2%
K�-fed SHR lowered BP �10 mmHg. Thus, as verified in the
DASH diet studies in humans, K� lowers BP more in popu-
lations consuming high-Na� diets (5).
We conducted a limited follow-up study, also in SHR fed
elevated NaCl and low or elevated KCl. SHR were fed 2%
NaCl (as in a Western diet) with 1% KCl [equivalent to 0.5%
K� in the study of Ganguli and Tobian (18)] or 4% KCl
between 6 and 14 wk of age (Fig. 2C) (37). BP was blunted by
raising KCl, confirming the findings of Ganguli and Tobian
(18); additionally, overnight urinary Na� was elevated in the
4% KCl-fed group, confirming the natriuretic effect of elevat-
ing K� intake (Fig. 2B). At the molecular level, NCC levels
were lower and activated ENaC levels (assessed as cleaved
�ENaC) were higher in the 4% KCl-fed group, consistent with
adaptations to increase K� excretion (changes were rather
small, as Na� transporters are suppressed by the high Na�
intake). Together, the results summarized in Fig. 2 provide
molecular mechanisms that may account for how raising di-
etary K� lowers BP in the SHR. Basically, the results reinforce
the conclusion that consuming a high-K� diet is similar to
taking a NCC-inhibiting thiazide diuretic, without the side
effects (15).
Muscle also plays an important role in K� adaptation and
homeostasis. Muscle serves as the main intracellular K� res-
ervoir and buffer pool, containing �90% of the body’s K�.
Muscle actively takes up K� during dietary K� excess, medi-
ated by Na�-K�-ATPase activation, and releases K� during
K� deficiency or prolonged fasting; both adaptations are aimed
at maintaining extracellular [K�] in the normal range (11, 70).
Additionally, exercise improves extrarenal K� adaptation, as it
optimizes K� fluxes across muscles not only by increasing
mass but also by increasing Na�-K�-ATPase activity (10, 42).
Thus muscle works in concert with the kidneys to maintain and
optimize K� homeostasis (37a).
Conclusions and Implications
Medical communities, First Lady Michelle Obama, and
common sense tell us to eat more fruits and vegetables and to
get regular exercise to optimize our health. Along with exer-
cise, consuming a surfeit of dietary K� is a good strategy, since
our physiology evolved and was optimized to deal with high-
K�–low-Na� intake, often referred to a Paleolithic diet (29).
How can a society implement these straightforward lifestyle
adjustment recommendations? A commentary by Silver and
Farley (57) on a study of Na� and K� intake and mortality
from NHANES III (69) notes that more than three-fourths of
the NaCl in the US diet is added during food processing and,
thus, is difficult to control or assess. They suggest the follow-
ing feasible and concrete recommendations: 1) promote efforts
to reduce Na� artificially added to food during processing to
reduce mortality, as implemented in England and discussed
above (24), 2) promote public policies to increase dietary
intake of K� from plant-based sources, 3) make fruits and
vegetables available at lower cost and more accessible, as
discussed by Drewnowski et al. (13), 4) develop food-process-
ing technology that retains natural composition of cations, and
5) require manufacturers to display K� content on nutrition
facts panels. Recent advice from the Rogosin Roundtable to
medical doctors, nurses, and nutritionists who treat renal pa-
tients suggests an “ABCD” approach (41): Access to afford-
able, fresh foods; Back to basics; Cooking: You can do it!; and
Deliver information a patient can understand. The specifics
included making nutrition health a priority and giving people
the tools to make healthier food choices; encouraging the best
of technology-based tools for nutrition management; increas-
ing access to fresh foods by activating and working with
community leaders to bring fresh food to the patients, as has
been implemented by Goraya et al. (22); encouraging patients
and their families to enjoy cooking healthy meals together; and
promoting policy changes to increase dietitian-to-patient ratios.
All these feasible suggestions bring with them the promise of
reducing the incidence of hypertension and CVD, as well as
their enormous costs. The challenge now is implementation.
