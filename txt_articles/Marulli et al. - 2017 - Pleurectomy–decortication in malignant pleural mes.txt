Abstract
OBJECTIVES: The potential benefit of surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), especially concerning pleurectomy/decortica-
tion (P/D), is unclear from the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome after multimodality treatment of MPM involv-
ing different types of P/D and to analyse the prognostic factors.
METHODS: We reviewed 314 patients affected by MPM who were operated on in 11 Italian centres from 1 January 2007 to 11 October
2014.
RESULTS: The characteristics of the population were male/female ratio: 3.7/1, and median age at operation was 67.8 years. The epithelioid
histotype was observed in 79.9% of patients; neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 57% of patients and Stage III disease was found fol-
lowing a pathological analysis in 62.3% of cases. A total of 162 (51.6%) patients underwent extended P/D (EP/D); 115 (36.6%) patients had
P/D and 37 (11.8%) received only a partial pleurectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered in 39.2% of patients. Median overall survival
time after surgery was 23.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 19.6–29.1] months. On multivariable (Cox) analysis, pathological Stage III–IV
[P = 0.004, hazard ratio (HR):1.34; 95% CI: 1.09–1.64], EP/D and P/D (P = 0.006, HR for EP/D: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.29–0.74; HR for P/D: 0.52; 95%
CI: 0.31–0.87), left-sided disease (P = 0.01, HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.09–2.12) and pathological status T4 (P = 0.0003, HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.14–1.66)
were found to be independent significant predictors of overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether the P/D is extended or not, it shows similarly good outcomes in terms of early results and survival rate. In con-
trast, a partial pleurectomy, which leaves gross tumour behind, has no impact on survival.

 INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumour
with poor prognosis even when treated. Therefore, finding an ef-
fective treatment has been a challenge for the last 30 years [1].
The available, albeit limited, data on the treatment of patients
with MPM suggest that multimodality therapy leads to better re-
sults compared with other strategies. Surgical treatment options
for MPM include extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and pleur-
ectomy/decortication (P/D), both of which can be incorporated
into multimodality regimens involving neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy [2].
Because of the diffuse growth pattern and the lack of surgical
margins, microscopic complete resection is theoretically impos-
sible. Thus, a macroscopic complete resection (MCR) is the most
one can expect to achieve with surgical resection, even though
the optimal cytoreductive procedure is still controversial [3, 4].
EPP is a well-codified operation, and for many years, it was con-
sidered the best surgical option to achieve MCR and to obtain a
survival advantage [3]. The definition of P/D, on the other hand,
has varied according to the surgical technique, therapeutic intent
and clinical indications [5, 6].
P/D was initially proposed as a valid cytoreductive surgical al-
ternative to EPP for patients who were unwilling to undergo EPP
or who did meet the indications for EPP [7–9]. Recently, 2 meta-
analyses comparing the 2 surgical procedures suggested signifi-
cantly lower perioperative mortality and morbidity rates and a
trend towards longer survival for patients who had P/D in com-
parison with EPP [10, 11].
In
2011,
the
consensus
report
by
the
International
Mesothelioma Interest Group and the International Association
for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) recommended that the sur-
gical procedures be classified into 3 well-defined categories: (i)
EP/D, (ii) P/D and (iii) partial pleurectomy [12]. The potential
benefits of surgery are still unclear from the literature, especially
concerning P/D, and few authors have evaluated the clinical im-
pact and outcome of patients who have had different types of
P/D. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome after mul-
timodality treatment of MPM involving different types of P/D
and to analyse the prognostic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from 314 patients affected by histologically proven MPM
and operated on between 1 January 1 2007 and 11 October
2014 were prospectively collected from 11 Italian centres and
reviewed.
Demographics and clinical preoperative, operative and postop-
erative data were considered for statistical analysis. Preoperative
studies included total body computed tomography (CT) scans
and/or positron emission tomography CT scans, electrocardio-
grams, echocardiograms and spirometry with blood gas analysis.
Tumour,
node
and
metastasis
(TNM)
and
International
Mesothelioma Interest Group staging systems were used to define
the extent of the disease.
Patients underwent the multimodality approach based on a
single-centre protocol comprising induction chemotherapy and/
or adjuvant treatment with surgical resection.
All patients had a pleurectomy through a posterolateral thora-
cotomy. All centres reviewed the operative charts so they could
define the surgical procedures according to the International
Mesothelioma Interest Group/International Association for the
Study of Lung Cancer classification [12] system, which provides 3
categories depending on the surgical technique: (i) extended P/D
(EP/D): parietal and visceral pleurectomy to remove all gross
tumour, with resection of the diaphragm and/or pericardium; (ii)
P/D: parietal and visceral pleurectomy to remove all gross
tumour, without resection of the diaphragm or pericardium; and
(iii) partial pleurectomy: partial removal of parietal and/or vis-
ceral pleura for diagnostic or palliative purposes, leaving gross
tumour behind.
The choice of EP/D versus P/D was determined by the macro-
scopic absence/presence of diaphragmatic and pericardial in-
volvement by the disease: In both procedures, an MCR was the
goal.
Operative complications were separated into major (acute re-
spiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, bronchopleural fistula,
reintubation, placement of tracheostomy, pulmonary embolus,
empyema, sepsis, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia
requiring treatment, return to operating room, acute renal failure,
chylothorax, deep venous thrombosis and others) and minor
complications (atrial arrhythmia requiring treatment, anaemia,
urinary tract infection, delirium, prolonged air leaks and others)
for the purpose of analysis. Major complications were considered
those that required a second surgical look or that were associ-
ated with the risk of death or a significantly prolonged hospital
stay due to the need for intensive medical support.
For induction and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, a platinum-
based regimen with gemcitabine or pemetrexed was used for 3
to 4 cycles. Adjuvant radiotherapy was not standardized and var-
ied from radiation limited to the surgical scars or a boost to the
macroscopic residual tumour (20–30 Gy) to standard radiation
treatment, helical tomotherapy or intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (dose range 40–50 Gy).
Patients were followed up with clinical checks, imaging studies
(CT scan and/or positron emission tomography CT scan) and a
phone interview every 4 months for the first year and then every
6 months for the following years. Survival was calculated from
the date of surgery to the date of last follow-up or death. The fol-
lowing parameters were considered and evaluated in the statis-
tical analysis:
age, gender, side of the disease, histology,
preoperative treatments, type of surgical intervention, postopera-
tive treatments, T and N status and pathological stage.
Statistical analysis
In the statistical description, data are expressed as absolute num-
bers, percentages and mean or median values. The association
between qualitative variables was verified by means of the v2 test
or the Fisher test, as appropriate. The Kaplan–Meier method was
used to model survival during follow-up to estimate the median
survival time and the 95% confidence interval (CI) and to com-
pare survival curves with the log-rank test. Simple Cox propor-
tional hazard regression was used to calculate the unadjusted
hazard ratio (HR) for prognostic factors. A forward stepwise Cox
regression model, with entry and stay of variables showing a sig-
nificance level of at least 0.1, was applied to obtain adjusted HRs.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical soft-
ware release 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) with the signifi-
cance level set at P < 0.05.

 RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics as a whole population and divided by the
type of surgical intervention are summarized in Table 1. One
hundred sixty-two (51.6%) patients had EP/D; 115 (36.6%) pa-
tients underwent P/D; and 37(11.8%) received only a partial
pleurectomy. Thirty- and 90-day mortality rates were 2.2% (n = 7)
and 3.5% (n = 11), respectively. The 30-day mortality rates for EP/
D, P/D and partial pleurectomy were not significantly different
(2.5% vs 1.7% vs 2.7%, respectively; P = 0.88 by the Fisher’s exact
test); a similar result was observed regarding the 90-day mortality
rates (3.1% vs 3.5% vs 5.4%, respectively; P = 0.75 by the Fisher’s
exact test). Causes of perioperative (30-day) death were massive
pulmonary embolism (n = 2), bleeding (n = 1), myocardial infarc-
tion (n = 1), stroke (n = 1), ventricular arrhythmia (n = 1) and un-
known (n = 1). The overall major morbidity rate was 15.9%
(n = 50), with a significantly (P < 0.001) higher rate for EP/D
(17.9%) and P/D (16.5%) compared with partial pleurectomy
(5.4%); the type and distribution of major complications based
on the different surgical approaches are reported in Table 2. A
total of 139 minor complications (prolonged air leaks [n = 51],
anaemia requiring transfusions or not [n = 43], atrial fibrillation
[n = 30] and other [n = 15]) were observed in 115 (36.6%) patients.
After the operation, 123 (39.2%) patients were submitted to
adjuvant radiotherapy with different treatment modalities (con-
ventional radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy
and helical tomotherapy); 102 (32.5%) had radiotherapy limited
to the surgical scars or to a boost to macroscopic residual disease
and 89 (28.3%) did not receive any radiation treatment. A
platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapeutic regime was adminis-
tered to 75 (23.9%) patients.
At the end of the follow-up (median 15.5 months, range 1–118
months) period, 142 (45.2%) patients were alive; 157 (50%) had
died; and 15(4.8%) were lost after a median time of initial clinical
observation of 5 (range 1–13) months (Table 2).
The median overall survival after the operation was 23.0 (95%
CI: 19.6–29.1) months, with 3-and 5-year survival rates of 37.5%
and 21%, respectively (Fig. 1). The results of the statistical analysis
of prognostic factors are reported in Table 3. On univariable ana-

DISCUSSION
The most effective treatment for MPM is controversial: It often
involves a coordinated multimodality approach that incorporates
surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy) and radiation [2].
Although the role and effectiveness of surgery in the treatment of
MPM are still unclear, many surgeons think that the goal of every
operation is to leave the patient in a state of no evidence of dis-
ease by accomplishing an MCR with the goal to improve long-
term outcome in these patients [13]. The best way to accomplish
this goal is, however, controversial, because a surgical standard
of care for patients with MPM has not been established. Two sur-
gical approaches are used: The lung-sacrificing operation (EPP) is
highly standardized and the lung-sparing operation (P/D) is
wildly variable with respect to extent (completeness of resection)
but also with nomenclature [5]. The first report of pleurectomy in
the treatment of MPM was by Martini et al. [6] in 1975, who
described outcomes of parietal pleurectomy followed by external
radiation and systemic chemotherapy in 14 patients: the median
survival was 16 months. A year later, this series was expanded to
include 33 patients with MPM who had a median survival of 21
months [14]. Since then, a number of non-randomized studies
have demonstrated the feasibility and the safety of P/D for MPM
with several different multimodality schemes involving induction
and adjuvant treatments [5, 15, 16]. A potential disadvantage of
P/D is the theoretically less cytoreductive capacity compared
with EPP; in particular, the effectiveness and radicality of P/D in
patients with advanced MPM is one of the main controversial
points. Friedberg et al. [17] reported an MCR rate of 97% and a
median survival of 21 months in their series of radical pleurec-
tomy with intraoperative photodynamic therapy for advanced
MPM. On the basis of their results, they theorized that MCR
could be achieved with radical pleurectomy in all patients with
MPM in whom MCR could be achieved with EPP. A similar find-
ing was reported by Nakas et al. [18] in locally advanced (T3–4)
non-sarcomatoid MPM. Bolukbas et al. [19], on the other hand,

 reported in patients with Stage III MPM treated with radical
pleurectomy a lower MCR rate (61.9%) and a relatively high sur-
gical mortality rate (4.8%), with a median survival of 21 months,
comparable with the results from previous studies. The greatest
recognized advantage of P/D is the lower rates of postoperative
morbidity and mortality compared with EPP. Moreover, the pres-
ervation of the ipsilateral lung parenchyma has the potential to
enhance quality of life and may allow greater tolerance of more
aggressive adjuvant treatments, both initially and at the time of
recurrence.
Two recent meta-analyses of a large number of studies com-
paring P/D to EPP suggest that P/D, in the context of multimo-
dality therapy, is associated with a 2.5-fold lower short-term
mortality rate (perioperatively and within 30 days), a greater than
50% reduction in postoperative morbidity, with an equivalent, if
not greater, median overall survival [10, 11]. When analysing
these reviews, however, one should take into account the biases
that go into selecting a patient for one or the other procedure,
the retrospective nature of most of the studies, the imbalanced
patient characteristics and the varying adjuvant treatments used.
In a recent editorial, Raja Flores [20] pointed out that attention to
the recent general shift in surgery for MPM from EPP to P/D after
a large comparative multicentre study by experienced mesotheli-
oma surgeons failed to demonstrate significant survival differ-
ences between the 2 procedures [9]. He commented that ‘the
data suggest that the primary goal of surgery should not just be
to obtain an MCR (R1) at the expense of pneumonectomy. More
realistic goals should include the removal of as much tumor as
possible while avoiding pneumonectomy, lung re-expansion,
prevention of fluid reaccumulation, while minimizing morbidity
and mortality. On the basis of the currently available data the
equation tips in favor of P/D rather than EPP’. Many MPM cen-
tres in Europe and some in North America and Japan are cur-
rently performing P/D with curative intent [9, 21, 22]; moreover,

 a MARS-II trial is currently underway to compare P/D versus best
medical therapy [23].
If
one
looks
at
the
current
literature,
one
notes
that
pleurectomy-related procedures in various studies differ between
institutions in terms of therapeutic intent, surgical technique and
definition [5, 9–11, 18]. To date, no prospective study has eval-
uated the operative results in terms of the extent of the pleurec-
tomy. A recent systematic review by Cao et al. [5] assessed the
outcome of 1916 patients with MPM by analysing 34 studies and
stratifying the surgical approach by the extent of the pleurec-
tomy. Although detailed statistical analyses were not possible due
to a lack of data, median overall and disease-free survival out-
comes appeared to be longer in patients who had EP/D com-
pared with those who had P/D and partial pleurectomy (the
reported middle 2 quartile survival ranges were 15–25 months
for EP/D, 12–18 months for P/D and 9–13 months for partial
pleurectomy). The possible explanation may be related to the
increased ability to achieve MCR by removing the diaphragm
and pericardium when these areas are affected by tumours.
Additionally, the results of this review suggested a similar peri-
operative mortality outcome between different P/D techniques,
but a trend towards higher morbidity and length of hospitaliza-
tion for patients who underwent EP/D was shown.
The results of our series are slightly different because the short-
and long-term outcomes were similar between EP/D and P/D.
Indeed, patients receiving EP/D or P/D (with no difference be-
tween these 2 procedures: log-rank test P = 0.75) had a significant
survival advantage compared with those who had a partial pleur-
ectomy. In our study, we observed a perioperative mortality rate
of 2.2%, which was slightly lower than the average 4% (range, 0–
25%) reported in the review of Teh et al. [24], who analysed the
data of 1270 patients undergoing P/D for MPM from 26 series.
No differences in perioperative mortality rates between the 3
procedures were observed in our series, but a significantly higher
rate of major complications was associated with EP/D and P/D
compared with partial pleurectomy. The poor survival results
observed in the group of patients receiving partial pleurectomy
raise the question as to the opportunity and ability to perform
this type of operation. Also, the MesoVATS trial found no benefit
for minimally invasive partial cytoreduction compared with pleu-
rodesis [25]. These authors reported a 50–60% 1-year overall sur-
vival rate in both groups (median survival, 13 months), with
worse survival in higher risk patients undergoing thoracoscopic
partial pleurectomy. The palliative role of partial pleurectomy is
debatable and not clearly demonstrated in the literature in terms
of the improvement of quality of life, effectiveness for pain and
control or reduction of pleural effusion.
Our study confirmed that the selection criteria are crucial in
MPM patients: As in the majority of published series [2, 3, 9, 13,
26], advanced T status and advanced pathological stage were sig-
nificant predictors of worse survival. Non-epithelial histology,
male gender and nodal involvement were also associated with a
poor outcome.
We also found that the side on which the tumour occurs was a
predictor of prognosis, with the right-sided operation associated
with a significantly prolonged survival. The reasons are unclear.
We may hypothesize that the performance of cytoreduction on
the right side, where the pleural cavity is larger than on the left,
could be better, just as the potential for effective adjuvant radio-
therapy is lower on the left side due to the presence of the heart.

 Limitations
This study has the following limitations:
1. Its retrospective design, its uncontrolled nature and the asso-
ciated selection and information biases.
2. The classification of the type of operation based on the re-
view of the description of operative charts, which prevented
us from collecting reliable data about the rate of MCR.
3. The survival calculation made from the day of surgery and
not from the day of diagnosis or the beginning of multimo-
dality treatment. Some of our patients, particularly those who
had received chemotherapy before surgery, had been diag-
nosed and received treatments several months before the
surgical intervention. If these factors are taken into consider-
ation, the actual median survival for the patients from diag-
nosis will be greater than what we report in this study.
4. The heterogeneity among multimodality treatments, with
some centres preferring induction chemotherapy and others
favouring adjuvant chemotherapy.
5. The data collected from a multi-institutional (11 Italian
centres) database. Using data from such widely scattered
sources is a limitation, but, in our opinion, it is also one of
the strengths of this study, because it covers a broad national
experience that include centres with different surgical experi-
ences and different volumes of activity. For this reason, the
reported results are ‘reproducible’.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, pleurectomy–decortication is a valid operative op-
tion in MPM leading to good survival rates in selected patients,
with an acceptable operative mortality rate. Partial pleurectomy,
advanced pathological stage and T status and left-sided disease
are associated with a poor prognosis. In our experience, EP/D
and P/D showed similar outcomes; a partial pleurectomy leaving
gross tumour behind had no impact on survival and should be
carefully considered only in those cases in which a palliative role
may be clearly desired.
Conflict of interest: none declared.
