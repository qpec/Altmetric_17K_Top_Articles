Background: Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has historically 
been a sporadic disease, causing occasional small 
outbreaks of generally mild infection. In recent years, 
there has been evidence of an increase in EV-D68 infec-
tions globally. Large outbreaks of EV-D68, with thou-
sands of cases, occurred in the United States, Canada 
and Europe in 2014. The outbreaks were associated 
temporally and geographically with an increase in clus-
ters of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Aims: We aimed to 
evaluate a causal association between EV-D68 and 
AFM.  Methods: Using data from the published and 
grey literature, we applied the Bradford Hill criteria, 
a set of nine principles applied to examine causality, 
to evaluate the relationship between EV-D68 and AFM. 
Based on available evidence, we defined the Bradford 
Hill Criteria as being not met, or met minimally, par-
tially or fully.  Results: Available evidence applied to 
EV-D68 and AFM showed that six of the Bradford Hill 
criteria were fully met and two were partially met. The 
criterion of biological gradient was minimally met. The 
incidence of EV-D68 infections is increasing world-
wide. Phylogenetic epidemiology showed diversifica-
tion from the original Fermon and Rhyne strains since 
the year 2000, with evolution of a genetically distinct 
outbreak strain, clade B1. Clade B1, but not older 
strains, is associated with AFM and is neuropathic in 
animal models.  Conclusion: While more research is 
needed on dose–response relationship, application of 
the Bradford Hill criteria supported a causal relation-
ship between EV-D68 and AFM.
Background 
Large outbreaks of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), affecting 
at least 2,287 people, occurred in multiple countries 
in 2014. The first outbreak was detected in the United 
States (US), followed by Canada, Europe and Asia. At 
the same time, an increase in clusters of acute flac-
cid myelitis (AFM) occurred in the same geographical 
areas, with the highest number of cases (n = 120) in the 
US [1-3]. Smaller numbers of AFM cases (at least six) 
associated with EV-D68 infection were reported from 
Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom (UK) [1-3]. This raised the question 
of causal association between EV-D68 and AFM [1-3].
The enterovirus (EV) genus comprises 12 distinct spe-
cies [4], including poliovirus. EV-D68 belongs, with 
other non-polio EVs, to the group EV D [5,6]. AFM is 
defined as ‘acute flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs 
or acute onset of bulbar paralysis’ and if caused by 
poliovirus, is referred to as poliomyelitis or polio [7]. 
In addition to poliovirus as the leading cause of AFM 
[8,9], other EVs such as EV-A71 are also a recognised 
cause of AFM [10,11]. Following the 2014 epidemic, 
EV-D68 has emerged as another possible cause of AFM 
[12].
Infection with EV-D68 historically caused mild respira-
tory symptoms such as rhinorrhoea, muscle aches 
and cough. Recently however, it has been associated 
with severe respiratory symptoms, hospitalisation and 
death [13]. Children are at higher risk of symptomatic 
infection than adults [2]. Transmission occurs from 
person to person, and the virus is found in respiratory 
secretions, blood and infrequently in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) [13,14].
EV-D68 was first identified in 1962 and has since been 
found sporadically and in small clusters, with only 699 
confirmed cases worldwide until 2013 [15,16]. From 
2008 to 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) reported the identification of six 
 2
www.eurosurveillance.org
clusters of respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 
in Asia, Europe and the US, with the number of con-
firmed cases ranging from five to 28 [2]. From 2009 to 
2013, a total of 79 cases were reported in the US, with 
generally mild symptoms [1], followed by 1,153 cases in 
2014 [13]. In addition, an outbreak involving 25 people 
occurred in June 2016 in the Netherlands [17].
The global prevalence of EV-D68 as a cause of illness 
appears to be low. Studies have reported the propor-
tion of respiratory specimens positive for EV-D68 rang-
ing from 0.2 to 3.4% [18-21]. A study conducted from 
2011 to 2015 in China found that 12 of 7,945 (0.2%) 
specimens were positive for EV-D68 [21]. In Hong 
Kong an investigation in children showed that 24 of 
1,461 (1.6%) of respiratory samples were positive 
for EV-D68 [19]. In Germany, where respiratory sam-
ples were collected from patients in three hospitals 
between January 2013 and December 2014 [18], 39 of 
14,838 (0.3%) were positive for EV-D68 [18]. Data from 
the French enterovirus surveillance network showed 
that from July to December 2014, 212 of 6,229 (3.4%) 
samples were positive for EV-D68 [20]. However, preva-
lence may be affected by geographical location, type of 
test conducted and testing practices (such as changes 
in likelihood of testing for EV-D68 during an epidemic, 
owing to increased awareness among clinicians of the 
disease and the availability of tests).
The first detected large-scale outbreak of EV-D68 was 
reported in the US and Canada in 2014 [3,22,23] and 
was associated with severe respiratory symptoms [13]. 
The outbreak occurred from August 2014 to January 
2015 (autumn/winter), with a total of 1,153 cases in 49 
US states [13]. The disease severity was much higher 
than in previous outbreaks, with higher numbers of 
people experiencing severe respiratory disease. AFM 
was diagnosed in 10.4% (120/1,153) of cases in the US 
and five cases of neurological illness were associated 
with EV-D68 in Canada [11,22,24,25].
Outbreaks were also reported in Europe. Investigation 
into an increase in the number of children with severe 
respiratory disease in September 2014 in a hospi-
tal in Norway found that 33 of 303 (10.9%) paediatric 
samples were positive for EV-D68 [26]. The hospital 
reported two cases of severe AFM associated with 
EV-D68 infection [27]. A sporadic case of AFM following 
EV-D68 infection was also reported in France [28] and 
the UK in 2014 [29].
Phylogenetic analysis of a section of the EV-D68 
genome (the VP1 gene) has identified four distinct 
clades of EV-D68, named A, B, C and D [15,30]. Clade B 
can be further divided into B1, B2 and B3 [31]. Strains 
isolated in the US from the 2014 outbreak belonged 
mostly to clade B [30], in particular B1 [12].
Despite the growing concern following the 2014 out-
break and the association with AFM in several coun-
tries, information regarding causation between EV-D68 
and AFM is still limited. We aimed to evaluate evidence 
of a causal relationship between EV-D68 and AFM 
using the Bradford Hill criteria.
Methods
A review of the literature was conducted in April 2017 
using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Systematic search terms 
used were ‘enterovirus 68’ OR ‘EV-D68’ or ‘EV68’ 
AND ‘acute flaccid myelitis’ OR ‘acute flaccid paraly-
sis’. The search was restricted from 1980 to present. 
A search of the grey literature using Google was also 
conducted using the same search terms. All bibliogra-
phies of included studies were reviewed. Studies were 
included if they investigated an association between 
AFM and EVs, described a case series of EV-D68 and 
AFM or investigated the biology of EV-D68. Studies 
were excluded if they investigated EVs in general, i.e. 
not specifically EV-D68 or an association with AFM. 
The Bradford Hill criteria were applied to the evidence.
Bradford Hill criteria
The Bradford Hill criteria are a set of nine criteria 
applied to examine causality between an exposure and 
a disease (Table 1) [32].
Application of the criteria for EV-D68 and 
AFM
The literature was reviewed to gather evidence relevant 
to each of the Bradford Hill criteria. Key findings from

each identified study were assessed against the rele-
vant criteria. Each criterion was qualitatively assigned 
one of four categories based on the amount of informa-
tion available, sample size in the studies and the cer-
tainty of the findings:
The fit of the evidence to the criteria was scored as fol-
lows (Table 2):
Given the possible subjectivity in assigning scores, we 
present a summary of available evidence and justifica-
tion to support the score for each criterion.
Results 
The results from the literature review are described 
below in the Figure.
The evaluation of the available evidence against the 
Bradford Hill criteria is summarised in Table 3 and 
described in more detail below to justify the final 
scoring.
Strength
As at April 2017, there have been two epidemiological 
studies investigating the causation between EV-D68 
infection and cases of AFM. Both were retrospective 
case–control studies following the 2014 outbreak 
in the US. The first was conducted in Colorado from 
3 August to 18 October 2014. The study compared 
AFM cases with two control groups. Eleven cases of 
AFM were identified, of whom four tested positive for 
EV-D68. Multivariate analysis showed that those with 
AFM had higher odds of EV-D68 infection than both 
control groups (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 10.3; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.8–64.8 and OR = 4.5; 95% 
CI: 1.0–21.2) [33]. The second study was conducted in 
Colorado and California in patients with AFM between 
January 2012 and October 2014 as well as cases 
identified from a state-wide surveillance system in the 
same period [12]. EV-D68 was detected in nasopharyn-
geal or oropharyngeal samples in 12 of 25 patients 
with AFM. Among the 11 cases with AFM from two 
linked clusters during the 2014 outbreak, four tested 
positive for EV-D68. None of the total 25 AFM patients 
tested positive for the virus in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF). However, the association was strengthened as 
no other infections were identified in CSF to explain 
the AFM. The findings from this study are limited by the 
small sample size.
A summary of these two studies is shown in Table 
4 [12,33]. Given that only two studies calculated odds 
ratios for the association, even though convincing, we 
judged, based on the small number of available stud-
ies, that the criterion of strength was partially met.
Consistency
The association between EV-D68 and AFM is generally 
consistent, with reports across at least nine countries 
(Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US) and different out-
breaks. An increase in cases of both EV-D68 and AFM 
was observed in the 2014 outbreak across the US [11] 
and Canada [12]. A total of 120 cases of AFM were 
reported during this time [24,25,34]. A cluster of nine 
acute neurological illness cases was initially identi-
fied in Colorado in September 2014, of whom four were 
found to be positive for EV-D68 [35]. A second study 
looked at this cluster and identified 12 children with 
AFM, of whom 11 were tested for EV-D68; five of those 
11 were positive for EV-D68 [36]. However, the strength 
of the above associations cannot be quantified with-
out control data. Reports from CDC in November 2014 
identified 88 cases of AFM; among the 88 cases of 
AFM, 41 upper respiratory tract specimens were tested, 
Table 1
Bradford Hill criteria of causality
Criterion
Description
Strength
Whether those with the exposure are at a higher risk of developing disease and if so, how much more risk? This criterion 
suggests that a larger association increases the likelihood of causality.
Consistency
The credibility of findings increases with repetition of findings, including consistency of study findings across different 
populations and geographical locations.
Specificity
Causality is more likely if the exposure causes only one specific disease or syndrome, or if a specific location or 
population are being affected.
Temporality
This criterion requires that the exposure must occur before the disease, and not after a latency period that is too long. 
This criterion must always be fulfilled for causality to be concluded.
Biological 
gradient
The argument for causality is stronger in the presence of a dose–response relationship, where higher or longer exposure 
leads to an increased risk of disease.
Plausibility
A conceivable mechanism for causation between disease and exposure should exist for there to be a causal relationship.
Coherence
The current association should not contradict any previous knowledge available about the disease and/or exposure.
Experiment
This criterion can involve scientific experiments and addresses the association of exposure with disease. However, 
‘experiment’ relates to the decrease in disease risk when the exposure is removed and often involves animal models.
Analogy
This criterion uses previous evidence of an association between a similar exposure and disease outcome to strengthen 
the current argument for causation.

eight of which were positive for EV-D68. Of the 19 sam-
ples taken less than 14 days following symptom onset, 
seven tested positive for EV-D68 [37]. US national sur-
veillance following the 2014 outbreak found 120 cases 
of AFM, with one CSF specimen positive and 11 of 56 
upper respiratory specimens positive for EV-D68 [25]. 
A summary of these outbreaks is described in Table 4.
In addition, between 2012 and 2014, 23 cases of AFP 
were identified in California of whom two tested posi-
tive for EV-D68 [38]. Other cases of AFM have been 
identified in people infected with EV-D68: two in 
Norway [27], one in France [28] and one in the UK [29]. 
A study in Western Australia investigating the epidemi-
ology of EV-D68 found three cases who developed AFM 
[39]. In addition, one case of AFM was identified in a 
cluster of 25 EV-D68 cases in the Netherlands between 
June and July 2016 [17].
There have also been a number of case series describ-
ing AFM and EV-D68. In a retrospective US-wide study 
investigating patients diagnosed with AFM during the 
2014 outbreak, 11 of 56 respiratory specimens were 
EV-D68-positive. One of 55 CSF specimens was posi-
tive for EV-D68, however all stool/rectal swabs (n = 54) 
were negative. Eight of 17 cases tested within less 
than 7 days of symptom onset were positive for EV-D68. 
The low proportion of positive specimens could also 
be related to a delay of days between symptom onset 
and sampling [25]. A case series investigating AFM in 
California (June 2012 and July 2015) found 9 of 45 AFM 
cases cases infected with EV-D68 [37]. A second case 
series in California, from 2012 and 2014, identified 23 
cases of AFP of whom two tested positive for EV-D68 
[38]. A cluster of three cases of AFM were identified in 
2014 in Alberta, Canada, of whom two tested positive 
for EV-D68 [40]. However, while these descriptive data 
are suggestive of a causal association, they are limited 
by being a small case series.
Specificity
Specificity in The Bradford Hill criteria can refer either 
to one specific exposure causing one disease or more 
broadly to the argument for causation being strength-
ened if a disease is affecting one specific population 
group with a similar exposure. AFM can be caused 
by a range of exposures and is therefore not specific 
to EV-D68. However, the simultaneous occurrence of 
EV-D68 and AFM does appear to affect a specific popu-
lation, namely children: the majority of participants in a 
retrospective cohort study of patients of any age in the 
US were children diagnosed with AFM [12], while a clus-
ter of nine cases identified in Colorado in September 
2014 consisted only of people aged less than 18 years 
[35]. In a cluster of three cases reported in Alberta, 
Canada, all cases were in children aged from 5 to 15 
years who had underlying respiratory conditions [40]. 
Other reports suggest an association between AFM 
and non-polio EVs which specifically affects immuno-
competent children in North America [35,38].
The available evidence suggested that the criterion of 
specificity was partially met.
Temporality
There is a strong temporal relationship between EV-D68 
and AFM. In the 2014 US outbreak the number of 
EV-D68 cases increased at the same time as polio-like 
illness in children. In addition, the outbreak of EV-D68 
subsided around the same time as the cases of AFM, 
with cases of both decreasing in October 2014 [25]. As 
mentioned previously, Sejvar et al. detected EV-D68 in 
eight of 17 respiratory specimens from patients with 
AFM collected no more than 7 days from onset of limb 
weakness [25].
The available evidence suggested a clear temporal 
relationship, with AFM following outbreaks of EV-D68 
in time; the criterion of temporality was met.
Biological gradient
There is some evidence for biological gradient. This 
was shown in suckling mice which were inoculated 
with four different strains of EV-D68 and then observed 
for a 2-week period [41]. The muscle and brain tissues 
of the mice were harvested and passaged to new mice. 
Limb tremors and weakness were observed after the 
Rhyne strain of the virus was passaged twice. Once the 
virus was passaged three times, the mice infected with 
the passaged strain developed paralysis and died [41].
There has been some investigation into animal models 
for EV-A71 infection using non-human primates: neuro-
logical symptoms in cynomolgus monkeys with EV-A71 
infection were similar to those seen in humans [42]. 
Infection of EV-A71 in mouse models proved ineffec-
tive, owing to an incompatible murine scavenger recep-
tor class B2 (SCARB2) receptor protein used for virus 
binding in humans. To circumvent this issue, Victorio et 
al. [43] developed a mouse-adapted EV-A71 strain. This 
strain induced clinical signs including paralysis and 
acute encephalomyelitis in 1-week-old BALB/c mice. 
Although this has helped increase the understanding 
of EV-A71 infection, an ideal animal model that can be 
infected with clinical EV-A71 strain has not yet been 
identified [44].
This criterion could be investigated further in animal 
models, using information on viral load where avail-
able, comparing EV-D68 viral load in patients with

AFM to viral load in patients with mild EV-D68 infec-
tion. A study in 2016 concluded that, similar to rhino-
virus infections, higher EV-D68 viral load may indicate 
more symptomatic disease [17]. Studies on viral load 
of EV other than EV-D68 in CSF detected an average 
of 10,000 to 100,000 copies/mL in adults and chil-
dren [45,46]. Higher viral load was associated with 
increased vertigo and paraesthesia and increased leu-
kocytes and proteins in the blood but not with fever 
and headache [46]. Certain EV genotypes including E30 
and Coxsackie virus B (CVB 4 and 5) were also asso-
ciated with increased viral loads [46]. A mouse model 
showed that multiple clades of EV-D68 were neuroviru-
lent and caused paralysis, but the study did not spe-
cifically examine the dose–response relationship [47].
The available evidence from studies of other EVs and 
some data on EV-D68 was suggestive of a biological 
gradient, but because studies designed to address 
specifically a dose–response relationship were lacking 
the criterion of biological gradient was minimally met.
Plausibility
It is biologically plausible that EV-D68 can lead to 
AFM. EVs are associated with neurological complica-
tions, most notably EV-A71, which has been linked to 
severe neurological complications including AFM and 
encephalomyelitis during hand foot and mouth disease 
(HFMD) outbreaks [48]. While EV-A71 has been shown 
to utilise many different receptors for facilitated cell 
entry, the scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2) pro-
tein has been most widely implicated in facilitating 
EV-A71 neuropathies [49]. SCARB2 is widely expressed 
throughout the human body, including on neurons of 
the CNS [50]. Furthermore, EV-A71 inoculation in a 
SCARB2-transgenic mouse induced encephalomyelitis 
clinically analogous to that observed in humans [51]. In 
contrast, CV-A16, which can similarly bind to SCARB2 
for entry into cells, is not a neurotropic virus [49]. This 
suggests either that EV-A71 uses an alternative recep-
tor for neurovirulence or that other unknown factors 
may inhibit entry of CV-A16, but not EV-A71, into neu-
rons [50].
While it is known that D68 binds to cells in the respira-
tory tract via sialic acid receptors, the molecular basis 
its neurotropic pathway has yet to be established 
[52,53]. Like for EV-A71, the neurotropic pathway and 
subsequent neuropathies of EV-D68 may be an infre-
quent diversion from the normal replication cycle in the 
respiratory mucosa. There is evidence that EV-D68 is 
capable of infecting nerve cells, with one study show-
ing virus detected in the CSF of a young adult with AFM 
in 2005 [14]. In 2008, EV-D68 was detected during 
autopsy in the brain and CSF of a 5-year-old boy with 
fulminant encephalitis [54]. In a 2015 study, the virus 
was detected in CSF from a 25 year-old man [39]. A ret-
rospective study of the 2014 outbreak in the US also 
found a CSF specimen positive for EV-D68 in a patient 
with AFM [25]. However, despite these examples, most 
cases of AFM associated with EV-D68 have been nega-
tive for the virus in CSF. Both poliovirus and EV-A71 are 
rarely detected in the CSF, even among cases with AFM 
[55,56]. Poliomyelitis is typically confirmed by detection 
of virus in the stool, while EV-A71 is usually detected 
in the respiratory tract [25]. For this reason, the lack 
of EV-D68 in the CSF of AFM cases does not weaken 
plausibility. A mouse study showed that EV-D68 has 
tropism for spinal cord motor neurons and does not 
replicate efficiently in brain or other tissues [47]. The 
clinical syndrome in mice with EV-D68-induced paraly-
sis shows a lower motor neuron pattern, with the upper 
limbs more affected and, corresponding to pathologi-
cal findings, no cerebral or sensory involvement. This 
is consistent with AFM and supports EV-D68 causing 
AFM in humans.
The available evidence on EV-D68 and published 
knowledge about EVs in general, suggested that the 
criterion of plausibility was met.
Coherence
The criterion for coherence was met because the cur-
rent hypothesis that there is an association between 
EV-D68 and AFM did not contradict any prior knowl-
edge about EV-D68. EVs have been shown to affect 
the nervous system and can cause other neurological 
complications [10,57,58]. Specifically, EV-A71 has been 
associated with severe neurological complications 
including AFM and encephalomyelitis during outbreaks 
of HFMD [48]. The available evidence suggested that 
this criterion was met.
Experiment
There is some experimental evidence regarding the 
pathogenesis of EV-D68, but this is not specific to 
AFM. As mentioned in the section on biological gra-
dient above, an experiment in mice showed that one 
strain produced weakness, limb tremors, paralysis and 
death, demonstrating neurovirulence of EV-D68 [41].
Recent studies showed genetic differences between 
EV-D68 strains from China, where outbreaks with 
milder disease occurred in 2015 and 2016, and the 
EV-D68 strains from the more severe US 2014 outbreak

[59]. In addition, genetic analysis of EV-D68 strains 
from the US 2014 outbreak demonstrated that most 
strains belonged to clade B which is associated with 
severe disease and had not been detected in the US 
before the outbreak [30]. Analysis of EV-D68 strains 
globally indicated increasing genetic diversity and the 
evolution of clade B1 since 2000 [47].
A mouse study published in 2017 showed that strains 
of EV-D68 from the 2014 epidemic induced AFM in 
mice similar to the human clinical syndrome, with virus 
detected in the motor neurons [47]. The authors also 
showed that phylogenetically older strains (such as the 
Fermon strain) did not cause AFM. While only clade B1 
has been isolated from human AFM patients [12], an 
experimental mouse study [47] identified neurovirulent 
strains from multiple clades (A, B, and B1). The study 
further demonstrated that Koch’s postulates were 
fulfilled when infecting naïve mice with strains from 
affected mice. Antibodies from infected mice protected 
naïve mice. The study also showed that viral RNA was 
detectable in tissue and CSF longer than infectious 
viral particles which do not grow well or persist for long 
in cerebral tissue and CSF. Intramuscular introduction 
of the virus resulted in 100% of the mice becoming 
paralysed, in contrast to much lower rates following 
intranasal or intraperitoneal inoculation.
The available evidence suggested that the experiment 
criterion was met.
Analogy
This criterion was met in this investigation of causa-
tion, as there is suggestive evidence of AFM being 
associated with other EVs including EV-A71 and EV-D70 
[10]. EV-A71 has been reported as one of the most 
important EVs capable of infecting nerve cells and 
has caused numerous outbreaks of paralytic disease 
[60,61]. In the Asia-Pacific region, a number of out-
breaks of HFMD with associated complications such as 
AFM have been reported. A descriptive study was con-
ducted following one such outbreak in Taiwan in 1998 
in which more than 55 children died. Of 41 patients 
with neurological complications and EV-A71 infection, 
four had AFM. EV-A71 has also been shown to lead to 
complications such as aseptic meningitis, brain-stem 
encephalitis and rhombencephalitis [10].
The available evidence suggested that the criterion of 
analogy was met.
Discussion 
Historically, the incidence of EV-D68 has been low, 
with sporadic cases and small clusters of mild illness 
reported. Whether this represents under-ascertainment 
or true low incidence in the past is unclear, but active 
EV surveillance studies in several countries includ-
ing Germany in 2013-14, Hong Kong in 2014, France in 
2014 and China in 2011-15 suggest that EV-D68 was 
a rare cause of clinical infection in the past [18-21]. 
Since 2014, the number of reported infections and 
clusters has increased. In addition, severe complica-
tions including AFM have been reported since 2014 [3]. 
Several clusters of AFM in recent years were associated 
with EV-D68 and a large outbreak of EV-D68 in 2014 in 
the US was associated with severe respiratory illness.
Our application of the Bradford Hill criteria suggested 
good evidence for EV-D68 being a cause of AFM. While 
EVs in general are neurotropic, AFM has never previ-
ously been associated with EV-D68. It could be that 
incidence of EV-D68 was genuinely been much lower in 
the past, so that rare complications of infection have 
not been apparent. An analogous example is the asso-
ciation between Zika virus and microcephaly which 
was only recognised during a large-scale epidemic in 
Brazil in 2015 [62,63]. However, retrospective analysis 
of a large outbreak of Zika virus in French Polynesia 
two years earlier showed the same association with 
microcephaly but was not recognised at the time [64]. 
In addition, clades A, B and B1 of EV-D68 were highly 
neurovirulent in animal studies, with specific tropism 
for motor neurons [47]. It appears that these strains 
which evolved after the year 2000 are capable of caus-
ing AFM, as demonstrated in a mouse model, while the 
original Fermon and Rhyne strains do not cause AFM 
[47].
There is a need for phylogeographic epidemiology to 
ascertain temporal and geographic changes in the virus

and whether such changes could explain why AFM is 
newly associated with the virus. Genetic changes in the 
virus which have rendered it more neuropathic could 
explain the association, and several clades have been 
shown to be highly neurovirulent. Phylogenetic stud-
ies have demonstrated that strains isolated in recent 
outbreaks are very divergent from the original Fermon 
strain isolated in 1962 [15]. Clades B1 and B2 caused the 
2014 outbreak [30] and clade B3 caused an outbreak 
of severe EV-D68 infection in the Netherlands in 2016 
[17]. Strains in clade B1 have mutations in structural 
and non-structural proteins, which could play a role in 
the reported neurovirulence of these strains [12], and 
all EV-D68-infections in human AFM cases were attrib-
uted to clade B. However, mouse studies showed that 
multiple clades (A, B and B1) cause paralysis [47]. The 
observation that clade B1 was associated with AFM in 
2014 may be due to the much higher incidence of clade 
B1 infection in 2014. More research is needed to study 
biological gradient and to quantify measures of asso-
ciation between EV-D68 and AFM.
Given that the association of AFM with EV-D68 is recent, 
there is a strong case for systematic and enhanced EV 
surveillance, which will enable investigation of epi-
demiological data for measures of association. While 
past studies and EV surveillance showed that EV-D68 
was a rare cause of EV infection, there has been a 
change in disease epidemiology since 2014, includ-
ing a rise in the incidence of clade B infections. The 
lack of association between AFM cases and EV-D68 in 
the US in 2015 and 2016 [11] does not detract from our 
analysis, as AFM is a clinical syndrome with multiple 
possible aetiologies. More recent AFM cases could be 
due to a different aetiology, as other EVs continue to 
cause AFM, or could reflect the difficulty in isolating 
the virus from tissue and CSF. The Bradford Hill criteria 
are a tested and systematic method for evaluating cau-
sality and could be applied to other EVs.
Conclusion 
In summary, the application of the Bradford Hill cri-
teria suggests that EV-D68 causes AFM. AFM has not 
previously been associated with EV-D68, and a mouse 
model shows that the original Fermon strain does not 
cause AFM, whereas the 2014 outbreak strain does 
[47]. It appears that the incidence of this infection 
and the clade-specific epidemiology have changed. 
Phylogeographic epidemiology will further our under-
standing of the temporal and spatial spread of increas-
ingly neurovirulent clades and improve risk analysis. 
Further investigation into this relationship is important 
because of the severity of AFM, ongoing outbreaks 
of AFM and because there is currently no treatment 
for AFM related to EV-D68, and no vaccine to prevent 
infection [24,65].
