Background
Most of the detected increment in dental caries among children and adolescents is confined to occlusal surfaces of posterior permanent
molars. Dental sealants and fluoride varnishes are much used preventive options for caries. Although the effectiveness of sealants and
fluoride varnishes for controlling caries as compared with no intervention has been demonstrated in clinical trials and summarised in
systematic reviews, the relative effectiveness of these two interventions remains unclear. This review is an update of one first published
in 2006 and last updated in 2010.
Objectives
Primary objective
• To evaluate the relative effectiveness of fissure sealants compared with fluoride varnishes, or fissure sealants together with fluoride
varnishes compared with fluoride varnishes alone, for preventing dental caries in the occlusal surfaces of permanent teeth of children
and adolescents.
Secondary objectives
• To evaluate whether effectiveness is influenced by sealant material type and length of follow-up.
• To document and report on data concerning adverse events associated with sealants and fluoride varnishes.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 18 December 2015), the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 18 December 2015) and EMBASE
via Ovid (1980 to 18 December 2015). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on language
or date of publication when searching electronic databases. We screened the reference lists of identified trials and review articles for
additional relevant studies.

 Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials with at least 12 months of follow-up comparing fissure sealants, or fissure sealants together
with fluoride varnishes, versus fluoride varnishes for preventing caries in the occlusal surfaces of permanent premolar or molar teeth,
in participants younger than 20 years of age at the start of the study.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We attempted to
contact study authors to obtain missing or unclear information.
We grouped and analysed studies on the basis of sealant material type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant: glass
ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) and different follow-up periods. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for caries or no caries on
occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. For trials with a split-mouth design, we used the Becker-Balagtas odds ratio. For continuous
outcomes and data, we used means and standard deviations to obtain mean differences. We presented all measures with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
methods.
We conducted meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model, as data from only two studies were combined. We had planned to conduct
meta-analyses using a random-effects model when more than three trials were included in the meta-analysis.
Main results
In this review, we included eight trials with 1746 participants (four of the trials were new since the 2010 update). Seven trials (1127
participants) contributed to the analyses, and children involved were five to 10 years of age at the start of the trial.
Sealant versus fluoride varnish
Resin-based fissure sealants compared with fluoride varnishes
Four trials evaluated this comparison (three of them contributing to the analyses). Compared with fluoride varnish, resin-based sealants
prevented more caries in first permanent molars at two-year follow-up (two studies in the meta-analysis with pooled odds ratio (OR)
0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.94; P value = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 358 children evaluated). We assessed the body of evidence
as low quality. The caries-preventive benefit for sealants was maintained at longer follow-up in one trial at high risk of bias: 26.6% of
sealant teeth and 55.8% of fluoride-varnished teeth had developed caries when 75 children were evaluated at nine years of follow-up.
Glass ionomer-based sealants compared with fluoride varnishes
Three trials evaluated this comparison: one trial with chemically cured glass ionomer and two with resin-modified glass ionomer.
Researchers reported similar caries increment between study groups regardless of which glass ionomer material was used in a trial. Study
designs were clinically diverse, and meta-analysis could not be conducted. The body of evidence was assessed as of very low quality.
Sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish alone
One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found a significant difference in favour of resin-based fissure sealant
together with fluoride varnish compared with fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55). The body of evidence was assessed
as low quality.
Adverse events
Three trials (two with resin-based sealant material and one with resin-modified glass ionomer) reported that no adverse events resulted
from use of sealants or fluoride varnishes. The other five studies did not mention adverse events.
Authors’ conclusions
Currently, scarce and clinically diverse data are available on the comparison of sealants and fluoride varnish applications; therefore it is
not possible to draw clear conclusions about possible differences in effectiveness for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal
surfaces of permanent molars. The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those of the last update (in 2010). We found
some low-quality evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnish applications for preventing
occlusal caries in permanent molars, and other low-quality evidence for benefits of resin-based sealant and fluoride varnish over fluoride

 varnish alone. Regarding glass ionomer sealant versus fluoride varnish comparisons, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low
and could draw no conclusions.

Pit and fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes for preventing dental decay in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents
Review question
This review aimed to assess whether dental sealants (or sealants together with fluoride varnishes) or fluoride varnishes are more effective
for reducing tooth decay on biting surfaces of permanent back teeth in young people.
Background
Although children and adolescents have healthier teeth today than in the past, tooth decay is still a problem among some individuals
and populations, and it affects a large number of people around the world. Most decay in children and adolescents is concentrated
on the biting surfaces of permanent back teeth. Preventive treatment options for tooth decay include tooth brushing with a fluoride
toothpaste, use of fluoride supplements (e.g. fluoride tablets) and application of dental sealants and topical fluorides at dental clinics.
Dental sealants are applied to form a physical barrier that prevents growth of bacteria and accumulation of food particles in the grooves
of back teeth. Several sealant materials are available: The main types in use are resin-based sealants and glass ionomer cements. Fluoride
varnishes are sticky pastes that are professionally applied to the teeth two to four times a year.
Study selection
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, and the evidence is current to 18 December
2015. This review is an update of one first published in 2006 and last updated in 2010.
Study characteristics
This review includes eight studies published from 1984 to 2014, in which 1746 participants were randomly assigned (1127 were
included in the analyses) to receive dental sealant (or sealant together with fluoride varnish) or fluoride varnish applications, and the
extent of tooth decay was compared. Participants were five to 10 years of age at the start of the trial and represented the general
population.
Key results
Some evidence suggests that applying resin-based sealants to the biting surfaces of permanent back teeth in children may reduce tooth
decay in the permanent teeth of children by 3.7% over a two-year period, and by 29% over a nine-year period, when compared with
fluoride varnish applications. Applying resin-based sealant together with fluoride varnish to the biting surfaces of the permanent back
teeth may reduce tooth decay by 14.4% over a two-year period compared with fluoride varnish alone. Effects of applying glass ionomer
sealants may be similar to those seen when fluoride varnish is applied, but evidence showing the similarity between interventions is of
very low quality. Three studies reported that there were no associated adverse events from sealants or fluoride varnish applications; the
other studies did not mention adverse events.
Quality of the evidence
Available evidence is of low to very low quality because of the small number of included studies, and because of problems with the way
in which studies were conducted. Further, most studies reported a relatively short follow-up time.

We did not downgrade evidence on the basis of overall risk of bias classifications of the two studies because these studies
were otherwise well conducted even though they were not graded as having overall low risk of bias because the blinding
of outcome measurement was incomplete. The incomplete blinding of outcome measurement was judged not to be a
fundamental issue in assessing the quality of evidence in preventive sealant studies.

as having high risk of bias.

Description of the condition
Dental caries is a multi-factorial chronic oral disease that affects
most populations throughout the world and has been considered
the most important global oral health burden (Petersen 2005).
Since the 1970s, a reduction in caries prevalence has occurred in
most industrialised countries; however, dental caries is still a prob-
lem for some individuals and populations, for example, in many
Eastern European and South American countries, the prevalence
of caries among 12-year-olds has been reported to be moderate or
high (WHO 2003). A global increase in caries has been reported
recently, even in countries where prevalence of caries had previ-
ously been fairly low (Bagramian 2009).
Dental caries can be explained as an interplay between specific aci-
dogenic bacteria in the plaque biofilm, fermentable carbohydrates
and tooth structure. The biofilm bacteria produce organic acids
that can cause loss of minerals from the tooth surface (deminer-
alisation). In favourable conditions, a reversal, that is, a mineral
gain, is possible (remineralisation). If the demineralisation process
prevails, visually detectable caries lesions occur. Development of a
caries lesion is a dynamic process that may progress, stop or reverse,
and assessment of the grade and activity of the lesion is challeng-
ing. The International Caries Detection and Assessment System
integrates a definition of dental caries and a system to measure
the caries process (ICDAS II 2008). In ICDAS II, the codes for
coronal caries range from 0 to 6, depending on the severity of the
lesion: codes from 0 to 3 involve a sound tooth surface to caries
in enamel (with or without microcavitation); codes from 4 to 6
involve caries in dentine.
Within the mouth, occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth are the most
vulnerable sites because their anatomy favours biofilm formation
and retention, and the rate of occlusal caries has not fallen to the
same extent as the rate of caries on smooth surfaces (Brown 1995).
Most of the detected increment in dental caries among children
and adolescents is confined to pit and fissure surfaces of first molars
(Batchelor 2004; Brown 1995; McDonald 1992).
Description of the intervention
Dental sealants
Dental sealant is applied to a tooth surface to provide a physical
barrier that prevents growth of biofilm by blocking nutrition. Al-
though sealants were introduced for preventing caries on occlusal
surfaces, they now are considered active agents in controlling and
managing initial caries lesions on occlusal surfaces (Splieth 2010)
and,recently, onapproximal surfacesaswell (Dorri2015; Ekstrand
2012; Splieth 2010).
A resin material, bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (BIS-GMA),
forms the basis for numerous resin-based dental sealants and com-
posites that are now available. The effectiveness of resin-based
sealants is closely related to the longevity of sealant coverage (i.e.
clinical retention) (Ripa 1993). Recent reports have considered
possible adverse oestrogen-like effects of resin-based materials in-
cluding bisphenol A (BPA) (Azarpazhooh 2008b; Fleisch 2010;
Joskow 2006). This synthetic chemical resin is widely used in the
production of plastic products intended for common life but is
rarely used in dental materials (ADA 2003). Current evidence sug-
gests that people are not at risk for oestrogen-like effects when
resin-based sealants are used (ADA 2003; Azarpazhooh 2008b;
Fleisch 2010).
Along with resin-based sealants, other sealant materials are avail-
able; the main type consists of glass ionomer cements (combina-
tion of silicate and polyacrylate cement system). Glassionomer ce-
ments contain fluoride and are thought to prevent caries through
fluoride release over a prolonged period. Glassionomer cements
may be used as the original chemically cured type or as the light
cured type, which is modified with resin, for example, for rapid
initiation of the curing process. Novel materials called compomers,
which were introduced in the 1990s to combine benefits of resins
and those of glass ionomer cements (Nicholson 2007; Ruse 1999),
have also been applied as sealants. Allergic reactions to sealant ma-
terials are possible but rare.
Fluoride varnishes
The aim of topical fluoride varnish application is to treat hard
tooth surfaces in such a way that caries is arrested or reversed.
Fluoride acts to prevent caries in three ways: (1) by inhibiting the
demineralisation and (2) promoting the remineralisation of dental
enamel, and (3) by inhibiting acid formation by plaque bacteria
(Shellis 1994; Ten Cate 1997). Although fluoride varnishes have
a very high fluoride concentration (e.g. 22,660 ppm in Duraphat
fluoride varnish), their use is considered to be safe because they
have a quick-setting base, release fluoride slowly over time and re-
quire comparatively small amounts of varnish for the whole den-
tition (Petersson 1993). Only a small dose of fluoride is swallowed
over several hours, and risk of acute toxic reactions (e.g. nausea,
vomiting) is minimal (Bawden 1998; Seppä 1999). Contact al-
lergies to fluoride varnish due to colophony are possible but have
been reported in only two cases (Chu 2006; Isaksson 1993).
Sometimes topical fluoride has been combined with sealant ap-
plication to strengthen overall effectiveness in the prevention of
dental caries.
Why it is important to do this review
The Cochrane Oral Health Group undertook an extensive pri-
oritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles
that were the most clinically important ones to maintain on the
6
Pit and fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes for preventing dental decay in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Cochrane Library (Worthington 2015). Consequently, this review
was identified as a priority title by the paediatric dentistry expert
panel (Cochrane OHG priority review portfolio).
Several systematic reviews have supported the substantial effec-
tiveness of resin-based sealants and fluoride varnishes in prevent-
ing or controlling occlusal decay as compared with no interven-
tion (sealant studies: Ahovuo 2013; Griffin 2008; Llodra 1993;
Mejàre 2003; varnish studies: Azarpazhooh 2008a; Helfenstein
1994; Marinho 2013; Petersson 2004). Application of sealants is
more time-consuming than application of fluoride varnish, but
sealants usually are applied only once, whereas fluoride varnish
is applied several times, usually semi annually, depending on the
caries activity of a patient. Fluoride varnish and sealant applica-
tions, although effective, are rather expensive procedures and are
efficient only when children and teeth are carefully selected.
Although the effectiveness of sealants and fluoride varnishes in
controlling caries as compared with no intervention has been
demonstrated in clinical trials and summarised in systematic re-
views, the relative effectivenessof these twomuch appliedmeasures
remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to compare
the relative effectiveness of (1) sealants and fluoride varnishes, or
(2) sealants plus fluoride varnishes versus fluoride varnishes alone,
for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents.
This review is an update of a review first published in 2006 and
last updated in 2010, which suggested some superiority of resin-
based sealants over fluoride varnishes but was based on a very small
number of trials (Hiiri 2010).
O B J E C T I V E S
Primary objective
• To evaluate the relative effectiveness of fissure sealants
compared with fluoride varnishes, or fissure sealants together
with fluoride varnishes compared with fluoride varnishes alone,
for preventing dental caries in the occlusal surfaces of permanent
teeth of children and adolescents.
Secondary objectives
• To evaluate whether effectiveness is influenced by sealant
material type and length of follow-up.
• To document and report on data concerning adverse events
associated with sealants and fluoride varnishes.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least of
12 months follow-up, in which fissure sealants, or fissure sealants
together with fluoride varnishes, were compared with fluoride var-
nishes alone for preventing caries in occlusal surfaces of perma-
nent teeth of children and adolescents. We included both parallel-
group and split-mouth study designs. The unit of randomisation
could be the individual, the group (e.g. school, school class) or the
tooth or tooth pair.
Types of participants
Children and adolescents from the general population, younger
than 20 years of age at the start of the study.
Types of interventions
• Pit and fissure sealants of all materials (except first-
generation resin-based sealants) versus fluoride varnish.
• Pit and fissure sealants together with fluoride varnish versus
fluoride varnish.
Intervention groups included the sealant group and the sealant
plus fluoride varnish group. The control group was the fluoride
varnish group.
We included studies in which applications were placed on occlusal
surfaces of permanent premolar or molar teeth for the purpose of
preventing caries, regardless of who did the application. Materials
could be applied on sound surfaces or on enamel lesions (if scored
using the ICDAS II scale, codes 0, 1, 2 and 3 were accepted). The
sealantapplicationmethodusedinthe studycouldconsistof direct
application to the tooth surface or application after mechanical
preparation of the enamel surface.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Incidence of dentinal carious lesions on treated occlusal
surfaces of molars or premolars (yes or no).
• Changes in decayed, missing and filled (DMF) figures at
surface, tooth and whole-mouth levels.
• Progression of caries lesion into enamel or dentine.
Secondary outcomes
• Time taken to apply pit and fissure sealant or fluoride
varnish.
• Number of visits to the dentist for repair of sealant or
fluoride varnish application.
• Adverse events and safety of sealants and fluoride varnishes.

 Search methods for identification of studies
For identification of studies for this review, we developed detailed
search strategies for each database searched. These were based on
the search strategydevelopedforMEDLINE(Ovid)(see Appendix
1) but were revised appropriately for each database.
Electronic searches
We searched the following electronic databases, amending the
search strategies for this 2016 update.
• Trial Register of the Cochrane Oral Health Group (to 18
December 2015) (see Appendix 2).
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 11) (see Appendix 3).
• MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 18 December 2015) (see
Appendix 1).
• EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 18 December 2015) (see
Appendix 4).
We searched the following databases for ongoing trials.
• US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://
clinicaltrials.gov) (to 18 December 2015) (see Appendix 5).
• World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx)
(to 18 December 2015) (see Appendix 5).
We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication
when searching the electronic databases.
In previous versions of this review, we also searched the follow-
ing electronic databases: SCISEARCH, CAplus, INSPEC, JICST-
EPLUS, NTIS, PASCAL, DARE, NHS EED, HTA and Open-
SIGLE (see Appendix 6). However, we decided not to update these
databases at this time because in previous versions of the review,
these searches yielded no additional information.
Searching other resources
We screened the reference lists of already identified trials and re-
view articles for additional relevant studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (Anneli Ahovuo-Saloranta (AAS) and Helena
Forss (HF)) independently selected papers on the basis of title,
keywords and abstract, and decided on eligibility. We obtained the
full text of every study considered for inclusion. If information
relevant to the inclusion criteria was not available in the abstract,
or if the title was relevant but the abstract was not available, we
obtained the full text of the report. All information gathering
and data recording were done independently, and disagreements
were resolved by discussion with a third review author (Anne Hiiri
(AH), Anne Nordblad (AN) or Marjukka Mäkelä (MM)).
We contacted trial authors to request additional information if
the study seemed to fulfil the inclusion criteria for this review but
information in the report was insufficient to allow final assessment
of inclusion or exclusion.
In this review, we decided to consider only studies with a full-
text report. We excluded studies reported only as abstracts because
evidence has suggested discrepancies between data reported in an
abstract and those provided in the final published full report, and
because information on trial quality indicators is often lacking
(Chokkalingam 1998; Hopewell 2006). Thus we saw that the
full-text report is required to ensure reliable data extraction and
assessment of risk of bias. To diminish the risk of publication bias,
we contacted authors of relevant abstracts to ask whether a full-
text report of the study (unpublished or published) was available.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (AAS, HF) extracted data from all included
studies in duplicate and independently. Review authors were in
full agreement about excluded data, and discussion or consulta-
tion with a third review author was not needed. We attempted to
contact study authors to request missing information or clarifica-
tion when necessary.
We extracted the following information on study methods.
• Trial design.
• Study duration (years of follow-up).
• Year the study began.
We extracted the following characteristics of participants.
• Location where study was conducted (country and setting
where participants were recruited).
• Criteria for accepting participants into the study (intact
surfaces and surfaces with enamel lesion allowed).
• Age (range) and mean age at start.
• Gender.
• Baseline caries prevalence of participants (caries severity at
start (average number of decayed, missing and filled deciduous
teeth (dmft); decayed, missing and filled deciduous surfaces
(dmfs); decayed, missing and filled permanent surfaces (DMFS)
and/or decayed, filled permanent surfaces (DFS); or other
measure)).
• Number of randomly assigned participants and number of
teeth in treatment at study start and after follow-up.
• Number of evaluated participants.
We extracted the following characteristics of interventions.
• Intervention comparisons (sealant versus fluoride varnish,
or sealant plus fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish).
• Sealant and fluoride varnish products used in the study.
• Reapplication of sealants and frequency of fluoride varnish
application.

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 • Information on who applied sealants and fluoride varnishes
(dentist with or without assistant or dental hygienist).
• Co-interventions (e.g. background exposure to other
fluoride sources (toothpaste, water, etc.)).
We extracted the following characteristics of outcomes.
• Description of outcomes.
• Description of outcome measurements.
We extracted the following additional information.
• Information related to calibration of examiners and kappa
statistics.
• Sealant retention figures at follow-up.
• Funding source.
• Caries prevalence of population in study area.
Outcome information was extracted mainly as the number of
dentinal carious lesions or non-carious lesions on occlusal surfaces
of treatment and control teeth at different follow-up times. If a
filling had been put on the occlusal surface or the tooth had been
extracted as the result of caries during the study, we coded it as
caries. We extracteddatapresentedonlyingraphsandfigureswhen
possible. We presented data from the included studies in Table 1.
In addition, we recorded caries increments as changes in DMFS/
DMFT scores and as progression of caries lesions in enamel or
dentine when study authors reported them. We recorded the fol-
lowing secondary outcomes when reported: time taken to apply
pit and fissure sealant or fluoride varnish, number of visits to the
dentist for repair or reapplication of sealant or fluoride varnish
application and safety of sealants and fluoride varnishes.
In some studies, results were provided at more than one period
of follow-up. All data were extracted at pre-selected times- at one,
two, three, four, five years, etc. (annually). Analyses based on avail-
able data were carried out at these pre-selected times.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (AAS, HF) independently assessed the risk
of bias of included studies. They resolved disagreements by con-
sensus. We contacted the authors of included studies to request
additional information. As recommended by the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (Higgins
2011a), we assessed the following six methodological domains:
random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome
reporting and other sources of bias (e.g. baseline comparability).
Within each domain, we judged each study as having ‘low’, ‘high’
or ‘unclear’ risk of bias, with the latter indicating lack of informa-
tion or uncertainty over the potential for bias. See Table 2 for the
detailed criteria we used in our assessment.
Summary assessments of ’Risk of bias’
To draw conclusions about the overall risk of bias for caries out-
comes within a study, we decided to classify the studies in three
categories: studies with low, unclear or high risk of bias. We de-
termined caries outcomes from data of the included studies (all
caries data were extracted at pre-selected times - annually, at one,
two, three, four, five years, etc.).
Our classification was based on the five domains that we deemed
most fundamental in assessing risk of study bias: allocation con-
cealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome
data, selective outcome reporting and baseline comparability.
We defined overall risk of bias categories as follows.
• Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter
results) if all five fundamental domains defined above were
graded as low risk of bias.
• Unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt
about results) if one or more of the domains were graded as
unclear risk of bias.
• High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results) if one or more domains were graded as
high risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated odds ratios for differences in sealant and fluoride
varnish groups as to whether occlusal surfaces were carious, along
with appropriate standard errors and 95% confidence intervals,
using RevMan 2014. For split-mouth studies, we calculated odds
ratios (ORs) using the Becker-Balagtas method (BB OR) out-
lined in Curtin 2002 with R software version 3.0.1. We chose the
Becker-Balagtas method because we intended to pool data from
split-mouth studies and parallel-group studies in the same meta-
analyses, and this method facilitated data synthesis (as outlined
in the article by Stedman 2011). All included split-mouth studies
presented paired data by tooth pairs, and the intracluster correla-
tion co-efficient (ICC) (needed for BB OR calculations) could be
calculated from paired data. If we had included split-mouth stud-
ies presenting data only in marginals (as parallel-group studies,
not as cross-classification), we would have chosen the conservative
ICC 0.05. Results of the study by Bravo 2005 with clustered data
are presented as risk ratios (RRs) with cluster-corrected standard
errors. We requested from study authors cluster-corrected effect
estimates of that study for the earlier update of this review, and we
used them in this review update.
For continuous outcomes and data, we used means and standard
deviations to obtain mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
Unit of analysis issues
In parallel-group studies and cluster-randomised studies, we chose
an individual to be the unit of analysis. If clustered data were
provided (e.g. several measurements per individual (e.g. more than
one tooth/surface), clustering of children at school class level), we
adjusted the standard errors of estimates to take clustering into
9

 account (as outlined in Section 16.3.4 of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011b)).
In split-mouth studies, we chose a tooth pair within an individ-
ual to be the unit of analysis. In some studies, more than one
pair of tooth surfaces per child might be treated. These pairs are
not independent and should be analysed as ’paired data’ on a per-
child basis. However, data presented in these studies did not en-
able taking into account the dependence of tooth pairs on a per-
child basis (we are unaware of any widely used methods to correct
and account for dependence of the tooth pairs). This meant that
confidence intervals would be slightly narrower than they should
be, and this was taken into consideration when we interpreted the
results.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted trial authors to retrieve missing data when necessary
or feasible.
We performed analyses using an available case data analysis ap-
proach, as represented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (Higgins 2011b). This ap-
proach for calculating response rates uses the total number of par-
ticipants for whom data were recorded for the particular outcome
in question as a denominator.
In caries prevention studies, follow-up times can include several
years. Studies with long follow-up have the problem of high drop-
out rates, causing uncertainty in the data. The usual reason for
drop-out is that children move away from the study area. We
decided to include in the analyses data from all studies (regardless
of drop-out rates). We assessed studies with a high drop-out rate
(drop-out rate > 25% regardless of follow-up time) to be at high
risk of bias. We intended to evaluate in the sensitivity analyses the
effects of risk of bias grading on study results.
Assessment of heterogeneity
If a sufficient number of studies had been included in any meta-
analyses, we would have assessed clinical heterogeneity by examin-
ing the characteristics of studies and the similarity between types
of participants (especially baseline caries prevalence levels of pop-
ulations), interventions and outcomes as specified in the criteria
for included studies.
The significance of any discrepancies in estimates of treatment ef-
fects from various studies was assessed by Cochran’s test for het-
erogeneity and by a measure of I2. The measure I2 describes the
percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to hetero-
geneity rather than to sampling error. A value greater than 50%
may be considered to represent substantial heterogeneity (Higgins
2003).
Assessment of reporting biases
If sufficient numbers of trials (more than 10) had been included
in any meta-analysis, we would have assessed publication bias ac-
cording to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asym-
metry provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (Sterne 2011). If asymmetry was
identified, we would have examined possible causes.
Data synthesis
We grouped and analysed studies on the basis of sealant material
type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant: glass
ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) using different follow-
up periods. We conducted meta-analyses in RevMan 2014, using
the generic inverse variance method with a fixed-effect or random-
effects model. In meta-analyses that included two or three studies,
we plannedtouse the fixed-effectmodel,andinmeta-analyseswith
four or more studies, we planned to use the random-effects model
(as recommended under ’Advice to Authors’ in the Cochrane Oral
Health Group Guide). We planned to pool data from studies in
each comparison regardless of the risk of bias classification of these
studies.
When feasible, we pooled in the same meta-analysis odds ratios
from parallel-group studies and from split-mouth studies by using
Becker-Balagtas odds ratios in split-mouth studies, as outlined in
the article by Stedman 2011.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If a sufficient number of studies had been included in any meta-
analyses, we would have examined the relative effectiveness of
sealants and fluoride varnishes at different caries prevalence levels.
As data were insufficient, it was not possible to create subgroups
for further analyses.
Sensitivity analysis
If a sufficient number of studies had been included in any meta-
analyses, we would have undertaken sensitivity analyses to assess
the robustness of results (for caries outcomes) by excluding studies
with unclear or high risk of overall bias.
’Summary of findings’ tables and assessing the quality
of the evidence
We followed GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) methods (GRADE 2004) and used
GRADEpro software to provide overall grading of the quality of
evidence for caries outcomes for the following comparisons: resin-
based sealant versus fluoride varnish (Summary of findings for the
main comparison); glass ionomer or resin-modified glass ionomer
sealant versus fluoride varnish (Summary of findings 2); and resin-
based sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish
alone (Summary of findings 3). We assessed the quality of the body
of evidence with reference to overall risk of bias of included studies

precision of estimates and risk of publication bias.

Description of studies
Results of the search
In this 2016 update, we used a revised search strategy in all elec-
tronic databases and searched from their respective start dates.
Thus we rechecked data over all years. We retrieved the follow-
ing numbers of records through searches: Cochrane Oral Health
Group Trials Register (26 records), Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (108 records), MEDLINE (601
records), EMBASE (490 records) and databases for ongoing trials
(15 records). We had a total of 648 records after duplicates were
removed. In addition to electronic searches, we found 10 poten-
tially relevant reports in the reference lists of review articles and
identified trial articles (nine records from earlier searches and one
new record from this 2016 update search). Thus we considered
the total number of reports to be 658.
Of these 658 records, we discarded 591 as not relevant to this
review. We obtained 67 full-text reports. Of these 67 reports, we
excluded 44, leaving 23 reports for final assessment. The main
reasons for exclusion were as follows: Studies included only one or
the other of sealant or fluoride varnish applications, other caries
prevention programmes were involved in the intervention or treat-
ments were intended to manage dentine caries.
We evaluated 23 reports in detail. We considered 12 reports rep-
resenting eight individual studies as eligible for inclusion in the
review. We explained the reasons for exclusion of these 10 studies
with 11 reports in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
We presented this process as a flow chart in Figure 1.

 For this and previous updates, we contacted the authors of three
studies to obtain additional information to assess the eligibility of
studies for this review (de Oliveira 2013; Saifullina 1990; Uma
2011). One study author provided additional information (Uma
2011).
In this updated version of the review, we included four new studies
(Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Salem 2014; Tagliaferro 2011) and excluded
twonewstudies(de Oliveira2013; Uma 2011). See Characteristics
of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies.
The electronic search identified two potential ongoing trials for
this review: ISRCTN17029222; and ISRCTN81071356. See
Characteristics of ongoing studies.
We applied no language restrictions and translated all non-English
language reports for study assessment. Review authors could read
reports in English, German and Scandinavian languages. We con-
sulted translators to identify and assess non-English reports that
had potential for inclusion (Chinese, Polish, Russian, Portuguese
and Spanish).
Included studies
In total, we included eight studies in the review (Bravo 2005;
Florio 2001; Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014; Splieth
2001; Tagliaferro 2011).
Comparisons
• Pit and fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes: resin-based
fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish (n = 4) (Bravo 2005; Liu
2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014); glass ionomer fissure sealant
versus fluoride varnish (n = 1) (Ji 2007); and resin-modified glass
ionomer fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish (n = 2) (Florio
2001; Tagliaferro 2011).
◦ Tagliaferro 2011 actually evaluated whether additional
benefit is derived by using sealants and fluoride varnish among
children receiving regular oral health education (the evaluation
was carried out separately in populations with high risk and low
risk of caries).
• Pit and fissure sealant together with fluoride varnish versus
fluoride varnish alone: resin-based fissure sealant plus fluoride
varnish versus fluoride varnish alone (n = 1) (Splieth 2001).
Study designs
Six of the eight included studies were of parallel-group design
(Bravo 2005; Florio 2001; Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Salem 2014;
Tagliaferro 2011) and the other two were split-mouth studies, in
which the two interventions (fissure sealant vs fluoride varnish
(Raadal 1984) and fissure sealant plus fluoride varnish vs fluoride
varnish alone (Splieth 2001)) were randomly allocated to teeth
within a tooth pair.
Settings
Two studies were conducted in Brazil (Florio 2001; Tagliaferro
2011), two in China (Ji 2007; Liu 2012), one in Germany (Splieth
2001), one in Iran (Salem 2014), one in Norway (Raadal 1984)
and one in Spain (Bravo 2005). In seven out of the eight studies,
childrenwere recruitedfrompublicdental clinicsorschools. Inone
study, children were enrolled from private dental practice (Splieth
2001). The age range of the children over all included studies was
five to 10 years.
Interventions
In all studies, sealants and fluoride varnishes were applied to oc-
clusal surfaces of permanent first molars. Applications were done
on sound surfaces (Bravo 2005; Ji 2007; Salem 2014; Tagliaferro
2011), on surfaces with enamel lesions (Florio 2001) or in the
same study on sound surfaces or on surfaces with enamel lesions
(Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Splieth 2001). In Raadal 1984, surfaces
with initial caries in enamel to be sealed were prepared mechani-
cally and caries removed before sealant was applied.
The sealant material in Ji 2007 was glass ionomer; Florio 2001 and
Tagliaferro 2011 used resin-modified glass ionomer; and the other
five studies used resin-based sealant materials: light-polymerised
resin sealant (Bravo 2005; Salem 2014; Splieth 2001), light-poly-
merised resin sealant with fluoride (Liu 2012) and autopoly-
merised resin sealant (Raadal 1984). Reapplication of sealants was
reported in three studies (Bravo 2005; Salem 2014; Splieth 2001).
In Bravo 2005, sealants were reapplied if partial or total loss had
occurred since the previous examination after six, 12, 18, 24 and
36 months. In Salem 2014, partially and completely lost sealants
were repaired or reapplied once if needed after six months. In
Splieth 2001, children were examined semi annually for two years,
and sealants were resealed if necessary.
Complete retention of resin-based sealants after two years varied
from 43% (Salem 2014) to 81% (Splieth 2001). Bravo 2005 with
longer follow-up time reported complete resin sealant retention of
63% after four years and 39% after nine years. Retention of glass
ionomer sealants was also fairly high (66% complete retention
after one year (Florio 2001 with resin-modified glass ionomer);
84% after two years (Tagliaferro 2011 with resin-modified glass
ionomer) and 61% after three years (Ji 2007 with chemically cured
glass ionomer)).
The fluoride varnish used in one study was Durafluor (Medicom
Worldwide Inc., Morrisville, PA, USA) (Salem 2014), in another
studyFluorProtectorS (IvoclarVivadentInc., Amherst,NY, USA)
(Ji 2007) and in the other six studies Duraphat (Colgate Oral
Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY, USA). In six studies, fluoride
varnish was applied biannually only to control teeth (Florio 2001;
Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014; Tagliaferro 2011),
13

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 and in one study biannually to all teeth (Splieth 2001). In Bravo
2005, Duraphat was applied to newly erupted molars and was
reapplied to all molars that had remained healthy after six, 12, 18,
24, 30, 36 and 42 months.
Co-interventions
Besides pit and fissure sealing and fluoride varnish application,
studies included other co-interventions. In Florio 2001, tap wa-
ter was fluoridated and children received professional prophy-
laxis during dental examination visits. In Raadal 1984, partici-
pants followed a fluoride rinsing programme at schools during
follow-up, and use of fluoride tablets was recommended. Splieth
2001 reported that 5% of children used fluoride tablets during the
trial. Six studies reported motivation and instruction of partici-
pants towards good oral hygiene and use of fluoridated toothpaste
(Florio 2001; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014; Splieth 2001;
Tagliaferro 2011).
Two studies gave information on food (e.g. snacking habits of chil-
dren). In Splieth 2001, during the trial, the mean frequency of
cariogenic food intake per day was 15, including a large number
of sweetened drinks. In Liu 2012, at study baseline, 13% of chil-
dren in the sealant group and 31% in the fluoride varnish group
consumed snacks twice a day or more frequently (no information
was provided on snacking habits during the trial).
Caries prevalence of children at baseline
All studies except Ji 2007 stated the baseline caries prevalence of
the study population. The only study from the 1980s (Raadal
1984) stated that initial mean decayed, missing, filled deciduous
teeth (dmft) was 4.7 (standard deviation (SD) 3.3). The three
studies conducted in the 1990s stated baseline caries prevalences
as follows: In Bravo 2005, baseline mean decayed, filled deciduous
teeth (dft) in the sealant group was 2.2 (SD 2.6), and in the varnish
group 2.4 (SD 3.3); in Florio 2001, mean decayed, missing, filled
deciduous surfaces (dmfs) in the sealant group was 3.8 (SD 2.5),
and in the fluoride varnish group 4.5 (SD 2.7); and in Splieth
2001, initial mean decayed, missing, filled permanent surfaces
(DMFS) was 0.2. The three studies from the 2010s stated baseline
caries prevalences as follows: In Liu 2012, baseline mean decayed,
missing,filleddeciduousteeth (dmft)inthe sealantgroupwas 3.19
(2.68) and in the varnish group 3.58 (2.25) for children eight to 10
years of age; in Salem 2014, the mean dmft index for children six
to seven years of age was 4.6; and in Tagliaferro 2011, the baseline
mean dmft index was 4.51 (2.81) for the HRS group (high-caries-
riskchildrenreceivingsealants)and4.28 (2.54)forthe HRV group
(high-caries-risk children receiving fluoride varnishes), and in low-
caries-risk groups, dmft + DMFT was zero. In Ji 2007, 21% of
control teeth without treatment were decayed after three years.
Outcome measures
Seven of the included studies reported the incidence of dentinal
carious lesions on treated occlusal surfaces of first permanent mo-
lars in dichotomous form (yes/no). Tagliaferro 2011 reported data
in continuous form as mean DMF (decayed, missed and filled)
increments. In addition to visual-tactile caries diagnostic methods,
one of the eight studies reported the endoscopic examination to be
used (Florio 2001), and two studies reported X-rays: Florio 2001,
digital X-rays, and Raadal 1984, traditional X-rays.
Other outcomes reported were caries progression rate (Florio
2001), changes in DMF scores on a whole-mouth level (Splieth
2001) and average treatment time for sealing and varnish appli-
cation (Splieth 2001). Three studies considered adverse events (
Bravo 2005; Liu 2012; Tagliaferro 2011).
Details of all outcomes reported for each study are given in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Intra-examiner and inter-examiner agreement for caries diagnosis
was stated in four studies: In Liu 2012, the Kappa co-efficient for
intra-examiner reliability was reported to be over 0.9, in Salem
2014 about 0.8 and in Tagliaferro 2011 over 0.90. Further, the
study by Bravo 2005 reported Kappa coefficients for intra-exam-
iner and inter-examiner reliability greater than 0.68.
Funding source
Five of the eight studies were supported by governmental or aca-
demic sources or by independent research foundations (Bravo
2005; Florio 2001; Liu 2012; Salem 2014; Tagliaferro 2011). The
other three studies did not provide information on funding.
Excluded studies
We excluded 10 studies (with 11 references) for reasons presented
under Characteristics of excluded studies.
Reasons for exclusion varied, and for some studies we identified
several reasons for exclusion. The main reasons for exclusion were
as follows: Three studies did not compare sealant with fluoride
varnish; six studies clearly were not randomised or no mention was
made of randomisation; and one study had important outcome
data flaws.
Risk of bias in included studies
We contacted the authors of included studies to request additional
information for assessment of risk of bias if information in the
report was insufficient to permit final decisions. We requested
additional information from seven included studies (Bravo 2005;
Florio 2001; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014; Splieth 2001;
Tagliaferro 2011) but not from Ji 2007 (this study was translated
and data extracted by translators). ’Risk of bias’ assessments for
each individual study are presented in the ’Risk of bias’ tables
included under Characteristics of included studies, and results are

 Allocation
Random sequence generation was adequate, indicating low risk of
bias in six studies (75%) (Florio 2001; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984;
Salem 2014; Splieth 2001; Tagliaferro 2011). Random sequence
was generated most often by using random numbers or tossing
coins. We assessed one study in this domain as having high risk of
bias (Bravo 2005) and one as having unclear risk of bias (Ji 2007).
We graded allocation concealment as having low risk of bias in five
of the eight studies (Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014; Splieth
2001; Tagliaferro 2011). In two studies, allocation concealment
remained unclear (Florio 2001: Ji 2007), and in one study, it was
assessed as having high risk of bias (Bravo 2005).
Blinding
We did not address performance bias in this review (see Table 2).
We assessed blinding of outcome measurement as adequate in one
of the eightstudies(Salem2014)(13%), asthe studystatedthatthe
examiner was not involved in study design. Blinding of outcome
measurement was assessed as ’unclear’ in three studies (38%) (
Bravo 2005; Liu 2012; Tagliaferro 2011), in which forms stating
children’s group assignment were kept away from the examiner.
In three studies, outcome assessors were not blinded (Florio 2001;
Raadal 1984; Splieth 2001), and in one study, no information was
provided on blinding of outcome assessors (Ji 2007), so we graded
these studies as having ’high’ risk of detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Only one study had follow-up of 12 months, and it was assessed
as having high risk of bias because drop-out rates were unevenly
distributed between study groups (Florio 2001). The six studies
providing data at 24 months of follow-up were assessed as having
low risk of bias in this domain (Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984;
Salem 2014; Splieth 2001; Tagliaferro 2011). The only study pro-
viding data at 36 months of follow-up was assessed to be at low
risk of bias in this domain (Ji 2007). The only study providing
data at 48 months of follow-up was assessed to be at unclear risk of
bias because no information on drop-outs was provided by study
group (Bravo 2005). Bravo 2005 also measured outcomes at nine
years of follow-up and was assessed to have high risk of bias in this
domain (the proportion of participants assessed and included in
the analysis was only 33%).
Selective reporting
All eight studies reported their pre-specified outcomes adequately
so were assessed as having low risk of bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We assessed the comparability of study groups and possible co-
interventions during the trial as balanced between study groups
in six studies (Bravo 2005; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Salem 2014;
Splieth 2001; Tagliaferro 2011). Two of the six studies were of
split-mouth design, where conditions are the same for both teeth
within a tooth pair (Raadal 1984; Splieth 2001); the other four
studies were parallel-group studies (Bravo 2005; Liu 2012; Salem
2014; Tagliaferro 2011). No information on this domain was pro-
vided in Ji 2007, so the judgement was ’unclear’ risk of bias. In
the study by Florio 2001, groups were assessed as imbalanced at
baseline, and the study was graded as having ’high’ risk of bias in
this domain.
Overall risk of bias was assessed as low for one study (Salem 2014),
as unclear for two studies (Liu 2012; Tagliaferro 2011) and as high
for five studies (Bravo 2005; Florio 2001; Ji 2007; Raadal 1984;
Splieth 2001) for the five key domains of allocation concealment,
blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selec-
tive reporting and baseline comparability of study groups (Figure
3).

Results from seven studies are incorporated in this review (Bravo
2005; Florio 2001; Ji 2007; Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Splieth 2001;
Tagliaferro 2011). Although the study by Salem 2014 met the
inclusioncriteria,resultsanddata(complexmulti-level model with
teeth nested in a child nested in a school class nested in a school)
were not provided in useable form for this review (the unit of
analysis was a tooth surface, but clustering of teeth and of children
was not taken into account).
All studies reported data on sealant and fluoride varnish applica-
tions to occlusal surfaces of permanent first molars.

 Primary outcome - incidence of dentinal carious lesion on
treated occlusal surfaces of molars or premolars
Resin fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish
Three studies compared resin-based fissure sealant versus fluoride
varnish: Two studies reported results at two years (the split-mouth
study by Raadal 1984 and the parallel-group study by Liu 2012);
one parallel-group study reported results at four years and nine
years (Bravo 2005) (see Table 1).
At two years, the meta-analysis pooling effect estimates of Liu
2012 and Raadal 1984 found a significant benefit for resin-based
sealants with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.69 (95% confidence inter-
val (CI) 0.50 to 0.94) compared with fluoride varnish, when a
fixed-effect model was used with available case data (358 evaluated
participants; Analysis 1.1). We noted no statistical heterogeneity
between studies (I2 statistic = 0%), although Raadal 1984 found
significant benefit for resin sealants but Liu 2012 reported that
the benefit of sealants was not statistically significant. Incomplete
blinding of outcome measurement led to further uncertainty sur-
rounding results.
Bravo 2005 foundasignificantdifference infavourof visible-light-
polymerised resin sealant compared with fluoride varnish, with
a risk ratio (RR) of 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to
0.84) (Analysis 1.2) and 0.48 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.79) (Analysis
1.3) at four years and nine years of follow-up, respectively. Drop-
out rates were high after nine years of follow-up.
Glass ionomer fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish
Resin-modified glass ionomer fissure sealant versus fluoride
varnish at one year
One small study, at high risk of bias, provided results for one year
of follow-up (Florio 2001; Table 1). This study failed to find a
significant difference between intervention groups, with an OR
of 0.18 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.27) at one year of follow-up (Analysis
2.1). All occlusal surfaces under examination had enamel lesions
before applications.
Glass ionomer fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish at two
years and three years
One study with incomplete information and analyses provided
results for this comparison (Ji 2007). In the statistical analyses of
this study, clustering of teeth within a child was not taken into
account (with adequate standard errors of estimates), and no in-
formation on numbers of children at follow-up times was available
for re-analysis of data. However, because the numbers of decayed
teeth were small in both groups, we decided to report the absolute
numbers of decayed tooth surfaces in sealant and fluoride varnish
groups without effect estimates (ignoring the clustered data). We
noted no significant differences in rates of caries development be-
tween groups (at 24 months, 11 of 321 sealed surfaces (3.4%) and
13 of 320 fluoride-varnished surfaces (4.1%) were decayed, and at
36 months, 22 of 311 (7.1%) and 24 of 320 (7.5%), respectively).
The rate of caries in the control group without intervention was
14% (48/348) at 24 months and 21% (71/340) at 36 months.
Resin-modified glass ionomer cement plus oral health
education versus fluoride varnish plus oral health education
at two years
One study (Tagliaferro 2011) provided results for comparison of
resin-modified glass ionomer cement + oral health education every
three months versus fluoride varnish application biannually + oral
health education every three months. The comparison was per-
formed separately for high-caries-risk children and for low-caries-
risk children. Groups to be compared were HRS (high-risk chil-
dren with sealant application + oral health education) versus HRV
(high-risk children with fluoride varnish application + oral health
education); and LRS (low-risk children with sealant application +
oral health education) versus LRV (low-risk children with fluoride
varnish application + oral health education).
Investigators reported results as follows: After 24 months, the HRS
group showed similar caries increment when compared with the
HRV group (mean DMF (decayed, missed and filled) increments
on occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars was 0.06 (SD 0.25)
and 0.29 (0.68), respectively). For low-risk groups, no statistically
significant differences were observed among treatments. Study au-
thors concluded “that in a 2-year period, oral health education was
sufficient to control occlusal caries in low-risk children while for
high-risk children, sealant application in addition to oral health
education was considered the best strategy”.
Primary outcome - progression of caries lesion into enamel
or dentine
One study (Florio 2001), which compared resin-modified glass
ionomer fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish at one year, included
only enamel caries lesions and reported arrestment of enamel
caries lesions or progression into dentine with both interventions
(Analysis 2.1).
Secondary outcome - number of visits to the dentist for
repair of sealant or fluoride varnish application
The number of visits for repair or reapplication of sealants or fluo-
ride varnish applications was reported directly only by Bravo 2005,
for which the average number of treatment visits per child during
the active phase of the programme was 2.2 (SD 1.1) (maximum
18

 6) for children in the resin sealant group and 7.3 (SD 1.0) (maxi-
mum 8) for children in the varnish group. This difference is great
because the sealant was reapplied only when partial or total loss
occurred, whereas the varnish was systematically reapplied.
Secondary outcome - adverse events and safety of sealants
and fluoride varnishes
Three of the included studies considered adverse events associ-
ated with sealants and fluoride varnishes (Bravo 2005; Liu 2012;
Tagliaferro 2011). Participants detected and reported no adverse
events.
Sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride
varnish alone
Primary outcome - incidence of dentinal carious lesions on
treated occlusal surfaces of molars or premolars
Resin fissure sealant plus fluoride varnish versus fluoride
varnish
One split-mouth study analysed 92 children and compared resin-
based fissure sealant concurrently with fluoride varnish versus flu-
oride varnish alone after two years (Splieth 2001); investigators
found a significant difference in favour of the sealant together
with fluoride varnish, with an OR of 0.30 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.55)
compared with fluoride varnish alone (Table 1; Analysis 3.1). This
study considered both sound occlusal surfaces and surfaces with
enamel lesions. Incomplete blinding of outcome measurement
caused some uncertainty in results, although the study was other-
wise well conducted.
Primary outcome - changes in decayed, missing and filled
(DMF) figures at whole-mouth level
Splieth2001 reportedchangesinDMFfiguresatthe whole-mouth
level during this study. The mean decayed, missing and filled per-
manent surfaces (DMFS) score of the whole mouth in the study
population increased from 0.2 to 0.6 after one year and to 1.1 after
two years. Study authors reported that most caries still occurred
on occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars (50.9%).
Secondary outcome - time taken to apply pit and fissure
sealant or fluoride varnish
Only one study reported an average treatment time for sealing
and fluoride varnish application (Splieth 2001). Total time needed
for sealing and resealing of two teeth was on average 29 minutes
during two years, of which most of the time was spent on initial
sealants(about17minutes).Meantreatmenttime foreach fluoride
varnish application was under three minutes (total time during
intervention: nine minutes).

Summary of main results
Effectiveness of interventions
This review found low-quality evidence for resin-based sealant, or
resin-based sealant together with fluoride varnish, over fluoride
varnish application for prevention of occlusal decay of permanent
first molars, and very low-quality evidence for no difference be-
tween resin-modified glass ionomer or glass ionomer sealants and
fluoride varnishes. Drawing conclusions on the basis of the scarce
data reported in this review is complicated because of diversity in
comparisons, follow-up times and sealant products, for example;
thus for several outcomes, only one study was available and only
one meta-analysis could be conducted. Further, it was difficult to
compare caries risks of treated teeth or of children between studies
because information on confounding factors (like snacking habits
or use of fluoride products) and caries incidence in these popula-
tions was incomplete. Moreover, studies were conducted between
the 1980s and the 2010s, and so different progression rates of
caries in permanent teeth could be expected (Whelton 2004).
Sealant versus fluoride varnish
Resin fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes
Results of the meta-analysis at two years, including one study from
the 1980s (Raadal 1984) and one from the 2000s (Liu 2012),
slightly favoured resin sealants over fluoride varnishes. When re-
sults are interpreted, it should be noted that the superiority of
sealantsnotedinthe Norwegiansplit-mouth studybyRaadal 1984
may be influenced by the carry-over effect of fluoride varnish,
even though this is unlikely due to a fast-setting base and a small
amount of fluoride varnish applied to one or two control teeth.
Further, this split-mouth study provided no information on caries
incidence in control teeth without treatment and was conducted
as early as 1980s. In the Chinese study conducted recently by Liu
2012, numbers of decayed tooth surfaces in all groups were, in
total, rather small (at 24 months of follow-up, proportions of pit/
fissure sites with dentine caries in sealant, fluoride varnish and con-
trol groups were 1.6%, 2.4% and 4.6%, respectively). Liu 2012
authors discussed that the low incidence of fissure caries in the
control group without treatment may be explained in part by to-
day’s slower dental caries progression rate (Whelton 2004).
Both studies (Liu 2012; Raadal 1984) included surfaces with
enamel caries lesions, in addition to sound surfaces. In the study by
Raadal 1984, surfaces with enamel lesions were opened mechani-
cally before sealant application, but researchers provided no infor-
mation on the number of such surfaces included. In the study by
Liu 2012, 35% of tooth sites had early-stage caries at baseline. In
the study by Raadal 1984, retention of sealants after 23 months of
follow-up was better (63%) than in the study by Liu 2012, which
reported 46% retention of sealants. Prevalence of caries in primary
teeth at baseline was reported in both studies, and it was slightly
lower in Liu 2012 (baseline mean dmft 3.19 (SD 2.68) and 3.58
(2.25) in sealant group and fluoride varnish group, respectively).
In Raadal 1984, the mean dmft was 4.7 (SD 3.3).
The Spanish study by Bravo 2005 (started in 1990), in which
sealants were placed on sound surfaces and were reapplied when
partially or totally lost during the four-year active preventive pro-
gramme, found resin sealants better than fluoride varnishes at four
years and nine years of follow-up. Complete sealant retention was
reported at 63% at four years and 39% at nine years. The inci-
dence of caries in the control group after nine years was 77% on
occlusal surfaces, whereas 26.6% of sealant teeth and 55.8% of
fluoride-varnished teeth had developed caries at nine years. Caries
prevalence among primary teeth at baseline was stated as follows:
mean dft in the sealant group 2.24 (SD 2.59) and in the fluoride
varnish group 2.42 (SD 3.26). The total drop-out rate of Bravo
2005 at nine years of follow-up was high (67%), suggesting lack
of reliability of results.
Glass ionomers and resin-modified glass ionomers versus
fluoride varnishes
Three studies - one with traditional glass ionomer (Ji 2007) and
two with resin-modified glass ionomer (Florio 2001; Tagliaferro
2011) - compared glass ionomer versus fluoride varnish. The small
study by Florio 2001, analysing 21 children and providing only
one-year data, reported no differences between resin-modified
glass ionomer sealant and fluoride varnish. Retention of sealant in
that study was 66%. However, Tagliaferro 2011, concluded that
over a two-year period for high-risk children, sealant application
in addition to oral health education was considered the best strat-
egy. The retention rate in Tagliaferro 2011 was high (84% after
24 months). In the third glass ionomer study by Ji 2007, numbers
of decayed teeth were rather small in both treatment groups, es-
pecially after two years of follow-up (at 24 months 3.4% of sealed
surfaces and 4% of fluoride-varnished surfaces were decayed; cor-
responding figures at 36 months were 7.1% and 7.5%). Rates of
caries in control group teeth without intervention were 14% at 24
months and 21% at 36 months. Sealant retention was 60% after
three years.
Sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride
varnish alone
The German study with split-mouth design, which compared
resin sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish
alone, found that sealant given concurrently with fluoride varnish
was better than fluoride varnish alone at 24 months follow-up
(Splieth 2001). Children were examined semi annually for two
years, sealants were resealed if necessary and fluoride varnish was
23

 applied to all teeth at the time of examination (including the sealed
tooth). Study authors reported that the study was conducted in
the low-caries-risk population and that the retention rate of the
sealants was high (81%). However, the mean frequency of cario-
genic food intake per day was reported to be 15, including a large
number of sweetened drinks. Oral hygiene was moderate.
Adverse events and safety of sealants and fluoride varnishes
Three studies assessed or considered adverse events of sealants and
fluoride varnishes (Bravo 2005; Liu 2012; Tagliaferro 2011). In
these studies, participants did not detected or report any adverse
events.
However, some systematic reports have considered the possible
oestrogen-like effects of resin-based materials including bisphe-
nol A (BPA) (Azarpazhooh 2008b; Fleisch 2010). This synthetic
chemical resin is widely used in the production of plastic prod-
ucts intended for common life but are rarely used as such in den-
tal materials (ADA 2003). Dental resins include primarily BPA
derivatives (e.g. bis-GMA, bis-DMA) rather than pure BPA. These
derivatives can hydrolyse to BPA and can be detected transiently
in saliva (Arenholt 1999; Schmalz 1999). BPA has been detected
in saliva for up to three hours after application of resin sealants
(Fleisch 2010). Current evidence suggests that patients are not at
risk for oestrogen-like effects when sealants are used (ADA 2003;
Azarpazhooh 2008b; Fleisch 2010). The American Dental Asso-
ciation has concluded that estimated BPA exposure from dental
materials is recorded as very low compared with total estimated
daily BPA exposure from food and environmental sources (ADA
2003).
Fluoride varnishes are safe for dental care when used correctly
by professionals. Varnish sets rapidly when applied to teeth, and
most of the sodium fluoride applied will stay on the tooth surfaces
in natural resins (Chu 2006). Only a small dose of fluoride is
swallowedoverseveral hours,andriskof acute toxic reactions (such
as nausea and vomiting) is minimal (Bawden 1998; Seppä 1999).
Fluoride ingestion following a varnish application has been shown
to have barely detectable effects on plasma fluoride concentrations.
Ekstrand 1980 showed plasma fluoride peak concentrations of 3.2
to 6.3 µmol/L within two hours of Duraphat varnish application,
followedbyarapidtwo-hourdecrease. Contactallergiestofluoride
varnish due to colophony are possible but have been reported
in only two cases, both related to Duraphat varnish (Chu 2006;
Isaksson 1993).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Setting
Four of the eight included studies were conducted in the 2000s,
three in the 1990s and one in the 1980s. In most studies, children
were recruited from schools or public-oriented dental clinics. In
onlyone studywere childrenenrolledfromaprivate dental practice
(Splieth 2001). In general, these studies were conducted in well-
equipped dental settings.
Diagnosis
This review compared sealants versus fluoride varnishes for pre-
vention or control of caries, and we accepted studies with sound
occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars or with enamel lesions.
Four of the eight included studies reported applications only on
sound surfaces (Bravo 2005; Ji 2007; Salem 2014; Tagliaferro
2011); one study only on surfaces with enamel lesions (Florio
2001); and three studies on sound surfaces or on surfaces with
enamel lesions (Liu 2012; Raadal 1984; Splieth 2001). In addition
to clinical-tactile caries diagnostic methods, two of the eight stud-
ies used other diagnostic methods before applications. Liu 2012
used the DIAGNOdent laser fluorescence device (KaVo Dental
Corporation, Lake Zurich, IL, USA) to rule out molars with caries
in dentine and fissures with potential dentine caries, and Florio
2001 reported that digital radiographic and endoscopic examina-
tions were used to evaluate restricted enamel decay lesions.
Caries diagnosis on occlusal surfaces can, however, be challenging.
Conventional visual, tactile and radiographic methods in the di-
agnosis of occlusal caries have not been accurate enough to iden-
tify whether a lesion extends into the dentine (McComb 2001).
New technologies such as laser fluorescence methods (e.g. DI-
AGNOdent device) may be sensitive in detecting occlusal dentinal
caries (Bader 2004; Twetman 2013), but the likelihood of false-
positive diagnoses may increase when laser fluorescence is used
rather than visual methods (Bader 2004). Regardless of the caries
diagnostic method used, the condition of an occlusal surface to be
sealed or varnished remains in any case somewhat unclear.
Quality of the evidence
Sealant versus fluoride varnish
Resin-based sealants versus fluoride varnishes
The body of evidence comparing resin-based sealants versus flu-
oride varnishes comprises three randomised studies - two studies
reporting results at two years, and one at both four and nine years -
and was assessed as of low quality according to GRADE (Grades of
Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) as-
sessment criteria (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
This “low” quality rating implies that further research is very likely
to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates
of effects and is likely to change the estimates at each follow-up
point.
24
Pit and fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes for preventing dental decay in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The number of included trials with different designs and follow-
up times is too small to permit certain conclusions. The pooled
estimate of two studies slightly favoured resin sealants over fluoride
varnishes at two years (with OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94); these
studies otherwise were well conducted, but incomplete blinding of
outcome measurements can cause bias in the results. At four years
and nine years, the only study of these comparisons (with high
drop-out rates) found more caries on fluoride-varnished occlusal
surfaces than on resin-sealed surfaces.
The only study that showed similar effectiveness between resin
sealants and fluoride varnishes was conducted in the 2000s; the
other two studies (favouring sealants) were conducted earlier - in
the 1980s and in the 1990s. It has been stated that the progres-
sion rate of caries in permanent teeth has recently become slower
(Whelton 2004) and varies between populations, making conclu-
sions on the quality of evidence uncertain, especially when the
follow-up time is fairly short. Effectiveness of resin-based sealants
is strongly related to retention of sealant, and retention depends
also on follow-up time.
Glass ionomers and resin-modified glass ionomers versus
fluoride varnishes
We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for glass ionomer
sealants (one study with original chemically cured material, and
two studies with a light curable type modified with resin) com-
pared with fluoride varnishes as very low according to GRADE as-
sessment criteria (Summary of findings 2). This “very low” rating
implies that we are very uncertain about the estimates. Although
all three studies comparing glass ionomer versus fluoride varnish
reported similar results (no differences between interventions), we
downgraded the evidence by three levelsbecause of the small num-
bers of trials with different designs and follow-up times and as-
sessed as having high or unclear risk of bias. Further, Tagliaferro
2011 actually evaluated whether additional benefit was derived
from sealants and fluoride varnishes among children receiving reg-
ular oral health education.
Sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride
varnish alone
The body of evidence comparing resin-based sealant together with
fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish alone comprised one ran-
domised study at two years, and was assessed as of low quality
according to GRADE assessment criteria (Summary of findings
3). We downgraded the quality of evidence by two levels because
a single study (92 analysed participants) was conducted as early as
the 1990s and no information was provided on caries incidence of
control teeth without treatment, and although the study was oth-
erwise well conducted, lack of blinding of outcome measurement
can cause some further uncertainty about results.
Potential biases in the review process
Study design
With a split-mouth design, fluoride varnish applied to control
teeth might also impact teeth in the intervention group through
saliva. However, results of a split-mouth study show that fluo-
ride varnish application elevated fluoride concentrations of den-
tal plaque locally in the treated teeth quadrant but fluoride con-
centrations were not elevated in the opposite untreated quadrant
(Sköld-Larsson 2000). The carry-over effect of fluoride varnishes
most probably is dose dependent, and we assessed carry-over ef-
fects on sealed occlusal surfaces to be insignificant because they
have a fast-setting base and only a small amount of fluoride varnish
was applied to one or two control teeth. Therefore, we decided to
accept split-mouth studies into this review.
Reporting bias
We decided to consider only studies with a full-text report. We ex-
cluded studies reported only as abstracts because evidence showed
discrepancies between data reported in the abstract and those pro-
vided in the final published full report, and indicated that informa-
tion on trial quality indicators was often lacking (Chokkalingam
1998; Hopewell 2006). Thus we saw that the full-text report is
required to ensure reliable data extraction and assessment of risk
of bias. To diminish risk of publication bias, we contacted the au-
thors of potential abstracts to ask whether a full-text report of the
study (unpublished or published) was available.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
One other systematic review has considered dental sealants versus
fluoride varnishes (Neusser 2014). That review presented conclu-
sions based on the trials (also included in this review update) of
Bravo 2005, Raadal 1984 and Tagliaferro 2011, and on the pre-
vious version of this Cochrane systematic review (by Hiiri 2010).
The review by Neusser 2014 concluded, “The studies and litera-
ture reviews have shown protective effects of pit and fissure sealants
compared to the professional application of fluorides, particularly
in children and adolescents at high caries risk. However, because
of methodological flaws, the results of the RCTs should be inter-
preted with caution”.

Implications for practice
Although we found evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-
based fissure sealants over fluoride varnishes applied to prevent
25

 occlusal caries in permanent molars, and some evidence for benefit
of resin-based sealant together with fluoride varnish over fluoride
varnish alone, this evidence is of low quality. We conclude that
current scarce data mean that it is not possible to reach conclusions
about whether to apply sealants or fluoride varnishes on occlusal
surfaces of permanent molars.
Implications for research
The number of included clinical trials was small, and more high-
quality research is needed to compare the relative effectiveness of
sealants versus fluoride varnishes for preventing dental decay on
occlusal surfaces. With a split-mouth study design, the carry-over
effect of fluoride varnish applications on the sealed teeth cannot be
totally ruled out. Therefore, a parallel-group design would provide
more reliable information on differences in effectiveness of sealants
and fluoride varnishes. Proper documentation and description of
study populations, intervention study designs, follow-up periods,
drop-outsandoutcomesasdescribedinthe CONSORTstatement
are recommended.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Bravo 2005
Methods
Trial design: cluster-randomised design, where 15 school classes were randomly assigned
to 3 treatment arms. School classes were conducted at 5 primary schools, which were
selected at random from a group of 21 schools. Mean number of teeth per child was 3.
5 (a child was an additional cluster)
Follow-up period: 9 years: 4-year caries preventive programme, plus 5 years after active
programme
Study was started in 1990
Participants
Location: Spain, a non-fluoridated city (0.07 ppm F ion in tap water)
Children were from middle or lower-middle socioeconomic status families
Inclusion criteria: children with sound permanent first molars
Age at baseline: 6 to 8 years (average age 7 years)
Gender: girls 68% in sealant group, 47% in varnish group
Baseline caries: sealant group: mean dft 2.24 (SD 2.59); fluoride varnish group: 2.42
(SD 3.26)
Number randomly assigned: 362 (112 in sealant group; 115 in fluoride varnish group;
135 in control group)
Number evaluated: 75 (37 in sealant group; 38 in fluoride varnish group; 45 in control
group). Only children who (1) had at least 1 completely erupted and sound permanent
molar at any period during the active programme, and (2) were examined at 4-year
follow-up were included in the analysis at 9 years
Interventions
Comparison: resin-based sealant vs fluoride varnish
Group 1: visible-light-polymerised opaque Delton
Sealants were applied to completely erupted occlusal surfaces of permanent first molars
by 1 dentist plus an assistant, who used portable equipment. After 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36
months, sealant was applied to molars that had not previously erupted and was replaced
if partial or total loss had occurred since the previous examination
Group 2: fluoride varnish (Duraphat, sodium fluoride (NaF))
Varnish was applied to partially or fully erupted occlusal surfaces of permanent first
molars by 1 dentist plus an assistant, who used portable equipment. After 6, 12, 18,
24, 30, 36 and 42 months, varnish was also applied to newly erupted molars and was
reapplied to all those that were still sound
Group 3: control group without treatments
(Only sealant and fluoride varnish groups were used in this review)
Co-interventions: none reported
Outcomes
Sound or carious occlusal surface of molar
Outcomes were assessed by a dentist. Examinations were made with an exploration probe
and a flat mirror
Number of visits to the dentist for repair of sealant or fluoride varnish application

ity > 0.68 in all measurements
Sealant retention: complete sealant retention 63% at 4-year follow-up and 39% at 9-
year follow-up

university
Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
High risk
Quote from author correspondence: “Each
school-class was numbered. By using a list
of random numbers from a statistical book
each school-class was assigned to the 3
groups. When 1 group was full of chil-
dren (i.e. the sum of the children in the as-
signed school-classes was above the sample
size needed for a group), then that group
was excluded for new random assignations.
The school classes allocation was not com-
pletely random, since it had some restric-
tions: For example, the total number of
children should be at last more or less equi-
librated between the three groups (thus, af-
ter the first random assignment, the follow-
ing were conditional)”
Comment: Randomisation procedure was
not completely random
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
High risk
Comment: The non-random method used
for sequence generation would likely not
allow for allocation concealment
Blinding of outcome assessor (detection
bias)
Unclear risk
Quote: “A different dentist examined the
subjects in a blinded fashion”
Outcome assessor dentist did not have ac-
cess to previous records (information was
obtained from study authors)
Comment: Blinding of outcome asses-
sor was intended, but it remains unclear
whether outcome assessor had information
on study design
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

bined at 4 years (drop-out rates by group
not detailed)

ing ’unclear’ risk of bias because no in-
formation on drop-outs was provided by
group at 4 years of follow-up
At 9 years of follow-up, this domain was
graded as having ’high’ risk of bias because
proportion of participants assessed and in-
cluded in the analysis was 33% (only chil-
dren who had at least 1 completely erupted
and sound permanent molar at any time
period during the active programme, and
were examined at 4-year follow-up, were
included in the analysis at 9 years)
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
Outcomes reported: caries response and
sealant retention
Comment: Pre-specified outcomes (in
methods) were reported in a pre-specified
way
Other bias
Low risk
Comparability of groups:
Comment: Detailed description of demo-
graphic characteristics and caries risk level
at baseline was given for groups available
at 4 years and 9 years, and groups were as-
sessed to be comparable
Baseline mean dft in sealant group was 2.
24 (SD 2.59) and in fluoride varnish group
2.42 (SD 3.26). Mean age in sealant group
was 7.3 years, and in varnish group 7.
6 years. Proportion of girls was 68% in
sealant group and 47% in varnish group.
Although proportion of girls was bigger
in sealant group than in fluoride var-
nish group, assessment revealed that groups
were in balance at baseline
Co-interventions:
Quote: “The children received no tooth-
brushing, fluoride rinse, or fluoride tablet
programs”
Comment: This domain was graded as hav-
ing ’low’ risk of bias because no co-inter-
ventions were included in the protocol

Outcomes
Sound or carious occlusal surface of molar (caries in dentine ICDAS codes 4 to 6)
Each molar was assessed at 2 sites (upper molar - mesial pit/fossa and distal-palatal groove;
lower molar - occlusal fissure and buccal pit/groove). Caries incidence was reported as
child level, tooth level and fissure site level
Outcomes were assessed by the same blinded examiner using disposable mouth-mirrors
attached to an intra-oral LED (light-emitting diode) light and CPI (community peri-
odontal index) probes

Methods
Trial design: split-mouth design, sealant tooth randomly assigned
Follow-up: average 23 months
Participants
Location: Study setting was a public dental clinic in a small town in Norway
Inclusion criteria: Children had to have 1 recently erupted homomaxillary pair of per-
manent first molars. Occlusal surface was sound or had initial caries in enamel
Age at baseline: 6 to 9 years
Gender: 62 girls, 59 boys
Baseline caries: mean dmft 4.7 (SD 3.3)
Number randomly assigned: 121 children with total of 210 tooth site pairs (110 in
maxilla and 100 in mandible; in maxilla, mesial and distal portions of occlusal surface
were treated separately)
Number evaluated: No description of drop-outs regarding children was provided, but
information provided indicates that 208 of 210 sealed sites were evaluated (meaning that
1 child or 2 children were dropped out)
Interventions
Comparison: resin-based fissure sealant vs fluoride varnish
Tooth pair: occlusal surface of 1 tooth sealed with autopolymerised resin-based Concise;
on occlusal surface of the other tooth of the tooth pair, fluoride varnish (Duraphat,
sodium fluoride (NaF)) was applied
No information was provided on proportions of sound surfaces and teeth with enamel
lesions. Surfaces with initial caries in enamel were opened mechanically and caries re-
moved before sealant application (Quote from the article: “In those cases where caries
had progressed to the dentin, conventional cavities for amalgam fillings were prepared,
and these cases were excluded from the study”)
No resealing
Surfaces to be painted with fluoride varnish were treated every 6 months
Co-interventions: annual information and motivation about dental care; fluoride tablets
recommended; fluoride rinsing with 0.5% NaF solution at school
Outcomes
Sound or carious occlusal surface of molar
Caries status was recorded using visual-tactile method and bitewings

 Salem 2014
Methods
Trial design: cluster-randomised study design, where in 12 primary schools 2 classes from
each grade were randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms
Follow-up: 24 months
Study was started in 2009
The study was not considered in analyses of this review because results and data - complex
multi-level model with teeth nested in a child nested in a school class nested in a school
- were not in useable form for this review (unit of analysis was chosen to be a tooth
surface, but clustering of data was not taken into account in the analyses. Study author
gave the following additional information on analyses of the trial: “During study period
we found that the arrangement of pupils in each class is undergoing substantial changes
every year. Hence there was a combination of both groups in each class at the second
year and we decided to analyse the study population at surface level”)
Participants
Location: university clinic, Iran
Inclusion criteria: Children had to have ≥ 1 sound (by Nyvad criteria) and newly and
completely erupted first permanent molar with deep occlusal fissure
Age at baseline: 6 to 7 years
Gender: girls 38%, boys 62%
Baseline caries: sealant group: mean dmft index 4.41 (± 0.92); fluoride varnish group:
4.76 (± 2.75) (additional information was obtained from study authors)
Number randomly assigned: 400 children (sealant 200, varnish 200) with 1579 occlusal
surfaces (mean number of teeth 3.9 per child)
Number evaluated: 352 at 2 years (173 in sealant group, 179 in fluoride varnish group)
Interventions
Comparison: resin-based fissure sealant vs fluoride varnish
2 treatment arms
Group 1: resin-based sealant (Eco Seal), applied by dentist without assistant (additional
information obtained from study authors). Partially and completely lost sealants were
repaired/reapplied once if needed after 6 months
Group 2: sodium fluoride varnish (Durafluor, NaF 5%), applied biannually by dentist
without assistant (additional information obtained from study authors)
Co-interventions: All children participated in oral hygiene education sessions including
restriction of sugary snacks, regular toothbrushing and toothbrush and 1450 ppm fluo-
ride toothpaste given at every visit
Fluoride concentration of water during the years 2009 to 2012 at study area was in the
range of 0.45 to 0.8 ppm, on the basis of seasonal changes
Outcomes
Sound or carious occlusal surface of first molar: caries numbers for occlusal surfaces
scored by Nyvad criteria. DMFT and DMFS scores reported for whole tooth surfaces
One calibrated dentist carried out all examinations. Caries status was determined by 2
visual-tactile measures: WHO criteria (DMF) and Nyvad criteria applied
Notes
Intra-examiner reliability: Kappa co-efficient for Nyvad and WHO criteria was 0.79 and
0.81, respectively
Sealant retention: after 24 months: completely retained 43%, partial retention 46%,
total loss 11%

Methods
Trial design: split-mouth design, sealant tooth randomly assigned
Follow-up: 2 years
Study was started in 1995
Participants
Location: a private dental practice, Germany
Inclusion criteria: Children had to have ≥ 1 pair of equivalent first permanent molars
without carious defects (occlusal surface sound or with initial lesion in enamel)
Age at baseline: 5 to 8 years
Baseline caries: mean DMFS 0.2
Number randomly assigned: 98 children with 181 tooth pairs (on average 1.8 tooth pairs
per child)
Number evaluated: 92 at 2-year follow-up
Interventions
Comparison: resin-based fissure sealant plus fluoride varnish vs fluoride varnish alone
Tooth pair: occlusal surface of 1 tooth sealed with visible-light activated Fissurit Trans-
parent (VOCO GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany); occlusal surface of the other tooth of the
tooth pair applied with fluoride varnish (Duraphat, sodium fluoride (NaF))
Fluoride varnish was applied to all teeth including the sealed tooth
Children were examined semi annually for 2 years, sealants were resealed if necessary
and fluoride varnish was applied to all teeth at examinations
Co-interventions: Children were instructed on better oral hygiene and brushed their
teeth under supervision (Mean frequency of cariogenic food intake per day was 15,
including a large number of sweetened drinks. Oral hygiene was moderate)
5% of the children used fluoride tablets during the study
(Fluoride concentration of public water supply was 0.1 ppm)

Methods
Trial design: parallel-group study, 6 randomly assigned treatment arms
Follow-up: 24 months
Participants
Location: Children were from 2 public schools and lived in a low-caries-prevalence city,
Brazil
Inclusion criteria: Children had to have: (1) dmft ≥ 3 and/or ≥ 1 active cavitated lesion,
or dmft + DMFT = 0, and (2) ≥ 2 sound permanent first molars
Age at baseline: mean age 7 years
Gender: 52% girls, 48% boys
Baseline caries: Mean (SD) dmft index was 4.51 (2.81) for HRS group and 4.28 (2.54)
for HRV group. In low-caries-risk groups (LRS, LRV groups), dmft + DMFT was zero
Number randomly assigned: 327 children with mean number (SD) of occlusal surfaces
treated 3.47 (0.80)
Numbers of children per group: 57 in HRC group; 57 in HRV group; 55 in HRS group;
53 in LRC group; 52 in LRV group; 53 in LRS group
Number evaluated: 268 at 24 months (44 children in HRC group; 48 in HRV group;

ment)
(Only sealant and fluoride varnish groups were considered in this review: groups 2, 3, 5
and 6)
Sealants were applied by dentist assisted by dental hygienist in dental office (sealants were
applied to healthy permanent first molars). Procedure consisted of 4 stages: etching tooth
surfaces with 37% phosphoric acid, primer application, ionomer application, finishing
gloss application
No resealing
Fluoride varnish (Duraphat, sodium fluoride (NaF)) was applied by dentist assisted by
dental hygienist, at schools in well-lit areas, under natural light. Duraphat was applied
to occlusal surfaces of sound first permanent molars. Participants were informed to not
brush their teeth or chew food for ≥ 2 hours after treatment, and to consume only soft
foods and liquids for 24 hours
Oral health education was carried out by dentist assisted by dental hygienist. Sessions
lasting 1 hour were held every 3 months, with talks covering themes such as dental caries,
dental plaque and fluoride. Oral hygiene instructions, supervised tooth brushing and
dietary counselling were presented to children by means of lectures, videos, educational
games and oral quizzes
Co-interventions: 93% of children used fluoridated dentifrice. Average fluoride concen-
tration in tap water was 0.7 ppm
Outcomes
Sound or carious occlusal surface of first permanent molar: Caries increment was stated
as mean DMF (decayed, missing and filled) scores
One calibrated dentist carried out all examinations. Diagnosis was based on clinical
examination, and no radiographs were taken at baseline or at final examinations
Adverse events
Notes
Intra-examiner reliability: Kappa coefficients 0.95 (caries as cavitated lesions) and 0.90
(caries as cavitated and non-cavitated lesions)

Children were systematically allocated to
each treatment group as follows: Approx-
imately 10 children were taken from each
classroom at random by a dental hygienist.
The hygienist did not know the caries risk
of each child. The hygienist organized the
10 children in a queue at random. (In the

inclusion criteria of the study; those chil-
dren were excluded after baseline exami-
nation by a dentist). The examiner (Pardi
V) performed the examination of the first
child in the queue, and the main researcher
(Tagliaferro EP) recorded data on a specific
form and classified the child as having high
or low caries risk, according to pre-estab-
lished criteria. After each examination day,
record forms were organised according to
caries risk (low or high) and sequence of
examination. After this, for example, the
first examined child of that day classified as
having high risk of caries was systematically
allocated to the control group, the second
to the varnish group and the third to the
sealant group, and successively. Each child
was given an ID code to be used over the
whole study period
Comment: This domain was graded as hav-
ing ’low’ risk of bias because we saw that the
randomisation procedure as a whole was
un-systematic when noting to which treat-
ment group each child was finally allocated
Allocation concealment (selection bias)

Additional information was obtained from
study authors
The main researcher (Tagliaferro) called
children for treatments as follows: Children
allocated to sealant groups were brought
to a clinical setting, their names and treat-
ment group were checked and Tagliaferro
applied sealants, with the help of a den-
tal hygienist. Then, at another time, Tagli-
aferro went to the school, called the chil-
dren allocated to varnish groups and per-
formedvarnish applications. The processof
calling only children allocated to sealant or
varnish groups, when sealant applications
or varnish applications were performed, re-
spectively, ensured that each child really re-
ceived the intended treatment
Comment: This domain was graded as hav-
ing ’low’ risk of bias because we saw that
despite incomplete allocation concealment
(the same main researcher kept the records
and made the applications), the large num-
ber of children in each allotted group and

Table 2. Criteria for ’Risk of bias’ assessment
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Was the method used to generate the al-
location sequence appropriate to produce
comparable groups?
We graded this domain to ’low’ risk of bias
if study authors described a random com-
ponent in the sequence generation process
(e.g. random number table, coin tossing,
drawing of lots). If information about the
random sequence generation process was
not provided or was insufficient, we graded
this domain to ’unclear’ risk
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Was the method used to conceal the allo-
cation sequence appropriate to prevent the
allocation from being known in advance of,
or during, enrolment?
We graded this domain to ‘low’ risk of
bias if study authors described adequate
concealment (e.g. by means of central
randomisation, or sequentially numbered,
opaque and sealed envelopes) and to ’high’
risk of bias if inadequate concealment was
documented (e.g. alternation, use of case
record numbers, date of birth or day of the
week) or if allocation concealment was not
used. If insufficient or no information on
allocation concealment was provided, the
judgement was graded ‘unclear’ risk

 Table 2. Criteria for ’Risk of bias’ assessment
(Continued)
Blinding (performance bias)
We did not carry out assessment of blind-
ing of participants and personnel in this re-
view because we think that personnel and
participants potentially knowing which of
the 2 active preventive treatments a child
is given is unlikely to cause bias (e.g. affect
dental behaviour of a child during the trial,
especially when follow-up is long (≥ 1 year
in this review))
Blinding of outcome assessment (detec-
tion bias)
Were outcome assessors blinded to the in-
tervention a participant had received?
As sealant materials are visible, blinding of
the outcome assessor is possible only if a
sealant has been lost. Thus outcome mea-
surement is related to sealant retention and
blinding of outcome assessor is usually im-
possible. On the other hand, it is difficult
to assess how likely (or not likely) it is that
the outcome measurement is influenced by
lackof blindingof outcome assessorsinpre-
ventive sealant studies.
We decided to grade this domain as hav-
ing ’low’ risk of bias if study authors stated
that the outcome assessor was not involved
in the study design, and as having ’unclear’
risk of bias if the study simply reported
blinded outcome assessment or if blind-
ing was indicated (e.g. examinations per-
formed independently of previous records,
outcome assessors not involved in apply-
ing treatments). If a trial reported nothing
about blinding of outcome measurement,
our judgement was ’high’ risk of bias in this
domain
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
How complete were the outcome data for
primary caries outcomes? Were drop-out
rates and reasons for withdrawals reported?
Were missing data imputed appropriately?
In caries prevention studies, follow-up
times can last several years. Studies with
long follow-up have the problem of high
drop-out rates causing uncertainty about
data. We decided to base the judgement of
this domain on caries efficacy outcome at
24 or 36 months (commonly used follow-
up times in sealant studies). When both fol-
low-up times were reported, we based our
judgement on 24 months. If either of these
2 follow-up times was not reported, we
based our judgement on the first caries effi-
cacy outcome reported in the study (which
in this review should be ≥ 1 year). How-

 Table 2. Criteria for ’Risk of bias’ assessment
(Continued)
ever, the risk of bias was assessed separately
and was reported in the ’Risk of bias’ ta-
ble for caries outcomes despite follow-up
times, and the assessments were taken into
account in the overall risk of bias assess-
ment for caries outcomes within a study
We decided to grade this domain as having
’low’ risk of bias if the total proportion of
missing outcome data was marginal (< 5%)
; or if the proportion of missing outcome
data was < 25% regardless of the follow-
up time and groups (in parallel-group stud-
ies) were balanced in numbers for missing
data; or if missing data have been imputed
using appropriate methods. If no informa-
tion on reasons for drop-out across inter-
vention groups was provided, or if the pro-
portion of missing data was documented
as total proportion (5% to 25%), not by
group in parallel-group studies, our judge-
ment was ’unclear’ risk. Classifying missing
data > 25% as having ’high’ risk of bias in
all study designs was a pragmatic approach
to this domain to make the judgement uni-
form and transparent. If several teeth were
sealedinachild’smouth (achildisacluster)
, missing outcome data had to be stated (or
counted) at child level (not at tooth level)
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Were appropriate outcomes reported and
were key outcomes missing?
To be included in this review, caries out-
comes had to be reported. However, studies
could report the outcome in different ways,
for example, incidence of dentinal carious
lesion on treated occlusal surfaces of molars
or premolars (yes or no); changes in mean
figures of decayed, missing and filled sur-
faces (DMFS); or progression of caries le-
sion into enamel or dentine. In this review,
selective outcome reporting was graded as
’low’ risk of bias if the study’s pre-specified
caries outcomes had been reported in the
pre-specified way
Other sources of bias
This domain included information on
comparability of intervention and control
groups, and possible use of co-interven-
tions by group
Comparability of groups
We decided to base our judgement of com-
parability of groups on baseline informa-
tion given to groups available at follow-up
times because if only information provided
at the start of the study is available, it is im-
60

(Continued)
possible to assess whether groups are bal-
anced with each other after follow-up time
as well. The comparability of groups after
follow-up is especially problematic when
small studies include children with several
teeth and the drop-out rate is high, even if
drop-outs are balanced in numbers and rea-
sons between groups. If no information on
the groups was available at follow-up time,
we decided that if the drop-out rate (re-
gardless of follow-up time) was < 25% and
drop-outs were balanced in numbers and
reasons by group, our judgement would be
based on information given for groups at
the start of the study
We decided to grade this domain as hav-
ing ‘low’ risk of bias if groups were bal-
anced in demographic characteristics (such
as sex, age and social class) and in baseline
caries risk level, or if possible imbalance
of groups at baseline and/or after follow-
up had been taken adequately into account
in the analyses. If baseline characteristics
in parallel-group studies were not given to
groups available at follow-up and the drop-
out rate was > 25%, we graded the study as
having ‘unclear’ risk
Co-interventions
We decided to grade this domain as having
‘low’ risk of bias if groups were balanced
in number and quality of co-interventions,
or if no co-interventions were included in
the protocol, and as having ‘high’ risk of
bias if groups received different numbers
or quality of co-interventions during the
trial. If no information was provided on co-
interventions, our judgement was ’unclear’
risk
