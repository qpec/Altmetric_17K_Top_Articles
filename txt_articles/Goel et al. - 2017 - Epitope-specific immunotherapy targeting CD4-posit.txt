SUMMARY 
45 
 
46 
Background Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only management available for celiac disease (CeD), 
47 
a permanent immune intolerance to gluten. Nexvax2® is the first therapeutic vaccine designed to 
48 
treat CeD. The adjuvant-free formulation of peptides is intended to engage and render gluten-
49 
specific CD4+ T cells unresponsive to further antigenic stimulation. We have assessed safety and 
50 
pharmacodynamics of Nexvax2® in patients with CeD on GFD. 
51 
 
52 
Methods In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 studies at 12 community 
53 
sites in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, we screened for HLA-DQ2·5+ CeD 
54 
patients (aged 18–70 years) on GFD. The screening and post-treatment periods included either a 
55 
crossover, placebo-controlled, oral gluten challenge (OGC) to mobilize and assess T cells 
56 
responsive to Nexvax2 or, for the final cohort in each study, endoscopy and duodenal histology 
57 
without OGC. Participants and study staff were masked to the gluten content of food provided 
58 
for each interval of the OGCs. One of two sequences of active and placebo challenges was 
59 
assigned (1:1) by central randomization using a simple block method. The sequence of 
60 
challenges was active/placebo then active/placebo, or placebo/active then active/placebo for the 
61 
OGCs in the screening and post-treatment periods, respectively. Participants with a negative 
62 
interferon (IFN)-γ release assay (IGRA) to Nexvax2 peptides after the screening OGC, or Marsh 
63 
score >1 were discontinued before dosing. There was temporal allocation of participants to 
64 
sequential cohorts assessing multiple fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 (60µg, 90µg, or 150µg 
65 
weekly in the 3-dose study; or 150µg, or 300µg two-times weekly in the 16-dose study) in 0.1 
66 
mL 0.9% sodium chloride. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was administered in the final 
67 
biopsy cohort in each study. Participants within each cohort were assigned to receive Nexvax2 or 
68 
placebo by central randomization (2:1, respectively) using simple block method in SAS software 
69 
Version 9·2. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to the treatment assignment, 
70 
except for the study pharmacist. The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of 
71 
adverse events in the treatment period.  Other safety outcomes included duodenal histology, 
72 
gastrointestinal symptoms, plasma cytokines, and immune cell frequencies. The main 
73 
pharmacodynamic endpoint was IGRA to Nexvax2 peptides. All participants who received 
74 
Nexvax2 or placebo, the safety population, were included in an intention to treat analysis for the 
75 
primary endpoint. Additional post hoc analyses were also performed. Both trials were completed 
76 
and closed before data analysis. Trials were registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical 
77 
Trials Registry, numbers ACTRN12612000355875 and ACTRN12613001331729. 
78 
 
79 
Findings Participants were screened from November 28, 2012 to August 14, 2014, and August 
80 
3, 2012 to September 10, 2013, for the 3-dose and 16-dose studies respectively. Across both 
81 
studies, 136 (80%) of 169 volunteers met initial eligibility criteria. After OGC, 62 (57%) of 108 
82 
participants were randomized, and after endoscopy 20 (71%) of 28 participants were 
83 
randomized. The number of participants in the 3-dose study randomly allocated to placebo or 
84 
active treatment arms were 3 and 9 in the first cohort assessing Nexvax2 60 µg, 4 and 9 in the 
85 
second cohort assessing Nexvax2 90 µg, and 4 and 8 in the third cohort, and 3 and 3 in final 
86 
(biopsy) cohort, which both assessed Nexvax2 150 µg. The number of participants in the 16-dose 
87 
study randomly allocated to receive placebo or active treatment were 4 and 8 in the first cohort 
88 
assessing Nexvax2 150 µg, 3 and 10 in the second cohort assessing Nexvax2 300 µg, and 7 and 7 
89 
in the final (biopsy) cohort which assessed Nexvax2 150 µg. The MTD for Nexvax2 was 150 µg 
90 
  
 
3 
due to transient, acute gastrointestinal adverse events with onset at 2 to 5 h after initial doses of 
91 
Nexvax2, similar to those caused by gluten ingestion. The total number of treatment emergent 
92 
adverse events and percentage (%) of participants with at least one in the ascending dose cohorts 
93 
of the 3-dose study were 15 (55%) in the 11 placebo-treated participants, 25 (56%) in 9 who 
94 
received Nexvax2 60µg, 65 (78%) in 9 who received Nexvax2 90µg, and 16 (63%) in 8 who 
95 
received Nexvax2 150µg, and 7 (100%) in the 3 placebo-treated participants and 1 (33%) in 3 
96 
participants randomized to Nexvax2 150µg in the biopsy cohort; in the 16-dose study, there were 
97 
13 (71%) in 7 placebo-treated participants, 21 (75%) 8 who received Nexvax2 150µg, 26 (100%) 
98 
in 10 who received Nexvax2 300µg, and 24 (86%) in the 7 placebo-treated participants and 18 
99 
(71%) in 7 who received Nexvax2 150µg in the biopsy cohort. Vomiting, nausea and headache 
100 
were the only treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of participants in 
101 
either study. The total number of treatment emergent adverse events and percentage (%) of 
102 
participants with at least one occurrence were: vomiting: 2 (22%) in 9 participants receiving 
103 
Nexvax2 60µg, 5 (56%) in 9 receiving Nexvax2 90µg, 4 (50%) in 8 receiving Nexvax2 150µg in 
104 
the 3-dose study; and 5 (63%) in 8 receiving Nexvax2 150µg, 4 (40%) in 10 receiving Nexvax2 
105 
300µg, 1 (14%) in 7 participants receiving placebo in the biopsy cohort of the 16-dose study; 
106 
nausea: 1 (11%) with Nexvax2 60µg, 4 (44%) with Nexvax2 90µg, and 2 (25%) with Nexvax2 
107 
150µg in the 3-dose study, and none in the 16-dose study; headache: 4 (44%) with Nexvax2 
108 
90µg in the 3-dose study; and 3 (43%) for placebo in the 1st and 2nd cohorts, 3 (38%) with 
109 
Nexvax2 150µg, 5 (50%) with Nexvax2 300µg, and 3 (43%) for placebo and 2 (29%) with 
110 
Nexvax2 150µg in the biopsy cohort of the 16-dose study. Among Nexvax2-treated participants 
111 
administered the MTD, the number of gastrointestinal treatment emergent adverse events were 8 
112 
in 4 (50%) of 8 participants in the 3rd cohort and none (0%) in 3 participants in the biopsy cohort 
113 
of the 3-dose study, and 5 in 5 (63%) of 8 participants in the 1st cohort and 3 in 2 (29%) of 7 
114 
participants in the biopsy cohort of the 16-dose study. For the biopsy cohort of the 16-dose study, 
115 
which tested the MTD, Nexvax2 was associated with 5 mild and 2 moderate drug‑related adverse 
116 
events in 4 (57%) of 7 participants compared to 5 mild adverse events in 3 (43%) of 7 placebo-
117 
treated participants. Comparing biopsies from screening and after the treatment period, median 
118 
[interquartile range] villous height to crypt depth ratio in distal duodenal biopsies was not 
119 
significantly different for Nexvax2 at the MTD with 3 doses over 15 days (2.04 [0.69] versus 
120 
2.49 [0·67], n=2), or 16 doses over 53 days (1·74 [0·54] versus 1·56 [0·58], n=7), and for 
121 
placebo over 15 days (1.75 [0.62] versus 2.09 [0.71], n=3) or 16 doses over 53 days (2·10 [0·25] 
122 
versus 1·92 [0·35], n=7). In those participants who completed the post-treatment OGC per 
123 
protocol, IGRA was negative in 2 (22%) of 9 placebo-treated participants in the 3 dose study 
124 
compared to 2 (33%) of 6 who received Nexvax2 60 µg, 5 (63%) of 8 who received Nexvax2 90 
125 
µg, and 6 (100%) of 6 who received Nexvax2 150 µg (p=0.007); and in 0 (0%) of 5 placebo-
126 
treated participants in the 16 dose study compared to 6 (75%) of 8 who received Nexvax2 150 µg 
127 
(p=0.021). 
128 
 
129 
Interpretation The maximum dose tolerated for Nexvax2 was established as 150µg for two-
130 
times weekly intradermal administration over 8 weeks. Administering Nexvax2 at the MTD for 8 
131 
weeks modified immune responsiveness to Nexvax2 peptides without deterioration in duodenal 
132 
histology. The gastrointestinal symptoms that followed the first intradermal administration of 
133 
Nexvax2 resembled those associated with oral gluten challenge. These findings support 
134 
continued clinical development of Nexvax2 as a potential therapeutic vaccine for CeD.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
137 
 
138 
Evidence before this study We searched for reviews of emerging treatments for celiac disease 
139 
(CeD) published before Aug 24, 2016 in PubMed using the terms “Celiac disease” or “coeliac 
140 
disease”, and “non-dietary therapy”, “immunotherapy”, or “vaccine”. We found 20 reviews of 
141 
new treatments in development for CeD published since 2009, which confirmed that there are no 
142 
therapeutics approved specifically for the treatment of CeD. We also searched Clinicaltrials.gov 
143 
on Aug 24, 2016 for clinical trials using the terms “celiac disease therapy”, “peptide-based 
144 
immunotherapy”, “peptide immunotherapy”, “antigen-specific immunotherapy”, “epitope-
145 
specific immunotherapy”, and “specific immunotherapy”. In total, we found clinical trials 
146 
assessing 16 different agents for CeD, but Nexvax2 was the only antigen-specific therapeutic and 
147 
none was at a stage of development more advanced than phase 2. These searches identified only 
148 
2 studies that assessed effects of immunogenic peptides for autoimmune diseases, both for type-1 
149 
diabetes (NCT01536431 and, not yet commenced, NCT02837094). The authors are also aware 
150 
of two other recent clinical trials using immunogenic peptides for multiple sclerosis 
151 
(NCT01097668 and NCT01973491).  
152 
 
153 
Added value of this study The clinical effects and therapeutic potential of peptides recognized 
154 
by disease-specific CD4+ T cells has not been systematically evaluated in clinical autoimmune 
155 
diseases. Unlike other autoimmune diseases, the peptides responsible for the disease-specific 
156 
CD4+ T-cell response to gluten associated with CeD are well characterized. Nexvax2 is the first 
157 
antigen-specific immunotherapy under development for CeD and is an adjuvant-free solution of 
158 
three peptides with immunodominant HLA-DQ2·5-restricted epitopes. The effects of 
159 
systemically administered gluten peptides have not previously been tested. Intradermal 
160 
administration of Nexvax2 in HLA-DQ2·5+ CeD participants initially caused gastrointestinal 
161 
symptoms similar in timing and quality to those triggered by gluten ingestion. Adverse events 
162 
after later administrations of Nexvax2 were no different from placebo. A maximum tolerated 
163 
dose of Nexvax2 was established as 150 µg. There was no evidence of deterioration in duodenal 
164 
histology following two-times weekly intradermal administrations over eight weeks with 
165 
Nexvax2 150 µg. The recall immune response to gluten was modified in CeD participants 
166 
receiving Nexvax2 consistent with T cells specific for epitopes in Nexvax2 were rendered 
167 
unresponsive to further antigenic stimulation.   
168 
 
169 
Implications of all the available evidence Repeated small, fixed doses of adjuvant-free peptides 
170 
including immunodominant epitopes for gluten-specific CD4+ T cells are capable of modifying 
171 
the recall immune response to gluten in CeD patients without causing duodenal injury. The 
172 
clinical effects of systemically administering immunodominant epitopes for gluten-specific 
173 
CD4+ T cells are at first similar to the gastrointestinal symptoms following gluten ingestion in 
174 
CeD patients on GFD, but later doses are well tolerated with effects similar to placebo. These 
175 
findings are consistent with Nexvax2 peptides engaging and rendering gluten-specific CD4+ T 
176 
cells unresponsive to further antigenic stimulation. Further assessment and clinical development 
177 
of antigen-specific immunotherapy for CeD using immunogenic gluten peptides is justified, and 
178 
may inform the design, immune monitoring, and clinical development of this novel therapeutic 
179 
class for autoimmune diseases.

INTRODUCTION 
181 
 
182 
Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune-like disease due to dietary gluten characterized by the 
183 
presence of highly specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 and damage of epithelial cells in 
184 
the small intestine.1 The community prevalence of CeD is about 1% in children and adults in 
185 
many regions including Europe and North America.2 Clinical investigation for CeD is usually 
186 
prompted by digestive symptoms, associated co-morbidities such as iron deficiency, or screening 
187 
family members of probands.2 Abnormal CeD-specific serology and duodenal histology showing 
188 
villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and intra-epithelial lymphocytosis support the diagnosis of 
189 
CeD.2 Currently, the only management for CeD is life-long gluten-free diet (GFD).2 However, 
190 
GFD is burdensome, and restrictive in social situations, resulting in reduced quality of life and, 
191 
ultimately, non-adherence.3,4 Consequently, GFD seldom results in complete clinical and 
192 
histological recovery. 
193 
 
194 
CeD has a remarkably strong association with certain Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) 
195 
haplotypes that accounts for almost half of the total heritable risk of CeD.5 About 90% of 
196 
patients possess the MHC class II genes HLA-DQA1*05 and HLA-DQB1*02 that together 
197 
encode the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) heterodimer HLA-DQ2·5.6 HLA-DQ2·5 
198 
homozygosity is associated with augmented T-cell activation by gluten peptides.7  
199 
 
200 
MHC class II heterodimers serve a central role in antigen presentation and the induction and 
201 
maintenance of acquired cellular immune responses.8 The complex formed by short, antigen-
202 
derived peptides (epitopes) loaded into the binding groove of MHC class II molecules bind to the 
203 
T cell antigen receptor (TCR) of CD4+ T cells, which results in highly specific antigen 
204 
recognition and antigen-specific activation. CD4+ T cells specific for HLA-DQ2.5-restricted 
205 
gluten peptides that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon(IFN)-γ can be isolated 
206 
from intestinal tissue.9 One week after commencing a 3-day gluten food challenge, these same 
207 
CD4+ T cells circulate in blood at increased frequencies.10 The amino acid sequence of 
208 
immnodominant epitopes recognized by gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells are well established, and 
209 
are highly consistent amongst HLA-DQ2.5+ CeD patients.9-14 
210 
 
211 
Epitope-specific immunotherapy is a form of antigen-specific immunotherapy that uses peptides 
212 
instead of whole antigen to target and modify CD4+ T cells.15 In general, higher doses and 
213 
longer duration of antigen-specific immunotherapy are most clinically effective.16 Evidence 
214 
supports that clinical benefit is related to disease-specific CD4+ T cells transitioning from being 
215 
responsive to antigenic stimulation to a state of reversible functional unresponsiveness (anergy), 
216 
induction of suppressive regulatory T cells, and eventually, over longer periods, to deletion and 
217 
durable immune tolerance.16  
218 
 
219 
Gluten itself is not suitable for a therapeutic vaccine because it is insoluble, requires deamidation 
220 
for full immunogenicity, and some gluten peptides and contaminants have direct innate immune 
221 
activity.17,18 Nexvax2® is an adjuvant-free, particle-free solution of three, highly soluble, 
222 
synthetic peptides with 15 or 16 amino acids (NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003) (appendix p 10). 
223 
Nexvax2 has been designed and developed as an epitope-specific immunotherapy for HLA-
224 
DQ2.5+ CeD, which is further described in the appendix (pp 6-7). Nexvax2 encompasses at least 
225 
five immunodominant epitopes that selectively bind to HLA-DQ2.5 and activate gluten-reactive 
226 
  
 
6 
CD4+ T cells isolated from HLA-DQ2·5+ CeD patients (appendix p 10 and p 27).14 These 
227 
peptides include sequences recognized by anti-gliadin antibodies,19 but are short enough to 
228 
minimize the likelihood of complement activation by immune complex formation and antibody-
229 
mediated hypersensitivity.20  
230 
 
231 
Our aim was to assess safety and pharmacodynamics of repeated intradermal administrations of 
232 
Nexvax2 in regimens that could potentially modify gluten-specific immunity in HLA-DQ2·5+ 
233 
CeD patients on GFD.  
234 
 
235 
METHODS 
236 
 
237 
Study design 
238 
Two separate randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1 studies were conducted. We 
239 
tested Nexvax2 administered as 3 fixed doses at weekly intervals over 15 days (“3-dose study”), 
240 
or 16 fixed doses at 3 or 4-day intervals over 53 days (“16-dose study”) (appendix p 29). The 
241 
studies were designed to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by testing incremental dose 
242 
increases in a series of ascending dose cohorts. To mobilize gluten-specific T cells in blood and 
243 
allow assessments of their responsiveness to epitopes in Nexvax2, the screening period and post-
244 
treatment period for ascending dose cohorts included a crossover, double-blind, placebo-
245 
controlled, oral gluten challenge (OGC). After the MTD was established, a “biopsy” cohort was 
246 
enrolled in each study to test whether duodenal histology deteriorated following fixed dose 
247 
administration of Nexvax2 at the MTD. Participants in biopsy cohorts did not have OGC before 
248 
or after the treatment period to avoid the confounding effect of OGC on duodenal histology. 
249 
Study sites are listed in the appendix (p 3). The studies were conducted concurrently with the 16-
250 
dose study recruiting exclusively from community sites in Australia and New Zealand, and the 3-
251 
dose study initially recruiting exclusively from community sites in the United States. After 
252 
completion of the 16-dose study, participants for the second and later cohorts in the 3-dose study 
253 
were also recruited sites in Australia and New Zealand. Approval was granted by local ethics 
254 
committees listed in the appendix (pp 3-4). These studies were conducted according to the 
255 
International Conference on Harmonisation harmonised tripartite guideline E6(R1): Good 
256 
Clinical Practice. Research Assist (Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA) and CPR Pharma Services 
257 
(Thebarton, South Australia, Australia) managed the studies.  
258 
 
259 
Participants 
260 
The intended study population was patients who were HLA-DQ2·5+ with CeD on a GFD. 
261 
Participants shown to be immunologically responsive to Nexvax2 assessed by whole IFN-γ 
262 
release assay (IGRA) six days after commencing active gluten challenge during the screening 
263 
period OGC were used to determine the MTD. Participants considered to be in histological 
264 
remission at the screening endoscopy were used to assess the effects of Nexvax2 on duodenal 
265 
histology. Inclusion criteria required that participants be aged 18 – 70 years, have had a 
266 
diagnosis of CeD supported by histology and serology,21 followed a GFD for over one year, and 
267 
were HLA-DQ2·5+. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the appendix (pp 4-5). For 
268 
randomization to treatment, participants in ascending dose cohorts required a positive IGRA to 
269 
Nexvax2 peptides on screening day 6 or 13 that had returned to negative one week before 
270 
dosing, and participants in biopsy cohorts were required to have duodenal histology at the 
271 
  
 
7 
screening gastroscopy that was consistent with modified Marsh type 0 or 1 (no villous atrophy or 
272 
crypt hyperplasia). All participants provided written informed consent before enrolment. 
273 
 
274 
Randomization and masking 
275 
Trial sites assessed consecutive volunteers for eligibility. For each study, ascending dose cohorts 
276 
were enrolled stepwise, beginning with the lowest dose level, and when they were complete the 
277 
biopsy cohort was enrolled. Participants in ascending dose cohorts began the screening period 
278 
with an OGC. The ordering of the gluten-containing (active) and gluten-free (placebo) 
279 
challenges in the screening period was randomized with half the participants receiving active 
280 
first, and the other half receiving placebo first. Allocation of participants to the order they 
281 
received active and placebo gluten challenges in the screening period was by central 
282 
randomization using simple block method with block size 200. Active was always before 
283 
placebo gluten challenge in the post-treatment OGC. Cookies used in OGC were matched in 
284 
physical appearance, consistency, and taste (appendix p 30). Participants were allocated active 
285 
(Nexvax2) or placebo treatment by central randomization using a simple block method (block 
286 
size 12) in a 2:1 schema for ascending dose cohorts, and 1:1 in biopsy cohorts. The appearance 
287 
of syringes, drug product, and volume injected for active and placebo treatment administered in 
288 
each trial were identical. Enrolment in cohorts and allocation of OGC sequence or treatment 
289 
were not stratified for any additional factors. Replacements were allowed, and received the same 
290 
treatment as the participant they replaced. The randomization mechanism for the study was 
291 
deployed by sites completing a randomization request that was sent to the un-blinded statistician 
292 
at CRC Pharma Services (Parsippany, NJ, USA) who provided the randomization number to the 
293 
study site and notified the packager and distributor for OGC cookies (3-dose study: for sites in 
294 
the USA: Research Assist, and for other sites: Pharmaceutical Packaging Professionals Pty Ltd., 
295 
Port Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and for the 16-dose study cookies were provided direct to sites 
296 
by the manufacturer, Shepherd Works, Boxhill North, Victoria, Australia), and for 
297 
investigational product (Catalent Pharma Solutions; Allendale, NJ, USA). In the 3-dose study 
298 
investigational product was provided in prefilled syringes with the site pharmacist being masked 
299 
to treatment allocation. In the 16-dose study, the unmasked site pharmacist was responsible for 
300 
diluting stock Nexvax2 9 mg/ml from labeled vials using USP 0.9% sodium chloride to the 
301 
required concentration in 0.1 mL, or to draw USP 0.9% sodium chloride (0.1 mL) into a 1 mL 
302 
syringes. The un-blinded statistician at CRC Pharma Services was provided the randomization 
303 
schedule prepared by the central statistician, who was based at CPR Pharma Services, and had no 
304 
responsibility for monitoring or data management, prepared randomization schedules using SAS 
305 
software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) Version 9·2. The unmasked statistician 
306 
at CRC Pharma, the packager and distributor of cookies and investigational product,  and the 
307 
pharmacist in the 16-dose study were the only other study personnel with copies of the 
308 
randomization schedules. All study participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor 
309 
personnel and study site personnel remained blinded to study treatment assignment until the 
310 
analyses were completed.  
311 
 
312 
Procedures 
313 
For ascending dose cohorts, the screening period began on day 1 with participants being 
314 
provided nine cookies to eat 3 per day on days 1 to 3. When participants returned on day 8 they 
315 
were provided another set of nine cookies for days 8 to 10. Cookies in each set either contained 
316 
gluten (3 g per cookie), or were gluten-free (Shepherd Works). Patients with T cells responsive 
317 
  
 
8 
to epitopes in Nexvax2 were identified using fresh blood and overnight IGRA.22 IGRAs were 
318 
performed with Nexvax2 peptides, and recall viral antigens on days 1, 6, 8, 13, and 29. Plasma 
319 
cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell frequencies were also measured on day 1 (before 
320 
cookies were eaten) and 13. If IGRA to Nexvax2 peptides became negative on day 29 the 
321 
treatment period commenced one week later, but if IGRA remained positive it was repeated 
322 
weekly until it became negative and the pre-treatment period was extended up to 49 days. For the 
323 
biopsy cohorts, the screening period was 35 days with a gastroscopy between days 15 and 28; 
324 
modified Marsh type was determined in duplicate biopsies collected from the bulb, 1st, 2nd, and 
325 
3rd parts of the duodenum to assess eligibility.  
326 
 
327 
Three, weekly intradermal injections of placebo or Nexvax2 60µg, 90µg, or 150µg in 0·1 mL 
328 
were administered in the 3-dose study. In the 16-dose study, 16 two-times weekly doses of 
329 
placebo or Nexvax2 150µg, or 300µg in 0·1 mL were administered. Injections administered by 
330 
study staff on site alternated between the supra-deltoid regions on each arm. When at least six 
331 
participants who received active treatment had completed at least two weeks of treatment, and if 
332 
the Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) considered that masked clinical and laboratory pathology 
333 
safety assessments showed an acceptable safety profile according to predefined criteria described 
334 
in the appendix (p 5), dosage was increased in the next cohort. For additional consideration of 
335 
safety data and the decision to dose-escalate or discontinue dosing the DEC could consult the 
336 
independent safety monitor, a designated member of the independent data safety monitoring 
337 
board (DSMB), or the full DSMB, which could have access to unmasked safety data. MTD was 
338 
the highest dose reviewed and approved by the DEC.  
339 
 
340 
Safety assessments included the incidence, severity, and dose relation of adverse events. To elicit 
341 
adverse events, at every study visit, participants were asked, “Have you had any health problems 
342 
since the previous visit or when you were last asked?” and “Have you had any new symptoms?” 
343 
The blinded local site investigators were responsible for reporting and coding adverse events 
344 
using MedDRA v15·0, and grading their severity and causality according to “Toxicity Grading 
345 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
346 
Trials”.23 Other safety assessments included changes in laboratory haematology and chemistry, 
347 
and urinalysis variables, self-reported weekly gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS),24 
348 
and self-assessed daily GSRS dimensions of pain (Q1), hunger pains (Q4), nausea (Q5), 
349 
rumbling (Q6), bloating Q7), and diarrhoea (Q11) (except on days when the GSRS was 
350 
recorded). Vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiograph, cytokine and 
351 
chemokine measurements, and immune cell frequencies were also safety assessments. Plasma 
352 
cytokines and chemokines, immune cell frequencies, and IGRA were measured in the treatment 
353 
period before the first and last doses, on day 8, and in the 16-dose study on day 25 and 39. 
354 
Plasma cytokines and chemokines were also assessed 6h after the first and last doses. 
355 
Pharmacokinetics was assessed up to 6h after the first and last dose. 
356 
 
357 
In the 4-week post-treatment period, ascending dose cohorts had a further OGC, and biopsy 
358 
cohorts had a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies and quantitative histology within two weeks. 
359 
IGRA, plasma cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell frequencies were assessed on day 13; 
360 
IGRA was also performed on the 1st, 6th, and 8th days, and at end of study (EOS). 
361 
 
362 
  
 
9 
Serum IgG and IgA specific for the pool of Nexvax2 peptides were measured at screening, 
363 
treatment period days 1 and 8, and also 25 and 39 in the 16-dose study, and post-treatment on 
364 
day 1 and at EOS.  
365 
 
366 
Laboratory assays are described in the appendix (pp 6-8). 
367 
 
368 
Post hoc assessments included complement levels in plasma collected for cytokine assessments 
369 
on treatment days 1, 8 and 53 pre-dose as well as 6h post-dose on day 1 and 53 in both cohorts 
370 
receiving Nexvax2 150µg of the 16-dose study; and CeD serology in sera collected for anti-
371 
Nexvax2 antibody assessments. Post-treatment “responders” to Nexvax2 were defined post hoc 
372 
as having Nexvax2-specific IGRA positive six or eight days after commencing the gluten 
373 
segment in OGC, and “non-responders” as Nexvax2-specific IGRA negative six and eight days 
374 
after commencing gluten only when all nine gluten cookies had been consumed.  
375 
 
376 
Outcomes 
377 
The primary endpoint in each study was centrally assessed as the number and percentage of 
378 
adverse events during the treatment period. Secondary endpoints included other safety and 
379 
tolerability assessments during the treatment and post-treatment periods, and serum anti-
380 
Nexvax2 antibodies. Pharmacokinetics endpoints were maximal concentrations and area under 
381 
the curve for NPL001, NPL002, and NLP003. Quantitative duodenal histology was an 
382 
exploratory safety endpoint. Nexvax2-specific IGRA was defined as the main pharmacodynamic 
383 
endpoint. Post hoc analyses addressed IGRA to recall CMV-EBV-inFluenza (CEF) epitopes; 
384 
gastrointestinal symptoms and IGRA during the screening OGC. 
385 
 
386 
Statistical analysis 
387 
The sample size was pragmatic to assess the safety and tolerability of Nexvax2, while 
388 
minimizing unnecessary participant exposure. All participants who received Nexvax2 or placebo, 
389 
the safety population, were included in an intention to treat analysis for the primary endpoint. 
390 
Additional post hoc analyses were also performed. Both trials were completed and closed before 
391 
data analysis. No formal per protocol statistical analyses were planned, but post hoc analyses 
392 
were performed and are described in the appendix (p 8). To address the confounding effects of 
393 
reduced gluten exposure in the post-treatment OGC, an algorithm was developed post hoc to 
394 
define the populations for post-treatment pharmacodynamic analysis (appendix p 31). Statistical 
395 
tests were two-sided with a significance level of p≤0·05. FDR-adjusted p-values, estimated using 
396 
Benjamini-Hochberg method, were used where indicated to account for multiple hypothesis 
397 
testing. All analysis was done using MATLAB software. Data were collected by the 
398 
investigators, managed by CPR, and analysed by Prometrika (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) 
399 
and the academic co-authors. Trials were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical 
400 
Trials Registry, numbers ACTRN12612000355875, and ACTRN12613001331729.

RESULTS 
409 
 
410 
Between 28 November 2012 and 14 August 2014, 102 volunteers were enrolled in the 3-dose 
411 
study. 21 (21%) of these 102 volunteers did not meet eligibility criteria on screening day 1. 
412 
Subsequently, 69 (68%) of the original 102 volunteers were screened for ascending dose cohorts 
413 
and 12 (12%) for the biopsy cohort (Figure 1A). Ultimately, 37 (54%) of 69 participants 
414 
screened for ascending dose cohorts continued to treatment randomization after OGC. The 32 
415 
(46%) of 69 participants screened for ascending dose cohorts who did not continue included 17 
416 
(25%) that were IGRA negative, and 9 (13%) with IGRA persisting positive. 6 (50%) of 12 
417 
participants screened for the biopsy cohort continued to randomization following gastroscopy 
418 
after 4 (33%) were excluded with villous atrophy and 2 (17%) withdrew. In the first dose cohort, 
419 
nine participants were randomly allocated to receive Nexvax2 at 60 µg and three to placebo; in 
420 
the second dose cohort, nine participants were randomly allocated to receive Nexvax2 at 90 µg 
421 
and four to placebo; in the third dose cohort, eight participants were randomly allocated to 
422 
receive Nexvax2 at 150 µg and four to placebo; and in the final (biopsy) cohort three participants 
423 
were randomly allocated to receive Nexvax2 at 150 µg and three to placebo. Each placebo-
424 
treated participant received three doses, but the Nexvax2-treated participants included two who 
425 
withdrew during dosing from the 60µg and 90µg arms, and another was discontinued due to 
426 
elevated transaminases pre-dose on the first day of treatment. All participants who completed 
427 
dosing commenced OGC one day after last dose, or had a second gastroscopy. All 43 
428 
participants randomized to treatment were included in the primary endpoint analysis of safety. 
429 
Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of the study participants randomized to treatment; 70% 
430 
were women, mean age was 45 years, and on average CeD had been diagnosed 8 years 
431 
previously. 
432 
 
433 
Between 3 August 2012 and 10 September 2013, 67 volunteers were enrolled in the 16-dose 
434 
study. 12 (18%) of the original 67 volunteers did not meet eligibility criteria on screening day 1. 
435 
Subsequently, 39 (58%) of the original 67 volunteers were screened for ascending dose cohorts 
436 
and 16 (24%) for the biopsy cohort (Figure 1B). Ultimately, 25 (64%) of 39 participants 
437 
screened for ascending dose cohorts continued to treatment randomization after OGC. 7 (18%) of 
438 
the participants screened for ascending dose cohorts were discontinued before treatment 
439 
randomization because IGRA to Nexvax2 peptides was negative. 14 (88%) of 16 participants 
440 
continued to randomization after gastroscopy in the biopsy cohort after 2 (12%) were excluded 
441 
with villous atrophy. In the first dose cohort, eight participants were randomly allocated to 
442 
receive Nexvax2 at 150 µg and four to placebo; in the second dose cohort, ten participants were 
443 
randomly allocated to receive Nexvax2 at 300 µg and three to placebo; and in the final (biopsy) 
444 
cohort seven participants were randomly allocated to receive Nexvax2 at 150 µg and seven to 
445 
placebo. All participants in the first and final cohorts received at least 15 of 16 doses, and then 
446 
commenced OGC one day after last dose or had a second gastroscopy. In the second cohort, five 
447 
participants received no more than 3 doses of Nexvax2 300µg, and five participants received 
448 
between 4 and 16 doses of Nexvax2 and then commenced OGC within 3 days of the last dose.  
449 
Participants in the second cohort who received placebo had only 5, 10 or 15 doses and then 
450 
commenced OGC within 3 days of the last dose. All 39 participants randomized to treatment in 
451 
the 16-dose study were included in the primary endpoint analysis of safety. Baseline 
452 
characteristics of the study participants randomized to treatment were similar to the 3-dose study 
453 
  
 
11 
(Table 1); 79% were women, mean age was 45 years, and on average CeD had been diagnosed 7 
454 
years previously.  
455 
 
456 
The number, percentage, and severity of adverse events collected during the treatment period for 
457 
each cohort and in each study are shown in appendix (pp 11-12). The organ systems affected by 
458 
adverse events are shown in Figure 2 and appendix (pp 13-15). The timing of adverse events in 
459 
relationship to dosing, and dose number are shown in Figure 2. Adverse events of at least 
460 
moderate severity are shown in appendix (pp 16-18), and those that affected the gastrointestinal 
461 
system are summarized in Table 2. Overall, participants in either study who received Nexvax2 
462 
were more likely to experience adverse events after the first dose than placebo-treated 
463 
participants  (p=0·0085; Fisher’s Exact test) (Figure 2). In ascending dose cohorts whose 
464 
screening period always included OGC, the first dose of Nexvax2 was frequently followed by 
465 
adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal system within 2 to 5 hours (Figure 2); nausea with or 
466 
without vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea were common (Table 2). Adverse events and 
467 
symptoms with Nexvax2 were reduced with subsequent doses, and were no different from 
468 
placebo by the third week of dosing (Figure 2A, E).  Gastrointestinal and systemic adverse 
469 
events graded severe included nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, shivering, clammy skin, and or 
470 
rigors occurred 2 to 5 hours after the first or second dose of Nexvax2 (appendix pp 16-18). All 7 
471 
participants experiencing gastrointestinal and/or systemic adverse events graded severe, 
472 
including one graded serious – abdominal pain) were in ascending dose cohorts with their 
473 
screening period including OGC. Five (71%) of the seven participants experiencing these post-
474 
dose gastrointestinal adverse events graded severe were homozygous for HLA-DQA1*05 and 
475 
HLA-DQB1*02, significantly more than among other participants in ascending dose cohorts  (9 
476 
(26%) of 35 participants, p=0.0313; Fisher’s Exact test) (Table 2 and appendix pp 16-18). All 
477 
five (100%) of the five participants with an adverse event graded severe or serious after the first 
478 
dose of Nexvax2 were homozygotes for HLA-DQA1*05 and HLA-DQB1*02. In the 3-dose 
479 
study, gastrointestinal and/or systemic adverse events graded severe or serious occurred after the 
480 
first dose in 1 (11%) of 9 participants receiving of Nexvax2 60 µg, in 3 (33%) of 9 participants 
481 
receiving Nexvax2 90 µg (in 2 after the first dose, and in one after both the second and third 
482 
doses), and after the second dose in 1 (11%) of 8 participants receiving Nexvax2 150 µg. In the 
483 
16-dose study, gastrointestinal adverse events were graded severe in one (13%) of 8 participants 
484 
after the first dose of Nexvax2 150 µg, and as serious (abdominal pain associated with vomiting) 
485 
in 1 (10%) of 10 participants after the first dose of Nexvax2 300 µg. Dosing was discontinued in 
486 
the second cohort of the 16-dose study on the recommendation of the DSMB following 
487 
unmasked review of safety data summarized in appendix (pp 16-18). According to the dose 
488 
escalation criteria (appendix pp 5-6), theMTD of 150 µg was established for Nexvax2 
489 
administered at intervals of 3 to 4 days by intradermal injection.  
490 
 
491 
Consistent with adverse events, weekly GSRS scores significantly increased in Nexvax2-treated 
492 
participants for the first week of twice-weekly dosing (appendix p 19), and there was a trend for 
493 
gastrointestinal symptoms to increase on each dosing day for Nexvax2-treated participants over 
494 
the first two weeks of the treatment period in both studies (Figure 3A-F). However, nausea was 
495 
the only symptom to increase and reach statistical significance on the first day of dosing in any 
496 
cohort (Figure 3A; p=0·015; Wilcoxon rank sum test). Overall, the clinical effects of 
497 
administering the first dose of Nexvax2 resembled the symptoms reported by participants during 
498 
  
 
12 
the screening period when they consumed gluten and experienced significantly increased 
499 
abdominal pain, nausea, rumbling, bloating, and diarrhea (appendix p 20).  
500 
 
501 
Clinical and laboratory safety assessments including circulating lymphocyte subsets (appendix 
502 
pp 21-23), and anti-Nexvax2 IgG and IgA (appendix p 32), showed no significant changes over 
503 
the treatment period. Seroconversion for antibodies specific for transglutaminase 2 and 
504 
deamidated gliadin peptide was not observed from screening to end of study (appendix p 24). 
505 
Comparing biopsies from screening and after the treatment period, median [interquartile range] 
506 
villous height to crypt depth ratio in distal duodenal biopsies was not significantly different for 
507 
Nexvax2 at the MTD with 3 doses over 15 days (2.04 [0.69] versus 2.49 [0·67], n=2), or 16 
508 
doses over 53 days (1·74 [0·54] versus 1·56 [0·58], n=7), and for placebo over 15 days (1.75 
509 
[0.62] versus 2.09 [0.71], n=3) or 16 doses over 53 days (2·10 [0·25] versus 1·92 [0·35], n=7). 
510 
Villous height to crypt depth ratio in proximal duodenal biopsies, density of intra-epithelial 
511 
lymphocytes, and modified Marsh scores were also not different in biopsies collected before and 
512 
after dosing with Nexvax2 150µg or placebo weekly over 15 days or two-times weekly over 53 
513 
weeks (appendix p 25). Complement levels were stable during the treatment period (appendix p 
514 
26). Pre-dose plasma cytokines and chemokines were stable over the study period; post-dose 
515 
alterations in plasma cytokines and chemokines are reported elsewhere (publication in 
516 
preparation). 
517 
 
518 
Plasma concentrations of NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003 were above levels of detection (0·05 
519 
nM, 0·1 nM, and 0·4 nM, respectively) from ten minutes up to two hours after the first and final 
520 
administrations of Nexvax2 in both studies, but were at levels below the limits of quantitation 
521 
(2·6 nM, 5·5 nM, and 5·3 nM, respectively) (appendix p 33). 
522 
 
523 
Unlike gluten challenge during the screening period, Nexvax2 administration did not cause the 
524 
whole blood IGRA for Nexvax2 peptides to become positive (Figure 4). In contrast, IGRA 
525 
responses to recall epitopes were present and stable throughout the study (appendix p 34).  
526 
 
527 
Aggregate daily symptoms score during the post-treatment OGC was significantly worse than 
528 
pre-treatment in placebo-treated participants (p=0·0232, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). Almost 
529 
half the placebo-treated participants did not consume all gluten-containing cookies during the 
530 
post-treatment gluten challenge, which was significantly less than Nexvax2-treated participants 
531 
across both studies (10/18 vs 31/33; p=0·0019, Fisher’s Exact Test, Table 3). Post hoc analysis 
532 
of Nexvax2-specific IGRA showed that participants treated with Nexvax2 150µg in the 3-dose or 
533 
16-dose study were mostly IGRA negative to Nexvax2 peptides when they completed the gluten 
534 
challenge, but almost all placebo-treated participants who completed gluten challenge were 
535 
positive (Table 3; 3-dose-150µg: 6/6 versus 2/9, p=0·007; 16-dose-150µg: 6/8 versus 0/5, 
536 
p=0·021, Fisher’s Exact Test).  
537 
 
538 
DISCUSSION 
539 
 
540 
CeD represents a unique condition amongst the autoimmune diseases since the main components 
541 
in the etiology and pathogenesis have been recognized: the MHC Class II haplotype contributes 
542 
almost half of the genetic susceptibility,5 and the hierarchy of epitopes recognized by CD4+ T 
543 
cells responding to the trigger antigen are well characterized.13 In addition, the causative antigen, 
544 
  
 
13 
gluten, can be reintroduced to patients to assess immune responsiveness and its effects on the 
545 
target organ.15 For these reasons, CeD is exceptionally well positioned for the development and 
546 
testing of epitope-specific immunotherapy, complimenting the limited clinical experience of this 
547 
novel class of antigen-specific immunotherapy in allergy and autoimmunity, and translating 
548 
insights from preclinical models.25 
549 
 
550 
The phase 1 studies of Nexvax2 are the first to assess the clinical and immunological effects of 
551 
systemically administered peptides implicated in the adaptive immune response in CeD. The 
552 
target for Nexvax2 is the HLA-DQ2.5-epitope-TCR complex linking the surfaces of antigen 
553 
presenting cells and gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells.26 In vitro, the component peptides in Nexvax2 
554 
bind selectively to HLA-DQ2.5, but not other CeD-associated HLA-DQ heterodimers. The 
555 
peptides also activate CD4+ T cell clones from CeD patients that are specific for HLA-DQ2.5-
556 
restricted epitopes represented in Nexvax2. In vivo, Nexvax2 engagement with its predicted 
557 
target was supported by observing that whole blood IGRA for Nexvax2 peptides was converted 
558 
from positive after pre-treatment OGC to negative after post-treatment OGC in most participants 
559 
receiving Nexvax2 150µg. Furthermore, to our knowledge, systemic administration of epitopes 
560 
for CD4+ T cells implicated in an autoimmune or allergic disease has not previously been 
561 
associated with digestive symptoms, which suggests this may a specific effect of gluten epitopes. 
562 
Additional indirect evidence of target engagement was supported by observing that the first dose 
563 
of Nexvax2 is followed by digestive symptoms, which are similar in timing and quality to those 
564 
associated with gluten exposure.

Despite the first administration of Nexvax2 being followed by symptoms typical of gluten 
567 
exposure in CeD, repeated dosing over 8 weeks did not affect duodenal histology. Duodenal 
568 
mucosal histology is slow to recover after institution of gluten-free diet, and would not be 
569 
expected to show improvement over the duration of the treatment periods in these phase 1 
570 
studies.  In contrast, daily gluten ingestion can cause symptoms on the first day similar to those 
571 
after the first dose of Nexvax2 150 µg, and result in pronounced mucosal damage after one 
572 
week.27 There was a significant reduction in symptoms without changes in pharmacokinetics or 
573 
anti-Nexvax2 antibodies after the final doses of Nexvax2 in both studies. This was consistent 
574 
with target T cells becoming functionally unresponsive to antigenic stimulation. This 
575 
interpretation was supported by whole blood IGRA for Nexvax2 peptides frequently being 
576 
negative after gluten challenge in the post-treatment period in participants administered 
577 
Nexvax2. Direct visualization of peripheral blood and intestinal gluten-specific T cells assessed 
578 
by flow cytometry using MHC-peptide complexes will be required in future studies to address 
579 
whether CD4+ T cells specific for gluten, and in particular Nexvax2, express surface markers 
580 
consistent with anergy or regulatory function following treatment with Nexvax2.11  
581 
 
582 
These phase 1 studies were not designed to address the efficacy of Nexvax2 in CeD. Clinically 
583 
relevant endpoints such as patient reported outcome measurements and quantitative histology 
584 
after longer periods of treatment will be required to assess efficacy. In this study, we had 
585 
intended to determine the MTD for Nexvax2 in participants who mobilized CD4+ T cells 
586 
responsive to Nexvax2. However, a potential limitation to the current studies was the high 
587 
number of participants ineligible for dosing. The most common reason for exclusion from 
588 
ascending dose cohorts was negative IGRA to Nexvax2 peptides after gluten challenge in the 
589 
screening period. Because virtually all HLA-DQ2.5+ CeD patients harbor CD4+ T cells specific 
590 
  
 
14 
for epitopes in Nexvax2,9-14 the most likely explanation for failure to mobilize Nexvax2-specific 
591 
CD4+ T cells was recent, inadvertent gluten ingestion.28 Exclusion of participants with 
592 
significant mucosal injury from biopsy cohorts was also most likely due to inadvertent non-
593 
adherence to GFD.29  
594 
 
595 
Together these studies support the safety, tolerability, and relevant bioactivity of Nexvax2. 
596 
Gradual escalation up to the maintenance dose of a peptide immunotherapy may be tolerated 
597 
better than fixed dose regimens.30 A separate study is addressing whether symptoms associated 
598 
with initial and maximal doses of Nexvax2 are overcome by gradual dose escalation 
599 
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02528799). These studies provide the basis for future clinical trials to 
600 
test whether Nexvax2 protects against the damaging effects of gluten in HLA-DQ2·5+ CeD.

Nexvax2 (A, C, G, and K) (N=54) than participants receiving placebo (E, I, and M) (N=28) 
740 
(p=0·0085; Fisher’s Exact test), but the only individual dose level that reached significance

*Participants who did not finish all study doses, or post-treatment gluten challenge were not included in analysis. IGRA 
responders were Nexvax2-specific IGRA  positive 6 or 8 days after commencing gluten challenge, and “non-responders” 
were Nexvax2-specific IGRA negative 6 or 8 days after commencing OGC when all 9 gluten cookies had been consumed 
(Algorithm outlined in Figures S3).

5. METHODS 
5.1
5.1 
Development of Nexvax2 
To develop Nexvax2, the specificities of polyclonal gluten-specific T cells circulating in blood of 
HLA-DQ2·5+ celiac patients after feeding them wheat, barley or rye were assessed in quantitative 
overnight IFN-γ ELISpot assays(2). The peptide composition of Nexvax2 was determined after 
screening 16,838 unique 12–amino acid oligopeptides in 313 GenBank entries for gliadins, LMW 
glutenins, and HMW glutenins from Triticum aestivum after wheat challenge, hordeins from 
Hordeum vulgare after barley challenge, and secalins from Secale cerale after rye challenge. T cell 
clones raised to the three peptides selected for inclusion in Nexvax2 responded to 61 of the 96 
immunoreactive peptides identified from screening a peptide library encompassing 16,838 unique 
12–amino acid sequences. T cell responses to these 3 peptides were additive when mixed together 
and assessed in IFN-γ ELISpot assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CeD 
donors. 
 
The peptides in Nexvax2, NPL001, NPL002 and NPL003 correspond to partially deamidated 
germline-encoded sequences in certain wheat α-gliadins, wheat ω-gliadins/barley C-hordeins, or 
barley B-hordeins with synthetically modified N- and C-termini. In vitro assays performed by the La 
Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology (La Jolla, California, USA) assessed the binding of 
NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003 to isolated MHC Class II molecules according to established 
methods(3). Each peptide binds selectively with intermediate affinity to HLA-DQ2·5 (Table S1). 
The equimolar mixture of peptides in Nexvax2 stimulates concentration-dependent secretion of 
IFN-γ, and IL-10 by CD4+ T cell clones specific for epitopes in Nexvax2 (Figure S1A-E),(4) 
attenuated by co-incubation with anti-HLA-DQ, but not anti-HLA-DR (Figure S1F-J). 
 
Conduct of these phase 1 studies were supported by preclinical studies of Nexvax2 investigating 
pharmacodynamics in HLA-DR3-DQ2·5 transgenic mice, including a related strain that was 
additionally T-cell receptor transgenic with CD4+ T cells specific for the DQ2·5-glia-α2 epitope 
present in Nexvax2,(5) toxicology and PK studies in rodents, clinical medicinal chemistry studies, 
the prior first-in-human study of Nexvax2, and clinical studies of peptide-based therapeutic 
vaccines.

Investigational drug product 
CS Bio (Menlo Park, California, USA) manufactured NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003. Microtest 
(Agawam, Massachusetts, USA) formulated and filled vials with a sterile equimolar solution at total 
peptide concentration 9 mg/mL in sterile USP 0.9% sodium chloride. Placebo and diluent for 
Nexvax2 in vials was USP 0.9% sodium chloride. Placebo or Nexvax2 150 µg (50 µg of each 
peptide), or 300 µg in 0.1 mL were administered by 1 mL Luer-Lok™ plastic syringe fitted with a 
Micro Injection Needle (Becton-Dickinson). Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing (Grand Rapids, 
Michigan, USA) formulated and filled Soluvia™ syringes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New 
Jersey, USA) with Nexvax2 (0.6 mg/mL, 0.9 mg/mL, or 1.5 mg/mL) or placebo. 
 
5.3
5.3 
Lab procedures for clinical trials 
5.3.1 
Safety laboratory pathology assessments 
Laboratory assessments included routine haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis performed 
by Dorevitch Pathology for sites in Australia in New Zealand, and by LabConnect (Johnson City, 
Tennessee, USA) for sites in the United States. 
 
5.3.2 
Whole blood interferon-γ release assay (IGRA)  
IFN-γ levels in plasma separated from whole blood incubations for IGRA collected during the 
screening periods of each study were measured by ELISA performed either at ImmusanT, Inc. for 
samples from sites in the USA, or at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (Parkville, Vicotria, 
Australia) for sites in Australia or New Zealand. After each study was completed, thawed plasma 
from all whole blood IGRA incubations were re-assessed by IFN-γ ELISA at ImmusanT, which 
were regarded as the final, reported IGRA data. Briefly, 1 mL of blood was collected into each of 
three Nil Control Tubes (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) that 
had 0.1 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS) alone, Nexvax2 peptides (each 50 µg/mL), or positive 
control CEF peptide pool with epitopes derived from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and 
influenza (0.1 µg/mL; Mabtech AB, Nacka Strand, Sweden) added, and a QuantiFERON Mitogen 
Tube with 0.1 mL PBS added. Tubes were incubated at 37°C for 24 h before centrifugation, and 
IFN-γ in the supernatant was measured by ELISA (Mabtech). To evaluate the magnitude of 
responses, a stimulation index (SI) was calculated for the average IFN-γ concentrations in the CEF 
and Nexvax2-peptide incubations divided by the concentration determined for the response to PBS 
alone. A “positive” response was defined as SI>1.25 and net IFN-γ concentration above PBS 
control >7.2pg/mL.(6, 7) 
 
5.3.3 
Plasma concentrations of cytokines and chemokines  
Blood was collected into K2 EDTA Vacutainer® tubes, which were immediately placed on wet 
ice, and then centrifuged at 1100-1300 RCF for 10 minutes within 30 minutes of collection. 
Plasma was aliquotted and frozen. Cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma using a 
38plex magnetic bead-based assay according the manufacturer’s protocol (EMD Millipore Corp., 
Billerica, MA; Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas, USA) at ImmusanT, Inc. 
 
5.3.4 
Plasma concentrations of complement components 
Complement levels were measured in plasma collected for cytokine/chemokine assessment by 
magnetic bead-based assay according the manufacturer’s protocol (Milliplex® MAP Human 
Complement Magnetic Bead Panel 1 and 2) at ImmusanT, Inc. 
 
5.3.5 
Immune cell profiling 
PBMC were prepared at trial sites according to manufacturer’s instructions using Ficoll-Paque™ 
PLUS (Sigma-Aldrich) in SepMate™-50 tubes (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.; Vancouver, BC, 
Canada), and cryopreserved using CryoStor™ CS10 (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.). Flow 
cytometry was performed at Duke Center for AIDS Research Flow Cytometry Core Facility 
(Durham, North Carolina, USA) using pre-mixed labeled antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, 
CD45, CD16, CD56, and CD19 according to established protocols(8-11). 
 
  
8 
5.3.6 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics were assessed on the first and last days of dosing. Blood was collected 30 
minutes before, and 10, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Blood 
was collected into K2 EDTA Vacutainer® tubes (Becton-Dickinson), which were centrifuged at 
1100-1300 RCF for 10 minutes within 10min of collection. Plasma samples were spiked with 
isotopically labeled Nexvax2 peptides (50 ng/mL; Pepscan, Lelystad, The Netherlands), extracted 
using C18 Sep-Pak SPE cartridges, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometric developed and performed by Blue Stream Laboratories (Woburn, 
Massachusetts, USA).  
 
5.3.7 
Celiac disease serology  
Assays for CeD serology in sera collected for anti-Nexvax2 antibodies was performed by 
Healthscope Pathology (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) using QUANTA Lite® R h-tTG IgA, 
Gliadin IgA II [DGP], Gliadin IgG II [DGP] kits (INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, California, 
USA). 
 
5.3.8 
Duodenal histology 
The central pathologist (Dorevitch Pathology; Heidelberg VIC, Australia) evaluated biopsies in 
the screening period to determine eligibility. After the end of each study, the central pathologist 
masked to the order that biopsies were collected, re-evaluated all biopsies to make a final 
assessment of modified Marsh type. Histology slides were shipped to the University of Tampere, 
where villous height to crypt depth (VH:CrD) ratio and intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) density 
per 100 epithelial cells were measured in well oriented sections.(12) 
 
5.4
5.4 
Major histocompatibility class II peptide binding 
In vitro assays performed by the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology (La Jolla, California, 
USA) assessed the binding of NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003 to isolated MHC Class II molecules 
according to established methods(3). 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODS FOR POST HOC ANALYSES 
 
6.1
6.1 
Primary endpoints  
Two-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare (1) number of participants who experienced 
treatment emergent adverse events in placebo and active arms, and (2) number of Nexvax2-treated 
participants who experienced severe adverse events stratified by HLA-DQ2.5 homozygosity status.  
 
6.2
6.2 
Secondary endpoints  
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare individual and summed daily symptom scores for 
each participant after dosing relative to pre-dose baseline scores. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was 
used to compare (1) weekly GSRS scores between a treatment week and the baseline week (Table 
S7), (2) daily symptoms scores between gluten challenge day and placebo challenge day during 
screening period (Table S8), and (3) change in percentage lymphocytes from day 1 of treatment on 
other days (Table S9).  
 
6.3
6.3 
Exploratory endpoints 
Villous height to crypt depth (VH:CrD) ratio and intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) density pre- and 
post-treatment were analyzed by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test (Table S11).  
 
6.4
6.4 
Pharmacodynamic endpoints 
To address the confounding effects of reduced gluten exposure in the post-treatment OGC, an 
algorithm was developed post hoc to define the populations for post-treatment symptom and 
pharmacodynamic analysis (Figure S3). Two-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare (1) 
number of Nexvax2 and placebo treated participants who finished the post-treatment OGC, and (2) 
number of Nexvax2 and placebo treated participants who had negative IGRA at day six or eight after 
commencing post-treatment OGC (Table 3).

Supp. Figure S1: Nexvax2 peptides stimulate IFNγ and IL-10 secretion by T-cell clones from HLA-DQ2.5+ CeD donors that 
are specific for immunodominant, HLA-DQ2.5-restricted gluten epitopes. Cytokine concentrations measured by multiplex bead 
assay in media after 24 h incubation of T cell clones with HLA-DQ2.5+ B cell lines and equimolar concentrations of the three 
peptides in Nexvax2. Cytokine levels are represented as percent of concentrations  stimulated by Nexvax2 with each (continued)
27
 (Supp. Figure S1 continued) constituent peptide at 10 μM. T cell clones were specific for one of five HLA-DQ2.5-restricted 
gluten epitopes present in Nexvax2 peptides shown in Table S1  (A, C, E, G, and I). Consistent with gluten-reactive T cell 
clones being activated by Nexvax2 peptides bound to HLA-DQ2.5, cytokine secretion was inhibited by co-incubation with 
anti-HLA-DQ antibody (clone SPvL3), but not anti-HLA-DR (clone L243) at 10 μg/mL with Nexvax2 peptides at 10 μM (B, D, 
F, H, J).

Gluten cookies
Supp. Figure S3: Cookies used for placebo-controlled, crossover oral gluten challenges. Gluten-containing (A), and 
matched gluten-free cookies (B) are shown. The gluten-containing cookies were prepared using a mixture of wheat, barley and 
rye flour providing a total of approximately 3 g gluten according to the Osborne calculation. Gluten-free cookies were matched 
for their appearance, weight, taste and consistency. Gluten-free cookies had no detectable gluten by R5 ELISA. Participants 
were advised to eat each cookie slowly over a 1-1.5 hour interval, and eat all three cookies completely each day, and to continue 
their usual gluten-free diet driven by their individual appetite on these three days.

Supp. Figure S6: Pharmacokinetics of Nexvax2 peptides in plasma. Mean (±SEM) plasma concentrations of NPL001 (A), 
NPL002 (C), and NPL003 (E) are shown after the first dose of Nexvax2 150μg (1st Cohort) or 300μg (2nd Cohort) in 
ascending dose cohorts that had OGC in screening, and in the biopsy cohort (3rd [biopsy] Cohort) in 16-dose Study. 
Mean (±SEM) plasma concentrations of NPL001 (B), NPL002 (D), and NPL003 (F) after the first and last dose of 
Nexvax2 150μg for 1st Cohort and 3rd (biopsy) Cohort in 16-dose Study. Measured concentrations of NPL001, NPL002, 
and NPL003 were below the lower levels of quantitation (2.6 nM, 5.5 nM, and 5.3 nM, respectively), but frequently 
above the lower levels of detection (0.05 nM, 0.1 nM, and 0.4 nM, respectively).
