Ukraine has one of the largest HIV epidemics in Europe, historically
driven by people who inject drugs (PWID). The epidemic showed
signs of stabilization in 2012, but the recent war in eastern Ukraine
may be reigniting virus spread. We investigated the movement of
HIV-infected people within Ukraine before and during the conflict.
We analyzed HIV-1 subtype-A pol nucleotide sequences sampled
during 2012–2015 from 427 patients of 24 regional AIDS centers
and used phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct virus movement
among different locations in Ukraine. We then tested for correla-
tions between reported PWID behaviors and reconstructed pat-
terns of virus spread. Our analyses suggest that Donetsk and
Lugansk, two cities not controlled by the Ukrainian government
in eastern Ukraine, were significant exporters of the virus to the
rest of the country. Additional analyses showed that viral dissem-
ination within the country changed after 2013. Spearman correla-
tion analysis showed that incoming virus flow was correlated with
the number of HIV-infected internally displaced people. Addition-
ally, there was a correlation between more intensive virus move-
ment and locations with a higher proportion of PWID practicing
risky sexual behaviors. Our findings suggest that effective preven-
tion responses should involve internally displaced people and peo-
ple who frequently travel to war-affected regions. Scale-up of
harm reduction services for PWID will be an important factor in
preventing new local HIV outbreaks in Ukraine.
HIV | Ukraine | war | people who inject drugs | phylogeography
T
he HIV epidemic in Ukraine is one of the largest in Europe:
In 2015, the country had an estimated 220,000 people living
with HIV and the highest rate of new infections in Europe
(∼30 cases per 100,000 people) (1). After independence in 1991,
the population of people who inject drugs (PWID) grew quickly;
in 1994, the number of new HIV cases in this group rocketed to
12,000, and by 1997, HIV in PWID was reported in all admin-
istrative regions of Ukraine (2). This was the beginning of one of
the largest HIV in PWID epidemics recorded, characterized by
multiple transmissions within the first month after infection and
driven by risky injecting practices (3–5). From 2002, Ukraine
scaled up a harm-reduction approach (6) that has been shown to
reduce risky injecting practices and HIV transmission among
PWID (7). Consequently, the fraction of newly diagnosed cases
attributed to illicit drug use declined; since 2010, more newly
diagnosed infections have been attributed to sexual than parenteral
transmission (8). In 2012, the number of newly registered HIV cases
dropped for the first time in the history of the epidemic in Ukraine,
indicating that the epidemiological situation had stabilized (8).
However, this epidemiological equilibrium was disrupted by
the Maidan protests in late 2013 (9), the Crimean Peninsula annex-
ation in early 2014, and the ongoing military conflict in eastern
Ukraine, in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. During the conflict,
health care provision and harm-reduction services were continuously
interrupted (9–12). HIV incidence has grown 15–54% in some areas
affected by war (13). Notably, the conflict caused massive internal
human migration: Since 2014, >1.7 million people have been in-
ternally displaced in Ukraine (14), out of a total population of
45 million (15). HIV prevalence in the general population stands
at >0.5% (16), suggesting that >8,000 of these displaced individ-
uals might be HIV-infected. However, only 1,153 HIV-infected
internally displaced people (IDP) have registered with AIDS cen-
ters at their new places of residence as of early 2017 (16). Large-
scale human migration is likely to have had an impact on epidemic
dynamics within and among the regions of Ukraine. Within cities
and well-established transmission networks, chronically infected
people protect individuals susceptible to infection from highly in-
fectious recently infected cases, creating the so-called “firewall”
effect (17, 18). Changes to established networks could disrupt this
effect and trigger further viral transmission or even provoke local
outbreaks. Furthermore, as infected people move to new places,
they might disseminate new viral strains. In addition, new groups of
susceptible individuals may be generated—e.g., disadvantaged IDP,
affected by war, with potentially poor access to care. In general, we
might expect an increased export of HIV from eastern Ukraine
(historically the most heavily HIV-affected region) to other locations.
Significance
Current conflict in the heavily HIV-affected regions of eastern
Ukraine, which caused the relocation of 1.7 million people, may
have increased the exportation of the virus from war-affected
regions to other parts of the country. We show that the large-
scale war-initiated movement of people (including those HIV-
infected) was associated with patterns of HIV movement
reconstructed from gene-sequence data. Our results further
suggest that virus dissemination was directed to the locations
with the highest prevalence of risky sexual practices in people
who inject drugs (PWID). Recently, the Ukrainian HIV epidemic
has been transitioning from being PWID-concentrated to sex-
ually driven. Our study helps to understand the factors that
might facilitate this shift.

 There have been some efforts to study the effect of the political
turmoil on HIV epidemics elsewhere (18) and some reports of
the response of Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations to the
conflict (12). Here, we analyze 427 HIV-1 subtype-A pol sequences
collected from almost all administrative regions of Ukraine to
investigate how viral infections have been redistributed among
geographical locations in recent years. We then combine these
findings with epidemiological and behavioral data to explore the
current epidemiological situation in those regions where increased
viral gene flow was detected.
Results
HIV-1 Dissemination Among Locations in Ukraine. A total of 448
HIV-1 pol gene sequences were available from the Ukrainian
HIV drug-resistance database: Of these, 427; 19; and 2 were
identified as subtypes A, B, and circulating recombinant form
03_AB, respectively. Only subtype A sequences were used in our
phylogenetic/phylogeographic analyses. These data were col-
lected between 2012 and 2015 from 22 administrative regions of
Ukraine, from the capital city of Kyiv, and from the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea, representing 24 of the 27 Ukrainian ad-
ministrative units. For the phylogeographic analysis, we grouped
sequences into seven geographic locations: Center, Crimea, East
(including Donetsk and Lugansk—two regions in eastern Ukraine
involved in military conflict), Kyiv, Odessa, South, and West.
Hereafter, we refer to these groups as “locations” and to the Ukrainian
administrative units as “regions.” Full details of the sequences used are
provided in Dataset S1, Table S1 A and B and Supporting Information.
An initial maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree included
2,199 reference and 427 Ukrainian subtype-A sequences (Fig. 1).
The tree revealed that the Ukrainian samples formed a distinct
monophyletic clade within sequences from countries of the former
Soviet Union (FSU). The FSU sequences in turn formed a clade
within the global HIV-1 subtype-A dataset, as expected from pre-
vious reports (19, 20).
Furthermore, we selected 36 HIV subtype-A sequences sam-
pled in 1986–2014 and added them to the Ukrainian sequences
to improve molecular clock calibration (n = 463; combined
dataset). The dataset showed sufficient temporal signal (root-to-
tip correlation coefficient = 0.5), supporting the use of molecular
clock models. Phylodynamic analysis showed that the most re-
cent common ancestor of the sequences in the Ukrainian dataset
was 2001 [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1999–2002], for
the FSU countries was 1998 (95% BCI: 1997–2000), and for the
combined dataset was 1977 (95% BCI: 1972–1981). The result-
ing empirical posterior distribution of dated phylogenies was
used in subsequent phylogeographic analyses, after the removal
of the non-Ukrainian reference sequences (n = 427; Ukrainian
dataset). Given the k = 7 sampling locations, we investigated
virus dissemination among the k(k − 1) = 42 possible pathways of
virus spread using discrete phylogeographic models (21, 22).
More specifically, we investigated the main exporters of viral
lineages—i.e., the locations from which the majority of migration
events originated.
In our phylogeographic analysis, the East (Donetsk and Lugansk
regions) was the main exporter, accounting on average for 92%
(95% BCI: 87–96%) of the migration events in the Ukrainian
dataset (Fig. 2, Table 1, and Dataset S1, Table S2). In particular,
viral lineage movements were most frequently observed from the
East to the Center, South, Kyiv, and Odessa locations, accounting
for 26% (95% BCI: 24–28%), 24% (95% BCI: 21–26%), 22%
(95% BCI: 20–24%), and 17% (95% BCI: 16–18%) of migration
events, respectively. Very few migration events were observed as
originating from the Crimea and West locations (<1% each), but
the West received a significant proportion of translocated viral
lineages (7% of viral lineage movement events; 95% BCI: 6–8%).
Given that locations were represented by different numbers of
sequences, we explored estimates of among-location viral lineage
movement in more balanced datasets. To this end, we conducted
additional analyses in which the number of sequences per location
were randomly down-sampled to match the number of sequences
in the third smallest location (Odessa; n = 57). We conducted
10 replicate analyses with different random subsamples (all n =
317) of the dataset and found that the East remained as the main
viral lineage export location (accounting on average for 91% of
migration events) in 7 of 10 subsampled replicates. For the number
of migration events estimated for each subsampled dataset, see
Dataset S1, Table S3.
Temporal Change in Virus Lineage Movement After the Beginning of
the Conflict. We aimed to investigate whether viral gene flow
among regions has changed after the initiation of war, a phe-
nomenon we call hereafter “a phylogeographic transition.” We
estimated rates of viral lineage movement using models with
time-dependent lineage transition rates. Specifically, we com-
pared the “single-epoch” model (in which lineage migration rates
remained constant between 2012–2015) with the “two-epoch”
model (in which lineage migration rates were allowed to be
different before and after the start of the conflict in 2013). The
results of the epoch analysis showed that the two-epoch model
fitted the data better than the single-epoch model, as demon-
strated by a Bayes factor (BF) support of >30 in favor of the
more complex model. Standard terminology defines the strength of
support for a particular model as “very strong” for BF >30 (23). This
result was consistent across all 10 replicate datasets generated by
random subsampling (Dataset S1, Table S4).
Correlation Between Observed Virus Flow and PWID Behaviors. We
further investigated whether among-location viral lineage move-
ment was correlated with important epidemiological characteristics
of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ukraine. Here, we calculated Spearman
correlation coefficients between exporting and importing viral gene
flow and all behavioral covariates of interest. In particular, we were

 interested in the total number of lineage migration events that
originated in a given location (exportation events) and the total
number of lineage migration events received by a given location
(importation events). Behavioral data relating to PWID and re-
gional epidemiological characteristics were aggregated to the
same geographic units (locations) as used in the phylogeographic
analysis.
The behavioral variables came from (i) the national survey of
PWID (Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance; IBBS), (ii) the
regional HIV surveillance systems, and (iii) data on the war-
associated movement of IDP. We chose the IBBS data that
were collected closer to the phylogeographic transition (i.e.,
IBBS-2013) as an indicator of behaviors at the time when viral
movement was hypothesized to have changed.
We found that injecting behaviors of PWID were not associ-
ated with the observed viral migration flow. Risky sexual behaviors
of PWID, on the contrary, were associated with the number of
importation events. Specifically, the higher proportion of PWID
who always use condoms with casual and commercial partners was
associated with a lower number of importation events [Spearman
correlation P = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively, after adjustment for
multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method (24)].
The number of importation events per location was surprisingly
negatively correlated with the proportion of PWID who reported
participating in group sex (P = 0.04). Importantly, we found that
the number of exportation events to a location was positively
correlated with the HIV prevalence in the general population (P =
0.05) and the number of IDP relocated to that location (P < 0.01).
At the same time, the number of HIV-infected IDP registered at
that location was positively correlated with a higher number of
importation events (P = 0.03). Table 2 shows statistically sig-
nificant correlations at P ≤ 0.05; see Dataset S1, Table S5 for all
correlation coefficients.
Discussion
Here, we explored HIV dissemination in Ukraine by analyzing
geographical patterns of viral genetic flow in recent years. Our
results suggest that viral lineages have moved from the regions
engaged in the war to the rest of Ukraine: Many strains sampled
in Ukraine during 2012–2015 appear to have originated, directly
or indirectly, from Donetsk and Lugansk (i.e., the ancestral se-
quence location of the Ukrainian dataset was found to be in the
East location). The East was the main exporter of viral lineages,
and this remained the case when the number of sequences per
location was made more balanced. The most intensive virus-
lineage movement was observed from the eastern to the central
and southern regions and to Odessa and Kyiv. The East location is
heavily affected by HIV: 24% of all nationally registered HIV
cases, and the largest number of HIV-positive PWID (45,000), live
or have lived in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Donetsk is the
largest city in the area and has some of the highest HIV preva-
lences in Ukraine among PWID (33.5% in 2015), sex workers
(17% in 2015), and the general population [0.9% of pregnant
women were HIV-positive in Donetsk in 2015 (13, 16, 25)].

 Our data support a transition in the pattern of viral lineage
movement around the end of 2013, the time of the beginning of
several major events in Ukraine: the Maidan protests in Kyiv, the
annexation of Crimea, and an initiation of the war in the east.
The movement of people who relocated from the areas not
controlled by the Ukrainian government to locations elsewhere
corresponds to the observed virus movement patterns. Further-
more, we believe that the observed virus-lineage movement is not
a result of recent transmissions, but reflects the redistribution of
preexisting infections within the country. Viral gene sequences in
the Ukrainian HIV database come from patients who experienced
antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure and whose blood samples
were sent for HIV drug-resistance testing. In Ukraine before 2017,
ART followed an older treatment guideline (i.e., patients received
ART when CD4 count <350), hence, it is likely that the patients
included in our study were infected some years before their virus
was sequenced. Overall, patients in Ukraine are diagnosed with
HIV late in infection: 41% of the newly diagnosed patients are in
the third or fourth stage of HIV (26). Thus, patients in our analysis
are unlikely to reflect recent transmission events, and the viral lineage
movement from Donetsk and Lugansk suggests that many people
(e.g., residents) who were initially infected in the eastern regions have
moved to the central and southern regions due to the war, resulting in
a redistribution of HIV viral lineages within Ukraine.
The number of virus-lineage exportations correlated well with
the overall number of IDP registered in a region. Thus, we saw
that more people moved to the locations from which the virus is
originating. This observation is explained by the fact that a large
proportion of IDP moved away from the front line that divided
government- and nongovernment-controlled regions, but stayed
within the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, just in different counties.
Surprisingly, this observation was not repeated for the HIV-
infected IDP population: Higher numbers of HIV-infected IDP
were registered in the locations that imported more viral line-
ages. Thus, even though more IDP moved to the main exporting
locations (East), more HIV-infected people moved to the main
importing locations in our analysis (Center, Kyiv, South, and Odessa).
It is crucial to understand the nature of this difference: Either we see
more HIV-infected IDP move fully outside of the eastern regions
compared with noninfected people, or we are simply not linking the
HIV-infected IDP who stayed within the Donetsk and Lugansk re-
gions to care.
The stress of the displacement might result in treatment failures
for some HIV-infected patients and cause overrepresentation of
IDP in our sample. Patients who had to relocate because of the
conflict may be more likely to reduce treatment adherence or drop
out of treatment for some time. With the nonnucleoside reverse-
transcriptase inhibitors that are currently in use in Ukraine for most
first-line regimens, mutations can occur within weeks of nonadherence.
On the other hand, in Ukraine, 9–10% of ART patients experience
virological failure, which, given 79,000 patients in treatment, would lead
to ∼7,000 resistance tests a year. However, only ∼500 tests are available
annually. Therefore, every region receives a quota of tests, in pro-
portion to the number of infected people in the region. Physicians
then decide who is tested, based on the current state and medical
history of a patient. Patients with multiple changes of drug schemes
are prioritized. Thus, a patient failing ART due to apparent ad-
herence issues is unlikely to be prioritized for resistance testing
over patients with failures under treatment. Indeed, the percentage
of sequences with no resistance mutations at the time of failure did
not change significantly over time (17% and 20% before and after
the beginning of war, respectively), suggesting that severe adher-
ence issues are not overrepresented in our data (Dataset S1, Table
6B). More details on the drug-resistance-associated mutations in
our sample can be found in Supporting Information.
Regrettably, the viral genetic data from patients of the AIDS
centers in Ukraine do not have associated risk group information.
Thus, we cannot be confident as to what risk population our
sample mostly represents. We know that HIV-infected PWID have
poor access to treatment compared with other patients; only 9.4%
of people in treatment report the use of illicit drugs at any point,
while it is estimated that at least half of the people living with HIV
in Ukraine have a history of drug use (27). At the same time, PWID
might be more likely to experience treatment failure (due to social,
psychological, and economical challenges), and thus they may be
more likely to be part of our sample than other patients on ART.
In 2003, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
highlighted the potential contribution of conflict to the spread of
HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (28), and the topic
has been intensively discussed since then (29–32). Our finding,
that viral lineage imports are correlated with some risky sexual
practices, suggests that regions that have received new HIV
lineages also have appropriate conditions for those lineages to
flourish. While there might be further variability in behaviors
within a location, the small amount of data available from some
administrative regions limited statistical power to detect significant
correlations between virus movement and behaviors. Furthermore,
there were no available regional data on sexual behaviors in the
general population, but the IBBS PWID behavior data provided a
useful insight. It is important to mention that IBBS data represent
only urban PWID behaviors, since the survey is conducted only in
regional capitals. Nonetheless, the HIV epidemic in Ukraine is
largely urbanized: In 2013, a total of 77% of all HIV cases were
registered among the urban population (33). Regional capitals are
also human mobility hubs that accommodate the majority of IDP
(34). It could be argued that the dominance of sexual HIV trans-
mission in Ukraine [the proportion of sexually attributed HIV in-
cidence is growing every year (8)] can be attributed to the behaviors
prevalent in the PWID group (35). This is a widespread scenario in
Eastern European countries: HIV prevailed first in PWID and then
shifted toward the general population through unsafe sex practices
(27, 36–38). The war and internal movement of people to regions
with more reported high-risk sexual behaviors among PWID might
create a favorable environment for new HIV transmission and
facilitate the generalization of the Ukrainian epidemic.
Conclusions
Recent movement of HIV-infected people might change existing
network structures, disturbing the firewall effect and accelerating

 HIV flows within Ukraine. Enabling sustainable prevention ser-
vices and treatment provision in locations where services have been
physically disrupted because of the armed conflict is a priority (39).
However, we highlight the necessity of urgent preventive measures
in other parts of the country as well. Proactive integration into
routine HIV testing of people who have relocated due to the war, or
who frequently travel to the war zone, should become a component
of HIV prevention. Since our analysis likely reflects the redistribution
of existing infections, not the location of new transmissions, we
suggest that there is a need to continuously monitor the effect of the
war on HIV incidence and prevalence in Ukraine at both national
and regional levels.
Methods
Data.
Sequences sampling and phylogenetic analysis. We used 448 HIV-1 genetic se-
quences sampled in 2012–2015 from patients of 24 Ukrainian Regional Centers to
Prevent and Fight AIDS (AIDS Centers) (52% males) and available from the
Ukrainian HIV drug-resistance database. All of the available high-quality (<5% of
ambiguous nucleotides) subtype A (n = 427) sequences were used in the analysis.
All sequence IDs and accession numbers are in Dataset S1, Table S1 A and B.
We aligned the sequences using MEGA software (Version 7.0) (40) and then
manually edited the alignment, deleting 43 codon positions associated with drug
resistance (41) (the positions are listed in Supporting Information). The final
alignment consisted of 866 codons that corresponded to the 2,253–3,216 posi-
tions of the HXB2 HIV reference sequence (pol gene). We used the REGAv3 (42)
and COMET (43) subtyping tools to identify subtypes and recombinant sequences.
To explore the position of the 427 sequences from the Ukrainian HIV
database within the global subtype-A epidemic, we merged our sequences
with a globally representative subtype-A reference dataset, which consisted
of 2,199 sequences, using Clustal W (44). We then reconstructed an ML
phylogenetic tree with 2,626 sequences (427 Ukrainian and 2,199 reference)
using RAxML (45) to check the position of our sequences within the global
subtype-A diversity (Fig. 1). For further analyses, we chose 36 subtype-A HIV-
1 reference sequences sampled in 1987–2013 that were publicly available
from the Los Alamos database to improve the molecular clock calibration.
Sequences were selected to ensure a balanced geographical and temporal
representation. We used RAxML to build the ML tree of the 427 Ukrainian
and 36 reference sequences (Fig. S1) (the combined dataset; n = 463).
Behavioral data. Data on PWID behaviors came from the IBBS of PWID (n = 9,002)
conducted biyearly in 25 administrative regions of Ukraine in 2013. In IBBS-2013,
participants were asked about their injecting and sexual behaviors and tested
for HIV and hepatitis C virus antibodies by using rapid tests CITO TEST HIV 1/2/07.
More information on sampling, phylogenetic analysis, and reference
dataset, as well as additional information on the IBBS survey, can be found in
Supporting Information and elsewhere (25).
Phylogeographic Analysis.
Dating phylogenetics. We conducted molecular clock and discrete trait analyses
in BEAST (Version 1.8.4) (21). We used the general time-reversible nucleotide
substitution model with a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. We
used a log-normal uncorrelated relaxed clock model to account for rate het-
erogeneity among lineages (46). Analyses were run for 200,000,000 genera-
tions (burn-in of 30,000,000) until appropriate mixing and convergence of the
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler in the posterior target distribution was
obtained (effective sample size > 150). We used LogCombiner (22) to sub-
sample the posterior tree distribution, and after removing 15% of burn-in, the
resulting empirical tree distribution (n = 1,700 trees) was used in subsequent
phylogeographic analysis, after reference sequences were pruned by using
PAUP (47). The maximum clade credibility tree for the Ukrainian dataset was
reconstructed in TreeAnnotator and is presented in Fig. 2.
Discrete trait analysis. For the discrete trait phylogeographic analysis, we grouped
the 427 Ukrainian sequences from 24 different administrative regions into seven
geographic locations, as shown in Fig. 2 and Dataset S1, Table S1B. We grouped
the data into seven locations to avoid overparameterization of the model and to
ensure that every geographic location had at least 10 sequences. We also made sure
that this grouping was appropriate in the cultural and social context of Ukraine.
We computed a discrete phylogeographic analysis with the robust counting
method as implemented in BEAST, using an empirical tree distribution as described
(48–51). This approach inferred the expected number of viral migrations for
every pathway on a branch-by-branch basis. The location-exchange process
throughout the phylogeny was estimated by using asymmetric (nonreversible)
discrete-time Markov chains, which quantified the number of exporting and
importing virus-lineage movements for each pair of locations. We estimated
viral gene flow as the number of migration events, which is the number of
viral-lineage movements from one location to another.
In the first step of the analysis, we included the full Ukrainian dataset, n = 427.
In an attempt to account for bias that might arise from unequal allocation of
sequences per location, we ran additional analyses with reduced numbers of
sequences per location. Specifically, we conducted 10 replicate analyses, in
which we reduced the number of sequences in each location to the third
smallest number in the dataset (n = 57 for Center, East, Kyiv, Odessa, and South;
n = 10 for Crimea; and n = 22 for West). For each of these analyses, we ran-
domly selected different subsets of the sequences for each location, with the
same n = 314 for each subset. Phylogeographic analyses using the empirical tree
distributions were then performed for 5,000,000 generations (burn-in 5 × 106).
Phylogeographic transition. To check for changes in viral gene flow that might
be associated with the military conflict in the East, or with any Maidan-related
effects, we applied models with time-dependent lineage transition rates, i.e.,
an “epoch analysis” as implemented in BEAST (52). Specifically, we com-
pared the single-epoch model (in which pairwise rates of lineage movement
remained constant between 2012 and 2015) with the two-epoch model (in
which pairwise rates of lineage movement could be different before and
after the start of the conflict in 2013). This approach allowed us to test for a
change in viral gene flow after a specified time point. For the two-epoch
model, we chose the year 2013 as the transition time between the two
epochs. For this analysis, we merged the sequences from two locations: East
(Donetsk and Lugansk) and Other (all other sequences). We created 10 sub-
samples, down-sampling the number of sequences in the “Other” location to
meet the number of sequences in the East. We used path-sampling (53) and
stepping-stone-sampling (54) marginal likelihood estimators to determine
which epoch model fit the data best. The results of the epoch analysis showed
that the two-epoch model fit the data better than the single-epoch model.
This result was consistent across all 10 replicate datasets generated by random
subsampling (Dataset S1, Table S4). Additional data on epoch analysis and
model selection are available in Supporting Information.
Spearman Correlation Analysis. We performed a Spearman correlation test to
check whether the numbers of viral lineage migration exportation and im-
portation events were correlated with some of the behavioral and epidemio-
logical characteristics of locations. We ran two separate analyses of correlation to
individually explore factors that are associated with the number of exportation
and importation events. All of the P values for the correlation analyses were
adjusted for multiple comparisons by using the false discovery rate method (24).
For every location, we looked at the following:
(i) The sum of exportation viral lineage migration events from a location to
all of the other locations.
(ii) The sum of importation viral lineage migration events from a location
to all of the other locations.
Details of behavioral variable construction can be found in Supporting
Information.
Ethical Approval. HIV drug-resistance testing was performed at the L. V. Gro-
mashevskij Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, National Academy
of Sciences of Ukraine, following all Ukrainian legal and ethical requirements.
Fully anonymized viral gene sequences were transferred to Oxford through a
Material Transfer Agreement for molecular evolution analyses. Fully anonymized
aggregated behavioral data (IBBS) were obtained from the Alliance for Public
Health. The IBBS protocol and questionnaires were examined by the Committee
on Sociologist’s Professional Ethics at the Sociological Association of Ukraine. The
epidemiological component was examined by the Committee on Medical Ethics
of the L. V. Gromashevskij Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases,
National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
