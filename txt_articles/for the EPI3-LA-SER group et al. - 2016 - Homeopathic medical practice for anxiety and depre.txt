Abstract
Background: The purpose of the study was to compare utilization of conventional psychotropic drugs among
patients seeking care for anxiety and depression disorders (ADDs) from general practitioners (GPs) who strictly
prescribe conventional medicines (GP-CM), regularly prescribe homeopathy in a mixed practice (GP-Mx), or are
certified homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho).
Methods: This was one of three epidemiological cohort studies (EPI3) on general practice in France, which
included GPs and their patients consulting for ADDs (scoring 9 or more in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale, HADS). Information on all medication utilization was obtained by a standardised telephone interview at
inclusion, 1, 3 and 12 months.
Results: Of 1562 eligible patients consulting for ADDs, 710 (45.5 %) agreed to participate. Adjusted multivariate
analyses showed that GP-Ho and GP-Mx patients were less likely to use psychotropic drugs over 12 months, with
Odds ratio (OR) = 0.29; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.19 to 0.44, and OR = 0.62; 95 % CI: 0.41 to 0.94 respectively,
compared to GP-CM patients. The rate of clinical improvement (HADS <9) was marginally superior for the GP-Ho
group as compared to the GP-CM group (OR = 1.70; 95 % CI: 1.00 to 2.87), but not for the GP-Mx group (OR = 1.49;
95 % CI: 0.89 to 2.50).
Conclusions: Patients with ADD, who chose to consult GPs prescribing homeopathy reported less use of
psychotropic drugs, and were marginally more likely to experience clinical improvement, than patients managed
with conventional care. Results may reflect differences in physicians’ management and patients’ preferences as well
as statistical regression to the mean.

Background
Anxiety and depressive disorders (ADDs) are highly
prevalent worldwide and represent a leading reason for
consultation in primary care [1, 2]. Although systematic
reviews and guidelines [3, 4] recognise the efficacy of
antidepressant
and
psychotropic
drugs
for
specific
ADDs, heterogenity in the diagnostic approach of these
patients in primary care is partly responsible for the
non-optimal utilization of these drugs, particularly in
mild and moderate cases [5]. The prevalence of ADDs in
homeopathic care also ranks high, only surpassed by
low-back pain [6]. Patients who seek homeopathic care
differ from those preferring conventional medicine, but
the diagnostic make-up of their consultations has been
described as similar [7]. Evidence summarized in system-
atic reviews conducted to assess the benefit of homeop-
athy in ADDs is too limited to sufficiently draw firm
conclusions regarding the efficacy or effectiveness of
homeopathy in this indication [8–11]. However, its

 potential to reduce psychotropic drug utilization in
ADD patients who opt for this type of care has been
identified with minimal adverse effects, and potential
economic impacts on healthcare resources [12, 13]. In
France, homeopathy is practiced exclusively by physicians
and is partly reimbursed by National Health Insurance.
Physicians who prescribe homeopathy are either occa-
sional prescribers or have completed a certification in
homeopathic medicine accessible through private or-
ganisations (see, eg, www.cedh.org/).
This 1-year, population-based cohort study compared
patients’s real-life utilization of conventional psychotropic
drugs and clinical progression of ADDs between those
seeking care from general practitioners (GPs) who rarely
prescribe homeopathy (strict prescribers of conventional
medicines) (GP-CM), and those seeing regular prescribers
of homeopathy within a mixed practice (GP-Mx) or certi-
fied homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho).
Methods
Study design and selection of study subjects
This cohort study was conducted in France between
2007 and 2008 within the nationwide EPI3 survey of
primary care practice in a representative sample of GPs
and their patients [1]. The EPI3 survey included three
epidemiological follow-up cohort studies (hence the
name EPIdemiologic study – three cohorts) of common
reasons for consultation in primary care, one of which
focused on patients with ADDs (the two others being
musculoskeletal disorders and respiratory infections).
The EPI3 survey was an observational study where no
instructions were given to participating physicians or
patients in order to prevent interference in usual clin-
ical practice. The sample was drawn using a two-stage
sampling process. First, a random sample of GPs was
drawn from the French National Directory of Physi-
cians in primary care. Sampling of GPs was stratified
according to their declaration of prescribing prefer-
ences, obtained by telephone at the time of recruitment
and categorized into three groups: strict prescribers of
conventional medicine (GP-CM) who declared they
never or rarely used homeopathy; regular prescribers of
homeopathy in a mixed practice (GP-Mx); and certified
homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho). This classification of GPs
by type of management served as the basis for compar-
ing their patients. As GPs in the three groups were free
to prescribe conventional and/or homeopathic drugs,
this study did not compare patients by the type of
prescription issued but only by the type of physician
(prescribing preferences) they have chosen to consult.
The second-stage sampling consisted of a 1-day survey
of all patients attending the medical practice of each
participating GP during which a trained research assist-
ant surveyed all patients in the waiting room. For this
cohort study, consenting adult patients consulting for
all types of anxiety and depression symptoms were
invited to a baseline telephone interview within 72 h of
recruitment, which included the French adaptation of
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
questionnaire [14, 15]. The HADS is composed of two
sub-scales, one for anxiety and one for depression. The
subscales were only used for describing the study popu-
lation. All other analyses used the combined HADS
anxiety and depression scores. Patients scoring nine or
more in the HADS questionnaire were then invited to
follow-up interviews at 1, 3 and 12 months. Diagnoses
of anxiety and depression symptoms by GPs were based
on the GPs’ own clinical judgement, with no attempt at
standardization or external validation. This strategy was
aimed at being representative of all patients consulting
for ADD symptoms who were the most likely to receive
a prescription for a psychotropic drug in real-life
primary care.
Information collected
At inclusion, GPs completed a medical questionnaire for
each patient surveyed, including the main reason for con-
sultation and up to five other diagnoses (co-morbidities),
and all drugs prescribed that day. Diagnoses were
coded by a trained archivist using the ninth revision of
the International Classification of Diseases. All consenting
patients completed a self-administered questionnaire at
inclusion (waiting room), collecting information on
lifestyle, occupation, hospitalization history, number
of GP consultations in the past year, and the health-
related quality of life Short Form-12 (SF-12) [16].
Follow-up telephone interviews included the HADS
and spanned the patient’s history since the previous
interview regarding drug utilization (conventional and
homeopathy) and injuries (resulting from a fall, motor
vehicle collision, sport, or occupation). Moreover, the
12-month questionnaire evaluated lifetime history of
suicide attempts, specifying any such occurrence since
entry into the cohort. Drug utilization, whether pre-
scribed or obtained over the counter or from the
family pharmacy, was assessed using a standardized
method
known
as
Progressive
Assisted
Backward
Active Recall (PABAR), previously validated against
medical prescriptions [17, 18], and drugs were auto-
matically recorded using the anatomical therapeutic
chemical classification index (ATC), 2009 revision.
For patients participating in this ADD cohort study,
particular emphasis was put
on
psychotropic
and
homeopathic drugs commonly used in ADDs by spe-
cifically asking patients if they had taken any drug
from a list of 36 products that was read to them after
they had spontaneously reported medication taken in
that period.

 Statistical analysis
Differences at baseline between GP-CM, GP-Mx and
GP-Ho groups were assessed using multivariate logis-
tic regression analyses. A propensity score was com-
puted for each participant in the study on their
probability of belonging to either GP-Mx or GP-Ho
groups compared to the GP-CM group, according to
all variables listed in Table 1. The score was used to
adjust for differences between the groups in all subse-
quent
analyses.
Given the
imbalance
between
the
groups for severity of ADD at baseline, analyses were
stratified in two groups using the HADS score from 9
to 11 and 12 and above [19].
At each follow-up, a patient was declared to have
clinically improved if the HADS score fell below the
value of nine. Consumption of psychotropic drugs was
defined at each interview interval as the proportion of
patients declaring at least one utilization, since the
previous interview, of drugs belonging to the ATC clas-
ses N05B (anxiolytics), N05C (hypnotics and sedatives)
and N06A (antidepressants). ADD’s clinical improve-
ment at the 12-month follow-up, utilization of psycho-
tropics and occurrence of traumatic events (any during
the 12-month follow-up) were compared across the
three groups using the GP-CM group as the reference in
logistic regression adjusted for baseline characteristics

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) in the multi-

the differences in the likelihood of clinical improve-
ment and use of psychotropic drugs in the groups GP-Mx
and GP-H0 compared to the group GP-CM. All analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Results
Study population
The general EPI3 health survey included 825 GPs and
8559 patients. Among the patients, 1562 adults fulfilled
the specific inclusion criteria established for the ADD
cohort and 710 (45.5 %) who scored nine or higher on
the HADS agreed to participate and responded to at
least one follow-up interview, of which 660 were diag-
nosed by the physician with an anxiety disorder and 467
with a depressive disorder (not mutually exclusive).
Participants were slightly more often females (79.7 %)
than were non-participants (72.6 %), but the two groups
were very similar otherwise (Table 1). Compared to the
GP-CM group, patients who consulted a GP-Ho were
more often non-smoking females with a higher level of
education and a lower body mass index (BMI); differ-
ences that were statistically significant after taking into
account all other factors (Table 1). In addition, GP-Ho
participants were less likely to report the attending GP
as their regular physician (47.1 %) compared to GP-CM
(84.5 %). Overall, no significant difference was observed
between patients of the GP-Mx and GP-CM groups.
Clinical characteristics at baseline
Compared to the patients in the GP-CM group, those
consulting a GP-Ho were less likely to have a HADS
score equal to or above 12 (52.3 % versus 57.8 %, re-
spectively), to have a history of suicide attempts (14.2 %
versus 23.0 %, respectively), another ADD (53.6 % versus
60.3 %, respectively) or primary insomnia (34.3 % versus
40.4 %, respectively), all differences being statistically
significant (Table 2). Patients in the GP-Ho group also
had a lower number of co-morbidities, and fewer visits
to a GP and hospitalizations in the previous year,
compared to the GP-CM group. The profile of GP-Mx
patients was similar to that of GP-CM patients, except
for history of suicide attempt and hospitalization (all
causes) and a concomitant ADD, for which they resem-
bled patients from the GP-Ho group. Prescribing prefer-
ences of physicians in the three groups were confirmed
at baseline by their respective prescribing rates of
conventional psychotropic drugs (GP-CM: 80.8 %; GP-Mx:
71.9 %; GP-Ho: 32.9 %) and homeopathic drugs (GP-CM:
0.0 %, GP-Mx: 13.1 % and GP-Ho: 55.7 %).
Clinical evolution and outcomes
Figure 1 shows, for each group of patients, the evolution
of crude proportions for ADD clinical improvement
(HADS <9) at each follow-up point (Fig. 1a), and
proportions of patients reporting at least one psycho-
tropic drug utilization (Fig. 1b). Trends towards clinical
improvement over time were statistically significant
within each group (Chi-square for trend: P <0.001), with
faster clinical evolution for the GP-Ho group in the first
3 months, and highest improvement rate for the GP-Mx
group at 12 months. Crude clinical improvement rates
remained the lowest in the GP-CM group throughout
follow-up. Crude trends in psychotropic drug utilization
in the GP-CM and GP-Mx groups shadowed clinical
evolution to reach relatively similar values at 12 months
(68.0 and 63.5 % respectively), while it remained well
under 50 % at all times in the GP-Ho group.
After controlling for potential confounders and ba-
seline characteristics, the probability of ADD clinical
improvement (HADS <9) over the 12-month follow-up
was 1.7 times more likely among GP-Ho patients com-
pared to GP-CM [OR = 1.70 (95 % CI: 1.00 to 2.87)], a
result of borderline statistical significance (Table 3). The
probability of clinical improvement among GP-Mx pa-
tients did not differ from that observed in GP-CM
patients after controlling for all other factors [OR = 1.49
(95 % CI: 0.89 to 2.50]. Consumption of psychotropic
drugs was significantly lower in both GP-Ho and GP-Mx
groups compared to the GP-CM group, being respect-
ively less than one third as likely [OR = 0.29 (95 %
CI: 0.19 to 0.44)] and less than two thirds as likely
[OR = 0.62 (95 % CI: 0.41 to 0.94)]. These effect sizes
were not affected by the severity of ADD at baseline,
with similar results for patients with initial HADS
scores above and below the value of 12 within each
group.
Self-reported
injuries
and
suicide
attempts
were insufficient in number to allow modelling in
regression analyses; 14.8, 7.11 and 9.45 % declared
injuries while 4.97, 1.92 and 1.38 % declared a suicide
attempt in the GP-CM, GP-Mx and GP-Ho groups,
respectively. None of those differences was statistically
significant in unadjusted statistical analyses.
Discussion
This population-based, prospective cohort study described
the real-life clinical management of patients with ADD
consulting primary care physicians with prescribing pref-
erences for homeopathy. Our results first showed that
patients who chose GP-Ho differed substantially from
Grimaldi-Bensouda et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2016) 16:125 
Page 4 of 9
 other patients, a finding well described elsewhere [20].
The original finding of this large cohort study is that the
lower use of conventional psychotropic drugs in that
group of patients did not compromise the evolution of
their ADD once stratified by its severity at baseline.
Indeed, patients in the GP-Ho group were marginally
more likely to experience clinical improvement than
patients managed with conventional care. Beside the dif-
ferent nature of these patients, two other factors could
explain the results. First, homeopathic physicians probably
diagnose ADDs differently and may transmit different
information to their patients regarding prognosis. In the
context of the present study, homeopathy is practiced by
GPs who are all trained in conventional medicine and
have access to all diagnostic and therapeutic resources
recommended for ADDs in primary care. The GP-Ho
group of physicians represented a distinct type of manage-
ment and patient–physician interaction, which in itself
may account for a large part of the therapeutic results
observed. In addition, inefficacy of psychotropic drugs and
statistical regression to the mean are two other potential
contributions to the results.
A second explanation derives from the acknowledg-
ment that conventional drugs lack efficacy in a large
number of ADD patients seen in primary care [21]. In
addition, although clinical guidance on ADD is widely
available in general practice [4, 22], there is evidence to
suggest a lack of implementation in real-life situations

 with regard to access to treatment and to poor patient
compliance with psychotropic drugs, including early
drop-out from treatment and overdosing [5, 23–25].
Therefore, a lower utilization of a largely ineffective
therapy should not compromise the clinical evolution of
ADD overall. In those conditions, homeopathy can be
viewed as an additional tool to support patients inclined
to use this type of care without resorting to conventional
drugs when they are not indicated. The potential positive
impact on healthcare costs of this drug-sparing strategy
remains to be estimated at the population level [12, 13].
Another important difference for patients in the GP-
Ho group was the low proportion (47.1 %) declaring the
attending physician as their regular GP, nearly half of
that observed in the GP-CM and GP-Mx groups (84.5
and 83.1 %, respectively). One potential explanation for
this difference might be that some patients who consult
in homeopathic care do so after a subjective perception
of failure to improve with the treatment prescribed by
their regular physician, an effect that has been observed
elsewhere [26], or who do not see a GP regularly. How-
ever, the influence of healthcare prior to entry in this co-
hort study, positive or negative, could not be assessed
and remains only a potential explanation for the results.
Systematic reviews have shown inconsistent results for
the effectiveness of homeopathy in depression and anx-
iety. The quality of the evidence is limited in part by in-
adequate study designs and insufficient number of
patients [8, 9]. The results of this study cannot be inter-
preted as effectiveness of conventional against homeo-
pathic care. Patients in the three groups of physicians
were compared on the basis of the prescribing prefer-
ences for homeopathy by their GPs, all of whom were
free to prescribe conventional drugs also (indeed, 32.9 %
of GPs certified in homeopathy did prescribe a conven-
tional psychotropic drug at inclusion). The category
of GPs who declared themselves as regular prescribers
of homeopathy without being trained as homeopathic

 practitioners (GP-Mx) became an interesting group as it
allowed the observation of patients in a naturally mixed
setting combining homeopathic and conventional medi-
cine. That group differed little from the GP-CM group,
which would indicate that it was mostly the type of
management rather than the type of prescription that
might explain the results. Patients in the GP-Mx
group also used less psychotropic drugs, indicating
that patients’ preference for homeopathy plays an
important role in these results, as suggested by some
authors [27, 28].
Strengths and limitations
As the study was appended to a population health
survey, it provided a unique opportunity to assemble a
pool of potential patients seen in primary care, with no
selection criteria applied prior to the invitation to join
this cohort study. The distribution of physicians and
patients participating to the EPI3 general survey was
close to what is known about medical demography and
reasons for consultation in France [1]. A strength of this
study was the variety of information collected at baseline,
covering socio-demographic and clinical characteristics
which allowed the differences between the groups to be
described in detail. Care was also taken to ensure quality
of outcome measures. HADS has been shown to be highly
sensitive and specific for diagnoses of ADDs in previous
primary care studies [15]. Drug utilization was obtained
from patient interviews using a methodology that had
been previously validated, although not specifically for
psychotropic drugs [17, 18]. The quality of psychotropic
drug reporting should not differ much across the three
groups of patients, as they were unaware of the specific
hypotheses regarding drug consumption. The method-
ology has shown excellent recall capacity up to 2-year
follow-up and has the advantage of identifying drugs
purchased over the counter and from the family phar-
macy, which are not accounted for in prescription
databases and potentially represent an important source
of psychotropic drug utilization [29]. It should be noted
that while psychotropic drug utilization described at base-
line (Table 2) was obtained from physicians’ reports, pa-
tients’ reporting was preferred for the analyses of evolution
of psychotropic utilization over time.
One of the main limitations of this study was its low
participation rate, at 45 % of eligible patients. Although
generally considered acceptable for a general health
survey of this type, in which patients are asked to
participate in a 1-year follow-up study, the participation
rate leaves the results open to potential selection bias.
Differences between participants and non-participants
were small, however, and participation rates were almost
identical across the three groups of GPs, which made
comparison biases unlikely. Also, co-morbidity and SF-
12 scores were similar between the groups and consist-
ent with other French and European studies [30–33].
Nevertheless, sample size was sufficient to compare
groups for psychotropic drug utilization and rates of
clinical improvement, but not for safety outcomes such
as occurrence of injuries and suicide attempts that were
too few to allow proper statistical modelling.
Another limitation of this study was the nature of
patients’ ADD symptoms and GPs’s diagnoses; these
were the basis for patients’ recruitment and could have
differed in the three groups of physicians. The recruit-
ment strategy was chosen to reflect primary care prac-
tice in real life, but could have introduced a bias with
systematic differences in the diagnostic make-ups of the
groups. In effect, patients in the GP-Ho group had less
severe ADD on almost all indicators, including the
lifetime history of a suicide attempt, which was almost
half in the GP-Ho and GP-Mx groups compared to the
conventional practice (GP-CM) group (Table 2). This
imbalance at baseline could explain a lower use of psy-
chotropic drugs (bias by indication) and better clinical
outcomes in those two groups, even when controlling
for this potential bias in the analyses. Stratification of

 the analyses in lower and higher HADS patients at inclu-
sion was an attempt to better view the effect of this
potential bias. Similarity of results in the two popula-
tions of patients indicated that baseline differences alone
could probably not explain the results.
Conclusions
Patients with ADDs choosing to consult GPs who pre-
scribe homeopathy in addition to conventional medicine
reported use of fewer psychotropic drugs and were
marginally more likely to experience clinical improve-
ment than patients managed with conventional care.
These findings may result from the combined effect of
inefficacy of conventional psychotropic drugs and statis-
tical regression to the mean as well as from effective
homeopathic management.
