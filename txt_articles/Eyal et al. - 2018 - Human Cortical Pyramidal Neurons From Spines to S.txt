We present detailed models of pyramidal cells from human neocortex, including models
on their excitatory synapses, dendritic spines, dendritic NMDA- and somatic/axonal Na+
spikes that provided new insights into signal processing and computational capabilities
of these principal cells. Six human layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal cells (HL2/L3 PCs)
were modeled, integrating detailed anatomical and physiological data from both fresh
and postmortem tissues from human temporal cortex. The models predicted particularly
large AMPA- and NMDA-conductances per synaptic contact (0.88 and 1.31 nS,
respectively) and a steep dependence of the NMDA-conductance on voltage. These
estimates were based on intracellular recordings from synaptically-connected HL2/L3
pairs, combined with extra-cellular current injections and use of synaptic blockers,
and the assumption of five contacts per synaptic connection. A large dataset of
high-resolution reconstructed HL2/L3 dendritic spines provided estimates for the EPSPs
at the spine head (12.7 ± 4.6 mV), spine base (9.7 ± 5.0 mV), and soma (0.3 ±
0.1 mV), and for the spine neck resistance (50–80 M�). Matching the shape and
firing pattern of experimental somatic Na+-spikes provided estimates for the density
of the somatic/axonal excitable membrane ion channels, predicting that 134 ± 28
simultaneously activated HL2/L3-HL2/L3 synapses are required for generating (with 50%
probability) a somatic Na+ spike. Dendritic NMDA spikes were triggered in the model
when 20 ± 10 excitatory spinous synapses were simultaneously activated on individual
dendritic branches. The particularly large number of basal dendrites in HL2/L3 PCs and
the distinctive cable elongation of their terminals imply that ∼25 NMDA-spikes could
be generated independently and simultaneously in these cells, as compared to ∼14
in L2/3 PCs from the rat somatosensory cortex. These multi-sites non-linear signals,
together with the large (∼30,000) excitatory synapses/cell, equip human L2/L3 PCs
with enhanced computational capabilities. Our study provides the most comprehensive
model of any human neuron to-date demonstrating the biophysical and computational
distinctiveness of human cortical neurons.

Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
INTRODUCTION
Understanding the human brain is of high priority for
humankind, as is manifested by the thousands of studies
published every year on the various aspects of the human
brain and by the large-scale projects initiated in the last decade
worldwide (Markram et al., 2015; Amunts et al., 2016; Koch and
Jones, 2016; Martin and Chun, 2016; Poo et al., 2016). This is
a challenging task; not only because of the complexity of the
brain and the technical difficulties involved, but also because
ethical limitations do not allow all of the necessary datasets to
be acquired directly from human brains. Consequently, most
of our present knowledge of the fine structure of the brain
has been obtained from experimental animals (DeFelipe, 2015).
However, certain fundamental structural and behavioral aspects
are unique to humans and the functional significance of the
human-specific structure should be dealt with by employing a
range of specific strategies. Indeed, a major goal is to improve
the current technologies for the microanatomical, neurochemical
and physiological analysis of the human brain by adapting
methodologies that are typically used to examine the brain of
experimental animals.
The use of biopsy material obtained during neurosurgical
treatment for epilepsy, or following the removal of certain brain
tumors, provide an excellent opportunity to study the micro-
structure of the human brain, despite the fact that different
medical characteristics of the patients may modify the brain
tissue. The resected tissue can be immediately immersed in
the fixative and therefore the ultrastructure and quality of
the labeling achieved using a variety of markers for histology
and immunocytochemistry is comparable to that obtained in
experimental animals (del Río and DeFelipe, 1994; Alonso-
Nanclares et al., 2008). Similarly, this resected human brain
tissue proved to be of great value in the 1980s and 1990s to
directly study the functional characteristics of human brain
tissue in vitro. These studies have mostly aimed to analyze the
mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis (reviewed
in Avoli et al., 2005; Köhling and Avoli, 2006). Recently, there
has been renewed interest in using “non-epileptic” cortical
samples (removed during surgery on brain tumors) or “non-
spiking” regions with normal histology (removed at a distance
from the epileptic focus) in epileptic patients, as they provide
an unprecedented opportunity to study human cells and local
circuits, both biophysically and computationally (Szabadics et al.,
2006; Verhoog et al., 2013; Testa-Silva et al., 2014; Tian et al.,
2014; Mohan et al., 2015; Varga et al., 2015; Eyal et al., 2016;
Molnár et al., 2016).
The other main source of tissue to study the structure
of human brain is from autopsy of control individuals. In
principle, this is the only source of tissue that is free of
known pathology, but it is not suitable for electrophysiological
studies. Another major limitation in using autopsied tissue is
the post-mortem time; the longer the post-mortem time delay
the larger are the alterations observed in the measurements
at all levels of biological organization (genetic, molecular,
biochemical, anatomical). In previous studies we have shown
that post-mortem times shorter than 5 h yield excellent results
using fine anatomical tools like intracellular injections in fixed
material or electron microscopy techniques (Elston et al., 2001;
Benavides-Piccione et al., 2005; Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2013).
Thus, anatomical and physiological studies of the human brain
should ideally be performed by combining data from biopsies and
autopsies.
Our own recent studies on human cortical neurons have
shown that they are distinguished from rodent neurons in some
fundamental properties. Human L2/L3 PCs are anatomically
more extended and have elaborated dendritic trees (Mohan
et al., 2015; Deitcher et al., 2017); have unique membrane
properties (Eyal et al., 2016) and have a large number of dendritic
spines/synapses per cell (Elston et al., 2001; Benavides-Piccione
et al., 2002; DeFelipe et al., 2002). These neurons are capable
of tracking, via their axonal spikes, very fast modulations of
their dendritic inputs and their synapses recover rapidly from
depression (Eyal et al., 2014; Testa-Silva et al., 2014). Still,
many other biophysical properties of human pyramidal neurons
remain unknown, including the magnitude, time-course and
conductance composition of their synaptic inputs, and the nature
of their dendritic and somatic non-linearities. These properties
are key for constructing realistic models of these cells and,
based on these models, for understanding signal processing and
computational capabilities of human neurons.
To extract synaptic, dendritic and computational properties
of individual neurons based on diverse morphological and
biophysical experiments, an overarching theoretical framework
is required. Rall’s cable theory for dendrites (Rall, 1959) and his
compartmental modeling approach (Rall, 1964; Segev et al., 1995)
provided such theoretical framework. Indeed, in the last few
decades, detailed compartmental models have been constructed
for a variety of neuron types for different species and brain
regions—from flies to birds, to rodents and cats; and from
hippocampus to cerebellum, basal ganglia and the neocortex.
These experimentally-based models provided key insights into
the mechanisms governing the large dynamic repertoire of
neurons and their computational and plastic capabilities (reviews
in Koch and Segev, 2000; Herz et al., 2006; Major et al., 2013;
Stuart et al., 2016). But to what extent do these neuron models
in non-human mammals (e.g., rodents) provide insights into the
biophysics and computational capabilities of human neurons?
In our recent work (Eyal et al., 2016) we constructed passive
compartmental models of HL2/L3 PCs to study their membrane
properties. To our surprise, we found that the specific membrane
capacitance (Cm) of human neurons is distinctive; ∼0.5 µF/cm2,
half of the commonly accepted “universal” value (∼1 µF/cm2)
for biological membranes. The low Cm has important functional
implications for signal processing in these cells. This initial
surprise has led us to perform hereby a more comprehensive
modeling study of HL2/L3 PCs.
In the present work, we integrated a wide range of anatomical
and physiological data on six HL2/L3 PCs, including the
fine anatomy of dendritic spines, which provided the most
comprehensive models of human cortical pyramidal neurons
to date. We extended our existing passive models of HL2/L3
PCs in order to estimate their synaptic properties, in particular
the NMDAR-kinetics, and to estimate the properties of the ion

channels underlying the somatic/axonal spiking mechanisms.
Based on these parameters, we predicted the conditions for the
generation of NMDA spikes in individual dendritic branches
receiving excitatory axo-spinous synapses, as well as the number
of excitatory synapses required to initiate axo-somatic (output)
Na+ spikes. Our models show that human L2/L3 PCs have
the capacity to generate tens of independent dendritic NMDA
spikes (supporting local non-linear dendritic computations).
We further show that, despite the extended dendritic cable
structure of human L2/L3 PCs, a relatively small number (∼135)
of synchronously activated excitatory axo-spinous synapses is
required to generate an axonal output spike. We concluded that
human L2/L3 pyramidal cells expand the computational/memory
capacity of similar cells, e.g., in rodents, because of their
increased numbers of local dendritic non-linear subunits,
increased excitability due to low Cm value and their large number
(∼30,000) of dendritic spines/excitatory synapses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Data
Human Brain Slice Preparation
All procedures on human tissue were performed with the
approval of the Medical Ethical Committee (METc) of the
VU University Medical Centre (VUmc), with written informed
consent by patients involved to use brain tissue removed
for treatment of their disease for scientific research, and in
accordance with Dutch license procedures and the declaration
of Helsinki (VUmc METc approval ‘kenmerk 2012/362’). After
resection, the neocortical tissue was placed within 30 s in ice-
cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) slicing solution which
contained in (mM): 110 choline chloride, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-
glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgCl2, 3.1 sodium pyruvate,
2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 0.5 CaCl2 −300 mOsm, saturated
with carbogen gas (95% O2/ 5% CO2) and transported to the
neurophysiology laboratory located 500 m from the operating
room. The transition time between resection of the tissue and the
start of preparing slices was <15 min. Neocortical slices (350–
400 µm thickness) were prepared in ice-cold slicing solution,
and were then transferred to holding chambers filled with aCSF
containing (in mM): 126 NaCl; 3 KCl; 1 NaH2PO4; 1 MgSO4;
2 CaCl2; 26 NaHCO3; 10 glucose −300 mOsm, bubbled with
carbogen gas (95% O2/ 5% CO2). Here, slices were stored for
20 min at 34◦C, and for at least 30 min at room temperature
before recording.
3D Reconstructions of Dendritic Arbors and Dendritic
Spines of HL2/L3 Pyramidal Cells
Six dendritic morphologies of L2/L3 from human temporal
cortex, residing at the depths of 675–1,204 µm below the pia were
used in this study. These are the same morphologies used in Eyal
et al. (2016), taken from Mohan et al. (2015). These neurons were
recorded and then labeled using biocytin as a marker that was
revealed with DAB using the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride and the avidin–biotin–peroxidase method.
For data on dendritic spines we used L3 pyramidal cells
that were reconstructed with a confocal microscope after
intracellular injection with Lucifer Yellow in the temporal
cortex, corresponding to Brodmann’s area 20 (Garey, 2006).
These neurons were obtained from two human males (aged
40 and 85) obtained at autopsy (2–3 h post-mortem) following
traffic accidents. This human material has been used in a
previous study (Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013). We used data on
dendritic spines from the post-mortem tissue instead of directly
measuring dendritic spines from the recorded cells because
confocal microscopy of Lucifer Yellow-labeled neurons is more
appropriate to analyze the shape and the size of dendritic spines
than light microscopy of biocytin-labeled neurons. The complete
morphology of over 8,300 dendritic spines was reconstructed
in 3D as in Benavides-Piccione et al. (2013). Briefly, spines
and dendritic branches were imaged using a Leica TCS 4D
confocal scanning laser attached to a Leitz DMIRB fluorescence
microscope. Consecutive stacks of images were acquired using
a 0.075 × 0.075 × 0.28 µm3 voxel size (Leica Objective Plan-
Apochromat 63x/1.30 NA glycerol DIC M27) to capture the full
dendritic depths, lengths, and widths of the dendrites (Figure 2).
Dendritic spine structure was analyzed in 20 basal dendrites
and 16 main apical dendrites (10 basal dendrites and 8 main
apical dendrites per case), using Imaris 6.4.0 (Bitplane AG,
Zurich, Switzerland). Correction factors used in other studies
in which dendritic spines were quantified in opaque material
(e.g., Golgi method or biocytin/DAB material) were not used in
the present study as the fluorescent labeling and the high-power
reconstruction allowed the visualization of dendritic spines that
protrude from the underside of dendrites. Since confocal stacks
of images intrinsically result in a z-dimension distension, a
correction factor of 0.84 was applied to that dimension. This
factor was calculated using a 4.2 µm Tetraspeck Fluorescent
microsphere (Molecular Probes) under the same parameters used
for the acquisition of dendritic stacks. No optical deconvolution
was used for spine reconstruction. Finally, dendritic spines with
a head diameter below the resolution limit were not considered
in the present study. However, for the purposes of modeling,
this factor is probably insignificant since, in a previous electron
microscopic study, it was found that “thin” dendritic spines (i.e.,
those that lacked clear heads, resembling the filopodia found at
earlier developmental stages) are non-synaptic (Arellano et al.,
2007).
For modeling of typical dendritic spines, which establish at
least one synaptic contact, we measured the spine neck length,
spine neck diameter and spine head area of a selection of 150
dendritic spines (Figure S3). Only spines showing a clear head
whose morphology could be captured using a single surface
of a particular intensity threshold were included in the study.
The spine neck length and spine neck diameter were manually
marked in each selected dendritic spine from the point of
insertion in the dendritic shaft to the spine head, while rotating
the image in 3D (Figure 2).
Electrophysiology (Acute Living Slices)
Whole-cell, patch clamp electrophysiology recordings were made
from human L2/L3 pyramidal neurons as described previously
(Verhoog et al., 2013; Testa-Silva et al., 2014). Whole-cell
recordings were made using uncoated, standard borosilicate

glass pipettes. Recordings were made using multiclamp 700B
amplifiers (molecular devices) and were digitized using Axon
Instruments Digidata 1440A. Recording aCSF matched the
solution of the aCSF in which slices were stored. The recording
temperature was 32–35◦C. Internal solutions were (in mM): 110
Kgluconate; 10 KCl; 10 HEPES; 10 K2Phosphocreatine; 4 ATP-
Mg; 0.4 GTP, biocytin 5 mg/ml, pH adjusted with KOH to 7.3
(290–300 mOsm).
EPSPs From Paired Recordings
EPSPs were measured from 10 connected pairs of L2/L3 human
pyramidal neurons (Testa-Silva et al., 2014, Figure S1). These
experimental EPSPs came from a different set of neurons than
those used in Eyal et al. (2016). We therefore used experimental
EPSPs measured in HL2/L3 PCs that exhibit cable properties
(input resistance, membrane time constant) similar to our
neuron models. The membrane time constant for the post
synaptic cell from which the EPSP was recorded was determined
by “peeling” the tail of the EPSP (Rall, 1969). The 10 connected
pairs used in this work come from cells with time constants in
the range of 12–22 ms. Protocols for experiments are available in
Testa-Silva et al. (2014).
Extracellular Stimulation and NMDA Data
EPSPs were evoked every 7 s by extracellular stimulation using
two bipolar stimulating electrodes in glass pipettes loaded with
extracellular/recording aCSF that were positioned extracellularly,
100–150 µm away from the soma and ∼50 µm lateral to the
cell’s apical dendrite. Duration (50 µs) and amplitude (∼40 µA,
range 30–70 µA) of extracellular stimulation were controlled
by Isoflex stimulators (A.M.P.I.). For each cell, two extracellular
stimuli were applied at two different loci with respect to the
cell body of the post-synaptic cell (6 experimental EPSPs).
Seventeen EPSPs were evoked and averaged before the use of
blockers. Then, NMDA-receptor mediated EPSPs were isolated
by blocking AMPA and kainate receptors with NBQX (1 µM,
bath-applied, dissolved in recording aCSF) and blocking GABAA
with Bicuculline or gabazine (10 µM, bath-applied, disssolved in
recording aCSF). For one of these cells (Figure 4B) we already
had a passive model from Eyal et al. (2016). The model was
based on brief current injections into the cell as well as its 3D
morphology (Eyal et al., 2016, Figure 1c5). We used this model
when fitting the NMDA-receptor kinetics (Figure 4C, see below
for more details).
Train of Somatic Action Potentials
A step of depolarizing current of 1 s long was injected to the
somata of the six HL2/L3 pyramidal cells that are the focus of this
paper. Current amplitudes were adjusted so that each cell fired at
about ∼10 Hz (examples are shown in Figure 7A). This stimulus
was repeated 10 times or more per cell, providing sufficient
statistics to use the multiple objective optimization (MOO) to
develop channel-based models for these spikes (see below). All
traces were sampled at 100–250 kHz and low-passed filtered at
14–15 kHz.
I-F Curves of HL2/L3 PCs
We computed the I-F curve for 25 additional HL2/L3 PCs (I-
F curves for the six modeled cells were not available) as part
of our modeling efforts to match experimental results to model
performance using the MOO algorithm (see below). These I-
F curves were computed from the spike trains following 1 sec
depolarizing step current of different supra-threshold amplitudes
(Deitcher et al., 2017). Nearby points in the I-F curve were
connected by linear lines; individual I-F curves were then
normalized by the input current that lead to 10 Hz firing rate.
This normalization method allowed us to constrain each of our
models to have I-F curve similar to the mean I-F curve of HL2/L3
PCs (see also Hay et al., 2011). The 25 normalized I-F curves
and their mean are shown in Figure 7B (gray and black traces,
respectively).
Modeling
Simulations
Simulations were performed using NEURON 7.4 (Carnevale and
Hines, 2006) running on a grid of 60 Sun 4100 AMD 64-bit
Opteron dual core (240 cores in total), running Linux 2.6, or on
grid of 40 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 with 16 cores per node
(640 cores in total), running Redhat 6.6.
Passive Neuron Models
In
Eyal
et
al.
(2016),
we
constructed
detailed
passive
compartmental models for six 3D reconstructed L2/L3 pyramidal
neurons from human temporal cortex. The three passive
parameters (Cm, Ra, Rm) in these models were optimized for
each modeled cell such that the theoretical transients following
brief/small current steps generated by the model closely fit the
corresponding experimental transient. Details could be found
in Eyal et al. (2016). One key result from this study was that in
human neurons, Cm is half (0.5 µF/cm2) than the “universal”
value of 1 µF/cm2. In the present work, we use these six models
as the passive skeleton onto which experimentally-constrained
synaptic and membrane non-linearities were added.
Membrane area of the dendritic spines, which are abundant
in human pyramidal cells, was incorporated globally into the 3D
reconstructed dendritic models using the factor Fspines,
Fspines = dendritic membrane area + total spine area
dendritic membrane area
(1)
The incorporation of dendritic spines into a particular dendritic
branch was implemented by multiplying Cm by Fspines and
dividing Rm by Fspines as described previously (Rapp et al., 1992).
Spine and shaft areas were computed using reconstructions of
3D images from confocal microscopy of samples from two post
mortem brains (Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013, see Figure 2
below). This resulted in an Fspines value of 1.9. Spine membrane
area was incorporated into the modeled neuron only in dendritic
segments that are at a distance of at least 60 µm from the soma,
due to the low density of spines in more proximal branches
(Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013). More details can be found in
Eyal et al. (2016).

Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
Model for Dendritic Spines
Individual dendritic spines receiving excitatory synaptic input
were modeled in detail (Figures 3–6, 8) using two compartments
per spine; one for the spine neck and one for the spine head.
The spine neck was modeled using a cylinder of length 1.35 µm
and diameter of 0.25 µm, whereas the spine head was modeled
as an isopotential compartment with a total area of 2.8 µm2. The
dimensions for these compartments were based on the average
3D reconstructed dendritic spine of human temporal cortex L3
pyramidal cells (see the “3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors
and dendritic spines of HL2/L3 pyramidal cells” section above,
and Figure S3). The passsive parameters (Cm, Rm, Ra) of the spine
were similar to those of the dendrites. This spine model led to a
spine neck resistance of 50–80 M�.
Synaptic Inputs
We simulated AMPA-based and NMDA-based synaptic currents
as follows,
Isyn = gsyn (t, V) ∗(V − Esyn)
(2)
where gsyn is the synaptic conductance change and Esyn is the
reversal potential for the synaptic current. Esyn was 0 mV for both
the AMPA and the NMDA currents.
The synaptic conductance was modeled for both AMPA and
the NMDA components, using two state kinetic scheme synapses
– with rise time (τrise) and decay time (τdecay) constants:
gsyn (t, V) = B∗gmax∗N∗(exp(−t/τdecay) − exp(−t/τrise)) (3)
Here gmax is the peak conductance and N is a normalization
factor given by:
N =
1
exp(−tpeak/τdecay) − exp(−tpeak/τrise)
(4)
and tpeak (time of the peak conductance) is calculated as:
tpeak =
τrise∗τdecay
τdecay − τrise
∗ log
�τdecay
τrise
�
(5)
AMPA kinetics was kept constant throughout this study and only
its peak conductance was fitted for the various cases studied. For
modeling AMPA-based conductance, B was set to 1 (voltage-
independent conductance). Standard values for τrise and τdecay
were 0.3 and 1.8 ms, respectively. We tried other values but they
led to a poorer fit between the theoretical and experimental EPSPs
shown in Figure 1D. NMDA conductance is voltage dependent.
In this work, B was defined using the equation as in (Jahr and
Stevens, 1990):
B =
1
1 + exp (−γ ∗V) ∗

Mg2+ concentration was 1 mM in the model and other
parameters were computed so that they best fit the experimental
results (see Figure 4, and section “Modeling the NMDA-Based
Current to Fit the Experimental Results”).
Shape Index Curves for Estimating the Dendritic Loci
of HL2/L3-HL2/L3 Synaptic Connections
Experimental EPSPs were measured via patch recordings from
10 synaptically-connected L2/L3-L2/L3 neuron pairs (Testa-Silva
et al., 2010). The EPSPs were recorded from the soma of the
post synaptic neuron, following the activation of a single spike
at its presynaptic L2/L3 neuron. These 10 connected cell pairs
were not reconstructed in 3D. We therefore selected one 3D
reconstructed L2/L3 neuron as our prototypical neuron (see
Figure 1C and also Figure 1A in Eyal et al., 2016) and used
this model to construct a “shape index curve” (EPSP rise time
vs. half-width) as in Rall et al. (1967) in order to estimate the
putative location of the excitatory synapses that gave rise to the
experimental EPSPs. Although it would be preferable to model
each one of the postsynaptic cell from which the EPSPs were
recorded from, we believe that the morpho-electrotonic variance
among HL2/L3 PCs is sufficiently small so that our conclusions,
using a prototypical neuron for constructing the “shape index
curve,” for characterizing the dendritic “territory” of HL2/L3–
HL2/L3 synaptic connections and the range of their conductance
values is valid.
For simplicity, we started by assuming that the HL2/L3–
HL2/L3 connection is formed by a single synapse. The theoretical
shape index curve was calculated whereby each of the model
electric compartments was activated by a single AMPA-synapse
(see above). Then, we superimposed the experimental EPSP
half-width vs. rise time on this theoretical curve (black dots in
Figure 1B). We defined an electric compartment in the model
to be a putative synaptic contact if its shape index value was
inside a circle with a diameter of 1 ms around the experimental
EPSPs shape index (four of these circles are shown in Figure 1B
bottom). Then we used NEURON’s PRAXIS optimizer (Brent,
1976; Carnevale and Hines, 2006) to find the peak AMPA
conductance (gAMPA) for each putative synapse that resulted with
the best fit to the experimental EPSP (Figure 1D). The estimated
synaptic peak conductance was calculated as the average peak
conductance over all putative locations.
Next, we assumed that five synaptic contacts are formed
per HL2/L3–HL2/L3 connection, similar to the average value
for L2/3 and L5 PCs in rodents (Feldmeyer et al., 2002,
2006; Markram et al., 2015). For each group of putative
synapses obtained above, we randomly selected five synapses,
from the suggested putative locations when assuming a single
contact per axon, and activated them simultaneously. We
then ran the optimization procedure to obtain the peak
conductance/contact. This process was repeated 100 times and
the mean AMPA conductance value/contact was estimated as
shown in Table S1.
The above estimations were performed assuming that,
for
a
single
connection,
only
AMPA
conductance
is
activated. This is justified as the activation of a single
synaptic
connection
generates

small (8.6 ± 6.5 mV) to activate a significant NMDAR
current (Figure 5). This allowed us at a later point to
build a model for the NMDA-kinetics and conductance
amplitude that is based on the results from the earlier part
(see below, and Figure 4). We validated that the addition
of NMDA conductances to the modeled synapses does not
change significantly the results of Figure 1, Table S1, and
Figure S4.
Modeling the NMDA-Based Current to Fit the
Experimental Results
The process of fitting the NMDA model kinetics to the
experimental results was based on having both the morphology of
the post-synaptic cell (Figure 4B), the somatic voltage transients
(Eyal et al., 2016, Figure 1d5) and the composite EPSPs recorded
from the soma following extracellular simulation with and
without AMPA blockers, all from the same cell (Figure 4C). This
allowed us to use the passive model of this cell from Eyal et al.
(2016) and, on top of it, add AMPA- and NMDA- based currents
such that the model fits the properties of extracellularly generated
somatic EPSPs in this cell (Figure 4).
The optimization of the synaptic parameters that fit the
experimentally-recorded composite EPSP was achieved as
follows. First, between 15 and 30 synapses were randomly
distributed in a restricted part of the apical tree (near the location
of the extracellular electrode); each of the synapses having
both NMDA and AMPA conductance. For the optimization,
the NMDA peak conductance and its kinetics (τrise and τdecay
in Equation 5 and the “steepness” factor γ in Equation 6), as
well as the AMPA peak conductance were free parameters. The
parameter n in Equation (6) remained constant in this work with
a value of 0.28 mM-1 as found by Jahr and Stevens (1990) for an
extracellular solution with 1 mM magnesium concentration. We
also tried other available models for the NMDA kinetics (Rhodes,
2006; Sarid et al., 2007), but those led to a poorer fit of the data.
The optimization was achieved by first fitting the model response
to the experimental EPSP in the presence of AMPA blockers.
In the experiments, a competitive antagonist was used to block
the AMPA receptors, therefore in the simulations we allowed
the model to include a small AMPA conductance (see below).
This implied that, even in the presence of an AMPA blocker,
a strong extracellular stimulus could activate a small APMA
current which, in turn, could help activate the NMDA-current,
as indeed was found experimentally.
For these simulations, 60,000 seeds were used to select the
number of synapses and their dendritic location; each one of
them was optimized using the PRAXIS algorithm in NEURON
(Brent, 1976; Carnevale and Hines, 2006). The best 20,000
models, based on their fit to the data (see below), were chosen
for the next step. In this stage, we tried to fit the model with
the experimental EPSP recorded without any blockers. In each
model, using the result of the first stage of the fit, the synaptic
locations and NMDA conductance and kinetics were set, with the
only free parameter at this stage being peak AMPA conductance.
The peak AMPA conductance was constrained to be at least five
times larger than its peak conductance in the first stage (the
blocked case). Models were sorted according to their sum root
mean square distance, RMSD, with respect to the two target
experimental EPSPs. Different locations of the synapses and
other optimization methods were also attempted; eventually the
procedure described above resulted in a set of 100 models that
best fit the experimental EPSPs (see Figures 4, Figure S3, and
Table S2).
We selected one of the best five models resulting from the
above procedure for the rest of this work. Out of best five, we
chose the model with the parameters that were the closest to the
mean of the best 100 models (best typical). The corresponding
kinetics of the model for the NMDA conductance were: τrise =
8.02 ms, τdecay = 34.99 ms, γ
= 0.077 1
mV . The conductance
values per contact were as follows: gNMDA = 1.31 nS, gAMPA =
0.73 nS and gBlocled
AMPA
= 0.13 nS. The values of τrise, τdecay and
γ were within the range found in rodents (Sarid et al., 2007), and
used by many other studies (e.g., Rhodes, 2006). It is important
to note that all the best 30 models had γ values larger than 0.075
1
mV (0.078 ± 0.022 1
mV , mean ± SD, n = 30) implying a relatively
steep dependency of the NMDA-current on voltage as compared
to rodents (see below).
NMDA Spikes
In Figure 5 we modeled an NMDA spike that originated
from axo-spinous synapses distributed randomly along a 20 µm
stretch of a dendritic segment; the same modeled spine was used
in all cases see “Model for dendritic spines,” above. Synapses
were activated on the spine head membrane and the resultant
voltage was recorded in the spine head, the dendritic shaft and
the soma. In Figure 6 we computed the maximal number of
independent NMDA spikes (maximal number of independent
non-linear dendritic subunits) that could be generated by the
modeled cell. Synapses were located in the distal dendritic
terminals and the number of synapses in each terminal was the
minimal number required for generating a local NMDA spike,
defined as such when the local voltage is larger than −40 mV
and lasts for at least 20 ms. We found that this threshold is
a good criterion for distinguishing between a brief and strong
AMPA-based EPSPs and a prolonged NMDA+AMPA based
spikes (also known as plateau potentials). These NMDA spikes
usually reached maximal local depolarization that is close to the
reversal potential of NMDA current (0 mV in the present model).
NMDA spikes were defined as independent from each other if
the peak voltage in the branch-point connecting two activated
terminals was below −40 mV. The locations and the number of
the maximal clusters that generated independent NMDA spikes
were chosen both manually (adding clusters of spinous inputs in
the most distal locations in electrotonic terms) as well as with
recursive algorithms. At the end of these procedures we could
assess the maximal number of independent NMDA spike in any
given neuron model.
Fitting Trains of Somatic Na+ Spikes
The fit of the fully active axon-soma models was achieved
using the multiple objective optimization (MOO) method as in
Druckmann et al. (2007) and Hay et al. (2011). For obtaining a fit
between model and experimental spikes, as shown in Figure 7,
at least ten repetitions of identical depolarizing step current

injections leading to about 10 Hz firing rate were experimentally
recorded in the cells that were later 3D reconstructed and
modeled in detailed. I-F curves were also recorded for an
additional set of 25 HL2/L3 PCs (see above). The MOO
procedure is based on deconstructing the spike properties to a
set of features (see below) and using their experimental mean
and standard deviation (from all experimental traces) to find
the peak conductance of a set of predefined modeled excitable
ion channels that best fit the experimental spike firing. The
features for the MOO algorithm used in this study were: (1)
Voltage base—the mean membrane voltage before the stimulus.
(2) Steady state voltage—the mean voltage at the end of the
stimulus. (3) Mean frequency—mean firing rate. (4) Time to
first spike—the time in ms between the stimulus onset and
the peak of the first spike. (5) Burst Inter Spike Interval—the
length (in ms) of inter-spike interval (ISI) between the first two
spikes. (6) SI coefficient of variance—defined as ISImean/ISISD.
(7) Adaptation index—normalized average difference of two
consecutive ISIs. (8) AP height—average peak voltage of the
spikes. (9) AP begin voltage—the voltage at the beginning of
the spike, defined as the membrane voltage where dV/dt crosses
20 mV/ms. (10) After Hyper-Polarization Depth—the minimum
voltage between spikes. (11) After Hyper-Polarization time from
peak—the duration it takes to reach maximal hyperpolarization
following the peak of the spike. (12) Spike half width—the width
of the spike in its half height. (13) The mean firing rate of the
normalized I-F curve of 25 HL2/L3 PCs (see above), for an input
that is 75% compared with the input current with the mean
frequency in Feature #3 (Figure 7B). For example, 10 repetitions
of 700 pA to the soma of 0603_cell03 (blue morphology in
Figure 7, second column in Table S3), resulted in a 10.38 ±
0.31 Hz firing rate. The normalized input for the 25 cells that
lead to 10.38 Hz is 1.02 (where 1.0 is the input results with
10 Hz). Seventy-five percent of 1.02 is 0.765. The mean frequency
corresponding to 0.765 normalized input is 3.43 Hz ± 2.03,
therefore this value is feature #13 for this cell. 14–17. As in feature
#13, but for inputs of 125, 150, 200, and 300%, respectively. The
values (mean ± SD) for the different features of the six cells is
provided in Table S3. Features were extracted using the eFEL
library in python. Equations for the various features could be
found in https://github.com/BlueBrain/efel.
A short axon of 60 µm was added to the modeled cells, similar
to Hay et al. (2013) and Markram et al. (2015). The parameter set
for the optimization consisted of 29 free parameters: the maximal
conductance of nine ion channels, three kinetics parameters
for the sodium, two parameters for the intracellular Ca2+
concentration, all were fitted both for the soma (14 parameters)
and for the axon (14 parameters). The last parameter was the
reversal potential of the leak current (same value for all the
compartments in the model). The full list of parameters and their
values for the six models is provided in Table S4. Since we still lack
dendritic recordings from human cells, it might not be possible to
constrain dendritic parameters based only on somatic recordings
(Shen et al., 1999) and therefore we decided to include active
parameters only in the soma and in the axon.
Optimization of the spiking activity for HL2/L3 PCs was
achieved using MOO combined with an evolutionary algorithm
under the Optimization-Framework of the Blue Brain Project
(Markram et al., 2015). The optimization algorithm is explained
in details in Druckmann et al. (2007) and Hay et al. (2011).
Briefly the evolutionary process starts with 1,000 random models
(random set of parameters). In each generation, only the models
that are the most successful are selected to pass over to the
next generation (see below). In each generation, new models
are generated using mutations from the successful models
of the previous generation. The proximity of the models to
the objectives (target features) is defined by the distance, in
standard deviations, between the model feature and its respective
experimental feature. Models are defined as successful if they are
not dominated by any other models. i.e., there is no single model
that is more successful in all the objectives. The optimization
stopped after 500 generations and, for the purposes of this work,
we took one model that survived through the last generation and
had a small distance in all the objectives.
Number of Activated Dendritic Spines Synapses Per
Somatic Spike
Synapses with both AMPA- and NMDA-based conductances,
as in Figure 4, were randomly distributed over dendritic spines
(Figure 8C). The spatial distribution of synapses was either
random or clustered-random. In the first case, the location of
each synapse was chosen from a uniform distribution in the
modeled dendritic tree. In the second case, the locations of a
group of spatially clustered synapses was uniformly distributed
over the dendritic tree; each cluster included 20 synapses located
in the same dendritic branch all located within 20 µm from
each other. The synapses were activated synchronously and the
simulated somatic voltage was recorded. A somatic Na+ spike
was marked as such when the somatic voltage crossed a voltage
threshold of 0 mV. Each experiment (different total number of
synapses/clusters in each model) was repeated 1,000 times with
different seeds. To estimate the number of synapses required
to generate a somatic/axonal Na+ spike in 50% of the cases
(Figure 8B), a linear extrapolation was used for the clustered
case.
Rat L2/3 PC Models
For the comparison between the new models of human L2/L3
neurons and existing models of rodents we used four models
of L2/3 pyramidal cells from the rat neocortex. Three cells
were obtained from the barrel cortex (Sarid et al., 2013,
models 110602A, model 130602A, and 280503A), and one
model from the somatosensory cortex (Markram et al., 2015,
model L23_PC_cADpyr229_5). All three models from Sarid
et al. (2013) were used to compute the EPSPs voltage from
spine activations (spine neck resistance was assumed to be 100
M� (Cartailler et al., 2018). Models 110602A, 280503A, and
L23_PC_cADpyr229_5 were used in the simulation of number
of independent NMDA spikes that could be generated in a rat
pyramidal neuron. Model L23_PC_cADpyr229_5 was used for
the estimation of the number of excitatory synapses that were
required to generate somatic Na+ spike in a rat L2/3 PC.

Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
RESULTS
Synaptic Connections Between
HL2/L3-HL2/L3 PCs Are Proximal and
Powerful
We studied the properties of synaptic connections between
human L2/L3 PCs using the shape index curve (EPSP half width
vs. its rise time) as proposed by Rall (Rall, 1967; Rall et al.,
1967, see section Materials and Methods). We used the time-
course and magnitude of somatic EPSPs recorded experimentally
from ten synaptically-connected pairs of HL2/L3 PCs (Testa-
Silva et al., 2014, and Figure 1A), combined with a detailed model
of a HL2/L3 PC (Figure 1C). The shape index values for these
10 experimental EPSPs are shown by black dots in Figure 1B.
The modeled synapses shape indices are shown as colored circles
(apical synapses) and colored diamonds (basal synapses) in
Figure 1B; colors denote the physical distance of the synapse
from the soma. Comparing the experimental and the theoretical
results shows that the former has a relatively brief rise time and
a narrow half-width. A magnification of the initial part of the
theoretical shape index curve is depicted in Figure 1B Bottom.
This result clearly indicates that the experimentally recorded
EPSPs originated from relatively proximal synaptic contacts.
Based on the theoretical shape index curve we found the
putative dendritic location of the synapses that give rise to each
of the experimental EPSP. This location was computed so that
the theoretical shape index of the putative synapses falls within
a radius of 1 ms from the respective experimental shape index
(large colored circles in Figure 1B). The locations of putative
synapses for four cases are indicated by the corresponding
colored dots superimposed on the dendrites of the modeled
HL2/L3 PC shown in Figure 1C. For example, the experimental
EPSP in Figure 1D top trace, with its rightmost shape index in
Figure 1B (black dot surrounded by the red circle), may arise
from any of the synapses whose shape index falls within the
red circle. Our computations show that these putative synapses
could be located on two basal dendrites and two proximal oblique
dendrites, as illustrated by the red dots superimposed on the
modeled cell (Figure 1C, top). Other three experimental EPSPs
and their putative synapses (with respective colors) are also

putative dendritic synapses, was obtained via fitting the theoretical to the experimental transients (see text and Table S1). The recordings in (A) were taken from a pair
of cells that were not reconstructed, and the HL2/L3 morphologies are shown here only for the illustration of the method (see Figures S1, S2).

Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
depicted in Figure 1. Overall, our computations suggest that
L2/L3-L2/L3 synaptic connections are within a distance of 140
± 78 µm from the soma.
Next, in order to estimate the magnitude and kinetics of these
HL2/L3–HL2/L3 synapses (see section Materials and Methods,
Equations 2–5), we have used the modeled cell in Figure 1 to
fit the full waveform of the experimental EPSPs (four EPSPs
are shown in Figure 1D, black traces). The putative synapses
at the respective locations for each experimental EPSP were
activated, and the synaptic conductance was optimized (see
section Materials and Methods) such that the model EPSPs (color
traces in Figure 1D) would best match the experimental EPSPs.
The range of synaptic conductances and kinetics values that
fit the HL2/L3–HL2/L3 excitatory connections is provided in
Table S1. Assuming five contacts per connection (see section
Materials and Methods), the average peak synaptic conductance
of HL2/L3–HL2/L3 connection was 0.88 ± 0.70 nS, with rise
time of 0.3 ms and decay time of 1.8 ms. We note that this value
characterizes mostly the properties of AMPA-based conductance,
as the neuron was recorded at hyperpolarized value (−86 mV)
and, thus, for a single connection the NMDA receptors were
essentially not activated (see below).
Together, these findings indicate that adjacent human L2/L3
pyramidal cells form synapses with each other predominantly on
the proximal basal and oblique dendrites, similar to what was
found in the somatosensory cortex of rodents L2/3 pyramidal
cells (Sarid et al., 2007, 2013). This finding was further confirmed
anatomically in Figure S2. Another prediction is that the AMPA-
based conductance/contact is rather strong in these cells (0.88 ±
0.70 nS) as compared to 0.3–0.5 nS in rodents (Sarid et al., 2013;
Markram et al., 2015). Clearly, if more contacts are involved per
connection, then this conductance value is overestimated. We
will need more detailed reconstructions of connected cell pairs
to resolve this uncertainty (See section Discussion).
Human Dendritic Spines With Synapses
To obtain a realistic model of a human dendritic spine, we used
high-resolution confocal images of 150 spines from HL3 PCs’
dendrites in control post-mortem tissue from human temporal
cortex obtained in autopsy (Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013,
Figure 2, and see section Materials and Methods). Spines had
head membrane area of 2.88 ± 1.37 µm2, neck length of 1.34 ±
0.50 µm and spine neck diameter of 0.24 ± 0.08 µm (n = 150),
Figure S3. Note that these dendritic spines are much larger
than dendritic spines in rodents’ cortical neurons (Benavides-
Piccione et al., 2002). From the confocal images, we constructed
a prototypical spine model with an average head membrane area
of 2.8 µm2, spine neck diameter of 0.25 µm, spine neck length of
1.35 µm (Figure 2G), and a spine neck resistance of 50–80 M�,
assuming a specific axial resistance in the spine neck of 200–300
�-cm. This range of spine neck resistance is in the lower range
found in the literature (Svoboda et al., 1996; Tønnesen et al.,
2014), see Figure S4A and section Discussion.
The expected effect of excitatory synapses impinging on a
human dendritic spine was studied by the activation of an axo-
spinous synapse (Figure 3A), with synaptic properties as found
in Figure 1, and observing the resultant EPSP in the spine
head, spine base and the soma. One such example is shown in
Figure 3B. We repeated this simulation many times (n = 6,228),
by connecting a spine model to each electrical compartment
in each of the six modeled human L2/L3 PCs (see cells in
Figure 7 and also in Eyal et al., 2016), and then activated a
synapse individually at each spine head. The peak EPSP values
for all the spines in one of these HL2/L3 models are shown in
Figures 3C,D. Activation of a single spinous synapse gave rise
to peak EPSP of 12.7 ± 4.6 mV in the spine head membrane,
which was attenuated to 9.7 ± 5.0 mV at the spine base and
to 0.3 ± 0.1 mV at the soma. Considering each dendritic spine
individually, these values represent an attenuation ratio of 1.61
± 0.93 from the spine head to spine base and 122 ± 196-folds
(range of 6- to 1,812-folds) attenuation from the spine head to
the soma. This steep attenuation from the spine to the soma is the
result of the extended cable structure of human L2/L3 neurons,
see (Mohan et al., 2015; Deitcher et al., 2017). Importantly, the
small Cm values of ∼ 0.5 µF/cm2, as we have recently found in
human neurons, partially compensated for the otherwise even
stronger attenuation. Namely, with Cm of 1 µF/cm2, a much
steeper voltage attenuation is expected (Figure 3A in Eyal et al.,
2016).
We summarize this section by noting that, locally at the spine
head, a depolarization of ∼13 mV is expected from an individual
excitatory synapse which, on its own, will only minimally
activate NMDA-dependent receptors at the spine head. This local
depolarization is larger than what we computed for L2/3 rat
pyramidal cells (9.9 ± 7.5 mV, n = 3 cells, 2640 spines, spine
neck resistance of 100 M�, models are from Sarid et al., 2013,
see section Materials and Methods), due to the large synaptic
conductance in HL2/L3 PCs. However, because of the strong
voltage attenuation in human L2/L3 PCs dendrites, the somatic
EPSP (from activation of individual spine) in HL2/L3 PCs is
similar to rat L2/3 PCs (0.3 ± 0.1 and 0.3 ± 0.2 mV, respectively).
Large NMDA Currents Involved in
Composite EPSPs; Implications for
Branch-Specific NMDA Spikes
NMDA-mediated current was shown to be critical for memory
consolidation (Shimizu et al., 2000) as well as for computations at
the single neuron level, e.g. for shaping the orientation selectivity
in the visual cortex (Smith et al., 2013) and for angular tuning in
the barrel cortex (Lavzin et al., 2012). These computations were
based on the non-linear properties of the NMDA channel. What
are the properties of the NMDA channels in human neurons? Are
human L2/L3 PCs likely to generate local dendritic NMDA spikes
similar to those found in rodents?
To experimentally characterize NMDA receptor-mediated
currents in HL2/L3 PCs, an extracellular electrode was used
for stimulating proximal sites to the apical tree of HL2/L3
PCs while recording the postsynaptic responses from the
soma (Figure 4A, and section Materials and Methods). The
extracellular stimulus gave rise to large composite somatic
EPSPs (5.2 ± 1.3 mV, in 3 cells, 6 different stimulation loci). A
prominent NMDA-receptor mediated component was isolated
after blocking AMPA-, kainate- and GABAA-receptors (see

also Wuarin et al., 1992); three examples from three different
HL2/L3 PCs are shown in Figure 4A. This data was used to
run an exhaustive parameter search, allowing changes in the
number of activated synapses and in the dendritic locations of
the modeled spinous synapses in search for the AMPA- and
NMDA-conductances and kinetics that best fit the experimentally
recorded composite EPSP (Figure 4A, see section Materials and
Methods, Equations (2–6) for NMDA conductance). The range
of parameters for the 100 best models is summarized in Table
S2 and Figure S5. The best typical fit among all these acceptable
models for this experimental EPSP is depicted in Figure 4C
(red curves). The corresponding loci of the twenty-one model
spinous synapses that provide this fit are shown by the red
points superimposed on the dendrite in Figure 4B, whereas
the parameters for the corresponding AMPA- and NMDA-
conductances for this fit are given in Table S2. Note the large
NMDA conductance amplitude predicted per synapse (1.31 nS)
and the large value of γ (γ = 0.077 1/mV compared with 0.062 in
Jahr and Stevens (1990), see Equation 6). Large γ values indicate
a steep dependence of the NMDA conductance on voltage
(Figure S5B). Such large NMDA conductance and steepness of
the voltage-dependency were also found for most of the other
acceptable fits for that experimental EPSP (Table S2). We note
that, in the experiments, the extracellular stimulation might have
activated also inhibitory inputs (only in the unblocked case,
as gabazine was added to the medium in the blocked case,
see section Materials and Methods). that were not modeled
here. This neglect of possible inhibitory inputs underlying the
experimental composite EPSPs is expected to result in a small
underestimation of the modeled AMPA-conductance. This may
explain the small difference in our AMPA conductance estimates
between the models based on Figures 4 and Figure S5, and the
models based on Figure 1 (0.63 ± 0.13 vs. 0.88 ± 0.70 nS,
respectively). We note that, the same model parameters for the
AMPA- and NMDA-conductances that were extracted for the
results shown in Figure 4C, were also successful in fitting the
other five extracellularly-generated experimental EPSPs (Figure
S6).
What are the implications of such large NMDA-conductance
and steep voltage-dependency of the NMDA conductance? We
explored this question by inserting for AMPA- and NMDA-
based synapses, with the parameters found in Figure 4C, into the
head membrane of individually modeled dendritic spines as in
Figure 3. Activation of a single axo-spinous synapse with both
AMPA- and NMDA-conductances gave rise to an EPSP that was
generated almost entirely by AMPA current, as the depolarization
at the spine head was too small to significantly activate the
NMDA-based conductance (see above and Figures S4B,C).

accepted models in Figure S5; note the steep non-linearity of the voltage-dependency of the NMDA-current in most of the models (Figure S5B).
Increasing the number of simultaneously activated spiny
synapses on a stretch of 20 µm of a basal dendrite (Figure 5A)
generated an increasingly larger local dendritic EPSP which,
for <10 synapses, its main source was still the AMPA
current (Figures 5B,E). Further increase in the number of
activated spines generated supralinear voltage responses due
to increasingly stronger recruitment of NMDA-dependent
current. Eventually a powerful and prolonged NMDA spike was
generated at the dendritic branch (Figure 5B), as shown by the
corresponding supralinear somatic EPSPs (Figures 5D,E).
Defining an NMDA spike as a local dendritic event with a
voltage of at least −40 mV lasting for at least 20 ms, our six
model neurons predicted that about 19.9 ± 10.2 simultaneously
activated axo-spinous synapses, clustered over 20 µm dendritic
stretches, will generate an NMDA spike (n = 5,152). This
number decreases to 14.1 ± 7.9 when considering only dendritic
terminals (n = 489). These NMDA spikes are spatially restricted
(Figure 5F), much due to the unique properties of human basal
dendrites which are both highly branched and, importantly,
terminate with a particularly electrically elongated branch
(unparalleled in L2/3 pyramidal cells of mouse and rats; Mohan
et al., 2015; Deitcher et al., 2017). The emergence of local NMDA
dendritic spikes was demonstrated in several experimental and
theoretical studies in rodent pyramidal neurons (Schiller et al.,
2000; Major et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2014;
Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2017). Interestingly, although human
L2/L3 pyramidal neuron dendrites, especially the basal terminals,
are electrotonically more extended than those in rodents (Mohan
et al., 2015; Deitcher et al., 2017), a similar number of NMDA-
based synapses were required to generate a local NMDA spike.
This results from a combination of the relatively large NMDA-
conductance in HL2/L3, its steep voltage-dependency, and the
low Cm value in these cells which promotes local excitability/non-
linearity (Eyal et al., 2016), see section Discussion.

number (44) and the distinctive elongation of the basal terminals in this cell.
Multiple NMDA-Based Non-linear
Functional Subunits in Human L2/L3
Pyramidal Cells
The larger the number of non-linear dendritic subunits, the larger
the storage capacity of a neuron (Poirazi and Mel, 2001). Given
the spatial restriction of the NMDA spikes in HL2/L3 pyramidal
cells and the large number of dendritic branches/terminals
in these cells, we seek to quantify the potential number
of independent NMDA-spikes (functional dendritic subunit)
in these cells. The definition for an independent NMDA
spike/independent functional dendritic subunit is provided in the
section Materials and Methods.
We started by using Rall’s cable theory to analyze the degree to
which distal basal trees in HL2/L3 PCs are electrically decoupled
from each other. In electrically decoupled dendrites, local non-
linear events are likely to be independent (affect each other
minimally). Figure 6A shows the remarkable electrical isolation
of the distal basal dendrites in these cells (blue zone), as captured
by Ri,j, the transfer resistance from branch i to branch j. The
smaller Ri,j is, the larger the voltage attenuation from i to j and the
larger the electrical decoupling between these two locations. The
functional consequence of this significant electrical decoupling
between distal basal dendrites is manifested in the capability of
these dendrites to generate many independent NMDA spikes
simultaneously (Figures 6B,C). A comprehensive search for the
space of possible independent simultaneously activated NMDA
spikes in HL2/L3 PCs models provided an estimate of 24.8
± 4.4 (n = 6) independent NMDA spikes per cell (Figure
S7) as compared with only 13.7 ± 2.1 (n = 3) in rat L2/3
pyramidal cell models (Figure S8). This increased number of
local non-linear dendritic subunits in HL2/L3 PCs enhances the
memory/computational capacity and capability of these cells (see
section Discussion).
Active Axo-Somatic Models of Human
L2/L3 PCs
Next, we focused on constructing models for the somatic spiking
properties of HL2/L3 PCs. Toward this end, repeated supra-
threshold depolarizing current steps were recorded from the
six HL2/L3 PCs described above (example traces are shown in
Figure 7A, black traces). This data was complemented with I-
F curves recorded in 25 other human L2/L3 PCs (gray traces
in Figure 7B; the average I-F curve for human L2/L3 PC is
shown in black). From these experimental spikes, we extracted
a set of characteristic features (spike width, height, frequency,
adaptation index etc., see Table S3), and employed multiple
objective optimization to fit these experimental features via
conductance-based neuron models (Druckmann et al., 2007; Hay
et al., 2011). This procedure yielded a good fit between models
and experiments (Figure 7, color traces). The values for the
membrane ion channels involved in generating these six HL2/L3
models are provided in Table S4. These modeled cells are available
for download in modelDB (http://modeldb.yale.edu/238347).
Relatively Small Number of Human
L2/L3–L2/L3 Synapses Ignite Somatic Na+
Spike
Now that we have a faithful model for the spiking activity
(and for the spike threshold) in HL2/L3 PCs, we may ask how
many excitatory axo-spinous synapses should be simultaneously
activated for initiating a somatic Na+ spike in these cells? Two
cases were tested: in the first case, the excitatory (AMPA- and
NMDA- based) synapses were randomly distributed over the

were sufficient to generate local NMDA spikes were activated simultaneously at t = 0 ms and the membrane voltage (color coded) as a function of time is
superimposed on the simulated dendritic tree. (C) When activating the entire dendritic tree with clustered synaptic inputs, 28 independent NMDA spikes could be

modeled HL2/L3 dendrites (Figure 8A, green curve for one of the
modeled cells and green column in Figure 8B for the six modeled
cells). In the second case the synapses were clustered such that
local dendritic NMDA spikes were likely to occur (pink curve in
Figure 8A and pink column in Figure 8B).
In both cases, a similar number of excitatory synapses were
required for generating a somatic spike with 50% probability,
133 ± 16 (n = 6) synapses in the distributed case and 136 ±
38 in the clustered case. However, the clustered case is shallower,
implying that in some instances fewer synapses were sufficient
for generating a somatic spike (left part of the pink curve in
Figure 8A) and in some cases more synapses were required
to generate a somatic spike (right part of the pink curve in
Figure 8A, see also Farinella et al., 2014). In the former cases,
the clustered inputs (with their corresponding prominent NMDA
current) were located at proximal branches and in the latter case
they were clustered either at distal branches (as in Figures 6B,C
and see also examples in Figure S9A) or in branches with small
input resistance, such that the threshold for NMDA spike was not
reached. In other cases, two or more clusters were located on the
same branch leading to saturation of the local membrane voltage
(Figure S9A). Specific examples for suprathreshold clustered vs.
distributed inputs are shown in Figure 8C. Note that clustered
input has a larger probability of generating a burst of somatic
spikes due to the prolonged duration of the dendritic NMDA
spikes.
It is interesting to note that the number of excitatory synapses
that were necessary for generating a somatic spike in human
L2/L3 PCs is not significantly larger than what we predicted for
the electrically more compact L2/3 PCs of the rat; ∼125 synapses
for the distributed case and ∼145 synapses for the clustered
case in a modeled cell from Markram et al. (2015); see Figure
S9B. This is explained by the more potent excitatory synapses
(larger AMPA and NMDA-based conductances) in human L2/L3

pyramidal neurons compared to rodents (Sarid et al., 2013) and
the smaller Cm value in human L2/L3 PCs (Eyal et al., 2016).
Therefore, a relatively small number of simultaneously activated
excitatory synapses are sufficient for reaching threshold for spike
firing at the soma/axon of human L2/L3 PCs. Importantly,
the estimated number of dendritic spines per neuron, when
considering only the basal trees of HL2/L3 pyramidal cells in
the prefrontal and temporal human cortices, is 15,138 and
12,700, respectively (Elston et al., 2001); these numbers agree
with measurements of spine density (Benavides-Piccione et al.,
2013) and with our measurements of total dendritic length of 3D
reconstructed human L2/L3 PCs (Mohan et al., 2015). Based on
the above, we estimate that the total number of dendritic spines
in HL2/L3 PCs ranges between 20,000 and 30,000. With only

about 135 simultaneously activated excitatory synapses required
to fire an axonal spike, the number of combinatorial synaptic
possibilities for generating axonal output in HL2/L3 PCs is
enormous.
We summarize the above two sections by highlighting that
our realistic models of the somatic spiking activity in human
cortical L2/L3 neurons, together with the biologically-based
model estimate of the strength of excitatory (AMPA + NMDA-
based) synapses in these cells, enabled us to demonstrate that (i)
around 20 clustered axo-spinous synapses are likely to generate
a local dendritic NMDA spike and (ii) that a somatic Na+ spike
is likely to be generated at the soma/axon region when a rather
small number of these synapses are activated simultaneously.
These findings are surprising as human L2/L3 neurons are much
larger (in both the total dendritic length/surface area and in
the number of dendritic branches) than the respective cells in
rodents. Still, due to various compensatory mechanism [small
Cm value and large Rm value (Eyal et al., 2016) and more potent
excitatory synapses], similar numbers of excitatory synapses
ignite both the local NMDA spike and the somatic spike in L2/L3
pyramidal neurons of humans and rodents. This issue will be
further elaborated in the section Discussion.
DISCUSSION
The structure and function of local neuronal circuits, with their
specific cell types and highly selective connectivity pattern, are
presently in the focus of worldwide efforts (Egger et al., 2014;
Kasthuri et al., 2015; Markram et al., 2015; Hawrylycz et al., 2016;
Lein et al., 2017). In the midst of this effort star single neurons,
the elementary processing units in the brain, that, due to their
complex morphological and membrane non-linearities, function
as sophisticated computational and plastic units (Rall, 1959;
review in Stuart et al., 2016). Of particular interest are cortical
pyramidal cells; these principal neurons represent the majority of
neurons composing the mammalian cortex, they are the major
source of excitatory cortical synapses and their dendritic spines
are the main postsynaptic target of excitatory synapses (DeFelipe
and Fariñas, 1992). Pyramidal cell dendrites exhibit highly non-
linear properties, including local NMDA spikes in distal dendritic
branches and more global Ca2+ spikes in the apical tuft. These
dendritic non-linearities impact both local plastic processes and
shape the spiking output at the axon and, consequently the
dynamics of cortical networks (Larkum et al., 1999, 2009; Poirazi
et al., 2003a; Spruston, 2008; Major et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013;

 Eyal et al.
Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
Hay and Segev, 2014; Bono et al., 2017; Mel et al., 2017). All these
studies, focusing on the computational consequences of dendritic
complexities, were performed on rodents (mouse and rat). What
could be learned from those on human neurons remained an
open question, because we lacked similar systematic studies on
cortical pyramidal cells (or on any other neuron type) in the
human neocortex.
The present study attempted to narrow this gap by linking
experimental data from human cortical pyramidal cells with
detailed models of these same cells. Toward this end we
integrated in our detailed models a variety of properties of L2/L3
pyramidal cells from human temporal cortex, including dendritic
morphology and physiology, dendritic spine anatomy, synaptic
properties and somatic spiking characteristics. Our overarching
approach provided several new insights on integrative properties
of HL2/L3 PCs and on their computational capability.
Properties of Human L2/L3-L2/L3
Excitatory Synapses
Our HL2/L3 PCs models predicted larger conductance of both
AMPA- and NMDA-receptors as compared to rodents. This is
expected as the spine head area is larger in human neurons
(Benavides-Piccione et al., 2002; DeFelipe et al., 2002). In human
L2/L3 PCs, the average estimated AMPA conductance is ∼0.8
nS per contact (Figures 1, 4 and Tables S1, S2) as compared to
0.3–0.5 nS in rodents; the NMDA conductance is estimated to
be ∼1.3 nS per contact (Figure 4 and Table S2) as compared
to ∼0.4 nS in rodents (Sarid et al., 2007, 2013; Markram et al.,
2015). We note that all the above estimates are based on the
assumption that single axon connecting HL2/L3 neurons to
each other make, on average, 5 synaptic contacts, similar to
the case in rodents (Feldmeyer et al., 2002, 2006; Markram
et al., 2015). This estimate requires further study. Still, the total
conductance for a HL2/L3-HL2/L3 PCs connection is about
twice as strong, on average, than in the respective rodents’
synapse.
We used cable theory and Rall’s “shape indices” (Rall,
1967) to estimate the electrotonic locus of HL2/L3-HL2/L3
PCs synapses. The fast rise-time and the relatively narrow
half-width of the respective somatic EPSP indicated that these
connections are made at the proximal dendrites (Figure 1), as
indeed was further validated by the reconstruction of L2/L3-
L2/L3 putative excitatory synapses (Figure S2). Similar findings
hold for rodents as well, whereby connected pairs of L2/3
PCs (as well as of L5 PCs), make proximal synapses with
each other (Markram et al., 1997a; Sarid et al., 2013). We
note that our model predicts that the NMDA current is
essentially not activated by a single HL2/L3-HL2/L3 synapse
(Figure 5).
Dendritic NMDA Spikes in Human PCs
NMDA conductance is voltage-dependent; the steepness of
this dependency is determined mainly by the parameter γ
in Equation (6). Fitting the experimental data to the model
provided an estimate of γ ∼0.075 (Figure 4 and Figure S5),
which is larger (steeper voltage dependency) than in rodents
pyramidal cells (Jahr and Stevens, 1990), implying that human
L2/L3 PC dendrites are prone to generating a local dendritic
NMDA spike. Indeed, our model shows that, on average, about
20 ± 10 simultaneously activated excitatory spinous synapses,
stretched over 20 µm of dendritic branch, are likely to ignite
large and prolonged NMDA spikes (Figure 5). At distal dendritic
terminal branches, due to their large input resistance (up to
1G�), only 14 ± 8 synapses were required for generating an
NMDA spike. Similar numbers of excitatory synapses were
required for generating branch-specific NMDA spikes in models
of rodents’ dendrites (Rhodes, 2006; Larkum et al., 2009; Farinella
et al., 2014). We conclude that human L2/L3 PC’s dendrites
are prone to generating local NMDA spikes, both due to
the properties of the NMDA-conductance as well as due to
the low Cm and large Rm values in these cells (Eyal et al.,
2016).
Models of Human Dendritic Spines
This is the first study that models human dendritic spines.
Toward this end, we employed a large data set of high-resolution
confocal images and 3D reconstructions of dendritic spines from
HL2/L3 PCs (Figure 2 and Figure S3). From this data set we
constructed a prototypical human spine model to explore the
range of EPSP values of axo-spinous synapses (Figures 2, 3)
and to estimate the spine neck resistance. Activation of a single
axo-spinous synapse generated an EPSP with peak voltage of
12.7 ± 4.6 mV in the spine head membrane, 9.7 ± 5.0 mV at
the spine base and 0.3 ± 0.1 mV at the soma. These values
represent a mean attenuation ratio of ∼1.6 from the spine head
to spine base and ∼120-fold attenuation from the spine head
to the soma, which results from the extended cable structure of
human L2/L3 neurons (Mohan et al., 2015; Deitcher et al., 2017).
The small Cm values of ∼ 0.5 µm2 in human neurons and the
corresponding large Rm value in these cells (Eyal et al., 2016)
partially compensated for the otherwise even steeper dendritic
attenuation.
The above value of the single axo-spinous EPSP relies on our
estimates of the spine neck resistance which, due to the relatively
thick neck in human spines (∼ 0.25 µm), was estimated to range
between 50 and 80 M�. This estimate is based on the assumption
that the specific axial resistivity of the spine neck is 200–300 �cm,
as was the value for the dendrites in our models), see Discussion
in Eyal et al., 2016). It could be the case that, due to various
intracellular filaments/organelles in the spine neck, the effective
axial resistance is larger than assumed here. Small variations in
the spine neck diameter (e.g., ± 0.05 µm) or in the axial resistivity
(e.g., ±100 �cm) would lead to spine neck resistance ranging
between 19 and 128 M� (Figure S4A).
Recent studies used a variety of methods to directly estimate
the spine neck resistance in rodents. These estimates vary
significantly between different groups, from around 50 M�
(Svoboda et al., 1996; Tønnesen et al., 2014; Popovic et al., 2015)
to 0.5–3 G� (Palmer and Stuart, 2009; Harnett et al., 2012;
Araya et al., 2014). Note a recent study by Kwon et al. (2017),
with estimates of 101 ± 95 M� for the spine neck resistance
in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice, using a voltage
indicator and glutamate uncaging method.

Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
Models for Somatic/Axonal Na+ Spikes in
Human L2/L3 PCs
We used a large dataset of ∼900 spikes recorded from six HL2/L3
PCs to model the axonal/somatic Na+ spiking activity in these
cells (Figure 7). Toward this end we used our multiple objective
optimization method (Druckmann et al., 2007; Hay et al., 2011)
to estimate the conductance of a set of membrane ion channels,
assuming that the kinetics of these ion channels are similar to
that of rodents (Ranjan et al., 2011). Our models predicted that
the Na+–channel density in the axon of HL2/L3 PCs is relatively
high (4.9 ± 1.0 S/cm2, n = 6, see review in Kole and Stuart,
2012). This value results from the need to fit the large peak of
the Na+ spikes in these neurons (38.6 ± 3.2 mV, from a voltage
base of −83.5 ± 2.9 mV) and to compensate for the large current
sink imposed on the axon initial segment by the (huge) dendritic
tree in human L2/L3 neurons. Similar densities were estimated
recently also for L2/3 and L5 PCs in the rat (Markram et al., 2015).
The high densities of the sodium channels go along with large
densities of Kv3.1 ion channels (1.9 ± 0.1 S/cm2), resetting the
strong inward sodium currents and yielding the narrow spikes
measured in these cells (half-width of 1.02 ± 0.15 ms). On the
other hand, the densities of the persistent potassium channels
were low both for the axon (0.019 ± 0.039 S/cm2) and for the
soma (0.0002 ± 0.0004 S/cm2), allowing the models to reach high
firing rates of 20–30 Hz for strong current inputs (Figure 7B).
High densities for sodium channels were required for the somatic
compartment as well (0.33 ± 0.17 S/cm2). Note also that, in
rodent PCs, the dendritic membrane is endowed with low density
of sodium channels, effectively decreasing the current sink due
to the dendrites and supporting the back-propagating action
potential (Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; Stuart et al., 2016). We still
lack recordings from human PCs’ dendrites and, consequently,
do not know if and to what extent HL2L/3 PCs support back-
propagating APs. Yet, at least for the spiking activity recorded at
the soma, our models seem rather faithful (Figure 7).
From Axo-Spinous Synapses to Dendritic
and Axonal Spikes
Our comprehensive HL2/L3 PCs models, integrating both
dendritic morphology, synaptic properties, spine properties and
somatic active ion channels, provided an estimate for the number
of simultaneously activated HL2/L3–HL2/L3 synapses required
to generate a somatic Na+ spike (Figure 8). We found that about
135 synapses are required to fire a somatic/axonal spike with a
probability of 50%, both for a spatially distributed case as well
as for a case in which the excitatory synapses were clustered
(Figure 8). We note that, although similar number of synapses
are required to generate a somatic/axonal spike in both cases,
the span of the curves is significantly different. In the distributed
case, the probability for generating a spike is a steep function
of the number of synapses. Indeed, for the model shown in
Figure 8A, the probability to generate a spike with <110 synapses
is very low whereas with 140 a spike will always be generated.
In contrast, the clustered case is more elongated and it has a
larger variance. For example, in some cases as few as 80 synapses
(four clusters with 20 synapses each) were sufficient to generate
a spike, and in other cases as much as 200 synapses were not
enough (Figure 8 and Figure S9). These clustered inputs enable
the cell to have a larger dynamic range for both I/O relationship
as for NMDA-dependent calcium-based plasticity, see discussion
below.
Interestingly, the number of excitatory synapses required to
generate a somatic spike was similar for the HL2/L3 PC models
as for the rodent L2/3 PC model (Figure S9), even though the
human L2/L3 PCs are much larger (both anatomically and
electrotonically (Mohan et al., 2015). Similarly, about the same
number of clustered dendritic synapses are required to generate
an NMDA spike in both human and rodent neurons. This is
explained by two compensatory mechanisms in HL2/L3 PCs.
The reduced Cm value and increased Rm value (Eyal et al.,
2016) enable the cells to charge the membrane more effectively.
Furthermore, the large AMPA- and NMDA- conductances in
these cells also compensate for the increased size of HL2/L3 cells.
Therefore, the synapses-to-spike ratio is preserved in both rodent
and human L2/L3 PCs. The somatic spike “requires” around 135
excitatory synapses (or ∼ 27 excitatory connections) and the local
NMDA spike about 20 excitatory synapses. These values assume
that the cell is in vitro resting state. In the in-vivo case, neurons
are shunted by the activation of hundreds of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic inputs. Therefore, the number of excitatory
synapses required to generate a somatic AP or a dendritic NMDA
spike critically depends on the state of the neurons (e.g., the “high
conductance state”— (Destexhe et al., 2003) and see (Farinella
et al., 2014; Doron et al., 2017).
Yet, due to the large number of HL2/L3 terminal basal
branches (44.5 ± 8.1, n=6) and their particular cable elongation,
HL2/L3 PCs are functionally distinctive as compared to rodent
L2/3 PCs (where the number of basal terminals is 31.4
± 8.6, n = 15, see (Mohan et al., 2015; Deitcher et al.,
2017). These two distinctive features in HL2/L3 PCs result in
significant electrical decoupling of the basal terminals from
each other (Figure 6), enabling HL2/L3 PC dendrites to function
as multiple, semi-independent (non-linear), subunits. Indeed,
our models predicted that HL2/L3 PCs could generate ∼25
simultaneous and independent local NMDA spikes, particularly
at the basal dendrites, vs. a total of 14 independent NMDA spikes
in rat PCs.
Assumptions and Missing Data
It is important to note that despite the growing interest in
human cortex, there are still a small number of biophysical
and anatomical studies on human neuronal cells (see however a
recent release by the Allen Institute, http://celltypes.brain-map.
org/). Consequently, our study is based on several assumptions.
Particularly, our estimates for the synaptic parameters (Tables
S1, S2) are based on the assumption that HL2/L3–HL2/L3 PCs
connections are formed by five synaptic contacts per connection.
Multiple contacts per connection is typical for cortical excitatory
(as well as inhibitory) synapses (e.g., Markram et al., 1997b;
Sarid et al., 2007, 2013) and it seems that this holds also in
human PCs as shown in Figure S2. It is important to emphasize
that our conclusions that synaptic connection is stronger in
human L2/L3-L2/L3 PCs vs. that of rodents holds independently

 Eyal et al.
Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
on the assumed number of contacts/connection. For example,
in Figure 1 we computed the average HL2/L3 PC synaptic
conductance per contact (assuming 5-contacts/connection).
The total synaptic conductance per synaptic connection is a
multiplication of this value by the number of synaptic contacts
assumed: namely 5∗ 0.88 nS = ∼4.5 nS compared to a the
total conductance/connection of ∼2 nS in the rat (Sarid et al.,
2007, 2013). These values hold also for the case of smaller/larger
number of contacts per connection (up to small variations due
to the effect of the reversal potential/saturation of the synaptic
current). In Figure 8, we found that similar number of excitatory
contacts is required to generate AP in human L2/L3 and rat L2/3
PCs. This is also valid when considering the number of synaptic
connections that underlies AP generation (135 contacts/5 ∼27
connections); this number is independent from the assumption
of number of contacts per synaptic connection.
Nevertheless, this is in important value that requires further
study. Interestingly a recent paper (Molnár et al., 2016)
showed that the number of light microscopically detected
synaptic contacts between human pyramidal neurons and human
inhibitory neurons is ∼3 per connection, similar to what was
found in rats. However, in human neurons, each one of the
presynaptic active zones contained about 6 functional release
sites comparing with only about 1.5 in rats. This agrees with our
prediction of stronger synapses per contact in human excitatory
synaptic contacts. Yet, a study similar to Molnár et al. (2016) for
human PCs-PCs is required for assessing the number of synaptic
contacts per connection.
In addition, the estimates in Figure 8 for the number of
synapses required to generate a dendritic NMDA spike and
a somatic Na+ spike is based on the assumption that all the
excitatory inputs to the HL2/L3 PCs have similar properties to
those activated by an input from a proximal HL2/L3 neuron as
in Figure 1, and to those activated by an extra cellular electrode
located near the apical tree as in Figure 4. Variations in the
synaptic properties as function of the location of the synapse on
the dendritic tree (Magee and Cook, 2000) and as function of
the source of the input (Sarid et al., 2007, 2013) were found in
mammals and are probably expected also in the human brain.
A more complete database, studying the synaptic properties
of different connections in the human neocortex, including
inhibitory connections, is therefore required in order to improve
the validity of our predictions.
Another missing experimental component is the properties
of ion channels at the soma/axon region in human neurons.
We have successfully used models of ion channels from rodents
[see recent intense effort to build such models for rodents’
cortical neurons based on ion channel characterization—the
Channelpedia (http://channelpedia.epfl.ch/), Ranjan et al., 2011].
Yet, we are aware of the fact that membrane ion channels
may differ between species (Angelino and Brenner, 2007),
although a comprehensive study by Ranjan et al. (submitted)
highlights the great similarity between human and rodents ion
channels.
Finally, it is likely that HL2/L3 PCs’ dendrites are endowed
with an assortment of voltage-dependent ion channels. We
show that the dendrites of these cells possess NMDA-receptors,
which are expected to be strongly activated when hundreds
of excitatory synapses impinge over the dendritic tree. For
synchronous, spatially-clustered excitatory synapses, strong local
NMDA-spikes are likely to be generated in HL2/L3 PCs dendrites
(Figure 5). However, other excitable ion channels might decorate
HL2/L3 PCs’ dendrites; giving rise to e.g., back propagating
dendritic Na+-spike or to local dendritic Ca2+-spikes (that
were not established yet experimentally in human neurons),
and may influence our estimations for both the number of
synapses per dendritic NMDA spike and per somatic Na+-spike.
Consequently, our present models for HL2/L3 PCs should be
regarded as the passive (+ NMDA-based) skeleton, upon which
further dendritic non-linearities will be incorporated when these
become available.
Functional Significance of the
Morpho-Electrical Complexity of Human
L2/L3 Dendrites
Following the above results, we hereby propose a new index
for defining the functional complexity of cortical neurons based
on the maximal number of independent-simultaneous NMDA
spikes that the neuron could generate (see also, Koch et al.,
1982; Mel, 1992; Poirazi and Mel, 2001; Polsky et al., 2004).
Note that, for this definition, we do not assume a priori that
different dendritic branches are functionally independent as in
(Poirazi and Mel, 2001, see Discussion in Poirazi et al., 2003b ;
Jadi et al., 2014). Rather, the number of subunits is determined
by the degree (or lack thereof) of interaction between the
dendritic branches. This is determined by the number of the
branches and the cable structure of the tree (Figure 6A). It is
important to note that our definition of the cell’s complexity
index provides a lower bound, as if the NMDA spikes were
not activated simultaneously, then the number of the non-linear
dendritic subunits would be much larger, in the order of the
total number of branches per cell. Indeed, our definition takes
the strictest constrain. Namely, that the NMDA-spike should not
interact with each other when activated simultaneously. Clearly,
the estimated number of independent NMDA spikes is also
determined by the “state” of the neuron; whether more shunted
via being bombarded by background active synapses as in the
in vivo case or more quiescent as in the in vitro case as we used.
Using the definition described above, we found that HL2/L3
PCs have ∼25 non-linear dendritic subunits, compared with
only ∼14 in the rat. This suggests that HL2/L3 PCs have
augmented computational capabilities compared with the rodent
L2/3 PCs. (Poirazi and Mel, 2001) provided a measure for
the storage capacity of neurons based on their structural and
non-linear dendritic properties. Upper bounds on the capacity
were derived for two cases: the case of a linear neuron, where
the cell activity is determined by a linear weighted sum of all
its inputs, similar to a one-layer neural network (McCulloch
and Pitts, 1943), and the case in which non-linear synaptic
integration was first implemented in a given dendritic subunit
and then summed-up to produce the axonal output (2 layer
model). They then computed the storage capacity of the neuron
for these two cases, see Equation 4 in Poirazi and Mel (2001).

 Eyal et al.
Comprehensive Models of Human Cortical Neurons
Using our definition for the number of independent non-linear
dendritic subunits and taking into account that human L2/L3
PCs have about 3-times more synapses per cell (Elston et al.,
2001; DeFelipe et al., 2002; Ballesteros-Yáñez et al., 2006) we
computed the storage capacity of HL2/L3 PCs to be 23.4∗104
bits compared with 6.3∗104 bits in respective cells of the rat
(Figure 9).
The analysis described above is based on the structural
plasticity of synapses. Namely on the number of ways to connect
presynaptic axons with the postsynaptic neuron. However, the
memory capacity of a neuron can also be studied for a given
connectivity. The neuron may learn to respond (or not respond)
to specific patterns by assigning different weights to its synapses
(Mel et al., 2017). The number of patterns that could be learned
by a neural network with E parameters (edges in the network) is
O(E∗log(E)) for networks with sign activated neurons and O(E2)
for networks with sigmoid output neurons (Shalev-Shwartz and
Ben-David, 2014). Consequently, having both more synaptic
inputs in HL2/L3 PCs (a larger input layer) and more non-
linear dendritic subunits (larger second layer) increases E and
thus dramatically increases the computational capacity of these
neurons.
Clearly, the input-output properties of neurons could only
be approximated by one- or two- layer networks (Poirazi et al.,
2003b). This is apparent by observing the large variance in
the number of clusters required to generate APs in Figure 8.
When clustered inputs are impinging in proximal dendrites,
the depolarization will effectively spread to other subunits (Jadi
et al., 2014). Furthermore, the present study assumed the extreme
cases where inputs were activated simultaneously and were either
clustered or uniformly distributed over the dendritic surface
(Figure 8). Obviously, clustered inputs interact with distributed
background activity and the temporal variance in the input has a
large impact on the neuron’s output (Farinella et al., 2014). To
replicate the I/O properties of the neuron under such realistic
conditions, a more complex perhaps “deep network” might be
required. This remains an interesting challenge for future studies.
Similarities and Differences Between
Human and Rodent L2/L3 PCs
This work is part of our recent efforts to study the biophysical
and anatomical properties of HL2/L3 PCs (Verhoog et al.,
2013; Testa-Silva et al., 2014; Mohan et al., 2015; Eyal et al.,
2016; Deitcher et al., 2017). Our previous studies illustrate that
human and rodent L2/L3 PCs are comparable to some extent
but primarily highlight important functional and structural
differences.
Human L2/L3 PCs are larger both morphologically and
electrotonically as compared to rodent L2/3 PCs (Benavides-
Piccione et al., 2002; Mohan et al., 2015). This electrotonic
difference is also valid for the transient case. Namely, EPSP
attenuation from spine to soma is larger in human vs. rodents
(Figure 2), albeit the smaller specific membrane capacitance in
human neurons which, to some extent (but not completely),
counterbalances the electrotonically long dendrites (Eyal et al.,
2016). Despite the differences in cable properties the membrane
time constant is similar in humans and rodents L2/L3 PCs
(∼16 ms in humans, ∼13 ms in rats, and 16 ms in mice, Sarid
et al., 2007; Eyal et al., 2016).
Our models also predicted that adjacent L2/L3 PC form
synaptic connections mostly on the basal and oblique dendrites,
similarly to what was found for rats (Sarid et al., 2007, 2013).
However, the synaptic conductance (both the NMDA and
AMPA-components), per synaptic contact and per synaptic
connection (assuming five contacts per connection in both
human and rats) is larger in human. The smaller specific
capacitance and the stronger synaptic conductances in human
L2/L3 PCs compensate for the extended cable length in human
and therefore the resultant somatic EPSP is similar in both
human and rodents. This explains why our computations predict
that the number of excitatory synapses required to generate
a somatic spike is similar for human and rodent’s L2/3 PCs
(Figure 8).
However, the above “somatocentric” view point is limited
and one should also consider the “dendrocentric” view point,
as local dendritic events are key for plastic processes and for
dendritic computations (Takahashi et al., 2016; Schmidt-Hieber
et al., 2017). Indeed, our model predicts that due to the larger
NMDA-conductance and steeper NMDA-voltage relationship
(Figure S5), the local dendritic NMDA spikes are more “non-
linear” in humans L2/L3 PCs. This, together with the longer and
larger number of basal dendritic terminals in human L2/L3 PCs
(Deitcher et al., 2017), endow human neurons with the ability
to support larger number of independent NMDA spikes, which
results in enhanced computational and memory capabilities to
HL2/L3 PCs (Figure 9). These enhanced capabilities go hand in
hand with our previous results that human neurons are capable
of tracking, via their axonal spikes, faster modulations in their
dendritic inputs and that HL2/L3-HL2/L3 synapses recover faster
from depression compared with that of the rat (Eyal et al., 2014;
Testa-Silva et al., 2014). Together, these results provide additional
compelling evidence that human L2/L3 cells are not just a “scaled
version” of rodents L2/3 PCs but rather that (together with
a set of compensatory mechanisms to enhance signal transfer
from dendrites to soma), human L2/L3 PCs and their dendrites
are indeed more powerful computational microprocessors than
the perspective neurons in rodents and, consequently, so is the
cortical circuits that these neurons form.
In summary, the present work is the most comprehensive,
experimentally-based, modeling study of any human neuron. To
fully model human neurons, more data than we presently have
is required (e.g., the properties of inhibitory and modulatory
inputs and of additional dendritic excitability, such as the back-
propagating AP and the dendritic Ca2+-spike). Still, the present
study significantly increases our acquaintance with human
pyramidal cells, laying the foundation for constructing models
for other (excitatory and inhibitory) neuron types in the human
brain, and paving the way for constructing models of human
cortical microcircuits and exploring its dynamical repertoire
in silico, as has been recently performed for rodents cortical
microcircuits (Egger et al., 2014; Markram et al., 2015). This will
bring us closer to understanding “what makes us human”—at
least at the scale of cortical microcircuits.

FIGURE 9 | Human L2/L3 pyramidal neurons have larger storage capacity compared to rat. (A) Storage capacity as a function of the number of synaptic inputs when
the neuron is considered as one-layer model. The inputs from all the synapses are summed directly at the cell body. The case of rodent L2/3 cell and HL2/L3 with
10,000 and 30,000 synapses is depicted, by black and red, respectively. (B) Storage capacity of the neuron when considered as a two-layer model; the capacity is

respectively. Top and bottom curves are for 30,000 and 10,000 synaptic inputs respectively. The average number of contacts per connection was assumed to be five
in both cases (d = s/5 for the parameters used in Poirazi and Mel (2001). Analysis of storage capacity is as in Poirazi and Mel (2001). Note that the capacity of human
L2/L3 is almost 4-folds that of the rodent.
