Abstract
Background: Mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) remains at quite notable levels. Research on the risk
factors and the treatment of CHD has focused on physiological factors, but there is an increasing amount of
evidence connecting mental health and personality traits to CHD, too. The data concerning the connection of CHD
and dispositional optimism and pessimism as personality traits is relatively scarce. The aim of this study was to
investigate the connection between optimism, pessimism, and CHD mortality.
Methods: This was an 11-year prospective cohort study on a regional sample of three cohorts, aged 52–56, 62–66,
and 72–76 years at baseline (N = 2815). The levels of dispositional optimism and pessimism of the study subjects
were determined at baseline using a revised version of the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Eleven years later, those
results and follow-up data about CHD as a cause of death were used to calculate odds. Adjustments were made for
cardiovascular disease risk.
Results: Those who died because of CHD were significantly more pessimistic at baseline than the others. This
finding applies to both men and women. Among the study subjects in the highest quartile of pessimism, the
adjusted risk of death caused by CHD was approximately 2.2-fold (OR 2.17, 95 % CI 1.21–3.89) compared to the
subjects in the lowest quartile. Optimism did not seem to have any connection with the risk of CHD-induced
mortality.
Conclusions: Pessimism seems to be a substantial risk factor for death from CHD. As an easily measured variable, it
might be a very useful tool together with the other known risk factors to determine the risk of CHD-induced
mortality.

Background
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is still the leading cause
of mortality, despite growing knowledge of its risk
factors and the new treatments available [1]. According
to the latest statistics, CHD causes about 200 deaths per
100,000 annually in industrialized countries (e.g. in 2013
193.3/100,000 in the United States and 193.6/100,000 in
Finland) [2, 3].
The majority of those with CHD have at least one of
the four most important physiological risk factors (dia-
betes, hypertension, smoking, or elevated lipids) [4].
Some CHD patients seem to have no recognizable
physiological risk factors and there are also many people
with one or more physiological risk factors and still no
CHD, which supports the influence of psychosocial fac-
tors in the pathogenesis of CHD.
The heart has always been described as a centre of
psychosocial health and emotions in the history of art
and culture. The scientific connection between psycho-
social health and the heart was studied for the first time
in 1937, when Benjamin Malzberg investigated the

 connection between involutional depression and the ele-
vated rate of cardiovascular deaths [5]. Since then, there
has been only limited interest in this subject. Recently,
however, the scientifically significant linkage between
psychosocial health and the heart has been proved. For
example, in the INTERHEART study, psychosocial fac-
tors such as depression and psychosocial stress were
found to be one of the most significant risk factors for
myocardial infarction [6, 7], and the American Heart
Association has stated that depression is an independent
risk factor for a poor prognosis following an acute cor-
onary syndrome [8].
The connection of cardiovascular health with opti-
mism and pessimism is under increasing investigation.
Links have been found between optimism/pessimism
and, for example, the risk of strokes [9], the status of the
major arteries [10], the risk of incident heart failure [11],
the recovery of patients from coronary artery bypass sur-
gery [12–14], and the incidence of CHD [15–18]. All of
these studies have stated that optimism (or the lack of
pessimism) is connected with better cardiovascular out-
comes. Even an optimistic attitude towards one’s cardiac
health, whether justifiable or not, seems to be an inde-
pendent factor that enhances the health of the cardio-
vascular system [19]. Recently, a large review concerning
positive psychological constructs and health outcomes in
patients with cardiovascular disease was published [20],
and some years earlier another review was made about
optimism and physical health with a notable section on
the health of the heart [21]. Nevertheless, none of these
studies or parts of the reviews pays any attention to the
mortality caused by CHD.
The results of most of the studies concerning the con-
nection of the optimism construct and cardiovascular
health suggest that optimism or a low level of pessimism
protects from cardiac problems. When searching for lit-
erature concerning the linkage between optimism, pes-
simism, and the risk of cardiovascular death, we could
only find four studies; they had contradictory results and
none of them were included in the reviews mentioned
earlier.
According
to
one
prospective
study,
one-
dimensionally assessed optimism seemed to diminish
all-cause mortality, mostly by preventing cardiovascular
deaths
[22].
In
another
study,
one-dimensionally
assessed dispositional optimism protected men from car-
diovascular death [23]. One study with only female study
subjects found that optimism diminished mortality re-
lated to CHD [16]. However, in a cross-sectional study
where optimism was also assessed as a single factor –
with optimism and pessimism as opposites – optimism
seemed to increase both cardiovascular mortality and
all-cause mortality [24].
We did not find any prospective studies on general
population samples where the risk of death caused by
CHD was evaluated separately for optimism and pessim-
ism. In addition, in earlier studies single-factor optimism
(i.e. the one-dimensionally assessed bipolar factor with
optimism and pessimism as opposites) seemed to have a
controversial connection to CHD-related deaths. There-
fore, we conducted this 11-year follow-up study on
middle-aged and older Finnish men and women in
which we assessed whether optimism and pessimism as
independent variables are true protective or risk factors
for CHD mortality.
Methods
The GOAL (Good Ageing in Lahti region) study was
started in the district of Lahti, Finland in 2002. Its aim
was to find out ways to improve the health and well-
being of the local aging population in the future. Strati-
fied (age, sex, municipality) random samples of men and
women born in 1926–30, 1936–40, and 1946–50 were
drawn from the population register of all 14 municipal-
ities in the Lahti region. A total of 4272 subjects were
invited and 2815 (66 %) participated. At baseline, the
study subjects filled in questionnaires concerning their
current status of life (e.g. socioeconomic status, psycho-
social background, health, and lifestyle). Levels of blood
glucose and blood total and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol were determined with standardized
methods. The blood pressure of study subjects was mea-
sured at baseline three times and the average was docu-
mented. The smoking habits were also documented, and
the patients were asked about their use of drugs for
hypertension and/or diabetes. Finally, the study subjects
were asked at baseline whether they had CHD diagnosed
by a doctor.
The study subjects filled out the revised version of the
Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) to measure their opti-
mism and pessimism. The original Life Orientation Test
(LOT) was developed in the mid-1980s in order to in-
vestigate the effects of dispositional optimism on the
selfregulation of behavior in a wide variety of domains,
some of them health-related [25]. In 1994, the test was
re-evaluated and revised (LOT-R) by Scheier, Carver,
and Bridges [26] to focus its item content more closely
on expectancies of the future. The questionnaire in-
cludes four fillers (which were disregarded when deter-
mining the level of optimism and pessimism) and six
actual statements, of which three are worded positively
to indicate optimism (e.g., “In uncertain times, I usually
expect the best”) and three are worded negatively for
pessimism (e.g., “If something can go wrong for me, it
will”). The respondents are asked to indicate how well
the statements describe them in general, as expressed on
a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). A higher
score refers to greater optimism or greater pessimism
depending on the statement.

 Even if both LOT and LOT-R were thought to be
one-dimensional scales, later studies have suggested
that they may have two separate independent dimen-
sions: optimism and pessimism. Separating optimism
and pessimism, at least when they are measured by
using LOT or LOT-R, has led to the better prediction
of outcomes in many studies [27–31]. In our previous
work, we also found that in this age-specified general
population sample, LOT-R is a scale with two inde-
pendent subscales [32], and the use of the bipolar
model (i.e. optimism and pessimism as one variable)
would have hidden some of results found in our
study. Thus, in the analyses of this study, we used in-
dependent subscale scores separately for the optimism
and pessimism components. They were named opti-
mism and pessimism, respectively.
Eleven years after the baseline of the study, on 31
December 2013, we could find 2719 (97 %) of the
original 2815 study subjects from official statistics of
the study area. Fifty subjects had to be excluded due
to severe deficiencies in baseline data, diminishing the
study group to 2669 subjects. Of these, 523 had died
between the baseline and 31 December 2013. Those
whose underlying cause of death was other than CHD
were excluded (n = 402). Therefore, the final study
sample included 2267 study subjects, of whom 121
had died from CHD during the 11-year follow-up,
meaning that 2146 were still alive.
In this study, we calculated a general cardiovascular
disease risk score (CVD risk score) for each partici-
pant. This scoring has been developed as a part of
the Framingham Heart Study for use in primary care
[33]. It is a sum of sex-specific scorings of the follow-
ing general risk factors for cardiovascular diseases:
age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood
pressure, smoking, and diabetes. The scoring of sys-
tolic blood pressure in the CVD risk algorithm de-
pends
on
whether
the
subject
is
treated
for
hypertension or not. Smoking status was recorded as
regular smoking or not, and this information was
ascertained by self-report. Diabetes was defined as
fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L, the use of insulin, the use
of oral antidiabetic drugs, or a self-report of having
diabetes diagnosed by a doctor.
In statistical analyses, we used the chi-squared test
for categorical variables. For comparing continuous
variables, we used the nonparametric Mann–Whitney
U test and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Finally, we calcu-
lated logistic regression models to determine ad-
justed odd ratios for the risk of death from CHD.
Adjustments for age and sex were not made because
the CVD risk scorings we calculated were already
sex-specific and they also included age as one of the
risk factors.
Results
Men died from CHD more often than women during
the follow-up (87/1047 (8.3 %) vs 34/1220 (2.8 %), chi-
squared 34.01, p < 0.001). Furthermore, those who died
from CHD were older at baseline (mean 70.0 years
(SD 6.2) vs 62.5 years (SD 7.8), Mann–Whitney U
test p < 0.001).
There were no differences between men and women
in optimism (LOT-R subscale score mean (SD): 8.34
(2.10) vs 8.40 (2.08), Mann–Whitney U test p = 0.70) or
in pessimism (3.85 (2.67) vs 3.80 (2.61), p = 0.83, respect-
ively). No differences were found in optimism between
age groups (aged 52–56 vs 62–66 vs 72–76 years: 8.26
(2.17) vs 8.38 (2.05) vs 8.53 (2.05), Kruskal-Wallis test p
= 0.10), but those of higher age were more pessimistic
(3.34 (2.68) vs 3.86 (2.57) vs 4.42 (2.56), p < 0.001,
respectively).
Those who died from CHD during the 11-year
follow-up had been significantly more pessimistic at
baseline than the subjects who were still alive (LOT-
R subscale score mean (SD): 4.78 (2.41) vs 3.77
(2.64), Mann–Whitney U test p < 0.001), while in op-
timism, there was no difference (LOT-R subscale
score mean (SD): 8.40 (2.17) vs 8.37 (2.09), p = 0.98,
respectively). These findings apply to both genders
(Table 1).
Those men and women who had died from CHD
during the follow-up had had lower baseline total and
HDL
cholesterol
levels
and
higher
blood
glucose
levels than those men and women who were still
alive, and their total general CVD risk scores were
higher. Not surprisingly, those men and women who
died from CHD during the follow-up had at baseline
more often reported having CHD diagnosed by a doc-
tor. They also used medication for hypertension and
diabetes more often than the other men and women
(Table 1).
Finally, we calculated a logistic regression model for
the risk of death from CHD. Instead of using separate
single risk factors, we included only the baseline pes-
simism subscale score, the presence of CHD, and the
general CVD risk score (which includes the most sig-
nificant physiological risk factors for CHD in itself)
in the model. Pessimism was associated independently
statistically significantly with the risk of death from
CHD (Table 2; Model 1). To highlight the significance
of pessimism as a risk factor for CHD-induced death,
we compared the highest and the lowest quartiles of
pessimism in a similar model. Those who were in the
highest quartile of pessimism had nearly a 2.2-fold
higher adjusted odds ratio for death from CHD dur-
ing the 11-year follow-up period when compared to
those in the lowest quartile of pessimism (Table 2;
Model 2).

 Discussion
Our main finding was that pessimism is a strong in-
dependent risk factor for death from CHD. The mag-
nitude of the result seems to be quite similar when
compared to the three earlier studies we found on
this subject [16, 22, 23]. Nevertheless, results from
those other studies cannot be directly compared to
our findings because in those studies the optimism
construct was determined as a bipolar single factor,
whereas we used separate optimism and pessimism
variables. In our study, optimism did not associate
with the mortality rates induced by CHD.
Those with higher scores on the pessimism subscale at
baseline may have had more physiological risk factors of
CHD already at the beginning of the 11-year follow-up
and one might think that awareness of those risk factors
could be one reason for pessimism. However, it has been
demonstrated that personality traits evolve at a relatively
early age and after that they are very stable. For example,
bad news about one’s health seems to have no effect on
the LOT-R scores [34, 35].
Our result – pessimism being the only variable out
of optimism and pessimism that mediates the effect
of the optimism construct on the risk of CHD-
induced death, while the optimism has no influence
at all – is not unique. For example, in the review by
Rasmussen et al. it was also speculated that the pres-
ence or absence of pessimism alone might determine
the
effect
of
the
optimism
construct
on
cardiac
health, regardless of optimism [21]. This emphasizes
the stance that the optimism construct should be
seen
to
include
two
separate
and
independent

 dimensions, optimism and pessimism, instead of one
continuum with two poles. This means that people
should not be categorized as “optimists” or “pessi-
mists”. This theory is supported by several other
studies, too [27–31].
Optimism in the scientific sense focuses on expect-
ancies of the future, which links it to expectancy-
value models of motivation [36]. In other words, if a
person is optimistic about something she/he wants to
achieve, she/he may consider that goal achievable,
which in turn may help and motivate behaviour in a
way that enables reaching that goal. In pessimism, the
connection is logically converse: if a person is pessim-
istic about something she/he wants to achieve, she/he
may consider that goal as somehow impossible or at
least
improbable,
which
may
diminish
the
efforts
made to accomplish the goal. For example, when
studying the optimism construct and cardiac health, a
high level of optimism has been found to associate
with a healthier lifestyle, for example with higher
vegetable, fruit, and whole-grain bread consumption;
higher physical activity; lower smoking rates; a health-
ier diet; a healthy lipid profile; and a lower body mass
index, which all decrease the incidence of CHD [37–39].
These examples are connected with behaviour, which in
turn is thought to be affected by the optimism construct.
On the other hand, a high level of pessimism has been
linked with several factors that have effects on cardiac
health, i.e. elevated inflammation markers, endothelial
dysfunction, and shorter telomere length [40, 41]. These
factors cannot as clearly be seen as direct consequences of
behaviour.
The optimism construct seems to have a clear im-
pact on physiological health and CHD mortality even
after adjustments for the well-known classical risk
factors of cardiovascular diseases. This finding sug-
gests that our knowledge about the connection be-
tween the optimism construct and physical health is
far from complete. Separating optimism and pessim-
ism seems to highlight that pessimism may be the
variable in the optimism construct that mediates the
effect, and this separation may be of benefit in study-
ing this topic in the future.
One strength of this study is its design. The study
group was selected randomly and it was constituted
of equal numbers of both sexes and representatives of
all the age groups invited, so the study group can be
seen as comprehensive. Eleven years is a relatively
long time and it seems to be enough for the detect-
able and statistically significant differences in CHD-
induced mortality to appear. The fact that the study
was prospective makes it more reliable. In our study,
life orientation was measured using the well-known
test pattern of the LOT-R, and optimism and the
pessimism were seen as different variables, which
seems to clarify the results.
There are a few limitations in this study as well. It
is probable that poorly functioning and institutional-
ized
persons
had
a
lower
participation
rate
than
community-dwelling subjects. It is also probable that
the incidence of CHD-induced death would have been
higher in those populations. At the same time, it is
not known whether there are any differences in pes-
simism between these groups and rest of the popula-
tion. Much of the data used in this study is based on
the questionnaires filled out by the study subjects
themselves, so there might be some inconsistency be-
tween the answers and the reality in the questions
concerning, for example, smoking habits and use of
the medications.
Conclusions
Pessimism seems to be quite a significant risk factor for
death from coronary heart disease both in men and
women, while optimism does not protect from it. Asses-
sing optimism and pessimism as separate entities im-
proves the prognostic values of the connection between
these personality traits and coronary heart disease. The
level of pessimism can be measured easily and non-
invasively and it might be a very useful tool together
with the other known risk factors to determine the risk
of CHD-induced mortality.
