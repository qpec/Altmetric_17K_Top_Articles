ildagliptin is one of the most extensively studied dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in terms of its clinical utility. Over the 
last decade, a vast panorama of evidence on the benefit–risk profile of vildagliptin has been generated in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this article, we review the cumulative evidence on the safety of vildagliptin from the clinical development 
programme, as well as reports of rare adverse drug reactions detected during the post-marketing surveillance of the drug. Across clinical 
studies, the overall safety and tolerability profile of vildagliptin was similar to placebo, and it was supported by real-world data in a broad 
population of patients with T2DM, making DPP-4 inhibitors, like vildagliptin, a safe option for managing patients with T2DM.

The introduction of vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2007 provided 
clinicians with a novel and effective treatment option for lowering blood 
glucose, which neither caused weight gain nor increased the risk of 
hypoglycaemia.1,2 However, looking back on early development, there 
were theoretical apprehensions regarding the overall benefit–risk profile 
of DPP-4 inhibitors as anti-diabetes agents, due to the involvement of 
DPP-4 in the metabolism of other bioactive peptides.3 Being the first 
molecules under development, extensive in vitro and pre-clinical studies 
were conducted with vildagliptin and its predecessor, DPP-728, to map 
their off-target pharmacology. The in vitro and pre-clinical safety profiles 
were encouraging, with only a few species-specific safety signals 
pertaining to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (CV) and immune 
systems at concentrations that were approximately five to seven times 
the anticipated human exposure.4,5 These insights from the pre-clinical 
studies were taken into account while designing the clinical development 
programme, and a special feature was the prospective, independent 
adjudication of CV events enabling a proper meta-analysis to establish 
the CV safety of vildagliptin at programme completion. 
The benefit–risk profile of a new agent is seldom complete at the time 
of launch, as limited exposure in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
does not provide adequate evidence regarding the safety of the agent 
under real-world conditions.6,7 It is therefore important to continuously 
monitor the safety of any therapeutic agent post-launch using a variety 
of complementary approaches. The concept of risk management, 
although used empirically, was formally introduced for all new medical 
entities in Europe in 2006.8 This coincided with the time when the first 
DPP-4 inhibitors were approved. The main focus of a risk management 
plan (RMP) is to identify and minimise the risks associated with the drug. 
The use of RMPs, along with an increased emphasis on CV safety9,10 led 
to the enrichment of the drug development programmes in diabetes, 
involving pooled safety analyses, meta-analyses and, when required, 
large, randomised, controlled outcome trials. These modalities, along 
with the real-world studies, paint the full picture of the safety, tolerability, 
and effectiveness of this class.

 Clinical Safety and Tolerability of Vildagliptin – Insights 
69
EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
Vildagliptin, one of the earlier launched DPP-4 inhibitors,11 is marketed 
in over 125 countries, and more than 17 million patients have been 
exposed to vildagliptin since its launch in 2007. This article reviews 
the overall safety and tolerability profile of vildagliptin, with a focus on 
adverse events (AEs) that have been of interest for patients with T2DM or 
for the DPP-4 inhibitor class in general. In addition to the pre-clinical data 
generated over the last decades, this article includes data from the latest 
vildagliptin CV meta-analysis,12 observational studies,13 findings from 
post-marketing surveillance (PMS) reported to the health authorities and 
the most recent cumulative safety analysis part of the periodic safety 
update report. The latter includes 58 phase II to IV Novartis-sponsored 
RCTs comprising more than 10,000 patients treated with vildagliptin 
50 mg (once daily [qd]/ twice daily [bid]) and more than 8,000 patients 
treated with comparators (placebo and active comparators). AEs in 
all the studies were assessed by the investigator and were encoded 
using the MedDRA system. Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (MHRR) were 
used to compare selected AEs between vildagliptin and comparators. 
The methodology for pooling and analysis is similar to that reported in 
the earlier pooled safety publications,14,15 and results are expressed as 
exposure-adjusted incidence, i.e., number of patients having event over 
100 subject-years of exposure (SYEs). 
General safety and tolerability 
Upon oral administration, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed and is primarily 
eliminated by hydrolysis via multiple organs/tissues.16 The diverse, non-
cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolic pathways and negligible 
protein binding (<10%) indicate a low potential for drug interactions for 
vildagliptin.16 This was further confirmed in the drug interaction studies 
with commonly co-prescribed medications (metformin, pioglitazone, 
glyburide, simvastatin, amlodipine, valsartan, ramipril, digoxin and 
warfarin), which did not indicate any clinically relevant changes in the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of any of the administered drugs.17 Furthermore, 
the PK of vildagliptin is not affected by age, gender, body mass index, 
food or ethnicity.18 
A wealth of evidence from RCTs and real-world studies has consistently 
demonstrated that vildagliptin is an effective and well-tolerated 
treatment, with an established weight neutrality and low risk of 
hypoglycaemia.19,20 A pooled safety analysis of 58 trials (vildagliptin, 
n=10,331; 9,602 SYEs; all comparators, n=8,068; 7,386 SYEs) has shown 
that the frequency of overall AEs (64.5% versus 66.0% for vildagliptin 
versus all comparators, respectively), serious adverse events (SAEs; 
8.0% versus 8.5%, respectively), discontinuations (5.2% versus 5.8%, 
respectively) and deaths (0.5% in both the groups) was similar between 
vildagliptin and all comparators. There was no specific trend in the AE 
and SAE profiles and the events were distributed across many different 
system organ classes (SOC). Similarly, no major imbalances were found 
between vildagliptin and comparators in the frequency of AEs leading 
to discontinuations. These findings are also supported by the large, real-
life, Effectiveness of Diabetes control with vildaGliptin and vildagliptin/
mEtformin (EDGE) study (n=45868), in which the incidence of overall AEs 
was similar in the vildagliptin (5.3%) and comparator groups (5.7%).13 
Further evidence comes from a systematic review and meta-analysis, 
which concluded that vildagliptin is a safe therapeutic option for patients 
with T2DM, both as monotherapy and as add-on treatment.19 Vildagliptin 
is approved for use as monotherapy and in combination with other 
anti-hyperglycaemic agents. It is also indicated for special populations 
(elderly, renal impairment) and there are no contraindications beyond 
hypersensitivity to the active constituent.5 Overall, the evidence from 
RCTs and real-world studies provides reassurance regarding the general 
safety of vildagliptin in a broad population of patients with T2DM.21 
Adverse events of special interest for dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibition-based therapies
Immune related and infections
DPP-4, also known as CD26, plays an essential role in immune response 
as it is extensively expressed on T-lymphocytes.22 The DPP-4 catalytic site 
is a small part of CD26, and in vitro studies have shown that binding 
to the catalytic site does not affect binding on other sites of CD26. 
Concerted efforts were made in both early pre-clinical and clinical 
studies to identify any potential effects of vildagliptin on the immune 
system. In rats, vildagliptin was well tolerated at a daily dose of up to 
900 mg/kg, and both primary and secondary immunoglobulin responses 
were not affected. Other animal studies have also confirmed that 
vildagliptin does not impair key parameters of the innate and adaptive 
immune responses.23 
Similarly, data from clinical trials did not indicate an increased risk of 
infections, even in the most vulnerable subjects, such as very elderly 
or those with renal impairment.24,25 In the pooled safety analysis, the 
overall exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs in the infections and 
infestations SOC was comparable between vildagliptin (33.1/100 SYEs) 
and all comparators (32.9/100 SYEs), and the incidence of SAEs in the 
same SOC was 1.5/100 SYEs in both the groups. Furthermore, in a 
comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, no increase 
in nasopharyngitis (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.93–1.21), upper respiratory tract infections (OR 1.19; 95% CI 
0.98–1.45) or urinary tract infections (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57–1.56) was 
reported with vildagliptin.19 
Angioedema
Potential interaction between DPP-4 inhibitors and angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been studied, as both DPP-4 
and ACE are actively involved in the metabolism of substance P
.26 To 
address this, all the angioedema-related AEs in the vildagliptin clinical 
trial programme were independently and prospectively adjudicated. 
In the updated vildagliptin pooled safety analysis, the incidence of 
angioedema was similar between vildagliptin and all comparators (0.3% 
in both the groups). However, there were more events of angioedema 
in patients taking vildagliptin concurrently with an ACE inhibitor (0.5%) 
when compared to comparators (0.3%). The majority of the angioedema 
cases were mild and resolved with ongoing treatment. Similar findings 
were also observed with other DPP-4 inhibitors.27–29 
Acute pancreatitis
Patients with T2DM have a twofold increased risk of acute pancreatitis 
compared with healthy individuals.30 Vildagliptin, as all incretin-based 
therapies, has been extensively evaluated for its pancreatic safety in 
various pre-clinical and pooled analyses, due to the potential risk of 
pancreatic events with glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies, 
despite the lack of evidence of a causal relationship. Long-term studies in 
rodents (rats and mice) at approximately 200 times the human exposure 
dose have shown that vildagliptin is not associated with any evidence of 
pancreatitis.31 Similar findings have been observed for all the other GLP-1 
based therapies.32 The pooled safety analysis of data from all phase II–IV 
studies demonstrated that the incidence of acute pancreatitis was similar 
for vildagliptin and all comparators (0.3/100 SYEs in both the groups). This 
was further confirmed by a meta-analysis of 69 trials, wherein there was 
no increased risk of pancreatitis with vildagliptin relative to comparators 
(OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.37–2.53; I2=0%).19 
Post-marketing cases of pancreatic AEs have been reported with the 
use of various anti-diabetes agents over time, including GLP-1 based

therapies.33 Although an extensive evaluation of non-clinical and clinical 
data by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) suggested no causal association between 
pancreatic AEs and GLP-1 based therapies,34 the risk of acute pancreatitis 
has been added to the label of all the GLP-1 based therapies. A recent 
meta-analysis using data from the CV outcomes trials for pooled DPP-
4 inhibitors (excluding vildagliptin) demonstrated an increased relative 
risk of acute pancreatitis (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.13–2.82)35 versus placebo, 
albeit the absolute risk increase was low (0.13%).35 
Adverse events of special interest for patients 
with T2DM
Neoplasms
There is evidence indicating an increased risk of cancer in patients with 
T2DM.36 Vildagliptin has been evaluated in a range of genotoxicity assays, 
the results of which did not indicate a genotoxic risk to humans. A 2-year 
carcinogenicity study in rats, with a dose approximately 200 times the 
human exposure, did not show an increase in overall tumour incidence.5 
In another study in mice at a dose >240 times the human exposure, a 
slight increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas was 
observed with vildagliptin, the no-effect dose being approximately 
500 mg/kg (59-fold human exposure). In the vildagliptin pooled safety 
analysis, the incidence of all cancers (benign, malignant, and unspecified 
neoplasms) was similar with vildagliptin and comparators (1.9% in both 
the groups). There was a numerical imbalance in the incidence of the 
AE of breast cancer, 0.4 versus 0.2/100 SYEs (vildagliptin versus all 
comparators); however, the incidence in the all-comparator group was 
lower than the previously reported incidence of breast cancer from large-
scale epidemiological studies,37,38 which suggests that the imbalance 
might be a chance finding. 
The development of drug-induced carcinogenicity takes a long time, so 
exposure during RCTs is unlikely to uncover such risks.39 Using evidence 
from RCTs and open-label safety studies, the incidence of neoplasms 
of interest for incretin-based therapies, such as pancreatic cancer, 
appeared to be lower with vildagliptin than comparators (0.026 versus 
0.04/100 SYEs). It is reassuring that more than 10 years of PMS by health 
authorities and pharmaceutical companies did not suggest an increased 
risk of cancer with DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.
Cardiovascular safety 
DPP-4 inhibitors have been extensively evaluated for their CV safety, 
and the cumulative evidence has demonstrated CV safety with respect 
to major adverse CV events (MACE). However, as increased rates of 
hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) were observed with saxagliptin 
(saxagliptin, 3.5% versus placebo, 2.8%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.27; 95% CI 
1.07–1.51; p=0.007),40 and alogliptin (3.1% versus placebo, 2.9%; HR 1.07; 
95% CI 0.79–1.46),41 the FDA (5 April 2016) requested for inclusion of the 
potential increased risk of HF to the labels of saxagliptin and alogliptin.42 
A large, real-world observational study in more than 127,000 patients 
demonstrated a lower risk for HF-related hospitalisations in DPP-4 
inhibitor-treated patients versus sulphonylureas.43,44 
Analysis of patient-level data pooled from large development 
programmes, which provide sufficient exposure to the investigational 
drug and include diverse patient populations and comparators, is a 
robust way of assessing CV safety.9 The CV safety of vildagliptin was 
confirmed in a meta-analysis of independently and prospectively 
adjudicated CV events from 40 phase III and IV trials enrolling over 
17,000 patients. The MHRR for the incidence of MACE with vildagliptin 
versus comparator was 0.82 (95% CI 0.61–1.11). Similar risk ratios 
(RRs) were observed for the individual MACE endpoints: myocardial 
infarction (0.87; 95% CI 0.56–1.38), stroke (0.84; 95% CI 0.47–1.50) and 
CV death (0.77; 95% CI 0.45–1.131) (see Figure 1). The meta-analysis 
 
also included patients with advanced disease (T2DM duration more than 
10 years), elderly (over 65 years of age), patients with renal impairment 
and patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).12 As the events were 
prospectively adjudicated, and the upper bound of the 95% CI was 
<1.3, an additional outcome trial was not required to establish the CV 
safety of vildagliptin.45  
In the CV meta-analysis, the MHRR for the incidence of confirmed HF 
events (vildagliptin versus comparator) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.68–1.70), 
showing no increased risk of HF in vildagliptin-treated patients versus 
comparators.12 The safety of vildagliptin in patients with CHF (New 
York Heart Association [NYHA] class I–III) was also assessed in the 
 
52-week,

randomised, 
Vildagliptin 
In 
VentrIcular 
Dysfunction Diabetes (VIVIDD) trial, which showed that vildagliptin was 
not associated with a change in left ventricular function or worsening 
 
of pre-existing CHF
.46 An analytical, non-interventional, multi-database 
study provided further evidence on the relative safety of vildagliptin in 
CHF under real-life conditions.47 The adjusted incidence risk ratios (IRRs) 
for CHF were close to 1 (0.49–1.03) for vildagliptin versus other non-insulin 
 
antidiabetic medications.47 
Hepatic safety
It is important to establish the hepatic safety of an anti-diabetes agent 
as patients with T2DM have a high prevalence of liver disease compared 
to the general population.48 Evidence from non-clinical toxicology and 
in vitro studies did not indicate a risk of hepatotoxicity with vildagliptin. 
Since vildagliptin is not metabolised by CYP to a significant extent, 
 
the presence of hepatic impairment does not increase the exposure 
 
to vildagliptin.49 
In the pooled safety analysis, the incidence of mild elevations in 
hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ≥3 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) was similar 
for vildagliptin versus comparators (MHRR 1.19; 95% CI 0.79–1.81), and 
there was no increased risk for ALT and AST ≥3 ULN, accompanied by 
bilirubin >ULN (MHRR 0.97; 95% CI 0.16–5.92). The incidence of hepatic 
AEs (1.6 versus 1.8/100 SYEs, respectively) and SAEs (0.2 versus 0.1/100

SYEs, respectively) was similar between the vildagliptin and comparator 
groups. In the large, observational EDGE study, liver function test (LFT) 
abnormalities were infrequent: in the vildagliptin group, 411 of 9,508 
patients (4.3%) had bilirubin >ULN versus 190 of 4,691 patients (4.1%) 
receiving other oral anti-diabetes drugs (OADs).13 However, a study in 
patients with T2DM having good glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin 
[HbA1c] ≤7.9%) demonstrated that treatment with vildagliptin results in 
a clinically meaningful decrease in liver triglyceride levels, which was 
associated with a decrease in plasma ALT and glucose levels.50 Rare cases 
of elevations in hepatic enzymes that were generally asymptomatic 
without clinical sequelae have been observed.5 Vildagliptin is not 
recommended in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients 
with elevated ALT/AST levels.
Renal safety
The renal safety profile of an anti-diabetes agent is yet another important 
consideration, as chronic kidney disease is a common late-stage 
complication of progressive T2DM. The increased risk of hypoglycaemia 
and increased or unpredictable exposure to, not only anti-diabetes, but 
also other drugs adds to the complexity of managing T2DM in patients 
with renal impairment. The benefit–risk profile of vildagliptin has been 
extensively evaluated in patients with renal impairment in studies 
ranging from PK assessment51 to clinical safety in patients undergoing 
haemodialysis.52 In subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, 
the exposure to vildagliptin increases up to twofold, without significantly 
affecting the maximum concentration (Cmax); accordingly, the effective 
half-life is increased sufficiently to allow a 50 mg qd dose in patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment.51 
The efficacy and safety of vildagliptin in patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment were evaluated in a large (n=525) 1-year randomised 
trial. The safety profile of vildagliptin 50 mg qd in patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment was similar to that of placebo.25 In another 
study, vildagliptin and sitagliptin (n=148) showed similar safety profiles 
in patients with severe renal impairment.53 There is no evidence that 
failure to adjust for an increase in exposure with vildagliptin results in 
renal toxicity.54 Vildagliptin was well tolerated in patients with severe 
renal impairment uncontrolled on insulin,55 in elderly patients (≥75 years) 
with moderate or severe renal impairment,56 in patients with new-onset 
diabetes after transplantation (NODAT)57 and in patients undergoing 
haemodialysis,52 with a similar AE/SAE profile to placebo.
Additional adverse drug reactions from  
post-marketing experience
Although the assessment of safety using data from controlled studies 
remains the gold standard, it is important to assess PMS reports 
in order to continuously evaluate the benefit–risk profile of a drug. 
Furthermore, as PMS reports contain data from a large number of 
diverse patients, certain rare AEs that are otherwise not observed 
during the clinical trial programme, may appear over time. Such 
events are rare and by virtue of being detected retrospectively, 
their association with the drug is not conclusively established, as 
findings are often complicated by co-medications and comorbidities. 
Some events such as acute pancreatitis and hepatobiliary disorders 
have been discussed earlier; in addition, other adverse reactions 
emerging from PMS include skin-related events and musculoskeletal 
 
disorders (arthralgia). 
Skin-related adverse events
Patients with T2DM have an increased risk of skin-related diseases. 
Skin lesions in extremities of Cynomolgus monkeys were observed 
with vildagliptin during early pre-clinical studies at doses of ≥5 mg/kg/
day.4 The lesions were of vascular origin and were not observed in any 
other animal species.4 Similarly, the vildagliptin pooled safety analysis did 
not find an increased incidence of all skin-related AEs with vildagliptin 
compared to comparators (1.6 versus 1.4/100 SYEs, respectively); 
however, data from the recently published signal detection studies using 
pharmacovigilance databases showed increased reports of bullous 
pemphigoid (BP) in patients using DPP-4 inhibitors.58,59 The majority 
of bullous skin lesions were observed in elderly patients,60 which is 
consistent with the epidemiology data suggesting increasing age as a 
risk factor for BP
.61–63 In accordance with the guidance on routine care, 
monitoring for skin lesions in patients with T2DM treated with a DPP-4 
inhibitor is recommended.5 
Arthralgia
A warning of arthralgia/severe joint pain has been added to the labels 
of DPP-4 inhibitors64 on the basis of 33 rare cases of arthralgia/severe 
joint pain that were observed in a review of the FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System database.65 In the pooled safety analysis, the incidence 
of arthralgia of any severity was similar for vildagliptin and comparators 
(3.7% versus 3.3%, respectively). One report suggests a slight increase in 
the incidence of arthralgia with vildagliptin (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.02–1.48; 
I2=0%; p=0.8).19 
Conclusions
The efficacy profile, together with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, no weight 
gain, and absence of increased risk for CV events has established the 
clinical utility of DPP-4 inhibitors, such as vildagliptin, as anti-diabetes 
agents for the treatment of patients with T2DM. DPP-4 inhibitors as a 
class are also the most extensively evaluated oral glucose-lowering 
agents in terms of their benefit–risk profile which has contributed greatly 
to evidence-based clinical practice. 
The cumulative clinical experience with vildagliptin and DPP-4 inhibitors, 
in general, has been encouraging in terms of their safety profile. Notably, 
vildagliptin did not increase the risk of any AEs of interest, such as 
infections, or those frequently observed in patients with T2DM, such as 
major adverse CV events. The key known risks include rare cases of mild 
to moderate elevations in hepatic enzymes, rare cases of angioedema 
(mostly in patients taking a concomitant ACE inhibitor) that resolved with 
ongoing treatment and acute pancreatitis, common for the GLP-1 based 
therapies. The data suggest that these AEs usually resolve upon drug 
discontinuation. The benefit–risk profile of vildagliptin has not changed 
considerably over the past 10 years, while the product has been widely 
used in clinical settings, with only a few reports of rare adverse drug 
reactions, including pancreatitis, bullous or exfoliative skin lesions and 
arthralgia, detected by PMS. By virtue of its established safety profile, 
vildagliptin continues to be a key treatment option for managing diverse 
patients with T2DM.
