ABSTRACT 
Objective The potential impact of environmental exposure to pyrethroid insecticides on child 
neurodevelopment has just started to receive attention, despite their widespread use. We 
investigated the associations between prenatal and childhood exposure to pyrethroid insecticides 
and behavioral skills in 6‐year‐olds.  
Methods The PELAGIE cohort enrolled 3,421 pregnant women from Brittany, France between 2002 
and 2006. When their children turned six, 428 mothers were randomly selected for the study, and 
287 (67%) agreed to participate. Children's behavior was assessed using the Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Three subscales (prosocial behavior, internalizing disorders and 
externalizing disorders) were considered. Five pyrethroid metabolites were measured in maternal 
and child urine samples collected between 6 and 19 gestational weeks and at 6 years of age, 
respectively. Logistic regression and reverse‐scale Cox regression models were used to estimate the 
associations between SDQ scores and urinary pyrethroid metabolite concentrations, adjusting for 
organophosphate metabolite concentrations and potential confounders.  
Results Increased prenatal cis‐3‐(2,2‐dichlorovinyl)‐2,2‐dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid 
(DCCA) concentrations were associated with internalizing difficulties (Cox p‐value=0.05). For 
childhood 3‑phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) concentrations, a positive association was observed with 
externalizing difficulties (Cox p‐value=0.04) and high odds ratios (ORs) were found for abnormal or 
borderline social behavior (OR=2.93, 95% CI: 1.27, 6.78, and OR=1.91, 95% CI: 0.80, 4.57, for the 
intermediate and highest metabolite categories, respectively). High childhood trans‐DCCA 
concentrations were associated with reduced externalizing disorders (Cox p‐value=0.03).  
Conclusions The present study suggests that exposure to certain pyrethroids, at environmental 
levels, may negatively affect neurobehavioral development by 6 years of age.

INTRODUCTION 
Pesticide‐monitoring studies carried out in the European Union and the United States have 
indicated a shift in residential pesticide exposure from organophosphate (OP) insecticides to 
pyrethroid insecticides in recent decades, with detectable amounts of pyrethroid metabolites in 
urine samples from the general population.1‐3 This shift results from the increasing concern about 
the adverse health consequences of OP insecticides, while pyrethroids were purportedly a safer 
alternative for humans and the environment.4 Like many other classes of insecticides, pyrethroids 
are neurotoxicants. They allow more sodium ions to cross and depolarize the neuronal membrane 
and cause repetitive nerve impulses in insects and other pests.5 Because of increasing pesticide 
regulations to protect health and the environment, pyrethroids have become the predominant 
insecticide class (to control pests in residential and agricultural settings, and to treat head lice and 
scabies in humans and fleas in pets),6 yet animal studies suggest the potential for 
neurodevelopmental toxicity.5  
Exposure to pyrethroids in the general population is widespread, mostly through diet and indoor 
residential uses (via ingestion, dermal, and inhalation pathways).7 After uptake in the human body, 
pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized and mainly excreted in urine. Many pyrethroids are 
enzymatically transformed into the relatively non‐class‐specific metabolite 3‑phenoxybenzoic acid 
(3‑PBA). Permethrin, cypermethrin and cyfluthrin are also transformed into cis or trans‐3‐(2,2‐
dichlorovinyl)‐2,2‐dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (cis‐ or trans‐DCCA) metabolites. 4‐fluoro‐
3‐phenoxybenzoic acid (4‐F‐3PBA) is a specific metabolite of cyfluthrin and cis‐3‐(2,2‐dibromovinyl)‐
2,2‐dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (cis‐DBCA) a specific metabolite of deltamethrin. 
Pyrethroid compounds can cross the placental barrier as permethrin was detected in human cord 
plasma samples, collected at or immediately postpartum.8 
The potential neurobehavioral toxicity of pyrethroid exposure in children has just started to 
receive attention. Shelton et al. showed that children (aged 2 to 5 years) of mothers residing near 
pyrethroid insecticide agricultural applications just prior to conception or during their third 
trimester were at greater risk for autism spectrum disorders.9 Regarding childhood exposures, 
Oulhote and Bouchard observed a significant association between childhood (6‐11 years of age) 
concentration of the cis‐DCCA pyrethroid metabolite in the urine (but not 3‐PBA or trans‐DCCA 
concentrations) and high scores for total behavioral difficulties on the Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire (SDQ).10 Wagner‐Schuman et al. found an association among 8‐ to 15‐year‐old 
children between increased urinary levels of the pyrethroid metabolite 3‐PBA (the only metabolite 
 5 
considered) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and hyperactive‐impulsive 
symptoms.11 Domingues et al. showed that levels of 3‐PBA were higher in the urine of a group of 
children (aged 5 to 12 years) affected by autism spectrum disorders in comparison with those of 
control children.12 On the other hand, Quirós‐Alcalá et al. reported that childhood (6 to 15 years of 
age) 3‐PBA, cis‐DCCA and trans‐DCCA pyrethroid metabolite concentrations were not associated 
with parental reports of ADHD.13 However, neither of these studies assessed exposure to 
pyrethroid insecticides both prenatally and during childhood. 
Using a longitudinal design, we recently showed with the French PELAGIE mother‐child cohort 
data that childhood exposure to pyrethroid insecticides, as measured by urinary 3‐PBA and cis‐
DBCA metabolite concentrations, was associated with poorer neurocognitive abilities in children at 
6 years of age, after adjusting for prenatal pyrethroid exposure, various potential confounders and 
childhood OP insecticide metabolite levels.14 Conversely, we observed no consistent associations 
between neurocognitive abilities and prenatal urinary pyrethroid metabolite concentrations. Our 
goal is now to investigate the associations between prenatal or childhood exposure to pyrethroid 
insecticides and mental and behavioral difficulties in 6‐year‐olds, as assessed by the SDQ. 
 
METHODS 
Study setting and design 
Subjects in this report were selected from the French PELAGIE mother‐child cohort that was 
extensively described previously.15‐16 Briefly, 3,421 pregnant women from Brittany, France were 
included from January 2002 to February 2006. Women were enrolled during their first prenatal visit 
before the 19th week of gestation after completing a questionnaire at home concerning family, 
social and demographic characteristics, diet and lifestyle. Midwives and pediatricians at the 
maternity units provided the study staff with medical information about the pregnancy, delivery, 
birth weight and neonatal health for 3,399 women and their newborns. 
As described in Viel et al., a random subcohort of 571 mothers was selected for 
neuropsychological follow‐up and potential pesticide determination in prenatal urine sample from 
the mothers who delivered live‐born singleton infants (without severe neonatal abnormalities or 
hospitalization), to obtain a final sample of size similar to those used in previous insecticide 
exposure studies.14 Among these mothers, 446 were successfully contacted by phone, and 18 were 
further excluded because their child had already undergone neuropsychological or behavioral tests 
 6 
(to avoid bias due to learning effect and benefits of possible psychological care). A total of 287 
(67%) mothers agreed to participate with their 6‐year‐old child in the neuropsychological follow‐up 
that took place between October 2009 and September 2012. Mothers completed a self‐
administered questionnaire to provide information on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle 
factors and their child’s health, behavior and environmental exposures. Home visits were organized 
by two psychologists who were blinded to exposure levels. They were in charge of maternal 
intelligence scoring, child neurodevelopmental assessments, maternal interviews for home 
environment assessments, child urine collections and dust sampling.  
 
Assessment of child behavior at age 6 
Behavior was assessed using the French parent version of the SDQ,17 a validated screening 
instrument for epidemiologic research in children 4 to 16 years of age.18 Parents, mostly mothers, 
completed a list of 25 questions to describe their child’s behavior in the previous 6 months. The 
responses for each item were coded 0 for "not true", 1 for "somewhat true" or 2 for "certainly 
true". These 25 core attributes were divided into five subscales (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, 
peer and prosocial behavior) with five items each. Each subscale had a summed score ranging from 
0 to 10. Children with higher scores are more likely to have behavioral problems, except on the 
prosocial subscale, where higher scores indicate positive social behavior.  
The SDQ was not completed by 3 children in the study. In the remaining 284 children, thirteen 
missing data values for the neurobehavioral scores (1 emotional, 3 conduct, 5 hyperactivity and 4 
peer) were replaced, for a given subscale, by the mode estimated from the children with an exact 
match on the three other subscales (as missingness was fairly limited we did not use multiple 
imputation).  
Following Goodman et al.,19 we calculated two alternative ten‐item "internalizing" (emotional 
and peer items) and "externalizing" (behavioral and hyperactivity items) SDQ subscales that each 
ranged from 0 to 20 because they are more appropriate when selecting outcome variables in low‐
risk, epidemiological samples. Prosocial behavior was classified as normal, borderline or abnormal 
using French normative cut‐off points (7 to 10 = normal, 6 = borderline and 0 to 5 = abnormal, 
because high scores are desirable for the prosocial scale).17 No cut‐off points on the internalizing 
and externalizing subscales were available from a French population sample; however, the French 
cut‐off points on the original items were very similar to those of the UK and US.17 Therefore, we 
 7 
used the UK cut‐offs for the remaining two scores: internalizing subscale (0 to 5 = normal, 6 to 7 = 
borderline and 8 to 20 = abnormal) and externalizing subscale (0 to 8 = normal, 9 to 10 = borderline 
and 11 to 20 = abnormal).19 Then, the abnormal and borderline categories were a priori aggregated 
to create a dichotomous dependent variable with sufficient outcomes for analysis: 49 (17.3%) for 
reverse‐scored prosocial behavior, 67 (23.6%) for internalizing subscale and 51 (18.0%) for 
externalizing subscale. 
 
Maternal interviews and home assessments at child age 6 
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – 3rd revision (WAIS‐III) was administered to mothers.20 The 
Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ) score was used to assess general knowledge, language, reasoning 
and memory skills. To evaluate the quality and extent of stimulation available to the child in the 
home environment, the HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment) 
inventory was used, as in many studies of neurotoxicity.21 Higher HOME scores indicate a more 
supportive and stimulating home environment.  
 
Pyrethroid and other neurotoxicants exposure assessments 
To measure the highest possible pyrethroid concentrations, first‐morning‐void urine samples were 
collected, during early pregnancy (6‐19 gestational weeks) for mothers and during the 6‐year visit 
for children (at age ranging from 5.99 to 6.27 years). Samples were kept frozen in storage at ‐20°C 
until analysis at the LABOCEA laboratory (Plouzané, France). 
We measured the five major metabolites of pyrethroid insecticides detected in the urine: 3‐PBA, 
4‐F‐3‐PBA, cis‐DCCA and trans‐DCCA, and cis‐DBCA. Six nonspecific OP dialkylphosphate 
metabolites were also measured. Concentrations were summed to obtain overall concentrations of 
diethylphosphate metabolites (DE; sum of diethylphosphate, diethylthiophosphate and 
diethyldithiophosphate) and dimethylphosphate metabolites (DM; sum of dimethylphosphate, 
dimethylthiophosphate and dimethyldithiophosphate). Extensive details on the laboratory methods 
can be found elsewhere.14 
Eighty‐two mothers were missing measures for all pyrethroid metabolites, and 55 mothers were 
missing measures for DM and DE phosphate metabolites, mostly because the entire samples were 
 8 
used for other urine assays. Three children had missing 3‐PBA, 4‐F‐3PBA, DM and DE phosphate 
levels, and four had missing trans‐DCCA, cis‐DCCA and cis‐DBCA measures.  
Lead, which we considered to be a potential confounder, was measured using a standard 
protocol whereby wipe samples of floor dust were collected from the living room.22 No blood lead 
levels were available. 
 
Statistical analyses 
Associations between dichotomized behavioral subscales (abnormal/borderline vs. normal) as 
outcomes and prenatal urinary pyrethroid metabolite concentrations were examined using multiple 
logistic regression models with the following selection and analysis strategy. Metabolite 
concentrations were categorized as following: if the proportion of non‐detected values (i.e., values 
lower than the limit of detection ‐ LOD) was greater than 50% then two groups were defined (< LOD 
and ≥ LOD); if the proportion of non‐detected values was within the range of 30‐50% then three 
groups were defined (< LOD, and for those with a detectable level, subdivided below and above the 
median); in the remaining situation, concentrations were divided into tertiles.  
The following maternal factors were considered: age at the beginning of pregnancy (continuous), 
place of residence (rural or urban), parity (0 or ≥1), pre‐pregnancy body mass index (≤25 or >25 
kg/m²), education (≤12 or >12 years), WAIS‐III VIQ (continuous), tobacco smoking at the beginning 
of pregnancy (no or yes), usual fish consumption before pregnancy (<2 or ≥2 times a week), length 
of pregnancy (continuous) and breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not (none, ≤16 or >16 weeks). 
The following variables were considered for the 6‐year‐old children: sex, birth weight (continuous), 
education (nursery or primary school), number of siblings at age 6 (continuous), sleep duration 
(<10.5, 10.5‐11 or >11 hours per day), duration of television watching (<2.5, 2.5‐4.5 or >4.5 hours 
per week), duration of video game playing (0, 0‐1.5 or ≥1.5 hours per week), regular extra‐curricular 
sport activities (no, yes) and urinary cotinine concentration measured in the same urine samples as 
the pesticides (<6 or ≥6 µg/L). Finally, several environmental factors and co‐exposures were also 
examined: HOME score when the child was 6 years of age (continuous), acid‐leachable lead in the 
living room (≤1, 1‐3 or >3 µg/m²), number of smokers at home (0, 1 or ≥2), and cigarettes smoked 
at home (0, 0‐10 or >10 per day). The psychologist who administered the psychological tests was 
also investigated as a potential source of measurement errors. To preserve the size of the analytic 
sample, missing values for covariates were replaced by the modal value from participants with non‐
 9 
missing values. Imputation was required for 6 mothers (6 missing data values, i.e., 0.2%) and 14 
children (40 missing data values, i.e., 1.5%). 
We included the child's sex and maternal education in models a priori because they are 
important determinants of children's behavior. Because pyrethroid and organophosphate 
insecticides are frequently encountered in the same environments, and because recent studies 
have provided compelling evidence for an association between prenatal OP insecticide exposure 
and neurodevelopmental deficits,23‐24 potential confounding by OP exposure was considered by 
forcing DE and DM phosphate metabolites in maternal urine samples into the models. For each 
pyrethroid metabolite measured in the prenatal period, the corresponding childhood concentration 
was similarly included in the models to account for its potential competing influence. In addition, 
we included urinary creatinine concentrations (for mothers and children) to account for urinary 
dilution.25 The remaining variables that predicted both the behavioral scores and the pyrethroid 
metabolite levels with p‐value < 0.2 were retained as model covariates. Separate models were used 
to estimate associations with the five pyrethroid metabolites.  
Moreover, a reverse‐scale Cox regression model recently proposed by Dinse et al. was 
performed to handle non‐detected values. In this alternative method, the measured metabolite is 
treated as the modelled outcome, switching the roles of exposure and health effect.26 The method 
begins by reversing the concentration scale and then applying Cox regression analysis with 
adjustment for potential confounders (the same confounding variables that were used in the 
logistic regression‐based approach). The method makes full use of quantifiable metabolite 
measurements and appropriately treats non‐detected values as censored. The corresponding 
hazard ratio parameter is interpretable as an odds ratio (OR), but in a different way from the OR 
obtained in logistic regression models. This OR is the odds of the health outcome at concentration t 
divided by the odds of the health outcome for the aggregate of concentrations below t, assuming 
that this OR is the same across all concentrations. In other words, for 2 children whose scores differ 
by 1 point, it represents the OR for the higher‐scoring child having a given pyrethroid metabolite 
concentration versus all lower concentrations. As this interpretation is not straightforward and 
could cause confusion with logistic regression‐derived ORs, we decided not to report hazard ratio 
parameters but their corresponding p‐values, all the more as associations detected by reverse‐scale 
Cox regression models were always of the same sign as trends indicated by logistic regression 
models. 
 10 
In separate analyses, we explored possible sex‐related differences in the association between 
urinary pyrethroid metabolites and the outcomes of interest by introducing a term for sex * urinary 
concentration into the final models. We set the threshold for statistical significance at p‐value 
< 0.15 for interaction. 
For childhood exposure, we examined the cross‐sectional association of behavioral scores with 
pyrethroid metabolite concentrations using the same confounder selection strategy. The 
metabolite concentration categories slightly differed because the limits were based on childhood 
(and not prenatal) metabolite distributions. Childhood DE and DM concentrations were forced into 
the models. As with prenatal concentrations, childhood pyrethroid metabolite concentrations were 
treated as categorical (logistic regression model) and as continuous (reverse‐scale Cox regression 
model) variables. 
For each outcome of interest, adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated 
from the logistic models. P‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and all tests were 
two‐sided. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (R Development Core Team 
2015).  
 
Ethics statement 
This study was approved by the French Consulting Committee for the Treatment of Information in 
Medical Research (no. 09.485) and by the French National Commission for the Confidentiality of 
Computerized Data (no. 909347). Written informed consent was obtained from each mother. The 
children provided verbal and witnessed assent. 
 
RESULTS 
Description of the population 
Demographic characteristics and lifestyle factors for the 287 mother‐child pairs studied are 
reported in Table 1. At the beginning of their pregnancies, most mothers were greater than 27 
years of age, multiparous, of healthy weight, college graduates and non‐smokers. The 6‐year‐old 
children predominantly attended nursery school, lived in a non‐smoking environment, slept at least 
10.5 hours per day, and participated in regular extra‐curricular sport activities. 
 
 11 
Levels of urinary pyrethroid metabolites 
Table 2 presents the detection frequencies and distributions of the five pyrethroid metabolites 
measured in the maternal and child first‐morning‐void urine samples. Trans‐DCCA, cis‐DBCA and 
cis‐DCCA metabolites were the most frequently detected species in both the mothers (99.9%, 
68.3% and 64.9%, respectively) and the children (96.5%, 85.2% and 64.7%, respectively). Median 
concentrations followed broadly similar patterns. 
Correlation coefficients between pyrethroid metabolites have been fully reported elsewhere.14 
Briefly, coefficients were high in maternal urine for the two DCCA isomers (r = 0.61) and moderate 
for all other metabolite pairs (r ≤ 0.39). A similar pattern was observed in child urine (r = 0.74, and r 
≤ 0.39, respectively). Mother trans‐DCCA concentrations were moderately correlated (r = 0.24) with 
their child counterparts, whereas the remaining four mother pyrethroid metabolite concentrations 
were uncorrelated with their child counterparts (r ≤ 0.04). 
 
Associations between maternal prenatal urinary levels of pyrethroid metabolites and child 
neurobehavioral scores 
Table 3 presents the associations between prenatal pyrethroid metabolite concentrations and SDQ 
scores, after adjusting for potential confounders, urinary creatinine levels, DM and DE prenatal 
concentrations and the corresponding childhood pyrethroid metabolite concentrations. None of 
the ORs differed significantly from unity. Reverse‐scale Cox analyses showed that cis‐DCCA 
concentrations were positively associated with internalizing difficulties (Cox p‐value = 0.05).  
There was an interaction between 3‐PBA and sex for the association with abnormal or borderline 
social behavior (p interaction = 0.11). The inverse association was stronger for girls (OR=0.11, 95% 
CI 0.01 to 1.24) than for boys (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.96), although both associations were not 
statistically significant. 
 
Associations between childhood urinary levels of pyrethroid metabolites and child 
neurobehavioral scores 
Table 4 reports the results for childhood pyrethroid metabolite concentrations. No consistent 
association was found between the internalizing score and any metabolite concentration. For 
childhood 3‐PBA concentrations, a positive association was observed with externalizing difficulties 
 12 
(Cox p‐value = 0.04) and high ORs were found for abnormal or borderline social behavior (OR=2.93, 
95% CI 1.27 to 6.78, and OR=1.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.57 for the intermediate and highest metabolite 
categories ‐ i.e., detectable values, respectively). Increased childhood trans‐DCCA concentrations 
were associated with reduced externalizing disorders (Cox p‐value = 0.03). 
No association differed by sex for any metabolite concentration or any behavioral subscale 
(p interaction > 0.15). 
 
DISCUSSION 
Two substantive findings emerged from this study. First, a positive association was observed 
between prenatal urinary cis‐DCCA concentrations and internalizing difficulties as assessed with 
SDQ scores measured at 6 years of age. Second, we found that childhood exposure to pyrethroid 
insecticides, in general (as reflected by 3‐PBA concentrations in the urine of 6‐year‐old children), 
was associated with increased odds of behavioral disorders for the externalizing and reverse‐scored 
prosocial behavior subscales. The latter results were consistent with the biosocial model of 
externalizing behavior, as externalizing disorders manifest as defiant and disruptive behavior and 
reflect the child negatively acting on the external environment.27 We have no current explanation 
for the counter‐intuitive association observed between childhood high trans‐DCCA concentrations 
and reduced externalizing disorders. We only note that similar inverse associations with SDQ scores 
were reported for prenatal exposure to perfluorinated chemicals.28 Finally, we found little evidence 
of effect modification by sex of the child. 
As reported by Oulhote and Bouchard, several mechanisms could underlie the association 
between pyrethroid insecticides and behavioral disorders in children.10 The increase in sodium 
influx caused by pyrethroid insecticides could affect neuronal synaptic plasticity through 
modulation of the brain derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, exposure to pyrethroid insecticides 
could induce alterations in dopamine transporter function and influence brain microanatomy and 
cholinergic/ dopaminergic neurochemistry. 
The present study has many strengths, including its longitudinal design with pyrethroid exposure 
assessments both prenatally and during childhood, the mental health assessment tool (SDQ), 
extensive information on covariates, and a thorough confounder identification and control strategy. 
The SDQ is a brief screening device for identifying children at high‐risk for mental health problems 
in epidemiologic research. Its reliability has been well documented, and its sensitivity to subtle 
 13 
neurodevelopment changes with environmental exposures has been demonstrated.18 19 28 We 
dichotomized SDQ subscales to denote clinical significance and allow easy interpretation (based on 
ORs). To minimize residual confounding, we deliberately examined or adjusted for numerous risk 
factors, including known predictors of neurodevelopment factors. We also considered information 
about additional environmental neurotoxic exposures from substances such as OP insecticides and 
lead. Participants were representative of the PELAGIE cohort, although highly educated mothers 
were slightly more numerous (68% vs. 62%).15 Moreover, their homogeneous socioeconomic profile 
(rather wealthy families, reflective of the whole cohort) may be observed as strength because it 
reduced the potential for uncontrolled confounding. We used a sound and flexible statistical 
technique to handle biomarker values falling below LODs. The reverse‐scale Cox regression model 
allows full use of the available data, is valid even with extreme LOD censoring, and does not assume 
any parametric distribution.26 It was reassuring that both logistic and reverse‐scale Cox models 
produced fairly consistent results; in our opinion, the latter was more convincing because of its 
quantitative nature. 
Several limitations of this study should be noted. Assessing pyrethroid exposures in urine 
samples is challenging because they are cleared from the body in just a few days, with substantial 
within‐child variability.29 Consequently, pyrethroid metabolites from spot urine samples may not 
represent a child's average exposure over time and may result in misclassification, reducing the 
statistical power to detect associations. An additional concern about urinary biomarkers is that the 
metabolites detected in urine may not be due entirely to exposure to parent compounds, as there 
may also be a minor contribution from exposure to the metabolites themselves in the 
environment.11 Another limitation is that we did not correct for multiple comparisons in these 
exploratory analyses, considering the limited evidence of association between neurodevelopment 
and exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. Moreover, as both maternal and child pyrethroid 
metabolite levels were measured in one batch, we cannot rule out the possibility that a 
degradation of pyrethroid metabolites may have occurred during the years in which the maternal 
urine samples were stored at ‐20°C. Finally, because child metabolite concentrations reflect 
concurrent exposures, the temporal relation with the outcome is unclear; reverse causality 
becomes conceivable as children with behavioral problems (e.g., hyperactivity) might increase their 
exposure to pesticides.10 13  
To our knowledge, only one study had previously assessed the association between postnatal 
pyrethroid exposure and child behavioral development using the SDQ. Some differences between 
 14 
our results and those of Oulhote and Bouchard are worth noting.10 Some differences between the 
two studies. The median concentration of 3‐PBA was lower in French PELAGIE children (0.018 µg/L) 
compared to Canadian children (0.200 µg/L), but cis‐DCCA values were similar in both groups (0.099 
µg/L and 0.05 µg/L, respectively). We considered three SDQ subscales (internalizing, externalizing 
and reverse‐scored prosocial behavior), while Oulhote and Bouchard studied the total difficulties 
and four of the five dimension scales as too few children in their study had high scores on the 
prosocial behavior to estimate association.10 Moreover, only the abnormal category was considered 
as an outcome in the Canadian study (i.e., the borderline and normal categories were aggregated). 
Like Oulhote and Bouchard, we found an interaction between 3‑PBA and sex but for a different 
period of exposure (pregnancy vs. childhood), a different SDQ subscale (prosocial behavior vs. 
conduct disorder), and with opposite effects (boys with higher OR vs. girls with higher OR).  
 
CONCLUSION 
The current study suggests that exposure to certain pyrethroids at the low environmental doses 
encountered by the general public may be associated with behavioral disorders in children. 
Together with our previous report on cognitive disabilities, this study contributes to a broader 
understanding of the potential risk to neurodevelopment from pyrethroid insecticides. Whatever 
their etiology, awareness of neurodevelopmental deficits might be socially and educationally 
meaningful. Identifying the potential causes that can be remediated is, therefore, of paramount 
public health importance.
