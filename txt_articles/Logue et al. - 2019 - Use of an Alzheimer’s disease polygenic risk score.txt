Abstract
Early identification of younger, non-demented adults at elevated risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial because the pathological
process begins decades before dementia onset. Toward that end, we showed that an AD polygenic risk score (PRS) could identify
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in adults who were only in their 50s. Participants were 1176 white, non-Hispanic community-
dwelling men of European ancestry in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA): 7% with amnestic MCI (aMCI); 4% with
non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Mean age was 56 years, with 89% <60 years old. Diagnosis was based on the Jak-Bondi actuarial/
neuropsychological approach. We tested six P-value thresholds (0.05–0.50) for single nucleotide polymorphisms included in the
ADPRS. After controlling for non-independence of twins and non-MCI factors that can affect cognition, higher PRSs were associated
with significantly greater odds of having aMCI than being cognitively normal (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.36–1.43 for thresholds
P < 0.20–0.50). The highest OR for the upper vs. lower quartile of the ADPRS distribution was 3.22. ORs remained significant after
accounting for APOE-related SNPs from the ADPRS or directly genotyped APOE. Diabetes was associated with significantly
increased odds of having naMCI (ORs = 3.10–3.41 for thresholds P < 0.05–0.50), consistent with naMCI having more vascular/
inflammation components than aMCI. Analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values supported some
potential of ADPRSs for selecting participants in clinical trials aimed at early intervention. With participants 15+ years younger than
most MCI samples, these findings are promising with regard to efforts to more effectively treat or slow AD progression.

 Introduction
Because the pathological process in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) begins long before onset of clinical dementia, early
identification of at-risk individuals is of paramount impor-
tance [1–3]. Toward that end, we examined risk prediction
in midlife adults with respect to mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), a transitional phase in the progression from normal
cognition to AD [4, 5]. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s
Project (IGAP) database have identified at least 20 AD
susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance level (P <
5 × 10−8) in older adults of European ancestry [6]. Most [7–
10], but not all [11], samples of older controls and AD cases
have also shown evidence of a significant polygenic com-
ponent of AD based on an AD polygenic risk score
(ADPRS) derived from the IGAP data. Other studies have
shown that higher ADPRSs were associated with greater
abnormalities in endophenotypes such as cortical thickness,
and hippocampal volume [9, 11–15]. Results from two
studies were mixed for beta-amyloid and tau levels [9, 16].
In adults in their 20s, results were also somewhat mixed for
hippocampal volume and memory [9, 17]. We are aware of
two out of three studies showing associations of ADPRSs
with MCI [9, 11, 18].
These results were largely based on cohorts with an
average age in the mid-70s, were generally stronger when
more
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
were
included in the PRS, and usually held up after excluding
APOE. Given the critical importance of early identifica-
tion, further examination of MCI—particularly in rela-
tively younger, non-demented adults—is warranted [1–3].
Here we focused on adults who were cognitively (CN) or
at increased risk for AD because they had MCI. We tested
whether this ADPRS was associated with increased odds
of having MCI in men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of
Aging (VETSA) [19, 20], almost 90% of whom were only
in their 50s.
We used the well-validated, Jak-Bondi actuarial/neu-
ropsychological diagnostic approach [21–30]. We have
argued that a more extensive test battery is essential for
detecting impairment in middle-aged, compared with
older, adults [23, 31]. Thus, employing the Jak-Bondi
approach with our test battery could be particularly useful
because our sample was 16–22 years younger than prior
samples examining MCI and ADPRSs [9, 11]. Over 20%
of healthy older adults have one impaired score in 2 dif-
ferent cognitive domains, but <5% have ≥2 impaired
within a domain [32]. By defining impairment as ≥2 tests
impaired
within
a
cognitive
domain,
the
Jak-Bondi
approach improves the balance between sensitivity and
specificity [21–23]. Compared with clinical diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
participants, Jak-Bondi diagnoses resulted in higher pro-
portions converting to AD, lower proportions reverting to
normal, and higher proportions with abnormal beta-amy-
loid, abnormal tau, and at least one APOE-ε4 allele (the
major AD risk allele) [21]. Elevated ADPRSs in our MCI
group would provide further validation of this diagnostic
approach.
Materials and methods
Participants
There were 1329 men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of
Aging (VETSA) [19, 20] who were determined to be of
white, non-Hispanic European ancestry. As described
elsewhere, we then excluded those with missing data that
would preclude a possible MCI diagnosis, and with condi-
tions that could cause cognitive deficits unrelated to MCI
including seizure disorder, multiple sclerosis, stroke, HIV/
AIDS, schizophrenia, substance dependence, brain cancer,
or dementia [23]. The final sample comprised 1176 parti-
cipants (Fig. 1).
Sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. VETSA
constitutes a national sample comparable to American men
in their age range with respect to health and lifestyle char-
acteristics [33]. All were in some branch of military service
sometime between 1965 and 1975. Nearly 80% report no
combat exposure. VETSA participants had to be 51–59
years old at the time of recruitment in wave 1, and both
twins in a pair had to be willing to participate [19, 20]. Here
we included wave 1 and new wave 2 participants, so that all
were undergoing their initial assessment. In sum, VETSA
constitutes
a
reasonably
representative
sample
of
community-dwelling men in their age range who were not
selected for any characteristic other than age.
Participants chose to go to the University of California,
San Diego or Boston University where they underwent
identical protocols. Brothers almost always chose the same
study site. A small number who could or would not travel to
the study sites were tested in their hometowns. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of parti-
cipating institutions, and all participants gave written
informed consent.
Measures
Neuropsychological function
The test battery was designed to capture the breadth and
depth of cognitive function without having ceiling effects in
a middle-aged sample. Table 2 shows 18 measures covering
6 cognitive domains, as described elsewhere [23, 34].
M. W. Logue et al.
 Health/medical measures
We included health/medical measures as covariates in order
to know if associations with MCI were truly accounted for
by the ADPRS. Depressive symptoms were assessed with
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.
Hypertension was based on measured blood pressure
≥140 systolic or 90 diastolic, having been told by a physi-
cian that the participant had hypertension, or use of medi-
cation for hypertension. Blood pressure was measured with
an automated cuff: twice in the morning and twice in the
afternoon, with each pair of readings separated by 1 min.
Medication information was obtained by a standard “brown
bag” method. Diabetes was assessed if a participant repor-
ted being told by a physician that he had diabetes or if he
was taking medication for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes would
have ruled out entry into the military. History of head injury
was based on a question asking if the person ever had a
serious head injury with loss of consciousness or confusion
during their lifetime. This constitutes a very liberal thresh-
old for head injury.
Definition of MCI
MCI is generally defined as impairment in one or more
cognitive domains, but with functioning generally preserved
[4]. In an early article on MCI, Petersen explained that, in
the absence of prior cognitive test data, subjective cognitive
concern provided a way to infer change from previous
levels to avoid labeling people with lifelong static cognitive
deficits as having MCI [23, 35]. VETSA is, however, one of
a very few studies with actual prior cognitive test data from
a period in life that would be unconfounded by aging-
related changes. At an average age of 20 years, VETSA
participants took the Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT) just prior to their induction into the military. The
AFQT is an index of general cognitive ability that is cor-
related about .85 with Wechsler IQ in the VETSA and other
studies, and had a 42-year test-retest correlation of 0.73 in
VETSA [36, 37]. At VETSA wave 1, 495 individuals had
12 years of education; however, in this subsample with no
educational variability, there was a normal distribution of
AFQT scores. This illustrates the advantage of this direct
measure of “premorbid” cognitive ability over a proxy such
as education.
To account for change from “premorbid” levels, we
adjusted neuropsychological scores for age 20 AFQT
scores. These adjusted scores were then defined as
impaired if they were >1.5 SDs below age- and education-
adjusted normative means. This criterion is stricter than
the more commonly used Jak-Bondi cut-off of >1SD
below normative means [21–23] because we had a
community-based cohort, almost all of whom were in their
50s, which is much younger than MCI samples that typi-
cally average 15–20 years older. Thresholds for defining
impairment often need to be different depending on
expected base rates, and base rates will differ as a function
of factors such as community vs. clinic samples or sample
age [38, 39].
As in prior studies using the Jak-Bondi actuarial/neu-
ropsychological
approach,
impairment
in
a
cognitive
domain was defined as having at least two tests that met the
criterion for impairment [21, 22]. With this criterion, out of
a total of 1176, the diagnoses were as follows: 1050 CN
(89%); 83 aMCI (7%); and 43 non-amnestic MIC (naMCI;
4%). Of those with aMCI, 69 had single-domain aMCI and
14 had multiple-domain aMCI. Of those with naMCI 37 had
single-domain naMCI and 6 had multiple-domain naMCI.
11% of the VETSA sample was diagnosed with MCI, 7%
with aMCI.

GenomeStudio final report files for 1162 participants were
generated and supplied to VETSA investigators for cleaning
and analysis.
SNP cleaning and imputation
Cleaning and quality control of genome-wide genotype data
were performed using PLINK v1.9 [40]. One participant
with more than 5% missing data was excluded. SNPs with
more than 5% missing data or SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium P-values < 10−6 were excluded. Relationships
and zygosity (MZ vs. DZ) were confirmed by estimating the
proportion of the autosomal genome shared identical by
decent using PLINK's genome procedure. Relationships
based on genome-wide genotype data were concordant with
the previously determined relationships derived from the
microsatellite
markers.
As
expected,
analysis
of
X-
chromosome heterozygosity indicated that all samples
were from male participants.
Self-reported
ancestry
was
confirmed
using
both
SNPweights [41] and a principal components (PCs) analysis
performed in PLINK v1.9 in conjunction with 1000 Gen-
omes Phase 3 reference data [42]. Participants of self-
reported European ancestry or with primarily (>50%) Eur-
opean ancestry according to SNPweights (n = 1067) were
analyzed
with
PCs
computed
based
on
a
linkage-
disequilibrium
(LD)-pruned
set
of
100,000
common
(minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) SNPs merged with
the 1000 Genomes reference data. Weights for PCs were
computed based on 1000 Genomes data and then applied to
the VETSA sample. Three participants >6 SDs away from
the 1000 genomes European-decent population (EUR)
mean on either of the first 2 PCs were excluded. PCs were
then recomputed within the remaining putatively white non-
Hispanic (WNH) participants, this time without 1000
Genomes reference data. Weights for PCs were computed
based on a set of unrelated participants (1 individual per
twin pair) and then applied to the whole sample. Within this
set, an additional 8 participants were >6 SDs away from the
WNH mean on the first 10 PCs and were excluded, leaving
1056 genetically confirmed WNH participants: 115 MZ
twin pairs, 264 DZ twin pairs, and 298 individuals whose
twin was not genotyped.
Most of the twins whose co-twin was not genotyped
were from MZ pairs for which only one twin was selected
for genotyping. All of these remaining participants had a
>89% European ancestry as estimated by SNPweights. PCs
for use as covariates to control for population substructure
were recomputed among this WNH set, again based on
100,000 randomly chosen common (MAF > 5%) markers
with weights determined in a set of unrelated participants.
Imputation
was
performed
using
MiniMac
[43,
44]
computed at the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputa
tionserver.sph.umich.edu). The 1000 genomes phase 3 EUR
data were used as a haplotype reference panel. Owing to the
concerns about potential distortion in the haplotype-phasing
step of imputation, only one randomly chosen participant
per genotyped MZ twin pair was submitted for imputation,
and that participant’s resulting imputed data were applied to
his MZ co-twin. See Supplementary text for more details.
The final WNH dataset included 1329 participants,
including 388 MZ twin pairs, 264 DZ pairs, and 25
unpaired twins.
ADPRS calculation
ADPRSs were computed using summary data from the AD
GWAS as presented in Lambert et al. [6]. Individual SNP
effect estimates and P-values were downloaded from http://w
eb.pasteur-lille.fr/en/recherche/u744/igap/igap_download.
php. The ADPRS is a weighted average of VETSA sample
additive imputed SNP dosages with the log-odds ratios (ORs)
for each SNP estimated in the GWAS used as the weights.
Rare SNPs (MAF < 1%) and SNPs with poor imputation
quality (R2 < 0.5) were excluded from ADPRS calculation.
The remaining SNPs were trimmed for LD using PLINK’s
clumping procedure (r2 threshold of 0.2 in a 500 kb window)
based on LD patterns in the 1000 Genomes EUR cohort.
ADPRSs were computed by PLINK v1.9 using six different
P-value thresholds: P < 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50
(see Supplementary text and Supplementary Figure 1 for
details on the choice of these thresholds).
To determine whether or not observed ADPRS associa-
tions were being driven by the APOE locus or were inde-
pendent of APOE, a second version of the ADPRS was
computed that excluded the region of LD surrounding the
APOE
gene
(44,409,039–46,412,650 bp
according
to
GRch37/Feb 2009). The number of SNPs included in
ADPRS calculation and in the “No APOE” ADPRS for each
P-value threshold is presented in Supplementary Table 1.
We also examined the influence of APOE-ε4 and APOE-ε2
measured by direct genotyping (method described pre-
viously [45]).
Statistical analysis
We performed mixed effects logistic regression analyses to
examine the ability of standardized ADPRSs to predict
group membership using SAS PROC GLIMMIX [46]. The
unit
of
analysis
was
the
individual,
and
the
non-
independence within twin pairs was accounted for in these
mixed models. In order to obtain more accurate parameter
estimates, we used the METHOD = QUAD statement. This
statement performs maximum likelihood estimation by
adaptive Gauss–Hermite quadrature.
Use of an Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk score to identify mild cognitive impairment…
 All analyses adjusted for the first three PCs to account for
any cryptic population substructure [47–49]. We also
adjusted for the following factors that may affect cognitive
function: age; depressive symptoms; hypertension; type 2
diabetes; and history of head injury. We tested six P-value
thresholds (0.05–0.50) for SNPs included in the ADPRS.
Analyses included Type III (unique) effects of predictor
variables.
The ADPRSs computed at the different levels were very
highly correlated (pairwise rs = 0.81–0.99), making Bon-
ferroni correction for six different tests highly conservative.
We used the Li and Ji method [50] to estimate the effective
number of tests = 2. Hence, we used a P-value cut-off of
0.025 two-tailed for multiple-testing significance.
To test for incremental value of the ADPRS, we com-
pared model-fit as we added predictors. We then calculated
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and
negative predictive values (NPV) for the best-fitting model
with the ROCR package in R v3.3.2 [51]. We focused on
two optimal cut-points: (1) the probability at which the sum
of sensitivity and specificity were weighted most equally;
and (2) the probability that minimizes cost of mis-
classifications (PPV and NPV weighted most equally).
These were also the probabilities at which both pairs were
highest. The area under the curve (AUC) and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve plot was calculated
with the R package pROC. The 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated for the AUC using a stratified bootstrap
with 2000 replicates.
Results
As seen in Table 1, the CN, aMCI, and naMCI groups did
not differ with respect to age, depressive symptoms,
hypertension, or history of head injury. There were very
small but significant differences in young adult/premorbid
general cognitive ability (AFQT), and in education. The
naMCI group had 0.7 years less education than the aMCI
and 1.2 years less than the CN group. The mean AFQT
score for the VETSA cohort was above the average of 50th
percentile because individuals who scored below the 10th
percentile were not admitted for military service. The
highest mean percentile score (65.7) was in the aMCI
group, followed by the CN group (62.2), and then the
naMCI group (59.2). These are approximately equivalent to
IQs ranging from 106 to 111 across the three groups.
Current AFQT scores were uncorrelated with the ADPRS
(rs = −0.040 to −0.064, Ps = 0.222 to 0.064 at different
thresholds). The proportion of individuals with type 2 dia-
betes also differed significantly among the three groups.
The prevalence was similar in the CN and aMCI groups
(10.6% and 12.1%, respectively). It was more than double

 those levels in the naMCI group, with 25.6% of this group
having diabetes.
After multiple-testing correction, higher ADPRSs were
associated with significantly greater odds of being in the
aMCI group than in the CN group (ORs estimated for 1SD
increase in ADPRS: range = 1.363–1.427 for ADPRS
thresholds of P < 0.20–0.50) (Table 3a). Results were
essentially unchanged in a model with the first 10 PCs
(Supplementary Table 2). For the most significant threshold,
P < 0.50, the odds of having aMCI were 3.215 times greater
(95% CI: 1.392; 7.424) for those in the upper vs. the lower
quartile of the ADPRS distribution (Table 3b). ORs for
naMCI vs. CN groups were only slightly lower than those
for aMCI, but they were nonsignificant (Table 3c), probably
due to lower power given the smaller size of the naMCI
group. ORs were significant but slightly lower for the
combined MCI groups vs. the CN group (not shown).
After excluding SNPs within the APOE-region, the
ADPRS still significantly differentiated aMCI and CN
groups (ORs estimated for 1SD increase in ADPRS: range
= 1.397–1.419 for ADPRS thresholds of P < 0.30–0.50)
(Table 3d). In models including genotyped APOE-ε4 and
APOE-ε2, the highest magnitude ORs for APOE-ε4 and
APOE-ε2 were 1.437 and 0.515, respectively, but none of
these were statistically significant. After adjusting for
APOE-ε4 and APOE-ε2, the ADPRS remained significantly
associated with increased odds of being in the aMCI group
(range = 1.387–1.408
for
thresholds
of
P < 0.30–0.50)
(Table 4). In contrast to aMCI, diabetes was associated with
significantly increased odds of having naMCI (ORs esti-
mated for 1SD increase in ADPRS: range = 3.103–3.341
for ADPRS thresholds of P < 0.05–0.50) (Table 5). None of
the other covariates was associated with increased odds of
either aMCI or naMCI. An additional ADPRS comprising
only the 19 AD risk genes (excluding APOE) previously
identified at genome-wide significance level [6] was not
correlated with our ADPRS, nor was it associated with
increased odds of MCI (Supplementary Table 3).
The best-fitting model (Table 6, Model 4) shows that the
ADPRS provided a significant improvement in prediction
beyond age, risk factors for AD (covariates), and APOE
genotype. For the best-fitting model, the AUC was 0.955
(95% CI: 0.93; 0.97) (Supplementary Figure 2). When the
cut-off was selected for high and balanced sensitivity
(0.910) and specificity (0.886), NPV was high (0.992) and
PPV was modest (0.376). When cut-offs resulted in high
and balanced NPV (0.953) and PPV (0.737), specificity was
very high (0.990), and sensitivity was modest (0.359).
Discussion
We demonstrated the ability of ADPRSs to differentiate
individuals with MCI from those who are CN in a
community-dwelling sample of men, 89% of whom were
only in their 50s. With the average age of this sample being
16–22 years younger than other studies of MCI to date, our
results hold promise for early identification of increased risk
for AD. Consistent with results in older adults [9, 18], the
full ADPRS differentiated groups far better than the 19
genome-wide significant SNPs. Also, as described in the
introduction, our use of the Jak-Bondi approach [21] might
be more sensitive for diagnosing MCI than traditional
approaches.
The ADPRS did significantly improve model-fit when
added to a model with age, covariates, and APOE genotype.
The best-fitting model had a very high AUC, but AUCs
have been shown to be misleading and are problematic as
comparative measures across studies [52]. In the most
comparable study, the Rotterdam Study of older adults, the
prevalence of aMCI was 4% and the AUC was 0.592
(sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were not presented).

aMCI amnestic mild cognitive impairment
Use of an Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk score to identify mild cognitive impairment…
 Here again, cross-study differences could be due to different
ADPRSs and/or different approaches to diagnosis. Despite
our high AUC, we focus on more informative indices. A
threshold with high and balanced sensitive and specificity
resulted in high NPV and modest PPV, which may be useful
for screening individuals to be referred for further evalua-
tion because people classified as controls would be highly
likely to be true controls even though aMCI classifications
would include increased false positives. A threshold with
high and balanced NPV and PPV resulted in high specificity
and modest sensitivity. Thus, aMCI cases would be missed
but false positives for aMCI would be reduced substantially.
This threshold may be useful for clinical trials by providing
greater certainty that cases are truly cases.
With a male-only sample, we cannot know how our
results might generalize to women. Women are at higher
lifetime risk of AD than men, the APOE-ε4 allele confers
greater risk in women, and postmortem studies indicate
female excesses of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles and greater cognitive deficit per unit of brain amy-
loid [53]. Differentiating MCI and CN groups may thus be
more difficult in men, yet we were able to do so in this
relatively young cohort. APOE effects are somewhat weaker
in men than in women, and may not yet be prominent in the
relatively young age range of our cohort [54, 55]. However,
as in most other studies of older adults [7–10, 13–15], the
ADPRS retained predictive value after controlling for or
removing APOE.
Male excesses of cerebrovascular pathologies have been
associated with AD [53]. Diabetes increases risk for all-
cause dementia, but that relationship may be stronger for
vascular dementia than for AD [56]. Here diabetes—a
cardiovascular-related
condition—was
associated
with
increased risk of naMCI, consistent with naMCI having
more of a vascular component than aMCI. Although the
ORs for the ADPRS did not suggest that aMCI is sub-
stantially more AD-related than naMCI, the different dia-
betes results do support the value of separately analyzing
these MCI subtypes. Also, the most common deficits in the
naMCI group were executive-attention deficits. Thus, our
results are also consistent with findings that memory deficits
are typically the prominent cognitive deficit in AD; yet there
is also a significant proportion of AD patients who most
prominently manifest a dysexecutive syndrome [57].
In conclusion, we view the young age of the sample as
critically important. The results provide proof of principle
for the value of ADPRSs to aid in identifying genetically at-
risk individuals with MCI as early as the sixth decade of
life, and they provide additional validation of the actuarial-
neuropsychological approach to diagnosing MCI. The
findings thus support the idea that ADPRSs can aid in
predicting who will develop AD many years before they
manifest any symptoms, although it must be acknowledged
that we do not know which participants will, in fact,
develop AD. It does, however, seem likely that the findings
represent an AD-related phenomenon and not simply gen-
eral cognitive ability because our MCI diagnosis included
adjustment for age 20 AFQT scores and-- consistent with

 prior research [58]--the ADPRS and AFQT were not sig-
nificantly correlated. ADPRSs may also be a useful addi-
tional tool for targeting individuals for clinical trials and
individuals requiring clinical intervention at an earlier
stage than is currently thought to be feasible. Such efforts at
early identification and intervention are likely to be key
factors for more effectively treating or slowing the pro-
gression of AD.
