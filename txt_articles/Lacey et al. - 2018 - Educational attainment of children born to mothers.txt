Abstract 
Objective 
Small prospective studies have identified that children exposed to valproate in utero have poorer 
scores on cognitive testing. We wanted to identify whether children exposed to antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs) in utero have poorer school performance. 
Methods 
We used anonymized, linked, routinely-collected healthcare records to identify children born to 
mothers with epilepsy. We linked these children to their national attainment Key-Stage 1 (KS1) tests 
in mathematics, language and science at the age of seven and compared them to matched-children 
born to mothers without epilepsy, and to the national KS1 results. We used the core subject indicator 
(CSI) as an outcome measure (the proportion of children achieving a minimum standard in all subjects) 
and the results in individual subjects. 
Results 
We identified 440 children born to mothers with epilepsy with available KS1 results. Compared to a 
matched control group, fewer children with mothers being prescribed sodium valproate during 
pregnancy achieved the national minimum standard in core subject indicator by (-12.7% less than the 
control group), mathematics (-12.1%), language (-10.4%) and in science (-12.2%).  Even fewer children 
with mothers being prescribed multiple AEDs during pregnancy achieved a national minimum 
standard: core subject indicator by (-20.7% less than the control group), mathematics (-21.9%), 
language (-19.3%), and science (-19.4%). We did not observe any significant difference in children 
whose mothers were prescribed carbamazepine or were not taking an AED when compared to the 
control group. 
Conclusions  
  
 
In utero exposure to AEDs in combination, or sodium valproate alone, are associated with a significant 
decrease in attainment in national educational tests for seven-year-old children compared to both a 
matched control group and the all-Wales national average. These results give further support to the 
cognitive and developmental effects of in utero exposure to sodium valproate as well as multiple AEDs, 
which should be balanced against the need for effective seizure control for women during pregnancy.

Introduction 
Valproate is the most effective drug for treating genetic generalized epilepsy,1 but recent prospective 
psychometric studies have demonstrated cognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental disorders in 
30–40% of children exposed to valproate in utero,2,3 as well as a significant decrease in intelligence 
quotient(IQ).4,5 Women with epilepsy who have satisfactory control with valproate and are planning a 
family therefore have a difficult decision to make. 
In the United Kingdom the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), issued 
stringent guidance for all clinicians prescribing valproate to women of child-bearing potential in 2015. 
This guidance was updated in 2017 based on evidence that women are still not aware of the risks of 
taking valproate during pregnancy.6 An International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task force made 
seven recommendations, the first of which is “Where possible, valproate should be avoided in women 
of childbearing potential.” Women with epilepsy who are taking AEDs are presently advised to 
continue them throughout pregnancy, primarily because of the risks of convulsive seizures to the 
mother and her unborn child.   
To be able to counsel mothers adequately about the risks of uncontrolled seizures during pregnancy 
and cognitive outcomes for their children, it is important to know whether the psychometric 
differences demonstrated in research conditions translate to children in the community. We aim to 
investigate the effect of AED exposure in utero on the educational attainment of children born to 
mothers with epilepsy using anonymized, routinely-collected healthcare records and the results of a 
standard national educational assessment.  
 
Methods 
Cohort Selection 
  
 
We used the Secure Anonymous Information Linkage databank (SAIL)7,8 to access routinely-collected 
healthcare records and identify women who had been diagnosed with epilepsy before becoming 
pregnant. All studies using SAIL data need independent Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP) 
approval. This study obtained IGRP approval ref 0228. The Research Ethics Service has previously 
confirmed that SAIL projects using anonymised routinely collected data do not need require specific 
NHS research ethics committee approval.  
In Wales, every individual is assigned a National Health Service general practitioner (GP). SAIL currently 
contains primary care records for 80% of Welsh GPs corresponding to 77% of the Welsh population 
(approximately 2.3 million people). GPs provide primary health care, prescribe medication, and 
maintain health records for individuals. GPs will prescribe AEDs for people with epilepsy in almost all 
cases, but the current standard of care is that everyone with a suspected seizure is first seen by a 
'specialist' (neurologist or epileptologist) within two weeks of their first event. 9-10 Medication is first 
prescribed by the specialist at or following this visit. A letter with details of the diagnosis and AED 
prescription is subsequently sent to the patient’s GP.  
We defined a person as having a diagnosis of epilepsy if their GP record contained an epilepsy 
diagnosis code as well as a record of repeat AED prescriptions. 11–14 Currently seizure type, seizure 
frequency, and AED daily doses are not accurately available from the datasets held within SAIL.   
Educational assessment in England and Wales 
Between 1999 and 2011, children in Wales were assessed over five Key Stages (KS) between 7 and 16 
years of age. These tests were a national measure of educational achievement children in Wales and 
therefore provide a standardized measure of educational attainment. Every child is tested in 
mathematics, language (English or Welsh) and science and is awarded a level between 1 (lowest) and 
3 (highest). In certain circumstances children may obtain an unclassified or “working towards” 
meaning that they do not achieve the required grade to pass the year. KS1 assessment takes place at 
  
 
the age of 7 years. The core subject indicator (CSI) is defined as the proportion of children achieving a 
minimum standard in all three KS1 subjects, that being a level 2 or higher in each subject.  
In 2011, in Wales, the KS1 system for 5–7 year olds was combined with the Early Years assessment for 
children between 3–5 years of age and is now called the Foundation Phase to assess children between 
the ages of 3–7 years of age. Key Stage 1 for 5–7 year olds was not combined with earlier years in 
England, and is still used as a standard test.  We were able to obtain a subset of results from the Welsh 
Government in the pre-2011 phase to assess the educational achievement of children in KS1 born to 
mothers with epilepsy. For these children, we linked data from the Department for 
Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills (DCELLS) dataset and their corresponding 2003–2008 
KS1 results to their birth records and their mothers’ GP records in the SAIL Databank.15  
Education Data Ascertainment  
Given that KS1 results (taken at the age of 7) were only available within SAIL for the years 2003–2008 
at the time of this study, we searched for women with epilepsy who gave birth between 1996 and 
2001 and had children who had KS1 results which were accessible within SAIL. We divided the mothers 
into groups based on the AED that they were prescribed during pregnancy (including those that were 
not prescribed an AED) and created a control group (with 4:1 matching) matched for maternal age, 
week of gestational age, and deprivation at the time of birth. We used the Welsh Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (WIMD) as a measure of deprivation.13 Information on any additional learning support 
that individual children may have had was not available. 
Statistical Analyses  
We used R version 3.2.0 to conduct the statistical analyses. We used a Chi-square significance test to 
compare the KS1 results of each group and performed a conservative Bonferroni correction using the 
“p.adjust ()” function that multiplies the raw p-value by the number of independent tests, and 
calculated confidence limits using the “summaryCE ()” function from the Rmisc package. 
  
 
 
Results 
Cohort profile 
We identified 440 children with KS1 results available between 2003 and 2008 who had mothers with 
epilepsy diagnosed before their pregnancy and had GP records within SAIL. We defined five groups of 
mothers prescribed the following AEDs: monotherapy with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or sodium 
valproate, multiple AEDs as well as no AED prescription (see Table 1). 20 of the 39 mothers (54%) in 
the polytherapy group were prescribed sodium valproate as one of their AEDs. Further details on the 
15 different combinations of AEDs prescribed in the polytherapy group can be seen in Tables 2 and 3. 
The numbers for the polytherapy combinations are small, we therefore did not perform any analysis 
on these sub-groups, but present results for the polytherapy group as a whole. We did however 
analyse educational attainment in the polytherapy group when split into those on polytherapy 
treatment with sodium valproate and those on polytherapy treatment without sodium valproate, but 
we found no significant difference between these two groups across any attainment indicator (please 
see Table 4). 
Reference data for the control variables (gestational age, maternal age and WIMD score) in each group 
are reported in table 1. There was no significant difference in the mean of these variables when 
compared to controls. We have included results for all children in Wales in table 1 to provide context 
to the KS1 results. Since we have prescription data only we are unable to comment on AED adherence, 
but we do not expect adherence to differ across different AED prescriptions. The proportion of 
children in each group achieving at least a level 2 in each subject is shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
  
 
Figure 1 – Key Stage 1 results stratified by subject and study groups. Each group was compared to 
the matched control group. Significant differences in attainment (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005) between 
each group and the matched control are shown. The p-values have been Bonferroni corrected for 
multiple testing (see Methods section). The All Wales group is shown as a regional comparator only 
and not used to test for significance.
  
 
Children born to mothers with epilepsy being prescribed sodium valproate during pregnancy have a lower 
level of achievement in KS1 tests across all indicators other than language. Fewer children exposed to 
sodium valproate in utero achieve the minimum standard when compared to the matched control group 
by: CSI = -12.7% (p=0.035) less than the control group, mathematics = -12.1% (p=0.011), language = -10.4% 
(p=0.188) and science = -12.2% (p<=0.004) (p-values are Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing – see 
Methods section). Children born to mothers with epilepsy being prescribed multiple AEDs during 
pregnancy also have a lower level of achievement across all indicators other than language when 
compared to the matched control group by: CSI = -20.7% (p=0.042) less than the matched control group, 
mathematics = -21.9% (p=<0.007), language = -19.3%(p=0.269) and science = -19.4% (p=0.010) (p-values 
are Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing – see Methods section). We did not find a significant 
decrease in attainment in children born to mothers with epilepsy that were not prescribed an AED during 
pregnancy. Excluding children with epilepsy and mothers who were recorded as smoking during 
pregnancy did not change the results in terms of significant results. 
 
Discussion 
We demonstrate through the analysis of linked data in the SAIL databank that mothers being prescribed 
multiple AEDs and those being prescribed sodium valproate have children with significantly poorer 
attainment in national tests at the age of seven. In contrast there was no difference seen in children 
exposed to carbamazepine, lamotrigine or mothers that did not take drugs during pregnancy, however 
we note that the sample size for the lamotrigine group is small. Our findings support previous studies that 
provide consistent evidence that in utero exposure to sodium valproate and AEDs in combination are 
linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers not prescribed any drug during pregnancy do 
not appear to give birth to children that have decreased educational attainment as compared to the 
  
 
control group. This might be expected given both groups are not exposed to AEDs. It is also possible that 
the mothers with epilepsy not taking AEDs have less frequent seizures, thus reducing the risks to the 
unborn child associated with exposure to maternal seizures.16 We acknowledge factors such as parental 
intelligence quotient (IQ) and social and behavioral issues can also have an effect on educational outcome, 
and so must be taken into context with the results presented in this study.  
The strength of this study is the ability to select a large cohort of 440 children with national test results 
without major recruitment bias and compare to a large control group. We created a control cohort 
matched on maternal age, gestational age and socioeconomic deprivation, but we were unable to control 
for maternal body weight at time of pregnancy. The children born to mothers with epilepsy in this study 
have an increased deprivation score when compared to Welsh children as a whole, as is expected given 
the association with epilepsy and deprivation. 14 Using a standardized national assessment as a measure 
of performance ensures that each child has the opportunity to be assessed based on the same curriculum, 
and as such these results would closer reflect the learning experience of children at this age compared to 
an IQ test.  
The main limitation of this study is not being able to use maternal IQ, as well as other maternal factors 
such as maternal weight or alcohol consumption during pregnancy, as covariates. 4,5 Children born to 
mothers with epilepsy may have other conditions which affect their ability to perform in the KS1 tests and 
we have not specifically looked for these although we have recorded the number of children with epilepsy. 
We have been unable to account for parental style and/or ability in this study which may influence 
educational attainment. It is also possible that mothers with poorly controlled seizures may have an effect 
on their child’s education in terms of parental support outside of school settings, but this information is 
difficult to ascertain and is not available to any comprehensive standard within the SAIL databank. 
  
 
Another limitation of this study is that we are unable to report on AED dosage, although other studies 
have reported significant cognitive impairment even at low dosages of sodium valproate. 
It is possible that the mothers prescribed sodium valproate as well as those prescribed multiple AEDs have 
more severe epilepsy and this may explain the difference in KS1 results. We are currently unable to 
measure seizure frequency / epilepsy severity, identify epilepsy type, or ascertain alcohol and illicit drug 
use accurately from SAIL data. Another factor that could have influenced educational attainment is the 
lack of preconception/perinatal folic acid prescription, which we were not available to ascertain 
accurately, as this is available without prescription and frequently taken ‘over the counter’.  
Although our cohort is large, we do not have sufficient outcomes to look at other AEDs, or to look at 
different AED combinations in detail. We were not able to report any results for drugs, such as 
levetiracetam, introduced after the window for pregnancy (1996–2001) that we used in this study. This 
time period was limited by the period that KS1 results were available within SAIL (2003–2008). 
Our results support the evidence of many independent studies that have reported cognitive impairment 
of children exposed to sodium valproate in utero. The NEAD study found a 9-point decrease in IQ in 
children at three and six years old who were born to mothers taking sodium valproate during pregnancy4,5 
as well as decreased motor, emotional and behavioral/adaptive functioning in children at three years 
old.17 Studies based on the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register have found an association between 
sodium valproate and a decrease in cognitive development with early cognitive delay that suggests 
children are at a disadvantage well before school age.18-19 While this study finds a statistically non-
significant trend in language at KS1, other studies have shown decreased language and verbal skills at an 
early infant stage.20-22  
  
 
Previous studies have found an association with carbamazepine exposure and cognitive impairment, there 
are other studies have found no association between carbamazepine exposure and cognitive impairment; 
our study supports the latter with no evidence of decreased educational attainment at school age.23 
While this study highlights the risk of cognitive effects in the children of mothers prescribed sodium 
valproate or multiple AEDs, it is important to acknowledge that some epilepsies are difficult to treat 
without these treatment regimes. Despite this, our results add to the growing evidence that in utero 
exposure to certain AEDs can cause developmental problems in children. Women with epilepsy should be 
informed of this risk and alternative treatment regimens should be discussed before their pregnancy with 
a physician that specializes in epilepsy.
