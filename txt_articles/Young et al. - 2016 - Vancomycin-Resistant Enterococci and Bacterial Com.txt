ABSTRACT
Sewage spills can release antibiotic-resistant bacteria into surface waters, contributing to environmental reservoirs and poten-
tially impacting human health. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are nosocomial pathogens that have been detected in
environmental habitats, including soil, water, and beach sands, as well as wildlife feces. However, VRE harboring vanA genes
that confer high-level resistance have infrequently been found outside clinical settings in the United States. This study found
culturable Enterococcus faecium harboring the vanA gene in water and sediment for up to 3 days after a sewage spill, and the
quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal for vanA persisted for an additional week. Culturable levels of enterococci in water exceeded
recreational water guidelines for 2 weeks following the spill, declining about five orders of magnitude in sediments and two or-
ders of magnitude in the water column over 6 weeks. Analysis of bacterial taxa via 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed changes in
community structure through time following the sewage spill in sediment and water. The spread of opportunistic pathogens har-
boring high-level vancomycin resistance genes beyond hospitals and into the broader community and associated habitats is a
potential threat to public health, requiring further studies that examine the persistence, occurrence, and survival of VRE in dif-
ferent environmental matrices.
IMPORTANCE
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are harmful bacteria that are resistant to the powerful antibiotic vancomycin, which is
used as a last resort against many infections. This study followed the release of VRE in a major sewage spill and their persistence
over time. Such events can act as a means of spreading vancomycin-resistant bacteria in the environment, which can eventually
impact human health.
A
ntibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) are a growing public health
threat and an economic burden globally. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has
placed a high priority on addressing antibiotic resistance because
of rising rates of ARB infection and associated disease burden and
health care costs (1, 2). Most infections caused by ARB are noso-
comial transmissions (i.e., originating in a hospital), but the role
of environmental reservoirs in spreading ARB outside clinical set-
tings is poorly understood. Studies have emphasized the role of
environmental reservoirs in the spread of antibiotic resistance for
decades, but more field and laboratory studies are necessary to
address the specific mechanisms and conditions under which ARB
survive and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) persist or can be
transferred (3–5). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are
sources of ARB, ARGs, and antimicrobial compounds through
both treated effluent and the unplanned release of raw sewage to
surface waters (6–9). ARB, ARGs, and antibiotics can be released
into aquatic environments through human and agricultural
waste, establishing routes of human exposure and threats to eco-
system health.
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is used to treat
infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is considered a
drug of last resort because of its historical success with the most
recalcitrant infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (10, 11).
When vancomycin is rendered ineffective (i.e., when target bacte-
ria are resistant), therapeutic treatment may fail and infections
can be fatal (12, 13). Intrinsic, low-level resistance to vancomycin
is characteristic of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gal-
linarum but is of less clinical concern than acquired, high-level
vancomycin resistance (�32 �g · ml�1) (14). Acquired vancomy-
cin resistance can occur through the transfer of mobilizable ge-
netic elements (15–17). Nine genes that confer vancomycin resis-
tance in enterococci have been described, eight of which can be
acquired (18). The most concerning from a public health perspec-
tive is the vanA gene, which is linked to most infections with hu-
man vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). vanA is usually
carried on a plasmid-borne transposon (Tn1546) (19–21) and
confers high-level resistance to vancomycin (�64 �g · ml�1) (22).
The use of the glycopeptide avoparcin in animal agriculture in
Europe has been linked to clinical vancomycin resistance (23–25).
Although glycopeptides have not been used in animals in the
United States, clinical incidence of VRE has steadily increased in
past decades (2, 18, 26–29). Detection of VRE in the United States

 has been predominantly in clinical cases and hospital sewage (30,
31). The monitoring of VRE and associated resistance genes out-
side the hospital setting is necessary to better understand the
spread of resistance and the increased risk to public health (6).
Previous studies in Europe and Australia have reported com-
munity spread of VRE and fecal colonization of nonhospital-
ized individuals, but this has not been shown in the United
States (32–35).
Antibiotic resistance can spread in bacterial habitats in the ex-
ternal environment, where antibiotics, ARB, and ARG enter water
and sediments (6). The influx of sewage-associated microbes and
other allochthonous bacteria into an aquatic environment can
have ecological impacts, affecting community structure, nutrient
cycling, and other ecosystem processes (36–38). In addition, the
dynamics of gene exchange in microbial communities can be al-
tered, and transfer of resistance genes may occur (39, 40). VRE
and vancomycin resistance genes have been detected globally in
the feces of agricultural and wild animals (30, 41–44), surface
waters (45–47), WWTPs (48), domestic (community) sewage
(49), and hospital sewage (30, 46, 50). Clinically relevant strains
and vanA genes have rarely been reported in the environment in
the United States (51, 52). The prevalence of genes encoding van-
comycin resistance in the environment may increase the fre-
quency of transfer to other Gram-positive pathogens (53), includ-
ing the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (54). The
incidence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) in hospitals is
low; however, 13 incidences have been reported in the United
States as of 2014 (55), and the emerging threat is a concern for
public health.
Relatively little information is available about the prevalence of
clinically relevant VRE and vanA genes in aquatic environments,
but many studies that have attempted to detect them have failed to
find them in relatively pristine environments. Studies around the
world have infrequently and inconsistently detected vanA genes
and Enterococcus species isolates with vanA phenotypes in WWTP
effluent and surface waters (56–59). One study in the United
States isolated Enterococcus faecium carrying vanA genes on a rec-
reational marine beach in Washington (52), but no other confir-
mation has been established outside hospital settings. In this field
study, culturable VRE and/or vanA genes were detected in sedi-
ment and water samples after a sewage spill released more than
500,000 gallons of untreated sewage in a residential neighbor-
hood. Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) of environ-
mental DNA from sediment and water revealed the temporal
changes in the microbial community after a major influx of un-
treated sewage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. A sewer line break in Pinellas County, FL, released
more than 500,000 gallons of untreated sewage into a neighborhood
drainage ditch beginning 27 September 2014. The line break was repaired
with a bypass valve on 30 September 2014 after the sewage leakage was
diverted. The site was also washed down, vacuumed, and disinfected with
lime. A well-point system was also installed at the site to dewater, which
resulted in groundwater discharge. Well-point systems are commonly
used in engineering and construction and consist of a series of vacuum
pumps designed to draw water up out of the ground. The ditch is con-
nected to estuarine waters through wetlands. Photos of the site are in-
cluded in Fig. S3A and B in the supplemental material. Water and sedi-
ment samples were collected at the spill site, along the drainage ditch for a
distance of 800 m, and in adjacent receiving waters. Samples were col-
lected seven times over the course of 7 weeks after the spill (1 October 2014
to 21 November 2014), to determine the persistence of sewage-associated
microbes and VRE in the environment.
Six sites (NC-01, NC-02, NC-03, NC-04, NC-05, and NC-06) were
selected for spatial assessment, but the majority of reported results are
limited to one site that was sampled on all dates, NC-03. The additional
sites where early sampling occurred are noted in the maps provided in Fig.
S1 in the supplemental material. Site NC-01 became inaccessible after the
first 2 weeks of sampling because it was filled in by construction crews. We
were not able to collect sediment at the boat ramp in any instance because
the site was a dock surrounded by mangroves. The boat ramp was in-
cluded to represent recreational waters that may have been impacted by
the spill. Water samples were collected in 500-ml sterile containers. Sedi-
ment samples were collected using a 50-ml sterile, screw-cap tube to scoop
up the top 1 to 2 cm of sediments. All samples were transported on ice to
the laboratory and processed within 6 h. Enterococci were also quantified
by the Pinellas County Water and Sewer Department staff at 16 sites (see
Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material) near the point of the line
break for 12 days using standard methods (ASTM D6503-99).
Isolation of and confirmation of VRE. Water and sediment samples
were processed using membrane filtration according to U.S. Environmen-
tal Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1600 for culturable enterococci (60),
with modifications for the detection of VRE. Water samples were pro-
cessed in multiple volumes (1 to 300 ml) on each sampling date over the
course of the sampling period to account for variability in enterococcal
concentrations. Vancomycin stock solution was prepared as an aqueous
solution from sodium salt (Acros Organics/Thermo Fisher Scientific, NJ,
USA) and sterile nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 10 mg ·
ml�1 and filter sterilized. To detect culturable VRE, Enterococcus indoxyl-
�-D-glucoside (mEI) agar (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was prepared
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After the medium
cooled to 55°C, the vancomycin solution was added to a final concentra-
tion of 32 �g · ml�1, the breakpoint for full resistance (14, 61). Sediment
samples (30 g wet weight) were diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and hand shaken for 2 min to detach bacteria from particles (62).
Sediment samples of the diluted buffered solution were processed in vol-
umes from 0.1 to 100 ml depending on the sampling date and on previous
concentrations of enterococci. Multiple dilutions for water and sediment
were processed on each date to obtain viable colony counts.
To confirm culturable VRE as enterococci harboring the vanA gene,
colonies with blue halos that grew on vancomycin-amended mEI were
transferred to enterococcosel broth (EB) using sterile pipet tips or sterile
toothpicks and were grown for 24 h. Wells that turned black were streaked
for isolation onto tryptic soy agar (TSA) (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD)
and then isolated again onto vancomycin-amended mEI (32 �g · ml�1).
Isolated colonies were grown overnight in 5 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) broth
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) that was amended with 32 �g ·
ml�1 vancomycin. DNA was extracted from overnight cultures using a
GenElute bacterial genomic DNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Nucleic acid concentration was measured using a NanoDrop spectropho-
tometer to confirm successful extraction, and DNA was stored at �20°C
in aliquots. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out with an Applied
Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system to confirm isolates as Enterococcus
spp. (63) carrying the vanA gene (64). Isolates were identified to the spe-
cies level by DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using universal bac-
terial primers (8F, 1492R) to amplify the 16S rRNA (65, 66); the PCR
product was then purified using a GeneJet PCR purification kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), sequenced by Eurofins Genomics
(Huntsville, AL), and identified to the genus and species levels by using
BLAST to reference the GenBank database (NCBI).
Sequencing and molecular analysis of environmental DNA. Water
(500 ml) was also filtered to obtain environmental DNA, and filters were
stored at �80°C for DNA extraction. Sediment samples were also stored
for DNA extraction. DNA from environmental water and samples was
extracted and purified using the Mo Bio PowerWater kit from 0.45-�m

 filters. DNA from environmental sediment samples was extracted using
Mo Bio PowerSoil kits directly from 0.3-g samples of sediment (Mo Bio
Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). Bacterial communities in those samples
were characterized by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
PCR was carried out to amplify the V4 region with the 515F and 806R
primer pair, which included sequencer adapter sequences for Illumina
sequencing (67, 68). The forward primer also contained a 12-bp barcode
sequence unique to each sample. Each 25-�l PCR mixture contained 12 �l
of PCR Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10 �l of 2.5� 5
Prime HotMasterMix (Gaithersburg, MD), 1 �l of each of the primers (5
�M), and 1 �l of template DNA. The conditions for PCR were as follows:
94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 90 s,
and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Amplicons were quantified using
PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader (Infinite 200 Pro; Tecan) and
were then pooled in equimolar ratios. This pool was cleaned using the
UltraClean PCR clean-up kit (Mo Bio) and sequenced in an Illumina
MiSeq run (2 � 150 bp) at Argonne National Laboratory. Sequencing
reads were processed using QIIME (69) and USEARCH (70). The forward
and reverse reads were merged, and then the merged reads were demulti-
plexed and filtered with a minimum Phred quality score of 20. Filtering
resulted in about 388,000 high-quality reads, averaging about 28,000
reads per sample. Those reads were then clustered into 1,685 operational
taxonomical units (OTUs) with a 97% similarity threshold. Chimeric se-
quences were identified with UCHIME and removed from OTUs (71).
The taxonomy of the OTUs was assigned an RDP classifier against the
SILVA databases (72, 73). For all downstream analyses, 10,000 reads were
randomly selected per sample to correct for differences in sequencing
depth.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out with an Applied Biosystems
7500 real-time PCR system based on a previously published protocol for
the vanA gene (64). Targets in environmental DNA were amplified using
the following master mix composition per 25-�l reaction mixture: 12.5 �l
TaqMan environmental master mix 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA), 3 �l primer/probe mix (composed of 74.5 �l of each primer at
100 �M and 6 �l of target probe at 100 �M), 2.5 �l bovine serum albumin
(BSA) (2 mg · ml�1), 2 �l sterile nuclease-free water, and 5 �l template
DNA. Temperature cycling consisted of 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C,
and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. The lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) for the qPCR assay was 2.5 gene copies per reac-
tion based on successful amplification in 50% of replicates of the lowest
concentration on the standard curve (74). Sample LLOQ was 1.67 � 104
gene copies per 100 g for sediment samples and 10 gene copies per 100 ml
for water samples. Blanks containing sterile Nanopure water in place of a
sample were processed as negative controls (no-template controls
[NTCs]). No blank amplified in any vanA qPCR assay. When the quanti-
fication cycle (Cq) values for the two replicates were greater than the Cq
values for the LLOQ, results were reported as detected but not quantified
(DNQ). Samples where neither replicate amplified and samples that did
not successfully amplify in the two replicate qPCRs (amplified in 1 of
2) were reported as not detected (ND). The standard curve for vanA
was constructed using a synthetic plasmid (IDT, Coralville, IA), contain-
ing the target sequence of the pIP816 vanA plasmid as previously pub-
lished (NCBI accession number X56895) (64). Inhibition of amplifica-
tion in environmental samples was tested using a qPCR SYBR green
assay for the vvhA gene of Vibrio vulnificus (75). V. vulnificus is an au-
tochthonous marine bacterium that does not grow in freshwater envi-
ronments. Reaction mixtures contained 4 �l of DNA sample and 1 �l
of V. vulnificus DNA (20,000 copies) and were compared to a control
reaction mixture containing 4 �l of nuclease-free water and 1 �l of V.
vulnificus DNA (20,000 copies) using previously published cycling con-
ditions and primers (76).
Accession number(s). Sequences were deposited in the NCBI Bio-
Project database under BioProject accession number PRJNA322710.
RESULTS
Concentrations of culturable enterococci in water were high at the
site of the spill (NC-03) immediately after the event (4.2 � 103
CFU per 100 ml), exceeding the U.S. EPA sample threshold value
(STV) standards for recreational waters of 1.3 � 102 CFU per 100
ml (77) (Fig. 1). Levels decreased over time but did not fall below
1.3 � 102 CFU per 100 ml at NC-03 until 30 October 2014, more
than 1 month after the event (Fig. 1). Enterococcal levels at the
boat ramp in receiving marine waters approximately 3 km from
the spill were within regulatory limits at each sampling date, rang-
ing from 5 to 22 CFU per 100 ml. Enterococcal levels were 2 to 3
orders of magnitude higher in sediment than in water at NC-03
and also decreased over time (Fig. 1).
Enterococci were also monitored by Pinellas County at eight
surface water sites ranging from 1 to 9 km away from the spill (B,
C, F, G, H, I, J, and Q) for 12 consecutive days following the spill
(see Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material). Four sites
within 4.5 km (from near to far, B, C, J, and Q) displayed entero-
coccal levels that exceeded recreational water quality standards
(130 CFU per 100 ml) (77) for some duration after the spill. Ex-
ceedances were recorded at site B for 8 days, site C for 1 day, site J
for 2 days, and site Q for 1 day. Maximum enterococcal levels were
recorded 6 days after the spill at site B (2,100 CFU per 100 ml) and
1 day after the spill at site C (210 CFU per 100 ml), site J (160 CFU
per 100 ml), and site Q (170 CFU per 100 ml). These sites were in
the receiving waters directly adjacent to the site of the spill, Long
Bayou and Cross Bayou, with the exception of site Q, which was in
Boca Ciega Bay. Recreational water quality standards were not
exceeded at the other four sites where enterococci were measured
(F, G, H, and I) in Boca Ciega Bay, a body of water that mixes with
the Gulf of Mexico and that is more than 5 km away from the spill.
VRE were detected by culture and confirmed as Enterococcus
faecium in water collected 2 and 3 days after the spill ceased at
NC-01, NC-02, and NC-03 (1 October 2014 and 2 October 2014)
but could not be confirmed in water or sediment on subsequent
dates (Fig. 1). A subset of putative VRE isolates from water sam-
pled on 1 October 2014 and 2 October 2014 (11 of 15) was iden-

 tified as E. faecium by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The qPCR assay
for vanA also confirmed that all 11 isolates identified as E. faecium
carried the vanA gene. The other four putative VRE isolates were
identified as Pediococcus spp. by16S rRNA sequencing. Colonies
that grew on mEI amended with 32 �g · ml�1 vancomycin but
could not be isolated and confirmed with molecular analyses were
detected in water until 30 October 2014 and in sediment until 16
October 2014.
The vanA gene was detected in environmental DNA samples
extracted from water and sediment up to 12 days after the spill (9
October 2014) at the sites within 800 m of the spill (NC-01, NC-
02, and NC-03) (Fig. 1; Table 1) but not at later dates. Concentra-
tions of vanA gene copies were approximately two orders of mag-
nitude higher in sediment than in water (Table 1) but were
reported per 100 g (wet weight) versus per 100 ml. In water, the
maximum for vanA gene copies was 2.2 log10 gene copies per 100
ml (at site NC-01 on 9 October 2014), and the average was 1.9
log10 gene copies per 100 ml. In sediment, the maximum for vanA
gene copies was 5.0 log10 gene copies per 100 g (at site NC-03 on 2
October 2014), and the average was 3.9 log10 gene copies per 100 g.
Sequencing results from environmental DNA on seven sam-
pling dates where both sediment and water were collected showed
distinct bacterial communities in water and sediment samples. In
both matrices, dates closest to the spill (2 October 2014 and 9
October 2014 for sediment and water plus 16 October 2014 for
water) were distinctly separate from those in the later sampling
weeks (Fig. 2). The trend shown by these data suggests that the
sediment and water at this site took approximately 2 to 3 weeks
to return to a stable structure following the spill. The change in
community composition is supported by a similar time frame
of noticeable sewage impacts on fecal indicator bacteria and
VRE (Fig. 1).
Six bacterial families shown to be highly prevalent in domestic
sewage in the United States (Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae,
Lachnospiraceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Pre-
votellaceae) (78) decreased in frequency with respect to total 16S
rRNA sequences over time at NC-03 in sediment and water (Fig.
3). OTUs identified to the family level represented 85% to 95% of
the total OTUs, with the exception of sediment on 2 October 2014,
where 43% were identified to the family level. One of the sewage-
associated families, Porphyromonadaceae, was found in the dom-
inant taxa (top 10 most abundant) on the first sampling date and
not at any later dates. Alpha diversity did not reveal temporal
trends during the course of the sampling. The temporal trend of
sewage-associated families also aligns with trends demonstrated in
enterococci, VRE, and community structure (Fig. 1 to 3). Domi-
nant families in sediment were different from dominant families
in water (Fig. 4). Neisseriaceae, a family containing many genera
associated with the gut flora of mammals, and Comamonadaceae,
a family containing common environmental denitrifiers, had the
greatest decline in relative abundance in water from the first to
later sampling dates. Similar trends in the distinction between
microbial communities in water and sediment were observed in
taxonomic diversity based on phyla (see Fig. S4A and B in the
supplemental material). Families containing common pathogens

 (Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae) were present at low levels
in water and sediment throughout the study (see Fig. S5A and B in
the supplemental material) and were combined to represent an
average of 0.41% and 1.4% of sequence reads over time in water
and sediment, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The sewage spill that we studied corresponded with elevated levels
of enterococci, VRE, and vanA genes in water and sediment, indi-
cating their release into the environment. All of these levels dimin-
ished steadily over the 2 weeks following the spill. No vanA genes
were detected in environmental samples after 12 days at the site of
the spill. This observation, and the fact that high-level VRE have
been infrequently observed in uncontaminated surface waters
(30), indicates that their presence in the environment before the
spill is unlikely and that these contaminants were sewage associ-
ated (i.e., no background levels of vanA or VRE would be expected
in the environment). The mitigation measures taken after the spill
(vacuum pumping, washing out, lime treatment) probably de-
creased levels of microorganisms from sewage but left high levels
of enterococci that slowly diminished over time in the area directly
adjacent to the spill. The plume of the sewage spill was also indi-
cated by the broader sampling effort in the region (as processed by
Pinellas County), where enterococcal levels exceeded recreational
water quality standards at the site closest to the spill (site B) but
decreased after 8 days. Sites downstream from the spill where en-
terococcal levels were high decreased after 1 to 2 days. Flow rates,
temperature, and other environmental conditions may impact the
persistence and reach of contamination, but these factors were
beyond the scope of this study.
The transfer of resistance through mechanisms such as hori-
zontal gene transfer, demonstrated by the detection of the mobile
vanA gene, can impact human health and the spread of resistance
in the environment. This study has demonstrated the release of
potentially pathogenic VRE and vanA genes into surface waters by
sanitary sewer overflow in the United States. High-level VRE and
vanA genes have been found in sewage from a hospital in Florida
but were not found in other sewage samples that were not directly
associated with a hospital (30). The spill in this study was not in
close proximity to any hospital; the closest is 2.6 miles from the
site of the sewer line break, and sewage from the hospital flows
away from the break site. Previous studies have also investigated
VRE in aquatic ecosystems, sanitary sewage, and WWTPs (48,
79–81), but community sewage (not associated with a hospital)
has not been explicitly linked to vanA genes or highly resistant
VRE in the United States. Results confirmed that untreated resi-
dential sewage released into aquatic environments can potentially
be a route of human exposure to ARB and contribute to environ-
mental reservoirs of ARB and ARGs.
Colonies that resembled VRE were detected in water samples
through 30 October 2014 and in sediment samples through 16
October 2014; however, putative VRE colonies observed after 2
October 2014 could not be isolated based on the methods de-
scribed above for confirmation. In all probability, they were either
Enterococcus species or members of other genera that could
“struggle” at 32 �g · ml�1 vancomycin on a crowded plate but did
not possess vanA and so could not grow when subcultured on
vancomycin. This observation reemphasizes the inaccuracy im-
plicit in reporting VRE solely based on culture methods as further
evidenced by the identification of Pediococcus spp. in this study.
Other studies have demonstrated the isolation of a small percent-
age of genera other than Enterococcus on mEI (47, 82). The addi-
tion of vancomycin in the screening step tends to exacerbate the
issue, as selection for intrinsically resistant genera, such as Pedio-
coccus, Weissella, and Leuconostoc, also occurs (30).
DNA sequencing analysis has explored the dominant micro-
bial taxa associated with sewage and human feces (78, 83), but the
microbial community in waters impacted by sewage has received

 less attention. The advantages of this site included limited water
input following the initial flushing so that changes in the commu-
nity could be followed over time without the dilution effect that
would occur in a large water body. The influx of sewage at this site
produced a bacterial community with a prominent component of
sewage- and fecal-associated bacteria that was detectable at the site
for at least 2 weeks. The abundance of sewage-associated families
declined on a similar time scale to enterococci, but the fate (i.e.,
death, transport, consumption by predators) of these bacteria and
other pathogens was not determined. Some families containing
pathogenic members and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (Entero-
coccaceae, Enterobacteriaceae) were represented throughout the
sampling period.
Differences in community structure in sediment versus water
were evident. The dominant phyla in water were consistent with
those found in a study of 10 sites in the Mississippi River (Proteo-
bacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Verru-
comicrobia accounting for approximately 94% of sequences) (84).
However, Firmicutes (containing pathogen taxa) were more prev-
alent in water on the days immediately after the sewage spill than
at later dates compared to the consistent low levels in the Missis-
sippi River samples. The dominant taxa in sediment were consis-
tent with published research where Proteobacteria and Firmicutes
are prevalent phyla (85). It is interesting to note that the commu-
nities in water and sediment changed over approximately the
same time frame and that they also remained distinct from one
another. The relative rate of change in various environmental
habitats bears further exploration, particularly given the exten-
sive literature discussion about the potential role of sediments
as environmental reservoirs for microbial pathogens and indi-
cators (86–89).
This study confirms that potentially pathogenic ARB and asso-
ciated ARGs can be released into the environment through un-
treated sewage and can persist for days or weeks after the initial
introduction. Although the study area was flushed with water im-
mediately after the spill, the sewage signal, as measured by entero-
coccal levels, persisted for 2 weeks after the event. This study sup-
ports the need for more mechanistic, empirical studies to address
the role of environmental variability in the survival of ARB and
ARGs, including parameters such as temperature and flow rates.
Later sampling events, when no vanA genes were detected and no
VRE were detected, support the previous studies suggesting their
sewage association and absence of environmental background lev-
els (30, 50, 90). While this study lacks a “before” sampling date for
this site, the temporal sampling and the current literature support
the idea that the vanA genes and VRE were derived from sewage.
Immediately following the spill, E. faecium isolates harboring the
vanA gene were identified in water samples at the site. The prob-
ability of human exposure outside of the cleanup crew was mini-
mal in this case study, but sewage contamination events that occur
at popular beaches and recreational areas may put more people at
risk of exposure to antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this study,
antibiotic-resistant, opportunistic pathogens (VRE) associated
with sewage entered the environment through a contamination
event and persisted, potentially contributing to the spread of an-
tibiotic resistance in the environment. Environmental reservoirs
of ARB need further research and should be considered in frame-
works designed to assess the spread of antibiotic resistance.
