Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition that progresses in some patients to
steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we used healthcare records of 18 million
adults to estimate risk of acquiring advanced liver disease diagnoses in patients with NAFLD or NASH compared to
individually matched controls.
Methods: Data were extracted from four European primary care databases representing the UK, Netherlands, Italy
and Spain. Patients with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH (NAFLD/NASH) were followed up for incident
cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Each coded NAFLD/NASH patient was matched to up to 100 “non-NAFLD” patients by
practice site, gender, age ± 5 years and visit recorded within ± 6 months. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using
Cox models adjusted for age and smoking status and pooled across databases by random effects meta-analyses.
Results: Out of 18,782,281 adults, we identified 136,703 patients with coded NAFLD/NASH. Coded NAFLD/NASH
patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension and obesity than matched controls. HR for cirrhosis in
patients compared to controls was 4.73 (95% CI 2.43–9.19) and for HCC, 3.51 (95% CI 1.72–7.16). HR for either
outcome was higher in patients with NASH and those with high-risk Fib-4 scores. The strongest independent
predictor of a diagnosis of HCC or cirrhosis was baseline diagnosis of diabetes.
Conclusions: Real-world population data show that recorded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH increases risk of life-
threatening liver outcomes. Diabetes is an independent predictor of advanced liver disease diagnosis, emphasising
the need to identify specific groups of patients at highest risk.

 Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most
common cause of liver disease worldwide. NAFLD
represents a spectrum of disease that includes simple
steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fi-
brosis [1]. The numbers of individuals presenting with
end-stage complications of NASH, namely decompen-
sated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
are rising [2, 3], and NASH is rapidly becoming the
most common indication for liver transplantation [4].
Yet not all patients within the NAFLD spectrum pro-
gress, and for the majority, NAFLD is a benign condi-
tion [1]. A key clinical challenge is to identify the
proportion of patients who are at high risk of devel-
oping advanced liver disease, so that interventions, in-
cluding the many novel therapies in development, can
be targeted to those at greatest need.
Our current understanding of NAFLD epidemiology
and progression largely derives from single-centre stud-
ies of small- or medium-sized cohorts and meta-analyses
of these [5–7]. These studies, together with emerging
data from placebo arms of therapeutic trials [8], have
taught us that patients with existing evidence of progres-
sive disease (e.g., fibrosis) are at risk of further progres-
sion to HCC and decompensated cirrhosis, albeit this
may reflect a degree of lead-time bias. Such studies
often involve formal assessment of well-phenotyped
patients at inclusion but are, by design, selective and
may not represent the ‘real-world’ situation for the
majority of patients with NAFLD. Paired biopsy data
have been reported, although the second biopsy is
often performed because of clinical suspicion and not
per study protocol, which may bias estimates of pro-
gression [9]. Real-world patients are socially and eth-
nically diverse, have comorbidities and concomitant
medications or simply cannot commit to long-term
studies or trials and therefore may not be represented
by any of these study designs.
Increasingly, real-world data derived from primary
care electronic health records (EHR) of a sizeable pro-
portion of the general population [10, 11] are being used
to address these issues. In many European countries,
where healthcare is largely state-funded and there are
low or absent primary care co-payments, the population
has unrestricted access to healthcare via primary care
physicians who act as gatekeepers for referral to second-
ary care [12]. People register with primary care centres
at birth or when they move to an area in order to access
healthcare; therefore, primary care EHR represent data
that are as close to the ‘general’ population as possible. If
a practice joins the database, all the patients at that
practice are registered in the database and, although
there is an option for individual patients to opt out,
this is minimal (< 1%).
In order to gain insights into the NAFLD spectrum of
diseases in real-world patients, we extracted data from
four large European primary care databases and identi-
fied a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of NAFLD or
of NASH. Our aim in this study was to estimate the risk
for patients with diagnoses of NAFLD or NASH to ac-
quire a new diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC and to
understand the main predictors for this.
Methods
Databases
Databases were accessed via the European Medical In-
formation Framework (EMIF) network: The Health
Search Database (HSD) in Italy [13], The Integrated Pri-
mary Care Information (IPCI) in the Netherlands [14],
the
Information
System
for
the
Development
of
Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) in Spain [15] and
The Health Information Network (THIN) in the UK
[16] (Additional file 1: Table S1). HSD collects electronic
medical record data from a network of over 800 Italian
GPs who are members of the Italian College of General
Practitioners. IPCI is a longitudinal collection of elec-
tronic patient records from over 750 Dutch general
practitioners, containing data from over 2 million pa-
tients. SIDIAP collects data from 274 primary care prac-
tices comprising 3414 basic care units [17], and THIN
contains the electronic medical records of 11.1 million
patients from 562 general practices in the UK, covering
6.2% of the UK population [18]. The data custodians for
each database provided approval that the protocol of the
study complied with local privacy laws. Anonymised data
were extracted locally by each data custodian liaising
with the EMIF Platform and using a data transformation
tool called Jerboa Reloaded [10]. The data were then
uploaded onto a secure remote server maintained by an
independent academic centre (Erasmus Medical Centre
Private Research Environment, Netherlands) and ana-
lysed centrally.
Study design
We conducted a matched cohort study. All patients with
a diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH (termed NAFLD/
NASH) prior to 01/01/2016 were identified in the four
databases using harmonisation methods previously de-
scribed [10]. Patients were included in the analysis if
they were aged ≥ 18 at diagnosis and had medical re-
cords available for ≥ 12 months from registration with
the practice. Exclusion criteria were missing informa-
tion on age and sex, a record of alcohol abuse at any
time prior to diagnosis and a history of liver morbid-
ity within the 12 months prior to diagnosis [10] (see
Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods for exclusion
diagnoses).

 Each NAFLD/NASH patient was matched with up to
100 ‘non-exposed’ controls who did not have a NAFLD
or NASH diagnosis at or prior to the index date (defined
as the date of diagnosis of the matched NAFLD/NASH
patient). Matching was done by practice site, age at
index date ± 5 years, sex and a visit at the practice within
± 6 months of the index date.
In the THIN and SIDIAP databases, the terminology
of the database (Read code and International Classifica-
tion of Disease version 10, ICD10, respectively) allowed
NAFLD and NASH diagnoses to be distinguished from
each other. Therefore, in these databases, a matched
control cohort was constructed for each of the diagno-
ses: NAFLD, NASH and, to enable comparison between
all databases, NAFLD/NASH. If a patient had both
NAFLD and NASH diagnoses recorded, the earliest
event was used to define index date of NAFLD/NASH
diagnosis, and the NASH diagnosis deemed an inci-
dent event. In HSD (ICD 9) and IPCI (IPCI Dutch),
where NAFLD and NASH could not be distinguished,
only one cohort (NAFLD/NASH) was defined and
controls matched to this.
Patients were followed up from the index date until
the earliest of occurrence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular car-
cinoma or NASH (where this could be identified), end of
the study period (31/12/2015) and loss of follow-up due
to exit out of the database or death. Events of interest
were incident diagnosis of cirrhosis, hepatocellular car-
cinoma or NASH, where this could be identified. See
Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods for variable
extraction and data analysis.
Results
Out of 18,782,281 eligible individuals in the four databases,
we identified 136,703 (0.7%) who had a recorded diagnosis
of either NAFLD or NASH (coded NAFLD/NASH) and
who met the inclusion criteria (Additional file 1: Table S1).
The Spanish (SIDIAP) and UK (THIN) databases contrib-
uted 71% of all cases; the remaining 29% of coded NAFLD/
NASH cases were from the Dutch (IPCI) and Italian (HSD)
databases. In SIDIAP, 2.5% of all coded NAFLD/NASH pa-
tients (n = 1880) had NASH, and in THIN, this was 4.7%
(n = 1212). Due to the coding, NAFLD and NASH could
not be distinguished in IPCI and HSD. Therefore, in the
initial phase of analysis, we combined all NAFLD and
NASH codes from all four databases as coded NAFLD/
NASH.
Comparing coded NAFLD/NASH patients across the
four databases, there were minor differences between da-
tabases in mean age, BMI and proportion with diabetes
(Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). BMI data were
available in 64.6% of patients with coded NAFLD/NASH
and in 45.9% of matched controls (Additional file 1:
Table S3). In the subset of patients for whom data
were available, ALT and AST values were highest in
THIN, and the proportion of obese patients highest
in SIDIAP. Sufficient data were available to calculate
the non-invasive fibrosis Fib-4 score (age, AST, ALT
and platelets) in 46.7% of patients (range 12.6–62.6%,
Table 2). THIN (UK) had the smallest proportion of
patients with Fib-4 data (12.6%), in whom the propor-
tion of patients with high-risk scores was 10.5%, high-
est among the four databases.
Patients with a coded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH had
comparable age and sex distribution, smoking rates and
duration of follow-up as matched controls (Table 1). As
expected, however, controls had lower BMI; lower rates
of obesity, hypertension or diabetes; and lower serum
levels of ALT and AST.
Risk of incident cirrhosis and HCC is higher in NAFLD/
NASH patients compared to controls
Combining all four databases, the median duration of
follow-up was 3.3 years (IQR 1.8–5.3) totalling 531,452
person-years for patients with coded NAFLD/NASH and
43,385,495 person-years for controls. Among all coded
NAFLD/NASH patients, the incidence of cirrhosis
diagnosis was 0.76 per 1000 person-years, (95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 0.46 to 2.32), and the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis was 0.3 per 1000
person-years, (0.26 to 0.60; Additional file 1: Table S4).
Patients with coded NAFLD/NASH were at significantly
higher risk of acquiring a new diagnosis of cirrhosis
compared to controls with a pooled HR of 4.73
(95%CI 2.43–9.19) after adjustment for age, smoking
status and BMI (Fig. 1).
Similarly, the risk of incident HCC diagnosis was sig-
nificantly higher in coded NAFLD/NASH patients com-
pared to controls. The pooled HR across the four
databases for an incident diagnosis of HCC was 3.51
(95%CI 1.72–7.16 Fig. 2). There were no significant dif-
ferences in the HRs when categorising patients into
those with and without obesity, smoking, diabetes or
hypertension; male sex and older age (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). There were no significant differences in the
HRs for cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses following adjust-
ment for age and smoking alone in all coded NAFLD/
NASH patients compared to patients with available BMI
data (Additional file 1: Figures S2 and S3). This is des-
pite the fact that patients with BMI data were more
likely to be smokers (19.5% vs 11.2%), diabetic (26.9% vs
7.0%) and hypertensive (50.1% vs 27.9%, Additional file 1:
Table S5).
Fib-4 predicts disease progression in patients with
NAFLD/NASH

could calculate Fib-4 (n = 63,971, Additional file 1: Table S3),

 the incidence of a new diagnosis of cirrhosis was
significantly higher for the high-risk compared to
low-risk category (HR 33.24, 95%CI 8.82–125.34), adjust-
ing for age and smoking status and more modest, albeit
still significant, for the intermediate compared to low-risk
group (HR 5.04, 95%CI 2.30–11.04 Additional file 1:

scores, the incidence of an HCC diagnosis was higher in

scores
(HR

Distinguishing NAFLD from NASH diagnoses when
estimating risk of cirrhosis and HCC
The pooled HR for incident NASH diagnosis in patients with
a coded diagnosis of NAFLD compared to controls was 7.75
(95%CI 2.56–23.51, p = 0.008) although this estimate is based
on a very small number of individuals (n = 130 of whom
only seven were in SIDIAP, Additional file 1: Figure S5).
In the subset of patients with a coded diagnosis of NASH,
the incidence of diagnoses of liver outcomes was higher
than in those with NAFLD albeit confidence intervals
overlapped: 3.25 per 1000 person-years (95%CI 2.41–4.10)
for cirrhosis and 1.16 per 1000 person-years (95%CI 0.67–
1.65) for HCC (Figs. 1 and 2).
Short time interval to cirrhosis diagnosis in patients with
NAFLD and NASH
In SIDIAP, 174 out of 75,415 patients with coded
NAFLD were coded as having cirrhosis (incidence rate
0.66 per 1000 person-years (95%CI 0.56–0.76) with a
median time to the new diagnosis of 2.9 years whereas
38 out of 1880 patients with NASH acquired a diagnosis
of cirrhosis (incidence rate 2.83 per 1000 person-years
(95%CI 2.0–3.88, Additional file 1: Table S4) with a simi-
lar median time to diagnosis of 3.0 years (Additional file 1:
Table S6). In THIN, the incidence of cirrhosis was
higher and the interval between diagnoses was shorter

 for both stages of disease. One hundred three out of
24,743 patients with coded NAFLD acquired a cirrhosis
diagnostic code (incidence rate 2.17 per 1000 person-
years (95%CI 1.86–2.51) with median time to diagnosis
of 2.0 years, compared to 26 out of 1212 patients with
coded NASH (incidence rate 5.81 per 1000 person-years
(95% CI 3.8–8.52) with median time to diagnosis of
0.5 years.
Diabetes predicts disease progression
In coded NAFLD/NASH patients, the strongest associ-
ation with incident liver outcomes was observed in pa-
tients who also had a past diagnosis of diabetes at
baseline (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9–2.78). In matched controls
without coded NAFLD/NASH, smoking was also associ-
ated with liver outcome (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.41–1.6) in
addition to the independent risk attributed to diabetes,
which was higher than in patients with coded NAFLD/
NASH (HR 2.92, 95% CI 2.76–3.08, Table 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date that
has used EHR data to investigate rates of new diagnoses
of advanced liver disease in patients with NAFLD. Our
patients were well-matched to a very large number of
controls according to sex, age, GP practice and most re-
cent visit, thus limiting bias due to geographical and so-
cioeconomic diversity and behaviours relating to health
service utilisation. Patients with coded NAFLD/NASH
are at significantly increased risk of acquiring a diagnosis
of cirrhosis or HCC, compared to matched controls.
The risk is greater in patients with a coded diagnosis of
NASH compared to NAFLD and in those with high-risk
Fib-4 fibrosis scores compared to indeterminate or low-
risk scores. Diabetes is an independent risk factor for pro-
gression to either HCC or cirrhosis diagnoses in both
coded NAFLD/NASH patients and matched controls.
We applied minimal selection criteria and therefore
were able to include over 78% of all adults registered in
the databases, hence the ‘real-world’ nature of the study.
The overall proportion of people with coded NAFLD/
NASH diagnoses is lower than expected as reported pre-
viously [10], is in keeping with other primary care work
[19] and may reflect levels of awareness of NAFLD/
NASH in primary care [20, 21]. Hence, our data, by def-
inition, can only represent the visible part of the clinical
iceberg. Despite this, we find that patients with coded
NAFLD/NASH acquire
diagnoses
of life-threatening
liver disease within a relatively short follow-up period
(median 3.3 years).
It is not feasible that the short time intervals between
coded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and advanced liver dis-
ease reflect true rates of disease progression, estimated to
be one fibrosis stage per 7 years [22]. The acquisition of a
new code in the healthcare record does not necessarily
mean that pathological progression has occurred at that
time, nor that the stage did not exist at baseline. Our inter-
pretation of these data is that patients in Europe are being
diagnosed at the later stages of disease, which are associated
with greater risk of liver-related mortality [23–25].

 Less than 50% of patients had sufficient data to calcu-
late Fib-4, the components of which are also needed to
calculate many other non-invasive fibrosis scores [26].
There was marked national variation in fibrosis assess-
ment; 73.1% of patients in whom we could calculate
Fib-4 were from the Spanish database. We have no way
of determining whether these scores were actually calcu-
lated by clinicians and whether they influenced decision-
making. This is despite the fact that such risk stratification
is central to most guidelines [27–29], used to determine
clinical management, select patients for clinical trials and
probably triage patients for future therapy.
In the databases where NAFLD/NASH codes could
not be distinguished (HSD and IPCI), even those with
low-risk Fib-4 scores were at increased risk of cirrhosis
and HCC compared to controls. This further suggests
that primary care records under-estimate disease severity
and that some patients with NAFLD/NASH diagnoses
actually have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis already.
Apart from a diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, diabetes was
the strongest independent risk factor for acquiring a
diagnosis of cirrhosis or HCC. In the matched control
population, the HR for diabetes was even higher than
the coded NAFLD/NASH cohort, which may reflect a
significant number of individuals with undiagnosed
NAFLD/NASH among the controls. The importance of
diabetes is consistent with a review of patients who had
undergone more than one biopsy in the course of their
routine clinical care in the UK, which showed that dia-
betes was a risk factor for progression of fibrosis [9].
Obesity is an important risk factor for many cancers in-
cluding HCC [30], but we did not find that in our study.
If patients are diagnosed late in the disease spectrum, it
is unlikely that patients will have undergone surveillance
and HCC may be diagnosed at late stages when symp-
toms including weight loss are manifest. Taken together,
these findings emphasise the need to recognise risk fac-
tors for progressive disease and to detect disease at early
stages when interventions can be more effective.
This study is subject to limitations. The nature of
real-world data is such that we cannot ascertain the ori-
gin of codes nor the motivation for adding diagnoses to
the patient record. Although the study is based in pri-
mary care, it is likely that a large proportion of diagnoses
will have been made with some involvement of second-
ary care. It would be inaccurate to assume that all pa-
tients who carry the code ‘NASH’ have had a liver
biopsy and histological assessment and it might be that
the diagnosis was assumed and recorded based on, for
example, ultrasound evidence of fatty liver and elevated
serum transaminases or increased stiffness on transient
elastography. Similarly, it was not possible to confirm
that the matched controls did not have NAFLD/NASH.
However, the clinical features of patients with coded
NAFLD/NASH are consistent with the diagnostic codes,
although if patients with NAFLD/NASH do exist in the
control group then the effect sizes reported here are un-
derestimates of the real risk. This means that there are
individuals living with diabetes in primary care who have
not been diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH but are at
significantly increased risk of developing liver cirrho-
sis and cancer.
The estimated size of the NAFLD problem has raised
fears of large unmanageable patient numbers who are
not at immediate threat of disease. Notwithstanding our
expectation that many cases have not been identified in
this study, we have shown that 0.6% of patients with an
existing coded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH acquire a
diagnosis of cirrhosis and/or HCC within a 3-year
follow-up period. This gives us insight into the rate at
which advanced disease is discovered, even if this is not
the natural history in the general population. The clin-
ical impact of our data is that they highlight the large
gaps in diagnosis and risk assessment of NAFLD and
NASH with variable rates of risk stratification, staging of
disease and seemingly late diagnosis.
Conclusions
Our knowledge of NAFLD/NASH is being based on
small, highly selected cohort studies. These have been
accurate in telling us the potential scale of the preva-
lence and progression of disease, but the reality for many
in the general population is some way from that. In
order to affect population health and make an impact on
the overall health burden of advanced liver disease, we
cannot simply rely on introducing effective therapies to
the small number of people with established diagnoses.
The current approach to opportunistically investigate
those in whom abnormalities in liver tests arise is clearly
not working. While better biomarkers are needed that
identify those at risk more precisely, the current tools
are not being used, leaving many patients unclear as to
the stage of their disease and its significance to their
health. Therefore, making an impact on advanced liver
disease will need co-ordinated efforts to identify those
with NAFLD, to stage their disease and target those at
risk of progression.
