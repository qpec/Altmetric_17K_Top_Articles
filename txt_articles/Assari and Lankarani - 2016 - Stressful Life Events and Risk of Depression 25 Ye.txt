Background: Although stressful life events (SLEs) predict subsequent risk of developing 
a major depressive episode (MDE), limited information exists on whether or not race and 
gender alters the predictive role of SLE on risk of MDE over a long-term period. The 
current study explored race and gender differences in the long-term predictive role of 
SLE at baseline (1986) on subsequent risk of MDE 25 years later (2011) in a nationally 
representative cohort in the United States.
Methods: Using a life course epidemiological approach, this longitudinal study borrowed 
data from the Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) Study 1986–2011. Main predictor of 
interest was baseline SLE over the last 3 years measured at 1986. Main outcome was 
risk of MDE [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)] 25 years later (2011). 
Covariates included demographics, socioeconomics, depressive symptoms [Center for 
Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D)], chronic medical conditions, and 
health behaviors measured at baseline (1986). Gender and race were the focal moder-
ators. We employed logistic regressions in the pooled sample, and specific to race and 
gender, to test whether or not SLE × race and SLE × gender interactions are significant.
results: In the pooled sample, baseline SLE (1986) predicted risk of MDE 25 years later 
(2011). We also found a gender by SLE interaction, suggesting a stronger predictive role 
of SLE for subsequent clinical depression for men compared to women. Race did not 
modify the predictive role of SLE on subsequent risk of MDE 25 years later.
conclusion: How SLE predicts MDE 25 years later differs for men and women, with a 
stronger predictive role for men compared to women. More research is needed to better 
understand the complex links between gender, sex, stress, and depression.

Regardless of the type of stressor (1, 2), literature has consistently shown a strong association between 
stressful life events (SLEs) and the risk of depression (3). As a result, researchers have used a number 
of stressors (i.e., SLE) (4) as an indicator of depression risk (1, 2). The role of SLE as a major risk 
factor for depression in clinical and community settings has been confirmed by meta-analyses and

systematic reviews (3, 5–7). However, most of our knowledge is 
on the role of SLE as a predictor of risk of depression over a short 
period of time (8), which is a trigger (9) rather than SLE as a 
predictor of the long-term risk of depression (9). More is yet to 
be learned about the predictive role of SLE on the long-term risk 
of depression (9). In this view, SLE is being conceptualized as 
a proxy of the life environment of the individual, rather than a 
trigger of a depressive episode in the near future. This is in line 
with a life course perspective that suggests early exposures will 
have long-term effects over the life course (10–14).
There is a debate regarding whether or not stress response 
is independent of setting and context (5, 15, 16), or is context 
dependent (17–21). Despite decades of research to understand 
characteristics that alter the effect of stress on depression (22, 
23), our information is still limited on factors that mitigate the 
SLE–depression association (24–27). As the effects of SLE largely 
should depend on characteristics of the individual who experi-
ences stress, and also the context in which stress occurs (28), it 
is plausible to hypothesize that the effect of SLE on MDD may 
vary for populations (29, 30). In line with this differential effect 
hypothesis, sub-populations endorse different levels of vulner-
ability to the effect of risk and protective factors (31). In this view, 
all associations in health including the SLE–depression associa-
tion are a heterogenic relation, varying from one population to 
another (31). This is in line with a growing body of evidence on 
population variation in the effects of other risk and protective 
factors (12–14, 25, 27, 32–36).
Race may alter the link between SLE and depression at each 
time point, and also over time. Despite higher levels of exposure to 
SLE (37), Blacks have disproportionally lower rates of depression 
(38), a phenomenon called the Black–White paradox (39, 40). 
Thus, race alters how stress is associated with risk of depression 
(41). In a recent study in 2015, Assari used data from the National 
Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003, a cross-sectional survey 
of 5008 Blacks, and 891 Non-Hispanic Whites and showed that 
among men, the SLE × race interaction was significant, suggesting 
a stronger association between SLE and major depressive episode 
(MDE) among White men compared to Black men. Such interac-
tion between SLE × race was not found among women. Authors 
concluded that the association between SLE and depression may 
be stronger for White men than Black men; however, this link 
does not differ between White and Black women (27). In another 
study by Moazen, Zadeh, and Assari, psychological distress meas-
ured by number of depressive symptoms in 1986, which predicted 
MDD 15 years later for Whites failed to predict MDD for Blacks. 
The authors concluded that psychological measures that count 
subjective symptoms may fail to have more objective measures, 
such as MDD in the future among Blacks (14). None of these 
studies have, however, focused on the long-term predictive role 
of SLE on subsequent risk of MDD.
Gender is also another main factor that may alter the cross-
sectional and long-term associations between experiences of 
stress and the risk of MDD. Based on the psychosocial theory of 
depression, predominance of MDD in women is at least in part 
mediated by a higher exposure of women to SLE during childhood 
and adulthood (42, 43). Another main hypothesis for higher 
prevalence of depression among women is gendered response 
to SLE (44). Biological mechanisms, such as hormones may also 
be involved in role of sex as a moderator of the effect of stress 
on depression (45–47). In this study, however, we conceptual-
ized gender as a social construct that shapes life experiences, 
exposures, and resources, and coping styles (48, 49).
We conducted this study to explore race and gender differences 
in the predictive role of SLE in 1986 on long-term risk of depres-
sion 25 years later in 2011. Similar to previous work (25–27), we 
conceptualized race and gender as potential moderators of the 
stress–MDE link. This study focuses on the contextual effects of 
race and gender as moderators of the effects of risk factors rather 
than the main effects of gender or race on outcome above and 
beyond risk factors. To provide results generalizable to the United 
States, we used nationally representative data.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Design and setting
Data were from wave 1 (1986) and wave 5 (2011) of the 
Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) Study, a nationally representa-
tive longitudinal study in the United States (50, 51). Appendix 1 
in Supplementary Material provides additional information on 
sampling, follow-up, and data collection.
Original study
The ACL study is the oldest ongoing nationally representative 
longitudinal study on the role of a broad range of psychosocial 
factors on health changes with aging over the life course from 
adulthood to early elderly (52).
ethics
The original study received approval from the institutional 
review board (IRB), University of Michigan. Informed consent 
was obtained from all individual participants included in the 
study. All procedures performed in studies involving human 
participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 
institutional and/or national research committee and with the 
1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or compara-
ble ethical standards.
Participants and sampling
The ACL used a stratified multistage probability sampling strategy. 
The ACL has oversampled African Americans and older adults 
(age 60 and above). In 1986, the study enrolled 3,617 community-
dwelling adults age 25 or older who lived in the continental U.S. 
Wave 1 included 70% of sampled households and 68% of sampled 
individuals. Wave 5 included 81% of survivors in 2011. More 
information on participants, sampling, and recruitment is shown 
in Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material (52, 53).
analytical sample
The current analysis is limited to 1,129 individuals who were 
followed for 25 years. The study is on the role of SLE in 1986 on 
MDE 25 years later. So, only survivors and those who participated 
in wave 1 and wave 5 could enter this study.

Process
First, wave data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Wave 5 
data were collected via either face-to-face or telephone interviews. 
Telephone interviews are accepted for Composite International 
Diagnostic (54) and other structured diagnostic interviews (55).
Measures
Baseline data were collected on demographic characteristics, 
socioeconomic status, health behaviors, depressive symptoms, 
and health at wave 1 (1986). MDE was measured at wave 5 (2011).
stressful life events
We collected data on the number of major negative events in 
the past 3 years. Participants were asked about SLE at wave 1 
(1986), using a measure that accords well with current standards 
of measurement of major/traumatic events (56). Although more 
comprehensive stress measures have been developed since 1986 
(57), there is still no gold standard for measurement of stress (57).
Demographics
Demographic variables included age (continuous measure), race 
(Black and White, with White as the reference group), and gender 
(dichotomous variable with male as the reference group). While 
age was a covariate, race and gender were moderators.
socioeconomics
Socioeconomic status was measured using education (years of 
schooling) and income [an 11 – level categorical (rank) variable 
treated as a continuous measure].
chronic Medical conditions
We collected data on chronic medical conditions (CMC) by 
measuring self-reported data. Participants were asked whether 
or not health care providers have ever told them that they had 
any of the following seven conditions: hypertension, diabetes, 
chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and cancer. 
Participants were also asked if they were currently taking medica-
tion for these conditions. Based on dichotomous responses, we 
calculated a sum score, ranging from 0 to 7, with a higher score 
indicating more CMC (51).
self-rated health
Respondents were asked to classify their self-rated health (SRH) 
as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. SRH was operational-
ized in the following two ways: (1) as a dichotomous measure and 
(2) as a continuous score. For the first approach, we collapsed this 
five-category scale into two categories (fair/poor vs. excellent/
very good/good), a cutoff point that is common in the literature. 
This measure has shown high test–retest reliability and validity, 
when considering its predictive power for mortality and other 
health outcomes (58, 59) (1 = excellent and 5 = poor).
Function
We collected information on respondents’ functional health fus-
ing several questions. A score of 1 represents confinement to a 
bed or chair and a score of 4 represents the ability to do heavy 
work inside or outside of the home. These scores were then 
transformed into a three-category variable: (1) no functional 
limitation (i.e., able to do heavy work around the house); (2) some 
limitation, meaning the respondent reported not being able to do 
such things as heavy physical labor or work around the house; or 
(3) moderate/severe limitation, meaning the respondent reported 
having great difficulty walking a few blocks or climbing stairs, or 
reported being confined to a bed or a chair (57).
Obesity
Obesity was defined based on the body mass index (BMI) of 
larger than 30 kg/m2. The BMI level was calculated based on 
self-reported weights and heights. Weight and height were 
originally collected in pounds (1 pound = 0.453 kg) and feet (1 
foot = 0.3048 m)/inches (1 inch = 0.0254 m), respectively. BMI 
calculated based on self-reported weight and height is known to 
be closely correlated with BMI based on direct measures of height 
and weight (60).
health Behaviors
The study also used ACL measures on exercise (physical activ-
ity), smoking (i.e., tobacco use), and drinking (i.e., alcohol con-
sumption). The first measure, the physical activity index, asked 
respondents how often they engaged in the following activities: 
working in the garden or yard, participating in active sports or 
exercise, and taking walks. A 4-point Likert scale response ranged 
from “often” to “never.” The index was scored by taking the mean 
of the three items (61). A high value scored by respondents 
indicated a high level of physical activity. To measure smoking 
behavior, we asked respondents whether they currently smoke. 
A dummy variable was created where 1 = current smoker and 
0 = non-smoker. A similar dummy measure was used concern-
ing alcohol use, that is, whether or not the respondent currently 
drinks (1 = current drinker and 0 = non-drinker) (62).
Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were measured with a brief version of the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) 
which included 11 items (63). Items measured the extent to 
which in the past week respondents felt depressed, happy, lonely, 
sad, restless sleep, that everything was an effort, that people were 
unfriendly, that they did not feel like eating, that people dislike 
them, that they could not get going, and that they enjoyed life. 
Item responses were 1 (“hardly ever”) to 3 (“most of the time”). 
Positively worded items were reverse-coded, and a mean score 
was computed across all 11 items (32, 64, 65), resulting in a 
continuous measure of depressive symptoms for baseline, rang-
ing from 1 to 3. Higher scores indicated more severe depressive 
symptoms. This abbreviated CES-D has acceptable reliability and 
a similar factor structure to the original version (33).
cognitive impairment
The ACL survey has adopted the five-items of the Short Portable 
Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) to measure the cognitive 
impairment of the respondents. The SPMSQ assesses respond-
ents’ memory, knowledge of current events, and ability to

perform mathematical tasks and is designed to identify cognitive 
deficits among community and institutionalized settings (66, 67). 
The measure used the following four items: (a) “What is the date 
today – month, day, and year?” (b) “What day of the week is it?” 
(c) “What is the name of the president of the United States?” (d) 
“Subtract 3 from 20 and tell me the number you get. Then, keep 
subtracting 3 from this number and each new number you get, 
telling me the results as you go (Stop when the answer is 2 or 
less).” Each item was coded as 0 “correct” or 1 “incorrect,” with a 
total score representing the cognitive impairment (higher scores 
indicate poorer cognitive functioning) (68).
clinical Depression
The outcome variable was the 12-month MDE measured at 
2011 using the World Mental Health Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). CIDI is a fully structured diagnostic 
interview and evaluates a wide range of Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual-IV (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorders, including but not 
limited to MDE. CIDI has been used reliably on the World Mental 
Health project (64).
statistical analysis
Due to the complex sample design used in the HRS, Stata 13.0 
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for data analysis. 
Taylor series linearization was used for estimation of SEs. Thus, 
the stratified and clustered data, as well as non-response patterns, 
were considered for data analysis. Using weights enabled us to 
provide rates that are generalizable to the U.S. population.
For univariate analyses, we reported means or frequencies 
(%) when appropriate. For multivariate analysis, we used logistic 
regression models in the pooled sample, and also stratified by 
race and gender. SLE was the main predictor of interest, and 
the outcome was risk of endorsement for MDE measured in 
2011 using CIDI. Covariates included baseline demographics, 
socioeconomics, depressive symptoms (CES-D), physical health 
(hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, heart disease, 
stroke, cancer, and arthritis), and health behaviors measured in 
1986. Gender and race were the focal moderators.
We did not control for SLE in 2011. Controlling for SLE 
concurrent with outcome is needed when the focus is to know 
the residual effects of SLE in 1986 on MDE in 2011 net of SLE 
in 2011. Thus, the goal of this study is to study predictive (not 
residual) effect of SLE on MDE. With that goal, controlling for 
SLE in 2011 will be a case of over-adjustment, as higher SLE in 
2011 may be in the causal path for the effect of SLE in 1986 on 
MDE in 2011. A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered 
as statistically significant. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) are reported.
resUlTs
The current analysis included 1,129 individuals who were followed 
for 25 years and completed surveys in wave 1 and wave 5 of the 
ACL study. Participants were White men (n = 294), Black men 
(n = 108), White women (n = 490), and Black women (n = 237).
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for age, education, 
income, depressive symptoms, CMC, and health behaviors at 
baseline by race and gender. The majority of participants (64%) 
were females with a mean age of 41 (SD = 11) years at baseline 
(Table 1).
Table 2 provides a summary of four logistic regressions in the 
pooled sample. Gender interacted with baseline SLE on the risk 
of MDE 25 years later, suggesting a stronger predictive role of 
SLE on the risk of subsequent clinical depression for men com-
pared to women. Race did not modify the SLE–MDE association 
(Table 2).
Table 3 provides a summary of logistic regressions based on 
race and gender, with and without SES in the model. Neither 
race nor gender had main effects on risk of MDD while SLE was 
controlled. SLE was associated with risk of MDD among men and 
women. However, SLE was associated with risk of MDD among 
Whites but not Blacks. These associations stayed in the model 
when SES was introduced to the model (Table 3).
Tables 3 and 4 provide a summary of logistic regressions based 
on race and gender. While baseline SES, health, depressive symp-
toms, and health behaviors were in the model, SLE only predicted 
MDD among men but not women. We also found that SLE only 
predicted MDD among Whites but not Blacks.
DiscUssiOn
In line with the differential effect hypothesis (31, 34–36), gender 
influenced the predictive role of baseline SLE on the risk of 
MDE 25 years later, suggesting a stronger predictive role for men

compared to women. We could not find racial differences in the 
predictive role of baseline SLE on subsequent risk of MDE.
Our findings may be due to gender differences in the threshold 
of reporting stress. Our findings may also be due to the gender 
differences in risk perception (69–71). These findings may also be 
explained by gender differences in use of internalizing or exter-
nalizing coping in response to stress (72). Women may have a 
more conservative threshold for perception or report of stressors. 
Similar to other socio-demographic factors, gender shapes availa-
bility, access, use, and efficacy of intra-personal and inter-personal 
resources and assets in response to stress (73). Men and women 
differently handle stress that influences resilience (73).
Race and gender also determine the risk of exposure to stress 
(74–76). Differential exposure to stress over the life course will 
influence susceptibility to stressors later in life. Black men and 
women experience high levels of exposure of racism in their daily 
lives (74), and Black women also experience sexism as a major 
stressor (74, 75). Differential vulnerability to stress across groups 
may be in part due to differential exposure to stress over the life 
course (77, 78). Such differential vulnerability has been shown by

differential cortisol profile based on race (79, 80). For instance, in 
a study, Black women showed greater stress reactivity than White 
women. More Blacks (58%) than Whites (14%) showed cortisol 
reactivity from rest to 15-min post-challenge (79). Blacks also 
have lower levels of wake-up cortisol and less steep early and late 
daily cortisol decline relative to Whites (80). Despite these race 
differences having implications for the role of SLE on depression, 
we did not find any race difference in such a link.
Gender and race may change availability, access, use, and 
effects of stress buffers, such as family (81) and religion (73). 
Regarding gender, women are better users of religiosity and social 
support in coping with stress (82, 83). Women more commonly 
use faith and family to deal with stress (84–86) and seek resilience 
through God, faith, and social support (84–89).
Literature has suggested that race, gender, and their interstations 
have implications for coping styles, including but not limited to use 
of problem-focused or emotional coping styles (90). It has been 
shown that older Black men may have higher tendency to imple-
ment adaptive coping strategies, including positive reappraisal and 
maintenance of hope and optimism (91), while Black women may 
tend toward religious coping, avoidant coping, wishful-thinking, 
seeking social support, and emotion expression (92, 93). Such race 
by gender differences in coping and cognition following stress have 
implications for resilience and stress reactivity (54).
Although our study conceptualized gender not sex as the mod-
erator of the stress–depression link, our findings are supported 
by a literature on the role of sex as a moderator of the interac-
tions between stress, genetic predisposition, and depression. For 
instance, Kurrikoff et al., who did not find a main effect of the 
5-HTTLPR genotype or the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and 
SLE on MDD documented the 5-HTTLPR × gender interaction 
on MDD in case of interpersonal SLE on MDE. The study showed 
the lowest prevalence of depression among female s′-allele carriers 
who had low levels of exposure to interpersonal adverse events. 
Authors concluded that the complex interplay between serotonin, 
social stress, and depression is sex dependent (94). Other studies 
have also shown sex differences in the links between 5-HTTLPR 
s-allele and mental health response to stressors (95, 96). In the study 
by Kurrikoff et al., men had higher depressiveness in association 
with higher exposure to interpersonal adverse events if they had 
the l′/l′ genotype (94). Other studies have also shown that males 
with the l′/l′ genotype are more sensitive to SLE (96, 97).
Our study had its own limitations. Reliability and validity of 
SLE and depression measures may depend on race and gender 
(98). As our sample was limited to survivors of the ACL who were 
under follow up for 25 years, differential attrition based on race 
and gender may have biased the results. We cannot rule out that 
our results are not due to under-reporting of stress and depres-
sion among men. Despite the fact that SES, stress, physical health, 
and health behaviors are subject to change, we did not use them as 
time-varying covariates. In addition, life event checklists may not 
be the best way to measure life events (99). Mere measurement of 
recent life events may not adequately capture variation in stress 
exposure over the life course (100, 101). Despite their limitations 
(99, 100, 102), life event inventories are still the most commonly 
used instruments for the measurement of stress exposure (103, 
104). Collecting rich contextual data on each SLE requires highly 
trained interviewers and is a labor-intensive task (28, 105).
Our study did not consider type of stressors. First and fore-
most, because current SLEs were not included in the model, and 
as we know that individuals with higher levels of SLEs at one time 
point are more likely to continue to experience SLEs, we cannot 
rule out the possibility that the effects of SLE on MD are not due 
to continuity across time in the level of SLEs. Thus, the results 
should not be interpreted as the residual effect of SLE in 1986 over 
SLE in 2011 due to lack of controlling for concurrent SLE at the 
time of outcome (2011). Second, men and women experience dif-
ferent types of SLEs, such as unemployment, child-care, domestic 
violence, and caregiving. Such gender differences may explain 
why men and women differ in the link between count of stressors

and risk of depression (106). Men and women may also differ in 
their sensitivity to particular types of stress. For instance, while 
men are more likely to experience depressive episodes following 
stress related to work, divorce, and separation, women are more 
vulnerable to other SLE, such as conflict, serious illness, or death, 
in their proximal social network (107, 108). Women may be more 
vulnerable to SLE with an interpersonal nature (42, 109), such as 
romantic and marital relationships, childrearing, and parenting 
(109). Divorce, social support, and marital satisfaction may also 
differently link to depression among men and women (110). Men 
and women also differ in rumination of stressors and negative 
thoughts (82, 83, 111–116) that has implications for the contribu-
tion of SLE to the risk of psychopathology (116). In one study, 
gender differences in rumination, stress, and mastery mediated 
gender differences in depressive symptoms (115). All these stud-
ies support conceptualization of gender as an effect modifier for 
the stress – depression link (117).
Despite the above limitations, our study makes a unique con-
tribution to the literature on race and gender differences on the 
psychological response to stress, and disparities in development 
of depression over a long period of time. Based on our find-
ings, even in the presence of the same level of stress exposure, 
long-term mental health consequences of stress may depend on 
gender (118). However, this study cannot rule out the possibility 
of under-reporting SLE and MDE among men as a contributor to 
the gender differences found in this study.
The mechanism behind gendered response to stress is still 
unclear (119). Future research is needed to understand how 
contextual factors, such as gender and race, alter the long-term 
mental health effects of exposure to similar levels of stress. Such 
research will help us better understand racial and gender differ-
ences in epidemiology of depression as one of the most common 
and disabling psychopathologies (103, 120, 121). Researchers 
should not simply assume that populations are similarly vulner-
able to social adversities. We believe that heterogenic vulnerabil-
ity and resilience may be major mechanisms behind disparities 
in the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders across populations. 
Further research is needed on gender- and race-specific media-
tors and buffers of differential vulnerability, including personality, 
attribution styles, coping, social support, and religiosity.
To conclude, gender, but not race, altered the longitudinal 
association between the baseline level of SLE (1986) and risk of 
MDE 25 years later (2011). Thus, each incremental increase in 
SLE may better predict risk of MDE 25 years later among men 
compared to women. The predictive role of SLE for long-term risk 
of MDE seems to be similar for Whites and Blacks. Additional 
research is needed on the complex links between gender, race, 
exposure to stress, and development of depression.
