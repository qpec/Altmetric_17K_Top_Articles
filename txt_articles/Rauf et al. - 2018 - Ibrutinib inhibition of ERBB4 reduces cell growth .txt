Abstract
Alterations in ERBB family members have been associated with many tumor malignancies. EGFR and ERBB2 have been
extensively explored in clinical oncology and several drugs currently target them therapeutically. However, the significance
of ERBB4 as a potential therapeutic target remains mostly unexplored, even though ERBB4 is overexpressed or mutated in
many solid tumors. Using a unique functional protein microarray platform, we found that ibrutinib inhibits ERBB4 activity
in the same nM range as its canonical target, BTK. Cell-based assays revealed that ibrutinib treatment inhibited cell growth
and decreased phosphorylation of ERBB4 and downstream targets MEK and ERK in cancer cell lines with high levels of
endogenous ERBB4. In vivo, ibrutinib-responsive mouse xenograft tumors showed decreased tumor volumes with ibrutinib
treatment. Interestingly, global gene expression comparisons between responsive and non-responsive cells identified a
signature featuring the WNT pathway that predicts growth responsiveness to ibrutinib. Non-responsive ERBB4-expressing
cell lines featured elevated activity of the WNT pathway, through the overexpression of WNT5A. Moreover, inhibition of
WNT5A expression led to an ibrutinib response in non-responsive cell lines. Our data show that inhibiting ERBB4 reduces
cell growth in cells that have low WNT5A expression and reveal a link between the ERBB4 and WNT pathways.
Introduction
Kinase inhibitors are widely used critical drugs in the
treatment of cancer. Initially designed to be selective, the
discovery of unexpected targets can offer serendipitous
benefits by broadening the potential indications for use. For
example, imatinib, originally designed as a BCR–Abl
inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, was
later determined to inhibit Kit and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor enabling its use for the treatment of gastro-
intestinal stromal tumors [1, 2]. However, given the
heterogeneity of cancer, even the successful inhibition of
the targets may not guarantee a response to the drug.
Ibrutinib, is a covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (BTK), used in the treatment of several blood-related
cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
mantle
cell
lymphoma
and
Waldenström’s
macro-
globulinemia [3, 4]. Although ibrutinib was initially
developed for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, emer-
ging data from various mouse models of cancer implies that
ibrutinib could be repurposed to treat other solid tumors [5,
6]. Several clinical trials are evaluating ibrutinib for efficacy
in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (NCT02436668),
cutaneous melanoma (NCT02581930), and non-small cell
lung cancers with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutation (NCT02321540). Ibrutinib is also reported to have
inhibitory activity on several other kinases such as ITK,
TEC, JAK3, HCK, BLK, EGFR, and ERBB2 [7–9]. This
lack of selectivity could be exploited to treat tumors beyond
BTK dependency. Strong efficacy and low toxicity of
ibrutinib suggest that other tumor types might benefit from
ibrutinib treatment if the appropriate targets could be
identified.

 Results
Screening of ibrutinib on NAPPA microarrays
revealed ERBB4 as an attractive target
We screened kinase inhibitors in high throughput using our
protein microarray platform nucleic acid programmable
protein array (NAPPA) displaying 108 protein kinases and
30 non-kinases (Table S1). In NAPPA, complementary
DNAs encoding the genes of interest are expressed in situ
using human ribosomes and chaperone proteins, and the
freshly expressed proteins are immobilized onto the array
surface by a tag-specific antibody (Fig. 1a). To ensure array
quality and batch reproducibility, sample arrays were tested
for DNA levels and protein levels (Fig. 1b) revealing batch-
to-batch reproducibility of r2 ≥ 0.91 (Fig. S1 and Table S2).
Incubating these phosphatase-treated kinase arrays with or
without added ATP during the kinase reaction followed by
anti-pTyr antibody allowed the identification of a number of
autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases (TKs), confirming that
the proteins on the array were active and could be used for
functional screenings (Fig. 1b). Proteins without TK activity
(e.g., p27 and CDK2) showed no increase in phosphoryla-
tion after the reaction (Table S5).
To test whether NAPPA was suitable for screening
kinase inhibitors, we measured the kinase activity in arrays
treated with staurosporine (0.1–10 μM). As expected, the
overall kinase activity decreased, in a dose-dependent
manner, for nearly all autophosphorylated TK present on
the array (Fig S2, Table S3). Next, imatinib was used to test
selective kinase inhibition. A significant reduction in Abl1
and BCR–Abl1 activity was observed in imatinib-treated
arrays; whereas, the other kinases remained mostly unaf-
fected (Figs. 1c, d, Table S4). Taken together, our data
suggest that this protein microarray platform could be used
for the unbiased screening of TK inhibitors.
Next, we focused on ibrutinib and screened NAPPA
arrays to identify potential new targets. Among the TKs, the
two with the strongest inhibition by ibrutinib were its
cognate target, BTK and V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic
leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ERBB4), a member of
the EGFR family (Figs. 2a, b, Fig. S3, Table S5). A
radionucleotide kinase assay showed that 1 µM of ibrutinib
inhibited the activity of both BTK and ERBB4 by >80%,
whereas Abl1 (negative control) was 100% active at the
same drug concentration (Fig. S4). Next, active site-
dependent competition binding assays measured the bind-
ing affinities (Kd) between ibrutinib and BTK, ERBB4,
ITK, and Abl1 as 0.64, 2, 43. and 1100 nM, respectively
(Fig. 2c). As the Kd values for the inhibition of ERBB4 and
BTK were observed in the same nM range, we regarded
ERBB4 as a potential target of ibrutinib in vivo.

 Ibrutinib impedes growth of some ERBB4-
dependent cells
To assess whether the inhibition of ERBB4 by ibrutinib
affected cell growth, we used the microarray-based gene
expression profile of 1035 cancer cell lines from the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database to select a panel
of eleven cell lines expressing high levels of ERBB4 and
undetectable levels of BTK, ERBB4High/BTKLow, and two
cell lines with undetectable levels of both ERBB4 and BTK,
ERBB4Low/BTKLow (Fig. S5). The predicted ERBB4 and
BTK protein levels of each cell line was confirmed by
western blot (Fig. S6). Cells were treated with 1 µM ibru-
tinib for 6 days and the number of viable cells was mea-
sured by Trypan blue assay (Fig. 3a). As expected, no
response was observed for ERBB4Low/BTKLow cell lines.
However, interestingly, ERBB4High/BTKLow cells presented
a wide range of ibrutinib response from no effect (H146) to
a marked reduction (H661 and H716) in viable cell counts
after the drug treatment. A small increase in cell death was
observed in some cell lines after the treatment with ibruti-
nib; however, the percentage of cell death was too small,

 <20%, to be the main effect of ibrutinib (Fig. S7). This
result was reminiscent of the findings for ibrutinib-treated
CLL and multiple myeloma patients’ cells driven by BTK,
where in drug doses up to 1 µM, accentuated cell death was
not prominent [10, 11].
Ibrutinib-responsive cell lines (H522, H661, and KLE)
and control cell lines (A549 and MDA-MB-231) were
further tested with different concentrations of ibrutinib (Fig.
3b, Fig. S8). Control cells showed inhibition only at 10 µM,
possibly due to nonspecific toxicity and IC50s of 6.7 μM
(A549) and 8.4 μM (MDA-MD-231). In contrast, all
responsive cell lines showed a significant dose-dependent
inhibition of cell proliferation at concentrations as low as
100 nM, with IC50s of 58 nM (H661), 84 nM (KLE) and
580 nM (H522). The responses in these cells occurred
within the same concentration range as that previously
observed for a BTK-driven response [10, 11]. At the protein
level, ibrutinib induced a decrease in the phosphorylation
levels of ERBB4, without changes in total protein levels
(Fig. 3c). Notably, reduced phosphorylated forms were also
observed
for
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
kinase
(MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) three key downstream
proteins in the ERBB4 pathway, suggesting a decrease in
the activity of ERBB4 and ERBB4-induced pathways.
Furthermore, to assess whether EGFR or ERBB2 inhibition
contributes to the therapeutic effect of ibrutinib in sensitive
cell lines, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock-
down EGFR or ERBB2. Even without EGFR or ERRB2,
these cells showed an ibrutinib response similar to the
parental cells and clearly inhibited the activity of ERBB4
and its downstream partners MEK, ERK, and AKT (Fig.
S9, Fig. S10, Fig. S11).
To determine if ERBB4 inhibition could reduce cell
growth, we infected ibrutinib-responsive cell lines with
shRNAs targeting ERBB4. Three distinct hairpins were
used and each promoted a strong decrease in ERBB4
protein levels (Fig. 3d). The shRNAs were designed to be
specific to ERBB4 and do not cross react with other
members of the EGFR family, as shown by western blot
(Fig. 3e). Cell proliferation assays showed that cells infec-
ted with shERBB4 had a decreased growth ratio similar to
what was observed in parental cells treated with ibrutinib
(Fig. 3f). Together, these experiments suggest that ibrutinib
inhibits ERBB4 and can reduce growth rates in some cells
with high levels of ERBB4. Moreover, as the cell lines
chosen for this study derive from distinct tissues, the inhi-
bition observed was not tissue specific. To determine
whether differential response observed in vitro would
remain true in vivo, we assessed the ability of ibrutinib to
reduce tumor growth of H661 mouse xenografts. When a
daily dose of (5 mg/kg) was administered H661 xenografts
showed a decrease in tumor volume as compared with
untreated tumors (Fig. 3g). We observed the same trend
when we administered H661 xenografts with a low dose of
ibrutinib (Fig. S12). Moreover, non-responsive 1321N1
mouse xenografts did not show any reduction in tumor
growth with ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S12).
Next, we focused on the differential responsiveness to
ibrutinib among cells with elevated levels of ERBB4. No
correlations between ibrutinib response and relative ERBB4
abundance, phosphorylation levels or levels of ERBB4
cleavable intracellular domain, a molecule with transcrip-
tion activity associated with increased cell proliferation
[12], were observed (Fig. S13). Recently, ibrutinib was
associated with inhibition of EGFR and ERBB2 [13], so we
measured the total and phosphorylated levels of endogenous
EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3, but found no correlations with
drug response (Fig. S14). These results raised the possibility
that other interacting pathways might modulate ibrutinib
responsiveness.
Elevated WNT pathway activity in ERBB4-positive
cell lines is associated with ibrutinib resistance
As the levels of ERBB4 and other EGFR family members
could not explain the differential responsiveness to ibruti-
nib, we examined the gene expression profiles of ibrutinib-
responsive and non-responsive cells and searched for gene
signatures that might associate with ibrutinib sensitivity.
The mRNA expression levels of untreated cells under nor-
mal growth conditions were measured by a 2 × 100 bp
paired-end RNA-Seq on Illumina HiSeq-2000 sequencer.
After sequence alignment and expression estimation, we
performed
a
two-group
comparison
using
the
non-
parametric Mann–Whitney U-test and selected a pool of
401 differentially expressed genes with P-values < 0.05
(Table S6). These genes effectively clustered ibrutinib-
responsive and non-responsive cells into two separate
groups (Fig. S15), and thus were potentially associated with

 the responsiveness to ibrutinib in ERBB4High/BTKLow can-
cer cell lines.
To identify biological processes that may govern the
ibrutinib responsiveness, pathway analysis was performed
on the differentially expressed genes, based on information
in public pathway databases. After removing redundant
pathway terms, 23 signaling pathways were found sig-
nificantly dysregulated (Table S7), which included inter-
feron, G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors,
growth factor receptors (including ERBB4), and WNT
signaling pathways. As these pathways were similarly
altered in cell lines from different cancer types (lung,
endometrial, colon, ovarian, and astrocytoma), their con-
tribution to ibrutinib resistance appears to be independent of
tissue origin. In parallel, individual differentially expressed
genes were manually annotated for their known functions
based on the literature. Notably, among the top 42 differ-
entially expressed genes, 5 genes (Dickkopf WNT signaling
pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1), GPC3, SLC40A1, RGS3, and
Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 5A
(WNT5A)) were associated with the WNT pathway (Table
S8).
To verify the findings from our RNA-Seq data in the
ibrutinib-responsive and non-responsive cell lines, we used
the CCLE microarray data set as independent gene
expression data to compare gene expression in the same
eight cell lines. Among the 401 differentially expressed
genes we previously identified, 46 also correctly classified
the cells into ibrutinib-responsive and non-responsive
groups using the CCLE data (Mann–Whitney test P <
0.05, Table S9). Like our own gene expression data, WNT-
related genes were highly enriched (Fisher’s exact test P =
8.9E-04, Table 1, Table S9), including WNT5A, DKK1,
TBL1XR1, and TLE2. This strongly suggested that the WNT
pathway plays a key role in ibrutinib resistance in
ERBB4High/BTKLow cancer cell lines.
The WNT pathway regulates diverse signal transduction
events triggered by the extracellular WNT protein, playing
important roles in tumor growth and metastasis [14, 15].
From our RNA-Seq data, examination of gene expression of
WNT pathway network members revealed that several
WNT ligands (WNT5A, WNT3, and WNT7A), WNT reg-
ulators (DKK1 and GPC3), signaling molecules (GNB1,
GNG11,
and
CSNK2A2),
protein
sorting/processing
(VPS26A, VPS35, PSMD10, AMER1, and CUL3), and
transcriptional regulators (SMARCA4, TLE2, and histones)
were differentially expressed between ibrutinib-responsive
and non-responsive cells (Fig. 4a). Importantly, as shown in
Table S8, WNT5A was upregulated, and DKK1 (an inhibitor
of WNT pathway) was downregulated in ibrutinib non-
responsive cells, indicating a synergistic elevation of the
WNT pathway activity in ibrutinib non-responsive cells.
Confirming the differential expression levels at the protein
level, western blotting showed that abundances of WNT5A
and DKK1 proteins correlated with their mRNA levels (Fig.
4b).
DKK1/WNT5A signatures predict ibrutinib response
In addition to providing biological insight on ERBB4
function in cancer, the newly identified association between
the WNT pathway and ibrutinib resistance prompted us to
propose a molecular signature for prediction of ibrutinib
responsiveness. With 46 genes that correctly classified
ibrutinib-responsive and non-responsive cells in both RNA-
Seq and CCLE data, we performed a logistic regression
coupled with cross-validation-based feature selection and
identified the 10 most informative genes, which included
DKK1 and WNT5A. Therefore, along with the logistic
regression classifiers, we tested a simple gene expression
signature based on the relative ratio of these two genes (i.e.,
DKK1 level divided by WNT5A level), which was sufficient
to classify ibrutinib-responsive and non-responsive cells. In
our RNA-Seq data, all responsive cell lines showed DKK1/
WNT5A ratios >1.0, whereas all non-responsive cell lines
had DKK1/WNT5A ratios <1.0 (Table S10). Furthermore,
the ratios were strongly correlated (Pearson’s R = −0.80)
with the number of viable cells after a 24-h treatment of 1
µM ibrutinib. In addition, the DKK1/WNT5A ratios in the
eight cell lines compared in the CCLE data were highly
comparable to our RNA-Seq data (Pearson’s R = 0.98,
Table S10), and classified the cells into ibrutinib-responsive
and non-responsive groups with a strong negative correla-
tion to the number of viable cells after ibrutinib treatment
(Pearson’s R = −0.90, Table S10).
To further validate these results, we used our signature to
select seven additional ERBB4High/BTKLow cell lines from
the CCLE database, three cell lines with a low DKK1/
WNT5A ratio and predicted to be non-responsive to ibru-
tinib (SK-N-MC, A673, U-118 MG) and four cell lines with
high DKK1/WNT5A ratio and predicted to be responsive
(Calu-3, HCC1419, HuTu80, 22Rv1), and tested them for
drug response. Protein levels for the cell lines were con-
firmed by western blot (Fig. 5a). All three cell lines with
low DKK1/WNT5A ratio showed no response to ibrutinib
treatment up to 1 µM and inhibition in cell proliferation with
an IC50 of 3 µM for U-118 MG, 4 µM for A673 and 7 µM
for SK-N-MC (Fig. 5b and Fig. S16). Conversely, three cell
lines (out of four) with high DKK1/WNT5A ratio were
responsive to ibrutinib with IC50s of 10 nM for HCC1419,
50 nM for Calu-3 and 800 nM for HuTu80. The only outlier
was the 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cell that had a higher
DKK1/WNT5A ratio and a responsive signature based on
the logistic regression classifier, which showed resistance to

(IC50,

Studies
have
shown
that
22Rv1 cells are resistant to a broad spectrum of che-
motherapeutics mainly because of the overexpression of
ABCG2, a protein that contributes to multi-drug resistance
[16], which might explain the ibrutinib resistance observed
in our experiments. Taken together, 6 out of 7 newly tested
cell lines (and 14 of 15 cell lines overall) validated the
responsiveness of ibrutinib based on the DKK1/WNT5A
signature
in
ERBB4High/BTKLow
cells
indicating
the
applicability of this signature to predict response for ibru-
tinib inhibition of cell growth.
To further explore the relationship between WNT5A and
ibrutinib resistance, we assessed whether reducing WNT5A
levels would make resistant cell lines more responsive to
ibrutinib. Stable cell lines were generated for 132N1 and
A673 cells after knockdown with four different independent
shRNAs against WNT5A. As shown in Figs. 6a, b, two out
of the four shRNAs effectively reduced WNT5A levels.
These cells were subsequently treated with different doses
of ibrutinib for a period of 6 days. Compared with the
control, WNT5A-reduced cells acquired sensitivity to
ibrutinib around 500 nM. In addition, we also performed the
reciprocal experiments on the ibrutinib-responsive cells by
supplementing H522 and H661 cells with conditioned
media from WNT5A-secreting cells and subsequently
treating with ibrutinib (Fig. S17). The addition of WNT5A-
conditioned media increased the resistance towards ibruti-
nib. These data further strengthen the role of WNT pathway
in determining the sensitivity to ibrutinib response in
ERBB4-expressing cells.
We were curious if any human tumors occur with high
levels of ERBB4 and an ibrutinib-responsive signature. We
used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Seq data on
25 different cancer types. With a cutoff of 1.0 FPKM
(fragments per kilobase million) among the total of 8281
tumor samples, 3292 samples expressed ERBB4. The
DKK1/WNT5A ratio was then applied to classify the
ERBB4-positive
samples
into
ibrutinib-responsive-like
(DKK1/WNT5A ≥ 2.0),
ibrutinib-non-responsive-like
(DKK1/WNT5A ≤ 0.5),
and
neutral
(0.5 < DKK1/
WNT5A < 2.0) groups (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, although
ovarian cancer samples were mostly (90%) ERBB4 posi-
tive, as recently reported [17], the majority had ibrutinib-
non-responsive signatures, suggesting an elevated level of
WNT signaling as previously reported [18]. Among more
prevalent cancer types, 35–45% of samples from low-grade
glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, and breast carcinoma
were classified to have either responsive-like or neutral
signatures and thus may be consistent with ibrutinib
responsiveness.

platform for the generation of protein microarrays that can

 biomarkers for several diseases, including cancer and dia-
betes [19, 20]. Here we show for the first time that NAPPA
arrays can be used for the study of protein kinases and for
the screening of kinase inhibitors. The main advantage of
NAPPA is the flexibility that comes from the expression of
the proteins from cDNAs printed on the array. Any cDNA
can be printed on the arrays, and therefore any protein can
be studied, including mutant versions of relevant proteins.
The ibrutinib target ERBB4 is a transmembrane TK, and
a member of the EGFR family, associated with the reg-
ulation of key pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
AKT and focal adhesion kinase [21, 22]. Recent reports
have shown EGFR family members as new targets for

 ibrutinib. For ibrutinib inhibition of TKs, a cysteine located
in the kinase hinge segment is crucial [23]. Among
numerous TKs encoded in the human genome, 14 TKs
share this conserved cysteine residue including EGFR,
ERBB2, and ERBB4 [23]. Some studies have focused on
utilizing ibrutinib to target EGFR and ERBB2, the two most
studied members in the EGFR family [13]. On the contrary,
ERBB4 largely remains unexplored in clinical oncology as
a potential target. Multiple studies have reported activating
mutations in ERBB4 in melanoma and lung cancer [24].
Altered expression of ERBB4 has been observed in breast
cancer, neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and
colon cancer [13, 25, 26]. Overexpression of ERBB4 is
associated with increased metastatic potential in Ewing’s
sarcoma [27], poor prognosis in triple-negative breast can-
cer [28], and drug resistance in ovarian cancers [29]. Even
though many of the drugs targeting the EGFR family can
potentially inhibit ERBB4, no systematic studies were
performed to address this. Here, we present ibrutinib as a
potent ERBB4 inhibitor whose activity inhibited the growth
of a number of ERBB4-dependent cell lines in vitro and
in vivo.
We could not explain the differential response to ibruti-
nib observed in our cell panel by the level of total or
phosphorylated forms of ERBB4, EGFR, ERBB2, or
ERBB3, suggesting alternative pathways or mechanisms are
responsible for the observed differences in drug response.
However, in our RNA-seq data, as well as CCLE micro-
array data set, an independent data source, we observed
strong enrichment and differential expression of WNT
pathway genes in responsive and non-responsive cells.
Based on the newly discovered association with the WNT
pathway, we proposed and validated a gene expression
signature based on the relative mRNA expression levels of
two genes, DKK1 and WNT5A, to predict the response for
ibrutinib in ERBB4-expressing tumors. Growth suppression
occurred specifically in cells with high DKK1/WNT5A
ratio, both in cells and in vivo, whereas cells expressing
more WNT5A than DKK1 were resistant to ibrutinib treat-
ment. Based on the ongoing studies in our lab, we suspect
bypass signaling pathways may contribute toward ibrutinib
resistance.
For
instance,
the
ibrutinib
non-responsive
1321N1 cell line, which does not harbor any ERBB4
mutations, shows reduction in phospho ERBB4 levels (data
not shown) when treated with ibrutinib, despite no reduced
cell/tumor growth in both our cell-based and in vivo mod-
els. Our studies show decreasing the WNT5A expression
makes the non-responsive cells more sensitive to ibrutinib
treatment, but the mechanism of resistance is yet to be
elucidated.
Although the WNT pathway may modulate the effect of
ERBB4 inhibition on cell growth, connections between
these two pathways have not been studied. Other ERBB
members are known to inactivate glycogen synthase kinase
3, a key WNT pathway component, through direct phos-
phorylation by AKT [30]. If this held for ERBB4, it would
place WNT downstream of, and thus epistatic on, ERBB4.
Alternatively, ERBB4 may signal via ERK/LRP6 [31].

Ibrutinib inhibition of ERBB4 reduces cell growth

 ERBB receptors may employ ERK to activate WNT sig-
naling by phosphorylating LRP6, a WNT co-receptor,
which binds to numerous WNT ligands. Indirectly, ERBB4
and WNT pathways may crosstalk through the transcrip-
tional regulation of key proteins present in each pathway.
Many other mechanisms may exist for the interaction of
ERBB4 with both canonical and non-canonical WNT sig-
naling, and future studies are needed to elucidate the exact
mechanism.
In conclusion, we show that ERBB4 is an attractive
target for ibrutinib using a functional protein microarray
platform
NAPPA.
We
demonstrated
that
ERBB4-
expressing cells respond to ibrutinib in a WNT pathway
dependent manner. We further show that inhibiting certain
WNT activating ligands assist in increasing the response for
ibrutinib. Our results raise the possibility that ibrutinib can
be used as a drug beyond B-cell malignancies to treat
ERBB4-expressing cancers, either by itself or as a combi-
nation with WNT inhibitors.

 Materials and methods
Nucleic acid programmable protein array
NAPPA kinase microarrays were generated with virtually
all protein–TKs from the human genome. The coding
sequence for each TK was cloned into an expression plas-
mid and immobilized on the microarray surface, with one
protein kinase per feature. Briefly, NAPPA printing mix
was prepared with plasmid DNA coding for genes of
interest, anti-flag antibody, cross-linker, and poly-lysine.
Samples
were
printed
in
quadruplicate
in
aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides.
Before kinase expression NAPPA arrays were blocked
for 1 h at room temperature (RT) using Superblock solution
(Pierce), and then dried with filtered air. The slides were
covered with HybriWells and protein expression was per-
formed by injection of 160 µL human cell-free expression
into the chamber. Slides were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C
and 30 min at 15 °C, followed by 1 h of blocking with
TBSTB (1X Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2%
Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin). The levels of
protein expression were assayed with anti-Flag antibody
followed by secondary antibodies labeled with cy3. Before
the kinase assay, the slides were treated with lambda
phosphatase and DNASe for 1 h to remove any phosphor-
ylation that occurred during protein expression. Next, arrays
were washed with TBST to remove the phosphatase and the
kinase reaction was initiated with kinase buffer (25 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 2 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2) with
ATP (500 µM) in the presence or absence of kinase inhi-
bitors.The kinase activity on the array was measured with
antiphosphotyrosine antibody followed by secondary anti-
bodies labeled with cy3. All antibody incubations were
performed in a 1:1000 dilution in TBSTB at RT. NAPPA
arrays were scanned with a PowerScanner and the signal
intensity was quantified using the Array-ProAnalyzer 6.3,
using the default settings. The median intensity across the
quadruplicates was measured and the background was
corrected through the subtraction of the median value of the
negative controls.
NAPPA data analysis
The data were normalized using positive control features
present in each array. The signal obtained in the microarray
treated with kinase inhibitor was interpolated in the curve
obtained from arrays treated with buffer only (lower phos-
phorylation level—0%) or treated with ATP and dime-
thylsulfoxide (DMSO; maximum phosphorylation level—
100%).
Radioactive kinase assay
Purified protein kinases were incubated with radioactive
ATP and increasing concentrations of kinase inhibitors. The
kinase activity was measured through the levels of radio-
active phosphorylation present in each kinase.
Active site-dependent competition binding assay
Soluble protein kinases tagged with a DNA tag were
incubated with an affinity column in the presence of
increasing concentration of kinase inhibitor. The amount of
kinase bound to the column is proportional to the kinase
activity and it was measured by quantitative PCR.
Mammalian cell culture
The cell lines NCI-H661, NCI-H522, NCI-146, KLE,
Caov4, NCI-H716, HuTu80, HCC 1419, Calu-3, 22Rv1, U-
118MG, A-673, SK-N-MC, MDA-MB-231, A549, K-562,

(cat. no. C0026001) from AddexBio and OVKATE and
OVSAHO from the Japanese Collection of Research Bior-
esources (JCRB) Cell Bank. All cells were tested for
mycoplasma contamination before use with the Universal
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC 30-1012K).
Whole-cell extract preparation and western blotting
Cells were lysed in the cell lysis buffer (50 mmol/L of Tris-
HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1%
sodium azide, 1 mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 tablet
of protease inhibitor (Roche)). The total protein content was
measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the
proteins
were
separated
on
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the
Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The
primary antibodies were used according to the product

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded on six-well plates 24 h prior to kinase
inhibitor treatment. The next day, each well was treated
with different concentrations of ibrutinib (1 nM, 10 nM,
100 nM, 1 µM and 10 µM) along with DMSO as a control.
The cell media were replaced every other day with fresh
ibrutinib containing media and the cultures were continued
for 6 days. The live cells were counted by Cell Titer Glow
(Promega) or Trypan blue assay. All experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. All
data were analyzed using GraphPad 7 (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA, USA), expressed as mean ± S.E.M. P-value of
<0.05 were considered significant in all studies.
Crystal violet stain
Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed
for 1 h at RT in fixing solution (10% acetic acid and 10%
methanol in water). The fixing solution was removed and
0.5% crystal violet was added to the cells and incubated
over-night at RT. Excess stain was removed by washing
with water and the plates were dried and imaged.
shRNA-mediated knockdown
shRNA control and shRNAs against ERBB4, EGFR,
ERBB2, and WNT5A were obtained from DNASU (https://
dnasu.org). 293LX cells were transfected with each shRNA
and lentiviral particles were collected. For ERBB4 knock-
down, NCI-H522, KLE, and NCI-H661 were plated in six-
well plates and allowed to attach over-night. The cells were
infected with respective ERBB4 shRNA-encoding lenti-
virus along with control shRNAs. Cells infected with each
shRNA were selected with 0.5 µg/mL of puromycin for
6 days. The number of viable cells was counted by Trypan
blue exclusion assay with the countess automated cell
counter (Invitrogen). For EGFR and ERBB2 knockdown,
NCI-H661 and KLE cells were infected with corresponding
shRNAs and selected with 0.6 µg/mL puromycin to create
stable cell lines. For WNT5A knockdown, 132N1 and A673
cells were infected with WNT5A shRNAs and selected with
0.6 µg/mL puromycin to create stable cell lines.
WNT5A assay
WNT5A-secreting media and control condition media were
obtained from culturing L Wnt-5A (ATCC), and L cells
(ATCC) according to ATCC recommendation. The pre-
sence of WNT5A in secreted media were confirmed by
western blot. H522 and H661 cells supplemented with
WNT5A or L condition media were seeded on six-well
plates 24 h prior to ibrutinib treatment. The next day, each
well was treated with different concentrations of ibrutinib
(100 nM, 1 µM) along with DMSO and untreated cells as
controls. The cell media were replaced every other day with
fresh ibrutinib containing media conditioned with WNT5A
or L and the cultures were continued for 6 days. The live
cells were counted by Trypan blue assay. All experiments
were performed in triplicate and repeated at least on 2
independent days.
Tumor xenograft studies
Seven weeks old NOD-SCID mice were injected with 1 ×
106 H661 cells or 1321N1 cells subcutaneously in the flank
with a volume of 100 µl of 1:1 culture media and Matrigel.
Each group had three females and seven males with n = 10
per group, for which the sample size was determined by a
power analysis with an estimated effect size of 1.0. After
about 2 weeks after injection, animals were treated daily
with ibrutinib (5 mg/kg, 2% DMSO in castor oil) or buffer
only by oral delivery into mouth. Tumor xenografts were
measured with a digital caliper, and the tumor volumes were
determined by (length × width2)/2. Tumor volumes are
plotted as mean ± SEM, and P-value of <0.05 based on
both T-test and Mann–Whitney U-test were considered
significant. At the end of the experiment, mice were
euthanized with CO2. Mice were maintained in accordance
with Arizona State University Institutional Animal Care
Guidelines (IACUC Protocol #: 14-1370R). The mice were
randomized for treatment, with investigator blinded for
tumor measurements.
RNA-seq
RNA
from
ibrutinib-responsive
and
ibrutinib
non-
responsive cell lines was obtained with RNA easy (Qia-
gen) and the samples were sequenced using Illumina
HiSeq2000. The sequence reads were aligned to the
Ensembl human genome by the TopHat/bowtie2 software,
and the aligned read counts were quantified and normalized
against gene sizes and the number of reads by the cufflinks
software. Genes (excluding anti-sense RNA and pseudo-
genes) with FPKM higher than 1 in any of the eight samples
tested (four ibrutinib-responsive and four non-responsive
2248
F. Rauf et al.
 cell lines) were used for further analysis. Using as cutoff a
fold change of 1.5 and P-value < 0.05 in two-tailed
Mann–Whitney tests, a set of 401 distinct genes was
obtained.
