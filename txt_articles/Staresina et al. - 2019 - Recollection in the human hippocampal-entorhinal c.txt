Imagine how flicking through your photo album and seeing a picture of a beach sunset brings
back fond memories of a tasty cocktail you had that night. Computational models suggest
that upon receiving a partial memory cue (‘beach’), neurons in the hippocampus coordinate
reinstatement of associated memories (‘cocktail’) in cortical target sites. Here, using human
single neuron recordings, we show that hippocampal firing rates are elevated from
~ 500–1500 ms after cue onset during successful associative retrieval. Concurrently, the
retrieved target object can be decoded from population spike patterns in adjacent entorhinal
cortex (EC), with hippocampal firing preceding EC spikes and predicting the fidelity of EC
object reinstatement. Prior to orchestrating reinstatement, a separate population of hippo-
campal neurons distinguishes different scene cues (buildings vs. landscapes). These results
elucidate the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit dynamics for memory recall and reconcile dis-
parate views on the role of the hippocampus in scene processing vs. associative memory.

 M
emory is central to adaptive behaviour across species1.
Despite concerted efforts, however, it is still unclear
how we are able to retrieve a rich memory trace of past
experiences after receiving a simple reminder cue (‘episodic
memory’). Converging evidence points to a critical role of the
medial temporal lobe (MTL), most notably the hippocampus, for
intact episodic memory2. Based on the seminal discovery of
hippocampal place cells coordinating spatial navigation in
rodents3,4, one prominent view of the human hippocampus
emphasizes a dedicated role in spatial/scene perception and scene
construction5–7. Classic computational models and human neu-
ropsychological work, on the other hand, have highlighted
mnemonic operations such as associative/relational memory
formation and retrieval as well as pattern completion8–11. Pattern
completion denotes a process through which hippocampal ‘index
cells’—upon receiving a partial memory cue—coordinate rein-
statement of mnemonic representations in cortical target sites,
particularly in entorhinal cortex (EC), the first cortical recipient
of hippocampal output12,13. While constituting the backbone of
episodic memory theory, evidence for a role of hippocampal
neurons in coordinating cortical reinstatement during associative
memory
retrieval
has
been
lacking.
Some
rodent
studies
employed simultaneous recordings from hippocampus and EC,
but primarily focused on these regions’ respective contributions
to spatial navigation14,15. Owing to technical challenges pertain-
ing
to
multi-site
recordings,
nonhuman
primate
electro-
physiological recordings have focused either on the hippocampus
or EC in isolation, without examining cross-regional dynamics16–
18. Moreover, the question remains whether the human capacity
of single-trial learning and the phenomenology of vivid recol-
lection can easily be translated to experimental paradigms in
these species. Conversely, human whole-brain neuroimaging only
allows for indirect measures of neuronal activity, with spatio-
temporal imprecision further impeding detection of fine-tuned
hippocampal-cortical dynamics.
Here we capitalised on the rare opportunity to record action
potentials from individual neurons in the human hippocampus
and EC while participants (n = 16) performed alternating blocks
of associative and nonassociative memory tasks (Fig. 1). In the
nonassociative memory (NAM) task, participants saw scene
images depicting buildings or landscapes during the study phase
(encoding). During the test phase (retrieval), the same scene
images were intermixed with novel scenes, and participants
indicated whether or not they had seen the image during
encoding, yielding two conditions of interest: HIT (correct
identification of an old image) and Correct Rejection (CR; correct
identification of a new image). In the associative memory (AM)
task, participants again saw trial-unique scene images from the
same building/landscape set during encoding. Superimposed on
the given scene was a grey square including one of two object
images. The choice of object images was customized for each
experimental session based on a preceding screening session to
identify response-eliciting stimuli (see Methods). At retrieval,
participants saw the same scene images without the objects and
indicated which of the two objects had been paired with the given
scene, yielding the memory outcomes of correct Associative
Memory (AM+) and incorrect as well as “don’t know” responses
(the latter two referred to as AM−).
We show that hippocampal firing rates increase shortly after
cue presentation in both the nonassociative scene recognition task
and the associative scene-object recall task. Importantly, firing
rates are sustained from ~ 500 to 1500 ms for successful asso-
ciative retrieval (AM+) only. At the same time, the successfully
retrieved target object can be decoded from population spike
patterns in adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC). Of note, individual
hippocampal spikes precede EC spikes during AM+ and the rate
of hippocampal firing predicts the strength of object reinstate-
ment in EC. Critically, before orchestrating object reinstatement
in EC, a separate population of hippocampal neurons distin-
guishes different scene cue types (buildings vs. landscapes) in
both tasks (NAM and AM). These results reconcile competing
models of hippocampal function (scene processing vs. associative
memory) and elucidate the hippocampal-entorhinal
circuit
dynamics in service of human memory recall.
Results
Behavioural Results. In the nonassociative memory (NAM) task,
participants correctly recognized old images for 89% of trials
(±2% SEM, HITs) and correctly identified new images for 90% of
trials (±2% SEM, CRs). In the associative memory task, partici-
pants remembered the correct target object for an average of 79%
of trials (±3% SEM, AM+), indicated the wrong target object for
20% (±3% SEM) and indicated they did not know the answer on
the remaining 1% of trials (AM−). For both tasks, the HIT minus
FA (NAM) and Correct minus Incorrect (AM) rate was sig-
nificantly greater than zero (both t(15) > 11, P < .001), confirming
high retrieval accuracies in both tasks.
Hippocampal engagement during memory retrieval. Our first
analysis focused on the hippocampus, where we recorded from
238 neurons in the anterior portion across the 16 participants
(Fig. 2a; M ± SEM per participant: 14.9 ± 2.6 neurons). To
determine whether and when hippocampal neurons might show
preferential engagement for associative vs. nonassociative mem-
ory retrieval, we compared time-resolved spike rates for AM+
(associative) vs. HITs and CRs (nonassociative). As shown in
Fig. 2b, hippocampal firing rates rapidly increased after ~200 ms
post stimulus onset, with a peak at ~500 ms. Critically, while
firing rates returned to baseline levels for NAM HITs and CRs
thereafter,
AM+
trials
showed
sustained
levels
of
firing
until ~1500 ms. A time-resolved one-way repeated-measures
ANOVA with the factor condition (AM+, HITs, CRs) revealed
a
significant
effect
from
900 ms–1300 ms
post
cue
onset
(Pcluster = .010, corrected for multiple comparisons across time19),
which subsidiary contrasts confirmed to reflect increased firing
rates for AM+ compared to both HITs and CRs (both t(237) > =
2.85, P < = .005), with no difference between the latter two
(t(237) = 0.46, P = .637) (Fig. 2b, inset). Within the same time
window, we observed a relative increase in hippocampal firing
rates for AM+ vs. AM−, unfolding at ~700 ms after cue onset
(Pcluster = .002, Fig. 2c). These results pinpoint a hippocampal
process specifically deployed for associative retrieval (above and
beyond scene recognition) emerging at ~500 ms post cue onset.
Figure 2d shows a single neuron example of raw spike trains for
AM+ and NAM HIT trials and the corresponding time courses
resulting from their convolution. Memory results for EC are
shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Memory-driven object reinstatement in entorhinal cortex.
Models of pattern completion predict that the hippocampus
coordinates reinstatement of memory content in cortical sites via
EC9,12,13. We thus examined whether the identity of the suc-
cessfully retrieved target object could be decoded based on
population codes in EC, where we recorded from 211 neurons
across our 16 participants (M ± SEM per participant: 13.2 ± 1.6
neurons). EC has previously been linked to object representations
in rodents20 and humans21, particularly in its anterior/lateral
portion from which we recorded here (Fig. 3a).
In a first step, we confirmed that object identity could be
reliably decoded from EC population codes during learning. For
each participant, we trained a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

 classifier to distinguish between the two objects. The feature
vectors consisted of the activity of a given participant’s EC
neurons in response to each of the two objects, which was first
averaged across the entire 3 s stimulus presentation and z-scored
across trials. Decoding performance was derived via five-fold
cross-validation and statistically evaluated against surrogate
decoding performance, created by shuffling the training labels
100 times and averaging the resulting performance values to
provide, for each participant, a single baseline value under the
null hypothesis of label
exchangeability22. Results showed
decoding performance significantly exceeding chance by 12.94%
(SEM = 3.58%) across participants (t(15) = 3.62, P = .003 vs.
surrogates). This indicates that EC population codes were indeed
able to distinguish the two object stimuli in our paradigm. Note
that no object decodability was observed in hippocampus in this
paradigm (t(15) = 0.96, P = .350 vs. surrogates; Supplementary
Figure 2 and Discussion).
Next,
we
assessed
whether
and
when
encoding-related
population codes might get reinstated during successful associa-
tive retrieval. To this end, we again trained the LDA classifier to
discriminate between object 1 and object 2 based on all AM
encoding trials, but did so in a time-resolved manner and then
applied the training parameters to the AM+ retrieval data (where
objects were retrieved but not shown), again in a time-resolved
manner. Specifically, for both encoding and retrieval data, a
sliding window of 500 ms was moved across the trial in 10 ms
steps from −.5 to 3 s relative to stimulus onset. Within each
window, spike trains were averaged across time and z-scored
across trials. The resulting time-by-time matrix thus indicates
whether successful retrieval reinstates object encoding patterns
and if so, which encoding time windows are most readily
reinstated. As shown in Fig. 3b, results revealed evidence for
reinstatement of the target object from ~600 to 1500 ms post
stimulus onset during AM+ retrieval, where encoding patterns
from ~1000 to 2000 ms were reinstated. Importantly, this
reinstatement effect was not only significantly greater than
chance performance (tested against surrogates as described
above), but also significantly greater than AM− reinstatement
(Fig. 3b), thus linking reinstatement to memory behaviour. Again,
no such reinstatement effects were observed in hippocampus.
It deserves explicit mention that the reinstatement analysis
described thus far performed decoding in each participant
individually and then assessed the reliability of decodability
across participants. However, we also sought to obtain converging
evidence for target object reinstatement across all neurons (i.e.
pooling across participants). To this end, the discriminability of
object 1 vs. object 2 in a given neuron during AM+ retrieval was
compared to the discriminability of object 1 vs. object 2 in the
same neuron during all AM encoding trials. Discriminability was
quantified as the t statistic resulting from comparison of all object
1 trials vs. all object 2 trials for a given neuron (again with the
averaged 0–3 sec spike trains per trial as dependent variables).
Results revealed a significant positive correlation for AM+ trials
(Spearman r = .19, P = .006; Fig. 3c), indicating that across

Fig. 1 Experimental Paradigm. Participants performed alternating runs of nonassociative memory (NAM) and associative memory (AM) tasks. Each run
consisted of a study (encoding), delay (30 sec) and test (retrieval) phase. Each NAM encoding phase included 20 scene image trials and each NAM
retrieval phase included 40 scene image trials (50% old, 50% new). For AM runs, encoding and retrieval included 10 scene-object trials. We presented
four NAM blocks and eight AM blocks (4x NAM-AM-AM), resulting in a balanced number of 80 old NAM trials, 80 new NAM trials and 80 AM trials
during retrieval. AM tasks always included two objects, but exemplars varied across participants. Scene images obtained from https://commons.

 neurons, a neuron that shows a preference for one object over the
other at encoding tends to show the same preference during
retrieval of the two objects. Note that no such correlation was
seen for AM− trials (Spearman r = .02, P = .787; Supplementary
Figure 3b), again linking reinstatement to memory behaviour.
Figure 3d illustrates this target object reinstatement in a single
example EC neuron.
Relationship between hippocampal and EC retrieval effects. So
far, we have described that in a time window of ~500–1500 ms
after cue onset, hippocampal firing rates increase during AM+
and, in parallel, the retrieved object identity could be decoded
from EC population patterns. We next sought more direct
evidence for a role of the hippocampus in coordinating EC
reinstatement, as proposed by extant models of hippocampus-
mediated pattern completion in cortical target sites12,13. First, we
asked whether hippocampal firing rates and EC reinstatement
might be directly related. To this end, we divided each partici-
pant’s AM+ trials into high hippocampal firing trials and low
hippocampal firing trials based on a median split (after averaging
across all hippocampal neurons in a given participant and across
the 500–1500 ms time window). Next, we separated the trial-wise
EC reinstatement values (% decoding accuracy, averaged across
the 1–2 s encoding window and the .6–1.5 s retrieval window,
Fig. 3b) based on trials with high vs. low hippocampal firing rates
and compared the resulting values across participants via a
paired-samples t-test. Indeed, results showed significantly greater
EC reinstatement for AM+ trials with relatively high compared
to relatively low hippocampal firing rates (t(14) = 3.27, P = .006;
Fig. 4a; one participant was excluded due to insufficient spiking
across trials for a median split).
Second, if hippocampal firing orchestrates EC activity during
AM+, there should be a temporal precedence of hippocampal
relative to EC spikes. To assess such temporal precedence, we
conducted a cross-correlogram (CCG) analysis, examining the
precise timing of firing across hippocampus/EC neuron pairs. In
particular, target spikes in individual EC neurons were temporally
aligned with respect to seed spikes in individual hippocampal
neurons. This was done for all possible same-hemisphere

 directionality while ruling out effects on two neurons caused by
the onset of a stimulus or repetitive task events23. As shown in
Fig. 4b, the resulting CCG revealed strong evidence for functional
coupling between hippocampus and EC during AM+ retrieval.
Critically, significant increases in EC firing were seen within the
first 30 ms after hippocampal spikes (Pcluster = .001), with greater
EC firing rates following than preceding hippocampal spikes
(t(1797) = 3.25, P = .001; ± 50 ms). No increase in EC firing
with respect to hippocampal spikes was seen for AM− trials.
In
fact,
there
was
a
significant
difference
in
EC
firing
following hippocampal spikes for AM+ compared to AM− trials
(Pcluster = .001). Together, these findings reveal that firing in the
human hippocampus precedes firing in EC target sites where
mnemonic
representations
are
reinstated
during
successful
associative retrieval. While this set of results is consistent with
a role of hippocampus coordinating pattern completion in EC, we
note that evidence for causality would require an experimental
intervention approach.
Scene processing precedes associative retrieval in hippo-
campus. Finally, what might be the functional significance of the
early rise in hippocampal firing rates seen for both nonassociative
and associative retrieval (starting ~200 ms post stimulus onset;
Fig. 2b)? A substantial body of work points to a dedicated role of
the hippocampus in spatial/scene processing5–7. We thus capi-
talised on the fact that we used two types of scene images
(buildings and landscapes), testing whether these scene types
could be decoded based on firing patterns across hippocampal
neurons. We used the same LDA decoding approach as described
above (time-resolved five-fold cross-validation, averaging firing
rates across a sliding 500 ms window), collapsing across NAM
HIT and AM+ trials and using firing patterns across a given
participant’s hippocampal neurons as features to discriminate
buildings vs. landscapes. As shown in Fig. 5a, results revealed
above-chance scene discrimination starting at 130 ms post sti-
mulus onset (Pcluster = .003 vs. surrogates), with peak decodability
of ~13% above chance at 440 ms. Applying the same decoding
approach to distinguish associative vs. nonassociative retrieval
processes (AM+ vs. NAM HITs, now collapsing across buildings
and landscapes) showed that process-specific population codes
started setting in at ~270 ms, with peak decodability of ~14%
above chance at 820 ms (Pcluster = .001 vs. surrogates, Fig. 5b).
Note that in addition to the main factor of interest, i.e. associative
vs. nonassociative retrieval processes, AM+ trials and NAM HITs
also differ with regard to the presence vs. absence of the grey
square. Two considerations render it unlikely that this factor
would drive decodability though. First, the decoding performance
peaked after 800 ms, at which point basic visual differences
should only have marginal impact compared to earlier time
points. Second, around the same time point (starting at 700 ms),
hippocampal firing was significantly stronger for AM+ than AM
− trials (Fig. 2c), with all visual input being identical between
these two trial types. We thus suggest that the decodability shown
in Fig. 5b reflects successful deployment of associative retrieval
processes specific to AM+ trials. In any case, pinpointing the
temporal dissociation of scene type and memory task decod-
ability, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors Time
Window (early (0–1 sec), late (1–2 sec)) and Decodability (scene type,
retrieval task) revealed a significant interaction (F(1,14) = 9.23,
P = .009) in the absence of a Time Window or Decodability main
effect
(both
F(1,14) < = 2.01,
P > = .178).
This
interaction
emphasises the relative increase in scene type decodability early in
the trial and the relative increase in retrieval task decodability
later in the trial. Note that this interaction was not contingent on
the precise definition of early and late time windows (e.g., 0–.5 sec
vs. 1–1.5 s: F(1,14) = 7.69, P = .015; .25–.75 s vs. 1.25–1.75 s:
F(1,14) = 9.32, P = .009).
Analogous to the across-neuron correlation analysis performed
for EC reinstatement (Fig. 3c), we next plotted the effect size for a
given hippocampus neuron’s task difference (AM+ vs. NAM
HIT, independent samples t-test on firing rates averaged across
the first 2 s of retrieval) against that neuron’s scene type
difference (buildings vs. landscapes, again independent samples
t-test on firing rates averaged across the first 2 sof retrieval). As
shown in Fig. 5c, there was no significant correlation between the
two effects across neurons (Spearman r = .11, P = .105), suggest-
ing that hippocampal scene-discrimination vs. associative retrie-
val effects are not only temporally dissociated, but are unlikely to
be carried by the same neuron populations. This result is
reminiscent of ‘visually-selective’ vs. ‘memory-selective’ neurons
in human MTL recordings reported previously24. Interestingly,
we observed no topographic effects in the anatomical distribution
of scene-selective vs. memory-selective hippocampus neurons—in
fact the most pronounced scene-selective neuron and the most
pronounced memory-selective neuron in our sample were found
on the same microwire bundle in the same participant, i.e. within
a radius of a few mm at most (Fig. 5c).
Discussion
Returning to our opening example, our findings elucidate the
mechanisms through which the human hippocampal-entorhinal
cell circuitry enables successful memory retrieval in a scene cue

 (‘beach sunset’)—object target (‘cocktail’) scenario: Upon arrival
of visual information in the hippocampus, one population of
neurons processes the content of the scene cue. Shortly thereafter,
a separate process sets in, carried out by another population of
hippocampal neurons and geared towards coordinating object
reinstatement among entorhinal cortex neurons. Our findings
thus track the evolution of human recollection with unprece-
dented precision and provide direct empirical evidence for a role
of the hippocampus in orchestrating cortical pattern completion.
Concurrently, our results reconcile two seemingly incompatible
views on hippocampal function, emphasizing either perceptual/
constructive scene processing5–7 or associative/relational memory
processing8,10—both functions appear to co-exist, but are carried
out by different subpopulations and unfold at different time
points in the course of memory retrieval.
Our first analysis compared hippocampal engagement for
successful nonassociative memory (NAM, HITs and CRs)
with successful associative memory (AM+). Hippocampal firing
rates
during
recognition
memory
have
been
investigated
previously25–27, albeit without directly comparing associative vs.
nonassociative
tasks
or
examining
hippocampal-entorhinal
dynamics. As shown in Fig. 2b, hippocampal firing rates peaked
at 500 ms for all three conditions, but critically were more sus-
tained between 500 and 1500 ms for AM+ trials only. Within the
same time window, we observed a relative increase in hippo-
campal firing rates for AM+ vs. AM− (Fig. 2c). The time course
of the AM+ effect is consistent with the time course of recol-
lection signals in scalp and intracranial Electroencephalography
(EEG) studies28 (for review, see ref. 29). While we observed no
reinstatement of the target object representation across hippo-
campal populations, hippocampal firing rates from 500 ms to
1500 ms predicted the strength of reinstatement among EC
assemblies (Fig. 4a). This finding mirrors results from a previous
fMRI study, which showed that hippocampal activation predicts
the extent of reinstatement of a target scene image in para-
hippocampal cortex, without scene reinstatement in hippo-
campus itself30. Together, these results point to a role of the
hippocampus in coordinating reinstatement/pattern completion
in cortical modules, which is further corroborated by the current
finding that single hippocampal spikes temporally precede spikes
in EC for AM+ but not for AM− (Fig. 4b).
Given that hippocampal neurons did not show object rein-
statement, nor coded for object identity in this paradigm (Sup-
plementary Figure 2), one interesting question is how the
association between a scene cue and the target object is formed
during encoding. In other words, how is the hippocampal
index9,12,13 that allows for subsequent pattern completion
established in the first place? Computational models31 and
empirical data in animals32 and humans33 emphasize that the
hippocampus codes information in a highly conjunctive manner,
i.e. by assigning a unique code to new item-context combinations,
even if the item itself is a repetition. As such, object 1 shown with
scene A (trial n) would elicit a different assembly pattern than
object 1 shown with scene B (trial n + 1). That is, while hippo-
campal populations might show relatively poor decodability for
general object identity, they may well code for a given trial
identity, in the sense of a true episodic index. A recent study
showed evidence for this notion via hippocampal field recordings,
demonstrating that the pattern similarity between retrieval of a
particular word-colour combination and its encoding counterpart
was greater than the similarity with any other encoding trial
featuring the same colour28. Nevertheless, specific semantic
representations that are context-independent have likewise been
found at the level of single hippocampal neurons34, consistent
with the present finding that hippocampal population codes allow
decoding of two different scene categories (buildings vs. land-
scapes, Fig. 5a) across trials. One interesting question for future
research is whether firing patterns in ‘visually-selective’ neurons
tend to generalise across episodes, whereas ‘memory-selective’
neurons, preferentially engaged in associative memory processes,
provide trial-unique episodic indices.
The fact that hippocampal populations did not code for object
identity might at first seem at odds with previous single-unit
studies in humans, showing selective hippocampal responses to
processing35–38 and recall39 of particular object stimuli. However,

 mediotemporal regions showed that objects are underrepresented
in the hippocampus compared to EC40. Besides, these studies
typically quantified how many neurons in a given region dis-
tinctively responded to one or more stimuli from a large stimulus
set, which is not what we did in the current study. Instead, we
here embraced a neuronal population approach rather than a
single neuron approach41–43, examining—participant by partici-
pant—whether the population code across hippocampal or EC
neurons can distinguish between two object exemplars (Fig. 3,
S2), scene categories (Fig. 5a) or memory tasks (Fig. 5b).
Our EC data provide the first evidence for memory-guided
episodic reinstatement across neuronal populations in this region.
Interestingly, while univariate results showed that EC firing rates
distinguished both between AM+ vs. NAM HITs and between
NAM HITs vs. CRs (similar to patterns reported for perirhinal
cortex44–46), there was no difference in EC firing rates between
AM+ and AM− trials (Supplementary Figure 1). We speculate
that this could be due to the fact that (i) only two target objects
were used in each participant and (ii) the majority of AM- trials
consisted of incorrect object responses rather than ‘?’ responses
(see behavioural results). That is, even in the case of AM- trials,
EC neurons are recruited to represent the non-target object.
Indeed, decoding accuracies for AM− were not only significantly
lower than for AM+ (Fig. 3b), but were partially negative (Sup-
plementary Figure 3b), hinting towards reinstatement of the non-
target object. Finally, the cross-correlogram (CCG) results suggest
that despite comparable overall firing rates, EC spikes during
AM− trials are less tightly locked to preceding hippocampal
spikes than during AM+ trials (Fig. 4b).
Given its functional-anatomical proximity to the hippocampus,
EC has been postulated as the first site of target reinstatement13.
That said, it is likely for successful recall to encompass rein-
statement across
multiple cortical modules as recollection
unfolds. Indeed, a recent study recording from neurons in the
human anterior temporal lobe has shown evidence for rein-
statement of semantic information in this region during suc-
cessful
recall47.
Simultaneous
recordings
from
lower-level
perceptual and higher-level semantic regions would allow track-
ing the gradual emergence of a full-blown memory, alongside a
possible reversal of information flow from encoding to retrieval48.
Lastly, an interesting question for future research is how the
dynamics between hippocampus and EC would manifest had we
reversed the role of objects and scenes in our paradigm. In other
words, if trial-unique objects were used to cue one of two target

 scenes, how would this affect the roles of the two regions in
successful recall? For the current scenario, our data suggest that
one set of hippocampal neurons represents the scene cue infor-
mation before a second set of hippocampal neurons is deployed
to coordinate reinstatement of the target object in EC. We thus
speculate that if objects served as cues, we would first see a
response in object-tuned EC assemblies. This cue-specific EC
response would then be followed by deployment of the same set
of process-specific (‘memory-selective’) hippocampal neurons
observed here (Fig. 5b), which would in turn coordinate rein-
statement of target scene representations among scene-specific
(‘visually-selective’)
hippocampal
neurons
(alongside
scene-
specific cortical modules49). In other words, we would postulate
a domain-general set of hippocampal neurons dedicated to
coordinating associative retrieval/pattern completion50, but the
time point of engagement of EC neurons vs. scene-selective
hippocampal neurons could reverse as a function of the assign-
ment of objects and scenes to cues and targets51.
Methods
Participants. Sixteen participants (7 male; 22–54 years old) undergoing treatment
for pharmacologically intractable epilepsy were implanted with chronic depth
electrodes to localize the seizure onset zone for possible surgical resection. All
studies conformed to the guidelines of the Medical Institutional Review Board at
the University of Bonn. Informed written consent was obtained from each parti-
cipant. Electrode locations were planned exclusively based on clinical considera-
tions and included the anterior half of the hippocampus (i.e., hippocampal head
and body) as well as entorhinal cortex.
Paradigm. A schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Each experimental
session consisted of 12 runs (4 nonassociative memory (NAM), 8 associative
memory (AM)) containing an encoding block, a delay block and a retrieval block.
NAM and AM runs were arranged such that one NAM run alternated with two
consecutive AM runs, with the assignment of the first run (NAM or AM) coun-
terbalanced across participants. All trials began with a .5 s fixation cross, followed
by a 2 s (NAM) or 3 s (AM) stimulus display, followed by a 3-choice response
screen (left arrow, down arrow, right arrow; self-paced). During retrieval trials, a
.5 s feedback screen followed the button press in which a green fixation cross was
shown for correct responses, a red fixation cross for incorrect responses and a white
fixation cross for “don’t know” responses. Before starting the next trial, a blank-
screen inter-trial interval with a jitter of .1-.4 s was presented. The study-test delay
consisted of a 30 s interval in which participants were instructed to relax while the
remaining rest time was shown on the screen.
In NAM runs, participants saw 20 scene images (depicting buildings or
landscapes) during encoding and indicated whether they would like to visit the
shown environment (left arrow), would not like to visit the environment (right
arrow) or were not sure (down arrow). At retrieval, participants saw the same
20 scene images randomly intermixed with 20 novel scene images and indicated
whether they thought the image was old or new, yielding the memory outcomes
HITs (old images correctly identified as old), MISSes (old images incorrectly
identified as new), Correct Rejections (CRs, new images correctly identified as
new), False Alarms (FAs, new images incorrectly identified as old) and “don’t
know” responses. In AM runs, participants saw 10 new scene images (from the
same buildings/landscapes set) during encoding. Superimposed on the scene was
one of two object images, surrounded by a grey square. The choice of object images
was customized for each experimental session based on a previous screening
session to identify response-eliciting stimuli in any of the recorded neurons (see
below). For each encoding trial, participants indicated whether they thought the
given object was (left arrow) or was not (right arrow) likely to be encountered in
the given environment. In case they could not decide, they were allowed to indicate
“not sure” (down arrow). At retrieval, participants saw the same 10 scene images
(in random order) with the grey squares superimposed, but critically the objects
themselves were removed. After a 3 s retrieval period, participants saw the verbal
labels of the two objects and indicated which of the two they thought had been
paired with the given scene during encoding, yielding the memory outcomes
correct Associative Memory (AM+) and incorrect as well as “don’t know”
responses (the latter two referred to as AM−). In total, participants were presented
with 80 old and 80 new scene images during nonassociative retrieval and 80 old
scene images during associative retrieval.
Regarding the choice of object stimuli, the screening sessions were usually
conducted first thing in the morning and would then be used for different aspects
of the various subsequent experiments conducted that day. For the current
experiment, we chose two object images (out of 100 presented during a screening
session) that elicited a strong response in any of the recording contacts, irrespective
of the anatomical location of the responding contact. In that sense, there was no a
priori bias to favour object stimuli preferred by EC or hippocampus. Nevertheless,
we also quantified post-hoc how many EC neurons and how many hippocampal
neurons showed stronger firing rates for one of the two object images over the
other during the encoding portion of this experiment. Specifically, we averaged the
firing rates for the entire 3 s of an encoding trial and compared, neuron by neuron,
the firing rates for the 40 encoding trials showing object 1 with the 40 encoding
trials showing object 2 (independent samples t-test, P < .05, two-tailed). Results
showed that an average of 1.2 hippocampus neurons per participant (SEM = 0.6)
and 2.2 EC neurons per participant (SEM = 0.5) showed a statistically significant
response increase for one object over the other. While this difference only showed a
statistical trend (t(15) = 1.78, P = .096), this univariate effect would still impact
multivariate decodability, as there are on average more ‘diagnostic’ units in EC
than hippocampus. We thus refrained from directly comparing object decodability
between the two regions.
Electrophysiological recordings. Recordings were obtained from bundles of nine
microwires each (eight high-impedance recording electrodes, one low-impedance
reference, AdTech, Racine, WI) protruding ~4 mm from the end of each depth
electrode. The differential signal from the microwires was amplified using a 256-
channel Neuralynx ATLAS system (Bozeman, MT), filtered between 0.1 and
9000 Hz, and sampled at 32 kHz. These recordings were stored digitally for further
analysis. Spike detection and sorting was performed after band-pass filtering the
signals between 300 and 3000 Hz37,52. Sorted units were manually confirmed and
classified as single units (SU), multi-units, or artifacts based on spike shape and
variance, peak-amplitude-to-noise level, the inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution
of each cluster and presence of a refractory period. Depending on which
implantation sites were actually chosen by the responsible clinicians, the number of
microwires analyzed per patient ranged between 24 and 48. Anatomical localiza-
tion of microwires was determined based on the post-implantation CT scan co-
registered to the pre-implantation MRI scan, both normalized to MNI space with
SPM12. The end of the corresponding depth electrode was visually identified and a
3-mm-radius sphere was placed 4 mm medial to the electrode tip. For visualization
in Figs 2a and 3a, participants’ MRIs and EC/hippocampus spheres were averaged.
Percent coverage refers to the number of participants with EC/hippocampus
spheres at a given voxel. Note that for sagittal slices, left hemisphere spheres were
projected onto the right hemisphere.
Analysis. For continuous representations of instantaneous neuronal firing, spike
trains were convolved with a Gaussian kernel (50 ms width, 1 ms time resolution).
Resulting time series were baseline-corrected by subtracting firing rates in the
interval from −.5 to 0 s and subjected to parametric tests at each time point.
Correction for multiple comparisons across time (stimulus onset until end of trial)
was performed using FieldTrip’s nonparametric cluster-based permutation method
(1000 randomisations)19. Pairwise comparisons via t-tests were two-tailed.
Mulitvariate pattern analysis was performed via linear discriminant analysis
(LDA), using—at each individual time point—the firing rates of all neurons in EC
or hippocampus as features (after averaging across a sliding 500 ms window and z-
scoring across trials instead of baseline normalization). For reinstatement analysis
(Fig. 3b), a classifier was first trained on all 80 AM encoding trials and then applied
to each AM+ retrieval trial, assessing the decoding accuracy during successful
retrieval based on object-specific encoding patterns. This was done in an encoding
time (training) x retrieval time (testing) fashion. For stimulus decoding at encoding
or retrieval per se, k-fold cross-validation was performed. K was set to 5, and five
repetitions were included to provide stability across different partitions of training
and testing trials. For all decoding analyses, the outcome measure was % area under
the curve (AUC) of a decoding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)53. To
enter decoding analyses, we required a minimum of three neurons per participant,
resulting in exclusion of one participant for hippocampal decoding analyses.
For cross-correlogram (CCG) analyses, we obtained spike occurrence
histograms for EC neurons with respect to individual hippocampus neuron spikes
(±50 ms, 1 ms bin size), using all within-hemisphere combinations of EC/
hippocampus neuron pairs in a given participant (resulting in a total of 1798
combinations/histograms). Each participant provided an average of 112 (SEM =
35) EC/hippocampus combinations, with an average of 12 (SEM = 2) EC neurons
and an average of 12 (SEM = 3) hippocampal neurons contributing. Prior to
entering statistical analysis, histograms were smoothed with a 10 ms running
average. To control for trial-invariant firing properties across neurons, a ‘shift-
predictor’ baseline CCG was derived by scrambling trial orders such that seed
spikes came from trial n and target spikes from trial n ± 1. The shift-predictor CCG
for each neuron combination was then subtracted from its real CCGs and the
resulting shift-predictor-corrected CCG was tested against zero across-neuron
combinations.
