Objectives. To investigate physical and mental health and experiences of violence
among male and female trafficking survivors in a high-income country.
Methods. Our data were derived from a cross-sectional survey of 150 men and women
in England who were in contact with posttrafficking support services. Interviews took
place over 18 months, from June 2013 to December 2014.
Results. Participants had been trafficked for sexual exploitation (29%), domestic
servitude (29.3%), and labor exploitation (40.4%). Sixty-six percent of women reported
forced sex during trafficking, including 95% of those trafficked for sexual exploitation
and 54% of those trafficked for domestic servitude.Twenty-one percent of men and 24%
of women reported ongoing injuries, and 8% of men and 23% of women reported
diagnosed sexually transmitted infections. Finally, 78% of women and 40% of men
reported high levels of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.
Conclusions. Psychological interventions to support the recovery of this highly vul-
nerable population are urgently needed. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:1073–1078. doi:

uman trafficking, which involves the
recruitment and movement of women,
men, and children across or within national
borders for the purposes of sexual, labor,
and other forms of exploitation, is a serious
human rights violation and important public
health issue.1 Recent estimates suggest that
approximately 20.9 million people are in
situations of forced labor worldwide as a result
of human trafficking.2
The abuses endured by trafficked people
have prompted calls for survivors to be pro-
vided with comprehensive and culturally ap-
propriate health care, but little is known about
survivors’ health needs.3 Although a systematic
review demonstrated a high prevalence of
physical and psychological morbidity among
survivors in contact with posttrafficking sup-
port services,4 the review highlighted that
research has focused on women who were
trafficked for sexual exploitation and had re-
cently escaped the trafficking situation. Very
little is known about survivors’ medium- to
long-term health, the health of women traf-
ficked for other forms of exploitation, or
the health of trafficked men.
A recent Southeast Asian survey conducted
with survivors who had entered support ser-
vices within the preceding 2 weeks reported
a high prevalence of symptoms of physical ill
health and of depression, anxiety, and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among both
trafficked men and women.5 A study of female
Moldovan survivors revealed that 55% met
the diagnostic criteria for mental disorders,
predominantly depression and PTSD, 6
months after returning home.6 These studies
suggest that psychological morbidity may be
increased by violence before and during
trafficking and by poor social support and
unmet needs in the posttrafficking period.5,6
Evidence to inform policies and services in
high-income country settings remains lim-
ited, as most research has been conducted
in low- and middle-income countries, mainly
in South and Southeast Asia and the post-
Soviet states. To our knowledge, the study
described here is the first to investigate the
physical and mental health of male and female
trafficking survivors in a high-income country.
METHODS
We derived our data from a cross-sectional
survey of trafficking survivors conducted in
England. Interviews took place over a period
of 18 months (June 2013–December 2014).
Eligibility
Individuals were eligible for the study if
they were aged 18 years or older, had ex-
perienced human trafficking, had been
identified as a victim of human trafficking by
statutory or voluntary agencies, and had
previously received or were currently re-
ceiving assistance from one or more statutory
or voluntary agencies. Human trafficking was
defined in accordance with the United Na-
tions Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially
Women and Girls.7 People were excluded if
they remained in the exploitation setting,
they were too unwell or distressed to par-
ticipate, or they were unable to provide

 informed consent. No restrictions were
placed on exploitation type, time since ex-
ploitation, country of origin, or language.
Recruitment
A 2-stage sampling strategy was used to
recruit participants. First, the research team
requested assistance from 19 voluntary-sector
organizations that either provided
government-funded posttrafficking support
or were authorized to refer potential victims
of human trafficking for such support and
from 10 health care organizations and 15
social services departments located in areas in
which high numbers of victims of trafficking
had been previously identified. Nine vol-
untary organizations did not respond, and one
voluntary organization and 5 social services
departments declined to provide assistance.
In the second stage, participating organi-
zations approached a convenience sample of
potential participants, provided basic study
information, and worked with the study team
to schedule research interviews. Participating
organizations were based in London and in
eastern, southeastern, western, and north-
western England. Face-to-face interpretation
was provided as required by qualified in-
dependent interpreters. Travel and child-care
expenses were reimbursed, and participants
were given a £20 ($28) shopping voucher.
Measures
Instruments that had been validated among
people who experienced trauma and abuse
were used in the survey. Data were collected on
sociodemographic characteristics, pretrafficking
and trafficking experiences, medical history and
physical health, psychological health, sub-
stance use, sexual and reproductive health,
and unmet social care needs.
The sociodemographic characteristics
assessed included gender, age, country of
origin, education, marital status, and number
and location of children. Data on pre-
trafficking and trafficking experiences in-
cluded typeand duration of exploitation, time
since escape, living and working conditions,
and violence.5 Extreme restriction of
movement was defined as never being
allowed to travel unaccompanied, being
locked in a room, or both.
Questions from the 2007 English Adult
Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were used to

disorders).8 Participants were categorized as
having a chronic medical condition if they
had been diagnosed with one or more of the
following: arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, di-
abetes, epilepsy, hepatitis, heart disease, high
or low blood pressure, HIV, kidney prob-
lems, or tuberculosis. Physical symptoms
were assessed with the Miller Abuse Physical
Symptoms and Injury Survey.9 Severe
symptoms were defined as symptoms that
bothered the participant “quite a lot” or
“extremely” (vs “not at all” or “a little”).
With respect to psychological health,
probable depressive disorder was assessed as
a score of 10 or more on the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9,10 probable anxiety disor-
der as a score of 10 or more on the Gen-
eralized Anxiety Disorder 7 scale,11 and
probable PTSD as a score of 3 or more on the
4-item version of the PTSD Checklist–
Civilian.12 Participants were categorized as
having high levels of psychological symp-
toms if they screened positive for probable
depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or
PTSD. The Revised Clinical Interview
Schedule13 was used to assess suicidality;
participants who endorsed 2 or more items
were categorized as suicidal.

use was assessed via questions from the British
Crime Survey.16 Questions adapted from the
third UK National Survey of Sexual Attitudes
and Lifestyles were used to assess sexual and
reproductive health, including diagnosed
sexually transmitted infections (STIs).17
Finally, a modified 15-item version of the
Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Ap-
praisal Schedule was used to assess unmet social
care needs.18,19 Interviewers rated items as
representing“no problem,”a “met need,”or an
“unmet need” according to participants’ reports
of their current situation. Higher scores
reflect a greater level of unmet need.
Data Analysis
We used Stata version 11 (StataCorp LP,
CollegeStation,TX)inconductingouranalyses.
Descriptive statistics (percentages for categorical
variables and either means and standard de-
viations or medians and interquartile ranges
[IQRs] for continuous variables) were used to
describe sociodemographic and trafficking
characteristics and other variables of interest.
Bivariate analyses were stratified by gender and
conducted via logistic regression models.
RESULTS
Of the 169 people invited to participate in
the study, 150 (88.8%) consented (98 women
and 52 men). Of the 19 people who were
invited but did not participate, 7 did not take
part because of health reasons, including
serious physical illnesses, advanced stages of
pregnancy, and high levels of psychological
distress. Sixty-nine (46%) interviews were
conducted with the assistance of an interpreter.
Sample Characteristics
Participants originated from more than 30
countries, including Nigeria, Poland, and
Albania. Women were most often trafficked for
sexual exploitation or domestic servitude. More
than four fifths of men were trafficked for labor
exploitation, working in settings including ag-
riculture (26.9%), construction (15.7%), and car
washing (13.7%). Female participants were
generally younger than male participants, had
spent less time in education, and were less likely
to be currently married or living with a partner
but were equally likely to have children (Table
1). Forty-two percent of women who had
children reported that their children lived with
them. By contrast, only 3.5% of men with
children reported that their children lived with
them; 42% reported that their children lived
with their current or former partner.
Health Risks Before and During
Trafficking
Women reported that they been in the
situation of exploitation for a median of
12 months (IQR=5–60), and the median time
since escape was 16 months (IQR=3–38). By
contrast, men reported having been exploited
for a median of 3 months (IQR = 1–12), with
a median time since escape of 3 months
(IQR = 1–6). Sixty percent of men and 81.3%
of women reported extreme restriction of
movement during trafficking, as did 52.6%,
83.7%, and 90.7% of people trafficked for
labor exploitation, domestic servitude,
and sexual exploitation, respectively.
Overall, 42.3% of men and 76.5% of
women reported physical violence during
trafficking. Injuries were sustained by 32.7% of
men and 67.4% of women as a result of either
violence or occupational accidents; 21.2% of
men and 23.5% of women reported that these
injuries caused ongoing pain or difficulty.
Two thirds of women reported being
forced to have sex during trafficking, in-
cluding 95% of women trafficked for sexual
exploitation, 54% trafficked for domestic
servitude, and 21% trafficked for other forms
of labor exploitation. Seventy-one percent of
the participants reported that they remained
afraid of the traffickers even after they
were out of the trafficking situation.
The prevalence of pretrafficking violence
was also high. In total, 28.9% of men and
58.2% of women reported pretrafficking
physical violence. In addition, 30% of women
reported pretrafficking sexual violence, per-
petrated predominantly by partners (9.2%)
and family members (5.1%).
Physical, Sexual, and Mental Health
The most commonly reported severe
physical symptoms were headaches, being
easily tired, back pain, dizzy spells, and

 memory problems (Table 2); the prevalence
of each of these symptoms was significantly
higher among women than among men.
Forty-five percent of participants reported
chronic medical conditions. Overall, 7.7% of
men and 22.5% of women reported di-
agnosed STIs.
The prevalence of probable depressive
disorder, anxiety disorder, or PTSD (i.e., the
prevalence of high levels of psychological
symptoms) was 69.8%, and 38.0% of the
participants reported suicidal ideation.
Women were more likely than men to re-
port high levels of psychological symptoms
(odds ratio [OR] = 4.0; 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.8, 8.6) and to report sui-
cidal ideation (OR = 6.7; 95% CI = 2.8,
16.3). Fourteen percent of the participants
reported hazardous alcohol use, with men at
increased risk relative to women
(OR = 11.4; 95% CI = 3.6, 36.3).
No participants reported a history of
psychotic illnesses, but 10.5% had unmet
treatment needs relating to hearing voices or
seeing things that were not there; all but 2 of
these participants met the criteria for probable
PTSD. Unadjusted odds of high levels of
psychological symptoms were elevated
among women who reported pretrafficking
physical violence, sexual violence during
trafficking, and, in the posttrafficking period,
ongoing fear of the traffickers and increasing
numbers of unmet social needs (Table 3).
Among men, unadjusted odds of high levels
of psychological symptoms were elevated
among those who reported ongoing fear of
the traffickers and lacking a confidante in the
posttrafficking period.
Unmet Social Needs
Participants had a median of 2 (IQR =
1–4) unmet social needs, with more than
a quarter having unmet needs relating to
budgeting and not having enough money
for essential items, accessing benefits, social
lives, or having enough to do. One third
reported that they did not have family or
friends in whom they could confide.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to our knowledge to
offer evidence on the medium- to long-term
health of female and male trafficking survi-
vors. It is also among the first studies to
investigate the health of trafficking survivors
in a high-income setting. Our findings in-
dicate that many survivors experience
medium- to long-term physical, sexual, and
mental health problems, includinginjuries, STIs,
and probable depression, anxiety, and PTSD.
Our results also highlight the high levels of
violence experienced by trafficked people
and their ongoing fear of the traffickers in the
posttrafficking period; nearly three quarters
of participants perceived that they were still in
danger from their trafficker. Survivors will
need psychological support to address the
chronic and multiple traumatic events they
have experienced along with careful risk as-
sessments and safety planning, particularly if
they are returning to their countries of origin.
Importantly, women trafficked for domestic
servitude experienced high levels of sexual
violence during trafficking, and both men and
women reported a high prevalence of di-
agnosed STIs. Comprehensive sexual health
services are needed for trafficked people,
regardless of the type of exploitation suffered.
Our study lacked sufficient power to de-
tect differences in the risk of high levels of

 psychological symptoms in relation to pre-
trafficking, trafficking, and posttrafficking
factors. Our analysis suggests, however, that
such risk may be heightened among survivors
who have experienced violence before and
during trafficking and who, once out of the
trafficking situation, have ongoing fear of
their traffickers and have a higher number of
unmet social needs (e.g., financial difficulties
and social isolation). The participants’
unmet social needs suggest that many of these
individuals were continuing to struggle with
economic insecurity and social marginaliza-
tion as they attempted to rebuild their lives.
Our findings are consistent with those of
previous studies, conducted predominantly in
low- and middle-income country settings
and with female trafficking survivors, show-
ing an increased risk of mental health prob-
lems among women who experienced
violence prior to and during trafficking, who
have poor social support, and who have higher
numbers of unmet needs.6,20 In contrast to
previous research, we did not find an

 association between duration of exploitation
and high levels of psychological symptoms.
Strengths and Limitations
This is one of the largest studies conducted
to date of the health risks and experiences of
female and male trafficking survivors. We
used measures of physical and mental health
that have been validated in multiple languages
and among people who have experienced
trauma and abuse; in addition, we used
standard scoring methods and cutoffs. Par-
ticipation was not restricted to survivors who
could speak English; independent, pro-
fessionally qualified interpreters assisted with
interviews as required.
However, our analysis of factors that
predicted high levels of psychological
symptoms was limited by the study sample
size, which was dependent on the number of
survivors in contact with support services
during the study period. Measures of physical
and mental health have not been validated
for trafficked populations, and it was not
possible to test the validity of the measures
used here.
We were able to recruit very few partic-
ipants via health care provider organizations
and social services, which may limit the
generalizability of our results given the like-
lihood that most trafficking survivors are
not in contact with posttrafficking support
services. If survivors in contact with such
posttrafficking services have more severe
experiences and higher levels of need, our
findings may overestimate the health risks and
consequences associated with trafficking.4
However, the consistency of our findings
with those of previous studies focusing on the
mental health of trafficking survivors suggests
that our results may generalize to survivors
using shelter services in other settings.6,20
Finally, for ethical reasons, we excluded
survivors who were too physically or psy-
chologically unwell to participate. It is im-
portant to note that their exclusion from the
study means that there may have been some
survivors in contact with support services
who had more severe health needs than those
reported here.
Conclusions
The findings of this study indicate that
health care—including physical, mental, and
sexual health care—must be a fundamental
component of posttrafficking care. Female
and male survivors will benefit from timely
access to physical, sexual, and mental health
assessments; culturally and linguistically ap-
propriate psychological support; and, partic-
ularly, services that address their economic,
social, and legal insecurity. Clear referral
pathways between posttrafficking support
services and medical services must be estab-
lished. Finally, our results strongly suggest the
urgency of testing psychological interventions
to support the recovery of this highly
vulnerable population.
