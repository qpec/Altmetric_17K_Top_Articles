IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital
microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and it has been associated with other adverse
pregnancy and birth outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico
and the number of associated congenital microcephaly cases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a modeling study from April to July 2016.
Using parameters derived from published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically
using Monte Carlo simulation. We used uncertainty distributions to reflect the limited
information available for parameter values. Given the high level of uncertainty in model
parameters, interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as primary results. Outcomes were
modeled for pregnant women in Puerto Rico, which currently has more confirmed ZIKV cases
than any other US location.
EXPOSURE Zika virus infection in pregnant women.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and
number of congenital microcephaly cases.
RESULTS We estimated an IQR of 5900 to 10 300 pregnant women (median, 7800) might be
infected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico. Of these, an IQR of 100 to 270 infants
(median, 180) may be born with microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infection from
mid-2016 to mid-2017. In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 cases (median, 12)
of congenital microcephaly are expected in Puerto Rico per year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The estimate of 5900 to 10 300 pregnant women that might
be infected with ZIKV provides an estimate for the number of infants that could potentially
have ZIKV-associated adverse outcomes. Including baseline cases of microcephaly, we
estimated that an IQR of 110 to 290 total cases of congenital microcephaly, mostly
attributable to ZIKV infection, could occur from mid-2016 to mid-2017 in the absence of
effective interventions. The primary limitation in this analysis is uncertainty in model
parameters. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the cumulative incidence of ZIKV
infection and risk of microcephaly given maternal infection in the first trimester were the
primary drivers of both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of microcephaly
cases. Increased information on these parameters would lead to more precise estimates.
Nonetheless, the results underscore the need for urgent actions being undertaken in Puerto
Rico to prevent congenital ZIKV infection and prepare for affected infants.

Z
ika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause
of congenital microcephaly and severe fetal brain de-
fects, and it has been associated with pregnancy loss,
ocular birth defects, and severe arthrogryposis in the
extremities.1-10 Since it was first reported in Brazil in May 2015,
ZIKV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has spread throughout the
Americas.11 The Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) re-
ported the first case of autochthonous transmission of ZIKV
in December 2015.12
As of August 4, 2016, Puerto Rico reported 5897 con-
firmed cases of ZIKV infection, more than any other US loca-
tion, and the number is expected to rise.12-14 Among the con-
firmed cases, 901 have been among pregnant women,14 and
the first case of microcephaly in a fetus with confirmed ZIKV
infectionwasannouncedbythePRDHonMay13,2016.15Given
that the outbreak in Puerto Rico was growing in early 2016 and
that microcephaly risk appears to be highest with ZIKV infec-
tion during the first trimester,4,7,16-18 few pregnancies with
first-trimester exposure have delivered, to date.
We estimated the number of pregnant women infected
with ZIKV in Puerto Rico and the number of associated con-
genital microcephaly cases expected up to 9 months after the
outbreak.Becausetherangeofinfantoutcomesassociatedwith
congenital ZIKV infection is not well understood, estimating
the number of infants exposed to maternal ZIKV infection dur-
ing fetal development also provides an estimate for the num-
ber of infants that could potentially have ZIKV-associated
adverse outcomes. These estimates, the number of pregnant
women with ZIKV infection and the number of microcephaly
cases, can guide public health strategies in the care and coun-
seling for women of reproductive age, as well as inform
planning for services for affected children and families.
Methods
We estimated ranges for the expected number of women with
ZIKV infection during pregnancy in the initial ZIKV outbreak
in Puerto Rico, the number of microcephaly cases due to ZIKV
infection during pregnancy, and total congenital micro-
cephaly cases accounting for baseline prevalence of congen-
ital microcephaly in Puerto Rico. We first reviewed published
reports for relevant parameters and accounted for numerous
uncertainties by developing uncertainty distributions reflect-
ing lack of knowledge for parameter values. We then used
Monte Carlo simulation techniques to sample parameters from
these distributions and, for each sampled set, estimated an ex-
pectedoutcomebysamplingfromarandomprocesswiththose
parameters. As a result, the uncertainty ranges presented here
reflect both the effect of parameter uncertainty on expected
values for the outcomes and random variation in the out-
comes about these expected values. Institutional review board
approval was not required, as this study (conducted from April
to July 2016) used publicly available data to generate
estimates of outcomes of interest.
In our model, we assumed there was no ZIKV exposure
prior to the outbreak and accounted for declining risk due to
exposure prior to pregnancy as the epidemic progresses. We
also made the simplifying assumption that pregnancies re-
sulting in a live birth are uniformly spread across months, al-
though there is variation in actual birth rates by month.19 This
assumption allowed us to estimate outcomes relative to the
overall infection rate in the initial outbreak, irrespective of the
specific, unknown time course of the outbreak. With the mean
rate of pregnancy per month and the estimated value for the
overall ZIKV infection rate, we estimated the number of preg-
nant women infected with ZIKV within each trimester of
pregnancy during the outbreak.
We used the estimated number of women infected in each
trimesterandtrimester-specificestimatesofmicrocephalyrisk
given maternal infection to estimate the number of excess
microcephaly cases resulting from the initial ZIKV outbreak.
The number of microcephaly cases in the absence of the ZIKV
epidemic was estimated using the estimated total number of
annual pregnancies and a background microcephaly risk of
2 to 6 cases per 10 000 births.20 Additionally, using previ-
ously described methods, we projected when the first infants
with microcephaly due to ZIKV were likely to be born.21
For parameters with limited information available a priori,
we assumed the uncertainty to be distributed uniformly
throughout the range of possible values. For parameters with
a specified range and a most likely value, we used a triangular
uncertaintydistributiontoconcentratehigherlikelihoodinthe
vicinity of the assumed most likely value. The resulting esti-
mates were summarized using the median, interquartile range
(IQR), and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of 100 000 Monte
Carlo simulations. Given the high level of uncertainty in
model input parameters, the IQRs, the most likely range of
outcomes, are presented as the primary results.
All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute). Details on the assumptions, derivation of the
models, and the Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation process
are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Model Parameters
Incidence of ZIKV Infection
We estimated the incidence of ZIKV infection for the general
population of Puerto Rico in 2016. Despite the adverse preg-
nancy outcomes associated with ZIKV infection during preg-
nancy, available data do not indicate that pregnant women
Key Points
Question How many pregnant women will be infected with Zika
virus (ZIKV) and how many cases of congenital microcephaly will
be due to ZIKV in Puerto Rico?
Findings In this modeling study using parameters derived from
published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically using
Monte Carlo simulation. We estimated that 5900 to 10 300
pregnant women might be infected during the ZIKV outbreak in
Puerto Rico; of these, 100 to 270 might result in congenital
microcephaly between mid-2016 and mid-2017.
Meaning The results underscore the need for the urgent actions
being undertaken in Puerto Rico to prevent ZIKV infections and plan
for medical and supportive service needs for affected families.

differ in their susceptibility to ZIKV infection compared with
the general population.7,16,22,23 We considered data from
other mosquito-borne illnesses in Puerto Rico and data from
ZIKV outbreaks in other locations. Although chikungunya is
an alphavirus and ZIKV is a flavivirus, both viruses are trans-
mitted by the same vector (Aedes aegypti) in Puerto Rico.
Aedes aegypti have limited flight ranges of typically 100 m
and the setting of the vector may be more important than
the genus of the virus in terms of transmission rates.24,25
Additionally, both the current ZIKV outbreak and the recent
chikungunya outbreak in Puerto Rico introduced these
viruses to a sero-naive population. A study of blood donors
in Puerto Rico found an overall incidence of chikungunya
infection of 23.5% in approximately the first year after
introduction.26 Another recent study of chikungunya in
Puerto Rico found seroprevalences of 19% and 28% in 2
communities with intensive vector control efforts and 41%
and 55% in 2 communities without those efforts, approxi-
mately 2 years after the initial cases were diagnosed.27
While dengue viruses are also transmitted by the same vec-
tor, the long-term circulation of multiple dengue serotypes
in Puerto Rico limits the relevance of the data for a newly
introduced arbovirus. However, in 2 older dengue outbreaks
in Puerto Rico in 1969 and 1982, in which novel serotypes
were introduced, infection rates were 46% and 31%,
respectively.28,29
Recent ZIKV outbreaks in other settings have resulted in
a sero-incidence of 66% to 73%.17,30 Older sero-surveys, which
were not associated with outbreaks, found the prevalence of
ZIKV antibodies to range widely from 6% to 75%.31-37
However, there is significant cross-reactivity for flavivirus
antibody tests; therefore, ZIKV sero-surveys should be
interpreted with caution in settings with other endemic
flaviviruses.38 Given these data, we allowed for substantial un-
certainty in the incidence of ZIKV infection in 2016 in Puerto
Rico. First, we assumed it would not be lower than 10% nor
higher than 70%. Based on the blood donor data for chikun-
gunya, the incidence of ZIKV infection in 2016 is likely to be
on the lower end of this range, possibly around 25%. We used
a triangular distribution to capture the uncertainty between
the minimum (10%), maximum (70%), and most probable
(25%) outcome (Table 1). The IQR or most likely value for the
cumulative risk of ZIKV infection was therefore estimated to
be of 25% to 44%.
Pregnant Population
The expected number of women who become pregnant
each month was estimated using a binomial process with a
rate of one-twelfth of the 2015 live birth rate in Puerto Rico
(written communication with PRDH; May 2016) and the
2015 US Census estimate for the population of Puerto Rico
(Table 1).39
Risk for Microcephaly
Congenital microcephaly was defined as clinically diagnosed
microcephaly and did not include microcephaly based solely
on head circumference. In 2013-2015, the annual rate of con-
genital microcephaly ranged from 2.6 to 5.5 per 10 000 live
births in Puerto Rico (written communication with PRDH Birth
Defects Surveillance Program; May 2016). Therefore, we used
auniformuncertaintydistributionof2to6microcephalycases
per 10 000 live births. The risk for microcephaly given mater-
nal ZIKV infection during pregnancy was based primarily on
estimates derived from Bahia, Brazil.18 These data indicated
a strong association between maternal ZIKV infection in the
first trimester and subsequent risk for microcephaly. We used
a 1% to 13% risk for microcephaly given first trimester mater-
nal ZIKV infection with a uniform distribution to reflect
uncertainty.18 Available data are limited but indicate that the
risk for microcephaly associated with infection in the second
and third trimesters of pregnancy is lower or might be no
greater than the baseline microcephaly risk. Therefore, we set
the most likely risk for microcephaly in these trimesters to
0.03% (range, 0%-0.7%) and 0% (range, 0%-0.2%), respec-
tively, using triangular distributions to capture the uncer-
tainty (Table 1).

Results
Using the estimated distribution for each parameter given in
Table 1, we estimated that an IQR of 5900 to 10 300 pregnant
women (median, 7800; 95% UI, 3500-15 000) might be in-
fected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico (Table 2).
Of these maternal infections, an IQR of 100 to 270 (median,
180; 95% UI, 30-500) might result in microcephaly due to con-
genital ZIKV infection. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indi-
cated that 2 model input parameters, cumulative incidence of
ZIKV infection and risk for microcephaly given maternal
infection in the first trimester, were the primary drivers of
both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of
microcephaly cases.
As the risk for microcephaly seems to be highest with first-
trimester ZIKV infection, most of the microcephaly cases are
expected to be delayed relative to the ZIKV outbreak. The first
reported ZIKV cases occurred in late 2015, so microcephaly
cases among live-born infants would be expected to occur as
early June 2016, with some earlier cases possibly associated
withsecond-trimesterinfection,andwouldcontinueinto2017.
In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 micro-
cephaly cases (median, 12; 95% UI, 4-23) would be expected
in Puerto Rico in a given year. Accounting for both the base-
line prevalence of microcephaly and the estimated 100 to 270
microcephaly cases attributable to ZIKV infection during the
initial ZIKV outbreak, we estimated a total of 110 to 290
microcephaly cases (median, 190; 95% UI, 50-510) between
mid-2016 and mid-2017 (Table 2).
Discussion
AsofAugust4,2016,thenumberoflaboratory-confirmedZIKV
cases in Puerto Rico continued to rise. Assuming that the cu-
mulativeincidenceofZIKVinfectionin2016willbeintherange
of 10% to 70% and most likely close to 25%, we estimated that
5900to10 300womenmaybeinfectedwithZIKVduringpreg-
nancy in Puerto Rico in 2016. This estimate also provides an
estimate of the number of infants at risk for ZIKV-associated
adverse outcomes. Additionally, we estimated that if mater-
nal infection in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated
with a 1% to 13% risk for microcephaly, up to a 0.7% risk in the
second trimester and up to a 0.2% risk in the third trimester,
an additional 100 to 270 infants may be born with congenital
microcephaly in Puerto Rico as a result of the ZIKV outbreak.
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict the num-
ber of ZIKV infections in pregnant women and the excess
microcephaly cases that might be expected in Puerto Rico.
Our modeling approach has several limitations. The pri-
mary limitation is uncertainty in key model parameters. Using
Monte Carlo simulation, we repeatedly estimated the out-
comes based on values for input parameters sampled from as-
sumeduncertaintydistributions.Asaresult,ourestimateshave
wide uncertainty intervals reflecting the parameter uncer-
tainty. The outer limits of these estimated uncertainty distri-
butions should be interpreted with caution because the like-
lihood of the true outcome reaching these values is small. We
also assessed sensitivity to key parameters and found that
cumulative incidence of ZIKV infection and risk for micro-
cephaly due to ZIKV infection in the first trimester were the
principal drivers of the outcomes. As a result, increased infor-
mation on these parameters would lead to more precise esti-
mates. Ongoing surveillance and studies, especially among
pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico, will pro-
vide information to improve estimates of the incidence of in-
fection, the risk for microcephaly by trimester of ZIKV infec-
tion, and the risk for other adverse outcomes associated with
congenital ZIKV infection.40
Ongoing surveillance and studies may also allow the es-
timation of the risk for maternal-fetal transmission, which has
been documented in all trimesters of pregnancy and can lead
tocongenitalmicrocephalyandotheradverseoutcomes.4,7,16,41
Currently, there are few data available to quantify either the
risk for congenital ZIKV infection or the risk for adverse out-
comes beyond microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infec-
tion. Furthermore, interventions were not accounted for in the
model. The introduction of effective countermeasures, such
as access to a wide range of effective contraceptives13 or re-
duced contact with mosquitoes through personal protection
or vector control, should result in a reduced number of infec-
tions and microcephaly cases.
Given the adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes associ-
ated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy, it is more impor-
tant than ever for women who do not currently desire preg-
nancy to use effective contraception. A 2008 hospital-based
survey among postpartum women with live-born infants in
Puerto Rico indicated that 65.5% of pregnancies were not
planned.13 Additionally, few women in Puerto Rico are using
the most effective contraceptive methods (eg, long-acting re-
versible contraception such as implants) likely owing to lim-
itedavailabilityandaccess.13WithoutavaccinetopreventZIKV
infection, increasing access to effective contraception for
women who do not desire pregnancy is a key ZIKV counter-
measure. In the context of a ZIKV outbreak, health care pro-
fessionals (eg, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician
assistants) should discuss pregnancy intentions and repro-
ductiveoptionswithwomenofreproductiveage.42Forwomen

who desire pregnancy and live in areas where ZIKV infection
may be a risk, preconception counseling should include a dis-
cussion of signs and symptoms of ZIKV infection, mosquito
prevention strategies, and the risks of ZIKV infection during
pregnancy.13,42
In addition to the need to rapidly implement prevention
strategies, public health officials need to prepare for the births
ofinfantstomotherswithZIKVinfectionduringpregnancyand
expected increase in microcephaly cases. The societal and eco-
nomic costs of birth defects are high, and total lifetime cost
of care for an infant born with structural birth defects can ex-
ceed $1 million.43,44 Furthermore, because we do not know the
full spectrum of outcomes associated with ZIKV infection dur-
ing pregnancy, public health systems need to monitor infants
and children born to ZIKV-infected pregnant women for other
potential adverse neurodevelopmental or cognitive effects.
In response to the ZIKV outbreak, PRDH leadership, in
collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, is taking critical steps to protect pregnant women
and their fetuses. Strategies implemented by PRDH leader-
ship include integrated vector control programs, dissemina-
tion of ZIKV prevention kits (containing health information,
mosquito repellent, a bed net, larvicidal tablets, and con-
doms), home-based vector control targeting pregnant women,
and approaches to improve access and availability to effec-
tive contraceptives for women who do not desire pregnancy.
In addition to these prevention efforts, the PRDH and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting sur-
veillanceandclosemonitoringofallwomeninfectedwithZIKV

special health care needs. These strategies aim to mitigate the
numbers of adverse fetal and infant outcomes associated with
ZIKV infection that threaten Puerto Rican families.
Conclusions
Zika virus infection in pregnancy causes microcephaly and has
beenassociatedwithotheradversepregnancyoutcomes.10Pre-
vention of both unintended pregnancies and ZIKV infections
in pregnant women is a public health priority for areas with
ZIKV outbreaks. Given that the outbreak in Puerto Rico started
in late 2015, urgent action is needed to implement preven-
tion measures to mitigate the devastating reproductive health
outcomes of ZIKV infection during pregnancy.12 Simultane-
ously, action is needed to prepare for the expected increase in
microcephaly cases, which will strain existing resources for
families of affected infants. It is imperative that public health
officials be prepared for and plan to provide the services these
families will need.
