S
pastic paresis can arise from a variety of conditions, including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, traumatic 
brain injury and hereditary spastic paraplegia. It is associated with muscle contracture, stiffness and pain, and can lead to segmental 
deformity. The positive, negative and biomechanical symptoms associated with spastic paresis can significantly affect patients’ 
quality of life, by affecting their ability to perform normal activities. This paper – based on the content of a global spasticity interdisciplinary 
masterclass presented by the authors for healthcare practitioners working in the field of spastic paresis – proposes a multidisciplinary 
approach to care involving not only healthcare practitioners, but also the patient and their family members/carers, and improvement of 
the transition between specialist care and community services. The suggested treatment pathway comprises assessment of the severity 
of spastic paresis, early access to neurorehabilitation and physiotherapy and treatment with botulinum toxin and new technologies, where 
appropriate. To address the challenge of maintaining patients’ motivation over the long term, tailored guided self-rehabilitation contracts 
can be used to set and monitor therapeutic goals. Current global consensus guidelines may have to be updated, to include a clinical care 
pathway related to the encompassing management of spastic paresis.

Spastic paresis may be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, 
spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, retroviral and other infectious spinal 
cord disorders, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury and hereditary 
spastic paraplegia.1 The exact prevalence of spastic paresis (in which 
spasticity is the most commonly recognised manifestation) is not known. 
However, it is estimated that around 30% of stroke survivors are affected 
by significant spasticity2 and 50% who present to hospital with stroke 
develop at least one severe contracture.3
Spastic paresis is a complex condition that may be associated with soft 
tissue contracture, pain and limitations of day-to-day activities, which have 
a substantial impact on patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life.4 Although 
treatment guidelines have been developed for (focal) spasticity,5 there 
remains a lack of consensus on key aspects of diagnosis, approaches to 
 
care and the care pathway that would help healthcare practitioners 
 
to more fully understand and manage this condition. 
To address some of these limitations, a group of physicians and a 
physiotherapist with expertise in the management of spastic paresis 
developed a global spasticity masterclass for healthcare practitioners 
working in this field in order to share best practices and to discuss 
issues and current trends in the management of patients with spasticity. 
 
The outputs of this masterclass are presented here.
Pathophysiology and defnitions
Spastic paresis
Spasticity is one of several components of spastic paresis, also known 
as the upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome. Spastic paresis is primarily 
characterised by a quantitative lack of command directed to agonist 
muscles involved in performing movements.1,6,7 In addition, hyperactive 
spinal reflexes mediate some of the positive phenomena seen in spastic 
paresis, while other positive symptoms are related to disordered control of 
voluntary movement in terms of an abnormal efferent drive or are caused

by prolonged spontaneous firing driven by so-called ‘persistent inward 
currents’ intrinsic to the motoneuron leading to ‘plateau potentials’.8 
A UMN lesion disturbs the balance of supraspinal inhibitory and excitatory 
inputs, producing a state of disinhibition of the spinal reflexes. These 
include proprioceptive (stretch) and nociceptive (flexor withdrawal 
and extensor) reflexes. The changes in muscle tone probably result 
from alterations in the balance of inputs from reticulospinal and other 
subcortical descending pathways to the motor and interneuronal circuits 
of the spinal cord, and the absence of an intact corticospinal system. 
Loss of descending tonic or phasic excitatory and inhibitory inputs 
 
to the spinal motor system and alterations in the segmental balance of 
excitatory and inhibitory control may be observed.5 Following brain and/
or spinal cord injury, the input from higher levels (sensorimotor cortex) 
may be reduced or completely lost, resulting in insufficient regulation 
of muscle (reflex) activity. The clinical appearance is a non-physiological 
 
flexion or extension of the affected limbs.
In spastic paresis, increased joint stiffness in the relaxed condition can 
be of either neural (hyperreflexia, ‘spasticity’) or non-neural origin (altered 
tissue viscoelastic properties and contractures resulting from soft tissue 
shortening).1,9,10 Overall, three problems co-exist around each joint: stretch-
sensitive paresis, muscle overactivity and soft tissue contracture.1,6 Usually, 
spasticity precedes the occurrence of soft tissue contracture, but soft 
tissue shortening may also precede spasticity as a result of immobility. 
None of the three mechanisms of impairment are symmetrically 
 
distributed between agonist and antagonist muscles. Furthermore, 
reduced activity in the agonist contributes to shortening and overactivity 
in a usually less-paretic antagonist muscle. As a result, torque imbalance 
occurs around joints, which leads to the well-known limb deformities. 
For more than 150 years, physiologists have tried to explain spastic 
paresis in terms of why and how reflexes are enhanced; however, it is 
now understood that the overall involvement of antagonist resistance, 
whether of a reflex nature or not, is the critical factor in movement 
impairment in spastic paresis.1,6,11
The term ‘spasticity’ has been inconsistently defined.12 Often, the 
measures used to assess spasticity do not correspond to the defined 
clinical features of spasticity. A definition from the 1980s focuses on 
spinal reflexes, describing spasticity as “a motor disorder, characterised 
by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) 
with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyper-excitability of the 
stretch reflex as one component of the UMN syndrome”.13 Another 
definition, from the European Thematic Network to Develop Standardized 
Measures of Spasticity (the SPASM Consortium) in 2005, combined the 
positive symptoms and described spasticity as “disordered sensorimotor 
control, resulting from an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion, presenting 
as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscle”.5
 
Existing spasticity can be worsened by other conditions such as 
constipation, urinary tract infections or pressure ulcers.14
Signs and symptoms of spastic paresis 
Spastic paresis is characterised by a combination of positive, 
 
negative and biomechanical symptoms. Positive symptoms include 
tendon 
hyperreflexia, 
clonus, 
increased 
tonic 
stretch 
reflexes 
(hypertonia), the clasp-knife phenomenon, flexor and extensor spasms, 
pathological (spastic) co-contractions, associated reactions and spastic 
dystonia.6,13 Negative symptoms include weakness and lack of co-
ordination. Positive and negative symptoms are primary (i.e., directly 
caused by the corticospinal lesion), whereas biomechanical changes are 
secondary; however, they all interact, resulting in muscle stiffness and 
contracture (Figure 1).6,15 
Spasticity
Spasticity is the most commonly recognised manifestation of spastic 
paresis, but is only one of the components that characterise spastic paresis;5 
however, it should be noted that, while nearly always present, spasticity 
is not always clinically detectable in patients with spastic paresis.16 
Decreasing spasticity does not always improve active movement, 
indicating that spasticity in terms of exaggerated reflex activity may not 
be the main contributor to the movement impairment.
In patients with spinal cord injuries, disinhibition of spinal reflexes 
and prolonged spontaneous firing of spinal motoneurons may be an 
important mechanism associated with spasticity. In contrast, abnormal 
efferent activity seems to be the main mechanism in patients who 
have experienced a stroke and in patients with hereditary spastic 
paraplegia.10,17,18 The abnormal efferent drive is often characterised 
by pathological (spastic) co-contraction. Spastic co-contraction is a 
phenomenon of supraspinal origin and is defined as an excessive degree 
of antagonistic activation in response to voluntary agonist command.6,7,19 
This pathological co-contraction originates from the misdirection of 
the supraspinal descending pathways, particularly from the brainstem, 
resulting in pathologically co-activated antagonistic muscles to a point 
where the intended movement may be reversed in some instances.6 
Stretched position of the co-contracting muscle aggravates this 
condition, and the extent of deformity associated with it limits the 
patient’s movement.6,19,20
Muscle contracture
Muscle contracture can be the result of prolonged spasticity, but it may 
also precede spasticity as a result of immobility. It can begin to develop 
as soon as a few hours after the onset of immobilisation.1
Spastic dystonia
Spastic dystonia is also of supraspinal origin and is characterised by 
excessive tonic muscle activation at rest. It may be superimposed on 
soft tissue contracture, causing deformities around affected joints.20

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
How Can We Improve Current Practice in Spastic Paresis? 
These deformities have a significant impact on quality of life, and patients 
often desire a normalised body shape even if physical function cannot 
be restored.6
Assessment of spastic paresis 
Healthcare practitioners need to be able to assess the severity of 
spastic paresis to determine the most appropriate course of treatment 
and to monitor the progress of that treatment. A number of methods 
can be combined to make a full assessment. 
Clinical assessment
Assessing function and mobility are the primary aim of the clinical 
assessment, besides recognising potential urgent issues of skin lesions 
or pain due to muscle overactivity.21
 
Verified scales provide the clinician with the means of making 
reproducible, routine clinical assessments of the patient’s mobility and 
ability to perform activities of daily life. For example, active function can 
be assessed using the Modified Frenchay Scale, which assesses arm and 
hand use in 10 predefined everyday life activities,21 while a walking test 
(10 m or 2 minutes) is well validated for assessing lower limb activity. 
Functional evaluation can guide further technical assessments 
of antagonist resistances. For such assessments, each potential 
antagonistic muscle can be assessed in three validated steps:20–22 
• Step 1: passive range of movement (ROM) is tested by clinician-
controlled slow (V1) and strong movements to estimate the loss of 
length and level of stiffness (muscle extensibility: XV1).
• Step 2: brisk and fast passive movements (V3) are used to estimate 
the level of the neural reflex compon ent (partially reflecting motor 
neuronal excitability: XV3). 
• Step 3: the active ROM against the antagonistic muscles (XA) is 
estimated by balancing the agonist activity against the passive and 
active antagonist resistances.
For each tested antagonist (e.g. biceps brachii when stretching the 
elbow), a coefficient of shortening can be derived (XN–XV1)/XN, 
where XN is the normal expected passive amplitude at the given joint 
(e.g. the elbow). A coefficient of weakness (XV1–XA)/XV1 can also be 
calculated, providing a sense of the motor command difficulty, taking 
soft tissue length and stiffness into account. 
A fourth factor may also be assessed but this has not yet been 
validated. This is the repeatability of the agonist (e.g. triceps brachii) 
effort to oppose the antagonist.20,21 The patient is asked to perform 
rapid alternating movements of maximal amplitude against the 
assessed antagonist for 15 seconds and then the amplitude achieved 
during the last movement of the series (XA15) is measured and 
compared with XA. The measure of the coefficient of fatigability (XA–
XA15)/XA provides information on the fatigability of motor command 
(fatigue may potentially increase agonist paresis and antagonist co-
contraction) and can be used to assess the impact of treatments.
Steps 1 and 2 above (measurement of the angles XV1 and XV3) constitute 
what has been termed the Tardieu Scale,21,22 and are reliable in adults 
 
and children.21,23
 
The widely used Ashworth Scale14 and modified Ashworth Scale24 
are based on an ordinal scale that rates resistance to passive 
movement. The Ashworth Scale and modified Ashworth Scale may be 
 
used interchangeably. Criticisms made of the Ashworth Scale are the 
 
difficulties in making comparisons between body segments and 
 
the lack of accuracy and consistency resulting from this and the need 
to combine measures of soft tissue contracture, spastic dystonia and 
spasticity to obtain a score.25
More recently, a five-step assessment has been proposed.21 This new 
scale incorporates the measurements of Xv1 and Xv3, as described 
in the Tardieu Scale, but also includes functional measurements such 
 
as the results of a walk test or Modified Frenchay assessment, the 
maximal active range of motion against the antagonist muscle and 
 
the residual active amplitude measured 15 seconds after completing 
a series of maximum amplitude rapid alternating movements. This 
expanded range of measurements provides a more accurate diagnosis 
of the causes of the patient’s functional difficulties and allows treatment 
to be more precisely tailored to the patient’s needs.21
Clinically non-rateable phenomena
Measurements of stretch resistance cannot discriminate between 
neural and non-neural mechanisms of muscle stiffness.26 Spastic co-
contraction and spastic dystonia cannot be rated clinically and instead 
are assessed by electromyography.6,19 It should be noted, however, 
that this technique cannot distinguish between involuntary (reflexes) 
and voluntary (co-contraction) components if the limb segment is 
moving. However, spastic co-contraction can be easily assessed in 
isometric conditions.19
Spastic dystonia can be assessed at the elbow, for example, by 
electromyography of the elbow flexors while one passively, slowly 
extends the patient arm from 150 to 0 degrees; results can be 
compared with the activity seen in the non-paretic arm when using 
 
the same manoeuvre.1,6
Paresis may be assessed by electromyography using the twitch 
interpolation technique. In healthy biceps, 95–99% of motor units can be 
recruited during maximal voluntary effort.27,28 In patients with brain injury, 
the unaffected side has been shown to be approximately 10% paretic 
(89% activity), and on the paretic side, around 66% of motor units were 
shown to be activated by motor command.29,30 
Spastic co-contraction can be assessed by asking the patient to perform 
isometric movements, either from a flexed or extended position.19
On-going challenges in the assessment of  
spastic paresis
Few studies have investigated muscle overactivity in more than a single 
joint and within the context of realistic, active movements.31 Another 
challenge when assessing spastic paresis is the fact that stretch 
reflexes are not unequivocally enhanced (lowered threshold, increased 
gain), especially during active movement.32 They are not simply velocity 
dependent, but are also dependent on joint position and muscle length 
– they are, therefore, movement dependent.32 In addition, muscle (over)
activity may be present after slow stretch or even at rest (spastic 
dystonia).6 The ability to assess these aspects of spastic paresis remains 
an unmet need.
Management of patients with spastic paresis
Neurorehabilitation aims to change patients’ lives to give them a 
higher level of independence.33 Accordingly, an improvement in the 
 82

understanding of the required quality of neurorehabilitation has taken 
place in recent decades. 
In a clinical setting, about one-third of patients with chronic post-
stroke symptoms attending rehabilitation clinics have symptomatic 
upper limb hypertonia; passive function (ease of care) is the domain 
most commonly affected, and higher Ashworth Scale scores correlate 
with the likelihood of experiencing symptomatic muscle overactivity.34 
The aim of treatment of spastic paresis is to reduce physical symptoms 
(including muscle tightness and spasms, fatigue and hypersensitivity to 
touch and pain) and improve the patient’s ability to perform individual 
activities and participate in daily life.35 Consequently, management of a 
patient with spastic paresis is complex, with many factors influencing 
their care pathway. 
Even in the early part of the 21st century, many interventions remain 
mostly palliative and focused on prevention of contracture, pressure 
sores and pain. Today, they involve significant patient participation, 
 
and diverse and targeted programmes that focus on the patient’s quality 
of life and reintegration into society.36 Despite this, current rehabilitation 
treatments often have a disappointingly modest effect on impairment 
early or late after stroke and there are no agreed pathways for 
 
different clinical situations, although there is good evidence for use 
of different interventions in the upper versus lower extremities.37
 
The treatment approach should be tailored according to whether the 
patient is in the early or chronic stage of his/her condition and whether 
the aim is to restore or maintain function. It is important to evaluate 
patients on an individual level to determine the characteristics associated 
with their spasticity and the goals of their treatment.38
 
Physical therapy
Physical therapy strategies include lengthening of the shorter of the 
two muscles around the joint, rapid alternating movement exercises 
 
of maximal amplitude and teaching self-management strategies.39
The issue of whether stretch is effective for the treatment or prevention 
of contractures is debatable. A systematic review of 25 randomised 
controlled trials and controlled clinical trials found that regular stretch 
does not produce clinically important changes in joint mobility, pain, 
spasticity or activity limitation in people with neurological conditions.40
Nevertheless, it has been observed that stretch postures may lengthen, 
strengthen and widen muscles if done for an adequate daily duration.41 
Lengthening the muscle is important as it can improve the range and 
control of movement, gait and the ability to walk up and down stairs.
The question of frequency, load and duration of muscle stretching has 
been addressed in a randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy 
of positioning the affected muscle in extension and external rotation to 
prevent contracture shortly after stroke.41 Stretching activity for at least 
30 minutes a day should be started as soon as possible.41 Also, asking 
patients to perform rapid alternating movements of maximal amplitude 
can help to reduce muscle co-contraction.39,42–44 A simple exercise of 
repetitive finger flexion/extension movements for 15 minutes twice 
a day has been demonstrated to increase grip strength and peak 
 
finger extension force compared with traditional therapy.42 The benefits 
of repetitive exercises have also been shown for recovery of functional 
arm use.43,44 Finally, a programme of alternating elbow flexion/
extension movements has been shown to be effective in reducing 
antagonistic co-contractions and increasing voluntary control 
 
of forearm supination.39,45
Intensity can be enhanced using robotic devices from the start to 
increase the number of movement repetitions. Current data on available 
technological approaches that use high-intensity and repetitive task-
specific practice indicate that better results are achieved in the arm than 
the hand.46 However, in patients with long-term upper limb deficits due 
to stroke, robot-assisted therapy does not significantly improve motor 
function at 12 weeks beyond that seen with usual care or intensive 
therapy.47 Similar results have been seen in lower limb rehabilitation.48 
If muscle overactivity occurs, injection with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT; 
see below) may decrease co-contraction and will allow the patient 
to continue with intensive rehabilitation.49 This approach contributes 
 
to brain plasticity more effectively in the early stages of recovery, leading to 
enhanced recovery of voluntary control of segmental limb movements.50
 
Bimanual rehabilitation is also used in patients after stroke.51 Bimanual 
co-ordination in patients during standard post-stroke rehabilitation 
starts to become efficient 6 weeks after onset of stroke, and so it is 
recommended after this time point.51 A systematic review on current 
neurorehabilitation therapies for spasticity attests to the robustness of 
some techniques over others.52
Botulinum toxin A 
Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has a grade A recommendation from 
the American Academy of Neurology for the treatment of spasticity in 
adults and children.53,54 A meta-analysis of 16 clinical studies with BoNT-A 
indicated that it safely and effectively decreases muscle tone and 
increases range of motion.55
 
BoNT-A has dual peripheral effects, namely the chemodenervation 
of cholinergic transmission in both extrafusal and intrafusal muscle 
fibres.56 BoNT-A-induced changes in sensory input through denervation 
of the intrafusal muscle fibres may be essential in modulating loss of 
presynaptic inhibition in dystonia. In addition, BoNT-A injections into the 
shorter of the two co-contracting muscles around the joint will augment 
stretching activities. There is also some evidence for modulation of 
sensorimotor loops at the spinal and supraspinal level, as assessed by 
neurophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
technologies (i.e. before and after BoNT-A treatment).57
 
BoNT-A requires 24–72 hours to take effect. The peak effect occurs 
from 10 days to 4 weeks, depending on the clinical situation; clinical 
improvements usually last for up to 12 to 20 weeks.58 It must be 
recognised that BoNT-A treatment is limited in widespread multifocal 
muscle overactivity, and treatment effects are only temporary,20,51 opening 
a therapeutic window for a combined neurorehabilitative approach. 
 
The reversibility of BoNT-A effects may lead to repeated treatment 
in chronic muscle overactivity, but may perhaps modify the course of 
muscle overactivity in early post-stroke intervention.59
Several studies have investigated the effect of BoNT-A on post-stroke 
upper limb function and mobility, usually combined with an exercise 
programme.43,60–63 Treatment with BoNT-A gave a notable improvement 
in hand function, and hence improvements in self-care tasks and other 
activities of daily living, and alleviated pain. Reaching and grasping 
functions were improved but not significantly so. These findings suggest 
that – in contrast to the traditional approach – it may be worth initially 
focusing on recovery of control of hand movements after stroke.

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
How Can We Improve Current Practice in Spastic Paresis? 
The optimal time to administer BoNT-A may be when muscle 
overactivity becomes evident and bothersome to the patient, resulting 
in impairment of active and passive functions, disability and associated 
reactions, or when it induces pain.59 The Upper Limb International 
Spasticity Study (ULIS)-II showed that the large majority (80%) of 
patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity treated with BoNT-A in a 
real-life clinical setting achieved their treatment goals, mainly in terms 
of passive and active functions and pain reduction.64
 
Early single-dose BoNT-A treatment (<3 months after stroke) of 
 
spasticity has been investigated in three upper limb studies 
(summarised in Figure 2).65–68 In the first study, a small cohort of 
patients with no arm function was found to benefit functionally.65 In the 
second study, development of disabling finger flexion was significantly 
reduced compared with placebo.66 In the third study, a sustained 
reduction in muscle tone was observed for 6 months following a 
single fixed dose of BoNT-A.67 Early use of BoNT-A may extend the 
time window for motor re-learning with physiotherapy by decreasing 
overactive extrafusal muscle fibres and reducing muscle spindle 
sensitivity through chemodenervation of intrafusal muscle fibres.69 
In effect, the early BoNT-A intervention paradigm may potentially 
modify the natural progress of spasticity, prevent spasticity/dystonia-
related complications or even delay re-injection. Nevertheless, it is 
important to consider that there may be a time lag between maximum 
reduction in tone and functional gain, possibly related to the time 
required to learn how to use the increased segmental ROM after 
reduction in hypertonicity.63
Clinical trials of BoNT-A use in infants and children with spasticity 
due to cerebral palsy have demonstrated that contractures and 
deformities during growth can be reduced, spasticity in the upper 
and lower extremities reduced and ROM in the joints of the lower 
limbs increased.70–72 Early use of BoNT-A in key muscles in children 
with cerebral palsy seems to limit the development of spasticity and 
to increase their likelihood of achieving important developmental 
milestones (e.g. sitting, crawling and standing).73
A systematic review of methods to improve outcomes following BoNT-A 
for treatment of limb spasticity identified 10 adjunct therapies.74 There 
was level 1 evidence for electrical stimulation, modified constraint-
induced movement therapy and physiotherapy and level 2 evidence 
for casting and dynamic splinting.74 In contrast, there was level 1 and 
2 evidence that adjunct taping, segmental muscle vibration, cyclic 
functional electrical stimulation and motorised arm ergometer may 
not improve outcomes compared with BoNT-A injections alone.74
Other pharmacological interventions 
A systematic review of the effectiveness of pharmacological 
interventions in reducing spasticity of the lower limb in chronic stroke 
survivors analysed outcomes from nine randomised controlled trials.75 
Of these, four provided evidence of BoNT-A efficacy.75 One study provided 
evidence that both alcohol and phenol neurolytics were effective in 
reducing spasticity.75 The final four studies provided evidence that oral 
and intrathecal medications were effective in reducing lower limb 
spasticity compared to placebo.75 
Assistive devices
Assistive devices can help with lost function and provide the patient 
with a more independent way of living. They should not, however, 
be used as substitutes for physiotherapy. The cost of such devices 
does not have to be high to be of benefit to the patient (e.g. simple 
adaptation of a wheelchair for one-handed control). Low budget 
assistive devices can also be used to aid rehabilitation exercises, 
such as the resonating arm exerciser. This simple mechanical device, 
which snaps onto a manual wheelchair, uses resonance to assist in 
arm training, and provides an effective method for increasing arm 
movement ability in patients after severe chronic hemiparetic stroke.76
Future Options for Treatment
The ipsilateral motor pathway is a normal motor control pathway and 
is important clinically because it can contribute to motor recovery 
in the early stages after the onset of stroke.77 The pathway innervates 
proximal muscles and contributes more to movements of the legs than 
 
of the hands.
Virtual reality rehabilitation-based therapy in post-stroke patients has 
been investigated. In a recently published study, motor rehabilitation 
was promoted by challenging patients with simple computer games 
representative of daily activities of self-support.78 This therapy has 
demonstrated clinical value, although the underlying changes in 
neuronal reorganisation responsible for the behavioural improvements 
are unclear. The use of new technologies, such as robotic and non-
invasive brain stimulation for neurorehabilitation, may also be 
appropriate for both in- and outpatient rehabilitation in the future. Tests 
using functional MRI have shown that contralesional activation of the 
unaffected motor cortex, cerebellar recruitment and compensatory 
prefrontal cortex activation were the most prominent activations 
involved with movement command.78 Upon commencing therapy there 
was a significant correlation between motor dexterity and total recruited 
activity (p<0.05), and overall brain activity during therapy was inversely 
related to normalised behavioural improvements (p<0.05).78 It would 
appear, therefore, that prefrontal cortex and cerebellar activity are the 
driving forces of the recovery associated with this type of therapy. 
The care pathway in spastic paresis

met, they may enter a period of mourning or despair and/or develop 
a loss of self-worth and feelings of isolation.79 Patients then either 
reject the need for further help or develop a more positive attitude of 
determination to beat the new obstacle facing them. If guided carefully, 
patients will ultimately adjust towards accepting the disability as a new 
part of themselves, learning to cope with it and integrating it into their 
daily lives. 
Community reintegration after acquired brain injury involves many stages 
(Figure 3),80 beginning with regaining physical function and establishing 
independence, both of which start within the clinical setting. After 
discharge, patients then need to adjust their expectations to what they 
can do in their home environment. They will often have a lot of free time 
as a result of the impact of the stroke on their ability to carry out their 
usual daily routine, and they need to learn to fill this gap with meaningful 
and achievable activities. Here, self-management approaches will be 
essential to overcome a threatening halt in rehabilitation activities.45
 
Individual coping strategies after a stroke may influence recovery. 
A review of 14 studies reporting ten different types of coping strategies 
found that there was considerable stability in coping strategies over 
the long term, whether they be problem-focused, emotion-focused 
or avoidance strategies.81 Patients demonstrating avoidance coping 
strategies need particular attention because they are at increased risk 
of anxiety and depression. 
The multidisciplinary approach
A multidisciplinary approach to the care of patients with spastic paresis, 
with clear and effective communication between all stakeholders 
(including the patient and his/her family), may improve outcomes. Recent 
evidence supports a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only the 
healthcare team (clinician[s], physical therapist, occupational therapist, 
etc.), but also the patient and their family or caregiver(s).35,80 However, 
more evidence is needed to establish the optimal types (modalities, 
therapy approaches and settings) and intensities of therapy for improving 
active and passive function in adults and children with post-stroke 
spasticity, in the short and longer term.82
The recommendations for a multidisciplinary approach are summarised 
in Figure 4.
Role of the physician
From the clinical perspective, a number of obstacles may need to be 
addressed, such as lack of agreement regarding level of functioning 
and agreed care pathways, when to begin treatment and the goals to 
be set for the long term. Many physicians have limited time to set goals 
and analyse outcomes. Improved training of physicians and the use of 
a standardised list are key in improving goal-setting in clinical practice. 
 
A number of factors will influence and are relevant to neurorehabilitation 
and should be taken into account. These include: patient-related factors, 
e.g. state of mind and personality; exercise-related factors, e.g. type, 
intensity and structure; physician-related factors, e.g. the ability to give 
adequate feedback; and environmental impact.83
The ULIS programme has helped to identify what physicians say they do 
(ULIS-I) and what they really do (ULIS-II) in routine clinical practice.64
Role of the physical and occupational therapist
Physical and occupational therapy are key interventions within 
multidisciplinary care, not only to prevent orthopaedic complications as a 
result of muscle shortening,41 but also to establish an adequate exercise 
programme and set realistic goals. It is vital that the patient commits to 
performing individual daily exercises and documenting them regularly, so 
that the therapists can review them. This allows feedback on current and 
expected performance, as well as technical and psychological support. 
This would be a key component of a guided self-rehabilitation contract 
(see below) between patients and their clinical teams, including physical 
and occupational therapists.45
 
Role of family/caregivers 
Involving the patient’s family and/or caregivers with the rehabilitation 
team from the early stages of neurorehabilitation through to long-
term follow-up is known to work well.84 Family and caregivers are key 
members of the team and it is important that they receive all necessary 
information and support from the beginning of the treatment journey. 
They should be aware of the goals of therapy and what their role will be. 
Their concerns regarding impairments and symptoms experienced by 
the patient should be addressed and they should also be encouraged 
to share relevant details that could inform treatment. This will help to 
promote confidence in managing the patient’s needs. An important step 
is to implement home visits prior to hospital discharge. Realistic goals 
should take into account the individual’s capacity to follow instructions,

Masterclass recommendations
The journey for a patient with an acquired brain injury begins in the 
intensive care unit, where the immediate priority is the life of the 
patient. After moving to the acute rehabilitation care unit, the second 
priority is preservation of muscle length. Family and carers will be 
integrated into the partnership with the rehabilitation team before 
the patient’s transition through the rehabilitation centre and back into 
daily life. Effective and smooth transitioning from acute to long-term 
management requires clear communication pathways between all 
stakeholders. 
Patients should be carefully evaluated and frequently reviewed in 
team meetings, and the timing and structure of discharge should 
be planned around the individual patient’s needs. This will include 
planning for home visits, interaction with the community to prepare 
for housing, continued support on an outpatient basis and – in some 
cases – return to work or school. A comprehensive, standardised and 
easy to understand discharge report, which includes instructions for 
self-stretch, active self-exercises and a follow-up plan, should be 
provided to the primary care team.

as well as patient, family and caregiver opinions on the feasibility of 
tasks. This approach helps caregivers to improve their knowledge 
 
of the patient’s condition, creates realistic expectations of the benefits 
and harms of chosen options and reduces potential conflicts and 
passivity in decision-making.
Guided self-rehabilitation contracts
Behavioural experience is fundamental to the promotion of brain 
plasticity. After a brain lesion has occurred, patients often present with 
self-imposed hypoactivity, which can cause a halt in brain plasticity and 
might contribute to worsening capacities of neuronal recruitment.85 
Ultimately, this may lead to additional cognitive and motor decline, 
which in turn further promotes hypoactivity and becomes a vicious 
cycle of ‘disuse’. The process of rehabilitation after a stroke needs a 
long-term commitment and requires dedicated time every day in order 
to improve outcomes and escape the potentially vicious cycle.45,86–88 
In most cases, more than an hour of rehabilitation is needed daily. 
The challenge is to motivate patients to adhere to a long-term self-
rehabilitation programme of repetitive and difficult exercises. This 
motivation can be achieved through appropriate goal-setting, technical 
guidance (guided self-rehabilitation) and psychological support, 
mediated by regular and long-standing follow-up by a rehabilitation 
professional. All of these actions will help patients to achieve and 
maintain the state of mind necessary to acquire new motor skills.33,45
 
As part of a guided self-rehabilitation contract, it has been proposed 
that patients agree to undertake and document a series of 
individualised daily exercises, which are as important as taking daily 
medication, and the therapist agrees to coach the patient (technical 
guidance and encouragement) over the long term. The terms of 
the contract are based on the examination by the clinician and 
therapists, and entail an acceptance that rehabilitation is a long-term 
undertaking. The contract can be updated as the patient progresses. 
A 2-year, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (Neurorestore) is 
currently underway to compare the value of guided self-rehabilitation 
contracts with that of conventional community therapy, in terms of 
functional, psychological and social impact (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 
NCT02202954). Potential benefits of this process are expected 
to include optimisation of the output of individual physiotherapy 
sessions; increased daily duration of active exercise performed 
by the patient and the provision of on-going counselling and care 
over the long term. It is anticipated that limitations may arise when 
patients have severe cognitive impairments, such as major aphasia 
or difficulties with attention or comprehension. The success of this 
approach will also depend on the commitment of the patient’s family 
and/or caregiver.
Summary
This review of some of the key aspects of the assessment and treatment 
of patients with spastic paresis highlights the need for a cohesive, 
multidisciplinary approach to the patient’s journey from diagnosis of 
acquired brain injury to long-term rehabilitation. 
Approaches to this should include the setting and monitoring of 
realistic therapeutic goals, in particular through the use of guided 
self-rehabilitation contracts, which could help provide more intensive 
rehabilitation to patients. Treatment plans should also consider 
therapeutic agents, where appropriate. Improved training is needed for 
healthcare practitioners to raise awareness of the pathophysiology of 
spastic paresis and hence the value of integrated treatment plans that 
include rehabilitation therapy in the acute phase. q

CALL TO ACTION
There is an outstanding need to optimise the patient journey 
 
and treatment outcomes in spastic paresis. To accomplish these 
goals, we must:
• Educate: not only clinicians and physiotherapists, but also 
patients’ family members and caregivers, and, vitally, the patients 
themselves
• Communicate: between the stakeholders so that all are aware of 
the patient’s treatment goals and progress, and of new treatment 
opportunities
• Integrate: between specialist rehabilitation units and community 
centres and using a multidisciplinary team approach comprising 
clinicians, physiotherapists, caregivers and patients
• Promote: personalised goal-setting in clinical practice to engage 
patients
• Facilitate: the use of individualised guided self-rehabilitation 
contracts, once they are proven to be more effective than 
conventional therapy
• Innovate: with continued research into assessment and therapies 
for spastic paresis

S
pastic paresis is a complex condition associated with damage to the upper motor neurons, typically caused by cerebral palsy, 
multiple sclerosis, stroke or trauma. Despite substantial impact on patients’ independence and burden on caregivers, there is a lack 
of consensus on optimal management of this condition and the patient journey remains unclear. A group of physicians, experienced 
in spasticity management, recently convened with the objective of analysing the patient journey from a care pathway perspective in different 
geographical regions and under different conditions from acute phase to long-term/chronic disease status. The experts reviewed results 
from recent patient and healthcare practitioner surveys on the subject and assessed how current patient pathways could be improved, using 
their own experiences to highlight the issues related to management deficiencies in their individual countries. The group divided the patient 
journey into steps, considering the evidence from the point of view of healthcare practitioners, patients, caregivers and funders/payors. 
This paper is a response to the lack of consensus on the optimal management of spastic paresis, and acts as a call to action to develop a 
consistent care pathway that could be applied across a broad range of illnesses, using an interdisciplinary approach.
