AbstrAct
background/aim Exercise imparts a load on tendon 
tissue that leads to changes in tendon properties. Studies 
suggest that loading immediately reduces tendon 
thickness, with a loss of this response in symptomatic 
tendinopathy. No studies investigating the response of 
tendon dimensions to load for the rotator cuff tendons 
exist. This study aimed to examine the short-term effect of 
loading on the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon and 
acromiohumeral distance those with and without rotator 
cuff tendinopathy.
Methods Participants were 20 painfree controls, 
and 23 people with painful rotator cuff tendinopathy. 
Supraspinatus tendon thickness and acromiohumeral 
distance were measured using ultrasound scans before, 
and at three time points after loading (1, 6 and 24 hours). 
Loading involved isokinetic eccentric and concentric 
external rotation and abduction.
results There was a significant increase in 
supraspinatus tendon thickness in the pain group at 1 (7%, 
∆=0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.57) and 6 hours (11%, ∆=0.53, 
95% CI 0.34 to 0.71), although only the 6 hours difference 
exceeded minimal detectable difference. In contrast, 
there was a small non-significant reduction in thickness 
in controls. The acromiohumeral distance reduced 
significantly in both groups at 1 hour (controls: ∆=0.64, 
95% CI 0.38 to 0.90; pain: ∆=1.1, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33), 
with a larger change from baseline in the pain group.
conclusion Those diagnosed with painful supraspinatus 
tendinopathy demonstrated increased thickening with 
delayed return to baseline following loading. Rehabilitation 
professionals may need to take into account the impact 
of loading to fatigue when planning rehabilitation 
programmes.
IntroductIon
Mechanical loading induces positive adap-
tive changes in mechanical, morphological 
and biomechanical properties in healthy 
tendon.1 2 However, overloading may lead 
to tendinopathy, characterised by pain and 
reduced function.3 Tendon loading may 
therefore have both beneficial and detri-
mental effects on the tissue in both the short 
and long term.
There may be a differential effect of loading 
in normal (asymptomatic) and symptomatic 
tendons. A systematic review of the immediate 
effects of exercise on the Achilles tendon, 
reported that healthy Achilles tendons 
reduced in diameter immediately after exer-
cise, in particular with eccentric contractions. 
In contrast, symptomatic Achilles tendons 
increased in thickness and MRI signal after 
eccentric and concentric loading indicating 
possible higher water content or tendon 
hyperaemia.4 Other studies support slower 
return 
to 
baseline 
tendon 
characteris-
tics5 6 in those with tendinopathy. Therefore, 
it is important to compare both healthy 
and pathological tendons when evaluating 
loading responses.
Due to different functional roles and 
composition, the rotator cuff (RC) tendons 
may respond differently than the lower limb 
tendons, yet the response of the RC tendons 
to loading has not been extensively investi-
gated. In one of the few studies to examine 
tendon responses in vivo in the upper limb, 
van Drongelen et al7 examined acute changes 
in biceps tendon diameter in wheelchair 
athletes (a third of the athletes had shoulder 
pain) after a single basketball or rugby game.

What are the new findings?
 
► The supraspinatus tendon in painful shoulders 
significantly increased in thickness in response 
to acute fatigue loading compared with pain-free 
controls.
 
► Loading the rotator cuff to fatigue also resulted in 
a reduced subacromial space, with recovery to 
baseline delayed up to 24 hours in people with 
painful rotator cuff tendinopathy.
 
► Rehabilitation 
programmes 
for 
rotator 
cuff 
tendinopathy need to take into account the potential 
for increased tendon thickness and reduced 
subacromial space after loading, by allowing 
appropriate recovery periods after loading to fatigue.

The authors reported a non-significant increase in 
tendon thickness and ultrasound echogenicity related to 
duration of play.
Impingement of the supraspinatus tendon due to 
acromial compression in a reduced subacromial space is 
a widely held pathomechanical theory for the develop-
ment of RC tendinopathy.8 However, studies examining 
subacromial space, represented by the linear acromio-
humeral distance (AHD), in RC tendinopathy do not 
consistently report changes compared with pain-free 
shoulders, except in those with substantial RC tendon 
tears.9 10 Increased supraspinatus tendon (SsT) thickness 
is a feature of RC tendinopathy.11 The interaction between 
a thickened tendon and a potentially reduced subacro-
mial space was examined by Michener et al,12 calculating 
the occupation ratio (the ratio between supraspinatus 
thickness and AHD), in people with shoulder pain and 
age-matched controls. This study reported a thicker 
tendon in the group with shoulder pain resulting in a 
larger occupation ratio, despite no significant between-
group difference in subacromial space.
These results suggest that tendon thickening may be an 
early pathological response that may subsequently lead 
to tendon compression as a secondary phenomenon, 
due to the larger tendon occupying a fixed subacromial 
space.12 While cross-sectional studies inform mechanisms 
of supraspinatus tendinopathy, it is important to examine 
these processes longitudinally in response to loading, as 
this better replicates the clinical presentation of painful 
RC tendinopathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
examine the short-term effect of loading on thickness of 
the SsT and the AHD in people with and without painful 
RC tendinopathy.
Methods
Participants (both controls and shoulder pain group) 
were recruited from community-based settings. Controls 
were men and women aged over 18 years, and included 
if they were free of shoulder pain over the last year, had 
full pain-free range of motion (ROM), did not have 
neurological or systemic rheumatological disorders, 
history of shoulder fracture, dislocation or surgery or any 
contraindications to ultrasound imaging. Shoulder pain 
participants were men and women aged over 18 years with 
a current history of unilateral shoulder pain, but still able 
to undertake some physical exercise with their shoulder 
(defined as 15 min of moderate arm exercise, such as 
tennis or housework). They were excluded if they had 
bilateral shoulder pain, had ever undergone shoulder 
surgery, had >50% restriction of shoulder ROM (to rule 
out frozen shoulder), had any neurological or systemic 
rheumatological disorders or contraindications to ultra-
sound imaging. The study received ethical approval from 
the relevant Research Ethics Committee and all volun-
teers provided written informed consent.
The diagnosis of RC tendinopathy is challenging, with 
both imaging-based and clinical diagnostic approaches 
having significant flaws.13 While Hegedus et al reported 
that no shoulder clinical diagnostic tests in isolation 
provide an accurate diagnosis of pathology,14 a combina-
tion of five tests (painful arc, empty can, external rotation 
resistance, Neer and Hawkins and Kennedy) were best 
able to predict RC tendinopathy.15 A cut-off of three 
out of five positive tests was used to clinically confirm 
RC pathology,15 while less than three positive tests ruled 
it out. Control participants were required to have a 
maximum of two positive tests, with a minimum of three 
positive tests in the pain group. Tendon pathology has 
been reported in many imaging studies of symptom-free 
shoulders.13 To best reflect current clinical practice, we 
combined both clinical and ultrasound diagnoses for the 
symptomatic participants.
Ultrasound examinations were undertaken using a GE 
Logiq e ultrasound scanner (GE Medical, Wauwatosa, 
Wisconsin, USA), with a 12 MHz linear probe, by a physio-
therapist also qualified as a musculoskeletal sonographer, 
specialising in shoulder and tendon imaging. To enhance 
validity, static ultrasound images were independently 
reviewed by a radiologist to confirm imaging diagnoses 
for the symptomatic group. To produce as homogeneous 
sample as possible, control participants were excluded at 
this stage if any tendinopathy (loss of the normal fibrillar 
structure of the tendon with an abnormally hypoechoic 
appearance), partial tear of the SsT (flattening of the 
tendon surface or presence of hypoechoic defect within, 
or on either surface of, the tendon) or full-thickness tears 
(focal defect extending from the bursal to the humeral 
side of the tendon, or complete non-visualisation of the 
tendon) was found. Only one control volunteer (who 
had met the clinical testing criteria) was excluded using 
these criteria. For participants with unilateral shoulder 
symptoms, the painful shoulder was required to show 
some evidence of tendon pathology, however volunteers 
with full-thickness tears were excluded.
All participants provided details of their age, height and 
weight. Those with shoulder pain recorded the nature 
and duration of their shoulder pain. A Numerical Pain 
Rating Scale (NRS) for average shoulder pain intensity,16 
and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) to 
assess shoulder disability,17 were also completed. The 
NRS was completed again at 24 hours postexercise.
Measurement of the SsT thickness and AHD were 
undertaken according to a previously published reliable 
protocol, with minimal detectable difference (MDD) 
values of 0.7 mm for AHD and 0.6 mm for SsT thick-
ness.18 For the AHD measures, the participant was sitting, 
shoulder neutral, with the hand resting on the lap. An 
ultrasound image was taken with the transducer posi-
tioned along the line of the humerus, over the anterior 
part of the acromion, with the subacromial space and 
humeral head visible. The AHD was then measured as 
the shortest distance between the inferolateral edge of 
the anterior acromion and the humeral head, parallel to 
the acoustic shadow cast by the acromion.18
For the SsT measures, the arm was placed into the 
modified Crass position that is, palm of the hand on the

iliac crest, with the elbow directed posteriorly. The SsT 
was viewed in the transverse plane, the transducer was 
moved anteriorly until the intra-articular portion of the 
long head of biceps was seen, at which point the image 
was taken. On-screen callipers were used to measure 
between the echogenic tendon boundaries, at points 5, 
10 and 15 mm posterior to the edge of the biceps tendon, 
with the mean of these measures used for analysis. 
Subacromial occupation ratio expresses the relationship 
between tendon thickness and the space occupied, calcu-
lated by dividing SsT thickness by the AHD, expressed as 
a percentage. A normal subacromial bursa is either invis-
ible or measures <2 mm on ultrasound.19 In this study, no 
participant had a subacromial bursa thicker than 2 mm at 
baseline or after exercise, therefore no further analysis of 
bursal thickness was carried out.
Measures of AHD and SsT thickness were obtained 
immediately before, and then at three intervals (1, 6 and 
24 hours) postexercise. All images were taken by the same 
examiner, with the participant in the same position. All 
scans were coded to ensure blinding to group allocation 
and time the scan was taken at.
Immediately after the initial ultrasound measure-
ments, participants performed the loading protocol in a 
seated position using an isokinetic dynamometer (System 
3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, New York, USA). The 
shoulder pain group exercised the painful shoulder; the 
control group exercised the shoulder randomly chosen by 
coin toss. Participants undertook a 5 min shoulder warm-
up, involving range of motion exercises. The loading 
protocol involved two bouts of exercise; one of concen-
tric and eccentric shoulder abduction, and a second of 
concentric and eccentric shoulder external rotation; with 
order of completion determined randomly by coin toss. 
The isokinetic protocol was based on that described by 
Roy et al,20 where 60 repetitions at 60°/s resulted in mean 
fatigue levels of 38% for external rotation. For this study, 
we increased the speed to 120°/s in order to increase the 
tendon loading, and set the fatigue level at a 35% drop in 
overall torque for each of the exercise bouts. For external 
rotation, the participant was seated, arm in 45° abduction 
in the neutral plane and ROM was set at minimum arc 
of 45° for external rotation, commencing from a posi-
tion of 20° internal rotation to at least 25° of external 
rotation. Abduction was performed in sitting, with the 
arm in the neutral plane, and ROM from neutral to as 
close to 90° as was tolerable for the participant. Three 
sets of 10 repetitions of each direction were completed 
with 10 s rest between sets. Additional sets were under-
taken if the requisite fatigue level was not reached after 
completion of the prescribed sets, or testing was ceased 
if the required fatigue level was reached before the 
three sets were complete. Testing was also ceased if pain 
beyond usual resting levels was experienced, however all 
participants completed at least two sets of each move-
ment direction. Participants were advised to refrain from 
any further exertion involving their shoulder until the 
24 hours measures were taken.
Data were normally distributed. Significance level was 
set at P=0.05. Repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was used to model the changes in the tendon 
thickness and AHD compared with baseline over the 
subsequent three time points (1, 6 and 24 hours postex-
ercise). A time by group interaction term was used to 
compare the change scores between the pain and control 
groups.
results
A total of 20 healthy controls (mean age 43 years, range 
28–59, 10 men) and 23 people with RC tendinopathy 
(mean age 47 years, range 23–67, 12 men) took part in 
the study. Demographic characteristics of participants 
were not significantly different between groups (table 1). 
Control participants completed slightly more exercise 
sets (mean 5.8) than the shoulder pain group (mean 
4.9).
There was a significant reduction in SsT thickness in 
the control group 6 hours after exercise; however, the 
mean difference was small (0.2 mm, 4%, <MDD). There 
was no significant difference in SsT thickness relative to 
baseline at any other time point in the control group 
(table 2). There was a statistically significant increase in 
SsT thickness between baseline and the 1, 6 and 24 hours 
time points for the pain group; however, only the 6-hour 
difference (0.53 mm, 11%) reached the MDD. A signif-
icant time-by-group interaction term in a repeated 
measures ANOVA analysis indicated that the changes in 
SsT from baseline for the pain group were statistically 
different to the control group (time-by-group interac-
tion: F(3,39) = 9.23, P<0.001).
Twelve participants from the RC tendinopathy group 
had SsT thickness increases that equalled or exceeded

four of these had sustained thickness change at 24 hours. 
While too small for detailed analysis, these four partic-
ipants were observed to have higher NRS pain scores 
at 24 hours postexercise, compared with the rest of the 
group with normalised tendon thickness.
There was a significant reduction in AHD between 
baseline and 1 hour postexercise in the control group, 
with a mean difference equal to the MDD. There was no 
difference in AHD between baseline and either the 6 or 
24 hours measures for controls. There was a significant 
reduction in AHD at both 1 and 6 hours after exercise 
in the pain group, with the 1 hour difference exceeding 
MDD, while there was no difference at 24 hours. Repeated 
measures ANOVA analysis for AHD revealed a significant 
main effects for time (F(2,40)=42, P<0.001) and group 
(F(1,41) = 5.59, P=0.023), but no significant time-by-
group interaction effect (P=0.454), indicating that the 
effects of time were similar in both groups but that the 
change scores from baseline were significantly greater in 
the pain group compared with the control group.
The occupation ratio (SsT as a percentage of AHD) 
increased in both groups over time, with a greater 
increase and slower return to baseline in the RC tendi-
nopathy group as illustrated in figure 1A,B.

This study demonstrated that SsT thickness increased 
in people with painful RC tendinopathy 1 and 6 hours 
following isokinetic concentric and eccentric external 
rotation and abduction exercise, with only the increase 
in SsT thickness at 6 hours exceeding the MDD for this 
measure. Control tendons very slightly reduced in thick-
ness in response to loading, but not beyond the relevant 
MDD. In addition, AHD was reduced in both groups 
1 hour after exercise, with a significant reduction main-
tained only in the pain group at 6 hours. The composite

measure, subacromial occupation ratio, was consequently 
also seen to rise at the 1 hour time point in both groups, 
returning towards baseline more rapidly in the control 
group.
Alterations in tendon fluid are the most commonly 
theorised mechanisms for short-term changes in tendon 
size or shape in vivo, matching those directly measured 
in vitro.21 Increased tendon glycosaminoglycan content 
in tendinopathy, causing more binding of water, may 
provide some explanation for the changes in fluid 
metabolism.22 Studies of the acute response of normal 
tendons to exercise have described a multitude of phys-
iological processes including changes in vascularity,23 
genetic expression24 and mechanical properties.25 Our 
results extend those of a number of studies of lower limb 
tendons, where pathological tendons exhibit an altered 
loading response compared with healthy tendon. People 
with Achilles tendinopathy have been found to have 
an altered response to loading, either in the form of a 
smaller initial reduction in tendon thickness (5% reduc-
tion vs 21% reduction in thickness in controls) and a 
slower return to normal tendon dimensions in response 
to eccentric exercise5 or as an increase in tendon thick-
ness after concentric and eccentric exercise.6
Reductions in AHD have been noted in response 
to fatiguing shoulder exercise,26 27 as reflected in the 
current study. Both superior humeral migration27 and 
alterations in scapular alignment may contribute to this.26 
Chopp et al26 examined the mechanisms of subacromial 
space reduction with fatiguing exercise in 10 healthy 
volunteers. They reported that since the scapular alter-
ations observed in their study (ie, increased posterior 
tilt) functioned to increase the subacromial space, the 
reduction in subacromial space was more likely to be 
due to increased superior humeral head migration, due 
to reduced RC muscle function. Our study is the first to 
examine both the AHD and SsT response to exercise 
simultaneously. It appears that a dynamic process oper-
ates, where fatigue can lead to superior humeral head 
migration, along with swelling of a pathological tendon, 
providing possible evidence for an interaction of intrinsic 
(tendon swelling) and extrinsic (tendon compression) 
mechanisms in painful RC tendinopathy. The subacro-
mial occupation ratio, which incorporates both aspects, 
may help to indicate patients more at risk of compression 
due to a thickened tendon occupying a smaller subacro-
mial space.
Current surgical approaches for RC tendinopathy tend 
to focus on extrinsic causes of tendon impingement, 
directed at altering acromial shape, an approach which 
has come under increasing scrutiny, due to equivalence of 
outcomes with more conservative approaches.13 The lack 
of enhanced effectiveness of acromioplasty suggests that 
the surgery may be targeting the incorrect mechanism 
of injury to the tendon. Restoring homeostasis to the RC 
tendons may be a more relevant treatment approach in 
early painful RC tendinopathy than surgical alteration of 
the coracoacromial arch.
In rehabilitation, while some exercise approaches 
emphasise the role of posture and scapular alignment 
to increase the subacromial space, most also include 
some elements directed towards tendon conditioning 
and pain relief.13 The findings of this study, as well as 
the work of Chopp et al,27 support exercise approaches 
designed to improve load tolerance of the RC tendons, 
as well as providing better control of humeral head 
depression. Ideal conditions for tendon adaptation to 
loading are the provision of adequate time, absence of 
further overloading, in addition to the right metabolic 
and mechanical environment.3 This study suggests that 
fatigue loading of the shoulder may produce unfa-
vourable conditions for adaptation in people with RC 
tendinopathy. Swelling as a response to loading suggests 
altered tendon fluid metabolism, and a reduced subacro-
mial space may increase vulnerability to compression. 
Titrating exercise to the appropriate form and intensity 
is a critical part of restoring normal tendon homeo-
stasis. Clinicians prescribing exercise for people with RC 
tendinopathy may be advised to initially avoid loading 
to fatigue; however, this suggestion requires ongoing 
research enquiry. In addition, based on the recovery rate 
of >6 hours, it may be advisable to limit RC strengthening 
exercise to no more than one session per day, or possibly 
even longer intervals in the early stages of rehabilitation. 
Again, ongoing research is necessary to determine the 
individual’s optimal effective exercise dose.
We included both concentric and eccentric exercise in 
the study protocol as no literature examined the effect 
of exercise type on RC tendon morphology. It is possible 
that different responses may be elicited to each of these 
exercises in isolation; however, many sporting and occu-
pational activities are composite movements, using a 
variety of contraction modes. Electromyographic studies 
by Tardo et al28 and Reed et al,29 suggesting a role for 
supraspinatus in both external rotation and abduction, 
provided the basis for the choice of movement directions 
for this study; however, other shoulder movements may 
provide greater loading or a different response. The pain 
group performed slightly fewer exercise sets than the 
control group. The population studied were recruited 
from community and sports club settings, rather than 
from a clinical environment, with the aim of identifying 
people with less severe pain who could still perform the 
exercise protocol required by the study. It is possible that 
those with more severe shoulder pain might not be able 
to complete the protocol used in this study, or may have 
a different response.
conclusIon
The SsT responded immediately following fatiguing 
concentric and eccentric shoulder exercise, with increased 
and decreased thickness noted in those with and without 
RC tendinopathy, respectively. The AHD reduced in both 
groups, but recovered to baseline more slowly in those 
with shoulder pain. The occurrence of tendon swelling in 
response to fatigue loading potentially supports a theory
