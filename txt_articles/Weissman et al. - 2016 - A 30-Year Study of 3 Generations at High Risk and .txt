IMPORTANCE The increased risk of major depression in the offspring of depressed parents is
well known. Whether the risk is transmitted beyond 2 generations is less well known. To our
knowledge, no published study with direct interviews of family members and the generations
in the age of risk for depression has evaluated beyond 2 generations. This information is
important for detecting individuals at highest risk who may benefit from early intervention.
OBJECTIVE To examine the familial aggregation of psychiatric disorder and functioning in
grandchildren by their biological parents’and grandparents’depression status.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal retrospective cohort family study of 251
grandchildren (generation 3 [mean age, 18 years]) interviewed a mean of 2.0 times and their
biological parents (generation 2) interviewed a mean of 4.6 times and grandparents
(generation 1) interviewed up to 30 years. The study dates were January 1982 (wave 1) to
June 2015 (wave 6).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cumulative rates of psychiatric disorders and functioning
collected for all generations by clinically trained interviewers and best-estimate diagnosis
made blind to diagnoses in members of previous generations.
RESULTS There were 91 families (G1) in the original sample, of whom 77 were eligible for
inclusion (had a grandchild older than 5 years), and 80.5% (62 of 77) participated in the
study. When first examining only 2 generations, the biological children (generation 3) of
depressed compared with nondepressed parents (generation 2) had 2-fold increased risk for
major depressive disorder (MDD) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.08-3.79; P = .03), any
disruptive disorder (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.05-2.75; P = .03), substance dependence (HR, 2.96;
95% CI, 1.24-7.08; P = .01), any suicidal ideation or gesture (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.28-4.66;
P = .007), and poor functioning (F = 38.25, P < .001). When 3 generations were examined
stratified by parental and grandparental depression status, association of a parent’
s MDD on
the grandchild’
s MDD but not other disorders varied with the grandparent’
s depression
status: grandchildren with both a depressed parent and grandparent (n = 38) were at highest
risk for MDD. Among grandchildren without a depressed grandparent, those with (n = 14) vs
without (n = 74) a depressed parent had overall poorer functioning (F = 6.31, P = .01) but not
higher rates of any of the disorders. Potential confounding variables did not have a
meaningful effect on the association between grandchild outcomes and parental or
grandparental depression.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, biological offspring with 2 previous generations
affected with major depression were at highest risk for major depression, suggesting the
potential value of determining family history of depression in children and adolescents
beyond 2 generations. Early intervention in offspring of 2 generations affected with moderate
to severely impairing MDD seems warranted. The specificity of the transmission of
depression across 3 generations may make this group a homogeneous sample for biological
marker studies.

T
he increased risk of psychiatric disorders in the off-
spring of depressed parents is well known.1-7 Whether
this risk is transmitted beyond 2 generations is less well
known. This information is important for detecting individu-
als who may benefit from early intervention and may be can-
didates for biological marker studies. There are no published
studies of depression examining 3 generations with grand-
children in the age of risk for depression and with direct in-
terviews of all family members.4,5,8,9
We have been following up a cohort of depressed and non-
depressed probands and their biological offspring for approxi-
mately30years.Therehavebeen6wavesofinterviewsbyclini-
cally trained interviewers who were unaware of the diagnosis
of previous generations at 0, 2, 10, 20, 25, and 30 years.10 The
offspring themselves have had children. We began assessing
the third generation— the grandchildren—at the 10-year fol-
low-up when they were 6 years and older. At that time, there
were 90 grandchildren, with a mean age of 11 years.11,12 At the
20-year follow-up, there were 161 grandchildren, with a mean
age of 12 years.13,14 A large number were prepubertal and had
notyetenteredtheageofriskformajordepression.Despitetheir
youngage,wefoundhighratesofpsychiatricsymptomsamong
the grandchildren with 2 previous generations affected.
The additional follow-up data presented herein at 30 years
provide information on a larger and older sample of grand-
children. More grandchildren were born or became old enough
to be interviewed for the first time, and more of the grand-
children who had previously been assessed had entered the
age of risk. There are now 251 grandchildren (interviewed a
mean of 2.0 times), and their mean age is 18 years. Based on
previousfindings,wehypothesizedthatthehighestrateofma-
jor depression would be in grandchildren with both a parent
and grandparent with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
In the original study, generation 1 (G1) probands with moder-
atetoseverelyimpairingMDDwereoutpatientsreceivingmedi-
cation for depression. Nondepressed probands were selected
fromanepidemiologicsampleinthesamecommunityandhad
no lifetime history of psychiatric illness, as determined by sev-
eral interviews. The procedures and training remained simi-
lar across the waves to avoid variance in the methods.12-16 For
generation 3 (G3), high risk was defined as having 1 or more
grandparents with MDD, and low risk was defined as having
no grandparents with MDD. Generation 1 were all of Euro-
pean white race/ethnicity to reduce heterogeneity for future
genetic studies, as was the custom when the study began. All
interviews were approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. All adults pro-
vided written informed consent. For minors, the parent
provided written informed consent, and the child provided
verbal assent.
Assessments
The assessments described previously12-16 are summarized
herein. The diagnostic interview across all waves was the
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Lifetime
Version (SADS-L) for adults,17 and the Kiddie-SADS child ver-
sionmodifiedforDSM-IVforindividualsbetween6and17years
old.18,19 The Kiddie-SADS-e18 was used in wave 3, and the Kid-
die-SADS–PL version19 was used subsequently in waves 4
through 6. Final diagnoses were obtained using a best-
estimate procedure (see the eMethods in the Supplement for
moredetails).IndividualswereratedateachwaveontheGlobal
AssessmentScale(GAS)20orthechildversionofthescale(Chil-
dren’
s Global Assessment Scale21) if they were younger than
18 years. The GAS, scored from 0 to 100 points, provides an
overall estimate of current functioning, with higher scores de-
noting better functioning. To ensure similar severity thresh-
olds for MDD in both generation 2 (G2) and G1, we applied an
impairment criterion to G2 MDD diagnoses based on the indi-
vidual’
s mean GAS score across waves, with 70 or below indi-
cating moderate to severe MDD.22 Parents and children com-
pleted the Parental Bonding Instrument,23 which assesses care
and protection or control in parenting behavior. Affection-
less control on the Parental Bonding Instrument is defined as
a combination of overprotection and low care, as determined
bypublishedcutoffscores.Cronbachαwas.85forthecaresub-
scale and .84 for the protection subscale.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in demographic characteristics of grandparents,
parents, and grandchildren by grandparent’
s MDD status were
examined by modeling each characteristic as the dependent
variable in a regression model, with grandparental MDD as the
independent variable. We specified the outcome as binary for
sex and marital status, as ordinal for educational attainment
and employment status, and as continuous for personal in-
come, number of children, number of interviews, and all age
variables. These analyses were performed by applying a gen-
eralized estimating equation (GEE) approach24 by means of a
procedure (GENMOD in SAS, version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc25)
to adjust for potential nonindependence of outcomes for off-
spring from the same family.
To account for unequal follow-up times among grandchil-
dren, cumulative lifetime rates of grandchild diagnoses were
estimated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method.26 Effects of
parentalMDDongrandchilddiagnosesweredeterminedbyex-
amining the association between parental depression and
grandchild diagnoses for families with and without grandpa-
rental MDD by separately fitting modified Cox proportional
Key Points
Question Is depression in an offspring of a depressed parent
transmitted to the next generation?
Finding In a longitudinal retrospective cohort study of 3
generations, the biological offspring with 2 previous generations
affected with major depressive disorder (MDD) were the
highest-risk group, with more than a 3-fold increased risk of MDD.
Meaning Offspring with 2 previous generations affected with
MDD may be targets for early intervention and biomarker
studies.

hazards regression models27 to adjust for intracluster corre-
lation. We used the marginal Cox-type analysis approach by
Lee et al28 to estimate the regression parameters in this Cox
model using a robust sandwich covariance matrix estimate to
account for the intracluster dependence29 to each of the 2
groups as follows: grandchild outcome was considered to be
the dependent variable, and the age and sex of the grand-
childwereincludedaspotentialconfounders.Theanalysiswas
stratified by grandparental MDD status to reflect the original
design of the study. To formally test if the association be-
tweenparentaldepressionandgrandchildoutcomevariedwith
grandparental depression status, we included a term repre-
sentingtheinteractionbetweengrandparentalandparentalde-
pression status, as well as a variable representing the main ef-
fect of grandparental depression status in the models, in
addition to the variables described previously. If the interac-
tion term was not found to be statistically significant, we con-
cluded that the association between G3 and G2 depression sta-
tus did not vary with G1 depression status and fitted similar
models with only main effects of parental and grandparental
MDD status as independent variables. When the G3 outcome
was a continuous variable (eg, the mean GAS score), we used
linear regression analysis in a GEE framework to estimate the
mean differences between groups, while adjusting for intra-
cluster correlation and potential confounding variables.27 The
age and sex of offspring were considered a priori to be con-
founding variables and were retained in every model. These
analyses were performed using the same GEE approach as de-
scribed above to adjust for correlation within families.
Potential confounders of the association between paren-
tal MDD status and grandchild outcomes were handled as fol-
lows. Variables that have previously been shown in the litera-
ture to be risk factors for grandchild diagnoses and were found
to be differently distributed across the 4 parent and grandpar-
ent groups using χ2 tests were entered into the models to de-
terminewhetherthesepotentialconfoundersexplainedtheas-
sociationbetweenparentalMDDandgrandchildoutcomes.The
potential confounder variables reflect other G2 disorders and
G3 family environment when growing up.30-32 If the inclusion
of a potential confounder in a regression model changed the
crude variable measuring association by 10% or more, we con-
sidered it a confounder, and we judged whether G2 MDD was
still an important predictor of the G3 outcome by comparing
its crude, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% CIs.33
Results
Sample
There were 91 families (G1) in the original sample, of whom 77
wereeligibleforinclusion(hadagrandchildolderthan5years),
and 80.5% (62 of 77) participated in the study. Participation
ratesamongfamiliesdidnotvarybyG1depressionstatus.These
62 families had 371 biological grandchildren (G3). Sixteen G3
were too young to be interviewed, 3 died, and 1 was later found
not to be biologically related to the parent (G2), resulting in 351
eligible G3, of whom 71.5% (251 of 351) participated. Their par-
ticipation did not vary by G1 depression status.
Demographics
Onentrytothestudy,G1grandparents(n = 62)hadamean(SD)
age of 48.1 (7.5) years, 59.7% (37 of 62) were female, 79.7% (47
of 59) were married, and the median educational attainment
was a high school diploma (Table 1). None of these character-
istics differed by depression status. Of the G2 parents (n = 127),
59.8% (76 of 127) were female, and the mean (SD) age at first
interview was 20.2 (6.4) years. At the time of last interview,
73.3% (88 of 120) were married, the median educational at-
tainmentwasbeyondhighschool,andmost(68.3%[82of120])
were employed full time. Parents were interviewed on aver-
age 4.6 times, and their mean (SD) age at last interview was
46.3 (8.3) years. The only G2 characteristic that differed by G1
risk group was the number of children: high-risk G2 had fewer
children than low-risk G2 (mean [SD], 2.1 [0.9] vs 2.7 [1.1],
P = .007).
The G3 grandchildren (n = 251) did not differ by G1 risk
group on sex (52.2% [131 of 251] were female), educational at-
tainment (one-third graduated from high school and one-
third completed some college), number of interviews (mean
[SD], 2.0 [1.0]), or age at first interview (mean [SD], 12.6 [5.1]
years) or last interview (mean [SD], 18.2 [7.3] years) (Table 1).
Three grandchildren (G3) in the high-risk group had died.
Diagnosis in Grandchildren (G3)
The original analysis of the parents (G2) by their proband par-
ents (G1) at baseline and 2, 10, 20, and 30 years found in-
creased rates of MDD (approximately 3-fold risk) and other dis-
ordersintheG2offspringofhigh-riskvslow-riskG1parents.12,13
These analyses did not take into account any generations be-
fore G1 (eg, great-grandparents).
In our first analysis, we examined only 2 generations. We
compared the grandchildren (G3) by their parents’(G2) de-
pression status to determine if results in the next generation
were similar to results in the previous generation (Table 2). We
found an increased risk of MDD, any mood disorder, any dis-
ruptivedisorder,anysubstancedependence,anydisorder,and
any suicidal ideation or gesture, with increased impairment
in the offspring, in this case, G3 of depressed vs nonde-
pressed parents (G2). We found no cases of bipolar disorder or
schizophrenia in either group. These results showed that G3
withdepressedparentshad2-foldincreasedriskofMDD,which
is identical to what was seen previously in the G1 to G2
transmission.12,13 When we controlled for G1 high-risk or low-
risk status, the HRs changed little, indicating no main effect
of G1 MDD on any of the G3 outcomes.
Taking into account all 3 generations, Table 3 summa-
rizes the association between parental (G2) MDD and grand-
children’
s (G3) outcomes stratified by grandparents’MDD sta-
tus. Before undertaking this analysis, we evaluated the
distributions of age, sex, and educational attainment in the 4
groups and found no significant differences (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Of note in the 4-group analysis was the inclusion of few de-
pressed G2 parents (n = 6) in the low-risk group, reflecting the
low rate of nonfamilial depression. Among the 88 grandchil-
dreninthelow-riskgroup,ratesofdisordersweregenerallysimi-
larregardlessofparentalMDDstatus.However,low-riskgrand-

disorder (HR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.61-5.51; P < .001), and sub-
stancedependence(HR,3.14;95%CI,1.19-8.27;P = .02),aswell
as more than twice the risk of any suicidal ideation or gesture
(HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-4.79; P = .002) and almost twice the
riskofanyanxietydisorder(HR,1.61;95%CI,1.01-2.56;P = .04).
Whereas grandparental MDD status did not have a main
effect on grandchild outcomes, there was a significant inter-
action effect (grandparental MDD status × parental MDD sta-
tus) on grandchildren’
s risk for MDD (P = .04) and any mood
disorder (P = .001) (Table 3). Therefore, the main effect seen
in Table 2 of G2 MDD on G3 MDD and any mood disorder (HRs,
approximately 2.00) depicts an “averaged” effect of G2 on G3.
Not taking into account G1 status, Table 2 summarizes, as
before, that the offspring of moderate to severely depressed
parents were at high risk for MDD and other disorders. In these
analyses taking G1 status into account, we showed that em-
beddedwithinthepreviousanalysiswasagroupathighestrisk,
specificallyforMDD(ie,thegrandchildrenwith2previousgen-
erations affected). The rates of any mood disorder and MDD
in the grandchildren were largely accounted for by the G3 from
2 generations affected with MDD.
We showed this result formally also. The role of G1 MDD
is such that for high-risk grandchildren the HRs reflecting the
significant effects of G2 MDD on G3 MDD and any mood dis-
order are 2.70 (95% CI, 1.30-5.63) and 2.98 (95% CI, 1.61-5.51),
respectively, whereas there is no significant G2 effect for low-
risk grandchildren, with HRs of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.50-1.59) and
0.75 (95% CI, 0.44-1.30), respectively.
We found no group differences in reported medical prob-
lems, but we found 3 deaths in the grandchildren, all from un-
natural causes, including vehicular accident (at age 11 years),
drug-relateddeath(atage22years),anddeathinaninfantfrom
unknown reason. All of these deaths were in G3 with 2 previ-
ousgenerationsaffectedwithdepression.Therewerenodeaths
from any other cause in the G3.
Potential Confounders
Factors that might explain the differential association be-
tween parental and grandparental depression and grandchild
outcome were examined as potential confounders. The vari-
ables were identified based on results of our group’
s previous
analyses of family risk factors and their effect on the rate of
depression.14,31,32 We included variables that were available for
most grandchildren and that were positive for at least 1 mem-
ber in each of the 4 grandchild groups defined by G1 and G2
MDD status. Table 4 summarizes the differential distribution
oftheseriskfactorsacrossthe4parentandgrandparentgroups.
There was statistically significant variation in the distribu-
tions of the 2 risk factors of G2 substance abuse or depen-
dence and G3 parental separation or divorce. These risk fac-
tors were not all concentrated in the highest-risk group (ie, G3
with a depressed parent and grandparent). For instance, G2
substance abuse or dependence and G2 parental separation or
divorce were somewhat more prevalent among grandchil-
dren (G3) of low-risk compared with high-risk depressed par-
ents (G2). For most of the G3 outcomes, we tested for con-
founding in models collapsed across G1 MDD status because
the effect of G2 MDD on these outcomes was found not to dif-
fer by G1 MDD. However, for the G3 MDD and any mood dis-
order outcomes, we stratified the models by G1 MDD status be-
cause of the significant interaction between G2 MDD and G1
MDD (Table 3).
Some of the significant associations between G2 MDD sta-
tus and the G3 outcome summarized in Table 3 were at least
partially confounded by G2 parental separation or divorce or
G2 substance abuse or dependence. As summarized in eTable

2 in the Supplement, the association between G2 MDD status
and any G3 disruptive disorder (crude HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.05-
2.75) was confounded by G2 parental separation or divorce and
substance abuse or dependence (adjusted HRs, 1.87 [95% CI,
1.08-3.23] and 1.56 [95% CI, 0.96-2.56], respectively), and the
association between G2 MDD status and G3 substance depen-
dence (crude HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.24-7.08) was confounded by
G2 parental separation or divorce and substance abuse or de-
pendence (adjusted HRs, 2.56 [95% CI, 0.81-8.08] and 2.58
[95% CI, 1.13-5.58], respectively). In addition, among high-
risk G3 only, the association between G2 MDD status and G3
any mood disorder (crude HR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.61-5.51) was con-
founded by G2 parental separation or divorce (adjusted HR,
2.01; 95% CI, 0.99-4.07). Overall, adjusting for parental sepa-
ration or divorce and substance abuse or dependence in the
models that warranted adjustment did not substantially di-
minish the effect of parental MDD on grandchild outcomes.
Discussion
The additional 10 years of follow-up with a larger and older
sample of grandchildren again showed that the highest-risk
grandchildren with 2 generations affected with MDD had high
rates of a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, the speci-
ficity of transmission of MDD between generations becomes
clearer. Only the association between parental and grandchild
depression is moderated by grandparent major depression.
When examining only 2 generations—the G3 offspring of their
G2parents—wereplicatedpreviousfindingsbyusandothers2-7
of an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, mainly any mood
disorder, substance abuse or dependence, any suicidal ide-
ation or gesture, and poorer functioning in the grandchildren
(G3) of their depressed parents (G2). However, in our original
analysis, we did not take into account the clinical status of the
parents of G1, who would have been the grandparents of G2.
We and others, to our knowledge, had not collected informa-
tion beyond 2 generations when the study began.
With the use of data from all 3 generations, it became
clear that embedded within the high-risk sample was a group
of children at extremely high risk for MDD, namely, the grand-
children with 2 previous generations affected with MDD. This
finding suggests the value of screening for MDD beyond 2
generations.
The 3 deaths from unnatural causes, along with the in-
crease in any suicidal ideation or gesture in the highest-risk
grandchildren, should be noted. In a full cohort of G2, which
included individuals who did not have children, our group

previously found an increase in deaths from unnatural causes
inthehigh-riskoffspring(G2)andameanlossof8yearsoflife.16
Is this increase in any suicidal ideation or gesture in grandchil-
dren with 2 generations affected a harbinger of future risk?
There are no published 3-generation studies of major de-
pression for comparisons that include direct interviews of all
3 generations or samples of grandchildren in the age of risk.8,9
The study by Hammen et al4 of a large sample of 15-year-olds
with grandmothers’information obtained from mothers is the
most comparable. That study focused on interpersonal stress
as a mediator and found that the main effect of G1 MDD on G3
MDD was mediated by G2 MDD and interpersonal stress. The
authors concluded that maternal and grandmother MDD are
risk factors for G3 MDD, noting that their effects operate
through a mechanism of long-term maternal interpersonal
stress, marital and family discord, and parenting that is per-
ceived by the child to be negative. Our sample may not have
been large enough to show this effect. However, we found ad-
verse risks across all groups.
Our study has some limitations. The sample was still too
small to test for sex effects or multiple risk factors, and the
number of grandchildren with a depressed parent but no de-
pressed grandparents was low. Ethnic diversity entered into
the second generation but was too small to test the effect. The
original probands were selected from an ambulatory depres-
sion clinic (Yale Depression Research Unit, New Haven, Con-
necticut) and may not be generalizable to community samples.
Some grandchildren had not yet passed through the full pe-
riod of age of risk for major depression and other disorders.
We also do not know what the long-term effects will be for the
group who have both a parent and grandparent with major de-
pression. Grandparents were excluded from the original study
if they had a history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or pri-
mary substance abuse, which may account for the low rates
of these disorders in G2 offspring. All of the original G1 pro-
bands had onset of MDD before age 40 years and usually be-
fore age 30 years. We do not know if the effect on grandchil-
dren of 2 generations affected with MDD would be the same if
the onset of MDD was later. First onset of MDD after age 50
years is uncommon and may not have the same effect on trans-
mission between the generations.
Conclusions
These findings show the potential value of extending family
history of depression beyond 2 generations. There is now con-
siderable data showing the positive effects on children of suc-
cessful treatment of a depressed parent.34-38 The specificity of
the transmission of depression across 3 generations suggests
that this group might be a homogeneous sample for future bio-
logical marker studies.
