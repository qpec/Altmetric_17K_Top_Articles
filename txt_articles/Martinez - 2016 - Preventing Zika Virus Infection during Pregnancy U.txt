Abstract
It has come to light that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can result in trans-pla-
cental transmission to the fetus along with fetal death, congenital microcephaly, and/or Cen-
tral Nervous System (CNS) malformations. There are projected to be >9,200,000 births
annually in countries with ongoing ZIKV transmission. In response to the ZIKV threat, the
World Health Organization (WHO) is strategically targeting prevention of infection in preg-
nant women and funding contraception in epidemic regions. I propose that the damaging
effects of ZIKV can be reduced using a seasonal window of opportunity for conception that
may minimize maternal exposure. Like other acute viral infections—including the related fla-
vivirus, dengue virus (DENV)—the transmission of ZIKV is anticipated to be seasonal. By
seasonally planning pregnancy, this aspect of pathogen ecology can be leveraged to align
sensitive periods of gestation with the low-transmission season.
Author Summary
Scientific consensus has now been reached that intrauterine Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can
result in infection of the fetus and subsequent fetal death, congenital microcephaly, and/or
Central Nervous System (CNS) malformations. Preliminary data suggest miscarriage and
congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) are most likely when maternal infection occurs early in
pregnancy, but fetal abnormalities have been found in women infected with ZIKV during all
three trimesters, indicating all trimesters are vulnerable. Like related flavivirus infections,
ZIKV transmission is likely to be seasonal. I propose that the risk of ZIKV infection to preg-
nant women can be reduced using a window of opportunity for conception that will align
sensitive periods of gestation with the low-transmission season for ZIKV.
Zika Virus and Microcephaly
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus—vectored by Aedes aegypti—spreading
rapidly across the globe [1]. Pregnant women infected with ZIKV risk severe fetal outcomes,

 including brain abnormalities—believed to be due to disruption of brain development caused
by intrauterine infection—and death [2,3]. ZIKV was the suspected cause of the 2015/2016 out-
break of microcephaly in Brazil [4], and scientific consensus has now been reached that prena-
tal ZIKV infection causes microcephaly and other forms of brain abnormalities. Upon
maternal infection, however, the risk of such fetal outcomes remains unknown [5]. In April
2016, the causal link between ZIKV and microcephaly was inferred via several independent
lines of evidence, including (1) microcephaly and brain abnormalities in infants born to moth-
ers with suspected or confirmed ZIKV infection during the first or second trimester of preg-
nancy, (2) the rare form of microcephaly in infants with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS),
distinguishing it from microcephaly resulting from other causes, and (3) birth defects occur-
ring in women with travel-acquired ZIKV, coupled with the low probability that these events
were coincident and not causal [5]. Several reports from February to May 2016 have now pro-
vided strong evidence for the causal link. A retrospective study of the 2013/2014 ZIKV out-
break in French Polynesia found a 14-fold increase in severe microcephaly in newborns and
fetuses following the epidemic; amniotic fluid tested positive for ZIKV in 4 of 7 women sam-
pled after identification of fetal abnormalities [6]. In addition, in Brazil, 42 ZIKV-positive preg-
nant women were tested for fetal abnormalities. Adverse findings—including fetal death,
microcephaly, and central nervous system (CNS) damage—were observed in 12 of the women.
There were no abnormalities in ZIKV-negative women [2]. Lastly, the complete ZIKV genome
was recovered from the brain of a fetus with microcephaly aborted by an expectant mother
infected during the 13th week of gestation [7], and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
reported on two newborns from Brazil with microcephaly who died shortly after birth, as well
as two miscarriages; all tested positive for ZIKV [8]. In addition to the epidemiological evi-
dence, newly developed mouse models of ZIKV have demonstrated that ZIKV strains from
French Polynesia and Brazil can infect the fetus via the placenta and cause intrauterine growth
restrictions and/or fetal loss [9,10]. Culture models of early brain development have also
shown ZIKV can cause neural cell death [10,11].
Recognizing the incomplete picture of ZIKV in utero pathology, in February 2016, the
WHO declared the cluster of microcephaly in Brazil to be a Public Health Emergency of Inter-
national Concern, and the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee issued rec-
ommendations to reduce ZIKV infections in pregnant women [4]. In the United States, $1.9
billion has been requested of congress to respond to ZIKV domestically and internationally
[12]. Maternally transmitted viral infections, such as ZIKV, can be prevented by protecting
pregnant women from infection, but it is likely to be many years before a ZIKV vaccine or
treatment is developed. Alternative preventative measures are therefore needed to protect
women and their children from this emerging pathogen.
Two key components of the ZIKV response by governments and health agencies are (1) vec-
tor control and (2) preventing infection in pregnant women. The WHO’s ZIKV operational
response plan includes control of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and financing contraceptive ser-
vices in affected areas to manage pregnancy and mitigate the impact of ZIKV [4]. At the CDC’s
April 2016 Zika Action Plan Summit, the CDC Director acknowledged “the control of Aedes
aegypti is challenging” and declared that decreasing the risk of ZIKV to pregnant women and
women of childbearing age is a key priority [13].
Government officials in El Salvador, Colombia, and Ecuador have recommended women
delay pregnancy while uncertainty surrounding ZIKV remains. The WHO ZIKV Q&A website
(updated regularly) states, “Women wanting to postpone pregnancy should have access to a
comprehensive range of reversible, long- or short-acting contraceptive options to the full extent
of the law” [14]. The CDC has issued recommendations for ZIKV-exposed couples to delay
pregnancy. Exposed women and exposed asymptomatic men are recommended to wait 8

 weeks, and men with symptoms are recommended to wait 6 months [15]. No official stance on
delaying pregnancy has been taken for unexposed women. Problematically, the public is receiv-
ing a mixed message highlighted by media coverage [16–18]. Given that extended delays of
pregnancy may not be a viable option for millions of women living in ZIKV-epidemic regions,
I propose a strategy that will reduce intrauterine ZIKV infection risk without requiring long-
term delays of pregnancy. Specifically, I recommend that public health and research communi-
ties focus on three current ZIKV knowledge gaps:
1. seasonality of ZIKV transmission,
2. intrauterine transmission and pathology, and
3. immunity.
These aspects of ZIKV biology can be integrated with incidence data and mathematical
models to inform interventions, including reducing transmission (i.e., vector-to-human and
sexual) via vector control and behavioral changes, planning pregnancy to avoid the high-trans-
mission season, launching vaccines once developed, and reducing intrauterine transmission
and pathology. Knowledge gap 3 (immunity) will be particularly important for understanding
the recurrent epidemic dynamics of ZIKV and CZS. If ZIKV antibodies either wane or do not
fully protect from infection, then we could expect women of childbearing age to be susceptible
to ZIKV after their primary infection (which might occur during the first epidemic wave).
Transmission Seasonality
Seasonality is a common feature of acute infectious diseases [19–24], including flaviviruses like
dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and other arbovi-
ruses vectored by Aedes aegypti (i.e., chikungunya virus [CHIKV]) [25–29]. Although infec-
tious diseases are seasonal, the timing of the high-transmission season can (1) vary among
pathogens within a country and (2) vary among countries/regions for a given pathogen [30].
The drivers of DENV, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV seasonality are likely some combination of
vector phenology, climate conditions, and additional host or environmental factors. In general,
climatic, physiological, and behavioral factors that influence transmission seasonality include
those that impact host and/or vector susceptibility to infection, host/vector infectiousness,
virus viability, the transmission-relevant contact rate among hosts/vectors, the density of hosts,
and vector abundance [19,24,30].
Aedes aegypti has seasonal variation in its ability to facilitate flavivirus transmission because
its abundance and competence as a vector are affected by temperature and rainfall [31,32].
Using data from Puerto Rico—one of the US locations with ongoing ZIKV transmission—Fig
1A demonstrates the seasonal abundance of blood-fed female Aedes aegypti, which transmit
ZIKV. Aedes aegypti seasonality affects seasonal transmission of DENV and CHIKV [31,33]
and it is likely to impact seasonal ZIKV transmission. In regions with strong seasonal fluctua-
tions in Aedes aegypti, seasonal changes in abundance and vector competence should be char-
acterized and used to estimate the local timing of the high-transmission season.
A key reason for characterizing transmission seasonality and pinpointing the high transmis-
sion season is because its timing will affect the risk of microcephaly in birth cohorts. This is
because births are seasonal across human populations, and there is a distinct birth pulse in
most countries/regions that varies geographically in its seasonal timing [34,35]. Fig 1B shows
the birth seasonality in Puerto Rico, with the birth peak from August–October. Due to birth
seasonality, the percent of pregnancies experiencing a specific trimester is not evenly distrib-
uted throughout the year (Fig 1D). For any given country, the timing of the seasonal birth

 pulse relative to the ZIKV transmission season will therefore determine the fraction of preg-
nancies at risk for maternal infection and congenital ZIKV. For example, if a country has a
birth pulse in which sensitive gestational periods coincide with the ZIKV season, more preg-
nancies in that country will be at risk than elsewhere. Fortunately, if access to contraceptives
and family planning practices are proactively targeted for intervention, then the birth pulse
could be intentionally shifted and amplified regionally to minimize the risk of intrauterine
ZIKV infection for entire birth cohorts.
Seasonally Timing Pregnancy
At this time, there are insufficient data to predict the seasonal timing and frequency (i.e.,
annual, biennial, triennial, etc.) at which ZIKV epidemics will occur. The ZIKV outbreak in
Brazil peaked between July 12–18, 2015 [39], which is out-of-phase with DENV epidemics in
Brazil, which consistently peak around March [40]. This suggests the seasonal timing of DENV
epidemics might not be useful in predicting the timing of ZIKV. Importantly, however, the
first epidemic wave of ZIKV may not reflect ZIKV’s future recurrent epidemic timing. The first
wave of the epidemic may differ from future recurrent epidemics because (1) clinical recogni-
tion and reporting of cases may lag far behind pathogen introduction, (2) the first wave occurs
in a fully susceptible population, which will alter the epidemic growth curve and the time until
susceptible depletion, and (3) the timing of epidemic onset will be influenced by pathogen
introduction as opposed to recurrent epidemics in locations with unbroken transmission
chains, the onset of which is influenced by the build-up of the susceptible population and sea-
sonal transmission [20].
As ZIKV incidence data become available, the annual transmission “high-season” and “low-
season” should be characterized so pregnancy may be planned such that sensitive periods of
gestation are aligned with the low-season window of opportunity. After the initial wave of the
epidemic, ZIKV transmission models can be fitted and transmission parameters estimated
using time series data from ZIKV surveillance. Fig 2 provides a potential ZIKV Susceptible-
Infected-Recovered transmission model developed with a focus on the demography relevant to
congenital ZIKV. To estimate seasonal transmission parameters, this model would require
extensive time series data on reported ZIKV cases either weekly or monthly. To overcome data
limitations, data from other ZIKV surveillance systems could be used in parallel to parameter-
ize such a model. Surveillance data that could be used to study ZIKV transmission and pathol-
ogy include reported cases, registries of miscarriage and CZS, ZIKV serology data, and
mosquito surveillance data. Models with similar levels of complexity in transmission, pathol-
ogy, and demography have been parameterized for poliovirus and measles [35,41]; see [42] for
statistical inference methods. By combining transmission models with reported ZIKV cases,
data on vector abundance, and other covariates that could influence transmission (e.g., temper-
ature, humidity, and human movement), the underlying mechanistic drivers of ZIKV trans-
mission seasonality could be revealed (knowledge gap 1). Assuming vector abundance is an
important driver of ZIKV seasonal transmission, based on the Aedes aegypti data from Puerto
Rico, the high-transmission season in Puerto Rico would occur between October–December
and the trough would be April–June (Fig 1A). The impact of vector abundance on flavivirus
transmission is indicated by the 2013 DENV epidemic in Puerto Rico, which had a trough in
April (Fig 1C), as would be predicted based on vector seasonality. Importantly, the high and
low transmission seasons are tied to local climate conditions and will therefore be region-
specific.
With knowledge of regional transmission seasonality, initiating pregnancy during the sea-
sonal window of opportunity for conception would minimize risk of maternal infection and

 subsequent damage to the fetus. Birth defects resulting from in utero infection with CMV, her-
pes simplex, and rubella virus are reported to be highest when maternal infection occurs within
the first 20 weeks of gestation [43–45]. Miscarriages of known ZIKV-positive fetuses have been
reported at 11 and 13 weeks gestation [8]. Preliminary data suggest miscarriage and CZS are
most likely when maternal infection occurs during the first or second trimester [5,6,46,47], but
fetal abnormalities have been found in women infected with ZIKV during weeks 8–35 of
Fig 2. ZIKV transmission and pathology model schematic. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of ZIKV transmission. (a) Transmission model.
Births enter the population seasonally, as illustrated by Fig 1B. Susceptible individuals are categorized as infants and children (“susceptible children”),
adult males and women past reproductive age (“other susceptible individuals”), women of childbearing age, and pregnant women. There are three
infected classes. The general infected class (“other infected individuals”) includes infants, children, adult males, and non-pregnant women. The infected
class relevant to congenital ZIKV tracks pregnant women, who can transmit trans-placentally to infect their fetus. The recovered class (“immune”)
contains individuals who have recovered from infection and are immune from infection, but it is unknown how long immunity lasts and the nature of
repeat infection, indicated by knowledge gap 3. The transmission process is unobserved because transmission events are not captured in surveillance.
Interventions are indicated. (b) Surveillance model. Symptomatic ZIKV infections and past infections are observable through surveillance systems. The
model assumes a subset of infected individuals will have symptoms and the infection of a fetus can result in miscarriage, congenital Zika syndrome
(CZS), or other forms of disease, the risk of which remains unknown (knowledge gap 2). Immunity in the host population can be observed through
serology surveys, and mosquito abundance (“susceptible vectors” and “infected vectors”) can be measured based on vector surveillance. Vector
abundance is seasonal as illustrated by Fig 1A and this likely affects seasonal transmission, indicated by knowledge gap 1.

 gestation [2], indicating all three trimesters are vulnerable to some extent. The critical window
of susceptibility for ZIKV-induced miscarriage and CZS needs to be identified and taken into
account when determining the seasonal window of opportunity for conception. Identifying the
period of susceptibility for the fetus and using planned seasonal conception to redistribute
births—i.e., to take advantage of the transmission low season and ensure sensitive gestation
occurs during the ZIKV low season—would reduce risk to the fetus by minimizing maternal
exposure. Based on the size of the 2014 birth cohort in Puerto Rico, redistributing births even
by a small amount, for example with as little as 3% fewer births experiencing a susceptible tri-
mester during the high transmission season, would translate to reducing risk for approximately
1,000 births annually. In a large country like Brazil, which had a birth cohort of approximately
3 million in 2015 [48], planned seasonal conception for 3% of births could reduce risk in
>88,000 pregnancies. The absolute reduction in risk, however, is unknown, as it will depend
on the incidence of ZIKV infection in the population and the subsequent risk of trans-placental
transmission and fetal abnormalities.
Fig 3A shows the window of opportunity for conception when the high transmission season
lasts 13 weeks and the fetus is susceptible during various periods of gestation. The window of
opportunity depends on three key factors: (1) the timing of the transmission trough (i.e., the
week(s) or month of the year when transmission is at a minimum), (2) the susceptible period
of gestation, and (3) whether the severity of congenital ZIKV infection varies during the sus-
ceptible period of gestation. For example, it may be that the first two trimesters are susceptible
to fetal abnormalities, but the first trimester is the most vulnerable. Knowing the distribution
of susceptibility throughout the gestational weeks would impact the timing of planned concep-
tion. Assuming the period of susceptibility spans gestation weeks 1–20, with the first trimester
being highly susceptible and therefore given high priority for protection, Fig 3B and 3C show
how the seasonal distribution of conception could be shifted and amplified to reduce ZIKV
risk in Puerto Rico. In general, although tailoring conception seasonally will not alleviate risk
of maternal exposure to ZIKV, it could reduce risk and provide an option for women as they
wait for a ZIKV vaccine and/or clinical interventions. Planned seasonal conception would be
an effective low-cost means of empowering women to protect themselves and their children.
The feasibility and implementation of this strategy would require collaboration among vec-
tor ecologists, epidemiologists, and social scientists. In order to seasonally time pregnancy,
1. each country will need to identify their region-specific high and low ZIKV transmission
season,
2. women and health care providers will need to be educated about seasonal conception, and
3. women will need access to contraception.
A key unknown is the susceptible period of gestation; when this period is determined, then
seasonally planning pregnancy could be integrated into the growing portfolio of ZIKV inter-
ventions. The feasibility and acceptability of planning conception seasonally will need to be
addressed regionally with careful consideration of women’s reproductive rights and personal
values. An R-package including data used in this manuscript and a conception planning calen-
dar is provided in S4 Data. The conception planner requires user-defined (1) timing of the
transmission trough, (2) susceptible weeks of gestation, and (3) a statement of whether the first
trimester is particularly vulnerable. To increase the effectiveness of seasonally planning con-
ception, vector control campaigns could be used to restrict the mosquito season, minimize the
duration of the high-transmission season, and expand the window of opportunity for “safe ges-
tation.” The integration of epidemiology and family planning can be an effective tool for sea-
sonally timing conception to reduce women’s risk of ZIKV infection during pregnancy.

Fig 3. Planning pregnancy to take advantage of the low ZIKV transmission season. (a) Window of opportunity for conception based on the region-
specific transmission season and the susceptible period of gestation. The high-transmission season is marked in blue, and the transmission trough is
indicated by the dashed line. The ZIKV-susceptible gestation period is unknown, but preliminary data suggest that all three trimesters are susceptible;
however, the first two trimesters are particularly vulnerable. The six scenarios depict the window of opportunity for conception under different susceptible
gestation periods. Scenario 1 is susceptibility during gestation weeks 1–20, similar to other congenital infections. Scenario 2 is susceptibility during
weeks 1–26, i.e., the first and second trimester. Scenario 3 is susceptibility during weeks 1–40, all three trimesters. The A and B variants of each
scenario indicate whether there is uniform susceptibility across the susceptible gestation period or if the first trimester is particularly vulnerable. Policy
could encourage planned conception such that the susceptible gestation period is aligned with the transmission trough. This policy would minimize the
risk of maternal exposure when the fetus is most vulnerable. The window of opportunity for conception varies depending on when (in the calendar year)
the high-transmission season occurs. (b) Theoretical trajectory of conception in Puerto Rico if conception were seasonally planned. The percent
indicates the monthly value based on pregnancies initiated that year. The transmission trough was assumed to be in April (based on the data in Fig 1A
and 1C). Gestation weeks 1–20 were assumed to be susceptible, with the first trimester being particularly vulnerable and given highest priority for
protection. Conception was therefore encouraged in March, which had the effect of shifting and amplifying the birth pulse. The projection assumes that,
each year, planned conception results in 3% of annual births that would have occurred in Jan., May., Jun., Jul., Aug., Sep., Oct., Nov., or Dec. being
redistributed to Feb (0.5%), Mar (2%), and Apr (0.5%). (c) The seasonal distribution of pregnancies in the first trimester based on the conception
