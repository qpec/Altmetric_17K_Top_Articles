IMPORTANCE A critical decision in the management of metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) is when to administer an androgen receptor signaling (ARS)
inhibitor or a taxane.
OBJECTIVE To determine if pretherapy nuclear androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)
protein expression and localization on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a treatment-specific
marker for response and outcomes between ARS inhibitors and taxanes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this cross-sectional cohort study at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 265 men with progressive mCRPC undergoing a change in
treatment were considered; 86 were excluded because they were not initiating ARS or taxane
therapy; and 18 were excluded for processing time constraints, leaving 161 patients for
analysis. Between December 2012 and March 2015, blood was collected and processed from
patients with progressive mCRPC immediately prior to new line of systemic therapy. Patients
were followed up to 3 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time receiving
therapy, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS Overall, of 193 prospectively collected blood samples from 161 men with mCRPC,
191 were evaluable (128 pre-ARS inhibitor and 63 pretaxane). AR-V7–positive CTCs were
found in 34 samples (18%), including 3% of first-line, 18% of second-line, and 31% of third- or
greater line samples. Patients whose samples had AR-V7–positive CTCs before ARS inhibition
had resistant posttherapy PSA changes (PTPC), shorter rPFS, shorter time on therapy, and
shorter OS than those without AR-V7–positive CTCs. Overall, resistant PTPC were seen in
65 of 112 samples (58%) without detectable AR-V7–positive CTCs prior to ARS inhibition.
There were statistically significant differences in OS but not in PTPC, time on therapy, or rPFS
for patients with or without pretherapy AR-V7–positive CTCs treated with a taxane. A
multivariable model adjusting for baseline factors associated with survival showed superior
OS with taxanes relative to ARS inhibitors when AR-V7–positive CTCs were detected
pretherapy (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .035).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results validate CTC nuclear expression of AR-V7 protein
in men with mCRPC as a treatment-specific biomarker that is associated with superior
survival on taxane therapy over ARS-directed therapy in a clinical practice setting. Continued
examination of this biomarker in prospective studies will further aid clinical utility.

P
atients with progressive, metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are often classified
on the basis of prior chemotherapy exposure, consid-
ered by many to provide modest clinical benefit relative to the
overallburdenoftreatment.Consequently,manypatientswho
might benefit from chemotherapy never receive it, while oth-
ers are only offered chemotherapy as a last resort when toler-
ance and overall response rates are poor.1 Multiple approved
therapeutic options with diverse mechanisms of action proven
to prolong life are currently available—at issue is how best to
use them to maximize benefit for individual patients, deci-
sionsthatareoftenempiricallyratherthanscientificallybased.
Simply reviewing the data from registration trials can be mis-
leading because the eligibility criteria are optimized for suc-
cess and by the fact that patients treated on clinical protocols
often experience outcomes superior to those treated in a clini-
cal setting.2 Further, although line of therapy and sequence
of administration do matter, patterns of cross-sensitivity and
drug resistance are not predictable from patient to patient.3
This dilemma led the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3)
to reclassify the clinical states of mCRPC based on the order
individual treatments are administered, regardless of type.4
Validated predictive biomarkers are needed to guide thera-
peutic decisions.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a potential source of tu-
mor for profiling that can be serially obtained with minimal
patient discomfort. Studies using a range of platforms in mul-
tiple tumor types have shown that prognosis is worse in pa-
tients with detectable CTCs vs those without.5 Serial biologic
characterization of CTCs can provide insights into drivers of
tumor growth in patients, allowing the pharmacodynamic ef-
fects of targeted therapies to be assessed, potentially en-
abling the prediction of sensitivity to a specific treatment as
the disease evolves over time.5 The promise offered by these
analyses in research contrasts sharply with their use in prac-
tice. Needed in both cases, however, are validated assays for
predictive biomarkers to inform the selection of a specific
therapy for a specific patient at a specific point in time.6,7
Prostate cancer is an androgen-dependent disease. Even
tumors that are resistant to castration remain androgen re-
ceptor (AR) dependent. Androgen receptor splice variants
lack the C-terminal ligand-binding domain but retain the
N-terminal transcriptional elements that can activate AR sig-
naling (ARS) independent of ligand.8,9 In a recent report,
detection of the androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript in pooled epithelial cell ad-
hesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive CTCs of men with progres-
sive mCRPC was associated with resistance to the ARS inhibi-
tors abiraterone and enzalutamide.10 The same group later
demonstrated that the presence of AR-V7 mRNA in CTCs did
not predict response to taxanes.11 This finding was validated
by an independent group using a similar assay that found no
association between the presence of AR-V7 transcripts and re-
sponsetocabazitaxel.12Takentogether,theresultssuggestthat
AR-V7 could represent a biomarker to guide treatment selec-
tion in mCRPC.13,14
Herein, we report on the analytical and clinical valida-
tion of an AR-V7 protein immunofluorescent assay run on the
Epic Sciences non-EpCAM-based CTC detection platform.15,16
The context of use is the clinical decision point at which a
change in systemic therapy is needed. The focus was the as-
sociation between the pretherapy detection of AR-V7–
positive CTCs with line of therapy and objective clinical out-
comes following treatment with the most frequently used,
approved drug classes for management of mCRPC: ARS inhibi-
tors and taxanes.
Methods
Patient Selection
Between December 2012 and March 2015, 265 patients with
histologically confirmed mCRPC undergoing a change in sys-
temic therapy for progressive disease were treated at Memo-
rial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Of these, 104 were
excluded because they were not starting therapy with abi-
raterone acetate, enzalutamide, ARN-509, docetaxel, cabazi-
taxel, or paclitaxel, or owing to constraints on processing time,
leaving 191 evaluable samples from 161 unique patients for
analysis (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
All patients underwent a history evaluation that in-
cluded stage at diagnosis, initial management and all subse-
quent systemic therapies, a physical examination, and labo-
ratory studies including complete blood cell count, chemistry
panel (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydroge-
nases, and creatinine), and serum testosterone to confirm cas-
tration status (<50 ng/dL [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by
0.0347]). Documentation of disease progression required a
minimum of 2 rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 1 or
more weeks apart, new lesions by bone scintigraphy, and/or
new or enlarging soft tissue lesions by computed tomogra-
phy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), per the Pros-
tate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2)
guidelines.17 All patients signed consent forms based on an in-
stitutionalreviewboard–approvedprotocol,andbloodsamples
Key Points
Question Can the measurement of the nuclear androgen-
receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) be a treatment-specific biomarker in metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at therapeutic
decision points in the first-line, second-line, or third or greater
line setting?
Findings In this cross-sectional cohort study, mCRPC patients
with pre-androgen receptor signaling (ARS) inhibitor
AR-V7–positive CTCs had resistant prostate-specific antigen
responses, shorter time on therapy, shorter radiographic
progression-free survival, and inferior overall survival. In a
multivariable model incorporating line of therapy and other clinical
features, AR-V7 status showed significant treatment-specific
interaction with taxane administration.
Meaning Pretherapy CTC nuclear expression of AR-V7 protein
in men with mCRPC is a treatment-specific biomarker predicting
superior overall survival for taxane therapy over ARS inhibitors in
a clinical practice setting, warranting prospective validation.

were obtained prior to initiation of either an ARS inhibitor or
taxane-based therapy. The choice of therapy was at the dis-
cretion of the treating physician. The treatment characteris-
tics are summarized in the Table.
Posttreatment Outcomes
For each treatment course, antitumor effects were assessed by
the posttherapy PSA changes (PTPC). For ARS inhibitors, “sen-
sitive” was defined as a 50% or greater decline from baseline
at 12 weeks, but for taxane treatment, 12 weeks or more was
used because the maximal decline may occur later.18 For both
therapies, “resistant” was defined as the failure to achieve a
50% or greater decline. Radiographic progression-free sur-
vival (rPFS), time receiving therapy, and overall survival (OS)
werealsoreported.Timereceivingtherapywascalculatedfrom
initiation of therapy until date of drug discontinuation for any
reason. Radiographic progression was determined by inde-
pendent blinded review of available radionuclide bone scans,
CTs, or MRIs, using the PCWG2 criteria,17 and calculated from
therapy initiation until radiologically confirmed progression
or death owing to any cause within 60 days of stopping treat-
ment. Patients without evidence of radiologic progression at
the time of last stable scan or end of therapy, whichever oc-
curred later, were right censored. Overall survival was calcu-
lated from initiation of therapy to death from any cause. Pa-
tients still alive at time of last follow-up were right-censored.
CTC Collection
Blood (7.5 mL) from each participant was collected in Streck
tubes and processed at MSKCC or shipped to Epic Sciences and
processed within 48 hours. Red blood cells were lysed, and ap-
proximately 3 million nucleated blood cells were dispensed

onto 10-16 glass microscope slides (25.3 mm × 75.3 mm) and
placed at −80°C for long-term storage as previously
described.15,16,19 Sample processing and testing were con-
ducted in laboratories following Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
Analytical Validation: Specificity of AR-V7 Detection
As per common practice for verifying the accuracy of diagnos-
tic-grade antibodies, the AR-V7 antibody was comprehen-
sively tested via tissue microarrays containing malignant, tu-
mor-adjacent, and healthy tissue samples (eFigure 2F in the
Supplement). An independent pathologist scored the samples
for background staining and cross-reactivity. AR-V7–positive
and AR-V7–negative mCRPC patient tissue were screened and
included as part of the tissue microarray panel as positive and
negative controls, respectively.
CTC Immunofluorescent Staining and Analysis
Slides created from healthy donor blood samples spiked
with prostate cancer cell line cells (controls), or from mCRPC
patient samples, underwent automated immunofluorescent
staining for DNA, cytokeratins (CK), CD45 (lymphocyte com-
mon antigen), and AR-V7 (Figure 1), as previously
described.15,16 A rabbit monoclonal anti-AR-V7 antibody
(EPR15656; Abcam) was used for all AR-V7 applications
herein described. Separate slides from patient samples were
tested with a second automated immunofluorescent assay,
staining for DNA, CK, CD45, and the AR N-terminal domain.
Up to 2 slides were evaluated per blood sample per assay.
Fluorescent scanners and morphology algorithms were used
to identify CTCs, CTC clusters, apoptotic CK-positive cells,
and CK-negative CTCs. A more thorough description of CTC
types has been published previously.16 Clinical laboratory
scientists (licensed in California) conducted final quality
control of CTC subpopulation classification and subcellular
biomarker localization.
AR-V7 and AR N-terminal positivity were defined by pro-
tein expression level above a threshold intensity (eFigure 2 in
theSupplement).Theexpressionthresholdwasdefinedbysig-
nal quantitation above background relative to AR-V7–
negative or AR N-terminal-negative control cell lines, as ap-
propriate. Nuclear localization was also required to classify

cludes protein localization analysis.
The specificity of AR-V7 protein detection in single pros-
tate cancer cell line cells spiked into whole blood was corrobo-
ratedbysingle-cellmRNAanalyses(eFigure2A-DintheSupple-
ment). The requirement for AR-V7 protein signal localization
in the nucleus is consistent with AR-V7–mediated ligand-
independent proliferation in preclinical models,20,21 AR-V7 lo-
calization in human solid tumor tissue,10,22,23 and previously
validated AR-V7 prognostic tissue scoring criteria.23 Sample-
level specificity of AR-V7–positive staining in CTCs was estab-
lished by staining up to 2 additional slides per sample with a
separate AR N-terminal immunofluorescent assay. Samples
with at least 1 AR-V7–positive or AR N-terminal–positive CTC
were considered positive for the respective biomarker
(Figure 2).
Statistical Analyses
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at the time
of blood draw were evaluated by descriptive statistics: over-
all, by line of therapy, and by drug administered. Fisher exact
and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare treat-
ment groups for categorical and continuous characteristics,
respectively.
The association of AR-V7 status (positive or negative) with
resistant or sensitive PTPC was evaluated using univariable lo-
gistic regression. Time-to-event outcomes were evaluated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in time-to-
event outcomes between patient samples with AR-V7–
positive and AR-V7–negative CTCs were evaluated using the
log-rank test. The association of AR-V7 status with time-to-
event outcomes was evaluated with hazard ratios (HRs) esti-
mated from univariable and multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression methods. The pretherapy predictors evalu-

cluded line of therapy, presence of liver and/or lung metasta-

els, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Using a best subset se-
lection method based on the global score χ2 statistic, pre-

from the final model. To address unique patients having ex-
posures to more than 1 therapy, the robust sandwich esti-
mate for the covariance matrix was implemented for all Cox
proportional hazards models to correct for possible underes-
timation of variance.24 All statistical analyses were 2-sided and
performed at the 5% significance level using SAS version 9.4
statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Clinical Characteristics of the Patient Population
A cohort of 161 patients with mCRPC who received a total of
193 treatments between September 2012 and March 2015 were
evaluated. Of these, 130 patients (80.8%) had a single therapy;
30 (18.6%), 2 therapies (60 samples); and 1 (0.6%), 3 thera-
pies.Patientandtreatmentcharacteristicsatthetimeofsample
collection are detailed in the Table.
Analytical Validation: Specificity of AR-V7 Detection
Tissue microarrays containing representative cancer, near-
tumor adjacent tissue, and healthy tissues alongside positive
and negative control samples were used to test assay speci-
ficity in an immunohistochemical format akin to the immu-
nofluorescent CTC assay. An independent pathologist
assessed the TMA slides and found no significant off-target
staining or background signal on the tissue sections. Impor-
tantly, the tissues on the array most pertinent as potential
sources of CTCs, such as liver, lymph nodes, and bone,
showed no appreciable specific or off-target staining, indica-
tive of a highly AR-V7–specific antibody (eFigure 2F in the
Supplement).
Specificity of AR-V7 in Patient Samples
Parallel AR assays (AR N-terminal and AR-V7) run on sister
slides revealed greater incidence of AR N-terminal-positive
CTCsrelativetoAR-V7–positiveCTCs(eFigure2EintheSupple-
ment), consistent with previous studies on AR-V7 prevalence
inrelationtototalARgeneproduct.10,11,20,25Ofthe193samples
tested, 191 (99%) were evaluable (2 samples were inevaluable
for subcellular localization): 72 samples (38%) were AR
N-terminal positive and AR-V7 negative; 4 samples (2%) were
AR N-terminal negative and AR-V7 positive; 30 samples (16%)
wereARN-terminalpositiveandAR-V7positive;and85samples
(44%) were AR N-terminal negative and AR-V7 negative.
AR-V7 Is Expressed in Multiple CTC Subtypes
AR-V7 expression was found on a variety of CTC subtypes, in-
cluding traditional CK-positive single CTCs (Figure 1A), CTC
clusters (Figure 1B), and CK-negative CTCs (Figure 1C). Here-
after, all 3 subtypes will collectively be referred to as CTCs.
Prevalence and Frequency of AR-V7 CTC Positivity Increases
by Line of Therapy
The majority of the CTCs detected were AR-V7 negative
(Figure 2D). AR-V7–positive CTCs were detected in 34 samples
with AR-V7–positive CTC burden ranging from 0.74/mL to
105/mL (median 2.4/mL), exhibiting a wide range of sub-
clonal contribution to total CTCs (median [range], 22% [0.3%-
100%]) (Figure 2). AR-V7–positive CTC detection frequency
increased by line of therapy (Figure 2A-C), ranging from 3%
(2 of 67 samples) prior to first-line therapy, 18% (9 of 50
samples) prior to second-line therapy, and 31% (23 of 74
samples) prior to third or subsequent lines of therapy
(Figure 2D; eTable in the Supplement) (P < .001).
Presence of AR-V7–Positive CTCs Predicts Posttherapy
PSA Change, rPFS, Time Receiving Therapy,
and OS With ARS Inhibitors
Of the 128 samples from patients treated with ARS inhibitors,
47 (37%) showed sensitive and 81 (63%) had resistant PTPC.
None of the 47 with sensitive PTPC had AR-V7–positive CTCs
(0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-9.41%). In contrast, 16 of the 81 with resis-
tant PTPC (20%; 95% CI, 12.1%-30.4%) had AR-V7–positive
CTCs prior to therapy (Figure 3A). Three of these 16 samples
had AR-V7 expression exclusively in CK-negative CTCs. A sub-
set analysis of the pre-ARS therapy samples with PSA-
resistant profiles (n = 81) showed dramatically worse OS with
pretherapy AR-V7–positive CTCs relative to those without
(median, 4.6 months vs not reached; P < .001) (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement).
Pre-ARS inhibitor samples with AR-V7–positive CTCs were
associated with worse outcomes in all time-to-event mea-
sures: rPFS (median, 2.3 vs 14.5 months; P < .001), time on
therapy (median, 2.1 vs 6.8 months; P < .001), and OS (me-
dian, 4.6 months vs not reached; P < .001) (Figure 3; eFigure
3 in the Supplement). This was not the case for pretaxane
samples, where time on therapy (median, 3.0 vs 3.7 months;
P = .23) and rPFS (median, 5.3 vs 6.6 months; P = .46) were not
significantly different by AR-V7 status. There was a signifi-
cant difference in OS for pretaxane AR-V7–positive vs AR-V7–
negative samples (median, 8.9 vs 19.8 months; P < .001). How-
ever, this difference is best interpreted in the multivariable
setting.
Patients Harboring Pretherapy AR-V7–Positive CTCs
Experience Better OS With Taxanes Than With
ARS Inhibitors After Adjusting for Clinical Measures
Patients with AR-V7–positive CTCs had longer median sur-
vival with taxanes relative to ARS inhibitors (median, 8.9 vs
4.6 months) even though taxanes tended to be administered
later (Figure 3A and B) when disease burdens were greater. To
adjust for this imbalance, a Cox proportional hazards model
incorporating line of therapy, presence of visceral metasta-
ses, lactate dehydrogenase, patient age, hemoglobin, therapy
type, and AR-V7 status was developed. Results showed that
AR-V7 status remained the most significant factor (P < .001)
among all pretherapy clinical measures (Figure 4A), and that
patients who were AR-V7 positive had more favorable sur-
vival times with taxanes relative to ARS inhibitors (HR, 0.24;

negative did not (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.44-1.95) (Figure 4B).
WhenappliedtoARN-terminal-positiveCTCs(inclusiveoffull-

a trend for improved survival with taxanes relative to ARS in-
hibitors (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.32-1.08) (eFigure 5 in the Supple-
ment). However, this effect was not statistically significant
(P = .11).
Discussion
The goal of a treatment-specific predictive biomarker is to de-
termine patients likely to have a poor outcome to a particular
drug or drug class and simultaneously identify a potentially
effective, already approved alternative therapy. Focusing on
the context of use of predicting response to either ARS inhibi-

tors or taxanes, we used an immunofluorescent AR-V7 pro-
tein assay on CTCs isolated from the blood of men with pro-
gressive mCRPC starting a new systemic therapy to evaluate
the association between detection of nuclear AR-V7–positive
CTCs and resistance to ARS inhibitors. Every patient harbor-
ing AR-V7–positive CTCs was resistant to treatment with ARS
inhibitors, including 3 patients with AR-V7 positivity only on
CK-negativeCTCs,cellsnotdetectablewithEpCAM-basedCTC
capture methods,26 including the previously reported AR-V7
mRNA transcript detection approaches.10-12 In contrast, no as-
sociationbetweenAR-V7positivityandPSAresponsetotaxane-
based therapy was observed. Taken together, our results, and
those of others,10-12 suggest that patients in whom AR-V7–
positive CTCs are detected would be better served with an ap-
proved taxane over abiraterone or enzalutamide.
A unique aspect of our approach was the focus on the de-
cision points in the management of individual patients in stan-
dard-of-care settings, where progressive disease required a
change in systemic therapy with already-approved standard
of care drugs. This enabled the assessment of clinical utility:
patient benefit for test use vs nonuse, and separately, the harm
associated with selecting an ineffective therapy with poten-
tial toxic effects. This therapy guiding approach is essential to
inform when and how to use a test in practice and for proper
evaluation by regulators and third-party payers. Here, the in-
cidence and burden of AR-V7–positive CTCs increased by line
of therapy (Figure 2), consistent with previous reports,8,27 sug-
gesting AR-V7 expression as an adapted response to systemic
therapy over time.
Ofnote,inAR-V7–positivesamples,amedian(range)ofonly
22% (0.3%-100%) of the CTCs were AR-V7–positive. However,
even when only one AR-V7–positive CTC was detected, only re-
sistantPTPCpatternsandshorterrPFS,timeontherapy,andOS
were observed on ARS inhibitors. Here, even among the sub-
set of patients with resistant PTPC, pretherapy AR-V7 positiv-
ity further stratified patients with the worst prognosis when
treated with ARS inhibitors (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The
clinical implication is that, within each line of therapy, once
AR-V7–positivecellsaredetected,thepreferredchoiceoftherapy
is a taxane rather than an ARS inhibitor.
Conclusions
The treatment-specific effect for taxane therapy in the set-
ting of AR-V7 positivity was shown when baseline factors as-
sociated with survival were accounted for in a multivariable
Cox proportional hazards model: patients who had AR-V7–
positive CTCs treated with taxanes had a much lower risk of
death than those on ARS inhibitors (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-
0.57; P = .035). This level of evidence has not been achieved
with other AR-V7 testing modalities.10,11 Given the magni-
tudeofsubstratificationandoutcomespecificityofthenuclear-
specific AR-V7 protein test in CTCs, a diagnostic-grade test that
informs the selection of ARS inhibitors or taxanes has the po-
tential to significantly improve outcomes, by enabling pa-
tients to receive treatments to which they are most likely to
respond while avoiding the toxic effects and costs associated
with an ineffective treatment. Prospective trials to validate
these findings and further elucidate clinical utility are cur-
rently in development.
