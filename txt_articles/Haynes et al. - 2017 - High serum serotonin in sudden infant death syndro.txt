Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the leading cause of post-
neonatal infant mortality, likely comprises heterogeneous disorders
with the common phenotype of sudden death without explanation
upon postmortem investigation. Previously, we reported that ∼40%
of SIDS deaths are associated with abnormalities in serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in regions of the brainstem critical in ho-
meostatic regulation. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIDS is asso-
ciated with an alteration in serum 5-HT levels. Serum 5-HT, adjusted for
postconceptional age, was significantly elevated (95%) in SIDS infants
(n = 61) compared with autopsied controls (n = 15) [SIDS, 177.2 ±
15.1 (mean ± SE) ng/mL versus controls, 91.1 ± 30.6 ng/mL] (P =
0.014), as determined by ELISA. This increase was validated using
high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-one percent (19/61)
of SIDS cases had 5-HT levels greater than 2 SDs above the mean of
the controls, thus defining a subset of SIDS cases with elevated 5-HT.
There was no association between genotypes of the serotonin trans-
porter promoter region polymorphism and serum 5-HT level. This study
demonstrates that SIDS is associated with peripheral abnormalities in
the 5-HT pathway. High serum 5-HT may serve as a potential forensic
biomarker in autopsied infants with SIDS with serotonergic defects.

S
udden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sud-
den death of an infant less than 1 y of age that remains un-
explained after a complete autopsy and death scene investigation
(1). Typically, SIDS is associated with a sleep period and with risk
factors in the sleep environment, e.g., prone/face-down sleep, bed-
sharing, soft bedding, and overbundling (2–4). Despite the national
safe sleep campaign, SIDS remains the leading cause of post-
neonatal infant mortality, with an overall rate of 0.40 SIDS deaths
per 1,000 live births (5). Our research in SIDS is based upon the
premise of the triple-risk model that posits that SIDS results from
three interacting factors impinging upon the infant simultaneously:
(i) an underlying vulnerability (disease process); (ii) a critical de-
velopmental period (infancy); and (iii) an exogenous stressor that
precipitates sudden death, e.g., asphyxia secondary to sleeping in
the prone or face-down position (6). SIDS is likely due to a het-
erogeneous group of disorders that present as sudden, unexplained,
sleep-related death, with subsets of vulnerabilities to be discovered
with the same clinical presentation. Although death is sudden, the
putative underlying vulnerability may be present subclinically for
days or months before death, even possibly originating during ges-
tation (7), remaining latent until the vulnerable infant is sufficiently
stressed in the critical postnatal period. Reports of apnea, cardiac
rate abnormalities, and arousal deficits in infants who subsequently
die of SIDS support this possibility (8–12) and suggest that as yet
undiscovered biomarkers of the disease process may be detectable
in readily accessible tissues as a predictor in living infants at risk for
sudden death. However, at the present time, there is no clinically
available biochemical or physiological biomarker of SIDS.
We have previously reported an important subset of SIDS
(∼40%) associated with abnormalities in the neurotransmitter se-
rotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in regions of the caudal
brainstem (medulla oblongata) that play major roles in homeostatic
regulation of hypercarbia and hypoxia during sleep (13–16). The
medullary 5-HT abnormalities in SIDS cases are notable for de-
creased levels of 5-HT and its key biosynthetic enzyme, tryptophan
hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), thereby characterizing the brainstem disorder
in a subset of SIDS as potentially due to 5-HT deficiency (14). Other
abnormalities in the medullary 5-HT network in SIDS include ab-
errations in 5-HT1A receptor binding and 5-HT cell density (13, 14).
There are no biomarkers of these 5-HT-related defects in autopsied
infants, and their demonstration at autopsy requires special research
techniques in frozen, and not fixed, tissues. Although 5-HT pro-
duced centrally is critical to homeostasis, greater than 90% of total
body 5-HT is produced peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract and
other organs (17). Approximately 95% of the 5-HT in blood is
carried in platelet dense granules (18), and serum contains the
secretion products of activated platelets, including their dense
granules. Despite this predominance of peripherally produced 5-HT,
nothing is known about peripheral levels of 5-HT in SIDS infants. In
the current study, we address this issue by analyzing serum 5-HT
levels, a peripheral marker of 5-HT metabolism, in SIDS cases
compared with autopsy controls. This information may provide in-
sight into the extent of defective 5-HT pathology in SIDS: whether it
Significance
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the leading cause of
postneonatal infant mortality, is defined as the sudden death
of an infant less than 1 y of age that remains unexplained after
a complete autopsy and death scene investigation. Although
SIDS has been associated with deficiencies in central (brain-
stem) serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), there are no
known peripheral biomarkers for SIDS. Here we demonstrate
increased serum serotonin levels in a subset (31%) of SIDS in-
fants compared with control infants. These findings suggest
the potential of a high serum serotonin level as a forensic
biomarker at autopsy to differentiate SIDS deaths with sero-
tonergic defects from other causes of sudden death and, im-
portantly, as evidence of a peripheral 5-HT abnormality in SIDS.

 is a generalized disorder of 5-HT metabolism, and if measures of
serum 5-HT could ultimately be used as a biomarker of 5-HT pe-
ripheral and central abnormalities in autopsied infants, as well as
living infants at risk for sudden death due to central 5-HT defects.
We specifically hypothesized that serum 5-HT levels are altered in
SIDS cases compared with infants dying of known causes.
Methods
Serum Cohorts.
Postmortem cohort. A cohort of SIDS cases (n = 61) and autopsied control
infants (n = 15) was accrued from 2007 to 2013 in collaboration with the San
Diego Office of the Medical Examiner in San Diego County, CA (Table 1).
Serum was available for research under the auspices of California Law
Chapter 955, Statutes of 1989 (SB 1069). The case and control adjudications
were based upon autopsy reports, clinical information, and death scene in-
vestigations, and were performed blinded to serum 5-HT values. In this
study, all SIDS cases, classified according to the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development classification of SIDS (1), were sudden,
unexpected deaths of infants under 1 y of age that remained unexplained
after a complete autopsy and death scene investigation (1). The controls
consisted of seemingly healthy infants who died of definable acute disorders
with no or only minor signs of clinical illness within 1 wk of death. Clinical
variables, e.g., gestational age at birth, postnatal age at death, gender, race,
perinatal and/or postnatal illnesses, and time of death were recorded. Var-
iables related to the sleep environment, i.e., sleep position at discovery or
history of bed-sharing the night of death, were also recorded, as well as
variables related to acute illness 48 h and 1 wk before death.
Living infant cohort. Serum samples were obtained from 40 living infants
(20 males and 20 females, ranging from 4.6 postnatal weeks to 1 y) through
the Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals Project, a
multicenter, nationwide initiative aimed at developing complete and accu-
rate pediatric reference intervals. These serum samples were collected from
metabolically healthy infants seen in outpatient dentistry, dermatology, and
eye clinics. No specific clinical information was available on these cases. Serum
was collected and transferred to Boston Children’s Hospital under the auspices of
a Research Ethics Board-approved protocol from The Hospital for Sick Children,
including informed consent from the parent/guardian.
Living adult cohort. To determine the potential effect on serum 5-HT levels of
time between blood collection and serum separation, serum was collected at
Boston Children’s Hospital from five healthy adult donors. These subjects
gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki before participation in this Institutional Review Board-approved study.
Serum 5-HT and 5-HIAA Measurements. At autopsy, blood was collected from
large blood vessels, placed into BD Vacutainer SST serum separator tubes
(containing a silica clot activator and polymer gel for serum separation; BD
Biosciences), and centrifuged. Serum was frozen at −80 °C until analysis.
Serum samples (25 μL) were analyzed in duplicate with an ELISA specific for
5-HT (catalog no. BAE 8900; Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Inc.). All serum
samples were run on the same 96-well ELISA plate, and duplicates were run
in an identical fashion on a separate ELISA plate. A subset of SIDS (n = 45)
and control (n = 12) serum samples were selected for confirmation of 5-HT
levels by the independent method of high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) performed by the Vanderbilt Neurochemistry Core, Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine. Selection of this subset was based on sample
availability. Because brainstem tissues were not available in every case,
correlative analysis of serum and brainstem 5-HT parameters could not be
performed in this cohort. Serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, a stable
breakdown product of 5-HT) was also measured by HPLC by the Vanderbilt
Neurochemistry Core. Serum samples from living infants were collected into
the same type of BD Vacutainer serum separator tubes used for the post-
mortem samples and analyzed by HPLC at the Vanderbilt Neurochemistry
Core, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
Analysis of Adult Donors. Freshly drawn venous blood from the healthy
subjects, who had not taken any antiplatelet medications within 7 d before
the study, was collected into 10-mL glass serum Vacutainers and 5-mL clot
activator and serum separation Vacutainers (BD Biosciences). After 0, 12, 24,
and 36 h, content from the serum Vacutainers was transferred into a serum
separation Vacutainer. To isolate serum from blood clots at these specific
time points, serum separation Vacutainers, including the one that was used
to directly draw blood into, were centrifuged (1,850 × g, 10 min). Super-
natant was taken off, and serum was frozen at −80 °C until analysis for
5-HT by ELISA.
The 5-HTTLPR Genotyping. We sought to determine if the putative abnormal
serum 5-HT levels were associated with a genotype of the serotonin trans-
porter (5-HTT) promoter polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR). DNA from brain, kidney,
or liver tissue was extracted using the Puregene DNA Extraction Kit and DNA
purification from Tissue protocol (Gentra Systems). Acquired DNA was then
amplified via PCR using published primer sequences and methods (19). To
determine the 5-HTTLPR genotype, PCR products were separated by gel
electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The short
[S; 486 base pairs (bp), 14 repeats] and long (L; 529 bp, 16 repeats) allele
variants of 5-HTTLPR were determined from the PCR fragment sizes, and
cases were assigned as S/S, S/L, or L/L genotypes.
Statistical Analysis. The t tests compared the following factors between SIDS
and controls: gestational age, postnatal age, postconceptional age (PCA),
postmortem interval (length of time between death and autopsy), and
storage length interval (length of time from serum collection to 5-HT mea-
surement by ELISA). The χ2 and Fisher exact tests were used to determine
potential differences in sex, race, and premature birth (<37 gestational
weeks). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tested for differences in serum
5-HT levels between SIDS cases and controls while controlling for potential
effects of age. Differences in the frequency of risk factors within SIDS subgroups,
as defined by serum 5-HT levels, were determined with t tests. ANCOVA tested
for differences in serum 5-HT levels between 5-HTTLPR genotypes, controlling
for diagnosis and age. Differences in the frequency of SIDS cases with high
versus normative levels of serum 5-HT within 5-HTTLPR genotypes were assessed
by Fisher exact test. To examine the effect of time of death on serum levels of
5-HT, Loess curves were fit by diagnosis. The curves did not assume a shape to
the relationship, but rather fit the best curve through the data with a 95%
confidence interval around the curve. All analyses were conducted using SAS
v9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.), and statistical significance was tested at level 0.05.
Results
Clinicopathologic Database. A final cohort of SIDS cases (n = 61)
and autopsied control infants (n = 15) was examined for serum
5-HT levels (Table 1). The causes of death of the controls were
crib accidents and mechanical suffocation, n = 5; acquired lung
disease, n = 3; clinically unsuspected congenital heart disease,
n = 2; accidental head trauma, n = 1; infection, n = 1; inborn
metabolic disorder, n = 1; histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, n = 1;
and congenital myopathy, n = 1. There were no significant dif-
ferences between SIDS and controls in the frequency of different

age, PCA, and postmortem interval (Table 1). There was a sig-
nificant difference in storage interval at −80 °C with SIDS being
stored for 5.6 ± 1.4 y and controls being stored for 4.8 ± 1.6 y
(P = 0.04) (Table 1). Potential effects of postmortem interval,
sex, storage interval, and interactions between diagnosis and age
were included in initial statistical modeling, but no associations
were found, and these variables were eliminated in final models.
Serum 5-HT and 5-HIAA Levels in SIDS Postmortem Cases Versus
Postmortem Controls. Serum 5-HT, measured by ELISA, was
177.2 ± 15.1 (SE) ng/mL for the SIDS cases (n = 61) compared
with 91.1 ± 30.6 ng/mL for the controls (n = 15) (P = 0.014) (Fig.
1A and Table 2), an average increase of ∼95% in the SIDS in-
fants compared with controls. In a subset of 57 cases (45 SIDS
and 12 controls), serum levels of 5-HT were also measured by
HPLC. Results confirmed the increase in serum 5-HT levels in
SIDS infants (114.6 ± 13.7 ng/mL) compared with controls
(52.4 ± 26.5) (P = 0.04) (Fig. 1A and Table 2). Serum 5-HT levels
determined by ELISA and by HPLC correlated positively with each
other [Spearman correlation of 0.84 in SIDS cases (P < 0.001) and
0.87 in controls (P < 0.001)] (Fig. 1B). There was no significant effect
of postmortem interval (Fig. 1C) or storage interval at −80 °C (SIDS,
mean of 5.6 ±1.4 y; controls, 4.8 ± 1.6 y) (Fig. 1D) upon the serum

 5-HT measurements. In our analysis examining time of death and
serum 5-HT, the Loess curves suggested that serum 5-HT was slightly
higher in the morning (data not shown). The confidence intervals,
however, reflected too much variation to permit conclusions of an
effect. In the HPLC analysis of serum, levels of the 5-HT breakdown
product 5-HIAA were also obtained. Although there was a numerical
increase in 5-HIAA levels in SIDS cases compared with control cases,
this increase did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09) (Table 2).
There was also no statistically significant difference in the ratio of
5-HT/5-HIAA between the two groups (Table 2).
Definition of the SIDS Subset with Elevated Serum 5-HT. After finding
the significant elevation in serum 5-HT in this SIDS cohort, we defined
post hoc “high” serum 5-HT as greater than 2 SDs above the mean of
the controls as determined by ELISA (≥211.8 ng/mL) and “normative”
serum 5-HT as below this cutoff (<211.8 ng/mL). The percent of SIDS
cases with high serum 5-HT was 31% (19/61) (Fig. 1A). There were no
controls above this cutoff level of serum 5-HT (Fig. 1A). The percent
of SIDS cases with known SIDS risk factors was compared between
SIDS cases with high serum 5-HT and those SIDS cases with nor-
mative levels. There were no significant differences in risk factors
for SIDS between the SIDS subset with high serum 5-HT levels
(n = 19) and the SIDS subset with normative 5-HT levels (n = 42)
(Table 3). The frequencies of male sex, prematurity, and discovery
in the prone position were not significantly different between
the two groups (Table 3). There was no significant difference in
postmortem interval (P = 0.58) or length of storage interval
(P = 0.91) between SIDS cases with high and normative levels
of 5-HT.
The 5-HTTLPR Genotype Association with Serum 5-HT Levels. In a
second post hoc analysis, we tested the hypothesis that the high
serum 5-HT subset was associated with the LL genotype of
5-HTTLPR. Of the SIDS cases, 58 out of 61 cases were geno-
typed; all control cases were genotyped. Among SIDS cases and
controls, there was no significant difference in the serum 5-HT
values across the different genotypes (Table 4). In the SIDS
cases, there was no significant difference in the frequency of
cases with high versus normative serum 5-HT levels within the
different 5HTTLPR genotypes (Table 5).
Effect of Breastfeeding on Serum 5-HT Levels. There were no sig-
nificant differences in serum 5-HT concentrations between (i)
control cases who were breastfed vs. control cases who were not
breastfed or (ii) SIDS cases who were breastfed vs. SIDS cases
who were not breastfed (Table S1 and Fig. S1).
Serum 5-HT and 5-HIAA Levels in Living Control Infants. As measured
by HPLC, living infant controls had higher 5-HT concentrations
(300.8 ± 25.0 ng/mL, mean ± SE, n = 40) than postmortem SIDS
(114.6 ± 13.7 ng/mL, n = 45) and postmortem control infants (52.4 ±
26.5, n = 12). As measured by HPLC, living infant controls had lower
5-HIAA concentrations (9.9 ± 1.1 ng/mL, n = 40) than postmortem
SIDS (70.1 ± 9.1 ng/mL, n = 44) and postmortem control infants
(36.3 ± 17.5, n = 12). There were no significant differences in serum
values of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and 5HT/5HIAA between living male in-
fants (n = 20) and living female infants (n = 20).
Effect of Delay in Serum Separation on Serum 5-HT Concentrations. To
assess the potential impact of a postmortem delay in serum sep-
aration on serum 5-HT values, normal adult blood was collected
using serum separator tubes identical to those used for the post-
mortem cohort. Of note, it was logistically impossible to obtain
IRB-approved, fresh serum samples from normal, living infants.
There was no significant difference in serum 5-HT concentration
as determined by ELISA between serum separated immediately
(346.3 ± 56.9 ng/mL), at 12 h (319.7 ± 98.7 ng/mL), 24 h (312.1 ±
102.1 ng/mL), or 36 h (297.6 ± 54.8 ng/mL).
Discussion
This study provides evidence of a blood biomarker for peripheral
5-HT abnormalities in SIDS. We identified an elevation in serum
5-HT levels in SIDS cases compared with postmortem controls,
with a subset of 31% of the SIDS cases with levels greater than
2 SDs above the mean of the controls. This study expands upon
the brainstem evidence suggesting that SIDS is a 5-HT disorder
related to an underlying vulnerability posited in the triple-risk

 model (6). High serum 5-HT levels at autopsy may help to distin-
guish the 5-HT-related vulnerability in infants with sudden, unex-
pected death from those infants with similar presentation mimicking
SIDS, but due to unsuspected infection, inborn errors of metabolism,
trauma, and accidental asphyxia. The evidence of brainstem (13–16),
and now peripheral, abnormalities in 5-HT pathway markers sug-
gests a key role for 5-HT metabolism in SIDS.
Platelets avidly take up 5-HT from the bloodstream via the
5-HT transporter and store it in dense granules, where it is protected
from the action of mitochondrial monoamine oxidases. Indeed,
∼95% of the 5-HT in blood is carried in platelet dense granules
(18), and serum contains the secretion products of activated
platelets, including the contents of their dense granules. An ex-
tensive body of investigation has used platelets as a peripheral
model of neuronal function in the central nervous system (20).
Multiple neurological disorders demonstrate functional abnor-
malities in platelets, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson dis-
ease, various psychiatric disorders, and autism (21–27). The major
forces driving these studies are the inherent difficulty of directly
accessing brain function in vivo and the critical molecular simi-
larities between platelets and central neurons. The presently
reported data suggest that measurement of the platelet stores of
5-HT, via measurement of serum 5-HT, may be an accessible means
of premortem identification of infants at risk for SIDS.
We did not find any associations of the high serum 5-HT levels
in the SIDS cases with any previously known risk factors definable
by autopsy and investigative reports in the cohort, including pre-
maturity, sleep position when found at discovery, history of minor
illness around the time of death, or with LL genotype of the 5-HT
transporter (5-HTT) polymorphism. Known polymorphisms of the
5-HTT gene (SLC6A4) have been extensively studied in various
disorders, including SIDS (28–30). The 5-HTTLPR is an insertion−
deletion polymorphism that consists of a repeated sequence of 22 to
23 base pairs that is present in 14 copies producing a short or “S”
allele or in 16 copies producing a long or “L” allele. The L allele and
the LL genotype are associated with increased gene transcription and
protein expression compared with the SS and SL genotypes (31, 32).
Although the association of the LL genotype on 5-HT uptake rate in
platelets has been documented (33), the effect of this genotype on
serum content of 5-HT is less well understood (33, 34). In the present
study, the lack of association between the LL genotype and high
values of serum 5-HT suggests that specific 5-HTTLPR genotypes,
shown to influence 5-HTT expression levels (31, 32), do not con-
tribute to the increased serum 5-HT in SIDS.
The cause(s) of the elevated serum 5-HT levels in the SIDS
subset in this study remains unknown. One potential cause is over-
production of peripheral 5-HT in SIDS without a proportional in-
crease in breakdown. In the HPLC analysis, we found a nonsignificant
trend toward an increase in the levels of 5-HIAA in SIDS cases
compared with control cases, consistent with an increase in 5-HT
peripheral breakdown; the lack of difference in the ratio of
5-HT/5-HIAA further suggests that the breakdown of 5-HT into
5-HIAA is proportionate with the increased 5-HT, and that there
is no lack of breakdown of 5-HT to account for the increased
serum 5-HT. Other potential sources of elevated serum 5-HT in-
clude enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the gut and pulmonary
neuroendocrine cells (PNEC) and neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) of
the lung. Greater than 90% of the peripheral 5-HT is produced in
the gut EC cells, and these cells are known to increase their se-
cretion of 5-HT under various conditions, including hypoxia (35)
and infection (36). PNEC and NEBs cells of the lung function as
airway oxygen/carbon dioxide sensors and release 5-HT in a dose-
dependent manner in response to hypoxia (37, 38). Although
there have been no reports in SIDS of increased 5-HT production
from EC cells of the gut, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of PNEC/
NEB within the lungs of infants dying of SIDS have been reported,
and secretory products of these PNEC/NEB cells have been pro-
posed previously as a potential biological marker of SIDS (38). The
relationship in SIDS between increased serum 5-HT and gut/lung
synthesis and release of 5-HT requires further research.
There are incomplete data on the maternal use of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in our cohort. In any event,
although gestational exposure to SSRIs appears to substantially
reduce serum 5-HT in cord blood (39), physiologically meaningful
SSRI exposure in infants through breastfeeding by mothers re-
ceiving SSRIs is probably infrequent (40–42). Thus, previous studies
of maternal SSRI treatment in breastfeeding mother−infant pairs
have demonstrated (i) elevated levels of SSRI and major metabo-
lites in the maternal plasma, but SSRI and major metabolites at or
below the lower limit of quantitation in paired breastfed infants; and
(ii) maternal SSRI use significantly decreases serum 5-HT levels in
the mother, but does not affect serum 5-HT levels in paired breastfed
infants (41, 42). In this study, there were no significant differences in
serum 5-HT concentrations between (i) control cases who were
breastfed vs. control cases who were not breastfed or (ii) SIDS cases
who were breastfed vs. SIDS cases who were not breastfed. Thus, 5-
HT in breast milk does not account for the differences in serum 5-HT
observed between SIDS cases and controls.
A potential limitation of this study concerns the effects of postmortem
interval, postmortem delay in serum separation, and lengthy storage
times on the stability of the serum 5-HT. We did not, however, observe
an effect of either postmortem interval or the time of serum storage on
the levels of serum 5-HT as measured by two independent assays
(ELISA and HPLC) (Fig. 1 C and D), supporting the relative stability of
the monoamine in postmortem samples stored under appropriate con-
ditions. Likewise, we did not see an effect of delayed serum separation,
albeit necessarily modeled using adult donor serum. A second limitation
to this study is the relatively small number of control samples, a problem
reflected in any postmortem infant study due to the difficulty in obtaining
control tissue. Although all of our control infants died of definable acute
disorders, the actual causes of death varied. Despite this variation among
the controls, we were able to define a significant subset of SIDS cases
with high serum 5-HT levels.
The presently reported 5-HT concentrations in healthy, living
infants in the first year of life are data that are not readily available
in the literature. Compared with postmortem infant SIDS and
postmortem infant control samples, living infant controls had
higher concentrations of serum 5-HT and lower concentrations of
5-HIAA. Likely explanations for the higher 5-HT and lower 5-HIAA
in sera from living subjects compared with postmortem in-
fants include that (i) the lower platelet counts in postmortem
samples compared with living controls results in less 5-HT

 available to be released from platelet dense granules into the se-
rum, (ii) there is less catabolism of 5-HT to 5-HIAA in living
subjects than occurs after death, and (iii) there are differences in
plasma clearance rates of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Because SIDS is, by
definition, the sudden, unexplained death of an infant, we were
unable to obtain serum samples from living infants who would
subsequently die of SIDS, as there is currently no biomarker,
biochemical or otherwise, to identify them. The present data do
not therefore allow us to confirm that 5-HT levels are higher in
living infants who will subsequently develop SIDS than in living
infants who will not subsequently develop SIDS. To address this
question, a large, long-term, prospective population study needs to
be performed. Importantly, however, the present study does allow
us to conclude that serum 5-HT is elevated in SIDS infants at
postmortem, because we have the appropriate controls: serum
from infants at postmortem who died of non-SIDS causes.
In summary, the available evidence of central and peripheral
abnormalities in the serotonergic system in SIDS infants pro-
vides essential information on a biological vulnerability in a
subset of infants who die of SIDS. Further research will be
necessary to validate, in an independent cohort, the present
finding of increased serum 5-HT in SIDS and to determine the
relationship or correlation between central and peripheral 5-HT
abnormalities. A high serum 5-HT value may ultimately prove to
be a peripheral biomarker of central 5-HT abnormalities in SIDS
cases, and its determination will be useful in identifying such
SIDS infants, i.e., as an autopsy biomarker. Postmortem serum
analysis of 5-HT by HPLC or ELISA is easier, less expensive,
and more efficient than analyses of brain 5-HT neurochemistry,
e.g., Western blotting and HPLC on micropunches of discrete
and tiny brainstem nuclei. These techniques require frozen brain
samples and oftentimes lengthy experiments (months for expo-
sure) such as receptor ligand autoradiography. HPLC on Guthrie
cards may be an option for future population screening, given
that 5-HT has been reliably measured from dried blood spots
(43). Further research aimed at understanding the association
between the increased serum 5-HT reported here and the decreased
brainstem 5-HT reported previously (14) will be essential for a
deeper understanding of 5-HT abnormalities as a pathological
mechanism underlying SIDS death.
