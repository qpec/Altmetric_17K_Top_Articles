Abstract
Introduction
Although hookah smoking is becoming a source of tobacco use
among college students in the United States, little is known of the
students’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding hookah
use. This cross-sectional study was aimed at determining the pre-
valence of hookah use and describing social and behavioral factors
associated with hookah smoking among university students in a
large urban university in Florida.
Methods
A convenience sample of 478 undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents was recruited. Lifetime use and current use was evaluated.
Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the independent
association between study covariates and hookah use.
Results
Prevalence among students of having ever used hookah during
their lifetime was 54.4%. Hookah use within the past 30 days was
16.3%. Hookah use was significantly associated with cigarette
smoking (odds ratio [OR], 4.52; 95% confidence interval [CI],
2.13–9.60)  and  hookah  ownership  (OR,  10.67;  95%  CI,
4.83–23.66)  but  not  with  alcohol  use  (OR,  1.73;  95%  CI,
0.74–4.04). Findings also suggest hookah is perceived as a safer
alternative to cigarette smoking. Almost 30% of those who never
smoked hookah reported they would consider smoking hookah in
the future.
Conclusion
Hookah smoking is popular among college students. Mispercep-
tions associated with hookah use indicate a starting point for de-
veloping health behavior change interventions. Future studies
should investigate social and behavioral determinants of hookah
use and determine the incidence of hookah use among college and
high school students. Tobacco control activities should include
prevention of hookah tobacco use in university settings.
Introduction
Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in the
United States (1). Although the 2014 Surgeon General’s report,
The Health Consequences of Smoking — 50 Years of Progress,
indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking is on the
decline, the report emphasizes the need to further monitor patterns
of use for all tobacco products, particularly as disparities in use
persist and alternate forms of tobacco use are increasing in pop-
ularity among youths (1). Hookah tobacco smoking, for example,
has increased tremendously (2,3). Hookah, also known as water
pipe or shisha, is a device used for smoking tobacco and other sub-
stances. Hookah smoking involves passing tobacco smoke through
water before inhalation (4). In a typical 1-hour hookah smoking
session, hookah users inhale approximately 90,000 mL volume of
smoke, which is substantially more smoke than the smoke from 1
cigarette (500–600 mL) (5,6). The charcoal used to heat the to-
bacco can raise health risks by producing high levels of carbon
monoxide, metals, and cancer-causing chemicals (6). One session
of hookah use contains approximately 200 puffs of smoke, which
exposes users to 3- to 6-fold higher levels of carbon monoxide and
46-fold higher levels of tar than from a single cigarette (6,7).

 Globally more than 100 million people use hookah regularly (8).
However, given the recent proliferation of hookah cafes world-
wide, this estimate is likely to increase (6). In the past decade,
2,000 to 3,000 new hookah cafes opened in the United States
alone (9). Until recently, few studies focused on hookah smoking,
and this practice was not considered a serious health problem
(7,10). Although studies have begun to examine hookah use
among college-aged students, the related socio-behavioral risk
factors are largely unknown (2,11). Reports do, however, suggest
hookah smoking is increasingly popular among youths in the
United States (11,12). Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional
study was to determine the prevalence of hookah use at a large
urban university in south Florida and to describe the knowledge
and practices associated with hookah use among university stu-
dents.
Methods
This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Subjects were re-
cruited from a convenience sample of students who were attend-
ing a large urban university in Florida during the 2011–12 aca-
demic year. To be eligible for participation, participants had to be
enrolled as a graduate or undergraduate student at the University
of South Florida (USF) during the spring 2012 semester. To as-
sess the prevalence of hookah use, a cluster sample of 478 stu-
dents was recruited. Students were asked to take a self-admin-
istered survey that included questions on demographics; current
hookah smoking (defined as hookah use in the past 30 days);
hookah use during their lifetime; associated risk factors; and
knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding hookah use.
Questions were designed based on a literature and expert review.
Before data collection, all study instruments were field-tested with
a sample of 20 students and revised on the basis of the test results.
To determine the required size for the overall sample and to calcu-
late cluster sizes (one-stage cluster sampling), we used the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention’s EpiInfo v.6 Statistical
Calculator’s “population study option” (parameters: total popula-
tion size, expected frequency, and worst acceptable). More than 30
natural clusters were sampled, including all the university’s col-
leges, 2 libraries, the student center, on-campus dormitories, and
the fitness center. The study was reviewed and approved by the
university’s institutional review board. All data were analyzed in
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). First, demographic characteristics of
hookah users and nonusers were compared using χ2 and Fisher ex-
act tests. Current and lifetime use prevalence was evaluated for the
entire sample and subgroups. Finally, unadjusted and adjusted
analyses using logistic regression modeling were conducted to
identify associated factors for hookah use. Analysis results were
adjusted for age, sex, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol use,
owning a personal hookah, having a friend who smoked hookah,
and proximity to hookah lounges.
Results
Sample description
In total, 478 participants were interviewed, of which 261 were wo-
men (54.6%) and 217 were men (45.4%) (Table 1), a ratio consist-
ent with the university’s enrollment in 2011–12 (women, 56%;
men, 44%; χ2 P = .540). Most (78.8%) were undergraduate stu-
dents, a finding also consistent with the USF enrollment (under-
graduate, 74%; graduate/postgraduate, 22%; χ2 P = .781). Parti-
cipants were of varied ethnicities including white (33.4%), Asian
(21.3%), Hispanic (17.4%), and black (12.8%). The sample ethni-
city was statistically different (P = .001) from the university’s en-
rollment in 2011–12, which was reported as white (60%), Hispan-
ic (17%), Asian (6%), and black (11%).
Current and lifetime prevalence of hookah smoking
Current prevalence of hookah use was 16.3% (95% CI, 13.0–19.7)
(Table 2). More men than women reported current hookah use
(22.2% men vs 11.5% women). Students of Middle Eastern des-
cent  reported  the  highest  prevalence  of  current  hookah  use
(24.4%), followed by white (17.3%), Asian (16.3%), Hispanic
(12.5%), and African American (3.6%) students. There was no dif-
ference in the prevalence of hookah smoking between undergradu-
ate (15.6%) and graduate (15.8%) students.
The prevalence of lifetime (ever use) of hookah in our sample was
54.4% (95% CI, 50.0–58.9) with 49.4% of women and 60.6% of
men reporting ever using a hookah. Lifetime use by race/ethnicity
was 68.2% for white students, 62.0% for Hispanic students, 53.5%
for Middle Eastern students, 42.3% for Asian students, 28.8% for
African American students, and 20.0% for Native American stu-
dents. Lifetime use among undergraduates was 53.8% and among
graduates was 54.1%. Additionally, prevalence of lifetime use was
2-fold higher among participants who owned a private hookah
(96.2%) than among those who did not (49.5%).
Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of hookah
smoking
When shown a picture of a standard hookah, most (95.8%) parti-
cipants recognized the image. When asked about the harmfulness
of hookah smoking, 74.6% indicated that hookah smoking is
harmful for health. However, 12.6% reported hookah smoking was
not harmful, and 12.8% reported they were unsure of the harmful-
ness. Most (50.6%) participants also indicated that cigarette

 smoking is more dangerous than hookah smoking. When asked to
identify the sources from which they received information on
hookah harmfulness, participants cited no formal means of acquir-
ing data about hookah safety or harm; they instead reported using
their own judgment (70.3%) or acquiring information from friends
(25.9%) or the Internet (22.4%). When asked about the presence
of hookah bars or lounges, 92.2% of participants reported having a
hookah bar or lounge within a 10-mile radius of their residential
area.
Those who had not smoked hookah were asked if they would ever
consider hookah smoking in the future. Almost 30% reported they
would.  Of  those  who  reported  they  would  consider  hookah
smoking in the future, reasons cited for this were the time togeth-
er with friends, the fun associated with the activity, the pleasant at-
mosphere, the social acceptability, and the perception that hookah
smoking was a healthier alterative to cigarette use.
Most (85.3%) respondents reported having a friend who smokes
hookah. More than 30% of the sample reported having a friend
who owns a hookah, while 11% of respondents reported owning
one themselves. Current hookah usage was 6-fold higher among
participants who owned a private hookah (60.8%) when com-
pared with those who did not (11.0%). Also, prevalence of current
hookah use was 4-fold higher among cigarette smokers (45.6%)
than among those who did not smoke cigarettes (11.3%).
Current hookah users were asked how often they smoke hookah in
a given month. Most (55.3%) reported smoking hookah once in a
month, with fewer smoking hookah twice a week (19.7%), once a
week (19.7%), or every day (5.3%). When asked about length of
exposure, almost half of current hookah smokers reported smoking
hookah for longer than 1 hour per session, with 32.4% smoking
for 61 to 120 minutes and 13.5% smoking greater than 120
minutes per session. Another 40.5% of participants reported
spending between 30 and 60 minutes a session and 13.5% repor-
ted smoking for less than 30 minutes.
Factors associated with hookah smoking
Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression modeling was conduc-
ted to determine the independent association between socio-demo-
graphic factors and hookah use as well as knowledge, attitudes,
and practices regarding hookah smoking (Table 3). In unadjusted
analysis, sex and race were significantly associated with increased
odds of hookah smoking. Men were 2.2 times more likely than
women to use hookah (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 1.33–3.64). When compared with whites, African Amer-
icans (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04–0.77) had significantly lower risk
of hookah smoking; the lower risk among Hispanics (OR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.31–1.50) was insignificant. The increased risk among
Middle Easterners (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.56–1.96) was not signi-
ficant.
Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, hookah ownership, and having a
friend who uses hookah were other significant risk factors in the
unadjusted model. However, in the adjusted model, only cigarette
smoking and hookah ownership remained significantly associated
with hookah use (controlling for sex, alcohol use, having friends
who use hookah, and having a hookah bar or lounge within 10
miles of one’s residence). Specifically, cigarette smokers were
4.52 times more likely than nonsmokers to use hookah. Moreover,
hookah ownership increased 10.67-fold the risk of hookah use.
Discussion
Findings from our study suggest the current prevalence of hookah
use among college students at USF is 16.3%. This rate is consist-
ent with prevalence studies conducted with college-aged youths
(11,13,14). Findings are also consistent with those of other studies,
including higher rates of smoking among men than among wo-
men, higher prevalence among non-Hispanic whites than among
other races, and higher prevalence among smokers than among
nonsmokers (13,14). The prevalence of ever using hookah (54.4%)
found in our study was higher than estimates reported by Fielder
and colleagues (15) in New York (about 45%) and by Smith and
colleagues (14) in California (about 25%).
The value of our study lies in the descriptive nature of the know-
ledge, attitudes, and practices of the current student population,
which shed light for potential preventive actions in university set-
tings. In particular, our study indicates 2 important factors that
must be addressed to curtail hookah smoking: the social nature of
hookah use and misperceptions regarding risk and harmfulness of
hookah smoking reported by nearly a quarter of our sample. Other
studies pointed to the importance of these factors as predictors of
increased prevalence of hookah smoking during college (11,14).
However, specific interventions are needed to dispel each differ-
ent belief of the population at risk. For instance, most respondents
acknowledged that hookah smoking has harmful effects, findings
consistent with other studies (10). Yet more than half of the
sample believed hookah smoking to be a safer alternative to cigar-
ette smoking and, regardless of their perception of harmfulness, al-
most a third of the sample reported they would consider hookah
smoking in the future. This finding suggests that knowledge re-
garding the harmful effects of hookah use may not be the most
substantial barrier to preventing hookah smoking and that correct-

 ing the misperception of hookah as a safer alternative may be a
more appropriate target for health education efforts. Further in-
vestigations into risk factors for hookah smoking initiation and
continuation are needed (14).
The reasons why individuals believe hookah smoking is a safer al-
ternative to cigarette smoking are unclear. However, there is no
evidence that the effects of the tobacco are less serious if a water
pipe is used (16). In our study, more than half of the sample per-
ceived  cigarette  smoking  as  more  dangerous  than  hookah
smoking. Yet data suggest that hookah smoking, because of high-
er levels of carbon monoxide and tar, poses a considerably greater
health hazard than cigarette smoking (6,9). Because of the filtra-
tion mechanism, smoke that emits from a hookah is softer and
lighter and has a more pleasant smell than smoke emitted from a
cigarette. This may lead smokers to a false belief that hookah
smoking is safe or harmless (17). Traditional antitobacco cam-
paigns focus on cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco with
little to no attention to hookah or other nicotine delivery systems,
potentially further spreading this false belief.
One notable reason that students consider hookah smoking is the
social nature of the activity, which may be a difficult barrier for
health education programs to overcome. Hookah smoking brings
with it numerous challenges not combated by previous antis-
moking campaigns, including the social aspect of relaxing with
friends and the fun associated with this activity. The high rate of
hookah device ownership in our study suggests that hookah
smoking may be moving from an occasional activity to a regular
habit. However, we could not find studies conducted in the same
setting with which to compare our study findings. In Florida, ef-
forts have been made to track tobacco use (including hookah)
among high school students through population-based surveys
(18), but data for college students are not gathered. Efforts are be-
ginning at the national level to track tobacco use (including
hookah) among college students in the United States, but institu-
tionally based studies are scarce. The absence of local data is a
limitation for direct local action. This situation should prompt uni-
versities to monitor alternative forms of tobacco use, including
hookah, e-cigarettes, and emerging alternatives, in local student
health assessments.
Our findings suggest the need for population-based studies to ex-
amine unintended effects of current regulations on alternative
forms of tobacco use. For instance, although Florida’s Clean In-
door Air Act regulates “any lighted tobacco product,” (19) many
hookah lounges are licensed as retail tobacco stores, exempting
them from the act. This loophole in the law creates the appearance
that hookah smoking may be permitted in places where cigarette
and cigar smoking is prohibited, which may be perceived as ac-
knowledgment that hookah smoking is safe for the public. Under
current regulations, hookah can be purchased from a hookah
lounge or an online shop without age restriction and hookah
products are widely available in convenience stores at lower prices
than cigarettes, making hookah an available and viable alternative
to cigarettes. Additionally, the lack of regulations on the proxim-
ity of hookah smoking cafés to university settings is also concern-
ing. Some have recommended regulations to prevent hookah es-
tablishments from operating near high schools or colleges, en-
forcement of strict identity checks, and the taxing of hookah
products as potential ways to combat the rising trends in hookah
use (12,20). More studies, both qualitative and quantitative, are
needed to examine the role of popular media in promoting new
hookah establishments near universities to evaluate whether
hookah is being portrayed as a “healthy” alternative to smoking.
As with any research initiative, this study is not without limitation.
Although numerous instruments for measuring hookah use have
been reported (21), we could not find a standardized tool avail-
able to estimate the prevalence of hookah use. Thus, our instru-
ment was designed based on available data in the literature. Al-
though this study makes an important step in developing such a
tool (ie, our instrument was pre-piloted, piloted, and field tested,
and revised multiple times before data collection), assessment of
factorial validity and cross-validation in large samples was out-
side the scope of our study. Future studies should attempt to as-
sess the psychometric properties of available research instruments
on larger samples. Another limitation is the cross-sectional nature
of our data. Specifically, our findings suggest cigarette smoking is
associated with hookah use. However, because of the cross-sec-
tional data, such association should be taken with caution and
must be further explored in longitudinal studies that can character-
ize risk more appropriately. More studies are needed to under-
stand the link between cigarette usage and hookah usage. Future
studies should compare the frequency and intensity of usage
between hookah and cigarette smoking. For instance, we were not
able to assess whether students were substituting cigarette use with
hookah use or whether they were using both smoking methods in
tandem. Cigarette smokers may indeed constitute a high-risk
group for hookah smoking, in which case additional efforts should
be aimed at cigarette smokers to increase their awareness of the
harmfulness of all alternative smoking mechanisms, including
hookah. Conversely, hookah smoking may be a gateway for
smoking. Our data do not permit such distinction, and we recom-
mend that panel studies be conducted in university settings to un-
cover why prevalence changes are occurring. Future studies
should attempt to disentangle the relationship between concurrent
cigarette smoking and hookah use. Because of the cross-sectional
nature of the data and the lack of comparison data from previous

 years, we could not assess trends. Because current trends in water
pipe use in other universities indicate that water pipe use is in-
creasing among college students (11,14,22), future studies must at-
tempt to examine hookah usage longitudinally and by year in uni-
versity.
Our findings indicate a need to monitor knowledge, attitudes, and
practices related to hookah use among college students. Misper-
ceptions associated with hookah use are a starting point for the de-
velopment of health behavior change interventions. On the basis
of our findings, we recommend that public health messaging con-
sider misperceptions regarding hookah use as a safe alternative to
cigarettes and target youths and college students as well as the
general public. Educational campaigns must be designed to ad-
dress misunderstandings regarding risks associated with hookah
smoking and should be inclusive of other recreational tobacco use
and nicotine delivery devices, including e-cigarettes, e-hookah,
and other emerging devices, as well as the regulation of sales and
marking of these devices. Future studies should attempt to gain a
deeper understanding of the social and behavioral determinants of
hookah use and determine the incidence of hookah use in repres-
entative samples of college and high school students. Tobacco
control activities should include prevention of water pipe tobacco
use in university settings.
