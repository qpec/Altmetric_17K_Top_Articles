Introduction
Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality and healthcare expenditure due to hospitalizations worldwide (1, 2). 
Bacterial products such as endotoxin play a key role in the development of a proinflammatory milieu and dis-
ease progression in cirrhosis (3, 4). Specifically, the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and spon-
taneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) have a strong gut-based origin (3). A growing body of literature has linked 
gut microbial DNA results with negative outcomes in cirrhosis (5–7). However, altered bacterial functionality 
characterized by endotoxemia and variability in secondary bile acids may influence outcomes rather than their 
composition (6, 8). These processes require live or highly active bacteria that are capable of interacting with the 
human host, mucosal immune system, and with other microbiota (9). This may not be discernible using conven-
tional 16S rDNA sequencing since this technique assesses the presence of microbial DNA regardless of bacterial 
activity and their dead/alive status (9, 10). It has been reported that the ribosome content of bacteria reflects the 
microbial metabolic activity and assaying the RNA content of a community would reflect the metabolic activity 
BACKGROUND. Cirrhosis is associated with gut microbial changes, but current 16S rDNA techniques 
sequence both dead and live bacteria. We aimed to determine the rRNA content compared with 
DNA from the same stool sample to evaluate cirrhosis progression and predict hospitalizations. 
METHODS. Cirrhotics and controls provided stool for RNA and DNA analysis. Comparisons were 
made between cirrhotics/controls and within cirrhosis (compensated/decompensated, infected/
uninfected, renal dysfunction/not, rifaximin use/not) with respect to DNA and RNA bacterial 
content using linear discriminant analysis. A separate group was treated with omeprazole 
for 14 days with longitudinal microbiota evaluation. Patients were followed for 90 days for 
hospitalizations. Multivariable models for hospitalizations with clinical data with and without DNA 
and RNA microbial data were created.
RESULTS. Twenty-six controls and 154 cirrhotics (54 infected, 62 decompensated, 20 renal 
dysfunction, 18 rifaximin) were included. RNA and DNA analysis showed differing potentially 
pathogenic taxa but similar autochthonous taxa composition. Thirty subjects underwent the 
omeprazole study, which demonstrated differences between RNA and DNA changes. Thirty-six 
patients were hospitalized within 90 days. In the RNA model, MELD score and Enterococcus were 
independently predictive of hospitalizations, while in the DNA model MELD was predictive and 
Roseburia protective. In both models, adding microbiota significantly added to the MELD score in 
predicting hospitalizations.
CONCLUSION. DNA and RNA analysis of the same stool sample demonstrated differing microbiota 
composition, which independently predicts the hospitalization risk in cirrhosis. RNA and DNA 
content of gut microbiota in cirrhosis are modulated differentially with disease severity, infections, 
and omeprazole use.

of the species in the community (11–16). Therefore, our hypothesis is that sequencing of 16S rRNA using the 
RNA of the same samples that were performed for the DNA analysis would provide a different and better under-
standing of the nature of microbiota functional changes in cirrhosis and help predict 90-day hospitalizations.
Results
We included 180 subjects for the cross-sectional part of the study, of whom 26 were healthy controls with 
154 cirrhotic patients. Within the cirrhosis group there were 62 patients with decompensation (controlled 
HE) (Table 1). There were also 54 patients who were infected and currently on antibiotics (Table 2). The 
leading infections were SBP (n = 15) followed by urinary tract infections (n = 13), bacteremia (n = 10), cel-
lulitis (n = 5), Clostridium difficile (n = 6), and respiratory infections (n = 5). 
Thirty additional subjects (15 controls and 15 compensated cirrhotic patients) were included for the 
before/after proton pump inhibitor (PPI) part of the study (17).
RNA alone, DNA alone, and RNA ratio microbiota comparison between groups
Controls versus cirrhosis comparison. The genera that were different between controls and cirrhotics were dif-
ferent in RNA versus DNA. Using DNA, Veillonella was higher in cirrhosis, while for RNA it was higher 
in Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. While the taxa found in greater relative abundance in controls belonged 
largely to the same families (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcacaeae), the genera themselves were differ-
ent when the RNA was compared with the DNA between the groups (Figure 1, A and B). RNA ratios 
(RNA/[RNA + DNA]) in controls versus cirrhosis comparison: A higher representation of RNA ratios of 
Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcacae, and Veillonellaceae was seen in cirrhotic patients (Supplemental Figure 1;

In controls, on the other hand, there was a higher representation of Clostridiales members, families 
belonging to Bacteroidetes (Rikenelleaceae and Prevotellaceae) and Verrucomicrobiaceae. There was a signifi-
cantly lower median cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (CDR: [Lachnospiraceae + Ruminococaceae + ClostridialesXIV 
+ Veillonellaceae]/[Enterobacteriaceae + Bacteroidaceae]) in cirrhotic patients on DNA (cirrhosis 0.24 vs. 1.1 
controls, P < 0.0001) and on RNA (cirrhosis 0.32 vs. 0.98 controls, P < 0.001) compared with controls (6).
Patients with and without decompensation. In RNA analysis, there were higher potentially pathogenic 
genera (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter) in HE patients, while those belonging to autochtho-
nous families were higher in the no-HE patients. On the other hand, DNA still showed Enterococcus at 
a higher level, while genera belonging to Gram-positive cocci (Peptostreptococcaceae, Streptococcaceae, and 
Staphylococcaceae) were higher in HE patients. The autochthonous family genera, however, were largely 
similar to the ones increased in the RNA results (Figure 2, A and B). RNA ratio of patients with and 
without decompensation: A higher Bacteroidetes taxa (Rikenelleaceae and Prevotellaceae) and lower Entero-
cocceae and Peptostreptococcaceae were seen in patients without decompensation (Supplemental Figure 2). 
There was a significantly lower CDR by DNA analysis (median 0.32 decompensated vs. 0.54 compen-
sated, P = 0.04) and RNA analysis (median 0.24 decompensated vs. 0.37 compensated, P = 0.02).
Infected with or without uninfected cirrhotic patients. There were significant differences between these 
groups in both DNA and RNA analyses by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). By 
RNA analysis the infected groups had a relatively higher abundance of taxa belonging to Enterobacte-
riaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Erysipelothricaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae. Interestingly, very few of these were

actually found in the DNA analysis differentiating infected from uninfected cirrhotic patients. On the 
other hand, regardless of RNA and DNA, similar autochthonous taxa were seen in uninfected patients 
(Figure 3, A and B). RNA ratio of patients with and without infection: Infected patients had a higher 
RNA ratio of Enterococcaceae and Actinomycetales, and a lower ratio of Bacteroidetes (Rikenellaceae and 
Porphyromonadaceae) and Acidaminococcaceae compared with uninfected cirrhotic patients (Supplemental 
Figure 3). There was a significantly lower CDR in infected patients in the DNA (median 0.31 infected 
vs. 0.55 uninfected, P < 0.0001) and in RNA (median 0.22 infected vs. 0.35 uninfected, P = 0.01) analy-
ses compared with uninfected patients.
Renal dysfunction and its impact on microbiota. Since the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score 
consists of 2 primary liver-related laboratory variables (international normalized ratio [INR] and total 
serum bilirubin) and 1 renal variable (serum creatinine), we also defined the relative contribution of renal 
dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl) to microbial composition. Twenty cirrhotic subjects had renal 
dysfunction and these patients had equivalent INR (1.7 ± 1.01 vs. 1.5 ± 0.5, P = 0.1) and bilirubin (2.6 ± 
2.7 vs. 2.7 ± 4.2, P = 0.9) compared with cirrhotic patients without renal dysfunction. On LEfSe, renal dys-
function was associated with significantly higher relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae taxa and lower 
Lachnospiraceae taxa (Figure 4, A and B).
Comparison of  patients with and without rifaximin. In the 85 cirrhotic patients who were not on absorb-
able antibiotics and were free of infection, 19 were on rifaximin. Using the DNA analysis, there was a 
higher relative abundance of Staphylococcaceae and members of Actinobacteria such as Micrococcaceae and 
lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and other Clostridial taxa in patients on rifaximin. In the RNA 
analysis, there was again higher relative abundance of taxa belonging to Actinobacteria with also higher 
Veillonellaceae, while only Rikenelleaceae was lower in rifaximin users (Figure 5, A and B).
Longitudinal study with omeprazole
As part of a previous study, we analyzed samples of compensated cirrhotic patients and age-matched 
healthy controls before/after 40 mg omeprazole daily for 14 days (17). There was a significant change in 2 
families related to oral microbiota, Streptococcoceae and Veillonellaceae, in varying degrees. While the relative 
abundance of Streptococcoceae increased in controls and cirrhotics after PPI, the magnitude of increase was

higher in the DNA isolates, likely indicating a less metabolically active increase. On the other hand, Veil-
lonellaceae were higher in cirrhotics by RNA but not DNA analysis, indicating a more metabolically active 
change after PPI (Figure 6, A and B).
Hospitalization prediction
Of the 154 patients included, 9 died within 90 days (3 during the index hospitalization and 6 were sent to 
hospice). Of the remaining 145, 36 (25%) were hospitalized within 90 days for nonelective reasons. The 
major causes were HE (n = 11), followed by ascites/hepatic hydrothorax management (n = 9), acute kidney 
injury (n = 8), infections (n = 4), and liver-unrelated reasons (n = 4). On univariate analyses, several clini-
cal and bacterial variables were significantly associated with these hospitalizations (Supplemental Table 1). 
Because of the large number of variables under consideration, a screening process was conducted to deter-
mine variables to consider for a multivariate model. This screening was conducted by performing a series 
of univariate binary logistic regression models. Any variables that had a P < 0.20 level of significance in the 
univariate binary logistic regression models were used in a multivariable binary logistic regression model. 
The clinical variables that met this criterion for both RNA and DNA models (P < 0.20) are as follows: age, 
male gender, HE, infection, PPI, and MELD score. Additionally, the DNA microbiota that were signifi-
cant were Bacteroides, Citrobacter, Enterococcus, Blautia, Lachnospiraceae incertae Sedis, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, 
Parabacteroides, Fecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Veillonella. The RNA microbiota that were significant 
on univariate analysis were Bacteroides, Klebsiella, Raoultella, Enterococcus, Lachnospiraceae incertae Sedis, Rose-
buria, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Alistipes, Fecalibacterium, Oscillispira, and Veillonella.
Once the variables to be considered in the multivariable binary logistic regression were determined, 2 
models for hospitalizations were considered: 1 for DNA-linked microbiota and clinical variables and 1 for 
RNA-linked microbiota and clinical variables. The multivariable binary logistic regression models were fit 
using a backwards elimination procedure where all variables that remained in the model had to be signifi-
cant at the P < 0.05 significance level, the results of which are shown in Table 3.

On multivariable analysis in the RNA model, MELD score (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95%CI 1.02–1.17, 
 
P = 0.008) and Enterococcus (OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.38–19.31, P = 0.01) were associated with hospitalizations.
In the DNA model, MELD was again associated with hospitalizations (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.02–1.16, 
P = 0.01), while Roseburia was protective against hospitalizations (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04–0.87, P = 0.03).
Clinical utility of hospitalization prediction beyond the MELD score
The final models for both DNA and RNA were compared to the model with MELD-only using the method 
proposed by DeLong et al. (18) for comparing the AUC under correlated receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves. For the DNA model, the model with MELD-only had an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI [0.60, 0.82]), 
while the model with MELD and Roseburia had an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI [0.69, 0.89]). The increase in AUC 
with the addition of Roseburia was 0.07 (95% CI [0.0102, 0.1096]), which was statistically significant (P = 
0.045) compared with the MELD model alone.
For the RNA model, the model with MELD-only had an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI [0.60, 0.83]), while the 
model with MELD and Enterococcus had an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI [0.66, 0.88]). The increase in AUC with 
the addition of Enterococcus was 0.06 (95% CI [0.018, 0.11]), which was statistically significant (P = 0.042) 
compared with MELD alone.
Discussion
Patients with cirrhosis have a poor prognosis that is often related to disease processes that are initiated 
and propagated by a proinflammatory gut and systemic milieu (19). Since bacterial functionality, including 
endotoxin production and bile acid modification, may play an important role in the disease progression, the 
delineation of living or metabolically active bacteria is relevant (3). In addition, current prognostic systems 
in cirrhosis are often inadequate in predicting relevant outcomes such as hospitalizations (2).
There have been several studies evaluating the role of alive versus dead bacteria, and qPCR of the DNA has 
been shown to detect bacterial cells several days to weeks after a loss of viability with antibiotics (20). This has 
also been corroborated with other techniques that focus on individual strains and bacteria (21–23). Alternatives 
such as viability PCR and molecular viability testing have been studied to definitively assess live versus dead 
bacteria but these are difficult to do in a microbiome-wide assay. Gut microbiota based on DNA have been used 
in cirrhotic patients to define disease severity, link with systemic inflammation, and also define outcomes such as 
death and hospitalizations (5–7). Hence, the linkages between dead and live bacteria in these samples are impor-
tant since cadaver cells after antibiotic and other therapies may persist and confound interpretation of the 16S 
rRNA sequencing (20). Therefore, the current study employed bacterial RNA extracted from the same sample 
and the ultimate DNA was extracted with the hypothesis that active RNA synthesis implies active bacteria, while 
DNA can be a mixture of both live and dead bacteria or at the very least bacteria with a relatively low activity (9).

In cross-sectional analyses that differentiated between healthy controls and cirrhotic patients and 
between cirrhotic patients with and without decompensation or infection, we found significant changes 
in the DNA, as previously published (5, 6, 24). Most of these changes pointed towards a higher relative 
abundance of autochthonous taxa and lower potentially pathogenic taxa such as Enterobacteriaceae and 
Enterococcaceae. The interesting finding was that while the RNA changes were similar with respect to the 
autochthonous taxa, the taxa that were higher in the more diseased groups (cirrhosis, decompensated, and 
infected) were different in the RNA-only analysis compared with the DNA-only analysis. Therefore, there 
was a lack of concordance between taxa present in the DNA- versus RNA-only analyses. The taxa present 
in only DNA but not RNA could be potentially dead bacteria. It is also likely that the taxa present in RNA 
but not in DNA are metabolically active but did not reach the relative abundance cutoff (1%) that was used 
in the DNA analysis.
It is interesting that autochthonous taxa were overrepresented in both RNA-only and DNA-only 
analyses in the less severe groups. This likely demonstrates the ability of these taxa to continue produc-
ing their beneficial end-products such as short-chain fatty acids and their relative stability after analysis 
(25). This is encouraging in that these bacteria could continue to beneficially impact host-microbiota 
interactions. On the other hand, while potentially pathogenic families were higher in the groups with 
advanced disease or infections, specific taxa differed when compared between RNA and DNA analyses. 
This may be relevant because these taxa are widely used as markers of advanced disease, can predict 
hospitalizations and negative outcomes, and can also help determine who develops organ failure based 
on the DNA analysis. Many of these taxa are directly linked to infections and organ failure in cirrhosis, 
especially Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus (26, 27). These bacterial taxa in the past have only 
been characterized in cirrhosis using direct culture methods or DNA. However, our analysis using the 
RNA methodology examines a potentially novel aspect of bacterial taxa description in cirrhosis. In 
addition, we found that taxa normally found in the saliva, such as Streptococcaceae, were higher after PPI 
use in both controls and cirrhotics by DNA analysis, as published previously (17), indicating that PPI 
use allows these microbiota to be found in the stool. However the increase in Veilloneallaceae, another 
upper-GI microbial family, was nuanced, since it was higher in RNA, indicating potentially greater 
metabolic activity, but not in the DNA after PPI. This difference reflects another aspect of the discor-
dance between the DNA and RNA assessment.

The additional contribution of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis progression has been published extensively 
(28). There are also studies demonstrating that renal dysfunction without cirrhosis is associated with dys-
biosis (29). We found that additional renal dysfunction, regardless of cirrhosis severity on INR and bilirubin 
levels, was associated with further depletion of autochthonous taxa and increased relative abundance of 
Enterobacteriaceae taxa compared with those without renal dysfunction. This was similar in both RNA and

DNA analysis, demonstrating the robust negative contribution of renal dysfunction towards this change.
A clinically relevant reason for microbiota analysis is their association with outcomes in patients, 
which has the potential to increase its use in clinical practice. In cirrhosis, most negative outcomes stem 
from complications such as infections that result in hospitalizations. The hospitalization risks in cirrhosis 
are incompletely predicted by purely clinical parameters, which is why the addition of microbiota vari-
ables could add a novel aspect (2). DNA analysis showed that Roseburia, a short-chain fatty acid–produc-
ing genus of Lachnospiraceae, was associated with protection from hospitalizations independent of the 
expected association with the MELD score. On the other hand, the RNA of Enterococcus was additive to 
MELD in the prediction of hospitalizations. Members of the genus Enterococcus have been associated with 
infections and also increase after PPI use in patients with cirrhosis and alcohol use (30, 31). Therefore, 
this pattern of differential modulation with Roseburia being protective and Enterococcus being predictive of 
hospitalizations lends biological plausibility to these results. Moreover, we found a significant increase in 
the predictive capability of the regression formula for both RNA- and DNA-related microbiota in addition 
to the current clinical variables. For an outcome that is as expensive and clinically significant as hospital-
izations, we believe this significant increase in both these models is an important finding that substantiates 
our conclusions. The potential mechanisms regarding the occurrence of dysbiosis is related to overgrowth 
of potentially pathogenic taxa that would normally be suppressed by the existing barriers against this 
(gastric acid, bile secretion, and autochthonous taxa), all of which are impaired in cirrhosis and further 
worsened by superadded PPI use (6, 8, 17, 24).
Recent studies have suggested that the ribosome content of cells is not necessarily directly related to 
metabolic activity (32, 33) and it has been suggested that quorum sensing in complex communities also 
affects microbial community activity (9). Thus, more direct measures of metabolic activity need to be uti-
lized, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics, to fully understand the microbial dynamics in 
the gut ecosystem. Further analyses before and after antibiotics are also needed to fully evaluate their role 
in suppressing the activity of bacteria.
We conclude that DNA and RNA analysis of the same stool sample demonstrated differing micro-
biota composition regardless of whether it was tested from healthy subjects or cirrhotic patients. 
Autochthonous taxa are relatively similar between DNA and RNA analyses and are modulated differ-
entially with renal dysfunction and rifaximin and PPI use. These changes in the microbiota composi-
tion with RNA and DNA profiles predict the hospitalization risk in cirrhotic patients independently 
of clinical variables.
Methods
This study was carried out prospectively in the Virginia Commonwealth University and Richmond 
VA Medical Centers. Patients with cirrhosis (defined through biopsy, features of decompensation, 
endoscopic or radiological evidence of varices or cirrhosis in the setting of chronic liver disease) were 
recruited from inpatient and outpatient settings after informed consent. Stool collection for DNA and 
RNA was performed using Parapak and stool was stored in RNAlater until it was ultimately extracted. 
Concomitantly, blood was drawn for MELD score (validated logarithmic score for cirrhosis severity) 
(34). In the cross-sectional study, we enrolled 4 groups of subjects: (a) healthy controls, (b) compensated 
outpatient cirrhotics, (c) decompensated outpatients due to HE, and (d) inpatients with infections.
Ultimately, patients were followed for 90 days for nonelective hospitalizations and multivariable analy-
sis predicting these outcomes was evaluated.

An additional 30 subjects (15 healthy controls and 15 compensated cirrhotic outpatients) were included 
for the before/after omeprazole study (17). All subjects underwent stool collection at baseline and were 
given 40 mg omeprazole once per day for 14 days, at which point stool was collected again.
Statistics. RNA relative abundances, DNA relative abundances, and a separate variable, RNA/(RNA 
+ DNA) (referred to here as the RNA ratio), were evaluated for each taxon present at the genus level. The 
RNA ratio could only be calculated if both RNA and DNA of a particular taxon were present. Therefore, 
this was calculated in the selected population with both RNA and DNA of a particular taxon. Analysis 
of DNA alone, RNA alone, and RNA ratios between groups was performed using LEfSe techniques that 
compared (a) all cirrhotic patients to healthy controls, (b) compensated patients to decompensated patients, 
and (c) infected patients to uninfected cirrhotic patients. We also studied the CDR ([Lachnospiraceae + Rumi-
nococaceae + ClostridialesXIV + Veillonellaceae]/[Enterobacteriaceae + Bacteroidaceae]) between groups.
In addition, we used LEfSe to study changes in microbial composition on RNA and DNA analysis in 
cirrhotic patients who were on and not on rifaximin after excluding those with infections and those who 
were not on SBP prophylaxis. We also split the group of cirrhotic patients according to renal dysfunction 
(serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl) and used LEfSe to compare microbial differences in RNA and DNA analyses 
depending on predominant renal or hepatic failure. In addition, we used Wilcoxon’s signed rank-sum test to 
evaluate before/after–PPI changes in taxa at the family level by RNA and DNA analyses for the trial analysis.
Hospitalizations: Due to the large number of variables under consideration, a screening process was 
conducted to determine variables to consider for a multivariate model. This screening was conducted by 
performing a series of univariate binary logistic regression models. Any variables that had a P < 0.20 level 
of significance in the univariate binary logistic regression models were used in a multivariable binary logis-
tic regression model. Once the variables to be considered in the multivariable binary logistic regression 
were determined, 2 models for hospitalizations were created: 1 for DNA-linked microbiota and clinical 
variables and 1 for RNA-linked microbiota and clinical variables. The multivariable binary logistic regres-
sion models were fit using a backwards elimination procedure where all variables that remained in the 
model had to be significant at the P < 0.05 significance level.
We created ROC curves to define the relative AUC for RNA-containing versus DNA-containing mod-
els. AUCs were determined by analyzing the Youden index of the ROC curves. In order to define the utility 
of the ultimate clinical+microbiota model compared to clinical variables alone, we used the method pro-
posed by DeLong et al. (18) for comparing the AUCs of correlated ROC curves.
Study approval. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both hospitals and all 
participants provided written informed consent.
Detailed methods. Stool samples, which were kept at –80°C in RNAlater, were thawed at 4°C. Two ali-
quots (approximately 100 μl each) were separated after mixing the sample for DNA and RNA extractions. 
The aliquoted samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 g to pellet the stool and separate RNAl-
ater. Supernatant RNAlater was discarded and the stool pellet was used in further extractions according to 
the respective protocols. The RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen and the cDNA 
was made with GoScript kit from Promega. The reverse bacterial 16S primer (1492R) was used to make 
the cDNA. A control PCR for RNA samples was run to detect any DNA contamination and RNA samples 
were treated with extra DNase treatment if any DNA contamination was detected. DNA was extracted 
with FastDNA Spin kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Both DNA 
and cDNA were used in PCRs with universal bacterial primers (please see detail below) for the first 2 vari-
able regions (L27F and 355R) (35). DNA or cDNA was amplified by PCR for sequencing using Ion Torrent 
technology (36). The same products were also fingerprinted as a quality control (37). For PCR, a fusion 
forward primer 27F (5′-AGAGTTºTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′), which contained different 8-bp tags and 
an adapter for sequencing with PGM (Ion Torrent technology), and a FAM-labeled reverse primer 355R′ 
(5′-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3′), which included the reverse adapter, were used in duplicate PCRs. 
Both primers are universal for bacteria and amplify the first 2 variable regions of the 16S rDNA. For finger-
printing, the PCR products were diluted according to their intensity based on agarose gel electrophoresis 
images and mixed with ILS-600 size standards (Promega) and HiDi Formamide (Applied Biosystems). The 
diluted samples were separated on an ABI 3130xl fluorescent capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) 
and analyzed using the Genemapper software package (Applied Biosystems). The quality of products was 
determined and duplicates were checked for confirmation and the best dilution was selected for pooling 
into one sample for sequencing. The sample was purified using Ampure magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter)

and quantified using a DTX880 Multimode Fluorescent detector (Beckman Coulter) before sequencing. 
The sequencing was done on a Personal Genome Machine using Ion Torrent technology (Applied Bio-
systems) following the manufacturer’s protocols. The sequences were demultiplexed and uploaded into 
Galaxy portal for further analysis.
