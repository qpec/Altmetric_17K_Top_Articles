During the 2015–16 influenza season (October 4, 2015–
May 21, 2016) in the United States, influenza activity* was 
lower and peaked later compared with the previous three sea-
sons (2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15). Activity remained 
low from October 2015 until late December 2015 and peaked 
in mid-March 2016. During the most recent 18 influenza 
seasons (including this season), only two other seasons have 
peaked in March (2011–12 and 2005–06). Overall influenza 
activity was moderate this season, with a lower percentage of 
outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI),† lower hospi-
talization rates, and a lower percentage of deaths attributed to 
pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared with the preced-
ing three seasons. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses pre-
dominated overall, but influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more 
commonly identified from October to early December, and 
influenza B viruses were more commonly identified from mid-
April through mid-May. The majority of viruses characterized 
this season were antigenically similar to the reference viruses 
representing the recommended components of the 2015–16 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (1). This report 
summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 
2015–16 influenza season (October 4, 2015–May 21, 2016)§ 
and reports the vaccine virus components recommended for 
the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.
Viral Surveillance
Approximately 350 public health and clinical laboratories in 
the United States report influenza test results to CDC through 
either the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating 
Laboratories System or the National Respiratory and Enteric 
Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS).¶ During October 4, 
2015–May 21, 2016, U.S. WHO participating public health 
laboratories tested 68,886 specimens for influenza viruses, and 
26,538 results were positive; 18,781 (70.8%) were influenza A, 
and 7,757 (29.2%) were influenza B viruses (Figure 1). Of the 
18,437 influenza A viruses subtyped, 14,877 (80.7%) were influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 3,560 (19.3%) were influenza 
A(H3N2) viruses. Lineage was determined for 4,912 (63.3%) 
influenza B viruses; 3,367 (68.5%) were B/Yamagata lineage, and 
1,545 (31.5%) were B/Victoria lineage.
Clinical laboratories participating in NREVSS tested 639,456 
specimens for influenza viruses; 64,921 (10.2%) were positive 
(Figure 2). Of the positive specimens, 44,201 (68.1%) were 
influenza A viruses, and 20,720 (31.9%) were influenza B 
viruses. Based on the percentage of specimens testing positive 
for influenza, activity peaked during the week ending March 12, 
2016 (surveillance week 10), when 23.7% of specimens tested 
in clinical laboratories were positive for influenza.
Age of the patient was reported for 23,338 (87.9%) of the 
influenza positive specimens tested by public health laboratories 
and included 2,657 (11.4%) children aged 0–4 years, 7,062 
(30.3%) persons aged 5–24 years, 9,969 (42.7%) persons 
aged 25–64 years, and 3,650 (15.6%) persons aged ≥65 years. 
Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated among all age 
groups, accounting for approximately half of influenza detections 
in persons aged 5–24 years and ≥65 years and 69% and 67% 
among persons aged 0–4 and 25–64 years, respectively. The 
largest number of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses 
were reported among persons aged 5–24 years.
Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the most commonly 
reported influenza virus in all U.S. Department of Health and 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects information in five categories 
from nine data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System, 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System, and influenza-
associated pediatric mortality reports); 4) hospitalizations (Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Network [FluSurv-NET], which includes the 
Emerging Infections Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 
5) a summary of the geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial 
epidemiologist reports).
† Defined as a temperature of ≥100.0°F (≥37.8°C), oral or equivalent, and cough 
or sore throat, in the absence of a known cause other than influenza.
§ Data reported as of June 3, 2016.
¶ World Health Organization and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System laboratories include both public health and clinical 
laboratories located throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
Columbia that contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza. Clinical 
laboratories test respiratory specimens for diagnostic purposes, whereas public 
health laboratories primarily test specimens for surveillance purposes. Because 
of differences in these testing practices, virologic data for clinical and public 
health laboratories is being presented separately beginning with the 2015–16 
influenza season.

Human Services regions**; the proportion of influenza infec-
tions from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses ranged from 
75% in Region 5 to 36% in Region 6. Influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses accounted for approximately 25% of viruses reported 
in Regions 6 and 9, and influenza B viruses accounted for 
approximately 43% of viruses reported in Region 10.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
During the 2015–16 influenza season, three human 
infections with novel influenza A viruses were reported to 
CDC. An influenza A(H1N1) variant (H1N1v) virus†† 
infection was reported by the Minnesota Department of 
Health during the week ending December 12, 2015. The 
patient reported no direct contact with swine in the week 
before illness onset but lived and worked in an area near 
where swine were housed. An influenza A(H3N2) variant 
(H3N2v) virus infection was reported by the New Jersey 
Department of Health during the week ending January 2,

†† Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in human 
populations have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

2016, in a patient who reported no direct contact with 
swine during the week before symptom onset but who had 
visited a farm where swine were present. Neither of these 
patients were hospitalized, and both recovered fully. No 
evidence of human-to-human transmission was identified. 
An influenza A(H1N2) variant (H1N2v) virus infection was 
reported by the Minnesota Department of Health during the 
week ending May 7, 2016, in a patient who was hospitalized 
as a result of the illness, but who recovered fully. The patient 
refused to be interviewed during the investigation; therefore, 
the source of the infection could not be determined.
Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
WHO collaborating laboratories in the United States are 
requested to submit a subset of their influenza-positive respira-
tory specimens to CDC for further virus characterization. CDC 
characterizes influenza viruses through one or more laboratory 
tests, including genome sequencing, hemagglutination inhibition, 
and neutralization assays. These data are used to monitor circu-
lating influenza viruses for early identification of viruses that are 
antigenically different from the recommended influenza vaccine 
reference viruses. Most viruses analyzed are propagated in mam-
malian cell cultures because viruses propagated in tissue culture

better represent viruses in circulation, and isolation rates of human 
influenza viruses are higher in mammalian cell cultures than in 
eggs, which is the substrate used for production of the majority 
of influenza vaccines (2,3). In addition, viruses are more likely to 
undergo adaptive changes when propagated in eggs. Antigenic 
and genetic characterization of circulating viruses is performed 
using both mammalian cell- and egg-propagated reference viruses.
Data obtained from antigenic characterization continue to be 
important in the assessment of the similarity between reference 
viruses and circulating viruses. Although vaccine effectiveness 
field studies must be conducted to determine how well a vaccine 
is working, these laboratory data are used to evaluate whether 
changes in the virus that could affect vaccine effectiveness might 
have occurred. Beginning with the 2014–15 season, a propor-
tion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses have not yielded sufficient 
hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization by hem-
agglutination inhibition. For nearly all viruses characterized at 
CDC laboratories, next-generation whole genome sequencing 
is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating 
viruses. For the subset of viruses that do not yield sufficient 
hemagglutination titers, antigenic properties are inferred using 
results obtained from viruses within the same genetic group as 
those that have been characterized antigenically.
CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 2,616 
influenza viruses collected and submitted by U.S. laboratories 
since October 1, 2015, including 997 influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses, 625 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 994 
influenza B viruses. Among the 997 influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses characterized, 996 (99.9%) were found to be 
antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009, the reference 
virus representing the influenza A(H1N1) component of the 
2015–16 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. One (0.1%) 
of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested showed a reduced titer to 
A/California/7/2009. Although all recent influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses belong to hemagglutinin (HA) genetic group 6B, 
two genetic subgroups, 6B.1 and 6B.2, have emerged, with the 
majority of U.S. viruses belonging to 6B.1. To date, however, 
viruses from these genetic subgroups remain antigenically similar 
to the A/California/7/2009 virus component in the vaccine.
All 625 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were genetically 
sequenced, and all viruses belonged to genetic groups for which 
a majority of viruses antigenically characterized were similar to 
cell-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, the reference 
virus representing the influenza A(H3N2) component of the 
2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. A subset of 318 influ-
enza A(H3N2) viruses also was antigenically characterized; 309 
of 318 (97.2%) were similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013.
A total of 548 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were charac-
terized, and all were found to be similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, 
the reference virus representing the influenza B/Yamagata-lineage 
component of the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and 
quadrivalent vaccines. A total of 446 influenza B/Victoria-lineage 
viruses were characterized, and 439 (98.4%) were found to be 
similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008, the reference virus representing 
the influenza B/Victoria-lineage component of the 2015–16 
Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccine. Seven (1.6%) of 
the B/Victoria-lineage viruses tested showed reduced titers to 
B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Antiviral Susceptibility of Influenza Viruses
Since October 1, 2015, a total of 2,408 influenza virus 
specimens have been tested for susceptibility to influ-
enza antiviral medications. All 1,188 influenza B viruses 
and 658 influenza A(H3N2) viruses tested were suscep-
tible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. Among 2,193 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested for susceptibility, 
18 (0.8%) were found to be resistant to oseltamivir and 
peramivir. All 1,127 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested 
were susceptible to zanamivir. High levels of resistance to the 
adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among 
influenza A viruses currently circulating globally; adamantanes 
are not effective against influenza B viruses. Adamantane drugs 
are not recommended for use against influenza at this time.
Composition of the 2016–17 Influenza Vaccine
The Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related 
Biological Products Advisory Committee has recommended 
that the 2016–17 influenza trivalent vaccines used in the United 
States contain an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like 
virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage). It is recom-
mended that quadrivalent vaccines, which have two influenza B 
viruses, contain the viruses recommended for the trivalent vac-
cines, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata 
lineage) (4). This represents a change in the influenza A(H3N2) 
component and a change in the influenza B lineage included in the 
trivalent vaccine compared with the composition of the 2015–16 
influenza vaccines. The vaccine viruses recommended for inclu-
sion in the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are 
the same vaccine viruses that were chosen for inclusion in 2016 
Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines. These vaccine 
recommendations were based on a number of factors, including 
global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic 
and antigenic characterization, antiviral susceptibility, and the 
availability of candidate vaccine viruses for production.

Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) exceeded 
the national baseline level§§ of 2.1% beginning the week ending 
December 26, 2015 (week 51) and remained at or above baseline 
for 17 consecutive weeks during the 2015–16 influenza season 
(Figure 3). The increase in the percentage of patient visits for 
ILI during weeks 51 and 52 (the weeks ending December 26, 
2015, and January 2, 2016) might have been influenced in part 
by a reduction in routine health care visits during the holidays, 
as has occurred during previous seasons. The peak percentage of 
outpatient visits for ILI was 3.6% and occurred during the week 
ending March 12, 2016 (week 10). During the 2001–02 through 
2014–15 seasons, peak weekly percentages of outpatient visits for 
ILI ranged from 2.4% to 7.7% and remained at or above baseline 
levels for an average of 13 weeks (range = 1–20 weeks).
ILINet data are used to produce a weekly jurisdiction-level 
measure of ILI activity,¶¶ ranging from minimal to high. The 
number of jurisdictions experiencing elevated ILI activity

† Data reported as of June 3, 2016.  
 
§§ The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for ILI 
during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation (noninfluenza weeks) 
for the previous three seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza 
weeks are defined as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks in which each week 
accounted for <2% of the season’s total number of specimens that tested 
positive for influenza. National and regional percentages of patient visits for 
ILI are weighted on the basis of state population. Use of the national baseline 
for regional data is not appropriate.
 
¶¶ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI outpatient 
visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, which corresponds to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics being at or below the average, to high, which corresponds to ILI activity 
from outpatient clinics being much higher than the average. Because the clinical 
definition of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, when 
combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides a clearer 
picture of influenza activity in the United States.

peaked during the week ending March 12, 2016 (week 10) 
when a total of 14 states, Puerto Rico, and New York City 
experienced high ILI activity. A total of 23 jurisdictions expe-
rienced high ILI activity during at least 1 week this season. 
The peak number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activ-
ity in a single week during the last six influenza seasons has 
ranged from four during the 2011–12 season to 45 during the 
2014–15 season.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
State and territorial epidemiologists report the geographic 
distribution of influenza in their jurisdictions through a weekly 
influenza activity code.*** The geographic distribution of 
influenza activity was most extensive during the week ending 
March 12, 2016 (week 10), when a total of 41 jurisdictions 
reported influenza activity as widespread. During the previous 
six seasons, the peak number of jurisdictions reporting wide-
spread activity ranged from 20 during the 2011–12 season to 
49 during the 2010–11 season.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-
confirmed influenza virus infections using the FluSurv-
NET††† surveillance system. Cumulative hospitalization 
rates per 100,000 population were calculated by age group 
based on 8,646 total hospitalizations resulting from influenza 
during October 1, 2015–April 30, 2016. The cumulative 
incidence§§§ for all age groups was 31.3 per 100,000 popu-
lation. The cumulative hospitalization rates by age group 
for this period were 41.8 (0–4 years), 9.7 (5–17 years), 16.8 
(18–49 years), 45.2 (50–64 years), and 84.8 (≥65 years) 
(Figure 4).  During the past five influenza seasons, age-specific 
hospitalization rates ranged from 16.0 to 67.0 (0–4 years), 
4.0 to 16.6 (5–17 years), 4.1 to 21.4 (18–49 years), 8.1 to 
53.7 (50–64 years), and 30.2 to 308.5 (≥65 years).
Among all hospitalizations, 6,462 (74.5%) were associated 
with influenza A, 2,131 (24.6%) with influenza B, and 45 
(0.5%) with influenza A and B coinfection; 37 (0.4%) had no 
virus type information. Among those with influenza A subtype 
information, 2,441 (88.7%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 
and 310 (11.3%) were influenza A(H3N2) virus.
Among cases reported as of June 3, 2016, of FluSurv-NET 
adult patients for whom medical chart data were available, 
91.8% had at least one reported underlying medical condi-
tion; the most frequently reported underlying conditions 
were obesity (41.8%), cardiovascular disease (39.6%), and 
metabolic disorders (38.4%). Among children hospitalized 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza and for whom medical 
chart data were available, 47.5% had at least one under-
lying medical condition. The most commonly reported 
underlying medical conditions were asthma or reactive 
airway disease (21.7%) and neurologic disorders (18.3%). 
Among the 377 hospitalized women of childbearing age 
(15–44 years) who had laboratory-confirmed influenza, 83 
(22.0%) were pregnant.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Associated Mortality
During the 2015–16 influenza season, based on data 
from CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System,¶¶¶ the proportion of deaths attributed to 
 *** Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with 
no increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, 
with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no 
greater than sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in more than 
two, but less than half of the regions in the state with recent laboratory 
evidence of influenza in those regions; 5) widespread: increased ILI activity 
or institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in at least 
half the regions in the state, with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in 
the state.
 ††† FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among children aged 
<18 years (since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years 
(since the 2005–06 influenza season). FluSurv-NET covers approximately 
70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New 
York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza Hospitalization 
Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 2009–10 season 
to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites 
included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota during the 
2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and 
Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during the 
2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16 seasons.
 §§§ Incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National Center for Health 
Statistics population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance 
catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered 
influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is underutilized because of 
the poor reliability of rapid influenza diagnostic test results and greater 
reliance on clinical diagnosis for influenza. As a consequence, the number 
of cases identified as part of influenza hospitalization surveillance likely is 
an underestimate of the actual number of persons hospitalized with influenza.
 ¶¶¶ Pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–associated deaths are tracked through two 
systems, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality 
Surveillance System, which reports the week the death occurred, and the 
122 Cities Mortality Reporting System, which reports the week that the 
death certificate was registered. Because of these differences in reporting, the 
two data sources produce different percentages. Beginning with the 2015–16 
influenza season, the NCHS Mortality Surveillance System has been the 
principal component of the U.S. Mortality Surveillance System.

* FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among children aged <18 years (since the 
2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years (since the 2005–06 influenza season). FluSurv-NET covers approximately 70 counties in the 10 Emerging 
Infections Program states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites 
included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Utah during the 
2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah during the 2012–13 season; and 
Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during the 2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16 seasons.
† Data reported as of June 3, 2016.  
 **** The seasonal baseline proportion of P&I deaths is projected using a robust 
regression procedure, in which a periodic regression model is applied to the 
observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were reported by the National 
Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System and the 122 Cities 
Mortality Reporting System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic 
threshold is set at 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline. Users 
of the data should not expect the NCHS mortality surveillance data and the 
122 Cities Mortality Reporting System to produce the same percentages, and 
the percent P&I deaths from each system should be compared with the 
corresponding system specific baselines and thresholds.

Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
For the 2015–16 influenza season, as of June 3, 2016, a total 
of 74 laboratory-confirmed, influenza-associated pediatric 
deaths had been reported from Puerto Rico, the District of 
Columbia, and 31 states. The deaths occurred in children aged 
2 months–16 years; mean and median ages were 7.0 years and 
6.0 years, respectively. Among the 74 deaths, 29 were associ-
ated with an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, three 
were associated with an influenza A(H3N2) virus infection, 
17 were associated with an influenza A virus infection for 
which no subtyping was performed, 23 were associated with 
an influenza B virus infection, and two were associated with an 
influenza virus infection for which type was not determined.
Since influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a 
nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths has ranged from 37 to 171 
per season; this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pedi-
atric deaths occurring during April 15, 2009–October 2, 2010 
were reported to CDC. The number of influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths reported during the 2015–16 influenza season 
was lower than the number reported for each of the three pre-
ceding influenza seasons (171 in 2012–13, 111 in 2013–14, 
and 148 in 2014–15).
Discussion
The 2015–16 influenza season peaked in mid-March, 
somewhat later than usual. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
predominated overall, but influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B 
viruses also circulated. The season was less severe overall com-
pared with the preceding three seasons, including 2013–14, 
the last influenza season when influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
was the predominant virus. Whereas influenza A(H3N2)–
predominant seasons are typically more severe overall than 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09–predominant seasons, and are 
especially severe among the elderly and the very young, influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been associated with severe 
illness in younger adults since the virus emerged during the 
2009 pandemic, when mortality rates were highest in adults 
aged 50–64 years, and again during the 2013–14 season, when 
adults aged <65 years were at high risk for severe influenza ill-
ness (5). For this season, and the 2013–14 season, cumulative 
hospitalization rates for adults aged 50–64 years were 45.2 
and 53.7 per 100,000 population, respectively, demonstrating 
that although some age groups are at high risk for developing 
influenza-related complications every year (6), influenza can 
cause severe illness in persons of any age, including adults 
aged 50–64 years.
Testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for 
novel influenza A virus infections should continue through-
out the summer. Although summer influenza activity in the 
United States typically is low, influenza cases and outbreaks 
have occurred during summer months, and clinicians should 
remain vigilant in considering influenza in the differential 
diagnosis of summer respiratory illnesses. Health care providers 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. Substantial influenza activity 
generally begins in the fall and continues through the winter 
and spring months. However, the timing and severity of 
influenza activity varies by geographic location and season.
What is added by this report?
The 2015–16 influenza season was less severe overall compared 
with the preceding three seasons. The cumulative hospitaliza-
tion rate for all ages of 31.3 per 100,000 population was lower 
than those for the previous three seasons (64.1 in 2014–15, 35.1 
in 2013–14, and 44.0 in 2012–13), and the number of influenza-
associated pediatric deaths (74) also was lower compared with 
previous seasons (148 in 2014–15, 111 in 2013–14, and 171 in 
2012–13). Influenza activity began later and continued for a 
longer period, peaking in mid-March. During the most recent 18 
influenza seasons, only two other seasons have peaked in 
March (2011–12 and 2005–06). Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses predominated during the 2015–16 influenza season, 
with influenza B viruses, and to a lesser extent, influenza A 
(H3N2) viruses cocirculating. Antigenic and genetic character-
ization showed that most circulating viruses were well-matched 
to the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Influenza surveillance, including for novel influenza viruses, 
should continue throughout the summer months, and health 
care providers should consider influenza as a cause of respiratory 
illness even outside the typical season. Although influenza 
viruses typically circulate at low levels during the summer 
months, antiviral treatment is recommended for all patients with 
confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, 
or progressive influenza-like illness; those who require hospital-
ization; and those at higher risk for influenza-related complica-
tions, including adults aged ≥65 years. These medications work 
best when administered early in the course of illness.

also are reminded to consider novel influenza virus infections 
in persons with ILI, with swine or poultry exposure, or with 
severe acute respiratory infection after travel to areas where 
avian influenza viruses have been detected, especially if there 
was recent close contact with animals such as wild birds, poul-
try, or pigs. Providers should alert the local and state public 
health department if a human infection with a novel influenza 
virus infection is suspected.
Although vaccination is the best method for preventing and 
reducing the impact of influenza, prompt treatment with influenza 
antiviral medications remains an important adjunct for lessen-
ing both the severity and duration of influenza (7–9). Patients 
with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe illness, 
require hospitalization, or are at high risk for influenza-related 
complications should be treated with antivirals as soon as possible. 
T
reatment of severely ill patients or those at high risk should not 
be delayed or withheld pending confirmatory influenza test results 
because early treatment is most effective and rapid antigen detec-
tion influenza diagnostic tests can be insensitive (7–9).
