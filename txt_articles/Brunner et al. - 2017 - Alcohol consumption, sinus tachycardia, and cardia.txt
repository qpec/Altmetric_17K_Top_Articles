Aims
Alcohol is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias. Retrospective analyses suggest supraventricular arrhythmias con-
secutive to acute alcohol consumption, but prospective data are limited. We intended to prospectively associate
acute alcohol consumption with cardiac arrhythmias.

Methods
and results
At the 2015 Munich Octoberfest, we enrolled 3028 voluntary participants who received a smartphone-based ECG
and breath alcohol concentration (BAC) measurements. ECGs were analysed for cardiac arrhythmias (sinus tachy-
cardia, sinus arrhythmia, premature atrial/ventricular complexes, atrial fibrillation/flutter) and respiratory sinus ar-
rhythmia. By multivariable adjusted logistic regression we associated BACs with cardiac arrhythmias. Similarly, we
analysed 4131 participants of the community-based KORA S4 Study (Co-operative Health Research in the Region
of Augsburg) and associated cardiac arrhythmias with chronic alcohol consumption. In our acute alcohol cohort
(mean age 34.4 ± 13.3 years, 29% women), mean BAC was 0.85 ± 0.54 g/kg. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in 30.5%
(sinus tachycardia 25.9%; other arrhythmia subtypes 5.4%). Breath alcohol concentration was significantly associated
with cardiac arrhythmias overall (odds ratio (OR) per 1-unit change 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50–2.05;
P < 0.001) and sinus tachycardia in particular (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.66–2.31; P < 0.001). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia
measuring autonomic tone was significantly reduced under the influence of alcohol. In KORA S4, chronic alcohol
consumption was associated with sinus tachycardia (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.06; P = 0.006).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Acute alcohol consumption is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sinus tachycardia in particular. This partly re-
flects autonomic imbalance as assessed by significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Such imbalance might
lead to sympathetically triggered atrial fibrillation resembling the holiday heart syndrome.

Introduction
Acute and chronic alcohol intake result in desirable and undesirable
health effects.1 Modest recreational alcohol consumption may lead
to perceived wellbeing,2 beyond moderate intake confers the risk of
adverse outcomes. Common symptoms of acute alcohol consump-
tion are disorientation, disinhibition, nausea, and
vomiting.3,4
Excessive acute abuse may lead to death.5 Chronic consumption has
been ascribed cardio-protective effects.6 More commonly, chronic
alcohol use dose-dependently is associated with detrimental effects
including substance addiction and severe nutritional, hepatic, neuro-
logical and social consequences.7
From a cardiovascular perspective, acute excessive alcohol con-
sumption has been associated with the so called ‘Holiday Heart
Syndrome’.8 This syndrome affects individuals without a specific car-
diac history resulting in both ventricular and supraventricular arrhyth-
mias, predominantly atrial fibrillation.8,9 Small case series confirmed a
relation between alcohol use and atrial fibrillation.10,11 Regarding
chronic alcohol consumption, population-based studies reported a
dose-response effect on the development of atrial fibrillation.12
Many open questions remain. All reports on effects of acute alco-
hol intake were derived from small retrospective analyses with rela-
tions to arrhythmias as secondary findings. In our study, we thus
intended to conduct a large, sufficiently powered, observational,
cross-sectional analysis of cardiac arrhythmia prevalence in partici-
pants with quantitatively measured acute alcohol intake. Investigating
visitors of the 2015 Munich Octoberfest, we hypothesized that
increased breath alcohol concentration (BAC) is associated with a
higher burden of cardiac arrhythmias. To parallel acute with chronic
alcohol use, we studied participants of the community-based KORA
Study.
Methods
Study cohorts
For the analysis of BAC and arrhythmia prevalence, we designed an ob-
servational, cross-sectional cohort study and recruited voluntary visitors
at the annual Octoberfest in Munich, Germany between September and
October 2015 (acute alcohol cohort). Participants had to be >
_18 years of
age and provide written informed consent to study inclusion. We
screened and consented 3042 individuals. After exclusion of individuals
with a BAC >
_3.00g/kg (n = 4) and individuals with uninterpretable elec-
trocardiogram (ECG) recordings (n = 8), the final study cohort com-
prised 3028 participants. Individuals with
a BAC >
_ 3.00g/kg
are
considered disabled due to intoxication according to German law, and
must not be consented. The ethics committee at the Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany approved the study, which was registered
at clinicaltrials.org (NCT02550340).
To assess chronic alcohol consumption on arrhythmia prevalence, we
investigated participants of the Survey S4 of the community-based Co-
operative Health Research in the region of Augsburg Study (KORA S4,
chronic alcohol cohort).13 Study participants were identified through the
registration office. Ten strata of equal size according to sex and age com-
prised 4261 individuals; after exclusion of those without (n = 95) or with
uninterpretable (n = 17) ECGs, or without information on alcohol con-
sumption (n = 18), the final cohort consisted of 4131 individuals. The eth-
ics committee of the Bavarian Medical Association approved the study.
Electrocardiogram recordings
In the acute alcohol cohort, 30s ECG recordings were obtained using the
smart phone based AliveCor device (AliveCor, San Francisco, CA, USA).
A two-electrode hardware extension wirelessly communicating with a
software application was held with both hands by the participant, resem-
bling a lead I ECG.
In KORA S4, digital 10s 12-lead ECGs were obtained using the
Hannover ECG System version 3.22-12 (HES, Corscience, Erlangen,
Germany). ECGs were recorded after 10min rest in supine position.
Electrocardiogram analysis was performed in parallel by two senior car-
diologists blinded to BAC, chronic alcohol consumption levels, or clinical
covariates. Discrepant findings were resolved by consent. Assessment of
arrhythmias employed a standardized coding scheme. Arrhythmias were
classified as sinus tachycardia (heart rate>100 b.p.m.), sinus arrhythmia,
premature atrial complex, premature ventricular complex, and atrial fibril-
lation or flutter. We further assessed all ECGs for respiratory sinus ar-
rhythmia as a measure of autonomic tone. For this, we modified the
previously described respiratory sinus arrhythmia bedside test.14 Per 30s
ECG recording, we measured RR intervals with a scaled caliper, neglecting
RR intervals before and after premature beats, and determined the short-
est, longest, and mean RR interval of each participant. We considered re-
spiratory sinus arrhythmia present, when the absolute difference of the
shortest and longest RR interval was>
_20% of the mean RR interval
duration.
Alcohol assessment
In the acute alcohol cohort, BAC was determined using a Dr€
ager
Alcotest 7510 handheld device (Dr€
agerwerk AG, Lu
¨beck, Germany).
The device accounts for remaining oral alcohol. To further reduce influ-
ence of the latter, BAC was obtained at the end of participant recruit-
ment, when individuals had not ingested alcohol for several minutes.
Alcohol was measured in gram per kilogram (g/kg). In KORA S4, chronic
alcohol consumption was assessed in gram alcohol per day (g/d), sur-
veyed using the validated 7-day-recall method.15
Clinical covariates
In our acute alcohol cohort, assessment of clinical covariates was re-
stricted by the study setting and the aim to maintain participant privacy.
We were thus limited to survey self-reported age, sex, country of origin,
history of heart disease, use of cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic drugs,
and active smoking status.
In KORA S4, participants underwent a standardized interview and
examination.13 We used information on age, sex, hypertension, smoking
status, history of angina, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and
stroke, as well as the use of cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic
medication.
Statistical considerations
We express categorical variables as frequency (percentage). Continuous
data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (25th;75th
percentile) as appropriate. We applied logistic regression models to as-
sess the relation of alcohol as predictor on the primary and secondary
outcomes of arrhythmia prevalence, adjusted for age and sex or in add-
ition for the remaining available covariates. Odds ratios are provided per
unit (i.e. 1 g/kg) increase of BAC. Arrhythmia prevalence across quartiles
of BAC was compared by v2 tests for trend. Primary outcome was the
occurrence of any arrhythmia including sinus arrhythmia, sinus tachycar-
dia, premature atrial complex, premature ventricular complex, and atrial
fibrillation or flutter. Secondary outcomes were arrhythmia subtype sep-
arately or combinations thereof. Another secondary outcome in our
acute alcohol cohort was the presence of respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

For sensitivity analyses to adjudicate the influence of alcohol consumption
on the baseline prevalence of sinus tachycardia, we selected a subgroup
of participants from our acute alcohol cohort with no exposure to acute
alcohol consumption (BAC 0 g/kg). Similarly, in KORA S4 we selected
participants without chronic alcohol use. In these sensitivity analyses, we
determined the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias as detailed above.
Finally, we assessed interaction with sex by adding multiplicative inter-
action terms (sex*BAC) to our models.
For sample size calculations in the acute alcohol cohort, we assumed a
1% prevalence of arrhythmias in the general population assessed by a 10s
ECG. In our 30s recordings, we assumed a 1.5% prevalence in those
under no or low influence of alcohol (<0.5 g/kg). For the group under
intermediate (>
_0.5–<1.5 g/kg) and high (>
_1.5 g/kg) influence, we assumed
an odds of 2 and 4 for the prevalence of arrhythmias, respectively. For
85% power with a two-sided a-level set at 5%, we required 2754 partici-
pants. To account for a 10% drop-out rate, we aimed at 3029 enrolled
individuals.
Results
During all 16 days of the 2015 Munich Octoberfest we included 3028
participants for analysis. Their mean age was 34.7 ± 13.3 years, 905
(29.9%) were women (Table 1). Reflecting the international attend-
ance, individuals originated from 60 different countries, whereas the
majority of 69% was from Germany.
The KORA S4 cohort consisted of 4131 individuals with a mean
age of 49.1 ± 13.9 years and 2110 (51.1%) females (Table 1). Owing
to the study composition,>99.5% were of German descent.
In the acute alcohol cohort, the mean BAC was 0.85± 0.54g/kg
(range 0–2.94g/kg). Generally, men had a higher BAC compared to
women. Across quartiles of age, the highest BAC was found in the
2nd quartile (25–30 years of age, Figure 1A). We noted limited day-
by-day variation, tending to higher BAC measurements towards the
weekends (Figure 1C). The circadian distribution confirmed a constant
rise in BAC toward the closing hour of each day. A slight decline in
the afternoon likely reflects a partial exchange of visitors due to seat
reservation time slots (Figure 1D).
The mean chronic consumption of alcohol in KORA S4 was
15.8 ± 21.4 g/d. On average, men consumed nearly three time as
much alcohol as women. The highest chronic alcohol consumption
was observed in the 3rd age quartile (37–48 years of age, Figure 1B).
The quality of ECG recordings in our acute alcohol cohort was
high, despite disadvantageous recording conditions. Only eight ECGs
were uninterpretable. Examples of encountered arrhythmias are pre-
sented in Figure 2A–E. In the acute alcohol cohort, the primary out-
come of any arrhythmia occurred in 30.5%. Thereby, sinus
tachycardia was most common and affected 25.9% of participants.
The combined prevalence of other arrhythmias was 5.4%, including
sinus arrhythmia, premature atrial and ventricular complexes, and
atrial fibrillation or flutter. The secondary outcome of respiratory
sinus arrhythmia as a qualitative measure of autonomic tone was
noted in 22.2% of participants (Table 2).
In comparison, arrhythmias occurred less frequently in KORA S4.
Only 2.7% of the participants met the primary outcome, at which
0.4% had sinus tachycardia and 2.3% presented with sinus arrhythmia,
premature atrial and ventricular complexes, and atrial fibrillation or
flutter (Table 2).
In our sensitivity analysis of study participants with 0 g/kg BAC in
the acute alcohol cohort, the primary outcome of any arrhythmia
occurred in 23.9%, and sinus tachycardia occurred in 18.5%. In those
without alcohol use in the chronic alcohol cohort, prevalence of any
arrhythmia was 2.5% and of sinus tachycardia was 0.4%.
For our primary outcome (sinus tachycardia; sinus arrhythmia; pre-
mature atrial and ventricular complexes; atrial fibrillation or flutter), we
identified a robust association with higher BAC in our acute alcohol co-
hort. Analysis by arrhythmia subtype revealed that this association was
driven by sinus tachycardia, both after age and sex, and after multivari-
able adjustment. (Table 3) Across quartiles of BAC in the overall and
sex-stratified cohort, we found increasing prevalences of any arrhyth-
mia and sinus tachycardia, respectively (Figure 2F and G). In sex-
stratified analyses, the effect of BAC on sinus tachycardia was similar in
males and females, both after adjustment for age (males: OR 2.12 (95%
CI 1.75–2.58), P< 0.001; females: OR 2.02 (95% CI 1.51–2.69),
P< 0.001) and after multivariable adjustment (males: OR 2.00 (95% CI

We also noted a significant inverse association of respiratory sinus ar-
rhythmia with BAC (Table 3). Interaction analyses did not suggest inter-
action between sex and BAC.
In KORA S4, we confirmed an association between sinus tachycar-
dia and chronic alcohol consumption. Yet, the associated effect size
was remarkably smaller than with acute alcohol consumption. No as-
sociations with chronic alcohol consumption were found for other
arrhythmias or a combination of sinus tachycardia with other arrhyth-
mia subtypes (Table 3).
Discussion
In our observational, cross-sectional acute alcohol cohort, we have
recruited over 3000 participants with quantitatively measured acute
alcohol consumption. Each participant received a 30 s ECG for ar-
rhythmia analysis. Our main finding was a significant association of
sinus tachycardia with acute alcohol intake, occurring in 25.9% of indi-
viduals. We also confirmed this association with chronic alcohol con-
sumption in the community-based cohort KORA study. In the acute
alcohol cohort, respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a marker of balanced
autonomic tone was more common in those exposed to less alcohol.
The Octoberfest is a traditional public festival in the city of Munich,
Germany that is celebrated annually since 1810. It has gained strong
international recognition and is renowned for serving Munich-
brewed beer. Numerous visitors attend the festival primarily for the
purpose of beer consumption. In 2015, 5.9 million visitors frequented
the Octoberfest and consumed 7.5 million liters of beer. We thus
considered the setting most suitable for conducting our acute alcohol
study. We anticipated that by recruiting participants during all 16
days of the festival, we would be able to enrol a sufficient number of
individuals presenting with a continuously distributed range of BAC.
With an average BAC of 0.85 g/kg (range: 0–2.94g/kg) we clearly
achieved this goal. The modest day-by-day and circadian variabilities
of BAC support the robustness of our results. The lively atmosphere
in a beer tent deviated from AliveCor manufacturer recommenda-
tions for ECG recording. Despite adverse recording conditions, with-
>99.5% interpretable readings the obtained ECG quality was very
high.
We conservatively based sample size considerations on an esti-
mated 1.5% prevalence of any arrhythmia under no acute influence of
alcohol and at rest. Even without considering sinus tachycardia, we
detected arrhythmias in 2.3% of our chronic and in 5.4% of our acute
alcohol cohorts. We thus submit that we present sufficiently pow-
ered results. In our acute alcohol cohort, we found a strong and

robust association of increased BAC with sinus tachycardia in particu-
lar. We were not able to associate increased BAC with other ar-
rhythmia subtypes and specifically atrial fibrillation. This is despite
prior reports that repeatedly suggested such a relation coining the
term ‘holiday heart syndrome’.8 It is notable that so far studies have
considered patients presenting with atrial fibrillation and have then
retrospectively identified recent acute alcohol consumption as a
presumed cause.8–10 Ours is the first large and prospective investiga-
tion to systematically analyse the immediate occurrence of arrhyth-
mias under the influence of acute alcohol intake. We thus conclude
that acute alcohol consumption leads to increased arrhythmia preva-
lence overall, with sinus tachycardia as the immediate main effect.
For chronic alcohol consumption, prior results are more equivo-
cal. Based on large community-based studies, modest use does not

appear to be a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation.16 Only long-
term use in the Framingham Heart Study and beyond moderate use
(>35 standard drinks per week) in the Copenhagen City Heart Study
resulted in an increased risk for atrial fibrillation.12,17 Along these find-
ings, in our own community-based analysis of low to moderate
chronic alcohol consumption with less than 20g/d on average, we did
not find an association with an increased arrhythmia prevalence.
A main result of our study is the profound association of acute al-
cohol consumption with sinus tachycardia. As demonstrated in our
sensitivity analysis, it is intuitive to assume that participants of a festi-
val present with significantly higher rates of sinus tachycardia than
under resting conditions. However, sinus tachycardia occurred al-
most 30% more often in Octoberfest participants under the influence
of alcohol compared with those without alcohol consumption.
Furthermore, the association of sinus tachycardia with higher BAC
remained even after accounting for confounders. Although less pro-
nounced, also in KORA S4 increased chronic alcohol consumption
was associated with sinus tachycardia.
Whereas ours is the largest prospective analysis to describe the as-
sociation of acute alcohol consumption and sinus tachycardia under
real life conditions, the relation has previously been noted. Prior stud-
ies have reported an increase in heart rate following alcohol intake in
experimental settings.18–21 Consistently, these studies have identified
alcohol induced alterations of the autonomic nervous system to ele-
vate heart rate. Thereby, both an increase in sympathetic activity18,21
and a decrease in vagal tone19,20 have been described. Respiratory
sinus arrhythmia is a simple measure of cardiac vagal tone and auto-
nomic balance.22 In our acute alcohol cohort, participants with
increased BAC presented with a significantly reduced prevalence of
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This finding concurs with the interpret-
ation that the observed alcohol induced increase in heart rate is the
consequence of changes in autonomic balance. Autonomic imbalance
is strongly predisposing to the development of atrial fibrillation.23,24
Alcohol induced autonomic imbalance could thus hypothetically be a
link to the later development of atrial fibrillation. Possibly, the short
duration of our ECG recordings immediately during acute alcohol ex-
position resulted in an underestimation of alcohol induced cardiac ar-
rhythmias and atrial fibrillation in particular. These considerations ask
for additional research including longer ECG recordings during
follow-up of hours and days after acute alcohol consumption.
A number of considerations are warranted when interpreting our
study. Given the public environment of our study, we were restricted
in assessing personal questions and conducting physical examinations.
Hence, several possible confounding factors remained unaddressed,
including but not limited to the amount of alcohol consumption prior
to BAC measurement, the participants’ common alcohol consump-
tion behaviour, their use of recreational drugs, or their usual physical
activity. A single 30 s ECG recording prevented the investigation of
temporal relations between alcohol consumption and arrhythmia oc-
currence. Importantly, we cannot comment on the relevance of base-
line heart rate prior to alcohol intake. We were thus only able to
assess the prevalence but not the incidence of arrhythmias during
follow-up. Future studies with longer ECG recordings will need to fill
this gap. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia only partially reflects the influ-
ence of autonomic tone on heart rate variability. Additional research
is warranted to investigate more elaborate measures of autonomic
tone in relation to alcohol consumption. Due to our exclusion crite-
ria, we were not able to study severely intoxicated individuals
(BAC>
_3.00 g/kg). In KORA S4, chronic alcohol consumption was ra-
ther low compared with other community-based cohorts. We might
thus have underestimated arrhythmia prevalence secondary to long-
term alcohol use. Information on chronic alcohol consumption in our
acute alcohol cohort was unavailable.
In conclusion, we have conducted a large prospective analysis of
acute alcohol consumption on ECG-assessed cardiac arrhythmias.
We thereby report good technical feasibility of ECG screening even

under lively conditions at the Munich Octoberfest. Acute and—to a
lesser extent—chronic alcohol consumption were associated with
sinus tachycardia. Analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a meas-
ure of autonomic tone suggested that acute alcohol intake confers
autonomic imbalance. Additional research is warranted to investigate
if autonomic imbalance constitutes the link between sinus tachycardia
and the occurrence of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, as implicated
by reports of the so-called ‘Holiday Heart Syndrome’ (Figure 3).
