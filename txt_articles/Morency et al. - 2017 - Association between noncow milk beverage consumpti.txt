ABSTRACT
Background: Cow milk consumption in childhood has been asso-
ciated with increased height, which is an important measure of chil-
dren’s growth and development. Many parents are choosing noncow
milk beverages such as soy and almond milk because of perceived
health benefits. However, noncow milk contains less protein and fat
than cow milk and may not have the same effect on height.
Objective: We sought to determine whether there is an association
between noncow milk consumption and lower height in childhood
and assess whether cow milk consumption mediates the relation
between noncow milk consumption and height.
Design: This was a cross-sectional study of 5034 healthy Canadian
children aged 24–72 mo enrolled in the Applied Research Group for
Kids cohort. The primary exposure was the volume of noncow milk
consumption (number of 250-mL cups per day). The primary out-
come was height, which was measured as height-for-age z score.
Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the association
between noncow milk consumption and height. A mediation analysis
was conducted to explore whether cow milk consumption mediated
the association between noncow milk consumption and height.
Results: There was a dose-dependent association between higher
noncow milk consumption and lower height (P , 0.0001). For each
daily cup of noncow milk consumed, children were 0.4 cm (95% CI:
0.2, 0.8 cm) shorter. In the mediation analysis, lower cow milk
consumption only partially mediated the association between non-
cow milk consumption and lower height. The height difference for a
child aged 3 y consuming 3 cups noncow milk/d relative to 3 cups
cow milk/d was 1.5 cm (95% CI: 0.8, 2.0 cm).
Conclusions: Noncow milk consumption was associated with lower
childhood height. Future research is needed to understand the causal
relations between noncow milk consumption and height.

INTRODUCTION
Height is an important indicator of children’s overall nutri-
tional status, health, and development (1–3). Cow milk is a
staple for most North American children and is an important
source of dietary protein and fat—2 essential nutrients for op-
timal growth (4–8). A meta-analysis of intervention studies in-
dicated that children who consumed cow milk daily were taller
than those who did not (9). Milk proteins (i.e., casein and whey)
and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in cow milk have been
proposed to contribute to gains in linear growth (5, 8, 10, 11).
Many parents are replacing cow milk with noncow milk
beverages such as soy, rice, or almond milk, possibly because of
perceived health benefits (12–18). Lee et al. (19) identified that
12% of urban Canadian children consumed noncow milk bev-
erages. However, noncow milk contains different proteins than
cow milk and lacks IGF-1, suggesting that it may not have the
same effect on height as cow milk (20–22).
Furthermore, unlike cow milk, there are no legislative re-
quirements for standardizing the nutritional content of noncow
milk under the FDA or the Food and Drug Regulations of Canada
(23, 24). The protein and fat content of noncow milk beverages is
highly variable. Children who consume noncow milk may receive
less dietary protein and fat than children who consume cow milk
(25). Understanding the relation between noncow milk con-
sumption and height in childhood may help inform parents,
clinicians, and policymakers when choosing the optimal type of
milk for children.
We hypothesized that noncow milk consumption in childhood
may be associated with lower childhood height. The primary
objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the
daily volume of noncow milk consumption and height in
childhood. The secondary objective was to explore whether an

 association between noncow milk consumption and lower height
is mediated through lower cow milk consumption.
METHODS
Study design
We conducted a cross-sectional observational study through
the TARGet Kids! (Applied Research Group for Kids) primary
care practice–based research network. TARGet Kids! is a part-
nership between child health researchers and primary care
physicians from the University of Toronto.
Children aged 24–72 mo attending their annual well-child
visits were recruited from 9 family and pediatric primary
health care practices in Toronto, Canada, from December 2008
to September 2015 (26). Children were excluded from the
TARGetKids! cohort if they had a known condition affecting
growth, chronic illnesses (excluding asthma), or severe de-
velopmental delay (Figure 1).
Exposures and outcomes
All questionnaires and physical measurements were collected
by trained research assistants at each primary care practice with
the use of standardized protocols. The primary exposure was the
daily volume of noncow milk consumed (number of 250-mL cups
per day), which was obtained from the following question
adapted from the Canadian Community Health Survey (27): How
many 250-mL cups of noncow milk (soy, rice, goat, etc.) does
your child have in a typical day? The suspected mediator was the
daily volume of cow milk consumed (number of 250-mL cups per
day), which was obtained from the following question: How many
250-mL cups of cow milk does your child have in a typical day?
The primary outcome was height-for-age z score. Height was
measured with the use of a calibrated stadiometer for children
aged $2 y (seca model 703; measurement accuracy: 60.025%).
The WHO growth standards were used to calculate the height-
for-age z score. This growth standard was used because it is
believed to represent optimal growth in children (28, 29).
Potential confounders that might influence the relation be-
tween the volume of noncow milk consumption and height-for-
age z score were generated from a review of the literature and
included age, sex, BMI (in kg/m2) z score, maternal ethnicity,
income, and maternal height. Child age and sex were collected
from parental reports. Weight was measured with the use of a
precision digital scale for children aged $2 y (seca model 703;
measurement accuracy 60.025%). BMI z scores were calculated
with the use of WHO Anthro version 3.2.2 (29). Neighborhood

 income was used as an indicator for socioeconomic status and
was obtained from the median after-tax neighborhood household
income identified by each participant’s 6-digit postal code (with
the use of the Statistics Canada Postal Code Conversion File and
data from the 2006 Canadian census). Maternal height was
measured with the use of a stadiometer (seca model 703; mea-
surement accuracy: 60.025%). Maternal ethnicity was catego-
rized as European, Asian, African, mixed, or other (30).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, SD, and fre-
quencies, were used to describe the primary exposure, outcome,
and covariates (Table 1). Biologically implausible values for the
primary outcome were removed from the analysis according to
WHO recommendations (height-for-age z score #26 or $6)
(29). Univariate linear regression was used to test the unadjusted
relation between the daily volume of noncow milk consumed
and height-for-age z score.
For the primary analysis, multivariable linear regression was
used to adjust for potentially confounding factors identified in the
literature as being associated with our primary outcome and
exposure. These included age, sex, ethnicity, neighborhood
income, BMI z score, and maternal height. All covariates re-
mained in the final model regardless of statistical significance
(31).
For our secondary analysis we conducted a mediation analysis
to explore whether the daily volume of cow milk consumption
was a mediator of the relation between noncow milk consumption
and height. This approach consisted of 4 different regression
models (Figure 2). The indirect effect was calculated as the
difference between the regression coefficients of the direct effect
(adjusted for cow milk) and the total effect (not adjusted for cow
milk) (32). The indirect effect represented the mediating effect
of cow milk on the relation between noncow milk consumption
and height. Bootstrap sampling (10,000 repetitions) was used to
estimate a P value for the mediation effect (33–35).
Missing data for the primary outcome, primary exposure, and
all covariates were ,1%, 16%, and ,10%, respectively, and the
data were assumed to be missing at random. With the use of
multiple imputation by chained equations, 50 different data sets
were imputed and pooled together to form one complete data set
(36). All imputations and analyses were conducted in R version
3.2.3 (37).
To assess the effect of multiple imputation on the results, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted by repeating the primary
analysis with the use of only nonimputed data. A second sen-
sitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of paternal
height on the results by repeating the primary analysis on 827
subjects with paternal height data available.
Ethics
The research ethics boards at the Hospital for Sick Children
and St. Michael’s Hospital approved this study. Written consent
was obtained by the parents of all participating children.
RESULTS
A total of 5048 children who met inclusion criteria and had
parental consent were included in the study. Of these children,

NONCOW MILK CONSUMPTION AND CHILDHOOD HEIGHT

 14 were outliers for the primary outcome and were thus excluded
(Figure 1). Characteristics for children consuming cow milk and
noncow milk are provided in Table 1. Participants were a mean 6
SD age of 38 6 14 mo, and 51% were males. Maternal ethnicity
was primarily European (70%), and children were largely from
medium- to high-income households. In total, 92% and 13% of
the children consumed cow milk and noncow milk daily, re-
spectively. Children who consumed cow milk had a mean 6 SD
of 2.0 6 1.0 cups/d, whereas children who consumed noncow
milk had a mean 6 SD of 1.4 6 1.0 cups/d. Children consuming
each type of milk appeared similar (Table 1).
In both the univariate and primary multivariate analyses there
was a dose-dependent association between higher noncow milk
consumption and lower height. Each daily cup of noncow milk
consumed was associated with a 0.1-lower height-for-age z score
(95% CI: 0.05, 0.2; P , 0.001) or 0.4-cm lower height/cup
(95% CI: 0.2, 0.8 cm) for children aged 3 y (Table 2). The height
difference between children aged 3 y who drank 0 cups noncow
milk/d relative to 3 cups/d was 0.3 height-for-age z-score units
(95% CI: 0.1, 0.5) or 1.2 cm (95% CI: 0.4, 1.8 cm).
In the secondary mediation analysis there was a 0.5-cup lower
daily cow milk intake (95% CI: 0.5, 0.6 cups; P , 0.001) for
each daily cup of noncow milk consumed. Each cup of cow
milk was associated with a 0.05 higher height-for-age z score
(95% CI: 0.02, 0.08; P , 0.001) or 0.2-cm higher height per cup
(95% CI: 0.08, 0.3 cm) for children aged 3 y. When adjusted for
cow milk consumption, noncow milk consumption remained neg-
atively associated with height [0.08 lower height-for-age z score
(95% CI: 0.03, 0.1; P , 0.001) or 0.3-cm lower height/cup
(95% CI: 0.1, 0.4 cm) of noncow milk for children aged 3 y]
(Figure 2, Table 3). Cow milk consumption partially mediated
the association between noncow milk and height. A 0.02-lower
height-for-age z score (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04; P , 0.002) or 0.08-cm
lower height/cup (95% CI: 0.04, 0.2 cm) of noncow milk could
be explained by a reduction in cow milk (indirect effect). For
example, a 3-y-old child who consumed 3 cups of noncow milk
and 0 cups of cow milk had a lower height-for-age z score of
0.4 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.5) or w1.5-cm lower height (95% CI: 0.8,
2.0 cm) relative to a child of the same age who consumed 3 cups
of cow milk and 0 cups of noncow milk (Figure 3).
Repeating the primary analysis with the use of only non-
imputed data did not change the results. Including only children
with paternal height data produced similar findings but with
wider CIs because of the smaller sample size.
DISCUSSION
We have identified a dose-dependent association between higher
consumption of noncow milk and lower height in childhood. For
the average child, each daily cup of noncow milk consumed was
associated with a 0.4-cm lower height. This relation was only
partially mediated by lower cow milk consumption. Children aged
3 y who consumed 3 cups noncow milk/d relative to 3 cups cow
milk/d were, on average, 1.5 cm shorter. This height difference was
similar to the difference between the major percentile lines in the
WHO growth charts (29).
To our knowledge, the association between higher con-
sumption of noncow milk and lower childhood height has not
been reported. However, the association between higher con-
sumption of cow milk and increased height has been described
previously. Similar to our study, DeBoer et al. (4) also identified a
0.06 higher height-for-age z score for each cup of cow milk
consumed. In addition, a meta-analysis of intervention studies
identified similar gains in height among children assigned to
consume cow milk (9). Although the biological mechanism for
this effect is unclear, it has been hypothesized that milk proteins
(i.e., casein and whey) and IGF-1 in cow milk may contribute to
height (9, 38, 39). Cow milk protein has also been shown to
stimulate serum IGF-1 concentrations that may increase height
via the growth hormone IGF-1 axis, which promotes cellular
growth in bones and in other body tissues (8, 39–41).
Several studies have identified that cow milk–avoidant chil-
dren appear to be shorter than children who consume cow milk
(22). It has been hypothesized that such children may not receive
sufficient protein or calories to support optimal growth (12, 20,
25). Alternatively, the reason for milk avoidance such as illness
or food allergy has also been suggested as possible mechanisms
(15, 20, 22). Hoppe et al. (39) investigated total protein intake,
serum IGF-1, and height and found that children who consumed

 more plant-based protein (e.g., legumes), which do not contain
IGF-1, were slightly shorter (by 0.1 cm) and had lower con-
centrations of IGF-1 than children who consumed animal-based
protein and milk, which may explain why the association be-
tween higher noncow milk intake and lower height was only
partially mediated through lower cow milk intake.
Many noncow milk beverages are marketed and sold as milk
products for children. Although the nutritional content of cow milk
is standardized by the FDA and the Food and Drug Regulations of
Canada (23, 24), noncow milk is not subject to the same standards.
The USDA MyPlate and Canadian Food Guide have acknowl-
edged that unfortified milk alternatives do not provide the same
energy, protein, or vitamins and minerals found in cow milk (21,
25, 42). For example, 2 cups of cow milk contain 16 g protein,
which is 70% of the daily protein requirement for children aged 3 y.
Two cups of almond milk, on the other hand, contains 4 g protein,
which is only 25% of the daily protein requirement for children
aged 3 y who may not be receiving sufficient dietary protein from
other sources to support optimal growth.
Standardization of the nutritional content of noncow milk may
assist parents in choosing between milk beverages of equal
nutritional content. Alternatively, improved front-of-package
labeling to indicate micronutrient fortification (including cal-
cium and vitamin D) or whether the milk beverage provides a
sufficient source of protein for children would assist parents in
making informed decisions about the appropriate choice of milk
for their children.
Strengths of this study include a relatively large multicultural
sample (n = 5034) of healthy urban preschool-aged children.
Data on milk consumption anthropometric measurements and
numerous clinically relevant factors such as maternal height,
ethnicity, and family income allowed for the adjustment of po-
tential confounders, and the magnitude of the association be-
tween cow milk consumption and height was consistent with
other studies that have suggested the generalizability of our
findings (4, 9). Furthermore, we used a sophisticated analytic
approach that included multiple imputations to address missing
data and a rigorous stepwise mediation analysis to explore the
relation between cow milk consumption and the primary effect.
Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional design for
which we could determine associations but not causal relations.
Questionnaire data about milk intake may be subject to mea-
surement error or recall bias. Height, although measured with the
use of standardized techniques, may be subject to measurement
error given the young age of this population. Although we ad-
justed for numerous potential confounding variables, residual
confounding remains a possibility. For example, we were unable
to account for other dietary factors that may contribute to height
because of data limitations. Noncow milk beverages vary in
nutritional content, and we could not evaluate which noncow milk
beverages most influenced the observed relation (e.g., soy and
goat milk beverages tend to have higher protein content than
almond or rice milk beverages). Adjusting for paternal height
would have been desirable, but we had limited data on this
variable. However, repeating the primary analysis with children
who had paternal height data resulted in similar findings. In
addition, although the population was ethnically diverse, it may
not be representative of all urban North American children.
Although cow milk consumption has been associated with
increased childhood height, noncow milk consumption seems to
be associated with lower childhood height. Each daily cup of
noncow milk consumed was associated with a 0.4-cm lower
childhood height. This relation was only partially mediated by a
0.5-cup lower cow milk consumption for each cup of noncow
milk consumed. Our findings may be important for parents,
dietitians, and physicians when considering the optimal type of
milk for children to consume. Future research is needed to un-
derstand which noncow milk beverages are most responsible for
this association as well as understanding the causal relations
between noncow milk consumption and childhood height.
