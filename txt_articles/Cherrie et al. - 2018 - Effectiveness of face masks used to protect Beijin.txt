Objectives Many residents in Beijing use disposable 
face masks in an attempt to protect their health from 
high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. retail masks 
may be certified to local or international standards, but 
their real-life performance may not confer the exposure 
reduction potential that is marketed. this study aimed to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a range of face masks that 
are commercially available in china.
Methods nine masks claiming protection against fine 
PM (PM2.5) were purchased from consumer outlets in 
Beijing. the masks’ filtration efficiency was tested by 
drawing airborne diesel exhaust through a section of 
the material and measuring the PM2.5 and black carbon 
(Bc) concentrations upstream and downstream of the 
filtering medium. Four masks were selected for testing 
on volunteers. Volunteers were exposed to diesel exhaust 
inside an experimental chamber while performing 
sedentary tasks and active tasks. Bc concentrations were 
continuously monitored inside and outside the mask.
results the mean per cent penetration for each mask 
material ranged from 0.26% to 29%, depending on the 
flow rate and mask material. in the volunteer tests, the 
average total inward leakage (til) of Bc ranged from 
3% to 68% in the sedentary tests and from 7% to 66% 
in the active tests. Only one mask type tested showed an 
average til of less than 10%, under both test conditions.
Conclusions Many commercially available face masks 
may not provide adequate protection, primarily due to 
poor facial fit. Our results indicate that further attention 
should be given to mask design and providing evidence-
based guidance to consumers.

In China, air pollution causes around 1.6 
million 
premature deaths each year and the loss of around 
31 
million disability-adjusted life years.1 Annual 
average particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter 
2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) concentrations in Chinese 
megacities well exceed the WHO’s guideline of 
10 
µg/m3, and corresponding black carbon (BC) 
concentrations are around 5 
µg/m3.2 Beijing PM2.5 
concentrations often reach unhealthy levels during 
the winter and near busy streets.3
Chinese residents now have access to air quality 
information and can take measures to protect them-
selves in the short term. Studies in China have found 
that wearing face masks can have positive impacts on 
short-term health outcomes such as blood pressure 
and heart rate variability,4–6 although it is unclear 
what level of exposure reduction was associated 
with these impacts, given that only ambient partic-
ulate concentrations were measured.
In occupational health, the term ‘respirator’ 
includes a range of personal respiratory protection 
products, including disposable filtering facepiece 
(FFP) respirators, sometimes referred to as ‘dust 
masks’ or ‘face masks’, particularly in lay parlance. 
In this manuscript, we use the latter term (or 
key messages
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Both the filtration efficiency and edge-seal 
leakage of a face mask or respirator  are 
important in determining the exposure 
reduction a mask will confer on the wearer.
 
► Mask wearing is associated with positive 
impacts such as short-term reductions in blood 
pressure and increases in heart rate variability, 
but the exposure reduction associated with 
these impacts is not known.
What are the new findings?
 
► Filtration efficiency of a face mask does not 
necessarily translate into consistent exposure 
reduction for individuals.
 
► Some masks marketed as highly efficient at 
reducing particulate exposure do not achieve 
the claimed exposure reduction when worn by 
individuals.
 
► Even the best performing masks did not always 
reduce exposure consistently across a range of 
activities.
How might this impact on policy or clinical 
practice in the foreseeable future?
 
► This study indicates that rigorous and 
standardised testing, including volunteer trials, 
should be conducted to ensure the efficacy 
of all face masks available for consumer use 
against air pollution.
 
► Furthermore, consumers and regulators should 
be better informed about the exposure impacts 
of different mask types and how to ensure that 
masks fits appropriately.
 
► Researchers interested in investigating the 
health impacts of face masks should include 
measurements of exposure reduction on 
study participants to more accurately evaluate 
the impact of mask wearing on air pollution 
exposure.

abbreviate to ‘mask’), as we are evaluating these devices for use 
in non-occupational air pollution settings. Respirators remove 
particles from the inhaled airstream by filtration, through grav-
itational settling, inertial impaction, interception, diffusion 
and electrostatic deposition.7 Filtration efficiency depends 
on particle size, charge, concentration and flow rate through 
the filter material. In practice, the contaminant may bypass 
the filter, by passing through small gaps between the edge of 
the respirator and the face, so-called ‘edge-seal leakage’. The 
extent of leakage depends on factors such as the size and shape 
of the face, facial hair, the respirator design and the way that 
it is worn.
Disposable particulate respirators sold for use in workplaces 
are generally tested to ensure compliance with appropriate inter-
national or national standards (online supplementary table S1), 
but face masks sold for public protection against air pollution 
may not need to comply with any standards, and so may not be 
suitable. In November 2016, the Chinese National Institute of 
Standardization issued a new guideline to recommend testing of 
protection levels for ‘daily protective masks’ (online supplemen-
tary table S1). This guideline (GB/T 32 
610–2016) categorises 
masks based on their filtration efficiency (online supplementary 
table S1). Unlike GB2626-2006 (the Chinese standard for occu-
pational masks) and other regulatory standards, it is not compul-
sory that ‘daily protective masks’ fulfil these testing guidelines. 
The tests in this study were carried out before the introduction 
of this guideline.
There is limited information about the performance of 
face masks against diesel exhaust particulate, which may play 
an important role in the health impacts of ambient particu-
late matter (PM).8 9 Studies often test the filtration efficiency 
of a section of the mask filter material in a sample holder or 
on mannequin heads, usually sealing the mask to the manne-
quin’s face. One study investigated the filtration efficiency of 
mask filter material complying with the N95 criteria (filtering 
≥95% 
particulate, online supplementary table S1),10 finding 
that between <0.5% 
and 4.3% of the diesel aerosol, measured 
as elemental carbon, passed through the filters. Langrish et al4 
demonstrated that several mask materials allowed <5% of a 
diesel exhaust challenge through the material. A study of the 
filtration efficiency of masks mounted on a mannequin head 
with mask sealed to the head found penetration of diesel aerosol 
mass between 11% and 15% for FFP2 masks and 13%–24% 
for FFP3 masks.11 These studies, however, did not account for 
inward leakage around the seal between the mask and face on 
humans.
Previous work on face masks used by the public has indicated 
poor performance, with masks often being poorly designed 
and ill-fitting.12–14 The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Quality 
and Technical Supervision and China Consumers Association 
tested the filtration efficiency of several commercially available 
face masks.15 16 The methods are not described in the reports, 
but few of the masks passed the requirements. We have found 
no direct measurements of the effectiveness of masks against 
diesel exhaust particulate or ambient particulate pollution when 
worn by people. Masks mounted on mannequins provide only 
partially realistic tests. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
test the filtration efficiency of a range of masks sold to consumers 
in Beijing and, for the best performing masks, to assess mask 
effectiveness in reducing exposure to diesel exhaust particulates 
when worn by volunteers.
METHOds
Nine masks were purchased in China (figure 1, online supple-
mentary table S2), online, in a local pharmacy or convenience 
store. Tests were conducted in a chamber in Edinburgh, UK. 
Prior to the mask testing, the diesel particulate was characterised 
using a DustTrak DRX (TSI, Minnesota, USA) and Fast Mobility 
Particle Sizer (FMPS 3091, TSI).
Mask material penetration
The surface area of each mask was estimated using image editing 
software ( 
Paint. 
net V
.4.013, dotPDN LLC, 2016) from a scanned 
image. A circular area was cut from each mask and fitted to a 
sample holder (15.9 
cm2).
Masks were tested in a chamber (online supplementary figure 
S1) for 30 
min under flow rates equivalent to 40 
L/min and 80 
L/
min through the whole mask but scaled to the area of the mask 
in the sampler. These rates were chosen to reflect high intensity 
breathing rates, which would be expected to draw more parti-
cles through the filter material and therefore mimic a worst case 
scenario (eg, cycling or running through traffic). The US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency  (EPA)’s Exposure Factors Hand-
book, suggests the mean high activity breathing rate for males 
and females aged 21–<31 years old is 50 
L/min (95th percentile 
76 
L/min).17 18
The testing order of the masks was randomised. The target 
challenge BC concentration was 50 
µg/m3. A MicroAeth AE51 
(Aethlabs, San Francisco, USA) measured BC, and a Sidepak 
AM510 (TSI) measured PM2.5 (online supplementary informa-
tion). The Sidepak was not calibrated for diesel exhaust, because 
we were examining the relative change in filtration, rather than 
absolute concentrations.
Volunteer tests
Four masks for the volunteer tests were selected based on 
performance in the material penetration tests and mask design, 
including how the masks would seal against the face and method 
of attaching the mask to the head.
Volunteers were recruited via word of mouth, social media and 
a local marketplace website. Volunteers were screened to ensure 
they had no underlying health problems. The original design was 
to have eight volunteers (four male, four female), each wearing 
all four masks, with two tests per mask (one standing and one 
sitting). However, the first two female volunteers dropped out 
after testing two masks, and two other female volunteers were 
recruited to test the remaining two masks. The total number of 
volunteers, therefore, was 10 (4 male, 6 females) (see online 
supplementary table S3).
Four facial dimensions were measured using anthropometric 
callipers: lip length, distance from chin to nasal root (menton–
sellion length), facial width (bizygomatic width) and tragion 
(ear) to the tip of the nose. One individual measured all of the 
volunteers to reduce any variability in the measurement method. 
A Latin square design was employed to randomise the order in 
which the masks were tested by the volunteers. Additional infor-
mation on the mask and sampling equipment donning are avail-
able in online supplementary information.19
The tests were conducted in an exposure chamber supplied 
with air from a mixing chamber connected to a small diesel 
engine (online supplementary figure S2) with the target average 
BC concentration of 50 
µg/m3.
Volunteers performed two simulation tests, designed to reflect 
everyday activities: (1) sitting (sedentary) and (2) standing 
and walking on the spot (active). All simulations had subtasks:

breathing normally (5 
min), deep breathing (2 
min), moving the 
head up and down (2 
min), moving the head side to side (2 
min), 
talking (2 
min), bending over (2 
min) and breathing normally 
(2 
min). BC was measured simultaneously inside the mask (pene-
tration concentration) and in the exposure chamber (challenge 
concentration).
data analysis
The per cent penetration for each mask’s filter material was 
calculated by dividing the penetration concentration by the 
challenge concentration at each time point, for BC and PM2.5. 
Agreement between the penetration percentages from the 
MicroAeth and Sidepak readings were assessed using a Spearman 
correlation. For the simulation study, the total inward leakage 
(TIL) percentage of BC was calculated by dividing the concen-
tration measured inside each mask by the concentration in the 
exposure chamber for each time point.
The unadjusted mean, median and interquartile range (IQR) of 
TILs were generated for each mask. Autocorrelation for time-se-
ries data, where values are influenced by previous time points, 
was assessed with the Durbin-Watson statistic.20 A Cochrane-Or-
cutt first-order autoregression model was developed to adjust 
TILs by the following covariates: mask type, time, gender, face 
size and activity. Covariates were included in the model using 
a likelihood ratio test significant at P<0.05. Goodness of fit of 
a log-linear model was compared using the Bayesian informa-
tion criterion. For categorical variables, the level contributing 
the smallest incremental increase in TIL was used as the refer-
ence. The activities undertaken during the tests were grouped 
if volunteers were (1) sitting or standing/walking, (2) moving 
their head, (3) remaining stationary, (4) talking, (5) breathing 
deeply or (6) bending. Volunteers were classified as either small/
medium or large face sizes by National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health  (NIOSH) guidelines based on face length and 
width21 and through the assessment of lip length and face depth. 
Data analysis was performed using the ‘prais’ command in Stata

During the diesel characterisation period, the chamber air PM2.5 
consisted of >90% PM1. The nanoparticle size distribution 
in the chamber indicated that particles were primarily below 
0.3 
µm, with the mode below 0.1 
µm.
Mask material penetration
Overall agreement of penetration between the two instruments 
was very good (rho=0.84, P<0.001). In the 40 
L/min flow rate 
scenario, eight of the nine masks demonstrated median rates of 
penetration below 9% for both PM2.5 and BC (figure 2). The 
median penetration of BC ranged from 0.2% (IQR: 0.2%–0.3%) 
to 20.7% (IQR: 19.6%–22.1%) with the lowest value being for 
the ‘Yimeijian’ mask and the highest being for the ‘Gucheng 
Professional AntiHaze W&G’ (‘Gucheng’) mask. Values were 
similar, but slightly higher, using 80 
L/min, ranging from 0.7% 
(IQR: 0.4%–1.0%) to 32.8% (IQR: 21.1%–35.3%) with the 
same masks performing best/worst.

Penetration of PM2.5 was typically greater than for BC: the 
Yimeijian mask exhibited the lowest median penetration at 0.3% 
(IQR: 0.2%–0.3%) for the 40 
L/min flow, with the highest corre-
sponding penetration seen for the Gucheng, with a median of 
29.3% (IQR: 27.7%–30.3%). The median range for 80 
L/min 
tests extended from 0.8% (IQR: 0.7%–1.1%) for Yimeijian to 
41.4% (IQR: 33.9%–50.2%) for Gucheng.
Volunteer study
The 3M9322, 3M9502, Yi Jie PM2.5 mask and the Yimeijian 
mask were selected for the volunteer trials (figure 1).
There was relatively little variability in face size among volun-
teers, with the exception of two, which were classified as large 
(online supplementary table S3). The eight other volunteers 
were classified as having ‘Small’ or ‘Medium’ faces. Figure 3 
provides the TIL ranges for the four masks tested in the volun-
teer studies, in the same order shown in figure 2. TIL values in 
excess of 100% are possible where there is a very poor facial 
seal; in this instance, TIL values would largely represent fluctua-
tions of similar concentration levels inside and outside the mask. 
A number of high outliers are evident in the TIL values for both 
3M masks; the TIL values exceeding 30% occurred for a single 
subject for each 3M mask, although the volunteers differed 
between masks. There was clear variation in the unadjusted 
median TILs across the four masks tested, spanning from 1.8% 
(IQR: 0.6%–4.7%) for 3M9322 to 67.3% (IQR: 56.6%–75.2%) 
for the Yi Jie PM2.5 mask.
There was apparent variation in the TIL across volunteers, 
time and activities (figure 4). The Durbin-Watson statistic was 
0.12 from a simple regression model with mask type as the 
dependent variable, indicating positive autocorrelation. The 
transformed value produced in a Cochrane-Orcutt regression 
was close to 2.00 (1.85), suggesting autocorrelation had been 
sufficiently addressed. Only mask type and activity were signif-
icant in the model at P<0.05. Face size, sitting/standing and 
elapsed time had no measureable effect on TIL. A log-linear 
model was deemed a better fit than a linear model according to 
the Bayesian information criterion difference. After adjustment 
for covariates, the 3M9322 mask was significantly better than 
the three other masks, which increased leakage by a factor of 2.0 
(95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) to 26.7 (95% CI 16.4 to 43.5) (see table 1). 
Compared with talking, only bending and head moving contrib-
uted to higher TIL, ranging from 1.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.3) to 1.2 
(95% CI 1.1 to 1.3) times greater than the reference category of 
talking, respectively. After adjustment for autocorrelation, the 
regression model explained 11% of the variation in the TIL data 
(table 1).
disCussiOn
We assessed the real-life effectiveness of masks worn by Beijing 
residents, to protect against urban air pollution. We demon-
strate that a mask with highly efficient particle filtering material 
may confer little protection when worn. Facial fit and move-
ment have a large impact on the actual protection. In spite of 
the generally good filtration efficiency of the tested mask mate-
rials, two of the masks performed poorly when worn because 
of inadequate fit to the face. These included a reusable mask 
with disposable filters (Yi Jie PM2.5) and a single-fold disposable 
mask (Yimeijian). The reusable mask cloth was loose, and the 
filters did not cover the whole surface area of the mask. These 
masks used elasticated ear loops to hold them onto the face 
rather than head straps. Even for the better-performing masks 
(3M9502 and 3M9322), some volunteers’ results indicated that 
the fit was not sufficient to ensure maximal performance of the 
mask.
Our first-order autoregression model suggested the presence 
of large differences in the efficacy of the tested masks, and that 
activities, namely, bending and head moving, adversely affected 
the fit. The best performing mask had an estimated mean leakage 
of 2.3%, which corresponds to a protection factor of 43 (protec-
tion factor being the inverse of the leakage, or TIL). The poorest 
performing mask had a mean leakage of 61% (protection factor 
1.6). The face size of the volunteer or the duration did not have 
a detectable effect on leakage; however, the tests were conducted 
over a short time, and we cannot be certain of the effect of longer 
duration wear.
Our results correspond with findings from van der Sande et 
al,22 who tested an FFP2 mask (online supplementary table S1) 
versus a surgical mask and a home-made tea cloth mask against 
sodium chloride (NaCl) particles <1 
µm diameter on volunteers. 
They found differences between protection factors for volun-
teers within a single mask type, with children much less protected 
compared with adults. Variation of protection by activity was

greatest for an FFP2 mask compared with surgical and home-
made tea cloth masks, implying that, although the FFP2 mask 
conferred greatest protection in terms of its material composi-
tion, fit was an important factor. A study of respiratory protec-
tion against volcanic ash also found that industry-certified N95 
or N99 equivalent masks performed best in volunteer TIL tests 
compared with masks made from other materials with similar 
filtering abilities.13 14 Similarly, Grinshpun et al23 found that 
70% of total variability in the faceseal-leakage-to-filter (FLTF) 
ratio was associated with subject characteristics, compared with 
30% due to how the subject put on the respirator. They also 
found that movement exercises resulted in larger FLTF ratios 
and that the ratio increased as particle size increased (from 0.04 
to 1 
µm). Conversely, Lee et al24 did not find a particle-depen-
dent protection relationship in a similar size range, and Shakya et 
al25 found variable results with regard to filtration efficiency and 
particle size (all below 1 
µm). These size-dependent effects may 
be due to submicron-sized particles being more likely to deposit 
by diffusion. Diesel exhaust particulate primarily consists of the 
ultrafine fraction of the aerosol, which can be breathed deep 
into the alveolar region of the lung and may then cross into the 
bloodstream.26
The use of a diesel exhaust challenge, rather than sodium chlo-
ride, provides a scenario that is closer to real-world exposures, 
particularly near busy roads, where people are more likely to 
wear masks. Gao et al27 found that N95 filters did not perform 
as well compared with R95 or P95 filters when exposed to 
combustion source aerosol (wood, paper and plastic) compared 
with NaCl, although all these filters did filter at least 95% of the 
aerosol.
None of the masks tested in our study were certified to 
the Chinese guidelines for ‘daily protective masks’ (GB/T 
32 
610–2016), because the guidelines were introduced after 
our study was conducted, but six of the nine masks we tested 
were reportedly certified to GB2626-2006, or an international 
equivalent. One of these (Yi Jie) performed poorly in the volun-
teer trial. While respirators for workplace use are required to be 
tested to a rigorous standard, including TIL, respirators for the 
consumer market are not.
An analysis of internet purchases of face masks in urban areas 
across China found that a 100-point increase in the Air Quality 
Index resulted in a 70% increase in sales of masks marketed as 
‘anti-PM2.5’ and a 54% increase in all mask purchases,28 indi-
cating that this is a popular method of protection used by people 
in China. To ensure that the general public are able to effectively 
protect themselves, all consumer air pollution masks should be 
required to fulfil the same standards as workplace masks, and 
sales of non-compliant models should be restricted. Consumers 
in China also need better information about the type of masks 
that should be used, the actual TIL that might be achieved with 
face masks and how to wear the masks to achieve a good fit. 
Consumers should know that, although surgical masks may have 
reasonable filtration efficiency, the design generally confers poor 
facial fit and high TIL with regards to air pollution.25 29 30
In addition to consumer applications, our study has impli-
cations for research studies that investigate health benefits of 
mask-wearing to protect against air pollution. While studies 
have shown some reduction in blood pressure and increases in 
heart rate variability from wearing a respirator over a few hours, 
there was no assessment of the exposure reduction while the 
respirators were being worn in any of these studies.4–6 Our study

has shown that there may be considerable interindividual and 
intraindividual variation in TIL, even with relatively well-con-
structed respirators, and there are potentially large, systematic 
differences among respirator brands.
limitations
Our study was not a comprehensive survey of air pollution 
face masks, but rather, provides preliminary results. We selected 
a convenience sample of masks from retail outlets based on acces-
sibility and design type. There are a wide variety of masks on the 
market, and we were not able to test all of them. We also had a 
relatively small sample size of volunteers, and not all volunteers 
wore all four masks that were being tested; therefore, we cannot 
draw conclusions about the fit across all tested masks for a given 
face shape. We had more small/medium face types than large 
and did not have sufficient volunteers to distinguish small from 
medium. We had similar numbers of males and females but, due 
to small numbers, this was not a representative sample, nor were 
the subjects exclusively Chinese.
Another potential uncertainty in our study relates to the 
response of the instruments to the aerosol concentration. If the 
response is not linear across the range of concentrations, we may 
be underestimating or overestimating the filtration efficiency. 
We have previously evaluated the MicroAeth AE51 in the field 
versus a reference aethelometer (AE22) and found a consistently 
linear relationship across the range of concentrations tested in 
this study (unpublished data). Although we do not have a refer-
ence comparison for the Sidepak for PM2.5, the relationship 
between the penetration ratios for each instrument is linear, 
implying that the Sidepak should have a similar response across 
the range of concentrations in the study.
In future work, we suggest that a comprehensive survey of the 
different face mask types available and of their popularity of use 
be conducted. A larger, more representative population sample 
should be recruited for testing, and a wider variety of face mask 
types should be tested for TIL. In day-to-day use, respirators 
will not be constantly worn, and this will inevitably reduce the 
overall protection offered although, to our knowledge, there 
are no extensive study data available on wearing behaviour of 
consumers in China. To assess the exposure-reduction potential 
of real-world face mask use in the public, it is necessary to under-
stand wearing patterns and to assess the effect of constant donning 
and doffing of masks by the general public. In future studies of 
the public health benefits of wearing respiratory protection, we 
recommend the researchers monitor particulate concentrations 
inside the facepiece and take these data into account in analysis 
of the association between exposure to particulate pollution and 
health markers. This would provide a more accurate assessment 
of particulate exposure change and more robustness to the eval-
uation of the exposure–response relationship.
