ABSTRACT
Background: Conflicting evidence exists on the effects of fructose
consumption in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. No
systematic review has addressed the effect of isoenergetic fructose
replacement of glucose or sucrose on peak postprandial glucose,
insulin, and triglyceride concentrations.
Objective: The objective of this study was to review the evidence for
postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses after isoenergetic re-
placement of either glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages with fructose.
Design: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE,
the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search
Portal, and clinicaltrials.gov. The date of the last search was 26
April 2016. We included randomized controlled trials measuring
peak postprandial glycemia after isoenergetic replacement of glu-
cose, sucrose, or both with fructose in healthy adults or children
with or without diabetes. The main outcomes analyzed were peak
postprandial blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations.
Results: Replacement of either glucose or sucrose by fructose re-
sulted in significantly lowered peak postprandial blood glucose,
particularly in people with prediabetes and type 1 and type 2 di-
abetes. Similar results were obtained for insulin. Peak postprandial
blood triglyceride concentrations did not significantly increase.
Conclusions: Strong evidence exists that substituting fructose for
glucose or sucrose in food or beverages lowers peak postprandial
blood glucose and insulin concentrations. Isoenergetic replace-
ment does not result in a substantial increase in blood triglyceride
concentrations.

INTRODUCTION
Sugars, and particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, have re-
cently been the focus of much attention. Of particular concern is
the role of sugar consumption in obesity and the development of
type 2 diabetes. The recent WHO report on sugar consumption has
identified a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to
determine the effects of intake of free sugars on diabetes-related
outcomes (1).
One current hypothesis for the progression from normoglycemia
to prediabetes and ultimately diabetes states that constant exposure
to high concentrations of glucose and lipids is toxic to pancreatic b
cells (2). Thus, even in normoglycemic populations, a reduction of
peak postprandial glycemia should be beneficial. In prediabetic
and diabetic populations, stress on pancreatic b cells from high
postprandial blood glucose concentrations may exacerbate oxi-
dative stress and accelerate the progression of the disease (3).
Carbohydrate consumption in excess of the body’s capacity for
glycogen storage leads to lipogenesis. Fatty acids produced by the
liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue are esterified into triglycerides and
stored for later use. The primary products of such de novo lipo-
genesis are palmitic and stearic acids. These fatty acids have been
associated with insulin resistance through their disruption of the
signaling pathway for glucose transporters, which enable cells to
take up and use glucose (4). Furthermore, there is a suggestion that
insulin resistance in skeletal muscle could be the result of increased
intracellular fatty acid metabolites (e.g., diacylglycerol), which, in
association with long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A, leads to a failure
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3k) activation and thus the down-
regulation of glucose transporters (3). Because fructose has been
associated with increased de novo lipogenesis (5, 6), it has been
suggested that fructose replacement for glucose or sucrose would
raise the postprandial triglyceride concentration above that seen with
glucose or sucrose, thus worsening or even causing diabetes.
We could not identify any prior systematic review that examined
acute postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and adverse events after
isoenergetic fructose replacement for glucose or sucrose, which
prompted us to investigate. In this article, we present the findings of a
systematic review and meta-analysis of replacing glucose or sucrose
with fructose in people with and without diabetes as well as in lean,
overweight, and obese populations.

 METHODS
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses guidelines
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed and a checklist was
completed and provided (7).
Registration of protocol
The protocol for this meta-analysis was designed a priori and
the review was registered with the PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (8).
Data sources and searches
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal,
and clinicaltrials.gov databases with no time or language re-
strictions. The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. The search
strategy was designed for Entrez-PubMed by RAE, JHC, KEM, and
Fiona Lithander (University of Canberra) and was converted by
scientific librarians for other database searches. The Entrez-PubMed
search strategy is presented in Supplemental Table 1. The search
strategy was designed to identify controlled trials involving fruc-
tose, as well as glucose or sucrose along with a marker of diabetes
or glycemia and insulinemia. All citations were uploaded into
EPPI-Reviewer 4 (9). After removal of duplicates, 2075 abstracts
remained. These 2075 abstracts were assigned in EPPI-Reviewer
4 to 2 authors (RAE and KEM) for blinded inclusion or exclusion
(k = 0.850). Differences in allocation were resolved by consensus.
Study selection
We examined the full-text articles from all included abstracts.
Blinded inclusion or exclusion of full-text articles was carried out
independently in EPPI-Reviewer 4 by 2 authors (RAE and KEM;
k = 0.375) based on the following 6 criteria: 1) the intervention
was fructose; 2) the control was either glucose or sucrose; 3) the
replacement was isoenergetic (equal number of grams of sugar in
each arm); 4) the study was a randomized controlled trial; 5) the
study period was $45 min postprandial; and 6) the study pre-
sented data on peak postprandial blood glucose. Discrepancies
between authors were resolved by consensus. Hand searching of
citations was done by 1 author (RAE), and new abstracts were
examined by 2 authors (RAE and KEM), as described above. To
avoid double counting, for studies that had .1 fructose in-
tervention, the lowest-dose intervention was extracted. For studies
that had food as well as beverage interventions, the food in-
terventions were extracted. The final number of included study
arms was 81 from 47 individual trials (Figure 1). Detailed de-
scriptions of the studies are given in Supplemental Table 2.
Data from the included trials were extracted by one author (RAE)
and double-checked by a second author (KEM). Outcome measures
were extracted: peak and AUC postprandial blood glucose, peak
and AUC blood insulin, peak and AUC blood triglycerides, HDL,
LDL, total cholesterol, as well as participant characteristics, sample
size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and duration of intervention.
The definitions of normoglycemic, impaired glucose tolerance,
and type 2 diabetes were taken from Diabetes Management in
General Practice (10). If stated, we used the study author’s
classification of their study population. If this was not stated,
fasting blood glucose values were calculated with the use of the
mean blood glucose value at time 0 of the intervention.
The study quality was assessed by following the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews (11). Two investigators (RAE
and Fiona Lithander) independently assessed the risk of bias
based on 1) random sequence generation, 2) allocation con-
cealment, 3) blinding of participants and personnel, 4) blinding
of outcome assessment, 5) incomplete outcome data (attrition
bias), and 6) selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias.
Studies for acute outcomes were not excluded for lack of
blinding of participants or personnel, because this should not
influence objective measures such as postprandial glycemia.
Data synthesis and analysis
For all outcomes, the means, along with their SEs or SDs, were
extracted. Where a study had a number of arms that used the same
population, we extracted data from a single arm. To avoid double
counting of studies that used both sucrose and glucose as controls,
the data were separated in the analyses by type of sugar. SDs were
converted to SEs by using the calculation SD = SE 3 square root of
the number of subjects. In the rare cases that SDs or SEs were not
given and could not be calculated from other information, they
were imputed by taking the mean of the SDs from all other studies
of the same design that reported that outcome (12). Of the 47
studies included, SDs were imputed for 7 studies. Outcome data
were extracted into a Microsoft Excel worksheet by one author
(RAE) and were double-checked by another author (KEM). For
crossover studies, the difference was calculated as

Outcome data were copied into Review Manager 5.3 (13) and
analyzed with a generic inverse variance, random-effects model
with 95% CIs. This model allows for the combining of crossover
and parallel trials. Because the studies used different populations,
different doses, and different food vehicles, we used a random-effects
model rather than a fixed-effects model. Significance was investi-
gated with the use of P values. A P value ,0.05 was deemed to
be statistically significant. Meta-regression was carried out in Open-
MetaAnalyst (14) with the use of dose, diabetes status, and weight
as covariates in a random-effects model. Outcomes with ,10

 studies were considered to be insufficient to enable a meaningful
interpretation of outcomes (12). Heterogeneity of 0–40% as mea-
sured by I2 was defined as unimportant, 30–60% was considered
moderate heterogeneity, 50–90% was defined as substantial hetero-
geneity, and 85–100% was defined as considerable heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the effect of
diabetes status, body weight, and sugar presentation (food compared
with solution).
RESULTS
Study characteristics
A total of 47 individual studies were included in the final
analysis (study characteristics are provided in Table 1). Most
studies used a crossover model, but they varied widely in the
dose of fructose used as well as in its presentation. The post-
prandial period varied from 45 min to 24 h. The majority of
studies substituted fructose for glucose rather than for sucrose.
Quality assessment
The risk of bias was low for most outcomes, although information
about randomization was almost universally missing (Supple-
mental Figure 1). We did not downrate the objective outcomes if
they were not blinded to participants and personnel. This is because
we currently do not have any evidence that blinding participants,
personnel, or both for acute, objective outcomes (such as post-
prandial blood glucose, postprandial blood insulin, and postprandial
blood triglycerides) leads to an improvement in outcome quality.
Meta-analysis
A total of 62 study arms substituting fructose for glucose and
19 study arms substituting fructose for sucrose that measured
postprandial peak blood glucose concentrations were included
in this meta-analysis. For both replacements, we undertook a
subgroup analysis by diabetes status (normoglycemic, impaired
glucose tolerance, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes) (Figure 2,
FIGURE 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram of included studies. Of 2075 individual abstracts, 1929 were
excluded based on the title and abstract. The full texts of the 146 remaining articles were examined by 2 study authors (RAE and KEM). Of these 146 articles,
107 were excluded. An additional 8 studies were identified by hand-searching the references of the included trials. A total of 47 trials were included in the final
analysis. Of these, 81 individual study arms were included in the meta-analyses. HTA, Health Technology Assessments.

 Supplemental Figure 2). Overall, the replacement of fructose for
glucose in food or beverages resulted in a reduction in peak post-
prandial glycemia of 22.34 mmol/L (95% CI: 22.62, 22.06 mmol/L)
(Figure 2). However, more importantly, the analysis of the sub-
groups revealed important differences. Those with impaired glu-
cose tolerance showed a greater reduction in peak blood glucose
[23.00 mmol/L (95% CI: 23.93, 22.06 mmol/L)] than those with
normoglycemia [22.06 mmol/L (95% CI: 22.30, 21.81 mmol/L)],
although this was not significant (P = 0.06). This effect in people
with impaired glucose tolerance was similar to the only study
in people with type 1 diabetes [23.33 mmol/L (95% CI:
25.21, 21.45 mmol/L)]. The 5 studies in people with type 2
diabetes, however, revealed the greatest reduction in glycemia
[24.66 mmol/L, (95% CI: 25.84, 23.47 mmol/L)], which was
significantly different from those with normoglycemia
(P , 0.0001). Similar results, but of a smaller magnitude, were
seen with fructose replacement for sucrose (Supplemental Figure
2). Significant reductions in peak blood glucose were seen in
patients with impaired glucose tolerance (P = 0.01) and type 2
diabetes (P = 0.04) compared with normoglycemic patients.
An important consideration was the overall blood glucose
AUC. The 12 study arms testing glucose replacement and the 6
study arms testing sucrose replacement reported the AUC in
several different ways. Therefore, we took the standardized mean
difference of the glucose or sucrose arms compared with the
fructose arms (Figure 3). Both sugar replacements resulted in
highly significant reductions in the blood glucose AUC (glucose
replacement: P , 0.00001; sucrose replacement: P = 0.003).
To understand the role of body weight in this variable, we
undertook a subgroup analysis and included only studies of peak
blood glucose in normoglycemic people with body weight as the
covariate. This analysis resulted in a significant difference be-
tween healthy weight and overweight subgroups (P = 0.007)
(Supplemental Figure 3). That is, within the normoglycemic
population, increased body weight was correlated with a greater
reduction in postprandial peak blood glucose.
To determine whether the effect seen in postprandial blood
glucose would translate to a similar effect in postprandial blood
insulin, we undertook a second subgroup meta-analysis. The
53 glucose replacement studies measuring peak postprandial
insulin concentrations were analyzed as described above (Figure
4, Supplemental Figure 4). Again, the majority of studies (46 of
53 studies) were performed in normoglycemic populations. The re-
sults of replacing fructose for glucose in normoglycemic populations
showed
a
clear
reduction
in
peak
postprandial
insulin
of
245.15 IU/mL (95% CI: 252.76, 237.53 IU/mL). However, the 2
studies in populations with impaired glucose tolerance experienced
an even greater reduction in postprandial insulin [260.13 IU/mL
(95% CI: 272.64, 247.62 IU/mL)]. This was significantly greater
than that observed in normoglycemic people (P = 0.04). People with
type 2 diabetes experienced a significant but small difference be-
tween post fructose and post glucose interventions. Very similar
results were seen in the sucrose replacement studies (Supplemental
Figure 4). The 2 studies in people with impaired glucose tolerance
demonstrated significantly lower postprandial peak blood insulin
concentrations than those in normoglycemic populations (P = 0.002).
To understand the role of body weight in postprandial insulin
responses, we undertook an analysis of postprandial peak blood
insulin in normoglycemic subjects by body weight (Supple-
mental Figure 5). For normoglycemic populations, there was no

 For both blood glucose and blood insulin outcomes, there was
high heterogeneity present. We suspected that this heterogeneity
was due to large variations in the dose of sugar used as well other
differences in the populations (such as diabetes status or body
weight). To test this hypothesis, we undertook a meta-regression
of postprandial blood glucose concentrations in all acute studies
(Table 2). The covariates included were dose, diabetes status,
and body weight. The meta-regression demonstrated highly
significant correlations (P , 0.001) for dose and type 2 diabetes
and a significant correlation with being overweight (P = 0.016).
As discussed in the introduction, fructose consumption has been
repeatedly associated with raised blood triglyceride concentrations.
In 10 of our acute studies, postprandial blood triglyceride con-
centrations were measured after replacing fructose for glucose (6,
19, 21, 29, 36, 39, 43, 44, 54, 55, 61, 62) or sucrose (6, 19, 29, 36)
(Figure 5). Neither replacement of fructose for glucose nor su-
crose resulted in a significant increase in postprandial peak blood
triglycerides (glucose: P = 0.15; sucrose: P = 0.42).
We were concerned that the manner of presentation of the
fructose, glucose, or sucrose could confound the results. Therefore,
we did a subgroup analysis of studies in normoglycemic, healthy
weight populations by presentation of the test sugar (Figure 6). We
divided the studies into solutions (e.g., 50 g glucose dissolved in
water with lemon flavoring) compared with food (e.g., a meal
with a glucose drink, or a glucose drink with fat, protein, or fat
and protein added). There were no significant differences between
these subgroups in peak postprandial blood glucose (P = 0.09).
To test for publication bias, we compiled funnel plots (Sup-
plemental Figure 6) and subjected them to Egger’s test for funnel
plot asymmetry. Plots measuring blood glucose (Supplemental
Figure 6A) and blood insulin (Supplemental Figure 6B) are likely
to be asymmetrical (P = 0.002, P , 0.0001, respectively), whereas
the plot of studies measuring blood triglycerides (Supplemental
Figure 6C) is symmetrical according to this test (P = 0.754).
A summary of all results can be found in Supplemental Table 3.
DISCUSSION
A recent summit of experts recognized the importance of
postprandial glycemia for health (63). Raised postprandial gly-
cemia is linked to all-cause mortality, an increased risk of diabetes,
cardiovascular events, and weight gain even in healthy populations
(64, 65). Because every person with type 2 diabetes once had
normal glucose tolerance, it is important to investigate the role of
postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in the transition from
normoglycemia to impaired glucose tolerance and then to type 2
diabetes mellitus. Although the exact mechanism of progression to
type 2 diabetes mellitus has not been established, decreasing b cell
function, perhaps through glucolipotoxicity (2), oxidative stress
(66), or other mechanisms (67, 68), is a consequence that may be
reversible through dietary and exercise interventions (66, 69, 70).
The finding that postprandial peak blood glucose concentra-
tions were lowered (Figure 2, Supplemental Figure 2) in those
consuming fructose was not unexpected. Fructose must first be
converted to glucose to influence blood glucose concentrations,
and thus, by definition, does not raise blood glucose as quickly as
sucrose or glucose. Importantly, however, we found that peak
blood glucose reductions are more pronounced in individuals
with impaired glucose tolerance or type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This
reinforces the potential benefits for glycemic control from the
isoenergetic exchange of glucose or sucrose in food or beverages
with fructose. Because blood glucose control is strongly asso-
ciated with increased quality of life (71), this benefit alone may
justify the replacement of glucose or sucrose by fructose.
We found that body weight was correlated with reduced
postprandial blood glucose (Supplemental Figure 3). Overweight
individuals were more likely to have a greater reduction in
postprandial peak blood glucose than those of healthy body
weight, independent of diabetes status. This finding demonstrates
the applicability of both weight reduction approaches and re-
placement of fructose for glucose or sucrose in overweight and
obese populations.

 Another expected finding was that fructose exchange for su-
crose or glucose significantly lowered peak postprandial blood
insulin concentrations (Figure 4). The ingestion of fructose does
not immediately result in the release of insulin. Instead, it is
metabolized in the liver, and thus does not stimulate the same
degree of insulin release (51). However, as for peak blood
glucose, the important finding is that those with impaired glucose
tolerance experienced the greatest reduction in peak postprandial
blood insulin concentrations. This in turn reduced the load on the
pancreatic b cells, which may have long-term benefits for glu-
cose control. People with type 2 diabetes, who have passed
through glucoadaptation of the pancreatic b cells into b cell

 dysfunction (2), showed the lowest postprandial peak insulin
concentrations.
Another analysis by body weight (Supplemental Figure 5)
showed a greater reduction in postprandial peak insulin in nor-
moglycemic, obese populations, and this was significantly dif-
ferent from insulin concentrations in normal-weight populations.
A great deal of research into fructose consumption focuses on
blood triglycerides. Excess dietary carbohydrates can be stored for
later use as glycogen via glycogenesis and fatty acids via de novo
lipogenesis. The conversion of carbohydrates into triglycerides has
been studied mainly in animal models. However, the use of rats and
mice for extrapolation is often problematic. Major metabolic
differences exist between humans and rodents (72, 73), not least in
de novo lipogenesis. Indeed, as demonstrated by Letexier et al.
(74), de novo lipogenesis in rats is far greater than that seen in
humans. Nevertheless, several studies reported that fructose
consumption raised blood triglycerides (5, 44, 54). In contrast, a
2008 meta-analysis found fructose doses of ,50 g had no sig-
nificant effect on postprandial triglycerides, with doses from 50–
100 g having no significant effect when subjects were fasting (75).
Our article provides additional evidence that fructose consumption
has no significant effect on blood triglycerides.
A major flaw with many earlier studies in this area is the use of
unsuitable controls or the lack of controls. Because all carbo-
hydrates, not just fructose, can be converted into fatty acids, it is
vital that any study that wishes to ascribe observed changes in
triglyceride concentrations to different carbohydrate sources
should do so only with an isoenergetic control. In fact, the failure
to account for excess energy in many studies means that causation
cannot reliably be applied. Thus, our meta-analysis included only
studies that substituted fructose for glucose or sucrose iso-
energetically. Our findings demonstrate that peak postprandial

 blood triglyceride concentrations were not raised significantly
after fructose consumption (Figure 5). This is in concordance
with a systematic review and meta-analysis examining post-
prandial blood triglycerides (but not glucose or insulin) (76), in
which isoenergetic exchange of fructose for other carbohydrates
did not lead to an increase in postprandial blood triglycerides.
Thus, a possible trade-off between reduced glycemia and in-
creased triglycerides may not be necessary. In any case, the role
of triglycerides as a cause, and not just a marker, of disease has
not been fully established (77).
The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis on iso-
energetic exchange of glucose or sucrose by fructose suggest that
there are benefits to fructose consumption without concomitant
adverse effects on blood lipids. Given the current level of interest in
dietary fructose, we feel that this meta-analysis is timely. Medical
and health practitioners who are unsure about recommending sugar
replacement to patients with or at risk of diabetes should feel assured
that the benefits of reducing postprandial peak blood glucose and
insulin do not come at the expense of raised blood lipid
concentrations. Replacement of fructose for glucose or sucrose could
be achieved in the diet by replacing sucrose or glucose with fructose
in recipes and choosing premade products sweetened with fructose
rather than glucose or sucrose. Furthermore, given that fructose has
1.2–1.7 (78, 79) times the sweetness of sucrose, an overall reduction
in sugar intake should be achievable. It should be noted, however,
that for food technological or other reasons, it may not be possible
to completely replace sucrose or glucose with fructose.
It is important to establish whether these short-term reductions
in peak blood glucose and insulin result in long-term changes in
fasting blood glucose or insulin concentrations. In our companion
review (80), we completed a systematic review and meta-analysis
on the isoenergetic exchange of glucose or sucrose by fructose in
long-term feeding studies.
