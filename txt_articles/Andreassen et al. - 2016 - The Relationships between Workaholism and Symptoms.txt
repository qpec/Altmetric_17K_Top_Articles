Abstract
Despite the many number of studies examining workaholism, large-scale studies have
been lacking. The present study utilized an open web-based cross-sectional survey assess-
ing symptoms of psychiatric disorders and workaholism among 16,426 workers (Mage = 37.3
years, SD = 11.4, range = 16–75 years). Participants were administered the Adult ADHD
Self-Report Scale, the Obsession-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale, and the Bergen Work Addiction Scale, along with additional questions
examining demographic and work-related variables. Correlations between workaholism
and all psychiatric disorder symptoms were positive and significant. Workaholism com-
prised the dependent variable in a three-step linear multiple hierarchical regression analy-
sis. Basic demographics (age, gender, relationship status, and education) explained 1.2%
of the variance in workaholism, whereas work demographics (work status, position, sector,
and annual income) explained an additional 5.4% of the variance. Age (inversely) and man-
agerial positions (positively) were of most importance. The psychiatric symptoms (ADHD,
OCD, anxiety, and depression) explained 17.0% of the variance. ADHD and anxiety contrib-
uted considerably. The prevalence rate of workaholism status was 7.8% of the present sam-
ple. In an adjusted logistic regression analysis, all psychiatric symptoms were positively
associated with being a workaholic. The independent variables explained between 6.1%
and 14.4% in total of the variance in workaholism cases. Although most effect sizes were
relatively small, the study’s findings expand our understanding of possible psychiatric pre-
dictors of workaholism, and particularly shed new insight into the reality of adult ADHD in
work life. The study’s implications, strengths, and shortcomings are also discussed.

 Introduction
Workaholism has been defined as “being overly concerned about work, driven by an uncon-
trollable work motivation, and to investing so much time and effort to work that it impairs
other important life areas” [1] (p. 8). Research into this timely topic has heavily expanded over
the past few decades [2,3], and concerns have been raised regarding the downsides of worka-
holism [4,5]. In order to prevent workaholism developing, there is a need to identify factors
involved with this compulsive work pattern–especially since modern technology (i.e., laptops,
tablets, smartphones) has blurred the natural lines between home and the workplace.
Given this evolving context, the present study aimed to identify risk factors associated with
workaholism, and to enrich the existing literature in several ways. Previous workaholism
research has often used invalid measures, small samples, and insufficient theoretical frame-
works [1,6,7]. In this study, a contemporary theoretical framework of addiction to conceptual-
ize workaholism was applied, and validated scales were utilized to investigate whether several
psychiatric symptoms were related to workaholism among a large sample of employees.
The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
reconceptualized addictive behavior to include behavioral addictions akin to more traditional
drug addictions [8]. Two profound changes were made: (i) Gambling Disorder (formerly path-
ological gambling) was reclassified as a behavioral addiction rather than a disorder of impulse
control [9], (ii) and Internet Gaming Disorder was introduced into Section 3 of the DSM-5
(Emerging Measures and Models) [8]. However, at present, although these changes represent a
substantial recognition of behavioral addictions in general, most potentially addictive behav-
iors are not yet formally defined as such–including workaholism.
As the line between excessive enthusiasm and a genuine addiction is difficult to define,
scholars have typically used specific criteria to define the border between addictive and non-
addictive behavior [10]. These criteria involve being totally preoccupied by work (salience),
using work to alleviate emotional stress (mood modification), gradually working longer and
longer hours to get the same mood modifying effects (tolerance), suffering emotional and phys-
ical distress if unable to work (withdrawal), sacrificing other obligations (personal relationships
with partner and children, social activities, exercising, etc.) because of work (conflict), desiring
or attempting to control the number of hours spent working without success (relapse), and suf-
fering some kind of harm or negative consequence as either a direct or indirect result of the
excessive working (problems) [11,12]. Because previous workaholism scales did not cover
these addiction components, the seven-item Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS) was specif-
ically developed in order to assess this behavior using the same criteria as other addictions [13].
Consequently, the BWAS is based on and embedded within general addiction theory [10], and
has demonstrated robust psychometric properties across studies in different countries [13–15].
Via mobile technology hardware, work is highly accessible to anyone and anywhere, and
has the potential to facilitate and enhance workaholism tendencies [16,17]. However, there has
been a perceivable paucity in the number of reliable prevalence estimates of workaholism. Sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses tentatively report estimates from 5% to over 25% [14,18].
According to a recent (and, to date, only) nationally representative study of Norwegian work-
ers, 8.3% were categorized as workaholics [14]. Research has also shown that age is inversely
related to workaholism [14,19]. Although a few studies have reported gender differences
[20,21], workaholism appears to be unrelated to both gender and marital status [2,14,19].
Research has further demonstrated that higher education and having managerial duties are
associated with workaholism [13,19,20,22,23]. A few studies have reported higher levels of
workaholism in certain lines of work (e.g., commercial trade, agriculture, medicine, communi-
cation, consultancy, etc.) as well as sectors (private and self-employment) [19,20,22–24]. For

 some, workaholism has been described as a money disorder [25], and one study associated it
with having a higher income [20]. This has good face validity because working hard usually
means increased salary/earnings. Given these findings, it is expected that younger, well-edu-
cated workers, in self-employed and private sector, with managerial responsibilities and higher
income will report higher scores on the Bergen Work Addiction Scale in the present study
(Hypothesis 1).
Research have consistently demonstrated that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) increases the risk of various chemical and non-chemical addictions [26]. However,
this psychiatric disorder has never been empirically examined (or theoretically associated with)
workaholism. ADHD is prevalent in 2.5–5% of the adult population, and is typically mani-
fested by inattentiveness and lack of focus, and/or impulsivity, and excessive physical activity
[8,26]. Individuals with ADHD may often stop working due to their disorder, and may have
trouble in getting work health insurance as they are regarded as a risk group [26]. For this rea-
son, the present authors hypothesize that individuals with ADHD may compensate for this by
over-working to meet the expectations required to hold down a job. Although this is a conten-
tious issue, there are a number of reasons why ADHD may be relevant to workaholism.
Firstly, the present authors argue that the inattentive nature of individuals with ADHD
causes them to spend time beyond the typical working day (i.e., evenings and weekends) to
accomplish what is done by their fellow employees within normal working hours (i.e., the com-
pensation hypothesis). In addition, as they may have a hard time concentrating while at work
due to environmental noise and distractions (especially office work in open landscape environ-
ments), they might find it easier to work after co-workers have left their working environment
or work from home. Their attentive shortcomings may also cause them to overly check for
errors on the tasks given, since they often experience careless mistakes due to their inattentive-
ness [26]. This may cause a cycle of procrastination, work binges, exhaustion, and–in some
cases–a fear of imperfection. Although ADHD is associated with lack of focus, such individuals
often have the ability to hyper-focus once they find something interesting–often being unable
to detach themselves from the task (e.g., flow) [27,28].
Secondly, the present authors’ argue that the impulsive nature of individuals with ADHD
causes them to say ‘yes’ and taking on many tasks without them thinking ahead, and taking on
more work than they can realistically handle–eventually leading to workaholic levels of activity.
Thirdly, it is also argued that the hyperactive nature of individuals with ADHD and the need to
be constantly active without being able to relax, causes such individuals to keep on working in
an attempt to alleviate their restless thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, work stress might
act as a stimulant, and they may choose active (and often multiple) jobs with high pressure,
deadlines and activity (e.g., media, sales, restaurant work)–where they have the opportunity
to multitask and constantly shift between tasks (e.g., Type-A personality behavior) [26,29].
In line with this, Type-A personality has often been associated–and sometimes used inter-
changeably–with workaholism in previous research [2,30]. This line of reasoning also relates
to the workaholic type portrayed by Robinson [31], in which he actually denoted “attention-defi-
cit workaholics” (who tend to start many projects but become bored easily and need to be stimu-
lated at all times). His description of the “relentless” type also corresponds well with ADHD
symptoms (i.e., unstoppable in working fast and meeting deadlines, often with many projects
going on simultaneously). In other words, these types may utilize work pressure to obtain focus,
constantly seeking stimulation, crisis, and excitement–and therefore like risky jobs.
Finally, people with ADHD are often mistaken as being lazy, irresponsible, or unintelligent
because of their difficulties with planning, time management, organizing, and decision-making
[26]. Feeling misunderstood might cause individuals with ADHD to push themselves to prove
these misconceptions as wrong–and resulting in an excessive and/or compulsive working

 pattern. Such individuals are often intelligent, but may feel forced or motivated to start up their
own business (i.e., entrepreneurs), as they find it troubling to adjust to standard work schedules
or organizational boundaries. Previous research has highlighted that workaholism is prevalent
among entrepreneurs and the self-employed [24,32]. Often failing in other aspects of life (e.g.,
family) [26], work for such individuals may become even more important to them (e.g., self-
efficacy). In accord with the aforementioned line of reasoning and findings, it is hypothesized
that ADHD symptoms will be positively associated with workaholism in the present study
(Hypothesis 2).
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is another underlying psychiatric disorder that
increases the likelihood of developing an addiction [33]. Full-blown OCD occurs in approxi-
mately 2–3% of children and adults, and is commonly manifested by intrusive thoughts and
repetitive behaviors of checking, obsessing, ordering, hoarding, washing, and/or neutralizing
[8,34,35]. It has been suggested that addictive behaviors might represent a coping and/or
escape mechanism of OCD symptoms, or as an OCD-behavior that eventually becomes an
addiction in itself [36]. Previous workaholic typologies have incorporated the “compulsive-
dependent” and “perfectionistic” types [37], and some empirical studies have demonstrated
that obsessive-compulsive traits are present among workaholics [2,38,39]. The OCD tendency
of having the need to arrange things in a certain way (i.e., a strong need for control) and obsess-
ing over details to the point of paralysis–may predispose workers with such traits to develop
workaholic working patterns [31,37,40,41]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that OCD symptoms
will be positively related to workaholism in the present study (Hypothesis 3).
Other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression may also increase the risk of
developing an addiction [33]. Approximately 30% of people will suffer from an anxiety disor-
der in their lifetime, and 20% will have at least one episode of depression [34,35]. These condi-
tions often occur simultaneously, as most people who are depressed also experience acute
anxiety [36]. Anxiety and/or depression can lead to addiction, and vice versa [36]. A number of
studies have previously reported a link between anxiety, depression, and workaholism
[2,7,42,43]. Furthermore, it is known that workaholism (in some instances) develops as an
attempt to reduce uncomfortable feelings of anxiety and depression. Working hard is praised
and honored in modern society, and thus serves as a legitimate behavior for individuals to
combat or alleviate negative feelings–and to feel better about themselves and raise their self-
esteem [10,11]. Consequently, it is hypothesized that there will be a positive association
between anxiety, depression, and workaholism (Hypothesis 4). Against this background, data
were analyzed from a large sample in order to investigate whether individual and work-related
demographics and psychiatric symptoms in terms of ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression
could predict workaholism (Hypotheses 1–4).
Methods
Procedure
A link to a cross-sectional survey was published in the online editions of five national Norwegian
newspapers during the first half of 2014. Participants were informed about the study before provid-
ing their answers, and that they were offered instant feedback about their personal workaholism
score in return for their participation. Since all data were gathered anonymously and no interven-
tion was performed, signed consent is not demanded according to Norwegian legislation. All
responses were saved on a server managed by a specialized survey agency (i.e., www.surveyxact.
no). The data were forwarded to the research team after the survey had been promoted for about a
week on each newspaper website. Only completed surveys were retained in the final data file. The
ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and the Norwegian Health Research Act

(11 alternatives from 1 = 0–99.999 to 11 = 1 million NOK or more) were asked. Participants
were also asked to endorse one of several fixed response alternatives regarding primary occupa-
tional status: 1 = working full-time, 2 = working part-time (followed by an open field for add-
ing specific percentage of full-time equivalent), 3 = retired, 4 = student, 5 = disability pension,
6 = work assessment allowance, 7 = unemployed, 8 = homemaker, 9 = other. Only participants
endorsing for working full-time or part-time were included in the present study.
Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS).
This scale contains seven items reflecting core
addiction elements [13] (i.e., salience, conflict, mood modification, withdrawal, tolerance,
problems, and relapse) [10]. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale ranging from never
(1) to always (5), thus yielding a score from 7 to 35, and concerns experiences during the past
year (e.g., “How often during the last year have you worked so much that it has negatively
influenced your health?” or “. . .experienced that others have told you to cut down on work
without listening to them?”). High scores indicate having workaholism symptoms. Scoring 4
(often) or 5 (always) on four out of seven criteria indicates workaholism. This polythetic cut-
off for categorization has been validated in previous research [13–15]. The Cronbach’s alpha
for the BWAS was .86 in the present study.
Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-Version 1.1). This scale comprises 18 questions
(six main items in part A, and 12 additional items in part B) or symptoms of ADHD in adults
[44], based on DSM criteria [9]. All items are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from never
(1) to very often (5), yielding an overall score from 18 to 90 (e.g., “How often do you have trou-
ble wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done?” or
“How often do you have difficulty unwinding and relaxing when you have time to yourself?”).
High scores indicate having ADHD symptoms. Scoring 3 (sometimes) or more on item 1–3
and 4 (often) or more on item 4–6 in part A indicates clinical levels of ADHD. Cronbach’s
alpha for the ASRS-v1.1 was .86 in the present study.
Obsession-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R).
This scale comprises 18 items
assessing six common OCD symptoms [45]. These include checking (e.g., “I repeatedly check
doors, windows, draws, etc.”), ordering (e.g., “I need thing to be arranged in a particular way”),
neutralizing (e.g., “I feel compelled to count while I am doing things”), washing (e.g., “I some-
times have to wash or clean myself simply because I feel contaminated”), obsessing (e.g., “I find
it difficult to control my own thoughts”), and hoarding (e.g., “I avoid throwing things away
because I am afraid I might need them later”). All items are answered on a 5-point scale from
not at all (0) to extremely (4). High scores indicate being bothered by OCD symptoms. Cut-
score for clinical levels of OCD is set to 22 or more for the whole scale. The Cronbach’s alphas
for the six subscales of the OCI-R in the present study were .72, .79, .65, .62, .84, and .77,
respectively (.86 for the whole scale).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
This 14-item two-factor scale measures
non-vegetative symptoms of anxiety (HADS-Anxiety) and depression (HADS-Depression)
[46,47]. Seven items assess levels of anxiety (e.g., “Worrying thoughts go through my mind”),
and seven items assess levels of depression (e.g., “I have lost interest in my appearance”). All
items are answered along a 4-point frequency scale ranging from 0 to 3. Cut-score set to 11 or
more suggests at least moderate levels of anxiety and depression, and was used in the present
study [46]. Cronbach’s alphas for HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression in the present study
were .81 and .73, respectively.

 Statistics
Firstly, descriptive statistics in terms of internal consistencies, means, and standard deviations
were calculated. The prevalence of workaholism was calculated (in accordance with the poly-
thetic criterion), as well as how many workaholics who met the screening cut-off for borderline
to clinical levels of OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and depression.
Secondly, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated in order to
assess the interrelationships between the composite scores of the study scales. In order to better
facilitate the practical significance and interpretation of results, both statistical tests for signifi-
cance (p values) and effect sizes (strengths of associations) were evaluated. According to con-
vention, small, medium and large effect sizes correspond to correlation coefficients (r) of .1, .3
and .5, respectively. (This rule of thumb also applies for ß coefficients in regressions [48]).
Following this, a linear multiple hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. Socio-
demographic variables and measures of psychiatric symptoms (continuous scores) were
regressed upon the composite workaholism score. Basic demographic variables (age, gender,
relationship status, and education) were entered in the first step. Work-related variables (work
status, position, sector, and gross income) were entered in the second step of the regression
analysis. Measures of mental health variables (ADHD, OCD (washing, obsessing, hoarding,
ordering, checking, and neutralizing), anxiety, and depression) were entered in the third and
final step of the regression analysis. For the variables of education, position, and sector
(dummy coded), the largest group comprised the reference category (i.e., Bachelor’s degree,
non-manager position, and private sector). According to common effect sizes indices, multiple
regression coefficients (R2) of about .02, .13 and .26 were benchmarked as small, medium and
large effects, respectively (i.e., Cohen’s f2 (R2/1-R2) of .02, .15 and .35) [48].
Additionally, logistic (crude and adjusted) regression analyses were carried out, where
workaholism (0 = non-workaholic, 1 = workaholic) comprised the dependent variable, and
where socio-demographics and the psychiatric symptoms (ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression),
the latter dichotomized according to the aforementioned cut-offs, comprised the independent
variables. In the crude analyses, each of the independent variables was entered separately,
exploring the bivariate association between the independent and the dependent variable. In the
adjusted analysis, all the independent variables were entered simultaneously, exploring the
multivariate associations between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The
odds ratio (OR) can be considered as significant when the 95% confidence interval (CI) does
not include 1.00.
Preliminary analyses ensured that there was no violation of the assumptions of normality,
linearity, multicollinerarity (tolerance over .10 and VIF under 5), and homoscedasticity. The
dataset is available as a Data S1 File.
Results
Group differences
The prevalence of workaholism in the current sample was estimated to 7.8% (n = 1,287) when
using a polythetic approach (i.e., scoring 4 (often) or 5 (always) on at least four of the seven
items); and 0.7% (n = 114) when using a monothetic approach (i.e., scoring 4 or 5 on all seven
items). The polythetic approach is in line with modern psychiatric nosology. Using the poly-
thetic acoring of the individuals classified as workaholics, the following results were found:
32.7% (n = 421) met the screening cut off for clinical levels of ADHD, whereas 12.7% of non-
workaholics met the clinical ADHD-level (χ2
df = 1, N = 16426 = 389.33, p < .001); 25.6%
(n = 329) met the clinical levels for OCD (8.7% of non-workaholics) (χ2

 369.31, p < .001); 33.8% (n = 435) met the clinical levels for anxiety (11.9% of non-workahol-
ics) (χ2
df = 1, N = 16426 = 481.58, p < .001); and 8.9% (n = 114) met the clinical levels for depres-
sion (2.6% for non-workaholics) (χ2
df = 1, N = 16426 = 150.95, p < .001). Hence, there were
significant differences between workaholics and non-workaholics on all four clinical states.
Correlations and descriptive statistics
Table 2 displays mean scores and standard deviations for study variables and their interrela-
tionships. Overall, the internal consistencies for the study scales met satisfactory standards.
Two of the OCD subscales (washing and neutralizing) had arguably low Cronbach’s alphas
(.62 and .65), but should be noted that these comprised only three items. Furthermore, there
were positive and significant correlations between all study scales, ranging from .16 to .59 (i.e.,
from small to large effect sizes). Workaholism displayed coefficients between .16 (washing)
(i.e., small effect size) and .36 (ADHD) (i.e., medium to large effect size), having the strongest
association with ADHD, anxiety (.34), obsessing (.26), and depression (.23).
Regression analyses
The results from the linear hierarchical regression analysis are presented in Table 3. Individual
demographics (age, gender, relationship status, and level of completed education) were entered
at Step 1, and only explained 1.2% of the variance in workaholism (F7,16418 = 29.62, p < .001),
with an f2 of .01 (i.e., insubstantial effect). Age (ß = -.09), relationship status (ß = .02), high
school (ß = -.02), vocational school (ß = -.03), and Master/PhD (ß = .05) contributed signifi-
cantly to this step. Age and higher education contributed the most.
Work demographics (work status, position, sector, and annual gross income) entered at
Step 2, additionally explained 5.4% of the variance, ΔR2 = .054, ΔF7,16411 = 135.58, p < .001,
with an f2 of .06 (i.e., small effect). Top- and mid-level manager positions contributed the most
among the work variables. After controlling for work demographics, age (ß = -.15), gender

 management (ß = .16), mid-level management (ß = .15), other managerial duties (ß = .09),
public sector (ß = -.03), franchise/self-employment (ß = .04), and income (ß = .09) contributed
significantly to this step. The overall effect of individual and work demographics on workahol-
ism was still relatively small (f2 = .07).
Psychiatric symptoms (ADHD, OCD symptoms, anxiety, and depression) entered at Step 3
explained 17.0% of the variance, ΔR2 = .170, ΔF9,16402 = 406.73, p < .001. ADHD and anxiety
contributed the most, and the psychiatric variables had a much more substantial effect on
workaholism (f2 = .21; medium effect size). Following entry of all independent variables at Step
3, the total variance explained by the model as a whole was 23.7%, F23,16402 = 221.25, p < .001,
with an f2 of .31, which is considered as a large effect. In the final model, age (ß = -.08) and
vocational school (ß = -.02) were negatively associated with workaholism, while gender (being
female, ß = .08), relationship status (being single, ß = .04), having a Master’s/PhD (ß = .03),
top-level management (ß = .16), mid-level management (ß = .15), other managerial duties
(ß = .09), franchise/self-employment (ß = .03), high income (ß = .11), ADHD (ß = .20), wash-
ing (ß = .04), hoarding (ß = .07), ordering (ß = .05), neutralizing (ß = .04), anxiety (ß = .17),
and depression (ß = .06), were all positively associated with scores on workaholism. Overall,
the effect sizes for each variable were relatively small–except for ADHD and anxiety, displaying
coefficients (ß) that may be considered as medium-sized effects.

 dummy coded variables (i.e., education (Bachelor’s degree), position (non-manager), and sec-
tor (private)), the largest group comprised the reference for which the OR is set to 1.00. In both
the crude and adjusted analyses, workaholism cases were inversely related to age, but positively
related to being female, single status, manager positions, self-employment, and clinical levels
on all four psychiatric variables. Income was unrelated to workaholism in the crude analysis,
but became positively and significant in the adjusted analysis. On the other hand, workaholism
was inversely related to public sector in the crude analysis, but did not remain significant when
controlling for the other variables in the adjusted analysis. Of note, workaholism was unrelated
to education and work status (full-time vs. part-time employment) in both analyses.
The full model containing all predictors (adjusted analysis) was statistically significant
(χ2
df = 18, N = 16426 = 1029.08, p < .001). Furthermore, the model as a whole explained between
6.1% (Cox and Snell R square) and 14.4% (Nagelkerke R Squared) of the variance in workahol-
ism status and correctly classified 92.2% of all cases. In the final model the proportion of cor-
rected classified cases did not increase from the null model.
Discussion
The present large-scale study substantially extends the literature on work addiction by investi-
gating the associations between workaholism and different symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
The results, involving self-ratings from more than 16,400 adults, were derived from one of the
largest surveys ever undertaken in the area (based on number of participants). Taken together,
the symptoms of ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression contributed significantly to the vari-
ance in workaholism (17%)–after controlling for socio-demographics, which alone explained
6.6% of the variance in the linear hierarchical multiple regression model. The prevalence of
workaholism in this sample was estimated to be 7.8%, and is in accordance with recent estima-
tion (8.3%) in a nationally representative sample of Norwegian employees [14], and appears to
be similar to the 10% estimate presented in a comprehensive review [18]. Workaholics scored
significantly higher on clinical levels of all psychiatric symptoms than non-workaholics.
Although the following discussion will focus on the results from the final step of the hierarchi-
cal regression, and the results regarding the categorical clinical independent variables in the
adjusted logistic regression analysis, the section begins with a short evaluation of findings con-
cerning workaholism and socio-demographic variables.
Individual and work-related demographics and workaholism
Workaholism was associated with specific characteristics. In general, younger, being single,
highly educated people with higher socioeconomic status tended to report higher levels of
workaholism than their comparison groups. Workaholism was also more prevalent among
managers, self-employed, and people working in private sector, compared to non-managers,
and public sector. These results were for the most part expected (Hypothesis 1), and concur
with results from the few previous studies examining similar variables [2,13,14,19,20,22,23,39].
Although education contributed positively in the linear regression, especially before entering
work and psychiatric variables, it did not influence workaholism cases in the logistic regression
analyses. No effect of gender was found in the initial step of the linear regression analysis, again
confirming the findings of previous research [2,14,19]. However, in both the final step of the
linear regression analysis and in the adjusted logistic regression analysis being female was sig-
nificantly associated with workaholism. This might reflect that women might have higher
ambitions than men and the result is in line with studies showing that (in recent years) women
now outperform men regarding grades in higher education in Norway [49]. Although previous
research has primarily reported workaholism to be unrelated to relationship status [20], in the

 present study an association was found in both the linear and the logistic regression analysis,
that individuals not in a relationship were more likely to be workaholics. One possible explana-
tion may be that workaholics avoid or break off relationships, or their partners leave them, due
to their excessive working.
Overall, the results of the present study indicate that specific socio-demographic groups
may be at risk of developing workaholism. However, the results may also reflect that workahol-
ics choose positions, jobs, and/or sectors that allow them to engage in their preferred day-to-
day working practices. The growing body of research tends to show that workaholism affects
younger (rather than older) adults. This might be interpreted as a cohort-effects suggesting
that workaholism is on the rise. Alternatively, it may reflect an age-effect suggesting that prob-
lems with workaholism decrease as the person becomes more mature [14]. However, it might
simply reflect adjustments people make or are forced to make (e.g., poorer health) and obliga-
tions that come with age (e.g., having a family). This is in line with a recent longitudinal study
showing that workaholism decreased during a person’s career [50], as well as the current find-
ings indicating that people in a relationship are slightly less likely to experience workaholism
than those who are single. The presence or absence of children within a relationship may also
be a factor. However, a recent study reported that workaholism did not differ according to the
number of children [51]. Of note, the explained variance by individual (1.2%) and work demo-
graphics (5.4%) was very small in the linear regression, thus having no practical implications,
beyond age and leadership positions.
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and workaholism
Symptoms of ADHD were positively related to workaholism, and had a slightly greater effect
on workaholism than the other psychiatric symptoms in both the correlation and linear regres-
sion analyses. The logistic regressions also showed high odds ratios for workaholism among
those categorized with clinical levels of ADHD. Among workaholics, 32.7% met the screening
cut-off for clinical ADHD levels. These findings are in line with established knowledge of the
co-occurrence of ADHD and addictions in general [26], although the present study is the first
ever to associate work addiction with ADHD, thus providing support for the second hypothe-
sis. Although ADHD is often associated with unemployment and being unable to conduct nor-
mal work [26], the present authors’ hypothesized that ADHD would be related to workaholism
partly for this very same reason. Individuals with ADHD may have to work harder and longer
to compensate for their work behavior caused by neurological deficits. They may also be at risk
of taking on projects and tasks impulsively–resulting in more work than they can realistically
do within normal working hours. Some, but far from all, with this disorder are also very hyper-
active [8,26]. Hence they may choose and thrive better in jobs with frequent deadlines and
higher levels of work stress, conditions that may alleviate their inner restlessness (e.g., self-
medication).
The present authors also propose that such people are unable to relax, and may keep on
working nonstop–if they find a task interesting and demanding enough (e.g., hyper-focus).
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that these workaholic ADHD types push themselves in their
job in order to disprove conceptions of them by others as being lazy or unintelligent. History
portrays many highly successful entertainers, inventors and entrepreneurs, authors and scien-
tists as well as business leaders with ADHD traits–often associated with hard working talent
and abundant creativity [52]. Given that the first academic writings on workaholism appeared
in the early 1970s [53], it is arguably surprising that the present study is the very first that
empirically link symptoms of ADHD with workaholism. This may be because ADHD is often
thought of as a child disorder from which sufferers grow out of before reaching adulthood [26].

 This is now known not to be the case, and ADHD is probably under-diagnosed in adults [26].
Instead, such adult individuals are often diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression,
borderline personality disorder, etc. [26]. The current findings are also in accordance with sev-
eral popular workaholic typologies portrayed in recent years [31].
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and workaholism
All OCD symptoms were positively related to workaholism in the correlation analysis. How-
ever, after controlling for all other study variables, the associations changed both in magnitude
and direction in the linear regression analysis. Washing, hoarding, ordering, and neutralizing,
were still positively related to workaholism, whereas obsessing and checking became non-sig-
nificant. Together, the association between OCD symptoms on workaholism was relatively
weak overall. Among workaholics, 25.6% met the screening cut off for clinical levels of OCD
and in the adjusted logistic regression analysis those scoring above the OCD-cutoff had a sig-
nificant and elevated risk of being categorized as workaholics. Taken together, the study’s third
hypothesis received some support although some findings regarding particular OCD-symp-
toms were not in line with the hypothesis.
Why obsessing did not contribute positively to the linear regression model is difficult to
explain, as many scholars believe obsession is a critical component in defining workaholism
[54] and obsession can play a major role in the developing of addictions more generally [10].
Obsessive checking was also expected to (at least in part) explain workaholism, as controlling
and checking have been regarded by some scholars as central aspects of workaholism [55].
However, this also turned out non-significant in the linear regression analysis. One explanation
for the unexpected findings regarding obsessing and checking may be related to the other vari-
ables included in the analyses which may have caused inhibition effects due to the positive cor-
relation between all the independent variables. Despite these partly unexpected findings, OCD
symptoms were generally positively related to workaholism (i.e., four out of six subscales) in
the linear regression as well as significantly related to workaholism in the logistic regression
analysis. These findings are also in line with previous workaholic typologies [31,37] and previ-
ously empirically demonstrated relationships [2,30,40].
Anxiety and depression and workaholism
Both anxiety and depression were positively related to workaholism in the correlation analysis,
as well in the both regression analyses–lending support to the fourth hypothesis and are in
keeping with previous research [2,42,43]. However, anxiety only had a small effect on worka-
holism in the linear regression analysis, whereas depression demonstrated a trivial effect. This
may suggest that there are few significant practical implications. Nevertheless, scoring above
clinical cut-offs for anxiety and depression was clearly related to workaholism in the logistic
regression analysis. These findings are in agreement with the fact that addictive behaviors,
depression, and anxiety often co-occur [33,36].
The results perhaps suggest that workaholics are more anxious than depressed. Among work-
aholics, 33.8% met the screening cut-off for borderline or clinical anxiety level, whereas the corre-
sponding percentage for clinical levels of depression was 8.9%. Workaholism has also previously
been linked to the personality trait of neuroticism (e.g., being anxious, fearful, moody) [14,22].
People with high scores on this trait often handle stressors poorly [56]. Consequently, quite ordi-
nary work tasks and working situations may be perceived as threatening and overwhelming, thus
motivating anxious individuals to cope with these threats by allocating extra time and effort to
task completion. Therefore, the present authors propose that working may act as an escape
mechanism related to feelings of anxiety and depression [10,36]. Another explanation for the
Workaholism and Psychiatric Symptoms

 findings could also be that anxious people fear failing (and go over their work several times) and/
or decline incoming tasks (overload), whereas depressed people work slower (due to low energy
level) and have to compensate by working longer hours to get the work done.
Practical implications
In the present study, several potential risk factors for workaholism were identified that suggest
some practical implications. Firstly, organizational interventions should aim to prevent and
help young adults and managers in how to suppress and inhibit workaholic tendencies and
maintain a positive ‘work-life’ balance. This is particularly important in areas with an excessive
work climate, as studies have shown that both personal and organizational characteristics–as
well as cultural characteristics–are involved when workaholics are “made” [23,39,40,57].
Although workaholism has become an increasingly studied area for empirical investigation
over the last decade, clinical interventions are still few and far between [6]. However, interven-
tions using approaches in line with validated therapies for addictions in general may be feasible
[58]. Such approaches typically involve a collection of self-help techniques, psychotherapies,
and pharmacological assistance [58]. Relevant interventions may thus involve cognitive-behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques–the two most commonly
utilized counseling approaches for a broad spectrum of addictions. CBT aims to single out
thoughts and emotions that trigger and activate workaholic behavior, and replace these with a
more sufficient mindset [59]. Training in stress and time management to better cope with dis-
tress and fight-and-flight states may also be helpful (e.g., relaxation techniques, mindfulness
meditation) [32,60,61]. MI aims to awakening inner motivation to pursue positive behavioral
changes from the workaholic. For this purpose, the therapist typically uses a set of communica-
tion techniques to uncover and dissolve ambivalence. The method seeks to engage the worka-
holic, bring out change talk, and induce motivation to change current behavior [62].
Secondly, the present study highlights the relevance of further investigating underlying
neurobiological deviations related to the workaholic behavior–as significantly more workahol-
ics met the clinical levels of ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression than their non-workaholics
counterparts. If there are biological bases to the addiction, medication might be an option.
Some research has indicated that specific medications (e.g., Bupropion, Escitalopram, Methyl-
phenidate) are useful in treating other behavioral addictions [63–66].
As very little empirical focus has been on adult ADHD, practitioners have often relied on
diagnostic criteria for children found in the DSM-IV [9,26]. One criterion is that the symptoms
must cause some impairment in two or more settings (e.g., home and school). Another is that
there must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, and/or
occupational functioning [8]. Still, it is unlikely that many workaholics are being screened for
ADHD [26]. However, it is not unthinkable that for workaholics with ADD (inattentive type),
work is the only area of their lives they master–with significant impairment of all other life
domains (e.g., household, relationships, health and well-being) (e.g., criteria of two or more
impaired domains). Handling a job is crucial in most cultures–therefore, this type of ADD
affected worker may struggle to fulfill this highly visible sociocultural function, spending much
time and energy to accomplish work (that is expected) that others get done within normal
working hours. In line with this, previous research has shown that workaholism is associated
with impaired job performance [4,5]. Furthermore, a workaholic with ADHD (hyperactive/
impulsive type) might end up in jobs involving extreme pressure, such as a foreign journalist in
a war zone. Sadly, due to overlooked ADHD symptoms by physicians, some of these individu-
als may be missing out of living a full life–as they often are left with work-life conflicts, trou-
bling social lives, chaotic domestic lives, and poorer performance than they with professional

 help might otherwise have had [26]. Fortunately, DSM-5 [8] combats this by refining ADHD
criteria to include adult symptoms.
Clearly, more research is warranted to elucidate these important relationships further. In
the meantime, it is recommended that physicians and therapists should not take for granted
that a seemingly successful workaholic do not have ADHD-related clinical features. However,
more research is needed to examine whether workaholism is totally negative for all individuals
as it may be that workaholism may serve an important structuring function for those with
mental health problems and those with social dysfunction.
Strengths and limitations
The present study is not without some limitations. Due to the very large sample size and statisti-
cal power to the analyses, some trivial relationships may have turned out significant. For exam-
ple, at Step 1 in the linear regression analyses, only 1.2% of the variance was explained. To better
enable researchers to draw conclusions regarding whether or not the effects are nontrivial in size,
effect sizes were also calculated and reported. Thus, instead of only reporting the statistical signif-
icance, the focus on effect sizes may facilitate and communicate the more practical significance of
the study’s findings. Another limitation concerns the cross-sectional design, as directionality and
causality cannot be established. It is also possible that workaholism may predict inattention, anxi-
ety and depressive symptoms. Hence, the relationships between anxiety, depression and worka-
holism, in particular, may well be the reverse than that portrayed in the present study [36]. The
directionality between study variables would be revealed by the use of longitudinal study designs
in the future although such designs are often very resource demanding.
Additionally, as all data collected in the present study relied on self-report, common method
biases may have affected the results [67] including recall biases and social desirability biases.
Another limitation of the present study involved the open web-based convenient sampling
methodology. Consequently, nothing is known about non-responders of this self-selecting
sample, and the survey might have attracted or repelled specific groups or individuals. For
example, there was a higher proportion of women in the present sample, and therefore self-
selection might have influenced the findings.
Overall, this puts limitations on the generalizability of the findings to other populations
both within and outside of Norway–making it inapplicable to estimate population characteris-
tics. Regardless of such limitations, the present study is considered suitable for estimations of
relationships between characteristics and variables under investigation [68]. Another potential
limitation concerns the fact that some participants might not have taken their participation
seriously and provided random answers. However, the reliability indexes suggest that the scales
overall appeared to have been completed consistently.
In terms of strengths, the present study had a large sample size, providing a high level of statis-
tical power to the analyses. Although ADHD has previously been linked to several other addic-
tions [26] the present study is the very first that empirically links ADHD with workaholism. The
combination of variables included in the present study is also new to the field. Also, all the scales
used in the present study were internally consistent at large, previously validated, and psychomet-
rically robust. Furthermore, they were embedded within contemporary addiction theories
[10,13,14,44, 45,47]. Finally, it should be noted that the newspapers that published the survey
represent very different reader groups, and they are nationwide instead of more localized ones.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that having symptoms of an underlying psychiatric disorder is asso-
ciated with workaholism. A synthesis of individual (1.2%), work-related (5.4%), and mental

 health (17.0%) variables, explained 23.7% of the variance in workaholism, which is considered
a large effect. ADHD, anxiety, lower age, and managerial positions stood out as most consistent
and conceptually meaningful in the linear regression. Although gender, relationship status,
education, work sector, income, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression also contrib-
uted significantly, their effects were weaker and more inconsistent across the steps in the
regression model.
According to recommended cut-offs, 7.8% of the present sample was classified as workahol-
ics. Following this, it became evident that individuals that were younger, female, not in a rela-
tionship, managers, self-employed, and met clinical cut-offs for ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and
depression, were more often categorized as workaholics than their comparison groups. Work-
ers with some of these characteristics could thus be targets for interventions with the aim of
preventing the development and maintenance of workaholism. More research preferably using
representative and clinical samples, on this poorly studied relationship between workaholism
and psychiatric disorder symptoms is clearly needed.
