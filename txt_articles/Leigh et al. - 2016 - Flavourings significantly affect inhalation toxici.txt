Abstract
Background—E-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are designed to 
deliver nicotine-containing aerosol via inhalation. Little is known about the health effects of 
flavored ENDS aerosol when inhaled.
Methods—Aerosol from ENDS was generated using a smoking-machine. Various types of 
ENDS devices or a tank system prefilled with liquids of different flavors, nicotine carrier, variable 
nicotine concentrations, and with modified battery output voltage were tested. A convenience 
sample of commercial fluids with flavor names of tobacco, piña colada, menthol, coffee and 
strawberry were used. Flavoring chemicals were identified using gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry. H292 human bronchial epithelial cells were directly exposed to 55 puffs of freshly-
generated ENDS aerosol, tobacco smoke, or air (controls) using an air-liquid interface system and 
the Health Canada intense smoking protocol. The following in vitro toxicological effects were 
assessed: 1) cell viability, 2) metabolic activity and 3) release of inflammatory mediators 
(cytokines).
Results—Exposure to ENDS aerosol resulted in decreased metabolic activity and cell viability 
and increased release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL10 compared to air 
controls. Cell viability and metabolic activity were more adversely affected by conventional 
cigarettes than most tested ENDS products. Product type, battery output voltage, and flavors 
significantly affected toxicity of ENDS aerosol, with a strawberry-flavored product being the most 
cytotoxic.
Conclusions—Our data suggest that characteristics of ENDS products, including flavors, may 
induce inhalation toxicity. Therefore, ENDS users should use the products with caution until more 
comprehensive studies are performed.

BACKGROUND
Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are battery-powered, nicotine-delivery devices 
marketed as safer substitutes for traditional cigarettes.1 Although ENDS seem to be a 
promising harm reduction tool for smokers, findings indicate that use of these products can 
result in repeated inhalation of respiratory irritants and toxicants, with long-term users 
risking regular exposure. Chemical studies demonstrate that ENDS aerosol contains low 
levels of toxicants and carcinogens,2,3 though generally fewer than in conventional tobacco 
cigarettes. Toxicological and clinical studies on health effects of ENDS are lagging behind 
the rapid growth in their use by the public.4 This lack of studies also hampers regulatory 
action.5,6
The popular flavors among ENDS users include traditional flavors like tobacco or menthol, 
and non-traditional flavors like a fruit (e.g., cherry, berry, apple), sweet (e.g., chocolate, 
vanilla, desserts, candies), or a beverage (e.g., coffee, alcoholic drinks, soda).7,8 Hutzler et 
al.9 analyzed 28 ENDS liquids by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and identified 141 
different flavoring chemicals among them. Although many of the flavoring chemicals used 
in ENDS liquids have been certified as “generally recognized as safe” for ingestion by the 
Flavors Extracts Manufacturers Association, little is known about their effects when inhaled 
or heated in ENDS products.10 Farsalinos et al.11 evaluated sweet-flavored e-liquids for the 
presence of diacetyl and acetyl propionyl, which are chemicals approved for food use but are 
associated with respiratory disease when inhaled. Both compounds were detected in a large 
proportion of products, with many of them exposing users to higher than safe levels. 
Kosmider et al.3 examined benzaldehyde levels in aerosols generated from a wide range of 
flavored nicotine solutions and established that users of flavored ENDS are exposed to 
significant amounts of this respiratory irritant. Moreover, users of cherry-flavored products 
may inhale significantly higher doses of benzaldehyde compared to users of other flavored 
products.3
A recent report by Barrington-Trimis et al.12 outlined the need for research on flavor 
additives used in ENDS, noting the lack of safety data on long-term health effects from 
inhaling flavoring chemicals. There is a need to develop toxicological test models, which 
characterize the toxic response and cellular interaction between constituents of inhaled 
ENDS aerosol, including flavors, and the respiratory system. The extent to which variable 
product features, including flavorings, impact cellular responses is currently not well-
defined.
There have been generally few toxicological studies that investigated the cellular effects of 
exposure to ENDS aerosol. Those that have been done used a variety of cell types, including 
cardiomyoblasts and the lung epithelial cell line H292.11,13 Published studies seem to 
indicate either no or very little toxicity of ENDS,14 although other studies suggest potential

 oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.15-19 However, those studies only used a low-
voltage refillable tank system (eGo) or a single brand of disposable e-cigarette, neither of 
which contained various flavors. The potential effect that flavoring compounds may have on 
the respiratory cells of ENDS users is unclear. Behar et al.20 studied flavoring compounds in 
ENDS solutions and found differences in toxicity among flavors. The same group of 
researchers found that the cinnamon flavorings in refill fluids are linked to cytotoxicity, 
which could adversely affect ENDS users.20
Inhalation of complex mixtures like flavored ENDS aerosols can cause a wide range of 
adverse health effects, ranging from simple irritation to systemic diseases.21 Traditionally, 
inhalation toxicity has been performed on test animals to identify various end points 
including the lethal concentration of airborne materials or maximum tolerable concentration.
22 In vitro studies in which a solution of the aerosol ingredients is applied in the medium 
overlay do not model an inhalation exposure. They also may not be suitable for studying, for 
example, the effects of some poorly soluble flavoring compounds, like limonene. More 
recently, novel in vitro methods have been developed that allow the direct exposure of 
airborne material to cultured human target cells on permeable porous membranes at the air-
liquid interface (ALI). In ALI exposure systems, the cells are provided with nutrients from 
the basal side of the membrane while the apical side, with the cultivated cells, is in direct 
contact with the test aerosol. The effects of ENDS aerosols on respiratory cells cultured at 
the ALI can be used to study cell injury or activation and the release of bioactive mediators 
including cytokines. Therefore, in vitro studies using an ALI model open up new ways to 
test ENDS toxicity.23 We are aware of only one study published to date that used the ALI 
method to study ENDS toxicity.13 However, that study focused on pro-inflammatory effects 
of two ENDS, as measured by secretion of two inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), 
rather than cytotoxicity or metabolic activity. In our study, the physiologically relevant ALI 
system was used to individually and systematically evaluate in vitro effects of many of the 
variables related to ENDS products, including several of the most popular flavors. By testing 
different types and brands of ENDS products, along with product features on cell viability, 
cell metabolic activity, and inflammatory cytokine production in an ALI system, this study 
hopes to establish the impact of various product characteristics on potential inhalation 
toxicity of ENDS products.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ENDS products and reference cigarettes
ENDS devices and refill solutions were selected for study from a vast and rapidly changing 
array of products. Six types of ENDS were purchased from gas stations, convenience stores, 
online retailers, and local ‘vape’ shops in Buffalo, NY, Daly City, CA and online (Table 1). 
Refill solutions for tank systems in five flavors: tobacco, piña colada, menthol, coffee, and 
strawberry, were also purchased from a local ‘vape’ shop in Buffalo, NY (Table 1). Tobacco 
reference cigarettes 3R4F were obtained from the University of Kentucky.
In a pilot experiment, cells were exposed to six different ENDS products including a 
disposable e-cigarette, rechargeable e-cigarette, tank-type eGO device, a personal vaporizer, 
an ePipe and an eCigar (Table 1). In all subsequent experiments we used one type of ENDS

 device, specifically an eGo tank system (Vision Spinner), with battery output voltage fixed at 
3.3V. However, we systematically and individually modified product features by refilling the 
device with various carriers, with solutions of variable nicotine concentration, or solutions 
with different flavors. To compare the cellular toxicity of carriers, e-liquids containing 24 
mg/mL nicotine and without flavor were prepared in a lab using USP-grade ingredients in 
propylene glycol (PG)-only, vegetable glycerin (VG)-only, or a 50/50 mixture of PG/VG, 
along with 5% distilled water. To study the effects of nicotine concentration on bronchial 
epithelial cells, an eGo tank system was set to 3.3V and prefilled with PG-only unflavored 
solution that contained 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 mg/mL of nicotine. Nicotine concentrations in all 
tested products were determined using gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorous 
detector (GC-NPD), as described previously.24,25 To measure the effects of ENDS voltage 
on cellular toxicity, aerosols were generated from an eGo tank system filled with PG-only 
solution containing tobacco flavor and 24 mg/mL nicotine that was set to 3.3, 4.0 or 4.8V.
To study the effects of flavors, an eGo tank system set to 3.3V was prefilled with PG-only 
liquid containing the same nicotine concentration (24 mg/mL; labelled) but with various 
flavors (Table 2). Flavoring chemicals were identified in each liquid using a gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method, as described in Supplementary 
Materials. An untargeted analyte list was generated and included the 11 compounds listed in 
Table 2. Tobacco, piña colada, menthol, coffee and strawberry had the following GC-NPD 
determined nicotine concentrations: 23.0, 22.5, 22.0, 21.8 and 22.5 mg/mL, respectively 
(Table 2). No GC-NPD analysis was done of aerosols generated from the fluids.
Generation of ENDS aerosol
Aerosol from ENDS products, as well as tobacco smoke, was generated using a Borgwaldt 
LX-1 (Richmond, VA) single-port piston-operated smoking machine. The puffing protocol 
was based on the Health Canada Intense method26, using the following conditions: 3 sec 
puff duration, every 30 sec, with a 55-mL puff volume. The puffing protocol was 
implemented continuously for 30 minutes, resulting in a total of 55 puffs. Thirty minutes 
was utilized as this was the minimum exposure time examined in which we saw significant 
differences between ENDS aerosol and the air control (data not shown). Air-exposures 
(control) were run during each experiment, and five 3R4F reference tobacco cigarettes were 
smoked for comparison using the same method as for the ENDS products. In pilot studies, 
cells were exposed to air by two different methods: either we used a 12 psi constant supply 
of air for 30 min, or we drew air over the cells for 55 puffs (for a total of 30 min) using the 
smoking machine. No significant differences were found between methodologies. Therefore, 
we employed the smoking machine method to generate air controls for each experiment.
Cell exposure conditions
The NCI-H292 cell line (ATCC) was used for all experiments. A detailed description of the 
maintenance and propagation of H292 cells is provided in Supplementary Materials. This 
study used an air liquid interface (ALI) system that enables direct exposure of cells to ENDS 
aerosol (Supplemental Figure 1). Cells were grown on the apical side of 0.4 μm permeable 
supports (PS) under standard conditions for cell maintenance (described in Supplementary 
Materials). Immediately prior to exposure, the media was aspirated from the apical side of

 the PS, and cell-containing inserts (n=3) were placed in the ALI chamber. While the cells 
were directly exposed to ENDS aerosol, fresh media was cycled over the basal side of the PS 
at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. The ALI chamber was cleaned with methanol and distilled 
water between exposures.
Toxicity assays
Metabolic activity of exposed cells was measured by Neutral Red Uptake Assay. Cell 
viability was measured by Trypan Blue Assay. Cytokine release was measured as an 
indicator of cell inflammatory response. Seven, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL1, 
CXCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL10) were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. 
For all assays, we followed protocols provided by the manufacturer. Detailed descriptions of 
each assay are provided in Supplementary Materials. Note: CXCL5 levels measured were 
below the limit of quantitation for each tested condition. Thus, CXCL5 results are not 
presented.
Statistical analysis
Statistical Analysis was performed using Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad). Kruskal-Wallis 
non-parametric tests were performed for each study outcome to compare: 1) the mean rank 
of ENDS products vs. air controls 2) the mean rank of ENDS products vs. reference 
cigarettes; and 3) the mean rank of every ENDS product to other ENDS products excluding 
the air and reference cigarette controls. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate, 
with each outcome measured three times per experiment.
RESULTS
Aerosol generated from various types of ENDS products (disposable e-cigarette, 
rechargeable e-cigarette, eGo tank system, personal vaporizer, ePipe and eCigar) differed 
significantly in their toxicity to bronchial epithelial cells (Table 3A,B and Supplementary 
Table 1). Metabolic activity and viability of H292 cells significantly decreased (p<.05) after 
exposure to aerosols from the eGo tank system, personal vaporizer, and ePipe as compared 
to air control (Table 3A,B). A significant decrease in metabolic activity but not cell viability 
was observed between the air control and the blu rechargeable e-cigarette. Notably, some 
ENDS products tested in the study including the eGo tank system, personal vaporizer and 
ePipe did not differ significantly from tobacco cigarette in their effect on metabolic activity 
or cell viability. However, the disposable e-cigarette, rechargeable e-cigarette and eCigar 
products were significantly less toxic than tobacco cigarettes (Table 3A,B). When examining 
cytokine release upon exposure of H292 cells to ENDS aerosol, we found a significant 
increase in IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL1 for the rechargeable e-cigarette, as compared either to 
the air control or the reference tobacco cigarette. IL-6, IL10, CXCL1 and CXCL2 release 
were significantly different between the personal vaporizer and ePipe compared to air, as 
well as between the ePipe and the reference cigarette (Table 3A,B). Not all ENDS products 
were equivalent with regard to cytokine release. For example, the eGo product did not 
mediate a change in any of the tested cytokines. (Table 3A,B and Supplementary Table 1).

 The above-described pilot experiments confirmed our hypothesis that various ENDS 
products differ with regard to their cellular toxicity and cause different inflammatory 
reactions in cells directly exposed to aerosols. However, due to diversity of the products, we 
could not attribute toxic effects to a specific feature of each product. We therefore undertook 
a systematic study to determine how individual product features including flavors, nicotine 
carrier, nicotine concentration, and battery output voltage contribute to cellular toxicity and 
inflammatory responses in H292 cells.
Effect of flavors on ENDS aerosol toxicity
By exposing H292 cells to aerosols generated from the same device (eGo tank system with 
battery voltage set to 3.3V and filled with PG-only based liquids containing similar nicotine 
concentrations (labelled and verified with chromatography method)) but containing one of 
five different flavors: tobacco, piña colada, menthol, coffee or strawberry, we found that 
flavors have a significant and differential effect on in vitro toxicity. Most notably, menthol, 
coffee and strawberry-flavored aerosol significantly reduced both cell viability and 
metabolic activity compared to air controls (p<.05, Figure 1 and Table 3A,F). Interestingly, 
the effects of a strawberry-flavored aerosol on metabolic activity and cell viability were not 
significantly different from those obtained with tobacco cigarettes. Piña colada flavored 
aerosol had an intermediate effect: it decreased metabolic activity as compared to air 
controls but had no significant effect on cell viability. In contrast to other flavors, aerosol 
generated from tobacco flavored liquid did not alter either viability or metabolic activity 
compared to air controls and was significantly less toxic than tobacco smoke (p>.05).
When examining cytokine release, aerosols generated from coffee and strawberry-flavored 
liquids significantly increased cytokine levels compared to air controls (Figure 1 and Table 
3A,F) or reference cigarettes (Table 3A,F). Release of all tested cytokines except for IL-6 
was induced by the strawberry-flavored aerosol. Coffee-flavored aerosol increased cytokine 
levels of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2 compared to air-controls. As the only difference among 
the products tested in this experiment was the flavor in liquids, we conclude that: 1) flavors 
affects the in vitro toxicity profile of the product; and 2) among all tested flavors, the 
product labeled strawberry was most toxic.
Effects of nicotine concentration, carrier, and battery output voltage on ENDS aerosol 
toxicity
Nicotine concentration—Five nicotine concentrations were examined: 0, 6, 12, 18 and 
24 mg/mL. No significant differences (p<.05) were observed between the various nicotine 
concentrations and the air control for both metabolic activity and viability. Significant 
differences (p<.05) were found between 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 mg/mL concentrations and tobacco 
cigarette smoke for metabolic activity and/or viability. When compared against each other, 
we did not observe significant differences among the variable nicotine concentrations in 
either metabolic activity or viability (Supplementary Table 1). When examining the effect of 
nicotine concentration on cytokine release, we found significant decreases in IL-1β, CXCL1, 
and CXCL2 in response to exposure to 18 mg/mL aerosol versus air controls (Table 3A,D). 
IL-6 was significantly increased in response to 24 mg/mL aerosol versus air control. IL-1β 
and CXCL2 levels were significantly decreased between 18 mg/mL aerosol and the

 reference cigarette. Significant differences were observed among aerosols with variable 
nicotine concentrations for IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1 and CXCL2 (Supplementary Table 1).
Nicotine carrier—To study carrier effects, H292 cells were exposed at the ALI to aerosols 
generated from the same ENDS device (eGO tanks system set to 3.3V) filled with 
unflavored liquids containing the same nicotine concentration of 24 mg/mL in (a) PG-only; 
(b) VG-only, or (c) a 50/50 mixture of PG/VG (Table 3A,C). Compared to air controls, 
exposure of H292 cells to aerosols containing each of the tested carriers resulted in a 
significant decrease in cell viability (p<.05). However, all tested carriers were significantly 
less toxic to H292 cells than smoke from tobacco cigarettes (Table 3A,C). We found 
significant differences among the carriers themselves in their effects on cell metabolic 
activity (Supplementary Table 1), as the metabolic activity was significantly decreased in 
cells exposed to PG:VG and VG-only aerosols but not to PG-only as compared to air 
controls. When examining carrier effects on cytokine release, we identified a significant 
increase in all tested cytokines except CXCL1and CXCL10 in cells exposed to PG-only as 
compared to air controls (Table 3A,C).
Battery output voltage—Three battery output voltage settings were tested: 3.3, 4.0 and 
4.8 Volts. Metabolic activity and cell viability were significantly decreased (p<.05) by the 
4.0 and 4.8V devices versus the air control (Table 3A,E). Aerosol generated with the device 
set to lower voltage (3.3V) was not different than air and significantly less toxic than 
tobacco smoke (p<.05; for both metabolic activity and cell viability, Table 3A,E). We found 
significant differences among voltage settings in their effects on metabolic activity and cell 
viability (Supplementary Table 1). When examining the effect of battery output voltage on 
cytokine production, we found a significant increase in all tested cytokines as a result of the 
4.8V setting as compared to air controls.
DISCUSSION
This study used the physiologically relevant ALI system to systematically examine the 
cytotoxic and inflammatory effects of several ENDS variables including product type, 
nicotine concentration, carrier, product voltage and ENDS liquid flavor. Our results 
demonstrate that ENDS products significantly differ in their cellular toxicity to bronchial 
epithelial cells. This is an important finding to further understand the complexity of ENDS 
products. By systematically evaluating various product features, we were able to identify 
device power and flavoring additives as key components that significantly affect the 
potential toxicity of ENDS. This finding has important regulatory implications because both 
features of the ENDS products can be regulated and standardized. Our data indicate that 
ENDS users may reduce the potential harm from inhaling flavored products by selecting 
flavors of lower toxicity profile and operating their device in lower-power settings.
A novel finding of our study is that flavors used in ENDS liquids can have an acute 
cytotoxic effect on respiratory cells. We discovered that menthol, coffee, and strawberry 
flavors had a significant impact on overall cytotoxicity of ENDS products. However, an 
important limitation of our study is that we did not look which of the flavoring compounds 
(as listed in Table 2) caused this cytotoxicity and release of inflammatory mediators.

 Additionally, only one ENDS liquid product was tested for each flavor name (e.g. 
strawberry). It remains to be determined whether other ENDS liquid products with the same 
flavor name that may contain an alternate flavor chemical composition and yield a similar 
result. Further studies are needed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of single flavoring 
chemicals in ENDS liquid, combinations of these ingredients, and the effects of alternate 
ENDS liquid products with the same flavor name. Our study indicates that testing toxicity of 
ENDS products should not be limited to individual flavoring chemicals since the ENDS 
liquids are complex mixtures, and other products features (e.g. voltage) contributes to 
overall toxicity of ENDS aerosol. Finally, although we used the physiologically relevant ALI 
system, our study did not aim to estimate any harmful effects in ENDS users. Future in vivo 
studies are needed to confirm applicability of our findings to human behaviors since 
exposure to flavored ENDS aerosol among most vapers would be different than puffing 
protocol employed in our study.
Only a few studies have looked at the flavoring chemicals used in ENDS liquids. In GC/MS 
screening tests, we were able to tentatively identify several flavoring chemicals present in 
different products. When compared to the most comprehensive flavoring chemical scans to 
date9,10, we found five flavoring chemicals (3-Methylcyclopentane-1,2-dione, Menthol, 
Limonene, Benzyl alcohol and γ-Decalactone) that were the same and six that were distinct 
from those previously reported. Screening the cytotoxicity of each flavoring chemical can be 
a very labor and time consuming task, especially when one considers the number of possible 
interactions between different combinations of flavors with device power and carriers. There 
is an urgent need for time- and cost-effective methods to test flavored ENDS products for 
their potential health effects.
Our study confirmed that increasing the device power by increasing battery output voltage 
resulted in significantly higher overall toxicity of ENDS aerosol. This finding is in line with 
a previous study3, which found that increasing device voltage from 3.2-4.8V resulted in an 
increased release of toxic carbonyl compounds. Cytokine levels were also found to be 
significantly elevated in cells exposed to the high voltage products. These findings identify a 
complex interaction between product features and point toward some important challenges 
when testing the toxicity of different high-voltage or high-power devices. We found a 
significant increase in release of most cytokines in cells exposed to aerosols generated using 
PG-only carrier versus air controls. Interestingly, nicotine concentration did not have a 
significant cytotoxic effect on cells but induced release of the inflammatory cytokines as 
previously reported but others.27
In summary, our data indicate that combinations of product, voltages and flavorings exist 
that are cytotoxic to airway epithelial cells. ENDS users should use the products with 
caution until more comprehensive studies are performed. Because our study focused on the 
acute effects of flavored ENDS products, our observations require verification in chronic 
exposure models, more relevant to regular use of ENDS products.

 WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
•
The extent to which various product features and ingredients, including 
flavorings, impact ENDS safety and potential toxicity is currently not well-
defined.
•
We tested different types and brands of flavored ENDS on cell viability, cell 
metabolic activity, and release of inflammatory cytokines in bronchial 
epithelial cells exposed in vitro directly to freshly-generated ENDS aerosol.
•
We found that various ENDS products differ with regard to their cellular 
toxicity and can cause different inflammatory reactions in cells directly 
exposed to aerosols.
•
This study revealed that flavors significantly affect the in vitro toxicity profile 
of the ENDS products, and among all tested flavors, a commercially available 
fluid labeled strawberry was the most toxic.
