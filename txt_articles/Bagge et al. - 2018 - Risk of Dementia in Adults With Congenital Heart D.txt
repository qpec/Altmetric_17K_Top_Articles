BACKGROUND: More children with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for 
dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the 
general population.
METHODS: In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical 
record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD 
diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were 
followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD 
registration (index date for matched members of the general population 
cohort) until hospital diagnosis of dementia, death, emigration, or 
end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we 
identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish 
Civil Registration System matched on sex and birth year. We computed 
cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for 
sex and birth year.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of 
age in 10 
632 adults with CHD (46% male). The overall HR comparing 
adults with CHD with the general population cohort was 1.6 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.3−2.0). The HR among individuals with CHD 
without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1−1.8). Adults with 
mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1−2.0), whereas the 
HR was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2−3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular 
hearts. The HR for early onset dementia (<65 years of age) was 2.6 (95% 
CI, 1.8−3.8), whereas the late-onset HR was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0−1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: CHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia 
compared with the general population, in particular for early onset 
dementia. Further understanding of dementia risk in the population with 
CHD is a potential target for future investigation.

ongenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in 6 to 10 
per 1000 live births and represents the most 
common group of congenital malformations.1–3 
Because of recent advances in CHD management and 
an overall reduction in mortality, increased attention is 
being paid to acquired morbidities in the aging popula-
tion with CHD.4,5
Neurodevelopmental deficits among infants and 
children with CHD are well described.6–8 However, re-
search on long-term neurological outcomes in adults 
with CHD is more limited. Dementia is among the most 
important late-life neurological diseases in the general 
population. The prevalence of dementia is growing dra-
matically as a result of increased life expectancy. In the 
Danish population, ≈7% of those above 65 years of 
age are diagnosed with dementia,9 and prevalence es-
timates are similar in other countries.10 Dementia is the 
5th most common cause of death in Denmark11 and the 
6th most common in the United States.12
Risk factors for dementia are increased in the popula-
tion with CHD.13–15 These factors include genetic disor-
ders such as Down syndrome and cardiovascular diseases 
such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertension, 
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus.16–22 
In addition, some adults with CHD have poor exercise 
tolerance,23 which is a dementia risk factor.24
In the absence of a disease-modifying treatment for 
most forms of dementia, the identification of factors with 
the potential to delay dementia onset is crucial. Based on 
the increased incidence of neurodevelopmental impair-
ments and associated risk factors for dementia in CHD, 
we hypothesized that the risk of dementia is higher in 
adults with CHD than in the general population.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This nationwide population-based cohort study was conducted 
in Denmark using linked medical registries. Denmark has a 
current population of 5.6 million individuals. The healthcare 
system is tax-supported. It provides free and universal access 
to hospital-based and primary medical care, including care 
for individuals with CHD or dementia. No informed written 
consent or permission from the Scientific Ethical Committee 
is required for register-based studies in Denmark. The study 
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal 
number: 2013-41-1754). The data will not be made available 
to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results. 
Analytic methods are described below.
Data Linkage
The study was based on an unambiguous individual-level 
record linkage across healthcare registries using the Civil 
Personal Registration number, an assigned unique 10-digit 
identifier, and the Danish Civil Registration System, which 
contains data on all Danish residents since 1968.25 The Civil 
Registration System is updated daily and has electronic records 
on dates of birth, emigration, and death.25
Congenital Heart Disease Cohort
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes used 
in the study are provided in Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement. We used 2 nationwide registries to identify all 
adults who received a diagnosis of CHD between 1963 and 
1974 (before 15 years of age) and between 1977 and 2012 
(at any age). The identification of survivors of CHD diagnosed 
between 1963 and 1974 was based on a medical record 
review and has been described elsewhere.26 The identification 
of those diagnosed between 1977 and 2012 was performed 
using the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR), which con-
tains information on dates of admission and discharge, dis-
charge diagnoses, and surgical procedures in Denmark since 
1977, as well as clinical care by emergency departments and 
outpatient clinics since 1995.27 Diagnoses were coded accord-
ing to the 8th revision of the ICD from 1966 until the end 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Congenital heart disease is associated with adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood 
and early adulthood; however, data on long-term 
neurological outcomes are sparse.
• In a nationwide population-based cohort study 
including 10 
632 adults with congenital heart dis-
ease, the risk of all-cause dementia was increased 
by ≈60% compared with a matched general popu-
lation cohort.
• The risk was higher for early onset dementia (<65 
years of age; more than double) than late-onset 
dementia (≈30% elevated risk) and was elevated 
for all levels of congenital heart disease complexity, 
including those with cyanotic potential.
• The relative risk remained increased for those with-
out extracardiac defects or acquired cardiovascular 
diseases.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Adults with congenital heart disease are at increased 
risk for dementia, particularly early onset dementia, 
and these results support the importance of under-
standing the risk of adverse long-term neurologi-
cal outcomes in the growing and aging population 
with congenital heart disease.
• Although it remains unknown whether the results 
are directly generalizable to children diagnosed 
today, they appear relevant for the large popula-
tion of adults with congenital heart disease alive 
today.
• In the absence of disease-modifying treatments for 
most dementias, the specific influence of etiologic 
factors on congenital heart disease is a potential 
target for future investigations to delay dementia 
onset in this vulnerable population.

of 1993 and the 10th revision thereafter. The individuals 
diagnosed with CHD during the 2-year gap (1975 and 1976) 
between the medical record review and the DNPR without any 
subsequent medical record data points were not captured in 
this study.
The adults with CHD were grouped according to a hier-
archy of physiological complexity: univentricular represents 
a history of single-ventricle diagnoses or palliative surgery 
such as Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan; severe represents more 
complex biventricular physiology, including tetralogy of Fallot, 
transposition of the great arteries, and atrioventricular canal 
defect; mild to moderate included simple biventricular physi-
ology with and without a history of surgery or catheter-based 
intervention for atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, 
isolated coarctation of the aorta, and patent ductus arterio-
sus; or unclassified.
The CHD cohort was subdivided according to cyanotic 
potential to examine potential variation in dementia risk. 
Because of the inability to identify duration and severity of 
cyanosis exposure based on the ICD coding, the analysis was 
performed after restriction to those lesions with the highest 
certainty of being cyanotic for some period of time. Specifically, 
the defects selected to have cyanotic potential were tetralogy 
of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, truncus arterio-
sus/common arterial trunk, and univentricular physiology. The 
lesions selected as representative of acyanotic physiology were 
atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the 
aorta, and patent ductus arteriosus. All other individuals were 
defined as unclassified for cyanosis-related analysis. Those with 
Eisenmenger’s physiology were excluded from this analysis.
General Population Comparison Cohort
For each CHD adult, 10 individuals from the general popula-
tion were randomly sampled through the Civil Registration 
System matched on sex and birth year.25
Dementia
The primary outcome was a first-time hospital diagnosis of 
all-cause dementia in the inpatient or outpatient clinic set-
ting obtained from the DNPR. We also categorized demen-
tia diagnoses into Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and 
other dementias (including unspecified dementias). Because 
the age of dementia onset is rarely <30 years of age,28 we 
restricted the analysis to those ≥30 years of age. Dementia 
onset was divided into early and late onset by use of the con-
ventional threshold of 65 years of age.29
Covariates
Information on the highest completed educational level by 
30 years of age in both cohorts was available from Statistics 
Denmark and categorized as basic (completion of primary edu-
cation), moderate (completion of 3 years of secondary education 
known as gymnasium or completion of 3- to 4-year vocational 
programs after primary education), or advanced (completion 
of university education). By means of the DNPR, extracardiac 
defects (ECDs) and chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed any 
time after birth were identified. In accordance with the guide-
line from the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies, 
minor isolated defects such as subluxation and unstable hip, 
torticollis, cryptorchidism, or protuberant ears were disre-
garded.30 Information on hospital-diagnosed cardiovascular 
diseases (atrial fibrillation or flutter, heart failure, stroke, and 
hypertension) and diabetes mellitus at any time during follow-
up was also obtained using the DNPR.
Statistical Analyses
All adults with CHD were followed from 30 years of age, 
initiation of Statistics Denmark’s database on education in 
1981, or the date of first CHD registration (index date for 
the matched comparison cohort members), whichever came 
last. Follow-up continued until the date of dementia diagno-
sis, emigration, death, or end of the study period (December 
31, 2012), whichever came first. Individuals who received a 
dementia diagnosis before the index date were excluded.
We computed the cumulative incidence of dementia 
in both cohorts considering death as a competing risk. All-
cause mortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estima-
tor. The incidence rates of dementia were estimated as the 
count of individual diagnosed with dementia divided by the 
total person-time at risk. In addition, the incidence rates were 
calculated for 3 different age groups. Cox proportional haz-
ard regression was used to compute the hazard ratios (HRs) 
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of time to 
all-cause dementia diagnosis as well as subtypes of dementia 
diagnoses. We compared adults with CHD to the general pop-
ulation cohort using age as a time scale and adjusted for sex 
and birth year. Analyses were stratified by sex and birth year.
Subgroup analyses comparing the CHD adults with their 
matched members from the general population cohort were 
performed by CHD complexity, cyanosis potential, age at first 
CHD diagnosis, CHD diagnosis type, presence of ECDs, and 
educational attainment. Separate analyses were performed 
for follow-up periods < and >65 years of age to differenti-
ate early and late onset dementia, respectively. To investigate 
the role of cardiovascular diseases (atrial fibrillation or flutter, 
heart failure, stroke, and hypertension) and diabetes mellitus, 
we evaluated the HRs during time at risk before and after 
such diagnoses in the CHD cohort (index date for matched 
comparison cohort members). The proportional hazard 
assumption was verified using log-minus-log plots.
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed 4 sensitivity analyses. First, we excluded all 
adults with CHD and members of the matched general popu-
lation cohort with diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments or 
amnestic syndromes at the start of follow-up to ensure cap-
ture of only incident events of dementia (ICD codes are pre-
sented in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Second, 
we redefined Alzheimer disease to also include the ICD code 
for dementia without specification because a previous study 
has reported many Alzheimer disease cases to be misclassified 
as unspecified dementia.31 Third, we adjusted separately for 
extracardiac defects, acquired cardiovascular diseases, includ-
ing diabetes mellitus and stroke, and education. Fourth, sepa-
rate analyses were performed before and after the year 1994, 
when ICD-10 superseded ICD-8. 
All statistical analyses of data were conducted using STATA 
software (14th edition, StataCorp LP).

RESULTS
We identified 10 
632 adults with CHD alive at 30 years 
of age, 46% of whom were male (Table 1). The birth 
period stretched from 1890 to 1982, with the major-
ity born between 1960 and 1982. The most common 
types of CHD diagnoses were atrial (n=2737, 26%) and 
ventricular (n=2361, 22%) septal defects. In this cohort 
of adults with CHD, 65% (n=6900) had a mild-to-mod-
erate CHD complexity. Diagnoses of ECDs were more 
frequent among adults with CHD (14%) than in the 
comparison cohort (4%).
During the follow-up period, 1072 adults were diag-
nosed with dementia across both cohorts. The cumula-
tive incidence of dementia was 4% at 80 years of age 
in both cohorts. However, the all-cause mortality at 80 
years of age differed between cohorts (60% for CHD 
adults and 35% for the comparison cohort). The overall 
incidence rate per 1000 person-years at risk was 0.78 
in the cohort with CHD and 0.75 in the general popu-
lation cohort. Although the incidence rates increased 
with age in both cohorts, the incidence rise rate of the 
population with CHD was relatively greater compared 
with the general population cohort in all age groups 
(30–64 years, 65–79 years, and 80+ years) (Table 2).
The overall HR of dementia was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.29–
2.02) among adults with CHD compared with the gener-
al population cohort (Table 3). The elevation was similar 
for diagnoses of Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, 
and other dementias. The HRs did not vary according to 
sex (male, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06–2.26; female, 1.65; 95% 
CI, 1.25–2.19) (Table 4). Adults with severe and univen-
tricular CHD had an HR of 1.96 (95% CI, 1.15–3.34), 
whereas the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.14–1.97) for the 
mild-to-moderate CHD complexity. The HR for CHD types 
with cyanotic potential was 1.83 (95% CI, 0.69–4.87) 
compared with 1.42 (95% CI, 1.08–1.89) for acyanotic 
defects. When considering the risk of dementia among 
adults with CHD without ECD, the increased HR persist-
ed (1.38; 95% CI, 1.08–1.76). The risk of dementia in 
the cohort with CHD relative to the general population 
cohort was more elevated more for early onset dementia 
(HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.76–3.81) than late-onset dementia 
(HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00–1.75).
The HRs computed according to completed education 
by 30 years of age comparing adults with CHD to the 
matched general population cohort members were as 
follows: basic, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.32–2.51), moderate, 2.65 
(95% CI, 1.30–5.38), and advanced, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.16–
1.69). Adults with CHD with and without additional ac-
quired cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus were at 
increased risk of dementia (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11–1.97; 
HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.26–2.64, respectively). The incidence 
rates for adults with CHD with these acquired diseases 
and for matched members of the comparison cohort 
were 2.16 and 2.01 per 1000 person-years at risk, re-
spectively. For individuals without these acquired diseases

and for their matched members, the incidence rates were 
0.37 and 0.30 per 1000 person-years at risk, respectively.
Sensitivity Analyses
The results did not change substantially when exclud-
ing all individuals with diagnosed mild cognitive im-
pairments and amnestic syndromes (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The reclassification of 
unspecified dementias as Alzheimer disease did not 
change the result substantially. After adjusting for 
potential mediating factors—extracardiac defects, ac-
quired cardiovascular diseases including diabetes mel-
litus and stroke, and education—the HR remained ap-
proximately the same. Last, the increased relative risk of 
dementia among adults with CHD did not vary by ICD 
version in use at time of dementia diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
Among adults with CHD, we found that the risk of de-
mentia was increased relative to a sex- and birth year-

matched general population cohort. Elevated relative risk 
of dementia was present across the entire spectrum of 
adults with CHD, including individuals with both mild and 
complex CHD, with or without potential cyanotic lesions, 
with and without ECDs or chromosomal abnormalities, 
and with or without acquired conditions such as diabetes 
mellitus or cardiovascular disease. The relative risk of de-
mentia was particularly increased for middle-age adults 
who demonstrated evidence of early onset dementia.
Our findings extend the knowledge of long-term neuro-
logical impairment and mental health functional morbidi-
ties in the population with CHD. Although previous studies 
have reported elevated risks of adverse neurodevelop-
mental outcomes among individuals with CHD, including 
increased occurrence of depression, autism, and epilepsy 
compared with the general population,6–8,19,32–35 our study 
examined an older adult population to determine the later-
life consequences of this neurological outcome. Although 
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not 
completely understood, the potential etiologic factors ap-
pear multifactorial and consistent with previous findings 
within the neurodevelopmental scientific literature.
The concept of cerebral reserve provides an explana-
tory framework for considering the interindividual varia-
tion in susceptibility and tolerance of age-related brain 
changes and pathology, including dementia. The reserve 
can be considered within categories of brain reserve and 
cognitive reserve.36 CHD is associated with a number of 
factors that may impact adversely both brain and cogni-
tive reserve, and thus increase the risk of dementia.
The potential etiologic factors for reducing brain reserve 
in the population with CHD differ over a lifetime and may 
involve neurological malformations, the effects of the ab-
normal physiology, complex medical and surgical manage-
ment strategies, chromosomal abnormalities, and acquired 
morbidities. Studies have suggested that impaired fetal ox-
ygen delivery and altered brain metabolism contribute to 
dysmaturation in individuals with more complex CHD.19,37–
40 Medical and surgical management of CHD, which may 
result in embolic events and brain injuries inducing cerebral 
ischemia, hemodilution, and postoperative low-cardiac 
output physiology, all may negatively contribute to de-
creased brain reserve.7,32,33 For example, vascular brain inju-
ries, including clinically silent strokes, have been observed 
both pre- and postoperatively in infants with CHD.6 Hypox-
emia affects the same cellular pathways and may enhance 
this effect.6,19,39,41 In our study, the relative risk of dementia 
was increased among adults with severe CHD, as well as 
among lesions with a cyanotic potential. However, the risk 
remained for individuals with acyanotic disease and those 
with mild-to-moderate CHD, which suggests that hypoxia 
hemodynamics alone cannot explain the risk of dementia.
Genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities are 
known to influence neurodevelopment.20 One of these, 
Down syndrome (trisomy 21), is associated with excess 
production of the amyloid precursor protein and neuro-
pathological features of Alzheimer disease.20 However, we 
observed a persisted elevated risk even among individuals 
without ECDs and chromosomal abnormalities, indicating 
that other etiologic pathways should be considered.
Adults with CHD acquire cardiovascular morbidities 
earlier than members of the general population, which 
may impact the brain reserve. These morbidities, which 
include atrial fibrillation, stroke, diabetes mellitus, cor-
onary artery disease, and heart failure, are associated 
with an enhanced risk of cognitive decline and demen-
tia.14,16–18,42–44 We observed an increased relative risk 
among adults with CHD with and without acquired car-
diovascular diseases or diabetes mellitus relative to their 
matched members from the general population. Fur-
thermore, the HRs did not vary substantially for vascular 
dementia, Alzheimer disease, and other dementias.
Higher cognitive reserve, reflected in higher premorbid 
intelligence and longer exposures to education, mentally 
demanding occupation, and mentally stimulating leisure 
activities, is associated with lower risk of dementia.45 The 
absence of increased risk in the advanced education group 
might suggest a protective effect of education in the set-
ting of CHD, but the number of observations is small for 
conclusions. Furthermore, lower educational attainment 
might be considered a surrogate for CHD complexity or 
acquired medical complexity, as well as baseline learning 
difficulties related to neurodevelopmental disorders.
When considering the age of dementia onset, we 
observed an increased risk for both early and late-onset 
dementia when comparing the cohort with CHD to the 
general population cohort. However, the degree of risk 
in adults with CHD was significantly higher for early

onset dementia. This variation may reflect the lower 
incidence rate of dementia in the general population 
cohort <65 years of age (Table 2), when the burden 
of age-related dementia pathologies and other comor-
bidities is expected to be low and the relative impact of 
CHD-related risk may be greater.
The following strengths and limitations should be 
considered when interpreting the results. Our large 
population-based cohort study with virtually complete 
follow-up for migration, death, and hospital-diagnosed 
dementia minimized the risk of selection bias. The qual-
ity of our data is dependent on the validity of diagnosis 
coding for CHD, dementia, and the covariates. The posi-
tive predictive value of the overall CHD diagnosis in the 
DNPR has previously been reported to be high: ≈90%.46 
As previously described, an algorithm developed by ex-
perienced cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, and epidemi-
ologists and based on extensive medical record review al-
lowed inclusion of all adults with valid CHD diagnoses.24 
However, misclassification of specific CHD diagnosis, and 
therefore also CHD complexity, may be present. Further-
more, where the ICD diagnostic code was insufficiently 
specific to infer CHD complexity, we were not able to 
categorize adults with CHD according to complexity. 
The positive predictive value of all-cause dementia in the 
DNPR is ≈86% and that of Alzheimer’s disease is 81%, 
but the validity of other dementia subtypes is lower,31 
and misclassification of dementia subtypes may be pres-
ent. It is notable that the risk of dementia in the cohort 
with CHD relative to the general comparison cohort did 
not differ between ICD versions (Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement). For cardiovascular diseases and 
cardiac surgery, the positive predictive values in the DNPR 
have also been reported to be high.47–49 However, condi-
tions such as hypertension and uncomplicated diabetes 
mellitus may often be treated in the primary care units 
and thus not be completely registered in the DNPR.
The possibility of surveillance bias, and consequently 
overestimation of the risk of dementia among adults 
with CHD compared with the general population co-
hort, should be considered because the CHD population 
may be more frequently in contact with the medical pro-
viders, and the sensitivity of the dementia diagnosis is 
unknown. However, the risk was similar in the mild-to-
moderate adults with CHD, who by nature of their less 
complex condition are less likely to experience frequent 
medical contact. In addition, medical care in Denmark 
is free and universal, helping to ensure that access to 
health care is not limited in the general population.
The population with CHD in our study represented 
adults who survived to ≥30 years of age. These survivors, 
with an increased risk of dementia, reflect a healthier 
cohort with CHD, and our analyses may underestimate 
the true association between CHD and dementia.
We did not adjust our analyses for such factors as 
cardiovascular disease or educational level because 
these factors may be intermediates in the pathway be-
tween CHD and dementia. We did not have sufficient 
data on some potentially confounding factors such as 
smoking or other lifestyle factors.
New CHD diagnostic tools and the development of 
novel management strategies for CHD are ongoing. 
Therapeutic outcomes have improved greatly, as re-
flected in the declining mortality and shifted age dis-
tribution of the CHD population. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to recognize that the birth period of this cohort 
(1890–1982) represents an era of more limited oppor-
tunities for surgical and medical interventions. Con-
sequently, these results cannot be directly applied to 
young adults diagnosed with CHD in the present eras. 
However, it is important to recognize healthcare needs 
and risk factors affecting the larger number of middle-
age and older adults currently living with CHD.
CONCLUSIONS
Congenital heart disease was associated with an in-
creased risk of dementia compared with the general 
population, particularly for early onset dementia. In-
creased understanding of dementia risk in the popula-
tion with CHD is a potential target for future investi-
gation.

University Hospital “Policlinico Umberto I”
The University of Rome was founded in 1303 by Pope Bonifacio VIII and subsequently supported by the Roman Catholic Church. 
Medical teaching, at the time, centered on the ideas of different professors who taught in small hospitals with virtually no commu-
nication between teachers. Topics of study were chosen on a daily basis, and at the end of the course of studies, young graduates 
had significantly different points of view regarding the same disease, depending on the professor who taught them.
With the support of Umberto I, king of newly unified Italy, a university hospital was built in the early 20th century. The hospital, 
comprising more than 1000 beds, opened its doors in 1905 (top). All the professors associated with the university moved to the 
new university hospital, allowing for free communication, robust exchange of ideas, and ultimately, a homogenous curriculum of 
medical education. This new approach spread around Italy, transforming the teaching and practice of medicine.
The university hospital was constructed with advanced techniques. A prominent surgeon, Francesco Durante, traveled to 
Baltimore to see John Hopkins Hospital, which was under construction, and returned with several ideas for important innovations. 
Subsequently, a complete university campus was constructed around the hospital, which is presently one of the largest in Europe, 
hosting almost 100 
000 students.
Durante, chief of surgery, trained with Lister in Scotland, after having trained previously with Kocher and Virchow.  In addition to his 
skills as a surgeon, Durante was a sculptor and contributed to a decorative bas relief depicting Lister teaching his students (bottom).
