a shopping centre Pop-Up in England

Abstract
Background: Improving detection of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains a public health need. We present results
from a Pop-Up health check stationed in shopping centres in England. We hypothesise the rate of case detection is
related to measurable ‘unhealthiness’ of the shopping centres.
Methods: A Pop-Up health check was sited in four and three shopping centres sampled from the top ten unhealthiest
and top 15 healthiest shopping regions respectively, following a report ranking towns/cities based on their unhealthy
and healthy retail outlets. On one day in each shopping centre, people were approached and consented to BP testing.
Outcome measure was people flagged with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg (cases).
Results: We detected 45 (22.6%) and 20 (13.1%) cases from testing 199 and 152 adults in the unhealthy and healthy
locations respectively (relative risk 1.72; 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 2.78). A measure of unhealthy retail outlets
(e.g. fast-food outlets) within each shopping centre was associated with detection rate (R2 = 0.61; p = 0.04).
Conclusion: An association exists between cases of suspect hypertension found in a health check Pop-Up and measured
‘unhealthiness’ of the shopping centre site. Results hint at strategies for public testing of BP, potentially in the context of
reducing health inequalities.

Background
Systemic hypertension is a major cause of mortality and
morbidity despite availability of preventive interventions
[1, 2]. More than one in four adults in England have
hypertension although many are unaware of it. More-
over, half the adult population in England simply do not
know their blood pressure (BP) ‘numbers’. Identifying
treatable hypertension is cost-effective and Public Health
England has called for improvement in detection rates,
especially in deprived groups, via outreach testing [3].
For example, it is estimated that people from the most
deprived areas in England are 30% more likely than the
least deprived to have elevated BP [3].
Retail short-term sales spaces, often referred to as
Pop-Ups, are a common sight in shopping centres and
other public spaces. Pop-Ups create a temporary retail
environment that engages customers and generates a
feeling of interactivity [4]. Research evidence suggests
retail Pop-Ups increase ‘brand awareness’ and are effect-
ive marketing tools [5, 6]. The Pop-Up retail sector is es-
timated to contribute more than £2 billion per year to
the UK economy and large numbers of retail consumers
visit Pop-Up shops [7].
In England, BP testing is typically carried out within
primary care but other testing opportunities exist, in-
cluding the National Health Service (NHS) Check Invita-
tion
and
independent
campaigns
where
testing
is
initiated directly in communities. To our knowledge,
temporary Pop-Up health checks in shopping centres
have not been explored and this is the main idea of this
study.
Since 2009, adults aged 40–74 years in England have
been entitled to an NHS Health Check, a scheme designed
to find people with early signs of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia [8].
Adults within the age range with no known pre-existing
conditions are invited to attend a health check every 5
years. These checks are community based; they are deliv-
ered via general medical practices, community pharmacies

 or another community-based provider [9]. An individual’s
CVD risk is predicted by taking into account their socio-
demographic characteristics, cholesterol, blood pressure,
history of smoking and family history [10]. Those found to
be at a higher risk of CVD are placed on a ‘high risk’ regis-
ter and offered annual reviews. Although a primary aim of
the NHS Health Check was to reduce health inequalities,
uptake of these checks is relatively low, with those at high-
est risk of CVD more likely not to attend [11]. A recent
systematic review of the delivery and impact of the NHS
Health
Check
concluded
that
published
attendance,
uptake, and prescribing rates are all lower than originally
anticipated, and data on impact are limited, with very few
studies
reporting
the
effect
of
attendance
on
health-related behaviours [12]. Moreover, this study also
found the uptake of the NHS Health Check to be rela-
tively lower in those living in the most deprived areas.
Other studies have also questioned the practicalities [13]
and clinical effectiveness of this national prevention
programme [14]. Hence, proactively seeking out people at
risk of CVD in the community remains an unmet public
health need.
By investigating the concentration of businesses and
retail outlets that may reflect the state of peoples’ health
in cities and towns, the Royal Society for Public Health
(RSPH) published a league table of healthy and un-
healthy shopping regions in the UK [15]. Measures were
based on, for example, the presence of tanning salons,
fast-food restaurants, bookmakers and payday lenders as
indictors of ‘unhealthy’ retail outlets. The RSPH pub-
lished these results as part of their initiative to reduce
the negative influences on shopping areas. For example,
the report aimed to promote the idea of a public health
criterion to be a condition of licensing for all types of
business.
We visited shopping centres in different locations in
England to test a series of hypotheses on public engage-
ment with our Pop-Up health check using the RSPH re-
port results as a sampling frame. Primarily, our Pop-Up
offered a free check for elevated intraocular eye pressure,
a risk factor for the eye disease glaucoma [16] and this is
the subject of another report. On 50% of the testing
days, we offered a free BP check to investigate how this
might encourage engagement with the eye health assess-
ment. From this, we took the BP data to develop the hy-
pothesis that the proportion of suspected cases of
hypertension detected would vary by shopping centre lo-
cation. More precisely, for this report, we hypothesised
test results might be associated with a measure of the
‘unhealthiness’ of the shopping centre.
Methods
This was a prospective, cross-sectional study designed to
capture BP measurements in people in the community
using a Pop-Up in shopping centres across England. Our
“Feeling the Pressure” Pop-Up was designed for use in
covered areas (Fig. 1). The Pop-Up comprised two pri-
vate testing areas and an open reception space designed
to engage the public. The Pop-Up was assembled for
two consecutive working days in different shopping cen-
tres across England during August 2016. All testing was
performed by two optometrists assisted, in recruitment
and administration, by assistants comprising volunteer
undergraduate and postgraduate students. Primarily, the
Pop-Up offered a free check on eye health. Additionally,
on one of the two testing days in each centre the
Pop-Up also offered a free BP check. In this report, we
consider the BP data only.
Our sampling of shopping centre locations attempted to
follow the schema described in a recently published RSPH
(www.rsph.org.uk) report ranking town/city centres based
on the number and impact of the most harmful or un-
healthy and the most beneficial or healthy businesses [15].
Four shopping centres were sampled from the reported
top ten unhealthiest towns/cities. These were (with RSPH
report ranking for most unhealthy town/city out of n = 70
towns/cities and initials of testing optometrists in paren-
thesis) in Preston (#1; LAE & DJT); Coventry (#3; LAE &
PC); Northampton (#5; LAE & RS); Stoke-on-Trent (#9;
LAE & DJT). Three shopping centres were sampled from
the bottom of the list and, by implication, were amongst
the top 15 healthiest towns/cities. These were in Notting-
ham (#55; LAE & RS); Bristol (#61; LAE & PC); Cam-
bridge (#64; LAE & DJT). The sampling was purposeful
but restricted by availability of shopping centres during
the study period and logistics.
We determined our own unhealthy retail outlet score
for each shopping centre based on a modified version of
that used in the RSPH study. On the day of testing, the
lead author (LAE) and two Pop-Up assistants surveyed
all the retail outlets within the shopping centre by
counting the number open to shoppers on the day of
testing. They then established the retail outlets within
each shopping centre which could be classed as one of
four types: either a fast-food takeaway, a bookmaker, a
tanning salon or a payday loan business, following the
guidelines and descriptions used in the RSPH study. If
there was any ambiguity about the nature of the retail
outlet, as was the case for some counted as fast-food
takeaways, then the notes (including photographs) col-
lected on the day were reviewed by all authors and a
consensus decision made. The number of these outlets
as a proportion (percentage) of all retail outlets open on
the day of testing within the shopping centre was then
calculated to be our simple surrogate measure for the
unhealthiness of the shopping centre. There are, how-
ever, some important differences between our own un-
healthy retail outlet score and the one used in the RSPH

 study. In the latter, different scores, or weights, were as-
cribed to different types of retail outlet based on being
negatively health prompting. The RSPH study also as-
cribed scores to retail outlets it defined as being posi-
tively health promoting.
People in each shopping centre were approached and
consented to BP testing. Our approach to shoppers was
opportunistic and did not allow for estimates of accurate
response rates. We aimed to recruit people > 40 years
but did not reject approaches from younger people. The
examination was free. For this study, contact details, age
and details of the participant’s General Practitioner (GP)
were recorded. A short medical history was taken. BP
was measured using a Panasonic EW3106 monitor
(Panasonic; Osaka, Japan); a device approved by the Brit-
ish Hypertension Society (BHS; www.bhsoc.org) which
meets the European Society of Hypertension accuracy
levels [17]. All four optometrists (LAE; DJT; PC; RS) had
training in good practice and competency for measuring
BP under guidance of a lecturer in nursing at City, Uni-
versity of London. BP was measured after five minutes
resting, with the participant sitting with their left arm
supported at heart level. Care was taken to use an ap-
propriate size cuff bladder. Everyone tested was given
his or her BP measurement recorded on an information
leaflet about BP specifically designed for this study. The
outcome measure for this study was people with a BP of
≥140/90 mmHg on repeat testing. (For the repeat BP
testing, we followed the NICE Clinical Guideline CG127
[18]. So, for example, if the second BP measurement was
substantially different from the first, then a third meas-
urement was taken with the lower of the last two mea-
surements recorded.) For this report, we define these
people as cases. For these cases, we also sent a referral
note to their GP. Some participants were already aware
of their elevated BP or were on BP-lowering treatment;
these participants were still measured and classified as
cases if their BP was ≥140/90 mmHg. Following relevant
national guidelines, people with BP of > 180/110 mmHg
were
counselled
on
the
urgency
of
their
referral,
reflected in a different GP letter in addition to a
follow-up phone call to the individual. Anyone with BP
> 210/120 mmHg was to be immediately directed to an
Accident and Emergency department, facilitated by the
Pop-Up assistants.
The research was approved by a university ethics com-
mittee and monitored by an advisory group comprising
different stakeholders including members of the public.
Written informed consent, according to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki, was obtained from each partici-
pant prior to examination. All participants were told the
examination might give them useful information about
their general health, but they were also advised that the
Pop-Up examination was no substitute for an assessment
by their GP; this information was conveyed verbally and
stated clearly in the participant information sheet. More-
over, all participants were given an easy-to-read purpose
written information leaflet (see Additional file 1) which
was subject to scrutiny and approval by the advisory group
and ethics committee. Data were recorded both manually
and using a tablet computer on the day of testing. All in-
formation was anonymised, then subsequently transferred
and stored onto a secure database held at the university.
Analysis of data centred on the proportion of cases as
compared to all those who consented to their BP being
measured in shopping centres pooled across the four un-
healthy and three healthy locations. We also tested for
univariate association between our shopping centre un-
healthiness measure and the proportion of cases across
the seven shopping centres. All data analysis was carried
out in Microsoft Excel and R (www.R-project.org).
Results
In total, 199 people (48% male) were examined in the
four unhealthy locations over four days and 152 people
(52% male) were examined in the three healthy locations
over three days. The two samples examined had almost
identical age distributions: median (10th, 25th, 75th,
90th percentile) age was 56 (28, 41, 70, 76) and 56 (27,
40, 68, 75) years for the unhealthy and healthy locations
respectively.
Number of people tested and cases (people flagged
with a BP of ≥140/90 mmHg on repeat testing) identified
at each shopping centre is given in Table 1. For our main
outcome we detected 45 (22.6%) and 20 (13.1%) cases in
the unhealthy and healthy locations respectively. The
difference in the proportion of cases indicates a statisti-
cally significant relative risk (1.72; p = 0.03). These re-
sults suggest that a person tested in an unhealthy
shopping region is 72% (95% confidence interval: 6 to
278%) more likely to be tested positive as a case than a
person tested in a healthy shopping region.
Around one half of all cases were already aware of
having elevated BP, or self-reported some history of is-
sues with elevated BP (Table 1). Four people recorded
BP > 180/110 mmHg and these were all recorded in the

 shopping centres in the unhealthy locations. There were
no instances of a person having a BP > 210/120 mmHg.
As would be expected, our local measure of percent-
age of unhealthy retail outlets within each shopping
centre aligned closely with the observations in the RSPH
survey. For example, 34 retail outlets out of a total of
179 (19.0%) were identified to be either a fast-food take-
away, a bookmaker, a tanning salon or a pay-day loan
business in our four shopping centres sampled from un-
healthy locations. (See Fig. 2 for numbers by individual
shopping centre.) This estimate was significantly lower
(6/109; 5.5%) in our three shopping centres in healthy
regions. This equates to more than a threefold difference
(95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 7.9). One shopping
centre in Cambridge had none of these ‘unhealthy’ retail
outlets. Conversely more than one quarter of the retail
outlets in the shopping centre in Northampton were, re-
markably, either a fast-food takeaway, a bookmaker, a
tanning salon or a payday loan business.
Our local measure of percentage of unhealthy retail
outlets within the shopping centre was associated with
the detection rate of cases and this was statistically sig-
nificant (R2 = 0.61; p = 0.04; Fig. 2).
Discussion
By surveying the retail outlets that may reflect the state
of peoples’ health in cities and towns, the RSPH pub-
lished a league table of healthy and unhealthy shopping
regions [15]. In our study, we found a person volunteer-
ing to be tested in a heath check Pop-Up in one of the

 unhealthy regions defined by the RSPH report is more
likely to have suspected or diagnosed elevated BP com-
pared to an age-similar person tested in a healthy town/
city and this is our principal finding. Moreover, a meas-
ure of unhealthy retail outlets within a shopping centre
was significantly associated with detection rate of sus-
pected or diagnosed elevated BP in our sample. In other
words, the proportion of fast-food takeaways, book-
makers, tanning salons and payday loan outlets within a
shopping centre is related to the number of cases of ele-
vated BP in people volunteering to be examined as part
of a Pop-Up health check conducted in the shopping
centre. Our findings add to the knowledge of potential
methods of assessing people at risk of hypertension and
reveal an interesting link to location of testing.
Relationships
between
shopping
environment
and
health have been documented in the research literature.
For example, data from a population health survey of
2900 adults was linked with geographic measures of
access to food retailers in Edmonton in Canada. Results
indicated the ratio of fast-food restaurants and conveni-
ence stores to grocery stores and produce vendors near
people’s homes was related to likelihood of being obese
[19]. Other research from the United States supports the
claim that access to fast-food restaurants is associated
with obesity among adults [20], excess weight gains over
time [21] as well as insulin resistance [22]. There is also
good evidence to show that excessive use of fast-food res-
taurants is associated with higher BMI in children in the
UK [23]. The RSPH report highlighted the importance of
ensuring retail areas encourage healthy lifestyles and sug-
gested businesses such as fast-food outlets, betting shops,
and payday lenders should be unable to cluster in areas of
high deprivation [15]. Therefore, we believe our measure
of an unhealthy shopping environment to be a reasonable
one. For example, payday lending is a contemporary pub-
lic health concern because of the vulnerability of the pop-
ulations
using
these
lenders
and
the
documented
detrimental effect that financial difficulties can have on
mental and physical health [24]. Moreover, there is a
strong association between a profusion of betting shops
and problems with gambling and poor health indices [15].
Sunbed use is associated with a significant increase in risk
of melanoma [25] and at least one systematic review has
shown that the typical sunbed user is more likely to have
an unhealthy diet, smoke and drink alcohol more fre-
quently than a non-user [26].
To our knowledge the idea of a Pop-Up health check
for BP, set in a shopping centre, has not been previously
explored. Pop-Up clinics have been proposed and exam-
ined for HIV testing [27] and there are several reports
on the effectiveness of mobile health clinics designed to
raise awareness and screen for a wide variety of condi-
tions, such as, colorectal cancer [28], paediatric eye
disorders [29] and general health in vulnerable popula-
tions [30]. Moreover, mobile health clinics are widely
used in the US and, for example, one extensive study
has found them to be effective for screening for suspect
hypertension [31]. Interestingly, using the Pop-Up con-
cept to improve public health has recently been ex-
tended to the idea of temporary urban Pop-Up parks
designed to solve the limited access to public physical
activity recreation spaces many urban residents face
[32]. Our novel idea of a Pop-Up health check in a shop-
ping centre certainly fits with a recent call by NHS Eng-
land and Public Health England, urging council public
health teams to organise BP check opportunities in pub-
lic places [33].
Around one half of all cases reported in this study
were
already
aware
of
having
elevated
BP,
or
self-reported some history of issues with elevated BP.
The effect we detected between the unhealthy and
healthy shopping regions could therefore be explained
by differences in undiagnosed hypertension/suspected
hypertension or be explained by differences in possible
poor control of known hypertension/suspected hyper-
tension; as likely, the effect could be explained by a com-
bination of the two factors. Overall numbers were not
substantial enough for us to make a distinction between
these two factors. Yet this distinction is important. One
centres on medication adherence and long-term man-
agement issues, whilst the other centres on detection.
Both have substantial public health importance and their
relationship with socioeconomic status should be studied
further, as suggested by other reports [34].
There are some critical limitations to our observations.
For example, there are ethnic differences in the preva-
lence of hypertension but we did not record or report
our participants’ ethnicity. Prevalence of hypertension is
raised in South Asian, Afro-Caribbean, and West African
people in England and ethnicity is an important consid-
eration in assessing BP measures in community-based
studies [35]. We therefore cannot comment on a bias
that might be introduced by some areas having higher
prevalence of different ethnic groups compared to
others. Similarly, a bias in our results may have been in-
troduced by differences in levels of obesity between
‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ locations or differences in ‘white
coat’ hypertension whereby the clinical setting precipi-
tates artificially elevated BP due to increased patient
anxiety [36].
Furthermore, a diagnosis of elevated BP cannot be
made from measurements at a single point in time. One
author (LAE) performed most, but not all of the testing
so our results might be limited by the use of different as-
sessors. Nevertheless, other discrepancies in measure-
ment from, for example, failure to position participants
and their arms consistently would have been minimised
Edwards et al. BMC Public Health           (2019) 19:42 
Page 6 of 8
 by the identical testing environment afforded by the
purpose-built Pop-Up. An unavoidable limitation of the
results from our case finding exercise arises from only
being able to assess individuals interested in having their
BP measured. Moreover, we originally aimed to test only
people who were > 40 years but the Pop-Up generated a
lot of interest and we examined younger people too;
consequently, around one quarter of our participants
were younger than 40 years. Our study design meant our
results are limited to observational associations. More-
over, our study did not have a longitudinal element
where we could, for example, follow-up the suspected
cases. In addition, whilst our unhealthy retail outlet
score is based on a previous report [15] it is very much a
surrogate measure and has not been validated in other
studies.
There is more to understand about different ways to
case-find suspect hypertension. A proven effective route
is to create easily accessible testing opportunities such as
in community settings or the workplace [37] [38]. There
are other advantages to screening for hypertension away
from a ‘white coat’ medical environment [36]. Of course,
these forms of testing are still restricted to individuals
who volunteer to have their BP measured and current
evidence is insufficient to recommend specific ap-
proaches for community-based case finding for elevated
BP [39]. Nevertheless, our study contributes a modest
example of a new approach to assessing BP outside pri-
mary care. The health check Pop-Up also offers a way of
educating the public about hypertension and BP. Our re-
sults also imply that an in situ public health check might
benefit from a targeted strategy, not seen in current ap-
proaches [40]. We assessed 351 people in only 7 days of
testing, a remarkable number given the tests of eye
health carried out on the same day.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate an intriguing relationship
between detecting people with suspected elevated BP
and the type and location of the shopping centre they
were visiting. We speculate our results hint at strategies
for targeted outreach testing and screening of BP that
should be the subject of further investigation, potentially
in the context of reducing health inequalities.
