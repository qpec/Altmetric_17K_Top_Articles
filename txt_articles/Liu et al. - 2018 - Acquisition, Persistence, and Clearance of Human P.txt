Background. Little is known about the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in male virgins. This study 
estimated the incidence and clearance of genital HPV infection and the factors associated with these measures among men who 
denied at baseline ever having penetrative sex.
Methods. A cohort of 4123 men residing in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States were followed every 6 months for up to 10 
visits. Genital exfoliated cells were collected and genotyped for 36 HPV types. Eighty-seven men were classified as virgins and in-
cluded for analysis. Cox proportional hazards models identified factors associated with the incidence and clearance of genital HPV 
infection.
Results. The incidence rates for any HPV infection among virgins who did and those who did not initiate sex during follow-up 
were 26.2 and 14.6 cases/1000 person-months, respectively. After penetrative sex initiation, 45.5% of men acquired HPV within 
24 months. Younger age, current smoking, no recent female sex partners, and prevalent HPV infection were associated with high-
risk HPV clearance.
Conclusion. Virgins who did not initiate sex during follow-up still acquired HPV infection, possibly through nonpenetrative 
sexual contact. Further prospective cohort studies are needed to better understand factors associated with HPV acquisition and 
clearance in male virgins and recent nonvirgins.
Keywords. Human papillomavirus; male; virgins; incidence; persistence; clearance.
 
Approximately 14 million people in the United States become 
newly infected every year with human papillomavirus (HPV) 
[1]. HPV can cause high-grade cervical intraepithelial neopla-
sia, invasive cervical cancer, and vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, 
and oral cancers, in addition to anogenital warts and recurrent 
respiratory papillomatosis [2].
HPV transmission requires the presence of epithelial micro-
traumas, which allow HPV to reach basal cells at the bottom of 
the epidermis. These infected cells divide and produce daughter 
cells that are pushed to the outer epidermal layer. As this layer is 
sloughed off, infected cells are released into the environment or 
passed on to other skin/mucosal surfaces [2, 3].
HPV is transmitted primarily through penetrative sex 
[1], although there is evidence of other modes of transmis-
sion, namely mother-to-infant transmission, nonsexual skin- 
to-skin contact, nonpenetrative sexual transmission, and 
contact with HPV-contaminated fomites [2, 4]. Our prior 
investigation observed a substantial prevalence of genital HPV 
in men (25.0%) who denied any history of penetrative sex [5]. 
Little else is known about HPV infection among male virgins 
and the acquisition of HPV after male sexual debut. Studying 
the natural history of HPV infection among those men may 
help us better understand HPV transmission and thus be bene-
ficial in the prevention of HPV-related disease.
Our aim was to determine the incidence, persistence and 
clearance of genital HPV infection among male virgins at base-
line in the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study cohort during a 
6-year follow-up period and to identify factors associated with 
incidence and clearance.
METHODS
Study Population
From June 2005 to September 2009, healthy men were recruited 
from Tampa, Florida; São Paulo, Brazil; and Cuernavaca, 
Mexico. The study population consisted of men who met the 
following inclusion criteria: age of 18–70 years; residence in 
southern Florida, São Paulo, or Cuernavaca; no prior diagnosis 
of penile cancer, anal cancer, or genital warts; no symptoms of 
a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or treatment for an STI

at enrollment; no participation in an HPV vaccine study; no 
history of human immunodeficiency virus infection or AIDS; 
no history of imprisonment, homelessness, or drug treatment 
during the past 6 months; no plans to relocate within the next 
4 years; and willingness to comply with 10 scheduled visits 
every 6 months for 4 years. Eligible men provided informed 
consent with the help of a trained study team member. All study 
procedures were approved by the human-subjects’ committees 
at each study site. All men received nominal compensation for 
their participation.
Data Collection
Risk Factor Questionnaire
At enrollment, men completed an 88-item computer-assisted 
self-interview (CASI) to collect information on sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, sexual behavior history, alcohol and 
tobacco consumption, and condom use practices. At each fol-
low-up visit, participants completed a similar CASI question-
naire about their substance use and sexual behavior since the 
prior visit.
HPV Genital Sampling and Genotyping
At each visit, 3 different prewetted polyethylene terephthal-
ate–tipped swabs were used to sample the glans penis/coronal 
sulcus, the shaft, and the scrotum of participants, and swab 
specimens were later combined to produce a single sample 
for the detection of genital HPV. All samples were stored at 
−80°C until genotyping. Samples underwent DNA extraction 
using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 
Briefly, 200-µL aliquots of samples were digested with 20 µL of 
proteinase K solution for 1 hour at 65°C, followed by 200 µL 
of lysis buffer [6]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analy-
sis was performed within 36 hours after extraction. Samples 
were tested for the presence of HPV, using the PCR consen-
sus primer system (PGMY 09/11) [7]. HPV genotyping was 
conducted using the Linear Array assay (Roche Diagnostics, 
Indianapolis, IN) by amplifying 50 µL of the DNA extracts to 
detect 36 HPV types. All plates included negative (nontem-
plate controls) and positive controls (CaSki) to control for 
possible contamination. Only samples that tested positive for 
β-globin or an HPV genotype were considered adequate and 
included in the analysis. HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 
51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68 were classified as high risk, and HPV 
types 6, 11, 26, 34, 40, 42, 44, 53, 54, 61, 62, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 
72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, and 89 as low risk. While oral and anal 
specimens were collected from a subset of men in the HIM 
study, this analysis relied on genital specimens collected from 
all men at every study visit.
Data Analysis
Men were classified as virgins (n = 88) or nonvirgins 
(n = 3834) at baseline (Supplementary Figure 1). The criteria 
have been described in detail elsewhere [5]. Specifically, men 
were defined as virgins at baseline if they (1) denied any his-
tory of penetrative vaginal, oral, and anal sexual intercourse; 
(2) had negative results of all study-based tests for sexually 
transmitted infections (other than HPV); (3) self-reported 
being HIV negative; (4) had a marital status of single, never 
married; and (5) were negative for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 
antibodies. Men were defined as virgins not initiating sex if 
they reported no penetrative sex during follow-up. Men were 
defined as virgins initiating sex if they reported any penetra-
tive sex during follow-up. Only men with HPV test results 
and sexual behavior information during follow-up visits were 
included for analysis.
Potential risk factors based on previous male HPV studies 
were selected for analyses, including age (continuous), res-
idence, race, ethnicity, education level, number of alcoholic 
drinks in the past month, cigarette smoking status, circumci-
sion status, and number of sex partners. The number of alco-
holic drinks in the past month was categorized as 0, 1–60, and 
>60 drinks [8]. Men who smoked >100 cigarettes in their life-
time and currently smoke were classified as current smokers. 
Men who smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime but did not 
smoke at baseline were classified as former smokers, and the 
rest were classified as never smokers.
Only men who tested negative at baseline for any type-spe-
cific HPV infection were included in incidence analysis. The first 
positive HPV test result following a type-specific negative HPV 
test result at baseline was considered indicative of incident HPV 
infection. The first positive HPV test result after sexual debut 
among individuals for whom all prior HPV test results were 
negative was considered indicative of incident HPV infection 
after sexual debut. A positive test result for any of the 36 HPV 
genotypes was considered indicative of incident infection with 
any HPV type. A positive test result for at least 1 high-risk HPV 
genotype was considered indicative of incident infection with a 
high-risk HPV type. A positive test result for at least 1 low-risk 
HPV genotype was considered indicative of incident infection 
with a low-risk HPV type. The analytical unit was an individual 
since only the first incident infection was considered. The time 
to HPV infection was estimated as the difference between the 
date of cohort entry and the date of HPV acquisition. Men who 
were free of HPV infection at the last visit were censored. The 
time to sexual debut was estimated as the difference between 
the date of study entry and the date of the visit when penetrative 
sex was first reported. For example, if a virgin at visit 1 initi-
ated sex at visit 3, then the time to sexual debut would be the 
interval from visit 1 to visit 3. The time to HPV infection after 
sexual debut was estimated as the difference between the date 
of the visit when sexual debut was reported and the date of the 
subsequent visit when HPV infection was first detected in the 
participant. The cumulative risk of incident HPV infection was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests 
used to identify differences in incidence between virgins who

did and those who did not initiate sex during the follow-up 
period. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence rates 
were calculated on the basis of the number of events modeled as 
a Poisson variable for the total person-months. Incidence rates 
were not adjusted.
Persistent infection was defined as at least 2 consecutive 
positive HPV type–specific test results with an interval of 
≥6 months between tests. For persistence analyses, the ana-
lytic unit was an individual. Both incident and prevalent 
infections were included. The Mantel-Haenszel χ2 test for 
trend was used to test the trend of persistent infection among 
nonvirgins, virgins initiating sex, and virgins not initiating 
sex, given their ordinal nature (ie, nonvirgins had established 
sexual behavior, virgins initiating sex had newly initiated 
sexual behavior, and virgins not initiating sex had no sexual 
behavior).
For clearance analyses, the analytical unit was the infec-
tion because an individual could have multiple HPV geno-
type infections, with each genotype considered as a separate 
infection. Two consecutive negative HPV test results fol-
lowing a positive HPV test result was considered indicative 
of HPV clearance. Infections detected for the first time at 
the last visit were excluded. The time to HPV clearance was 
approximated by the difference between the time of the first 
positive HPV test result and the time of the first negative test 
result among the 2 consecutive tests with negative results. 
The clustered Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the 
median number of months to clearance for any HPV type. 
Men whose HPV infection was not cleared by the last visit 
were censored. The number of sex partners was entered in 
the model as a time-varying covariate. Prevalent HPV infec-
tions at baseline were adjusted for in the models, to con-
trol the impact of HPV infection status at baseline on HPV 
clearance.
The association between possible risk factors and HPV 
incidence and HPV clearance was assessed with hazard rates 
derived from Cox proportional hazards models, using a robust 
covariance matrix estimator and including number of sex part-
ners as a time-varying covariate. For all modeling, factors with 
a P value of < .25 from bivariate analysis were included in mul-
tivariable regression using complete case analysis. Directed acy-
clic graphs [9, 10] identified age and country of residence as 
potential confounders, and both variables were retained in all 
multivariable models. A backward variable selection method 
was used to remove, one by one, variables that were not sta-
tistically significant (ie, those with P value of > .05). The pro-
portional hazards assumption for all independent variables was 
examined by log-log survival curves. Data cleaning and statis-
tical analysis were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; 
SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (version 3.2.4, revised; R Project 
for Statistical Computing). All statistical tests were 2-sided and 
used an α threshold of 0.05.
RESULTS
Of 88 virgins at baseline, one was excluded from analysis 
because of missing information on sexual behavior during fol-
low-up visits. Of the remaining 87 virgins, 72.4% were aged 
18–24 years, 64.4% resided in Tampa, 49.4% were white, 71.3% 
were non-Hispanic, 82.8% never smoked, and 60.9% initiated

sex during follow-up (Table 1). The median follow-up time for 
nonvirgins, virgins initiating sex, and virgins not initiating sex 
was 38.2 months, 44.3 months, and 27.6 months, respectively. 
All 87 men completed at least 2 visits 6 months apart, with a 
median number of 7 visits. There was no difference in baseline 
characteristics (ie, age, residence, race, ethnicity, number of 
years of school, number of alcoholic drinks in the past month, 
cigarette smoking status, circumcision, virginity status, and 
HPV status) between men who returned for the 6-month visit 
and those lost to follow-up (data not shown). A total of 87.5% of 
men from Mexico and 64.3% from the United States completed 
≥5 follow-up visits, compared with 43.8% of men from Brazil 
(P = .03).
Among 53 virgins initiating sex, the average time from en-
tering the cohort to sex initiation was 14.0 months, with a 
median of 12.0 months and a range of 0.5–47.8 months. The 
majority (50 [94.3%]) initiated sex with a female sex partner, 
84.0% reported oral sex, 70.0% reported vaginal sex, 54% re-
ported both oral and vaginal sex, 30% reported oral sex only, 
and 16% reported vaginal sex only. All 3 men who initiated sex 
with men engaged in both oral and anal sex.
The incidence rates for any HPV infection among nonvir-
gins, virgins initiating sex, and virgins not initiating sex were 
28.8, 26.2, and 14.6 cases/1000 person-months, respectively 
(Table 2). Compared with nonvirgins, virgins initiating sex 
and virgins not initiating sex had a decreased risk of acquir-
ing low-risk HPV infections. Regardless of HPV grouping, a 
decreasing trend for infections persisting for ≥6 months was 
observed, with the highest frequency among nonvirgins, fol-
lowed by virgins initiating sex and virgins not initiating sex 
(Figure 1).
Among virgins initiating sex during follow-up, 28.7% and 
45.5% acquired any HPV infection within 12 and 24 months, 
respectively, of sex initiation. In comparison, 9.8% and 28.8% 
of virgins not initiating sex and 35.6% and 52.5% of nonvirgins 
acquired any HPV infection within 12 and 24 months, respec-
tively, although the difference was not statistically significant 
(Figure 2).
The median time to clearance of any incident HPV infec-
tion among nonvirgins, virgins initiating sex, and virgins not 
initiating sex was 7.4 months, 6.2 months, and 6.1 months, re-
spectively. Compared with nonvirgins, virgins not initiating sex 
were more likely to clear high-risk, 4-valent (HPV types 6, 11, 
16, and 18) and 9-valent (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 
and 58) HPV vaccine types. For example, virgins not initiating 
sex were 3.3 times (95% CI, 2.2–5.1) more likely to clear a high-
risk HPV infection as compared to nonvirgins (Table 3).
After combining virgins initiating sex and virgins not initiat-
ing sex, bivariate analysis including number of sex partners as 
a time-varying covariate revealed that acquisition of any HPV 
infection was significantly higher among men with >1 female 
sex partner in the past 6 months, compared with men who had 
0 sex partners in the past 6 months (Table 4). Virgins who were 
current smokers at baseline were more likely than never smokers

to clear a high-risk HPV infection. Men reporting 1 female sex 
partner (vs 0) in the past 6 months and men with incident (vs 
prevalent) HPV infection at baseline were less likely to clear a 
high-risk HPV infection.
Men who were older (vs younger), men reporting 1 female sex 
partner (vs 0) in the past 6 months, and men with incident (vs 
prevalent) HPV infection at baseline were less likely to clear a 
high-risk HPV infection in multivariable analysis (Table 5). Also, 
virgins who were current smokers at baseline were 2.12 times 
(95% CI, 1.16–3.89) more likely than never smokers to clear a 
high-risk HPV infection. No factors were associated with low-
risk HPV clearance and acquisition of HPV infection (data not 
shown).
DISCUSSION
This study followed men in 3 countries for up to 6 years 
and observed incident genital HPV infection among male 
virgins not initiating sex and rapid acquisition of genital 
HPV among men initiating sex. Within 24 months of sex-
ual debut, nearly half of virgins initiating sex acquired HPV. 
Genital HPV infection was more likely to persist in nonvir-
gins than in virgins initiating sex and virgins not initiating 
sex. The probability of clearing a high-risk HPV infection 
among virgins was significantly associated with younger age, 
current smoking, 0 female sex partners in the past 6 months, 
and prevalent HPV infection at baseline.

 HPV Acquisition, Persistence, and Clearance in Male Virgins • JID 2018:217 (1 March) • 773
While we are not aware of published data on HPV incidence 
among male virgins, 4 cohort studies reported the incidence 
of HPV infection among female virgins [11–14]. A study of 
148 university female students aged 18–20 years in the United 
States found that the 24-month cumulative incidence of HPV 
infection in virgins not initiating sex (n = 54) was 2.4% [11]. 
Another cohort study in the United States that followed girls 
aged 14–17 years every 3 months, with a median follow-up time 
of 5.2 years, detected HPV in 10 of 22 virgins not initiating sex 
(45.5%) during follow-up visits [13]. A cohort study of female 
students aged 16–25 years in Korea observed that 13% of 118 
virgins not initiating sex had HPV infection at the 1.5-year 
follow-up visit [12]. A study among 109 Tanzanian girls aged 
15–16 years before sexual debut reported an HPV incidence of 
23.3 cases/1000 person-months [14]. The acquisition of HPV 
infection in virgins in these studies and the male virgins in 
our study suggests that transmission occurs in the absence of 
penetrative sexual behavior, possibly through nonpenetrative 
sexual behavior, such as hand-genital and genital-genital con-
tact. Nonpenetrative sexual contact is common among virgins, 
with a study of adolescent virgins reporting that approximately 
30% of self-reported virgins had engaged in masturbation with 
a partner in the last year [15]. Winer et al [11] reported that any 
type of nonpenetrative sexual contact increased the risk of HPV 
infection in female virgins. While comparisons between these 
female studies and our study are difficult, in the present study, 
after penetrative sex initiation, 45.5% of men acquired HPV 
within 24 months, which is similar to the 24-month incidence 
(38.9%) reported in the study by Winer et al [11].
Persistent infections rarely occurred in men who did not ini-
tiate sex. Among virgins not initiating penetrative sex during 
follow-up, only 2 (5.9%) had incident infections due to any 
HPV type persisting for at least 6 months. This is a significantly 
lower proportion than among virgins initiating sex (27.8%) and 
nonvirgins (44.1%). This pattern of persistence is consistent 
with the idea that virgins not initiating sex may have had HPV 
deposition that did not involve infection of a basal cell, which 
is a necessary event for HPV to have a productive life cycle [3].
In our study, age was inversely associated with clearance of 
high-risk HPV infection among men who, at study baseline, 
had not initiated sex. Generally, age is not associated with HPV 
acquisition and clearance in sexually experienced men [6, 16], 
except that one study reported that the likelihood of HPV type 
6 and 16 clearance increased significantly for sexually experi-
enced men aged 55–70 years [17].
The present study found a positive association between cur-
rent smoking at baseline and clearance of high-risk HPV in 
baseline virgins. However, other HIM study data suggest that 
smoking was not associated with HPV clearance in primarily 
nonvirgins [18]. It is possible that current smoking at baseline is 
a surrogate for other unmeasured behaviors, such as nonpene-
trative sexual behaviors.
Men with prevalent HPV infection at baseline were more 
likely than men with incident infection to clear any type and 
high-risk HPV infection. In additional analysis (data not 
shown), this association between prevalent or incident infec-
tion and clearance did not change after examining virgins ini-
tiating sex and virgins not initiating sex separately for any type 
HPV clearance (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, .20–1.31] for virgins 
initiating sex and 0.09 [95% CI, .01–1.10] for virgins not initi-
ating sex). This is contrary to previous findings among sexu-
ally experienced men that prevalent HPV infection is less likely 
than incident HPV infection to clear [19]. One possible reason 
is that prevalent HPV infection in male virgins may more likely 
represent simple HPV deposition, whereas prevalent infec-
tion among sexually experienced men may more likely reflect

infection of basal cells of the epidermis [3]. Whereas incident 
detection of HPV is more likely to represent productive infec-
tion occurring after sexual debut (rather than nonproductive 
infections occurring as a result of deposition). This is also in 
accordance with the present finding that a lower proportion

initiating sex and nonvirgins. Another alternative explana-
tion is that virgins who acquire HPV may be more likely to be

 HPV Acquisition, Persistence, and Clearance in Male Virgins • JID 2018:217 (1 March) • 775
immunologically naive than virgins with prevalent infection, as 
supported by our finding that prevalent infection was not asso-
ciated with 4-valent vaccine type clearance in male virgins test-
ing negative for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 antibodies at baseline; 
however, prior HIM study analyses did not find natural immu-
nity to be protective against HPV acquisition [20, 21].
This study is the first to examine HPV incidence, persistence, 
and clearance among male virgins. One strength is the inclusion 
of time-varying covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model 
to account for the change of behavior between multiple fol-
low-up visits. Limitations include the small sample size (n = 87) 
and therefore lower statistical power for detecting potential 
risk factors, especially factors with sparse data, such as ciga-
rette smoking, in which 72 men (82.8%) were never smokers 
and only 5 (5.7%) were ever smokers. Also, sexually active men 
may have been misclassified as virgins. However, the percent-
age of virgins (4.7%) in a recent population-based survey in the 
United States among males aged 20–44 years [22] was higher 
than in this study (2.2%). Possibly more likely is that men who 
are virgins might claim penetrative sexual behavior, given social 
desirability bias [23, 24]; however, CASIs are known to reduce 
this bias [25, 26]. Another limitation is the possibility that 
HPV acquisition and clearance were underestimated owing to 
use of a 6-month interval for follow-up visits. Men might be 
infected and clear an infection between visits. Additionally, the 
estimates for the association might be biased without adjust-
ment for effects of unmeasured nonpenetrative sexual behavior 
that could still transmit HPV. The estimates for the association 
might also be biased, even though sex initiation was adjusted 
for by the number of recent female sex partners. Last, the gener-
alizability of the study results may be limited because most male 
virgins were from Tampa, were non-Hispanic, and were white.
In conclusion, virgins acquired low-risk HPV infections sig-
nificantly more slowly than nonvirgins. Virgins not initiating 
sex cleared any high-risk, 4-valent vaccine, and 9-valent vaccine 
HPV types significantly faster than nonvirgins. It is postulated 
that nonpenetrative sexual contact is a possible route for HPV 
acquisition among virgins not initiating sex, although these 
infections may include detection of nonproductive infections. 
After penetrative sex initiation, 45.5% of men acquired HPV 
within 24 months, which is similar to findings reported for 
women. These findings highlight the rapid acquisition of HPV 
after sexual debut among men and thus emphasize the impor-
tance of HPV vaccination before sexual debut. However, as men 
remain at risk for HPV infection throughout their lives, HPV 
vaccination at older ages provides benefit. Future prospective 
studies with a larger sample of virgins that collect informa-
tion on nonpenetrative sex behavior (eg, penile-hand contact, 
penile-vulvar contact, and deep kissing) and sample HPV from 
nonpenile sites (eg, hand, oral, and anal sites) are necessary to 
better understand HPV transmission among virgins.
