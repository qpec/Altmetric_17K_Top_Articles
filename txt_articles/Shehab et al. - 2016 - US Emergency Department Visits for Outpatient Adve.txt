IMPORTANCE The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 brought attention to
adverse drug events in national patient safety efforts. Updated, detailed, nationally
representative data describing adverse drug events can help focus these efforts.
OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits for adverse
drug events in the United States in 2013-2014 and describe changes in ED visits for adverse
drug events since 2005-2006.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Active, nationally representative, public health
surveillance in 58 EDs located in the United States and participating in the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project.
EXPOSURES Drugs implicated in ED visits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES National weighted estimates of ED visits and subsequent
hospitalizations for adverse drug events.
RESULTS Based on data from 42 585 cases, an estimated 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1-5.0) ED visits for
adverse drug events occurred per 1000 individuals annually in 2013 and 2014 and 27.3%
(95% CI, 22.2%-32.4%) of ED visits for adverse drug events resulted in hospitalization. An
estimated 34.5% (95% CI, 30.3%-38.8%) of ED visits for adverse drug events occurred
among adults aged 65 years or older in 2013-2014 compared with an estimated 25.6% (95%
CI, 21.1%-30.0%) in 2005-2006; older adults experienced the highest hospitalization rates
(43.6%; 95% CI, 36.6%-50.5%). Anticoagulants, antibiotics, and diabetes agents were
implicated in an estimated 46.9% (95% CI, 44.2%-49.7%) of ED visits for adverse drug
events, which included clinically significant adverse events, such as hemorrhage
(anticoagulants), moderate to severe allergic reactions (antibiotics), and hypoglycemia with
moderate to severe neurological effects (diabetes agents). Since 2005-2006, the
proportions of ED visits for adverse drug events from anticoagulants and diabetes agents
have increased, whereas the proportion from antibiotics has decreased. Among children aged
5 years or younger, antibiotics were the most common drug class implicated (56.4%; 95% CI,
51.8%-61.0%). Among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years, antibiotics also were the
most common drug class implicated (31.8%; 95% CI, 28.7%-34.9%) in ED visits for adverse
drug events, followed by antipsychotics (4.5%; 95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among older adults
(aged �65 years), 3 drug classes (anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioid analgesics)
were implicated in an estimated 59.9% (95% CI, 56.8%-62.9%) of ED visits for adverse drug
events; 4 anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and enoxaparin) and 5 diabetes
agents (insulin and 4 oral agents) were among the 15 most common drugs implicated.
Medications to always avoid in older adults according to Beers criteria were implicated in
1.8% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%) of ED visits for adverse drug events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of emergency department visits for adverse
drug events in the United States was estimated to be 4 per 1000 individuals in 2013 and
2014. The most common drug classes implicated were anticoagulants, antibiotics, diabetes
agents, and opioid analgesics.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention col-
laborates with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission
and the US Food and Drug Administration to conduct active,
nationally representative public health surveillance for out-
patient adverse drug events resulting in emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits.4 The purpose of this study was to describe
ED visits for adverse drug events in 2013-2014 to help ad-
vance medication safety initiatives for outpatient settings.
Methods
Data Sources and Data Collection Methods
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–
Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES)
project is an active public health surveillance system based on
anationallyrepresentative,size-stratifiedprobabilitysampleof
US hospitals (excluding psychiatric and penal institutions) that
have a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour emergency depart-
ment, with 4 strata based on hospital size (assessed by the total
number of annual ED visits), and 1 pediatric hospital stratum.5
Since 2004, between 58 and 63 hospitals have participated in
the NEISS-CADES project.
Asdescribedpreviously,4trainedConsumerProductSafety
Commission data abstractors at each hospital review the clini-
calrecordsofeveryEDvisittoidentifyanyclinician-diagnosed
adverse drug events that are the reason for the ED visit, and re-
portupto2medicationsimplicatedintheadverseevent,aswell
asanyconcomitantmedicationsdocumentedinthemedicalrec-
ord. Abstractors also record narrative descriptions of adverse
drug events, including preceding events, clinician diagnosis or
clinical impression, “chief complaint,
” clinical and laboratory
testing, treatments administered in the ED or by emergency
medical services, and discharge disposition.
Reports were coded by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Ac-
tivities version 9.1 to describe diagnosis, symptoms, and, if
documented, medication errors. Names of implicated drugs
were standardized to active ingredients. Data collection from
the NEISS-CADES project hospitals has been deemed a public
health surveillance activity by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention human subject oversight bodies and did
not require institutional review board approval.6
Definitions
Cases included ED visits in which prescription or over-the-
counter medications, dietary supplements (eg, herbals, vita-
mins,orminerals),homeopathicproducts,orvaccineswereim-
plicated in the adverse events. Adverse drug events were
classified as adverse effects, allergic reactions, supratherapeu-
tic effects or excess dose, secondary effects (such as choking
or injection site reactions), unsupervised ingestion by a
child, or vaccination reactions. Drug withdrawal, drug thera-
peutic failures, occupational exposures, intentional self-
harm, recreational drug use or abuse, and adverse events from
treatments received in the ED were excluded. Follow-up visits
for previously diagnosed adverse drug events and deaths in or
en route to the ED also were excluded.
Potentially inappropriate medications for older adults in-
cluded all drugs in the American Geriatrics Society’
s 2015 up-
datedBeerscriteriaforpotentiallyinappropriatemedicationuse,
except for insulin (inappropriate in sliding scale doses) and
aspirin (inappropriate at doses >325 mg/d).3 Potentially inap-
propriatemedicationsto“alwaysavoid”(themostcommonad-
aptation of the Beers criteria in national health care quality
measures7,8) included drugs considered potentially inappro-
priate for any indication or in any dose, duration, or formula-
tion,suchasfirst-generationantihistamines,skeletalmusclere-
laxants, and short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines.
Medication errors included (1) administration of incorrect
drugs;(2)incorrectdose,schedule,rate,duration,orsiteofdrug
administration (including accidental needle stick); and (3) ad-

Key Points
Question What are the characteristics of adverse drug events that
lead to US emergency department (ED) visits?
Findings Based on 2013-2014 nationally representative surveillance
data, an estimated 4 ED visits for adverse drug events occurred per
1000 individuals annually. Among children (aged �5 years),
antibiotics were most commonly implicated; among older children
and adolescents (aged 6-19 years), antibiotics were most commonly
implicated, followed by antipsychotics; and among older adults
(aged �65 years), anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioid
analgesics were implicated in approximately 60% of ED visits for
adverse drug events.
Meaning Adverse drug events from anticoagulants, antibiotics,
diabetes agents, opioid analgesics, and antipsychotics are a common
reason for ED visits and may benefit from patient safety initiatives.

mates were considered free of sampling error.9 Nationally
projected (estimated) proportions of ED visits and hospital-
izations with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the
SURVEYMEANSprocedureinSASversion9.3(SASInstituteInc)
to account for sample weights and complex sample design.
Estimates based on small numbers of cases (<20) are con-
sidered statistically unreliable and are not shown. Estimates
with a coefficient of variation greater than 30% may be statis-
tically unreliable and are noted. Select estimated population
rates and proportions of ED visits for adverse drug events in
2013-2014 were compared with estimates from 2005-2006.
Results
Based on 42 585 cases, there were an estimated 4.0 (95% CI,
3.1-5.0) ED visits for adverse drug events per 1000 individu-
als annually in the United States in 2013-2014. An estimated
34.5% (95% CI, 30.3%-38.8%) of ED visits for adverse drug
events occurred in older adults (aged ≥65 years) in 2013-2014
(Table 1) compared with an estimated 25.6% (95% CI, 21.1%-
30.0%) in 2005-2006 (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The popu-
lation rate of ED visits for adverse drug events among older
adults(aged≥65years)was9.7(95%CI,6.6-12.9)visitsper1000
individuals compared with 3.1 (95% CI, 2.6-3.6) visits per 1000

(eTable 2 in the Supplement). More ED visits for adverse drug
events involved females (57.1%; 95% CI, 55.6%-58.7%).
A single medication was implicated in most ED visits for
adverse drug events (83.8%; 95% CI, 81.5%-86.1%). Supra-
therapeutic effects or ingestion of excess dose was the most
common type of adverse drug event (37.2%; 95% CI, 34.7%-
39.6%). Medication errors were documented in 1 of 10 ED vis-
its for adverse drug events (10.5%; 95% CI, 8.9%-12.2%).
An estimated 27.3% (95% CI, 22.2%-32.4%) of ED visits for
adverse drug events resulted in hospitalization. Hospitaliza-
tion rates were highest for older adults (aged ≥65 years), of
whom an estimated 43.6% (95% CI, 36.6%-50.5%) were hos-
pitalized. When adjusted for the US population, the hospital-
izationrateforadversedrugeventsamongadultsaged65years
or older was 7 times higher (4.2 [95% CI, 2.5-6.0] hospitaliza-
tionsper1000individuals)thanforthoseyoungerthan65years
(0.6 [95% CI, 0.4-0.8] hospitalizations per 1000 individuals).
In 2013-2014, the most commonly implicated drug classes
wereanticoagulants(17.6%),systemicallyadministered(oralor
injectable)antibiotics(16.1%),diabetesagents(13.3%),opioidan-
algesics (6.8%), antiplatelets (6.6%), renin-angiotensin system
inhibitors (3.5%), antineoplastic agents (3.0%), and sedative or
hypnoticagents(3.0%)(Table2).Thetop3drugclasses(antico-
agulants,antibiotics,anddiabetesagents)wereimplicatedinan
estimated46.9%(95%CI,44.2%-49.7%)ofEDvisitsforadverse
drug events. Since 2005-2006, the proportions of ED visits for
adversedrugeventsinvolvinganticoagulants,antiplatelets,and
diabetesagentshaveincreased,whereastheproportioninvolv-
ing antibiotics has decreased (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Hospitalization rates were highest for ED visits for adverse
drug events in which digitalis glycosides (82.1%), antineoplas-
tic agents (59.7%), immune modulators (55.7%), oral diabetes
agents(53.0%),andanticoagulants(48.8%)wereimplicated,and
lowest for ED visits in which vaccines (3.0%), dermatologic
agents (3.6%), and systemically administered antibiotics (7.1%)
were implicated; however, the hospitalization rate for ED visits
for adverse drug events from quinolone antibiotics was higher
(14.5%) than the rates for all other antibiotic classes.
The most common drug products implicated in ED visits
for adverse drug events varied by patient age (Table 3). Among
children and adolescents aged 19 years or younger, the 15 most
common drug products implicated were involved in an esti-
mated 49.9% (95% CI, 46.8%-53.0%) of ED visits for adverse
drug events, excluding unsupervised ingestions by children.
Eight of the 15 most common drug products implicated in ED
visitsamongchildrenandadolescentsaged19yearsoryounger
were antibiotics, and 2 were neuropsychiatric agents (meth-
ylphenidate and risperidone).
Among children aged 5 years or younger, antibiotics alone
were the most common drug class implicated in ED visits for
adverse drug events (56.4%; 95% CI, 51.8%-61.0%). Among
children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years, antibiotics were
implicated in 31.8% (95% CI, 28.7%-34.9%) of ED visits for ad-
versedrugevents(Table4andeFigureintheSupplement).An-
tipsychotics alone were the second most common singly im-
plicated drug class among children and adolescents aged 6 to
19 years comprising 4.5% (95% CI, 3.3%-5.6%) of estimated ED
visits for adverse drug events. In this age group, at least 1 neu-
ropsychiatric agent (anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antipsy-
chotic, opioid analgesic, sedative or hypnotic agent, or stimu-
lant) was implicated in an estimated 23.5% (95% CI, 21.1%-
26.1%) of ED visits for adverse drug events.
Amongolderadults,the15mostcommondrugproductsim-
plicated were involved in an estimated 68.5% (95% CI, 64.5%-
72.5%) of ED visits for adverse drug events (Table 4). Four of
the 15 most common drug products implicated in ED visits for
adverse drug events among older adults were anticoagulants
(warfarin,rivaroxaban,dabigatran,andenoxaparin)and5were
diabetes agents (insulin, metformin, glipizide, glyburide, and
glimepiride). Anticoagulants alone were implicated in 27.5%
(95%CI,23.3%-31.7%)ofEDvisitsforadversedrugeventsamong
adults aged 65 to 79 years and in 38.8% (95% CI, 33.7%-43.8%)
of ED visits for adverse drug events among those aged 80 years
or older (Table 4 and eFigure in the Supplement).
Warfarin was implicated in an estimated 85.7% (95% CI,
82.8%-88.6%)ofEDvisitsforanticoagulantadversedrugevents
among older adults (aged ≥65 years) and target-specific oral
anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban) were
implicated in an estimated 12.0% (95% CI, 8.9%-15.1%) of ED
visits for anticoagulant adverse drug events. Among older
adults, the hospitalization rate for ED visits for adverse drug
eventsfromtarget-specificoralanticoagulants(55.7%;95%CI,
45.6%-65.9%)wassimilartotherateforwarfarin(49.8%;95%
CI, 42.9%-56.7%).
Three drug classes (anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and
opioid analgesics) recently targeted by federal patient safety
initiatives4 were implicated in an estimated 59.9% (95% CI,
56.8%-62.9%) of ED visits for adverse drug events among older
adults (aged ≥65 years). Potentially inappropriate medica-
tions according to the Beers criteria were implicated in an es-
timated3.4%(95%CI,2.8%-4.0%)ofEDvisitsforadversedrug
events and potentially inappropriate medications to always
avoid were implicated in 1.8% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%) of ED vis-
its for adverse drug events.
The most commonly implicated drug classes were in-
volved in clinically significant adverse events (Table 5). There
was documented hemorrhage in an estimated 79.4% (95% CI,
75.2%-83.6%) of ED visits for adverse drug events involving
anticoagulants alone; moderate to severe allergic reactions in
an estimated 18.2% (95% CI, 15.4%-21.0%) of ED visits for ad-
verse drug events involving antibiotics alone; hypoglycemia
with moderate to severe neurological effects (eg, loss of con-
sciousnessoralteredmentalstatus)inanestimated47.6%(95%
CI, 39.4%-55.7%) of ED visits for adverse drug events involv-
ing diabetes agents alone; and moderate to severe neurologi-
cal effects in an estimated 33.9% (95% CI, 29.1%-38.7%) of ED
visitsforadversedrugeventsinvolvingopioidanalgesicsalone.
Discussion
The most common drug classes implicated in ED visits for ad-
verse drug events in the United States are the same ones iden-
tified a decade ago—anticoagulants, antibiotics, diabetes
agents, and opioid analgesics.4 Even after accounting for pre-
scribing frequency, the rate of ED visits for adverse drug events

found to outweigh benefits for many outpatient upper respi-

children13 and antibiotics continue to account for most ED vis-
its for adverse drug events among young children.11 More than
half of US antibiotic prescriptions for children aged 14 years
or younger are for acute respiratory tract infections, which are
commonly viral, or infections for which watchful waiting is
recommended.14 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use with
interventions, such as clinical decision support and bench-
marking of outpatient prescribing rates, may help to reduce
the risk of medication harms and antimicrobial resistance.15
Antipsychotics were the second most commonly impli-
cated drug class in ED visits for adverse drug events among
older children and adolescents. The American Psychiatric As-
sociation currently warns against using antipsychotics as
first-line therapy in children and adolescents for conditions
other than psychotic disorders16; however, antipsychotic pre-
scribing has increased sharply during the last 2 decades.17 Up
to 75% of antipsychotic use in children and adolescents is es-
timated to be for off-label indications and there is evidence of
low adherence to recommendations for safety monitoring.18,19
Quality reporting measures and revisions to payment poli-
cies have reduced unnecessary use of antipsychotic prescrip-
tions among older adults (aged ≥65 years).20 Improving safe
use of antipsychotics in children and adolescents may re-
quire similar strategies.
The proportion of ED visits for adverse drug events involv-
ing anticoagulants has increased during the last decade along
with increased anticoagulant use. From 2009 to 2014, oral an-
ticoagulantuseincreasedbyapproximately38%,21whereasthe
proportion of ED visits for anticoagulants increased by 57%
(eTable3intheSupplement).TheadditionalincreaseinEDvis-
its for anticoagulant adverse drug events may be from im-
proved case identification since 2006, when data abstractors
received supplemental training after anticoagulant adverse
drug events were found to be underidentified.22
Although not all anticoagulant-related bleeding is prevent-
able, anticoagulant management services and patient self-
testing and self-management programs have been shown to re-
duceadversedrugeventsfromanticoagulants.23However,most
outpatientsdonotparticipateintheseprograms,24,25andthese
strategiesarenotwellincentivizedunderpublicandprivatepayer
safety policies for patients.26 A recent report from the US De-
partment of Health and Human Services calls for enhanced ad-
verse drug event prevention efforts for anticoagulants.26
New clinical performance improvement measures for sys-
tematic and coordinated outpatient management of antico-
agulants have been introduced by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services as part of the Merit-Based Incentive Pay-
ment System and will replace the sustainable growth rate for-
mula payment structure for many physicians.27 It is un-
knownwhetherpaymentpoliciesthatincentivizepracticesand
physicians to more optimally manage anticoagulant treat-
ments will reduce the burden of adverse drug events; how-
ever, the recognition by a national quality payment program
of the value of evidence-based anticoagulant management in
improving the quality of care for older adults (aged ≥65 years)
is an important step toward improving anticoagulant use.

adults(aged≥65years)owingtotheavailabilityofsaferormore
effective alternatives.3 The Beers criteria also include poten-
tially inappropriate medications to be avoided under certain
circumstances, such as long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatorydrugsandproton-pumpinhibitors.3Amongolder
adults, potentially inappropriate medications to always avoid
according to the most updated Beers criteria were implicated
in only 1.8% of estimated ED visits for adverse drug events and
all potentially inappropriate medications were implicated in
3.4% of estimated ED visits for adverse drug events in 2013-
2014. These findings are similar to the proportions of US ED
visits for adverse drug events from potentially inappropriate
medications identified in 2004-2005.10
Theprevalenceofpotentiallyinappropriatemedicationuse
in older adults (aged ≥65 years) remains high,29 suggesting that
the Beers criteria have limited utility in identifying patient
populations who are at highest risk for adverse drug events.
Despite the Beers criteria being primarily intended for prac-
ticing clinicians as a useful tool to guide clinical decision mak-
ing for an individual patient,3 the criteria have become one of
the primary methods for assessment of patient safety in older
adults used by public and private payers,7,8 supplanting other
interventions that may have a larger effect on outpatient medi-
cation safety. For example, diabetes agents were implicated in
1 of 8 ED visits for adverse drug events overall and in 1 of 5 ED
visits for adverse drug events among older adults. Recent dia-
betes treatment guidelines recommend increasing glycemic
thresholds for older patients at risk for hypoglycemia, particu-
larly those with certain comorbidities or limited life expec-
tancy, and residing in long-term care facilities.30-32
There are a number of study limitations that likely lead to
underestimation of outpatient adverse drug events. First, this
studyincludesonlyadversedrugeventsdiagnosedandtreated
in EDs; patients directly admitted or treated in other settings
(eg, physician offices) are not included. Second, ED physi-
cians are less likely to identify low-severity or insidious ad-
verse drug events, those that do not contribute to the pa-
tient’
s “chief complaint,” and those that require extensive
evaluation to diagnose.33,34 Third, fatal adverse drug events
are not included because ED documentation practices vary for
recording deaths. Fourth, estimates do not include visits re-
lated to pharmaceutical abuse or self-harm attempts.
The rapid increase in mortality from opioid analgesics in
the United States has been well documented35; however, up-
datednationalmorbiditydataonpharmaceuticalabusearelim-
ited. Future inclusion of ED visits from abuse or self-harm of
pharmaceutical products in the NEISS-CADES project is
planned. Fifth, per-prescription rates of ED visits for adverse
drug events, which can more accurately identify the direc-
tion of trends, were not calculated. Sixth, the NEISS-CADES
project data are based on a sample of US hospital EDs and not
a census; therefore, estimates are subject to sampling errors.
Direct comparison with previously published estimates of
adverse drug events from other sources is challenging. Anti-
coagulants, diabetes agents, and opioid analgesics also have
been identified as the most common causes of medication-
related harm in both inpatient and long-term care settings.26
StudiesusingInternationalClassificationofDiseases(ICD)codes
to identify ED visits for adverse drug events have found lower
estimates during previous years,36 but ICD codes have low sen-
sitivity for identifying adverse drug events.37 Other nation-
ally representative diagnostic code–based studies have iden-
tifiedadditionaldrugclasses(eg,corticosteroids)tobecommon
causes of adverse drug events; however, without supporting
clinical data, it is uncertain if these ED visits represent drug-
induced harm or another drug-related problem, such as non-
adherence or inadequate treatment.38
Some studies using pharmacist case review to identify ad-
verse drug events resulting in ED visits have found additional
events and drugs that ED physicians did not document. How-
ever, these studies used a broader outcome of medication-
related “problems” that included nonadherence, therapeutic
failures, and lack of therapy.33,39 Failing to prescribe or take a
druglimitseffectiveness,butisnotanadversedrugevent(harm
caused by the use of a drug).40 Distinguishing conditions due
to the absence of therapy from those due to drug-induced ef-
fects is necessary to implement appropriate interventions. Im-
proving recognition of adverse drug events by ED physicians is
certainly important, but in the interim there is ample opportu-
nity to improve patient safety by focusing attention on the ad-
verse drug events consistently found to be common, serious,
and measurable. Targeting adverse drug events due to antico-
agulants and diabetes agents in the inpatient setting has con-
tributed to reductions in health care–related harm in US
hospitals.41,42 Achieving measurable reductions in outpatient
adversedrugeventsmayalsorequirefocusingonthemostcom-
mon drugs implicated and the highest risk patients.
Conclusions
The prevalence of emergency department visits for adverse
drugeventsintheUnitedStateswasestimatedtobe4per1000
individuals in 2013 and 2014. The most common drug classes
implicated were anticoagulants, antibiotics, diabetes agents,
and opioid analgesics.
