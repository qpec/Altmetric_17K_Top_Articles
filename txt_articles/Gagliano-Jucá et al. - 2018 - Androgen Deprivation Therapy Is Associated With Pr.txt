Context: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with increased
cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death, with some events occurring early after initiation of
ADT. Testosterone levels are inversely associated with corrected QT (QTc) interval duration; therefore,
prolongation of QTc duration could be responsible for some of these events during ADT.
Objective: To evaluate changes in QTc duration during ADT.
Design and Interventions: A 6-month prospective cohort study that enrolled men with PCa about to
undergo ADT (ADT group) and a control group of men who previously underwent prostatectomy for PCa
and never received ADT (non-ADT group).
Patients: At study entry, all participants were eugonadal and had no history of cardiac arrhythmias or
complete bundle branch block.
Outcomes: Difference in change in QTc duration from baseline on a 12-lead electrocardiogram at 6, 12,
and 24 weeks after initiation of ADT compared with electrocardiograms performed at the same intervals
in the non-ADT group. PR, QRS, and QT interval durations were also evaluated.
Results: Seventy-one participants formed the analytical sample (33 ADT and 38 non-ADT). ADT was
associated with prolongation of the QTc by 7.4 ms compared with the non-ADT group [95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.08 to 14.7 ms; P = 0.048]. ADT was also associated with shortening of the QRS interval by
2.4 ms (95% CI 24.64 to 20.23; P = 0.031). Electrolytes did not change.
Conclusions: Men undergoing ADT for PCa experienced prolongation of the QTc. These findings might
explain the increased risk of sudden cardiac death seen in these patients.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common nondermatological cancer in men [1, 2]. As prostate
is an androgen-dependent tissue [3], androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the
cornerstone of treatment in men with locally invasive and metastatic PCa [4, 5]. The goal of
ADT is to lower serum testosterone levels into the castrate range (,50 ng/dL; to convert to
nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347) [6], which can be achieved surgically (bilateral
orchiectomy) or medically [gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists].
Although ADT has beneficial effects in a subset of patients, the profound androgen deficiency
that results from ADT is associated with a number of adverse effects including sexual
dysfunction, osteoporosis, hot flashes, and changes in body composition [7, 8]. Additionally,
ADT is also associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [9–11], as
well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [12, 13]. Some studies have reported that
cardiovascular events, including sudden cardiac death, occur early after initiation of ADT
[13]. As metabolic changes and progression of atherosclerosis occur gradually over years, the
mechanisms that predispose patients to these early events remain unclear.
Although much has been written about cardiovascular complications of ADT, one aspect
that has not been investigated in a controlled setting is the potential effect of ADT on the
cardiac conduction system. In an electrocardiogram (ECG), ventricular depolarization and
repolarization are represented by the QRS complex and T wave, respectively. The QT interval
duration corresponds to the total time from ventricular depolarization to repolarization. The
QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) has been widely used in clinical settings to assess
the risk of arrhythmias; indeed, prolongation in QTc is considered a risk factor for tachy-
arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [14–16]. Previous studies have shown that gonadal
steroids, testosterone in particular, modulate QTc. Indeed, the QTc duration is similar in
newborn male and female babies [17], and no sex-related differences are observed before
10 years of age [18]. However, after puberty, the QTc significantly shortens in boys compared
with girls, suggesting a direct effect of testosterone production of cardiac conduction system
[19]. Studies in young men have shown that endogenous serum testosterone levels are in-
versely associated with QTc duration [20]. However, as men age, their QTc durations also
increase, which is associated with age-related decline in serum testosterone levels [21, 22].
Clinical trials in community-dwelling men with low serum testosterone levels have also
shown that testosterone administration is associated with shortening of QTc [23]. Hence, it is
conceivable that profound androgen deficiency that occurs because of ADT slows ventricular
repolarization and consequently leads to QTc prolongation, which, in turn, might predispose
these patients to cardiac arrhythmias [24]. Indeed, a previous small, uncontrolled study had
also observed prolongation of QTc with ADT [25].
The Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Pain Perception (ADT and Pain) Study was a
prospective observational study that evaluated the impact of ADT on clinical and experimental
pain in men with nonmetastatic PCa and compared them to men with localized PCa who had
previously undergone prostatectomy and were in remission [26]. The present substudy was
designed to assess the impact of ADT-induced androgen deficiency on ECG parameters, in
particular QTc. The prospective study design allowed us to follow participants prospectively
in a systematic way by performing serial ECGs at the same time intervals in both cohorts.
1. Methods
A. Study Design and Participants
The ADT and Pain Study was a prospective cohort study designed to evaluate changes in pain
perception and tolerance in men undergoing ADT for PCa. Thirty-seven men about to undergo
medical ADT with GnRH agonist [22.5 mg leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot; TAP

 Pharmaceuticals)] every 3 months with a planned intervention of at least 6 months were
enrolled from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (ADT group). All men received an androgen
receptor antagonist (bicalutamide) during the first month of treatment to prevent tumor flare,
and half of them also received concurrent radiation therapy. Additionally, 40 men with PCa
who had undergone prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy for organ-confined PCa at least
6 months prior to enrollment and were in remission were also enrolled and served as the
control group; they were recruited from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (non-ADT group).
All men had normal serum total testosterone concentrations at the time of enrollment and
were free of any chronic pain condition. Other exclusion criteria included orchiectomy,
skeletal metastasis, use of opioid analgesics, peripheral neuropathy, painful inflammatory
conditions, use of glucocorticoids, diabetes, and moderate to severe depression as assessed by
the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire [27].
For the substudy described in this manuscript, participants with a history of cardiac
arrhythmias or complete bundle branch block at baseline were also excluded from the
analysis conforming to the American Heart Association recommendations regarding in-
terpretation of ECG [28]. Seventy-one men (33 in the ADT group and 38 in the non-ADT
group) formed the analytical sample for this substudy.
The ADT and Pain Study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). Enrollment took place between July 2013 and
April 2016; the last participant completed the study in November 2016. All participants
provided written informed consent.
B. Laboratory Measurement
Fasting serum samples were collected in the morning at baseline and each of the follow-up
visits for measurement of serum total testosterone levels using liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (the gold-standard method) that was performed in a Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention–certified laboratory. The lowest detection limit with this
method was 2 ng/dL [29]. Because sodium, potassium, and calcium play an important role in
cardiac conduction system [30], these electrolytes were also measured at baseline and at all
subsequent visits in all participants. Laboratory measurements and ECGs were performed on
the same day (within the time frame of an hour) at all study visits.
C. ECG
ECGs were performed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks into treatment in the ADT group.
In the non-ADT group, ECGs were performed at similar intervals after enrollment. Standard
12-lead ECGs were performed using the same equipment (GE MAC 800; GE Healthcare,
Marlborough, MA) and by the same technician at a speed of 25 mm/s and amplification of
0.1 mV/mm. The PR, QRS, and QT interval durations were measured electronically. The QTc
was calculated using the Fridericia QT correction formula [31], which provides the best
prediction of short- and long-term mortality [32].
D. Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to insure, conservatively, 80% power to detect a 24-week stan-
dardized difference in outcomes between ADT and non-ADT arms of at least 0.5, corre-
sponding to a difference in QTc duration of ~12 ms, provided the baseline and 24-week
measurements had intraindividual Pearson correlations of at least 0.5. This threshold was
well exceeded in practice; for instance, QTc durations at baseline and 24 weeks had Pearson
correlations of 0.67, and use of all three follow-up measurements (at 6, 12, and 24 weeks
postrandomization) increased the information available for analysis. Tabular and graphical
summaries were used to assess empirical evidence in favor of differences in ECG mea-
surements between ADT and non-ADT arms at baseline and over time. Outcome trends with
time were estimated using group- and time-specific means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

 Mixed-effects regression was used to estimate group differences at baseline and follow-up (the
latter was the average effect over the 24 weeks of intervention) using terms for group (ADT vs
non-ADT), time, and the interaction between the two and incorporating a random intercept at
the participant level to acknowledge serial correlation of repeated measurements. Statistical
significance was evaluated using Wald-type tests of the hypothesis that the true interaction
between treatment and time—that is, the influence of treatment on the trajectory of mean
change in outcomes with time—is zero.
2. Results
Seventy-one men (33 in the ADT group and 38 in the non-ADT group) met all eligibility
criteria for the present work and formed the analytical sample. The median age of the
participants was 66 years (range 53 to 89 years), and mean body mass index was 28.1 kg/m2
(range 21.9 to 37.7 kg/m2). Baseline characteristics of the participants are detailed in Table 1.
A. Serum Testosterone and Electrolytes
ADT successfully suppressed testosterone production [mean (standard deviation [SD]) 13
(8) ng/dL], whereas testosterone levels did not change in the non-ADT group [mean (SD) 473

 No meaningful changes were seen in any of the electrolytes in either group (Fig. 2).
B. ECG Parameters
B-1. QT and QTc intervals
Significant prolongation in the QTc was seen in men receiving ADT (estimated change 12 ms;
95% CI 6.4 to 17.5 ms; P , 0.001). This effect was still significant when compared with the non-
ADT group (treatment difference of 7.4 ms; 95% CI 0.08 to 14.7; P = 0.048; Table 2; Fig. 3).
As a QTc of .440 ms is considered abnormal in men [33], we analyzed those participants who
had normal QTc duration at baseline but exceeded this threshold during follow-up. Only 4
participants (12%) in the non-ADT group exceeded this threshold, whereas 12 subjects receiving
ADT (44%) exceeded a QTc of 440 ms during the course of the study (Fig. 4). Furthermore, among
subjects with a QTc .440 ms at baseline, there was a continued increase in QTc in five out of six
subjects in the ADT group, whereas no further increase was seen in the non-ADT group (Fig. 4).
ADT did not affect QT interval duration (Table 2; Fig. 3), with average time remaining
unchanged in both groups (treatment difference 3.6 ms; 95% CI 26.9 to 14.0 ms; P = 0.5).
B-2. QRS complex interval
Men undergoing ADT experienced significant shortening of the QRS complex interval
(treatment difference 22.4 ms; 95% CI 24.6 to 20.23 ms; P = 0.031; Table 2; Fig. 3) compared
with the participants not receiving ADT.
B-3. PR interval
ADT did not affect PR interval duration (Table 2; Fig. 3), with average time remaining
unchanged in both groups (treatment difference 0.84 ms; 95% CI 24.3 to 6.0 ms; P = 0.75).
C. Adverse Events
Few adverse events were observed during the 24-week duration of the study. Three car-
diovascular events were observed in participants in the non-ADT group (one exacerbation

 of hypertension, one syncope, and one atrial fibrillation), whereas two events were
seen in the ADT group (one ventricular tachycardia and one exacerbation of hyper-
tension). No deaths occurred in either group. Vasomotor symptoms were seen in men
undergoing ADT.
3. Discussion
ADT is increasingly being used in the management of PCa [1–4]. Although ADT improves
survival in a subset of patients, it has been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality in some studies [34]. Some reports have suggested that cardiovascular events,
including sudden death, occur soon after initiation of ADT [13, 35]. As atherosclerosis is a slow
process [7, 9], these early events suggest effects of ADT on the cardiac conduction system.
Population studies have shown that endogenous serum testosterone levels are inversely
associated with QTc duration [36–38]. Indeed, clinical trials have shown that testosterone
administration is associated with shortening of QTc [23, 39]. Therefore, withdrawal of tes-
tosterone could lead to prolongation of QTc, which in turn could predispose these patients to
arrhythmias. We found that ADT with GnRH agonists leads to marked prolongation of QTc
(mean increase of 7 ms), and the US Food and Drug Administration considers this increase in
QTc clinically relevant [40]. Indeed, prolongation of QTc is independently associated with
cardiovascular mortality and sudden death [15, 41–44]. More participants in the ADT group
experienced increases in QTc that led to durations .440 ms, the threshold beyond which the
risk of arrhythmias increases [16, 40, 45, 46] compared with men in the non-ADT group.
Furthermore, the QTc duration continued to increase in those androgen-deprived par-
ticipants who already had baseline QTc of $440 ms, suggesting that ADT leads to pro-
longation of QTc irrespective of baseline value. Another important finding of the study
was the shortening of QRS complex duration, suggesting rapid ventricular depolarization.

 These findings are important and provide insight regarding the potential mechanisms by
which ADT might predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. These
findings, however, require further investigation.
As serum testosterone levels are inversely associated with QTc, it is likely that pro-
longation of QTc duration in men undergoing ADT is a direct consequence of testosterone
suppression. Studies have shown that testosterone shortens ventricular cardiomyocyte
repolarization time by two mechanisms: it increases potassium currents derived from the
human ether-a-go-go–related gene via the androgen receptor [47], and it inhibits the
depolarizing delayed calcium current via a nonandrogen receptor–mediated pathway [48].
Therefore, in men undergoing ADT, profound androgen deficiency favors ventricular
depolarization, as seen by a shortened QRS complex, and prolongation of QTc. In a
previous trial of testosterone replacement in community-dwelling older men [23], we had
observed a reduction in QTc and a trend toward prolongation of QRS complex duration;
this supports our current finding that withdrawal of testosterone during ADT leads to
prolongation of the QTc and shortening of the QRS complex. Previous cross-sectional
studies that have evaluated QRS complex duration in men and women have found that
men have longer QRS complex duration compared with women, which they attributed to
sex differences in cardiac size [49, 50]. Our observation of QTc prolongation because of
ADT confirms findings from a previous uncontrolled prospective study [25]. Unlike QTc
prolongation, which has consistently been associated with risk of cardiac arrhyth-
mias, the clinical implications of QRS complex shortening remain unclear and deserve
further investigation.

 Although suppressed serum testosterone levels are likely responsible for the alterations
seen in the cardiac conduction system, one cannot exclude a direct effect of GnRH agonists on
cardiac electrophysiology. Indeed, some previous reports have suggested that use of GnRH
agonists is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared with bilateral
orchiectomy, whereas other reports have not confirmed these findings [12, 13, 51, 52]. A
possible explanation for these discrepant observations might be the small number of men who
underwent bilateral orchiectomy in these compared with those receiving GnRH agonists.
However, GnRH receptors are expressed in the cardiac tissue [53, 54], and stimulation of
GnRH receptors by GnRH agonists in vitro has shown an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and
prolongation of intracellular Ca2+ decay in mouse cardiomyocytes [55]. Mechanistic studies
are needed to further understand the drug effect of both GnRH agonists and antagonists on
cardiac conduction.
Serum electrolytes sodium, potassium, and calcium, in particular, have an effect on cardiac
conduction [30]. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia can result in QTc prolongation, whereas
hypercalcemia leads to shortening of QTc duration [56]. We measured these electrolytes at the
same time intervals (and on the same day) that the ECG was performed to exclude any
potential effect on ECG parameters. We found no meaningful changes in these electrolytes,
suggesting that QTc prolongation is likely related to profound androgen deficiency as a result
of ADT.
The current study has several strengths: (1) the study had a prospective design that
allowed us to carefully follow changes in ECG parameters; (2) all ECGs were performed by
the same technician using the same equipment; (3) enrollment of eugonadal men provided
an opportunity to determine the direct effect of testosterone suppression on cardiac elec-
trophysiology; (4) serum testosterone was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (the gold-standard method); (5) none of the participants had history of
cardiac arrhythmias or bundle branch block, allowing us to accurately measure QTc; (6) all
men received medical ADT with GnRH agonists, and no one underwent orchiectomy, thus
providing a homogenous sample; (7) enrollment of a non-ADT group as controls who were
well matched with the ADT group; and (8) QTc was calculated using the Fridericia QT
correction formula, which is known to provide the best prediction of short- and long-term
mortality [32]. The present work also has some limitations. This work was a secondary
analysis of the ADT and Pain Study. Furthermore, we only enrolled men undergoing ADT
with GnRH agonists (this was by design to have a homogenous sample of participants);
future mechanistic studies should evaluate the various modalities of ADT (GnRH agonists,
GnRH antagonists, and orchiectomy) on ECG parameters.
In conclusion, ADT with GnRH agonists results in considerable prolongation in QTc in men
with PCa. These changes in cardiac electrophysiology might explain cardiovascular events,
including sudden cardiac death, that are seen soon after initiation of ADT. These findings
should guide both physicians and patients to make informed decisions regarding
their treatment.
