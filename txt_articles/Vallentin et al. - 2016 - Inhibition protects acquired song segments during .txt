 have many inherent inaccuracies, this approach
to understanding global photophysiology of phyto-
plankton should not be abandoned. We suggest
that relating the space-based estimates to in situ
measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence life-
times will provide a pathway to understanding
photobiological energy utilization and dissipa-
tion processes on a global scale. For example,
the maximal average photochemical energy con-
version efficiency (fp) at night in the global ocean,
obtained simultaneously with our lifetime mea-
surements, is 0.35 ± 0.11 (fig. S2). Given an av-
erage nighttime lifetime of 1.13 ns (Fig. 2), we
deduce that thermal energy dissipation accounts
for ~60% of the photosynthetically active quanta
absorbed by phytoplankton globally. In contrast,
under optimal growth conditions in the labora-
tory, an average phytoplankton cell uses ~65% of
the absorbed quanta for photochemistry and
dissipates <35% as heat. The fact that thermal
dissipation of absorbed quanta by phytoplank-
ton in the upper ocean is so high strongly implies
that a large fraction of cells have impaired or
nonfunctional PSII reaction centers and/or un-
coupled photosynthetic antennae. We conclude
that, although photochemical energy conversion
to biomass in the oceans accounts for half of the
global carbon fixed per annum, the overall en-
ergy conversion efficiency is relatively low and is
limited by nutrient supply.

Inhibition protects acquired song
segments during vocal learning in
zebra finches
Daniela Vallentin,1,2* Georg Kosche,1,2* Dina Lipkind,3 Michael A. Long1,2†
Vocal imitation involves incorporating instructive auditory information into relevant
motor circuits through processes that are poorly understood. In zebra finches, we found
that exposure to a tutor’s song drives spiking activity within premotor neurons in the
juvenile, whereas inhibition suppresses such responses upon learning in adulthood. We
measured inhibitory currents evoked by the tutor song throughout development while
simultaneously quantifying each bird’s learning trajectory. Surprisingly, we found that the
maturation of synaptic inhibition onto premotor neurons is correlated with learning but
not age. We used synthetic tutoring to demonstrate that inhibition is selective for specific
song elements that have already been learned and not those still in refinement. Our results
suggest that structured inhibition plays a crucial role during song acquisition, enabling a
piece-by-piece mastery of complex tasks.
H
umans (1) and several other animal spe-
cies (2–4) learn motor sequences by imita-
tion. In the observer, a sensory percept
must inform relevant motor circuits in-
volved in the generation of the target
behavior, but little is known about the neural
mechanisms underlying this process. We address
this issue in the male zebra finch, which acquires
its courtship song by listening to (movie S1) (5) and
imitating (6–9) a tutor. The forebrain nucleus HVC
acts as an important sensorimotor interface be-
cause it receives direct connections from higher-
order auditory centers (10–12) and generates com-
mands essential for song production (13–15).
In the juvenile zebra finch, tutor song exposure
influences structural plasticity within HVC (16), a
process that is thought to be crucial for song
imitation (17). The tutor song has also been shown
to drive network activity within HVC (18), but the
responses of individual HVC premotor neurons
during observational learning had not yet been
explored.
We performed intracellular recordings in iden-
tified HVC neurons projecting to the robust nu-
cleus of the arcopallium (RA) of 10 awake juvenile
zebra finches during exposure to their tutor song.
In 13 out of 29 of these HVC premotor neurons,
tutor song playback caused spiking activity
(Fig. 1, A to C). In those neurons, the timing of
the evoked spikes was often highly precise across
trials (see supplementary materials), demonstrat-
ing that exposure to the tutor song is sufficient to
drive patterned spiking activity within HVC and
may serve an instructive role for the developing
HVC premotor circuit. We also observed reliably
timed tutor-evoked spiking in RA (18 neurons in

 three birds) (fig. S1) that was presumably driven
by HVC. In contrast, tutor song playback did not
evoke a suprathreshold response in HVC pre-
motor neurons of awake adult zebra finches (Fig.
1D, 0 of 24 cells in seven birds) and had only a
minimal impact on subthreshold activity in those
neurons (Fig. 1, D to F).
To directly investigate sensory-evoked synap-
tic events in HVC premotor neurons in awake
zebra finches, we used in vivo whole-cell voltage
clamp recordings (fig. S2). Using a fluorescent
retrograde tracer injected into RA, we targeted
HVC premotor neurons with two-photon micros-
copy guidance. In both juveniles (25 cells in 7 birds)
and adults (15 cells in 5 birds), excitatory events
could be evoked by the tutor song (fig. S3); this
suggests that the observed lack of spiking in
the adult bird is not explained by a decrease in
the strength of sensory afferents from auditory
projections to HVC. Our results seemed incon-
sistent with previous findings in which HVC pro-
jection neuron spiking could be reliably driven by
song playback in urethane-anesthetized adult
zebra finches (19). Because urethane has been
shown to act as an antagonist for GABAergic
transmission (20), we reasoned that synaptic in-
hibition might suppress tutor song–evoked exci-
tation in HVC of awake adult zebra finches. To
test that hypothesis, we locally infused a GABAA
antagonist (gabazine) and recorded HVC pre-
motor neurons during tutor song exposure in
adults (Fig. 1G). Once local inhibition was at-
tenuated, HVC premotor neurons exhibited tutor
song–evoked patterned spiking responses (Fig. 1,
G to I) similar to that seen in juvenile zebra
finches (Fig. 1, A to C). This finding indicates that
inhibition can effectively silence sensory inputs
onto HVC premotor neurons in the adult zebra
finch.
Local circuit interneurons are likely to be the
sole source of inhibition in HVC (21), and they
exhibit song selective auditory responses in the
awake adult zebra finch (22, 23). Thus, the lack of
a tutor song response in HVC premotor neurons
in adulthood may be due to a stronger recruit-
ment of the inhibitory network. To address this
idea, we performed juxtacellular recordings of
HVC interneurons during tutor song presenta-
tion in both juvenile (34 cells in 10 birds) and
adult (15 cells in 4 birds) zebra finches (Fig. 2, A
to D). Across all ages tested, interneurons in-
creased their spiking activity to tutor song play-
back relative to a silent baseline period (fig. S4),
and we observed that the tutor song could evoke
precise spiking activity in some cases (Fig. 2B).
When considering all data across both juvenile
and adult zebra finches, however, we noticed no
consistent age-related difference in the regularity
of interneuron firing across trials (Fig. 2C). Be-
cause the song learning process has been shown
to be highly variable across individuals (6) (fig.
S5), we reexamined our database on the similar-
ity of recent song recordings from each bird to
the tutor song. We found that interneuron firing
precision in response to the tutor song tended to
correlate with the extent of acoustic similarity to
that song (Fig. 2D).
Because HVC interneurons densely intercon-
nect with HVC premotor neurons (24, 25), they
are well poised to directly inhibit HVC premotor
neurons during tutor song presentation. Using
two-photon targeted voltage-clamp recordings in
awake birds, we found that inhibitory currents
onto HVC premotor neurons were often reliably
evoked by tutor song playback (Fig. 2, E to H, and
fig. S6). Consistent with our results concerning
HVC interneuron firing, we found no evidence
for an age-related change in the regularity or
strength of tutor song–evoked inhibition onto
HVC premotor neurons (fig. S7). Additionally,
we found no age-related change in the amplitude
or frequency of spontaneous inhibitory events
(fig. S8) and a developmental decrease in the
amount of current needed to hold premotor
neurons at 0 mV, which could reflect a down-
regulation of tonic inhibition. However, in both
juvenile and adult zebra finches, we found that
the inhibitory charge, event frequency and ampli-
tude, and regularity of inhibition across trials
were significantly correlated with song imitation
accuracy (Fig. 2, E to L, and fig. S6). These results
demonstratethatthematurationofsensory-evoked
inhibition in HVC matches the bird’s learning
progress rather than its developmental stage.
What function might this inhibition serve? We
hypothesized that precisely timed inhibition in
HVC could selectively target portions of the song
that have been adequately learned, thereby sup-
pressing the effect of sensory inputs on premotor
neurons during those times and preventing fur-
ther plasticity in motor output. We tested two
predictions stemming from this idea. One predic-
tion is that all premotor neurons should receive
the inhibitory signal synchronously, which would
allow for robust suppression of sensory inputs on
the entire premotor system. A second prediction
is that the global inhibitory signal should vary in
strength as a function of how well each segment
of the song has been learned, with stronger in-
hibition associated with better-learned segments.
To test the first prediction, we considered 11 cases

 in which multiple HVC premotor neurons (mean:
3.5 ± 1.3 neurons per bird) were recorded in the
same bird (Fig. 3A). We found that tutor song–
evoked inhibition was often highly correlated
across neurons (Fig. 3B), and this effect was
monotonically related to the degree of learning
(Fig. 3D). The excitatory current profiles, how-
ever, seemed to be unique for each neuron (Fig.
3C) and did not significantly change with song
learning (Fig. 3E). Our results are consistent with
a global entrainment of a motor circuit by an in-
hibitory network whose coherent song respon-
siveness may effectively suppress certain segments
of the tutor song in a learning-dependent manner.
Zebra finches often learn individual song ele-
ments in series, focusing on specific passages at
certain times (7). To test the second prediction of
our model—that local inhibition in HVC is ac-
curately targeting the syllables of the tutor song
that the zebra finch had learned—we used a pre-
viously established method for controlling the
learning process of individual song syllables
(7, 26). Zebra finches were first trained using a
synthetic tutor that produced four concatenated
copies of a single syllable “A” (Fig. 4A). Once the
song “AAAA” was learned, the tutoring paradigm
was altered to introduce an additional syllable

 “B.” Juvenile finches can eventually copy the new
song “ABAB” (Fig. 4A), which leads to two dis-
tinct learning phases: an early learning phase in
which “A” is performed well and “B” is performed
poorly (Fig. 4, B and C), followed by a later
learning phase in which both “A” and “B” are
performed well (Fig. 4, D and E). We could ex-
ploit this artificially induced learning trajectory
to address whether inhibition can be specifically
directed toward portions of the song that have
already been learned. In the early learning phase,
when juveniles could perform syllable “A” well
and not “B,” interneuron firing (Fig. 4F) as well
as inhibitory currents onto HVC premotor neu-
rons (Fig. 4G) preferentially targeted the learned
syllable (Fig. 4, H and I). Zebra finches at the
later learning stage, which produced a good copy
of both “A” and “B,” showed equivalent inter-
neuron firing and synaptic inhibition across both
syllable types (Fig. 4, J to M). In contrast, exci-
tatory currents did not change their relative tim-
ing across learning conditions (fig. S9).
Our results show that the activity of a motor
circuit can be directly driven by sensory afferents
during song learning. Specifically, exposure to
the tutor song can elicit precise spiking in HVC
premotor neurons of the juvenile bird (fig. S10A).
This result is reminiscent of the “mirroring” pre-
viously observed in mammalian motor systems
(27) as well as in other songbird species (28) in
which motor neurons respond to actions that are
observed in others, but the temporal similarity
between the tutor song–evoked firing patterns
and singing-related activity in individual HVC neu-
rons of the juvenile remains unknown.
A previous experiment (17) demonstrated the
necessity of tutor song–dependent HVC dynam-
ics during vocal learning. In that study, juvenile
zebra finches were unable to imitate the tutor
when HVC activity was optogenetically scrambled
during the presentation of the tutor song. These
results are consistent with the idea that precise
sensory-driven activity may have a pivotal role in
establishing song-related premotor sequences.
We demonstrated a loss of auditory respon-
siveness in HVC of the adult bird, but we were
able to use GABA antagonists to unmask tutor
song–evoked spiking, thereby highlighting the
role of inhibition in the suppression of these
responses. Auditory-evoked responses were sup-
pressed in all adults, even those that poorly
copied the tutor song, indicating that the phasic
inhibitory currents that are central to this study
are not the only factor mediating this phenom-
enon. We did not find an age-related increase
in tonic inhibition, which could have explained
these results. Future studies could investigate the
role of other developmentally regulated factors,
such as intrinsic neuronal properties or chloride
reversal potential, that could contribute to the
further suppression of sensory inputs during
development.
We also found that inhibition during song
learning can precisely target specific portions of
the song that have already been mastered (fig.
S10B). As a result, certain components of the
HVC sequence representing unlearned aspects
of the song may be left “exposed” to the influence
of the incoming auditory stream. These neurons
may then fire in a patterned way in response to
the tutor song until an appropriate behavior is
established. After the song has been learned com-
pletely, inhibition can shield HVC premotor neu-
rons from the impact of the tutor song (fig. S10C).
We do not yet understand the mechanisms that
compare the current song performance to the
tutor song and then transform this information
into a change in inhibition throughout learning.
This process is likely to be primarily mediated
through an increase in the regularity of inhib-
itory neuron firing across trials, which is driven
from inputs from higher-order auditory centers
(10–12).
In sensory systems, inhibitory network matu-
ration can result in the closure of critical periods
(29). However, this procedure is strongly depen-
dent on the developmental stage of the animal,

 whereas the inhibitory network changes observed
in HVC are correlated not with age but with song
performance (fig. S10C). Additionally, because the
extent of tutor imitation is variable across birds
and even within the span of a single bird’s song,
the maturation of HVC inhibition proceeds in a
self-directed, nonuniform manner. This stands in
stark contrast to sensory systems, where inhibi-
tory maturation primarily relies on external fac-
tors such as visual experience (30–32). Despite
these differences, our findings offer the opportu-
nity to potentially enable latent afferent streams
to engage with motor circuits through the manipu-

Muscle contraction depends on release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
and reuptake by the Ca2+adenosine triphosphatase SERCA. We discovered a putative
muscle-specific long noncoding RNA that encodes a peptide of 34 amino acids and that
we named dwarf open reading frame (DWORF). DWORF localizes to the SR membrane,
where it enhances SERCA activity by displacing the SERCA inhibitors, phospholamban,
sarcolipin, and myoregulin. In mice, overexpression of DWORF in cardiomyocytes increases
peak Ca2+ transient amplitude and SR Ca2+ load while reducing the time constant of
cytosolic Ca2+ decay during each cycle of contraction-relaxation. Conversely, slow skeletal
muscle lacking DWORF exhibits delayed Ca2+ clearance and relaxation and reduced SERCA
activity. DWORF is the only endogenous peptide known to activate the SERCA pump by
physical interaction and provides a means for enhancing muscle contractility.
I
ntracellular Ca2+ cycling is vitally important
to the function of striated muscles and is al-
tered in many muscle diseases. Upon electrical
stimulation of the myocyte plasma membrane,
Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic retic-
ulum (SR) and binds to the contractile apparatus
triggering muscle contraction (1). Relaxation oc-
curs as Ca2+ is pumped back into the SR by the
sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine tri-
phosphatase (SERCA). SERCA activity is inhibited
by the small transmembrane peptides phospho-
lamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), and myoregulin
(MLN; also known as MRLN) in vertebrates and
by sarcolamban A and B (sclA and sclB) in in-
vertebrates, which diminish sarcoplasmic retic-
ulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake and myocyte contractility
(2–7).
Recently, we discovered the small open read-
ing frame (ORF) of MLN within a transcript an-
notated as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) (4).
We hypothesized that a subset of transcripts cur-
rently annotated as lncRNAs may encode small
proteins that have evaded annotation efforts, a
notion supported by recent proteomic analyses
(8–10). To identify potential peptides, we searched
presumably noncoding RNA transcripts for hy-
pothetical ORFs using PhyloCSF; this method
uses codon substitution frequencies (11). From
these transcripts, we discovered a previously unrec-
ognized ORF of 34 codons within a muscle-specific
transcript, which we call dwarf open reading
frame (Dworf) (fig. S1). The Dworf RNA tran-
script is annotated as NONCODE lncRNA gene
