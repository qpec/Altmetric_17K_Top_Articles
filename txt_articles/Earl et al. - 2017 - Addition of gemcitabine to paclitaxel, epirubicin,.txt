ABSTRACT 
Background: tAnGo, an international phase III trial, was designed to evaluate the potential 
role of gemcitabine when added to anthracycline and taxane-containing adjuvant 
chemotherapy for early breast cancer (EBC). At the time the study was developed 
gemcitabine had shown significant activity in metastatic breast cancer, and there was 
evidence of a favourable interaction with paclitaxel. 
Methods: tAnGo was a superiority trial and aimed to detect 5% differences in 5-year DFS 
rates with EC-GT (4 cycles of epirubicin 90mg/m2 IV and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 IV 
day1 every (q) 3 weeks, followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel 175mg/m2 /3hour infusion day1 
and gemcitabine 1250mg/m2 IV days1 and 8 q3 weeks) when compared with EC-T, in 
women with invasive EBC, with a definite indication for adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-
free survival (DFS) was the primary endpoint and overall survival (OS) a secondary endpoint. 
Stratification was by country, age, radiotherapy intent, nodal status, oestrogen (ER) and 
HER2 status. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2004-002927-41), ISRCTN (51146252), 
and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00039546). 
Results: Between August 2001 and November 2004, 3152 patients were randomised from 
the UK and Ireland, by 127 centres; 1576 to EC-GT, and 1576 to EC-T. Patient 
characteristics were balanced across treatment groups: 77% node positive, 55% <50 years 
old, 62% of tumours grade 3, 63% >2cm, 44% ER negative, 50% PgR negative, 13% HER2 
positive. This protocol-specified final analysis has a median follow-up of 10 years (IQR 10-
10 years) and recorded 1087 DFS events and 914 deaths. No statistically significant 
difference between treatments was observed in DFS (adjusted HR=0·97 (95%CI 0·86-1·10) 
p=0·64) or OS (adjusted HR=1·02 (95%CI 0·89-1·16) p=0·81). No benefit for EC-GT was 
found in any of the protocol-determined subgroups. Toxicity, dose intensity and the detailed 
safety sub-study showed both regimens to be safe, deliverable and tolerable.

Conclusions: The addition of gemcitabine to anthracycline and taxane-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy at this dose and schedule confers no therapeutic advantage in terms of DFS 
and OS in early breast cancer. 
 
Key Words: tAnGo, early breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy, EC-T, gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION 
Despite the therapeutic advances of the last three decades, the development of more 
effective adjuvant therapy remains a priority for improving the treatment of women with early 
breast cancer The modest impact of traditional adjuvant polychemotherapy (mainly 
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluoruracil [CMF]) had been confirmed as a 24% global 
reduction in the risk of relapse or death (hazard ratio (HR)=0·76) and a 15% reduction in the 
risk of death (HR=0·85) in the meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ 
Collaborative Group1. The incorporation of anthracyclines provided additional benefits, with 
an estimated HR for relapse or death of 0·88 compared with CMF1, and a HR  0·7 in 
individual trials with higher dose epirubicin-based adjuvant regimens2,3,4. Following the 
routine inclusion of anthracyclines into standard adjuvant treatment, both the CALGB 93445 
and NSABP B286 trials showed that the sequential addition of four cycles of paclitaxel to 
standard therapy with four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide further reduced the 
risk of recurrence. CALGB 9344 reported that the risk of relapse or death was reduced by 
17% (HR=0·83 (95%CI 0·73-0·94), p=0·0013) and the risk of death by 18% (HR=0·82, (0·71-
0·95), p=0·0061)5 The NSABP B28 trial confirmed a HR=0·83 (0·73-0·95), p=0·008) for 
relapse or death and a non-significant improvement in overall survival. A meta-analysis of 
polychemotherapy conducted by the EBCTCG confirmed the benefits of the addition of 
taxanes to anthracycline-based polychemotherapy regimens7.  
 
Based on pre-clinical evidence of a potentially favourable interaction between paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine, and the favourable results of a pivotal randomised phase III trial comparing 
paclitaxel and gemcitabine in combination against single agent paclitaxel in patients who had 
anthracycline pre-treated metastatic disease, it seemed plausible that the addition of 
gemcitabine to paclitaxel in the anthracycline / cyclophosphamide (AC-T) regimen might 
  
Page 7 
further improve DFS and OS in early stage disease. The tAnGo trial was designed to 
evaluate the addition of gemcitabine to a sequential epirubicin and cyclophosphamide 
followed by paclitaxel regimen. The only other adjuvant trial in breast cancer testing the 
addition of gemcitabine to standard chemotherapy was NSABP-B388, a three arm trial with 
gemcitabine added to doxorubicin /cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel (AC-TG). 
 
The tAnGo trial was one of the first breast cancer trials to have a ‘companion’ neoadjuvant 
study (Neo-tAnGo) which reported in 20149. Both the endpoint of pathological complete 
response (pCR) from the Neo-tAnGo trial, which directly tests the chemo-sensitivity of the 
combination on the primary tumour, and the long term outcomes of DFS and OS from the 
tAnGo trial reported in this manuscript, are now available. 
 
A preliminary safety analysis without outcome data on the first 135 patients reported in 2008, 
demonstrated that both regimens were well tolerated, with only temporary changes in 
pulmonary function and transaminitis10. The preliminary results of tAnGo were presented as 
a conference abstract in 2008 at a median of 3 years follow-up11, and showed no benefit 
from the addition of gemcitabine (DFS HR=1·0 (95%CI 0·8-1·2), p=0·96, OS HR=1·1 (95%CI 
0·9-1·4), p=0·35). The present manuscript provides the only definitive and final analysis of 
the trial, All tAnGo patients were randomised more than 10 years ago, and we report here 
the long-term results for DFS and OS at a median follow-up of 10 years (IQR 10-10 years) 
alongside the 5- and 10-year detailed safety study findings.

METHODS 
Study design and participants 
The tAnGo phase III randomised trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the addition 
of gemcitabine to the second phase of a standard regimen of epirubicin and 
cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (EC-GT) improves disease-free survival (DFS) in 
comparison to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel alone (EC-T) in 
women with early stage breast cancer with a definite indication for adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 
We enrolled women aged 18 years or older with completely excised invasive early breast 
cancer of any nodal or hormone receptor status. Patients were enrolled where according to 
risk, a definite indication for adjuvant chemotherapy existed. This included ER negative 
(defined as Allred score 0-2); ER weakly positive (Allred score 3-5); and grade 3 tumours, 
and in these categories this was regardless of nodal status. Patients with ER strongly positive 
(Allred Score 6-8) or grade I or II tumours were usually included only if positive axillary lymph 
nodes were present. Women were enrolled at 127 sites in the UK and 2 in Ireland. Other 
eligibility criteria included adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function, adequate (0-
1) ECOG performance status, no previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, no 
previous or concomitant cancer, the ability to commence chemotherapy within 8 weeks of 
surgery, and written informed consent. 
 
At the start of the trial, eligibility criteria stated that tumours must be either ER-negative 
(defined as Allred score 0-2) or weakly positive (Allred score 3-5) and, in the case of weakly 
ER-positive tumours, these must be either PgR-negative or weakly positive (Allred score 3-
5). In 2003, after 550 patients had been recruited, the protocol was amended and these initial 
criteria were relaxed to include patients with any hormone receptor status, given the 
  
Page 9 
evidence that was accruing during the trial recruitment phase, for taxane activity irrespective 
of hormone receptor status. Full eligibility can be found in the trial protocol. 
 
The tAnGo trial was an investigator designed and led trial, approved by the MHRA on 06-
Sep-2000, the West Midlands Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee on 11-Dec-2000 and 
by all Local Research Ethics Committees and Research and Development Departments at 
participating hospitals. The trial was centrally coordinated by the Cancer Research UK 
Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham with regional coordination being provided by 
the Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, the ISD Cancer Clinical Trials Team, 
Partner in CaCTUS in Edinburgh and Cancer Trials Ireland (formerly the All Ireland 
Cooperative Oncology Research Group - ICORG), Dublin, Ireland. Statistical support was 
provided by Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick. 
 
Randomisation and masking 
The open-label tAnGo trial used a central computerised deterministic minimisation procedure 
to randomise patients (1:1) between EC-GT and EC-T treatment regimens (Figure 1). 
Treatment allocation was made by telephone to one of the three regional trials offices 
(Birmingham, Leeds or Edinburgh). Stratification was by country (England, Scotland, Wales, 
Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland), age (<=50, >50 years old), radiotherapy intent 
(planned, not planned), nodal status (negative, 1-3 nodes positive, 4+ nodes positive), ER 
status (negative, weakly positive, strongly positive) and HER2 status (3+, other [0, 1+, 2+], 
unknown).  
 
 
  
Page 10 
 
Procedures 
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival and secondary endpoints were overall 
survival, toxicity, delivered dose-intensity, tolerability and serious adverse events. We 
assessed adverse events for each chemotherapy cycle according to Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v2.0 grade. 
 
If neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred after a cycle of chemotherapy, the next cycle was 
delayed until the absolute neutrophil count was at least 1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L. Following a 
delay, either dose reduction of all drugs to 80%, or GCSF support with 100% dose were 
allowed, and all remaining cycles of the same four-cycle block were given at those doses. 
For persistent thrombocytopenia, the next cycle was delayed until patients had at least 100 
× 10⁹ platelets per L and was reduced to 80%, maintaining this dose reduction for 
subsequent cycles. Primary prophylaxis with GCSF was not provided with either epirubicin 
and cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel (with or without gemcitabine). Once started, prophylactic 
GCSF was usually continued into the second phase of chemotherapy at the discretion of the 
responsible physician. Day 8 FBC values had no impact on treatment decisions. 
 
If grade 2 neuropathy occurred during treatment with paclitaxel, remaining doses were 
reduced to 135 mg/m² (gemcitabine was unchanged). If grade 3 neuropathy occurred, either 
gemcitabine continued alone or trial chemotherapy was discontinued. 
 
Gemcitabine was dose-reduced to 80% in the event of grade 3 hepatic toxicity (transaminitis; 
aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥5–20 × upper limit of normal 
[ULN]) on day of treatment at clinician’s discretion, because transaminitis is not known to 
  
Page 11 
affect gemcitabine clearance. We were unable to substantiate earlier concerns about 
gemcitabine’s potential for clinically significant hepatic impairment. In the event of 
gemcitabine-related pulmonary toxicity of CTCAE grade 2 or worse, the patient was 
discontinued from study therapy. 
 
Cardiac toxicity was not anticipated at the cumulative epirubicin dose of 360 mg/m² but if 
congestive cardiac failure developed, patients were investigated and treated as appropriate, 
epirubicin was discontinued, and other chemotherapy was given at the discretion of the 
treating clinician. 
 
For allergic reactions to paclitaxel, the infusion was stopped if mild symptoms of skin rash, 
flushing, and localised pruritus occurred (Grade 1 and 2). Intravenous steroids and 
antihistamines were given and immediate slow re-challenge of chemotherapy was used on 
recovery. Paclitaxel infusion was stopped if moderate symptoms of generalised pruritus or 
rash, mild dyspnoea, or mild hypotension occurred and intravenous steroids and 
antihistamines were given (Grade 3). 48 h of steroids were then advised before cautious 
paclitaxel re-challenge. If severe symptoms occurred, including bronchospasm, generalised 
urticaria, angio-oedema, hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg), or life-
threatening anaphylaxis (Grade 4), paclitaxel infusion was stopped and treatment was given 
with intravenous steroids, and intravenous antihistamines and if necessary intramuscular 
epinephrine 1 mL 1:1000; re-challenge was not recommended. 
 
Radiotherapy was given according to local protocols, with radiotherapy intent employed as 
a stratification factor (planned at randomisation, not planned at randomisation). Any 
endocrine treatment was to be stopped prior to commencing chemotherapy, and 
  
Page 12 
recommenced as appropriate afterwards according to local protocols. The tAnGo trial was 
completed before adjuvant trastuzumab was used routinely and therefore the protocol did 
not include guidelines for adjuvant trastuzumab in HER2 positive patients. Patients could be 
recruited into the HERA Trial12. Clinical surveillance was continued for 10 years at the clinical 
centres.  
 
Pathology, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescent in situ Hybridisation (FISH) 
To investigate standard prognostic markers and treatment interactions, routine pathology 
tissue blocks from surgery were retrieved for 2462 of the 3141 eligible patients (78%) and 
were reviewed centrally in Cambridge (EP) for breast cancer morphology, tumour grade, 
histotype and scoring of ER, PR and HER2 on immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissue 
microarrays (TMAs) were constructed with a single 0·6mm core from a representative part 
of the tumour (172 sample arrayed in each TMA block) and sections stained for ER, PR and 
HER2 by IHC, with additional FISH for those in the HER2, 2+ category. When central testing 
was not available (22%), results from the local report were included for the biomarker 
analysis. 
 
Detailed Safety Sub-study 
Cardiac, pulmonary and hepatic function were initially monitored at four time points 
(randomisation, mid-chemotherapy, post-chemotherapy and 6-months post-chemotherapy) 
and showed the treatment regimens as equally well tolerated, only causing mild to moderate 
reduction in pulmonary function, which recovered completely by 6 months, and gemcitabine 
causing increased levels of liver transaminases but no adverse clinical events10. For the 
evaluation of long-term toxicity, these assessments were also undertaken at 5 and 10 years 
post-treatment. 
  
Page 13 
Statistical Analysis 
The original sample size calculations for tAnGo assumed a 5-year DFS of 45-55% from 
patients randomised onto the control arm of the trial, given that all patients were to be ER 
negative. Using this, 3000 patients were deemed necessary to detect (with 5% two-sided 
significance,) differences in survival rates in excess of 5% with 80% power. This would also 
allow detection of differences in excess of 7% with 85% power and in excess of 10% with 
99% power. 
 
When the eligibility criteria for tAnGo were changed in September 2003, to include lower risk 
patients who were ER positive and PgR either positive or unknown, 550 patients had already 
been randomized. The effect on the expected 5-year DFS of the control arm of the trial was 
assessed, along with the most up-to-date 5-year DFS estimates for early stage breast cancer 
based on the recent CALGB 9344 and NEAT results. Following discussions with the trial 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), it was determined that the 5-year DFS 
estimate for control arm patients was approximately 70% and that the power of the study to 
detect in excess of 5% differences with 5% two-sided significance had in fact increased from 
80% to 85%. tAnGo thus continued to aim for the 3000 patient target. 
 
Disease-Free (DFS) and Overall survival (OS) 
The primary outcome measure of DFS was calculated from date of randomisation to date of 
first relapse (loco-regional or distant, not including DCIS); to date of death in women dying 
without relapse; or to date of censor in women alive and relapse-free. The secondary 
outcome of overall survival was calculated from date of randomisation to date of death, or 
date of censor if alive.  Survival curves were constructed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
Log-rank tests assessed differences in patient and tumour characteristics, and 
  
Page 14 
treatment.  Cox-proportional hazards modelling investigated and adjusted for prognostic 
factors.  Hazard ratios of treatment effects on the risk of relapse and death were calculated 
for prognostic subgroups and displayed as forest plots. Secondary outcome measures were 
adverse effects and dose intensity. A sensitivity analysis, of breast cancer-specific survival 
censoring deaths not due to breast cancer to the patient’s date of death, was also planned. 
 
Adverse Events 
The maximum Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grades for a list of common toxicities 
reported for all patients during their chemotherapy was examined. 
 
Dose Intensity 
The methods for dose intensity calculations have previously been described13. We compared 
course delivered dose intensities (CDDI) across treatment groups with Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests and chi-squared tests with continuity corrections. 
 
Pre-planned, protocol-stated primary endpoint analyses 
Using Pocock’s method of assigning equal weighting to the alpha spend, with significance 
determined by p=0·02214, three event driven, primary endpoint analyses were planned: the 
first at 18 months minimum follow-up (min FU, 280 events expected) allowing detection of 
differences in excess of 10% with 95% power; the second at 30 months min FU  (550 events 
expected) allowing detection of differences in excess of 7% with 95% power; the third at 60 
months min FU (920 events expected) allowing detection of differences in excess of 5% with 
90% power. 
 
  
Page 15 
In June 2006, the tAnGo DSMC scrutinised the first pre-planned primary endpoint analysis 
and considered it too early to release the results. In November 2007, the second pre-planned 
analysis showed the conditional power15 was 7%, below the 10-15% level pre-set by the 
DSMC thus making it very likely that the final results would be consistent with the current 
results. The DSMC therefore recommended the trial data be released and they were 
presented at ASCO 200811. Results of the third and final pre-planned primary endpoint 
analysis (minimum 60 months FU, 920 events expected) are presented here. 
 
Statistical analysis was undertaken by Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, using SAS statistical 
software (version 9·4). All reported p-values are two-sided. All patients who were protocol 
violators were analysed within their randomised groups thus allowing analysis to be 
undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. tAnGo is registered with ISRCTN (51146252), 
EudraCT (2004-002927-41), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00039546). 
 
Role of the funding source 
The trial was endorsed by Cancer Research UK and supported by CRUK Clinical Trials Unit 
core infrastructure and a grant from Breast Cancer Relief. In addition unrestricted 
educational grants were provided by Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Pfizer Limited and 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited. Gemcitabine (GemzarTM) and Paclitaxel 
(TaxolTM) were provided free of charge by Eli Lilly and Company Limited and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited respectively. Neither the sponsors of the study nor the 
pharmaceutical companies had any role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data 
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (HE and LH) had full 
access to all of the data and (with CJP) had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.

RESULTS 
Patients  
tAnGo recruited 3152 patients from 175 clinicians at 127 centres in the UK and Ireland 
between August 2001 and November 2004. Eleven patients were ineligible for the trial (6 
EC-GT, 5 EC-T), principally for pre-existing metastases found after randomisation, leaving 
3141 eligible patients for analysis (Figure 1). Patient characteristics, type of operation, timing 
of surgery (Table 1) and tumour characteristics (Supplementary Table 1) for the 3141 eligible 
patients (1570 EC-GT, 1571 EC-T) appear balanced between the two treatment groups. 
 
Treatment Compliance 
Protocol violations in treatment allocation were noted by the trial management committee in 
19 patients (7 EC-GT, 12 EC-T) (Figure 1). All analyses included these patients in their 
original randomised treatment group, according to the intention-to-treat principle. 
 
Use of other first-line treatments 
Of the 287 pts known to be HER2 positive, 118 (41%) were reported, at some point on their 
FU forms, to have received trastuzumab (54 EC-GT pts (40% of 135), 64 EC-T pts (42% of 
152)), of which 60/287 (21%) received trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment and 58/287 (20%) 
for relapsed disease. At baseline, radiotherapy was planned to be administered in 90% of 
patients (2823/3141; 90% (1412/1570) of EC-GT patients, 90% (1141/1571) of EC-T 
patients). Radiotherapy administration is unknown in 15 patients. In the remaining 3126 
patients, 2754 (88%) are recorded as having received radiotherapy treatment. Rates are 
equal across treatment arms (1378 (88%) EC-GT patients and 1376 (88%) EC-T patients 
receiving radiotherapy, p=0.99).

Disease-Free and Overall Survival 
At the data lock on 29th September 2016, 914 patients had died (29% of the 3141 eligible 
patients; 459/1570 (29%) EC-GT patients; 455/1571 (29%) EC-T patients: Figure 1). Breast 
cancer was listed most frequently as the main cause of death (792/914 (87%), Table 2), but 
for the 122 patients for whom breast cancer was not listed as the main cause of death, 40/122 
(33%) had already had a breast cancer relapse. Therefore 82 patients (9% of 914) died 
without evidence of recurrent breast cancer. The median follow-up for the 2227 pts recorded 
as being alive was 10 years (IQR 10-10 years), with 96% having more than 8 years follow-
up. Loco-regional and/or distant relapse was recorded in 995 (32%) women (31% EC-GT, 
32% EC-T), with distant metastases being predominantly in the bone, liver and/or lung. There 
were 1087 (35% of 3141) events in the analysis of DFS. 213 patients (7%) had second 
primaries recorded. 
 
There was no significant difference between treatment groups in terms of DFS (log-rank 
p=0·63, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0·97 (95%CI 0·86-1·10), adjusted p=0·64, Figure 2a). 
DFS rates at 2, 5 and 10-years were similar for EC-GT and EC-T patients (2-year 88% vs 
87%; 5-year 75% vs 74%; 10-year 65% vs 65% respectively). There were also no significant 
differences between treatment groups observed in OS (log-rank p=0·85, adjusted HR 1·02 
(95%CI 0·89-1·16), adjusted p=0·81, Figure 2b). OS rates at 2, 5 and 10-years were similar 
for EC-GT and EC-T patients (2-year 93% vs 94%; 5-year 82% vs 82%; 10-year 70% vs 
71% respectively). A sensitivity analysis of breast cancer-specific survival across treatment 
groups, analysing the 792 deaths due to breast cancer showed similar results (389 EC-GT, 
403 EC-T), log-rank p=0·66, adjusted HR 0·97 (95%CI 0·85-1·12), adjusted p=0·71). 
 
  
Page 18 
Univariate analysis showed that the following were significantly associated with worse DFS: 
higher nodal burden, negative ER/PR status, no radiotherapy planning, larger tumour size 
higher tumour grade, the presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion, use of breast-conserving 
surgery, (all p<0·0001), poorer ECOG performance status (p=0·004), positive HER2 status 
(p=0·0026), and triple negatives phenotype (p=0·01) (Table 3). Similar results were found 
for OS (Supplementary Table 2). 
 
Plots of hazards over time for DFS and OS highlighted the similarity of the two randomised 
treatment arms (Figure 3a and 3b). However, for the HER2 negative patients, we 
demonstrated the expected significant differences between the ER negative sub-group 
(TNBC) and the ER positive subgroup in hazards over time; TNBC patients showed 
increased hazards for relapse and death in the early years, with a plateau of risk between 5 
and 10 years, whilst ER positive patients showed persisting, albeit lower risks, for relapse 
and death at 10 years. In the smaller HER2 positive group ER negative and ER positive sub-
groups showed a similar pattern of changes with increased risk of relapse in the early years 
for both, although higher hazards for ER negative patients. Of note, only 21% of HER2 
positive patients received adjuvant trastuzumab. 
 
Interaction of Treatment Effect with Prognostic Factors 
Forest plots confirmed the lack of treatment effect on DFS in all subgroups of patients, 
specifically by age, ER, PR, nodal and HER2 status, performance status, surgery, tumour 
size, grade, and presence or absence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, triple negative status 
and ER/PGR negative status (Figure 4A-4C). Additionally no significant interactions with 
treatment effect were noted for these variables. Similar results were obtained for overall 
survival (Figure 4D-4F). A non-preplanned analysis was also carried out by four subgroups 
  
Page 19 
defined in the Neo-tAnGo manuscript9 using Grade 3 patients only and splitting by ER 
combined with HER2 status. These four subgroups showed significant heterogeneity in DFS 
(p=0·02) and borderline heterogeneity in OS (p=0·06), with a numerical trend for benefit from 
gemcitabine in the ER-/HER2+/G3 and ER-/HER2-/G3 subgroups (Figure 4C and 4F). 
 
Adverse Effects of Chemotherapy 
Information regarding adverse effects was available from 3132 patients with full sets of 
treatment forms returned (99·7% of the 3141 eligible patients). Frequencies of patients 
reporting grades 3 and 4 toxicities are as expected (Table 4). More EC-GT than EC-T 
patients are seen to report grade 3 neutropenia (21% vs 14%), grades 2 and 3 fatigue (55% 
vs 50% grade 2, 13% vs 9% grade 3), grade 3 infection (12% vs 8%) and grades 2 and 3 
vomiting (25% vs 21% grade 2, 9% vs 6% grade 3).  Grade 2 anaemia is also reported by 
more EC-GT patients (20% vs 8%). 
 
In total, 1158 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported (650 during EC, 136 during T 
and 372 during GT cycles), involving 816 patients (474 EC-GT patients, 342 EC-T patients). 
1121 (97%) of these were evaluated as serious adverse reactions (SARs), involving 794 
patients. There were 31 suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
recorded (20 by EC-GT patients, 11 by EC-T patients). 
 
Detailed Safety Sub-study – Long-term toxicity assessments 
There were 135 patients (69 EC-GT, 66 EC-T) included in the detailed safety sub-study. The 
assessment completion rate at 5-years post treatment was 75% (73 of the 97 patients alive; 
72% EC-GT (34 of the 47 alive) and 78% EC-T (39 of the 50 alive)). At 10-years, assessment 
completion rates were 74% (63 of the 85 patients alive; 78% EC-GT (31 of the 40 alive) and 
  
Page 20 
71% EC-T (32 of the 45 alive)). In total, 49 patients completed all 6 assessments (58% of 
the 85 alive at 10-years; 25 (63%) EC-GT, 24 (53%) EC-T). There were no long-term safety 
signals of significant concern (Supplementary Table 3). 
 
Early Deaths 
19 patients (0·5% of the 3141 eligible patients) died within 3 months of completing their last 
chemotherapy cycle (10 EC-GT, 9 EC-T). 14 of these patients (7 EC-GT, 7 EC-T) died with 
metastatic breast cancer more than 30 days after day 1 of their last chemotherapy cycle and 
this indicates that they were likely to have had metastatic disease at the time of 
randomisation. In addition, one EC-T patient died of a second primary lung cancer and one 
EC-GT patient by suicide. Chemotherapy possibly contributed to 3 deaths: one (EC-GT) with 
breast cancer on day 18, cycle 2 from venous thrombo-embolism (VTE); one (EC-T) died 
from VTE 41 days after day 1, cycle 3; and one (EC-GT) from ischaemic heart disease 28 
days after day 1 of cycle 2. 
 
Dose Intensity 
Complete information for dose intensity calculations was available on 3137 of the 3141 
eligible patients (99·9%). EC-GT patients received moderately lower course-delivered dose 
intensity (CDDI) than EC-T patients (median (IQR) 96% (88-99) vs 98% (93-100), p<0·0001). 
Additionally, fewer EC-GT patients received CDDI >85% (80% vs 89%, for EC-T patients, 
p<0·0001).

DISCUSSION 
The tAnGo trial showed no benefit in either DFS or OS from the addition of gemcitabine to 
standard paclitaxel-containing, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy 
in early breast cancer. We have the benefit of data from the tenth annual follow-up on 2121 
patients (95% of the 2227 known to be alive) and therefore the results for all stratified risk 
groups are robust and are not unduly biased by length of follow-up16. The tAnGo trial was an 
‘all-comers’ trial carried out before the standard use of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2 
positive disease. At the start of the trial, adjuvant chemotherapy in the UK included paclitaxel 
for high-risk disease in very few centres. With the intention of ensuring that the results of the 
trial would be  relevant in the future, we included paclitaxel in the standard arm, and at the 
start of the trial recruited only ER-negative and ER weakly positive patients, representing the 
highest risk population. In the second part of the trial the entry criteria were expanded to 
include moderate risk patients, because of emerging evidence at that point for more routine 
use of adjuvant taxanes5,6. 
 
It is difficult to explain why the overall results were negative for adjuvant gemcitabine when 
the drug had been so promising in the metastatic setting17, particularly given the ongoing 
positive results in metastatic TNBC18. Gemcitabine has recently been included in an 
international trial in metastatic TNBC with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel 19,20[HE1]. The first 
results of the Phase 2 feasibility study were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer 
Symposium in December 2016 [20], and showed no benefit from the addition of gemcitabine. 
In view of this the trial (tnAcity study) will not proceed to a randomised phase III study.  
However there have been positive results in other solid tumours most notably pancreatic 
cancer21. Perhaps the addition of a fourth drug to three effective drugs is simply not going to 
improve DFS and OS in early breast cancer. The companion neoadjuvant trial (Neo-tAnGo) 
  
Page 22 
also showed no increase in pathological complete response (pCR) rate with the addition of 
gemcitabine and no improvement in DFS and OS22. In addition, neither the neoadjuvant 
NSABP-B4022,23 trial examining both capecitabine and gemcitabine added to paclitaxel, nor 
the adjuvant NSABP-B388 using AC-TG as one of the experimental arms, showed any 
improvement in pCR or DFS and OS. 
 
Since gemcitabine, an anti-metabolite, is in the same class of drugs as capecitabine, recent 
data on that drug is of interest. The adjuvant TACT 2 trial demonstrated that capecitabine 
has some advantages over standard CMF following anthracycline-based treatment 
[submitted, January 2017], because of lower toxicity and better quality of life with no apparent 
loss of efficacy. However, when capecitabine was added to docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide in the FINNXX trial23, there was no improvement in DFS and when 
capecitabine was substituted for cyclophosphamide in the GEICAM/2003-10 Study there 
was an increase in DFS events24. Nevertheless, there has been a recent renewal of interest, 
with the use of capecitabine after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients who had not 
achieved a pCR in the CREATE-X study 25. The benefits of this adjuvant treatment, were 
significant and most marked in the TNBC group (296 patients: HR 0·58 [95% CI 0·39-0·87]). 
However, it is unlikely that gemcitabine could be used in this setting because of the 
significantly higher toxicity particularly myelosuppression. 
 
Are there potential subgroups in tAnGo in which increased benefit from adjuvant gemcitabine 
could be further explored? Two groups identified are the ER-negative/ grade3, HER2 positive 
or negative subsets (Figure 4c and 4f), which also showed a possible benefit for pCR in Neo-
tAnGo22. Recent preclinical research has reported compelling results of relevance to 
gemcitabine use in breast cancer26, showing that mutant p53 (mtp53) harbouring cells are 
  
Page 23 
highly sensitive to the cell killing effects of gemcitabine via inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase 
(dCK). In addition, dCK and/or p53 knockdown of these cells, abrogating the gain-of-function, 
conferred relative resistance to gemcitabine but not to cisplatin or doxorubicin. mtp53 status 
has been shown to be related to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients27 and was recently 
studied in GEPAR SIXTO28. mtp53 was present in 297/450 (66%) patients, more frequently 
in TNBC (184/246 [74·8%]) compared to HER2-positive cancers (113/204 [55·4%] 
p<0·0001). As part of the tAnGo and Neo-tAnGo studies we have collected 80% of FFPE 
tumour samples for translational research and plan to explore this preclinical data further. 
 
In summary, the tAnGo, Neo-tAnGo, NSABP-B38 and NSABP-B40 trials all demonstrate a 
lack of activity when gemcitabine is added to three potent neo/adjuvant breast cancer 
chemotherapy drugs. tAnGo was a large, rapidly recruiting trial with sufficient follow up to 
allow confidence in this result. Parallel translational science for tAnGo is ongoing, including 
tumour genomic analysis, pharmacogenetics29,30 and inherited predisposition analyses31. 
Clinical trials datasets, painstakingly collected and analysed, clearly need to be published 
fully including all negative studies. The publication of a ‘negative’ trial is as important for 
patients and the clinical research community as the positive trial results which lead to 
licensing approvals or change of practice that are generally perceived as more valuable. The 
rejection of gemcitabine from standard adjuvant breast cancer treatment for lack of benefit, 
can be seen as a cost-effective result in terms of both financial and patient toxicity costs.

CONCLUSION 
Gemcitabine in combination with paclitaxel after epirubicin and cyclophosphamide is not 
indicated in adjuvant breast cancer treatment with current biological characterisation. 
However, it seems likely that further improvements in the outcome of treatment for women 
with early breast cancer will depend on the development of targeted therapies, whose 
selective application is predicated on the biological heterogeneity of this disease.
