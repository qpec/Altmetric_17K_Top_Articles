Introduction
In 2015, drug overdoses accounted for 52,404 deaths in the 
United States, 63.1% of which involved an opioid (1). Among 
opioid-related deaths, approximately 15,000 (approximately 
half) involved a prescription opioid (2). In addition, an esti-
mated 2.0 million persons in the United States had opioid use 
disorder (addiction) associated with prescription opioids in 
2015 (3). The economic burden of prescription opioid over-
dose, abuse, and dependence is estimated to be $78.5 billion 
each year in the United States (4). Prescription opioid-related 
overdose deaths and admissions for treatment of opioid use 
disorder have increased in parallel with increases in opioids 
prescribed in the United States, which quadrupled from 1999 
to 2010 (5). This increase was primarily because of an increase 
in the use of opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain (6,7). 
Previously, opioids had primarily been reserved for severe acute 
pain, postsurgical pain, and end-of-life care. This change in 
prescribing practice increased the amount of opioids prescribed 
for three reasons. First, opioid use for chronic noncancer pain 
increased the number of opioid prescriptions. Second, the use 
of opioids to treat ongoing chronic conditions increased the 
average lengths of time for which opioids were prescribed (6,7). 
Third, average dosages of opioid prescriptions tend to be higher 
for patients who are prescribed opioids for long periods of time, 
effectively increasing the average amount of opioids supplied 
per prescription (6,7). Together, these changes placed more 
persons at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose (8–11).
Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking 
medical attention in the United States, and prescription opi-
oids are frequently prescribed to manage pain (12). However, 
opioids should only be used when benefits are expected to 
outweigh risks. Ensuring that patients have access to safe, 
effective treatment is critical and involves improving the way 
opioids are prescribed. To improve understanding of opioid 
prescribing trends in the United States before the release of

Abstract
Background: Prescription opioid–related overdose deaths increased sharply during 1999–2010 in the United States in 
parallel with increased opioid prescribing. CDC assessed changes in national-level and county-level opioid prescribing 
during 2006–2015.
Methods: CDC analyzed retail prescription data from QuintilesIMS to assess opioid prescribing in the United States 
from 2006 to 2015, including rates, amounts, dosages, and durations prescribed. CDC examined county-level prescribing 
patterns in 2010 and 2015.
Results: The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States peaked at 782 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) 
per capita in 2010 and then decreased to 640 MME per capita in 2015. Despite significant decreases, the amount of 
opioids prescribed in 2015 remained approximately three times as high as in 1999 and varied substantially across the 
country. County-level factors associated with higher amounts of prescribed opioids include a larger percentage of non-
Hispanic whites; a higher prevalence of diabetes and arthritis; micropolitan status (i.e., town/city; nonmetro); and higher 
unemployment and Medicaid enrollment.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Despite reductions in opioid prescribing in some parts of the 
country, the amount of opioids prescribed remains high relative to 1999 levels and varies substantially at the county-level. 
Given associations between opioid prescribing, opioid use disorder, and overdose rates, health care providers should carefully 
weigh the benefits and risks when prescribing opioids outside of end-of-life care, follow evidence-based guidelines, such 
as CDC’s Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, and consider nonopioid therapy for chronic pain treatment. 
State and local jurisdictions can use these findings combined with Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data to identify 
areas with prescribing patterns that place patients at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose and to target interventions 
with prescribers based on opioid prescribing guidelines.

(Guideline), CDC analyzed changes in national and county-
level opioid prescribing and characteristics associated with 
higher prescribing rates at the county-level (13).
Methods
Data on opioid prescribing come from the QuintilesIMS 
Transactional Data Warehouse, which provides estimates of 
the number of opioid prescriptions dispensed in the United 
States based on a sample of approximately 59,000 pharmacies, 
representing 88% of prescriptions in the United States.
Changes in opioid prescribing at the national level were 
analyzed from 2006 to 2015. Prescribing rates included overall 
opioid prescribing rates, high-dose prescribing rates, and pre-
scribing rates by days’ supply (≥30 days and <30 days). Annual 
opioid prescribing rates were calculated by dividing the number 
of opioid prescriptions by the U.S. Census population estimates 
each year. High-dose prescribing rates include prescriptions with 
daily dosage ≥90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (13). 
All rates are per 100 persons. Additional measures included 
MME per capita, average daily MME per prescription, and 
average days’ supply per prescription. Cold and cough products 
containing opioids and buprenorphine products indicated for 
conditions other than pain were excluded.
To determine where prescribing changes occurred, opioid 
prescribing at the county level was examined in 2010 (when 
prescribing levelled off nationally) and 2015. Quartiles were 
created using MME per capita to characterize the distribution 
of opioids prescribed. The percentage of counties experiencing 
changes in opioid prescribing measures from 2010 to 2015 was 
calculated. A change of ≥10% was considered to be an increase 
or decrease, whereas changes <10% were considered stable. 
County-level characteristics were examined in 2015 by MME 
per capita quartiles. County characteristics were obtained from 
the U.S. Census Bureau (age, urban/rural status); American 
Community Survey (race/ethnicity, percent uninsured, percent 
unemployed, income); U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System (dia-
betes prevalence); Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (provider 
supply); Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Medicaid 
and Medicare coverage); Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (arthritis prevalence); and the Area Health Resource 
File (percent disabled, suicide rate). To identify county-level 
factors associated with MME per capita in 2015, a stepwise 
multivariable linear regression model incorporating age, race/
ethnicity, insurance status, education, unemployment rates, 
poverty rates, median income, urban/rural status (metropolitan, 
micropolitan [i.e., town/city; nonmetro], and noncore [i.e., 
rural; nonmetro]), suicide rates, dentist and primary care phy-
sician density, and diabetes, arthritis, and disability prevalence 
was estimated.
Results
In the United States, annual opioid prescribing rates increased 
from 72.4 to 81.2 prescriptions per 100 persons from 2006 to 
2010, were constant from 2010 to 2012, and then decreased by 
13.1% to 70.6 per 100 persons from 2012 to 2015 (Figure 1). 
Annual high-dose opioid prescribing rates remained stable from 
2006 to 2010 and then declined by 41.4% from 11.4 per 100 
persons in 2010 to 6.7 in 2015. Annual prescribing rates for 
prescriptions of ≥30 days’ supply increased 58.9% from 17.6 per 
100 persons in 2006 to 28.0 per 100 persons in 2012 and leveled 
off from 2012 to 2015. Annual prescribing rates for prescrip-
tions of <30 days’ supply were stable from 2006 to 2012 and 
decreased 20.2% from 53.2 per 100 persons in 2012 to 42.4 in 
2015. Average daily MME per prescription remained stable from 
2006 to 2010 and then decreased 16.9% from 58.0 in 2010 to 
Key Points
• The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States 
peaked in 2010 and then decreased each year through 
2015. Despite reductions, the amount of opioids 
prescribed remains approximately three times as high 
as in 1999.
• Opioid prescribing varied substantially across the 
country, with average per capita amounts prescribed in 
the top-prescribing counties approximately six times 
the amounts prescribed in the lowest prescribing 
counties in 2015.
• Higher amounts of opioids were prescribed in counties 
with a larger percentage of non-Hispanic whites; a 
higher prevalence of diabetes and arthritis; micropolitan 
counties; and counties with higher rates of 
unemployment and Medicaid enrollment.
• The substantial variation in opioid prescribing observed 
at the county-level suggests inconsistent practice patterns 
and a lack of consensus about appropriate opioid use and 
demonstrates the need for better application of guidance 
and standards around opioid prescribing practices.
• Health care providers can follow the CDC’s Guideline 
for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, which 
provides evidence-based recommendations about 
opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating 
adult patients with chronic pain, outside of active 
cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.

48.1 in 2015. Average days’ supply prescribed increased 33.0% 
from 13.3 in 2006 to 17.7 in 2015.
From 2010 to 2015, the amount of opioids prescribed in 
the United States decreased from 782 to 640 MME per capita 
(data not shown). In 2010 and 2015, the amount of opioids 
prescribed across counties varied substantially (Figure 2). From 
2010 to 2015, among counties with sufficient data MME 
per capita decreased in 49.6% of counties, remained stable 
in 27.8% of counties, and increased in 22.6% of counties 
(Table 1). Overall prescribing rates decreased in nearly half 
(46.5%) of counties, whereas high-dose opioid prescribing 
rates and average daily MME per prescription decreased in 
the majority of counties, with 86.5% and 72.1% of counties, 
respectively, experiencing decreases. From 2010 to 2015, aver-
age number of days’ supply increased in 73.5% of counties.
Despite reductions in prescribing, the amount of opioids 
prescribed in 2015 remained high relative to 1999 levels and 
varied substantially across the country, from an average of 
203 MME per capita in the lowest quartile to 1,319 MME 
per capita in the highest quartile. Opioid prescribing amounts 
varied across several county-level characteristics (Table 2). 
After adjustment in the multivariable model, the following 
characteristics were associated with higher amounts of opioids 
prescribed: a larger percentage of non-Hispanic whites; higher 
rates of uninsured and Medicaid enrollment, lower educational 
attainment; higher rates of unemployment; micropolitan sta-
tus; more dentists and physicians per capita; a higher prevalence 
of diagnosed diabetes, arthritis, and disability; and higher 
suicide rates. Together, these factors explain approximately 
32% of the variation in the amount of opioids prescribed at 
the county-level.
Discussion
The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States began 
to decrease in 2011. However, in 2015, at 640 MME per capita, 
it remains approximately three times as high as in 1999, when

180 MME per capita were sold in the United States (5), and 
nearly four times as high as the amount distributed in Europe 
in 2015 (14).
Two prescribing changes appear to be associated with the 
decrease in MME prescribed per capita in the United States 
from 2010 to 2015. First, average daily MME per prescription 
decreased after 2010, both nationwide and in most counties. 
The largest decreases occurred from 2010 to 2012, following 
publication of two national guidelines defining high-dose 
opioid prescribing as >200 MME/day (15,16). It also coin-
cided with studies demonstrating progressively increasing 
overdose risk at prescribed opioid dosages exceeding 20, 50, 
and 100 MME per day (9–11) and publications highlighting 
associations of prescribed opioids with overdose deaths (5,17). 
Second, the rate of opioid prescribing decreased nationwide 
and in many counties. Nationally, opioid prescribing rates lev-
eled off from 2010 to 2012, and then decreased by 13.1% from 
2012 to 2015. These decreases might reflect growing awareness 
among clinicians and patients of the risks associated with opi-
oids. Throughout this period, however, the average duration of 
opioid prescriptions increased, in part because of the continued 
increase in longer opioid prescriptions (≥30 days) through 
2012, followed by a stabilization of the rate, and a substantial 
decrease in shorter prescriptions (<30 days) after 2012. This 
pattern, along with the trends in overall numbers of opioid 
prescriptions, might reflect fewer patients initiated on opioid 
therapy after 2012, whereas patients already receiving opioids 
were more likely to continue receiving them. Patients are at 
risk for continuing opioids long-term once they have received 
them for >5 days (18), and are unlikely to discontinue opioids 
after they have received them for 90 days (19), highlighting 
both the importance of minimizing unnecessary initial opi-
oid exposure and potential challenges in reducing opioid use 
among patients already receiving them.
From 2010 to 2015, half of counties in the United States 
experienced reductions in the amount of opioids prescribed, 
with substantial decreases in certain states. In 2011 and 2012, 
Ohio and Kentucky, respectively, mandated that clinicians 
review Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data 
and implemented pain clinic regulation (20). MME per capita

decreased in 85% of Ohio counties and 62% of Kentucky 
counties from 2010 to 2015. In Florida, where multiple 
interventions targeted excessive opioid prescribing from 2010 
through 2012, (e.g., pain clinic regulation and mandated 
PDMP reporting of dispensed prescriptions) (21), the amount 
of opioids prescribed per capita decreased in 80% of counties 
from 2010 to 2015. During this time, Florida also experienced 
reductions in prescription opioid-related overdose deaths (21).
Despite reductions, the amount of opioids prescribed in 
2015 remained high relative to 1999 levels and varied sub-
stantially across the country, with average per capita amounts 
prescribed in the top quartile of counties approximately six 
times the amounts prescribed in the lowest quartile. Larger 
amounts were prescribed in micropolitan counties and in 
counties with a higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and 
arthritis. The latter finding might represent treatment for 
pain associated with these or co-occurring painful conditions. 
However, there are effective nonopioid treatments for pain 
whose benefits outweigh the harms (13). Reasons for higher 
opioid use in micropolitan counties might include less access 
to quality health care and other treatments for pain, such as 
physical therapy. In addition, persons in rural areas might 
travel to micropolitan areas, which often serve as an anchor 
community for a much larger rural region, to receive medical 
care and pick up medications.
Despite reductions in opioid prescribing in recent years, 
opioid-involved overdose death rates continue to increase. 
However, these increases have been driven largely by use 
of illicit fentanyl and heroin (1). There is no evidence that 
policies designed to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing 
are leading to these increases. Combined implementation of 
mandated provider review of PDMP data and pain clinic laws 
reduced the amount of opioids prescribed, prescription opioid-
involved overdose deaths, and all opioid-involved deaths (20). 
The policies were also associated with reductions in heroin 
overdose deaths that were not statistically significant (20). By 
reducing the number of persons exposed to opioids and the 
subsequent risk of opioid use disorder these policies might 
reduce the number of persons initiating illicit opioid use in 
the longer term (20).

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, QuintilesIMS estimates of dispensed prescriptions 
have not been validated, and they do not include prescriptions 
dispensed directly by prescribers (although this likely represents 
a small minority of prescribed opioids), potentially biasing 
opioid prescribing downwards. Second, county-level analyses 
are aggregated by the county where an opioid is dispensed, and 
cannot account for prescriptions obtained by persons outside 
of the county. Third, the analysis does not include clinical 
outcomes. However, previous analyses have found associa-
tions between population-level amounts of opioids prescribed

and opioid overdose death rates (5), and between prescribed 
dosages and individual overdose risk (9–11). Finally, because 
data on the indications for which opioids were prescribed were 
not available, the appropriateness of opioid prescriptions, or 
whether opioids were prescribed for acute, chronic, or end-of-
life pain, could not be determined.
Although some variation in opioid prescribing is associated 
with characteristics such as the prevalence of possibly painful 
conditions (e.g., arthritis), differences in these characteristics 
explain only a fraction of the wide variation in opioid prescrib-
ing across the United States. This variation suggests inconsistent 
practice patterns and a lack of consensus about appropriate opioid 
use and demonstrates the need for better application of guidance 
and standards around opioid prescribing practices (13). CDC’s 
Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations about opi-
oid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients 
with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative 
care, and end-of-life care (13). The Guideline can help providers 
and patients weigh the benefits and risks for opioids according to 
best available evidence and individual patients’ needs and safely 
taper opioids if risks outweigh benefits. The Guideline recom-
mends the use of nonopioid therapies, such as acetaminophen, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, exercise therapy, 
and cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (13).
Given associations between opioid prescribing, opioid use 
disorder, and opioid overdose rates (5), states and local jurisdic-
tions can use these findings to target high-prescribing areas for 
interventions such as academic detailing for clinicians or individual 
educational visits to clinicians (22), and increased access to med-
ication-assisted treatment for patients with opioid use disorder. 
Innovative approaches such as virtual physical therapy sessions 
with pain coping skills training (23,24) can be used to improve 
access to effective treatment for chronic pain. In addition, states 
can consider policies that can reduce opioid overdose, including 
mandated PDMP use and pain clinic laws (20). Changes in opioid

that substantial changes are possible and that more are needed.
