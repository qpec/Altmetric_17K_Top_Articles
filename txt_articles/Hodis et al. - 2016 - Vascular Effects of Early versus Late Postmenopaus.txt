BACKGROUND
Data suggest that estrogen-containing hormone therapy is associated with beneficial 
effects with regard to cardiovascular disease when the therapy is initiated temporally 
close to menopause but not when it is initiated later. However, the hypothesis that the 
cardiovascular effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy vary with the timing of 
therapy initiation (the hormone-timing hypothesis) has not been tested.
METHODS
A total of 643 healthy postmenopausal women were stratified according to time since 
menopause (<6 years [early postmenopause] or ≥10 years [late postmenopause]) and were 
randomly assigned to receive either oral 17β-estradiol (1 mg per day, plus progesterone 
[45 mg] vaginal gel administered sequentially [i.e., once daily for 10 days of each 30-day 
cycle] for women with a uterus) or placebo (plus sequential placebo vaginal gel for women 
with a uterus). The primary outcome was the rate of change in carotid-artery intima–
media thickness (CIMT), which was measured every 6 months. Secondary outcomes 
included an assessment of coronary atherosclerosis by cardiac computed tomography 
(CT), which was performed when participants completed the randomly assigned regimen.
RESULTS
After a median of 5 years, the effect of estradiol, with or without progesterone, on CIMT 
progression differed between the early and late postmenopause strata (P 
= 
0.007 for the 
interaction). Among women who were less than 6 years past menopause at the time of 
randomization, the mean CIMT increased by 0.0078 mm per year in the placebo group 
versus 0.0044 mm per year in the estradiol group (P 
= 
0.008). Among women who were 
10 or more years past menopause at the time of randomization, the rates of CIMT pro-
gression in the placebo and estradiol groups were similar (0.0088 and 0.0100 mm per 
year, respectively; P 
= 
0.29). CT measures of coronary-artery calcium, total stenosis, and 
plaque did not differ significantly between the placebo group and the estradiol group in 
either postmenopause stratum.
CONCLUSIONS
Oral estradiol therapy was associated with less progression of subclinical atherosclerosis 
(measured as CIMT) than was placebo when therapy was initiated within 6 years after 
menopause but not when it was initiated 10 or more years after menopause. Estradiol 
had no significant effect on cardiac CT measures of atherosclerosis in either postmeno-
pause stratum. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
fter dozens of observational stud-
ies consistently showed inverse associa-
tions between postmenopausal hormone 
therapy and the risk of coronary heart disease 
and death from any cause, it was difficult to 
understand the null or adverse effects of the 
therapy on coronary heart disease that were re-
ported from randomized, controlled trials. One 
explanation is that in observational studies, 
women were younger (approximately 50 years of 
age) and closer to menopause (typically within 
2 years) when they initiated hormone therapy 
than were the women included in randomized 
trials (mean age in the 60s, typically >10 years 
past menopause). This so-called timing hypothe-
sis posits that the effects of hormone therapy on 
atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease de-
pend on the timing of the initiation of hormone 
therapy relative to menopause, age, or both,1-3 
which are in turn related to the health of the 
underlying vascular tissue or to other factors, 
such as reduction in or down-regulation of estro-
gen receptors.4,5 Two sister trials — the Estrogen 
in Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT), 
which showed a reduction of atherosclerosis pro-
gression in association with postmenopausal 
hormone therapy in women without coronary 
heart disease,4 and the Women’s Estrogen Lipid-
Lowering Hormone Atherosclerosis Regression 
Trial (WELL-HART), which showed no signifi-
cant effect of hormone therapy on atherosclero-
sis progression in women with established coro-
nary heart disease5 — provided early clinical 
trial support for the hormone-timing hypothesis: 
the results of the trials, with regard to the effect 
of hormone therapy on the progression of athero-
sclerosis, differed according to the health of the 
underlying vascular tissue. After completion of 
EPAT and WELL-HART, the Early versus Late 
Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) was 
proposed to the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) in early 2002.
The trial was specifically designed to test the 
hormone-timing hypothesis in relation to athero-
sclerosis progression in postmenopausal women. 
Since the initiation of the trial, the amount of 
data in support of the hormone-timing hypothe-
sis has grown considerably.1,6 Our primary hypoth-
esis was that postmenopausal hormone therapy 
would reduce the progression of subclinical ath-
erosclerosis when therapy was initiated soon after 
menopause (<6 years) but not when therapy was 
initiated a long time after menopause (≥10 years).
Methods
Study Design
ELITE was a single-center, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial in which serial 
carotid arterial measurements were obtained 
noninvasively. Participants were healthy post-
menopausal women without diabetes and without 
clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease who 
had had no regular menses for at least 6 months 
or who had surgically induced menopause, as well 
as a serum estradiol level lower than 25 pg per 
milliliter (92 pmol per liter). At the time of ran-
domization, participants were stratified accord-
ing to the number of years past menopause: less 
than 6 years or 10 or more years. The exclusion 
criteria are described in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
The trial was approved by the University of 
Southern California institutional review board. 
Participants provided written informed consent. 
An external data and safety monitoring board 
appointed by the National Institute on Aging 
monitored the safety of participants and trial 
conduct. The trial design, methods, and ratio-
nale have been published previously.6 The trial 
protocol is available at NEJM.org; the first two 
authors take responsibility for the accuracy and 
completeness of the reporting and for the fidel-
ity of the report to the study protocol.
Randomization and Treatment
Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 
ratio, to receive oral 17β-estradiol (1 mg daily) 
or matching placebo within strata of early post-
menopause (<6 years since menopause) and late 
postmenopause (≥10 years since menopause). 
Additional randomization stratification factors 
were baseline carotid-artery intima–media thick-
ness (CIMT) (<0.75 or ≥0.75 mm) and hysterec-
tomy status (yes or no). Women in the estradiol 
group who had a uterus also received micronized 
progesterone (45 mg) as a 4% vaginal gel, and 
women in the placebo group who had a uterus 
received matching placebo gel; the estradiol or 
placebo gel was to be applied sequentially (i.e., 
once daily for 10 days during each 30-day cycle). 
The participants, investigators, staff, imaging 
specialists, and data monitors were unaware of 
the treatment assignments.

Follow-up
Recruitment was initially based on a 5-year trial 
(3-year recruitment with 2 to 5 years of randomly 
assigned treatment or placebo). In the fifth year 
of follow-up, the trial was extended 2.5 years 
with supplemental funding from the NIH for 
collection of additional data, including results of 
cardiac computed tomography (CT) that was per-
formed when participants completed the course 
of randomly assigned treatment or placebo. Eval-
uations of participants (see the Supplementary 
Appendix) were scheduled monthly in a special-
ized research clinic for the first 6 months and 
then every other month until trial completion.
Assessment of Atherosclerosis Progression
The primary trial outcome was the rate of change 
in intima–media thickness of the far wall of the 
right distal common carotid artery, assessed by 
means of computer image processing of B-mode 
ultrasonograms that were obtained at two base-
line examinations (averaged to obtain the base-
line CIMT value) and every 6 months during 
trial follow-up.6 High-resolution B-mode ultra-
sonographic imaging and CIMT measurement 
were performed with the use of standardized 
procedures and with technology that was specifi-
cally developed in house for longitudinal mea-
surements of changes in atherosclerosis (patents 
granted in 2005, 2006, and 2011)4,6-9 (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). The coefficient of vari-
ation for baseline CIMT measurements was 0.69%.
Secondary Trial Outcomes
The secondary end points included measurement 
of cognition,10 as well as measurement of the 
degree of coronary atherosclerosis with the use of 
a 64-slice multidetector CT scanner for cardiac 
imaging (GE Healthcare). Coronary-artery calcium, 
defined as a plaque of at least three contiguous 
pixels (area, 1.02 mm2) with a density greater 
than 130 Hounsfield units was calculated from 
the noncontrast CT images with the use of stan-
dard methods.6,11,12 Coronary-artery stenosis and 
plaque quantification were assessed from axial 
cardiac CT contrast angiographic images, multi-
planar reconstructions, and curved maximum-
intensity projections to determine the degree of 
luminal narrowing in all assessable coronary 
segments at the end-diastolic frame or the frame 
with smallest amount of motion artifact6,11,12 (see 
the Supplementary Appendix). Clinical outcome 
data were collected in a uniform manner with 
the use of standard queries at each clinical visit, 
collection of medical records, and completion 
of standardized adverse and clinical event case-
report forms.
Statistical Analysis
The estradiol and placebo groups (the study 
groups) were compared within time-since-meno-
pause strata with respect to baseline demo-
graphic characteristics, medical history, risk fac-
tors, previous hormone therapy, estradiol levels, 
and CIMT with the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests 
for categorical variables. Clinical and laboratory 
variables during the trial were compared be-
tween the estradiol and placebo groups with the 
use of marginal models with generalized esti-
mating equations, with an identity-link function 
and exchangeable correlation structure. The tests 
of interest were the overall comparisons between 
the estradiol and placebo groups in the total 
sample; adjustments were made for multiple hy-
pothesis testing.13 Covariates included random-
ization stratification factors and baseline values 
of clinical and laboratory variables. We also tested 
for a differential treatment effect according to 
postmenopause stratum by adding an interaction 
term. Study-group effects with regard to clinical 
and laboratory variables measured during the 
trial were not separately tested within the post-
menopause strata. Exact methods were used for 
the evaluation of adverse events, which was per-
formed in all participants who underwent ran-
domization; event proportions were compared 
among the four groups (i.e., according to regi-
men [estradiol vs. placebo] and postmenopausal 
status [early vs. late]).
The primary outcome was the per-participant 
rate of change in intima–media thickness in the 
right distal common carotid artery far wall.4,6 
Mixed-effects models were used with study group 
and postmenopause stratum included as indica-
tor variables. Randomization-stratification vari-
ables were included as covariates. Random effects 
were specified for the participant-specific inter-
cept (baseline CIMT) and slope (CIMT change 
rate). The overall study-group difference in the 
mean rate of change in CIMT was tested with a

two-way interaction between study group and 
the number of years in the study. A two-way 
interaction term of time since menopause and 
years in the study was used to test whether the 
mean CIMT progression rates differed between 
the two postmenopause strata. The primary trial 
hypothesis that study-group effects on the rate 
of change in CIMT would differ according to the 
time since menopause was tested with a three-
way interaction term of time since menopause 
and study-group assignment according to years 
in the study. Time since menopause was the only 
prespecified analysis for effect modification. In 
a sensitivity analysis, CIMT follow-up data were 
imputed for the 47 participants for whom only 
the baseline CIMT measurement was available. 
Follow-up CIMT measurements were imputed at 
6-month visits up to 30 months, which was the 
median follow-up time among 83 participants 
who had some — but not complete — follow-up. 
For each participant, CIMT at each visit was 
imputed, with the mean equal to the partici-
pant’s baseline CIMT (i.e., no change in CIMT 
during follow-up) and variance equal to the 
model residual from the analysis of the complete 
CIMT data.
Using generalized linear models, we performed 
study-group comparisons among participants 
who underwent cardiac CT within 6 months af-
ter their final clinic visit and had at least 80% 
adherence to the study regimen, as assessed by 
means of a pill count (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). The cardiac CT angiographic mea-
sures were total stenosis score and total plaque 
score. The coronary-artery calcium measures 
included calcium score and the presence or ab-
sence of any coronary-artery calcium (a dichoto-
mous variable).
Sample size requirements were based on a 
projected mean difference between the estradiol 
group and the placebo group in the rate of 
change in CIMT of 0.0144 mm per year in the 
early-postmenopause stratum and 0.0021 mm per 
year in the late-postmenopause stratum and a 
standard deviation of CIMT change of 0.02 mm 
per year.4 To test this interaction at 80% power 
and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 while allow-
ing for 25% dropout, we estimated that a sample 
size of 126 in each of the four groups would be 
required (504 total participants). The sample 
size was subsequently increased to increase the 
power to detect interactions between study group 
and postmenopause stratum.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Of the 2166 women who were screened, 643 
underwent randomization. Within the early-post-
menopause stratum, 271 women underwent ran-
domization, of whom 134 were assigned to re-
ceive placebo, and 137 were assigned to receive 
estradiol; within the late-postmenopause stratum, 
372 women underwent randomization, of whom 
186 were assigned to receive placebo and 186 
were assigned to receive estradiol. A total of 248 
women (123 in the placebo group and 125 in the 
estradiol group) in the early-postmenopause 
stratum and 348 women (176 in the placebo 
group and 172 in the estradiol group) in the late-
postmenopause stratum had CIMT data included 
in the analysis of the primary trial end point 
(Fig. 1); 47 participants did not have CIMT data 
available for inclusion in the analysis because 
those women dropped out before undergoing 
follow-up ultrasonographic examinations.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics 
of the participants with CIMT follow-up data 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix pro-
vides these data for all participants who under-
went randomization). The median age at enroll-
ment was 55.4 years in the early-postmenopause 
stratum and 63.6 years in the late-postmeno-
pause stratum, and the median time since meno-
pause was 3.5 years in the early-postmenopause 
stratum and 14.3 years in the late-postmenopause 
stratum. The mean CIMT was 0.75 mm in the 
early-postmenopause stratum and 0.79 mm in the 
late-postmenopause stratum (Table 2). Although 
most baseline characteristics differed significantly 
between participants in the early postmenopause 
stratum and those in the late postmenopause 
stratum, they did not differ significantly be-
tween randomly assigned study groups within 
each postmenopause stratum, with the excep-
tion of age in the late-postmenopause stratum; 
estradiol-treated women were slightly older, on 
average, than the women who received placebo.
CIMT Progression Rates
After a median 5-year intervention, the effect of 
hormone therapy on CIMT progression differed 
between the early and late postmenopause strata 
(P 
= 
0.007 for the interaction) (Table 2). In the 
early-postmenopause stratum, the rate of CIMT 
progression was significantly lower in the estra-
diol group than in the placebo group (Fig. 2); the

Figure 1. Study Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up.
Other reasons for a lack of carotid-artery intima–media thickness (CIMT) follow-up were as follows: in the early-postmenopause stratum, 
estradiol group, 3 participants were too busy, and 1 did not want to take estradiol; in the early-postmenopause stratum, placebo group, 
3 participants moved away from the area, 1 was too busy, 1 was called for armed-services duty, 1 had a competing family issue, 1 was 
counseled by a physician to withdraw, and 1 did not want to take estradiol; in the late-postmenopause stratum, estradiol group, 2 par-
ticipants moved away from the area, 1 was too busy, 1 was no longer interested, 1 had a weight increase, and 1 had concern about blood 
clots; in the late-postmenopause stratum, placebo group, 1 participant moved away from the area, 2 were too busy, 1 was called for armed-
services duty, 1 had a competing family issue, and 1 received a diagnosis of breast cancer after undergoing baseline mammography. Other 
reasons for participants not being included in the coronary-artery calcium (CAC) and cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) 
analysis were as follows: in the early-postmenopause stratum, placebo group, 1 participant lost contact; in the late-postmenopause stratum, 
estradiol group, 1 participant was too busy; in the late-postmenopause stratum, placebo group, 1 participant had an incomplete exami-
nation and 2 participants lost contact.

Included in the table are the 596 participants who were included in the primary and secondary atherosclerosis outcome analyses. The early-
postmenopause stratum included women who were less than 6 years past menopause at the time of randomization; the late-postmeno-
pause stratum included women who were 10 or more years past menopause at the time of randomization. Comparisons between the study 
groups were conducted within postmenopause strata with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and a chi-square 
test for categorical variables. The differences between the study groups were not significant (P>0.05), with the exception of age in the late-
postmenopause stratum (P = 0.03). To convert the values for cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.02586. To convert the values

Early vs. Late Postmenopausal Treatment with Estradiol
absolute difference between the estradiol and 
placebo groups in the mean progression rate 
was −0.0034 mm per year (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], −0.0062 to −0.0008; P 
= 
0.008). In the 
late-postmenopause stratum, the rates of CIMT 
progression were similar in the estradiol and 
placebo groups (difference, 0.0012 mm per year; 
95% CI, −0.0009 to 0.0032; P 
= 
0.29). The results 
were similar in an analysis that was restricted to 
women who had at least 80% adherence to the 
intervention (Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In post hoc analyses, the results were 
similar in women who received estradiol alone 
and those who received estradiol in combination 
with progestogen (Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), as well as in women who used 
lipid-lowering or antihypertensive therapy and 
those who did not use such therapy (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, the 
results were similar when data were imputed for 
the 47 participants for whom CIMT data were 
missing (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The effect of hormone therapy on the absolute 
value of CIMT at 5 years also differed signifi-
cantly between the early and late postmeno-
pause strata (P 
= 
0.03 for the interaction) (Fig. 2).
Coronary Atherosclerosis
Cardiac CT was used to evaluate 167 women in 
the early-postmenopause stratum (79 in the pla-
cebo group and 88 in the estradiol group) and 
214 women in the late-postmenopause stratum 
(113 in the placebo group and 101 in the estra-
diol group) (Fig. 1). The majority of participants 
for whom CT measures were not available had 
completed follow-up before the addition of these 
outcomes to the trial (Fig. 1). The frequency of 
missing data was similar between the study 
groups and between the two postmenopause 
strata. Although the measures of coronary ath-
erosclerosis were significantly greater among 
women in the late-postmenopause stratum than 
among those in the early-postmenopause stra-
tum, the CT measures did not differ signifi-
cantly between the placebo and estradiol groups 
within either postmenopause stratum (Table 3). 
(The characteristics of the women for whom CT 
measures were available and of women for 
whom CT measures were not available are de-
scribed in the Supplementary Results section of 
the Supplementary Appendix.)
Adherence
In the early-postmenopause stratum, the median 
percentage adherence to the study regimen, as 
assessed by means of pill counting, was 98% 
(interquartile range, 93 to 100) in the placebo 
group and 98% (interquartile range, 96 to 100) 
in the estradiol group; the respective adherence 
rates in the late postmenopause stratum were

98% (interquartile range, 94 to 100) and 98% 
(interquartile range, 93 to 100). Estradiol levels 
in serum during the trial were at least 3 times as 
high among women who were assigned to active 
treatment as among women who received pla-
cebo (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Changes in Metabolic and Clinical Variables
During the trial, the mean levels of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly lower 
— and the mean levels of high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol and total triglyceride levels were 
significantly higher — in the estradiol group 
than in the placebo group. Body-mass index and 
blood pressure during the trial did not differ 
significantly between the study groups. The be-
tween-group differences in metabolic and clini-
cal variables were similar in the early and late-
postmenopause strata (Tables S6 and S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
Serious adverse events occurred in 45 women who 
were assigned to receive placebo and in 43 women 
who were assigned to receive estradiol (Table S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix). These included 
two deaths (one from pancreatic cancer [placebo 
group] and one from glioblastoma [estradiol 
group]). The other serious adverse events were 
breast cancer (8 women who received placebo 
and 10 women who received estradiol), myocar-
dial infarction (3 women and 1 woman, respec-
tively), and deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism (2 women and 3 women, respectively). 
The frequency of none of these clinical events 
differed significantly between the placebo and 
estradiol groups in either postmenopause stratum.
Discussion
In this randomized controlled trial, the effect 
that estradiol therapy, with or without progester-
one, had on CIMT progression was significantly 
modified by time since menopause (P 
= 
0.007 for 
the interaction). The rate of CIMT progression 
was significantly lower in the estradiol group 
than in the placebo group among women who 
were less than 6 years past menopause but not 
among women who were 10 or more years past 
menopause.
These results are consistent with results of 
other studies that have suggested that the effects 
of hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease 
may depend on the timing of therapy initiation 
relative to menopause.6 In large meta-analyses 
of randomized controlled trials, including the 
Women’s Health Initiative, a significantly lower 
risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 
0.68; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.96) and of death from 
any cause (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39 to 
0.95) was found with hormone therapy than 
with placebo among women who were younger 
than 60 years of age, less than 10 years past 
menopause, or both when they underwent ran-
domization; however, such differences between 
Figure 2. CIMT Progression According to Study Group and Postmenopause 
Stratum.
At 5 years, the mean absolute CIMT values were as follows: in the late-
postmenopause stratum, placebo group (83 participants), 0.838 mm (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.810 to 0.866), and in the estradiol group (72 par-
ticipants), 0.831 mm (95% CI, 0.805 to 0.857); in the early-postmenopause 
stratum, placebo group (65 participants), 0.789 mm (95% CI, 0.763 to 0.814), 
and in the estradiol group (75 participants), 0.770 mm (95% CI, 0.746 to 
0.793). The effect of hormone therapy on the absolute value of CIMT at 5 years 
differed significantly between the postmenopause strata (P = 0.03 for the 
interaction). In the early-postmenopause stratum, the mean 5-year CIMT 
was significantly lower in the estradiol group than in the placebo group 
(P = 0.04); in the late-postmenopause stratum, the mean 5-year CIMT did 
not differ significantly between the estradiol and placebo groups. Shown  
at the bottom of the figure for each time point are the numbers of partici-
pants for whom CIMT data were available, participants who had completed 
or discontinued participation in the study, and participants who were still 
in the study but did not have CIMT data available.

Early vs. Late Postmenopausal Treatment with Estradiol
hormone therapy and placebo were not found 
among women who were 60 years of age or older, 
10 or more years past menopause, or both.14-18 In 
the Women’s Health Initiative 13-year follow-up, 
the effects of therapy with conjugated estrogens 
alone on myocardial infarction (a secondary end 
point) were significantly modified by age (P 
= 
0.007 
for the interaction): in the group of women who 
were 50 to 59 years of age at randomization, the 
risk of myocardial infarction among those who 
received conjugated estrogens was 40% lower 
than the risk among those who received placebo; 
this effect was not seen among women who 
were 60 years of age or older at randomization.19 
The Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study, which 
involved a cohort of women who were, on aver-
age, 50 years of age and 7 months past meno-
pause when they were randomly assigned to 
receive estradiol alone or in combination with 
sequential norethisterone acetate, showed a sig-
nificantly lower risk of coronary heart disease at 
10 years and 16 years of follow-up among women 
who received treatment than among women who 
received no treatment; however this was a rela-
tively small trial.20
In contrast, in the Kronos Early Estrogen Pre-
vention Study (KEEPS), low-dose treatment with 
oral conjugated estrogens (0.45 mg per day) or 
patch estradiol (50 μg per day) with oral proges-
terone (200 mg for 12 days per month) among 
women at low baseline risk for cardiovascular 
disease had no significant effect on CIMT pro-
gression.21 The apparent dose–response effect of 
estradiol at the arterial wall level22-24 could ex-
plain the discrepancy between the KEEPS results 
and the results of our trial. Studies in nonhuman 
primates and other animal species have shown 
that estrogen therapy prevents atherosclerosis 
when therapy is initiated at the time of meno-
pause but not when it is initiated some time 
later.3,25,26

follow-up visit, who had adherence to the study regimen that was lower than 80%, or who had a CAC or CCTA scan more 
than 6 months after the final study visit were not included in the analysis. Generalized linear models were adjusted for 
randomization stratification factors (baseline CIMT and hysterectomy status) and final study visit.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
trial. Previous studies have suggested that the 
number or functional level of estrogen receptors 
and the health of the vasculature at the time of 
exposure to estrogen are important factors in 
determining whether the arterial wall responds 
positively to hormone therapy.4,5,27-29 Consistent 
with this supposition is our finding of an inverse 
association between baseline CIMT and plasma 
total estradiol level in the early but not the late 
postmenopause stratum in our cohort.6
In contrast to our CIMT findings, there were no 
significant differences in post-treatment coronary-
artery calcium and cardiac CT angiographic out-
comes between the estradiol and placebo groups 
in either postmenopause stratum with a mean 
6 years of follow up. These results differ from 
those in the Women’s Health Initiative study; at 
a mean of 7.4 years of follow-up, coronary-artery 
calcium scores were lower among women who 
were randomly assigned to receive conjugated 
estrogens than among those assigned to receive 
placebo.30 It is possible that the sample size and 
duration of follow-up in our trial were insuffi-
cient to allow detection of between-group differ-
ences in the coronary-artery outcomes. However, 
our findings are consistent with those of other 
randomized trials that have shown no signifi-
cant effects of hormone therapy on angiograph-
ically demonstrable coronary-artery lesions (estab-
lished lesions).5,31,32 Studies in animals have shown 
the effectiveness of hormone therapy in prevent-
ing arterial lesion formation but not in reversing 
established lesions.3,25 Baseline coronary-artery 
imaging was not available in our study, and thus 
we could not assess the effects of hormone 
therapy on the development of new coronary-
artery lesions.
Although the CIMT methods and the technol-
ogy used in our trial predict cardiovascular 
events and correlate with the progression of 
coronary-artery atherosclerosis, as determined by 
sequential quantitative coronary angiography33,34 
(see the Supplementary Appendix), CIMT is not 
the only predictor of cardiovascular events. Exog-
enous estrogen affects factors other than CIMT 
in a manner that may increase the risk of throm-
botic events; these factors include coagulation 
factors, fibrinolysis, and matrix metalloprotein-
ase, an enzyme involved in plaque rupture.35
Serious adverse events were uncommon in our 
trial, and their rates did not differ significantly 
between the estradiol and placebo groups. The 
Women’s Health Initiative, a larger trial that in-
volved participants whose mean age was 63 years 
and mean time beyond menopause was 13.4 years 
at enrollment, showed higher risks of breast can-
cer, cardiovascular disease, and venous thrombo-
embolism in association with daily continuous 
combined oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxy-
progesterone acetate therapy, whereas these risks 
were not reported in some other studies, includ-
ing a smaller trial with 10 years of hormone 
therapy and a total of 16 years of follow-up after 
initiation of hormone therapy in younger women 
who were much closer to menopause.20 The abso-
lute risks of these outcomes were low and were 
even lower among women who were 50 to 59 
years of age at randomization. Relative to pla-
cebo, treatment with oral conjugated estrogens 
alone was associated with a lower risk of breast 
cancer among women of all ages19,36; in the sub-
group of women who were 50 to 59 years of age 
at randomization, there was a protective effect 
of conjugated estrogens alone with regard to the 
incidence of coronary heart disease, myocardial 
infarction, and death from any cause, in contrast 
to a trend toward increased risks of these out-
comes among women who were 60 years of age 
or older at randomization.19,37
In conclusion, we found that the effects of 
estradiol (with or without progesterone) on the 
progression of atherosclerosis, assessed as CIMT, 
differed according to the time of initiation of 
therapy, with benefit noted when it was initiated 
in women who were less than 6 years past meno-
pause but not when it was initiated in women who 
were 10 or more years past menopause. How-
ever, we did not find an effect of timing of es-
tradiol treatment relative to menopause with re-
gard to CT measures of coronary atherosclerosis.
