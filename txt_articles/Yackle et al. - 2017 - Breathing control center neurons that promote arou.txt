Slow, controlled breathing has been used for centuries to promote mental calming, and it is
used clinically to suppress excessive arousal such as panic attacks. However, the
physiological and neural basis of the relationship between breathing and higher-order brain
activity is unknown. We found a neuronal subpopulation in the mouse preBötzinger
complex (preBötC), the primary breathing rhythm generator, which regulates the balance
between calm and arousal behaviors. Conditional, bilateral genetic ablation of the
~175 Cdh9/Dbx1 double-positive preBötC neurons in adult mice left breathing intact but
increased calm behaviors and decreased time in aroused states. These neurons project to,
synapse on, and positively regulate noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brain
center implicated in attention, arousal, and panic that projects throughout the brain.
A
lthough breathing is commonly viewed as
a simple autonomous function that sustains
life, it has long been known to influence
higher-orderbehaviorand thinking(1). Slow,
controlled breathing is used by practitioners
of pranayama yoga and other forms of medita-
tion to promote mental calming and contempla-
tive states, and it is used clinically to suppress
excessive arousal and stress such as certain types
of panic attacks (2, 3). Although the effect of breath-
ing on behavior and mental state could easily be
indirect, there could also be more direct connec-
tions and impact of the breathing center on higher-
order brain function (4), as demonstrated here.
The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) is a clus-
ter of several thousand neurons in the ventro-
lateral medulla of the murine brain that can
autonomously generate respiratory rhythms in
explanted brain slices (5, 6), and whose rhythmic
activity in vivo initiates breathing by recurrently
activating premotor and motor neurons of the
respiratory muscles (5). The preBötC is not a homo-
geneous population of neurons but is composed
of distinct, though intermingled, neuronal sub-
populations (5, 7), one of which is essential for
respiratory-rhythm generation (8, 9) and another
for sighing (10).
To systematically explore the molecular diver-
sity of breathing center neurons, we screened
expression patterns of over 19,000 genes in the
Euroexpress embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse
hindbrain database (11). Cadherin-9 (Cdh9) was
the gene most selectively expressed in preBötC
(Fig. 1A). We constructed a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) transgene with the mOrange
coding sequence inserted at the Cdh9 translation
start codon (Fig. 1B). Cell counts in early post-
natal brains detected 319 ± 130 (n = 6) Cdh9-
mOrange–expressing cells in preBötC (Fig. 1C).
These cells intermingled with neurons express-
ing canonical preBötC markers somatostatin (SST)
and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) (Fig. 1, D and
E, and fig. S1, A to E). Few expressed the markers
themselves:0outof43Cdh9-mOrange+cellsscored
were SST+, and 7 out of 179 Cdh9-mOrange+ (4%)
were NK1R+. All Cdh9-mOrange–expressing cells
coexpressed neuronal marker NEUN (n = 61
cells, Fig. 1F). These Cdh9-mOrange–expressing
neurons can be further divided into seven sub-
types based on differential expression of tran-
scription factors Pax2, Dach1, Lmo4, Evx1, and
Dbx1. We focused on the ~175 neurons in each
preBötC (fig. S1, F to J; ~350 neurons bilaterally)
that coexpress the Dbx1-lineage marker, the major
subpopulation (56%, 165 out of 292 scored Cdh9-
mOrange+ cells, were Dbx1-LacZ+) we call Cdh9/
Dbx1 neurons (Fig. 1, G to I).
We electrophysiologically recorded 26 mOrange-
positive neurons in 15 preBötC slice preparations
from Cdh9-mOrange;Dbx1-lacZ double-transgenic
postnatal day 0 to 5 (P0 to P5) mice, then post-
stained the neurons for b-galactosidase (LacZ) in
some preparations to identify recordings of Cdh9/
Dbx1 neurons (table S1). We definitively identi-
fied five Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons. One showed bursts
of action potentials just before or during each
preBötC inspiratory burst (Fig. 1J and fig. S2), like
most other Dbx1-lineage preBötC neurons (12).
Three other neurons were more broadly active
with bursts during some, but not all, preBötC in-
spiratory bursts (42, 41, and 88% of inspiratory
bursts; Fig. 1K and fig. S2), called an “inspiratory-
associated” activity pattern. The other neuron
showed sporadic activity with no apparent rela-
tionship to preBötC inspiratory bursts. Seven of
the 15 Cdh9-mOrange neurons whose Dbx1-lacZ
expression status was not determined also dis-
played inspiratory (four neurons) or inspiratory-
associated (two neurons) patterns (table S1).
We used intersectional genetics (Cdh9-LOSL-
DTR;Dbx1-cre) (Fig. 1, B, M, and N) to express
human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) only in
Dbx1-lineage cells that coexpress Cdh9, so that
Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons could be specifically ablated
by intraperitoneal injection of diphtheria toxin.
We expected there would be few, if any, cells be-
sides Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons that express
both genes (11, 13). We examined this in two ways.
First, we compared mOrange expression in Cdh9-
LOSL-DTR and Cdh9-LOSL-DTR;Dbx1-cre trans-
genic mice by immunostaining serial sections of
adult brains. The only regions where Dbx1-cre
reduced the number of mOrange-expressing cells
were preBötC and inferior colliculus (fig. S3). Co-
staining with other markers showed that loss of
mOrange in preBötC was specific and complete
for Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons and had little or no effect
on the six other (Dbx1-negative) Cdh9-positive
preBötC cell types (fig. S4). Second, immunostain-
ing of serial sections of Cdh9-LOSL-DTR;Dbx1-cre
adult brains detected DTR expression only in
Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons (Fig. 1M) and the
inferior colliculus (fig. S3). Intraperitoneal in-
jection of diphtheria toxin once a day for 3 days
eliminated the DTR-expressing cells (Fig. 1N).
We analyzed adult mice several days after
ablating Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons. We expected Cdh9/
Dbx1 neurons would be essential for breathing
and viability because Dbx1 neurons are essential
for breathing in vivo (8, 9) and ablating just 85
random Dbx1 neurons abolishes preBötC rhythms
in vitro (14). However, there was no overt effect on
viability (three of three scored mice alive >1 year
after ablation), breathing, or sensory and motor
behaviors. Plethysmography of freely movingadult
mice after ablation did not detect significant dif-
ferences in inspiratory time, expiratory time, or
tidal volume of standard (eupneic) breaths (figs.
S5A and S6). No differences were detected in
characteristics of four variant breath types (figs.
S5, B to E, and S6) or breaths during sleep or
under hypercapnic or hypoxic conditions (figs. S5,
F to H, and S6).
There was, however, a change in abundance of
different breath types, first noted in respiratory-
rate histograms: Cdh9/Dbx1 ablation shifted the
distribution toward slower breaths (low respira-
tory rate) (Fig. 2B). Inspection of plethysmograph
traces indicated that the shift was due to increased
slow breaths (eupneic and grooming) associated
with calm behaviors and reduction in rapid breaths
associated with sniffing and other active behaviors
(Fig. 2A and fig. S7).

 The change in breathing patterns after Cdh9/
Dbx1 neural ablation was accompanied by a
corresponding change in behavior. Ablation re-
duced exploration of a new environment (87 ±
9% versus 62 ± 20% time spent in active explo-
ration, pre- versus postablation; P = 0.02) and
increased time engaged in grooming threefold
(10 ± 7% versus 31 ± 16%; P = 0.02) and still-
sitting twofold (3 ± 4% versus 7 ± 7%; P = 0.07),
although the latter did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (Fig. 2C). There was an increase in both
number of calm episodes (Fig. 2D) and their du-
ration (Fig. 2E and movie S1). Because the breath-
ing pattern associated with each behavioral state
was not detectably altered by ablation (figs. S5
and S6), the observed change in respiratory-rate
distribution could be explained by the overall
change in behavior (fig. S8): a shift from active
toward calm behaviors. Electrocorticographic
(ECoG) monitoring showed an increase in slow-
wave (delta, 2 to 4 Hz) brain activity after ab-
lation (Fig. 2F) and a selective decline in time
spent in an active-brain state dominated by theta
activity (Fig. 2G) compared to that of littermate
controls (Fig. 2, H and I). These changes could be
temporarily reversed by illuminating the cham-
ber, providing a stimulus that apparently over-
rides the decrease in arousal caused by Cdh9/
Dbx1 ablation (fig. S9).
To confirm that the observed behavioral and
breathing changes were due to ablation of neu-
rons in the preBötC, we restricted DTR induction
and hence neural ablation to just Cdh9-expressing
preBötC neurons (fig. S10, A to C). The animals
displayed a diminution in active exploratory be-
haviors and breathing patterns and an increase
in calm behaviors and breathing patterns similar
to animals with Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons ablated using
our intersectional genetic strategy (compare fig.
S10, D and E, and Fig. 2).
The decrease in active behavior and increase
in ECoG delta waves observed after Cdh9/Dbx1
neuron ablation is reminiscent of changes follow-
ing silencing or ablation of the locus coeruleus
(LC), a noradrenergic nucleus in the pons im-
plicated in generalized arousal, stress, and sleep-
wake transitions (15). We thus microinjected two
retrograde tracers into the LC and found that
both labeled Cdh9-mOrange neurons in pre-
BötC (FluorGold: fig. S11, A to C; fluorescent
retrograde beads: data not shown). Most of the
labeled Cdh9-mOrange preBötC neurons (85%,
23 out of 27, n = 40 sections, 3 mice) were con-
tralateral to the injection site. The connection
is selective because most labeled preBötC neu-
rons expressed Cdh9-mOrange (72%, 13 out of
18, n = 10 sections, 4 mice), and no retrograde
labeling of Cdh9-mOrange neurons was observed
following tracer injection into regions surround-
ing the LC (n = 4 injections).

 We tested whether the observed connection
between the preBötC neurons and LC is direct
to the noradrenergic [dopamine b-hydroxylase
(Dbh)–expressing] neurons that dominate the LC
(15). Injection of Cre-dependent adeno-associated
virus (AAV) helper viruses (AAV-FLExloxP-TVA:
mCherry and AAV-FLExloxP-rabies glycoprotein),
which enables infection and monosynaptic spread
of an envA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted, and
GFP-expressing rabies virus (RVdG) (16), into the
LC of Dbh-cre;Cdh9-mOrange mice resulted in
specific infection of LC “starter” neurons by RVdG
(fig. S12) and selective retrograde transsynaptic
tracing (GFP-labeling) of Cdh9-mOrange neurons
in the preBötC (Fig. 3, A to D, and fig. S11, D to F).
We again observed a strong bias for labeling the
contralateral rather than ipsilateral preBötC (com-
pare Fig. 3, A to C, and fig. S11, D to F). Most of the
green fluorescent protein (GFP)–labeled neurons
in the contralateral preBötC (63%, 45 out of 72, n =
18 sections, 3 mice) expressed Cdh9-mOrange,
whereas few of the labeled ipsilateral preBötC
neurons expressed Cdh9-mOrange (7%, 7 out of 94,
n = 18 sections, 3 mice). Nearly all ipsilateral GFP-
expressing neurons were located outside the ca-
nonical preBötC region defined by SST expression,
so they are presumably not preBötC neurons (fig.
S13). Control experiments in mice without Dbh-
cre did not show double-positive preBötC neu-
rons (fig. S12).
We microinjected a retrogradely transported
cre-expressing virus, canine adenovirus type 2–Cre
(CAV-Cre), bilaterally into the LC of Cdh9-LOSL-
DTR mice to eliminate mOrange and express DTR
only in the Cdh9-expressing neurons that project to
LC (Fig. 3E). Before DT injection, animals breathed
and behaved normally, although there was an in-
crease in calm breathing relative to mock-ablated
controls, perhaps because of neural toxicity asso-
ciated with induced DTR expression (Fig. 3, H and
I). Four to 10 days after DT injection and ablation
of LC-projecting, Cdh9-expressing preBötC neu-
rons (Fig. 3, F and G), there was a change in breath-
ing (Fig. 3H) and decrease in active behaviors
(Fig. 3I) that mimicked those observed after abla-
tion of the Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons (compare
to Fig. 2, B and C).
We examined LC activity by c-FOS expression
(17) following Cdh9/Dbx1 neuron ablation. Under
standard housing conditions, Cdh9-LOSL-DTR;
Dbx1-cre littermate control mice with intact Cdh9/
Dbx1 neurons showed only occasional LC activity
(Fig. 4, A and D, and fig. S14). When animals were

 chamber) for 1 hour, c-FOS was induced in scat-
tered cells throughout the LC (Fig. 4, B and D, and
fig. S14). However, 4 days after Cdh9/Dbx1 neuron
ablation, only rare c-FOS–positive LC neurons
were detected before or after placement in the
chamber (Fig. 4, C and D, and fig. S14). The LC
of ablated animals remained responsive to the
extreme arousal stimulus of physical-restraint
stress (18) (Fig. 4, D to F, and fig. S13), indicating
that other LC inputs and functions were intact.
We have identified and characterized a new
neuronal subtype in the preBötC comprising ~175
of its ~3000 neurons. The Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons are
dispensable for respiratory-rhythm generation and
instead promote generalized behavioral arousal.
Ablation of these neurons left all major breathing
patterns and regulation intact but made the mice
preternaturally calm: Their activity and ECoG pro-
files shifted from active exploratory behavior and
brain wave patterns toward calm behaviors such as
still-sitting and grooming. Monosynaptic tracing
demonstrated that these neurons directly project
to and synapse on noradrenergic neurons in the
contralateral LC, which in turn project throughout
the brain and control generalized arousal and
sleep-wake transitions (15). Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC
neurons provide excitatory input to the LC and
appear to be the dominant activating input un-
der mild arousal conditions of placement in a
new chamber.
We propose that Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons
function as gateway neurons directly linking the
preBötC to the locus coeruleus, and through it
to the rest of the brain (Fig. 4G). This ascending
circuit allows the respiratory center to commu-
nicate directly with and control higher-order brain
structures associated with behavioral arousal. The
excitatory input to the LC is presumably provided
by the observed inspiratory-associated activity pat-
terns of Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons, which could provide
greater excitatory input with faster respiratory
rates and perhaps abnormal respiratory patterns
(Fig. 4H). This respiratory corollary signal would
thus serve to coordinate the animal’s state of
arousal with the breathing pattern, leaving the
animal calm and relaxed when breathing is slow
andregular, but promoting(ormaintaining)arousal
when breathing is rapid or disturbed. This circuit
and corollary signal would explain why preBötC
respiratory patterns have been observed in the
LC and other reticular activating structures (19–21).
The LC can increase respiratory rate (22), so there
may also be a positive feedback loop from the LC
ultimately back to Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons.
The Cdh9/Dbx1 circuit may have evolved as a
defense response, mobilizing the animal in the face
of rapid, irregular, or labored breathing. Indeed,
fast or erratic breathing in humans increases
alertness and can cause anxiety and even panic
(3), and likewise increased preBötC activity, hyper-
ventilation, and sighs appear to induce arousal
duringsleep(23–25).Conversely,slowandcontrolled

 pranayama yoga to induce relaxation, and re-
lated approaches have proven useful for anxiety
syndromes and other stress disorders (1, 2). If
the Cdh9/Dbx1 circuit is conserved in humans, it
could provide a therapeutic target for breathing-
related anxiety disorders and perhaps preven-
tion of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),
widely hypothesized to result from an inadequate
arousal response to asphyxiation during sleep (24).
Notably, panic attacks triggered by respiratory
symptoms are specifically responsive to clonidine,
an a2-adrenergic agonist that silences LC (26).
Although breathing is generally thought of as
an autonomic behavior, higher-order brain func-
tions can exert exquisite control over breathing.
Our results show, conversely, that the breathing
center has a direct and powerful influence on
higher-order brain function. It will thus be im-
portant to map the full range of behaviors and
functions the breathing center controls.

Fig. 4. Effect of Cdh9/Dbx1 neuron ablation on LC neuronal activity. (A to C, E, and F) c-FOS
immunostaining (arrowheads) in LC of adult wild-type mouse in normal environment [home cage, (A)] and of
control [wild-type, Cdh9-LOSL-DTR, or Dbx1-cre mice, (B) and (E)] and Cdh9/Dbx1-ablated mice [Cdh9-LOSL-
DTR;Dbx1-cre mice 2 days after DT injection, (C) and (F)] after 1 hour in new chamber [(B) and (C)] or in a
conical tube under physical restraint [(E) and (F)]. Scale bar, 50 mm. (D) Quantification of c-FOS+ neurons in
(A) to (C) and (E) and (F) (mean ± SD) per 25-mm section of LC: (A) 0.4 ± 0.8 neurons (n = 39 sections,
6 animals); (B) 13.8 ± 6.5 neurons (14 sections, 4 animals); (C) 0.1 ± 0.3 neurons (17 sections,6 animals); (E)
61.4 ± 31.4 neurons (5 sections, 3 animals); and (F) 63.8 ± 19.9 neurons (6 sections, 3 animals). c-FOS+/TH+
neurons, gray; c-FOS+/TH– neurons embedded within TH+, black; c-FOS+/TH– neurons directly
surrounding TH+ LC region, white. (G) Ascending neural circuit from preBötC. Cdh9/Dbx1 preBötC neurons
(red) provide monosynaptic excitatory input to noradrenergic LC neurons (red), which project throughout
brain to promote arousal and active behaviors. Also shown is the classical circuit from preBötC rhythm-
generating neurons (black) to premotorneurons in ventral respiratory group (VRG, black). (H) Model of preBötC
with Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons distinct from, but regulated by, rhythm-generating neurons.This provides an ascending
respiratory corollary signal to the LC and on to the rest of the brain, separate from classical descending motor
circuit. Hence, when breathing speeds up or is otherwise altered, Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons activate LC to induce or
maintain an aroused state. [Less direct circuits or downstream events from Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons could also
contribute to LC activation, and because LC also regulates sensory modalities (27
, 28), sensory alterations could
also contribute to LC-induced behaviors. In addition, a direct contribution of Cdh9/Dbx1 neurons to preBötC
breathing-rhythm generation cannot be excluded, because compensatory mechanisms may obscure them.]
