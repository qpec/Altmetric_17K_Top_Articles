ABSTRACT  
Background: The need for psychotherapy in primary health care is on the increase but 
individual-based treatment is costly. The main aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
was to compare the effect of mindfulness-based group therapy (MGT) with treatment as usual 
(TAU), mainly individual-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), on a broad range of 
psychiatric symptoms in primary care patients diagnosed with depressive, anxiety and/or 
stress and adjustment disorders. An additional aim was to compare the effect of MGT with 
TAU on mindful attention awareness.  
Methods: This 8-week RCT took place in 2012 at 16 primary care centres in southern 
Sweden. The study population included both men and women, aged 20–64 years (n = 215). A 
broad range of psychiatric symptoms were evaluated at baseline and at the 8-week follow-up 
using the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90).  Mindful attention awareness was also evaluated 
using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).  
Results: In both groups, the scores decreased significantly for all subscales and indexes in 
SCL-90, while the MAAS scores increased significantly. There were no significant 
differences in the change in psychiatric symptoms between the two groups. The mindfulness 
group had a somewhat larger change in  scores than the control group on the MAAS (p = 
0.06, non-significant).  
Conclusions: No significant differences between MGT and TAU, mainly individual-based 
CBT, were found in treatment effect. Both types of therapies could be used in primary care 
patients with depressive, anxiety and/or stress and adjustment disorders, where MGT has a 
potential to save limited resources.

INTRODUCTION 
Psychiatric disorders, such as depressive, anxiety and stress and adjustment disorders cause 
substantial mental suffering and may lead to recurrence of more severe episodes and even 
suicide (1), (2). These very common psychiatric disorders also place a large economic burden 
on society. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been acknowledged to be an effective 
way of treating, for example, depressive disorders (3, 4). In Sweden, CBT is used as one of 
the standard treatments for patients in primary health care but other types of therapies are also 
recommended, such as interpersonal therapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. Patients, who 
seek individual based psychotherapies may, however, have to wait for some time before 
seeing a therapist as the availability of such psychotherapeutic treatments is limited. A 
stronger focus on group therapy could help to save limited resources and increase access to 
psychotherapy.  
 
Mindfulness-based therapies might be suitable for group therapy sessions for patients with 
psychiatric disorders but such therapies need to be evaluated before they can be recommended 
in primary health care.  
Mindfulness-based therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), have been increasingly used during the past 
decade for a range of conditions (5-8). Patients can, after an introduction to the therapy, 
practice mindfulness on their own, sometimes using their smartphones (9). MBSR is based on 
uniform techniques and well-established instructions (10). MBCT is a hybrid of CBT and 
MBSR (5). A 2012 meta-analysis, based on 19 mindfulness and acceptance-based studies, 
showed an association with substantial reductions of depressive and anxiety symptoms (11). 
Another meta-analysis, published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2016 (12), revealed that MBCT 
appears effective as a treatment for relapse prevention for those with recurrent depression. A 
Canadian study (13) showed that recurrence rates in patients with depression, noted over 18- 
  
4 
months of follow-up, did not differ between those who received MBCT (28%) and those who 
received maintenance antidepressants (27%). 
 
A recent 24-month randomised controlled trial (14), PREVENT, involving 95 primary care 
practices and 424 patients in the UK, found that both MBCT and maintenance antidepressant 
treatment were associated with durable positive outcomes in terms of recurrence, residual 
depressive symptoms and quality of life. PREVENT is the largest study so far conducted in 
primary care. Our research group performed a large RCT in Sweden in 2011 on 16 primary 
health care centres (PHCC) involving 215 patients with depressive, anxiety or stress and 
adjustment disorders (15). In that RCT, we administered mindfulness-based group therapy 
(MGT) using a modified form of MBSR (16-18). The MGT was performed in a similar way 
in the group sessions as in individual sessions. As noted in our previous report, using the 
MADRS-S scale, the HADS-scale, and the PHQ-9 scale as our main outcomes, MGT was 
non-inferior to treatment as usual (mostly individual CBT) for patients with depressive, 
anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders. 
 
In the present study we used the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) (19) (20, 21)and several of 
its subscales and indexes as our main outcome in order to assess effects of MGT on a broad 
range of psychiatric symptoms and distress. The main aim of this 8-week RCT was to 
compare the effect of MGT with TAU on a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in primary 
health care patients with depressive, anxiety, and stress and adjustment disorders. An 
additional aim was to compare the effect of MGT with TAU on mindfulness attention 
awareness by using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). 
 
METHODS 
Sampling of primary health care centres  
  
5 
This RCT was conducted in the county of Scania, the most southern region in Sweden (15). 
At the time of the RCT, Scania had 150 primary health care centres (PHCCs) that served a 
population of 1.3 million people. A total of 24 PHCCs from all parts of the region were 
randomly selected in order to achieve an accurate geographic representation of the whole 
county. J.S., the first author of the present study, contacted all of the directors at the 24 
PHCCs via an email that provided details about the study. Sixteen of the contacted 24 PHCCs 
were interested in participating in the study. Patient enrolment commenced on 4 January 2012 
and ended on 22 March 2012. Newly diagnosed patients with depressive, anxiety and/or stress 
and adjustment disorders were eligible, in addition to individuals who already had a history of 
these disorders. If the patient agreed to take part, both the doctor and the patient signed the 
informed consent form that had detailed information about the RCT. The patients were 
assessed for any need of pharmacological treatment and were prescribed psychotropic drugs if 
deemed necessary at the medical consultation.  
Recruitment and training of mindfulness instructors  
We aimed to train two instructors per participating PHCC. Two of the 16 PHCCs were 
relatively small and located close to each other and were therefore given 
permission to work together. In total, 30 instructors (mainly psychologists and social 
counsellors but doctors, nurses and physiotherapists were also included) received the training 
programme at our department (Center for Primary Health Care Research, Malmö, Sweden). 
No previous meditative experience was required. The training was given during six days that 
were evenly spread between September 2011 and December 2011 and all sessions were led by 
Ola Schenström (O.S.) and L.M.J., the latter representing one of the authors of this study. 
O.S. was trained at the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society, 
founded by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts, USA. O.S. is a renowned 
expert in mindfulness education in Sweden and L.M.J. is a psychiatrist and licensed 
psychotherapist with long clinical experience of mindfulness therapy. A key part of the 
  
6 
training is the future instructors’ own mindfulness training. The future instructors were 
trained in how to guide individuals and groups in mindfulness training so that the individual 
may develop a greater awareness of thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations and be able to 
cope better with stress and difficulties in everyday life. All of the 30 participants that took 
part in the six-day program completed the course, passed the oral exam and subsequently 
became certified mindfulness instructors.  
 
Data from 27 of the 30 instructors’ own mindfulness practice (average minutes/day) showed 
that the mindfulness instructors, on average, practiced for 27 minutes/day (SD = 17, Median = 
23, Range = 6-68). We tested the effect of the average minutes/day the instructors spent on 
their own mindfulness practice on the patients’ outcomes (change from baseline) using a 
mixed model (to take into account the potential correlation between instructors within 
PHCCs). We chose two outcomes, MAAS (mindfulness attention awareness) and GSI (Global 
Severity Index), and found no significant associations between the instructors’ own personal 
practice and the patients’ outcomes in the mindfulness group (MAAS: β = 0.008; p = 0.47; 
and GSI: β = -0.04; p = 0.46).  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Criteria 1-4 (below) all needed to be fulfilled for inclusion in the study. The listed ICD-10 
codes in criterion 1 were based on clinical diagnoses, made by medical doctors. 
1. One or more of the following ICD-10 psychiatric diagnoses:  
F32.0 = Mild depressive episode, F32.1 = Moderate depressive episode, F32.9 = Depressive 
episode, unspecified, F33.0 = Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode mild, F33.1 = 
Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate, F41.0 = Panic disorder, F41.1 = 
Generalised anxiety disorder, F41.2 = Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, F41.3 = Other 
mixed anxiety disorders, F41.8 = Other specified anxiety disorders, F41.9 = Anxiety disorder, 
  
7 
unspecified, F43.2 = Adjustment disorders, F43.8 = Other reactions to severe stress, and 
F43.9 = Reaction to severe stress, unspecified 
2. Age 20-64 years, i.e. the population of working age 
3. Ability to speak and read Swedish 
4. One or more (i.e. at least one) of the following cut-offs: a) a score between 13 and 34 on 
the MADRS-S scale; b) a score ≥7 on the HADS-A scale; c) a score ≥7 on the HADS-D 
scale: and d) a score ≥10 on the PHQ-9 scale (15)The exclusion criteria were the following 
seven: severe psychiatric symptoms requiring psychiatric care, risk of suicide, inability to 
participate at group sessions due to severe substance abuse, pregnancy, current psychotherapy 
of any kind, participation in any other psychiatric intervention study, and thyroid disease (if 
newly diagnosed by the doctor). 
 
Main outcome (SCL-90):  
The main outcome in the present study was the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), originally 
termed the Symptom Distress Checklist (SCL). It was initially used to assess changes in a 
broad range of psychiatric symptoms and distress in psychiatric outpatients in reference to 
therapeutic interventions (22). (Since the initial development of this self-reported psychiatric 
rating scale it has been revised, updated and psychometrically validated (23), (22), (24).  
Today, it is widely used for research purposes and it is also suitable for clinical outcome 
evaluations in different patient populations (25) (26).  
 
 
The SCL-90 is a 90-item questionnaire that measures symptom intensity on nine different 
subscales: “Somatization”, “Obsessive-compulsive”, “Interpersonal sensitivity”, 
“Depression”, “Anxiety”, “Hostility”, “Phobic anxiety”, “Paranoid ideation” and 
“Psychoticism”. Each item of the questionnaire is rated by the patient on a 5-point Likert 
scale. The instrument also includes three global indexes of distress: 1. Global Severity Index 
  
8 
(GSI), a measure of general psychiatric distress; 2. Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), 
a measure of the depth of the experienced problems; and 3. Positive Symptom Total (PST), a 
measure of the number of psychiatric symptoms. In this study, three psychometrically 
validated unidimensional subscales were also used to evaluate the severity of depression 
(SCL-D6), specific anxiety (SCL-ASS8) and interpersonal sensitivity (IPS5), referred to as 
the Hamilton subscales (24). The SCL-90 has been standardised on a Swedish population and 
adjusted T-scores have been calculated (for the Hamilton subscales raw scores are used). T-
scores have a normal mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The cut-off level, indicating 
clinically significant problems, was set to T ≥70 (27).  
Additional outcome (Mindful Attention Awareness): 
(2) The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item instrument designed to 
assess a core characteristic of dispositional mindfulness; namely open or receptive awareness 
and attention to what is taking place in the present. The scale was developed in 2003 by 
Brown and Ryan (28).  
 
Randomisation  
The mindfulness instructors called and informed the patients which were eligible to be 
included in the study. The instructors were also present at the patients’ first study-related visit 
to the PHCC, where the patients provided blood samples and completed the questionnaire. 
This initial visit took place before any psychotherapy or counselling had begun, usually in a 
group environment. Patients were also briefed as to whether they would be included in either 
the intervention group or the control group. The randomisation protocol was designed by the 
Competence Center for Clinical Research at Lund University (a separate department from 
ours) and included a list with numbers 1–20 for each PHCC. Each number was related to 
allocation to the intervention or the control group. Participants were added to the list 
according to the order in which they signed the informed consent form at the medical 
  
9 
consultation. Patients were not allowed to change group, once allocated to one of the two 
groups. Hence, it was not possible for the instructors, or any other members of the research 
team, to have an influence regarding which group the participants were allocated to. The 
researchers were not involved in the treatment of the patients and had no other contact with 
them during the study period. The statisticians, who performed the statistical analysis, had no 
access to personal identifiers in their dataset. Thus, the entire analytic process was blinded.      
 
Intervention – Mindfulness-based group therapy (MGT) 
The programme used in the present study was based on the two mindfulness-based therapies: 
MBSR and MBCT (16-18). It included structured and controlled meditative exercises. The 
period of intervention varied somewhat between the different sites. The first mindfulness 
session took place on 26 January 2012 with the final session occurring on 15 May 2012, in the 
16 participating PHCCs. The mindfulness-based group therapy lasted eight weeks and was 
given in 2h sessions, once a week. The participants were also instructed to practice 
mindfulness at home for 20 min/day and were given a compact disc, a training manual and a 
diary for this purpose. On average, the participants undertook 102 individual-based 
mindfulness sessions, including a mixture of daily mindfulness meditation sessions with 
mindful exercises in common daily situations (s.d.= 44, range 0–219). Two mindfulness 
instructors were present at each group session and each group consisted of a maximum of ten 
participants. Individual attendance at each group session was recorded. 
 
Control group 
The control group received TAU, which often included pharmacologic treatment, and in most 
cases also psychotherapy or counselling. The majority of the patients in the control group 
received CBT (n = 80, 76%) in, on average, 6.3 individual sessions. Other therapies included, 
for example, basic body awareness and other psychotherapies. There were no differences in 
  
10 
pharmacologic treatment between the mindfulness and control group. 
 
Follow-up 
Post intervention, all patients were asked to come to the PHCC to provide blood samples and 
to complete the same questionnaires as those used at baseline. This was done at a specifically 
assigned time, which meant that most participants filled in the questionnaires at the PHCC 
and at the same time point together with other study participants.  
 
Ethical considerations and handling of personal data 
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University prior to its 
commencement on October 5, 2011 (Application No. 2011/491). All participants gave their 
written informed consent and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: 
NCT01476371).  
Power calculation  
The power calculation was based on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS-S), which was used as one of the three screening instruments for inclusion in the 
present study. Thus, MADRS-S was considered as the primary outcome in the RCT that the 
present study was based on. The power calculation was based on the assumption that the 
MGT would be no worse than (i.e. non-inferior to) TAU in the improvement of the MADRS-
S score after treatment (29), (30). 
 
Statistical analysis  
All analyses were repeated for the nine subscales, the three global indexes and the three 
Hamilton subscales. The subscales were highly correlated: an average inter-item correlation 
of 0.64. Characteristics of the study population are presented as the mean and SD for scores 
and age, and as number and percentage for the other variables (Table 1). Differences in 
  
11 
baseline characteristics between the mindfulness and control groups were tested using 
Student’s t test for means and chi-square test for proportions. Within groups analyses (mean 
change between baseline and follow-up of the mindfulness group and control group) were 
performed using the paired t-test (Table 2). A linear regression model for the observed cases 
was used to examine the difference in effect between the mindfulness and control group on 
the outcome (change from baseline), adjusted for baseline score. We also used a random 
intercept linear regression model (mixed model), due to the correlation of measurements 
within individuals. An advantage with mixed models is that all available data are used under 
the missing at random assumption. This means that data from those who drop out, as well as 
data from those who complete the study, can be used. We also dichotomised the T-scores (T 
≥70) and tested the change from baseline to follow-up in the mindfulness and control groups 
using McNemar’s test (Table 3) because of paired data. The difference in effect was 
examined using a logistic regression model on the observed cases, as well as a random-
intercept logistic regression model using all available data. Odds ratios were estimated to 
examine a possible difference in the dichotomised outcome (T-score < 70 after treatment) 
between the mindfulness and the control group. We repeated all analyses with the control 
group, limited to only CBT in an explorative analysis. In an additional analysis we also 
examined the MAAS (Table 4). This is a mean value created from 15 items on awareness and 
attention to what is taking place in the present (28). The analyses in Table 2 were repeated for 
this scale (15). STATA version 12 (StataCorp LP) was used for all statistical analyses. 
 
RESULTS 
A total of 215 eligible patients at the 16 PHCCs were randomised to either mindfulness (n 
=110) or treatment as usual (n = 105). The number of dropouts was higher in the mindfulness 
group (n =18) than in the control group (n = 9). There were no significant differences in 
sociodemographic characteristics between the dropouts and those who remained in the study. 
  
12 
The main reasons for dropout were due to work constraints and lack of time. Other reasons 
included moving house, sickness, no desire for treatment and disappointment at being 
randomised to the control group. We tested the potential influence of more severe psychiatric 
symptoms on the drop-out rate and found no significant association between the number of 
drop-outs and the score values. 
 
Table 1 shows baseline total and subscale scores (transformed to T-scores, except for the 
Hamilton subscales). Mean scores were similar in both the mindfulness and control groups 
(all p-values > 0.05). There were no significant differences in pharmacological treatment 
between the two groups. In both groups, about 35% received a prescription of antidepressants 
and 16% received a prescription of tranquilisers (data not shown in table). The most common 
therapy in the control group was individual CBT (n = 80, 76%) and no patient in the 
mindfulness group also received CBT.  
 
Table 2a shows mean T-scores (raw scores for the Hamilton subscales) and the number of 
observed cases at baseline and follow-up for the two groups, analysed separately. The mean 
scores for the nine subscales, the three indexes and the three Hamilton subscales decreased 
significantly in both groups. All p-values were less than <0.0001, except for the three 
subscales (phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism) in the control group (p-values 
< 0.001). 
 
In Table 2b, the difference in the change in scores over time between the mindfulness and 
control group is shown using a linear regression model on observed cases, and a mixed model 
on all available data. In these models, the T-scores are analysed as continuous variables. Both 
models showed no significant differences between the mindfulness and control group (all p-
values > 0.05) in the change in scores before and after treatment. 
  
13 
  
In Tables 3a and 3b, we examined the clinical response after the intervention by 
dichotomising the T-scores. Clinically significant problems (T-score ≥70) are shown in Table 
3a at baseline and at follow-up. For all subscales and the three indexes, clinically significant 
problems decreased after the intervention (all p-values < 0.05, except for interpersonal 
sensitivity and phobic anxiety in the mindfulness group, p-value = 0.11 and p-value = 0.09, 
respectively). In Table 3b, the difference in treatment effect on the dichotomised scale was 
examined using a logistic regression model on observed cases and a mixed model on all 
available data. Both models showed no significant differences between the two groups (p-
values > 0.05), i.e. we found no evidence of differences in the odds of a clinical response 
between the mindfulness and control groups. 
 
In an explorative analysis, we limited the control group to only CBT (n = 80). No significant 
differences were found (results not shown in tables). 
 
In our additional aim, we examined whether mindful attention and awareness changed after 
the intervention. This is captured by the MAAS and the results are shown in Table 4. In both 
groups the scores increased significantly (p-value = 0.0002 in the mindfulness group and p-
value = 0.004 in the control group), indicating increased capacity to be aware of what is 
taking place in the present post intervention. The difference in effect between the mindfulness 
and the control group was examined with a linear regression model and a mixed model. There 
were no significant differences between the groups, but the adjusted mean difference (β) 
indicated that the increase in MAAS was slightly higher in the mindfulness group than in the 
control group (β = 0.31, p-value = 0.06).  
 
DISCUSSION 
  
14 
This is one of the first RCTs, performed in a primary health care setting, to show that both 
MGT and TAU can reduce a broad range of psychiatric symptoms, assessed by the different 
subscales and indexes in the SCL-90 instrument. Furthermore, there were no significant 
differences in treatment effect, i.e. psychiatric symptoms, between the two groups.  
 
Overall findings and comparisons with previous literature  
Our study is broadly in agreement with the findings made by Kuyken et al (14). However, the 
UK study was primarily focused on relapse/recurrence while the present study aimed to 
examine a broad range of psychiatric symptoms. Our findings concur with a 2011 meta-
analysis of 39 studies (31) which showed that depressive symptoms (20 studies) and anxiety 
(19 studies) actually decreased as a result of MBSR. However, many of these studies had no 
control group and the sample sizes were relatively small. The advantages of our study are the 
use of a control group, a rather large sample size and the randomised design. In another meta-
analysis, based on 19 studies, it was found that mindfulness is also associated with sizeable 
decreases in symptoms of anxiety and depression (11). That finding concurs with the current 
study. A comprehensive meta-analysis (32) from 2013, including 209 studies (n=12,145), 
showed that mindfulness-based therapies were generally effective in reducing psychological 
symptoms and did not differ from traditional CBT; findings that concur with the present 
study.  
 
Although there are previous studies on the impact of mindfulness on psychiatric symptoms, 
there remains a paucity of information based on RCTs. A previous review, based on 15 
different studies, revealed that variety in the methodologies and subject samples was manifest 
(33). In approximately 50 percent of the studies (8/15) there was a clear reduction of 
symptoms of anxiety or depression after mindfulness-based therapy. None of these studies 
included, however, an active control group. The authors of that review remarked that, in 
future studies, there should be a greater focus on the role of an active control group as a 
  
15 
means of comparing the effect of mindfulness-based therapies with more traditional forms of 
treatment. Furthermore, studies carried out since 2012 have reinforced this message by calling 
for more analyses using an RCT design (34). In a clinical trial conducted in Denmark (35), a 
total of 336 women, who had undergone surgery for breast cancer, participated in an 8-week 
mindfulness-based group program. The researchers found that the two-month long therapy 
program yielded relevant results on both a statistical and clinical basis, particularly with 
regard to depression and anxiety during the follow-up. 
 
Previous research has also indicated that individuals who practice mindfulness can gain 
potential health benefits (36). These include a greater tolerance of stress, with resulting lower 
susceptibility to feelings of anxiety and pressure. Patients who embrace the particular 
breathing methods associated with mindfulness learn to be mindful of the present. 
Characteristic behaviour, e.g. adverse reactions to emotional situations, can thus be modified 
by using mindfulness to cope and react in a more composed manner (36). Studies carried out 
since 2003 have also noted the affirmative effects of mindfulness on affective experience 
(37), as well as on personal perception and pain symptoms (38, 39). 
 
A theoretical rationale for how mindfulness therapy reduces psychiatric symptoms 
The theoretical rationale for how mindfulness therapy may reduce psychiatric symptoms lies 
in the way that mindfulness therapy is given and in the suggested changes in the function and 
structure of the brain. For example, in the present study, the patients were instructed and 
trained to become aware of the present moment in a non-judgemental and compassionate way 
using the breath, the body, sounds, and, finally, thoughts and emotions and relate to them in a 
wider, decentered perspective as “mental events” rather than accurate reflections of reality or 
ruminations, which is the opposite to observe thoughts. The instructors emphasised on 
changing awareness and relationship to thoughts through acceptance rather than directly 
  
16 
modifying or removing them per se (as in CBT). Another emphasis of the training was that 
the patients became increasingly aware of dysphoric and depressive thoughts and emotions 
and could connect them in a wider perspective as mental events, rather than as aspects of the 
self (40). Mindfulness training may change the patterns of brain activity that underlie 
depression and anxiety. Preliminary functional neuroimaging studies are consistent with an 
account of mindfulness therapy (41) improving emotional regulation by enhancing cortical 
regulation of limbic circuits and attentional control. A recent review (42) found growing 
evidence that mindfulness techniques might influence the function and structure of the brain. 
This review of 36 studies analysed MBSR/MBCT interventions combined with functional 
and/or structural imaging techniques. The authors concluded that the amygdala seems to play 
a larger role in the neuronal working mechanism in MBSR, than it does in traditional 
meditation. MBSR induced emotional and behavioural changes that were associated with 
functional and structural changes in the brain. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex showed 
increased activity after MBSR while insula and the cingulate cortex showed more disparate 
results. A recent (43) longitudinal study (n=13) showed that 8-week MBSR training had 
antidepressant effects and that there were plastic changes in both resting and meditation state 
brain activity. There were changes in whole brain networks towards connectivity states 
(anterior cingulate cortex) and the putamen was identified as a potentially important 
subcortical region during meditation.  
 
Significance for treatment in primary care in Sweden and internationally 
In a 2008 Swedish study it was suggested that switching resources to group therapy in 
primary care could be advantageous to treat patients with depression (44). Such a switch 
would free up staff resources as CBT therapists remain in great demand. Once patients have 
become acquainted with mindfulness, they are in a position to practice the therapy on their 
own. This has positive clinical ramifications since it means the treatment has the potential to 
  
17 
be utilised by a far greater number of patients, compared to more traditional and costly forms 
of psychotherapy. In Sweden, the number of CBT therapists does not meet the demand of 
patients and there can be a long waiting time before treatment can begin.  
 
Limitations and Strengths 
The present study has some limitations. For patients who started treatment the dropout rate 
was 17.8% (18/101) in the mindfulness group and 9.5% (9/95) in the control group. It is 
possible that the generalisability of our findings could be affected by the dropout rate. 
However, on this basis, we have no reason to suggest that the dropout rate in our study was 
potentially greater than in previous studies of a similar nature. In addition, the period of 
follow-up was not particularly long and comprised an analysis of symptoms after the 8-week 
program had concluded. As a result, we are not able to ascertain whether the improvement of 
symptoms would have remained the same if the follow-up period had been of a longer 
duration. Our study also has several strengths, such as the use of an RCT with an active 
control group. We believe this study contributes considerably to the existing research in this 
field, which is sparse. In addition, our study of more than 200 randomised patients took place 
in 16 PHCCs in both rural and metropolitan neighbourhoods. 
 
Future studies 
Based on the results of the present study and previous research, we suggest that future studies 
use an active control group and have an RCT-design.  We also suggest that future studies 
include participants from different age and sociodemographic groups. For example, future 
studies could include elderly people as well as children and adolescents from different types 
of schools and neighbourhood environments. Another aspect worth investigating further is 
whether the length and frequency of the mindfulness practice has an effect on the outcome 
under study. Finally, more studies of how the function and structure of the brain is influenced 
  
18 
by mindfulness are valuable in order to increase the understanding of the neurophysiological 
and neuroradiological correlates to mindfulness effects.  
 
Conclusions 
No significant differences in treatment effect between MGT and TAU, mainly individual-
based CBT, were found.. Both types of therapies could be used in primary care patients with 
depressive, anxiety and/or stress and adjustment disorders, where the group-based nature as 
well as short training (six days) of instructors in MGT has a large potential to save limited 
health care resources.
