Botulinum neurotoxins are known to have seven serotypes (BoNT/A–G). Here we report a
new BoNT serotype, tentatively named BoNT/X, which has the lowest sequence identity
with other BoNTs and is not recognized by antisera against known BoNTs. Similar to
BoNT/B/D/F/G, BoNT/X cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP) 1, 2 and 3,
but at a novel site (Arg66-Ala67 in VAMP2). Remarkably, BoNT/X is the only toxin that also
cleaves non-canonical substrates VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6. To validate its activity, a small
amount of full-length BoNT/X was assembled by linking two non-toxic fragments using a
transpeptidase (sortase). Assembled BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 and VAMP4 in cultured
neurons and causes flaccid paralysis in mice. Thus, BoNT/X is a novel BoNT with a unique
substrate profile. Its discovery posts a challenge to develop effective countermeasures,
provides a novel tool for studying intracellular membrane trafficking, and presents a new
potential therapeutic toxin for modulating secretions in cells.

oNTs are a family of bacterial toxins, classified as one of the
six most dangerous potential bioterrorism agents (Category
A and Tier 1 select agent in the United States)1. They are
also widely used to treat a growing list of medical conditions2,3,
including muscle spasms, chronic pain, overactive bladders,
as well as having cosmetic applications. There are seven
well-established serotypes of BoNTs (BoNT/A–G), traditionally
defined based on a lack of cross-neutralization by different
antisera raised against each toxin type. All BoNTs share the same
structure and function4–6. They are composed of a light chain
(LC, B50 kDa) and a heavy chain (HC, B100 kDa) connected by
an inter-chain disulfide bond. The HC contains two sub-domains:
the C-terminal HC that mediates binding to receptors, and the
N-terminal HN that mediates translocation of the LC across
endosomal membranes. The LC acts as a protease in neurons
to cleave a set of proteins: BoNT/A, C and E cleave at distinct
sites on a peripheral membrane protein known as SNAP-25;
BoNT/B, D, F and G cleave at different sites on homologous
vesicle proteins VAMP1, 2 and 3 (vesicle-associated membrane
proteins); and BoNT/C also cleaves the plasma membrane protein
syntaxin 1. These proteins are prototypes of the SNARE (soluble
NSF
attachment
protein
receptor)
protein
family,
whose
members
mediate
various
membrane
fusion
events
in
eukaryotic cells7,8. Cleavage of any one of the three neuronal
SNARE proteins blocks fusion of synaptic vesicles to plasma
membranes, thus preventing neurotransmitter release from
neurons.
Recognizing all distinct serotypes of BoNTs is essential for
developing effective countermeasures against this family of
toxins. BoNT/A and BoNT/B were first identified in 1919 by
Georgina Burke9. The last of the seven serotypes, BoNT/G,
was discovered in 1969 (ref. 10), and no new BoNT serotype has
been found for the past four decades. Recent progress in genomic
sequencing has revealed multiple subtypes (designated with
Arabic
numbers,
for
example,
BoNT/A1),
which
can
be
recognized by the same antiserum but contain substantial
sequence variations11–13. Furthermore, there are also multiple
mosaic toxins. For instance, a ‘type H’ was reported in 2013 but
was later designated as a mosaic toxin, as its LC shares B80%
identity with the LC of a BoNT/F subtype, BoNT/F5, and its HC
shares B84% identity with the HC of BoNT/A1 (refs 14–17).
Consistently, this toxin can be neutralized by antibodies against
BoNT/A (ref. 16).
The genes encoding BoNTs can be on a plasmid, a phage, or
the chromosome, indicating that these genes are mobile and
capable of horizontal gene transfer18–23. Some strains contain two
or even three different BoNT genes15,24,25. These strains are
usually designated with a capital letter for the toxin type that is
expressed at higher levels than the other one, followed with a
lower case letter for the second toxin type (for example, BoNT/Af
strain). In addition, it has also been reported that some BoNT/A
strains contain a complete BoNT/B gene, but only BoNT/A is
expressed26–28. Thus, the BoNT/B gene is considered a silent gene
and the strains are known as BoNT/A(B) strains. A recent survey
of infant botulism cases reported that B8% isolates are
BoNT/A(B) strains29.
Here we searched published genomic sequences and identified
a novel BoNT gene encoded on the chromosome of Clostridium
botulinum strain 111. This strain was originally identified from an
infant botulism patient in Japan in 1996 (ref. 30). The initial
characterizations indicated that the toxicity of this strain is due to
BoNT/B30. Later studies confirmed that this strain expresses a
subtype of BoNT/B (BoNT/B2) encoded on a plasmid31,32.
The sequence of this novel BoNT gene was deposited into the
GenBank database in February 2015, as a part of the genomic
sequence of C. botulinum 111. We characterized the protein
encoded by this gene at functional levels and established it as a
new BoNT serotype with a unique substrate profile.
Results
Searching genomic databases revealed a novel BoNT gene.
In an attempt to survey the evolutionary landscape of BoNTs,
we performed iterative Hidden Markov model searches of the
Uniprot sequence database. Our search identified all known
BoNT subtypes and mosaic toxins, as well as the related tetanus
neurotoxin (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 1). To our surprise, the
search revealed a potentially new BoNT, tentatively designated
BoNT/X (Fig. 1a, GenBank no.: BAQ12790.1), from the recently
reported genomic sequence of C. botulinum strain 111. BoNT/X
showed the least protein sequence identity with the other BoNTs
in pairwise comparisons (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the low sequence
similarity is evenly distributed along the entire BoNT/X sequence
(Fig. 1c), indicating that it is not a mosaic toxin. Despite this low
sequence identity, the overall domain arrangement of BoNTs is
conserved in BoNT/X (Fig. 1c), including a zinc-dependent
protease motif HEXXH (residues 227–231, HELVH) in the LC
(ref. 33), and a SXWY motif in the HC (residues 1,274–1,277,
SAWY), which recognizes the lipid receptor gangliosides34.
Similar to the other BoNTs, the BoNT/X gene is located in a
gene cluster23. All seven established BoNTs are co-expressed
with another 150 kDa protein known as NTNHA (non-toxic
non-hemagglutinin
protein),
which
forms
a
pH-dependent
complex with BoNTs and protects them from proteases in the
gastrointestinal tract35. The BoNT/X gene is also preceded by a
potential NTNHA gene (Fig. 1d). Besides BoNT and NTNHA,
a typical BoNT gene cluster contains genes encoding one of the
two types of accessory proteins: (1) the HA cluster encoding three
conserved proteins HA17, HA33 and HA70, which form a
complex with BoNT/NTNHA and facilitate absorption of toxins
across the intestinal epithelial barrier36–38; or (2) the OrfX cluster
encoding conserved OrfX1, OrfX2, OrfX3 and P47 proteins with
unknown function23. The BoNT/X gene is located in an OrfX
gene cluster, as are BoNT/E, F and members of BoNT/A.
Interestingly, the BoNT/X cluster has two unique features
(Fig. 1d): (1) there is an additional OrfX2 gene that does not
exist in any other BoNT clusters (we designated it OrfX2b);
(2) the reading frame of OrfX genes is usually opposite to
BoNT/NTNHA genes, but it has the same direction as the
BoNT/X gene in the BoNT/X cluster (Fig. 1d). These findings
suggest that BoNT/X is a unique branch of the BoNT family.
The LC of BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 at a novel site. To
characterize BoNT/X, we first focused on its LC (X-LC, residues
1–439) and produced it as a His6-tagged protein in Escherichia
coli. LCs of BoNT/A (A-LC) and BoNT/B (B-LC) were produced
and assayed in parallel as controls. Incubation of X-LC with
rat brain detergent extracts (BDE) did not affect syntaxin 1 or
SNAP-25, but abolished VAMP2 immunoblot signals (Fig. 2a).
LCs of BoNTs are zinc-dependent proteases33. As expected,
EDTA prevented cleavage of SNARE proteins by X-, A- and
B-LCs (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, incubation of X-LC with the
purified recombinant cytosolic domain of VAMP2 (residues
1–93) converted VAMP2 into two lower-molecular-weight bands
(Fig. 2b), confirming that X-LC cleaves VAMP2.
To identify the cleavage site, we analysed the VAMP2 (1–93)
protein, with or without pre-incubation with X-LC, by liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS,
Fig. 2c–e). A single dominant peptide peak appeared after
incubation with X-LC (Fig. 2c,e; Supplementary Fig. 2). Its
molecular weight is 3,081.7, which fits only the peptide sequence
of A67-L93 of VAMP2 (Fig. 2c,e). Consistently, another fragment

 from the beginning of the His6-tag to residue R66 of VAMP2 was
also detected (Fig. 2d). To further confirm this finding, we
repeated the assay with a different VAMP2 fragment: glutathione
S-transferase (GST) tagged VAMP2 (33–86) (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Incubation with X-LC generated a single dominant
peptide peak with a molecular weight of 2,063.1, which fits only
A67-R86 of VAMP2 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Together, these
results demonstrate that X-LC has a single cleavage site on
VAMP2 between R66 and A67.
R66-A67 is a novel cleavage site on VAMP2, distinct from all
established target sites of BoNTs (Fig. 2f). It is also the only BoNT
cleavage site located within a region previously known as the
SNARE motif (Fig. 2f, shaded regions)39. The VAMP protein
family includes VAMP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, as well as related
Sec22b and Ykt6. R66-A67 is conserved in VAMP1 and 3, which
are highly homologous to VAMP2. To validate the specificity of
X-LC, we expressed HA-tagged VAMP1, 3, 7, 8 and Myc-tagged
Sec22b and Ykt6 in HEK293 cells via transient transfection.
Cell lysates were incubated with X-LC. Both VAMP1 and 3 were
cleaved by X-LC, whereas VAMP7, VAMP8 and Sec22b were
resistant to X-LC (Fig. 2g).
BoNT/X cleaves VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6. Unexpectedly,
Ykt6 was also cleaved by X-LC (Fig. 2g). This finding was con-
firmed using a purified GST-tagged Ykt6 fragment, which shifted
to a lower-molecular-weight band after incubation with X-LC
(Fig. 2h). The cleavage site was determined to be K173-S174 by
mass spectrometry analysis of the intact Ykt6 versus Ykt6 cleaved
by X-LC (Supplementary Fig. 4). This site is homologous to the
cleavage site of BoNT/X on VAMP2 (Fig. 2f). Among VAMP
family of proteins, VAMP4 contains the same pair of residues
(K87-S88) at this site as Ykt6. We found that X-LC cleaved both
purified GST-tagged cytoplasmic domain of VAMP4 (Fig. 2i),
as well as native VAMP4 in BDE (Fig. 2j). As a control, Sec22b
was not cleaved by X-LC in BDE. In addition, the GST-tagged
cytoplasmic domain of VAMP5 was also cleaved (Fig. 2i). The
cleavage sites were determined by mass spectrometry analysis to
be K87-S88 in VAMP4 and R40-S41 in VAMP5 (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Both sites are homologous to the cleavage site of BoNT/X
on VAMP2 (Fig. 2f), demonstrating that the location of the
cleavage site is conserved across different VAMPs. The ability of
X-LC to cleave VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6 is highly unusual, as
their sequences are substantially different from VAMP1/2/3.
BoNT/X is the first and the only BoNT known that can cleave
VAMPs beyond the canonical targets VAMP1, 2 and 3 (ref. 40).
Proteolytic activation of BoNT/X. We next examined the linker
region between the LC and the HC, which must be cleaved by
bacterial or host proteases to convert the toxin to an ‘active’
di-chain form. We produced a recombinant X-LC-HN fragment
(residues 1–891) in E. coli and subjected it to limited proteolysis
by endoproteinase Lys-C. Samples were analysed using Tandem
Mass Tag (TMT) labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. TMT
labels free N-termini (and lysines). Limited proteolysis by Lys-C

 produced one new free N terminus mapped to residue N439 in
the linker region (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 1), confirming that
the linker region is susceptible to proteases.
We then examined whether proteolytic activation enhances the
potency of BoNT/X. It has been shown that incubation of high
concentrations of LC-HN of BoNTs with cultured neurons results
in entry of LC-HN, likely through non-specific uptake into
neurons41. Similarly, X-LC-HN entered cultured rat cortical
neurons and cleaved VAMP2 in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 3b). Activation by Lys-C increased the potency of
X-LC-HN: 10 nM activated X-LC-HN cleaved similar levels of
VAMP2 as 150 nM intact X-LC-HN (Fig. 3b). Activated X-LC-HN

Figure 2 | The LC of BoNT/X cleaves VAMPs at a unique site. (a) X-LC was incubated with BDE. Immunoblot analysis was carried out to detect syntaxin 1,
SNAP-25 and VAMP2. Synaptophysin (Syp) served as a loading control. A-LC and B-LC were analysed in parallel. Cleavage of VAMP2 by B-LC results in
loss of immunoblot signals, while cleavage of SNAP-25 by A-LC generates a smaller fragment (marked with an asterisk). EDTA blocked the activity of X-,
A- and B-LCs. (b) VAMP2 (1–93) was incubated with X-LC. Samples were analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. X-LC converted VAMP2
(1–93) into two smaller fragments. (c–e) VAMP2 (1–93) was incubated with X-LC. Samples were analysed by mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to
determine the molecular weight of cleaved fragments. Eluted peptide peaks from the HPLC column are plotted over running time (RT, X axis). The mass
spectrometry data for the two cleavage products are colour-coded, with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) noted. The molecular weight is deduced by multiplying
m with z, followed by subtracting z. The protein sequences for the two cleavage products are colour-coded and listed in c. (f) Sequence alignment between
VAMP family members, with the cleavage sites for BoNT/B, D, F, G and X marked in red, and the two SNARE motifs in blue shade. (g) HA-tagged VAMP1, 3,

immunoblot analysis. Actin is a loading control. (h) GST-tagged Ykt6 was incubated with X-LC (100 nM). Samples were analysed by SDS–PAGE and
Coomassie Blue staining. (i) GST-tagged VAMP2 (33–86), VAMP4 (1–115) and VAMP5 (1–70) were incubated with X-LC (100 nM). Samples were analysed
by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. X-LC cleaved both VAMP4 and VAMP5. We note that VAMP5 protein contains a contaminant band that runs
close to the cleavage product. (j) Experiments were carried out as described in a, except that VAMP4 and Sec22b were detected. Synaptotagmin I (Syt I) is
a loading control. X-LC cleaved native VAMP4 in BDE. One of two (b,g,j) or three (a,h,i) independent experiments is shown.

 appears to be more potent than activated LC-HN of BoNT/A
(A-LC-HN) and BoNT/B (B-LC-HN), which did not show any
detectable cleavage of their substrates under the same assay
conditions (Fig. 3b).
The inter-chain disulfide bond in BoNT/X. Like other BoNTs,
the linker region of BoNT/X contains two conserved cysteines,
but there is also an additional cysteine (C461) unique to BoNT/X
(Fig. 3a). To determine the cysteine residues that form the
essential inter-chain disulfide bond, we generated three X-LC-HN
mutants, each with one of the three cysteine residues mutated
(C423S, C461S and C467S). These mutants, as well as wild-type
(WT) X-LC-HN, were subjected to limited proteolysis with Lys-C
and then analysed via SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining,
with or without the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT; Fig. 3c).
Mutating the only cysteine on the LC (C423S) is expected to
abolish the inter-chain disulfide bond. Consistently, C423S
mutant separated into two B50 kDa bands without DTT.
In contrast, both C461S and C467S mutants showed as a single
band at 100 kDa in the absence of DTT and separated into two
B50 kDa bands in the presence of DTT. These results suggested
that C423 on the LC can form the inter-chain disulfide bond with
either C461 or C467 on the HC. We also found that Lys-C
treatment degraded a significant portion of C423S mutant as
compared with C461S or C467S mutants (Fig. 3c, þ DTT),
suggesting that losing the inter-chain disulfide bond makes the
molecule more susceptible to proteases. We noticed that a portion
of WT X-LC-HN formed aggregates at the top of the SDS–PAGE
gel (Fig. 3c, marked by an asterisk). These aggregates disappeared
in the presence of DTT. C423/C461/C467 are the only three
cysteines in the X-LC-HN; mutating any one of them abolished
formation of aggregates (Fig. 3c, � DTT), suggesting that these
aggregates are formed by inter-molecular disulfide bonds due to
the existence of an extra cysteine in the linker region.
Interestingly, the majority of activated WT X-LC-HN separated
into two B50 kDa bands without DTT (Fig. 3c), which is similar
to C423S mutant. On the other hand, WT X-LC-HN did not show

Figure 3 | Proteolytic activation and inter-chain disulfide bond in BoNT/X. (a) Sequence alignment of the linker between the LC and HC of the seven
established BoNTs plus BoNT/X. The Lys-C cutting site was identified by mass spectrometry analysis (see Method and Supplementary Data 1). (b) Cultured
rat cortical neurons were exposed to X-LC-HN for 12 h. Cell lysates were harvested and immunoblot analysis carried out to examine syntaxin 1, SNAP-25
and VAMP2. Actin is a loading control. Trypsin-activated A-LC-HN and B-LC-HN were analysed in parallel. X-LC-HN entered neurons and cleaved VAMP2.
X-LC-HN activated by Lys-C showed a greater potency than non-activated X-LC-HN. X-LC-HN was more potent than B-LC-HN and A-LC-HN, neither of which
cleaved their substrates. (c) WT and mutant X-LC-HN were activated by Lys-C and analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, with or without
DTT. C461S and C467S mutants showed as a single band at B100 kDa without DTT, and separated into two B50 kDa bands with DTT. A portion of WT
X-LC-HN formed aggregates, marked by an asterisk, which disappeared with DTT. The majority of activated WT X-LC-HN separated into two B50 kDa
bands without DTT. This is due to disulfide bond shuffling as described in the following panel. (d) Lys-C-activated WT X-LC-HN was incubated with NEM to
block disulfide bond shuffling. Samples were then analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. A majority of WT X-LC-HN exists as a single band
at B100 kDa without DTT after NEM treatment, indicating that native WT X-LC-HN contains an inter-chain disulfide bond. (e) Schematic drawings of the
disulfide bond in WTand three cysteine mutants of BoNT/X. (f) Experiments were carried out as described in b, except that neurons were exposed to WT
or X-LC-HN mutants. C423S mutation abolished the activity of X-LC-HN, whereas mutating C461 or C467 did not affect the activity of X-LC-HN.
These results confirmed that the inter-chain disulfide bond is essential for the activity of X-LC-HN, and this inter-chain disulfide bond can be formed via
either C423-C461 or C423-C467. One of two (b) or three (b,c,f) independent experiments is shown.

 increased degradation by Lys-C compared with C423S mutant
(Fig. 3c, þ DTT). One possible explanation is that WT X-LC-HN
contains an inter-chain disulfide bond under native conditions,
but this bond can rearrange to intra-chain C461–C467 pair under
denaturing conditions in the SDS buffer. This phenomenon is
known as disulfide bond shuffling, which often occurs among
adjacent cysteines. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an
alkylating reagent, N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), which permanently
blocks free cysteines and prevents disulfide bond shuffling. As
shown in Fig. 3d, WT X-LC-HN pretreated with NEM showed as
a single band at 100 kDa in the absence of DTT, and separated
into two B50 kDa bands in the presence of DTT. These results
confirm that WT X-LC-HN contains mainly an inter-chain
disulfide bond, but it is susceptible to disulfide bond shuffling due
to an extra cysteine in the linker region (Fig. 3e).
We further examined the activity of the three X-LC-HN
cysteine mutants on cultured neurons. As expected, C423S
mutant was inactive, whereas C461S and C467S mutants both
showed similar levels of activity as WT X-LC-HN (Fig. 3f). These
results confirm that the inter-chain disulfide bond is critical for
the activity of BoNT/X.
Generating full-length BoNT/X via sortase-mediated ligation.
We then sought to determine whether full-length BoNT/X is a
functional toxin. As no antisera against BoNT/X are available,
we decided to avoid generating the full-length active toxin gene.
Instead, we developed an approach to generate a limited amount
of full-length BoNTs in test tubes by enzymatic ligation of two
non-toxic fragments of BoNTs. This method utilizes a trans-
peptidase known as sortase42,43, which recognizes the peptide
motif LPXTG, cleaves between T-G, and concurrently forms a
new peptide bond with other proteins/peptides containing
N-terminal glycine (Fig. 4a). We produced two non-toxic
fragments of BoNT/X: (1) LC-HN with a LPETGG motif and a
His6-tag fused to the C terminus; and (2) the HC of BoNT/X
(X-HC) with a GST tag, thrombin cleavage site, and an additional
glycine residue at its N terminus. Cutting by thrombin releases
X-HC with a free glycine at its N terminus. Incubation of these
two fragments with sortase generated a small amount of
B150 kD full-length BoNT/X (X-FL, Fig. 4a,b). We note that
X-HC showed poor solubility and a strong tendency towards
aggregation, which might be the reason for the low ligation
efficiency (Fig. 4b). In contrast, ligation of X-LC-HN with the HC
of BoNT/A (A-HC) achieved a better efficiency, with the majority
of X-LC-HN ligated into a XA chimeric toxin (Supplementary
Fig. 6a). To ensure biosafety, the amount of precursor fragments
in the reaction is strictly limited to generate the minimum
amount of ligated toxin necessary for functional assays.
We first analysed the activity of ligated BoNT/X using cultured
rat cortical neurons. Neurons were exposed to the sortase ligation
mixture and control mixtures in culture medium. As shown in

Figure 4 | Full-length BoNT/X is active on cultured neurons and in vivo in mice. (a) A schematic drawing of the sortase ligation method. (b) Sortase
ligation reaction mixtures were analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The asterisk marks the proteins aggregates due to inter-molecular
disulfide bonds. Full-length BoNT/X (X-FL) appeared only in the sortase ligation mixture. (c) Neurons exposed to the sortase ligation mixture (15 ml) or
control mixtures for 12 h in culture medium. Cell lysates were analysed by immunoblot. The mixture containing both X-LC-HN and X-HC (but not sortase)
cleaved slightly more VAMP2 than X-LC-HN alone. Ligating X-LC-HN and X-HC by sortase further enhanced cleavage of VAMP2, demonstrating that ligated
X-FL is functional on neurons. (d) BoNT/A-G, BoNT/DC and BoNT/X were subjected to the dot blot assay, using four horse antisera (trivalent anti-BoNT/A,
B and E, anti-BoNT/C, anti-BoNT/DC and anti-BoNT/F), as well as two goat antisera (anti-BoNT/G and anti-BoNT/D). BoNT/X is composed of X-LC-HN
and X-HC at 1:1 molar ratio. These antisera recognized their corresponding target toxins, yet none recognized BoNT/X. The antisera against BoNT/DC and
BoNT/C cross-react, as these two toxins share a high degree of similarity within their HC domains. (e) Cultured rat cortical neurons were exposed to ligated
X-FL in culture medium for 12 h, with or without two combinations of anti-sera. Ab1: trivalent anti-BoNT/A/B/E, anti-BoNT/C and anti-BoNT/F. Ab2:
anti-BoNT/G and anti-BoNT/D. The trivalent anti-BoNT/A/B/E was used at 1:50 dilution. All other anti-sera were used at 1:100 dilution. None of the
antisera affected the cleavage of VAMP2 and VAMP4 by X-FL. The specificity and potency of these antisera were validated for their ability to neutralize
target serotypes in the same assay as described in Supplementary Fig. 7. (f) X-FL linked by sortase reaction (0.5 mg) was injected into the gastrocnemius
muscles of the right hind limb of mice (n ¼ 4). The injected limb developed typical flaccid paralysis, and the toes failed to spread within 12 h. The left limb
was not injected with toxins, serving as a control. (g) Full-length inactive form of BoNT/X (BoNT/XRY) was purified as a His6-tagged recombinant protein in
E. coli. Further purified BoNT/XRY is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8b. One of two (e) or three (c,d) independent experiments is shown.

 Fig. 4c, X-LC-HN alone cleaved some VAMP2 due to its high
concentration in the reaction mixture. Mixing X-HC with
X-LC-HN without sortase slightly enhanced cleavage of VAMP2
compared with X-LC-HN alone, suggesting that X-HC might be
associated with X-LC-HN via non-covalent interactions. This
interaction appears to be specific, as mixing A-HC with X-LC-HN
did not enhance cleavage of VAMP2 in neurons (Supplementary
Fig. 6b). Ligating X-LC-HN with X-HC by sortase clearly
enhanced cleavage of VAMP2 compared with the mixture of
X-LC-HN and X-HC without sortase (Fig. 4c). These results
demonstrated that the X-HC is functional for targeting cells and
that ligated full-length BoNT/X entered neurons and cleaved
VAMP2. Similarly, ligated XA also entered neurons and cleaved
VAMP2 (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
BoNT/X was not recognized by antisera against known BoNTs.
We next carried out dot blot assays using antisera raised against
known BoNTs, including all seven serotypes as well as one mosaic
toxin (BoNT/DC), to confirm that BoNT/X is serologically
unique. Four horse antisera were utilized (trivalent anti-BoNT/A,
B and E, anti-BoNT/C, anti-BoNT/DC, and anti-BoNT/F) as well
as two goat antisera (anti-BoNT/G and anti-BoNT/D). The
specificity and potency of these antisera were first validated by
analysing their ability to neutralize BoNTs on cultured neurons.
As expected, all antisera neutralized their target BoNTs, without
affecting the activity of a different serotype (Supplementary
Fig. 7). We found that these antisera recognized their corre-
sponding BoNTs in the dot blot assay, yet none recognized
BoNT/X (Fig. 4d).
We further analysed whether the toxicity of BoNT/X on
neurons can be neutralized by these antisera. X-FL generated by
sortase-mediated
ligation
was
first
activated
with
limited
proteolysis using trypsin. We used trypsin to activate X-FL
instead of Lys-C for functional assays, as trypsin allows us to stop
proteolysis using trypsin inhibitors. Activated X-FL entered
cultured
rat
cortical
neurons
and
cleaved
both
VAMP2
and VAMP4 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4e).
Combinations of antisera against known BoNTs (Ab1 (horse
antisera):
trivalent
anti-BoNT/A,
B
and
E,
anti-BoNT/C,
and
anti-BoNT/F;
Ab2
(goat
antisera):
anti-BoNT/G
and
anti-BoNT/D) did not affect the activity of ligated X-FL,
as evidenced by similar degrees of VAMP2 and VAMP4 cleavage
in the presence of these antisera (Fig. 4e). These results confirmed
that BoNT/X is a new BoNT serotype.
BoNT/X induced flaccid paralysis in vivo in mice. We next
sought to determine whether BoNT/X is active in vivo using a
well-established non-lethal assay in mice, known as the Digit
Abduction Score (DAS) assay, which measures local muscle
paralysis following injection of BoNTs into mouse hind limb
muscles44. BoNTs cause flaccid paralysis of limb muscles, which
is manifested as the failure to spread the toes in response to a
startle stimulus. We injected ligated X-FL (0.5 mg, activated by
trypsin treatment) into the gastrocnemius muscles of the right
hind limb in mice, which induced typical flaccid paralysis and the
failure of toes to spread (Fig. 4f), indicating that BoNT/X is
capable of causing flaccid paralysis in vivo. We note that the
potency of ligated X-FL appears to be much lower than other
BoNTs in this assay. To further confirm the low toxicity of ligated
X-FL, we injected mice with 1 mg of ligated X-FL intraperitoneally
(n ¼ 3). No mice showed any systemic effects and all survived at
this dose. Thus, ligated X-FL has a rather low toxicity in vivo in
mice compared with other native BoNTs, which usually have
lethal doses at low picogram levels per mouse.
Full-length
inactive
BoNT/X.
Finally,
we
developed
an
inactive
mutant
of
BoNT/X
as
a
potential
reagent
for
generating neutralizing antibodies. Mutations at two residues
(R362A/Y365F) in BoNT/A inactivate the protease activity of the
LC and abolish the toxicity of BoNT/A in vivo45,46. These
two residues are conserved in BoNT/X. We introduced the
corresponding
mutations
(R360A/Y363F)
in
BoNT/X
and
generated a full-length inactive form, designated as BoNT/XRY.
As shown in Fig. 4g, BoNT/XRY was purified as a His6-tagged
protein in E. coli, and it had no activity on cultured neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection
of mice with 30 mg BoNT/XRY (activated by trypsin treatment)
did not cause any adverse effects (n ¼ 5), demonstrating that it is
not toxic in vivo. A substantial portion of BoNT/XRY formed
aggregates at the top of the SDS–PAGE gel (Fig. 4g). Adding DTT
reduced these aggregates to monomeric BoNT/XRY (Fig. 4g).
Thus, full-length BoNT/X is susceptible to forming inter-
molecular disulfide bonds. Nevertheless, the monomeric form
of BoNT/X can be purified and is stable in solution (Fig. 4g).
Furthermore, we developed a scale-up purification protocol,
which generated BoNT/XRY with a yield of B3 mg per liter
of culture and B90% purity (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Highly
purified BoNT/XRY remained stable in solution up to 10 mg ml � 1
in the presence of reducing agent. This atoxic BoNT/XRY will be a
valuable reagent for generating neutralizing antibodies.
Discussion
BoNT/X is the first serotype of BoNTs identified by genomic
sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. It remains unknown
whether BoNT/X is ever produced in C. botulinum strain 111.
BoNT/X could be a silent gene, or it may not be expressed at
detectable toxicity levels under culture conditions in the lab.
Thus, this toxin was revealed only by sequencing C. botulinum
111. This illustrates the importance of genomic sequencing and
bioinformatics approaches for understanding microbial virulence
factors. Whether BoNT/X could be expressed and exhibit toxicity
under certain environmental conditions remains an intriguing
question.
A remarkable feature of BoNT/X is its unique ability to cleave
VAMP4 and Ykt6. VAMP4 is widely expressed and is known to
mediate vesicle fusion between the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
and endosomes, as well as homotypic fusion of endosomes47,48.
Ykt6 is an atypical SNARE without a transmembrane domain49.
It is anchored to membranes via lipidation, which allows dynamic
regulation of its membrane association. Ykt6 is an essential
protein
in
yeast
and
implicated
in
multiple
membrane
fusion events including ER-Golgi, intra-Golgi, endosome-Golgi-
vacuolar,
and
autophagosome
formation.
Its
function
in
mammalian cells remains to be established. BoNT/X is the first
and only BoNT to cleave these SNAREs that mediate various
intracellular membrane-trafficking events.
Interestingly, both VAMP4 and Ykt6 are enriched in neurons.
Recent studies suggested that VAMP4 contributes to asynchro-
nous synaptic vesicle exocytosis, enlargeosome exocytosis and
activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) in neurons50–52.
The role of Ykt6 in neurons remains to be established, but it has
been shown to suppress the toxicity of a-synuclein in Parkinson’s
disease models53,54. The other substrate of BoNT/X, VAMP5, is
mainly expressed in muscle cells and its function remains to be
established55. BoNT/X will be a useful tool to investigate the
function of VAMP4, Ykt6 and VAMP5, as well as related
membrane trafficking events. In addition, because VAMP4 has
been implicated in granule release in immune cells56, BoNT/X
may have the potential to modulate inflammatory secretion in
immune cells.

 The X-LC-HN fragment showed a higher level of activity in
neurons than either A-LC-HN or B-LC-HN, suggesting that its
membrane translocation and/or protease activity might be more
efficient than the corresponding fragments in BoNT/A and
BoNT/B. X-HC is functional for targeting cells, as its presence
enhanced cleavage of VAMP2 in neurons over LC-HN alone
(Fig. 4c). When present without the translocation and LC
domains, X-HC is prone to aggregation. This solubility issue is
likely due to separation of X-HC from X-LC-HN, as full-length
BoNT/XRY remains stable at high concentrations. The X-FL
generated by sortase-mediated ligation has a rather low toxicity
in vivo in mice. It remains unknown whether this low in vivo
toxicity was intrinsic to BoNT/X. It is also possible that the
sortase linking method resulted in an attenuated toxin, as the HC
and LC-HN folded separately and there is an additional linker
between the HN and HC in ligated toxins. Nevertheless, X-FL
produced by sortase-mediated ligation is active on neurons and
induced typical flaccid paralysis when injected locally in mice,
demonstrating that BoNT/X is a functional toxin (Fig. 4f). It will
be necessary to produce native BoNT/X to characterize its in vivo
potency and determine its biosafety risk. It will be important to
generate neutralizing antisera against BoNT/X before producing
any native toxin.
Introducing a full-length active toxin gene into any expression
system/organism is always a significant biosafety concern.
Sortase-mediated ligation assembles a small quantity of full-
length toxin from two complementary and non-toxic fragments
expressed and purified individually. The amount of the precursor
fragments in the reaction can be strictly controlled, so the amount
of ligated toxin is precisely limited to ensure biosafety. The ligated
toxin should possess the same mode of action as native toxins, but
may exhibit lower toxicity in vivo, possibly due to the addition of
the sortase linker and/or reduced compactness of the molecule.
Thus, the ligated toxin could be used for functional studies, but
may not be suitable for estimating the lethal dose of native toxin.
On the other hand, this reduced toxicity from the sortase linking
method could be an advantage to create attenuated toxins for
research use. It might be also possible to deliberately attenuate the
toxicity of ligated toxins in vivo by including additional linkers,
such as peptide sequences that are sensitive to serum proteases,
to further mitigate biosafety concerns.

fragments. Ykt6 fragment (residues 1–192) was also cloned into pGEX4T and
expressed as GST-tagged proteins. The construct encoding His6-tagged sortase
(SrtA*) was generously provided by B. Pentelute (Boston, MA, USA)43.
Bioinformatics. The Uniprot database was searched with Jackhmmer on the
HMMER web server, using a BoNT/A1 sequence as the seed (Uniprot accession
number A5HZZ9) until convergence. Returned sequences were aligned with
Clustal Omega and a NeighborNet phylogenetic network estimated with SplitsTree.
Protein purification. E. coli BL21 (DE3) was utilized for protein expression.
In general, induction of expression was carried out with 0.1 mM IPTG at 22 �C
overnight. Bacterial pellets were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl) by sonication, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation
at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 �C. Protein purification was carried out using AKTA
Prime FPLC system (GE), and purified proteins were further desalted with a PD-10
column (GE, 17-0851-01).
Large-scale production and purification of BoNT/XRY. cDNA encoding
BoNT/XRY was assembled in-house from mutated X-LC (R360A/Y363F), X-HN
and X-HC. It was cloned into a pET22b vector, with the His6-tag on its C terminus.
The corresponding plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cultures for
expression were first grown using a LEX Bioreactor (Epiphyte3, Ontario, Canada)
at 37 �C in 1.5 l of medium until OD600 reached 0.8. The temperature was then
reduced to 18 �C for induction of expression with 1 mM IPTG, and grown for
16–17 h. Bacteria were harvested, re-suspended in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES
pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP), and lysed with
an Emulsiflex-C3 (Avestin, Mannheim, Germany) at 20,000 p.s.i. Lysates were
ultra-centrifuged at 200,000 g for 45 min. Supernatant was loaded onto a 15 ml
Ni-NTA agarose column and washed with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.2,
500 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Proteins were eluted
with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 5%
glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) and then dialyzed overnight in 50 mM HEPES, 500 mM
NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP. Dialysate was concentrated using a Vivaspin
concentrator before being loaded on a Superdex200-16/60 column pre-equilibrated
in the same buffer used for dialysis. Elution peak corresponding to BoNT/X was
collected and concentrated to B10 mg ml � 1. Sample was aliquoted and flash-
frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at � 80 �C.
Cleavage of SNARE proteins in rat BDE. Rat brain was homogenized in 15 ml
320 mM sucrose buffer, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 r.p.m. for 2 min at 4 �C.
Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 11,000 r.p.m. for 12 min. The pellet
was collected and solubilized for 30 min in 15 ml Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mM
Tris, 150 mM NaCl) plus 2% of Triton X-100 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors
(Roche, CA). Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 17,000 r.p.m. for 20 min to
remove insoluble materials. The final BDE concentration was B2 mg ml � 1.
BDE (60 ml) were incubated with X-LC (0.5 mM), A-LC (1 mM), or B-LC (1 mM),
for 1 h at 37 �C, and then analysed by immunoblot using the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Pierce). As controls, LCs were pre-incubated
with 20 mM EDTA for 20 min at room temperature before adding to BDE.
Full-blot scans are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Cleavage of recombinant VAMPs by X-LC. VAMP2 (1–93) was expressed and
purified as a His6-tagged protein. VAMP2 (33–86), VAMP4 (1–115), VAMP5
(1–70) and Ykt6 (1–192) were expressed and purified as GST-tagged proteins.
These proteins (0.3 mg ml � 1) were incubated with 0.1 mM X-LC in TBS buffer at
37 �C. Samples were either analysed by SDS–PAGE gels and Coomassie Blue
staining, or subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.
Cleavage of VAMPs in cell lysates: Full-length HA-tagged VAMP1, 3, 7, 8 and
Myc-tagged Sec22b, and Ykt6 were transfected into 293T cells using PolyJet
transfection reagents (SignaGen, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell lysates were harvested 48 h later in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 1% NP40,
150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 400 ml per 10-cm dish) plus a

 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lysates (250 ml) were incubated
with X-LC (0.5 mM) for 1 h at 37 �C. Samples were then analysed by immunoblot.
Identification of cleavage sites in VAMPs by LC–MS/MS. Samples were
analysed at Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Core Facility at Harvard Medical
School. For VAMP2, whole-protein samples were loaded onto a 100 mm internal
diameter C18 reverse-phase HPLC column packed with 3 cm of beads off-line
using a pressure cell. The column was re-attached to an Accela 600 Pump (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). A rapid gradient of increasing acetonitrile was used to elute the
protein/peptide from the HPLC column. As peptides eluted, they were subjected to
electrospray ionization and then placed into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap
mass spectrometer to acquire a high-resolution FTMS scan at 60,000 resolution,
a second scan at low resolution in the ion trap, and a final scan to perform
data-dependent MS/MS. The charge state envelopes were de-convoluted manually
to obtain mono-isotopic masses when possible or average masses for the proteins.
Peptide and protein identity were determined by matching protein databases with
the acquired fragmentation pattern using the software program Sequest (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). All databases include a reversed version of all the sequences, and
the data were filtered to 1–2% peptide false-discovery rate.
For Ykt6, VAMP4 and VAMP5, samples were first separated on SDS–PAGE.
Protein bands were excised and cut into B1 mm3 pieces. Gel pieces were incubated
with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng ml � 1 modified
sequencing-grade chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were digested
overnight at room temperature. Peptides were then extracted and separated with
reverse-phase HPLC. As peptides were eluted, they were subjected to electrospray
ionization and transferred into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted peptides were detected, isolated
and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for
each peptide.
Identification of the protease cleavage site between LC and HN. His6-tagged
recombinant X-LC-HN fragment (residues 1–891) was purified in E. coli and
subjected to limited proteolysis by endoproteinase Lys-C (Sigma P2289, 100:1
(toxin:Lys-C) molar ratio, 25 min at room temperature). The cleavage site was
determined by TMT labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, intact X-LC-
HN samples were labelled with the light TMT, and equal amounts of X-LC-HN
samples treated with Lys-C were labelled with the heavy TMT. Both samples were
then digested with chymotrypsin, combined and subjected to quantitative mass
spectrometry analysis.
Cysteine alkylation by NEM. Lys-C-activated X-LC-HN fragment was diluted into
sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.5) at a final concentration of 0.3 mg ml � 1,
with or without NEM at indicated concentrations (20, 10 and 5 mM) and incubated
for 10 min at room temperature. NEM was freshly prepared in sodium phosphate
buffer. Samples were mixed with 3 � neutral loading dye (200 mM Tris pH 6.8,
30% glycerol, 6% Lithium Dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM NEM, and 0.06% BPB) at room
temperature for 10 min, heated for 10 min at 55 �C, and then analysed by
SDS–PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.
Neuron culture and immunoblot analysis. Primary rat cortical neurons were
prepared from E18-19 embryos using a papain dissociation kit (Worthington
Biochemical) following the manufacturer’s instruction57. Neurons were exposed to
either BoNT/X fragments or sortase ligation mixtures in culture medium for 12 h.
Cells were then lysed with RIPA buffer plus a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed using
a microcentrifuge at 4 �C. Supernatants were subjected to SDS–PAGE and
immunoblot analysis.
Dot blot. BoNTs (0.2 mg in 1 ml) were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes
and dried (10 min at RT). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST
(TBS plus 0.05% Tween20) for 30 min and then incubated with appropriate
antisera (1:500 dilution) for 30 min. The membranes were then washed three
times with TBST and incubated with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 30 min, washed three more times with TBST, and
analysed by the ECL method. The BoNT/X sample was composed of X-LC-HN and
GST-X-HC at 1:1 molar ratio.
Sortase-mediated ligation. GST-X-HC or GST-A-HC was cleaved overnight at
4 �C by thrombin before being added into the ligation reaction mixture. Ligation
reaction was set up in 50 ml TBS buffer with X-LC-HN (8 mM), X-HC (4 mM) or
A-HC (25 mM), Ca2 þ (10 mM) and sortase (10 mM), for 40 min at room
temperature.
DAS assay. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Boston
Children’s Hospital (#3030). Briefly, X-FL generated by sortase-mediated ligation
was first activated with limited proteolysis using trypsin (60:1 (toxin:trypsin) molar
ratio, 30 min at room temperature). We chose trypsin instead of Lys-C here,
as it allows us to stop proteolysis by adding trypsin inhibitors (Soybean trypsin
inhibitor, 1:10 ratio (trypsin:trypsin inhibitor). Mice (CD-1 strain, male, purchased
from Charles River, 5–6 weeks old, 21–25 g, n ¼ 4) were anesthetized with
isoflurane (3–4%) and injected with X-FL (0.5 mg) using a 30-gauge needle attached
to a sterile Hamilton syringe, into the gastrocnemius muscles of the right hind
limb. Muscle paralysis and the spread of hind paw in response to a startle stimulus
were observed 12 h after injection as previously described44.
Biosafety and biosecurity. All procedures were approved by the Institute of
Biosafety Committees at Boston Children’s Hospital and at Stockholm University.
To ensure biosafety and biosecurity, no active full-length toxin gene was produced
in any form. The amount of sortase linking reaction is strictly controlled to
ensure that only a minimal amount of ligated toxins was produced, which was
immediately utilized for functional studies. The loss of toxicity of BoNT/XRY and
reduced toxicity of sortase-linked X-FL were confirmed using the mouse lethality
assay. Inactive BoNT/XRY was prepared and is available for developing neutralizing
antibodies.
