SUMMARY
Antibiotics, though remarkably useful, can also
cause certain adverse effects. We detected that
treatment of adult mice with antibiotics decreases
hippocampal neurogenesis and memory retention.
Reconstitution with normal gut flora (SPF) did not
completely reverse the deficits in neurogenesis un-
less the mice also had access to a running wheel or
received probiotics. In parallel to an increase in neu-
rogenesis and memory retention, both SPF-reconsti-
tuted mice that ran and mice supplemented with
probiotics exhibited higher numbers of Ly6Chi mono-
cytes in the brain than antibiotic-treated mice. Elimi-
nation of Ly6Chi monocytes by antibody depletion or
the use of knockout mice resulted in decreased neu-
rogenesis, whereas adoptive transfer of Ly6Chi
monocytes rescued neurogenesis after antibiotic
treatment. We propose that the rescue of neurogen-
esis and behavior deficits in antibiotic-treated mice
by exercise and probiotics is partially mediated by
Ly6Chi monocytes.
INTRODUCTION
Antibiotics (Abxs) are applied by millions of people and billions of
farm animals worldwide every day. Although their use has saved
countless lives, Abxs also can negatively impact the physiology
and psychology of the patients (Bercik and Collins, 2014; Mos-
tafa and Miller, 2014). Some of these changes have been
ascribed to the impact of Abxs on the gut-brain axis, as the mi-
crobiota colonizing the intestinal lumen are thought to affect their
host’s vegetative and cognitive functions (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011;
Mayer, 2011). Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that
the microbiota-brain relationship plays a crucial role in the devel-
opment of metabolic and mental diseases (Bested et al., 2013).
The lifelong production of new neurons in the subgranular
zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus is a
cell-based process of neuronal plasticity in adult mammals
(Kempermann et al., 2008). Previous studies have shown that
adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in rodents (Altman
and Das, 1965; Cameron et al., 1993; Kaplan and Bell, 1983,
1984; Kaplan and Hinds, 1977; Kempermann et al., 1997;
Kuhn et al., 1996; Seki and Arai, 1993), non-human primates
(Gould et al., 2001; Kornack and Rakic, 1999), and humans
(Eriksson et al., 1998; Spalding et al., 2013). Adult neurogenesis
has been linked to hippocampus-dependent cognitive function
(Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2010), and it is
required for memory resolution and for proper pattern separation
in the DG of the hippocampus (Aimone et al., 2011; Jessberger
et al., 2008; Sahay et al., 2011; Stringer et al., 2015). The hippo-
campus has long been studied for its critical involvement in many
mental diseases (Bloom, 1975; Holsboer, 1988).
Decreases in hippocampal neurogenesis can be induced by
lack of maternal care (Mirescu et al., 2004) or social isolation
(Lu et al., 2003), both paradigms leading to behavioral aber-
rances. It was reported that chronic stress (Pham et al., 2003)
and alcohol (Nixon and Crews, 2002) have a negative impact
on hippocampal neurogenesis (Schoenfeld and Gould, 2013)
and also lead to mental disorders, such as major depression,
posttraumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease (Jacobs
et al., 2000; Reif et al., 2007; Sahay and Hen, 2007; Santarelli
et al., 2003). In all three disorders, clinical evidence suggests
that the individual level of overall activity, either physical or
cognitive, partly counteracts the impairment (Daley, 2008; Pa-
jonk et al., 2010; Sagatun et al., 2007; Scarmeas et al., 2009;
Wilson et al., 2002). These findings provide indirect evidence
that, in humans, activity can improve neurogenesis comparable
to the effects of a voluntary exercise or an enriched environment
in rodents (Kempermann et al., 1997; van Praag et al., 1999).

(A) The first panel shows representative micrographs of the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus. Proliferating cells labeled with
BrdU (red) arise in the SGZ of the DG, mature, and integrate into the granular cell layer labeled with NeuN (blue). Doublecortin (Dcx, green) is a marker for mitotic
neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and NeuN (blue) is a marker for mature neurons (*cell expressing BrdU and NeuN and #cell expressing BrdU/NeuN and Dcx).

 Indeed, it has been shown that physical exercise can increase
hippocampal volume in schizophrenic patients (Pajonk et al.,
2010) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a rodent model
of schizophrenia (Wolf et al., 2011). Whether and how the gut mi-
crobiota can impact the process of neurogenesis are not yet
known.
Here we studied Abx-treated adult C57BL/6 mice to investi-
gate the impact of gut flora dysbiosis on hippocampal neurogen-
esis. In our study we included voluntary exercise and treatment
with probiotics to counteract antibiosis.
Intestinal microbiota are able to influence the number, migra-
tion, and functions of certain immune cell subsets (Dorrestein
et al., 2014), and thus they modulate immune responses at
mucosal surfaces during infection, inflammation, and autoimmu-
nity (Kamada et al., 2013; Round and Mazmanian, 2009). Gut
microbes also can regulate the immune response in other organ
systems as reported in animal models for diabetes and rheuma-
toid arthritis (Markle et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2010). Growing evi-
dence suggests that gut microbial composition may direct the
character and level of an immune response in the brain (Berer
et al., 2011). Very recently it was shown that gut microbiota
shape the maturation and function of microglia, the intrinsic im-
mune cells of the CNS (Erny et al., 2015). Moreover, a link among
neuropsychiatric disorders, neuroinflammatory components,
and gut microbiota dysregulation was discussed (Petra et al.,
2015). One way to balance gut microbiota composition is to
administer probiotic treatment (for review see Sanders, 2011).
Here we used VSL#3, which is a mixture of eight different strains
of bacteria. In the clinical setting, studies have confirmed that
VSL#3 is effective in reducing inflammation and symptom
severity (Kim et al., 2015; Mimura et al., 2004). VSL#3 administra-
tion to mice rendered the inflammatory response in colitis and a
pain model (Dai et al., 2013; Reiff et al., 2009). Moreover, appli-
cation of VSL#3 modulated the expression of a large group of
genes in brain tissue, and it attenuated an age-related deficit in
long-term potentiation in aged rats (Distrutti et al., 2014) and
sickness behavior development in mice (D’Mello et al., 2015).
While the crosstalk between peripheral immune cells and the
CNS has been established over the past decade (Schwartz
et al., 2013; Schwartz and Shechter, 2010), it is unclear whether
the gut microbiota can shape the maintenance of the peripheral
immune system in the steady state. The selective gateway for
leukocyte entry to the CNS is the choroid plexus, which mediates
important neuro-immunological processes also under steady-
state conditions (Baruch and Schwartz, 2013). Among other
groups, we have proved previously that T cells are required to
maintain neurogenesis (Wolf et al., 2009; Ziv et al., 2006). Here
we focused on the potential of monocytes to serve as a
messenger between gut and brain and to shape adult hippo-
campal neurogenesis. Monocytes are a fundamental leukocyte
subset of the innate immune system, and they contribute to
the immune surveillance and host defense upon infections and
inflammation (Biswas et al., 2015; Dunay et al., 2008; Shi and
Pamer, 2011). However, they also can promote disease progres-
sion in certain disorders (Hammond et al., 2014; Karlmark et al.,
2012; Schumak et al., 2015). How monocytes are affected by
Abx-induced dysbiosis of the gut flora and subsequently shape
neurogenesis is the focus of this study.
RESULTS
Abx Treatment Decreases Adult Hippocampal
Neurogenesis
We started by treating adult animals with broad-spectrum Abxs
for 7 weeks. In a previous study we have shown that application
of these Abxs severely depleted the intestinal microbiota of mice
(Heimesaat et al., 2006). To determine the phenotype of the
proliferating cells in the hippocampus, we stained with anti-
bodies against NeuN (which labels mature neurons) and double-
cortin (Dcx, which labels the majority of transient proliferating
mitotic neuronal progenitor cells [NPCs]; Figures 1A and 1B).
The progenitor cells expressing Dcx represent the most plastic
population of progenitors. Moreover, the commitment to the
neuronal lineage starts with the expression of Dcx (Kempermann
et al., 2004, 2015). We analyzed hippocampal sections by immu-
nofluorescence and detected that the number of BrdU-positive
cells in the SGZ of the DG was significantly lower in the brains
of Abx-treated animals (387 ± 60; Figure 1C, light blue bar)
compared to naive ones (592 ± 48; Figure 1C, light gray bar).
This
effect
was
apparent
in
both
neuronal
progenitors
(BrdU/Dcx/NeuN) and mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN). These
data suggest that Abx treatment has a long-lasting effect on
neurogenesis.
Voluntary Exercise Rescues Neurogenesis Levels
Despite Antibiosis
To test whether exercise enhances neurogenesis in Abx-treated
mice, we supplied the mice with running wheels for 10 days dur-
ing the treatment, injected BrdU for the last 3 days with running
wheels, and assayed neurogenesis 4 weeks later. Mice volun-
tarily ran �0.28 ± 0.05 km/day (6 p.m. to 8 a.m.) across all
groups. Figure 1C shows that access to running wheels
(running +) significantly increased neurogenesis by 44% in naive
specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and by far less (28%) in Abx-
treated animals. In Abx-treated mice that had received a fecal
transplant, neurogenesis was increased by 47%, equivalent to
its effect on control mice. Ten days of running did not change
the composition of the gut flora in naive SPF mice, Abx-treated
mice, or Abx mice that received an SPF fecal transplant (Figures
S1A and S1B). We show representative images of the BrdU,
the significant differences compared to the Abx-treated group revealed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test (n = 10 per group; three independent experiments; two-way
ANOVA, Bonferroni’s post hoc test, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001; F(5,576) = 185.67).
(D) The total numbers of BrdU-positive cells and NPCs (BrdU/Dxc/NeuN) and the resulting mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN) normalized after probiotic treatment are
shown (n = 10 per group; two independent experiments; two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, ***p < 0.001; F(3, 304) = 164.25).
(E) The total amount of colony-forming units (CFUs) in samples derived from feces of Abx-treated mice after probiotic treatment is significantly higher compared
to SPF naive mice treated with probiotics (one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test,***p < 0.001; F(3,63) = 35.81). Please refer to Figure S1 for the analysis of fecal
samples of the other groups.

 NeuN, and Dxc staining from the naive SPF animals with access
to a running wheel versus the mice treated with Abxs to give an
overview of the two extremes of the spectrum for BrdU cell
numbers detectable per hippocampal section (Figure S2).
Probiotics Fully Restore Neurogenesis
To see if reconstitution with a complex gut flora rescues neuro-
genesis, we gave a fecal transplant from untreated SPF mice
2 days after the final Abx treatment. Then 7 days later, we in-
jected BrdU on 3 consecutive days, and we analyzed hippocam-
pal neurogenesis 4 weeks later. Figure 1C shows that the fecal
transplant (Abx + SPF transplant versus Abx treated: 265 ±
114 versus 223 ± 109) had little effect on hippocampal neurogen-
esis, even though it seemed to normalize the overall species dis-
tribution of the gut flora (Figure S1A). These results indicate that
treatment with Abxs impairs adult neurogenesis and that recon-
stitution with normal intestinal flora does not promote regenera-
tion. When mice received probiotics instead of a fecal transplant
2 and 4 days after we discontinued the Abx treatment, we were
able to fully restore neurogenesis to the control level (probiotics
versus SPF naive: 652 ± 143 versus 607 ± 133; Figure 1D). Pro-
biotic treatment of naive SPF mice did not increase neurogenesis
levels above baseline. The total amount of colony-forming units
(CFUs) in samples derived from feces of Abx-treated mice after
probiotic treatment is even higher compared to naive SPF
mice treated with probiotics, confirming a successful recoloniza-
tion of probiotics within the gut of Abx-treated mice (Figure 1E).
Of note, exercise and probiotic treatment rescued the number of
progenitor cells at a late maturation stage (BrdU/Dcx/NeuN) and
mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN) within the analysis time window
of 4 weeks. Additionally, wheel running had a measurable effect
on the younger NeuNneg progenitor cell population. This is
consistent with the known robust effect of exercise on progenitor
cell proliferation (Fabel et al., 2009). Probiotic treatment seems
to have less impact on proliferation and predominantly promotes
the survival of progenitor cells.
Probiotic Treatment and Exercise Rescue the
Behavioral Deficits of Abx-Treated Mice in a Novel
Object Recognition Test
It was shown by Jessberger et al. (2009) that the DG-specific
knockdown of adult neurogenesis impairs spatial and object
recognition memory in adult rats. Here we adapted the protocol
for mice. For the 1-min delay interval, all groups performed
above chance and there were no group differences. This indi-
cates that all of the groups exhibited substantial memory reten-
tion at the 1-min delay (Figure 2B). For the 3-hr delay interval, the
Abx-treated group (55% ± 4%) and the Abx + SPF transplant
group (58% ± 6%) failed to perform as well as the naive SPF
group (69% ± 4%, p < 0.05). The Abx + running (74% ± 6%)
and Abx + probiotics (72% ± 5%) groups performed similarly
to the naive SPF group, and all groups performed above chance.
However, there was no effect of voluntary exercise (72% ± 7%)
or probiotics (68% ± 5%) on the naive SPF group. Both groups
performed better than chance levels and on a similar level to
the naive SPF group. This is in line with findings where an in-
crease of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, induced by genetic
expansion of adult-born neurons, above baseline control levels
shows normal object recognition and spatial learning (Sahay
et al., 2011). Thus, probiotics and voluntary exercise are potent
interventions to rescue the impaired performance of the Abx-
treated mice, but they do not enhance the baseline control level.
The rescue of the hippocampus-dependent behavior in the Abx
mice by voluntary exercise and probiotics corresponds to the
neurogenesis levels, which were returned to normal by the
same interventions (Figure 1C).
Ly6Chi Monocytes Provide a Missing Link among Brain,
Gut, and Treatment Paradigms
Although it is well known that there are neural associations
between the gut and the brain (Mayer, 2011), there is also
evidence that the innate immune system may serve as an addi-
tional link. Previous studies have indicated that cells of the im-
mune system help to maintain neurogenesis (Wolf et al., 2009;
Ziv et al., 2006), can be influenced by Abxs (Morgun et al.,
2015), and can respond to exercise (Shantsila et al., 2012).
Therefore, we asked whether innate immune cells in the brain
may act as a link among the brain, gut, and exercise. Analyzing
the infiltrating immune cell populations in single-cell prepara-
tions from one brain hemisphere of Abx-treated mice (Fig-
ure 3A), we detected that the proportions of Ly6Chi monocytes
had significantly decreased compared to the naive SPF group
(0.16% ± 0.05% versus 0.26% ± 0.1%; Figure 3B). The
decrease in Ly6Chi cells also was evident in bone marrow

with the novel object within a total of 1 min of
contact with both objects. For the 1-min delay in-
terval, all groups performed above chance and
there were no group differences. For the 3-hr delay
interval, the Abx-treated group and the Abx + SPF
transplant group failed to perform as well as SPF naive (n = 12 per group; one-way ANOVA; F(7,84) = 27.95 p < 0.001). The Abx + run and Abx + probiotics
performed similarly like the SPF naive group, and all groups performed above chance. However, there was no effect of voluntary exercise or probiotics when
applied to the SPF naive group.

 and blood 1 week after Abx treatment but normalized 4 weeks
later (Figures S3A–S3F).
We further tested the impact of fecal and probiotic reconstitu-
tion and exercise on the population of Ly6Chi monocytes in the
brain. We detected that reconstitution with SPF gut flora did
not reverse the drop in brain-infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes, point-
ing toward a long-lasting effect of Abxs on brain homeostasis
(0.14% ± 0.02%; Figure 3B, light brown bar). However, access
to running wheels (0.27% ± 0.06%) and probiotic treatment
(0.46% ± 0.15%) significantly elevated the Ly6Chi monocyte pro-
portions in the brain (Figure 3B). Similar trends as in Ly6Chi
monocytes could be seen in the myeloid population (Figure 3C).
In comparison, the number of the intrinsic microglia population
was not changed in any of the conditions (Figure 3D). Thus, neu-
rogenesis rescue by running or probiotic treatment, as depicted
in Figures 1C and 1D, was paralleled by an increase in the brain’s
CD11bposCD45hiLy6GnegLy6Chi monocyte population, while the
number of the brain’s intrinsic CD11bposCD45int population was
unchanged. To visualize the location of the Ly6Chi monocytes,
we utilized reporters for Ccr2 (red fluorescent protein [RFP])
and Cx3cr1 (EGFP). CCR2 has a substantial overlap with the
Ly6Chi population and labels infiltrating monocytes (Biswas
et al., 2015; Quintar et al., 2015). We detected CCR2+ cells in
the choroid plexus, as shown in the representative images (Fig-
ure 3E00). In our previous study, we located CCR2+Ly6Chi cells in
the inflamed brain parenchyma of mice infected with the neuro-
tropic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In the current sudy in the
non-infected brain, we could observe only few CCR2+ cells in
the hippocampus (Figure 3E000). Due to the low number of im-
mune cells in the brain parenchyma, we decided to use flow
cytometric analysis of one hemisphere for quantification.
Lack of Monocytes Decreases Neurogenesis
To determine whether the influx of Ly6Chi monocytes was a
cause, effect, or simply correlated with the rate of hippocampal
neurogenesis, we used the following three different strategies to

significant decrease in Ly6Chi monocytes in the
brains of Abx-treated mice compared to the SPF
naive group (n = 38 from five independent experi-
ments; unpaired two-tailed t test; t(31) = 3.884, p =
0.0005). The SPF fecal transplant did not rescue the
Ly6Chi numbers in the brains of Abx-treated mice
(Abx treated versus Abx + SPF transplant: n = 25
from three independent experiments; t(22) = 1.17, p =
0.25). Access to a running wheel brought brain
Ly6Chi numbers back to control level (SPF naive
versus Abx + running: n = 31 from three independent
experiments; t(29) = 0.11, p = 0.9), while running
increased Ly6Chi numbers in brains of SPF naive
mice (n = 27 from two independent experiments;
t(25) = 3.57, p = 0.0015). Probiotic treatment of Abx
mice increased the brain Ly6Chi numbers even
above SPF naive levels (n = 29 from two independent
experiments; t(27) = 3.99, p = 0.0005), while it had no
effect in SPF naive mice per se (n = 29 from two in-
dependent experiments; t(24) = 0.077, p = 0.94). (C) In
the myeloid population similar trends are visible, and the effects of exercise in the SPF naive group and probiotics in the Abx-treated group were significant
(p < 0.05). (D) There was no change detectable in the resident microglia population.

 alter monocyte numbers: genetic depletion, antibody depletion,
and adoptive transfer. In the first case, we used Ccr2-deficient
(Ccr2�/�) mice, in which the lack of the chemokine receptor
CCR2 deters Ly6Chi monocytes from exiting the bone marrow,
consequently reducing their number in the periphery (Figure S4;
Serbina and Pamer, 2006). Figure 4A shows that mice lacking
Ccr2 exhibited significantly decreased levels of neurogenesis
(488 ± 134 BrdU+ cells) when compared to wild-type mice
(1,014 ± 83), as well as a 40% drop in Ly6Chi monocytes in their
brains (Figure 4B). Since Ccr2 is absent throughout development
in Ccr2-deficient mice and may affect brain development from
the early ages, we utilized a second model in which we targeted
Ly6Chi monocytes in adult mice using the anti-CCR2 monoclonal
antibody MC-21, which specifically ablated Ly6Chi monocytes in
the brain (Figure 4D). One day after the first antibody treatment,
we injected BrdU and 3 weeks later evaluated the effect on neu-
rogenesis. Treatment of naive SPF mice with MC-21 (Figure 4C)
led to a 25% decrease in total BrdU-positive cells (1,111 ± 32)
when compared to IgG-treated controls (1,496 ± 119). The
depletion of another myeloid-derived mononuclear cell subset,
namely Ly6Gpos neutrophils, with the specific monoclonal anti-
body 1A8 did not alter the number of Ly6Chi monocytes in the
brain (Figure 4D) or modify neurogenesis levels (Figure 4C).
Together, these two depletion studies suggest that CCR2pos
cells, particularly Ly6Chi monocytes, are necessary for neuro-
genesis in the adult brain.
Adoptive Transfer of Ly6Chi Monocytes Rescues
Neurogenesis in Abx-Treated Mice
To resolve whether the transfer of Ly6Chi monocytes can rescue
neurogenesis in Abx-treated mice, we intravenously injected 106
CD11bpos Ly6Chi monocytes sorted from the bone marrow into
Abx-treated mice at days 2 and 7 after discontinuing the Abx
treatment. Next we injected BrdU for 3 consecutive days starting
24 hr after the first cell transfer, and we analyzed the numbers of
Ly6Chi monocytes and proliferating neuronal precursor cells
3 weeks after the BrdU injections. Figure 4F displays that the
adoptive transfer of Ly6Chi monocytes led to a doubling of the
proportion of Ly6Chi monocytes in the brains and completely
restored neurogenesis in Abx-treated mice (Abx treated versus
Abx + monocytes Ly6Chi: 648 ± 84 versus 1,381 ± 149; Fig-
ure 5E). Naive SPF mice that received Ly6Chi monocytes showed
neither an increase in Ly6Chi monocytes in the brain (Figure 4F)
nor a change in neurogenesis (Figure 4E). These results confirm
that Ly6Chi monocytes are important messengers and they

periphery

Ly6Chi Monocytes Promote Sphere Formation of NPCs
In Vitro
To determine if the Ly6Chi monocytes could have a direct effect
on neurogenesis, we co-cultured various numbers of bone
marrow-derived
CD11bposLy6Chi
monocytes
with
primary
NPCs derived from the hippocampi of postnatal day (P)16
C57BL/6 mice. Due to the trans-well system, NPCs and Ly6Chi
monocytes could not interact via direct cell-cell contact. Figure 5
displays that, at a ratio of one Ly6Chi monocyte per 1,000 NPCs,
the Ly6Chi monocytes significantly increased sphere formation
(96 ± 5.6) compared to medium alone (64 ± 8.9), whereas the
addition of CD11bposLy6Cneg cells at the same ratios did not
change sphere formation or even decreased the number of
spheres (25 ± 6). Thus, it appears that CD11bposLy6Chi mono-
cytes can support primary NPCs to enhance neurogenesis via
soluble factors.
DISCUSSION
Here we examined the complex interaction among Abx treat-
ment, gut microbiota, and the brain’s NPC pool. Colonization
with probiotics, as well as voluntary exercise, rescued neurogen-
esis in Abx-treated mice. Previous studies have shown that pro-
biotics also were able to rescue neurogenesis in a murine model
of stress (Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2014). Voluntary exercise is a
widely used strategy that was applied by us and others to in-
crease neurogenesis in various disease models including endo-
phenotypes of psychiatric disorders (Kempermann et al., 2010;
van Praag et al., 2014; Wolf et al., 2011). Here we demonstrate
that both treatment paradigms were accompanied by an in-
crease in Ly6Chi monocytes in the brain. Lack of the monocyte
cell population, either by antibody treatment or in Ccr2 knockout
mice, led to a decrease in neurogenesis, while adoptive transfer
of Ly6Chi monocytes rescued neurogenesis in Abx-treated
mice. This observation was compelling, as disparate effects of
Ly6ChiCCR2pos monocytes on brain-related functions were
reported previously (Gordon and Taylor, 2005). Bone marrow-
derived Ly6ChiCCR2pos monocytes are essential for recovery af-
ter spinal cord injury (Shechter and Schwartz, 2013), and they are
involved in restricting cerebral amyloidosis in patients with Alz-
heimer’s disease (Baruch et al., 2016; Naert and Rivest, 2013).
In contrast, these cells also serve as key mediators of inflamma-
tion and pathology upon chronic cerebral infection, stroke, and
other diseases (Biswas et al., 2015; Hammond et al., 2014; Karl-
mark et al., 2012). Thus, as it has been reported for T cells
(Schwartz et al., 1999), Ly6Chi monocytes can perform complex
sets of beneficial as well as detrimental functions in the CNS.
The impact of Abxs on neurogenesis was not rescued by the
SPF fecal transplant, which implicates a direct effect of Abxs
on the host. Indeed, it was shown previously that changes in
gene expression in the gut of Abx-treated mice were driven by
at least two factors: depletion of the microbiota and direct effects
of Abxs on host tissues (Bercik and Collins, 2014). Direct effects
of Abx treatment were demonstrated in our previous study
showing that Abxs can even influence host mitochondria, which
retain many features of the bacteria from which they descended
(Morgun et al., 2015). Abx treatment as well as probiotic treat-
ment could have a direct effect on cell metabolism of all body
cells, including neuronal stem cells and neuronal precursors.
Although antibiosis can possibly have a direct effect on neuro-
genesis, we bypassed the Abx effect by an adoptive transfer of
Ly6Chi monocytes into Abx-treated animals. Moreover, under
Abx treatment, voluntary exercise alone was able to counteract
the lack of a complex gut flora and partially restore neurogene-
sis. This led us to the conclusion that not exclusively the lack
of gut flora determines neurogenesis levels, and additional fac-
tors also play an important role. Therefore, we hypothesized
the presence of a common mediator, which signals from the

Figure 4. Genetic Absence or Antibody-Induced Loss
of CCR2+ Ly6Chi Monocytes Results in Decreased Neu-
rogenesis, while Transfer of Ly6Chi Monocytes into
Abx-Treated Animals Rescues Neurogenesis
(A and B) Adult female Ccr2+/�, Ccr2�/�, and wild-type litter-
mates were injected with BrdU i.p. Four weeks later (A), neu-
rogenesis was evaluated by phenotyping BrdU+ cells with Dcx
and NeuN as described in Figure 1 (one-way ANOVA, Bonfer-
roni post hoc test, ***p < 0.001; F(2,84) = 193.74). (B) The
decrease of Ly6Chi monocytes as a proportion of CD11b+
cells in the brains of Ccr2�/� animals compared to wild-type
littermates was measured using the gating strategy displayed
in Figure 3 (n = 8 animals/group; unpaired two-way t test,
p = 0.046).
(C and D) Adult C57BL/6 females were injected with an anti-
CCR2 antibody (MC-21) to deplete Ly6Chi monocytes or an
anti-Ly6G antibody (1A8) to deplete neutrophils. (C) One day
after the initial injection of the depleting antibody, they received
BrdU; 4 weeks later, neurogenesis was evaluated by pheno-
typing BrdU+ cells with Dcx and NeuN. BrdU+ cells decreased
in the brains of the mice treated with MC-21 compared to IgG
and 1A8 controls (n = 6 animals/group; one-way ANOVA,
Bonferroni post hoc, ***p < 0.001 and *p < 0.05; F(2,60) = 59.97).
(D) Ly6Chi monocytes decreased in the brains of mice treated
with the MC-21 antibody compared to IgG and 1A8 controls
(n = 6 animals/group; one-way ANOVA, p < 0.03; F(2,17) = 4.44;
Bonferroni post hoc MC-21 versus IgG, *p < 0.05).
(E and F) Abx-treated mice were injected with freshly isolated
FACS-sorted Ly6Chi monocytes from the bone marrow. We
repeated the adoptive transfer twice, five days apart, and
labeled proliferating cells by BrdU injection 1 day after the first
transfer. (E) Similar to the experiments shown in Figure 1,
neurogenesis was decreased in Abx-treated mice compared to
SPF naive mice (n = 6–8 per group; two independent experi-
ments; two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, **p < 0.001;
F(3,68) = 31.10). Transfer of Ly6Chi monocytes returned neuro-
genesis levels of Abx-treated mice back to normal (SPF naive
versus Abx + Ly6Chi, Bonferroni post hoc, p > 0.05). (F) While
the Ly6Chi monocytes in the brains of Abx mice decreased
significantly compared to SPF naive, there was no difference
between Abx mice that received Ly6Chi monocytes and SPF
naive animals. Transfer of Ly6Chi monocytes into SPF naive
animals did not change the number of Ly6Chi monocytes in
the brains (n = 5–7 animals/group; two independent experi-
ments; unpaired two-way t test, SPF naive versus Abx treated:
p = 0.049, SPF naive versus Abx treated + Ly6Chi p = 0.95, and
SPF naive versus SPF + Ly6Chi: p = 0.18).

 periphery to the brain, and that this messenger is affected by
antibiosis and can be restored by exercise and probiotic
treatment. Based on our data from the depletion and in vitro ex-
periments, we propose that Ly6Chi monocytes serve as a link be-
tween the gut and the brain, contributing to the modulation of
neurogenesis in health and disease.
The host microbiota maintain systemic populations of myeloid
cells in circulation by modulating hematopoietic stem cell and
myeloid precursors in the bone marrow (Deshmukh et al.,
2014). Consistent with these observations, bone marrow-
derived splenic macrophage and monocyte populations were
found to be reduced under germ-free conditions (Khosravi
et al., 2014). In line with these findings, we demonstrated
that, 1 week after the discontinuation of Abx treatment, bone
marrow-derived myeloid populations decreased in bone marrow
and blood. Then 4 weeks after the discontinuation of Abx treat-
ment, the myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood were back
to control levels, while the drop in numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes
was still evident in the brain. This could be explained by a con-
stant but slow turnover of peripheral immune cells in the brain,
similar to what was described for leukocyte surveillance in the
brain (Ousman and Kubes, 2012). Whether the prolonged use
of Abxs would result in long-lasting effects in neurogenesis
and brain function remains to be investigated. Consistent with
recent findings (Erny et al., 2015), the number of the brain’s resi-
dent macrophage population, the microglia, was not changed by
Abx treatment. Under germ-free conditions, microglia and other
immune cell populations seem to be more severely affected,
since germ-free mice have never been exposed to a complex
microbial flora and, therefore, development of the immune sys-
tem is affected in those mice (Cerf-Bensussan and Gaboriau-
Routhiau, 2010).
The study by Erny et al. (2015) investigated only microglia,
missing the important contribution of myeloid-derived cells;
thus, making a direct comparison of the studies is rather difficult.
It is likely that some of the changes reported in germ-free mice
could be attributed to alterations in the circulating immune cell
composition and function. With respect to brain function and
behavior, germ-free mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior
(Neufeld et al., 2011) and altered social development (Arentsen
et al., 2015). In parallel to the behavioral alterations, germ-free
mice display an increase in BDNF mRNA levels in the hippocam-
pus (Neufeld et al., 2011). Moreover, neurogenesis is increased
in germ-free mice (Ogbonnaya et al., 2015), which corresponds
to the increase in hippocampal BDNF in this mouse model.
Germ-free mice have been shown to display higher motor activ-
ity (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), and this also may account for an in-
crease in neurogenesis.
Since adult neurogenesis is a complex procedure that is
orchestrated by several factors, such as neurotransmitters,
metabolites, as well as hormones (Kempermann et al., 2015),
the effect in mice treated with Abxs could be driven by multiple
aspects besides the levels of Ly6Chi monocytes. Depletion of
the gut microbiota with Abxs from weaning onward reduced anx-
iety and induced cognitive deficits, while BDNF was significantly
reduced in the adult brain (Desbonnet et al., 2015). This is in line
with our findings of reduced neurogenesis and cognitive deficits
in mice treated with Abxs during adulthood. The opposite effects
in behavior, BDNF levels, and neurogenesis between the germ-
free mouse model and the Abx-treated mouse model show that a
direct comparison of these models is rather difficult. Both
models harbor aspects besides the lack of gut microbiota that
should be taken into account, either developmental deficits in
the germ-free mouse model or possible direct effects of the
Abxs on host tissue in the Abx-treated mice.
We here demonstrate that Abx treatment results in a long-last-
ing impairment of neurogenesis that can be restored by probiot-
ics and voluntary exercise. Cells of the innate immune system, in
particular Ly6Chi monocytes, are critical for the restorative effect.
We cannot thoroughly rule out that other CNS-resident cells,
such as microglia, neurons, astrocytes, or endothelial cells, are
affected as well, and NPCs may receive additional signals
involving other mechanisms. However, our analysis of Ly6Chi
monocytes in different treatment paradigms in conjunction with
the depletion and repopulation experiments points toward their
crucial involvement in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. With
Ly6Chi monocytes, here we present one distinct messenger
that communicates among the gut-immune-brain axis. Finally,
our results provide a rationale for probiotic supplementation
and exercise to restore monocyte homeostasis and brain plas-
ticity to counteract the devastating side effects of prolonged
Abx treatment.
Figure 5. Co-culture of Primary Hippocampal NPCs with Bone
Marrow-Derived Ly6Chi Monocytes Results in an Increase of Neu-
rosphere Number
Primary NPCs from C57BL/6 female donor mice were plated at a density of
105 cells/ml into the bottom of 96-well trans-well plates at a volume of 200 ml of
proliferation medium. Neurospheres formed by the NPCs in each well (12 wells
per group) were counted using an inverted light microscope after 72 hr of co-
culture. On top of the trans-wells, we plated different numbers of freshly
isolated, FACS-sorted, CD11bposLy6Chi (red bars) or CD11bposLy6Cneg cells
(blue bars) from naive bone marrow. Co-cultures were compared with
NPCs cultured in medium only (white bar) (n = 12; two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni
post hoc test; three independent experiments; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01;

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
In each independent experiment for Figures 1, 2, and 3, we used 70 female 6-
to 8-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type mice. We performed three independent
experiments and used the data points of 210 individual mice. We need to
emphasize that not all the groups mentioned below were included in each of
the independent experiments. The actual experimental repeats and numbers
(n) are stated in the figure legends. Mice that had access to a running wheel
were housed in pairs to avoid single housing, which can result in social depri-
vation that has an impact on neurogenesis. A small magnet was attached to
the bottom rim of the wheels to monitor the rotations by a cycling computer
during the active phase from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Knowing the diameter of the
wheel (17 cm), we were able to calculate the distance the two mice ran per
active phase. Running groups were monitored over 10 days and an average
distance was calculated for each group. The animals were handled according
to governmental (LaGeSo) and internal (MDC/Charite
´ /University of Magde-
burg) rules and regulations. All mice were kept under a 12-hr light/dark cycle
and had access to food and water ad libitum with two to five mice per cage.
The experimental design is shown in Figure S5.
Abx and Probiotic Treatments
Since commensals are required for normal development especially of the im-
mune and nervous systems, we used a model of Abx-induced dysbiosis ac-
cording to the protocol published previously (Heimesaat et al., 2006). The
Abx compounds were applied via the drinking water for 7 weeks and consisted
of ampicillin plus sulbactam (1.5 g/l; Pfizer), vancomycin (500 mg/l; Cell Pharm),
ciprofloxacin (200 mg/l; Bayer Vital), imipenem plus cilastatin (250 mg/l; MSD),
and metronidazol (1 g/l; Fresenius). Then 72 hr before gut flora reconstitution,
the Abx treatment was discontinued and replaced by sterile tap water. Then
Abx-treated mice were orally challenged with fecal flora by 300-ml gavage on
2 consecutive days. The fecal transplant consisted of a mixture from 1 mg feces
of five different SPF mice dissolved in 15 ml sterile PBS. In parallel to the fecal
transplants, the Abx plus probiotics group received VSL#3 (Sigma-Tau Phar-
maceuticals) probiotics orally by gavage. VSL#3 is a commercially available
probiotic mixture consisting of the following eight bacterial strains: Strepto-
coccus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifido-
bacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lacto-
bacillus paracasei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus. We
dissolved a total of 4.5 3 109 probiotic bacteria into 10 ml PBS. By gavaging
300 ml, each mouse received approximately 1 3 107 viable probiotic bacteria.
BrdU Treatment
For the analysis of cell proliferation and survival, the animals received an intra-
peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich)/g body weight at a con-
centration of 10 mg/ml BrdU in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution for 3 consecutive
days, and they were examined 4 weeks later if not stated otherwise. Please
note that the BrdU injections for experiments depicted in Figure 1 were done
in a different lab (Charite
´ Berlin) than the BrdU injections in Figures 4A (Cleve-
land Clinic), 4C, and 4E (University of Magdeburg). Despite keeping protocols
and substances similar across labs, individual injection techniques and vol-
umes account for differences in baseline BrdU cell numbers. We always
included a matching control group in each individual experiment and one
should not compare baseline BrdU numbers across experimental groups.
Cell Counting and Unbiased Stereology
Cell counts were determined in an unbiased approach using the optical frac-
tionator procedure of the StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience) for
every sixth brain section containing the hippocampus. The obtained cell num-
ber was multiplied by the number of slices analyzed to calculate the number of
BrdU-positive cells in the whole hippocampus. Since both hippocampi were
counted, we used as a unit the total number of BrdU-positive cells per brain.
For further phenotypic analysis of BrdU-positive cells, 50 cells in the DG
from each brain were counted on a confocal microscope for colocalization
with Dcx or NeuN. Six different tissue sections were analyzed throughout
the hippocampus and tissue from at least eight individual mice per group
were used for phenotyping.
Novel Object Recognition Test
It was shown by Jessberger et al. (2009) that a DG-specific knockdown of adult
neurogenesis impairs spatial and object recognition memory in adult rats. We
adapted the protocol for mice. The novel object recognition task takes advan-
tage of a rodent’s spontaneous preference to explore novel objects relative to
familiar objects. This test is the benchmark test of recognition memory in
the rodent and is dependent on the integrity of the hippocampus (for
review, see Squire et al., 2007). The test was conducted in a white plastic
chamber (35 3 40 3 40 cm). A video camera connected to a computer was
used to record the exploration and testing sessions. A single trial consists of
a familiarization phase (encoding) followed by a delay interval and then a
test phase (retrieval). During the familiarization phase, the mouse was allowed
to explore and become familiar with two identical objects placed side by side in
the chamber. A single 10-min familiarization phase was presented before the
test phase. We tested the mice after delay intervals of 1 min and 3 hr. Before
the test phase, one object was replaced by an unfamiliar object to the mouse
(novel object). During the test phase, the mouse was allowed to explore two
objects placed side by side (one novel object). The experimentor scored object
exploration until the mouse accumulated 1 min of contact time with the objects
in total (nose within 1 cm of the objects). The dependent measure was the per-
centage of time that a mouse spent exploring the novel object during the 1 min
of object exploration. Which object was novel and the left/right position of the
novel object was counterbalanced within each group. The experimenter was
blind to the group membership of the mouse during offline data analysis.
Flow Cytometry
Single-cell suspensions were incubated with an anti-FcgIII/II receptor anti-
body (clone 93, eBioscience, 14-0161) to block unspecific binding. Thereafter,
cells were stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
against cell surface markers: CD45 (30-F11, eBioscience, 48-0451), CD11b
(M1/70, eBioscience, 17-0112), Ly6G (1A8, BD Biosciences, 561104), Ly6C
(HK1.4, eBioscience, 45-5932), CD3 (17A2, eBioscience, 11-0032) in fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum
[FCS] and 0.1% NaN3) for 30 min on ice and then washed and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cell acquisition was performed on a BD FACS
Canto II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Depletion of Monocytes
Depletion of monocytes with 75 mg/injection anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody
(MC-21, kindly provided by M. Mack, University of Regensburg) and neutrophil
granulocytes with 440 mg/injection anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody (1A8,
BioXCell, BE0075-1) was started on day 0 by i.p. injection of the respective
antibody in 300 ml PBS. BrdU was injected on days 1–3. Antibody injections
were continued every third day until day 20 and animals were sacrificed on
day 21. Control animals received 75 mg polyclonal rat IgG (BioXCell, BE0094).
Adoptive Transfer of Monocytes
Ly6Cpos cells were isolated from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice using flow
cytometry and sorting for adoptive transfer. Ly6Cpos cells (106) were injected
into the tail vein of adult female C57BL/6 Abx-treated mice. The procedure
was repeated 48 hr later followed by BrdU injections.
Sphere Formation Assay
The number of newly formed spheres was assessed by plating 105 NPCs/ ml
(96-well plate) and incubated in 200 ml cultivation medium. Ly6Chi cells were
isolated from bone marrow and sorted with FACS. Either Ly6Cpos or Ly6Cneg
cells were co-cultured on top of the trans-well in different concentrations, as
indicated in Figure 5. Twelve wells were seeded per cell concentration. After
72 hr, the trans-well was removed and the number of spheres per well was
counted using an inverted light microscope. An Alamar-blue assay was
performed to control for cell viability.
Statistical Analysis
Datasets were analyzed statistically using GraphPad Prism 3. Before we
started statistical analysis, we tested for normality with a normality probability
plot. We performed Dixons test for single outlier, but we did not detect outliers
in our dataset. We used either two-way or one-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni

 post hoc or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test where applicable. We mention
the respective statistical test in the figure legends. Significances are depicted
in the respective figure legends as mean ± SEM. When we sacrificed the ani-
mals (D.M. and S.A.W.), we prepared a list with animal IDs. We prepared the
specimens (brain, blood, feces, and bone marrow) for further analysis and
coded the samples in order to do a blind analysis afterward. The investigator
who analyzed the samples (L.M., D.M., I.R.D., S.A.W., and A.F.) was blind to
the animal’s treatment group.
