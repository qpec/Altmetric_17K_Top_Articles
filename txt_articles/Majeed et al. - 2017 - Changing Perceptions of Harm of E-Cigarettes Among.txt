Introduction: Although the impact of long-term use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on health
is still unknown, current scientific evidence indicates that e-cigarettes are less harmful than
combustible cigarettes. The study examined whether perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes and
perceived addictiveness have changed during 2012–2015 among U.S. adults.
Methods: Data were from Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions surveys of probability samples
representative of U.S. adults in 2012, 2014, and 2015. Changes over time in perceived harmfulness of
e-cigarettes were examined using pairwise comparisons of proportions and multinomial logistic
regression analysis. Analyses were conducted in January 2016.
Results: Whereas 11.5% and 1.3% of adults perceived e-cigarettes to have about the same level of
harm and to be more harmful than cigarettes, respectively, in 2012, 35.7% and 4.1% did so in 2015.
The proportion of adults who thought e-cigarettes were addictive more than doubled during 2012–
2015 (32.0% in 2012 vs 67.6% in 2015). Compared with 2012, the odds of perceiving e-cigarettes to
be equally or more harmful (than to be less harmful) doubled (95% CI¼1.64, 2.41) in 2014, and
tripled (95% CI¼2.60, 3.81) in 2015.
Conclusions: There is an increase in the proportion of U.S. adults who misperceive the harm of e-
cigarettes and consider them to be as harmful as combustible cigarettes. The study highlights the
need to design public health messages that accurately interpret the scientific data on the potential
harm of e-cigarettes and clearly differentiate the absolute from the relative harm of e-cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION
B
reathing smoke from combustible cigarettes is a
leading cause of preventable disease and death in
the U.S., and causes the majority of tobacco-
related death and disease.1 In the U.S., in addition to the
more than 16 million who suffer from smoking-
attributable diseases,2 about 480,000 lives are lost to
smoking annually.1 Therefore, curbing the smoking
epidemic is a major public health goal.1 Recently, the
market for tobacco products has entered a period of
dramatic transformation where innovative products
could lead to the demise of combusted cigarettes.3–5
For example, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), also
known as electronic vapor products, are a novel product
that has no tobacco yet may contain nicotine derived
from tobacco. This class of products uses battery power
to heat a solution (known as e-juice and may contain
nicotine in addition to flavorings and other chemicals) to
produce an aerosol for inhalation.6 Ever and current use
of e-cigarettes have steadily increased over the last few
years.7–10 In 2014, nearly 15% of U.S. adults had ever

 used e-cigarettes, 5% had used e-cigarettes in the past 30
days,8 and 4% had used them every day or some days.9
Although the impact of long-term use of e-cigarettes
on health is still unknown, the available scientific
evidence indicates that e-cigarettes are less harmful than
combustible cigarettes,6,11,12 and that smokers switching
to e-cigarettes could benefit from a decrease in health
risks related to smoking combustible cigarettes.6,13,14 One
of the common reasons for e-cigarette use is the belief
that e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustible
cigarettes.15–17 Research has shown that cigarette smok-
ers, college students, and young adults tend to perceive
e-cigarettes to be less harmful than combustible ciga-
rettes,18–22 and that this correct perception is predictive
of future use of e-cigarettes among never users.23
Furthermore, the belief that e-cigarettes are less addictive
than cigarettes increases the appeal of e-cigarettes,
especially
to
young
adults.24
Users
of
nicotine-
containing e-cigarettes may become dependent on
e-cigarettes, yet compared with the addictiveness of
combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes are typically rated as
less addictive.25,26
Previous studies have identified how consumers per-
ceive e-cigarette harmfulness and addictiveness.16,19,25
However, different approaches were used to measure
perceptions of e-cigarettes, making findings difficult to
compare over time.27 In this study, data were from three
web-based surveys using probability samples representa-
tive of non-institutionalized U.S. adults conducted in
2012, 2014, and 2015. Using the same measures to define
perceived harmfulness and perceived addictiveness of
e-cigarettes in the three surveys allowed for comparisons
over time. As the nature of the regulatory environment
influences perceptions of e-cigarettes,28 it was hypothe-
sized that perceptions regarding e-cigarettes may have
changed over the past 4 years in response to the changing
regulatory environment.29 The purposes of the current
study were to determine whether the perceived harm of
e-cigarettes relative to the harm of combustible cigarettes
and perceived addictiveness have changed over a 4-year
period (2012–2015) among U.S. adults and to examine
factors associated with misperceiving e-cigarettes as
equally or more harmful than combustible cigarettes.
METHODS
Data Sample
This study used data from the 2012 (August); 2014 (June–
November); and 2015 (August–September) Tobacco Products
and Risk Perceptions Surveys conducted by the Georgia State
University School of Public Health. These surveys were national,
cross-sectional surveys of a probability sample drawn from
KnowledgePanel,
a
probability-based
online
research
panel
designed to be representative of non-institutionalized U.S. adults.
More details on these surveys can be found in previous
publications.7,8,30
For each survey, a probability sample of U.S. adults from
KnowledgePanel (including a representative oversample of ciga-
rette smokers in 2014 and 2015) was selected. A total of 4,170,
5,717, and 6,051 respondents completed the 2012, 2014, and 2015
surveys, respectively, yielding final-stage completion rates of 65.1%
in 2012, 74.4% in 2014, and 76.0% in 2015. A study-specific post-
stratification weight was computed using an iterative proportional
fitting procedure (raking) to adjust for survey non-response as well
as for oversampling of smokers. Demographic and geographic
distributions from the most recent Current Population Surveys for
the respective survey years were employed as benchmarks for
adjustment, and included gender, age, race/ethnicity, education,
household income, Census region, metropolitan area, and Internet
access. For the present study, the sample of interest consisted of
2,808, 5,234, and 5,389 participants in 2012, 2014, and 2015,
respectively, who reported prior awareness of e-cigarettes. This
study was approved by the IRB at Georgia State University. Key
demographic characteristics of the samples are shown in Appendix
Table 1 (available online).
Measures
Participants who indicated that they have heard about e-cigarettes
were considered aware. Ever trying e-cigarettes was assessed by
asking participants who had indicated prior awareness of
e-cigarettes whether they have ever tried e-cigarettes/electronic
vapor products, even just one time. Those who responded yes were
defined as having ever tried e-cigarettes.
Perceived harmfulness of e-cigarettes relative to combustible
cigarettes was assessed using the question: Is using [e-cigarettes/
electronic vapor products] less harmful, about the same level of
harm, or more harmful than smoking regular cigarettes? Partic-
ipants could also select I don’t know. Perceived addictiveness of
e-cigarettes was measured with the question: Do you think people
can become addicted to [e-cigarettes/electronic vapor products]?
Responses included yes, no, and I don’t know.
Sociodemographic characteristics included in this study were:
sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household
income, and U.S. Census region. Current smokers were defined as
adults who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime
and reported currently smoking every day or some days. Former
smokers were defined as adults who had smoked at least 100
cigarettes and responded not at all to the question about current
smoking. Those who had not smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime were defined as never smokers.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted in January 2016 using Stata, version 13,
to obtain design-based (weighted) point estimates and 95% CIs of
the response category proportions for the perception items, overall
and by smoking status. Pairwise comparisons of the proportions
were conducted to test the difference between the proportions
across surveys.
The characteristics of participants who responded about the
same and those who responded more harmful were examined and
found to be similar. Given that only a small proportion of
respondents reported more harmful and that they were not
Majeed et al / Am J Prev Med 2017;52(3):331–338
332
www.ajpmonline.org
 fundamentally different from adults who reported about the same, the
two response categories were grouped into one category representing
adults who perceived e-cigarettes as equally or more harmful than
combustible cigarettes. Perceived harmfulness of e-cigarettes was
analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. To identify character-
istics of adults who were misinformed about the relative harm of
e-cigarettes, for this analysis, the response category “less harmful” was
used as the ref group of the dependent variable, in alignment with the
scientific evidence.12 The survey year and perceived addictiveness were
the independent variables, and ever trying e-cigarettes and demo-
graphic characteristics were covariates.
Using the most recent survey data, bivariate tests of associations
(chi-square) were conducted to examine differences in the
perceived harmfulness of e-cigarettes relative to combustible
cigarettes and the perceived addictiveness of e-cigarettes across
participant characteristics. For all analyses, p-values o0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Table 1 depicts the perceived harmfulness of e-cigarettes
relative to cigarettes and the perceived addictiveness
among all participants, current smokers, and former
smokers. There was an increase in the proportions of
adults who perceived e-cigarettes to have “about the same
level of harm” as or to be “more harmful” than cigarettes
(Appendix Figure 1, available online). Whereas about
12.9% of adults thought e-cigarettes were “equally or
more harmful than cigarettes” in 2012, nearly four in ten
adults (39.8%) held this perception in 2015 (po0.001).
This increase in the perceived relative harm occurred in
tandem with a decline in the proportions of adults who
were
uncertain
(I
don’t
know)
or
perceived
e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes. The propor-
tion of adults who were uncertain about the relative harm
of e-cigarettes decreased from nearly half (47.8%) in 2012
to 29.5% in 2015. A similar, though less pronounced,
decrease was observed in the proportions of adults who
perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes
(39.4% in 2012 vs 30.7% in 2015). The proportion of
adults who perceived e-cigarettes to be addictive more
than doubled from 32.0% in 2012 to 67.6% in 2015
(po0.001).
Regardless of smoking status, the perceptions that
e-cigarettes were equally or more harmful and that they
were addictive increased during 2012–2015. There was
an increase in the proportion of current smokers who
perceived e-cigarettes to be equally or more harmful than
cigarettes (11.7% in 2012 vs 35.1% in 2015, po0.001).
The proportion of current smokers who believed
e-cigarettes to be addictive more than doubled (25.3%
in 2012 vs 56.7% in 2015, po0.001).
Bivariate tests revealed that perceived harmfulness of
e-cigarettes was associated with demographic character-
istics and ever trying e-cigarettes, in 2015 (Table 2).
Compared with never users of e-cigarettes, those who
ever tried were more likely to perceive e-cigarettes to be
less harmful than cigarettes (25.7%, 95% CI¼24.1, 27.4 vs
51.2%, 95% CI¼47.3, 55.1; po0.001).
Results of the multivariable multinomial logistic
regression analysis showed that compared with 2012,
the odds of perceiving e-cigarettes to be equally or more

CI¼2.60, 3.81, po0.001) in 2015 (Table 3). Adults who
perceived e-cigarettes to be addictive had a 4.30-fold
(95% CI¼3.22, 5.76, po0.001) higher adjusted odds of
perceiving e-cigarettes to be equally or more harmful
than cigarettes. Significant differences were observed in
perceived harmfulness of e-cigarettes by sex, age, and
ever trying e-cigarettes. Compared with never e-cigarette
users, adults who ever tried e-cigarettes had 61% reduc-
tion in the adjusted odds of perceiving e-cigarettes to be
equally harmful or more harmful than cigarettes. Men
were less likely than women to perceive e-cigarettes as
equally or more harmful than cigarettes. Compared with
young adults, those aged Z25 years had higher odds of
perceiving e-cigarettes as equally or more harmful than
perceiving them to be less harmful than cigarettes.
No significant differences were observed in perceived
addictiveness between men and women (Appendix
Table 2, available online). However, the perception that
e-cigarettes were non-addictive was more common
among adults aged 25–34 years (7.2%, 95% CI¼5.3, 9.7);

and those who had less than high school education
(5.5%, 95% CI¼3.1, 9.6). Compared with never users of
e-cigarettes, those who have ever tried e-cigarettes were
more likely to perceive e-cigarettes to be non-addictive
(2.5%, 95% CI¼1.9, 3.3 vs 8.9%, 95% CI¼7.0, 11.2;

DISCUSSION
The main goal of the present study was to determine
whether the perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes versus
combustible cigarettes changed between 2012 and 2015.
Over this period, there was an increase in perceiving
e-cigarettes to be equally or more harmful than cigarettes.
Similarly, the belief that e-cigarettes are addictive
increased among U.S. adults in 2012–2015. Adults who
perceived e-cigarettes to be addictive, had never used
e-cigarettes, were female, or aged 25–34 years were more
likely to misperceive the harm of e-cigarettes—to believe
that e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than
combustible cigarettes.
The findings of the current study indicate that, over
time, U.S. adults, irrespective of smoking history,
increasingly believe that e-cigarettes could be as harmful
as combustible cigarettes, a result congruent with the
literature related to the public perceptions of relative
harm of e-cigarettes.14,20,23 A longitudinal study among
British adult smokers documented a rise in perceiving
e-cigarettes to be equally harmful to combustible
cigarettes from 9.0% in 2012 to 16.9% in 2014.23
Previous studies have shown that lower risk perceptions
of
e-cigarettes
relative
to
combustible
cigarettes
are associated with ever trying and current use of
e-cigarettes among adults,21,31 future use among never
users,23 and exclusive e-cigarette use among smokers
who have completely switched from combustible ciga-
rettes.32 Higher risk perceptions of e-cigarettes could
deter current smokers from using e-cigarettes as a
cessation aid of smoking combustible cigarettes and
preventing a potential public health benefit. Therefore,

 the observed trend is of particular importance and
warrants further attention.
The finding that the higher percentages of adults,
including current smokers, misperceived e-cigarettes to
be equally or more harmful than cigarettes between 2012
and 2015 may be stemming from misinformed media
stories.33 Toxicology studies on the biological effects of
e-cigarette aerosol on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and
immune systems have provided evidence of the risk of
e-cigarette use,6 but the absolute level of exposure to risk
is almost always significantly less than the exposure from
combusted cigarettes. For example, one study examined
the effect of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes on
serum cotinine and lung function in 15 smokers and 15
non-smokers, and documented that short-term use of
e-cigarettes may have a negative effect on lung function,
but that the magnitude of the damage is much smaller
than that of combustible cigarettes.34 Another study
found that the levels of toxicant and carcinogen metab-
olites in urine of exclusive e-cigarette users were lower
than those in the urine of combustible cigarette smokers,12
thus supporting the view that e-cigarettes are less harmful
than combustible cigarettes.35 At the same time, exposure
to e-cigarette vapor was linked to DNA damage, suggest-
ing that e-cigarette use may raise the risk of cancer.36
Findings of this study36 were highlighted in a media article
in which e-cigarettes were presumed to be “no safer than
smoking.”33,36 Confusing relative risk with absolute risk of
e-cigarettes may contribute to framing bias37 in risk
communication and result in media reports and press
releases in which the scientific evidence of absolute harm is
highlighted and that of relative harm is overlooked.
Objective findings may be obscured by the overall image
and tone of the news story,38 negatively influencing public
perceptions of e-cigarettes.
Another explanation for the increasingly high per-
ceived risk of e-cigarettes in comparison with combus-
tible cigarettes could be related to the frequent reports of
adverse incidents associated with e-cigarette use. Exten-
sive reporting of adverse events has been shown to
contribute to public concerns.38 Recent media reports
linking e-cigarettes and e-liquid to serious injuries,39,40
exposure to toxicants,41 development of lung diseases,42
and other health related problems43 may have contrib-
uted to the increasing trend of equating the harm of
e-cigarettes to traditional cigarettes. Lastly, U.S. adults
may be partially equating the harm of e-cigarettes to
combustible cigarettes owing to other concerns related to
the potential of e-juice flavors to lure children into
addiction,44,45 the use of e-cigarettes with illicit drugs,46
and the concern that their use could renormalize
smoking.47 Future research should examine the role of
such issues in shaping individual perceptions about
e-cigarettes. The findings underscore the urgent need to
convey accurate information to the public, especially
adult smokers, about the available scientific evidence of
the harm of e-cigarettes compared with combustible
cigarettes. Public health messages should strike a balance
between addressing the reduced harm of e-cigarettes
compared with combustible cigarettes and presenting an
accurate
interpretation
of
the
absolute
harm
of
e-cigarette use.
In the current study, the estimated percentages of
adults who thought e-cigarettes were less harmful than
cigarettes were lower than those documented in previous
studies.14,31,48 This difference may be the result of
variation in measures of perceived harm of e-cigarettes
and in the characteristics of the study population.
A study among a national sample of U.S. adults conducted
in 2012–2013 revealed that 51.0% of adults perceived
e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes.14 In that
study, perception of relative harm was measured using a
Likert scale question (1, much less risk; 5, much more
risk).14 In the current study, perceived relative harm was
measured using a four-response item (less harmful, about
the same, more harmful, I don’t know). Allowing partic-
ipants to choose an I don’t know response may explain
the lower percentage of adults who believed that
e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes. Further-
more, differences in population characteristics, such as
differences in age or smoking status, may explain why the
observed percentages of perceiving e-cigarettes to be less
harmful were lower than those detected in other
studies,31,48 despite using the same measurement.
Although the current study provides no information
on the level of addictiveness of e-cigarettes compared
with combustible cigarettes, the data show that U.S.
adults hold the correct view about the addictive nature of
e-cigarettes. Most e-cigarettes deliver nicotine, an addic-
tive chemical, though with actual nicotine exposure depend-
ent on product design and user behavior.6 In May 2016,
e-cigarettes were deemed to be regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration; under this rule, e-cigarettes with
nicotine are required to carry an addiction warning state-
ment.29 Future research examining how the public perceive
the addictive nature of e-cigarettes is warranted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the new rule of subjecting e-cigarettes to
the addiction warning statement.
Limitations
The use of an online research panel (KnowledgePanel) may
raise concerns about generalizability of the results to the U.S.
adult population. In addition, the rapid changes of e-cigarette
design, characteristics, and nomenclature make it difficult to
identify accurate terminology to develop questions regarding
e-cigarette awareness, use, and perceptions of harm and

 addictiveness. Whereas in 2012 and 2014 surveys the term
“e-cigarette” was used to describe the product, a different
wording was used in the 2015 survey, “electronic vapor
product,” to provide an updated terminology that encom-
passes newer models. This variation in wording may raise
concerns about comparability across years. However, the
three surveys assessed perceptions of harm using the same
question and the same response categories. Finally, similar to
previous studies,14,20,23 one general question to measure the
perceived relative harm was used, which may not capture
various aspects of harm.19
CONCLUSIONS
The results document an increase in the misperception
that e-cigarettes are equally or even more harmful than
combustible cigarettes. The study highlights the need to
design public health messages that accurately interpret
the scientific data on the potential harm of e-cigarette use
and clearly differentiate the absolute from the relative
harm of e-cigarettes.
