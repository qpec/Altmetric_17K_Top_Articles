Abstract
Background: Few studies have investigated the independent associations of lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity,
sleep, and screen time) and body weight status with academic achievement. Even fewer have investigated the
combined effect of these behaviors on academic achievement. We hypothesize that the combined effect of these
behaviors will have a higher impact on academic achievement than any behavior alone, or that of body weight status.
Methods: In 2011, 4253 grade 5 (10–11 years old) students and their parents were surveyed about the child’s diet,
physical activity, screen time and sleep. Students’ heights and weights were measured by research assistants. Academic
achievement was measured using provincial standardized exams in mathematics, reading and writing, and was
expressed as ‘meeting’ or ‘not meeting’ expectations as per standardized criterion. Exams were written 1 year following
the measurement of lifestyle behaviors. Lifestyle behaviors were measured with self- and parental proxy reports and
expressed as meeting recommendations (yes/no) for each behavior. Mixed effects logistic regression models adjusting
for demographic confounders and caloric intake were used to determine the independent and combined associations.
Results: Meeting dietary recommendations was associated with increased likelihood of meeting academic expectations
for each of math, reading and writing. Meeting recommendations for screen time and sleep was associated with
meeting expectations for writing. For all three subjects, meeting additional lifestyle behavior recommendations was
associated with higher likelihood of meeting expectations. Children who met 7–9 lifestyle behavior recommendations
had greater than three-times the odds of meeting expectations for reading compared to those who met 0–3
recommendations (OR: 3.07, 95% CI: 2.09, 4.51), and 1.47 and 2.77 times the odds of meeting expectations in
mathematics and writing, respectively. Body weight status was not associated with academic achievement.
Conclusions: We found that lifestyle behaviors, not body weight status, are strongly associated with student academic
performance. Promoting compliance with established healthy lifestyle recommendations could improve both the health
and educational outcomes of school-aged children. School-based health promotion initiatives that target multiple
lifestyle behaviors may have a greater effect on academic achievement than those that focus on a single behavior.

 Background
It is established that academic success in childhood and
adolescence is a strong predictor of future wealth, prod-
uctivity and health [1, 2]. Provided this, attention to chil-
dren’s
academic
achievement
must
be
taken
into
consideration by public health decision makers aiming
to prevent chronic diseases and improve health across
the lifespan. This includes not only the resources de-
voted to educational attainment, but an understanding
of the indirect lifestyle factors the help to shape child-
hood and adolescent academic success.
Healthy diets, sufficient physical activity and sleep, and
minimal screen time contribute to a healthy lifestyle, are
important to children’s cognitive performance during de-
velopment, and may potentially optimize academic suc-
cess [3–11]. Findings from studies investigating the
relationship between individual lifestyle behaviors and
academic achievement have demonstrated that children
with healthy lifestyle behaviors perform better academic-
ally [10, 12–15]. In particular, reductions in children’s
time spent in physical education has motivated substan-
tial study of the relationship between physical activity
and academic achievement [16]. However, few studies
have investigated the independent association of mul-
tiple lifestyle behaviors with academic achievement;
particular the potential confounding in the observed re-
lationship given the strong correlation between lifestyle
factors [17–20]. For example, levels of sleep are associ-
ated with academic achievement, yet screen time has
been shown to be associated with both sleep and aca-
demic achievement [14, 21, 22]. If screen time is not
taken into consideration when evaluating the associ-
ation between sleep and academic achievement, the ob-
served relationship may, in part, have contributed to
the effects of screen time.
Some scholars have hypothesized that healthy lifestyle
behaviors do not act in isolation in their relationship
with academic achievement, and that the effects of exhi-
biting multiple healthy lifestyle behaviors may be greater
than the sum of their individual effects [17, 23, 24]. To
our knowledge, only two studies have investigated this
hypothesis, and both have found convincing evidence in
support of it [17, 25]. Using self-reported health data in
a cohort of Spanish adolescents, Martinez-Gomez et al.
(2014) found that meeting recommendations for 3–4
lifestyle behaviors was associated with higher odds
achieving passing grades in Language and Literature and
Math, in girls only, compared to those that met fewer
recommendations [17]. In a sample of American chil-
dren in a low-income urban distract, Ickovics et al.
found that children exhibiting the largest number of
healthy lifestyle behaviors, including a healthy body
weight, were more than twice as likely to meet goal on
standardized exams compared to those with the fewest
[25]. Further investigation of this hypothesis is merited
to inform effective health promotion in children, par-
ticularly school-based initiatives. Many health promotion
initiatives based in schools have focused on singular
components of a healthy lifestyle; addressing multiple
behaviors simultaneously may produce cumulative bene-
fits that impact both health and academic outcomes.
Our aim is to investigate the independent and com-
bined effects of lifestyle behaviors, as well as body
weight status, on children’s academic achievement on
standardized exams using a large, population-based sam-
ple of grade 5 students from Nova Scotia, Canada. We
aim to complement and expand on previous work by
using a large, population-based sample as well as includ-
ing a wide range of dietary components, sleep duration
and
adherence
to
established
recommendations for
sleep, objectively measured heights and weights, and
standardized exam results in addition to measures of
physical activity and screen time. We evaluate children’s
lifestyle behaviors by their adherence to established health
recommendations from Health Canada, the United States
Departments of Health and Human Services and Agricul-
ture, and the World Health Organization (WHO) for each
behavior in order to improve interpretability and applic-
ability of results for public health decision makers [26–28].
We hypothesize that each lifestyle behavior of interest
(diet, physical activity, screen time and sleep) will have an
independent effect on academic achievement. We also
hypothesize that the combined effect of multiple healthy
lifestyle behaviors will have a greater effect on academic
achievement than their respective individual effects.
Methods
The 2011 Children’s Lifestyle And School performance
Study (CLASS) is a population-based survey examining
lifestyle behaviors, weight status, and academic achieve-
ment of grade 5 (mostly 10–11 years old) students in
Nova Scotia, Canada. All grade 5 students in Nova
Scotia, their parents or guardians, and school adminis-
trators were invited to participate in the study. Of all
schools that had grade 5 classes in the province, prin-
cipals in 269 of 286 (94.1%) schools provided consent
for participation. Following consent from the princi-
pal, home packages, including consent forms, were
sent home to all parents and guardians of grade 5 chil-
dren in the school. Parental consent to participate in
the survey was provided for 6591 students out of 8736
that were distributed, resulting in an average response
rate of 75.4% per school. Of these, 1169 (17.7%) were
absent the day of the survey, did not complete the sur-
vey, or had caloric intakes <500 or >5000 kcal as these
values are considered unrealistic [29], and as such
were excluded from analysis, leaving 5422 eligible stu-
dents. Of remaining students, 4253 (78%) could be

standardized exams in Reading, Writing and Mathematics
that were written one full year following the lifestyle be-
havior assessment; the resulting overall completion rate
was 64.5%. Further information and the survey used can
be found at http://www.nsclass.ca.
Data collection
Trained research assistants travelled to participating
schools to administer surveys during classroom time.
Students completed two surveys. The student survey
contained questions about habitual physical activity and
personal perceptions about diet. Students also completed
the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire for Youth/
Adolescents (YAQ), a 147-item validated questionnaire
adapted for Canadian use that measures habitual intake
over the past 12 months [30]. Research assistants mea-
sured students’ heights to the nearest 0.1 cm and
weights to the nearest 0.1 g using calibrated stadi-
ometers and scales as per standard protocol [31]. Par-
ents completed a home survey reporting on children’s
sleep habits and screen time usage, as well questions on
household income and parental level of education.
Exposures
Diet
We employed the Harvard Food Frequency Question-
naire YAQ to evaluate students dietary consumption.
The YAQ contains 147 questions, 135 of which are re-
garding specific food items and 11 of which relate to
food habits (eating in front of the TV, etc.), about the
frequency of consuming items over the past year [30].
Nutrient information was derived using the Canadian
Nutrient File (CNF) [32], a Canadian nutrient compos-
ition database for commonly consumed foods in Canada.
Students’ consumption was evaluated with respect to
meeting
age-specific
recommendations
from
Health
Canada’s Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide [26].
This includes recommendations for daily servings of
vegetables and fruit (6 servings), grain products (6 serv-
ings), milk and alternatives (3–4 servings) and meat and
alternatives (2 servings). The Canadian Food Guide does
not have specific recommendations for saturated fat and
free sugar intake. Instead we used recommendations
developed for American youth for saturated fat intake
(<10% of total energy intake) [28], and for free sugars
consumption – representing sugars that are added dur-
ing food processing, not naturally occurring sugars
such as lactose – we followed 2015 World Health
Organization recommendations (<10% of total energy
intake) [27]. We calculated energy intake using re-
sponses from the YAQ.
Physical activity
The student survey contained the Physical Activity
Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) instrument, a self-
administered, 10-item physical activity recall instrument
[33]. The questionnaire has been validated to measure
general levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
in children aged 8–14 [33–35]. A score between 0 and 5
was calculated from responses for each student, with
higher scores indicating higher levels of physical activity.
Cutoff values indicating ‘healthy fit’ or ‘at-risk’ in regards
to cardio-respiratory fitness for the PAQ-C have been
established for children: 2.7 for girls and 2.9 for boys
[36]. As such, meeting recommendations for physical ac-
tivity that correspond with healthy cardio-respiratory fit-
ness were assessed using these cutoff values.
Screen time
Parents were asked: On average, about how many hours
per day does your Grade 5 child spend watching TV not
including school hours? Possible responses were: Less
than 1 h a day, 1–2 h per day, 3–4 h per day, or 5 or
more hours per day. Children were described as meeting
sedentary behavior recommendations if total screen time
from television watching was less than 2 h per day as
per the Canadian Sedentary Behavior Guidelines [37].
Sleep
Parents reported habitual wake up and bed times for chil-
dren on usual weekdays and weekends. Parents were
asked: At what time does your child usually wake up dur-
ing a) the week (Monday to Friday) and b) the weekend
(Saturday and Sunday)? Possible responses were before
6:30 am, 6:30–7:00 am, 7:00–7:30 am, 7:30–8:00 am,
8:00–8:30 am, 8:30–9:00 am and after 9:00 am. Parents
were also asked: At what time does your child usually go
to bed during a) the week (Sunday to Thursday) and b)
the weekend (Friday and Saturday)? Possible responses
were before 8:00 pm, 8:00–8:30 pm, 8:30–9:00 pm, 9:00–
9:30 pm, 9:30–10:00 pm, 10:00–10:30 pm, and after
10:30 pm. Finally, sleep duration was calculated based on
usual bed and wake up times with usual time to fall asleep
subtracted for each of weekday and weekend days. Aver-
age nightly sleep duration for a typical week was calcu-
lated from the mean sleep duration of five weekdays and
two weekend days. Students were described as meeting
sleep duration recommendations if average duration was
between 9 and 11 h, as recommended by the National
Sleep Foundation [38].
Body weight status
Children’s body mass index (BMI) was calculated using
measured heights and weights. Body weight status was
assessed using the International Obesity Task Force
Faught et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:29 
Page 3 of 13
 (IOTF) age- and gender-specific BMI cutoffs for over-
weight and obesity [39].
Potential confounders
Analyses were adjusted for child’s gender, parental edu-
cation, and household income as assessed by categorical
questions in the parental home survey as well as region
of residence (urban or rural) determined by postal code.
Energy intake was included in analyses that included
YAQ data as is recommended [29].
Outcome
Academic achievement
The Nova Scotia Department of Early Education and
Childhood Development provided results for standard-
ized provincial exams written by participants in grade 6
(spring 2012), 1 year following the measurement of other
variables (spring 2011), in the subjects of Mathematics,
Reading, and Writing. Results were provided as dichot-
omous values of ‘meeting expectations’ and ‘not meeting
expectations’. The Nova Scotia Department of Early
Education and Childhood Development, who adminis-
ters the exams, provides standardized rubrics for the
exams to determine of children are meeting and not
meeting expectations. Teachers from across the province
are invited to assist in the marking of assessments. Fur-
ther information about this process can be found at
https://plans.ednet.ns.ca/about-plans.
Analysis
All analyses were weighted for non-response to repre-
sent provincial estimates of the grade 5 student popula-
tion of Nova Scotia. Response weights were calculated
based on postal-code level estimates of household data,
available from Canadian census data for both partici-
pants and non-participants [40]. As response rates were
lower among the lowest income deciles, weights were
applied to overcome non-response bias from lower-
income neighbourhoods in Nova Scotia [40]. We applied
mixed effects models due to the clustering of students
within schools. Correlations between exposures of inter-
est were evaluated and can be found in the supplemen-
tary material (Additional file 1). Univariable logistic
regression was first used to assess the associations between
each individual student’s lifestyle behaviors, dichotomized
into meeting and not meeting recommendations for
each, and their academic achievement. Next, we used
multivariable models (Model 1) to adjust for potential
confounders and body weight status. Models for individual
exposures of interest were run including potential con-
founders (nine separate models for each recommendation).
Another model was run with confounders only, producing
the results for Model 1 in Tables 2, 3, and 4 for con-
founders. Finally, we considered all lifestyle behaviors
simultaneously in a full model (model 2) to assess inde-
pendent associations between meeting each lifestyle
behavior recommendation, body weight status, and
academic achievement.
To assess combined effects of meeting each lifestyle
behavior recommendation, we also considered the
effect of the number of recommendations met up to 9
(vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alterna-
tives, meat and alternatives, saturated fat, free sugars,
physical activity, sleep, and screen time). As with asses-
sing independent associations, univariable and multi-
variable regression models were employed treating the
score as both categorical and continuous to assess the
cumulative impact of meeting lifestyle behavior recom-
mendations and academic achievement. This analysis
was conducted treating the score as a continuous vari-
able and by splitting scores into three categories, low
(meeting 1–3 recommendations), medium (meeting 4–6
recommendations) and high (meeting 7–9 recommenda-
tions). All analyses were conducted using Stata version
14.1 IC (StataCorp, Texas, USA).
Results
Table 1 shows that 87.4% of students met expectations
for reading, 89.1% met expectations for writing, and
70.6% met expectations for mathematics. The percentage
of children meeting selected lifestyle behavior recom-
mendations was: 32.2% for Vegetables and Fruits, 20.8%
for Grain Products, 56.0 for Milk and Alternatives, 86.4
for Meat and Alternatives, 54.3% for saturated fat intake,
62.6% for free sugars intake, 76.7% for physical activity
as per the PAQ-C, 91.1% for sleep duration, and 77.8%
for screen time. Meeting recommendations for milk and
alternatives, meat and alternatives, free sugars, sleep,
and screen time all had significant univariate associa-
tions
with
meeting
expectations
for
mathematics
(Table 2, Model 1), while vegetables and fruit, grain
products, milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives,
saturated fat, and free sugars all had significant univari-
ate associations with meeting expectations for reading
(Table 3, Model 1). Meeting recommendations for vege-
tables and fruit, meat and alternatives, free sugars, phys-
ical activity, sleep and screen time all had significant
univariate associations with meeting expectations for
writing. Parental level of education, household income,
and gender were all significantly associated with the like-
lihood of meeting expectations for each subject, while
obesity only had a significant univariate association with
meeting expectations in mathematics.
After adjusting for potential confounders, meeting rec-
ommendations for milk and alternatives, meat and alter-
natives, and free sugars continued to have significant
positive associations with meeting recommendations for
mathematics
(Table
2,
Model
1).

 expectations for reading was the outcome, meeting rec-
ommendations for vegetables and fruit, grain products,
milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives, saturated
fat and free sugars were all associated with increased
likelihood of meeting expectations (Table 3, Model 1).
Finally, meeting recommendations for meat and alter-
natives, free sugars, sleep, and screen time were all
associated with increased likelihood of meeting expec-
tations for writing (Table 4, Model 1). Body weight
status did not have an association with any outcome
in these models.
When considering all lifestyle behaviors simultan-
eously, only meeting recommendations for milk and
alternatives, and meat and alternatives remained sig-
nificantly associated with meeting expectations for
mathematics;
meeting
recommendations
for
free
sugars was borderline significant (Table 2, Model 2:
OR: 1.20 [95% CI: 0.99, 1.45]). Meeting expectations
for grain products, milk and alternatives, meat and
alternatives, saturated fat and free sugars were all
positively associated with meeting expectations for reading
(Table 3, Model 2). Meeting recommendations for meat
and alternatives, free sugars, sleep, and screen time had
significant, positive associations with meeting expectations
for writing (Table 4, Model 2). Neither overweight
nor obesity demonstrated any association with meeting
expectations for any subject.
Considering the combined effect of the nine cri-
teria, for each additional criterion met, the odds of
meeting the expectations for mathematics was 1.13
times higher (OR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.20]). Table 5
shows that each additional criterion met also in-
creased odds of meeting recommendations for reading
by 1.26 times, (OR: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.17, 1.35]), and by
1.21 times for meeting recommendations in writing
(OR: 1.21 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.32]).
The criteria were also considered in groups represent-
ing low, medium, and high compliance. Respectively, 7.9,
64.6, and 27.4% were in the low, medium and high cat-
egories. Compared to the lowest category, children who
were in the highest category had 1.47 times the odds of
meeting expectations for mathematics (Table 5: OR: 1.47
[95% CI: 1.04, 2.06]), and 3.07 and 2.77 times the odds
for meeting expectations in reading and writing respect-
ively (Table 5: OR: 3.07, [95% CI: 2.09, 4.51], OR: 2.77
[95% CI: 1.83, 4.20]).
Discussion
We observed that meeting recommendations for diet,
sleep and screen time had independent, positive effects
for children’s academic achievement. No association was
found between meeting physical activity cutoffs and aca-
demic achievement. The findings from this study also
indicated that the combined effects of meeting multiple
lifestyle
behavior
recommendations
had
a
stronger
impact on academic achievement than the individual
effects of lifestyle behaviors, particularly for reading and
writing. We chose to evaluate lifestyle behaviors based

 on established recommendations that are widely ac-
cepted. Substantial efforts and resources go into the de-
velopment and promotion of these recommendations,
and findings from this study reveal that more efforts are
needed to achieve compliance not only for the benefit of
health, but for education.
The associations between dietary behaviors and aca-
demic achievement are supported by previous literature
[6, 7, 41–47]. However, the majority of studies linking
diet and academic achievement have tended to focus on
breakfast consumption and whole diet, and few studies
have evaluated the relationship between established diet-
ary recommendations and academic achievement [7]. In
particular, no study has evaluated the relationship be-
tween meeting newly released guidelines for free sugar
recommendations, which exhibited a strong positive as-
sociation with each of the three subjects. The lack of
association between vegetables and fruit and academic
achievement in this study seems inconsistent with
much of the literature investigating the association be-
tween diet and academic achievement [20, 48]. In previ-
ous studies, servings of vegetables and fruit have been
assessed as a continuous variable, with more servings
being positively associated with academic achievement.
In this study, very few children met the recommenda-
tion for vegetables and fruit. As such, there may not
have been sufficient power to detect any positive effect
of meeting recommendations for vegetables and fruit.
We conducted additional analyses treating servings of
vegetables and fruit as a continuous variable, however,
and no significant effect on academic achievement was
observed. Milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives,
and sugars consumption were more consistent predic-
tors of higher academic achievement. This may be a re-
flection of a higher income household that is more
likely to access and purchase products within these
groups more regularly [49].
The observation that meeting designated cutoffs for
physical activity levels associated with adequate cardio-
respiratory fitness is not significantly associated with
higher
academic
achievement
complements
existing
findings in the literature investigating the relationship of
physical activity with children’s school performance.
Much of the literature has concluded that the inclusion
of more physical activity and physical education relative
to other subjects in a school day does not negatively
affect school performance [11, 13, 16, 50]. Many studies
have found a relationship between children’s physical ac-
tivity levels and their academic achievement or cognitive
development [11, 13, 51–53] though few studies have
aimed to investigate its importance independent of other
lifestyle behaviors. Another study found that the rela-
tionship between physical activity and academic achieve-
ment to be curvilinear, suggesting that children who are
athletes may have many extra-curricular activities that
displace time spent on academics [54]. Though cutoff
values are useful in identifying sufficient levels of phys-
ical activity for physical health benefits, they may not be
the most appropriate way to assess the association be-
tween physical activity and academic achievement as this
relationship appears to be more complex. An analysis
was conducted using PAQ-C score as a continuous vari-
able (results not shown) and physical activity continued
to have no effect on academic achievement. However,
though the PAQ-C is a well-used and validated question-
naire, its intent is to provide a broad overview of chil-
dren’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels and
it does not provide detailed information about other in-
tensities or frequency of physical activities or the physio-
logical benefits children gain from regular physical
activity that would contribute to their academic achieve-
ment, among other contributors. In addition, there was
a time lag (1 year) between physical activity assessment
and exam writing which may have introduced error. The
PAQ-C measures regularly moderate-to-vigorous phys-
ical activity over a one week period which would not
adequately capture the variability in the frequency of phys-
ical activity over a 1 year period. As such, this lack of
association may be due to the limitations of the measure
used, and further investigation using a more detailed means
of measurement of children’s physical activity is needed.
Sleep and screen time have been previously associated
with academic achievement [10, 14, 55]. This is the sec-
ond study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the

 independent importance of meeting sleep recommen-
dations for these behaviors for academic achievement
[17]. In this study, sleep was found to only be associ-
ated with performance on writing exams. Sleep has
been shown to be crucial for creativity and insight, key
determinants of strong writing skills [56]. This study is
also among the first to evaluate sleep duration and aca-
demic achievement using the National Sleep Founda-
tion guideline [38]. Sleep is recommended within a
range of hours, not as a minimum number of hours,
and the finding that meeting these sleep recommenda-
tions is strongly associated with increased likelihood of
meeting academic expectations in writing highlights the
importance of both meeting the minimum require-
ments of sleep while not exceeding the maximum rec-
ommended number of hours [38, 57].
Few studies have investigated the association of body
weight status and lifestyle behaviors simultaneously to
determine their independent associations. Those that
have, provide indication that it is not weight status that
drives academic achievement, but that both academic
achievement and body weight status are a result of long-
term lifestyle behaviors [17, 18]. This study comple-
ments this important work and indicates that promoting
healthy lifestyles and values, rather than focusing on
obesity prevention and reduction, is most effective in
supporting optimal health, holistic wellness and aca-
demic achievement [23, 58–60].
Finally, the findings that the combined effects of life-
style behaviors result in substantially higher likelihood of
meeting expectations in all subjects is an important con-
tribution to the literature. Ickovics et al. noted similar
results in a sample of low-income American children of
the same age – children with higher levels of ‘health
assets’ including indicators of healthy diet, physical ac-
tivity, screen time and sleep, were 2.2 times more likely
to meet goals in mathematics, reading and writing com-
pared to those who had the fewest health assets [25]. A
Spanish study with the objective of investigating the
combined effects of meeting recommendations for diet,
physical activity, screen time and sleep on the self-
reported grades of adolescents had similar findings for
girls [17]. The present study complements and expands
on
these
important
findings
drawing
on
a
large,
population-based sample of children. Collectively, these
studies speak to the value of school-based health pro-
motion initiatives that are more comprehensive in their
approach compared to initiatives that address only sin-
gular aspects of health. Successful models of a compre-
hensive
school
health
approach
that
have
led
to
improvement in the healthfulness of children’s lifestyle
behaviors have been well-evaluated [31, 61]. Interven-
tions that aim to improve multiple lifestyle behaviors
may have a greater impact on academic achievement
than those that focus on single behaviors.
Of note is girls’ strong, positive association with the
likelihood of meeting expectations for reading and
writing. There was no gender effect for meeting expec-
tations in mathematics. These results are consistent
with other investigations about the school perform-
ance of girls and boys [62]. Stratified analyses by gen-
der revealed no substantial differences between effects
of individual lifestyle behaviors and academic achieve-
ment across gender (results not shown). Children’s test
scores are influenced by a multitude of factors, and dif-
ferential influences between girls and boys, including
self-confidence and parental support for specific career
streams, are among them [62]. Further investigation is
merited to determine the cause of the substantial gen-
der
differences
in
academic
achievement
in
this
population.
This study has several key strengths. First, it is a very
large, population-based sample of children who are rep-
resentative of an entire Canadian province. This study
evaluated lifestyle behaviors with respect to established
recommendations, which allows for easier interpretation
and specific targets for health promotion initiatives.
Non-response weighting was employed in order to ac-
count for non-response of students residing in lower-
income neighbourhoods in Nova Scotia. This study also
used results from standardized exams from several dif-
ferent subjects, both eliminating bias from self-reported

 grades and illustrating that lifestyle behaviors may have
differential effects for different cognitive tasks. This
study used validated questionnaires to assess diet and
physical activity as well as directly measured heights and
weights. Limitations of the study were the self-reported
nature of lifestyle behaviors that can be prone to bias.
The time lag between measurement of lifestyle behaviors
and the writing of standardized exams may have intro-
duced error to estimates of association. In the case of
screen time, only TV watching was captured in this ana-
lysis and other forms of screen-based media which may
be widely used were not included. In addition, questions
used to assess sleep and screen time where not validated.
As the CLASS study aims to collect a wide breadth of
information, shorter, non-validated questions were used
on surveys to reduce participant burden. Though a vali-
dated questionnaire was used to assess physical activity
levels, the PAQ-C does not provided information about
duration or intensity of physical activity, which is
thought to be important in terms of its influence on
academic achievement and relationship with meeting
recommendations. As such, a lack of association may
be due to the limited information provided by the tool
used. Provided the large scope of this study, objective
measurements of lifestyle behaviors were not feasible.
Finally, standardized tests are only one means by
which to evaluate children’s academic success and
their value has been disputed [63]. Investigations of
the relationship between healthy lifestyle behaviors
and other measures of academic success including en-
joyment of school, psycho-social well-being, and sense
of belonging are important complements to consider.
There is also possibility of residual confounding by
unmeasured variables including IQ and measures of
mental health.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that individual lifestyle be-
haviors have independent, positive associations with
academic achievement, and that cumulative effects of
multiple healthy lifestyle behaviors have a stronger
positive association with academic outcomes in Read-
ing and Writing than any individual association. These
findings suggest that school-based health promotion
approaches that address multiple lifestyle behaviors
instead of single behaviors may have more benefit for
academic achievement. Future studies investigating a
longitudinal link between lifestyle behaviors, body
weight and academic achievement are important to
strengthen the prospective findings of this study and
others similar to it.
