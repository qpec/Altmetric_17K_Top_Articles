ABSTRACT
Stress-induced abdominal dysfunction is an attractive target for probiotics. To investigate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacil-
lus casei strain Shirota on abdominal dysfunction, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with healthy medical
students undertaking an authorized nationwide examination for academic advancement. For 8 weeks, until the day before the
examination, 23 and 24 subjects consumed an L. casei strain Shirota-fermented milk and a placebo milk daily, respectively. In
addition to assessments of abdominal symptoms, psychophysical state, and salivary stress markers, gene expression changes in
peripheral blood leukocytes and composition of the gut microbiota were analyzed using DNA microarray analysis and 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequence analysis, respectively, before and after the intervention. Stress-induced increases in a visual analog scale
measuring feelings of stress, the total score of abdominal dysfunction, and the number of genes with changes in expression of
more than 2-fold in leukocytes were significantly suppressed in the L. casei strain Shirota group compared with those in the pla-
cebo group. A significant increase in salivary cortisol levels before the examination was observed only in the placebo group. The
administration of L. casei strain Shirota, but not placebo, significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated that the L. casei strain Shirota group had significantly higher numbers of species, a
marker of the alpha-diversity index, in their gut microbiota and a significantly lower percentage of Bacteroidaceae than the pla-
cebo group. Our findings indicate that the daily consumption of probiotics, such as L. casei strain Shirota, preserves the diversity
of the gut microbiota and may relieve stress-associated responses of abdominal dysfunction in healthy subjects exposed to
stressful situations.
IMPORTANCE
A novel clinical trial was conducted with healthy medical students under examination stress conditions. It was demonstrated
that the daily consumption of lactic acid bacteria provided health benefits to prevent the onset of stress-associated abdominal
symptoms and a good change of gut microbiota in healthy medical students.
T
he gut microbiota, a large, diverse, and dynamic ecosystem
that generates cross talk between the gut and host, can com-
municate with the host by modulating the gut-brain axis, which is
a bidirectional neurohumoral communication system between
the gut and brain. That is, signals from the brain modify the mo-
tor, sensory, and secretory modalities of the gastrointestinal tract;
in turn, signals from the gut can affect emotional behavior and
stress and pain modulation systems through neural, endocrine,
and immune pathways (1–3). Thus, the gut-brain axis has now
been expanded to the microbiota-gut-brain axis (3).
It is particularly interesting to consider the possibility that pro-
biotics (4), which are live microorganisms, can affect emotion in
health and disease by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis
(5) and confer a health benefit in the host. Previous animal studies
have demonstrated that the administration of probiotics main-
tains mucosal barrier function under stressful situations (6, 7) and
mitigates stress-induced glucocorticoid and inflammatory cyto-
kine responses in association with a reduction of depression- and
anxiety-related behavior (7–12). Probiotics have also been shown
to reduce the mRNA expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) receptor and c-Fos in the brain (10, 12), possibly by mod-
ulating the gut-brain axis via vagal pathways (10, 11). Clinical
trials have demonstrated that probiotics have beneficial effects by
alleviating psychological distress in healthy subjects (9) and nor-
malizing the stress-induced reduction of natural killer (NK) cell
numbers (13) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14). A brief natu-
ralistic stress, such as an academic examination, has been em-
ployed frequently to examine psychological stress responses (13,

 15–21). This model was also used to assess stress-associated alter-
ation of the gut microbiota (16) and the effects of prebiotics or
probiotics on gastrointestinal dysfunction and/or upper respira-
tory tract infections (18, 20).
Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota is a well-known probiotic
strain that has been approved and is generally recognized as safe by
the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. L. casei
strain Shirota has been suggested to provide health benefits by
balancing the gut microbiota, improving gastrointestinal dysfunc-
tion, preventing infection and cancer, and modulating inflamma-
tory and immune responses (22). Previous studies have demon-
strated that L. casei strain Shirota improves mood disturbances in
the elderly (23) and decreases anxiety symptoms in patients with
chronic fatigue syndrome (24), and in a pilot trial, it suppressed
the onset of physical symptoms in healthy students exposed to
academic stress (21). However, it has not been examined fully
whether L. casei strain Shirota relieves psychological stress-in-
duced responses associated with the microbiota-gut-brain axis of
healthy subjects.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group
clinical trial was conducted to examine the effect of a fermented
milk containing L. casei strain Shirota on stress-induced abdomi-
nal dysfunction as a primary endpoint as well as on psychophysi-
cal state, salivary stress markers, gene expression changes in pe-
ripheral leukocytes, and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of
the gut microbiota in healthy medical students undertaking an
authorized nationwide examination for academic advancement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Test beverages. Test beverages included milk fermented with L. casei
strain Shirota YIT 9029, obtained from the Culture Collection Research
Laboratory of Yakult Central Institute (Tokyo, Japan), and placebo milk,
i.e., nonfermented milk with the same nutritional content, color, flavor,
taste, and pH as the L. casei strain Shirota-fermented milk (see Table S1 in
the supplemental material) (21). The beverages were distributed and
stored at 0 to 10°C. The L. casei strain Shirota-fermented milk contained L.
casei strain Shirota at more than 1.0 � 1011 CFU per 100-ml bottle during
the intervention.
Subjects. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid
down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human
subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tokushima
University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan. Written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment. Subjects included 54 4th-
grade medical students at Tokushima University, Japan, undertaking an
authorized nationwide (computer-based) examination for academic ad-
vancement, covering all subjects in basic and clinical medicine. As de-
scribed previously (17, 19, 21), in Japan, passing the examination is re-
quired for promotion to the clinical bedside training level (the 5th grade).
This 1-day examination is one of the most stressful events for all Japanese
medical students. Of the 54 students recruited, 5 were excluded on the
basis of the following criteria: age of �30 years, habitual smoking, taking
medication for 3 months prior to enrollment, mental disease and/or other
diseases, or milk or other food allergies. Thus, 49 students (27 males and
22 females) participated in this study. During the trial, the subjects com-
plied with dietary restrictions to avoid the consumption of other fer-
mented milks, yogurt, lactic acid bacteria beverages, and probiotic or
prebiotic products. Medications and hospital visits were allowed and were
recorded in a diary.
Design. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group trial was
registered to the university hospital medical information network (UMIN)
clinical trials registry. The registered number was UMIN000011926. The trial
wasconductedfromOctober2013toJanuary2014.Accordingtoitsrandom-
ized design, the subjects were allocated to the L. casei strain Shirota or pla-
cebo group based on their background data as shown in Table 1. A 100-ml
bottle of either fermented milk containing L. casei strain Shirota or pla-
cebo milk was taken daily for 8 weeks until the day before the examina-
tion. Daily consumption was self-recorded in a diary to check the compli-
ance rate of consumption. The trial was composed of a preintervention
period of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 8 weeks, and a postinterven-
tion period (postexamination period) of 2 weeks (Fig. 1).
Abdominal dysfunction. The subjects answered a questionnaire to
evaluate five common abdominal symptoms, “abdominal discomfort and
pain,” “feeling of incomplete evacuation,” “abdominal distention,”
“straining during bowel movement,” and “gastric pain,” with scoring for
each symptom in every week during the experimental period as follows: 0,
none; 1, light; 2, medium; 3, severe; and 4, very severe. Every 2 weeks
during the experimental period, the total abdominal dysfunction score,
which was the sum of each score, for each subject was analyzed as the
primary endpoint. Each symptom score was also analyzed as a sub-end-
point of abdominal dysfunction. Moreover, gastrointestinal dysfunction
was evaluated using the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS)
(Japanese version) (25), showing that higher scores indicate more severe
symptoms. The total score and five subscale scores on the GSRS—acid
reflux syndrome, abdominal pain syndrome, indigestion syndrome, diar-
rhea syndrome, and constipation syndrome—were analyzed every 2
weeks during the experimental period.
Psychological parameters. The subjects answered questionnaires
from the Japanese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
(26) to evaluate state and trait anxiety levels during the experimental
period and the Japanese version of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-
FFI) (27) to evaluate five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion,
openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) at the time of screening.
Feelings of stress were surveyed using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0
mm for no stress to 100 mm for the most severe stress with an intolerable
feeling every 2 weeks during the experimental period.
Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase. Saliva was collected for 2 min
between 16:00 and 17:00 to avoid diurnal fluctuations using a Salivette
sampling device (Sarstedt, Inc., Rommelsdorf, Germany) prior to blood
collection (17). After storage at �80°C, salivary cortisol levels and alpha-
amylase activity were assayed using a commercial enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay kit (Salimetrics LLC, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
NK cells in blood. Peripheral venous blood was taken between 16:00
and 17:00 after the collection of saliva. NK cell activity was analyzed and
the number of NK cells (CD3� CD16� CD56�) in peripheral blood

 mononuclear cells was determined by chromium release assay using 51Cr-
labeled K562 as a target cell and by flow cytometry, respectively, as de-
scribed previously (28).
DNA microarray. According to the previously reported method (29),
gene expression and pathway analyses in peripheral leukocytes were con-
ducted for 12 male subjects in each group. DNA microarray analysis was
performed using high-quality total RNA purified leukocytes, a whole hu-
man genome oligonucleotide DNA microarray (SurePrint G3 Human GE
8 � 60K v2; Agilent), a G2565BA microarray scanner (Agilent), and Fea-
ture Extraction 10 software (Agilent). Using GeneSpring GX 10 (v11.5.1;
Agilent), 19,194 probes with fluorescence intensities higher than the cut-
off value of 50 among all samples were analyzed. The total number of
genes that changed their mean expression levels by more than 2-fold com-
pared (P � 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test) with the baseline was counted.
Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity pathway analysis
(IPA) software (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa) to identify bio-
logical functions related to differentially expressed genes.
Living fecal Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. According to the pre-
viously reported method (21), the numbers of living fecal L. casei strain
Shirota CFU per gram of feces, collected 8 weeks before (baseline), 2 weeks
before, 3 to 1 days before, and 2 weeks after the examination, were deter-
mined by the culture method using a lactitol-LBS-vancomycin (LLV) agar
medium, and the strain was identified by colony PCR using an L. casei
strain Shirota-specific PCR primer set.
Amplicon sequencing of the gut microbiota targeting the 16S rRNA
gene. The gut microbiota was analyzed by amplicon analysis targeting the
16S rRNA gene. A DNA library was prepared from the collected fecal
samples, sequenced, and analyzed. Briefly, the V1 to V2 region of the 16S
rRNA gene of the gut microbiota was amplified using the primer set
27Fmod2-MiSeqV2 and 338RMiSeqV2-001 (see Table S2 in the supple-
mental material) (30) to monitor DNA amplification in a 7500 real-time
PCR (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Japan, Tokyo, Japan). PCR
was terminated before the amplification curves reached a plateau. The
amplified DNA was purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beck-
man Coulter, Tokyo, Japan), quantified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dou-
ble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) assay kit (Life Technologies Japan), diluted,
and sequenced using a MiSeq system (Illumina, Tokyo, Japan). Compo-
sition and the number of observed species of gut microbiota were deter-
mined using QIIME software (31).
Questionnaires about lifestyle and general health. At the time of
screening, lifestyle was assessed with a questionnaire using the Japanese
version of the health practice index (HPI) (32). General health was eval-
uated with a questionnaire using the Japanese version of the General
Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) during the experimental period (33).
Other questionnaires. At the end of the trial, questionnaires were
administered regarding influenza vaccination, habitual consumption of
probiotics or yogurt before starting the trial, and the feeling of the severity
of examination grind. The question “Which do you think you took, active
or placebo?” was also asked.
Statistical analysis. The data are shown as means plus or minus stan-
dard errors (SEs). All data were analyzed using SAS preclinical package
v5.0 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Questionnaire data at each point
were analyzed by Wilcoxon’s rank sum test between the groups and by
Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test within a group. Questionnaire data
and feelings of stress according to VAS were analyzed by two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) between the groups during the experimental pe-
riod. The salivary and fecal data were analyzed by the unpaired Student’s
t test between the groups and by Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test
within a group. The relative change of gene expression was also analyzed
by the unpaired Student’s t test within a group. The number of subjects in
the questionnaire data and genes with expression changes were analyzed
by Fisher’s exact test within and between the groups. Data from the 16S
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were analyzed by Wilcoxon’s signed-
rank test within a group and by the Mann-Whitney U test between the
groups. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate
statistical significance.
RESULTS
Inclusion of subjects. Of the 54 subjects who consented, 5 were
excluded due to habitual smoking (2 students), an age of 30 years
or older (2 students), and abnormally high scores for the STAI-trait
andGHQ-28(1student).Theremaining49subjectswereallocatedto
the placebo group (25 subjects) or the L. casei strain Shirota group
(24 subjects). There were no differences between the two groups in
thefollowingbackgrounddataatthetimeofscreening:age,sex,body
massindex(BMI),STAI-statescore,STAI-traitscore,GHQ-28score,
HPI score, NEO-FFI score, and salivary cortisol level. In addition, 2
students dropped out before consumption of the test beverages for
personal reasons. Finally, 24 and 23 students, who took the test bev-
erages, were included in the placebo and L. casei strain Shirota
groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the
background data between the two groups, and no subjects had ab-
normal background data at the time of screening (Table 1).

 shown in Table 2, in the L. casei strain Shirota group, living L. casei
strain Shirota was detected in all fecal samples collected at 2 weeks
and a few days before the examination. The mean logarithmic
CFU value per gram of feces was 7.5. In contrast, in the placebo
group, living L. casei strain Shirota was detected in 1 to 3 subjects
during the trial. Their mean logarithmic CFU values per gram of
feces ranged from 3.5 to 4.3. There were no significant differences
in the numbers of L. casei strain Shirota-positive subjects and the
average numbers of L. casei strain Shirota CFU between the two
groups before and at 2 weeks after intervention. The average num-
ber of L. casei strain Shirota CFU in the L. casei strain Shirota
group approximately coincided with that in a previous report (21,
34), indicating that this trial was performed in compliance with
the consumption of test beverages in subjects.
Psychological and physiological parameters. Figure 2A
through D show the time-dependent changes in the STAI-state
scores, feelings of stress according to the VAS, salivary cortisol
levels, and alpha-amylase activities in saliva, respectively, during
the experimental period. In the two groups, the STAI-state scores
were within normal levels 8 weeks before the examination (base-
line), were significantly elevated by approximately 10 points 1 day
before the examination compared with baseline scores (each P �
0.05, Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test), and returned to base-
line scores at 2 weeks after the examination. There was no signif-
icant difference in the STAI-state scores between the two groups.
The VAS measuring feelings of stress also peaked at 7 to 8 weeks
(corresponding to 0 to 2 weeks before the examination) and de-
creased rapidly after the examination. During the experimental
period, the administration of L. casei strain Shirota significantly
lowered VAS results compared with those of the placebo control
(P � 0.05, two-way ANOVA). Salivary cortisol levels increased
significantly (P � 0.05, Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test) 1
day before the examination in the placebo group compared with
the baseline levels, while no significant elevation of salivary corti-

amylase activity in saliva at each time point in the two groups
during the experimental period.
Abdominal dysfunction and the GSRS. Figure 3A and B show
the time-dependent changes in the total scores of abdominal dys-
function and GSRS, respectively. Although the total score seemed
to increase at 7 to 8 weeks (1 to 2 weeks before the examination) in
the placebo group, there was no significant change in this score. In
contrast, the administration of L. casei strain Shirota gradually
reduced abdominal dysfunction; the abdominal dysfunction score
was significantly lower in the L. casei strain Shirota group than in
the placebo group during the experimental period (P � 0.05, two-
way ANOVA). In a similar manner, the total GSRS score remained
constant in the placebo group, while it decreased after starting L.
casei strain Shirota administration and was significantly lower at 5
to 6 weeks and during the postintervention period than the base-
line score (preintervention) (each P � 0.05, Dunnett’s multiple-
comparison test).
The changes in the scores of “abdominal discomfort and pain”
were analyzed separately in the symptom-free subjects during the
preintervention period (the placebo group, n � 9; the L. casei
strain Shirota group, n � 14) (Fig. 3C) and in subjects who already
complained of these symptoms at that time (the placebo group,
n � 15; the L. casei strain Shirota group, n � 8) (Fig. 3D). In the
subjects without symptoms during the preintervention period,
scores increased in the placebo group but not in the L. casei strain
Shirota group during the experimental period. Consequently, the
scores were significantly lower in the L. casei strain Shirota group
than in the placebo group during the intervention and postinter-
vention periods (P � 0.01, two-way ANOVA). Furthermore, in
the subjects with symptoms during the preintervention period,
scores did not change in the placebo group during the interven-
tion period, while they decreased in the L. casei strain Shirota
group. Consequently, scores were significantly lower in the L. casei
strain Shirota group than in the placebo group during the inter-
vention and postintervention periods (P � 0.05, two-way
ANOVA).

cant differences in the activity and numbers of NK cells between
the two groups at any time point.
DNA microarray. To analyze changes in gene expression in
circulating leukocytes during the experimental period, we as-
sessed gene expression profiles 8 weeks before (baseline) or 2
weeks after the examination to identify a suitable control. In the
two groups, the relative changes in gene expression became more
extensive 2 weeks after the examination compared with that at
baseline, suggesting that the altered gene expression in leukocytes
did not return fully to baseline at 2 weeks after the examination
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, the baseline was used as a control in the
subsequent analysis.
The stressful situation significantly changed the expression lev-
els of �100 genes during the preexamination period that then
started to return to the baseline profile immediately after the ex-
amination in the placebo group. One day before the examination,
the 179 differentially expressed genes in the placebo group were
subjected to canonical pathway and functional enrichment anal-
yses using the IPA software. IPA ranked “FXR/RXR activation”
and “adipogenesis pathway” as the top two canonical pathways
and “lipid metabolism” as the top of the diseases and bio-func-
tions (see Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material). Expres-
sion of a similar group of genes was changed in the L. casei strain
Shirota group (Table S3). However, L. casei strain Shirota admin-
istration significantly reduced the number of stress-responsive
genes 1 day before (86 genes in the L. casei strain Shirota group
versus 179 genes in placebo group; P � 0.001, Fisher’s exact test)

ination, the percentage of Bacteroidaceae was significantly lower in
the L. casei strain Shirota group than in the placebo group (P �
0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, the number of observed
species was significantly higher in the L. casei strain Shirota group
than in the placebo group before the examination (P � 0.05,
Mann-Whitney U test) but not at baseline. Finally, there was a
significantly higher value of phylogenic diversity, as another mea-
sure of the alpha-diversity index, in the L. casei strain Shirota
group than in the placebo group before the examination (P �
0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) but not at baseline (data not shown).
The correlation coefficients between the change in the number
of observed species and the change in other markers during the
intervention period were analyzed. Although the change in the
number of observed species was significantly and positively cor-
related with that of the percentage of Firmicutes (P � 0.001, Pear-
son product-moment correlation coefficient), the other parame-
ters did not show significant correlation with the number of
observed species (data not shown).
To further understand the biological meanings of the changes
in gut microbiota, the Shannon index was calculated, as another
measure of the alpha-diversity index, separately in the symptom-
free subjects during the preintervention period (9 students in the
placebo group and 14 students in the L. casei strain Shirota group)
and in subjects who already complained of abdominal symptoms
at that time (15 students in the placebo group and 8 students in the
L. casei strain Shirota group). As shown in Table S5 in the supple-
mental material, in the absence of preexisting abdominal symp-
toms, the Shannon index decreased during the preexamination
period in the placebo group (P � 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test), whereas it remained constant in the L. casei strain Shirota
group. Consequently, the Shannon index was significantly differ-
ent between the two groups (P � 0.05 by Mann-Whitney U test)
(Table S5). In contrast, we did not detect such differences in sub-
jects who already complained of abdominal symptoms during the
preintervention period (Table S5).
Other questionnaires. There were no significant time-depen-
dent changes in the total score of the GHQ-28 in each group and
between the two groups at each time point. Subanalysis found that
the score for anxiety and insomnia increased significantly imme-
diately after the examination in only the placebo group, while it
was at a constant level in the L. casei strain Shirota group during
the experimental period (P � 0.05, Dunnett’s multiple-compari-
son test) (see Table S6 in the supplemental material). However,
there was no significant difference between the two groups (Wi-
lcoxon’s rank sum test).
Between the two groups, there were no significant differences

 in the rate of vaccination against influenza, the habitual consump-
tion of probiotics and yogurt before the trial, and the feeling of the
severity of examination grind. For the question “Which did you
take, active or placebo?” at the end of the trial, the numbers of
subjects who answered active, placebo, and unknown were 10, 7,
and 7, respectively, in the placebo group (n � 24) and 7, 7, and 9,
respectively, in the L. casei strain Shirota group (n � 23), suggest-
ing that there was no significant difference in the accuracy rates of
the answers between the two groups (P � 0.1, Fisher’s exact test)
(see Table S7 in the supplemental material). Moreover, there was
no significant difference in the examination pass rates between the
two groups (data not shown). Thus, we confirmed that there was
no bias in this double-blind trial.
DISCUSSION
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group trial was
conducted to examine the effects of a fermented milk containing
the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota on the psychological, physio-
logical, and physical stress responses of healthy medical students
undertaking an authorized, nationwide examination for academic
advancement, which has been used as a brief naturalistic stress
model (17, 19, 21). We focused on stress-induced abdominal dys-
function as the primary endpoint. In addition, we examined
whether L. casei strain Shirota administration affected gene ex-
pression profiles in peripheral leukocytes and how L. casei strain
Shirota modified the stress-induced changes in the composition of
the gut microbiota. The present study demonstrated that the daily
consumption of L. casei strain Shirota significantly reduced ab-
dominal dysfunction, the VAS measuring feelings of stress, and
gene expression changes and preserved the alpha-diversity index
of the gut microbiota compared with those of the placebo control.
In the placebo group, the STAI-state score, the VAS measuring
feelings of stress, and the salivary cortisol level increased with a
peak at 1 day before the examination. Consistent with previous
studies (17, 19, 21), the psychological and physiological stress pa-
rameters observed in this study also support the observation that
students display maximum stress responses on the day before an
examination, demonstrating the validity of the present stress
model.
The GSRS is used widely to assess the symptoms of irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia, both of which
are aggravated under stressful conditions (25). In fact, brief natu-
ralistic stress is directly related to the onset of symptoms of gas-
trointestinal dysfunction (14, 18). Subanalysis of the items of ab-
dominal dysfunction (see Table S8 in the supplemental material)
and the GSRS (see Table S9 in the supplemental material) showed
that the scores for “abdominal discomfort and pain” in the former
as well as for “indigestion” and “diarrhea” in the latter increased at
1 to 2 weeks before the examination in the placebo group and that
the daily consumption of L. casei strain Shirota resulted in a ten-
dency toward improvement in “abdominal discomfort and pain”
as assessed by the abdominal dysfunction score and a significant
improvement of “indigestion” as assessed by the GSRS score.
Moreover, stratified analysis of “abdominal discomfort and pain”
revealed that the daily consumption of L. casei strain Shirota not
only prevented its onset in the symptom-free subjects but also
improved “abdominal discomfort and pain” in those subjects who
already complained of these symptoms during the preinterven-
tion period. In addition, the augmentation of salivary cortisol level
was suppressed in the L. casei strain Shirota group in this study.
Therefore, direct action of L. casei strain Shirota on stress re-
sponses may be involved in the alleviation of gastrointestinal dys-
function in healthy medical students exposed to academic stress.
The serotonergic system may be one of the potential nodes in
the regulation of the gut-brain axis (35). Recently, the gut micro-
biota was reported to influence tryptophan metabolism and sero-
tonin biosynthesis (35, 36). In addition, 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequence analysis of gut microbiota showed that IBS patients had
reduced diversity in the gut microbiota (37, 38) and higher per-
centages of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level of microbiota in
lower intestinal mucosa compared with those of healthy controls
and that probiotic treatment increased the percentage to the
healthy control level (38). Moreover, the gut microbiota of pa-
tients with depression reportedly shows higher percentages of
Bacteroidaceae and lower percentages of Lachnospiraceae at the
family level compared with those of healthy controls (39). On the
basis of these findings, we examined the effects of L. casei strain
Shirota on the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA gene amplicon se-
quence analysis and found that the percentage of Bacteroidetes at
the phylum level tended to increase before the examination only
in the placebo group. The daily consumption of L. casei strain
Shirota significantly reduced the percentage of Bacteroidaceae at
the family level. The L. casei strain Shirota-induced changes in
Bacteroidaceae may be associated with the improvement of ab-
dominal dysfunction in our subjects. The present study also re-
vealed that the number of microbiota species, observed as a mea-
sure of the alpha-diversity index, was significantly higher in the L.
casei strain Shirota group than in the placebo group before the
examination, which was similar between the two groups before
the intervention. A recent report demonstrated that probiotic
treatment increases the Shannon index in healthy subjects (40).
Additional analysis in the present study demonstrated that the
consumption of L. casei strain Shirota suppressed not only the
onset of abdominal dysfunction but also the decrease in Shannon
index under academic examination stress compared with con-
sumption of a placebo; however, these effects were observed in the
23 subjects who were symptom free during the preintervention
period but not in the 24 subjects who already complained of ab-
dominal symptoms at that time. Therefore, it is possible to spec-
ulate that the onset of abdominal dysfunction may be associated
with the decrease in alpha diversity of gut microbiota in healthy,
abdominal symptom-free adults. Thus, the alpha-diversity index
may be a potential marker for the association between the gut
microbiota and physiological changes not only in IBS patients but
also in healthy young adults exposed to brief naturalistic stressors.
We also assessed the stress response in a different way by mea-
suring the time-dependent changes in gene expression in periph-
eral leukocytes using a whole human genome array. The expres-
sion levels of approximately 100 genes changed by 2-fold in the L.
casei strain Shirota and placebo groups compared with those mea-
sured at 2 weeks before the examination. In the placebo group, the
number of stress-responsive genes increased to 179 genes, whereas
the daily consumption of L. casei strain Shirota almost completely
prevented the additional changes in gene expression. The pathway
analysis of the 179 stress-responsive genes showed that the aca-
demic examination preferentially affected a group of genes related
to lipid metabolism (e.g., ERCC2, FGF1, PPARGC1A, RARA,
SREBF1). Interestingly, our previous study revealed that L. casei
strain Shirota attenuated lipid metabolism via suppression of
sympathetic nerve activity (41). The L. casei strain Shirota admin-

 istration prevented the additional changes in gene expression lev-
els, including those of lipid metabolism-related genes (ERCC2,
FGF1, PPARGC1A). These results suggest that L. casei strain Shi-
rota administration may suppress the systemic stress response
when confronted with academic stress, which may be associated
with the reduction of feelings of stress assessed by the VAS and
abdominal dysfunction.
The activity of NK cells is also known to be changed by acute
psychological stress (42) and to be reduced by an increase in cor-
tisol levels (43). In the present study, NK cell activity was main-
tained at a relatively high level during the preexamination period
but was reduced immediately after the examination in the two
groups. Although there was no significant difference in NK cell
activity between groups, L. casei strain Shirota consumption pre-
vented the significant reduction of NK cell activity immediately
after the examination and the significant decline of NK cell num-
bers at 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the examination, all of
which were observed in the placebo group. It has been demon-
strated that L. casei strain Shirota recovers NK cell activity in sub-
jects with low NK cell activity (44). Therefore, it is possible to
speculate that daily L. casei strain Shirota consumption may pre-
serve NK cell function under stressful situations.
The major limitation of this study was its lack of statistical
power because of its small sample of participants. Around 100
students in each medical school in Japan are challenging the ex-
amination for academic advancement every year, and about half
of the students are cooperative. Hence, further studies with larger
numbers of participants, such as pooled analysis based on re-
peated trials, are necessary to clarify the effect of L. casei strain
Shirota on stress-induced abdominal dysfunction, changes in NK
cell activity and gut microbiota, and the associations between
these effects. Moreover, because of the complex interactions ex-
isting between probiotics and the host, the complete mechanisms
of action for L. casei strain Shirota remain unknown. Further stud-
ies are needed to establish the stress-relieving effects of L. casei
strain Shirota.
In conclusion, the daily consumption of probiotics, such as L.
casei strain Shirota, preserves the diversity of the gut microbiota
and may relieve the stress-associated psychological, physiological,
and physical stress responses to prevent the onset of common
abdominal dysfunction and to maintain the quality of life in
healthy subjects exposed to brief naturalistic stressors.
