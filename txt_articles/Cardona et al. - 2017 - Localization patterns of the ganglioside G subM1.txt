Semen analysis lacks a functional component and best identifies extreme cases of infertility. The
ganglioside GM1 is known to have functional roles during capacitation and acrosome exocytosis.
Here, we assessed whether GM1 localization patterns (Cap-Score™) correspond with male
fertility in different settings: Study 1 involved couples pursuing assisted reproduction in a tertiary
carefertility clinic,while Study 2 involvedmenwith known fertility versus those questioning their
fertility at a local urology center. In Study 1, we examined various thresholds versus clinical
history for 42 patients; 13 had Cap-Scores ≥39.5%, with 12 of these (92.3%) achieving clinical
pregnancy by natural conception or ≤3 intrauterine insemination cycles. Of the 29 patients
scoring <39.5%, only six (20.7%) attained clinical pregnancy by natural conception or ≤3
intrauterine insemination cycles. In Study 2, Cap-Scores were obtained from 76 fertile men
(Cohort 1, pregnant partner or recent father) and compared to 122 men seeking fertility
assessment (Cohort 2). Cap-Score values were normally distributed in Cohort 1, with 13.2%
having Cap-Scores more than one standard deviation below the mean (35.3 ± 7.7%).
Significantly, more men in Cohort 2 had Cap-Scores greater than one standard deviation below
the normal mean (33.6%; p = 0.001). Minimal/no relationship was found between Cap-Score and
sperm concentration, morphology, or motility. Together, these data demonstrate that Cap-Score

| INTRODUCTION
Infertility, the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of
unprotected intercourse, affects around 10–15% of couples around
the world (Sharma, Biedenharn, Fedor, & Agarwal, 2013). Studies
suggest that 50% of infertility cases are due to a female factor,
20–30% due to a male factor, and the remaining 20–30% are a
combination of both (Agarwal, Mulgund, Hamada, & Chyatte, 2015).
Abbreviations: GM1, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside; [Non]Cap, incubated with [without] capacitation stimuli.

 This is a global problem, with male factor reported to contribute to
between 50% and 70% of cases of infertility in several regions, and
with rates of male infertility ranging from 2.5% to 12% (Agarwal et al.,
2015). In the United States, 7.5% of men aged 45 years or younger
(3.3–4.7 million men) reported seeing a fertility doctor (Chandra,
Martinez, Mosher, Abma, & Jones, 2005). Despite the enormous and
growing importance of male factor infertility worldwide, diagnostic
assays for male fertility remain inadequate; the lack of sperm function
tests is a particular deficit (Lamb, 2010; Oehninger, Franken, &
Ombelet, 2014; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014).
The diagnosis of male infertility is currently heavily based on
results of standard semen analysis, which includes the evaluation of
sperm morphology, concentration, and motility. The World Health
Organization establishes and updates reference values for standard
semen analysis in an attempt to distinguish normal from abnormal
ejaculates (World Health Organization, 2010). Normal measures are
defined as sperm concentration of ≥15 × 106/ml, total motility of
≥40%, and morphology (Krueger strict criteria) as ≥4% normal forms
(Cooper et al., 2010; World Health Organization, 2010).
However, a methodological concern with the generation and use
of these 2010 World Health Organization values exists. Although the
lower reference limits (5th percentile) were obtained utilizing data
generated from a population of 4,500 fertile men from 14 countries
(Cooper et al., 2010), data from potential subfertile/infertile men were
not taken into account. Evidence of the inadequacy of semen analysis
to reflect male fertility status is raised by clinical studies highlighting
the absence of correlation between semen analysis results and ability
to fertilize (Guzick et al., 2001; Ombelet et al., 1997; van der Steeg
et al., 2011). In fact, van der Steeg et al. (2011) showed that men with
normal and
abnormal
semen
parameters were comparable
in
generating spontaneous pregnancies. This group argued that semen
analysis still has value, but the individual parameters must be used in
aggregate with one another, as opposed to being considered in terms
of simple cut-offs (van der Steeg et al., 2011).
Another factor contributing to concern about the utility of semen
analysis is the high variability among different ejaculates from the
same individual. An intra-individual variability of 34% in sperm
concentration was observed when at least three ejaculates were
examined, and the coefficient of variation remained high even when
factors such as abstinence and fever were taken into account (Carlsen,
Petersen, Andersson, & Skakkebaek, 2004). Another study reported
very similar results, showing a variance of 54% for concentration and
74% for motility index (Mallidis, Howard, & Baker, 1991). Together,
these findings on the descriptive and varying nature of the parameters
of semen analysis led to an understanding that the majority of infertile
men have defects in sperm function. These, unfortunately, are only
diagnosed by repeated failed cycles of intrauterine insemination
(Aboulghar et al., 2001; Tournaye, 2012).
One aspect of sperm function that has received much attention as
the potential basis for a diagnostic assay is the process of sperm
functional maturation known as “capacitation.” During capacitation,
sperm acquire the ability to fertilize an egg. In vivo, sperm capacitation
occurs while the sperm travel through the female reproductive tract
(Austin, 1951, 1952; Chang, 1951). Along this journey, sperm respond
to stimuli and a series of molecular events renders them fertilization
competent (Austin, 1952; Travis & Kopf, 2002). Some of these
molecular events include cholesterol efflux and subsequent changes in
plasma membrane composition and fluidity (Davis, Byrne, & Hungund,
1979; Visconti et al., 1999), such as altered dynamics of cholesterol
and the ganglioside GM1 in the plasma membrane overlying the
acrosome (Buttke, Nelson, Schlegel, Hunnicutt, & Travis, 2006;
Selvaraj et al., 2006, 2007, 2009). Both cholesterol efflux and focal
enrichment of GM1 were shown to trigger transient calcium influx
through a voltage-gated channel in mouse sperm (Cohen et al., 2014).
These transients are required for sperm to undergo acrosome
exocytosis, which is a process necessary for spermatozoa to penetrate
and fertilize the egg (Cohen et al., 2014).
While investigating the role that GM1 plays in capacitation, we
noted that GM1 localization occurred in specific and reproducible
patterns in both murine and bovine sperm that responded to stimuli for
capacitation versus those that either were not incubated with the
stimuli or could not respond to them (Selvaraj et al., 2007).
Furthermore,
we demonstrated that
sperm
showing the
GM1
localization pattern associated with capacitation represented the
subpopulation that could undergo acrosome exocytosis and therefore
were capable of fertilization (Selvaraj et al., 2007). Based on these
results, we performed studies with human sperm, finding localization
patterns similar to those in the bull (Neri et al., 2013; Paniza, Neri,
Rosenwaks, & Palermo, 2014; Selvaraj et al., 2007). We subsequently
found that those human sperm undergoing acrosome exocytosis
stemmed from the subpopulation having GM1 localization patterns
corresponding with capacitation. We also found that those sperm
having “capacitated” GM1 localization patterns showed evidence of
communication between the plasma and outer acrosomal membranes,
which was not seen in sperm having a “non-capacitated” GM1
localization pattern (Moody et al., 2017). These data substantiated
the accuracy of the assay at the single-sperm level; namely, those
sperm having a capacitated GM1 localization pattern were indeed
capacitated (Moody et al., 2017). Based on these and other data
regarding the precision and repeatability of the assay, we defined the
Cap-Score™ as the percentage of sperm having GM1 localization
patterns consistent with capacitation in relation to the total number of
sperm having GM1 localization patterns.
Here, we set out to determine whether the Cap-Score could be
used to indicate the fertility status of men, and therefore provide the
basis for an in vitro, laboratory-developed diagnostic test of male
fertility that specifically assayed sperm capacitation and functional
ability to fertilize. If positive, these results would contribute to the
validation of the assay (Moody et al., 2017) by providing information
about the clinical accuracy, or fit-for-purpose. Historically, several
assays designed to test sperm function were shown to correlate with
one or more of the traditional semen analysis parameters, limiting
the additional value they provided to diagnostic efforts (Aitken,
2002; Giwercman et al., 2003; Hazary, Chaudhuri, & Wishart, 2001;
Zini et al., 2009). We therefore also evaluated whether GM1
localization patterns correlated with any of the standard semen
analysis parameters or instead added distinct, complementary
information.

| RESULTS
2.1 | Experimental design
The correspondence of GM1 localization patterns in sperm with
capacitation status was previously identified in the Travis lab, at
Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine (Selvaraj et al., 2007). Here,
we provide data from two distinct studies: Study 1 was a post-hoc
association between capacitation and fertilization, performed inde-
pendently at the Ronald O. Perelman & Claudia Cohen Center for
Reproductive Medicine & Infertility, Weill Cornell Medical College,
New York. Study 2 involved a cohort comparison of 76 fertile men
(Cohort 1) versus 122 men questioning their fertility (Cohort 2),
performed at Androvia LifeSciences’ research laboratory in Mountain-
side, New Jersey. The involvement of different settings provided
several advantages: (i) the experiments testing clinical utility were
performed independently at Weill Cornell Medical College, reducing
the potential for conflict of interest; (ii) the different sites had highly
different patient populations in terms of age and what was known
about the fertility status of the pregnant partner; and (iii) this design
showed that the assay could function in both commercial and clinical
settings.
For Study 1, Dr. Travis and his staff trained Dr. Palermo and his
team at the Ronald O. Perelman & Claudia Cohen Center for
Reproductive Medicine & Infertility to perform the assay. Conflict of
interest was avoided and objectivity was maintained by having
Dr. Palermo and his laboratory independently identify and consent all
men, collect all histories, and perform all sample handling, semen
analysis, incubations, and data collection without any input from Dr.
Travis, his lab at Cornell, or Androvia LifeSciences, LLC. In fact, all Cap-
Score data from Study 1 were acquired before Androvia LifeSciences
formed and licensed the underlying technology from Cornell.
In Study 2, presumed fertile men (Cohort 1) were recruited,
consented, and produced samples at Androvia LifeSciences’ research
laboratory. Potential subfertile/infertile patients (Cohort 2) were
identified and consented at the Urology Group of New Jersey, where
semen analyses were also performed; these men were typically being
evaluated as part of a couple experiencing fertility problems, and no
attempt was made to identify or remove cases in which fertility of the
female partner might have been compromised. In this way, we could
evaluate if defects in capacitation are sufficiently widespread in men
questioning their fertility such that this functional test would be
appropriate as part of an initial fertility screen or instead would be
performed only as part of a more detailed work-up for patients in
whom infertility is already strongly suspected. Aliquots of the raw
ejaculates were transported to Androvia LifeSciences’ research
laboratory in an insulated box containing a warm pack to maintain
approximate body temperature. Transportation of samples averaged
30 min, which counted towards total liquefaction time.
2.2 | Men able to conceive naturally or via
intrauterine insemination produced a greater
percentage of sperm capable of capacitation
Of the 63 patients for whom data were collected in Study 1, clinical
fertility data were available for 42. Twenty-four of these 42 men either
had no history of clinical pregnancy (except in vitro fertilization or
intracytoplasmic sperm injection, results of which were not assessed
here by design) or required greater than four cycles to achieve
pregnancy through intrauterine insemination. Men with these histories
were designated “subfertile/infertile.” Of the 42 patients in Study 1, 18
required three or fewer cycles to exhibit clinical evidence of pregnancy
(e.g., biochemical, ultrasonographic) or had any history of pregnancy via
natural conception. Men with these histories were designated “fertile.”
Traditional semen parameters were measured for all men (Table 1). A
difference in sperm concentration between fertile and subfertile/
infertile individuals was measured (p = 0.017), although both groups
were well above World Health Organization guidelines. No differences
in ejaculate volume (p = 0.981), sperm motility (p = 0.066), or morphol-
ogy (p = 0.208) were observed between the groups.
Cap-Scores were calculated for the 42 individuals for whom clinical
fertility data were available to determine whether Cap-Score differed
between fertile and subfertile/infertile individuals. The subfertile/
infertile patients had mean Cap-Scores of 22.6 ± 1.5% and 28.8 ± 1.8%,
and the fertile population had Cap-Scores of 27.1 ± 1.8% and
38.4 ± 2.5% for Non-Cap (incubated without capacitation stimuli) and
Cap (incubated with capacitation stimuli) treatments, respectively
(Figure 1a). No difference was observed in mean Cap-Score between

 fertility groups for the Non-Cap treatment (p = 0.065). In contrast, men
with no evidence of pregnancy or requiring greater than three cycles to
achieve pregnancy had significantly lower Cap-Scores for the Cap
treatment(p = 0.002).Inaddition,thefertilegrouphadabetterresponse
to capacitation stimuli, as their percent increase in Cap-Score from
Non-Cap to Cap was 45.2 ± 8.2%, in comparison to 34.2 ± 7.2% for the
subfertile/infertile group (p = 0.015; Mann–Whitney test).
A nonparametric comparison of Cap-Score was undertaken
between the fertile and infertile/subfertile men to further investigate
the relationship between Cap-Score and fertility status (Figure 1b). For
this approach, the 42 patients with clinical fertility data were ranked
based on their Cap-Score to visualize and assess the association
between Cap-Score and clinical fertility. A Mann–Whitney test
showed that clinically subfertile/infertile men were more likely to
have lower Cap-Scores (p = 0.001). These results suggest that GM1
localization scores tracked well with successful fertilization via
intrauterine insemination and natural conception.
Several possible cut-offs were evaluated using a receiver
operating characteristic curve to determine whether the Cap-Score,
on its own, might be able to distinguish fertile from subfertile/infertile
patients in Study 1 (Figure 2). When a Cap-Score cut-off of 39.5% was
used, 13 patients were above the cut-off and 29 were below based on
the population distribution (Figure 1b). Of the 13 above the cut-off,
92.3% (12/13) were fertile. Of the 29 individuals below the cut-off,
20.7% (6/29) were fertile. When a Cap-Score of 37.5% was used as a
cut-off, 17 patients were above, and 25 were below. Iteratively
adjusting the cut-off revealed a tradeoff between sensitivity and
specificity, which behaved as expected. A cut-off of 38.0% provided
the best combination of sensitivity and specificity; however, because a
cut-off of 39.5% maximized sensitivity for this population (Figure 2),
this value was chosen for further analyses of Study 1.
The applicability of the determined cut-off was demonstrated by
separating the men in Study 1 into groups based solely on their histories
of clinical pregnancy, and then evaluating for Cap-Score (Figure 3). Of
the 24 patients who were designated subfertile/infertile, only one (1/
24 = 4.2%) was above the cut-off (Cap-Score ≥39.5%). Of the 18 donors
who were classified asfertile,12(12/18;66.7%)were abovethe cut-off.
The proportion of clinically subfertile/infertile individuals with low
scores (Cap-Score <39.5%) (23/24) was larger than the proportion of
clinically fertile individuals below the cut-off (6/18; p = 0.000). These
results further suggested that the Cap-Score provided useful informa-
tion that could help distinguish men who were likely to have success by
natural conception or within three or fewer cycles of intrauterine
insemination from those who were subfertile/infertile, and did not
achieve clinical evidence of pregnancy within this limit.
2.3 | Spermatozoa from presumed-fertile men
showed a robust response to capacitation stimuli
Despite their compelling nature, the above data had an important
limitation; namely, they were obtained from individuals actively
seeking a fertility work-up and treatment at a tertiary care clinic, often
after a long history of examinations and failed cycles of intrauterine
insemination at other clinics. This resulted in a highly skewed patient
base, in terms of both age and need for the majority to utilize
intrauterine insemination to achieve a successful fertilization. Thus,
the values and cut-off in Study 1 would likely not be applicable to a
fertile population and/or a population seeking fertility treatment.
In Study 2, we therefore set out to determine a Cap-Score
reference range for men with normal fertility in the absence of any
form of assisted reproduction, and to compare that range with data
from a cohort of men questioning their fertility. Cap-Scores were
obtained from 187 semen samples provided by 76 men with presumed
fertility (pregnant partner or fathered a child within 3 years [Cohort 1]).
To determine how consistent Cap-Score readings were within a donor,
multiple samples were tested from 30 of these fertile men (average
four readings/donor). Collections were done at least 1-week apart,
with donor assurance of two-to-five days of abstinence. A Cap-Score
was obtained for each collection, and a coefficient of variation was

basal, non-capacitating conditions did not differ between the two
fertility groups (p = 0.065). In contrast, Cap-Scores for samples
incubated with stimuli for capacitation were significantly lower for
those men experiencing difficulties with conception (*p = 0.002). (b)
Cap-Score was determined for 42 individuals, and then these
individuals were ranked based on their Cap-Score (x-axis). The
Mann–Whitney test showed that men who achieved clinical
pregnancy in 3 or fewer cycles or by natural conception were more
likely to have higher Cap-Scores (p = 0.001)

 calculated for each donor (Figure 4). The average coefficient of
variation within a donor was 12.6%, with most collections typically
varying within six Cap-Score units of their average. Variation in semen
assay parameters between samples collected from individuals is well
documented (Carlsen et al., 2004; Mallidis et al., 1991), and these
observations suggest that the Cap-Score is reasonably consistent from
one collection to the next.
2.4 | Establishing a standard capacitation profile
An average Cap-Score was determined for each donor in Cohort 1 of
Study 2 to ensure that each individual had similar weight in the
cohort comparison. The average Cap-Score for Cohort 1’s sperm
incubated with stimuli for capacitation was 35.3 ± 0.9% (76 unique
donors, 187 observations) and 23.7 ± 1.0% for the basal, non-
capacitating treatment (76 unique donors, 177 observations). The
mean percent increase in Cap-Score from basal to capacitating
conditions for Cohort 1 was 66.6 ± 4.9% (n = 76), suggesting that
sperm from fertile individuals had a robust ability to respond to
capacitation stimuli.
2.5 | Comparison of men questioning their fertility
against the standard capacitation profile
The major goal in clinical settings is to diagnose the fertility status of a
specific individual. Therefore, an understanding of the distribution of
the individual scores is necessary to establish a useful test. For this
purpose, we compared Cap-Scores obtained from 122 individuals
seeking semen analysis because of questions regarding their fertility
(potential subfertile/infertile men [Cohort 2]) against the Cap-Scores
obtained from the 76 individuals in Cohort 1. No patients in Study 2
were removed from the population of men questioning their fertility as
a result of female factor infertility, making it likely that a number of
these men were actually fertile.

scored above the threshold of having a Cap-Score ≥ 39.5 (1/24 = 4.2%
[closed square]). Eighteen patients were classified as fertile (successful
conception in three or fewer cycles of intrauterine insemination or
natural conception [circles]). Of these, 12 scored above the threshold
of having a Cap-Score ≥ 39.5 (12/18 = 66.7% [closed circles])

 To compare the distributions of these two populations, we first
converted the data from Cohorts 1 and 2 to z-scores using the mean (μ)
and standard deviation (SD; σ) for Cohort 1 (z-scorei = (Xi − µ)/σ;
Xi = observation (i), μ = 35.3; σ = 7.7). This transformed the mean of
Cohort 1 to 0, and each standard deviation from the mean became
equivalent to 1 unit on the x-axis. This approach enables one to visualize
the mean and distribution of samples in the known-fertile Cohort 1 with
the remainder of the converted values simply representing the distance
of any observation from the mean in units of σ. The Lilliefors test for
distribution normality showed that Cohort 1 followed a normal
distribution (p = 0.24). In a population with a perfectly normal
distribution, 68% of the values should be within one standard deviation
of the mean, and 95% of the values should be within two standard
deviations.Here,72.4%werewithin onestandarddeviationofthe mean
and 94.7% were within two standard deviations of the mean.
Clinical attention is focused on the lower end of the male fertility
spectrum, so we next compared Cap-Scores from Cohort 2 against the
data from Cohort 1. In Cohort 1, 13.2% of the observations had
z-scores at or below −1 (Figure 5). A greater proportion of individuals in
the potential subfertile/infertile Cohort 2 had z-scores at or below −1
(33.6%; p = 0.001) (Figure 5). These data show that, in comparison to
fertile men, many men questioning their fertility had sperm that
responded relatively poorly to stimuli for capacitation. Cap-Score
population means were also compared between Cohorts 1 and 2;
however, since the vast majority of Cohort 2 was not vetted for
female fertility factor, this population likely represents a rather

the mean and the dotted lines represent 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean. In the fertile population of Cohort 1, 13.2% (10/76) of
the observations had z-scores ≤−1, which is consistent with a normal distribution. In contrast, 33.6% (41/122) of the individuals in the
potential subfertile/infertile cohort had z-scores ≤–1 (p = 0.001)

 heterogeneous distribution that includes a number of fertile men.
Nonetheless, the average Cap-Score for sperm incubated with
capacitation stimuli for Cohort 2 was 31.6 ± 0.73% (n = 122), which
is significantly less than the value obtained for Cohort 1 (p = 0.001).
Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the population of men
questioning their fertility produced fewer sperm that could respond to
capacitation stimuli.
2.6 | Minimal-to-no relationship was found between
Cap-Score and standard semen analysis parameters
Several assays designed to test sperm function were previously found
to correlate with one or more of the traditional semen analysis
parameters, greatly reducing their diagnostic value (Aitken, 2002;
Giwercman et al., 2003; Hazary et al., 2001; Zini et al., 2009).
Therefore, we evaluated whether Cap-Score provided novel func-
tional data or merely tracked with standard semen analysis parameters
by comparing sperm morphology, concentration, and motility metrics
to the Cap-Scores for each man in Cohort 2.
First, morphology scores were obtained applying the World
Health Organization criterion (2010): 78.7% (96/122) of the popula-
tion was teratozoospermic, with less than 4% normal forms; 21.3%
(26/122) passed the World Health Organization criteria for normal
morphology, and of these men, 19.2% (5/26) had a Cap-Score more
than one standard deviation below the mean of the presumed fertile
population (e.g., Cohort 1). Samples were classified as having 0, 1, 2, 3,
or ≥4% normal forms, and the grouped Cap-Scores were compared
using analysis of variance. No relationship was found between Cap-
Score and morphology (p = 0.28) (Figure 6).
Regarding motility, theWorldHealthOrganization (2010), classifies
a sample as asthenozoospermic when total motility is less than or equal
to 40%. Motility is traditionally presented as a univariate graph (range
15–80%) (Figure 7a) that can be expanded to include Cap-Score (Figure
7b). Within Cohort 2, 93.4% (114/122) exhibited normal motility; of
these men, 30.7% (35/114) had Cap-Scores more than one standard
deviation below the mean of the presumed fertile population. Linear
regression suggested a minor relationship between total motility and
Cap-Score (r = 0.22, p = 0.02; r2 = 0.05), with total motility accounting
for only 5% of the variability in Cap-Score, leaving 95% of the variability
unrelated to motility. As shown, total motility data were collected in an
ordinal fashion, rather than as a continuous measure, so total motility
data were also analyzed in bins of 5% to reflect the manner in which the
data were collected. Bins having less than three observations were
removed, followed by analysis of variance. No difference in Cap-Score
was detected across the six bins (p = 0.14), highlighting the minor nature
of any potential relationship.
Finally, the relationship between sperm concentration and Cap-
Score was evaluated. Again, traditional semen analysis plots concen-
tration as a univariate distribution (Figure 8a). The World Health
Organization (2010) identifies a concentration of sperm less than or
equal to 15 × 106/ml as abnormal and oligozoospermic; 17.2%
(21/122) of men in Cohort 2 exhibited oligozoospermia. Incorporation
of Cap-Score data versus sperm concentration (Figure 8b) revealed
that of the 82.8% (101/122) of the men exhibiting normal sperm
concentration, 32.7% (33/101) had Cap-Scores more than one
standard deviation below the mean of the presumed fertile population.
Linear regression analysis revealed no correlation between concen-
tration and Cap-Score (r = 0.04, p = 0.67).

| DISCUSSION
Here, we report that changes in patterns of GM1 localization in human
sperm correspond with male fertility. This finding was consistent in
different settings, with different study designs, different patient
populations, and when performed by different operators. When
combined with the absence of relationship between the Cap-Score
and conventional semen analysis parameters, these clinical findings
suggest that GM1 localization patterns, the basis of the Cap-Score, can
provide important information on sperm function that will comple-
ment traditional semen analysis.

 Supporting this assertion, data collected independently in Study 1
showed a marked difference in Cap-Score between fertile men versus
subfertile/infertile men. When viewed from the opposite perspective,
men who scored above a threshold Cap-Score were very likely to be
fertile (92.3%), whereas men who scored below that cut-off were
unlikely to be fertile (20.7%). Another profound difference was
revealed by the cohort comparison (Study 2), in which 33.6% of men
questioning their fertility had Cap-Scores lower-than or equal-to one

 standard deviation below the mean, as compared to 13.2% for the
fertile cohort. These data are especially remarkable in that none of the
men questioning their fertility (Cohort 2) were excluded because of
infertility in their female partners. Thus, one would expect a number of
the men in Cohort 2 to be fertile, with a purely female factor fertility
issue driving that couple to be examined (Agarwal et al., 2015). If those
fertile men had been removed from Cohort 2, then the assay might
have revealed an even higher percentage of cases of men whose sperm
responded poorly to stimuli for capacitation.
As noted, several assays initially thought to provide information
on sperm fertilizing ability were later shown to track with one of the
existing parameters of semen analysis. We found that traditional
semen analysis parameters, including sperm morphology, total
motility, and concentration, had little to no correlation with the
Cap-Score (at most, motility accounted for 5% of the Cap-Score); thus,
the Cap-Score provides novel information.
Over the past decades, several assays were shown to measure or
assess sperm capacitation. For example, capacitation can be detected
by performing immunoblots for phosphotyrosine residues (Osheroff
et al., 1999; Visconti et al., 1995). This is an excellent laboratory tool,
though it is not by nature quantitative, and the technical effort
required has precluded this approach from being developed for
commercial use. Other assays of capacitation also involve incubating
sperm under capacitating conditions, and then treating them with a
stimulus to induce acrosome exocytosis. For similar reasons of
technical effort, as well as the subjective nature of interpreting the
signal in the sperm head (e.g., as when using chlortetracycline as a
calcium indicator [Saling & Storey, 1979]), these assays have also not
been used extensively in clinical practice.
Additional data on the inter- and intra-operator reliability of Cap-
Score measurements (Moody et al., 2017), along with observations on
how semen must be handled in order to perform this assay and
optimize function (Moody et al., 2017), support the technical feasibility
of this assay and how it might fit into the work flow of a traditional
semen analysis. The current demonstration of clinical “fit for purpose”
combine with those data to provide a validation of the assay.
Our results strongly suggest that the Cap-Score assay addresses
recent calls for the development of practical tests of sperm function to
act as a complement to semen analysis (Lamb, 2010; Oehninger et al.,
2014; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014). Clearly, a large percentage of men
questioning their fertility and passing World Health Organization
semen analysis cut-offs had sperm that were poorly responsive to
stimuli for capacitation. The Cap-Score Sperm Function Test should
not, however, be the singular test administered and/or considered
when evaluating the fertility status of the male partner. This caveat is
applicable to all tests of sperm function, as these tests are not meant to
detract from or replace, but instead build upon and strengthen, the
information provided in the traditional semen analysis (Sakkas,
Ramalingam, Garrido, & Barratt, 2015).
When used in conjunction with traditional, descriptive measures
of semen quality, knowledge of the Cap-Score should help clinicians
counsel couples to the most appropriate fertility treatment (Palermo,
Neri, & Rosenwaks, 2015). Currently, defects in sperm function go
undiagnosed by the traditional semen analysis. This results in half of all
cases of male infertility being idiopathic, identified only by repeated
failure at natural conception and intrauterine insemination (Aboulghar
et al., 2001; Tournaye, 2012). The current diagnostic algorithm imparts
enormous emotional, physical, and financial costs on couples trying to
conceive. Integration of the Cap-Score Sperm Function Test into the
contemporary diagnostic/treatment algorithm is relatively simple
(Figure 9), and would allow couples identified with reduced sperm
function to be spared cycles of intrauterine insemination that are
FIGURE 9
Comparison of clinical algorithms between historical reliance on semen analysis versus semen analysis performed in conjunction
with Cap-Score. The inclusion of Cap-Score to the clinical algorithm will provide a test of sperm function, offering a valuable complement to
the descriptive parameters in the traditional semen analysis. Currently, semen analysis fails to diagnose or identify defects in sperm function.
More than 50% of male infertility cases are idiopathic, identified only by repeated failure at natural conception and intrauterine insemination
(IUI) (large arrow in flow chart on left). In a new algorithm, inclusive of a traditional semen analysis and the Cap-Score Sperm Function Test,
couples with low sperm function would be identified earlier (large arrow near the top of the flow chart on right), and immediately directed to
a more appropriate form of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Removal of
these couples with low sperm function from those pursuing intrauterine insemination would be predicted to result in a higher relative success
rate of intrauterine insemination for couples with appropriately high Cap-Scores (large arrow near bottom of flow chart on right)

 doomed to fail. Instead, these couples could immediately be directed
to a more appropriate form of assisted reproductive technology, such
as in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (Forti &
Krausz, 1998).
Why should an assay of the sperm’s ability to capacitate in vitro
provide clinically relevant information on sperm function for a large
percentage of men? Unlike tests that look for mutations in single
genes, a cell-biology approach that evaluates the entire pathway of
capacitation enables one to assess the functions of, and relationships
among, hundreds or possibly thousands of gene products. Male germ
cell development and differentiation in the testis, maturation during
epididymal transit, and interaction with seminal plasma and stimuli for
capacitation must all be normal for sperm to capacitate and yield a
Cap-Score within the reference range.
GM1 localization is highly conserved in the spermatozoa of
diverse mammalian species, including mouse, bull, and human
(Buttke et al., 2006). This ganglioside is enriched in the plasma
membrane overlying the acrosome, matching the localization of
sterols and Caveolin-1, a protein associated with membrane rafts
and involved in the regulation of acrosome reaction and capacitation
(Selvaraj et al., 2006; Travis et al., 2001). GM1 is bound by substances
in seminal plasma that help keep the sperm functionally quiescent;
as GM1-binding proteins such as SVS2 (Seminal vesicle secretory
protein 2) are lost from the sperm, these gametes can then
capacitate and acquire the ability to fertilize an egg (Kawano &
Yoshida, 2007; Kawano, Yoshida, Iwamoto, & Yoshida, 2008). GM1
acts as an important control point for capacitation because it
regulates transient calcium flux required for acrosome exocytosis in
response to sterol efflux (Cohen et al., 2014).
We previously showed that specific patterns of GM1 localization
are found in mouse and bull sperm that are responsive to stimuli for
capacitation (Selvaraj et al., 2007). In the cohort of fertile men, our
present finding of a mean Cap-Score of 35.3% is roughly consistent
with these previous studies in murine and bovine spermatozoa, in
which approximately 40% of the spermatozoa showed specific
changes in GM1 localization upon exposure to capacitation stimuli
(Selvaraj et al., 2007). These results are also consistent with other
studies in which capacitation in murine sperm was measured by
protein tyrosine phosphorylation events (Urner, Leppens-Luisier, &
Sakkas, 2001). Together, these data support the view that in diverse
mammalian species, including humans, not all sperm in an ejaculate are
functionally equivalent and that GM1 localization is a reasonable
readout that is informative of these functional differences.
Of interest, the mean Cap-Score for fertile men in Study 1 (38.4),
and the cut-off value that had the most sensitivity (39.5), were both
slightly higher than the mean Cap-Score for fertile men in Cohort 1 of
Study 2. While the lower sample size of fertile men in Study 1 (18 out of
the 42) could well contribute to this difference, it should be recalled
that the Study 1 patient base was skewed toward older individuals with
more complicated reproductive histories who were largely reliant on
intrauterine insemination for conception. These differences in the size
and nature of Study 1’s patient base also likely account for the slight,
but statistically significant, difference in concentration between the
fertile and subfertile/infertile individuals. To reduce variability within
and between studies, we could have introduced age-related exclusion
criteria; we decided against this because the age range of patients in
Study 1 reflected those individuals actually being treated for infertility.
In both Study 1 and Cohort 2 of Study 2, we felt it would be practically
important to account for the variation being observed in real life
situations.
The combination of study settings and design enabled us first to
determine that the Cap-Score tracks with clinical evidence of
pregnancy (Study 1), and then to establish that a population of fertile
men had Cap-Scores with a normal distribution (Study 2). These data
herein provide a reference against which the Cap-Score of any
individual might be compared. Despite the reasonably consistent
Cap-Scores obtained from repeated ejaculates from the same
individuals, we expect that changes in the ability to capacitate
could be transient in nature, influenced by other components of that
man’s health. Nevertheless, Cap-Score was somewhat more consis-
tent than the reported variance of other semen analysis measures:
An intra-individual variability of 34% in sperm concentration was
observed when at least three ejaculates were examined (Carlsen
et al., 2004), while a variance of 54% for concentration and 74% for
motility index was also reported (Mallidis et al., 1991). Despite the
consistency in Cap-Score results within an individual, we suggest
that, as with the traditional semen analysis parameters, clinicians
utilizing the Cap-Score exercise restraint in conveying to a patient a
status of “fertile” or “subfertile/infertile” on the basis of a single Cap-
Score measurement.
The Cap-Score can be a powerful tool to evaluate male fertility,
when used to complement standard semen analysis parameters. This
assay provides unique, quantitative insight into sperm capacitation,
the process by which sperm become functionally able to fertilize an
egg. The ability to identify defects in sperm function would allow
clinicians to personalize reproductive therapies, more quickly directing
patients towards an appropriate technology of assisted reproduction.
For example, assuming no contra-indicating female factor, men with
semen analysis parameters around the World Health Organization
thresholds but with high Cap-Scores might be encouraged to try
intrauterine insemination. In contrast, men with those same semen
analysis results but a low Cap-Score might be encouraged to pursue in
vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, sparing them
from cycles of intrauterine insemination that would be unlikely to
succeed.

| MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 | Participant identification and specimen
collection
In Study 1, consenting subjects were identified from men actively
undergoing fertility examinations. Ages for 63 consenting individuals
ranged from 27 to 53. All infertile couples included in the current study
underwent comprehensive infertility screening. A detailed history of
any gynecologic, menstrual, medical, or surgical problems was elicited
from all female partners. An in-office sonogram was performed,
432 |
CARDONA ET AL.
 including measurement of antral follicle counts. Hysterosalpinography
and saline infusion sonography was performed to confirm patency of
the Fallopian tubes and to rule out any uterine cavity lesions,
respectively. Blood measurements of the following hormones were
also performed: cycle Day-2/3 follicle stimulating hormone, cycle Day-
2/3 estradiol, anti-Müllerian hormone, and luteal-phase progesterone
levels. No known female-factor infertility was present in these
couples, other than the risk factor associated with age of some female
partners, which ranged from 24 to 46, with 20 being ≥40 years old. All
male partners also provided a detailed history and underwent a
physical examination. A semen analysis was performed in all men,
which was repeated at least once. Semen samples were collected from
consenting men after a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 5 days of
sexual abstinence by manual masturbation. Of these 63 initial
couples, sufficient reproductive medical history was available for
42. Criteria for sufficient history included knowledge of any natural
conception or the results from a total of at least three cycles of
intrauterine insemination, combining history from before and after the
assay. The assay was performed at the time of semen sample
collection, without consideration of history. Outcomes of cycles of
classical in vitro fertilization or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection were
not considered.
In Study 2, fertile men (Cohort 1) were defined as having a
pregnant partner or having fathered a child within the last 3 years
without the use of assisted reproduction. This cut-off was used to
facilitate sample acquisition from a sufficiently large population. If
men in this group developed secondary (acquired) infertility in this
time span, their presence would have resulted in a conservative
error that lowered the normal mean and reduced the difference from
the subfertile/infertile men (Cohort 2). Fertility in Cohort 1 was
documented prior to specimen collection either by a birth certificate
of their child, a note from an obstetrician or gynecologist, or an
annotated ultrasound image. Ages in this group ranged from 24 to
49 years. Fertile donors were recruited through local advertising;
men with a history of infertility were not considered. We performed
a power analysis (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) to ensure
that our sample size was adequate to establish a normal reference
range; this was done using preliminary data from 34 fertile men
(mean Cap-Score ± SD; 40 ± 7.1%). An acceptable range about the
mean was set at 3%, and a two-tailed t-test at p < 0.01, with a
probability of detecting a difference this large of 90%, was applied.
Results showed that a valid standard range could be established with
a minimum of 61 individuals, below our cohort of 76 unique
individuals. For Cohort 2, semen samples from 122 consenting men,
who had been referred to the Urology Group of New Jersey for
fertility evaluation, were assessed over a 5-month period. None of
the men in this Cohort were excluded because of confounding
infertility in their partner, and it is highly likely that a number of
these men were actually fertile. In fact, within an unscreened
population of couples questioning their fertility, 30–50% of the men
would be expected to be fertile since female-factor infertility is
expected in 50–70% of infertile couples (Agarwal et al., 2015). In this
Cohort, ages ranged from 22 to 56 years. A single semen sample was
obtained from each of the 122 patients. The referring urologist
included
a

2 were also used to investigate potential relationships between the
Cap-Score and traditional semen analysis measures.
4.2 | Sample processing
Samples having fewer than 10 million sperm cells were not included
in any of the Studies. Samples were liquefied at 37°C for at least
15 min but for no more than 2 h (Moody et al., 2017). Subsequent to
liquefaction, sperm were removed from the seminal plasma by
centrifugation through Enhance S-Plus Cell Isolation Media (Vitro-
life, Englewood, CO, reference: 15232 ESP-100-90%) at 300g for
10 min. The cells were collected, resuspended with approximately
4 ml of Human Tubal Fluid (HTF) (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA,
reference 90125) (Study 1) or modified Human Tubal Fluid medium
(mHTF) (Irvine Scientific, reference 90126) (Study 2), and centrifuged
at 600g for 10 min. The resultant pellet was re-suspended in HTF
(Study 1) or mHTF (Study 2) and divided into two separate aliquots
incubated with (Cap) and without (Non-Cap) capacitation stimuli.
Sperm concentration was adjusted to 10 million/ml per tube, and
then incubated for 3 h at 37°C. For Study 1, cells were incubated in
an incubator with 5% CO2, therefore, HTF containing a HCO3
−
buffer was used. For Study 2, an air incubator and mHTF, containing
a
HEPES
(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid)
buffer, was used. Preliminary studies observed no difference in
Cap-Score, viability, or sperm recovery whether HCO3
− or HEPES-
buffered medium was used. The capacitation stimuli consisted of 2-
hydroxypropyl- β-cyclodextrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; reference
C0926) (Osheroff et al., 1999; Parinaud, Vieitez, Vieu, Collet, &
Perret, 2000). Pilot studies showed that this stimulus was as
effective in promoting capacitation in human sperm, as measured
with the Cap-Score, at 3 h of incubation as albumin was at 6 h (Vairo
et al., 2013). Following incubation, the samples were fixed with
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services: Hatfield, PA
reference 15712) as described (Selvaraj et al., 2006).
4.3 | Sample labeling
Samples were labeled with 2 μg/ml of Cholera Toxin B (Buttke et al.,
2006), conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher, C34775,
USA). After 10 min, 5 μl of the labeled sperm were placed on a
microscope slide, overlaid with a cover slip, and moved to an imaging
station to be scored.
4.4 | Image acquisition
Study 1: a Nikon NIU microscope equipped with CFI60 Plan
Apochromat Lambda 10,40, 60, and 100× Objectives, an Andor Clara
Digital Camera, and a 64-bit imaging workstation running NIS
Elements software (Nikon, U.S.A). Study 2: Nikon Eclipse NI-E
microscopes equipped with CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda 40×
Objectives, C-FL AT GFP/FITC Long Pass Filter Sets, Hamamatsu
ORCA-Flash 4.0 cameras, and 64-bit imaging workstations running
NIS Elements software.

 4.5 | Determination of patterns of GM1 localization
In all Studies, approximately 150–200 sperm with no gross morpho-
logical abnormalities were analyzed per sample, and GM1 localization
patterns were determined. Readers were trained to identify GM1
localization patterns as per Moody et al. (2017). Studies demonstrated
that the same and independent readers reproducibly replicate Cap-
Score values when evaluating distinct subsamples of the same
ejaculate (Moody et al., 2017). The proportion of sperm within a
sample having undergone capacitation was determined and reported
as the Cap-Score (# of sperm with capacitation patterns/[# of sperm
with capacitation patterns + number of sperm with other patterns]).
4.6 | Statistical analyses
Analysis of variance, coefficient of variation, Mann–Whitney test,
Lilliefors test, and Chi-square test were performed using XLSTAT
(2015). Linear regression analysis and Student’s t-test were carried out
using Microsoft Excel (2013). Standard error is reported unless
otherwise noted.
4.7 | Ethical approval
All research and study protocols were approved by either Weill
Cornell’s IRB (Protocol# 1210013187; Study 1) or WIRB (https://
