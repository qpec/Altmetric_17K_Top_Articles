ABSTRACT
As oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) causes vaccine-associated paralytic po-
liomyelitis, the polio endgame strategy introduced by the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative calls for a phased withdrawal of OPV and an introduction of inactivated po-
liovirus vaccine (IPV). The introduction of IPV creates challenges in maintaining the
cold chain for vaccine storage and distribution. Recent advances in lyophilization
have helped in finding a temperature-stable formulation for multiple vaccines; how-
ever, poliovirus vaccines have yet to capture a stable, safe formula for lyophilization.
In addition, efficient in vitro methods for antigen measurement are needed for
screening
stable
vaccine
formulations.
Here,
we
report
size
exclusion
high-
performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) as a reliable means to identify the
leading lyophilized formulation to generate thermostable Sabin inactivated poliovi-
rus vaccine (sIPV). High-throughput screening and SE-HPLC determined the leading
formulation, resulting in 95% D-antigen recovery and low residual moisture content
of sIPV following lyophilization. Furthermore, the lyophilized sIPV remained stable af-
ter 4 weeks of incubation at ambient temperature and induced strong neutralizing
antibodies and full protection of poliovirus receptor transgenic mice against the in
vivo challenge of wild-type poliovirus. Overall, this report describes a novel means
for the high-throughput evaluation of sIPV antigenicity and a thermostable lyophi-
lized sIPV with in vivo vaccine potency.
IMPORTANCE Poliomyelitis is a highly contagious disease caused by the poliovirus.
While the live attenuated OPV has been the vaccine of choice, a major concern is its
ability to revert to a form that can cause paralysis, so-called vaccine-associated para-
lytic poliomyelitis. Therefore, the new endgame strategy of the Global Polio Eradica-
tion Initiative includes the introduction of an IPV. However, the feasibility of the use
of current IPV formulations in developing countries is limited, because IPV is insuffi-
ciently stable to be purified, transported, and stored under unrefrigerated condi-
tions. We successfully designed the sIPV for use in the dry state that maintains the
full vaccine potency in animal models after incubation at ambient temperature. This
report provides, for the first time, candidate formulations of sIPV that are stable at
elevated temperatures.

P
oliovirus (PV) is a member of the Picornaviridae family in the order of Picornavirales
and a causative agent of poliomyelitis. PV is formed in nonenveloped capsid and
has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (1, 2). The three serotypes of polio-
virus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, have slightly different capsid proteins that define cellular
receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV1 is the most common form encountered
in nature and is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. PV2 was

 declared eradicated in September 2015 after last being detected in October 1999 in
Uttar Pradesh, India, and PV3 has not been seen since its detection in parts of Nigeria
and Pakistan in 2012. All PVs can be transmitted person to person via direct contact,
contaminated food, or other fomites. Poliovirus infection is asymptomatic or mild in
about 95% of infected individuals, and approximately 0.5% of those may present
paralytic disease. However, due to its highly contagious nature, poliovirus infection can
affect large populations.
Vaccines are the most effective tool for controlling viral infection (3), evidenced by
the eradication of smallpox virus (4) and the substantial reduction in the number of PV,
Japanese encephalitis virus, influenza virus, and human papillomavirus infections (5).
Two types of PV vaccines are currently used: an inactivated PV (inactivated PV vaccine
[IPV]) given by injection that was developed by Jonas Salk in 1955 and a live attenuated
PV (oral PV vaccine [OPV]) given by mouth that was developed by Albert Sabin in 1961
(6, 7). OPV proved to be superior in administration, eliminating the need for sterile
syringes and making the vaccine more suitable for mass vaccination campaigns. OPV
also provided longer-lasting community immunity than IPV (8). However, a potential
(although rare) adverse effect of the OPV is its ability to revert to a pathogenic form that
causes vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) (9). Furthermore, outbreaks of
VAPP caused by a circulating vaccine-derived PV have been reported (10). In 2017, the
World Health Organization (WHO) reported 96 cases of VAPP in Syria and Democratic
Republic of Congo. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has played a major role in
reducing the cases of poliomyelitis from 350,000 cases annually to 22 cases in 2017
(http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week). In 2016, the WHO suc-
cessfully replaced trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine with bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine
to eliminate the chance of generating type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (11).
Thus, the eradication of type 2 PV, the absence of detection of type 3 PV worldwide,
and restriction of type 1 PV to only a few geographic areas of three countries has
enabled the implementation of the endgame of polio eradication, which calls for a
phased withdrawal of OPV and an introduction of IPV.
The introduction of IPV creates challenges in maintaining the cold chain for vaccine
storage and distribution. This temperature sensitivity of IPV remains a significant hurdle
during immunization campaigns (12). IPV can be stored for up to 4 years at optimal
temperatures (2°
C to 8°
C); temperatures outside this range drastically reduce vaccine
potency (13). Thus, there have been major efforts to improve the stability of IPV and to
eliminate the need for the cold-chain process during distribution and storage, such as
the use of an artificial hydrated silica exterior on virions (14), IPV encapsulation using
microspheres (15), IPV delivery using biodegradable mini-implant Bioneedles (16), and
IPV lyophilization (17, 18).
Attempts to lyophilize IPV have resulted in low recovery following lyophilization and
poor stability at ambient temperatures (17, 19–21). While sufficient optimization of a
lyophilized vaccine can substantially improve thermostability (21), it can become a
cumbersome process without an efficient and effective in vitro method to evaluate
vaccine potency. The potency of IPV determined by the in vitro assay is expressed in
arbitrarily defined D-antigen units (D-AgU). The D-AgU was established in the early
1960s (22) following characterization of purified virus preparations by sucrose gradient
centrifugation where two bands were identified. One, the D fraction (D-antigen), was
associated with infectious virus with intact structure as revealed by electron microscopy
and RNA content. The other, the C fraction (C-antigen), contained low infectivity with
little RNA and possessed a structure that was similar to the structure of the heat-treated
virus. As induction of neutralizing antibodies is associated with the immunization of
intact virus structures (D-antigen) but not with the immunization of C-antigen viral
preparations, the potency of IPV has been a function of the D-antigen content. Thus,
efficient in vitro methods for D-antigen measurement are needed for screening stable
vaccine formulations.
In this study, various surfactant-based formulations were screened for Sabin inacti-
vated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) lyophilization, and size exclusion high-performance

 liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) (23) was implemented as a novel high-throughput
formulation assay for D-antigen quantitation of sIPV. Finally, a room-temperature-stable
sIPV prepared by leading formulation induced strong neutralizing antibodies and full
protection against wild-type (WT) poliovirus challenge in vivo. This sIPV formular will
not only facilitate the distribution of the vaccine without the need of refrigeration but
also contribute to the poliovirus endgame introduced by the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative.
RESULTS
sIPV preparation. In order to prepare highly purified sIPV, we followed the IPV
production process previously published (24) but with modifications (see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material). Stock sIPV was generated from HeLa cells by cotransfecting a
cDNA plasmid encoding Sabin poliovirus viral RNA and pREV encoding T7 RNA poly-
merase. Cultures were monitored until 90% to 95% cytopathic effect (CPE) was ob-
served (25, 26). Viruses were then harvested by freezing and thawing the supernatants
and cell mixtures, followed by filtration. This passage 0 (P0) virus stock was used as a
working stock to scale up virus production in Vero cells using 3-liter spinner flasks. At
18 h after infection of Vero cells with sIPV P0 stock at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 30, the supernatants were collected and freeze-thawed three times. To establish a
vaccine production platform mimicking clinical use, we used a multistep purification
process that included ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography.
Virus titers were checked at each step to ensure the optimal virus purification and to
gain maximal virus recovery (Fig. S1). The purity of virus was confirmed by loading the
SDS-treated virion on a PAGE gel, followed by silver staining (Fig. 1). Virus inactivation
was carried out by using methanol-free formaldehyde at a final concentration of
0.025% to minimize the capsid protein alteration, and the reaction mixture was then

 incubated at 37°
C. After 14 days, sodium bisulfite was added to neutralize the formal-
dehyde. The suspension was then dialyzed using a 10-kDa Slide-A-Lyzer cassette
against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 25 mM NaCl according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Development of high-throughput SE-HPLC analysis of sIPV. There are two
distinct antigenic forms of PV; infectious virion particles are referred to as D-antigen
(D-Ag), and noninfectious empty virion particles are referred to as C-antigen (C-Ag) (22).
Due to differences in the antigenic forms of D-Ag and C-Ag, only the D-Ag form of
virion particles shows an immunogenic response to viral infection. Moreover, D-Ag can
be converted into C-Ag by heating at 56°
C; thus, C-Ag is also called H-antigen (H-Ag)
(27). The potency of IPVs has been determined by the amount of D-antigens present in
the vaccine, typically by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (28). Here, size
exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) was investigated as a
novel method for determining the antigenicity of sIPV through separation of intact viral
particles from disintegrated capsid proteins on the basis of hydrodynamic radius.
SE-HPLC analysis of sIPV showed one main peak and one postpeak (Fig. 2A), detecting
the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues at excitation lambda/emission lambda
(�ex/�em) of 280/336 nm. A preliminary stability test was performed by storing the main
peak eluate of sIPV at 4°
C for 1 week and subsequently subjecting it to analysis by
SE-HPLC. These results revealed that the main peak degraded into the postpeak species
and that all degradant species were detected in this method without a loss in total area
(Fig. 2B) (Table 1). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that the main peak
observed by SE-HPLC contained a monodispersed particle of 14.6 nm in radius (Table 2)
which matched closely with the PV radius of �15 nm (1). Eluates of both the main peak
and the postpeak from SE-HPLC (Fig. 2A) were collected and measured for the D-AgU
FIG 2 SE-HPLC reliably measures D-antigen stability of sIPV. Poliovirus antigens are divided into
D-antigen (D-Ag) and C-antigen (C-Ag); only D-Ag shows major immunogenicity. Size exclusion high-
performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) was used as a novel method for determining the
antigenicity of sIPV through separation of intact viral particles from disintegrated capsid proteins on the
basis of hydrodynamic radius. (A) sIPV chromatogram detecting 336-nm emission from 280-nm excitation

 by ELISA (29). This also confirmed that only the main peak showed reactivity with the
type 1 PV antibody (Fig. S2). These results strongly demonstrated the utility of SE-HPLC
as a reliable and efficient method for measuring the stability of sIPV in various
lyophilized formulations.
Surfactant-based formulation buffer for lyophilization. A desirable lyophilized
formulation should have the following attributes: minimal loss of D-Ag, formation of an
elegant cake structure correlating with good product integrity (30), and stability
following storage at ambient temperature. A number of traditional stabilizers and
lyophilic excipients, including glycine, mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and magnesium
sulfate, were evaluated, and formulations maintaining D-Ag recovery rates of greater
than 80% upon lyophilization were selected for further optimization (Table 3). Follow-
ing the primary round of screening, the stabilizing effect of surfactants (21) was
assessed by agitating the samples for 4 h with and without the addition of 0.01%
polysorbate 20, 0.01% polysorbate 80, or 0.1% pluronic F68. While agitation signifi-
cantly reduced D-antigen levels, the addition of polysorbate 20 or pluronic F68 effec-
tively mitigated D-Ag loss (Fig. S3A and B). Magnesium ion at a concentration of 1 mM
was also considered as a stabilizer on the basis of its stabilizing effect on other vaccines,
including OPV and IPV (20). Formulation pHs ranging from 6 to 8 were tested, but
optimal D-Ag recovery was observed at neutral pH. A histidine buffer used to maintain
the neutral pH was combined with mannitol as a bulking agent and sucrose or sorbitol
as a stabilizing sugar (the lyophilization conditions are summarized in Table S1 in the
supplemental material) (21). This formulation also showed low values of moisture
content of 0.77% to 1.30% by Karl Fischer (KF) analysis (Table 4) (17).

thermostability of the leading lyophilized formulation candidates (formulation codes of
F4, F8, and F9 as summarized in Table 3), sIPVs in the formulation were incubated after

C, respectively. Thus F4 formulation was selected for in vivo protective efficacy
testing against wild-type (WT) PV infection (31).
A total of six groups of poliovirus receptor transgenic (cPVR) mice (n � 8) expressing
human CD155 for viral entry (32, 33) were vaccinated with 20 D-AgU of sIPV, lyophilized
(lyo) sIPV, IPOL-IPV (a trivalent polio vaccine distributed by Sanofi Pasteur), or
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) incubated for 4 weeks at the indicated temperatures.
cPVR mice were vaccinated, boosted, challenged, and observed for 2 weeks for signs of
paralysis (Fig. S4), using a blind scoring method outlined in the WHO standard oper-
ating procedure for OPV neurovirulence testing (34). For the serum neutralizing titers,
we first checked day �1 serum and confirmed that no mice had seroconverted, as the
neutralization titers were below the detection limit (Fig. S5). We then checked the
neutralization titers on days 13 and 21 and found that the neutralization titers mea-
sured on day 13 were approximately 2 logs lower than those measured on day 21
(Fig. S5). On the basis of the standardized WHO in vivo potency testing of IPV in rodents
along with the results of the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. S5, day 21 after
vaccination was determined as a time point for the neutralization assay. These assays
showed that lyophilized sIPV incubated at 4°
C and lyophilized sIPV incubated at 37°
C
for 4 weeks developed neutralizing antibody titers similar to those seen with nonly-
ophilized sIPV incubated at 4°
C (Fig. 4A). By striking contrast, sIPV incubated at 37°
C for
4 weeks showed considerable instability: it developed an approximately 7-fold-reduced
neutralizing antibody titer compared to nonlyophilized sIPV incubated at 4°
C or
lyophilized sIPV incubated at either 4°
C or 37°
C for 4 weeks (Fig. 4A). Following the
boost, cPVR mice were challenged with a 50% paralytic dose (50% PD50) of WT
Mahoney strain PV. This showed that lyophilized sIPV incubated at 4°
C or 37°
C for
4 weeks was able to protect mice from paralysis as strongly as commercial IPOL-IPV
(Fig. 4B). This unambiguously demonstrated that the lyophilized sIPV remained stable
after 4 weeks of incubation at 37°
C and induced strong neutralizing antibodies and full
protection of poliovirus receptor transgenic mice against in vivo challenge with wild-
type poliovirus.
DISCUSSION
A majority of human vaccines are temperature sensitive. The dependence of current
vaccines on the cold chain, which prevents exposure to ambient temperature and also
to freezing (12), presents many obstacles that can lead to failure of vaccination
campaigns. As previously reported (35), nearly 1.5 million children lose their lives due
to vaccine-preventable diseases. Pharmaceutical Commerce reported that $12.5 billion
was spent on cold-chain logistics, of which $9.1 billion was for cold-chain transporta-
tion and $3.4 billion was for specialized packaging and instrumentation. Thus, improv-
ing methods to generate thermostabilized vaccines can reduce the number of deaths
caused by vaccine preventable diseases, and cut down on the expenditure used for
cold-chain transport.
This study shows the establishment and optimization of lyophilization conditions to
increase the in vitro and in vivo thermostability and vaccine capacity of sIPV at
temperatures up to 40°
C for at least one month. The use of SE-HPLC enabled the
analysis of various formulations as we were able to distinguish between D-Ag and C-Ag
by SE-HPLC, which was later confirmed by ELISA (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental
material) and DLS analysis (Table 2) (36). Recent studies have shown the use of SE-HPLC
for stability and potency testing assays for human papillomavirus vaccine (37), charac-
terization of influenza vaccine constituents (38), and quality control of vaccines by
characterizing the assembly of antigens (39). In agreement with earlier studies using
SE-HPLC, this method provides an effective means to screen the vaccine stability and
antigen recovery after lyophilization in a high-throughput manner (23) compared to
conventional ELISA (29).
In the virus purification step, we used tangential flow filtration (TFF), size exclusion
chromatography (SEC), and ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) followed by protein
silver staining to ensure the high quality of poliovirus purification. The icosahedral

 poliovirus nucleocapsid is composed of 60 copies each of four coat proteins (VP1, VP2,
VP3, and VP4) (1, 40). As the VP4 protein is very small (�7 k) and myristoylated, it
migrated as broad bands in SDS gel and was not clearly visualized (Fig. 1). However, the
calculation of the band density and molecular weight of each VP protein showed that
the level of VP4 protein in purified virions was similar to or slightly lower than the levels
of the rest of proteins VP1 to VP3. It should be noted that while the D-antigen of
poliovirus vaccine carries all four of capsid proteins VP1 to VP4, only the VP1 capsid
protein is responsible for the generation of a protective immune response against
wild-type virus infection (41).
We screened the optimal lyophilization formulation for minimal D-Ag loss, elegant
cake structure reflecting good product integrity, and stability upon storage at ambient
temperature. In order to achieve a successful lyophilized poliovirus vaccine for this
study, various excipients, including glycine, mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and magnesium
sulfate, were screened at various concentrations and in various combinations to

ies were calculated as normalized results from prelyophilized liquid formulations. Our
leading formulation, containing10 mM histidine, 5% mannitol, 1 mM MgSO4, 1% sor-
bitol, and 0.5% pluronic F68 at pH 7, resulted in higher D-Ag recovery following
lyophilization and subsequent ambient temperature storage than previous lyophiliza-
tion of polio vaccine (17). Agitation studies also showed a clear benefit of surfactants
such as pluronic F68 or polysorbate 20 for stability under conditions of physical stress
(Fig. S3A and B), which is an important factor to be considered during vaccine
manufacture (42, 43). Finally, the moisture content of our leading formulation was only
0.77%, which is considerably lower than that seen with previous polio vaccine lyoph-
ilization attempts (16). Thus, our leading formulation provides an optimal condition for
the stability of sIPV during lyophilization and ambient temperature storage.
Adopting a previously reported vaccination/boosting regimen (44–46), we showed
that thermostable lyophilized sIPV incubated at 37°
C for 4 weeks induced a potent
antipoliovirus immune response in cPVR mice and effectively protected these mice
from challenge with the WT PV Mahoney strain. Moreover, the levels of type 1 PV
neutralizing antibodies of mice vaccinated with the sIPV F4 formulation were similar to
the levels seen with commercial IPOL vaccine. A recent study by Tzeng and colleagues
used an injectable microparticle system that releases multiple pulses of antigen over
time. Their lead formulation also releases two pulses of antigen 1 month apart,
mimicking the vaccination/boosting regimen that is being used in the developing
world (47). Although the lyophilization formulation removes any transportation com-
plications due to its long-term stability, we observed that D-AgU level slightly de-
creased after 4 weeks of incubation at 25°
C. Maintaining a consistent D-AgU level for
the duration of the month will be paramount for vaccine stockpiles.
The typical maximum amount of time that the vaccine vial is stored at health posts
is 3 months. Karp and colleagues (48) have suggested that if the vaccine is stable for
more than 2 months, it is possible to remove cold-chain equipment at health posts and
stockpile the vaccines. If the vaccine acquires thermostability that lasts more than
12 months, it enables removal of cold-chain equipment at every check point and
redesign of the supply chain structure. To address this issue, further optimization
experiments are in progress to monitor the vaccine thermostability up to the 3-month
and 12-month time points. Therefore, further optimization will hopefully achieve a
“truly” temperature-stable polio vaccine. With the endgame of polio eradication in
sight, the shift from OPV to IPV will become a necessity to avoid vaccine-borne
poliovirus infections. Our study demonstrated that thermostable lyophilized sIPV in-
duces potent antipoliovirus antibodies in cPVR mice and effectively protects mice from
WT PV infection. Overall, this novel approach for high-throughput evaluation of anti-
genicity provides a means to accelerate the process of thermostable vaccine develop-
ment and to facilitate the availability and efficacy of vaccinations around the world.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viruses. Vero cells and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. 11965118) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (VWR Life Science Seradigm; catalog no. 1500-500) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. 15140163). Transient transfections for virus rescue were performed
with polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent (Polysciences; catalog no. 23966) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Scale-up culturing of Vero cells were done in a 3-liter spinner flask (Corning
Life Sciences; catalog no. 4502) after attachment of Vero cells to micro-carrier beads (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences; catalog no. 17044801). Media were changed every 2 days by removing half of the media and
introducing fresh media.
HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmid pREV encoding T7 RNA polymerase and Sabin strain PV
molecular clone (provided by Julie Pfeiffer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) for
96 h with PEI at a 3:1 ratio. When 90% to 95% CPE was confirmed after 96 h, cells were scraped off and
supernatant was collected. The supernatant/cell mixtures were freeze-thawed three times to release the
virion from the infected cells and passed through a 0.2-�m-pore-size polyethersulfone (PES) filter
(Nalgene; catalog no. 566-0020). The clarified supernatants were loaded at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 10 into a dish of Vero cells, and the cells and supernatants were collected after overnight
incubation at 32°
C. After the supernatants were clarified, the virus suspension was loaded at an MOI of

 30 into a suspension of Vero cells in a spinner flask. After overnight incubation at 32°
C, the supernatants
were collected and freeze-thawed three times.
Virus purification and inactivation (procedure summarized in Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). The viral suspension was first clarified by centrifugation and passed through a 0.2-�m-pore-
size PES filter. The clarified suspension was concentrated in a laboratory-scale tangential flow filtration
system (EMD Millipore; catalog no. XX42LSS11) using a Biomax 100-kDa cartridge (EMD Millipore; catalog
no. PXB100C50) at 20 lb/in2 input and 10 lb/in2 backpressure. Viral concentrate was loaded into a HiPrep
Sephacryl S-200 HR column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; catalog no. 17116601) and run through a
20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 0.5 ml/min on a Duoflow chromatography system (Bio-Rad;
catalog no. 7600037). The first 280-nm UV absorption peak was collected and loaded into a 5 ml HiTrap
DEAE fast-flow column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; catalog no. 17-5154-01) using 20 mM sodium
phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and the flowthrough showing a UV 280-nm absorption peak was collected
(Fig. 1).
Methanol-free formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. 28908) (at a final concentration of
0.025%) and M199 media (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog no. M0650) were added into the purified PV suspen-
sion. The suspension was then incubated at 37°
C for 14 days. The suspension was passed through a
0.2-�m-pore-size PES filter after 1 week to remove any aggregates. After 14 days, sodium bisulfite was
added to neutralize the formaldehyde. The suspension was then dialyzed using a 10-kDa Slide-A-Lyzer
cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. 66453) back into 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and
25 mM NaCl using the manufacturer’s instructions.
Virus titration and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-antigen unit measurement.
Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus inoculum were absorbed into the well of confluent Vero cells for 90 min
in 37°
C. After the removal of virus solution, cells were overlaid with 0.75% Avicel–DMEM and incubated
in a humidified incubator at 37°
C and 5% CO2 for 6 days. To visualize the plaques, the cells were fixed
by the use of 4% formaldehyde and stained by the use of 0.2% crystal violet solution.
ELISA plates were coated with bovine serum antipoliovirus antibody (National Institute for Biological
Standards and Control; catalog no. 234) at a concentration of 1:100. The sIPV was loaded at 2-fold
dilutions, and a WHO standard IPV (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control; catalog no.
12/104) was used to produce a standard curve. Mouse monoclonal antibody against type 1 PV (Abcam;
catalog no. ab47802) diluted at 1:1,000 was added for detection, and secondary anti-mouse horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; catalog no. 7076) diluted at 1:1,000 was loaded.
TMB solution (BD Biosciences; catalog no. 555214) was used for quantification on a FilterMax F5
microplate reader (Molecular Devices; F5) after the reaction was stopped using hydrosulfuric acid.
Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). SE-HPLC was performed
with an Agilent 1100 series instrument (Agilent Technologies; catalog no. G1380-90000) equipped with
a quaternary pump, a degasser, a temperature controlled autosampler, a UV/Vis diode array detector
(DAD), and an Agilent 1200 series fluorescence detector (FLD). A TSKgel G6000PWXL column (7.8 mm by
30 cm) or a TSKgel G3000SWXL column (7.8 mm by 30 cm) purchased from Tosoh Bioscience (King of
Prussia, PA) was used. At a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, 100 �l of sample was injected per analysis. The mobile
phase contained 50 mM sodium phosphate–140 mM NaCl at pH 6.7. The FLD was used as the primary
detector and was set to acquire data at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength
of 336 nm. For polio vaccine peak identification, the elution volume and the corresponding retention
time of the FLD signal were calculated on the basis of a standard calibration curve. To calculate polio
vaccine recovery, the area under the curve of formulations before lyophilization was compared to the
area under the curve of formulations after lyophilization.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. DLS measurements to obtain the mean radius of IPV were
performed with a DynaPro plate reader (Wyatt Technology). IPV samples were prepared by dilution of the
vaccine 1:1 with phosphate buffer and filtration through a 0.2-�m-pore-size PES filter for DLS analysis.
The samples were analyzed at a 25-�l volume in triplicate, and the mean particle radius for the vaccine
was calculated via the use of Dynamics software (version 7.1.7).
Lyophilized cake moisture determination. The water (or moisture) content in solid lyophilized
formulation was determined by coulometric titration using a Mettler C20 Coulometric Titrator (Mettler
Toledo; catalog no. 51105510) and an oven. Briefly, each lyophilized sample was brought to room
temperature before caps were removed for analysis and subsequently heated in an oven. The moisture
released from heating was carried from the oven to the Karl Fischer (KF) titration cell, which contained
KF reagent for the reaction. Moisture in the titration cell was continuously titrated until an endpoint was
reached. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Once an analysis was complete, results were generated
automatically.
Formulation matrix. All formulations were prepared at twice the concentration to allow a final 1:1
dilution by volume with the IPV sample. Each stock formulation was prepared by dissolving the stabilizers
and bulking agents into a 10 mM histidine buffer containing either polysorbate 20 or poloxamer 188. The
adjustment of pH was performed with HCl prior to sterile filtration using a 0.2-�m-pore-size PES
membrane. The final IPV-formulation solutions were prepared by mixing equal volumes of IPV sample
and stock formulations to generate the formulation matrix for testing. Each mixture was filled into
sterilized 2-cm3 glass vials (West Pharmaceutical Services) in two replicates and half-capped with
sterilized Diakyo 13-mm-diameter serum Flurotec stoppers (West Pharmaceutical Services). All sample
preparation and filling process steps were performed under aseptic conditions in a class II biological
safety cabinet.
Lyophilization process design of sIPV. For this study, all formulations were lyophilized using a
conservative cycle designed to generate elegant lyophilized cakes with acceptable moisture content

 without compromising the vaccine product quality and integrity. The half-capped vials were loaded into
a VirTis Genesis 25EL pilot lyophilizer (SP Scientific; catalog no. 100001991) at a shelf temperature of 5°
C.
Following loading, the vials were slowly cooled until frozen at �50°
C, held at the same temperature for
2 h, and subsequently warmed to �15°
C at a 0.5°
C/min ramp rate. The vials were held at �15°
C for 2 h
prior to initiation of the primary drying step. The primary drying was performed at a shelf temperature
of �15°
C and 13.3322 Pa (100 mTorr) chamber pressure for 10 h. The secondary drying step was
designed to remove residual water that did not sublimate during the primary drying step; thus, the shelf
temperature was increased to 25°
C and held for 3 h. After the completion of the lyophilization cycle, the
vials were stoppered in a partial vacuum, labeled, and stored at 2 to 8°
C before analysis.
Animal care. Transgenic poliovirus receptor (cPVR) mice were a gift from Raul Andino (University of
California, San Francisco) and were maintained in a University of Southern California (USC) mouse facility
according to the university’s regulations for animal care and handling (IACUC).
Poliovirus challenge. cPVR mice (6 weeks old; n � 8) with confirmed expression of PVR (data not
shown) were vaccinated with half of a human dose of IPV (20 DU) via the intraperitoneal (IP) route, and
they were boosted with the same dose after 2 weeks. At 14 days following the booster, the mice were
injected with WT 1 Mahoney PV at a dose of 50 PD50 (50% paralytic dose). Mice were monitored for 2
weeks using a blind paralysis scoring system outlined by the WHO for the mouse neurovirulence test for
OPV (the vaccination and challenge procedure is summarized in Fig. S4). If both legs dragged during
ambulatory motions, if the legs hung when climbing across a rail, and if the mice were unable to grip
the rail, the mice were scored as paralyzed. If the mice maintained a partial ability to move limbs forward
and if their legs hung when climbing across a rail but the mice recovered but were still unable to grip
the rail, the mice were scored as exhibiting paresis. Paresis mice received a score representing paralysis
if they showed signs of paresis for two consecutive days. Mice were euthanized after scoring as paralyzed
for a humane endpoint.
Microneutralization assay. The neutralization assay followed the WHO standardized protocol for
the assay (49, 50) with a little modification. Briefly, mice serum was collected by retro-orbital breeding
on day �1 and day 21. The blood was allowed to clot at 4°
C for 2 days and then centrifuged at
1,000 � g for 30 min at 4°
C, and the supernatant was collected. After heat inactivation, sera were diluted
in DMEM in a 2-fold serial dilution and an equal volume of 100 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)
of WT Mahoney PV was added and incubated for 3 h in 37°
C. These mixtures were then infected in Vero
cells (about 80% to 90% confluent) plated in a 96-well plate in 4°
C for 18 h, washed with PBS, and further
incubated for 5 days in DMEM. Neutralization antibody titers were calculated from dilutions that
corresponded to a 50% reduction of virus infection compared to control.
