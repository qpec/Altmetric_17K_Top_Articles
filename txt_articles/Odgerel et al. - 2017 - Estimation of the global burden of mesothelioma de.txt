background Mesothelioma is increasingly recognised 
as a global health issue and the assessment of its global 
burden is warranted.
Objectives to descriptively analyse national mortality 
data and to use reported and estimated data to calculate 
the global burden of mesothelioma deaths.
Methods For the study period of 1994 to 2014, we 
grouped 230 countries into 59 countries with quality 
mesothelioma mortality data suitable to be used for 
reference rates, 45 countries with poor quality data and 
126 countries with no data, based on the availability of 
data in the WHO Mortality Database. to estimate global 
deaths, we extrapolated the gender-specific and age-
specific mortality rates of the countries with quality data 
to all other countries.
results the global numbers and rates of mesothelioma 
deaths have increased over time. the 59 countries with 
quality data recorded 15 011 mesothelioma deaths 
per year over the 3 most recent years with available 
data (equivalent to 9.9 deaths per million per year). 
From these reference data, we extrapolated the global 
mesothelioma deaths to be 38 400 per year, based on 
extrapolations for asbestos use.
Conclusions although the validity of our extrapolation 
method depends on the adequate identification of 
quality mesothelioma data and appropriate adjustment 
for other variables, our estimates can be updated, refined 
and verified because they are based on commonly 
accessible data and are derived using a straightforward 
algorithm. Our estimates are within the range of 
previously reported values but higher than the most 
recently reported values.
InTrOduCTIOn
Malignant mesothelioma (‘mesothelioma’ here-
after) is an aggressive form of cancer that is caused 
by exposure to asbestos.1 Importantly, its inci-
dence is increasing worldwide.2 There have been 
repeated calls for the need to stop using asbestos 
and to eliminate asbestos-related diseases (ARD), 
including mesothelioma.3–5 ARD are beginning 
to be recognised as a global health issue,3 thereby 
warranting the assessment of the global burden 
of mesothelioma. The number of incident cases 
of mesothelioma is not always known, but most 
patients die within 2 
years,6 meaning that the 
number of mesothelioma deaths can be used as an 
indicator of the disease burden.
The mortality database7 maintained by the WHO 
compiles the number of deaths by disease category, 
calendar year, gender and age ranges, as reported 
by their member states (MS) and territories/insular 
regions (‘territories’ hereafter). Mesothelioma was 
first included in this database in 1994 coded as 
C45 under the 10th Revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases.8 We previously reported 
a descriptive analysis of mesothelioma deaths 
recorded in the database between 1994 and 2008.9 
Only a fraction of countries had reported data at 
that point, and only for a limited number of years; 
more data have since become available.
Several attempts have been made to estimate the 
global burden of mesothelioma. Driscoll et al esti-
mated the annual number at 43 
000 deaths.10 This 
figure has been widely quoted to guide preventive 
activities, such as in the WHO document on the 
elimination of ARD.4 The WHO document5 on 
chrysotile asbestos quoted 59 
000 annual deaths.11 
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 Study 
What this paper adds
 
► There have been repeated calls to eliminate 
asbestos-related diseases, including 
mesothelioma, and these diseases are 
beginning to be recognised as a global health 
issue, thereby warranting the assessment of the 
global burden of mesothelioma.
 
► The difference between the highest and lowest 
estimates of the global burden of mesothelioma 
is nearly twofold, with recent estimates being 
lower than earlier estimates, but it is unlikely 
that the actual numbers have decreased 
recently.
 
► The present study estimated the global 
mesothelioma burden by extrapolating the most 
recent available data in the WHO Mortality 
Database which produced better estimates due 
to the incorporation of more extensive and 
higher-quality data.
 
► Our estimates are within the range of previously 
reported values but higher than the most 
recently reported values by the Global Burden 
of Disease study.
 
► The great need for a worldwide asbestos 
ban notwithstanding, we must improve the 
quantification of the global mesothelioma 
burden to support additional preventive actions.

reported an estimate of 33 
700 annual deaths in 2015,12 then 
downgraded their estimate to 32 
400 annual deaths in 2016.13 
The difference between the highest and lowest estimates is 
nearly twofold, and it is unlikely that the actual numbers have 
decreased recently. However, these estimates are difficult to 
compare because it is difficult to access the analysed data or to 
examine the used methods in detail.
Thus, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to descrip-
tively analyse national mesothelioma mortality data in terms of 
their availability and quality; and (2) to use high quality data to 
estimate mortality in countries without high quality data so that 
a global burden of mesothelioma deaths can be estimated.
MATerIAls And MeThOds
We analysed data from 192 (99.0%) of 194 WHO-MS (Cook 
Islands and Niue were precluded for their lack of population 
data), 36 territories, and two non-MS (Kosovo and Liechtenstein, 
identified separately).14 15 We refer to these entities collectively 
as ‘countries’ (n=230) hereafter (see online supplementary table 
S1 for a list of the studied countries).
In November 2015, we extracted data from the WHO 
Mortality Database regarding mesothelioma (C45) deaths from 
1994 to 2014 in the MS and territories that reported these data. 
We used the number of mesothelioma deaths (combined for all 
types of mesothelioma) and population data to calculate three 
types of mortality rates (MR) for mesothelioma: (1) the crude 
MR (combined for gender); (2) the age-adjusted MR (combined 
for gender); and (3) the gender-specific and age-specific MR.
To calculate the crude MR for individual countries, we divided 
the observed number of mesothelioma deaths (combined for 
gender) by the total population (person-years) of the country in 
the same calendar years (see online supplementary table S1 for 
calendar years used in analysis). To calculate the age-adjusted 
MR (combined for gender) for a group of countries, we applied 
the direct age-adjustment method to the combined age structure 
of a group of individual countries for a defined period, with 
reference to the world population in the year 2000.16 To calcu-
late the gender-specific and age-specific MR for a group of coun-
tries, we divided the observed number of mesothelioma deaths 
by the corresponding gender-specific and age-specific population 
(person-years) (using 5-year age groups from ‘0–4’ to ‘75+”) in 
the same calendar years. Population data were obtained primarily 
from the United Nations17 and complemented with information 
from the US Census Bureau.18
All studied countries (n=230) were classified into those 104 
countries that had reported data on mesothelioma mortality 
and the 126 countries that had no reported data. Of the 104 
countries with data, we then excluded those 45 countries that 
had (1) a crude MR for the entire period of 1994–2014 of 0.5 
death per million per year or less (ie, less than half the widely 
accepted background level of mesothelioma mortality6 19 20) on 
the basis that these countries suffered from under-reporting 
and/or underdiagnosis (under-reporting hereafter); (2) two or 
fewer reported years of data; or (3) 10 or fewer total reported 
deaths for the entire period. The remaining 59 countries were 
then used to provide sets of reference rates for use in calculating 
global mesothelioma burdens (see online supplementary table S2 
for a synopsis of the grouping of studied countries). Reference 
rates specified by age and gender were calculated separately in 
terms of continental region, historical level of asbestos use and 
percentage of the workforce in the industrial sector.
For calculations based on asbestos use, we extracted data on 
raw asbestos use from the US Geological Survey (USGS)21 22 and 
its updated data file (RL Virta, USGS, personal communication, 
2013). We adopted the USGS definition of use (production+im-
port-export), and obtained data by country across various time 
intervals. We interpolated use values for calendar years lacking 
data and treated negative values as 0. Asbestos use in coun-
tries that made a political transition was treated as previously 
described.23 Per capita asbestos use was calculated by dividing 
the volume of asbestos use by the population size (obtained as 
described above), and complemented for the period of 1925–
1950 based on Lahmeyer.24 Cumulative asbestos use for the 
period 1925–1985 was considered to contribute to mesothe-
lioma deaths of the study period. Countries were stratified into 
four subgroups (‘no use,’ ‘low,’ ‘middle’ and ‘high’) based on 
their levels of per capita and cumulative asbestos use (see online 
supplementary table S3). The USGS reported Malta as not 
having used asbestos, but we judged that the country should be 
grouped into the ‘low’ subgroup based on separate information 
(M Gauchi, Malta OSHA, personal communication, 2016).
For calculations based on continent, we defined Oceania, 
Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas according to the United 
Nations.25 For calculations based on employment in the industrial 
sector, we extracted the percentage of the workforce employed 
in ‘industry’ (the other two categories were ‘agriculture’ and 
‘services’) by country according to the World Bank.26 No data 
were available for 49 of our studied countries. Employment data 
were extracted for the period 1980–2012; no data were avail-
able for earlier periods. We grouped all listed countries into three 
equal-sized subgroups designated as ‘low,’ ‘middle’ and ‘high.’ 
Countries not listed in the above database were placed in the ‘no 
data’ subgroup. The latter subgroup did not include any country 
that reported mesothelioma deaths, so the value of one death per 
million population per year (ie, the widely accepted background 
level for mesothelioma)6 19 20 was used for extrapolation.
We conducted Pearson partial correlation analyses to inves-
tigate the relationships between crude MR and the number of 
reporting years and the total reported deaths. We conducted 
linear regression analyses to investigate the time trend of the 
age-adjusted MR, and further to identify the best-fit model for 
the age-adjusted MR calculated as the moving average of the 
annual age-adjusted MR for a combination of calendar years 
with available data. Weighting was applied for the size of the 
at-risk population. To determine the best combination of 
calendar years optimal for extrapolation, the best-fit model was 
identified by comparing the R2 and p values. Microsoft Excel 
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington DC, USA) and 
SAS V
.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) were used 
to compile and analyse the data.

Figure 1 shows the availability of data on mesothelioma deaths in 
the WHO Mortality Database, grouped by region. One hundred 
and four countries reported mesothelioma deaths (92 
MS and 
12 territories); the number of reporting countries varied widely 
by region, ranging from three in Oceania to 39 in the Americas, 
and also by calendar year, ranging from three in 1994 to 75 
in 2009. Similarly, the number of reporting years varied widely 
by country, ranging from one (nine countries) to 20 (the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia), with a mean and median of 10.0 and 
11.5 years, respectively, and a total of 1043 years. Of the MS, 
102 did not report mesothelioma deaths to the WHO.

Methodology
significant correlation was found for the latter relationship 
(partial correlation coefficient, 0.72; p<0.001; adjusted for 
population size), but not the former (partial correlation coef-
ficient, 0.12; p=0.38; adjusted for population size). The crude 
MR for the 104 reporting countries varied 103-fold, ranging 
from 0.04 (in Egypt) to 44.56 (in the British Virgin Islands) with 
a mean and median of 6.60 and 2.91 deaths per million per year, 
respectively.
Of the 104 reporting countries, 21 (20.2%) recorded a crude 
MR of 0.5 or fewer deaths per million per year, 19 (18.3%) 
reported data for 2 
years or less and 30 (28.8%) reported a total 
of 10 or fewer mesothelioma deaths; these groups overlapped 
(figure 2). Due to failing to satisfy one or more of the predeter-
mined criteria for high quality data, 45 (43.3%) countries were 
deemed to have poor quality data; the remaining 59 countries 
(56.7%) were used to compile reference rates suitable for extrap-
olation. The 45 countries with poor quality data were combined 
with the 126 countries with no reported data (100 
MS+24 terri-
tories+two 
non-MS) to form the group of 171 countries for 
which the number of mesothelioma deaths was estimated (see 
online supplementry table S2).
The 59 countries used for reference rates represented all 
regions but were skewed by region, with two in Oceania, one in 
Africa, 10 in Asia, 32 in Europe and 14 in the Americas (figure 1, 
column RCR-r). The total number of reporting years for these 
countries was also skewed by region, with 25, 18, 112, 480 and 
194 years for Oceania, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas, 
respectively (figure 1, column RYR-r). Our reference rates were 
based on a total of 829 national annual data sets (ie, 79.5% of 
1043 reported years).
As shown in figure 3, the age-adjusted MR of the 59 coun-
tries with quality data generally increased during our study 
period when we observed the moving average of the age-ad-
justed MR for the most recent 1, 2 or 3 years of reported data 
(designated as models A, B and C, respectively). Among the 
three models, C showed the best fit (β1=−0.09, p<0.0001 and 
adjusted R2=0.64, p<0.0001 for the model). Because the 
3-year moving average model showed the best fit for trend, the 
gender-specific and age-specific MR of the three most recent 
years with available data was used for extrapolation (figure 1, 
red cells).
Table 1 shows that the 59 countries with quality data repre-
senting 21.1% of the total population recorded an average of 
15 011 deaths per year during these years, which was equiva-
lent to 9.90 deaths per million per year. This reported number 
of 15 011 annual deaths was added to the annual number of 
deaths estimated by extrapolation and adjusted for selected 
attributes. This produced totals of 38 400, 36 300 and 37 500 
deaths, based on adjustment for asbestos use, continent and 
employment, respectively. Online supplementary table S4 
shows the reported and estimated deaths per year by country 
for each attribute.
Table 2 shows that of the 38 
388 mesothelioma deaths per 
year estimated by the asbestos-adjusted extrapolation method, 
15 
011 (39.1%) deaths occurred in countries used to compile the 
reference rates and 23 
377 (60.9%) were obtained by extrapola-
tion (2162 deaths in countries with poor quality data and 21 
215 
deaths in countries with no data). Of the referenced number of 
15 
011 mesothelioma deaths, 77.9% were men. Of the estimated 
number of 23 
377 mesothelioma deaths, 78.4% were men. Of 
the total of 38 
388 mesothelioma deaths, 78.2% were men. 
The continent-adjusted and employment-adjusted extrapolation 
methods produced breakdowns similar to those obtained using 
the asbestos-adjusted extrapolation method.

Methodology
dIsCussIOn
The present study estimates the global mesothelioma burden and 
provides a detailed examination of the annual reported and esti-
mated data. Data on mesothelioma mortality showed consider-
able variations in the number of reporting years and availability 
by country, with more data generally available for Europe and 
the Americas. The data that we used for reference rates were 
limited even further to 59 reporting countries, which recorded 
15 011 mesothelioma deaths per year during the 3 most recent 
years with available data. By applying their gender-specific and 
age-specific MR to all other countries (with poor quality data 
and no reported data), we estimated the global mesothelioma 
burden to be in the range of 36 300 to 38 400 annual deaths 
after adjusting for selected attributes. Our estimates of the 
global mesothelioma burden are within the range of previously 
reported values10 11 but higher than the most recently reported 
values.12 13
More data on mesothelioma deaths have become available in 
recent years, but the data quality varies across countries. If the 
different methods used for estimation are comparable in their 
validity, then the more recent studies (including the present 
one) should produce better estimates due to their incorpora-
tion of more and higher-quality data. Furthermore, our method 
employed objective criteria to identify good quality data for 
extrapolation. In effect, about 40% of our estimated number 
comprised data that were originally reported by countries (ie, the 
estimated fraction was about 60%). Because our estimates and 
those of the GBD team incorporated newer data, these estimates

are likely to be more accurate than the earlier estimates, and to 
better represent the current situation.
The analysed countries had a total population of 7.17 
billion, 
which reasonably represented the global population (online 
supplementary table S1).
The crude MR of countries reporting data on mesothelioma 
deaths was clearly correlated with the number of reported cases, 
but not with the number of reporting years (figure 2). Because 
mesothelioma remains relatively rare and difficult to diagnose, 
countries may need to accumulate experience in dealing with 
patients before they can report reliable data. Depicting the 
global trend of mesothelioma MR during a specific time frame is 
further complicated by the fact that the number and composition 
of reporting countries vary by year. No country reported meso-
thelioma deaths for all of the 21 studied years. We considered 
the one, two, or three most recent calendar years with avail-
able data in order to maximise our use of the scarce data. We 
observed increasing rates with all three models of age-adjusted 
MR, and chose the 3-year model based on the fitness of trend. 
As our objective was to estimate the current burden of meso-
thelioma mortality, we extrapolated the most recently available 
3-year mortality data in the referenced countries to the non-ref-
erenced and non-reporting countries. However, current means 
‘the latest available’ which is an average of, for example, 3 
years

with available data for 57 out of 59 countries occurred during

occurred in 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2006, 2009, 2011, respec-
tively (online supplementary table S1, S4).
We calculated the crude MR for all reporting countries regard-
less of population size to address our first objective, which was 
to describe the national mortality data in terms of availability 
and quality. The WHO discourages the calculation of annual 
MR for countries with populations less than 500 
000 because 
‘any slight variation in numbers would affect to a large extent 
rates’.7 However, our calculations of MR (crude, age-adjusted 
and gender-specific and age-specific) compensated for small 
populations because the reporting years were accumulated. 
Furthermore, the criteria we used to identify countries with 
quality data tended to preclude countries with small popula-
tions; the only countries used in our reference rates with popu-
lations of less than 500 
000 were Iceland and Malta. These two 
countries recorded high crude MRs that are likely to be true, 
given the multiple years that these countries have reported.
Our extrapolation method required that we assume compa-
rability between the referenced and estimated countries in 
terms of MR. Adjusting for the selected attributes of continent, 
employment and asbestos (which assumed comparability after

Methodology
stratification) was done based on continental affiliation, indus-
trial profile and historical asbestos use, respectively. The most 
relevant extrapolation method is likely to be that adjusted by 
historical asbestos use, because mesothelioma is almost exclu-
sively attributable to past asbestos exposure and the extent of 
asbestos use has repeatedly predicted subsequent rates of ARD 
at national levels.27–29 The method of asbestos-adjusted extrapo-
lation produced the highest estimate of mesothelioma deaths at 
about 38 
000 per year. We believe this to be our best estimate.
There are obvious limitations in the present study. First, many 
countries, including those that recorded asbestos usage, did not 
report mesothelioma deaths to the WHO. The non-reporting of 
mesothelioma in a country that used asbestos at substantial levels 
with sufficient elapsed time cannot be interpreted as an indication 
that there was no case of the disease. Second, we used arbitrary 
criteria to define countries as under-reporting or reporting but 
lacking experience, and this may have introduced bias in either 
direction. However, the less than ideal capacity to diagnose and 
report mesothelioma cases in some of the countries used in our 
reference rates should have contributed to under-estimation. 
Third, the exact timing of asbestos use differed between the 
high-use countries of economically developed status and those 
of developing status, such as in Asia, where asbestos use started 
relatively late. Thus, the extrapolated numbers for a few of these 
developing countries may overestimate their current number of 
mesothelioma deaths and better reflect the reality in the years 
to come.
A strength of the present method is that we accounted for the 
gender and age structures of the referenced and estimated coun-
tries by extrapolating gender-specific and age-specific MR to 
the corresponding gender-specific and age-specific populations. 
Furthermore, our findings are easily reproducible due to the use 
of commonly accessible data and a straightforward algorithm. 
The present estimates are thus amenable to being updated, 
refined and verified. The lack of such features in earlier studies 
prohibited reassessment of the estimated values. In contrast, this 
study may be verified against actual numbers and cross-verified 
with existing methods. The estimation of the global mesothe-
lioma burden will naturally improve as more countries report 
quality data and fewer countries require estimates to be made. 
The WHO Mortality Database will accumulate more data over 
time, but the data will continue to vary in their quality and avail-
ability given between-country differences in the medico-social 
infrastructures and current stages in the mesothelioma epidemic. 
Because these national differences are likely to persist for some 
time, the efforts to estimate the global mesothelioma burden 
will continue to be challenged. The great need for a worldwide 
asbestos ban notwithstanding, we must improve the quantifica-
tion of the global mesothelioma burden to support additional 
preventive actions.
COnClusIOns
The availability and quality of national data on mesothelioma 
deaths varied widely. The data from 59 countries were deemed 
to be suitable for estimating deaths in all other countries. These 
59 countries recorded 15 
011 mesothelioma deaths per year 
during the three most recent years with available data. Our best 
estimate of the global mesothelioma burden is 38 
400 annual 
deaths. Clearly, mesothelioma is a global health issue.
