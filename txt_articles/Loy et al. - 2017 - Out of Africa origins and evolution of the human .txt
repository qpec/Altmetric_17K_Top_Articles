Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for more than 95% of all human malaria infections,
and thus pose a serious public health challenge. To control and potentially eliminate these pathogens, it is
important to understand their origins and evolutionary history. Until recently, it was widely believed that
P. falciparum had co-evolved with humans (and our ancestors) over millions of years, whilst P. vivax was
assumed to have emerged in southeastern Asia following the cross-species transmission of a parasite
from a macaque. However, the discovery of a multitude of Plasmodium spp. in chimpanzees and gorillas
has refuted these theories and instead revealed that both P. falciparum and P. vivax evolved from parasites
infecting wild-living African apes. It is now clear that P. falciparum resulted from a recent cross-
species transmission of a parasite from a gorilla, whilst P. vivax emerged from an ancestral stock of
parasites that infected chimpanzees, gorillas and humans in Africa, until the spread of the protective
Duffy-negative mutation eliminated P. vivax from human populations there. Although many questions
remain concerning the biology and zoonotic potential of the P. falciparum- and P. vivax-like parasites
infecting apes, comparative genomics, coupled with functional parasite and vector studies, are likely to
yield new insights into ape Plasmodium transmission and pathogenesis that are relevant to the treatment
and prevention of human malaria.

1. Introduction
Of the Plasmodium spp. known to commonly infect humans,
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax cause the vast major-
ity of malaria morbidity and mortality, and are the principal targets
of malaria prevention and eradication efforts. Plasmodium falci-
parum is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa where it is respon-
sible for nearly 200 million clinical cases (Bhatt et al., 2015) and
over 300,000 malaria-related deaths annually, predominantly in
children under 5 years of age (World Health Organization, 2015).
Plasmodium vivax is rare in sub-Saharan Africa, but endemic in
many parts of Asia, Oceania, as well as Central and South America
where it causes an estimated 16 million cases of clinical malaria,
which represents approximately half of all malaria cases outside
Africa (World Health Organization, 2015).
Given the devastating effects of malaria, the origins of the Plas-
modium parasites infecting humans have long been a subject of
interest. Descriptions of malaria-like illness can be found in ancient
texts from China, India, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, indicat-
ing that humans have been combatting Plasmodium infections
throughout much of our recorded history (Carter and Mendis,
2002). Indeed, variants in the human genome that are associated
with resistance to Plasmodium infection and malaria-associated
disease are estimated to be thousands of years old (Hedrick,
2011). One such variant is the sickle cell trait, which is common
in African populations and protects against fatal P. falciparum
malaria (Taylor et al., 2012). Similarly, a mutation that abolishes
the expression of the Duffy antigen receptor of chemokines on
the surface of red blood cells (the so-called ‘‘Duffy-negative pheno-
type”) approaches fixation in western and central Africa, and con-
fers almost complete protection from P. vivax parasitemia (Miller
et al., 1976; Howes et al., 2011). Together, these findings indicate
that Plasmodium infections have impacted human health for mil-
lennia, but the prevailing view has been that this history goes back
much further.

 One long-standing hypothesis suggested that humans and
chimpanzees each inherited P. falciparum-like infections from their
common ancestor, and that these parasites co-evolved with their
respective host species for millions of years (Escalante and Ayala,
1994). In contrast, P. vivax was believed to have arisen several hun-
dred thousand years ago, following the cross-species transmission
of a parasite from a macaque in southeastern Asia (Escalante et al.,
2005; Jongwutiwes et al., 2005; Mu et al., 2005; Neafsey et al.,
2012). However, both of these theories have recently been refuted
following the characterisation of a large number of additional Plas-
modium parasites from African apes. Specifically, it is now clear
that P. falciparum infection is relatively new for humans and arose
after the acquisition of a parasite from a gorilla, likely within the
past 10,000 years (Liu et al., 2010a; Sundararaman et al., 2016).
Similarly, P. vivax did not emerge in Asia, but represents a bottle-
necked lineage that escaped out of Africa before the spread of Duffy
negativity rendered African humans resistant to P. vivax (Liu et al.,
2014). In this review, we describe the findings that led to this new
understanding and summarise what is known about the epidemi-
ology, vector tropism, zoonotic potential and pathogenicity of the
ape precursors of the human parasites.
2. Early studies of ape Plasmodium infections
The first indication that African apes harbour Plasmodium infec-
tions was the finding of three morphologically distinct forms of
parasites in the blood of wild-caught chimpanzees (Pan troglo-
dytes)
and
western
gorillas
(Gorilla
gorilla)
in
Cameroon
(Reichenow, 1920). Microscopic characterisation identified para-
sites from apes that resembled P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae,
and either Plasmodium ovale or (the similar) P. vivax in humans,
suggesting the existence of distinct Plasmodium spp. which were
classified as Plasmodium reichenowi, Plasmodium rhodaini and Plas-
modium schwetzi, respectively (Sluiter et al., 1922; Brumpt, 1939).
Moreover, P. falciparum and P. reichenowi were found to differ sub-
stantially from the other Plasmodium spp. in both life cycle and
gametocyte morphology, prompting their placement in a separate
subgenus, termed Laverania (Bray, 1958; Coatney et al., 1971). The
existence of two divergent clades of malaria parasites infecting pri-
mates was subsequently confirmed when the various Plasmodium
spp. were first molecularly characterised (Fig. 1). Comparing rRNA
small subunit gene sequences, Escalante and Ayala (1994) showed
that amongst the known species, P. falciparum and P. reichenowi
were the closest relatives of each other, and that both were only
distantly related to other Plasmodium spp. Assuming that rRNA
gene sequences in Plasmodium spp. evolved at the same rate as
had been estimated for some bacteria, it was inferred that P. falci-
parum and P. reichenowi had diverged �10 million years ago, close
to the time of the human-chimpanzee common ancestor. This led
to the conclusion that parasites infecting humans and chimpanzees
had co-diverged with their respective hosts (Escalante and Ayala,
1994). Due to a lack of preserved material, gene sequences from
P. schwetzi and P. rhodaini were never determined, thus leaving
their relationship to other malaria parasites open to question.
Interest in ape Laverania infections was rekindled in 2009 when
Ollomo and colleagues found parasites morphologically similar to
P. reichenowi in the blood of two pet chimpanzees from Gabon
(Ollomo et al., 2009). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences revealed that these parasites were related to, but diver-
gent from, P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, suggesting the existence
of a third Laverania sp. which they named Plasmodium gaboni
(Ollomo et al., 2009). Follow-up studies of additional captive and
wild apes confirmed a greater diversity of Laverania parasites,
but interpretations differed as to the number of species and their

 host associations. Amplifying mtDNA and nuclear gene sequences
of parasites from members of two chimpanzee subspecies, Rich
and colleagues (2009) identified several distinct Laverania lineages,
but chose to consider all of them as ‘‘P. reichenowi”, even though
one of these new lineages corresponded to P. gaboni (Rich et al.,
2009). In contrast, Krief and colleagues (2010) classified a similar
diversity of chimpanzee parasites into three species, termed P.
reichenowi, Plasmodium billcollinsi and Plasmodium billbrayi, where
the latter corresponded to P. gaboni (Krief et al., 2010). These inves-
tigators also amplified P. falciparum mtDNA from the blood of cap-
tive bonobos (Pan paniscus), concluding that this ape species served
as the likely source of the human infection (Krief et al., 2010).
Finally, Prugnolle and colleagues developed non-invasive methods
that permitted parasite detection in ape faecal samples, which
identified diverse Laverania lineages not only in chimpanzees but
also in western gorillas (Prugnolle et al., 2010). However, these
investigators classified all chimpanzee parasites as either P. reich-
enowi or P. gaboni, and concluded that P. falciparum-like sequences
found in faecal samples of wild-living western gorillas indicated
ongoing transmission from humans to gorillas (Prugnolle et al.,
2010). The consensus of these studies was that wild-living apes
harbour a much greater diversity of Laverania parasites than previ-
ously recognised. However, there was disagreement concerning
the number of ape Laverania spp. as well as the origin of P. falci-
parum, with some investigators implicating chimpanzees (Rich
et al., 2009; Duval et al., 2010; Prugnolle et al., 2010) and others
bonobos (Krief et al., 2010) as the original source of the parasites
now infecting humans.
3. Six Laverania spp. in wild-living chimpanzees and gorillas
The seemingly discrepant results from these early studies were
reconciled by comprehensive studies of Laverania infections in
wild-living apes, which employed improved faeces-based detec-
tion methods and targeted different regions of both organelle
and nuclear parasite genomes (Liu et al., 2010a). One technical
advance was the use of limiting dilution PCR (termed single gen-
ome amplification or SGA), which in contrast to standard (bulk)
PCR precludes the generation of in vitro recombinants that con-
found phylogenetic analyses (Liu et al., 2010b). Using this approach
to characterise the molecular epidemiology of ape malaria, Plas-
modium infections were found to be widespread in both chim-
panzees and western gorillas, including parasites that were
closely related to human P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax (Liu
et al., 2010a). However, the great majority of parasite sequences
grouped within one of three chimpanzee-specific or three gorilla-
specific parasite lineages, with each clade being well supported
and quite distinct from the others, pointing to the existence of
six ape Laverania spp. (Fig. 1). Subsequent surveys of wild-living
apes in Gabon (Boundenga et al., 2015) and Cote d’Ivoire (Kaiser
et al., 2010) confirmed these findings, demonstrating that chim-
panzees and western gorillas represent a substantial Laverania
reservoir.
Fig. 2A summarises the current knowledge concerning the geo-
graphic distribution and host species association of ape Laverania
infections at over 100 field sites across sub-Saharan Africa
(Kaiser et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010a, 2016; De Nys et al., 2013;
Boundenga et al., 2015). All chimpanzee subspecies, including
western (Pan troglodytes verus), Nigeria-Cameroon (Pan troglodytes
ellioti), central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and eastern (Pan troglo-
dytes schweinfurthii) chimpanzees, as well as western lowland
gorillas (G. g. gorilla) are endemically infected with Laverania para-
sites, with faecal detection rates ranging from 24% to 40% (Table 1).
The true prevalence rates are likely to be considerably higher, since
the amount of Laverania DNA that is shed in faecal samples is sub-
stantially less than that from replicating parasites in the blood (Liu
et al., 2010a; Sundararaman et al., 2016). Although Cross River
gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli), eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla ber-
ingei graueri), and bonobos (in the wild) have appeared to be free of
Laverania infections, the numbers of individuals tested from these
potential hosts are still too small to draw definitive conclusions
(Liu et al., 2010a).
Analyses of nearly 3,500 SGA-derived mt, apicoplast and
nuclear DNA sequences from ape faecal and blood samples have
confirmed the existence of six Laverania spp. (Figs. 1 and 3). Of
these, P. reichenowi, P. gaboni and P. billcollinsi have thus far only
been identified in chimpanzees, whilst Plasmodium praefalciparum,
Plasmodium blacklocki and Plasmodium adleri have only been found
in western gorillas. All six Laverania spp. have been classified based
on numerous SGA-derived organelle and nuclear gene sequences
from many different field isolates (Liu et al., 2010a, 2016). In addi-
tion, whole genome sequencing of P. reichenowi and P. gaboni par-
asites confirmed that they represent distinct species, with no
evidence
of
interspecific
hybridization
(Otto
et
al.,
2014;
Sundararaman et al., 2016). Whilst it has been argued that detec-
tion of parasite DNA in either faeces or blood, in itself, is not proof
of productive Plasmodium infection (Valkiunas et al., 2011), the
high prevalence rates of Laverania infections (Table 1) and their
widespread distribution (Fig. 2A) provide compelling evidence for
significant ongoing transmission. Of note, Laverania parasites exhi-
bit strict host specificity when infecting wild-living apes, including
at field sites where all six species are co-circulating in sympatric
chimpanzee and gorilla populations (octagons in Fig. 2A). SGA,
which yields a proportional representation of all parasites present
in a sample, failed to detect even minor fractions of parasites from
the ‘‘wrong” species in more than 100 Laverania-infected apes (Liu
et al., 2016). In contrast, host species specificity in captivity is not
absolute (Duval et al., 2010; Pacheco et al., 2013), and so it will be
of great interest to decipher to what extent host and/or vector biol-
ogy contribute to host species restriction in the wild.
4. Origin of P. falciparum in western gorillas
Characterisation of the various ape Laverania spp. identified one
lineage in western gorillas that was comprised of parasites that
were nearly identical to P. falciparum (Liu et al., 2010a; Prugnolle
et al., 2010). This was initially interpreted as indicating that human
parasites can infect gorillas (Prugnolle et al., 2010). However, with
the characterisation of mtDNA sequences from large numbers of
additional wild-living gorillas, it became apparent that all extant
P. falciparum strains from humans fall within the radiation of these
gorilla parasites (Liu et al., 2010a). Analyses of both mt (Fig. 3A)
and nuclear (Fig. 3B) sequences confirmed these relationships,
indicating that human P. falciparum resulted from the cross-
species transmission of a parasite that had previously diversified
in gorillas. This gorilla parasite lineage has been named P. praefal-
ciparum to indicate its role in the origin of P. falciparum. To inves-
tigate how often P. praefalciparum crossed the species barrier to
humans, we constructed a phylogenetic tree from concatenated
mt protein sequences of these and closely related P. reichenowi par-
asites, which yielded evidence for only a single transmission event
(Fig. 3C). These findings are consistent with results from epidemi-
ological surveys in Cameroon and Gabon, which demonstrated that
humans living in the immediate vicinity of wild-living chim-
panzees and gorillas do not harbour ape Laverania parasites
(Sundararaman et al., 2013; Delicat-Loembet et al., 2015). Thus,
P. praefalciparum parasites appear incapable of infecting humans,
suggesting that the particular gorilla parasite strain that was able
to cross the host species barrier must have carried one or more

89
 highly unusual mutations that conferred an ability to colonise
humans.
Although alternative hypotheses concerning the origin of P. fal-
ciparum have been proposed, none has stood the test of time. For
example, the finding of a P. praefalciparum infection in a greater
spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans) (Fig. 3C) was taken
to indicate that P. falciparum could have originated in monkeys
(Prugnolle et al., 2011). However, this theory ignored the fact that
P. praefalciparum sequences had been amplified from numerous
wild-living gorillas at 11 different field sites up to 750 km apart,
whereas only a single captive infected monkey was reported
(Sharp et al., 2011). Indeed, subsequent testing of nearly 300

the common chimpanzee (inset: Pan troglodytes verus, black; Pan troglodytes ellioti, purple; Pan troglodytes troglodytes, magenta; Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, blue), the Cross
River (Gorilla gorilla diehli, yellow stripe), western lowland (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, red stripe), and eastern lowland (Gorilla beringei graueri, cyan stripe) gorilla, as well as the
bonobo (Pan paniscus, orange) in sub-Saharan Africa (Caldecott and Miles, 2005). Field sites are labelled by a two-letter code as previously reported (Liu et al., 2010a, 2014) or
numbers (Boundenga et al., 2015), and those where ape malaria was detected are highlighted in yellow, with black, green or red lettering indicating that chimpanzees,
gorillas, or both were infected. Triangles denote ape rescue centres and asterisks mosquito collection sites. Circles, squares and hexagons identify locations where faecal
samples were collected from chimpanzees, gorillas or both species, respectively. Ovals indicate bonobo sites. At the TA and KB sites, blood and tissue samples were obtained
from injured or deceased habituated chimpanzees (Kaiser et al., 2010; Krief et al., 2010; De Nys et al., 2013). Diamonds in (B) indicate the capture sites of ape P. vivax infected
sanctuary chimpanzees (black border) and gorillas (green border), respectively, and a star denotes the location where a European forester became infected with ape P. vivax
(Prugnolle et al., 2013). Data were compiled from published (Kaiser et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010a, 2014, 2016; De Nys et al., 2013; Paupy et al., 2013; Prugnolle et al., 2013;
Boundenga et al., 2015) and unpublished studies (Table 1). The full names and locations of all sites are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

 wild-caught greater spot-nosed monkeys failed to identify a single
P. praefalciparum infection, indicating that this monkey species is
not a natural reservoir for this parasite (Ayouba et al., 2012). Sim-
ilarly, amplification of P. falciparum sequences from captive bono-
bos was taken to indicate that the human malaria parasite
originated in this ape species (Krief et al., 2010). However, phylo-
genetic analysis of these sequences revealed that they were com-
pletely interspersed with human P. falciparum (Fig. 3C), which
together with the finding of drug resistance mutations in the
bonobo parasites (Krief et al., 2010), indicated that these apes
had acquired parasites from the local human population. This is
not without precedent, since human P. falciparum has on occasion
been found to infect chimpanzees in captivity (Duval et al., 2010;
Pacheco et al., 2013).
5. Emergence of P. falciparum in humans
Plasmodium falciparum has long been suspected to exhibit
unusually low levels of genetic diversity (Rich et al., 1998), but
the underlying causes have remained unclear. Recent genome-
wide comparisons of the chimpanzee parasites P. gaboni and P.
reichenowi have shown that their within-species genetic diversity
is approximately 10-fold higher than that seen in P. falciparum
(Sundararaman et al., 2016). Thus, the extremely low diversity
amongst extant P. falciparum strains is not a general characteristic
of Laverania parasites. Recent selective sweeps of drug resistance
mutations have reduced levels of polymorphism in P. falciparum,
but because resistant and sensitive strains continue to recombine
in mosquitoes, diversity has only been reduced in the immediate
vicinity of the selected loci (Nair et al., 2003; Volkman et al.,
2007). Instead, the greatly reduced level of diversity across the
entire P. falciparum genome most likely resulted from a recent sev-
ere population bottleneck, which is most plausibly explained by
the gorilla-to-human cross-species transmission event.
Previous attempts to date the last common ancestor of P. falci-
parum strains have yielded estimates of up to several hundred
thousand years ago (Hughes and Verra, 2001; Pacheco et al.,
2011; Neafsey et al., 2012), but all made assumptions concerning
the Plasmodium molecular clock that are difficult to justify. In con-
trast, others have proposed a much shorter time scale, arguing that
the low probability of maintaining endemic P. falciparum infections
in
human
hunter-gatherer
populations
(Livingstone,
1958),
together with estimates of the age of P. falciparum resistance muta-
tions in Africa (Hedrick, 2011), favour a much more recent emer-
gence (Carter and Mendis, 2002). From a comparison of 12
strains from different countries in Africa and Asia, the average
diversity of P. falciparum at fourfold degenerate sites (which should
be neutral and thus reflect mutation rates) was estimated to be
8 � 10�4 per site (Sundararaman et al., 2016). Published mutation
rates for P. falciparum are in the range 1–10 � 10�9 mutations per
site per replication cycle (Paget-McNicol and Saul, 2001; Lynch,
2010; Bopp et al., 2013), and it can be deduced from the P. falci-
parum life cycle that parasites are likely to undergo at least 200
replication cycles per year, even assuming varying lengths of time
that the parasites spend in either the vector or the mammalian
host. This suggests that the observed level of genetic diversity in
P. falciparum could have readily accumulated within the past
10,000 years.
6. Allelic dimorphism in ape Laverania spp.
Nearly 30 years ago, it was recognised that a gene (now called
msp-1) encoding a merozoite surface protein exists as two highly
divergent alleles in P. falciparum, with recombination suppressed
over much of the length of the gene (Tanabe et al., 1987). Similar
allelic dimorphism was subsequently found for other genes encod-
ing merozoite surface proteins including msp-2, msp-3 and msp-6
(Roy et al., 2008). The extent of divergence is extreme: for example,
large regions of the two msp-1 alleles in P. falciparum are more dif-
ferent from each other than one of those alleles is from the one
msp-1 allele so far found in P. gaboni, suggesting that the P. falci-
parum alleles diverged prior to the last common ancestor of extant
Laverania spp. (Roy, 2015). This suggests some form of selection
that maintains divergent allelic types over very long periods of
time, analogous, for example, to the trans-specific polymorphism
of self-incompatibility alleles in a family of flowering plants (Sola-
naceae), which may date to more than 30 million years (Myr) ago
(Ioerger et al., 1990). Although the mechanism(s) that maintain the
dimorphic msp alleles in P. falciparum remain largely unknown
(Roy and Ferreira, 2015), some genes appear to be under balancing
selection (Ochola et al., 2010; Amambua-Ngwa et al., 2012) and
represent targets of allele type-specific antibody responses that

 confer protective immunity against malaria (Polley et al., 2007;
Tetteh et al., 2013).
For msp-1, msp-3 and msp-6, we have found evidence for both
allelic types in P. praefalciparum (Liu, W., Sundararaman, S.A.,
Loy, D.E., Learn, G.H., Li, Y., Plenderleith, L.J., Ndjango, J.B., Speede,
S., Rayner, J.C., Peeters, M., Hahn, B.H., Sharp, P.M., 2015. On the ori-
gins of allelic dimorphism of the Plasmodium falciparum msp-1 and
msp-6 genes. Am. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. (ASTMH), 64th Annual
Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, USA). However, it is unclear how two
highly divergent alleles, at a number of different loci, survived
the genetic bottleneck at the origin of P. falciparum. Sporozoites,
which are injected into the human host by the mosquito, are hap-
loid. Transmission from gorilla to human of two dimorphic alleles
could occur in a single event, if heterozygous oocytes in the mos-
quito generated two types of sporozoites present in the same
inoculum. However, the transmission of divergent alleles of multi-
ple
genes
would
require
that
oocytes
were
simultaneously
heterozygous at all loci that are now dimorphic in P. falciparum.
Alternatively, backcrossing of human parasites to gorilla parasites,
in the immediate aftermath of the initial cross-species transmis-
sion event, but before they became isolated, could lead to the
transfer of additional alleles to humans. Regardless of the mecha-
nism, however, any proposed scenario involving the transfer of
multiple alleles at multiple msp loci must at the same time explain
the paucity of genetic variation seen elsewhere in the genome
(Sundararaman et al., 2016). It would require there to have been
very strong selection retaining both dimorphic alleles at the vari-
ous loci, in the face of extreme random genetic drift (perhaps
due to a very small number of initial human hosts) affecting all
other loci. Characterisation of the extent of allelic dimorphism
across other Laverania spp., together with the corresponding host
immune responses, may shed more light on this puzzle.
7. A sylvatic reservoir of P. vivax
Although early studies of ape blood and faecal samples indi-
cated that chimpanzees and gorillas harbour P. vivax-like parasites,
the number of sequences recovered was too limited to draw defini-
tive conclusions (Kaiser et al., 2010; Krief et al., 2010; Liu et al.,
2010a; Prugnolle et al., 2013). As for Laverania parasites, elucida-
tion of the molecular epidemiology of P. vivax in apes required a
comprehensive analysis of wild-living populations across central
Africa (Liu et al., 2014). Table 1 and Fig. 2B summarise available
data from 97 field sites, showing that P. vivax is relatively common
amongst central and eastern chimpanzees as well as western low-
land gorillas, which together represent a considerable sylvatic P.
vivax reservoir (Kaiser et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010a, 2014; De
Nys et al., 2013). However, amplification of P. vivax DNA sequences
from faecal samples was considerably less efficient than from
blood samples, most likely reflecting much lower parasite loads
in faecal samples compared with blood (Liu et al., 2014). Thus,
the observed faeces-based infection rates, which ranged from 4%
to 8% for the various ape species and subspecies (Table 1), are
expected to greatly underestimate the actual prevalence rates, per-
haps by as much as an order of magnitude. The low sensitivity of
faecal parasite detection may also explain why P. vivax has not
yet been detected in wild-living Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees,
Cross River gorillas or bonobos. Indeed, P. vivax-like sequences
were
readily
amplified
from
the
blood
of
captive
Nigeria-
Cameroon chimpanzees, indicating that this subspecies is suscepti-
ble to P. vivax infection (Fig. 4).
Phylogenetic analyses of SGA-derived sequences showed that
ape and human P. vivax were very closely related. However,
chimpanzee-
and
gorilla-derived
parasites
exhibited
greater
genetic diversity than even the most geographically diverse human
P. vivax strains. In phylogenetic trees of mt (Fig. 4A), nuclear
(Fig. 4B), and apicoplast (Fig. 4C) sequences, human P. vivax
sequences formed a single lineage within the radiation of the ape
parasites. In contrast, parasite sequences derived from chimpanzee
and gorilla samples were interspersed, suggesting that P. vivax cir-
culates freely between these two ape species. Of note, analysis of
nearly 1,000 bushmeat samples failed to identify related sequences
in samples from any of 16 different monkey species, strongly sug-
gesting that P. vivax is restricted to African apes (Liu et al., 2014).
8. African origin of human P. vivax
Until recently, the closest known relative of P. vivax was a para-
site, Plasmodium cynomolgi, which infects macaques in Asia
(Tachibana et al., 2012). In phylogenetic trees, P. vivax and P. cyno-
molgi fall within a clade of parasites that includes at least eight other
Plasmodium spp. infecting southeast Asian primates (Fig. 1). The con-
sensus view has thus been that P. vivax emerged in southeastern Asia
following the cross-species transmission of a macaque parasite
(Escalante et al., 2005; Jongwutiwes et al., 2005; Mu et al., 2005;
Neafsey et al., 2012). However, this hypothesis has always been at
odds with two other observations. First, the high prevalence of the
Duffy-negative phenotype in sub-Saharan Africans, which sug-
gested that this mutation arose in response to prolonged selection
pressure from P. vivax (Carter, 2003) rather than another unidenti-
fied pathogen (Livingstone, 1984). Second, modern humans did
not arrive in Asia until approximately 60,000 years ago (Mellars,
2006); yet, P. vivax has likely diverged from macaque parasites much
earlier than this (Escalante et al., 2005; Jongwutiwes et al., 2005; Mu
et al., 2005; Neafsey et al., 2012). Thus, P. vivax would have had a
rather convoluted history, requiring transmission from macaques
to an earlier hominin such as Homo erectus, followed by its diversifi-
cation in that host before numerous lineages were transmitted to
modern humans after they emerged from Africa. The discovery of
P. vivax in large numbers of chimpanzees and gorillas now resolves
these inconsistencies, providing compelling evidence for an African,
rather than an Asian, origin of human P. vivax.
The phylogenetic relationships of organelle as well as nuclear
gene sequences indicate that all extant human P. vivax strains form
a monophyletic clade within the radiation of ape parasites (Fig. 4).
This could be interpreted to mean that P. vivax originated in humans
following a single transmission event. However, the lack of host
specificity of ape P. vivax in natural settings (Liu et al., 2014),
together with the finding of a human infection with ape P. vivax
(Prugnolle et al., 2013), argues against this theory. Instead, it is much
more likely that extant human P. vivax represents a lineage that sur-
vived after spreading out of Africa. This scenario explains the
reduced diversity of the human parasites as resulting from an out-
of-Africa bottleneck, as seen in P. falciparum (Conway et al., 2000;
Tanabe et al., 2010) and in humans themselves (Ramachandran
et al., 2005). Human P. vivax strains that are currently found in
Madagascar and parts of Africa are likely the result of a reintroduc-
tion of this parasite from Asia (Culleton and Carter, 2012).
Whilst it could be argued that the ape P. vivax was brought to
Africa by humans who migrated from Asia (Prugnolle et al.,
2013), this hypothesis has been refuted by sequences indicating
the existence of a related, but distinct, Plasmodium sp. that also
infects African apes. This Plasmodium sp. which is apparent in trees
of mt, nuclear and apicoplast sequences (Fig. 4), has been found in
chimpanzees from two different locations in Cameroon (the BQ
and DG field sites in Fig. 2) and represents the closest known
relative of P. vivax. The most parsimonious interpretation of this
finding is that the common ancestor of these two species was in

 Africa, indicating that the lineage existed there for a long time
before P. vivax arose as a distinct species (Fig. 4). We propose
to designate this newly described species Plasmodium carteri, in
honour of Richard Carter, who has long championed the hypothesis
that P. vivax originated in Africa (Carter, 2003; Culleton and Carter,
2012).

 9. Mosquito vectors of ape Plasmodium spp.
Identifying the mosquito vectors that transmit ape Plasmodium
parasites is critical for understanding their host specificity and
zoonotic potential. Initial studies of whole mosquito DNA identi-
fied P. praefalciparum in Anopheles moucheti, whilst ape P. vivax
was found in both A. moucheti and Anopheles vinckei, although
these mosquitoes were analysed with molecular tools that were
unsuitable to differentiate between parasite stages (Paupy et al.,
2013; Prugnolle et al., 2013). A subsequent study screened dis-
sected salivary glands for parasites, and demonstrated that A.
vinckei, A. moucheti and Anopheles marshallii are transmitting vec-
tors of ape Plasmodium species (Makanga et al., 2016). Anopheles
vinckei was found to be most frequently infected, harbouring P.
vivax-like, P. malariae-like, and Laverania spp., and carried gorilla
as well as chimpanzee parasites (Makanga et al., 2016). Moreover,
human landing catches showed that all three Anopheles spp. had
the propensity to bite humans, indicating that they could serve
as bridge vectors for human infection (Makanga et al., 2016).
Although these three Anopheles spp. may not represent the entirety
of vectors capable of transmitting ape Plasmodium parasites, it
seems clear that the strict host specificity of Laverania spp. in
wild-living ape populations cannot be explained by mosquitoes
that exclusively feed on chimpanzees or gorillas. It is likely that
P. praefalciparum was first transmitted to humans by one of these
sylvatic vectors, but the subsequent dispersal of the newly created
P. falciparum required adaptation to Anopheles gambiae, which is
the main human transmission vector (Molina-Cruz and Barillas-
Mury, 2016). It will thus be important to determine to what extent
ape Laverania parasites can productively infect Anopheles spp. that
are more domesticated (Molina-Cruz and Barillas-Mury, 2016).
10. Zoonotic potential of ape parasites
Despite the identification of suitable bridge vectors, both exper-
imental transmission and molecular epidemiological studies indi-
cate that ape Laverania parasites do not normally cause blood
stage infections in humans. Attempts to inoculate humans with a
parasite identified as ‘‘P. reichenowi” over 100 years ago did not
result in parasitemia (Blacklock and Adler, 1922). More impor-
tantly, two recent field studies conducted in rural Cameroon and
Gabon failed to identify ape Laverania parasites in the blood of
humans living in close proximity to infected chimpanzees and
gorillas (Sundararaman et al., 2013; Delicat-Loembet et al., 2015).
In contrast, ape P. vivax has been shown to cause clinical malaria
in Duffy-positive humans, as exemplified by the case of a Cau-
casian male who acquired this infection after working for 18 days
in a forest in the Central African Republic (Fig. 2B). Parasite
sequences amplified from this individual’s blood did not fall within
the human P. vivax lineage, but instead clustered with parasites
obtained from wild-living chimpanzees and gorillas (Fig. 4A), con-
firming acquisition by cross-species transmission from a wild ape
(Prugnolle et al., 2013). Similarly, ‘‘P. schwetzi” was experimentally
transmitted from apes to humans and must have represented ape
P. vivax in at least some cases, since only Caucasians, but not
African-Americans, became blood-stage infected, likely because
the latter were Duffy-negative (Contacos et al., 1970). Together,
these data indicate that ape Laverania parasites do not switch
between host species, except under highly unusual circumstances,
whilst ape P. vivax is much less host-specific and has the potential
to infect Duffy-positive humans, suggesting that human and ape
P.
vivax
parasites
represent
a
single
species.
Although
P. praefalciparum apparently crossed the species barrier to humans
only once, it will be important to elucidate the host, vector and/or
ecological barriers that have prevented additional ape Laverania
transmissions. Since ape P. vivax is substantially more diverse than
human P. vivax, it will be important to determine whether ape par-
asites are biologically more versatile. Moreover, emergence of ape
P. vivax should be monitored in areas of Africa where an influx of
Duffy-positive humans through commerce and travel coincides
with forest encroachment and ape habitat destruction.
11. Natural history of ape Plasmodium infections
Although P. falciparum and P. vivax are highly pathogenic in
humans, the disease causing potential of their ape relatives
remains largely unknown. Given the high prevalence (Table 1)
and wide distribution of both Laverania and P. vivax infections
amongst chimpanzees and gorillas (Fig. 2), it is highly unlikely that
they cause severe disease and malaria-related deaths in many ani-
mals. However, studies of habituated chimpanzees in the Tai
National Forest in Cote d’Ivoire revealed higher faecal parasite bur-
dens in both young (De Nys et al., 2013) and pregnant (De Nys
et al., 2014) animals, similar to what has been described in humans
in malaria endemic regions. Moreover, a recent report of an ini-
tially Plasmodium naive chimpanzee, who was introduced into a
sanctuary where ape Laverania infections were endemic, showed
that P. reichenowi can cause high parasitemia associated with fever
and anaemia (Herbert et al., 2015). In contrast, other captive chim-
panzees in African sanctuaries that tested positive for Laverania or
P. vivax sequences in their blood or faecal samples, were asymp-
tomatic
and
blood
smear
negative
(Herbert
et
al.,
2015;
Sundararaman et al., 2016). Thus, it seems clear that Plasmodium
infections can be pathogenic in apes; however, like humans, apes
seem to develop resistance to life threatening malaria in areas of
intense parasite transmission.
12. Conclusions and perspectives
Although ape Plasmodium parasites were first identified nearly
100 years ago, it is only very recently that the complexities of their
evolutionary relationships, geographic distribution, prevalence
rates, and mammalian host and vector associations have been elu-
cidated. Whilst the evolutionary origins of human P. falciparum and
P. vivax have now been clarified, nothing is known about the mech-
anistic processes that led to their emergence; yet, such information
is critical to understanding how ape parasites crossed the species
barrier and whether such events are likely to occur again. The lack
of in vitro culture systems poses a significant challenge to the func-
tional analysis of ape Plasmodium parasites, but whole genome
sequencing, even from suboptimal specimens such as subpatently
infected unprocessed blood, represents a critical first step towards
understanding their biology (Otto et al., 2014; Sundararaman et al.,
2016). Such analyses have already revealed a number of unex-
pected findings such as horizontal transfer of invasion genes
amongst ape Laverania parasite species (Sundararaman et al.,
2016). The genome sequences of additional parasites, in particular
P. praefalciparum and ape P. vivax, will provide templates for mech-
anistic studies and in vitro genome manipulations to compare the
function of key proteins amongst the various ape and human Plas-
modium spp. Population genomic studies of ape Laverania parasites
may also inform ongoing malaria vaccine development efforts by
identifying antigens that are under strong immune selection pres-
sure in apes as well as humans (Ochola et al., 2010; Amambua-
Ngwa et al., 2012; Tetteh et al., 2013). In this context, it will be
important to further characterise the transmitting vectors of ape
Plasmodium parasites and assess to what extent humans are
exposed to these parasites through the bites of infected mosqui-
toes. A careful analysis of antibody responses to preerythrocytic
parasite stages could address this question. Finally, P. ovale- and
D.E. Loy et al. / International Journal for Parasitology 47 (2017) 87–97

 P. malariae-like sequences have been detected in African great apes
(Duval et al., 2010; Kaiser et al., 2010; Krief et al., 2010; Liu et al.,
2010a; Boundenga et al., 2015), and additional work is required to
ascertain the relationship of these parasites to their human coun-
terparts. In general, knowledge gained from comparative popula-
tion and genomic studies of ape parasites will provide new
insight into the biology and pathogenesis of human P. falciparum
and P. vivax, and will inform malaria eradication efforts by identi-
fying potential zoonotic threats.
