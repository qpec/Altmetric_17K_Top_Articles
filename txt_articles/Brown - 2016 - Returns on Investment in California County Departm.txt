 Returns on Investment in California County
Departments of Public Health
Timothy T. Brown, PhD
Objectives. To estimate the average return on investment for the overall activities of
county departments of public health in California.
Methods. I gathered the elements necessary to estimate the average return on in-
vestment for county departments of public health in California during the period 2001 to
2008–2009. These came from peer-reviewed journal articles published as part of a larger
projecttodevelopamethodfordeterminingreturnoninvestmentforpublichealthbyusing
a health economics framework. I combined these elements by using the standard formula
for computing return on investment, and performed a sensitivity analysis.Then I compared
the return on investment for county departments of public health with the returns on
investment generated for various aspects of medical care.
Results. The estimated return on investment from $1 invested in county departments
of public health in California ranges from $67.07 to $88.21.
Conclusions. The very large estimated return on investment for California county
departments of public health relative to the return on investment for selected aspects of
medical care suggests that public health is a wise investment. (Am J Public Health. 2016;

s the public health system a good in-
vestment? Information about the return
on investment for public health systems is
an essential input to sound health policy
decision-making, but has been difficult to
ascertain. Determining the return on in-
vestment for the public health system as
a whole—at least from the point of view
of county departments of public health—
requires 4 types of information: (1) a complete
set of health outcomes that can be causally
attributed to the expenditures of county
departments of public health, (2) the time
paths of these expenditures and outcomes, (3)
the level of expenditures used to produce the
outcomes, and (4) monetary valuations of
each outcome. With this information, one
could determine the discounted present value
of both public health outcomes and the level
of expenditures used to produce them, the
components of return on investment for the
public health system.
Each of these 4 types of information is
now available via a series of research articles
appearing in health economics journals and
health services journals, which make it
possible for the first time to estimatethe return
on investment for the public health system in
California.1–3 This series of research articles
was generated as part of a larger project to
develop a method for determining return on
investment for public health by using a health
economics framework. In this study, I draw
together each of the 4 types of information
necessary to estimate return on investment,
briefly explain the manner in which each of
the 4 types of information was determined,
and then combine these to estimate return on
investment.
METHODS
In this article, I define the “public health
system” as the collection of all county
departments of public health in California.
County departments of public health in
California are funded from multiple sources.
Intergovernmental transfers from state and
federal governments and taxation are the
primary sources of funds, and user fees and
other sources of funding make up the
remainder.1
Information Types
Two recent studies have determined the
causal effects of county public health ex-
penditures in California on both general
health status and mortality, including their
time paths, which together make up a com-
plete set of overall health outcomes.1,2 In-
formation not only on the health outcomes
that resulted from county public health ex-
penditures, but also on their time paths is
important because improving population
health takes time. Public health activities that
occur in a given year will not only improve
population health in that same year, but
will also improve population health for
many years into the future. Public health
activities are designed to improve general
health status in the short term and it is likely
that it is this improved general health status
that reduces mortality rates over the long
term. Thus, it is necessary to account for the
entire stream of health outcomes to properly
estimate return on investment.
The first of the 2 studies mentioned in the
previous paragraph examined the effect of
changes in per capita public health expen-
ditures on county-level general health status
(percentage of the county population with
health status that is good, very good, or

 excellent).1 The analysis was based on
county-level panel data in 40 counties cov-
ering the period 2001 to 2009 and included
information on general health status, per
capita public health expenditures, lagged
per capita income, the lagged age structure
of the population, the lagged educational
structure of the population, the lagged racial/
ethnic structure of the population, and the
lagged proportions of the population covered
by health insurance including Medicaid and
related programs, Medicare, and private
health insurance. These 40 counties represent
96% of the California population.
The relationship between per capita public
health expenditures and general health status
was estimated with a statistical technique
designed to determine how long it takes for
the full effect of public health services and
programs on general health status to play out.
This approach, known as the Koyck dis-
tributed lag model, showed that it takes ap-
proximately 4 years for the effect of public
health activities on general health status to
play out.4
This estimated relationship between per
capita public health expenditures and general
health status was designed to be interpreted as
causal. This causal interpretation is made
possible by the useof theinstrumental variable
technique that is combined with the Koyck
distributed lag model. The instrumental
variable technique is a standard approach for
determining causal effects in empirical health
economics and corrects for the effects of
measurement error (random errors in the
data), omitted variable bias (the omission of
relevant variables associated with both health
outcomes and per capita public health ex-
penditures), and reverse causation (changes
in per capita public health expenditures that
may be attributable to changes in health
outcomes).4 The particular instrumental
variables approach used in this study in-
corporated state-of-the-art techniques that
are commonly employed in the recent
peer-reviewed literature across academic
disciplines.5–18
The major finding of that study is that, at
current funding levels, each annual public
health expenditure cycle causally results in
more than 207 000 individuals being in the
“good, very good, or excellent” categories of
health status rather than the “poor or fair”
categories of health status.
The extent to which public health funding
has an impact on mortality over the long term
was the subject of the second study.2 The
second study used parallel methodology to
the first study, but examined the effect of
changes in per capita public health expen-
ditures on county-level all-cause mortality.
The analysis was based on county-level panel
data for 56 counties covering the period
2001 to 2008 and included information on
all-cause mortality, lagged per capita public
health expenditures, the lagged age structure
of the population, a lagged proxy for the
educational structure of the population,
lagged population density, the lagged un-
employment rate, the lagged crime rate, the
lagged racial/ethnic structure of the pop-
ulation, and the lagged proportions of the
population covered by health insurance in-
cluding Medicaid and related programs,
Medicare, and private health insurance. These
56 counties represent approximately 98%
of the California population.
The major finding of this second study is
that, at current funding levels, each annual
public health expenditure cycle results in
approximately 27 000 lives being saved, with
this effect playing out over approximately
a decade. The results of these 2 studies thus
show that each year of public health activities
in California first improves general health
status and then decreases mortality with
positive health effects still being seen ap-
proximately a decade later.
The cost of this increase in health status and
decrease in mortality is simply the total ex-
penditures of county departments of public
health in California during a given year. The
levels of total expenditures are available in
the second study.2
Determining return on investment re-
quires placing a monetary valuation on
avoided deaths. County departments of
public health save lives by reducing the sta-
tistical mortality risk in the populations that
they serve. Thus, the appropriate valuation in
this context is the number of lives that are
saved as a result of reductions in mortality risk:
statistical lives. A statistical life is different from
any specific person’s life primarily in the sense
that county departments of public health
generally do not know the specific identities
of the people who do not die as a result of
public health activities. Nevertheless, the
number of lives saved because of public health
activities can be estimated.
Placing a monetary value on a particular
good or service is usually done by de-
termining its market value. However, there
is no market for human life. Yet, there is
a market that is linked to mortality: the labor
market in which there is occupational vari-
ation in both the market wage and the risk of
mortality. By using this information, it is
possible to estimate statistically the implicit
average trade-off that individuals make be-
tween levels of mortality risk and wage
levels.19 A large literature attests to the validity
of this approach and it is the method used
by the US federal government to determine
the value of a statistical life for purposes of
evaluating the costs and benefits of regula-
tion.19–21 For example, the US Environmental
Protection Agency recommends a value for
a statistical life of $9.6 million in 2010 dollars,
and the US Department of Transportation
recommends a valuefor a statistical lifeof $8.86
million in 2010 dollars.22,23 We adopt these
standard valuations to value the statistical lives
saved bythe activities ofcountydepartments of
public health.
The final valuation needed is the mon-
etary value of improved general health
status. Like human life, there is no market for
general health status. However, in contrast
to the value of a statistical life, which is based
on the well-understood relationship be-
tween occupational wages and the risk of
mortality, the relationship between occu-
pational wages and general health status is
not well understood, suggesting that an al-
ternative approach to valuing general health
status is necessary.
One such alternative approach is the
subjective well-being valuation method.
The subjective well-being valuation method
has been applied broadly to value numerous
things for which no market exists such as air
pollution, climate, floods, droughts, and
noise, as well as the proximity to waste
facilities, coastlines, and transportation
routes.24–31 The subjective well-being val-
uation method has also been used to de-
termine the value of cardiovascular disease,
migraine headaches, various chronic ill-
nesses, mental health, chronic pain, and
general health status.3,32–36 This last valua-
tion, the valuation of general health status, is
most relevant to this study.

 Applying the subjective well-being valua-
tion method to value general health status
involves estimating a happiness equation that is
a function of gender, age, race, marital status,
education, year, season, general health status,
and family income adjusted for family size. A
reduction in general health status reduces
happiness and an increase in family income
increaseshappiness.Adecreaseingeneralhealth
status that reduces happiness is statistically
valued by the amount of family income it
wouldtaketocompletelyreversethisreduction
in happiness so that happiness is the same as
it was before the decrease in general health
status occurred. To correct bias attributable
to potential measurement error, omitted
variables, and reverse causation, the in-
strumental variable approach, which produces
consistent valuations of general health status,
was used. The implications of this study are that
moving from poor or fair health to good or
excellent health (a single year of improved
health status) can be valued at $41 654 (2010
constant dollars), other things equal.3
Return on Investment
The return-on-investment analysis takes
the point of view of county departments of
public health, departments that are focused
on 2 things: their own expenditures and
the value of changes in mortality and health
status that are produced as a result of their
activities. However, we must first make some
adjustments to the information presented
previously. Because estimates of the number
of individuals whose general health status
wasimprovedorwhoselifewassavedasaresult
of publichealthactivities was based onlessthan
the full number of California counties,
these estimates must be slightly scaled up to
account for the full improvement in pop-
ulation health in California. We must similarly
slightly scale up total expenditures of county
departments of public health in California.
To compute return on investment, I used
the following formula, (Equation 1), where
return on investment is equal to
where PV is present value. Note, although it
may be the case that improvements in general
health status are long-lasting, to be
conservative we assume that improvements in
general health status only last 1 year because
we have no information on the age distri-
bution of the individuals whose general health
status is improved.
Return on investment is calculated by
using a 3% real discount rate with sensitivity
analysis performed using 0%, 5%, and 7%
real discount rates. The use of each of these
discount rates is recommended by the US
Public Health Service.37 Real discount rates
represent the inflation-adjusted rate of return
that could be obtained if public health ex-
penditures were invested in alternative in-
vestments. All dollars are inflation-adjusted
and expressed as 2010 constant dollars. Note
that the return on investment will be the same
regardless of the year to which dollars are
standardized. A set of spreadsheets that in-
cludes the complete details of the analysis is
available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org.
On the basis of the studies discussed
previously, improvement in general health
status attributable to a single year of public
health expenditures is modeled to occur
over a 4-year period, and avoided deaths
attributable to a single year of public health
expenditures are modeled to occur over
a 10-year period. The present value of
avoided deaths comes from combining
the value of a statistical life used by either
the Environmental Protection Agency
or the Department of Transportation with
the parameter values measuring the
causal links between avoided mortality
and public health expenditures. The pres-
ent value of improved health status comes
from combining the standard valuation
of improved health status with the pa-
rameter values measuring the causal links
between the percentage of the population
that has improved health status and
public health expenditures. The
present value of expenditures for county
departments of public health is calculated
on the basis of data from the study on
county public health expenditures and
avoided mortality.2 I performed sensitivity
analysis with 2 alternative values of
a statistical life.
RESULTS
The overall pattern of human benefit
from the activities of California county de-
partments of public health begins with the
growth in the number of individuals whose
general health status improves by moving
from poor or fair health to good, very good,
or excellent health. Most of the impact of
public health activities on general health status
is felt in the same year that the public
health activities are performed, resulting in an
estimated 190 388 individuals with improved
health. Impacts of base-year public health
activities are also felt in future years, but are
much smaller, with an estimated additional
22 847 people experiencing improved health
in the following year, and an estimated ad-
ditional 2742 and 329 people experiencing
improved health in the third and fourth years,
improving health for an estimated 216 306
people overall from a single year of county
public health activities. These figures have
been scaled up from 40 counties to account
for all 58 counties.
Figure 1 presents the estimated pattern of
lives saved from the same base year of public
health activities that resulted in the pattern
described previously. The initial impact on
general health status in the base year is
followed by an estimated 8863 and 6293
avoided deaths in the following 2 years
(cumulative annual figures are shown in
Figure 1). This diminishing reduction in
mortality plays out for approximately a de-
cade, with the number of additional lives
saved slowly decreasing each year, for an
estimated 29 567 total statistical lives being
saved over a 10-year period. These figures
have been scaled up from 56 counties to
account for all 58 counties.
The total public health spending that
produced this improved general health status
and lives saved is $3.28 billion (when we scale
up the original analysis to account for all
58 county departments of public health)
measured in 2010 dollars as presented in
Table 1. The total value of the improved
general health status ranges from $8.93
billion to $9.01 billion, depending on the
discount rate used. As noted previously,
I used 2 values of a statistical life, one from
the Environmental Protection Agency
($9.6 million) and one from the Department
of Transportation ($8.86 million), such that

DISCUSSION
In this study, I estimated the return on
investment for overall expenditures in county
departments of public health in California
by using recent causal estimates of the impact
of public health expenditures on mortality
and general health status in California,
a standard set of valuations of a statistical life
used by the federal government, and a new
standardized valuation of general health sta-
tus.1–3 The return on investment from $1
invested in county departments of public
health is estimated to range from $67.07 to
$88.21 when one uses a range of real discount
rates recommended by the US Public
Health Service. Although the period analyzed
in this data set was bracketed by national
recessions, one ending in November 2001
and one beginning in December 2007,
the time period used in this analysis is un-
fortunately not suitable to answer the im-
portant question of whether the effects found
in this study would be modified by an eco-
nomic recession.38
This study is not without limitations. This
study focused on county departments of
public health and only includes the contri-
butions of state and federal health agencies
to the extent that county public health
funding comes from state and federal health
agencies. Other important contributions of
state and federal health agencies to health
outcomes are not included. In addition,
the causal estimates of the links between
county-level public health expenditures and
both mortality and general health status, al-
though they are state-of-the-art, may be
sensitive to the particular years for which data
were available. Also, the estimated time
over which mortality is prevented, which is
based on the econometric model estimated,
extends slightly past the years for which
data were actually available.2 This estimated
number of time periods may also be sensitive
to the particular years for which data were
actually available.
Another potential limitation is that the
causal estimates of the links between
county-level public health expenditures
and both mortality and general health status
were generated from analyses performed
on finite samples.1,2 To account for this, I
applied finite sample size adjustments to
the robust variance–covariance matrix in
each analysis, kept the number of in-
strumental variables used in each analysis
purposefully small, and removed weak
instrumental variables.1,2 However, it is
possible that some finite sample bias may
still be present.

 The estimate of the value of general health
status is based on a time period far wider
than the data used in the other studies, which
may have an impact on the valuation of
general health status.3 The value of general
health status is also generated at the level
of the entire United States and may be
somewhat different than if generated for
California alone.3
Finally, although this study emphasizes
the return on investment of public health
activities as a whole, it does not address im-
portant issues such as what the most cost-
effective bundle of public health services
may be. Important efforts are currently
underway to determine the costs of foun-
dational public health services as are efforts to
collect county-level health outcomes in-
formation, which will assist in addressing
this important issue.39,40
The estimated range of return on in-
vestment found in this study compares fa-
vorably to investments in medical care.
Estimates of the return on investment from
Medicare’s investment in 4 major health
conditions (heart attacks, type 2 diabetes,
stroke, and breast cancer) range from $1.10
to $4.80.41 The return on investment from
innovation in medical care, based on an
evaluation of 23 studies, ranges from
$1.12 to $38.00.41
Given the high return on investment
for public health, and what we know to be
low levels of public health funding
relative to medical care funding, an in-
crease in public health funding would be
a valuable investment.42 Although mar-
ginal returns on investment in public
health are likely to diminish with con-
tinued investment in public health, it may
be the case that a great deal of investment
can occur before the return on investment
for public health even approaches the
return on investment for medical care.
Public health is an excellent investment
opportunity and great improvements in
health are likely if these investments
occur.
Public health activities are fundamen-
tally about preventing poor health out-
comes that develop over long periods of
time. Success in public health is thus
measured in terms of the number of poor
health outcomes that did not happen as
a result of public health interventions. Thus,
only by using rigorous research methods can
we know whether public health activities
are achieving their goals. Investment in such
research must go hand in hand with in-
vestment in public health activities to ob-
tain the long-term improvements in
population health that we all
work toward.
