 BRIEF COMMUNICATION
Aspartame intake is associated with greater glucose intolerance
in individuals with obesity
Jennifer L. Kuk and Ruth E. Brown
Abstract: This study examined whether sucrose, fructose, aspartame, and saccharin influences the association between obesity
and glucose tolerance in 2856 adults from the NHANES III survey. Aspartame intake significantly influenced the association
between body mass index (BMI) and glucose tolerance (interaction: P = 0.004), wherein only those reporting aspartame intake
had a steeper positive association between BMI and glucose tolerance than those reporting no aspartame intake. Therefore,
consumption of aspartame is associated with greater obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance.
Key words: body mass index, epidemiology, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized
by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance leading to hypergly-
cemia (Kerner and Bruckel 2014). Obesity has been strongly linked
with type 2 diabetes, and nearly 90% of individuals with diabetes
have overweight or obesity (Saydah et al. 2014). Sugar consump-
tion is one of the common suspected culprits for the rise in obesity
and may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (Hu and
Malik 2010). Consequently, artificial sweeteners are commonly
consumed by individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes as they
are thought to lower the caloric content and blood glucose re-
sponse. However, in animal models, use of artificial sweeteners
may also increase weight gain over time (Swithers et al. 2013), and
may promote glucose intolerance through the altered function
and composition of intestinal microbiota (Suez et al. 2014). In
humans, there is very little evidence that artificial sweeteners
promote glucose intolerance and there are only a few long-term
studies on the use of sweeteners and weight change, and studies
that report metabolic differences with intervention do not adjust
for concurrent changes in body weight (Wiebe et al. 2011). Further,
there is no report on whether natural sugars or artificial sweeten-
ers have an effect on diabetes risk independent of obesity.
Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether natural
sugars and artificial sweetener consumption modifies the associ-
ation between glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, fasting glu-
cose, and body mass index (BMI).
Materials and methods
Participants
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) is a nationally representative cross-sectional sur-
vey conducted in the United States between 1988 and 1994 in
33 994 persons, aged 2 months and older. Participants were ex-
amined at home and at a mobile exam center for various markers
of health, including demographics, medical history, dietary prac-
tices, blood profile, and anthropometrics (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) 1994, 1996a). Participants gave informed written consent,
and the study protocol was approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics.
Secondary analyses conducted for this study utilized 2856 adults
with complete data for oral glucose tolerance, weight, height,
and diet, and who were not taking medications for diabetes.
Age, sex, education, ethnicity (White or non-White), and smok-
ing status (never, current, and former) were self-reported by
questionnaire. BMI was calculated using measured height and
weight.
Metabolic measures
The oral glucose tolerance test was conducted at the mobile
examination centre and was limited to a subset of individuals
aged 40–74 years old without previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes
and who were not taking insulin. Participants fasted overnight
(>8 h) and blood was drawn from the antecubital vein by a trained
phlebotomist according to a standardized protocol. Participants
received a 75-g glucose-equivalent oral glucose challenge and a
second blood sample was drawn 2 h later. Fasting and 2-h plasma
glucose levels were measured by a hexokinase enzymatic refer-
ence method (Roche Cobas Mira, Indianapolis, Ind., USA). Homeo-
static model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was
calculated by dividing the product of fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)
and insulin (mU/L) by 22.5.

 Dietary intake
At the mobile examination centre, 2 dietary interviewers ad-
ministered the dietary questionnaire and recorded the types and
amounts of all foods and beverages consumed by the participant
in the last 24 h. Data on specific sugar (sucrose and fructose) and
artificial sweetener (aspartame and saccharin) intake were avail-
able from The Total Nutrient Intake File (CDC, NCHS 1996b). Indi-
viduals were classified as consumers or nonconsumers of artificial
sweeteners (yes or no) and by high and low natural sugar intake
(top 80% vs. bottom 20%).
Statistical analysis
Participant characteristics are presented as mean (SE) or fre-
quencies. Differences in the relationship between glucose toler-
ance, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance (outcomes) with BMI
(continuous correlate) by sugar/sweetener intake (categorical) were
assessed using element-wise regression (proc surveyreg, which uses
generalized least-squares estimation) with examination of BMI by
sugar/sweetener interaction and main effects with adjustment for
potential confounders (age-, sex-, smoking status-, education-, and
ethnicity-fixed effects). All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, N.C., USA) survey procedures weighted to
be representative of the United States population. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at � < 0.05.
Results
Individuals consuming artificial sweeteners (aspartame or sac-
charin) had a subtly higher BMI (28 vs. 27 kg/m2), and were more
likely to be female (Table 1, P < 0.05). Those consuming high
sucrose, high fructose, and no aspartame were significantly younger,
while those consuming saccharin were significantly older than
those who did not (P < 0.05). There were no differences in glucose
tolerance, HOMA-IR, or fasting plasma glucose between those con-
suming high sugars or artificial sweeteners and those who did not.
The interaction and main effects of BMI and sugars and sweet-
eners are presented in Fig. 1. Sucrose and fructose intake were not
significantly related to glucose tolerance, HOMA-IR, or fasting glu-
cose independent of BMI (P > 0.10). There was a significant aspar-
tame by BMI interaction effect (P = 0.004), wherein the slope of the
association between BMI and glucose tolerance was steeper in
those reporting aspartame intake (Fig. 1). Similar observations
were seen between aspartame, BMI, and fasting glucose (not
shown). Saccharin intake did not alter the association between
BMI and glucose tolerance, fasting glucose, or HOMA-IR (P > 0.10).
Discussion
The results of the current study illustrate that aspartame con-
sumption is associated with augmented obesity-related deteriora-
tions in glucose tolerance and fasting glucose. Thus, more research
is needed to better understand the weight-management benefits
of artificial sweetener consumption over natural sugars against
the potential increased diabetes risk, particularly for those with
obesity.
Because of the potential health dangers and weight implica-
tions of natural sugars, use of low-calorie sweeteners has grown in
popularity (Sylvetsky et al. 2012), and many newer artificial sweet-
eners are now consumed beyond those examined here (Mayo
Clinic 2016). Use of low-calorie sweetener substitutes are reported
to be associated with clear reductions in caloric intake and mod-
est reductions in body weight (Miller and Perez 2014). However,
there is surprisingly little research showing a long-term health
benefit of low-caloric sweeteners (Wiebe et al. 2011; Miller and
Perez 2014), particularly when changes in body weight are consid-
ered (Wiebe et al. 2011). This study provides evidence that con-
sumption of aspartame may be associated with greater diabetes
risk in individuals with higher adiposity. Aspartame is reported to
be associated with changes in gut microbiota that are associated
with impairments in insulin resistance in lean (Suez et al. 2014)
and obese rodents (Palmnäs et al. 2014). We observe that aspar-
tame was related to significantly greater impairments in glucose
tolerance for individuals with obesity, but not lean individuals. In
fact, our results suggest a beneficial effect of aspartame in lean
individuals. However, as there are very few lean individuals in the
population who reported consuming aspartame, this requires fur-
ther investigation.
From mice models, there is also evidence that saccharin con-
sumption induces changes in intestinal microbiota that result in
the development of glucose intolerance (Suez et al. 2014). In the
current study, there was a nonsignificant higher (0.45 mmol/L) 2-h
glucose in those who consumed saccharin versus those who did
not. However, this difference may be clinically relevant as individ-
uals with obesity who consumed saccharin had a mean impaired
glucose tolerance versus a normal glucose tolerance for those
with obesity who did not consume saccharin, suggesting that we
may have been underpowered for this analysis. Suez et al. (2014)
demonstrate that 7 days of saccharin consumption is associated
with impairments in glucose tolerance in lean individuals who do
not habitually consume noncaloric sweeteners. Thus, there is ev-
idence from both rodent and human research suggesting that
saccharin may be associated with deleterious health effects.

 In general, the evidence suggesting a metabolic effect of artifi-
cial sweeteners in humans is controversial (Wiebe et al. 2011;
Swithers et al. 2013). Epidemiological evidence suggests that diet
soda consumption is associated with a higher risk for developing
type 2 diabetes, though this observation is not consistently ob-
served (Hu and Malik 2010). Further, it is unclear if the increased
diabetes risk associated with diet soda consumption remains in-
dependent of differences in adiposity (O’
Connor et al. 2015). Inter-
estingly, a meta-analysis suggesting minimal health effects of
sweeteners also report that most examinations have been in
nonobese populations (Wiebe et al. 2011). Together, these results
may indicate that certain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame
have negative effects on glucose tolerance in individuals with
obesity who are at the greatest risk for developing type 2 diabetes.
Consumption of sucrose is suspected to be a culprit in the rise in
obesity prevalence (Hu and Malik 2010). Chronic consumption of
high-sugar diets are associated with increased inflammation, glu-
cose intolerance, and greater weight gain in rats (Sweazea et al.
2010). In humans, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are
associated with higher caloric intake, greater obesity, and greater
risk for type 2 diabetes (Hu and Malik 2010). However, many re-
ports demonstrating a negative effect of sugar intake on diabetes
risk are confounded by the effects of obesity and greater weight
gain. Further, some suggest that the diabetes risk associated with
sugar may be less than what is observed for artificially sweetened
sodas (Sakurai et al. 2014). In the current study, we do not observe
an independent effect of sucrose consumption on glucose toler-
ance independent of BMI, supporting the notion that it is calories
as opposed to sugar that may be leading to obesity and increased
diabetes risk (Hu and Malik 2010).
In humans, fructose consumption is thought to be related to
increased visceral adiposity and dyslipidemia even without weight
gain (Maersk et al. 2012). Although visceral adiposity and dyslipi-
demia are both associated with glucose intolerance (Boden 2002;
Borel et al. 2014), we did not observe that high-fructose consump-
tion has an independent effect on glucose tolerance. This may
indicate that our cut-off used to denote “high” fructose consump-
tion may not have been sufficiently high, or that the effects of
fructose on visceral adiposity were not sufficiently large to have a
negative impact on glucose tolerance independent of BMI.
The results of this study are based on 24-h self-reported diet and
may not be reflective of chronic intake patterns. However, it is
unclear whether chronic ingestion is needed to result in changes
in glucose tolerance, or if these results also apply to the newer
artificial sweeteners that are now currently used. Further, we are
unsure if there is a dose–response relationship between sweeten-
ers and changes in glucose tolerance, and the cross-sectional re-
sults observed here may be subject to reverse causation. Finally,
because of the multiple associations examined, there is the possi-
bility that the observations here are due to chance. Nevertheless,
these results are weighted to be representative of the United
States population and illustrate on a population level that sweet-
ener consumption may have clinically relevant impacts on glu-
cose tolerance and type 2 diabetes risk independent of BMI.
In conclusion, aspartame artificial sweetener consumption may
be associated with greater glucose intolerance, particularly for
those with obesity. Future research is needed to determine if from
an obesity and diabetes perspective, it may be prudent to limit all
sweetener consumption.
