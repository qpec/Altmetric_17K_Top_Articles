Effect of Deutetrabenazine on Chorea Among Patients
With Huntington Disease
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Huntington Study Group
IMPORTANCE Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates
CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to
stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea
associated with Huntington disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest
Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28;
lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and
randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind
fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites.
INTERVENTIONS Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over
8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score
change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to
maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by
in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores.
The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who
achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form–physical
functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington
disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor
signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect
size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety.

H
untington disease is a hereditary, progressive, neuro-
degenerative disease characterized by involuntary
movements, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric
symptoms. Huntington disease is caused by an exon 1 CAG
(cytosine-adenine-guanine [amino acid sequence]) trinucleo-
tide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene (NC_000004.12;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/568815594).1 A promi-
nent Huntington disease symptom is chorea, an involuntary,
sudden movement that can affect any muscle and flow ran-
domly across body regions.2 Chorea can interfere with daily
functioning and increase the risk of injury.3
Huntington disease treatment is presently focused on
symptomatic management. Tetrabenazine is a vesicular
monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitor that depletes mono-
amines, including dopamine, in the central nervous system.4
It is used worldwide and is the only US Food and Drug
Administration–approved therapy for treating chorea associ-
ated with Huntington disease. Despite established efficacy,
tetrabenazine is subject to variable CYP2D6 metabolism
and often requires 3-times-a-day dosing. In addition, there
may be some peak concentration–related neuropsychiatric
symptoms, such as sedation, fatigue, akathisia, anxiety,
or nausea.5
Deuterium is a nontoxic form of hydrogen. Based on its
increased mass relative to hydrogen, deuterium forms a
stronger bond with carbon that requires more energy for
cleavage, thus attenuating metabolism.6 Deuterium substitu-
tion in small-molecule drugs does not alter protein binding
interactions.7 Despite the broad interest in using deuterium
to improve the pharmacopeia, to date only deuterated tetra-
benazine (deutetrabenazine) has progressed to a phase 3
study.8
Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter
type 2 inhibitor structurally related to tetrabenazine: deute-
rium atoms at key positions in the molecule prolong plasma
half-life and reduce metabolic variability, without changing
target pharmacology.9 The longer half-life and unique phar-
macokinetic profile of deutetrabenazine due to deuterium
substitution9 may enable less frequent and lower daily doses,
thus achieving similar systemic exposure with lower peak
concentrations and simplified dosing compared with tetra-
benazine, resulting in an improved risk-benefit profile. This
study tested the efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine
compared with placebo to control chorea while reducing
peak concentration adverse effects.
Methods
Patients
Patients were identified and recruited solely through Hun-
tington Study Group investigational sites. Enrolled men and
women were ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest
Huntington disease, as indicated by characteristic motor
examination features and an expanded HTT CAG repeat
sequence (≥36). Race was collected for reporting descriptive
study demographics; it was self-reported using prespecified
fixed categories. Inclusion criteria included a Unified Hun-
tington’
s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), total maximal chorea
score of 8 or higher at screening and baseline10 and a UHDRS
total functional capacity score of 5 or higher at screening. The
total maximal chorea score is a standardized, reliable chorea
assessment based on frequency and severity in 7 body
regions, with a range of 0 to 28. The total functional capacity
is a 13-point standardized disease staging scale that assesses
an individual’
s ability to perform tasks in 5 functional areas; a
score of 5 or higher indicates that patients are in stages I
through III and have had a Huntington disease diagnosis for
approximately 15 years.
Patients were excluded for serious untreated or under-
treated psychiatric illness, such as depression, although
patients taking antidepressant therapy and stable could
enroll. Patients were excluded if they scored 11 or more on
the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (HADS) or had a history of significant suicidal
thoughts or behavior.11,12 Patients with a prolonged QTc inter-
val, left bundle-branch block, or hepatic or renal impairment
were excluded, as were patients with a score of 11 or higher
on the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire.13 Patients
were also assessed with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS)14 speech item and excluded with a score of 3
or higher. (This scale and criterion have been used previously
for Huntington disease.4)
Use of tetrabenazine (within 6 months) was exclusion-
ary, as was use of antipsychotics, metoclopramide, mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors, levodopa, dopamine agonists,
reserpine, amantadine, or memantine within 30 days. Pro-
tocol amendment following initiation of the study allowed
patients with prior tetrabenazine exposure in order to meet
enrollment expectations. Use of drugs that prolong QT
intervals other than escitalopram and citalopram were
excluded.
All exclusion criteria were developed to minimize con-
founding factors with study treatment (ie, medications that
may alter chorea) and for patient safety due to known effects
of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors or neu-
roleptic agents from previous clinical trials.
Consenting Process
This study was approved by the ethics boards at all involved
centers prior to patient enrollment. An independent qualified
Key Points
Question Does deutetrabenazine safely reduce chorea in patients
with Huntington disease?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 90
patients, total maximal chorea mean scores decreased from
baseline to maintenance treatment by 4.4 points in the
deutetrabenazine group vs 1.9 points in the placebo group,
a statistically significant difference.
Meaning Among patients with Huntington disease, the use of
deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in
improvement in chorea at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to
assess the clinical importance of the effect size.

clinician assessed all patients for capacity to provide
informed consent. Patients or legally authorized representa-
tives provided written informed consent, and patients with-
out capacity provided assent, if required by local regulations.
All patients were required to have daily contact with a study
partner; patients with more-advanced disease (total func-
tional capacity, 5-7) at screening were required to have a
live-in caregiver. The purpose of the study partner or care-
giver was to oversee study drug administration, ensure atten-
dance at study visits, and participate in evaluations.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study conducted at 34 sites in the United
States and Canada. Full details of the study protocol can be
found in the trial protocol in the Supplement. Throughout
the study, the patients, caregivers or study partners, investi-
gators, site personnel, data management staff, and steering
committee were blinded to treatment. The safety review
committee was blinded to treatment assignment but evalu-
ated treatment groups separately. Patients were titrated to an
optimal study drug dose level over 8 weeks, followed by 4
weeks of maintenance therapy. The 12-week treatment
period was followed by a 1-week washout. Patients were ran-
domized in a 1:1 ratio to deutetrabenazine or placebo using a
computerized randomization algorithm implemented via an
interactive web-based randomization system. The random-
ization was stratified by prior exposure to tetrabenazine (pre-
viously exposed vs not previously exposed).
Study Procedures
In-person study visits were conducted at weeks 2, 4, and 6 af-
ter initiating therapy, and telephone contacts at weeks 1, 3, 5,
7, and 8. The study drug was started at 6 mg/d and increased
weekly by 6 mg/d until chorea was adequately controlled, the
patient experienced a clinically significant adverse event, or
the 48-mg maximal allowable dose was reached. The study
drugwasadministeredin2dosesdaily,approximately10hours
apart.Doseadjustmentsweremadebasedonpatientandstudy
partner reports of adverse events and chorea control, assess-
ment of safety and efficacy by the investigator, and safety rat-
ing scales.
Patients continued to receive their maintenance dose
over another 4 weeks, with in-person visits at weeks 9 and 12
for safety and efficacy evaluation and a week-10 telephone
contact. Continuation of the maintenance dose was
expected, but dose reductions due to adverse events were
permitted. All patients discontinued the study drug after the
week-12 visit and returned 1 week later for safety and chorea
evaluation.
Treatment adherence was assessed by tablet count at ev-
ery visit while the patient was in the clinic. Percent adher-
ence was calculated as 100 × (number of tablets used/
number of tablets expected to be used), for which the number
of tablets used was equal to the number of tablets dispensed
minus the number of tablets returned. A patient was deemed
adherent if he/she had taken 80% to 105% of the expected
number of tablets.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy end point was the change in the total
maximal chorea score from baseline (defined as the average
of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to mainte-
nance therapy (defined as the average of values from the
week-9 and week-12 visits). The total maximal chorea score
(range, 0-28, lower score indicates less chorea) is the sum of
maximal chorea scores for 7 body regions (face, buccal-oral-
lingual, trunk, and 4 extremities), each of which is scored on
a scale from 0 to 4 (0, absent; 1, slight or intermittent; 2, mild
and common or moderate and intermittent; 3, moderate and
common; and 4, marked and prolonged).10 Four key pre-
specified secondary end points15 were assessed hierarchically
in the following order: Patient Global Impression of Change
(PGIC),16 Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC),17
36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)18 physical func-
tioning subscale score, and Berg Balance Test.19 The PGIC
and CGIC were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from
“very much improved” to “very much worse.” The PGIC
question asked: “With respect to your overall Huntington dis-
ease symptoms, how would you describe yourself now com-
pared to immediately before starting study medication?” The
CGIC was similarly worded. For PGIC and CGIC, treatment
success was defined as “much” or “very much” improved at
week 12. The SF-36 and Berg Balance Test were analyzed as
changes from day 0 to week 12. According to the most recent
American Academy of Neurology guidelines, the minimal
clinically important differences for the primary and second-
ary end points evaluated in this study have not been
determined.20 Additional prespecified efficacy end points
included change from baseline to the end of maintenance in
the UHDRS total motor score and the percentage change in
the total maximal chorea score.
Safety parameters included assessment of adverse
events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiogram
and assessment based on the following scales: UHDRS cogni-
tive, behavioral, and functional scales,10 Epworth Sleepiness
Scale,21 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale,22 Swallowing
Disturbance Questionnaire,13 UPDRS speech item,14 Barnes
Akathisia Rating Scale,23 HADS, and Montreal Cognitive
Assessment.24 These scales were analyzed as changes from
day 0 to week 12.

The complete statistical analysis plan can be found in the
Supplement. All analyses were conducted according to the
intention-to-treat model, with all patients included and
assigned to the treatment group to which they were ran-
domized. All statistical tests were 2-sided at the 5% level of
significance (P < .05). Versions 9.2 and 9.3 of the SAS statis-
tical software package were used for all analyses (SAS Insti-
tute Inc).
The primary analysis was performed using an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) model, with the total maximal chorea
score change from baseline as the dependent variable, the

treatment group as a factor, and the baseline total maximal
chorea score as a covariate. Deutetrabenazine and placebo
groups were compared using a 2-sided test at a 5% level of
significance. A supportive analysis for the primary end point
was carried out using all available data in a mixed model.
Secondary end points were analyzed in the prespecified
order as above, with any nonsignificant value rendering
remaining analyses exploratory rather than confirmatory.
Treatment success rates for PGIC and CGIC were compared
with Pearson χ2 tests, and changes in the SF-36 physical func-
tioning score, Berg Balance Test score, and total motor and
total maximal chorea score percentage changes were ana-
lyzed using ANCOVA models similar to that described for the
primary efficacy analysis. Baseline and maintenance values
are presented as mean (SDs) or mean 95% (CIs). ANCOVA
results are presented as adjusted mean changes and 95% CIs,
with the significance levels determined from the adjusted
analyses.
For the total maximal chorea, total motor, and Berg Bal-
ance Test scores, missing items were imputed if at least 80%
of the items for the corresponding score were not missing.
The values of the missing items were imputed by carrying
forward the most recent previous nonmissing value of the
corresponding item, because few missing data were antici-
pated. There were 2 patients who did not have their total
maximal chorea score at maintenance; however, it was deter-
mined that the effect of these were minimal to the overall
findings. The handling of missing data for individual items of
the SF-36 followed the scoring instructions given in the ques-
tionnaire manual for the calculation of summary scores. No
other missing data were imputed, and only observed data
were summarized.
Safety
Safetymeasureswerecomparedbytreatmentgroupusingsimi-
lar ANCOVA models. Adverse events were tabulated and com-
pared using Fisher exact tests.
Sample Size
Given a 1:1 randomization and assuming an SD of total maxi-
mal chorea score change from baseline to week 12 was equal
to 3.7, a sample size of 80 patients gave 90% power to detect
a treatment difference of a 2.7-unit change in total maximal
chorea score. A 10% dropout rate was anticipated. Although
the minimal clinically important difference for UHDRS has not
yet been determined, a treatment effect 2.7 units is consis-
tent with the previously published tetrabenazine clinical trial
of Huntington disease.4
Results
Baseline Comparability
One hundred twenty-three patients were screened, of whom
90 patients enrolled between August 2013 and August 2014
(Figure 1). Table 1 lists baseline characteristics. Five patients
had prior tetrabenazine exposure, 3 of whom were in the pla-
cebo group. With the exception of a higher Berg Balance Test
score in the deutetrabenazine group, the treatment groups
were comparable at baseline regarding Huntington disease
characteristics, including stage of disease with an overall
mean (SD) total functional capacity score of 9.5 (2.1). At
screening, 11 patients in the deutetrabenazine group and 13
patients in the placebo group had a total functional capacity
of 5 to 7, requiring a live-in caregiver. A total of 87 patients
(96.7%) completed the study.
Primary Efficacy Outcome
From baseline to maintenance, patients in the deutetrabena-
zine group had a mean –4.4 (95% CI, –5.3 to –3.6) improve-
ment in total maximal chorea score, whereas the placebo
group improved by –1.9 (95% CI, –2.8 to –1.1), with a treat-
ment difference of –2.5 (95% CI, –3.7 to –1.3; P < .001;
Figure 2). Following the washout, chorea returned to base-
line levels in both groups. Results using a repeated-measures
analysis were similar.
Secondary Outcomes
Twenty-three patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group
reported treatment success by the PGIC scale, whereas 9
patients (20%) in the placebo group reported treatment suc-
cess, for a treatment difference of 31.1 (95% CI, 12.4-49.8;
P = .002). Similarly 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine
group reported treatment success using the CGIC scale

vs 6 patients (13%) in the placebo group, for a treatment dif-
ference of 28.9 (95% CI, 11.4 to 46.4; P = .002). The SF-36
physical functioning subscale improved by 0.7 (95% CI, –2.0
to 3.4) for deutetrabenazine and worsened by –3.6 (95% CI,
–6.4 to –0.8) for the placebo group, for a treatment difference
of 4.34 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3; P = .03). There was no significant
difference in improvement in Berg Balance Test, which
improved by 2.2 (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) for deutetrabenazine group
and by 1.3 (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) for the placebo group. The mean
between-group difference was 1.0 (95% CI, –0.3 to 2.3;
P = .14).
Additional Efficacy Outcome Measures
The UHDRS total motor score improved by –7.4 (95% CI, –9.1
to –5.6) in the deutetrabenazine group vs –3.4 (95% CI, –5.1 to
–1.6) in the placebo group, for a mean between-group differ-
ence of –4.0 points (95% CI, –6.5 to –1.5; P = .002). The
majority of this improvement was due to chorea, but the total
maximal dystonia score also contributed, as determined by
post hoc analysis, with the deutetrabenazine group improv-
ing by –0.9 (95% CI, –1.4, to –0.5) points vs placebo group
improving by –0.1 (95% CI, –0.6 to 0.4) points, for a between-
group difference of –0.8 points (95% CI, –1.5 to –0.1; P = .02).
Changes in other UHDRS motor components did not differ
significantly between treatment groups, including no signifi-
cant difference in the changes in the parkinsonism subscore
(finger taps; pronation/supination; rigidity; bradykinesia;
gait; tandem walking; and retropulsion pull test scores).
From baseline to maintenance therapy, the percentage
change in the total maximal chorea score improved by –37%
(95% CI, –44 to –30) in the deutetrabenazine group vs –16%
(95% CI, –23 to –9) improvement in the placebo group, for a
between-group difference of –21% (95% CI, –30% to –11%;
P < .001).

a The UHDRS motor assessments are ranked on a scale of 0 (absent) to 4
(severe/prolonged). The summation of scores gives the final rating. The SF-36
physical functioning component is a questionnaire in which an increasing
score indicates improvement. The Berg Balance Test is a 14-item survey in
which a higher score denotes better balance. The Barnes Akathisia Rating
Scale rates are a summary score comprised of objective, subjective,

sleepiness, for which higher scores indicate increased daytime sleepiness.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a 14-item scale (7 items for
anxiety and 7 items for depression) with higher scores reflecting greater
frequency or severity of symptoms in the preceding week. The Montreal
Cognitive Assessment is a screening instrument in which higher scores denote
better cognitive function. The Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire is a
15-item questionnaire in which higher scores indicate greater impairment of
swallowing. UPDRS speech is a survey specifically pertaining to speech,
with higher scores indicating greater impairment.

Cognitive, Behavioral, and Functional Measures
Changesfrombaselinewerenotsignificantlydifferentbytreat-
ment group for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Table 2)
or UHDRS cognitive, behavioral, or functional measures.
Dosage
The mean (SD) dose at the end of treatment period was 39.7
mg (9.3 mg; range, 12-48 mg) in the deutetrabenazine group
and 43.3 mg (7.6 mg; range, 12-48 mg) in the placebo group.
Mean (SD) dosage for the 10 deutetrabenazine group
patients with impaired CYP2D6 function (poor metabolizers
or taking strong CYP2D6 inhibiting medications) was 34.8
mg (3.8 mg; range, 30-42 mg). The overall adherence rates
were 94.1% for the placebo group and 95.1% for the deutet-
rabenazine group.
Safety Outcomes
There were no significant differences between the treatment
groups in change from baseline to end of maintenance for the
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale,
UPDRS speech score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or the
HADS depression or anxiety subscales. Patients taking deu-
tetrabenazine showed improvement on the SDQ of –1.2 points
(95% CI, –2.0 to –0.3); placebo patients worsened by 0.3 points
(95% CI, –0.5 to 1.2), for a between-group mean difference of
−1.5 (95% CI, –2.7 to –0.3; P = .02). There were no clinically sig-
nificant differences between treatment groups in changes in
laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram.
The numbers of patients experiencing adverse events
overall and within psychiatric and nervous system areas were
similar in the deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (Table 3).
These adverse events were generally mild to moderate and
led to dose reduction in 3 patients (6.7%) in each group. The
most commonly reported adverse event in the deutetrabena-
zine group was somnolence, which generally resolved with-
out dose reduction.
Serious adverse events occurred in one patient (2.2%) per
group. The patient in the deutetrabenazine group experi-
enced cholecystitis and agitated depression, and patient in the
placebo group experienced a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation. All events resolved. The study drug was
suspended in both cases; these were the only drug suspen-
sions. The numbers of patients reporting depression or agi-
tated depression as an adverse event were not significantly dif-
ferentinthe2groups.ChangesinHADSdepressionandanxiety
scores were not significantly different (Table 2). One patient
per group reported suicidal ideation.
The deutetrabenazine group had a weight increase dur-
ing the treatment period, with a body mass index (BMI) gain
of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.3-0.9), compared with loss in the placebo
group of –0.1 (95% CI –0.4 to 0.2), for a mean between-group
difference of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3-1.2; P = .002).
Discussion
Deutetrabenazine treatment significantly improved chorea
control as measured by the total maximal chorea score, the
primary efficacy outcome. Significant improvement was
observed in the first 3 prespecified secondary end points,
PGIC, CGIC, and SF-36 physical functioning component
scales, although no improvement was observed in the Berg
Balance Test. In the absence of a well-accepted minimal clini-
cally important difference for total maximal chorea score,
this study was powered to detect a 2.7-point difference,
which is in line with the pivotal trial of tetrabenazine and
consistent with the percentage change in chorea.4 The
observed treatment effect of 2.5 points, the primary end
point result, taken together with improvements in patient-
centered end points, such as PGIC and SF-36 physical func-
tioning component scales, may be of clinical relevance,
although this remains to be determined. The difference in
total maximal chorea score associated with deutetrabenazine
treatment that was observed in this study is notable given the
progressive decline in total maximal chorea score and total
motor score that has been previously described as part of the
natural history of Huntington disease.25
Dystonia is a common motor feature associated with
Huntington disease and may have contributed to the sig-
nificant improvement in total motor score observed with

deutetrabenazinetreatmentcomparedwithplacebo.Therewas
nosignificantimprovementintotalmotorscorecomparedwith
placebo in the pivotal trial of tetrabenazine,4 and it is not clear
why the deuteration of tetrabenazine might improve dysto-
nia as well as chorea. Future investigation is warranted to con-
firm the results of these exploratory and post hoc analyses.
The safety profile of deutetrabenazine was similar to pla-
cebo in this study. Generally, there was no worsening of
depression, although there was one serious adverse event
related to agitated depression. Depression is a concern in any
patient with Huntington disease, with an increased need to
monitor patients taking vesicular monoamine transporter
type 2 inhibitors.26 The deutetrabenazine group did not sig-
nificantly differ from placebo in the parkinsonism UHDRS
motor subscore during 12 weeks of exposure. Tetrabenazine
and other antidopaminergic drugs used in chorea treatment
did significantly affect this subscore.27 However, longer-term
studies to monitor the development of depression and par-
kinsonism are needed. The increased incidence of diarrhea
with deutetrabenazine treatment, for which there is cur-
rently no known cause or association, needs to be closely
monitored in future studies.
Patients with more advanced disease were enrolled, and
cognitive measures suggested that the existing baseline cog-
nitive impairment did not worsen with deutetrabenazine
exposure. Although patients with Huntington disease often
lack insight into their own symptoms,3 patient-reported
outcome measures appeared to be reliable in assessing over-

comes were consistent with clinician-reported outcomes, sug-
gesting that the improvement in motor signs and symptoms
associated with deutetrabenazine treatment may be clini-
callymeaningful.Balancedifficultyandfallsarecommonprob-
lems in patients with Huntington disease. Although there was
no improvement in balance, there was also no worsening in
the measures of gait, which is meaningful since worsened bal-
ance is a potential adverse effect of lower dopamine effect in-
duced by neuroleptics or vesicular monoamine transporter in-
hibitors. Unified Huntington’
s Disease Rating Scale functional
measures did not differ by treatment group, but meaningful
functional change may require longer observation.
Improved swallowing function and reduced chorea may
explain weight gain in the deutetrabenazine group. Although
the SDQ was normal at baseline, as per inclusion criteria, it im-
proved slightly with deutetrabenazine. Weight loss is a pri-
mary Huntington disease symptom that may further worsen
motor function; thus, the observed increase in weight pa-
tients taking the drug vs placebo is a potential secondary ben-
efit for Huntington disease symptomatic treatments.28
Deuteriumchemistryoffersastrategyforalteringdrugme-
tabolismwhilesimultaneouslypreservingpharmacologicalac-

tetrabenzine is nearly doubled compared with the half-life of
active metabolites of tetrabenazine, allowing it to be admin-
isteredlessfrequentlyandinlowerdoseswhileachievingcom-
parable systemic exposure.9 Reduction in peak concentra-

rea associated with Huntington disease. In the pivotal tetra-
benazine trial that led to its US Food and Drug Administration
approval,44%ofpatientstreatedwithtetrabenazinehaddose-
limiting adverse events.4 These factors may limit use of tet-
rabenazine and lead to undertreatment of chorea. Peak-
concentration adverse effects, monitoring of multiple daily
doses, and drug interactions are key concerns in potentially
cognitively impaired patients. Deutetrabenazine technology
offers promise for other neurological treatments in which such
factors limit use or influence drug safety.
Genetic status of CYP2D6 was not associated with dosing
in this study. As expected, poor metabolizers, either through
genetics or concomitant medications, were dosed slightly
lower. The finding that these patients did not have additional
adverseeventssupportsthenotionthatdeutetrabenazinedos-
ing may be managed clinically without reliance on expensive
genotyping, but further research with longer-term follow-up
is needed to better assess safety.29,30
This study has several important limitations. Huntington
disease progresses over years to decades, and the findings in
this study should be interpreted in the context of a limited
duration of exposure. In addition, this study was not pow-
ered for detailed safety assessment. A longer-term open-label
safety trial is ongoing to evaluate deutetrabenazine in
patients with Huntington disease (NCT01897896). Patients
were stratified based on prior tetrabenazine exposure; how-
ever, this population was a small proportion of participants.
Clinical evaluation is ongoing to evaluate the effect of prior
tetrabenazine on deutetrabenazine efficacy and safety in a
patient population that more closely represents the general
population of patients with Huntington disease. Due to the
small number of patients per site, it was not possible to
include stratification by site in the randomization algorithm
or in the statistical analysis.
Conclusions
Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington dis-
ease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo re-
sulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research
is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size,
and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety.
