Summary
Background Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains often cause life-threatening community-acquired infections 
in young and healthy hosts, but are usually sensitive to antibiotics. In this study, we investigated a fatal outbreak of 
ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by a new emerging hypervirulent K pneumoniae strain.
Methods The outbreak occurred in the integrated intensive care unit of a new branch of the Second Affiliated Hospital 
of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). We collected 21 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains from five 
patients and characterised these strains for their antimicrobial susceptibility, multilocus sequence types, and genetic 
relatedness using VITEK-2 compact system, multilocus sequence typing, and whole genome sequencing. We selected 
one representative isolate from each patient to establish the virulence potential using a human neutrophil assay and 
Galleria mellonella model and to establish the genetic basis of their hypervirulence phenotype.
Findings All five patients had undergone surgery for multiple trauma and subsequently received mechanical 
ventilation. The patients were aged 53–73 years and were admitted to the intensive care unit between late February 
and April, 2016. They all had severe pneumonia, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae infections, and poor responses 
to antibiotic treatment and died due to severe lung infection, multiorgan failure, or septic shock. All five representative 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains belonged to the ST11 type, which is the most prevalent carbapenem-
resistant K pneumoniae type in China, and originated from the same clone. The strains were positive on the string 
test, had survival of about 80% after 1 h incubation in human neutrophils, and killed 100% of wax moth larvae 
(G mellonella) inoculated with 1 × 10⁶ colony-forming units of the specimens within 24 h, suggesting that they were 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae. Genomic analyses showed that the emergence of these ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains was due to the acquisition of a roughly 170 kbp pLVPK-like virulence plasmid by 
classic ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains. We also detected these strains in specimens collected in 
other regions of China.
Interpretation The ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains pose a substantial threat to human 
health because they are simultaneously hypervirulent, multidrug resistant, and highly transmissible. Control 
measures should be implemented to prevent further dissemination of such organisms in the hospital setting and the 
community.

Introduction
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major Gram-negative bacterial 
pathogen that can cause invasive hospital-acquired 
infections 
among 
immunocompromised 
patients.1 
Pyogenic liver abscesses caused by K pneumoniae have 
become a serious clinical challenge in Asia. In Taiwan, 
more than 3000 new cases of pyogenic liver abscesses 
occur each year.2 Compared with the classic K pneumoniae 
strains that cause other types of opportunistic infections, 
pyogenic liver abscess-associated K pneumoniae strains 
often have substantially higher virulence and are therefore 
designated hypervirulent K pneumoniae. Hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae has the ability to cause life-threatening, 
community-acquired infections such as liver abscesses, 
pneumonia, meningitis, and endophthalmitis in young 
and healthy individuals and is therefore associated with 
high morbidity and mortality.3 These strains can efficiently 
acquire iron and produce an increased amount of capsular 
substance compared with classic K pneumoniae, which 
confers a hypermucoviscous phenotype that is detectable 
as a positive result on the string test (a viscous string of 
>5 mm in length is produced when touched with an 
inoculation loop).3 The hypervirulent phenotype of 
K pneumoniae is thought to be attributable to the carriage 
of a virulence plasmid harbouring two capsular 
polysaccharide (CPS) regulator genes (rmpA and rmpA2) 
and several siderophore gene clusters that contribute to 
the hypermucoviscous phenotype.4,5 Correlation between 
carriage of the virulence plasmid and the hypervirulence 
phenotype has also been reported.6 To date, most 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains have been K1 or 
K2 types and have remained antibiotic-sensitive.7

In reports from 2013, the US Centers for Diseases 
Control and Prevention (CDC) described the emergence 
of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, 
which commonly cause untreatable or hard-to-treat 
infections among patients in hospitals, as an urgent 
public health threat. Carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae 
strains account for roughly 70–90% of clinical 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections in 
the European Union and China.8,9 The most common 
clinical carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains are 
those of the clonal group (CG) 258, with ST258 and ST11 
being the most prevalent multilocus sequence types in 
different parts of the world.10 ST258 is a hybrid clone 
composed of 80% of ST11 genome and 20% of ST442 
genome.10,11 ST258 has disseminated worldwide since its 
emergence in the early 2000s and has become particularly 
prevalent in North America, Latin America, and several 
European countries.10 However, in Asia, the dominant 
clone is ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae, 
which accounts for up to 60% of carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae in China.9 Consequently, in recent years, 
ST11 has been regarded as the most transmissible clone 
contributing to the increasing prevalence of carbapenem-
resistant K pneumoniae in China. In this study, we 
investigate a fatal ventilator-associated pneumonia 
outbreak in an intensive care unit (ICU) in a Chinese 
hospital with the aim of identifying the molecular basis 
for the hypervirulence of the emerging ST11 carbapenem-
resistant K pneumoniae strains responsible for this 
outbreak.
Methods
Outbreak investigation
In late March and April, 2016, we identified several cases of 
severe pneumonia in the integrated ICU of a new branch 
of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University 
(Hangzhou, China). This new integrated ICU consists of 
three units with a total of 26 wards and 40 beds, and has 
been open since November, 2015. Before the outbreak 
described, no patients in this ICU had reported severe 
symptoms of pneumonia or had poor outcomes with 
antibiotic treatments. We therefore initiated an outbreak 
investigation that included five patients. The first patient 
in this outbreak, who was suspected of being the index 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with no language restrictions for reports 
that were published from Jan 1, 2000, to May 5, 2017, and 
contained the terms “Hypervirulent and Klebsiella pneumoniae”, 
“Hypervirulent and Klebsiella pneumoniae and antimicrobial 
resistance”, “Klebsiella pneumoniae and ST11 and antimicrobial 
resistance”, “China and Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae”, 
“Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae and virulence plasmid”, 
“ST11 and Klebsiella pneumoniae and virulence plasmid ”, 
“Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae and virulence ”, and 
“Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated pneumonia”. 
We found only one publication that described the emergence of 
carbapenem-resistant K2/ST65 and K2/ST25 hypervirulent 
Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, as well as the first case of ST11 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae infection in Beijing, China, in 2015, 
which was defined on the basis of string test result. However, 
no virulence assays, such as human neutrophil survival assay or 
those involving animal models, were used to confirm the 
hypervirulence phenotype of this strain, in which no virulence 
plasmid or virulence-encoding genes were detectable. 
Additionally, the study found no significant difference between 
the clinical symptoms of patients infected by this 
carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strain and 
those infected with classic K pneumoniae strains. To date, 
carbapenem resistance and hypervirulence phenotypes are 
associated predominantly with K1 and K2 type organisms 
carrying virulence plasmids, with only carbapenem-resistant K1 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains having been reported to cause 
lethal infections. No report has described the phenotypic features 
and underlying resistance mechanisms of the hypervirulent ST11 
K pneumoniae strains or clinical manifestations of diseases caused 
by such strains.
Added value of this study
Our results showed that carbapenem-resistant ST11 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae (ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae) strains have emerged and can 
cause fatal ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients in 
hospital. Such strains have disseminated across various 
regions of China, accounting for as much as 3% of clinical ST11 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae infections in the country. 
ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae has a 
hypervirulence phenotype characterised by a positive string 
test result, extremely high survival on exposure to human 
neutrophils, and high virulence in a wax moth 
(Galleria mellonella) larva infection model. The emergence of 
ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae 
strains was due to the acquisition of a roughly 170 kbp 
virulence plasmid carrying the rmpA2 and aerobactin 
biosynthesis genes by classic ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strains.
Implications of all the available evidence
ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains 
are expected to pose a substantial threat to human health 
because these strains are simultaneously hypervirulent, 
multidrug resistant, and highly transmissible. Because of the 
genetic similarity between ST11 and ST258 types of 
K pneumoniae, ST258 hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains might 
have emerged and become transmissible in the USA and in 
European countries. Future research should focus on the 
development of intervention measures to prevent further 
dissemination of such organisms in hospital settings.

patient, had previously been admitted to a local hospital 
(Fuyang People’s Hospital in the Fuyang district of 
Hangzhou) for multiple trauma caused by a car accident 
and was transferred to the ICU of our hospital on 
Feb 28, 2016. The other four patients were admitted in 
March and April. All five patients stayed in different wards 
of the ICU, but all had overlapping stays in the ICU during 
this outbreak. All clinical data were collected in accordance 
with the ORION checklist. Bacterial strains were isolated 
from sample specimens at the clinical laboratory of the 
hospital. We subjected the isolated strains to phenotypic 
and genotypic characterisation to identify the causative 
agent and understand the molecular basis of the high 
mortality of these causative agents. We obtained 
permission to report the cases from the patients’ families.
Phenotypic characterisation
We used a VITEK-2 compact system (bioMérieux, 
Marcy-l’Étoile, France) to establish the strain identity and 
antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates and we 
interpreted these in accordance with the guideline 
document M100-S26 established by Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute.12 We confirmed the species identity of 
all isolates via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation 
mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA).
We identified capsular antigens by PCR targeting genes 
encoding for K1, K2, K5, K20, K54 and K57 antigens 
as previously described.13 We screened for β lactamase 
genes by PCR as previously reported.14
We did conjugation experiments, pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) multilocus sequence typing 
(MLST), S1-PFGE, and Southern hybridisation as reported 
previously.14 We also did plasmid curing experiments, 
which were done as previously described,15 to test whether 
the putative virulence plasmid contributed to the 
hypervirulence phenotype of these strains.
For the string test to identify the hypermucoviscous 
phenotype, all isolates were inoculated onto agar 
plates containing 5% sheep blood and incubated at 
37°C overnight. The string test was deemed positive 
when a viscous string longer than 5 mm could be 
generated by touching and pulling a single colony 
upwards with a standard inoculation loop.3
As a test of virulence, we did the human neutrophil 
assay as described previously.16 Briefly, we isolated 
neutrophils from the venous blood of healthy volunteers, 
who had provided written informed consent before 
participation in the studies. We measured the bactericidal 
activity of neutrophils by incubating 1 × 10⁶ neutrophils 
with 1 × 10⁶ colony-forming units (CFU) of opsonised 
K pneumoniae in RPMI/H medium at 37°C with intervals 
of 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min, with gentle rotation. 
1% saponin was added to each tube, mixed, and then 
chilled on ice for 15 min before diluting and plating on 
Luria broth agar. Survival was expressed as the percentage 
of CFUs recorded after neutrophil treatment compared 
with the control. We analysed the data using a one-way 
ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test on GraphPad Prism 
version 6.0b).
We also tested virulence in wax moth (Galleria mellonella) 
larvae weighing about 300 mg (purchased from 
Tianjin Huiyude Biotech Company, Tianjin, China) and 
maintained on woodchips in the dark at 15°C until 
being used. Overnight cultures of K pneumoniae strains 
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
and further adjusted with PBS to concentrations of 
1 × 10⁴ CFU/mL, 1 × 10⁵ CFU/mL, 1 × 10⁶ CFU/mL, and 
1 × 10⁷ CFU/mL. We infected the G mellonella with the 
bacteria as described previously and we recorded the 
survival rate of the G mellonella.17,18 All experiments were 
done in triplicate.
Genomic characterisation
We sequenced genomes using the NextSeq 500 sequencing 
platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We trimmed or 
filtered raw reads to remove low-quality sequences and 
adaptors and assembled them de novo with the SPAdes 
Genome Assembler version 3.9.1.19 We annotated the draft 
genome sequences with the RAST tool version 220 and 
Prokka 1.12.21 We compared genome sequences using the 
BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) version 0.95.22 We 
did the pangenome analysis with Roary: the pangenome 
pipeline (version 3.6.0) using the Prokka annotation.23 We 
analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the 
CSI Phylogeny 1.4 pipeline available from the Center for 
Genomic Epidemiology with default settings and whole 
genome sequence raw reads for the analysis. We did 
capsular typing on the assembled sequences using Kaptive.24 
We deposited the genome sequences in GenBank under the 
accession numbers SAMN07259328 (K pneumoniae 1), 
SAMN07259327 (K pneumoniae 2), SAMN07259329 
(K pneumoniae 3), SAMN07259326 (K pneumoniae 4), 
SAMN07259325 (K pneumoniae 5), SAMN07259330 (FJ8), 
SAMN07259331 (FJ9), SAMN07259332 (hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae 1088), and SAMN07259333 (carbapenem-
resistant K pneumoniae SH1). We identified the antibiotic 
resistance genes and virulence loci with the assembled 
genome sequences using ResFinder 2.125 and the BIGSdb 
Klebsiella genome database.26 We generated a heatmap of 
the virulence loci with Genesis software version 1.7

.27
To check for the presence of the virulence plasmid in 
clinical ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae isolates 
collected from patients in major hospitals located in 
25 provinces and municipalities in China (provided by 
our collaborators),9 we screened the isolates with four 
sets of primers (appendix p 8) targeting the rmpA, rmpA2, 
iucA, and iroN genes.

Results
Five patients aged 53–73 years were admitted to the ICU 
between late February and April, 2016. These five patients 
were admitted for various forms of trauma due to car 
accidents, falling objects, or atlantoaxial subluxation. 
They all underwent surgery, followed by antimicrobial 
treatment and mechanical ventilation (figure 1; appendix 
p 9). The five patients developed pneumonia and all 
showed the typical symptoms of pulmonary oedema, 
pleural effusion, excessive sputum, and shortness of 
breath. Multiple species of bacteria could be isolated from 
blood, sputum, and faecal samples of the patients, with 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae being consistently 
isolated in all patients and present in different types of 
specimen before the patients died, suggesting that 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae might be the 
causative agent of the outbreak. They responded poorly to 
antibiotic treatment. The duration of the infections lasted 
from 10 days to 4 months for these patients. All five 
patients died of severe lung infection, multiorgan failure, 
or septic shock after carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae 
could be recovered from their blood or sputum samples. 
Detailed information about the patients is available in the 
appendix (pp 3–7, 14, 15).

21 non-repeated carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae 
strains were recovered from various clinical specimens of 
the five patients. These strains had almost identical 
antibacterial susceptibility profiles, belonged to ST11 and 
shared highly similar PFGE patterns (appendix pp 16–18). 
Strains recovered from the same patient had identical 
PFGE profiles, except for patient 4, who had four strains 
that belonged to the major PFGE pattern and two strains 
(K pneumoniae 4.4 and 4.5) with different PFGE patterns 
and plasmid profiles, suggesting that patient 4 was 
simultaneously infected by two different clones of 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae (appendix pp 16–20). 
We selected one representative carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strain from each patient (K pneumoniae 1–5; 
for patient 4, we selected the strain isolated from blood 
samples) for further genetic and phenotypic characterisation 
(table). The corresponding transconjugants are termed 
C1–C5, respectively. The carbapenem and cephalosporin 
resistance phenotypes of these five strains could be 
transferred to the Escherichia coli strain EC600. All 
five isolates carried the blaKPC-2, blaCTX-M-65, and blaTEM-1 genes, 
which were located in conjugative plasmids (table). The 
MLST using the draft genome data showed that these five 
strains, K pneumoniae 1–5, belonged to ST11 and serotype 
K47 (wzi 209). Pairwise SNP analysis for these five strains 
based on their raw sequencing reads showed that their core 
genome differed only by a few SNPs (n≤4), suggesting that 
these strains originated from a single clone (appendix p 10).
Compared with other ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae infections, the carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strains in this outbreak caused much more 
severe pneumonia and higher mortality.28 We speculated 
that these ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains 
might be more virulent than previously reported 
ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains, which 
prompted us to investigate the virulence potential of these 
isolates. The string test was positive for all five ST11 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae outbreak strains, 
which each produced strings longer than 20 mm 
(appendix p 21). We used a human neutrophil assay to test 
the virulence potential of two representative outbreak 
strains, K pneumoniae 4 and 5, two classic ST11 strains, 
FJ8 and FJ9, which produced a negative string test result, 
and two K1 hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains, 
1088 and 91, which were reported previously.29 The 
K pneumoniae 4 and 5 strains had survival of about 80% after 
incubation with the human neutrophils for 60 min, which 
was slightly higher than that of the K1 hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae strains 1088 and 91 (figure 2). However, the 
survival of strains FJ8 and FJ9, at 25% after 15 min, 
10% after 30 min, and 3% after 60 min incubation 
respectively, was significantly lower than that of 
K pneumoniae 4 and 5 (p<0·0001 by one-way ANOVA; 
figure 2). 
We infected G mellonella larvae with selected 
K pneumoniae strains: with an inoculum of 1 × 10⁶ CFU, 
the classic ST11 strain FJ8 survival was 80% at 48 h after

infection; survival was 0% with the K1 hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae strain 1088 at 48 h and 40% with the K1 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strain 91 at 36 h post-infection. 
The ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae outbreak 
strains K pneumoniae 1, 3, 4, and 5 resulted in 0% survival 
by 12 h; 0% survival was reached with K pneumoniae 2 
after 24 h, suggesting that strains K pneumoniae 1–5 were 
more virulent than the K1 hypervirulent K pneumoniae 
strains 1088 and 99, as well as the classic ST11 
K pneumoniae strains, FJ8 and FJ9 (figure 3). Data on the 
effects of the other inoculums of these strains are available 
in the appendix (pp 22, 23). The consistency between the 
clinical data and the results of the phenotypic assays 
supported the notion that the ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strains, K pneumoniae 1–5, were ST11 
carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae.
Pangenome analysis of nine ST11 strains (SH-1, 
K pneumoniae 1–5, FJ8, HS11268, and JM45) identified a 
unique set of genes in the five ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains, which aligned well 
with the virulence plasmid pLVPK (AY378100), a 
219 385 bp IncHI1B/IncFIB plasmid recovered from 
K pneumoniae strain CG43 (appendix pp 24, 25). In the 
virulence gene analysis, we found that all ST11 strains 
tested, except for HS11286, had type 3 fimbriae 
(mrkABCDF) and type 1 fimbrial adhesion genes 
(fimA–H), as well as the iroE, iutA, kpn, and ycfM genes, 
which encode various virulence factors, suggesting that 
these virulence genes might be typical of ST11 
K pneumoniae (figure 4; appendix p 11, 12). The K1 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains NTUH-K2044 and 
1088 lacked these virulence genes typical of ST11 strains, 
but harboured a different set of virulence genes including 
iroBCDN, iucABCD, rmpA and rmpA2, and irp1 and irp2, 
which were located in the virulence plasmid pLVPK 
(figure 4; appendix pp 11, 12).5 In addition to harbouring 
the typical virulence genes for ST11 strains, the five 
outbreak strains also contained the iucABCD, rmpA2, and 
iutA genes. This finding was consistent with the results 
of the pangenome analysis in that virulence plasmid-
related genes were unique to ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae, but not the classic ST11 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains (figure 4; 
appendix pp 24, 25).
Alignment of contigs showed that all five ST11 
carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent 
K 
pneumoniae 
outbreak strains carried a plasmid that aligned well to 
most parts of the pLVPK plasmid, including the region in 
which the rmpA2, iucABCD, and iutA genes were located, 
but not to a roughly 50 kbp region carrying the rmpA and 
iroBCDN (salmochelin) genes. Southern hybridisation 
confirmed the presence of a roughly 170 kbp virulence 
plasmid in all five strains (figure 5). The complete 
sequence of the virulence plasmid from strain 
K pneumoniae 4, pVir-CR-HvKP4 (178 154 kbp), aligned 
well to pLVPK (figure 5). pVir-CR-HvKP4 is an 
IncHI1B/IncFIB-type plasmid with a length of 178 154 bp 
and an average GC content of 50·5%, which encodes 216 
predicted open reading frames. It shares 99% identity 
with pRJF999 (GenBank CP014011), pK2044 (GenBank 
AP006726), pRJA166b (GenBank CP019049), pRJF293 
(GenBank CP014009), and pLVPK (GenBank AY378100), 
with query coverages ranging from 90% to 97%. We also 
obtained the complete sequence of a blaKPC-2-carrying 
plasmid from K pneumoniae 4, pKPC-CR-HvKP4

(MF437312), and found it to be a similar size (177 585 bp) 
to pVir-CR-HvKP4 (MF437313; appendix p 26). To test 
whether acquisition of the roughly 170 kbp virulence 
plasmid contributed to the hyper 
virulence phenotype 
of 
the 
ST11 
carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae strains, we used the plasmid curing 
approach to remove the virulence plasmid pVir-CR-HvKP4 
from 
K 
pneumoniae 
4, 
to 
produce 
the 
strain 
PC-K pneumoniae 4 (appendix pp 27, 28). Subsequently, 
we found that strain PC-K pneumoniae 4 had a negative 
string test phenotype and substantially reduced survival 
in human neutrophils (figure 2) and virulence in 
G mellonella (figure 3), supporting the notion that pVir-
CR-HvKP4 contributed to the hypervirulence phenotype 
of K pneumoniae 4 (appendix p 22, 23) and, by extension, 
the other newly emerged ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hyper 
virulent K pneumoniae strains.
We 
retrospectively 
screened 
387 
clinical 
ST11 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains collected 
from 25 provinces and municipalities in China in 2015 
for the presence of the virulence plasmid. 11 (3%) of the 
387 ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains 
carried the virulence plasmid. Of these 11 isolates, two 
carried the rmpA2 and iucA genes. The other nine 
isolates had two additional virulence genes, rmpA and 
iroN, suggesting that these isolates could harbour the full 
length of virulence plasmid pLVPK. Whole genome 
sequencing of SH-1, one of the 11 strains, confirmed that 
it had virulence plasmid highly similar to pLVPK 
(figure 5; appendix p 13). These 11 carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strains, all of which carried the blaKPC-2 
gene, were collected from three different provinces. 
Strains from within the same region were more closely 
genetically related than those recovered from different 
regions (appendix pp 16–18). Retrospective analysis of 
the clinical records showed that these 11 ST11 
K pneumoniae were recovered from blood and sputum 
culture of the patients, and that five of the 11 patients 
died and the other six patients were discharged with 
critical illnesses, suggesting that these 11 isolates could 
cause substantial morbidity and mortality.
Discussion
Our results show the emergence of new ST11 carbapenem-
resistant hyper virulent K pneumoniae strains that caused 
fatal hospital infections. Due to acquisition of a 
virulence plasmid by classic ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
K pneumoniae strains, these new strains are simultaneously 
hypervirulent, multidrug resistant, and transmissible, and 
should therefore be regarded as a real superbug that could 
pose a serious threat to public health.

Known virulence factors of K pneumoniae that are 
responsible for disease progression include, but are not 
limited to surface antigens, especially CPS (K antigen), 
siderophores that are responsible for binding ferric iron 
secreted by the iron-binding proteins of the host, and 
adherence factors that are responsible for attachment to 
host cell surfaces, such as type 1 and type 3 fimbriae and 
non-fimbrial adhesion proteins.30 Consistently, K1 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains such as NTUH-K2044 
and 1088 have been shown to produce virulence factors 
associated with surface antigen and siderophores, which 
are encoded by genes located in a virulence plasmid. 
ST11 K pneumoniae strains, however, have been shown 
to express various adherence factors. The putative 
functional roles of fimbriae and outer membrane 
lipoproteins in biofilm formation and the development 
of antibiotic resistance might explain why the ST11 
K pneumoniae strains were more resistant to antibiotics 
than hypervirulent K pneumoniae.31 It has previously been 
common for ST11-type K pneumoniae to be resistant to 
carbapenems, but not hypervirulent. The acquisition of a 
roughly 170 kbp virulence plasmid represents an 
important evolution event underlying the emergence of 
ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae 
strains that have virulence factors from both K1 and K2 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae and ST11 carbapenem-
resistant K pneumoniae strains. ST11 hypervirulent 
K 
pneumoniae 
strains 
are 
therefore 
not 
only 
highly resistant to antibiotics, but also hypervirulent. 
Clinically, the ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae strains caused more severe disease than 
classic ST11 strains and high mortality. Despite being 
susceptible to tigecycline in in-vitro minimum inhibitory 
concentration tests, long-term treatment with this 
antibiotic (alone or in combination with several other 
antibiotics) or even polymyxin B, was not able to eradicate 
such organisms from the bloodstream, consistently 
resulting in a fatal outcome. Unfortunately, ceftazidime 
with avibactam is not available in China, so we could not 
test their efficacy in treating these ST11 carbapenem-
resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae.
Since none of the available antibiotics was effective in 
treating infections caused by ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae, we have implemented a new 
infection prevention and control (IPC) policy to control the 
outbreak in the hospital. Current consensus IPC policy on 
multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens in China includes 
hand hygiene management, isolation of patients, periodic 
environmental cleansing and equipment disinfection, 
investigation of outbreak agents, and cautious use of 
antibiotics. We tried to map route or routes of transmission 
of 
these 
ST11 
carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent 
K pneumoniae strains, but we were unable to do so. We 
speculated that patients transferred from a small-scale 
local hospital, where the IPC standard was low, might be 
the sources of carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae 
infections. In view of this risk, we modified the IPC policy 
to control the outbreak. First, we introduced pre-screening 
of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in faecal and 
sputum samples of patients before their admission to the

carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains, a plasmid recovered 
from strain K1 hypervirulent K pneumoniae 1088, and a plasmid harboured by 
strain ST11 K pneumoniae SH-1, against the known virulence plasmid pLVPK from 
the K pneumoniae strain CG43 (AY378100). The circular map was generated with 
the BLAST Ring Image Generator. Plasmids, pLVPK and pVir-CR-HvKP4 (accession 
number MF437313) were mapped with complete sequences, whereas others 
were generated by aligning the draft genome sequences to pLVPK. Plasmid pVir-
CR-HvKP4 is the virulence plasmid from ST11 carbapenem-resistant 
hypervirulent K pneumoniae strain K pneumoniae 4. (B) S1-PFGE and Southern

ICU. Second, we implemented stringent isolation 
procedures for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae-
bearing patients. Third, it was made necessary for medical 
personnel who came into contact with patients infected 
with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae to go 
through a disinfection procedure. Finally, the ICU wards 
where 
the 
carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae-
positive patients stayed were completely disinfected after 
the discharge of the patients and left unoccupied for more 
than 2 weeks after disinfection and before the admission 
of new patients. Since the implementation of these IPC 
procedures in this ICU, no fatal infections due to ST11 
carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae have 
occurred as of April, 2017
. More evidence is needed to 
confirm that this IPC policy is effective in preventing 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections in 
hospitals.
The main limitation of this study is that only a small 
number of cases have been investigated. A large-scale 
study on the relationship between the clinical outcomes of 
infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae 
strains with or without the virulence plasmid is underway 
to provide more evidence on the clinical significance of 
these newly emerged strains.
Importantly, these ST11 carbapenem-resistant hyper-
virulent K pneumoniae were found to have disseminated 
in other parts of China, signifying that their threat to 
human health is imminent. Worldwide surveillance of 
these carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae 
strains 
and 
implementation 
of 
stricter 
control 
measures are needed to prevent these novel strains from 
further disseminating in hospital settings and the 
community.
