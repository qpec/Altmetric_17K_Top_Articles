IMPORTANCE The data reported herein were accepted for assessment by the US Food and
Drug Administration for Biologics License Application under priority review to establish the
clinical benefit of durvalumab as second-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic
urothelial carcinoma (UC), resulting in its recent US approval.
OBJECTIVE To report a planned update of the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in patients
with locally advanced/metastatic UC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is an ongoing phase 1/2 open-label study of 191
adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced/metastatic UC
whose disease had progressed on, were ineligible for, or refused prior chemotherapy from 60
sites in 9 countries as reported herein.
INTERVENTION Patients were administered durvalumab intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg every
2 weeks, for up to 12 months or until progression, starting another anticancer therapy, or
unacceptable toxic effects.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end points were safety and confirmed objective
response rate (ORR) per blinded independent central review (Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1).
RESULTS A total of 191 patients with UC had received treatment. As of October 24, 2016
(90-day update), the median follow-up was 5.78 months (range, 0.4-25.9 months). The
median age of patients was 67.0 years and most were male (136 [71.2%]) and white (123
[71.1%]). All patients had stage 4 disease, and 190 (99.5%) had prior anticancer therapy (182
[95.3%] postplatinum). The ORR was 17.8% (34 of 191; 95% CI, 12.7%-24.0%), including 7
complete responses. Responses were early (median time to response, 1.41 months), durable
(median duration of response not reached), and observed regardless of programmed cell
death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression (ORR, 27.6% [n = 27; 95% CI, 19.0%-37.5%] and 5.1%
[n = 4; 95% CI, 1.4%-12.5%] in patients with high and low or negative expression of PD-L1,
respectively). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.5 months (95% CI,
1.4-1.9 months) and 18.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 months to not estimable), respectively; the
1-year overall survival rate was 55% (95% CI, 44%-65%), as estimated by Kaplan-Meier
method. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 13 patients (6.8%);
grade 3/4 immune-mediated AEs occurred in 4 patients (2.1%); and treatment-related AEs led
to discontinuation of 3 patients (1.6%), 2 of whom had immune-mediated AEs that led to
death (autoimmune hepatitis and pneumonitis).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Durvalumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, demonstrates
favorable clinical activity and an encouraging and manageable safety profile in patients with
locally advanced/metastatic UC.

utcome for patients who relapse after chemotherapy
for stage 4 urothelial carcinoma (UC) is poor. Optimal
second-line chemotherapy remains undefined.1 As
such,thereisasignificantunmetneedfortherapiesthatarewell
tolerated and confer clinical benefit in this population. Recent
encouraging data with immune checkpoint inhibitors have re-
sulted in positive randomized phase 3 studies and regulatory
approvals.
The presence of tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells is as-
sociated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients with lo-
cally advanced or metastatic UC.2 However, UC tumors may
evade immune detection by exploiting inhibitory checkpoint
pathways that suppress T-cell responses, such as the pro-
grammed cell death-1 (PD-1)–programmed cell death ligand-1
(PD-L1) pathway.3-5 Moreover, UCs demonstrate relatively high
PD-L1 expression compared with other tumors.6 Although the
relationship between PD-L1 expression and outcome is com-
plex and likely dependent on assessment methods (as evi-
denced in the nivolumab phase 2 and pembrolizumab phase
3trials),2,7,8PD-L1blockademayovercomethisimmunecheck-
point, resulting in prolonged T-cell activation and possible tu-
mor rejection.9 Indeed, several anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents have
shown preliminary activity with acceptable safety in patients
withlocallyadvanced/metastaticUC.7,8,10-14Forexample,treat-
ment with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab was asso-
ciated with a 27% reduction in risk of death vs chemotherapy
among previously treated patients with UC.8
Durvalumab is a selective, high-affinity, engineered hu-
man IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1 binding to
PD-1(half-maximalinhibitoryconcentration[IC50],0.1nM)and
CD80 (IC50, 0.04 nM).15 An ongoing, multicenter, phase 1/2
open-label study (NCT01693562) is evaluating the safety and
antitumor activity of durvalumab monotherapy in patients
with advanced solid tumors, including locally advanced
/metastatic UC. An interim analysis of 61 patients with UC in
this study indicated that durvalumab was well tolerated and
associatedwithantitumoractivity,particularlyinpatientswith
PD-L1-high disease (≥25% of tumor cells [TCs] or tumor-
infiltrating immune cells expressing PD-L1),16 resulting in its
breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
We report a planned analysis of the safety and efficacy of
durvalumab in patients with locally advanced/metastatic UC
from this phase 1/2 study. These data were accepted for as-
sessment by the FDA for Biologics License Application under
priority review, resulting in recent US approval of dur-
valumab for postplatinum, locally advanced/metastatic UC.
Theyinclude,forthefirsttime,resultsforprogression-freesur-
vival (PFS) and OS. In addition, safety findings for the overall
population of patients with any solid tumor from this study
are reported.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
For the overall study population, patients with solid tumors
ages 18 years or older with histologically and/or cytologically
confirmed disease were eligible for inclusion. Eligible pa-
tients could have disease that progressed on prior therapy or
be treatment-naïve, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performancestatus0/1,andhadadequateorganandbonemar-
row function. Patients were not eligible if they had received
any immunotherapy or investigational anticancer therapy
within the past 4 weeks (6 weeks for monoclonal antibodies)
or if they were receiving any concurrent chemotherapy, im-
munotherapy, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer. Pa-
tients who met these criteria and had locally advanced/
metastatic UC and whose disease had progressed while they
were receiving prior therapy or were ineligible for or refused
any number of prior therapies were eligible for inclusion in the
UC cohort.16
This study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and approved by the independent ethics committee
or institutional review board at each participating center, with
writteninformedconsentobtainedfromallpatients.Studypar-
ticipants were not compensated. See Supplement 1 for the trial
protocol and the statistical analysis plan.
Procedures
Durvalumab was administered by intravenous infusion, 10
mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), for up to 12 months, or until con-
firmed progressive disease, initiation of another anticancer
therapy,unacceptabletoxiceffects,consentwithdrawal,orother
reasons for discontinuation. For patients with disease progres-
sion during follow-up who had not received another antican-
cer therapy and had not met criteria for discontinuing study
treatment, a 12-month course of durvalumab retreatment was
allowed. Safety was assessed from start of study with monitor-
ing continued through 90 days after the last durvalumab dose
or until initiation of another anticancer therapy. Toxic effects
were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Tumor
assessments occurred at 6, 12, and 16 weeks, and every 8 weeks
thereafter during treatment. Following discontinuation, tu-
morassessmentswereperformedevery2monthsfor1yearand
then every 3 months thereafter.
Outcomes
Primary safety end points included AEs, serious AEs, labora-
tory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations. Also
Key Points
Question Does durvalumab provide clinical benefit to patients
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC)?
Findings In a phase 1/2 open-label study of 191 patients with
locally advanced/metastatic UC, confirmed objective response
rate with durvalumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, was 17.8%,
including 7 complete responses, and median progression-free
survival and overall survival were 1.5 and 18.2 months,
respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related and immune-mediated
adverse events occurred in 13 patients (6.8%) and 4 patients
(2.1%), respectively.
Meaning Durvalumab shows favorable efficacy and an excellent
safety profile in patients with locally advanced/metastatic UC.

 assessed were AEs of special interest (AESIs) and immune-
mediatedadverseevents(imAEs[AESIsrequiringsystemicste-
roids,endocrinetherapy,orotherimmunosuppressantswithin
30 days of onset and prior to resolution that were consistent
with an immune-mediated mechanism and had no clear al-
ternate etiology]). The primary efficacy end point was objec-
tive response rate (ORR; proportion with confirmed com-
plete response or partial response by blinded independent
central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1).17 Key secondary end points in-
cluded duration of response, time to response, change in tar-
get lesion size, disease control rate (confirmed complete re-
sponse or partial response or stable disease for ≥6 weeks), PFS
(time from first dose until documented disease progression
per RECIST, version 1.1, or death), and OS (time from first dose
until death).
PD-L1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemi-
cal analysis in tumor tissue obtained prior to treatment, using
the SP-263 anti-PD-L1 antibody assay (Ventana Medical Sys-
tems), as described previously.16 With respect to patient eligi-
bility for the trial, the first 20 patients were enrolled regardless
ofPD-L1expression16;however,preliminarydatasuggestedthat
PD-L1maybeexpressedmorecommonlyonimmunecellsthan
on TCs.11 Therefore, to ensure assessment of the contribution
of PD-L1–expressing TCs to response with durvalumab, sub-
sequently enrolled patients (n = 43) were required to have
PD-L1 expression of at least 5% on TCs. However, an interim
analysis showed that ORRs in patients with less than 5% PD-L1
expression (n = 86) were similar to ORRs in all patients. There-
fore, a protocol amendment removed this requirement. For
purposes of biomarker analyses, a 25% cutoff for defining TC-
or immune cell–dependent expression status was chosen, as
previously described,16 because this cutoff seemed to enrich
for response, based on review of PD-L1 expression in the first
20 enrolled patients who were followed for a minimum of 12
weeks. This exploratory analysis also suggested the optimal
scoringalgorithmtobeauniquecombinedassessmentofPD-L1
staining of TCs and immune cells (PD-L1 “high,
”≥25% of either
TCsorimmunecellsstainingforPD-L1,andPD-L1“lowornega-
tive,”<25% of both TCs and immune cells staining for PD-L1).
Statistical Analysis
This planned study update is based on more than 3 times as
many patients and increased follow-up compared with the ini-
tialreportofthisstudy,16anditstimingwaspredicatedbyregu-
latory interactions. In addition, we examined time to onset of
treatment-related AEs and AESIs, which was defined as the
time from the first dose of study treatment to the onset date
of the AE. All patients who received their first dose of dur-
valumab at least 30 days before July 24, 2016 (data cutoff for
the interim analysis), were included in the safety and efficacy
analyses (“as-treated” population). A total of 191 patients with
UC would provide a width between the observed ORR and its
lower limit of the exact 2-sided 95% CI ranging from 6% to 7%,
when the ORR was expected to be in the 20% to 30% range.
The ORR, disease control rate, and their respective exact
2-sided 95% CIs were estimated using the Clopper-Pearson
method and by PD-L1 expression status (although the study
was not designed to perform formal statistical comparisons
of PD-L1 subgroups). Time-to-event end points, such as
duration of response (in patients with objective response),
PFS, OS, time to response, landmark PFS and OS rates, and
cumulative incidences of AEs, were estimated by Kaplan-
Meier method (relevant censoring times are defined in
the eMethods in Supplement 2) with 2-sided 95% CIs pro-
vided by Brookmeyer and Crowley method. SAS statistical
software (version 9.3 or higher) was used for all statistical
analyses.
Results
Patients in the UC Cohort
Atotalof191patientswithlocallyadvanced/metastaticUCfrom
60 sites across 9 countries had received treatment (as-
treated population) (Figure 1). The median exposure dura-
tion in the as-treated UC population was 2.8 months (range,
0.4-12.5 months), and the median follow-up was 5.78
months (range, 0.4-25.9 months). As of the data cutoff of
October 24, 2016 (90-day update), 44 patients (23.0%) were
still receiving durvalumab.
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients
with UC are summarized in Table 1 (eTable 1 in Supplement 2
summarizes baseline characteristics for all patients who re-
ceived durvalumab, 10 mg/kg Q2W [n = 970]). The median age

(136 [71.2%]) and white (123 [71.1%]). All patients with UC had
stage 4 disease, and 190 (99.5%) had received prior antican-
cer therapy; 64 (33.5%) had received at least 2 prior regimens,
and 188 (98.4%) had received prior platinum-based treat-
ment. Overall, 182 of 191 patients (95.3%) whose disease had
progressed while receiving or after receiving a platinum-
based therapy or within 12 months of receiving therapy in a
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (hereinafter referred to as sec-
ond-line or greater postplatinum subgroup). The other 9 pa-
tients (4.7%) were either treatment naïve or designated as
first-line patients who had received platinum-based therapy
in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting and whose disease pro-
gressed more than 12 months after the last dose of therapy. At
study entry, 177 of 191 patients (92.7%) had visceral metasta-
ses; 82 of 191 (42.9%), liver metastases; and 14 of 191 (7.3%),
lymph node–only disease; PD-L1 expression was high in 98 of
191 (51.3%), low or negative in 79 of 191 (41.4%), and un-
known in 14 of 191 (7.3%).
Antitumor Activity in the UC Cohort
In the as-treated population (n = 191), the ORR was 17.8% (34
of 191; 95% CI, 12.7%-24.0%), including 7 complete re-
sponses (3.7%; see the eResults and eTable 4 in Supplement 2
for additional details of the complete responses), and was con-
sistent with that seen in the second-line or greater postplati-
num subgroup (32 of 182 [17.6%] [95% CI, 12.3%-23.9%]); ORRs
were 27.6% (n = 27; 95% CI, 19.0%-37.5%) in PD-L1 high pa-
tients and 5.1% (n = 4; 95% CI, 1.4%-12.5%) in PD-L1 low or
negative patients (Table 2). The complete response rates did
not numerically differ by PD-L1 status, and responses in both

 subgroups were durable (Table 2). Objective responses were
observed across all subgroups, including subsets with poor
prognosis: ORRs in patients with visceral metastases and liver
metastases were 15.3% (27 of 177; 95% CI, 10.3%-21.4%) and
7.3% (6 of 82; 95% CI, 2.7%-15.2%), respectively; the ORR in
patients with baseline lymph node–only disease was 50.0% (7
of 14; 95% CI, 23.0%-77.0%).
The disease control rate by blinded independent central
review assessment was 36.6% (95% CI, 29.8%-43.9%) in the
as-treated population and 36.3% (95% CI, 29.3%-43.7%) in the
second-lineorgreaterpostplatinumsubgroup.Thediseasecon-

tive subgroups (44.9% vs 21.5% in the as-treated population;
44.2% vs 20.5% in the second-line or greater postplatinum
population) (Table 2).
Responses occurred early and were durable (Figure 2A).
Median time to response was 1.41 months (range, 1.2-7.2), co-
inciding with the first protocol-specified imaging assess-
ment. Time to response did not numerically differ by PD-L1
expression status and was similar in the second-line or greater
postplatinum subgroup (data not shown). Median duration of
response in the as-treated population had not been reached
at data cutoff (range, ≥0.9 to ≥19.9 months). Seventeen of 34
responders (50.0%) had a response lasting at least 6 months
(Figure 2A, Table 2), and 26 (76.5%) had an ongoing response
at data cutoff (see the eResults in Supplement 2 for additional
details regarding patients without an ongoing response at data
cutoff).
Among the 159 patients with target lesions at baseline and
at least 1 postbaseline scan, 51 (32.1%) experienced a target le-
sion reduction of at least 30% from baseline (Figure 2B). Tu-
mor shrinkage and deep durable changes were seen in both
PD-L1 subgroups (Figure 2B; eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Survival in the UC Cohort
Given limited follow-up, OS data were considered immature
at data cutoff. The median PFS was 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.4-
1.9) in the as-treated population and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.4-
2.8) and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.3-1.5) in PD-L1 high and low or
negative patients, respectively. The PFS rates at 6, 9, and 12
months were 22% (95% CI, 16%-28%), 18% (95% CI, 12%-
25%), and 16% (95% CI, 10%-23%), respectively, in the as-
treated population (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). The median
OS was 18.2 months (95% CI, 8.1 to not estimable) in the as-
treated population and 20.0 months (95% CI, 11.6 to not esti-
mable) and 8.1 months (95% CI, 3.1 to not estimable) in PD-L1

OS rates at 6, 9, and 12 months were 64% (95% CI, 56%-71%),
57% (95% CI, 47%-66%), and 55% (95% CI, 44%- 65%), respec-
tively, in the as-treated population (Figure 2C).
Safety in the UC Cohort
Any-grade treatment-related AEs were reported in 60.7%
(Table 3). With a median time to onset of 6.1 weeks (range, 4.1-
10.1weeks),thecumulativeincidenceoftreatment-relatedAEs
occurred early, was highest during the first 8 weeks, and sub-
sequently seemed to plateau at around 32 weeks (eFigure 3 in
Supplement 2). The most common AEs were fatigue (19.4%),
decreased appetite (9.4%), diarrhea (8.4%), and rash (7.3%).
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 6.8% (Table 3).
Treatment-related AEs leading to death occurred in 2 of
191 patients (1.0%), 1 each due to autoimmune hepatitis (in a
man in his 70s with no history of autoimmune disease, liver
disease, or liver abnormalities, but who had elevated liver en-
zyme levels at baseline prior to dosing) and pneumonitis (in a
man in his 50s with a history of untreated grade 1 dyspnea and
remote tobacco use); see the eResults in Supplement 2 for ad-
ditional details regarding the treatments and events that led
to both deaths. There were no clinically meaningful differ-
ences in AE rates between PD-L1 high and low or negative sub-
groups (data not shown). Serious treatment-related AEs were
reported in 4.7%. Autoimmune hepatitis occurred in 2 pa-
tients, whereas other serious AEs only occurred in 1 patient
each. Treatment-related AEs required infusion interruption or

 dose delay in 11.0% and led to permanent treatment discon-
tinuation in 3 patients (1.6%), including the 2 patients with
imAEs that led to death.
Any-grade treatment-related AESIs occurred in 34.6%,
most of which were grade 1 or 2 (eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement
2); their cumulative incidence seemed to plateau at around 32
weeks (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2); 4.7% experienced treat-
ment-related grade 3/4 AESIs. Within this population, imAEs
occurred in 11.5%; most had grade 1 or 2 events (eTable 3 in
Supplement 2). The most common imAEs were hypothyroid-
ism (5.2%), diarrhea (2.1%), and selected hepatic events
(2.1%; including increased aspartate aminotransferase level,
increased alanine aminotransferase level, increased transami-
nase levels, and autoimmune hepatitis). Grade 3 or 4 imAEs
occurred in 4 patients (2.1%) and were reported in the catego-
ries of selected hepatic events (1.0%), and rash and selected
renalevents(0.5%each).Amongpatientswithany-gradetreat-
ment-related AESIs, 7.3% were administered concomitant sys-
temic steroids.
Safety in the Overall Population Receiving Durvalumab,
10 mg/kg Q2W
The types and frequencies of any-grade and grade 3 or 4 treat-
ment-related AEs in all patients who received durvalumab,
10 mg/kg Q2W (ie, patients with any solid tumor; n = 970),
were similar to those of patients with UC (Table 3). In addi-
tion, time to onset of treatment-related AEs was similar (8.1
weeks; range, 6.1-10.1 weeks) and the cumulative incidences
of treatment-related AEs and AESIs also seemed to be high-
est during the first 8 weeks, plateauing at around 32 weeks
(eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). See the eResults in Supplement
2 for further details regarding the safety of durvalumab in
this population.
Discussion
Durvalumab, 10 mg/kg Q2W, showed compelling clinical ac-
tivity in the as-treated population with UC based on ORR
(17.8%), disease control rate (36.6%), and median OS (18.2
months[95%CI,8.1tonotestimable]),whichispromisingcom-
pared with the median OS of historical controls.1 Responses
were early, durable, and observed regardless of PD-L1 expres-
sion. The onset of AEs was characterized as occurring fairly
early and then plateauing after approximately 32 weeks. These
outcomes are notable for a population comprised mainly of
heavily pretreated patients, including those with poor prog-
noses (visceral and liver metastases). These results build on
previous findings from this study16 and represent one of the
first studies to test response durability following 12 months of
PD-L1 inhibition in patients with UC. This study limited treat-
ment to 1 year. Although patients who had responded contin-
ued to respond after 1 year of treatment, it is unclear if
continuous suppression of tumor defense is needed. Future
studies randomizing patients to continuous vs limited therapy
may be warranted to understand this further.

tients in the UC cohort (n = 191), 17.8% (95% CI, 12.7%-

 24.0%), was lower than that reported previously for the
interim analysis (n = 61), 31.0% (95% CI, 17.6%-47.1%).16
However, the 95% CIs overlap, and such findings are not
unexpected. Reduced ORR from one clinical development
phase to the next has been observed in studies of other
immunotherapies (eg, for the anti-PD-L1 antibody
atezolizumab).11,12
Durvalumab, 10 mg/kg Q2W, was well tolerated in pa-
tients with locally advanced/metastatic UC (n = 191). Treat-
ment-related AEs were mostly grade 1 or 2, with cumulative
incidences plateauing after early onset; only 6.8% had grade
3 or 4 AEs. The incidences of treatment-related SAEs (4.7%),
treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (1.6%), and
imAEs (11.5%) were also low; imAEs were mostly grade 1 or 2;
only 2 patients discontinued treatment owing to imAEs. Only
7.3% with treatment-related AESIs were concomitantly ad-
ministered systemic steroids.
Cross-trialcomparisoncanbeconfounding;however,these
safety results are compelling when indirectly compared with
other trials in this setting. The rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-
related AEs and discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs
with durvalumab are favorable compared with those related
to other agents.7,8,10,11,13,14 Each antibody is structurally unique
and potentially generates different host immune responses,
and, while the most likely explanation for observed differ-
ences are study design, patient population, reporting, and du-
ration of follow-up, potentially different safety signals be-
tween these agents cannot be excluded.
Similarly, durvalumab, 10 mg/kg Q2W, was well tolerated
in patients with any solid tumor, comprising the overall popu-
lation (n = 970). Only 2.8% discontinued this therapy owing
to treatment-related AEs; imAEs occurred in 11.5%, systemic
steroids were concomitantly administered to 6.2% with treat-
ment-related AESIs, and 0.4% had treatment-related AEs lead-
ing to death. Finally, while the frequencies of AEs and AESIs
are widely reported, the timing of their onset has not, to our
knowledge, been studied in detail. The work presented herein
shows that the frequency is highest during the first 8 weeks,
with a plateau occurring by week 32. In addition, onset of AEs
and AESIs runs in parallel over time.
Limitations
Notwithstanding inherent limitations of cross-trial compari-
sons,theantitumoractivityofdurvalumabwasconsistentwith
thoseofother,previouslystudiedimmunotherapies.7,8,10,11,13,14
In addition, despite different methodologies, most of these
studies also showed better outcomes in PD-L1 high patients.
Although clinical activity with durvalumab was observed in
both PD-L1 high and low or negative patients, ORR was
numerically higher in PD-L1 high patients. The combined

 algorithm therefore supports the effectiveness of the
VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay to identify patients most likely
torespondtodurvalumab,asinternallyvalidatedusingthefirst
20 enrolled patients to establish the algorithm and the remain-
ing patients in the UC cohort to validate the approach (data not
shown); however, external validation is warranted before this
approach can be used extensively. In addition, this aligns with
the biology of response to immunotherapy and is consistent
with external UC data, since PD-L1 expression on either TCs
or tumor-associated immune cells can inhibit antitumor im-
munity. However, while optimal, this approach does not
completely exclude patients who may respond. The high
negative predictive value of the assay (94.9%) may be espe-
cially helpful in educating patients on the likelihood of
response to durvalumab; however, it should not be used to
exclude patients from therapy, especially because there is
no single standard of care in the second-line or greater UC
setting, such that some PD-L1 low or negative patients may
be better candidates for single-agent durvalumab vs com-
monly used chemotherapy.
Conclusions
This study supports the manageable safety and tolerability
of durvalumab, 10 mg/kg Q2W, as monotherapy in patients
with solid tumors and confirms its favorable clinical activity
in previously treated patients with locally advanced/
metastatic UC for whom prognosis is poor. Based on these
findings, durvalumab seems to be an attractive alternative
to chemotherapy, irrespective of biomarker status. Further
UC studies, including DANUBE (NCT02516241), BISCAY
(NCT02546661), and Study 10 (NCT02261220), are evaluating
durvalumab as monotherapy and in combination with other
agents (tremelimumab, AZD4547, olaparib, AZD1775, and
vistusertib). In conclusion, these are the most robust and
encouraging safety data yet reported for durvalumab in locally
advanced/metastatic UC and, together with the efficacy data,
have formed the basis for its recent regulatory approval and
positioning as a standard of care (alongside atezolizumab and
nivolumab) in this setting.
