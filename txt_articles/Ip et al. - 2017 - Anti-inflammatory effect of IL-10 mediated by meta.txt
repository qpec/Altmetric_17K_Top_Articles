Abstract
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in the control of 
immune responses. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we show 
that IL-10 opposes the switch to the metabolic program induced by inflammatory stimuli in 
macrophages. Specifically, we show that IL-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced glucose uptake 
and glycolysis and promotes oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, IL-10 suppresses 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity through the induction of an mTOR inhibitor, 
DDIT4. Consequently, IL-10 promotes mitophagy that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria 
characterized by low membrane potential and a high level of reactive oxygen species. In the 
absence of IL-10 signaling, macrophages accumulate damaged mitochondria in a mouse model of 
colitis and inflammatory bowel disease patients, and this results in dysregulated activation of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-1β.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by activated immune 
cells (1). Although most hematopoietic cells sense IL-10 via expression of IL-10 receptor 
(IL-10R), recent studies have shown that macrophages are the main target cells of the 
inhibitory IL-10 effects (2, 3). Polymorphisms in the Il10 locus confer risk for inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (4, 5), and mice and 
humans deficient in either IL-10 or IL-10R exhibit severe intestinal inflammation (2,3,6, 7), 
indicating that the IL-10-IL10R axis plays an essential role in regulation of intestinal tissue 
homeostasis and prevention of IBD. Little is known about the molecular basis of the anti-
inflammatory activities of IL-10 (8). Understanding the role of IL-10 in the regulation of 
metabolic processes is essential both for deciphering how IL-10 acts to control inflammatory

 responses and for discovering key molecular regulators controlling processes involved in 
resolution of inflammation.
Inflammatory response is generally triggered by receptors of the innate immune system, 
such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (9). The initial recognition of infection is mediated 
mainly by tissue-resident macrophages, which lead to the production of inflammatory 
mediators. Recent studies of cellular metabolism in macrophages have shown profound 
alterations in metabolic profiles during macrophage activation (10–12). For example, 
macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) undergo metabolic changes toward 
glycolysis, whereas macrophages activated with IL-4 commit to oxidative phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS) (13, 14), and both suggest that metabolic adaptation during macrophage 
activation is a key component of macrophage polarization, instrumental to their function in 
inflammation and tissue repair.
Results
IL-10–deficient macrophages exhibit altered metabolic profiles after LPS stimulation
We analyzed Il10−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), for changes in the rate 
of extracellular acidification (ECAR), and the mitochondrial rate of oxygen consumption 
(OCR), as a measure of glycolysis and OXPHOS, respectively, after LPS stimulation. Il10−/− 
BMDMs became more glycolytic (i.e., had higher basal ECAR) but less “oxidative” (i.e., 
had lower basal OCR) as compared with wild-type (WT) BMDMs (Fig. 1, A and B). The 
reduced OXPHOS in Il10−/− cells was not due to nitric oxide (NO) production, because 
treatment with inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase failed to rescue the phenotype 
(fig. S1). However, addition of exogenous IL-10 restored the WT phenotype in Il10−/− cells 
(Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the treatment of WT BMDMs with a blocking antibody against 
the IL-10R alpha subunit (IL-10Rα) resulted in altered profiles of ECAR and OCR similar 
to that in Il10−/− cells (fig. S2), indicating an autocrine effect of IL-10 in macrophages. The 
exaggerated glycolysis was also seen in splenic macrophages from Il10−/− mice injected 
intraperitoneally with LPS (fig. S3A). We next assessed the functional profile of 
mitochondria by determining real-time changes in OCR during sequential treatment of cells 
with oligomycin [adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase inhibitor], the cyanide p-
trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) (H+ ionophore), and rotenone (inhibitor of the 
electron-transport chain) (Fig. 1C). The absence of exogenous IL-10 in Il10−/− BMDMs 
after LPS stimulation resulted in a lower maximal respiratory capacity (MRC) compared 
with WT BMDMs (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that the reduced basal OCR 
observed in Il10−/− BMDMs after LPS stimulation could be due to the loss of mitochondrial 
fitness, as indicated by the reduced MRC. Consistent with this idea, basal cellular ATP levels 
were also reduced in Il10−/− BMDMs after LPS stimulation (fig. S4).
IL-10 inhibits glycolytic flux
We next asked whether the inhibition of glycolysis by IL-10 is due to suppression of 
glycolytic flux. Consistent with previous studies (15), glucose uptake increased and reached 
a maximum within 2 hours of LPS stimulation and decreased after 12 hours in WT BMDMs 
(fig. S5A). Glucose uptake was also observed in LPS-stimulated Il10−/− BMDMs at 4 hours

 (Fig. 1E). However, after 12 hours of LPS stimulation in the absence of exogenous IL-10, 
glucose uptake was maintained at higher levels in Il10−/− cells (Fig. 1E), which indicates 
that IL-10 has an inhibitory effect on glucose uptake.
The glucose transporter GLUT1 plays an important role in glucose uptake in macrophages 
during LPS stimulation (15). Indeed, our RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data showed that 
BMDMs predominantly expressed Glut1 at the steady state (fig. S5B). However, the 
expression of Glut1 was not affected by IL-10 (fig. S5C). We therefore asked whether IL-10 
inhibited GLUT1 translocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface, which is a key 
step to facilitate glucose uptake into the cell. To test this, we tracked the cellular localization 
of GLUT1 with an antibody and visualized this through immunofluorescence and 
ImageStream analysis. Both analyses showed that GLUT1 was mainly localized in 
intracellular vesicles at the steady state but translocated to the plasma membrane after LPS 
stimulation (Fig. 1F and fig. S5, D and E). Note that exogenous IL-10 inhibited the GLUT1 
translocation in Il10−/− BMDMs (Fig. 1F and fig. S5D). In addition, RNA-seq analysis in 
Il10−/− BMDMs also revealed that IL-10 inhibited the expression of genes encoding 
enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, including Hk1, Hk3, Pfkp, and Eno2 (fig. S5F). 
Together, these data illustrate that IL-10 inhibits glycolytic flux by means of regulating the 
GLUT1 translocation and the gene expression of glycolytic enzymes.
IL-10 prevents accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria
To investigate whether the altered metabolic profiles of mitochondria described above in 
Il10−/− BMDMs resulted from abnormal mitochondrial function, we first stained cells with 
MitoTracker Green for total mitochondrial content, regardless of mitochondrial membrane 
potential (Δψm), and found that Il10−/− BMDMs had increased mitochondrial mass after 
LPS stimulation, compared with WT macrophages (Fig. 2A). This was not due to increased 
cell size, because Il10−/− cells had a size similar to that of WT cells, but rather was 
correlated with greater intracellular complexity reflected by the side scatter (SSC) signal 
measured by flow cytometry (fig. S6). We then hypothesized that the increase in 
mitochondrial mass in Il10−/− cells could be due to accumulation of dysfunctional 
mitochondria with loss of Δψm. To test this, we used a combination of MitoTracker Green 
(Δψm-independent mitochondrial stain) with MitoTracker Red (Δψm-dependent 
mitochondrial stain) to distinguish between respiring mitochondria and dysfunctional 
mitochondria (16), and we observed an increase in dysfunctional mitochondria (MitoTracker 
Green+high, MitoTracker Red+low) in LPS-stimulated Il10−/− BMDMs (Fig. 2B). This is in 
line with the loss of Δψm observed by using tetramethyl rho-damine methyl ester staining 
(fig. S7). These data suggested that accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria occurred 
during LPS stimulation in the absence of IL-10.
Loss of Δψm is known to be associated with accumulation of mitochondrial ROS (17). We 
therefore examined whether accumulation of Δψmlow mitochondria in Il10−/− BMDMs was 
associated with production of mitochondrial ROS. To assess ROS levels in the mitochondria, 
we used the mitochondria-specific ROS indicator MitoSOX to selectively detect superoxide 
in the mitochondria of live cells. We found that MitoSOX fluorescence was enhanced in 
LPS-stimulated Il10−/− macrophages in the absence of exogenous IL-10 (Fig. 2C) and

 correlated with total mitochondrial mass as indicated by MitoTracker Green staining (Fig. 
2D), and these findings suggest that the absence of IL-10 leads to ROS production from 
accumulated mitochondria. The accumulation of ROS-producing mitochondria in Il10−/− 
cells was also visualized by live-cell imaging using both fluorescent dyes (Fig. 2E). 
Furthermore, the ROS production in Il10−/− macrophages was of mitochondrial origin as it 
could be blocked by treatment with inhibitors of mitochondrial complex II (fig. S8).
IL-10 promotes the induction of autophagy
We hypothesized that the accumulation of dysfunctional and ROS-producing mitochondria 
could be the result of impaired mitophagy in Il10−/− cells after LPS stimulation. To detect 
mitophagy, we overexpressed mitochondrial targeting fusion protein (Mito-DsRed) in 
BMDMs generated from LC3-GFP transgenic (tg) mice that expressed green fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-tagged LC3 (18) and observed increased recruitment of LC3-GFP to Mito-
DsRed+ mitochondria in LPS-stimulated cells (fig. S9), suggesting an induction of 
mitophagy during LPS stimulation. To determine more precisely the role of IL-10 in 
mitophagy, we crossed LC3-GFP transgenic mice with Il10−/− mice and generated Il10−/− 
LC3-GFP BMDMs. Autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-GFP puncta formation after 
LPS stimulation as illustrated in Fig. 2F. As expected, regardless of IL-10 deficiency, both 
Il10+/− and Il10−/− BMDMs with LC3-GFP had increased formation of LC3 puncta after 
treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which is known to induce autophagy (Fig. 
2G). However, in the absence of exogenous IL-10, Il10−/− LC3-GFP cells had significantly 
lower LC3 puncta formation after LPS stimulation as compared with control cells (i.e., 
Il10+/−) (Fig. 2G), suggesting an induction of mitophagy by IL-10 in macrophages after LPS 
stimulation. Consistent with this idea, BMDMs lacking Atg5 also exhibited a significantly 
altered metabolic profile in OCR (Fig. 2H). However, unlike in Il10−/− BMDMs, addition of 
exogenous IL-10 failed to restore WT phenotypes in Atg5-deficient cells (Fig. 2H), 
suggesting that the effect of IL-10 on mitochondrial functions is largely, but perhaps not 
exclusively, autophagy-dependent.
IL-10 maintains mitochondrial integrity and function via inhibition of mTOR
mTOR is a key metabolic regulator, and the activation of mTORC1 controls glucose and 
lipid metabolism and inhibits autophagy (19). Given the observed effects of IL-10 on 
mitophagy, we examined whether IL-10 regulates the activity of the mTORC1 pathway. In 
support of the idea that mTORC1 might coordinate metabolic changes during macrophage 
activation, stimulation of WT BMDMs with LPS resulted in mTORC1 activation above the 
basal level, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of the downstream targets such as 
S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1, which reached maximal levels in 2 hours and was strongly suppressed 
after 6 hours (Fig. 3A). This tightly regulated mTORC1 activation was impaired in Il10−/− 
BMDMs where higher and prolonged activation was observed during LPS stimulation (Fig. 
3A). Addition of exogenous IL-10 to these cells was again able to restore the regulation 
observed in WT cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, prolonged mTORC1 activation was also 
observed in BMDMs lacking STAT3, a key transcription factor downstream of IL-10R 
signaling, and it was not rescued by adding exogenous IL-10 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest 
that IL-10 signaling via STAT3 inhibits mTORC1 activation. In addition, IL-10 inhibited the 
phosphorylation of Akt targets proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) and mTOR

 and, consistent with a previous report (20), IL-10 increased phosphorylation of adenosine 
5′-monophosphate–activated kinase (AMPK) (fig. S10).
We next tested whether the inhibition of mTOR by IL-10 was responsible for maintaining 
mitochondrial integrity and function during LPS stimulation, which otherwise could lead to 
accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria as seen in Il10−/− BMDMs. We treated Il10−/− 
BMDMs with rapamycin to directly inhibit mTOR during LPS stimulation and assessed 
their mitochondrial content and oxygen consumption. The effect of rapamycin treatment was 
similar to that with exogenous IL-10 in which it inhibited accumulation of dysfunctional 
mitochondria with loss of Δψm (Fig. 3C) and enhanced basal respiration and MRC (Fig. 3, 
D and E) in Il10−/− cells. In addition, rapamycin treatment also reduced ECAR in Il10−/− 
cells during LPS stimulation (fig. S11A), and this suggests that IL-10 suppresses glycolysis 
via inhibiting mTOR, although IL-10 might also act through an unknown process to regulate 
GLUT1 translocation (fig. S11B).
Induction of DDIT4 by IL-10 inhibits mTOR signaling
We next sought to define how IL-10 inhibits mTOR signaling. Because the inhibition is 
STAT3-dependent (Fig. 3B), the mechanism should require transcription. Therefore, we 
performed RNA-seq analysis and examined if IL-10 transcriptionally regulates metabolic 
pathways, which would lead to the inhibition of mTOR signaling. It is noteworthy that we 
found that IL-10 regulated a subset of genes known to participate in the upstream signaling 
of mTORC1 (fig. S12, A and B). The regulation of these genes might have collective effects 
on suppressing mTOR signaling (fig. S12C). However, the abundant and stable protein 
levels of their gene products in BMDMs before and after LPS stimulation (as shown in fig. 
S12D) lead us to hypothesize that the inhibition of mTOR signaling by IL-10 could be 
mediated via an active suppression by negative regulators. We therefore focused on known 
negative regulators of mTOR signaling (21–25) and examined their gene expression. Among 
those genes, we found that Ddit4 was strongly induced by IL-10 during LPS stimulation 
(Fig. 3, F and G, and fig. S13). This up-regulation was also confirmed at the protein level 
(Fig. 3H), and it required the transcription factor STAT3 (Fig. 3G) but not the hypoxia-
inducible factor HIF-1α (data not shown), a known regulator of Ddit4 in response to 
hypoxia (26).
To assess the role of DDIT4 in macrophages, we generated BMDMs from Ddit4−/− mice and 
stimulated them with LPS. Cells lacking DDIT4 had prolonged mTORC1 activation during 
LPS stimulation (fig. S14A), a phenotype similar to that we observed in Il10−/− BMDMs. 
However, unlike in WT cells, treatment with exogenous IL-10 failed to inhibit mTORC1 
activation in Ddit4−/− cells (Fig. 3I), and this suggests that the inhibition of mTOR signaling 
by IL-10 is DDIT4-dependent. Furthermore, similar to cells lacking IL-10 signaling (i.e., 
treatment with IL-10Rα blocking antibody), Ddit4−/− BMDMs exhibited a significant 
alteration in the profiles for ECAR and OCR (Fig. 3J) and accumulated dysfunctional 
mitochondria with loss of Δψm and with enhanced ROS production after LPS stimulation 
(Fig. 3, K and L). Treatment with exogenous IL-10 had minimal effect on reversing the 
phenotypes, and this indicated that DDIT4 is a critical target of IL-10 signaling. Together, 
these observations suggest that the inhibition of mTOR signaling by IL-10 via DDIT4 plays

 an essential role in mitochondrial clearance in macrophages after LPS stimulation. In line 
with this idea, overexpression of DDIT4 in Il10−/− BMDMs was able to restore the 
inhibitions of mTOR signaling and accumulation of damaged mitochondria (fig. S14, B to 
E).
IL-10 negatively regulates inflammasome activation via inhibition of mTOR
We next assessed the roles of metabolic control by IL-10 in inflammatory responses. 
Mitochondria have emerged as signaling organelles that contribute to certain innate immune 
pathways, including inflammasome activation and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling (17). 
We utilized a two-signal model for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, where BMDMs were 
primed with LPS (signal 1) and then stimulated with ATP (signal 2). We found that both 
Il10−/− and Ddit4−/− BMDMs exhibited enhanced caspase-1 cleavage, and treatment of 
Il10−/− cells, but not Ddit4−/− cells, with IL-10 resulted in minimal caspase-1 cleavage (Fig. 
4A and fig. S15A), suggesting that IL-10 inhibits caspase-1-dependent inflammasome 
activation via induction of DDIT4. Even in the absence of signal 2 (i.e., ATP), stimulation 
with LPS in cells lacking IL-10 or STAT3 was sufficient to trigger IL-1β secretion, which 
otherwise was minimal in WT cells (Fig. 4, B and D). The secretion of IL-1β was caspase-1-
dependent (Fig. 4B), indicating that the IL-1β secretion in Il10−/− BMDMs was due to 
inflammasome activation. In addition, IL-10 inhibited inflammasome activation 
independently of any effect on Nlrp3 transcription, as overexpression of NLRP3 did not 
overcome the inhibition (fig. S15B). We then hypothesized that enhanced mitochondrial 
ROS production in Il10−/− cells might serve as an endogenous signal 2 for inflammasome 
activation. In support of this, treatment of Il10−/− cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC) or mitochondrial ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO was able to inhibit the IL-1β secretion 
(Fig. 4C). The effect of the ROS inhibitor on inflammasome activation rather than 
expression of pro-IL-1β was also confirmed in Il10−/− cells overexpressing pro-IL-1β where 
IL-1bβ secretion was inhibited by antioxidants (fig. S15C). Consistent with this, Mito-
TEMPO had no effect on gene expression of pro-IL-1β in Il10−/− cells during LPS 
stimulation (fig. S16).
We next tested if treatment with rapamycin, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, or the autophagy 
activator AICAR or overexpression of DDIT4 has any impact on the aberrant IL-1β 
secretion in Il10−/− cells. IL-1β secretion was inhibited by rapamycin and AICAR but 
enhanced by 3-MA in cells lacking IL-10 or STAT3 (Fig. 4D and figs. S14F and S15D) or 
Il10−/− cells overexpressing pro-IL-1β (fig. S15C). Autophagy is known to inhibit 
inflammasome activation (27). Collectively, these data suggest that the induction of 
mitophagy by IL-10 via inhibition of mTOR contributes to the suppression of inflammasome 
activation. In agreement with this, the effect of IL-10 on inhibiting IL-1β secretion was 
significantly reduced in Atg5-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 4E). Because autophagy deficiency 
can lead to ROS-dependent amplification of RLR signaling (16), we also tested whether 
IL-10 inhibits RLR signaling. Indeed, Il10−/− BMDMs stimulated with poly(I:C) complexed 
to lipofect-amine exhibited enhanced type I interferon response, and treatment with NAC or 
exogenous IL-10 inhibited the enhanced response (fig. S17, A to C).

 Aberrant activation of macrophage inflammasome in IL-10–deficient mice and IL-10R–
deficient IBD patients
We have previously shown that gut bacteria sensing through MyD88 in intestinal 
macrophages drive colitis in IL-10-deficient mice (28). To test our current model in vivo, we 
isolated colonic lamina propria cells from Il10−/− mice with severe colitis and assessed 
mitochondrial content and mTOR signaling in lamina propria macrophages (LPMs). Similar 
to LPS-stimulated Il10−/− BMDMs, LPMs from Il10−/− mice had higher mitochondrial ROS, 
accumulated mitochondria with loss of Δψm (Fig. 4F), and increased activation of mTORC1 
(Fig. 4G); these findings suggest that, in the absence of IL-10, mitochondrial ROS 
production due to increased mTOR signaling in LPMs contributes to the development of 
colitis via inflammasome activation. Consistent with this idea, mice lacking both IL-10 and 
caspase-1 had significantly reduced pathology of colitis compared with mice lacking IL-10 
only (Fig. 4H and fig. S15, E to G). Finally, we found that monocyte-derived macrophages 
from IBD patients with a null mutation in the IL-10R gene also exhibited aberrant secretion 
of IL-1β (Fig. 4I), reduced DDIT4 expression, and prolonged mTORC1 activation (Fig. 4J). 
Furthermore, inhibition of ROS or mTOR signaling by antioxidants or rapamycin, 
respectively, suppressed IL-1β secretion in these cells (Fig. 4K). Collectively, these data 
suggest that IL-10 prevents development of colitis, at least in part, through inhibition of 
mTOR signaling and inflammasome activation in macrophages via elimination of 
dysfunctional mitochondria.
Discussion
Macrophage activation is a key event in the inflammatory response. Activated macrophages 
undergo profound reprogramming of their cellular metabolism. Here we provide evidence 
for IL-10-dependent regulation of metabolic processes in activated macrophages and suggest 
that IL-10 acts to inhibit inflammatory responses in part by controlling essential metabolic 
pathways, including mTOR signaling.
The importance of glycolysis in the inflammatory response of macrophages has been 
demonstrated in a previous study, where inhibition of glycolysis using 2-deoxyglucose 
decreases the inflammatory response (29). Our data showing the inhibition of glycolysis by 
IL-10 by suppression of glucose uptake and glycolytic gene expression suggest that IL-10 
might act to reverse the metabolic program associated with the inflammatory response. This 
is consistent with the anti-inflammatory function of IL-10 and also in line with observations 
from T cells, where glycolysis is needed for T helper cell TH17 function (the inflammatory 
lymphocyte), but if this is blocked, then the T cells become anti-inflammatory regulatory T 
cells (30).
Mitochondria have emerged as central organelles that integrate metabolism and 
inflammatory responses. Here we show that, upon LPS activation, IL-10-deficient 
macrophages had further reduced OXPHOS as compared with the already reduced OXPHOS 
in control macrophages. Although this could be due to excessive production of NO in IL-10-
deficient cells, because NO is known to inhibit OXPHOS (31, 32), our analysis using 
treatment with inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitors shows a NO-independent effect of 
IL-10 on OXPHOS (fig. S1). Rather, our findings showing that IL-10 promotes the induction

 of mitophagy suggest that IL-10 plays a more direct role in maintaining mitochondrial 
fitness, which is key to preserving respiratory capacity. In addition, IL-10 signaling via 
STAT3 may have a direct effect on improving mitochondrial function, as it has been shown 
previously that activated STAT3 is present in mitochondria and is required for optimal 
function of the electron transport chain (33).
It is increasingly recognized that mTOR acts as a central regulator of cellular metabolism 
(34). Here we show that IL-10 inhibits mTORC1 activation via STAT3; this suggests that 
IL-10 controls metabolic processes via engaging the regulation of mTOR signaling. These 
findings support our observations described above in several ways. First, mTOR signaling is 
critical to mediate the switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis several hours after TLR 
stimulation at least in myeloid dendritic cells (35,36). This is in line with our data showing 
an exaggerated switching from OXPHOS to glycolysis in IL-10-deficient macrophages 12 
hours after LPS activation, where the inhibition of mTORC1 activation by IL-10 is impaired. 
Second, the inhibition of mTORC1 is known to strongly induce autophagy, suggesting a 
likely mechanism for induction of mitophagy by IL-10. Third, it has also been shown that 
mTORC1 activation potentiates the expression of IL-10 (37). Our data therefore suggest a 
negative-feedback loop for the mTORC1 pathway, where production of IL-10 leads to the 
suppression of mTORC1 activation, resulting in the shutdown of signaling after 6 hours of 
LPS activation, as seen in control macrophages we observed. It remains to be addressed if 
IL-10 also controls other metabolic processes associated with macrophage activation via 
inhibiting the mTOR network.
Among various upstream negative regulators of mTORC1 that have been identified, we 
demonstrate that the expression of DDIT4 is strongly up-regulated by IL-10 during 
macrophage activation and that the IL-10-STAT3-DDIT4 axis is important for the inhibition 
of mTORC1 and the maintenance of overall mitochondrial integrity during macrophage 
activation by LPS. To inhibit mTOR, DDIT4 interacts with other proteins involved in mTOR 
signaling, such as 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate the tumor suppressor complex (38), or 
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates and thus inactivates Akt (39). In 
line with the latter mechanism, we also find that IL-10 inhibits phosphorylation of Akt target 
proteins, such as PRAS40 and mTOR. Furthermore, activation of AMPK by IL-10 as shown 
here and in a previous study (20) is also likely to contribute to the inhibition of mTOR.
In conclusion, our study reveals a key role of IL-10 in controlling cellular metabolism via 
inhibiting mTORC1. We propose that this metabolic control by IL-10 is critical to control of 
inflammation. Defects in this regulation (i.e., enhanced or prolonged mTORC1 activation) 
can result in abnormal metabolic changes (e.g., exaggerated glycolysis) and loss of 
mitochondrial integrity, as seen in activated macrophages from IL-10- deficient mice with 
spontaneous colitis or IBD patients with null mutation in IL-10R genes, which have 
increased inflammatory responses. Note that the aberrant inflammasome activation by 
mitochondrial ROS due to loss of mitochondrial integrity in macrophages devoid of IL-10 
signaling has a significant contribution to severe intestinal inflammation in IBD. Therapeutic 
targeting of the mTORC1 pathway in macrophages therefore could be beneficial for 
treatment or prevention of inflammatory diseases.

 Fig. 1. IL-10 regulates glycolysis and mitochondrial function in BMDMs on LPS stimulation.
WT or Il10−/− BMDMs were stimulated without (control) or with LPS in the presence or 
absence of IL-10 for indicated times. (A and B) ECAR and OCR in BMDMs as assessed by 
Seahorse assay. (C) Real-time changes in the OCR of BMDMs after treatment with 
oligomycin (Oligo), FCCP, and rotenone (Rot). MRC, maximal respiratory capacity (double-
headed arrow), is shown for the control in WT BMDMs. (D) Maximal respiratory capacity 
of BMDMs measured by real-time changes in OCR. (E) Glucose uptake of BMDMs 
determined by direct incubation with 2-NBDG (a fluorescent D-glucose analog) for 2 hours, 
followed by fluorescence detection. (F) Quantification of GLUT1 plasma membrane 
translocation using ImageStream. Percentage of cells with GLUT1 cell surface translocation 
was determined by colocalized GLUT1 (green) and CD11b (red) as shown in the 
representative images (see fig. S5E). All values are means ± SD of at least three independent 
experiments. Student’s t test (unpaired); *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

 Fig. 2. IL-10 prevents accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and production of 
mitochondrial ROS via the induction of mitophagy.
(A to E) WT or Il10−/− BMDMs stimulated without (control) or with LPS in the presence or 
absence of IL-10 for 24 hours. Total mitochondrial mass was analyzed by flow cytometry in 
cells labeled with MitoTracker Green (A). Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and 
ROS were analyzed in cells labeled with MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Red (B), or 
with MitoSOX (C) and (D), respectively. Representative microscopic images show 
mitochondrial ROS production in Il10−/− BMDMs labeled with MitoTracker Green and 
MitoSOX (E). Scale bars, 10 μm. (F and G) Quantification of LC3-GFP punctate formation 
in IL-10–sufficient (Il10+/−) or –deficient (Il10−/−) LC3-GFP tg BMDMs stimulated as in 
(A) or with rapamycin for 6 hours. Representative microscopic images show LC3-GFP 
punctate in higher magnification of the indicated area (box) (F). Quantification based on 
counting LC3-GFP punctate per cell in the field of view (G). (H) OCR in BMDMs 
generated from Atg5flox/flox (Atg5WT) or Atg5flox/flox LysM-Cre (Atg5M–KO) mice and 
stimulated as in (A) for the indicated times. All values are means ± SD of at least three 
independent experiments. Student’s t test (unpaired); *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

 Fig. 3. Induction of DDIT4 by IL-10 inhibits mTOR signaling and maintains mitochondrial 
fitness.
BMDMs of the indicated strains were stimulated without (control) or with LPS in the 
presence or absence of IL-10, rapamycin, or antibody against IL-10Rα (anti-IL-10R) for 24 
hours or the indicated times. (A and B) Comparison of mTORC1 activation in WT and 
Il10−/− BMDMs (A) or Stat3flox/flox (Stat3WT) and Stat3flox/flox LysM-Cre (Stat3M–KO) 
BMDMs (B) was analyzed by Western blotting. (C) Mitochondrial membrane potential 
(Δψm) was analyzed in Il10−/− BMDMs labeled with MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker 
Red. (D) Real-time changes in the OCR of Il10−/− BMDMs after treatment with oligomycin, 
FCCP, and rotenone were assessed by Seahorse assay. MRC, maximal respiratory capacity 
(double-headed arrow), is shown for rapamycintreated Il10−/− BMDMs at 12 hours. (E) 
Basal respiration and maximal respiratory piratory capacity of Il10−/− BMDMs, measured 
by real-time changes in OCR. (F) Heat map showing RNA-seq data, log2 (fold change) of a 
selected subset of genes encoding negative regulators of mTORC1 activation in Il10−/− 
BMDMs. (G) Induction of Ddit4 mRNA expression by IL-10 in Il10−/− or Stat3M–KO 
BMDMs was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Data are expressed as fold change. (H) 
Induction of DDIT4 protein expression by IL-10 in Il10−/− BMDMs. (I) Comparison of 
mTORC1 activation in WT and Ddit4−/− BMDMs. (J) ECAR and OCR in WT and Ddit4−/
− BMDMs. (K and L) Δψm and mitochondrial ROS were analyzed in WT and Ddit4−/− 
BMDMs labeled with MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Red (K) or with MitoSOX (L). 
All values are means ± SD of at least three independent experiments. Student’s t test 
(unpaired); **P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. *** P < 0.001.

 Fig. 4. Aberrant activation of inflammasome via mTOR signaling and mitochondrial ROS 
production in macrophages from IL-10–deficient mice and IBD patients with loss of IL-10R 
signaling.
(A) The cleavage of caspase-1 to its active p10 subunit in WT, Ddit4−/−, or Il10−/− BMDMs 
primed with LPS for 12 hours and stimulated with ATP for 30 min. (B to E) IL-1β secretion 
by BMDMs of the indicated strains stimulated without (control) or with LPS in the absence 
or presence of IL-10, NAC, Mito-TEMPO, rapamycin, or 3-MA for 24 hours was measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. (F and G) 
Mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and phosphorylation of 
4EB-P1 in colonic lamina propria cells, isolated from WT or Il10−/− mice and labeled with 
MitoSOX [(F) left] or with MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Red [(F) right] or stained 
intracellularly for phosphorylated 4EB-P1 (G) were analyzed by flow cytometry gated on 
CD11b+ for lamina propria macrophages (LPMs). (H) Representative 
immunohistochemistry images of hematoxylin and eosin staining in middle-colon tissue 
from the indicated mouse strains. Scale bar, 200 μm. (I) IL-1β secretion by monocytederived 
macrophages (MDMs) from IL-10R–deficient patients versus healthy subjects, stimulated 
without (control) or with LPS in the absence or presence of IL-10 or antibody against 
IL-10Rα (anti-IL-10R) for 24 hours. (J) Comparison of DDIT4 expression and mTORC1 
activation in MDMs from IL-10R–deficient patients versus healthy subjects was analyzed by 
Western blotting. MDMs were stimulated as in (I) for the indicated times. (K) The effect of 
inhibition of ROS and mTORC1 on IL-1β secretion by MDMs from IL-10R–deficient 
patients and stimulated as in (I) in the absence or presence of ebselen or rapamycin for 24
