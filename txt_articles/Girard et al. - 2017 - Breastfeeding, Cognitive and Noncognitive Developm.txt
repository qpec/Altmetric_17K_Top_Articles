BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is mixed evidence from correlational studies that 
breastfeeding impacts children’s development. Propensity score matching with large 
samples can be an effective tool to remove potential bias from observed confounders in 
correlational studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of breastfeeding 
on children’s cognitive and noncognitive development at 3 and 5 years of age.
METHODS: Participants included ∼8000 families from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal 
infant cohort, who were identified from the Child Benefit Register and randomly selected 
to participate. Parent and teacher reports and standardized assessments were used to 
collect information on children’s problem behaviors, expressive vocabulary, and cognitive 
abilities at age 3 and 5 years. Breastfeeding information was collected via maternal report. 
Propensity score matching was used to compare the average treatment effects on those 
who were breastfed.
RESULTS: Before matching, breastfeeding was associated with better development on 
almost every outcome. After matching and adjustment for multiple testing, only 1 of the 
13 outcomes remained statistically significant: children’s hyperactivity (difference score, 
–0.84; 95% confidence interval, –1.33 to –0.35) at age 3 years for children who were 
breastfed for at least 6 months. No statistically significant differences were observed 
postmatching on any outcome at age 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Although 1 positive benefit of breastfeeding was found by using propensity 
score matching, the effect size was modest in practical terms. No support was found for 
statistically significant gains at age 5 years, suggesting that the earlier observed benefit 
from breastfeeding may not be maintained once children enter school.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The medical 
benefi
 ts of breastfeeding for mother and child 
are considered numerous, yet the effect of 
breastfeeding on cognitive abilities remains largely 
debated given selection into breastfeeding. The 
effect on behavior is even less well understood.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In applying quasi-
experimental techniques which mimic random 
assignment, this study supports limited positive 
impacts of breastfeeding for children’s cognitive and 
noncognitive development. Although signifi
 cant, the 
effect of breastfeeding on noncognitive development 
is small in practical terms.

The medical benefits of breastfeeding 
for both mother and child are 
considered numerous and well 
documented. 
1 
 
 
–5 Yet the effect of 
breastfeeding on general cognitive 
abilities has been a topic of debate 
for nearly a century. 
6 The mechanism 
argued to be responsible for these 
effects is the nutrients found in 
breast milk. 
7, 
 
8 Two specific types 
of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, namely docosahexaenoic 
(DHA) and arachidonic acid, have 
been implicated in both visual and 
neural development and functioning 
through neural maturation, which is 
important for cognitive abilities, such 
as problem solving. 
9– 
11
The link with nutrients may also 
impact specific cognitive abilities 
like language development. For 
example, language abilities, such as 
vocabulary, are highly dependent 
on working and long-term memory 
given the consolidation and 
retrieval processes needed during 
acquisition. 
12, 
 
13 In rats, deficiency 
of fatty acids, such as DHA, during 
lactation resulted in poor memory 
retention during learning tasks, 
whereas supplementation of 
DHA had reversal effects. 
14 If the 
hypothesized “causal” mechanism of 
superior nutrition in breast milk is 
true, coupled with the specific impact 
of DHA on memory, breastfeeding 
should also impact language 
abilities. To date, ∼20 studies have 
investigated this association and 
all but 1 
15 examined a combined 
measure of language (receptive and 
expressive) or receptive language 
only. There remains debate as to 
whether expressive and receptive 
language in early childhood form 
distinct modalities of language, 
16, 
 
17 raising the question of whether 
breastfeeding would be equally 
beneficial to each modality in the 
case of a 2-factor language model.
Less studied is the impact of 
breastfeeding on behavior. 
Breastfeeding may lead to reduced 
behavioral problems as a result of 
early skin-to-skin contact, which 
helps form a secure mother-infant 
bond. 
18 Any effects of breastfeeding 
on cognitive and language 
development could also prevent the 
development of behavior problems. 
The absence of early behavior 
problems has social, economic, and 
medical value to society through 
reduced prevalence of delinquency, 
incarceration rates, and substance 
abuse, 
 
19 
– 
21 making this an important 
area of research. With few 
exceptions, there remains a dearth 
of high-quality studies examining 
behavior, 
22 
 
– 
25 and among them, 
consensus is not evident.
Without randomization of mothers 
to breastfeeding and formula 
conditions, it is challenging to 
confirm the causal impact of these 
hypotheses. One study randomized 
the provision of a breastfeeding 
intervention, modeled on the Baby-
Friendly Hospital Initiative, and 
found that the children of mothers 
in the intervention group had 
higher intelligence scores compared 
with controls at age 6 years. 
26 The 
strongest effects were for verbal 
intelligence. This study offers the 
best support to date for a causal link 
between breastfeeding and cognitive 
development. However, it is the only 
cluster randomized trial on human 
lactation.
The majority of studies in this field 
are observational, thus the causal 
implications of breastfeeding are 
questionable given the inherent 
difficulty in controlling for selection 
into breastfeeding. For example, 
initial associations with cognitive 
development are often reduced 
after adjustments for confounders, 
such as parental education/IQ (ie, 
from an average 5-point to 3-point 
difference 
27), and, in some cases, 
the associations are no longer 
statistically significant. 
28 A variety 
of observational studies now apply 
quasi-experimental methods to 
better address the issue of selection 
bias, making inroads toward a better 
understanding of potential causal 
paths. The techniques used include 
propensity score matching (PSM), 
instrument variables, and sibling 
pair models. This study uses PSM 
because the sibling pair model limits 
the available pool of participants and 
instrument variables are extremely 
sensitive to the validity of the chosen 
instrumentation, which should be 
associated with the exposure but not 
with the outcome except for via the 
exposure.
Using a large longitudinal population 
sample, we applied PSM, which 
mimics random assignment, 
in an effort to investigate the 
potential impacts of breastfeeding 
on children’s cognitive ability, 
expressive vocabulary, and behavior 
problems. Both breastfeeding 
duration and intensity were 
examined. Significant advantages 
for children who were breastfed, 
after matching, were expected 
for all outcomes. Grounded in the 
recommendations of the World 
Health Organization, 
 
29 it was 
expected that larger effect sizes 
would be observed for children who 
were fully breastfed and for longer 
durations.
METHODS
Participants
Participants included families 
enrolled in the Growing Up in Ireland 
infant cohort. Families with infants 
born between December 2007 and 
May 2008 were identified from the 
Child Benefit Register and randomly 
selected to participate. The overall 
recruitment response rate was 65% 
(N = 11 134). A detailed description 
of the study design can be found 
elsewhere. 
30 We used data collected 
at 9 months and 3 and 5 years of age. 
Only families with complete data for 
all confounders when children were 
9 months and children who were 
born full term were included (N = 
9854; 88.5% of the initial sample). 
Boys represented 50.6% (N = 4991)

of the sample. Attrition across waves 
reduced the sample size to 8715 
children at 3 years and 8032 at 5 
years. Some children had missing 
data on the cognitive and vocabulary 
scales, resulting in 8535 and 8241 
children respectively at age 3 and 
7972 and 7942 children respectively 
at age 5. Additionally, missing 
teacher reports for behavior at age 
5 years resulted in 7478 children 
being included in these analyses. 
Demographic characteristics of the 
families and rates of breastfeeding 
engagement can be found in  
Table 
1 and  
Fig 1. Ethics approval was 
obtained from the Research Ethics 
Committee, Department of Children 
and Youth Affairs Ireland, and 
written consent was collected from 
parents/guardians before data 
collection.
Measures
Children’s cognitive abilities 
and expressive vocabulary were 
measured by using 2 scales from 
the British Abilities Scale 
31. The 
pictures similarities scale assessed 
problem-solving skills and the 
naming vocabulary scale assessed 
expressive vocabulary. The construct 
validity of each scale was derived by 
using the Wechsler Preschool and 
Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised

Medical card coverage is a means-tested card issued by health services on the basis of fi
 nancial need. There are 2 tiers of medical card coverage: “full coverage, 
” which includes visits 
to general practitioners plus prescriptions and “general practitioner only coverage, 
” which excludes prescriptions. Regarding the maternal education variable, primary level/no formal 
education is approximately equivalent to having an elementary to middle school education in the US system; second level is approximately equivalent to a high school diploma or technical 
trade/vocational diploma in the US system; and third level is equivalent to a college or bachelor’s degree, graduate degree, or doctorate. Maternal working status refers to employment 
before pregnancy. Categorization of maternal depression refers to a score of ≥11 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.

Standardized scores that adjusted for 
performance as compared with other 
children of the same age, with a mean 
of 50 and a SD of 10, were used. Age 
was adjusted in 3-month age bands.
The Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire (SDQ 
32) was used to 
assess children’s problem behaviors. 
The parent version was used at age 
3 years and both the parent and 
teacher versions were used at age 
5 years. The SDQ is comprised of 5 
scales (emotional symptoms, conduct 
problems, hyperactivity/inattention, 
peer relationship problems, and 
prosocial behavior) with ratings 
of applicability of behaviors on a 
3-point scale. A total difficulties scale 
is included, combining the 4 problem 
scales, to yield an overall difficulties 
score. We used the conduct problems, 
hyperactivity/inattention, and 
difficulties scales given our focus on 
externalizing problems. Validation 
of the SDQ has been extensively 
documented. 
33  
Table 2 reports the 
correlations between parent and 
teacher SDQ reports and the means 
and SDs for all child outcomes.
Breastfeeding information was 
collected retrospectively when 
infants were 9 months old via 
maternal report. Support for the 
reliability of recall in previous 
breastfeeding studies has been 
established. 
34 However, given 
the lower reliability regarding 
the timing of the introduction of 
additional fluids/solids, Labbok 
and Krasovec’s definition of full (ie, 
exclusive or almost exclusive) and 
partial breastfeeding are used. 
35 
Two breastfeeding variables were 
created to assess whether the infant 
was fully or partially breastfed and 
the duration of each. Mothers were 
asked 4 questions: “Was <baby> ever 
breastfed, 
” “How old was <baby> 
when he/she completely stopped 
being breastfed, 
” “Was <baby> 
ever exclusively breastfed, 
” 
and “How old was <baby> when 
he/she completely stopped being 
exclusively breastfed?” First, infants 
were grouped by breastfeeding 
status, both full and partial (5940) 
and never breastfed (3914). Of those 
who had ever been breastfed, 4795 
had full breastfeeding at some point. 
Next, breastfeeding duration was 
grouped into 3 intervals; breastfed 
up to 31 days, 32 to 180 days, and 
≥181 days. Each category of duration 
was treated as mutually exclusive, 
dummy coded, and compared against 
infants who had never been breastfed 
for the purpose of matching.
Confounders have been suggested in 
part to account for the associations 
found between breastfeeding and 
child outcomes. We matched groups 
(breastfed, never breastfed) on 14 
of the most pertinent factors. At the 
child level, factors included sex (boy/
girl), birth weight (≥2500 g), and 
having neonatal intensive care (yes/
no). At the maternal level, factors 
included age (≤24 years, 25–29 
years, 30–34 years, or ≥35 years), 
highest level of education (primary 
level/no education, second level, or 
third level), working status before 
pregnancy (yes/no), ethnicity (Irish, 
any other white background, African 
or any other black background, Asian 
background, or other, including 
mixed background), depression 
(a score of ≥11 on the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale), and type of delivery (vaginal 
or caesarean). Family-level factors 
included having a partner in the 
residence (yes/no), social class 
(professional/managerial, other 
nonmanual/skilled manual, or 
semiskilled/unskilled), medical 
card status (free medical care, free 
general practitioner care, or no 
free medical care), total number of 
household members who smoked 
during the pregnancy (none, or ≥1), 
and whether the cohort infant had 
siblings living in the household.
Statistical Analysis
PSM reduces selection bias by 
matching children who were breastfed 
to children who were not, but who 
had a similar probability of being 
breastfed based on their measured 
characteristics. We used PSM logit 
models with nearest neighbor 1:1 
matching techniques. In nearest

neighbor matching, the sample is 
randomly ordered with matching 
occurring sequentially between the 
treatment (breastfed) and control (not 
breastfed) group based on participants’ 
propensity scores. Typically, the pair 
is then removed from the list and 
the next match is created. To ensure 
optimal matches, we imposed a caliper 
so that pairs could only be matched if 
the propensity score was within a tenth 
of a SD of the other. We also allowed 
matching with replacement given the 
low rates of longer durations and full 
breastfeeding in this cohort. Although 
matching with replacement has been 
argued to increase variance in the 
data, it also arguably reduces bias in 
the sample by ensuring better quality 
of matches. 
36 Balance checks in all 
models revealed substantial reductions 
of bias between matched groups on all 
individual confounders (ie, 0%–13.9% 
remaining bias in partial breastfeeding 
models, 0%–18.1% remaining bias in 
full models; data available on request). 
The remaining overall mean bias 
across models ranged from 3.2% to 
8.5%. The ≤20% remaining bias has 
been suggested as the acceptable cutoff 
after matching. 
37 Thus, we concluded 
that the analytic matching technique 
resulted in good matches between 
conditions. Matching resulted in all 
participants falling within the area 
of common support. The average 
treatment effect on those who were 
treated (ie, children who were 
breastfed) is reported. Adjustments 
were made for multiple hypothesis 
testing by using the Holmes-Bonferroni 
method. All statistical analyses for PSM 
were conducted by using Stata version 
13 software (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX).
To note, although PSM is 
advantageous in mimicking random 
assignment, a drawback is the 
challenge in evaluating a linear dose-
response association, which has 
previously been found. Structural 
equation modeling (SEM) offers an 
alternative approach to examining 
this dose-response association. 
Additionally, SEM uses the full sample 
and has greater power. Thus, the data 
were also modeled by using SEM, 
where confounders were treated 
as correlated exogenous variables, 
the duration of breastfeeding was 
treated as a continuous mediating 
variable, and child outcomes were 
treated as correlated, which could be 
influenced by both breastfeeding and 
confounders. These results can be 
found in the Supplemental Material.
RESULTS
Postmatching results for children 
fully breastfed up to 31 days 
revealed no statistically significant 
differences between groups on 
any outcome at age 3 or 5 years 
( 
Table 3). Similarly, for children 
who were fully breastfed between 
32 and 180 days, no statistically 
significant differences were found 
for any outcomes at either age 
postmatching ( 
Table 4). Finally, 
for children who were fully 
breastfed for ≥6, statistically 
significant differences were found 
postmatching for only 2 outcomes, 
problem solving and hyperactivity 
at age 3 years. Children who were 
fully breastfed scored 2.95 
(SE = 1.39, P = .048) points higher 
on the problem-solving scale 
compared with children who 
were never breastfed and –0.84 
(SE = 0.25, P ≤ .001) points lower 
on the hyperactivity scale. After 
adjustment for multiple testing, 
cognition was no longer statistically 
significant. However, children who 
were fully breastfed had slightly 
lower parent-rated hyperactivity 
compared with controls, and this 
remained statistically significant 
after adjustment ( 
Table 5). Of note, 
results of the partial breastfeeding 
models were similar to the full 
models, however, after adjustment 
for multiple testing, neither 
cognitive ability nor hyperactivity 
at age 3 years remained statistically 
significant. These results can be 
found in the Supplemental Material.
DISCUSSION
Without randomized controlled trials, 
the issue of causality will necessarily 
remain open, however the present 
results contribute important insights 
to the long-standing debate of potential 
“causal effects” versus artifacts of 
confounding that are not properly 
accounted for. This study also provides 
new perspectives on breastfeeding 
and children’s externalizing behavior. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is 
among the first studies to examine 
expressive vocabulary as an individual 
outcome and to consider externalizing 
behavior. It should be noted that our 
results apply only to infants born full 
term.
After adjustment for multiple 
testing, the initial support found for 
breastfeeding and better problem 
solving at age 3 years if the child was 
breastfed for a minimum of 6 months 
was no longer statistically significant. 
In addition, no statistically significant 
effects were found for cognitive ability 
at age 5 years. These results are in 
contrast to some studies that have 
used PSM techniques to examine the 
effects of breastfeeding and general 
cognitive abilities. 
38 
– 
40 However, 
differences in both analytical choices 
of the PSM approach used (eg, 
replacement, calipers) and differing 
selection of covariates may help 
to explain these differences across 
studies. Nonetheless, our findings 
were surprising in the context of 
the nutrients in breast milk being 
responsible for increased cognitive 
development. Regarding expressive 
vocabulary, no statistically significant 
advantages were observed for 
children who were breastfed at either 
age 3 or age 5.
The limited research on 
breastfeeding and behavior 
problems is inconsistent, despite 
the relatively consistent reliance 
on the SDQ. Of interest, studies that 
have dichotomized the SDQ scales 
into abnormal scores (ie, at the 85th 
or 90th percentile) have not found

GIRARD et al 
statistically significant differences, 
 
23 
– 
25 
suggesting that breastfeeding is 
not likely to be a contributor to 
behavioral problems at clinical 
levels. When the SDQ scales are 
treated as continuous, small effects 
under certain conditions have been 
found. 
22 In this study, we treated all 
3 scales as continuous and found that 
children who were fully breastfed for 
≥6 months had lower parent-rated 
scores on the hyperactivity scale 
at age 3 years only. This result 
remained statistically significant 
after adjustment for multiple 
testing. Our results suggest that 
longer durations of breastfeeding 
might help to reduce hyperactive 
behaviors for children who display 
mild to moderate levels in the short 
term, but that these benefits are not 
maintained even in the medium term. 
This result would seemingly support 
the recommendation of the World 
Health Organization, suggesting that 
breastfeeding for at least 6 months 
is necessary for early gains to be 
observed.
The inherent strengths of this study 
include the use of a particularly large 
longitudinal developmental dataset,

statistical approach, the use of a 
repeated measures design, the use of 
multiple informants and simultaneous 
standardized assessments thereby 
limiting potential shared method 
variance, the comparatively large 
number of confounders controlled 
(ie, 14) in contrast to previous studies 
(ie, an average of 7.7 ± 3.4 in higher-
quality studies 
28;), and assessments 
in both cognitive and noncognitive 
domains of child development. Despite 
these strengths, some limitations 
must be noted. First, information 
on breastfeeding was collected 
retrospectively. Although the reliability 
of recall has been established, 
 
34 it 
must be acknowledged that recall 
bias may nevertheless be present, 
particularly regarding the duration of 
full breastfeeding. Second, only parent-
reported SDQs were collected when 
children were 3 years of age. Studies 
have found that parents typically rate 
their children as having higher levels of 
problem behaviors as compared with 
teacher reports, with weak associations 
between these 2 types of informants, 
 
24 as was found in the current study 
for behavior ratings at age 5 years 
between parents and teachers. Having 
access to child care staff reports at 
age 3 years would have increased 
the reliability of the maternal-rated 
hyperactivity finding. Third, no 
information pertaining to direct 
breastfeeding versus expressed breast 
milk feeding was collected. Thus, it is 
not possible to investigate whether the 
association with reduced hyperactivity 
at age 3 years was the result of skin-
to-skin contact or due to the nutrients 
in breast milk. This is an important 
direction for future studies examining 
behavioral outcomes. Fourth, although 
maternal education was included as 
a confounder, maternal IQ was not 
collected in this cohort. In the few 
studies that controlled for maternal 
IQ, the findings suggested that it 
accounted for a large part of the 
association between breastfeeding 
and cognitive outcomes. 
39, 
41 Thus, 
the inclusion of maternal IQ in future 
studies that employ PSM is warranted. 
Finally, PSM does not address selection 
on unobservables. Causal estimates 
may only be estimated by using 
PSM if selection is on observable 
characteristics or, in cases where 
unobservable factors influence 
selection into breastfeeding, the 
balancing on observables also balances 
on these unobservables. Despite these 
limitations, the results of this study add 
to the growing literature by showing 
that some statistically significant 
positive noncognitive benefits 
may result from longer durations 
of breastfeeding. Yet, beyond the 
statistical implications, the practical 
implications appear minimal and short 
lived. It is important to note, however, 
that these findings do not contradict 
the many medical benefits afforded 
to both mother and child as a result of 
breastfeeding.
