to prenatal insults

Although sex biases in disease presentation are well documented, the mechanisms mediating
vulnerability or resilience to diseases are unknown. In utero insults are more likely to produce
detrimental health outcomes for males versus females. In our mouse model of prenatal
stress, male offspring experience long-term dysregulation of body weight and hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal stress axis dysfunction, endophenotypes of male-biased neurodevelop-
mental disorders. Placental function is critical for healthy fetal development, and we pre-
viously showed that sex differences in placental O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase
(OGT) mediate the effects of prenatal stress on neurodevelopmental programming. Here we
show that one mechanism whereby sex differences in OGT confer variation in vulnerability to
prenatal insults is by establishing sex-specific trophoblast gene expression patterns and via
regulation of the canonically repressive epigenetic modification, H3K27me3. We demon-
strate that high levels of H3K27me3 in the female placenta create resilience to the altered
hypothalamic programming associated with prenatal stress exposure.

dentifying the developmental factors that promote disease
susceptibility and resilience is critical to elucidating the etiol-
ogy of disease prevalence, severity, and symptomology. Med-
ical research has only recently begun to appreciate that biological
sex is one of the greatest predictors of disease risk and treatment
outcome. Sex biases in prevalence and symptomology are per-
vasive among some of the most prevalent health conditions
affecting Western societies today—from hypertension to diabetes,
arthritis, and cancers1. Neurological and psychiatric disorders are
especially noteworthy in their sex biases with post-pubertal onset
diseases, such as depression and anxiety, preferentially affecting
females, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism
spectrum disorders, early onset schizophrenia, and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorders presenting at significantly higher
rates in boys2–4. At birth, males are more likely to be admitted to
the neonatal intensive care unit and have higher infant mortality
than females5,6. In addition, males are more sensitive to prenatal
insults, such as gestational stress, maternal infection, and drug
exposure, which impart metabolic, cognitive, and behavioral
deficits in boys and an increased lifetime risk for disease pre-
sentation7. These statistics support the likelihood that the pre-
natal
environment
imparts
sex-specific,
long-term
health
consequences whereby males are at greater risk for detrimental
outcomes following in utero perturbations.
During early embryonic development, the placenta provides
the developing fetus with the nutrients and growth factors
necessary for development, through direct placental production
and via appropriation from maternal circulation8. The placenta is
largely comprised of cells originating from the fetally derived
trophoblast lineage, which are the first cells to differentiate after
fertilization and form the outer blastocyst layer in the early
embryo9. The trophoblast lineage’s fetal origin means that the
placenta reflects fetal sex chromosome complement. Conse-
quently, X- and Y-linked genes have the potential to introduce
sex differences in placental development and function. Studies
examining human placenta and utilizing animal models have
demonstrated that placental function is sensitive to changes in the
maternal milieu as evidenced by fluctuations in gene expression,
placental morphology and weight in response to nutrient cues,
drug and alcohol intake, infection and stress10–21. The energeti-
cally expensive developing brain is likely especially sensitive to
environmentally derived perturbations in placental function8.
Consequently, sex differences in placental activity and responses
to insults may contribute to increased male risk and female
resilience, including to certain neurodevelopmental disorders.
Consistent with epidemiological evidence for greater prenatal
sensitivity in males, our mouse model of prenatal stress in which
pregnant females are exposed to chronic stress during the first
week of gestation, produces male offspring with a phenotype of
neuroendocrine dysregulation, including hyperactive hypotha-
lamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) stress axis sensitivity and meta-
bolic dysfunction22,23. Using a large-scale genomic screen at three
gestational time points (E12.5, E15.5, and E18.5), we previously
identified placental O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase
(Ogt) as a biomarker of prenatal stress exposure in mice24. Ogt
codes for an X-linked enzyme (OGT) that utilizes cellular
nutrients, such as glucose, glutamine, ATP, and acetyl-CoA to O-
glycNAcylate thousands of proteins and alter cellular function25.
Ogt mRNA and protein levels are nearly twice as high in female
placental tissue than in male tissue in both rodents and
humans24. This already low level of Ogt in the male placenta is
then further significantly decreased by prenatal stress24. We
previously demonstrated that these low levels of placental Ogt
were causal in determining neurodevelopmental vulnerability, as
conditional, trophoblast-specific reduction of Ogt recapitulated
the prenatal stress phenotype26. Further, males with placental Ogt
deletion show large-scale changes in gene expression and
reduction in mitochondrial function in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a critical neuroendocrine
brain region that determines life-long stress responsivity26.
Whole-brain microRNA profiles are also disrupted by placental
Ogt reduction24. Taken together these results suggest that normal
function of placental OGT and the subsequent trans-placental
signals are critical for the developing brain, and that sex differ-
ences in placental OGT may mediate the increased male vul-
nerability to neurodevelopmental disorders.
OGT’s multitude of cellular functions suggests that small var-
iations in its enzymatic activity could have dramatic effects on
trophoblast cell function. For instance, OGT is known for directly
and indirectly broadly control transcription by enhancing RNA
polymerase II activity and histone modifications25. Thus sig-
nificant differences in Ogt levels have the potential to determine
sex-specific programs of trophoblast gene expression that may
mediate sex differences in placental function and trans-placental
signals relaying information regarding prenatal insults to the
developing fetus. Recently, OGT was shown to guide broad epi-
genomic patterning by mediating histone methylation, including
the ubiquitous repressive histone modification, H3K27me3, via
structural stabilization of the histone methyltransferase, enhancer
of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a member of the polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2)27. Therefore, OGT and Ezh2-mediated chan-
ges in placental H3K27me3 may underlie large-scale sex differ-
ences and responses to prenatal perturbations, such as stress, by
providing tighter control of transcriptional repression in one sex
over the other.
Here we test the hypothesis that female prenatal resilience is
driven by sex differences in placental transcriptional control, in
part by the X-linked gene, Ogt, and its regulation of the histone
repressive mark, H3K27me3. We find that levels of placental Ogt
determine sex differences in fetally derived placental trophoblast
transcriptome profiles associated with key developmental pro-
cesses and shape genome-wide patterning of the ubiquitous epi-
genetic transcriptional repressive mark, H3K27me3.
Results
Ogt regulates sex differences in trophoblast gene expression.
Using RNA-Sequencing and RiboTag technology28 to isolate
trophoblast cell-specific, actively translated mRNAs, we identified
4560 genes with significant sex differences in expression at
embryonic day (E)12.5 (Fig. 1a–d), far more than previous ana-
lyses
using
whole
placenta
containing
heterogeneous
and
maternal cell populations24,29–32. The large number of sex dif-
ferences in this fetally derived placental cell type demonstrates
their potential importance for establishing sex differences in
trans-placental signals and fetal development. Functional gene
ontology (GO) analysis revealed only 2 biological processes
enriched in male trophoblasts relative to females, whereas 81
biological processes were statistically enriched in female tropho-
blasts relative to males (Supplementary Figure 1a-d; Supple-
mentary Data File 1). This finding highlights the presence of sex
specificity in trophoblast function and suggests underlying sex-
specific epigenetic programs in placental trophoblasts, which
might promote the disparity in developmental vulnerabilities
between sexes.
Consonant with this idea and with the established role for OGT
in regulating epigenetic processes controlling large gene sets, we
found that genetic reduction of Ogt specifically in female
trophoblasts (Xogt−/Xwt, Supplementary Figure 2) recapitulated
patterns of male (Xwt/Y) trophoblast gene expression compared
to wild-type females (Xwt/Xwt; Fig. 1a, c, d) and eliminated many
sex differences in trophoblast gene expression compared to wild-

 type males (Xwt/Y; Fig. 1b, c, d). There were 2197 changes in gene
expression resulting from trophoblast-specific Ogt reduction in
the female placenta, 1534 of which were genes originally
identified with significant sex differences (Fig. 1c, d), illustrating
the importance of Ogt levels in determining sex differences in
trophoblast gene expression patterns. Of the 2609 genes elevated
in Xwt/Xwt trophoblasts relative to Xwt/Y, 1094 were decreased
(i.e., masculinized) by trophoblast Ogt reduction (Fig. 1e;
Supplementary Data File 1). Similarly, of the 1951 genes with
decreased relative expression in Xwt/Xwt trophoblasts versus
Xwt/Y, 432 were increased in Xogt−/Xwt trophoblast (Fig. 1f;
Supplementary Data File 2). Interestingly, we found that many of
the same GO biological processes were assigned to gene sets

 Placental Ogt regulates sex differences in the hypothalamus. In
our previous studies, genetic placental Ogt reduction recapitulated
the HPA stress axis dysregulation and metabolic dysfunction
characteristic of male offspring exposed to prenatal stress26.
Therefore, we predicted that sex differences in trophoblast
Ogt contribute to sex differences in neurodevelopment. Specifi-
cally, we focused on the hypothalamus, a neuroendocrine
brain region critical for stress and metabolic homeostasis,
which is sensitive to prenatal insults and frequently altered in
patients with neurodevelopmental disorders7,33. We hypothesized
that placental OGT, through its transcriptional control and
downstream
trans-placental
signals,
would
influence
key
known robust sex differences in hypothalamic development. To
avoid confounds associated with postnatal environmental influ-
ences,
we
performed
RNA-Sequencing
on
hypothalamic
mRNA at E18.5, a late gestational time point where the hypo-
thalamus is largely differentiated, from trophoblast Xwt/Xwt, Xwt/
Y, and Xogt−/Xwt fetuses. We found that more than one-third,
193 of 490, of the genes with significant sex differences
were altered in the female hypothalamus when placental Ogt
was reduced (Fig. 2a, b), 182 of which statistically switched to a
male expression pattern (Supplementary Data File 3), a con-
firmation of the critical importance of placental Ogt levels and
corresponding
trans-placental
signals
in
sex-specific
neurodevelopment.
Whereas, 382 genes were altered in the female hypothalamus
by placental Ogt reduction (Xwt/Xwt vs. Xogt−/Xwt), only 183
genes were differentially expressed between males and placental
Ogt hemizygous females (Xwt/Y vs. Xogt−/Xwt; Fig. 2b). Further,
the directionality of changes in differentially expressed hypotha-
lamic genes in trophoblast Xwt/Xwt vs. Xogt−/Xwt resembled the
directionality of differences in placental Xwt/Xwt vs. Xwt/Y
(Supplementary
Data
File
3).
Expression
patterns
of 182
hypothalamic genes were similar among trophoblast Xogt−/Xwt
females and Xwt/Y males relative to Xwt/Xwt females, with the
expression of 102 genes increased in trophoblast Xogt−/Xwt and
Xwt/Y males relative to Xwt/Xwt females (Fig. 2c) and 80 genes
decreased relative to Xwt/Xwt females (Fig. 2d), including genes
involved in sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus (Esr1,
Cyp19a1), genes linked to metabolic and stress responsivity
(Pmch,
Npy2r,
Grp),
and
those
previously
implicated
in
neurodevelopmental disorders (Foxp2, Foxg1, Oxt, Grp, Chrna4)
34. Only 2 of the 247 genes upregulated in Xwt/Xwt vs. Xwt/Y were
increased in trophoblast Xogt−/Xwt hypothalamus relative to Xwt/
Xwt (Fig. 2e), and a mere 9 hypothalamic genes downregulated in
Xwt/Xwt vs. Xwt/Y were commonly reduced in placental Xogt−/Xwt
vs. Xwt/Xwt (Fig. 2f). The marked masculinization of hypotha-
lamic gene expression patterns resulting from trophoblast-specific
Ogt reduction in females confirms the importance placental OGT
as a mediator of sex-specific neurodevelopment, and may
underlie sex differences in long-term programmatic outcomes
following prenatal perturbations.
OGT establishes sex differences in placental H3K27me3. OGT-
facilitated H3K27me3 patterning is a plausible mechanism
enabling its ability to establish large-scale sex differences in tro-
phoblast gene expression governing prenatal susceptibility. More
stringent epigenetic repression of chromatin state via high levels
of
H3K27me3
may
restrict
transcriptional
fluctuations
in
response to insults, providing females with in utero resiliency
relative to males. Accordingly, we hypothesized that placental
OGT acts as a mediator of sex-specific placental gene expression
through its regulation of H3K27me3. We identified a female-
biased sex difference in H3K27me3 in both human (Fig. 3a) and
E12.5 mouse placentas (Fig. 3b). While no longer statistically
significant, this pattern of enriched H3K27me3 in the female
mouse placenta persisted through late gestation (Supplementary
Figure 3a). Consistent with OGT’s previously described role in
EZH2 stabilization and activation27, we found that the sex dif-
ference in placental H3K27me3 was Ogt -dependent, as genetic
reduction of Ogt masculinized female placental H3K27me3 levels
(Fig. 3b). However, this Ogt reduction effect on H3K27me3
appeared specific as it did not promote pervasive changes in other
histone post-translational modifications in the placenta (Supple-
mentary Figure 3b, c). Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-Sequencing of H3K27me3 in the E12.5 placenta revealed
marked sex differences in H3K27me3 patterning across the entire
genome (Fig. 3c). Trophoblast-specific Ogt reduction eliminated
genome-wide sex differences in H3K27me3 peaks (±2 Kb from
transcription start sites), demonstrating a critical OGT function
in establishing sex-specific H3K27me3 configurations in placental
trophoblasts.
Trophoblast-specific Ezh2 reduction promotes vulnerability.
OGT regulates a multitude of cellular processes25. Therefore to
establish the necessity of high levels of H3K27me3 in female
resilience to prenatal stress, we genetically reduced Ezh2 in tro-
phoblasts (Supplementary Figure 4) to decrease H3K27me3 levels
in the female placenta (Fig. 4a). This manipulation did not dis-
rupt other critical histone post-translational modifications in the
placenta (Supplementary Figure 3d, e). Many neurodevelop-
mental disorders likely arise as the result of gene X environment
interactions7, in which detrimental outcomes are produced by the
interaction of genetic susceptibilities and environmental events
which alone are innocuous. We hypothesized that experimentally
induced female genetic vulnerability (i.e., reduced H3K27me3)
would interact with an environmental insult (prenatal stress) to

 produce the metabolic and HPA stress axis dysfunction typical in
male offspring following prenatal stress exposure. Trophoblast-
specific knockout (KO) of Ezh2 alone had no effect on female
body weight gain or HPA axis sensitivity (Fig. 4b, e, f). As pre-
viously reported22,35,36, wild-type (WT) female offspring exposed
in utero to prenatal stress showed little change in post-weaning
body weight gain (Fig. 4c) or HPA stress axis function in adult-
hood (Fig. 4e, f). However, as we predicted, the combination of
trophoblast
Ezh2
reduction × prenatal
stress
produced
the
expected susceptibility to neuroendocrine dysregulation. Females
with trophoblast Ezh2 reduction exposed to prenatal stress
showed lasting increases in post-weaning body weight relative to
WT females (Fig. 4d), and showed a hyper-reactive corticosterone
response to a restraint stressor (Fig. 4e, f), suggesting long term
metabolic and HPA stress axis dysfunction. As previous reported
in this phenotype, we found no effects of genotype or prenatal
stress exposure on behavior in an open field or elevated plus maze
(Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that female body weight
changes are not due to locomotor differences.
The marked metabolic and HPA stress axis dysregulation
exhibited by females with trophoblast-specific Ezh2 reduction
exposed to prenatal stress implies a change in developmental
programming of the hypothalamus. RNA-sequencing of the E18.5
hypothalamus from trophoblast-specific Ezh2 KO mice revealed
extensive disruptions of gene expression patterns, specifically in
females exposed to prenatal stress compared to control females
(Fig. 4g), suggesting that the developmental impact of environ-
mental insults synergize with placental genotype and epigenetic
status to direct trans-placental signals important for hypotha-
lamic development. Statistically enriched amongst the hypotha-
lamic genes were notable chromatin modifiers, including Setd7,
Tet1, Kmt2a, Ep300, Nipbl, Sirt1, Ogt, Kat2b, Kdm3a, Kdm5a, and
Ezh2 (Supplementary Data File 4), implicating trans-placental
signals as a mechanism for long-term epigenetic programming of
hypothalamic function. Although, we found substantial overlap in
hypothalamic genes enriched (Fig. 4h) and decreased (Fig. 4i) in
trophoblast WT females relative to both males and trophoblast
Xogt−/Xwt females, there were far fewer hypothalamic genes that

 shared predictable expression patterns in the hypothalamus of
females with trophoblast-specific Ezh2 reduction exposed to
prenatal stress. While many genes were significantly altered in the
hypothalamus of placental Ezh2 KO females exposed to prenatal
stress relative to controls, suggesting a role of placental function
in regulation of their expression, the directionality of these
changes was not always consistent with our hypothesis, such that
10 of the 102 genes that increased in expression in males and

increased in placental Ezh2 KO females (Fig. 4i; p = 9.457e−11,

Discussion
While sex differences in prenatal sensitivity to environmental
perturbations are well documented, a paucity of molecular
mechanisms responsible for imparting female resilience and male
risk during this critical period in neurodevelopment have been
reported. Here we provide evidence that the X-linked metabolic
and epigenetic enzyme, OGT, serves as a shield to gestational
perturbations in females, in part through its regulation of the
broad transcriptional repressive mark, H3K27me3, and tran-
scriptomic placental programs. Our finding that female-biased
trophoblast genes were easily sorted into gene sets associated with
GO biological processes but male-biased genes were not, may
suggest that female trophoblast gene expression, at baseline, is
epigenetically organized differently than male trophoblast gene
expression. This finding corresponds with our data that males
and female trophoblasts differ in their epigenomic programming
due to differences in placental Ogt dosage and may indicate that
placental
OGT-mediated
epigenomic
programing
promotes
greater baseline homogeneity in female trophoblast gene expres-
sion relative to males. When repressive transcriptional regulation
is reduced in females, via Ogt or Ezh2 manipulation, male-like
transcriptional variability is induced, possibly underlying envir-
onmental risk for neurodevelopmental vulnerability.
Large Ogt-driven differences in gene expression demonstrate
the importance of sex chromosome complement for trophoblast
cell function and support the placenta’s powerful role in intro-
ducing sex differences in fetal development. Our data show that
epigenetic and transcriptional patterns in the placenta contribute
to programming sex differences in the developing hypothalamus,
a region commonly disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders,
including autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia, which is a critical
integrator of environmental information and orchestrator of
organismal
homeostasis33,37–41.
Accordingly,
placental
H3K27me3 determines female resilience to the metabolic and
stress axis dysfunction produced by prenatal stress exposure, a
phenotype that we have previously shown to be male specific. Our
previous studies had revealed that trophoblast-specific Ogt
reduction recapitulated the male-specific phenotype. However,
the broad transcriptional control placental OGT played in reg-
ulation of sex differences in the placenta, as well as in impacting
trans-placental signals necessary for similar sex differences in
hypothalamic gene expression was previously unknown. Our
current results mechanistically demonstrate the involvement of
placental epigenetic signaling in neurodevelopment.
Here we focus on a single mode by which OGT mediates in
transcriptional epigenetic programming underlying neurodeve-
lopmental resilience: by determining H3K27me3 levels. Although
OGT directly influences EZH2 in breast cancer cells27 and
trophoblast-specific Ezh2 reduction in conjunction with prenatal
stress exposure recapitulated key aspects of the male-biased
phenotype typical of prenatal stress exposed mice, the hypotha-
lamic gene expression profiles in Ezh2 KO females exposed to
prenatal stress showed little overlap with those in Ogt hemizygous
female hypothalami, which likely suggests that mediation of
H3K27me3 levels is one of several mechanisms whereby placental
OGT influences brain development. OGT’s capacity to alter
numerous cellular signaling events, epigenomic programming,
and transcriptional activation could mean that regulation of
H3K27me3 is secondary or tertiary to an upstream modification
made by OGT. For instance, in addition to potentially impacting
trophoblast gene expression profiles via direct activation of RNA
polymerase II42, OGT can directly modify core histones43–45 and
has been reported to influence several other important epigenetic
modifications that could lead to sex differences in trophoblast
gene expression to ultimately influence brain development and
vulnerability. In addition, OGT can associate with TET2/3,

 methylcytosine oxidizing enzymes that enable DNA demethyla-
tion46–49. OGT-TET2/3 containing complexes have been shown
to promote the canonically permissive epigenetic modification,
H3K4me350. Thus, sex differences in OGT likely program tran-
scriptional
and
epigenetic
landscapes
via
several
different
mechanisms.
As Ogt is an X-linked gene and Ogt levels are higher in female
trophoblast cells, it is likely that Ogt escapes X-inactivation here.
Although, we did not directly assess this in our model, previous
studies have reported that Ogt as an X-inactivation escapee in
extra-embryonic tissues51–54, providing female trophoblasts with
two active copies versus a single copy in males. H3K27me3 is a
critical mediator of X-inactivation, and thus is expected to be
elevated in XX female cells. While Ogt reduction diminished
H3K27me3 levels in trophoblasts, we identified only 116 anno-
tatable X-linked genes that were also altered in these cells, 88 of
which showed enhanced expression when H3K27me3 was
reduced, suggesting that we did not impact widespread release of
X-inactivation (Supplementary Data File 6). This is not necessa-
rily surprising considering the large number of coordinated
epigenetic modifications (histone modifications, DNA methyla-
tion, and long-non-coding RNAs) necessary to silence the
inactive X55,56 and that our transgenic modification of Ogt also
did not produce vast alterations to histone modifications other
than
H3K27me3
as
previously
reported27

 Although additional studies are needed to further define how
placental OGT impacts the epigenomic landscape responsible for
healthy in utero development, our findings provide evidence that
its regulation of H3K27me3 is critical in determination of trans-
placental signals involved in brain programming. These outcomes
validate the importance of the placenta as an active intercessor
between the maternal milieu and fetal development, and
demonstrate that sex differences in placental genetic and epige-
netic patterning are critical in this process. Identifying the trans-
placental signals that determine neurodevelopmental vulner-
ability and retrospective studies examining gene × environment
interactions utilizing human extra-embryonic tissues will bring us
even closer to understanding how male-biased neurodevelop-
mental diseases arise.
Methods
Animals. Mice were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with ad libitum access
to food and water. For trophoblast-specific reduction of Ogt, trophoblast Cre (P.
Cre)57 positive females [B6.129-CYP19-Cre, P.Cre+/−)] were crossed with P.Cre
negative, OGT floxed males [B6.129-Ogttm1Gwh/J, XOgt−/ Y], resulting in off-
spring representing all potential genotypes. For RiboTag breedings, RiboTag het-
erozygous [B6.129-Rpl22-tm1.1Psam (RiboTag+/−)/placenta Cre positive (P.Cre
+/−)] females were bred to [Ogt floxed B6.129-Ogttm1Gwh/J (XOgt−/ Y)/RiboTag
heterozygous Rpl22-tm1.1Psam (RiboTag+/−)/ placental Cre negative (P.Cre−/+)]
males. For EZH2 breedings, B6.129-Ezh2tm2Sho/J+/+ females were crossed with
male B6.129-Ezh2tm2Sho/J+/−/ P.Cre+/−. Mice were mated and checked daily at
7:00 AM (lights on) for the presence of a copulation plug. Noon on the day that the
plug was observed was considered to be embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Prenatal stress
was performed as previously described22. Briefly, dams were randomly assigned to
treatment group and exposed to mild chronic variable stress from gestational day
1–7. Each mouse was exposed to 1 stressor per day. Stressors included overnight
light, overnight noise, overnight wet bedding, 15 min restraint stress, 1 h exposure
to predator odor, multiple cage change, and novel objects (marbles) placed in cage
overnight. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Sample sizes
for all experiments were based on previous expertize with these methods.
Animal weights. For studies in which animals were raised to adulthood, mice were
weaned at PN28, given ear tags for individual identification and weighed weekly
until 2 weeks prior to HPA stress axis testing. Because not all animals were weighed
at weaning, repeated measures ANOVAs could not be completed on our full weight
dataset. Instead, t-tests were conducted at each time point with Holm-Sidak
multiple comparison correction with α = 0.05 using Prism (GraphPad).
Tissue collection. Human placental tissue from de-identified neonates was
quartered by cutting traverse sections through the location of the emergence of the
umbilical cord in two directions. A total of 5 mg biopsies were obtained from the
fetal side of the placenta, 5 cm from the umbilical cord. Biopsies were flash frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Parental consent was given for
use of placental samples. Human tissue collection protocols were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania. Mouse placentas and
embryonic somatic tissue were dissected at E12.5 and E18.5. DNA was extracted
from the embryonic somatic tissue for genotyping and sexing. One-2 male and
female placenta per genotype from each litter was used for each analysis to elim-
inate potentially confounding litter effects; fetal heads were collected whole and
placentas were halved, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until
processed as below. For E18.5 hypothalamic RNA-Seq RNA collection, fetal heads
were sectioned at 300 μm on a Cryostat and a 1 mm tissue punch was collected in
Buffer RLT (RNeasy Micro Kit; Qiagen) and RNA was immediately isolated. All
tissue was deindentified and coded such that experiments were blind to genotype/
treatment.
Nuclear extraction and western immunoblot. For histone westerns, halved E12.5
and E18.5 mouse placentas and 2 cm2 human placenta biopsies were subject to
nuclear extraction using established protocols. Briefly, placentas were homogenized
with a pestle in sterile PBS on ice, homogenates were centrifuged at 1200×g for 10
min at 4 °C, pellets were washed with PBS, and resuspended in 800 μl of Buffer A
(10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). Following a 15 min incubation on ice, 0.05% NP-40 was
added, samples vigorously vortexed, and nuclear extracts pelleted at 14,000×g for
30 s. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in Buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM
KCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail) and
subject to Bradford assay for protein quantification. For OGT, O-glycNAc, and
EZH2 westerns, halved E12.5 placentas and brains were homogenized in RIPA
buffer (Sigma) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), centrifuged at 16000×g for
20 min at 4 °C, and whole-cell lysate protein concentration in supernatant was
quantified via Bradford assay. A total of 30 μg of placental protein was loaded per
lane for gel electrophoresis onto a NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies).
After running and transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (Life Tech-
nologies), membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor) and
probed with rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (1:1000; Millipore 07–449), rabbit anti-
H3K4me3 (1:1000, abcam ab8580), rabbit anti-H3K9ac (1:1000, Cell Signaling
C5B11), rabbit anti-OGT (1:1000, Sigma DM-17), mouse anti-O-glycNac (1:1000,
Biolegend CTD110.6), rabbit anti-EZH2 (1:2500; Millipore 07–689), and/or mouse
anti-beta actin (1:30,000; Sigma A5441) followed by incubation in IRDye800-
conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary (1:20,000; Li-Cor) and or IRDye680-
conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary (1:20,000; Li-Cor). We used single-tailed t-
tests for most two-group analyses because we had a priori hypotheses about the
directionality of the changes in protein expression based on our previous data on
sex differences and OGT regulation of H3K27me3 and predicted directional effects
of Ezh2 and Ogt transgenic manipulation. As we did not have a priori hypotheses
about the directionality of H3K4me3 or H3K9ac, we used two-tailed t-tests for
these analyses. Western blot quantification of H3K27me3 in male, female, and
trophoblast Xogt−/Xwt by one-way ANOVA with α = 0.05 using Prism (Graph-
Pad). Images of full western blots are shown in Supplementary Figure 6.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Placental chromatin
isolation and sample preparation was performed as described previously26. Briefly,
chromatin was isolated from halved placentas following six 5 min rounds on
sonication on ice, using Dynabeads Protein G (Life Tech) and an H3K27me3
antibody (Millipore 07–449; 1:15). Multiplexed libraries were prepared from 10 ng
of chromatin using the Illumina TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit. Libraries
were sequenced (50-bp single end) on an Illuminia NextSeq500; fastq files were
aligned to the genome using Bowtie258, enriched peaks relative to input for
H3K27me3 were calculated using HOMER59, and these peak counts were then
used for subsequent analyses in DESeq60.
RiboTag mRNA immunoprecipitation. Actively translated mRNA was immuno-
precipitated from placental trophoblasts at E12.5 using RiboTag mice as previously
described28. Briefly, whole placentas were dounce homogenized in 3 ml supple-
mented homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2,
1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 200 U/mL RNasin (Promega), 1 mg/mL heparin, 100 μg/
mL cyclohexamide, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). Samples were centrifuged
at 10,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C, 800 μl of supernatant was added incubated with 5 μl
of anti-HA.11 clone 16B12 antibody (BioLegend) for 4 h at 4 °C. A total of 400 μl of
Dynabeads Protein G (Life Tech) were washed with supplemented homogenization
buffer and incubated with supernatant-antibody complex overnight at 4 °C. The
following day, bead-antibody-protein complexes were washed three times for 5 min
with high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40,
1 mM DTT, 100 μg/mL cyclohexamide. Immediately following washes, Qiagen
Buffer RLT was added to complexes and RNeasy protocol was followed per the
manufacturer’s instructions to isolate RNA from complexes.
RNA sequencing and analysis. RNA from placental RiboTag and hypothalamic
punches was quantified on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) spectro-
photometer and quality was assessed on a BioAnalyzer (Agilent). RNA-Seq
libraries were constructed using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit
using the low sample protocol on 350 ng total RNA from E18.5 hypothalamic
punches and 700 ng RiboTag isolated mRNA from E12.5 placenta. Libraries sizes
and concentrations were confirmed on a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent) and by KAPA
assay (KAPA Biosystems). Individually barcoded libraries were pooled and
sequenced on an Illuminia NextSeq500 (75-bp single end). Alignment and read
counting was performed in RSubread using featureCounts61,62. Library size nor-
malization and differential expression analysis on normalized read counts was
performed using DESeq60. Differential expression was based on an FDR adjusted p-
value <0.05, with no fold change cutoff to maximize the number of genes included
in our comparisons of placental and hypothalamic masculinization. All statistical
analyses were performed in and figures generated in R on normalized counts63
(version 3.1.1) using base packages and plyr64, gplots65, RColorBrewer66, and
venneuler67. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) functional annotation clustering68 was used for the gene ontology (GO)
pathway analysis on differentially expressed gene lists.
Corticosterone response to restraint stress. Naive 11–12-week-old-female mice
were restrained in a 50 ml conical tube for 15 min beginning at time 0 min and
were immediately returned to their home cage at the conclusion of restraint (time
15 min). A single-tail snip was made at time 0 min, removing <1 mm tissue from
the distal tip. A total of 10 μL of tail blood was collected by micropipette at 0, 15,
30, and 120 min into EDTA-treated tubes. Corticosterone levels were quantified by
radioimmunoassay (MP Biomedicals) in 3 μL plasma. All testing was completed
2–5 h after lights on. Cort rise and fall data were analyzed by repeated measures
two-way ANOVA and total Cort (area under curve; AUC) was analyzed by one-
way ANOVA with α = 0.05 using Prism (GraphPad). Samples that 2 standard
deviations above or below the mean were treated as outliers and excluded.

 Behavioral testing. Two weeks following HPA stress axis assessment, mice were
subject to testing in an open field during the dark cycle to determine the impact of
trophoblast-specific EZH2 reduction on locomotor activity and anxiety-like
behavior. The open field apparatus is a white Plexiglas box 50 × 50 × 22 cm with a
16 12 × 12 cm grid drawn on the floor. Testing was conducted with 120 lux in the
center of the box, 2–4 h after lights out (9:00 to 11:00 PM). Each mouse was placed
in the center of the box to initiate the 10 min test and tracked using AnyMaze
(Stoelting) software. Two weeks following completion of open field testing, mice
were subject to locomotor and anxiety-like behavior testing on an elevated plus
maze during lights on. Testing duration was 5 min with a light intensity of 6 lux in
the open arms. AnyMaze software was used to measure distance, grid crosses and
time in open arms. Mice that jumped off open arms during testing were excluded
from analysis. Behavioral data collected by an experimenter blind to treatment and
analyzed by two-way ANOVA (genotype × treatment) using Prism software
(Graphpad).
