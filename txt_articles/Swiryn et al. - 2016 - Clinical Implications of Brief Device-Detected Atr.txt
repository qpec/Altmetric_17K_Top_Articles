BACKGROUND: The RATE Registry (Registry of Atrial Tachycardia 
and Atrial Fibrillation Episodes) is a prospective, outcomes-oriented 
registry designed to document the prevalence of atrial tachycardia and/
or fibrillation (AT/AF) of any duration in patients with pacemakers and 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and evaluate associations 
between rigorously adjudicated AT/AF and predefined clinical events, 
including stroke. The appropriate clinical response to brief episodes of AT/
AF remains unclear.
METHODS: Rigorously adjudicated electrogram (EGM) data were 
correlated with adjudicated clinical events with logistic regression and 
Cox models. Long episodes of AT/AF were defined as episodes in which 
the onset and/or offset of AT/AF was not present within a single EGM 
recording. Short episodes of AT/AF were defined as episodes in which both 
the onset and offset of AT/AF were present within a single EGM recording.
RESULTS: We enrolled 5379 patients with pacemakers (N=3141) or ICDs 
(N=2238) at 225 US sites (median follow-up 22.9 months). There were 
359 deaths. There were 478 hospitalizations among 342 patients for 
clinical events. We adjudicated 37 
531 EGMs; 50% of patients had at least 
one episode of AT/AF. Patients with clinical events were more likely than 
those without to have long AT/AF (31.9% vs. 22.1% for pacemaker patients 
and 28.7% vs. 20.2% for ICD patients; P<0.05 for both groups). Only short 
episodes of AT/AF were documented in 9% of pacemaker patients and 16% 
of ICD patients. Patients with clinical events were no more likely than those 
without to have short AT/AF (5.1% vs. 7.9% for pacemaker patients and 
11.5% vs. 10.4% for ICD patients; P=0.21 and 0.66, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In the RATE Registry, rigorously adjudicated short 
episodes of AT/AF, as defined, were not associated with increased risk of 
clinical events compared with patients without documented AT/AF.

P
rolonged episodes of device-documented atrial 
tachycardia and/or fibrillation (AT/AF) are associ-
ated with increased risk of clinical events, including 
stroke. In the presence of an elevated CHA2DS2-VASc 
score,1 anticoagulation may be indicated.
The appropriate clinical response to brief episodes of 
AT/AF remains unclear. Guidelines from the European So-
ciety of Cardiology state, “Recent data … reinforce the 
assumption that even brief episodes of ‘silent’ AF convey 
an increased risk for stroke.”2 Societies2,3 recommend oral 
anticoagulation for all patients with paroxysmal AF with risk 
factors and no contraindications, but they do not provide 
any minimum duration of AF to qualify. It is tempting to as-
sume that, if episodes of AT/AF longer than some specific 
time duration are associated with risk, shorter episodes 
may not carry enough risk to warrant anticoagulation. Yet 
even frequent premature atrial complexes (PACs) or short 
episodes of AT/AF may be associated with risk of stroke.4–6
Further, implantable devices are not accurate in identify-
ing and differentiating short episodes of AT/AF.7 This has led 
to the recommendation that “since inappropriate AT detec-
tion is frequent, … manual confirmation of device informa-
tion is necessary.”8 Because they evaluated device-based 
burden data, all published studies of the clinical implications 
of device-detected AT/AF have excluded episodes of <5 
minutes as being unreliable for a true diagnosis of AT/AF. In 
general, these studies did not examine electrograms (EGMs) 
rigorously to confirm the diagnosis of AT/AF. In a meta-anal-
ysis by Boriani et al,9 there was an increased hazard ratio 
for stroke even for patients with the shortest category of 
>5 minutes of AT/AF compared with a combined group of 
patients with either <5 minutes or no AT/AF. Because those 
patients with no detected AT/AF were combined for analysis 
with those thought, without examination of EGMs, to have 
only episodes of <5 minutes duration, no conclusion can be 
drawn about the risk of brief, manually confirmed AT/AF. It is 
possible that even brief episodes of AT/AF would have been 
associated with increased risk, but that this was obscured 
by including all patients with no detected AT/AF in the same 
group as those with brief episodes.
In the RATE Registry (Registry of Atrial Tachycardia and 
Atrial Fibrillation Episodes),10 we planned a formal and 
rigorous adjudication method involving manual scrutiny of 
recorded EGMs that would allow us to evaluate the clinical 
implications, if any, of even brief episodes of AT/AF.
MethODs
RATE is a prospective, follow-up data collection registry. 
Details of the RATE Registry study design have been previously 
published.10 Each center obtained approval from the local 
Institutional Review Board and informed consent from each 
patient before enrollment.
inclusion and exclusion criteria10
The registry enrolled patients ≥18 years of age within 45 days 
of implantation of a St. Jude Medical pacemaker or defibril-
lator (ICD) that included an atrial lead and Advanced AT/AF 
Diagnostic capabilities. Patients were excluded if they had 
documented permanent atrial fibrillation or documented atrial 
fibrillation within 3 months before enrollment.
Data collection
Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected for 
each patient.10 Device-recorded data included all intracardiac 
EGMs stored by the device for any reason. Follow-up hospital 
admission records and interval head CT data were collected. 
Prespecified clinical events examined included stroke or tran-
sient ischemic attack (TIA), hospitalization or emergency room 
visits due to AT/AF or heart failure, and mortality. Sample 
size was set at 5000 patients with a follow-up of 2 years as 
described in detail previously.10
Patient Follow-Up
Patients were followed for up to 24 months after enrollment. 
Data were collected at enrollment and every 6 months thereaf-
ter for all patients. Patients implanted with an ICD had additional 
device interrogations at 3, 9, 15, and 21 months. Diagnostic 
information and stored atrial and ventricular EGMs were col-
lected. Clinical evaluation included New York Heart Association 
classification and medical interview to collect information on 
all-cause hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and <24-
hour inpatient visits.
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• The RATE Registry provides the first reliable data 
demonstrating that, in contrast to long episodes of 
device-detected AT/AF, short episodes, as defined, 
were not associated with clinical events over the 
course of 2 years of follow-up. 
• Not surprisingly, patients initially presenting with 
repeated short episodes of AT/AF, and especially 
those presenting with short AT/AF within the first 3 
months, were more likely to have longer episodes 
during subsequent monitoring than those patients 
with no documented AT/AF.
What are the clinical implications?
• Our unique finding that patients with only short epi-
sodes of AT/AF were not at increased risk of clinical 
events is reassuring and should help clinicians to 
further resolve the anticoagulation recommenda-
tions published in society guidelines and avoid over-
reaction to such findings. 
• The results of our study suggest that immediate 
anticoagulation in patients with only short episodes 
of AT/AF is unlikely to result in reduction of the risk 
of stroke, at least during a 2-year follow-up. 
• Scrutiny of such patients for the appearance of lon-
ger episodes is important because many will prog-
ress over time.

clinical event adjudication
Clinical end points were adjudicated with criteria from the 
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) by two physician 
members of the RATE Registry Steering Committee (DLJ and 
MS) blinded to the EGM adjudications. End points included 
emergency room visits/hospitalizations for heart failure, atrial 
or ventricular arrhythmias, stroke or TIA, and syncope. Cardiac 
versus noncardiac causes of in-hospital deaths were also adju-
dicated. For cases in which the initial adjudicated decisions 
differed, final adjudication was determined by consensus after 
joint data review.
electrogram adjudication
We estimated that as many as 130 
000 EGMs might be 
recorded during the RATE Registry follow-up. Therefore, we 
chose to adjudicate EGMs in selected subsets of patients. 
The random sample, designed to provide 95% confidence of 
defining the true incidence of AT/AF, consisted of 300 ran-
domly chosen pacemaker patients and 300 randomly chosen 
ICD patients. In addition, EGMs were adjudicated from every 
patient with a predefined clinical event (hereinafter referred to 
as case patients) and also from 2 patients without a clinical 
event matched to each case patient by age (within 3 years), 
sex, and device type (control patients).
EGM adjudication was performed by 8 teams after a for-
mal training period. Each team consisted of 1 physician expe-
rienced in device management and EGM interpretation and 1 
experienced St. Jude Medical field clinical engineer, who adjudi-
cated each EGM independently. If agreement was not reached, 
a third reviewer (a physician from another team) was consulted. 
For purposes of this analysis, AT/AF was defined only by adju-
dicated EGMs and not by automatic device diagnostics.
arrhythmia Definitions
Any adjudicated run of ≥3 consecutive PACs documented in a 
stored EGM recording was defined as AT/AF. Short episodes 
of AT/AF were defined when both the onset and offset of an 
episode were documented within the same EGM recording 
(Figure 1A). Long episodes of AT/AF were defined when the 
onset and/or the offset of an episode was undocumented 
within the same EGM recording (Figure 1B). Although no spe-
cific duration criterion was used to define short or long epi-
sodes, short episodes typically lasted <15 to 20 seconds. 
Patients with documented short episodes who never had a 
documented long episode were referred to as having only 
short AT/AF episodes. Inter- and intraobserver variability of 
adjudication results was formally evaluated.
statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics are presented with percentages for 
categorical variables and means and standard deviations for 
continuous variables. Fisher exact test was used for categori-
cal variables, and a 2-sample t test for continuous variables, to 
compare the cohort of case patients with the control cohort. 
Case patients were also compared with all patients without a 
clinical event.
Risk of prespecified clinical events was calculated as the 
total number of clinical events divided by the total follow-
up time and expressed per 100 person-years of follow-up. 
Incidence of AT/AF was determined as the number and propor-
tion of patients who had AT/AF in adjudicated EGMs over the 
follow-up period. The follow-up period of each control patient 
was truncated to ensure that it did not exceed the follow-up 
period of the corresponding case patient.
Univariate logistic regression models were used to deter-
mine the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the associa-
tion of two separate explanatory variables with clinical events: 
presence or absence of short AT/AF, given that no long AT/AF 
occurred; and presence or absence of long AT/AF. EGMs were 
censored after the clinical event for the case patients and after 
an identical follow-up period for matching controls so only AT/AF 
that occurred before the first clinical event was accepted, with a 
similar surveillance duration applied to controls.
Multivariable logistic regression was also conducted, ini-
tially considering covariates of anticoagulant usage, hyperten-
sion, history of stroke, ventricular tachycardia, prior myocardial 
infarction (MI), QRS complex duration, and left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF). Covariates with univariate P value >0.25 
in the test of association with all clinical events were excluded 
from the multivariable regression. For pacemaker patients, the 
final multivariable model included anticoagulant usage, prior 
MI, and LVEF as covariates. For ICD patients, the final multivari-
able model included anticoagulant usage, hypertension, history 
of stroke, ventricular tachycardia, MI, and LVEF as covariates. 
SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC) and Matlab R2013b (Natick, MA) were used 
for statistical analysis and data visualization.
We further performed a multivariable-adjusted survival anal-
ysis with a Cox proportional-hazards regression model, includ-
ing a time-varying covariate for presence of short AT/AF to 
determine whether it was associated with later long AT/AF in 
the random sample. Similarly, we performed survival analyses 
examining the association of time-varying covariates for occur-
rence of short and long AT/AF with occurrence of incident clini-
cal events in cases and matched controls.

registry Patients
Between 2006 and 2012, the RATE Registry enrolled 
and followed 5379 patients at 225 US sites, including 
3141 patients with pacemakers (Table 1) and 2238 
with ICDs (Table 2). Patients with pacemakers were, on 
average, ≈7years older than those with ICDs. CHADS2 
scores ranged from 0 to 6 (mean 2±1). Median total 
follow-up was 22.9 months.
clinical events
There were 2232 total hospitalizations and 359 deaths. 
There were 478 hospitalizations among 342 patients for 
predefined clinical events (Table 3), including symptom-
atic atrial arrhythmias (n=94), heart failure (n=265), and 
stroke or TIA (n=47). The total of 837 clinical events 
(including deaths) was somewhat lower than the 949 
predicted in the sample size calculation. Differences

We adjudicated 37 
530 EGMs stored for any reason by 
the device from 1736 patients (Table 4), including the 
600 patient random sample; all patients with prespeci-
fied clinical events (including all deaths); and 2 case con-
trols for each patient with a clinical event. Interobserver 
agreement between the paired adjudicators was 96% for 
AT/AF diagnosis.
incidence of at/aF
From the random sample of 300 pacemaker and 300 
ICD patients, 50% of patients had at least one atrial EGM 
during follow-up demonstrating AT/AF (145 pacemaker 
patients, 48% and 155 ICD patients, 52%; Table 4). 
Twenty-six (9%) of pacemaker patients and 47 (16%) of 
ICD patients had only short episodes of AT/AF and no 
long episodes over their entire follow-up. The incidence 
of AT/AF was 0.283 cases per patient-year in pace-
maker patients and 0.233 cases per patient-year in ICD 
patients.
In addition to 15 
693 episodes of AT/AF, adjudicated 
EGMs documented 1:1 A-V ratio tachycardias with a 
cycle length >400 ms (n=1752), 1:1 A-V ratio tachycar-
dias with a cycle length ≤400 ms (n=2138), ventricular 
tachycardia or fibrillation (n=1753), sensing of far-field R 
waves (n=4563), noise (n=3227), pacemaker-mediated 
tachycardia (n=3284), sinus rhythm (n=2448), and/or 
competitive atrial pacing (n=4894), the latter including 
repetitive, nonreentrant ventriculo-atrial synchrony. In oc-
casional patients, reproducibly, competitive atrial pacing 
during the atrial relative refractory period induced AT/AF. 
Many EGMs contained more than 1 adjudicated finding.
association of clinical events with at/aF  
(table 4, Figures 2 and 3)
Cases were more likely than controls to have document-
ed AT/AF. Of patients with pacemakers, 37% of cases 
compared with 30% of controls had device-documented 
AT/AF (P=0.073). Of patients with ICDs, 40% of cases 
compared with 31% of controls had device-documented 
AT/AF (P=0.004). This association was even stronger 
for long episodes of AT/AF. Thirty-two percent of cas-
es with pacemakers and 29% of cases with ICDs had 
documented long AT/AF compared with 22% and 20% 
of controls, respectively (P=0.006 for pacemakers and 
P=0.004 for ICDs). There were 3 patients with only short 
AT/AF among the cases with stroke/TIA and their con-
trols who were anticoagulated, 2 of whom had a stroke.

pacemakers (Figure 2), any single atrial EGM document-

ing long AT/AF was significantly associated with the 
composite of all clinical events and with hospitalization 
for clinical AT/AF but not with hospitalization for heart 
failure, stroke, or all-cause mortality. With multivariable 
logistic regression in pacemaker patients (Figure 2), 
there was no statistically significant association of long 
AT/AF with the composite of clinical events or with any 
of the individual events, including stroke.
With univariate logistic regression for those patients 
with ICDs (Figure 3), any single EGM documenting long 
AT/AF was significantly associated with the composite of 
all clinical events as well as with hospitalization for clinical 
AT/AF and all-cause mortality but not with hospitalization 
for heart failure or stroke. With multivariable logistic re-
gression in ICD patients (Figure 3), there was a significant 
association of long AT/AF with the composite of clinical 
events (odds ratio 1.57, P=0.006), hospitalization for 
clinical AT/AF (odds ratio 5.35, P=0.0001), and all-cause 
mortality (odds ratio 2.00, P=0.006). There was no sig-
nificant association of long AT/AF with hospitalization for 
heart failure or with stroke.
There was no statistically significant association of 
short episodes of AT/AF with outcomes in cases com-
pared with controls. This was confirmed in univariate 
and multivariable logistic regression models (Figures 2 
and 3). Five percent of cases with pacemakers and 8% 
of controls had only short AT/AF documented (P=0.21). 
Twelve percent of ICD cases and 10% of controls had 
only short AT/AF documented (P=0.66).
Progression of at/aF Over time 
Some patients initially presenting with short AT/AF pro-
gressed to having long episodes later during follow-up 
and ended up in the any long AT/AF group. With the 
600 patients in the random sample, we scrutinized this 
progression (Figure 4). Over 2 years of follow-up, ≈55% 
of pacemaker patients and 45% of ICD patients whose 
initial AT/AF was short had at least 1 long episode 
documented later in follow-up. Presence of short AT/AF 
was associated with an unadjusted hazard ratio for de-
velopment of long AT/AF 1.27 (95% confidence interval

sex, prior MI, left atrium (LA) dimension, and LVEF, the 
hazard ratio was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.00–1.64, P=0.055).
We evaluated the incidence of clinical events during 
follow-up with time-varying covariates for short and long 
AT/AF in a multivariable Cox model adjusted for age, 
sex, history of MI, left atrial dimension, and LVEF. For this 
analysis, we used 1565 patients (all cases and their two 
controls, pacemaker and ICD). The likelihood of any event 
after only short AT/AF was significantly less than that for 
patients with no AT/AF (HR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77–0.97, 
P=0.01). However, occurrence of long AT/AF was associ-
ated significantly with incident clinical events compared 
with those with no AT/AF (HR 1.68, 95% CI, 1.49–1.88, 
P<0.001). The likelihood of stroke or TIA if only short AT/
AF was observed was not significantly different compared 
with patients with no AT/AF (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58–1.31, 
P=0.51), whereas long AT/AF was associated with inci-
dent stroke or TIA (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03–2.21, P=0.03).

The RATE Registry provides the first reliable data dem-
onstrating that, in contrast to long episodes of device-
detected AT/AF, short episodes, as defined, were not 
associated with clinical events over the course of 2 
years. The rate of progression to long AT/AF did not dif-
fer significantly between patients with initially only short

AT/AF versus no AT/AF, but progression from short to 
longer episodes was observed in some patients, and 
the association was of borderline statistical signifi-
cance. To our knowledge, RATE is the first published 
study in a large population with implanted devices that 
was designed to allow conclusions to be drawn about 
brief episodes of AT/AF.
incidence of at/aF
Results of the RATE Registry confirm through rigorous 
adjudication of EGMs that AT/AF is common in patients 
with implanted devices. Our estimate of AT/AF incidence 
is similar to prior reports.8,11–13 In occasional patients, 
the device induced AT/AF via competitive atrial pacing 
falling during the atrial relative refractory period—a find-
ing that would be missed without adjudication of EGMs. 
The 50% incidence of AT/AF in approximately 2 years’ 
follow-up is double that reported in the Framingham 
population.14 Much of this difference is likely attributable 
to the far greater sensitivity for identifying AT/AF with 
implanted devices compared with ECG follow-up used in 
the Framingham study. Because of this inherently great-
er monitoring ability, it is not possible to know whether 
this group has a higher incidence of AT/AF than patients 
without pacemakers or ICDs who are similar in age and 
other clinical characteristics.
Brief episodes of at/aF
A unique contribution from the RATE Registry data is 
the ability, because of extensive EGM adjudication, to 
make statements about the clinical implications of brief 
episodes of AT/AF. Due to limitations on the specific-
ity of device-based detection of brief episodes of AT/
AF,7 all previous studies in the device population of the 
relationship of AT/AF to clinical events have limited their 
examination to episodes of greater than several minutes’

duration. However, even device-detected episodes last-
ing >5 minutes are not always true AT/AF. For example, 
Pollak7 found that 11% of episodes of >5 minutes were 
not true AT/AF, whereas in the ASSERT trial (Asymptom-
atic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker 
Patients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing 
Trial),15 a cutoff of >6 minutes yielded a 17.3% false-pos-
itive rate, compared with a 3.3% false-positive rate for 
episodes >6 hours.16 Further, all prior studies have com-
bined patients with AT/AF lasting <5 minutes with those 
patients without AT/AF, potentially obscuring any clinical 
implication of true brief AT/AF. In RATE, we can state 
with a high degree of certainty, based on the consensus 
of two adjudicators for every atrial EGM, that only true 
AT/AF events were included in our analyses. We even 
observed occasional patients where competitive atrial 
pacing reproducibly induced AT/AF, a finding that would 
not be possible without careful adjudication of EGMs.
Even brief episodes of AT/AF or frequent PACs might 
be of significance. In one study,6 Holter monitors were 
obtained in 402 sixty-eight-year-old men who were fol-
lowed for 14 years. Frequent PACs were associated with 
nearly double the risk of stroke in a multivariable anal-
ysis. In the Copenhagen Holter Study4 of 678 healthy 
subjects who underwent a 48-hour Holter recording, the 
finding of ≥30 PACs per hour or any supraventricular 
run of ≥20 beats was associated with increased risk of 
death or stroke and with hospitalization for AT/AF over a

6.3-year follow-up. This study has now been updated5 to 
include 15-year follow-up.
From the RATE Registry, in contrast to long episodes, 
we did not demonstrate excess risk of clinical events in 
patients with only short episodes of AT/AF. However, the 
duration of follow-up in RATE was only 23 months—much 
shorter than in the 2 ECG monitor studies discussed pre-
viously. Not surprisingly, patients initially presenting with 
repeated short episodes of AT/AF, and especially those 
presenting with short AT/AF within the first 3 months, 
were more likely to have longer episodes during sub-
sequent monitoring than those patients with no docu-
mented AT/AF. The possibility that some patients might 
progress during additional follow-up to longer episodes 
with the increased associated risk must be considered.
Prior Published studies of Device-Detected at/aF
Prolonged episodes of AT/AF are associated with clinical 
events. The Mode Selection Trial (MOST)13 documented 
an increased risk of stroke, death, and clinical atrial fibrilla-
tion in pacemaker patients with AF of >5 minutes. Shorter 
episodes were not evaluated, and EGMs were not recorded. 
Capucci et al17 found that AT/AF >24 hours, but not those 
<24 hours, were associated with thromboembolic events. 
The TRENDS study (A Prospective Study of the Clinical Sig-
nificance of Atrial Arrhythmias Detected by Implanted De-
vice Diagnostics)18 reported that >5.5 hours of AT/AF on 
any day or 10.8 total hours in 30 days put a patient at risk. 
In TRENDS, when a patient had no AT/AF documented in the 
first year of follow-up, that patient was not followed further. 
Importantly, RATE demonstrated that more than one-third of 
patients with no AT/AF documented during the first year of 
follow-up had AT/AF documented during the second year.
The ASSERT study15 reported that patients with device-
documented AT/AF lasting at least 6 minutes within the 
first 3 months after enrollment had an increased risk of 
clinical AT/AF and thromboembolism. As in MOST and 
TRENDS, shorter episodes of AT/AF were not evaluated. 
In a large pooled analysis of 3 studies of device-detected 
AT/AF, Boriani et al9 found that >1 hour of AT/AF in any 
follow-up day was the best predictor among AT/AF burden 
measures of ischemic stroke, and risk of stroke increased 
by ≈3% with each added hour of maximum daily AT/AF. 
Again, episodes of AT/AF of <5 minutes were included 
in the group of patients with no AT/AF for the analysis. In 
a study of patients with implanted resynchronization de-
vices, >3.8 hours of device-documented AT/AF was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.19
Potential limitations
Adjudication of EGMs in RATE allowed the confirmation of 
every available episode of AT/AF, even those of short dura-
tion, as well as exclusion of longer episodes that proved to 
be false positives. However, device memory and detection 
limitations precluded examination of the full duration of all 
AT/AF episodes. Some episodes that we defined as long 
for purposes of the RATE Registry might have lasted only 
a minute or 2—not typically considered long by clinical 
standards. By including some episodes of AT/AF that we 
might not consider to be long clinically in the adjudicated 
long AT/AF episode category, it is possible that the asso-
ciation of clinically long episodes with clinical events might 
be underestimated. Adjudication of EGMs, while afford-
ing accuracy of diagnosis, cannot address duration once 
an episode exceeds the storage capacity of the device.
It must be kept in mind that there are other well-known 
risk factors in addition to AT/AF. For example, older age, 
diabetes, and hypertension are common in the pacemak-
er and ICD populations. Because the follow-up duration 
of ≈2 years in this and similar studies is relatively short, 
the natural history of episodic asymptomatic AT/AF be-
yond this time horizon remains poorly defined.
Finally, as in prior published studies in device pa-
tients,15,17,18,20 the risk of associated stroke we observed 
in RATE was low—<1 per 100 years of patient follow-up 
in the entire group, with only a modest increase in docu-
mented stroke risk with the presence of AT/AF. Impor-
tantly, in interpreting these data, it must be kept in mind 
that not every stroke is attributable to AT/AF,21,22 and 
the RATE Registry population has other risk factors for 
stroke, including age, atherosclerotic vascular disease, 
diabetes, and hypertension.

cOnclUsiOns
Given the low risk of stroke observed in this and similar 
studies, the finding of a long episode of AT/AF as de-
fined in RATE should not be used alone as an automatic 
indication for anticoagulation. Episodes seen in device 
diagnostics that last many hours are more worrisome 
because they are likely to be true positives and, in some 
published trials, only hours-long episodes were associat-
ed with higher risk. Because we and others have studied 
device-detected AT/AF, in part, to determine whether the 
clinical implications of this finding are similar to those 
when AT/AF is found on a 12-lead ECG, we make the 
assumption that the treatment effect with oral anticoagu-
lation or other therapies would be similar as well. This 
assumption, although reasonable, remains untested. 
Because of the observations in TRENDS,23 ASSERT,24 
IMPACT,20 and in the paper by Shanmugam19 of poor 
temporal correspondence between device-documented 
AT/AF and stroke, it may not be safe to assume that a 
patient with a previous prolonged episode of AT/AF but 
no further episodes during additional observation is at 
low risk. Our unique finding that patients with only short 
episodes of AT/AF were not at increased risk of clinical 
events is reassuring and should help clinicians to further 
resolve the anticoagulation recommendations published 
in society guidelines and avoid overreaction to such find-
ings. The results of our study suggest that immediate an-
ticoagulation in patients with only short episodes of AT/
AF is unlikely to result in reduction of the risk of stroke, 
at least during a 2-year follow-up. Scrutiny of such pa-
tients for the appearance of longer episodes is impor-
tant because many will progress over time.
