Purpose
Dietary fat may play a role in lung carcinogenesis. Findings from epidemiologic studies, however,
remain inconsistent. In this pooled analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies from the United States,
Europe, and Asia, we evaluated the associations of total and specific types of dietary fat with lung
cancer risk.
Methods
Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs in each cohort. Study-specific
risk estimates were pooled by random- or fixed-effects meta-analysis. The first 2 years of follow-up
were excluded to address potential influence of preclinical dietary changes.
Results
Among 1,445,850 participants, 18,822 incident cases were identified (mean follow-up, 9.4 years).
High intakes of total and saturated fat were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (for
highest v lowest quintile: HR, 1.07 and 1.14, respectively; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.15 and 1.07 to 1.22,
respectively; P for trend for both , .001). The positive association of saturated fat was more evident
among current smokers (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.35; P for trend , .001) than former/never
smokers (P for interaction = .004), and for squamous cell and small cell carcinoma (HR, 1.61 and
1.40, respectively; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.88 and 1.17 to 1.67, respectively; P for trend for both , .001)
than other histologic types (P for heterogeneity , .001). In contrast, a high intake of polyunsaturated
fat was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98 for highest v
lowest quintile; P for trend = .02). A 5% energy substitution of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat
was associated with a 16% to 17% lower risk of small cell and squamous cell carcinoma. No
associations were found for monounsaturated fat.
Conclusion
Findings from this large, international cohort consortium suggest that modifying dietary fat intake (ie,
replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat) may reduce lung cancer risk, particularly among
smokers and for squamous cell and small cell carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, the most common cancer in the
world, accounts for about 13% of total cancer
cases and 20% of cancer-related deaths worldwide
annually.1 Although the vast majority of lung
cancer is explained by tobacco smoking,2 dietary
factors have also been suggested to influence lung
cancer risk.3 The World Cancer Research Fund/
American Institute for Cancer Research considers
fruit and other foods containing carotenoids as
probable protective factors,4,5 whereas red or
processed meat, total fat, and butter have been
suggested as possible risk factors.4 Emerging
evidence further indicates that specific types of fat
(ie, saturated, monounsaturated, and poly-
unsaturated fat) may play different roles in lung
carcinogenesis.6 Findings from epidemiologic
studies, however, remain inconsistent. Several
case-control studies reported that saturated fat was
associated with a higher risk for lung cancer in
men and in nonsmoking, white women.7-10 A few
prospective cohort studies also found a positive
association with saturated fat among men, espe-
cially heavy smokers11,12; however, other cohort
studies observed no association.13-15 Evidence

 cancer is also inconsistent. Some case-control studies8,10 and
prospective studies11,13 suggested that total unsaturated or mono-
unsaturated fat is positively associated with lung cancer risk among
men. In contrast, a significantly lower risk of lung cancer was linked
with higher consumptions of plant-based fat (mostly unsaturated
fat)15 and fish (a source of polyunsaturated fat).16 Overall, evidence
from prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses is elusive re-
garding the association of specific types of dietary fat with lung
cancer.11,13-15,17
In this study, we investigated the association between dietary
fat intake and the risk of lung cancer, using data pooled from 10
prospective cohort studies in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
We evaluated the associations between total and specific types of
dietary fat intakes and lung cancer risk overall, and by smoking
status, sex, race/ethnicity, and histologic type.
METHODS
Study Populations
This analysis includes individual-level data from 10 prospective
cohorts: the National Institutes of Health-AARP Study,18 Health Pro-
fessionals’ Follow-up Study,19 Iowa Women’s Health Study,20 Nurses’
Health Study,21 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial,22 Southern Community Cohort Study,23 Vitamins and Lifestyle
Study,24 European Prospective Investigation into Cancer & Nutrition,25
Shanghai Men’s Health Study,26 and Shanghai Women’s Health Study.27 All
studies were approved by institutional review boards at local institutions.
The current study only involved analyzing de-identified information.
In each study, we excluded participants who had a history of any
cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer, who did not report smoking
status, and who reported implausible energy intake. Implausible energy
intake was determined by predefined ranges in five cohorts (Health
Professionals’ Follow-up Study, Iowa Women’s Health Study, Nurses’
Health Study, Southern Community Cohort Study, and Vitamins and
Lifestyle Study) or by cohort- and sex-specific ranges (beyond three
standard deviations of the log-transformed mean energy intake). To
minimize potential influence due to preclinical diseases and/or dietary
changes, we also excluded the first 2 years of follow-up, including partic-
ipants who died, developed any cancer, or were lost to follow-up within
2 years. Final study populations for our analysis are summarized in Table 1.
Dietary Assessment
Dietary information at baseline was assessed by using validated food
frequency questionnaires or quantitative dietary questionnaires.28-38 Based
on study-specific food composition tables, each study estimated daily
intakes of total energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat (ie, total, saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat).
Outcome Assessment
Incident cases of lung cancer were ascertained per each study pro-
tocol, via active and/or passive follow-up methods, including data linkage
to cancer and death registries and self-reports confirmed by medical record
review. Based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
lung cancers were classified into five histologic types: adenocarcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, other kinds of non-small cell carcinoma, small
cell carcinoma, and others, including carcinoma not otherwise specified,
sarcoma, and any kind of uncertain types.
Statistical Analysis
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated in each cohort
by fitting the Cox proportional hazards models. Proportional hazard
assumption was tested using time-by-covariate interactions and no evi-
dence of violation was found. All models were stratified by baseline age
groups and enrollment years (both in 5-year intervals). Follow-up time was
treated as the time scale, calculated as the total time from 730 days (2 years)
after enrollment until the date of diagnosis of any cancer, date of death, end
of follow-up, or follow-up loss, whichever came first. Intakes of macro-
nutrients were analyzed as percentages of total energy intake.39 Dietary
fat intakes were modeled as categorical variables using cohort- and sex-
specific quintiles, with the lowest quintile as reference. Linear trend tests
were conducted using the Wald test, with continuous values corresponding
to the median value for each quintile. Risk estimates from each study were
pooled based on their inverse variance weights. Heterogeneity across the
studies was evaluated by the Q and I2 statistics.40-42 We adopted random-
effects models if P for heterogeneity was , .10,42 or fixed-effect models
when observing no evidence for heterogeneity.
Covariates were selected based on prior knowledge of putative risk
factors for lung cancer and their associations with lung cancer risk in the
current study. Included were age (continuous), sex, smoking status (never,
former, current), smoking pack-years (continuous), family history of lung
cancer, race/ethnicity (white, black, Asian, others), educational attainment
(less than high school, high school graduate, vocational/professional ed-
ucation, college education, university graduate, graduate studies), alcohol
consumption (0 g/d, . 0 to # 28 g/d in men; or . 0 to # 14 g/d in
women; . 28 g/d in men; or . 14 g/d in women), physical activity (tertiles
of leisure time or total activity measured by hours or metabolic equivalent
hours), obesity status (body mass index [BMI] , 18.5, 18.5 to 24.9, 25 to
29.9, $ 30 kg/m2; results remained the same if Asian-specific BMI cutoff
points were used for Asian population), total vegetable intake (cohort- and
sex-specific quintiles), and menopausal status in women.
We conducted all analyses using multivariate nutrient-density models
that included total energy intake, percentage of energy from fat, and all
aforementioned covariates.39 To estimate the association for specific type
of fat, saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats were mu-
tually adjusted. The results can be interpreted as the substitution effects of
energy from total or a particular type of fat for equivalent energy from
carbohydrate and protein. Furthermore, to evaluate effect of a 5% energy
substitution, we modeled specific fat intakes as continuous variables and
estimated substitution effects by calculating the difference in the co-
efficients of the two targeted fats.43
In addition, we pooled individual data into a single dataset and
conducted aggregated pooled-analyses. Interactions between fat and
smoking status, sex, and race/ethnicity were evaluated by likelihood ratio
test. Heterogeneity across histologic types of lung cancer was evaluated.
Possible nonlinear relationship between dietary fat and lung cancer was
evaluated with the restricted cubic spline regression. To reduce influences
due to extreme values, participants with the highest 1% of each fat intake
were excluded from the analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses was
conducted, including using the residual method to adjust for total energy
intake, using project-wide sex-specific quintiles instead of cohort- and sex-
specific cutoffs, and further adjusting for red meat intake, a major food
source of total and saturated fat as well as a putative lung cancer risk
factor.44,45
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) and STATA 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All P values were two
sided and statistical significance was set at .05.
RESULTS
Among a total of 1,445,850 participants (627,988 men and 817,862
women, after excluding the first 2 years of follow-up), 18,822
primary, incident lung cancer cases were identified over follow-up
periods of 4.3 to 20.7 years. Mean intakes of total fat ranged from
15.5% to 34.9% of energy across studies. Substantially lower in-
takes of all types of fat were observed in Asian populations than

 those in the United States and European populations (Table 1;
Appendix Table A1, online only).
At baseline, participants who reported a higher fat intake had
a higher BMI and lower levels of education and physical activity
(Table 2). Prevalence of current smoking and cumulative lifetime
tobacco exposure was significantly higher among people with high
fat intakes. All differences across total fat intake were statistically
significant, and these patterns were consistently observed in men
and women.
After adjusting for potential confounders, total and saturated
fat showed significant associations with an increased risk of lung
cancer (HR [95% CI] in the highest v lowest quintile, 1.07 [1.00 to
1.15] and 1.14 [1.07 to 1.22], respectively; P for trend for both
, .001; Table 3). Conversely, polyunsaturated fat was associated
with a decreased risk of lung cancer (HR [95% CI], 0.92 [0.87 to
0.98]; P for trend = .02). There was no evidence of heterogeneity
across studies (Table 3; Appendix Fig A1, online only). When
stratified by smoking status, significant associations were observed
only among ever smokers (P for trend , .001 for total and sat-
urated fat and P for trend = .03 for polyunsaturated fat). No
associations were found for monounsaturated fat (Table 3).
The association of saturated fat with lung cancer risk appeared
stronger among current smokers (HR [95% CI], 1.23 [1.13 to
1.35]; P for trend , .001; Table 4) than former and never smokers
(P for interaction = .004), and for squamous cell carcinoma and
small cell carcinoma (HR [95% CI], 1.61 [1.38 to 1.88] and 1.40
[1.17 to 1.67], respectively; P for trend for both , .001) than other
histologic types (P for heterogeneity , .001). This histologic-
specific association pattern existed regardless of smoking status,
although the point estimates among never smokers did not reach
statistical significance. Stratified analyses on polyunsaturated fat
and lung cancer did not show significant interactions except that
the association seemed more evident among Asians (HR [95% CI],
0.80 [0.66 to 0.96]; P for trend = .03) than other races (P for
interaction = .04; Appendix Table A2, online only).
Restricted cubic spline analyses indicated linear associations of
saturated fat (positive) and polyunsaturated fat (inverse) with lung
cancer (Fig 1). Given the differential association between these two
fats, we evaluated isocaloric substitution effects of saturated fat
with polyunsaturated fat (Table 4). Every 5% energy substitution
was associated with an overall 12% lower risk of lung cancer (95%
CI, 0.84 to 0.93). The beneficial effect was primarily found among
current smokers and former smokers (especially those who quit
smoking # 10 years before). Noticeably, a 5% energy substitution
was associated with a 17% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma
(95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93) and a 16% lower risk of small cell carcinoma
(95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95).
Results from aggregated analyses were basically the same as
main results from meta-analyses (Appendix Table A3, online only).

DISCUSSION
In this pooled analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies, we found
that high intakes of total or saturated fat were associated with an
increased risk of lung cancer, particularly for squamous cell and
small cell carcinoma. Specifically, the highest quintile of saturated
fat intake showed a 61% higher risk for squamous cell carcinoma
and a 40% higher risk for small cell carcinoma, compared with
the lowest quintile. In contrast, a high intake of polyunsaturated
fat was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer. Isocaloric
replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat (5% of
energy) was associated with an overall 12% lower risk of lung
cancer. Monounsaturated fat was not associated with lung cancer
risk. Results did not change with the use of alternative analytic
approaches and in a series of sensitivity analyses.
Despite controversy, saturated fat has been suggested to play
an adverse role in the development of various cancers, including
lung cancer.11,12,46-49 Significant positive association of saturated
fat and lung cancer has been observed in case-control studies7-10 as
well as in several, but not all, prospective studies.11-15 A previous
pooled analysis of eight cohort studies among Western, pre-
dominantly white populations reported that a higher intake of
saturated fat was associated with lung cancer risk in age-adjusted
model (relative risk [RR] 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.36 per 5% energy
increase),14 although the association was attenuated after adjusting

 for lifestyle factors and smoking history. Previous studies have also
suggested that the association between saturated fat intake and lung
cancer may be more evident among smokers,11,12 especially male
smokers and heavy smokers. In the current study, we found
a significant interaction between smoking status and saturated fat
intake in relation to lung cancer risk. The positive association of
saturated fat and the beneficial association of substituting saturated
with polyunsaturated fats were primarily seen among current
smokers and former smokers who quit # 10 years before. Al-
though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown,
potential biologic interaction between saturated fat and smoking
was supported by animal studies. Nicotine-derived nitrosamine
ketone (NNK) is a potent tobacco carcinogen.50 NNK promotes
lung carcinogenesis by inducing cyclooxygenase-2, disrupting
arachidonic acid signaling, and activating tumorigenic path-
ways.50 Noticeably, these tumor-promoting effects of NNK
were found to be enhanced by a high-fat diet.51,52 Moreover,
emerging evidence indicates that saturated fat itself may increase
carcinogenesis by regulating DNA damage and inflammatory
responses.53,54

Dietary Fat Intake and Lung Cancer Risk

 In our study, we found that saturated fat was primarily as-
sociated with an increased risk of squamous cell and small cell
carcinoma. Overall, the highest quintile of saturated fat intake
exhibited a 40% to 61% higher risk. This histologic-specific pattern
was also observed among never smokers, although the point es-
timates did not reach statistical significance. The nonsignificant
association among never smokers might be due to a small number
of cases for histologic type-specific analyses. Indeed, analyses
without excluding the first 2 years of follow-up showed significant
associations of saturated fat with squamous cell carcinoma (HR,
2.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.47; P for trend = .04) and small cell
carcinoma (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 0.94 to 5.93; P for trend = .005)
among never smokers. This finding is in line with one previous
report,10 but in contrast with two case-control studies that reported
the positive association of saturated fat appeared stronger for
adenocarcinoma.7,8 Considering that smoking is more strongly
associated with squamous cell and small cell carcinoma than other
histologic types (ie, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma),55 it is
plausible that the adverse effects of saturated fat may be more
pronounced for these histologic types of lung cancer. On the other
hand, residual confounding from smoking could not be entirely
excluded. Further studies are needed to examine the potential in-
terplays between saturated fat intake, smoking, and different types of
lung cancer, as well as the underlying biologic mechanisms.
Potential beneficial health effects of polyunsaturated fat have
been widely discussed, but its association with lung cancer remains
unclear. Previous cohort studies have yielded inconsistent but
mostly null findings on the association between polyunsaturated
fat and lung cancer.11-13,15 One study found a significant inverse
association between a high intake of fat from plant foods, pre-
dominantly unsaturated fats, and lung cancer incidence (RR, 0.7;
95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9 for the highest v lowest quartile).15 The pre-
viously referenced pooled analysis14 found no association of
polyunsaturated fat with lung cancer risk. A recent meta-analysis
including eight prospective studies reported a nonsignificant,
decreased lung cancer risk with high polyunsaturated fat intake
(RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.06 for the highest v lowest category).17
Our current study, the largest study on this topic thus far, to our
knowledge, showed polyunsaturated fat intake was inversely as-
sociated with lung cancer risk. We further found that substituting
energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat may reduce
lung cancer risk. In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested several
potential cancer inhibitory effects of polyunsaturated fat, especially
n-3-polyunsaturated fat, including as an inhibitor for arachidonic
acid and cyclooxygenase-2, an inflammatory mediator, and
a suppressor of fatty acid synthase.6,51,56,57 N-3-polyunsaturated fat
may also affect cytokine production and inflammatory gene ex-
pression.57 However, the role of n-6-polyunsaturated fat in car-
cinogenesis remains controversial. This study could not explore
potential associations for specific polyunsaturated fats because of
a lack of detailed information. Future studies focused on subtypes
of polyunsaturated fat and their roles in the development of lung
cancer are warranted.
As with other nutritional epidemiologic studies, measurement
errors in dietary assessment are a concern, although the ques-
tionnaires used in participating cohorts have been validated and
shown good validity.28-38 Furthermore, most participating cohorts
have only collected dietary information at baseline and the single
dietary assessment prohibited us from evaluating the influence of
possible dietary changes over time. In the few cohorts that have
conducted multiple dietary surveys, models using only baseline
diet seemed to yield similar or weaker results compared with
models using cumulative diet.58,59 Lack of information on subtypes
of polyunsaturated fat is also a study limitation, as mentioned
previously. We believe, however, that these potential measurement
errors are nondifferential with respect to lung cancer status, given
our prospective study design, and that our analytic strategies
minimize the effect of potential bias on study results. The first 2
years of follow-up were excluded from analyses and cohort- and
sex-specific cutoffs of dietary intakes were used to reduce the
potential influences of reverse causation and varied dietary mea-
sures. All associations were evaluated with comprehensive ad-
justments for lung cancer risk factors, including smoking status
and amount, dietary, and other nondietary factors, and results
from sensitivity analyses were consistent with overall results.
Nevertheless, we cannot rule out residual confounding by im-
perfectly measured covariates (eg, smoking) and unadjusted
potential confounders (eg, trans-fat), nor could we distinguish
the effect of fat from that of other nutrients and chemicals in fat-
rich foods (eg, red meat) that may influence lung cancer risk.
However, we have adjusted for total vegetable intake in our
analysis, and the results did not change after further adjusting for
red meat intake.
To our knowledge, this study is the largest prospective in-
vestigation on dietary fat intake and lung cancer risk to date,
including six times as many cases as the previous pooled analysis14
and seven studies that have not been part of any previous pooled or
meta-analyses. Moreover, our study includes diverse populations of
whites, blacks, and Asians from three continents and provides
evidence suggesting potentially different roles of saturated and
polyunsaturated fats in the development of lung cancer.
In conclusion, findings from this large, international cohort
consortium indicate that a high intake of saturated fat and a low
intake of polyunsaturated fat are associated with an increased risk
of lung cancer. Substituting saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat
may reduce lung cancer risk, especially among smokers and for
squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. Although the apparent
benefit is relatively small compared with smoking avoidance and
cessation, our study suggests that promoting polyunsaturated fat
while reducing saturated fat intake, especially among current
smokers and recent quitters, may present a modifiable dietary
approach to the prevention of not only cardiovascular disease but
also lung cancer.

*Based on the cohort- and sex-specific quintiles.
†Hazard ratios were estimated in aggregated pooled-analyses. Models were stratified by cohort, baseline age group, and enrollment year and adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, smoking pack-years, family history of
lung cancer, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, obesity status, intakes of total energy and vegetable, and menopausal status in women. Specific types of fat were
mutually adjusted. The results indicate the risk of lung cancer when substituting energy from polyunsaturated fat for equivalent energy from carbohydrate and protein.
