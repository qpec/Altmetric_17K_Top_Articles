Abstract
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 % of the
population over 65 years of age. Dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra and accumulation of Lewy bodies
are the defining neuropathological hallmarks of the disease. Neuronal death and dysfunction have been reported in
other central nervous system regions, including the retina. Symptoms of PD typically manifest only when more
than 70 % of dopaminergic cells are lost, and the definitive diagnosis of PD can only be made histologically at
post-mortem, with few biomarkers available.
In this study, a rotenone-induced rodent model of PD was employed to investigate retinal manifestations in PD
and their usefulness in assessing the efficacy of a novel therapeutic intervention with a liposomal formulation of
the PPAR-γ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist rosiglitazone.
Retinal assessment was performed using longitudinal in vivo imaging with DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells)
and OCT (optical coherence tomography) technologies and revealed increased RGCs (Retinal Ganglion Cells) apoptosis
and a transient swelling of the retinal layers at day 20 of the rotenone insult. Follow-up of this model demonstrated
characteristic histological neurodegenerative changes in the substantia nigra and striatum by day 60, suggesting that
retinal changes precede the “traditional” pathological manifestations of PD. The therapeutic effect of systemic
administration of different formulations of rosiglitazone was then evaluated, both in the retina and the brain. Of all
treatment regimen tested, sustained release administration of liposome-encapsulated rosiglitazone proved to be
the most potent therapeutic strategy, as evidenced by its significant neuroprotective effect on retinal neurons at
day 20, and on nigrostriatal neurons at day 60, provided convincing evidence for its potential as a treatment for PD.
Our results demonstrate significant retinal changes occurring in this model of PD. We show that rosiglitazone can
efficiently protect retinal neurons from the rotenone insult, and that systemic administration of liposome-
encapsulated rosiglitazone has an enhanced neuroprotective effect on the retina and CNS (Central Nervous
System). To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence of RGCs loss and early retinal thickness alterations in a

may be used to assess new treatments both experimentally and clinically.

Introduction
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common
neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s [1], and a
major cause of neurological disability in individuals over
65 years of age. PD is characterised by the loss of dopa-
minergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia
nigra (SNpc) and the presence of intracytoplasmic inclu-
sions called Lewy bodies (LBs), which consist of accu-
mulations
of
both
α-synuclein
and
ubiquitin
[2].
Together, these pathological hallmarks lead to the car-
dinal symptoms of PD: bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity,
and postural instability. LBs are also present in other re-
gions of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to
non-motor symptoms such as depression, sleep disor-
ders, constipation, olfactory and visual dysfunction, and
dementia. These are observed in 90 % of PD patients
surviving 20 years [3]. Notably, Parkinsonism and PD
sufferers become symptomatic only when approximately
70–80 % of dopaminergic cells are lost [4]. Hence early
diagnosis and early treatment are crucial to prevent/
delay disease progression, through preservation of dopa-
minergic cells.
Several toxin-based models for induction of PD path-
ology in rodents, through selective degeneration of
dopaminergic cells, have been described, including ad-
ministration of MPTP (1-methyl-4–phenyl-1,2,3,6-tet-
rahydropyridine), rotenone, or proteasome inhibitors
[5]. Rotenone inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain, resulting in increased oxida-
tive stress and reduced ATP synthesis, which ultimately
activate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways.
Both pulsatile and chronic administration of rotenone
in vivo and in vitro is reported to induce degeneration
of nigrostriatal neurons, with formation of cytoplasmic
inclusions similar to Lewy bodies, oxidative damage,
parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity [5–8].
The occurrence of ocular manifestations in many neu-
rodegenerative diseases, including PD, emphasizes the
strong connection between the brain and the retina. In-
deed, PD patients often suffer from visual symptoms
such as reduced visual acuity, low contrast sensitivity
and disturbed colour vision [9, 10]. In particular, recent
findings have highlighted the retina as a potential bio-
marker for PD. Thinning of the inner retinal layer has
shown to be an early event in patients with early PD,
where early disease was defined as diagnosis within
2.5 years with an average disease stage of 2 (Hoehn–
Yahr scale) [11, 12]. The severity of PD symptoms corre-
lates with RNFL thickness [13, 14]. Functional changes
in the retina have also been recorded in early PD (grade
1–1.5 Hoehn–Yahr scale, diagnosed within 3 years) [15]
with some suggestion that RGCs are involved early [16].
Finally, using the retina as a biomarker is currently being
investigated (NCT02443779, NCT02640339), and has
already
been
used
in
some
PD
treatment
trials
(NCT02233023, NCT00144300). Retinal imaging tech-
nologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT),
confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO), and
fluorescence ophthalmoloscopy offer a non-invasive, ob-
jective opportunity to measure retinal alterations in real-
time. Their application to neurodegenerative diseases in
the CNS may yield novel diagnostic tests and more rapid
and quantitative end-points to assess the efficacy of
therapeutic interventions. One such technique is DARC
(Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells), which utilizes
fluorescently labelled Annexin A5 for the in vivo visualisa-
tion of apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) [17, 18].
DARC represents a technique to quantify the extent of
RGC neurodegenerative activity, which may prove useful
for monitoring neurodegenerative disease onset and
progression. In addition, this technique permits the in-
vestigation of the neuroprotective efficacy of promising
agents in real time.
Rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione drug
family, originally used to counter insulin resistance in
type 2 diabetes, has recently shown promise as a therapy
in animal models of PD [19–26]. Rosiglitazone therapy
is reported to promote an anti-inflammatory response,
with attenuation of microglial activation, release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, astrocytic gliosis
and reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase - a crucial
enzyme for dopamine metabolism [19–21, 23, 24, 27]. The
outcomes of clinical investigations of thiazolidinedione
therapies for the treatment of PD have so far been com-
plex. While administration of these agents is reported to
not slow disease progression [28], diabetic patients receiv-
ing glitazone treatment exhibited a 28 % reduced inci-
dence of PD [29]. One interpretation of this data is that
thiazolidinedione therapy may be effective for the treat-
ment of pre-symptomatic but not established PD, when
the majority of dopaminergic cells are lost.
The aim of this study is to determine, using a rotenone-
induced rodent model of PD, whether firstly, retinal im-
aging can identify quantifiable changes including retinal

 layer thickness (OCT) and RGC apoptotic counts (DARC)
in the natural history of the disease; and secondly, if these
changes can be used as surrogate biomarkers, and applied
to assessing a potential PD treatment strategy.
Materials and methods
Isolation and culture of primary rat mixed retinal cultures
Rat pups aged 3 to 5 days (P3-P5) were sacrificed, and
eyes removed and placed in ice-cold calcium- and
magnesium-free Hank’s buffered salt solution (Thermo-
Fisher). Retinas were dissected from the eye cup under a
microscope, 10 retinas were pooled and treated with
trypsin (0.1 % v/v; Sigma-Alrich) for 15 min at 37 °C
with gentle agitation. Upon centrifugation (120 g, 1 min)
and resuspension in Eagle’s minimum essential medium
(Sigma-Aldrich), pooled retinas were subject to mech-
anical dissociation via gentle pipetting. Cell density was
determined using a trypan blue exclusion assay (Sigma-
Aldrich) and haemocytometry. Mixed retinal cultures
were plated at a density of 3x105 cells/well on a Poly-
D-lysine (0.1 mg; Sigma-Aldrich) coated 96-well plate
and cultured (37 °C, 5 % CO2) until 70 % confluency
before use in cell viability experiments.
In vitro cell viability assays
To determine whether rosiglitazone therapy was protec-
tive against rotenone insult, rat mixed retinal cultures
were insulted for 48 h with IC50 concentrations of rote-
none (75 nM). Rosiglitazone stock solutions were pre-
pared by first solubilising in DMSO to a concentration
of 100 mM before diluting in cell culture medium to the
desired concentration. Cells were treated with 2.5 μM,
5 μM or 10 μM rosiglitazone for the second 24 h of the
48 h rotenone insult. The final concentration of DMSO
was less than 0.01 % (v/v). Viability of rat mixed retinal
cultures was assessed using the AlamarBlue (Invitrogen)
cell viability assay according to manufacturers instruc-
tions. Briefly, 10 μl AlamarBlue solution was added to
each well-plate and incubated for 2.5 h after which time
the intensity of AlamarBlue fluorescence (Excitation
570 nm/Emission 585 nm) was recorded from which
percentage cell viability was determined using equation 2;

Formulation of rosiglitazone for IP administration
Owing to the limited water solubility of rosiglitazone
(LogP

for
in
vivo
IP
administration a suspension of rosiglitazone was prepared
by dissolving rosiglitazone in corn oil (Fluorochem) to a
concentration of 0.6 mg/ml.
To avoid the use of corn oil and DMSO, a solvent we
have previous shown to induce toxicity [30], Rosiglita-
zone loaded liposomes were prepared using an adapta-
tion of the lipid film hydration technique described
previously [31]. Briefly, 130 mM of egg phosphatidyl-
choline and cholesterol (both Avanti Polar Lipids) of
desired molar ratio (PC90%Cholesterol10%) were dis-
solved in chloroform: methanol (1:1 ratio; Sigma-
Aldrich). Rosiglitazone (dissolved in the same solvent)
was added to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml, before
drying under a stream of oxygen-free argon until a thin
film was formed. The lipid film was further dried
under
vacuum
for
1
h,
before
rehydration
with
phosphate-buffered
saline
(0.01

while
warming to 45 °C with gentle mixing. The resulting
multilamellar liposome solution was subject to 4 x
10 min ultrasonication and the resulting liposome
suspension stabilised by incubation at 4 °C overnight.
Unencapsulated rosiglitazone was removed from the
liposome suspension by passing through a 0.22 μm
pore filter (Sigma Aldrich) and the resulting liposome
suspension was used immediately.
Spectroscopic determination of rosiglitazone concen-
tration in liposome suspensions was achieved by diluting
liposome suspensions in dimethyl sulphoxide (Sigma-
Aldrich) and measuring the absorbance at 313 nm (on
correcting for absorbance due to the lipid fraction),
using an experimentally determined molar extinction
coefficient for rosiglitazone of 4078 L.M−1.cm−1 in the
same solvent system. The rosiglitazone content of lipo-
somes was determined spectroscopically before and
after 0.22 μm filtration and the percentage of incorpor-
ation determined using equation 1, where [R]A is the
concentration of rosiglitazone after filtration and [R]B is
the concentration before filtration;

 Dark Agouti rats (DA), 150–200 g, were acclimatised for
a minimum of 7 days before the start of the treatment,
and housed in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with unlim-
ited access to food and water. In vivo experiments were
conducted under general anaesthesia (IP) with 75 mg/kg
(Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health) and 0.5 mg/kg
(Domitor; Pfizer).
Rotenone-induced model of PD
A rotenone rat model of PD was induced as previously
described [32]. Treatment regimens are described as
below:
– Group 1 (n = 10): daily intraperitoneal (IP) rotenone
(2.5 mg/kg in glyceryl trioctanoate, Sigma-Aldrich)
administration up to 60 days (Rot60).
– Group 2 (n = 10): daily IP administration of vehicle
(1 mL/kg glyceryl trioctanoate, Sigma-Aldrich) up
to 60 days (CONTROL).
– Group 3 (n = 6): daily rotenone administration (see
above) for 10 days, followed by a 10-days recovery
period during which the animals did not receive any
substances (ROT10).
– Group 4 (n = 6): daily rotenone administration for
10 days, followed by daily rosiglitazone treatment
(IP 3 mg/kg in corn oil; Fluorochem) for 10 days
(Rosiglitazone Intervention Group, RIG10).
– Group 5 (n = 6): daily rotenone for 10 days, followed
by a single IP injection of liposome-encapsulated
rosiglitazone (1 ml/kg; encapsulated in PC90%
Cholesterol10% liposomes at a concentration of
1.4 mg/ml rosiglitazone) (Liposome Encapsulated
Rosiglitazone, LER10).
– Group 6 (n = 5): daily administration of both
rotenone and rosiglitazone for 60 days (RCG60).
– Group 7 (n = 5): daily rotenone administration for
60 days, and concomitant administration of
liposome-encapsulated rosiglitazone (1 ml/kg) every
3 days for 60 days (LER60).
– Group 8 (n = 5): administration of empty liposomes
(1 ml/kg) every 3 days for 60 days (LIPO60).
In vivo imaging: DARC and OCT
A modified Heidelberg HRA-OCT Spectralis (Heidelberg
Engineering) was used for OCT imaging [33]. A posterior
pole scanning protocol, centred on the rat optic nerve head,
was obtained in each treatment group with TruTrack®
software (Heidelberg Engineering), to ensure pixel to
pixel correspondence over time. Mean retinal thickness
was determined using the HEYEX® thickness map ana-
lysis (Heidelberg Engineering), before rotenone admin-
istration and 10, 20, 40, and 60 days after the start of
the treatment regimen. Longitudinal changes in whole
retinal thickness were calculated as a percentage against
baseline. Individual layer thickness analysis was carried
out after masked manual segmentation of the retinal
nerve fibre layer (RNFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL),
inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL),
outer nuclear layer (ONL), and the inner and outer seg-
ments (IS/OS) of the photoreceptors.
DARC imaging was conducted in vivo at baseline and
day 10, 20, 40, and 60, using a technique described pre-
viously [18, 34, 35]. Briefly, the retina was imaged using
a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (HRA Spec-
tralis; Heidelberg Engineering) to obtain a baseline
image. Next, 2 h after intravitreal administration of
fluorescein Isothiocyanate-Annexin A5 (0.25 μg/ml; BD
Biosciences), apoptotic RGCs were visualised as bright
spots. These were counted manually by three masked
observers, deducting baseline autofluorescence spots as
described in [34].
Histological analysis
Rats were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by
cervical dislocation to ensure death. Upon cardiac perfu-
sion with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich),
brains were isolated, post-fixated in 4 % paraformalde-
hyde (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μm paraffin-embedded sec-
tions were made. For immunohistological detection of
tyrosine hydroxylase, sections were rehydrated, endogen-
ous peroxidases were blocked in 3 % H2O2, and antigen
retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (10 mM,
pH 6.0) at 90 °C for 15 min. Endogenous proteins were
then blocked in 5 % normal donkey serum (DAKO) for
1 h, before antibody incubation was carried out over-
night at 4 °C (1:500 anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, MAB318,
Millipore). Visualisation was performed using a 3,3′-Di-
aminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Novolink Polymer Detection
System, Leica Biosystems) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions and sections were counterstained
with Harris haematoxylin (Leica biosystems). Images
were
acquired
with
an
epifluorescence
microscope
(BX50; Olympus) and photographed (U-TVIX; Olym-
pus). For quantification of TH positive cells, manual
counts of positively stained cells was performed by three
masked operators for each section using the “multipoint
selection tool” of FIJI software (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, http://
fiji.sc/Fiji) [36]. Counts were exported to GraphPad
Prism ver. 5.00 for Microsoft Windows (GraphPad Soft-
ware, San Diego, CA, USA) and the mean was calculated
with SEM for statistical analysis.
Optical density of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum
was quantified using FIJI software (Fiji Is Just ImageJ,
http://fiji.sc/Fiji). Optical density is considered as a reliable
method to asses fibres density and to detect changes [37].
Automatic DAB colour deconvolution was used to isolate
the TH channel. Striatum area was identified and mean
grey pixel intensity recorded [38]. Optical density

 measures were determined in every striatal section
from each rat brain. To measure staining density in the
striatum, optical density measures included the entire
striatal region of each section [39].
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, all values are mean ± Standard
Error. Longitudinal comparison of results from OCT
and DARC measurements was performed via a one-way
ANOVA with repeated measurements by row; all other
experimental data were analysed via a one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests. P-values <0.05 were con-
sidered significant, with *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005.
Significant deviations of retinal layer thickness from
baseline values (set at 100 %) were calculated with a
one-sample t-test, and are indicated with #. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software).
Results
The rotenone-induced model of PD is associated with
specific retinal changes over time
In order to characterise the natural history of retinal in-
volvement in the rotenone model, retinal imaging was
performed at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 days after IP rotenone
administration, and showed significant changes in the
retina that evolved over time (Fig. 1a-d). Rotenone treated
animals exhibited elevated RGC apoptosis compared to
vehicle controls which peaked at day 20 (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 1b-d). No significant difference was found between
30 and 60 days compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 1b).
Whole retinal thickness, as measured by OCT, was
significantly increased in rotenone animals compared to
vehicle controls at 10 and 20 days (p < 0.005; p < 0.001),
with a maximal difference observed at 20 days of rotenone
administration (Fig. 1e). No significant difference between
rotenone and control animals was found at any other time
point. Segmentation of retinal layers from OCT images
revealed a significant increase in RNFL thickness in
rotenone-treated eyes compared to control at 10, 20 and
40 days (p < 0.005; p < 0;001; p < 0.05), with peak RNFL
thickening at 20 days (Fig. 1f). No significant thickening
of the ONL was found over the course of the study
(Fig. 1g). However, the thickness of the photoreceptor
layer (IS/OS) was significantly increased in the rotenone-
treated rats at 10 and 20 days (p < 0.05; p < 0.001), with a
subsequent thinning at 60 days (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1h).
Retinal changes occur before CNS changes in the
rotenone-induced PD model
Histological assessment of animal brains was performed
in the same animals. As in post mortem specimens from
human PD patients, a significant reduction in the num-
ber of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons was
observed in the substantia nigra (SN) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2a, d)
and significant reduction in DAB striatum intensity was
observed (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2b, d) in rotenone-treated rats
at 60 days. No significant change in gross histological
TH staining was observed after 10 or 20 days of rotenone
administration. Systemic administration of rotenone, in-
cluding intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperi-
toneal (I.P.) has been found to induce the formation of
α-syn cytoplasmatic particles in the substantia nigra of
treated rats in a similar manner to typical LB’s found in
PD [7, 40]. Our results (data not show) indicate a moder-
ate increase of AS staining in the SN of rats exposed to
rotenone for 60 days. However, a significant increase in
AS expression in the Rat RGCs 60 days post rotenone ad-
ministration was found as illustrated in Fig. 2c, d. Taken
with the in vivo findings reported above, this highlights
the fact that significant changes in the retina occur before
the classical PD changes in the brain.
Rosiglitazone is neuroprotective to retinal cells in vitro
The neuroprotective effectiveness of rosiglitazone was
first assessed in vitro using mixed, primary rat retinal
cell cultures. Primary mixed retinal cultures were found
to be susceptible to rotenone-induced cytotoxicity, with
an IC50 of 75 nM after 48 h of exposure (Fig. 3a). Retinal
cultures were subsequently exposed to a 48-h rotenone
insult (75 nM) in conjunction with 0 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM
or 10 μM rosiglitazone treatment for 24 h (between 24
and 48 h of rotenone exposure) dissolved in DMSO. A
significant neuroprotective effect, counteracting rotenone-
induced cytotoxicity, was observed for 5 μM and 10 μM
rosiglitazone (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3b).
Rosiglitazone can be dissolved in a novel liposomal
formulation which is clinically translatable
As we have recently shown, due to significant toxicity
even at low concentrations, DMSO should be avoided
in vivo [30]. The lipophilic nature of rosiglitazone means
that it has previously been administered in vivo in oil
[41], but due to some drawbacks with the clinical applic-
ability of this methodology, we next attempted to dissolve
rosiglitazone in a novel liposomal formulation, which was
then characterised (Fig. 3c-f). Liposomal formulations
were prepared using the lipid film hydration technique.
After 0.22 μm filtration to remove unencapsulated rosigli-
tazone, formulation size and dispersion were characterised
using dynamic light scattering (average Z-diameter
154.2 nm, dispersity 0.267) and transmission electron
microscopy (Fig. 3c). Incorporation efficiency (IE) was
determined spectroscopically before and after filtration
to separate unencapsulated rosiglitazone and found to
be 40 % ± 6 % (Fig. 3d-f).

 Rosiglitazone is neuroprotective to the retina in short
term studies in rotenone-induced PD model
Having established that rosiglitazone is neuroprotective
in primary retinal cell cultures, we next evaluated its effi-
cacy in vivo in a short term study of the rotenone induced
rodent model of PD. Following a 10-days rotenone insult
(Fig. 4a), a significant reduction in RGC apoptosis was
observed at day 20 in rats that received a 10-days rosigli-
tazone treatment (RIG10), compared to those that did
not receive therapeutic intervention (Rot10) (p < 0.005)
(Fig. 4b-d). Furthermore, a liposomal rosiglitazone treated
animals (LER10) exhibited a significantly reduced apop-
totic RGC count versus those dosed with unencapsulated
rosiglitazone (RIG10, p < 0.01) or the rotenone vehicle
(control, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4b, e, f).
Assessment of OCT images confirmed a reduced
thickening of the whole retina in RIG10 and LER10 ver-
sus Rot10 animals (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4g-h). Subsequent ana-
lysis of individual layers revealed that rosiglitazone
reduced the rotenone induced thickening of the RNFL
(p < 0.005) and photoreceptor IS/OS (p < 0.005) (Fig. 4g-h).
Administration of the rotenone vehicle (control) was found
to induce a significant thinning of the whole retina, spe-
cifically the RNFL and ONL layers (Fig. 4g-h). This ob-
servation is in agreement with DARC results, suggesting
IP administered glyceryl trioctanoate can induce some
retinal toxicity.
Rosiglitazone effects can be determined in retina before
they are seen in the brain
Having established the neuroprotective effects of rosigli-
tazone therapy in the short term rotenone model of PD,
and the suitability of liposomal administration, we next
sought to determine whether the therapeutic effects of
systemic rosiglitazone observed in the retina at day 20,
could predict therapeutic efficacy in the SN and striatum
at day 60 (Fig. 5a). Quantification of TH positive cells in
the substantia nigra conducted in all four animal groups
confirmed a significant reduction in the number of TH
positive cells after 60 days of rotenone administration
(Fig. 5b). Furthermore, this analysis indicated a signifi-
cant difference (p < 0.05) in the number of TH positive
cells between LER60 and Rot60 herby confirming the
protective effect of encapsulated rosiglitazone on nigral
dopaminergic neurons in this PD model (Fig. 5b). In
agreement with results from the short-term model, con-
comitant administration of unencapsulated rosiglitazone
and rotenone for 60 days (RCG60) resulted in a protect-
ive effect in the SN which did not achieve significance
and was comparable to that achieved on administration
of liposomes in the absence of rosiglitazone (Lipo60)
(Fig. 5b). Together, these data indicate that systemic ad-
ministration of liposome rosiglitazone acts to preserve
TH positivity in the SN in the rotenone model of PD
and to a greater extent than more frequent administra-
tion of the unencapsulated drug. Liposomal rosiglitazone
therapy (LER60) was found to be more effective at pre-
serving TH positivity in the SN than unencapsulated
drug (RCG60) at 60 days (long term model). For the stri-
atum, objective intensity analysis of TH staining of the
efferent fibres of the dopaminergic neurons was con-
ducted showing a similar trend compared to the SN
however no significant change was seen (Fig. 5c). This
result correlates with observations in the retina at
20 days, where liposomal rosiglitazone (LER10) was
found to exhibit a greater neuroprotective activity than
daily administration of the unencapsulated drug (RIG10)
in the retina at 20 days (short term model) using DARC
and OCT (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4b, g).
Discussion
These results suggest assessments of retinal health with
OCT and DARC can be used to provide reliable indica-
tors of CNS health in a PD model of neurodegenerative
disease. Furthermore, the findings suggest that retinal
changes can be used as non-invasive and quantitative in-
dicators to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interven-
tions for the treatment of PD.
The treatment of animals with neurotoxins provides
important models for the study of the causes and the
molecular mechanisms involved in the death of dopa-
minergic neurons in PD. Although these toxins (e.g.
MPTP, paraquat, rotenone) induce PD-like neurodegen-
eration through different mechanisms, each of them pro-
duces different clinical and neuropathological effects,
and each is associated with its own advantages and dis-
advantages, with none perfectly mimicking disease. Simi-
larly, transgenic and viral vector-induced PD models, do
not have animals model representing all aspects of hu-
man disease. The choice of experimental PD model is
related to the specific mechanisms or effect being stud-
ied [42]. The rotenone model is known to reproduce
most of the motor defect signs and the histopathological
features

 epidemiological studies indicating a correlation between
PD and rotenone exposure. Furthermore, rotenone af-
fects the retina, with involvement of non-dopaminergic
neurons such as RGCs [45–48]. Finally, additional sup-
porting evidence for the use of a rotenone-induced rat
model of PD can be found in epidemiological studies,
which indicated a correlation between PD and rotenone
exposure in humans [49, 50].
As an extension of the CNS, the retina displays nu-
merous similarities to the brain in terms of cell types,
neural circuit organization and molecular signalling
pathways. Evidence for a strong association between
brain and retinal degeneration can be found in the oc-
currence of ocular manifestations in many neurodegen-
erative diseases, including PD [51]. As the underlying
mechanisms leading to cell death appear to be conserved
between the eye and brain, the retina may provide an
early indication of the degeneration elsewhere in the
CNS [52].
In this study, DARC imaging was used to demonstrate
an increase in RGC apoptosis in the retina of animals
subjected to daily systemic rotenone injections. In-
creased RGC apoptosis was observed at early time
points during the study, reaching significance at day 20.

60-days rotenone treatment (LER60), a neuroprotective effect on tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons is seen in the SN. This is not
the case when daily injections of unencapsulated rosiglitazone are given (RCG60). c A preservative trend of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive efferent
fibers in the striatum, in comparison to rotenone only (Rot60), vehicle (empty liposomes) and unencapsulated rosiglitazone (RCG60) rats, is also
seen in the striatum

Page 11 of 15
 In contrast, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and
their efferent fibres in the striatum was only observed at
day 60. This suggests that elevated RGC apoptosis could
be an early feature of PD, in line with findings in animal
models of other neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s disease, glaucoma and Leber’s hereditary
optic neuropathy (LHON) [53–55]. In addition, these re-
sults confirm previous in vitro and in vivo studies that
described a dose-dependent susceptibility of retinal neu-
rons to rotenone-induced cell death [56–58].
OCT analysis showed peak swelling of whole retina,
RNFL and photoreceptor IS/OS layers after 20 days of
rotenone administration. This was followed by a pro-
gressive thinning of the retina between day 20 and 60.
The occurrence of peak RGC apoptosis and concomitant
retinal swelling at 20 days could be a result of inflamma-
tion, as rotenone administration to retinal neuronal cells
in vitro is documented to promote the expression of
pro-inflammatory JNK and p38 MAPK pathways and PD
is inherently linked to neuroinflammatory components
[46, 59, 60]. Alternatively, increased mitochondrial bio-
genesis or axonal transport stasis preceding RGC loss
(RNFL thinning) may explain the observed retinal thick-
ening, a phenomenon previously described in the early
stages of LHON [61–63], a disease also characterized by
mitochondrial complex I dysfunction [54]. The patho-
logical process of swelling and thinning was most prom-
inently observed in the photoreceptor IS/OS, which may
be related to the fact that photoreceptors are highly
energy-demanding cells bearing a high density of mito-
chondria [64]. Rotenone administration appears to ini-
tially cause ellipsoid swelling, with a subsequent inner
segment thinning due to the loss of cellular mitochon-
dria. Other studies have supported these findings by
demonstrating neuronal swelling occurring early after
rotenone treatment [65], and have also provided histo-
logical evidence for substantial inner segment disruption
in a rat rotenone model of PD [56]. At present, clinical
OCT examination of PD patients has described progres-
sive RNFL thinning as the disease progresses [66–68].
The failure to identify RNFL thickening in PD patients
may be a result of the late stage at which the disease is
presently diagnosed.
Together, these results suggest that retinal changes
occur soon after the onset of disease in the rotenone
model of PD and that RGC apoptosis, retinal layer thick-
ness and photoreceptor health could provide early diag-
nostic markers for PD. Techniques such as DARC and
OCT could therefore have early diagnostic potential for
PD and provide early and quantitative endpoints for the
assessment of neuroprotective strategies.
DARC and OCT imaging technologies were next ap-
plied to assess the retinal neuroprotective effects of rosi-
glitazone. A significant neuroprotective effect of systemic
rosiglitazone administration on RGCs and dopaminergic
nigrostriatal neurons in the rat model of PD was found.
An explanation for the therapeutic effect of rosiglitazone
treatment is likely to be due to its PPAR-γ agonist activity,
resulting in mitigation of oxidative stress, reduced
microglia activation, diminished pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines release, and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis
[25, 69, 70]. These pathways have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of PD, suggesting a mechanism of action for
the benefit of PPAR-γ agonists in the treatment of early
PD reported here and elsewhere [19–26].
In order to enhance the solubility of rosiglitazone, a
novel homogeneous liposomal formulation was pre-
pared. Administration of this formulation in the rote-
none induced rat model of PD was found to result in a
greater neuroprotective effect in both the retina (day 20)
and brain (day 60) than daily administration of the
unencapsulated drug. The greater efficacy of liposomal
rosiglitazone formulations versus administration of the
unencapsulated drug could be a result of enhanced drug
bioavailability [71, 72]. Several studies have shown great
therapeutic potential for liposome incorporated neuro-
protective agents, such as NGF, GDNF and minocycline
[73–75]. An alternative explanation is a synergistic effect
between rosiglitazone and phosphatidylcholine, which
has previously been reported to exhibit modest neuro-
protective effects in rodent models via anti-oxidant and
anti-inflammatory activities [76, 77].
Early and quantitative biomarkers are urgently required
for the accurate assessment of therapeutic efficacy in clin-
ical trials for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease
[78]. In this study, therapeutic efficacy, assessed using ret-
inal changes with DARC and OCT at day 20, were found
to correlate with histological observations in the brain at
day 60. For example, administration of a liposomal formu-
lation of rosiglitazone proved to be beneficial in reducing
neuronal loss in the retina and brain, while the failure of
concomitant rosiglitazone treatment to ameliorate DARC
and OCT measures in the retina was a predictor of its lack
of therapeutic efficacy in the brain.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the rote-
none model as a valuable tool in PD research. We revealed
that rotenone induces several structural alterations in the
retina and brain, resembling pathological human manifes-
tations, and that the retina can be used as a surrogate
marker for changes in the brain. Moreover, the results ad-
vocate use of the retina as an endpoint for the evaluation
of possible therapeutic strategies in PD. This work high-
lights the advantages of using real time parameters to
evaluate tissue changes in the retina (DARC and OCT) in
this PD model, methodologies that due to their non-
invasive nature and widespread availability, could easily be

 applied to the patient. Finally, this study substantiates the
evidence for PPAR-γ agonists as promising neuroprotec-
tive drugs in PD [79, 80].
