Study Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine if nonadherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is associated with 
increased 30-day all-cause, cardiovascular-cause, and pulmonary-cause hospital readmissions.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study at a Veterans Affairs hospital of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who were hospitalized from January 1, 
2007 to December 31, 2015. Odds ratio of 30-day readmission was calculated for all-cause, cardiovascular-cause, and pulmonary-cause readmissions. 
Logistic regression model was used to evaluate odds of nonadherent versus adherent group while adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, living situation, 
race, comorbidities, and medication adherence.
Results: Out of 2,077 records reviewed, 345 patients (183 adherent and 162 nonadherent) met our inclusion criteria. The adherent group had a total of 
215 initial admissions, and the nonadherent group had a total of 268 index admissions. Thirty-day all-cause readmission rate was significantly higher in the 
nonadherent group, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 3.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04–6.08, P < .001). Thirty-day cardiovascular-cause readmission 
rate was significantly higher in the nonadherent group, with an adjusted OR of 2.31 (95% CI, 1.11–4.78, P = .024). Difference in 30-day pulmonary-cause 
readmissions was not statistically significant, with an adjusted OR of 3.66 (95% CI, 0.41–32.76, P = .25).
Conclusions: Nonadherence to CPAP is associated with increased 30-day all-cause and cardiovascular-cause readmission in patients with OSA. Ensuring 
CPAP adherence is crucial in addressing general and cardiovascular-related healthcare utilization and morbidity in patients with OSA.

INTRODUCTION
The primary therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is contin-
uous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device used to prevent 
upper airway collapse during sleep. Effective CPAP therapy is 
associated with improved cardiovascular and pulmonary-related 
morbidity and mortality.1–5 Nonadherence to CPAP leads to wors-
ened health outcomes, but it is unclear whether this translates 
into increased 30-day hospital readmissions. Since the Afford-
able Care Act established the Hospital Readmission Reduction 
Program in 2012, 30-day readmissions have been touted as a key 
quality indicator for hospitals and a way to reduce health care 
costs.6 Preventable causes of readmissions were found to be from 
congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, obstructive 
lung disease, and diabetes, all which are linked to OSA.7

Most recently explored is the relationship between CPAP 
adherence and cardiac-related readmissions. A recent single-
center study demonstrated that congestive heart failure patients 
with OSA who were adherent to CPAP had lower 6-month re-
admissions and emergency department visits than patients who 
were nonadherent.8 Similarly, in hospitalized cardiac patients, 
inpatient screening of OSA, diagnosis, and treatment initiation 
resulted in decreased 30-day cardiac readmissions.9
Although these studies support the notion that patients with 
untreated or undertreated OSA may have increased cardiac 
readmissions, little is known about its relationship with non-
cardiac readmissions. Nonadherence to CPAP has been asso-
ciated with increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) exacerbations, worsened insulin resistance, psychiat-
ric illnesses, and lower urinary tract symptoms.10–13 We aim to 
BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Although it is well understood that untreated obstructive sleep apnea leads to a variety of worsened health 
outcomes, it is unclear if this translates into increased 30-day hospital readmissions. This study aimed to determine if nonadherence to continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) is associated with increased 30-day cardiovascular-cause, pulmonary-cause, or all-cause readmissions.
Study Impact: Our results demonstrate that CPAP adherence is associated with decreased all-cause and cardiovascular-cause 30-day readmissions. 
This carries important implications because it suggests that CPAP therapy may be an important, modifiable target for reducing hospital readmissions 
and may affect local, state-based, and national interventions.

CPAP Adherence and Hospital Readmissions
characterize the differences in admission types and readmis-
sion rates between patients with OSA who are adherent and 
nonadherent to CPAP. We hypothesized that those who are 
nonadherent to CPAP therapy for OSA would be associated 
with increased all-cause, cardiovascular-cause, and pulmo-
nary-cause readmissions.
METHODS
Source of Data
This retrospective cohort study used data from the Veterans 
Affairs (VA) Long Beach Healthcare System and its institu-
tional review board (IRB) approved this study. Informed con-
sent was waived for retrospective review of patients.
Study Population
Our population included patients who have the diagnosis of 
OSA and had at least one hospitalization from January 2007 
through December 2015 at the VA Long Beach Medical Cen-
ter. OSA was defined as in the International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9 code 327.23) and later confirmed 
on polysomnography data on chart review. Patient characteris-
tics were obtained from the electronic inpatient and outpatient 
data recorded at the Long Beach VA Medical Center. Baseline 
characteristics included: age on admission, sex, body mass in-
dex (BMI), living situation (alone or with others), race, base-
line apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), residual AHI, comorbidities 
at the time of initial admission, and adherence to prescribed 
medications.
The comorbidities of interest included: hypertension, diabe-
tes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, 
peripheral artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovas-
cular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
asthma, chronic kidney disease, and other arrhythmias. Other 
arrhythmias included atrial and ventricular arrhythmias that 
were not atrial fibrillation or flutter.
Medication adherence was derived from reviewing elec-
tronic VA pharmacy and calculating the medication posses-
sion ratio (MPR). MPR is calculated by dividing the number of 
the days a prescription supplies by the number of days elapsed 
during the period between refills. MPR was calculated only if 
the patient was prescribed the medication within 12 months 
preceding index admission. It was used to evaluate adherence 
for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, β-blocker, cal-
cium channel blocker, diuretic, digoxin, insulin, metformin, 
β-agonist inhaler, or muscarinic inhaler. These medications 
were selected based on prior knowledge of nonadherence to 
β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and di-
goxin and its association with worsened health outcomes and 
hospitalizations, and extrapolated to diabetes and pulmonary 
medications.14 MPR is a commonly used measure for medi-
cation adherence in literature, and medication adherence has 
been arbitrarily defined as ≥ 80% in both observational and 
randomized controlled clinical trials.15

Study Design
Patients with OSA were initially identified based on ICD-9 
code, and then confirmed on polysomnography data. Patients 
were selected for review if they had CPAP adherence data 
within 12 months preceding the index hospital admission. If 
patients did not have available CPAP adherence data within the 
12 months preceding the index admission, they were excluded. 
CPAP adherence is defined as CPAP use for 4 or more hours 
per night on 70% of nights during a consecutive minimum of 
30-day period based on Medicare definition.16
Each index admission was followed for 30 days to evaluate 
if a readmission occurred. A patient can have multiple index 
admission, regardless of how far apart, as long as CPAP adher-
ence data are available. Index admissions were categorized as 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other including gastrointesti-
nal, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, psychiatric, uro-
logic, and planned procedure.
Readmissions were categorized as all-cause, cardiovascular-
cause, or pulmonary-cause. Index admissions were excluded if 
the patient was discharged against medical advice or due to 
death. A readmission can count as an index admission, similar 
to methodologies of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 
developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity.17 Unlike the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, we 
do not link readmissions to diagnosis-related groups or major 
diagnostic criteria. All-cause, cardiovascular-cause, and pul-
monary-cause readmissions are considered for all admissions. 
We also do not exclude planned admissions or readmissions.
Exclusion criteria included lack of objective CPAP adher-
ence data, lack of polysomnography testing to confirm OSA 
diagnosis, in-hospital death during index admission, and 
same-day transfer to outside facility.
Outcome Characteristics
Thirty-day readmission was defined as an admission to the 
hospital within 30 days of a discharge of the index admission. 
Length of stay was also recorded for all readmissions. Read-
missions were categorized as all-cause, cardiovascular-cause, 
and pulmonary-cause readmissions (Table S1 in the supple-
mental material).
All-Cause Readmissions
All-cause readmissions include cardiovascular-cause readmis-
sions, pulmonary-cause readmissions, plus all other types of 
readmissions (gastrointestinal, infection, musculoskeletal, re-
nal, urologic, neurologic, psychiatric, and planned procedures) 
within 30 days of index admission discharge date.
Cardiovascular-Cause Readmissions
Cardiovascular-cause readmissions include readmission for 
acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, arrhyth-
mia, hypertensive crisis, cerebrovascular accident, and pe-
ripheral vascular disease within 30 days of index admission 
discharge date.
Pulmonary-Cause Readmissions
Pulmonary-cause readmissions include readmission for asthma, 
COPD, pulmonary hypertension, obesity hypoventilation

syndrome, hypoxia, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary 
embolism within 30 days of index admission discharge date.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic characteristics were summarized using means 
and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and fre-
quencies for categorical variables. Continuous variables were 
compared using t test or analysis of variance, and binary vari-
ables were studied using χ2 or Fisher exact tests. Odds ratio (OR) 
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to in-
dicate strength of influence between readmissions and CPAP 
nonadherence. Logistic regression model was used to evaluate 
odds of nonadherent versus adherent group while adjusting for 
age, sex, BMI, living situation, race, comorbidities, and medi-
cation adherence. These covariates were chosen based on data 
availability and prior studies that report demographic factors 
(male sex, race, social support) and clinical variables (obesity, 
comorbidities) may affect risk for readmission.18,19 Two-tailed 
values P < .05 were considered to indicate significance. Statis-
tical analysis was performed by SPSS version 17 for Windows 
software (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 2,077 patient records reviewed, 345 patients met our inclu-
sion criteria (183 adherent and 162 nonadherent). The most 
common reason for exclusion was lack of available CPAP ad-
herence data within 12 months preceding a hospitalization. The 
adherent and nonadherent groups had severe OSA with an av-
erage AHI of 46.6 versus 45.4 events/h, respectively, (P = .78). 
The average ages were 66.3 years in the adherent group versus 
62.3 years in the nonadherent group (P = .002). The nonadher-
ent group comprised more blacks than the adherent group (31 
versus 19, P = .02). There was no difference in sex, BMI, living 
situation, baseline AHI, AHI while on CPAP, comorbidities, 
and medication adherence between the two groups (Table 1).
Index Admissions
The CPAP-adherent group had a total of 215 index admissions, 
and the nonadherent group had a total of 268 initial admis-
sions. Table 2 shows the frequency of each index admission 
type. The nonadherent group had fewer planned index admis-
sions (24 (9.0%) versus 33 (15.3%), P = .03). The nonadherent 
group had more urologic (4.5% versus 0.5%, P = .002) index 
admissions compared to the adherent group. Mean length of 
stay for the nonadherent group was 4.62 days (SD 1.2), com-
pared to 4.22 days (SD 1.6) in the adherent group (P = .76).
Readmissions
Patients who were nonadherent to CPAP were more likely to be 
readmitted within 30 days when compared to adherent coun-
terparts (28.0% versus 10.2%, P < .001). Thirty-day all-cause 
readmission rate was higher in the CPAP nonadherent group 
with an OR of 3.41 (95% CI 2.04–5.71, P < .001) and adjusted 
OR of 3.52 (95% CI 2.04–6.08, P < .001). Similarly, 30-day 
cardiovascular-cause readmission rate was significantly higher 
in the CPAP nonadherent group, with an OR of 2.21 (95% CI 
1.11–4.42, P = .024) and adjusted OR of 2.31 (95% CI 1.11–
4.78, P = .02).
The nonadherent group had OR of 5.74 (95% CI 0.70–47.02, 
P = .08) and adjusted OR of 3.66 (95% CI 0.41–32.76, P = .25) 
for pulmonary-cause readmissions. (Table 3).
Table 4 shows breakdown of all-cause, cardiovascular-
cause, and pulmonary-cause readmissions.
DISCUSSION
This study supports our hypothesis that CPAP nonadherence is 
associated with increased 30-day readmissions. Patients with 
OSA who were not adherent with CPAP had higher 30-day all-
cause and cardiovascular-cause readmissions after adjusting 
for age, sex, race, living situation, BMI, AHI, comorbidities, 
and medication adherence. Cardiovascular and pulmonary 
health benefits of CPAP use are well documented,1,3–5,20 and 
this study demonstrates a link between baseline CPAP adher-
ence and readmissions for all hospitalization types. Our study 
builds upon prior single-site studies showing a relationship be-
tween effective OSA treatment and readmission.8,9
Nonadherence to CPAP was associated with higher 30-day 
cardiovascular-cause readmissions. The cardiovascular-cause 
readmissions in the nonadherent group were most commonly 
due to atrial fibrillation (29.0%), myocardial ischemia (22.5%), 
and congestive heart failure (19.3%) (Table 4). These findings 
are expected, as atrial fibrillation is known to occur more fre-
quently with increased number of apneic episodes and severity 
of hypoxemia, and CPAP therapy is associated with improved 
left ventricular systolic function and decreased atrial fibrilla-
tion occurrence.1,4,5 Effective use of CPAP has also been as-
sociated with decreased sympathetic activity, improved blood 
pressure, and overall decreased cardiovascular events.3,20
Pulmonary-related readmissions were higher in the CPAP 
nonadherent group, but did not reach the level of significance. 
Pulmonary-related readmissions in the nonadherent group 
were primarily due to COPD (71.4%) (Table 4). We expected 
pulmonary-related readmissions to be higher in the nonadher-
ent group based on literature on overlap syndrome. Those with 
OSA and COPD are considered to have overlap syndrome, 
and without CPAP therapy are at higher risk for COPD ex-
acerbation requiring hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, 
and mortality.13 CPAP therapy may reduce 6-month hospital 
readmissions and emergency department visits in overlap 
syndrome.21 However, the number of patients with pulmonary 
readmissions was very small, and analysis did not reach statis-
tical or clinical significance.
The most common (noncardiac and nonpulmonary) causes 
of all-cause readmissions in the nonadherent group were: 
urologic (10.7%), infection (8.0%), and psychiatric (5.3%) 
(Table 4). Although the reasons for these readmissions seem 
broad and unrelated, there is a growing body of evidence that 
supports increased urinary tract symptoms, immune dysfunc-
tion, and psychiatric disorders in OSA.
Urologic readmissions were predominantly due to benign 
prostate hypertrophy (BPH), lower urinary tract symptoms

CPAP Adherence and Hospital Readmissions
(LUTS), and urinary retention. Untreated OSA is associated 
with increased risk for BPH and worsened LUTS, and CPAP 
therapy is associated with reduced nocturnal urinary symp-
toms.12,22 The mechanism is unclear, but autonomic dysfunc-
tion or increased atrial natriuretic peptides have been proposed 
as possible mechanisms for nocturnal polyuria.23 It is impor-
tant to note that nighttime LUTS may lead to CPAP nonad-
herence, and therefore patients with severe BPH and worsened 
LUTS may consequently have more urologic-related admis-
sions and lower CPAP adherence. However, a small case con-
trol VA study found that BPH symptoms did not have an effect 
on CPAP adherence in veteran patients.
Infection was the second most common cause of all-cause 
readmission. The higher risk for infection among patients with 
OSA who are nonadherent to CPAP may be due to impaired 
immunity in sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation in OSA is 
commonly from apnea and hypopnea-related arousals leading 
to sleep fragmentation. Chronic sleep deprivation has been as-
sociated with reduced natural killer cell activity, suppressed I-2 
production, altered monocyte proinflammatory cytokine re-
sponse, and attenuated antibody response to immunizations.24,25
The third most common reason for all-cause readmission 
was psychiatric, specifically posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). PTSD is common among veterans, and a growing 
body of literature suggests a bidirectional relationship be-
tween OSA and PTSD. Patients with OSA and PTSD are less 
likely to use CPAP, but adherence to CPAP for patients who 
are veterans and have OSA and PTSD have been demonstrated

CPAP Adherence and Hospital Readmissions
Although analyzing index admissions was not our main ob-
jective, it is important to comment on the differences seen in 
index admission type between the adherent and nonadherent 
group. The CPAP-nonadherent group had significantly higher 
urologic-related index admissions, likely attributable to in-
creased risk for BPH, LUTS, and urinary retention.12,22,23 The 
CPAP-nonadherent group also had fewer planned procedures, 
which may indicate that the nonadherent group was an un-
healthier population with fewer planned admissions and elec-
tive procedures.
Interestingly, there was a difference in age and race between 
the adherent and nonadherent groups. The average age of the 
adherent group was 4 years older than that of the nonadher-
ent group (62.33 versus 66.26, P = .002). Because the Sleep 
Heart Health Study and other studies have shown an increase 
in cardiovascular events and ischemic strokes in older patients 
with OSA, one might expect the adherent group to have more 
index readmissions.27–29 However, despite the inherent inde-
pendent risk for cardiovascular events due to age, the adherent 
group still had fewer cardiovascular-cause and all-cause read-
missions in this study. Moreover, there were more blacks in 
the nonadherent group than the adherent group (10.4% versus 
19.1%, P = .02). This is consistent with prior studies that dem-
onstrate black race was a factor independently associated with 
worse CPAP adherence.30,31 Blacks have lower daily CPAP us-
age (about 1.5 hours less), possibly due to shorter sleep du-
ration from less sleep opportunity, and fewer CPAP attempts 
than those who are not black.32 The reason for poor CPAP ad-
herence in the black race remains complex and not fully under-
stood, and future studies are warranted to identify barriers in 
at-risk populations.
This study has several limitations that merit discussion. (1) 
This study was performed in a single Veterans Affairs Medi-
cal Center, limiting generalizability. Veterans within the sys-
tem are likely to be white, male, have more chronic illness, 
substance abuse, and lower income.32 However, it is important 
to note that despite these differences in baseline features, the 
readmission rates in our CPAP-adherent population and the 
Medicare and general VA population are relatively similar. 
Medicare patients’ readmission rates range from 8%33 to 21%,34 
the general veterans’ overall readmission rate is 13.8%.35 and 
the 30-day all-cause readmission rate of the adherent group in 
this study was found to be 10.2%. (2) As with all retrospective 
studies, the design limits the ability to prove a causal relation-
ship. (3) Also with retrospective studies, there is potential for 
confounders that may bias results. To the best of our ability, 
we attempted to mitigate confounders by using multiregres-
sion analysis to adjust for baseline demographics, social con-
ditions, comorbidities, and medication adherence. However, 
there are many more factors we did not adjust for, including 
health literacy, discharge planning, socioeconomic status, and 
psychiatric conditions. (4) Most of the 2,077 patients were ex-
cluded due to lack of sleep clinic follow-up within 12 months 
preceding index admission. Selection bias may have occurred, 
as lack of annual follow-up at a sleep clinic may indicate non-
adherent health behaviors, and the outcomes of patients who 
do not follow-up in clinic were not captured in this study. (5) 
Readmissions were not linked with index admissions by major 
diagnostic criteria or diagnostic-related group. Therefore, this 
study does not attempt or have the ability to draw clinical or 
physiologic conclusions as to how readmissions are related to 
index admissions. The aim of this study was to characterize 
the differences in admissions and readmissions between pa-
tients who are CPAP adherent and nonadherent. (6) CPAP and 
medication adherence was dichotomized using arbitrary cut-
offs, and not evaluated as dose effect. The arbitrary cutoffs, 
however, have been used in most observational studies and 
randomized controlled trials.14,36,37 (7) We used an ICD-9 code 
to identify OSA. As with other coding-based studies, we can-
not rule out the presence of coding errors in the clinical setting, 
and many patients with OSA may have been missed. (8) Re-
admissions to non-VA hospitals were not identified. However, 
we believe non-VA hospital admissions are negligible, because 
prior studies found only 2.9% of veterans are readmitted to 
non-VA hospitals within 30 days.38 (9) Finally, because of the 
small size of the cohort, this study may be underpowered to 
detect some differences between the adherent and nonadherent 
groups. Future prospective studies are warranted to validate 
our findings.
In summary, CPAP nonadherence may be associated with 
increased all-cause and cardiovascular-cause 30-day readmis-
sion rates. The modifiable nature of OSA, its high prevalence, 
and link to multiorgan health and increased healthcare utiliza-
tion makes it an important clinical and public health disease 
to target.
