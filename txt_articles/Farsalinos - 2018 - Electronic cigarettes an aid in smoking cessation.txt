Introduction
Smoking is a substantial global public health con-
cern. In 2015, the World Health Organization 
calculated that 22.7% of the global population 
above the age of 15 was smoking tobacco ciga-
rettes, which represents 1.1 billion people.1 Most 
importantly, there are six million deaths annually 
due to smoking, and it is predicted that one bil-
lion people will die prematurely from smoking-
related disease during the 21st century. In the 
United States alone, cigarette smoking causes 
about one in every five deaths, with the death toll 
estimated at 480,000 people every year.2 In 
Europe, the number of annual smoking-related 
deaths is estimated at 700,000.3 As a result, inten-
sive tobacco control efforts to reduce uptake and 
convince established smokers to quit have been 
undertaken over the past decades. Measures such 
as educational campaigns, taxation, restriction of 
smoking in public places and providing smoking-
cessation services have been used widely to com-
bat the smoking epidemic. Globally, the need to 
reduce smoking prevalence resulted in the 
 
creation of the Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control (FCTC) by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). The treaty came into force 
in 2005 and comprised 168 signatory countries 
that shared the common dedication to eliminate 
the tobacco epidemic. The responsibility of the 
FCTC was to develop guidelines and policy 
options and recommendations that can be imple-
mented globally. To this end, the FCTC created 
MPOWER in 2008, a collection of policies aim-
ing to reduce demand for tobacco. The core prin-
ciples of MPOWER are to Monitor tobacco use 
and prevention policies, to Protect people from 
tobacco smoke, to Offer help to quit tobacco use, 
to Warn about the dangers of tobacco, to Enforce 
bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and 
sponsorship, and to Raise taxes on tobacco. 
Although these efforts have substantially reduced 
smoking prevalence in the past, smoking remains 
the most important preventable risk factor for 
morbidity and premature mortality.
Smoking-cessation medications have been devel-
oped since the 1970s, starting with nicotine replace-
ment therapies and progressing to oral medications. 
All medications have been proved relatively safe 
and to increase the odds of smoking cessation com-
pared to placebo,4–8 but the long-term success rate 
is limited. Nicotine replacement therapies have a 
success rate of less than 7% when assessing the 
smoking status at 1 year.9 Despite the delivery of 
the main addictive compound of smoking, nico-
tine, the limited success of nicotine replacement

or a new health hazard?

Abstract: The issue of electronic cigarettes is one of the most controversial topics in public 
health. There is intense debate and dividing opinions about their use patterns, health effects 
and association with smoking. This is expected since they were only recently introduced to 
the market and they refer to a harm-reduction approach and strategy that is not universally 
accepted for smoking and tobacco use in the public health community. Three main factors 
determine the public health impact of electronic cigarettes: (1) their safety/risk profile, both 
relative to smoking and in absolute terms; (2) their effectiveness for smoking reduction 
and cessation; (3) the patterns of use by different population subgroups, especially never-
smokers, and adoption of use by youth. This analysis presents a brief overview of currently 
available evidence and gaps in research covering these three factors.

therapies can be attributed to the low speed of nico-
tine delivery and to the absence of the rituals associ-
ated with the psycho-behavioral aspect of smoking 
dependence.10–13 Oral medications also have a low 
success rate even in well-designed controlled tri-
als,14 while the effectiveness in real-world clinical 
practice is even lower.15 Additionally, a substantial 
proportion of smokers do not seek help from a 
smoking-cessation service. As a result, the most 
popular method for smoking cessation is quitting 
without any aid.16,17 To further enhance the tobacco 
control goal of reducing smoking prevalence, a 
strategy of harm reduction for smoking has been 
proposed. Harm reduction is a strategy and policy 
of reducing the adverse health consequences of rec-
reational drug use to those who cannot or are not 
willing to achieve complete abstinence. It was 
developed mainly for psychoactive drugs and has 
proven effective in reducing health risks and 
improving quality of life.18–20 This approach has 
been actively endorsed by authorities such as the 
WHO, and is now officially legislated in several 
countries worldwide. A harm-reduction strategy 
 
for smoking has been proposed for decades, related 
to the use of lower-risk alternatives to combus- 
tible cigarettes. The basis for this approach was 
 
first 
mentioned 
by 
Michael 
A.H. 
Russell, 
 
who noted in 1976 that the combustion process, 
rather than nicotine, is responsible for smoking-
related disease.21 Subsequently, smokeless tobacco 
products were suggested as a harm-reduction 
approach.22,23 A proof of concept about the use of 
lower-risk alternatives exists in Sweden, where men 
have a high prevalence of tobacco use, but most of 
it is snus rather than tobacco cigarettes. Because of 
this pattern of tobacco use, Sweden has the lowest 
death rates from cancer and cardiovascular disease 
in men compared to any other European Union 
country.24 However, unlike the situation with harm 
reduction for psychoactive drugs, tobacco harm 
reduction remains a controversial issue with strong 
support and opposition within the public health 
community.25–28
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are electronic 
devices that evaporate a liquid consisting of 
humectants (mainly propylene glycol and glyc-
erol), flavorings and nicotine, although solutions 
are also available without nicotine. They were 
invented in 2004 and both awareness and use has 
grown exponentially, especially since 2009.29–34 
This resulted in a heated debate about the poten-
tial public health effects of e-cigarette use. One 
part of the public health community thinks that 
e-cigarettes could help smokers to quit and accel-
erate the smoking decline by supplementing other 
tobacco control measures, resulting in a net pub-
lic health benefit.35–37 Another part considers 
e-cigarettes as a threat that could undo the pro-
gress made by the tobacco control movement 
over the past decades by making smoking and 
nicotine use socially acceptable again.38–40 This 
analysis will discuss the main factors that deter-
mine the public health impact of e-cigarettes and 
present a brief overview on the evidence related to 
each factor.
Factors determining the public health 
impact of electronic cigarettes
Electronic cigarettes could have intended and 
unintended public health consequences, depend-
ing on several factors (Table 1). It is possible to 
present the calculation of the public health impact 
of e-cigarettes (and any other tobacco harm-
reduction product) with the formula:

where EC = e-cigarette, SM = smoking, SM-EC 
= difference in hazard between smoking and 
e-cigarettes use, hazardSM = smoking initiation 
due to e-cigarettes (gateway to smoking effect).
The safety/risk profile of e-cigarettes is particularly 
important. Tobacco cigarette smoke contains 
thousands of compounds, many of which are offi-
cially classified as toxic and carcinogenic. Smoking 
is a major risk factor for a plethora of diseases, par-
ticularly cardiovascular disease, respiratory dis-
ease and cancer of the lungs and other organs. 
The 10-year fatal cardiovascular risk is approxi-
mately doubled in smokers compared to non-
smokers, while the relative risk for myocardial 
infarction in smokers aged less than 50 years is 
four-fold higher compared to non-smokers of sim-
ilar age.41,42 Smokers also have 3–5-fold higher 
risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease compared to non-smokers.43 Additionally, 
one in nine smokers develop cancer, having a 
20-fold higher risk compared to non-smokers.44,45 
Importantly, smoking cessation lowers the risk for 
developing disease or halts disease progression 
and improves future prognosis.46–48 Therefore, it 
is very important to assess the relative safety of 
e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes.

Additionally, their safety/risk profile in absolute 
terms (i.e. compared to not using any other prod-
uct) is important in determining the residual risk 
for smokers compared to quitting without the use 
of any substitute and the risk of e-cigarettes users 
who were never smokers. This may be of particu-
lar interest for smokers with pre-existing smoking-
related disease, since smoking cessation in this 
population is a very effective secondary prevention 
measure,49 but many smokers fail to quit even 
after they develop such disease.50
A second factor that determines the public health 
impact of e-cigarettes is their effect on the smok-
ing status and consumption of smokers. The 
intended role (from a public health perspective) 
of e-cigarettes is to be used as smoking substi-
tutes. Therefore, their success in achieving smok-
ing abstinence is a major determinant of their 
public health impact. Reduction in smoking con-
sumption is also expected to result in some ben-
efit, although it will certainly be less pronounced 
compared to complete abstinence. It should be 
noted that although there seems to be a dose–
response relationship between smoking consump-
tion and duration and disease risk as well as 
all-cause mortality,51–53 there are conflicting data 
about the effects of smoking reduction on disease 
risk.54–57 Since reduction in smoking consump-
tion can vary widely, it will be difficult to quantify 
the risk reduction among smokers who lower their 
smoking consumption. Due to this and for sim-
plification, the effect of smoking reduction is not 
displayed in the formula above.
The third factor that needs to be considered is the 
prevalence and patterns of e-cigarettes use in dif-
ferent population subgroups. E-cigarette use is an 
inhalational habit that closely resembles the 
 
act of smoking and can deliver nicotine. These 
characteristics could create dependence and 
 
sustained long-term use by never-smokers, which 
would result in added health risk compared to not 
using any inhalational product. Therefore, it is 
important to assess which population subgroups 
are using e-cigarettes, with particular attention to 
the smoking status before initiation of e-cigarette 
use. Additionally, the adoption of use by adoles-
cents needs to be monitored. Most long-term 
smokers start at a young age and early initiation 
predicts regular smoking in adulthood.58–63 
Adolescents are more prone to test things and 
engage in risky behaviors. In that respect, e-ciga-
rettes could attract their attention and curiosity 
but could also theoretically serve as a ‘distraction’ 
from use of tobacco cigarettes. Another reason for 
monitoring the prevalence of use among never-
smokers is the possibility that e-cigarettes might 
have a gateway effect to smoking. This means that 
people who have never and would have never 
smoked become addicted to e-cigarettes and then 
transition to tobacco cigarette use. Finally, it is 
Table 1. Main factors determining the public health impact of electronic cigarettes.

Details
Safety/risk profile
The safety/risk profile of e-cigarettes should be 
determined both relative to smoking, to inform 
smokers about the relative risks, and in absolute 
terms to inform never-smokers about potential 
risks from adoption of use.
 
 
 
Effectiveness on smoking cessation and reduction
The intended use of e-cigarettes (from a public 
health perspective) would be as smoking 
substitutes. Studies need to assess their real-world 
effectiveness in this aspect as well as any possible 
unintended consequences such as delaying or 
hindering smoking cessation.
 
 
 
 
Patterns of use by population subgroups
Ideally, e-cigarettes should be used only by current 
and former smokers. Their popularity among 
never-smoking adults needs to be monitored. 
Additionally, monitoring use by adolescents is 
important to determine how it affects smoking 
initiation and prevalence at a young age, which is a 
major predictor of long-term sustained smoking.

equally important to assess the popularity of e-cig-
arettes among smokers. To result in significant 
public health benefit, any smoking cessation aid 
needs to be not only effective but also acceptable 
and popular among the intended population sub-
group (smokers). A product that is more attractive 
for smokers will result in a higher proportion of 
them quitting or reducing smoking. A characteris-
tic example of how popularity affects the public 
health outcome comes from the use of snus by 
men in Sweden. Ramström and colleagues pre-
sented aggregate data from Your Country and 
Your Life (YCYL) 2003–11 studies and reported 
that the overall prevalence of daily tobacco use 
among Swedish men was 30.8%.64 However, the 
prevalence of daily smoking was 12.3%, while the 
prevalence of daily snus use was 20.2% (15.5% 
non-smoking, 3.0% occasionally smoking and 
1.7% daily smoking snus users). Additionally, 
snus was reported as the most popular smoking-
cessation aid among men. The high prevalence of 
snus and low prevalence of tobacco cigarette use 
among tobacco users is at least partly responsible 
for the lowest death rates from cancer and cardio-
vascular disease that are observed in Sweden com-
pared to any other European Union country.24
An overview of the main findings and challenges 
in e-cigarette research is presented in Table 2.
Safety of electronic cigarettes
Smoking causes disease after a period of several 
years. This means that in order to assess the 
health impact of e-cigarettes compared to smok-
ing in the clinical setting, long-term epidemiolog-
ical studies are needed. With e-cigarettes being 
available mostly in the past 10 years, it is not 
unexpected that long-term epidemiological evi-
dence of their health effects is still not available. 
However, there is extensive preclinical research, 
mostly on chemistry and toxicology of e-ciga-
rettes. Tobacco cigarette smoke is a complex mix-
ture of thousands of chemicals, with many of 
them being linked to cancer and others being 
linked to cardiotoxicity, respiratory toxicity and 
genotoxicity.65–67 Tobacco cigarette smoke also 
contains inorganic compounds such as heavy 
metals. The main pathophysiological mechanisms 
of causing disease are through inflammation, oxi-
dative stress and DNA damage.68–72 Most of these 
toxins are derived from the combustion pro-
cess,73–75 while some are inherently present in the 
tobacco plant or are produced during the curing 
process of tobacco leaves.75–77 The combustion 
process is critical in the generation of toxic chemi-
cals, with the tobacco cigarette reaching up to 
900°C during a puff and burning at more than 
400°C between puffs.78
The main differences between e-cigarettes and 
tobacco cigarettes that are expected to largely 
determine the potential risk discrepancies are the 
lack of combustion and tobacco in the former. 
E-cigarettes function by evaporating a liquid, 
which is rapidly condensed into an aerosol and is 
then inhaled by the user. The main ingredients in 
e-cigarette liquids are compounds that have been 
used extensively in food, pharmaceutical and cos-
metic products. In fact, to the best of my knowl-
edge, there is no chemical which was specifically 
developed to be used in e-cigarettes. Propylene 
glycol (1,2 propanediol) is a diol (a polyhydric 
alcohol with a 2-hydroxyl group) that was discov-
ered in 1859,79 was recognized as safe for use in 
food products by the US FDA in 198280 and is 
also used in pharmaceuticals, including intrave-
nous and inhalational preparations.81–83 In the 
human body, it is mainly metabolized to lactate 
and then to pyruvate and glucose. Glycerol 
(1,2,3-propanetriol) is a polyol (a polyhydric alco-
hol with a 2-hydroxyl group) that exists in nature, 
is essential for living organisms, was first discov-
ered in 1783 and has been approved for use in 
food products since 1959.84 It is also widely used 
in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food products. 
Propylene glycol and glycerol are mainly used in 
e-cigarettes as solvents and for the production of 
visible aerosol. Flavorings are, in most cases, also 
chemicals approved for use in food products. It 
should be noted, however, that e-cigarettes intro-
duce a new route of long-term daily exposure to 
these compounds, through inhalation. There is 
limited evidence from clinical studies about the 
effects of inhaling these compounds. This creates 
uncertainty mainly for the local effects in the res-
piratory tract, while the metabolic and excretion 
pathways once absorbed have been clearly deter-
mined, raising little concern about potential risks. 
Studies on exposure to propylene glycol aerosol 
through inhalation were performed in the 
 
1940s because of observations that it had bacteri-
ostatic and virostatic properties in animals and 
humans.85,86 A study exposing primates to propyl-
ene glycol aerosol for 12–18 months showed no 
adverse effects on any organ.87 More recently, 
 K Farsalinos 
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 
5
studies of short-term exposure in animals and 
humans did not find any significant adverse health 
effects.88,89 Concerns exist for flavorings because 
some compounds, although safe to be ingested, 
might be harmful when inhaled. Examples of this 
include the food-approved additives diacetyl and

Findings
Challenges
Safety/risk profile
 
Chemistry
Most potentially toxic compounds are either 
absent or substantially lower compared to 
tobacco cigarettes.
Some studies show extremely high levels of 
some toxic compounds (mainly aldehydes).
E-cigarettes emit a lot of small particles that 
easily penetrate deep into the lungs and are 
absorbed.
Many studies do not ensure realistic use 
conditions and avoidance of ‘dry puffs’.
Lack of standardized testing conditions.
The amount of exposure determines the risk.
Particle size and number have little value 
in assessing harm without considering the 
composition of the particles.
Toxicology
Potential mechanisms for adverse health effects 
identified (e.g. inflammation and oxidative 
stress).
Comparison with smoking almost always shows 
reduced toxicological effects.
Difficult to interpret absolute effects in the context 
of clinical risk.
Toxicological studies have more value when 
comparing e-cigarettes with tobacco cigarettes 
at equivalent exposure levels, to examine relative 
effects.
Clinical
Limited studies show some clinical benefit 
(asthma, blood pressure).
Other studies show adverse effects, mostly 
relevant to sympathetic stimulation.
Biomarkers of exposure studies show reduced 
exposure among e-cigarette users, similar to 
smoking cessation.
Acute effects rarely predict long-term harm.
Sympathetic activation has been observed 
in caffeine intake or post-exercise, with no 
prognostic value.
Long-term epidemiological studies are needed to 
accurately quantify the absolute and relative risk.
Efficacy in 
smoking cessation
 
 
Randomized controlled trials show limited 
efficacy.
Cohort studies show mixed results.
Reviews have identified positive, no or negative 
effects of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation.
Cross-sectional studies show e-cigarettes help 
smokers quit.
Low quality of available evidence.
Randomized controlled trials need to use new-
generation products and allow product choice to 
participants.
Cohort studies until now suffer from strong bias.
Ever or current use is a poor measure to assess 
efficacy in smoking cessation.
Use by population 
subgroups
 
Adults
Experimentation has grown among adults, 
including non-smokers.
Regular use is largely confined in current and 
former smokers.
Dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes is the most 
common pattern with few exceptions (UK).
Regular use is an important factor is estimating 
public health effects.
Dual use is vaguely defined and includes people with 
very diverse use patterns; better definition needed.
The health effects of dual use will be determined 
by the amount of smoking reduction.
Youth
Experimentation has grown among youth, 
including non-smokers.
Regular use is largely confined in current and 
former smokers; poly-tobacco use is common.
Ever e-cigarette use at baseline predicts ever 
smoking at follow up in youth.
Among youth, e-cigarette use predicts tobacco 
cigarette use and vice versa.
Regular use, nicotine use and smoking status of 
users are important determinants of potential harm.
Smoking prevalence decreases considerably in 
youth, but how this is affected by e-cigarettes is 
unknown.

acetylpropionyl. These compounds have been 
associated with respiratory dysfunction and linked 
with rare cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, an irre-
versible obstructive lung disease involving the res-
piratory bronchioles.90–92 A study evaluating 159 
sweet-flavored e-cigarette liquids found either or 
both of these compounds in 74.2% of the tested 
samples.93 These chemicals are also present in 
tobacco cigarette smoke at levels 1 to 2 orders of 
magnitude higher compared to the e-cigarette liq-
uids tested; however, in e-cigarettes they represent 
an avoidable risk since they are added as ingredi-
ents, while in tobacco cigarette smoke they are 
formed due to combustion.94 It should be men-
tioned that no documented cases of bronchiolitis 
obliterans due to smoking or e-cigarette use have 
been reported, but smoking is a major risk factor 
for respiratory dysfunction and chronic obstruc-
tive lung disease, and these chemicals could con-
tribute to this high risk.
The chemistry profile of e-cigarette liquid and aer-
osol is substantially less harmful compared to 
tobacco cigarettes for a variety of potentially toxic 
compounds such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 
phenols, nitrates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons, aromatic amines and carbon monoxide.95–100 
Many of the toxins present in tobacco cigarette 
smoke are absent from e-cigarettes, while others 
are present in substantially lower levels. For exam-
ple, traces of tobacco-specific nitrosamines are 
present in e-cigarette liquids, resulting in non-
detectable levels to the aerosol unless the samples 
are spiked with standard nitrosamine solutions.99 
Concern has been recently raised about the emis-
sions of carbonyl compounds from e-cigarettes. 
While several studies have shown substantially 
lower levels of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and 
acrolein compared to smoking,96,98,100–103 some 
recent studies have found levels similar to or higher 
than in tobacco cigarette smoke.104–106 Carbonyls 
can be derived from thermal degradation of the 
main ingredients of e-cigarette liquids.107 However, 
a major sensory parameter of e-cigarettes is that 
liquid overheating creates a strong unpleasant taste 
that users avoid. This phenomenon, called ‘dry 
puffs’ has been presented in the literature since 
2013 and has been explained in detail.101,108,109 
Being an organoleptic (sensory) characteristic, it is 
by definition subjectively defined by e-cigarette 
users who try the e-cigarettes at the power settings 
and puffing patterns used in the laboratory. None 
of the studies finding very high levels of carbonyl 
emissions checked for the generation of dry puffs; 
as a result, the laboratory testing setup could have 
represented unrealistic conditions and be irrele-
vant to true human exposure. One study already 
showed that a previous report about high aldehyde 
emissions104 was indeed associated with dry puff 
conditions that regular users identified.110 Further 
research into carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes 
is warranted, as well as into the dry puff phenom-
enon, to understand inter- and intra-individual dif-
ferences in detecting the unpleasant taste. In any 
case, it is very important to ensure that realistic use 
conditions are adopted during aerosol collection. 
Another issue that has been raised is the emission 
of metals.96,111,112 Electronic cigarettes are metallic 
structures that are expected to emit metals to 
 
the aerosol. Some metals have been found at levels 
higher 
compared 
to 
tobacco 
cigarettes.111 
Although, in general, the levels detected are below 
safety limits for inhalational medications or for 
occupational exposure and do not seem to repre-
sent any substantial health risk, emissions can be 
further reduced by using appropriate materials.113 
There is a lot of discussion about the number and 
size of particles emitted from e-cigarettes.114–116 
Although particle size determines the penetration 
into the respiratory tract and subsequent absorp-
tion potential, it is misleading to assess the risk 
profile without taking into account the composi-
tion of the particles. The potential toxicity of the 
emitted compounds is the major determinant of 
adverse health effects, while particle size will affect 
the potential for penetration and exposure of tis-
sues. Therefore, if toxic compounds are transferred 
in small particles into the lungs, the health risk will 
be increased compared to larger particles. No 
adverse effects are expected if small particles are 
composed of inert and harmless compounds. In 
general, it is important to note that a basic princi-
ple in toxicology, as defined centuries ago, is that 
‘nothing is a poison and everything is poisonous; 
solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poi-
son (Sola dosis facit venenum)’.117 Therefore, 
finding potentially toxic emissions from e-ciga-
rettes is only a marker of potential toxicity but is not 
enough to quantify the risk. The accurate determi-
nation of amount of exposure under realistic use 
conditions is an absolute requirement to determin-
ing the potential health effects of any product.
Toxicological studies have detected several mech-
anisms through which e-cigarettes could cause 
adverse health effects, including oxidative stress, 
 K Farsalinos 
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 
7
inflammation and gene expression.118–121 Other 
studies have found minimal effects when com-
pared with smoking.122,123 It is difficult to inter-
pret in vitro studies in the context of clinical 
effects, mainly because the in vitro response 
depends on the level of exposure, and the dose 
that could better represent realistic clinical effects 
has not been determined. Such studies have more 
value in evaluating comparative effects between 
different products, especially when similar levels 
of exposure are examined. The majority of the 
studies comparing e-cigarette aerosol with 
tobacco cigarette smoke have found lower toxicity 
for e-cigarettes. However, these studies explore 
potential mechanisms of harm that need to be 
further examined.
Limited clinical studies assessing the effects of 
e-cigarettes have been performed. Some evaluated 
the acute effects of use and found elevated blood 
pressure and aortic stiffness,124,125 which are 
related to the sympathetic effects of nicotine. 
Similar effects have been observed immediately 
after use of medicinal nicotine,126 after short- or 
long-term use of caffeine127,128 or after exercise,129 
but none of these factors have any long-term 
adverse health implications. Therefore, their value 
is limited concerning the long-term effects. One 
study identified increased cardiac sympathetic 
activity in e-cigarette users after abstaining from 
nicotine intake for several hours.130 Although the 
study did not include a smoking group for com-
parison, the effects seem to be lower compared to 
other studies evaluating smokers, and this effect 
needs to be further explored. Other clinical stud-
ies have shown objective improvement in respira-
tory function of asthmatics after switching from 
smoking to e-cigarette use which was sustained for 
2 years, and improvement in blood pressure and 
hypertension control.131–133 Of particular impor-
tance are studies evaluating biomarkers of expo-
sure to toxic chemicals. Such studies have long 
been performed to assess smokers’ exposure and 
now assess the exposure of e-cigarette users. The 
studies have shown substantial reductions in bio-
markers of exposure, which are similar to non-
smokers 
or 
former 
smokers 
who 
use 
pharmaceutical 
nicotine products.134,135
Reviews of the evidence on the safety/risk profile 
of e-cigarettes agree that current evidence sug-
gests e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking, 
although the level of risk reduction is an area of 
disagreement and intense debate.136–138 A recent 
risk assessment analysis of the carcinogenic 
potential of e-cigarettes based on emissions to the 
aerosol calculated that they have 0.4% of the can-
cer risk from smoking,139 although more research 
on the chemistry is needed. Another area of 
 
agreement is that e-cigarettes are unlikely to be 
absolutely safe. In the UK, two major health 
organizations, Public Health England and the 
Royal College of Physicians, published reports 
reviewing the evidence on the e-cigarette safety/
risk profile and estimated that the health risks of 
e-cigarettes are at least 95% reduced compared to 
the risks of smoking. Therefore, although not 
risk-free, they can substantially reduce the expo-
sure of smokers to harmful toxins. Recently, the 
UK government officially included e-cigarettes as 
a harm-reduction approach that will contribute to 
the elimination of smoking by 2030. However, 
there is also criticism for the position of the UK 
authorities concerning the estimates of risk and 
the endorsement of e-cigarette use,140–142 with the 
authors of the Public Health England report 
responding that their intention was to communi-
cate to the public the difference in relative risk 
and their estimate was based on the difference in 
the chemistry profile between tobacco cigarette 
smoke and e-cigarette aerosol.143
Efficacy in smoking cessation and reduction
A major determinant of the public health effects of 
e-cigarettes depends on whether they promote or 
hinder and delay smoking reduction. Surveys of 
e-cigarette users suggest that e-cigarettes are used as 
smoking-cessation aids, while a large proportion of 
e-cigarette users manage to quit smoking or sub-
stantially reduce smoking consumption.144–147 
However, these studies use convenience samples, 
suffer from selection bias and cannot represent the 
general population. A study of vapeshop customers 
objectively assessed the smoking status of partici-
pants by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide and 
identified that 66% of participants had quit smok-
ing.148 Again, this study did not assess a random 
sample of users and could over-represent more 
advanced and dedicated consumers. Randomized 
controlled trials represent the gold-standard in 
assessing the efficacy of any medical intervention. 
Three such studies assessed the efficacy of e- 
cigarettes and showed modest results for first- 
generation devices and somewhat better results for 
newer-generation devices.149–151 Several cohort 
studies have shown mixed results, with some show-
ing that e-cigarette use increases the odds of quitting 
 Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease

journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
while others show the opposite effect.152–157 Several 
meta-analyses have also shown mixed results. 
Cochrane reviews reported that e-cigarettes help 
smokers to quit.158,159 However, both analyses indi-
cated that the confidence in the result was rated 
‘low’ by GRADE standards due to the small num-
ber of trials, low event rates and wide confidence 
intervals around the estimated means. Similar 
results and limitations were reported in another 
meta-analysis.160 Another systematic review found 
that e-cigarette use was associated with 28% 
reduced chances of quitting,161 while the most 
recent one found limited evidence for a positive or 
negative effect of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation, 
again rating the evidence as low or very low 
certainty.162
Although the systematic reviews were of good 
quality, there were major problems in the studies 
that were included to the analyses. The two ran-
domized controlled trials used outdated and 
poor-quality products that were already with-
drawn and replaced by more advanced products 
at the time of the studies’ publication.149,150 The 
third study provided nicotine-containing e-ciga-
rette liquids for a limited period of time, while 
for the rest of the study follow up participants 
could not easily obtain such liquids because they 
were banned in that country at the time of the 
study.151 Several cohort studies suffered from 
very strong bias, such as failure to examine moti-
vation to quit smoking and reasons for using 
e-cigarettes and no differentiation between regu-
lar versus occasional use and experimentation. 
Many studies included subjects who had already 
failed to quit smoking with the use of e-cigarettes 
at baseline, resulting in bias of the outcome 
being present at the start of the study.153,155,156 
Additionally, they usually assessed ever or cur-
rent (past 30-day) use, definitions that include a 
lot of experimenters rather than regular users.163 
As expected, it has been shown that frequency of 
use is positively associated with both quit 
attempts and quit success.164 There are also 
inherent problems in randomized controlled tri-
als, such as the long duration for trial planning, 
recruitment, implementation and analysis,165 
which become more important when you con-
sider the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of 
the e-cigarette market. Additionally, the classical 
implementation of randomized controlled trials, 
using a single product and evaluating the effects 
compared to placebo, is largely inapplicable to 
e-cigarette research. Switching from smoking to 
e-cigarette use represents a behavioral change, 
with the large variability of devices and liquid 
flavors serving mainly to substitute a positive 
experience from smoking with another positive 
experience from use of a less harmful substi-
tute.166 Thus, although randomized controlled 
trials are undoubtedly valuable tools, they need 
to be performed in an ‘unconventional’ way, 
allowing participants for product choice based 
on self-preference and use of new-generation 
devices that appear to be better in satisfying 
smokers’ needs. Finally, these trials do not con-
sider that smoking-cessation medications are 
unpopular among smokers, with most quit 
attempts done without the use of any aids.167 
These problems raise questions about the ability 
to generate valid and useful conclusions from 
the meta-analyses performed until now.
Population studies have shown that e-cigarettes 
have helped people quit smoking, with increas-
ing proportions of e-cigarette users being former 
smokers. In the UK, there has been an increase 
in prevalence of e-cigarette use from 700,000 in 
2013 to 2.9 million in 2017.168 The proportion 
of e-cigarette users who were former smokers 
also rose from 33% in 2012 to 52% in 2017. In 
the European Union, an estimated 6.1 million 
smokers have managed to quit with the help of 
e-cigarettes, while an additional 9.2 million 
smokers have reduced their smoking consump-
tion.16 Reported smoking cessation and reduc-
tion rates were by far higher when current and 
daily e-cigarette use was assessed separately 
from ever-use,16,169 which emphasizes the 
importance of differentiating between experi-
mentation and regular use. A cross-sectional 
survey assessing use of e-cigarettes as part of a 
quit attempt found that their use was associated 
with 60% higher odds of quitting compared to 
pharmaceutical nicotine products.170 A time 
series analysis also reported a significant direct 
association between e-cigarette use and success-
ful quitting.171 Of course, cross-sectional studies 
also have serious limitations, such as the lack of 
temporal association and causality, self-report 
bias and no objective assessment of the smoking 
status or the duration of smoking cessation. 
Also, these studies fail to explore how many of 
those who claim that they have stopped with the 
aid of e-cigarettes would have stopped anyway 
and how many of those who used an e-cigarette 
but failed to stop would have stopped had they 
used another method.172

Electronic cigarette use by population 
subgroups
Since e-cigarettes are supposed to be used as 
smoking substitutes, the intended population 
group target is smokers. Use by never-smokers 
could be associated with health effects consider-
ing that current evidence suggests they are not 
absolutely harmless. Population studies have 
been reassuring, showing that current regular use 
of e-cigarettes is largely confined to current and 
former smokers. In the UK in 2017, only 2–3% of 
current adult users report being never-smokers, 
with the proportion remaining stable between 
2012 to 2017 despite the increased awareness and 
popularity of e-cigarettes over this period.168 In 
the European Union, although 2.3% of never-
smokers reported ever e-cigarette use, current use 
was limited to 0.2%.16 Current or past daily nico-
tine use was confined to 0.09% of never- 
smokers,16 while current daily nicotine use was 
even more infrequent (0.04%).169 In the US, the 
situation is similar, with e-cigarette use being 
more prevalent among current and recent former 
smokers while being rare among never-smok-
ers.173–175 Daily use was also rare in both never-
smokers and former smokers who had quit more 
than 4 years ago.174 Similar patterns of use have 
been observed in other countries.176–181 Several 
studies raised the issue of accurately defining reg-
ular e-cigarette use.16,167,182 A detailed analysis of 
frequency of e-cigarette use among ‘current’ users 
(defined as any past 30-day use) identified that 
this definition includes a lot of infrequent users, 
including 89.5% of never-smoking past 30-day 
e-cigarette users.163 Therefore, it is important to 
determine the frequency of use in order to accu-
rately examine the impact of e-cigarettes on the 
smoking status of users. In any case, current evi-
dence suggests that the patterns of e-cigarette use 
in the adult population is favorable for public 
health, clearly showing that e-cigarettes are not 
attractive for the vast majority of adult never-
smokers. Obviously, continuous monitoring is 
needed in order to rapidly identify any changes in 
the use patterns.
Another aspect that has generated a lot of con-
cern is dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes. In the 
UK, almost 50% of e-cigarette users are current 
smokers (i.e. dual users).168 In Europe in 2014, 
more than 53% of current daily e-cigarette users 
were dual users.169 The PATH study in the US 
found that, among adult tobacco users, the preva-
lence of multiple product use was 37.8%, with 
69.7% of current e-cigarette users being current 
smokers.183 Dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes 
is a vague definition with a large variety of differ-
ent patterns of use. For example, both an occa-
sional e-cigarette user who takes a few e-cigarette 
puffs per week and smokes daily, and a daily 
e-cigarette user who also smokes but reduced 
tobacco cigarette consumption from 20 to 2 ciga-
rettes per day are considered dual users. However, 
the health-risk profile of these people is substan-
tially different. Thus, a better definition is needed, 
especially by presenting the frequency of use of 
each product and the smoking reduction in those 
who were smokers before initiating e-cigarette 
use. Dual use is unlikely to increase harm since 
e-cigarette use represents an alternative source for 
smokers to obtain the nicotine they need; thus, no 
added exposure is expected. Studies on biomark-
ers of exposure have shown that dual use is asso-
ciated with either no increase or reduction in 
toxin exposure, depending on the level of smok-
ing reduction.135,184,185 In terms of effects on 
smoking cessation, dual use represents an 
expected transition period, which could lead to 
smoking cessation, although frequently dual users 
abandon e-cigarette use because they find them 
unsatisfactory as smoking substitutes. However, 
long-term dual use is associated with higher quit 
attempt rates and cessation rates.186 Additionally, 
frequent e-cigarette use is associated with reduced 
rates of dual use.183 Available evidence suggests 
that it is reasonable to encourage, rather than dis-
courage, dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes 
unless the motivation for such use is purely rec-
reational and not an attempt to quit or substan-
tially reduce smoking.
There is an intense debate, especially in the US, 
about the adoption of e-cigarette use by adoles-
cents and subsequent gateway effects to smoking. 
In late 2016, the Surgeon General published a 
report about e-cigarette use among youth and 
young adults, presenting an explosive rise in ever-
use from 2011 to 2016 and declaring this to be a 
major public health concern.187 The report was 
mainly based on two large surveys of adolescents, 
the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and 
the Monitoring the Future Study (MTF).188–191 It 
is accurate that ever and current (past 30-day) 
e-cigarette use have increased over the past few 
years among US youth. However, the report pro-
vides little discussion on frequent regular use, use 
of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and the smok-
ing status of e-cigarette users. These are expected 
 Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 
10 
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
to be important determinants of the effects of 
e-cigarettes 
on 
this 
population 
subgroup. 
Experimentation is unlikely to result in long-term 
regular use at the same rate as regular use and is 
not expected to meaningfully increase health 
risks. Use of nicotine with e-cigarettes is expected 
to increase the likelihood of dependence in non-
smokers, while use by the latter determines if 
e-cigarettes are recruiting new users to an inhala-
tional habit and nicotine intake. An analysis of the 
NYTS 2014 found that the majority of past 
30-day e-cigarette users were ever-users of 
tobacco products, while less than 0.1% of tobacco 
never-users had used e-cigarettes for 10 or more 
days in the past month.192 That study also pre-
sented the issue of poly-tobacco use among youth, 
which has also been detected in an analysis of the 
MTF 2014.191 A secondary analysis of the latter 
survey showed that never-smoking high-school 
students were highly unlikely to use e-cigarettes 
in the past 30-days while most of those who used 
them reported use for 1–2 of the past 30 days.193 
Additionally, most adolescent users were not 
using nicotine-containing e-cigarettes.194 Surveys 
in the UK also show that there is considerable 
experimentation among youth but little regular 
use.195,196 A recent analysis of five studies in the 
UK concluded that there is a consistent pattern in 
terms of e-cigarette use among adolescents, with 
most e-cigarette experimentation not turning into 
regular use and levels of regular use in young peo-
ple who have never smoked remaining very low.197 
Similar patterns are observed in the US. The 
alarming increase in ever and past 30-day use is, 
fortunately, not accompanied by elevated regular 
use among never-smoking US adolescents.198 
Despite these findings, the temporal association 
between smoking and e-cigarette use cannot be 
determined through such cross-sectional surveys. 
Additionally, the rapidly evolving e-cigarette mar-
ket and technology could potentially change the 
patterns of use by adolescents. Therefore, it is 
important to continuously assess the use of e-cig-
arettes among youth. The latest data from NYTS 
2016 and MTF 2016, which were released after 
the Surgeon General report, showed a substantial 
decline in e-cigarette ever and past 30-day use in 
youth, which is a positive sign.199,200
Another important research question is to assess 
whether e-cigarettes act as a gateway to or a gate-
way from smoking in the never-smoking youth 
population. Several studies have shown that e-cig-
arette use at baseline predicted tobacco cigarette 
use at follow up.201–205 A recent meta-analysis esti-
mated that e-cigarette use at baseline was associ-
ated with 3–4-fold higher odds of subsequent 
tobacco cigarette use.206 The authors mentioned 
that several criteria suggested a causal link between 
e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking, such as 
association, consistency, specificity, temporality 
and biological and behavioral plausibility. The 
studies and subsequent meta-analysis provide suf-
ficient and worrying evidence that there is a tem-
poral transition from e-cigarette to tobacco 
cigarette experimentation among never-smoking 
adolescents. The causal link was based on the 
Branton Hill criteria to establish the link between 
previous exposure and future development of dis-
ease.207 While temporality was established through 
these studies for baseline never-smokers, it should 
be noted that a reverse temporal association has 
also been established. Leventhal and colleagues 
found that baseline ever-use of a combustible 
tobacco product was positively associated with 
e-cigarette use at both 6- and 12-month follow 
up.201 In reality, e-cigarettes seem to have both a 
‘cause’ and an ‘effect’ role depending on the pop-
ulation studied. Therefore, not only does use of 
e-cigarettes ‘cause’ use of conventional cigarettes, 
but also use of conventional cigarettes ‘causes’ use 
of e-cigarettes.208 Additionally, the biological 
plausibility would normally require the establish-
ment of addiction to e-cigarettes and then transi-
tion to regular smoking. However, the studies that 
were included in the meta-analysis assessed ever 
or past 30-day use of e-cigarettes at baseline, and 
ever, past year or past 30-day smoking at follow 
up. Additionally, none of the studies assessed nic-
otine use with e-cigarettes. Specificity also requires 
that no other likely causes can explain the effect. 
However, an alternative explanation is that com-
mon factors could lead to both e-cigarette and 
tobacco cigarette use. Factors such as impulsivity, 
sensation seeking and tendency toward risky 
behavior could predispose some adolescents to 
trying e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes.208 
Therefore, other confounding factors could 
explain this association. In any case, the most cru-
cial factor for public health is the prevalence of 
smoking, especially regular smoking, in adoles-
cents. Data consistently show a substantial decline 
in tobacco cigarette use from 2010 until 2016, 
despite the huge rise in e-cigarette use experimen-
tation.199,200 This probably suggests that the asso-
ciation between e-cigarette use at baseline and 
future tobacco cigarette use is affecting a small 
proportion of adolescents. Indeed, a secondary 
 K Farsalinos 
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 
11
analysis of the 2014 NYTS showed that only 3.3% 
of adolescents were past 30-day exclusive e-ciga-
rette users, with two-thirds (2.1%) being ever 
tobacco users.192 Of course, it cannot be excluded 
that the decline in smoking prevalence would have 
been stronger if e-cigarettes did not exist. 
Therefore, continuous monitoring is needed and 
it remains to be seen whether e-cigarettes repre-
sent a source of harm. At the same time, however, 
the possibility that e-cigarettes might have a pri-
mary preventive role, promoting a decline in 
tobacco cigarette use, should also be considered 
and research should also focus on this issue.
Conclusions
E-cigarettes are one of the most controversial 
issues in public health today. There is little doubt 
that they are less harmful than smoking, but there 
is disagreement on the level of risk reduction. 
However, there is agreement that they are not 
absolutely harmless. Epidemiological evidence of 
long-term health effects is unavailable for now, 
and it will take years to generate final conclusions 
about the clinical effects of switching from 
tobacco to e-cigarette use. However, it is reason-
able to communicate to smokers the relative risks 
of smoking and e-cigarette use based on current 
knowledge, keeping in mind that the ideal path-
way is to quit without using any alternative prod-
ucts. While population studies suggest that 
smokers can successfully quit smoking with the 
help of e-cigarettes, randomized controlled trials 
and cohort studies have failed to show substantial 
effects. This is, at least in part, due to both meth-
odological problems in studies and the complex-
ity and dynamic evolution of the e-cigarette 
market, as well as the time-consuming research 
methods. While there is clear evidence that e-cig-
arettes are not attracting adult never-smokers, 
there is considerable experimentation among 
adolescents, including never-smokers. Recent 
evidence shows a trend for reduction of experi-
mentation among youth while regular use appears 
to be largely confined to smokers, and smoking 
prevalence is continuously declining. More 
research is needed to evaluate the complex inter-
actions between smoking and e-cigarette use in 
adolescents and the impact of e-cigarettes on ado-
lescent smoking prevalence, and to examine 
whether e-cigarettes are a source of harm or harm 
reduction in this population. It appears that e-cig-
arettes will remain a controversial topic and 
heated debate will continue for many more years.
