Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease with limited therapeutic
options. Although immunotherapies are approved for MIBC, the majority of patients fail to
respond, suggesting existence of complementary immune evasion mechanisms. Here, we
report that the PPARγ/RXRα pathway constitutes a tumor-intrinsic mechanism underlying
immune evasion in MIBC. Recurrent mutations in RXRα at serine 427 (S427F/Y), through
conformational activation of the PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer, and focal amplification/over-
expression of PPARγ converge to modulate PPARγ/RXRα-dependent transcription programs.
Immune cell-infiltration is controlled by activated PPARγ/RXRα that inhibits expression/
secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Clinical data sets and an in vivo tumor model indicate
that PPARγHigh/RXRαS427F/Y impairs CD8+ T-cell infiltration and confers partial resistance to
immunotherapies. Knockdown of PPARγ or RXRα and pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ
significantly increase cytokine expression suggesting therapeutic approaches to reviving
immunosurveillance and sensitivity to immunotherapies. Our study reveals a class of tumor
cell-intrinsic “immuno-oncogenes” that modulate the immune microenvironment of cancer.

ancer is associated with cell autonomous and micro-
environmental
aberrance,
including
intrinsic
genomic/epigenetic alterations and evasion of immuno-
surveillance1,
2. Classic oncogenes with hotspot mutations
demonstrate robust cancer cell autonomous transformation and
“oncogene addiction” abilities, exemplified by enhancing pro-
liferation/evading apoptosis and exhibiting dependence on the
target for growth/survival3, 4. Therefore, targeted therapy has
been widely administered to cancer patients with defined genomic
alterations5. Interestingly, some of the recently uncovered
potential cancer genes with hotspot mutations, e.g., SPOP and
U2AF1, appear to exhibit fewer traits characteristic of the typical
oncogenes such as promoting cancer cell growth or conferring
oncogene dependence6, 7. Based on the recurrent nature of the
genetic alterations, it is sensible to propose that these non-
classical oncogenes may function beyond modulating tumor-
intrinsic properties and instead may modulate immune/stromal
cell function to promote a favorable microenvironment for tumor
growth.
Cancer immunosurveillance constitutes an important host
protection mechanism to prohibit cancer progression and recent
clinical success of immunotherapies has attracted substantial
interest in immune-directed anti-cancer strategies8–10. Although
immune checkpoint blockade, e.g., anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 treatment, has shown promising results in the clinic,
usually only a fraction of patients respond to the treatment11, 12.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying intrinsic or acquired
resistance to immunotherapy is pivotal for expanding the clinical
benefits to more cancer patients. It has been suggested that total
mutation burden, potential neoantigen load, and status of
immune cell infiltrates and cytokine levels may have influence on
the response of cancer patients to immunotherapy13–17. In
addition, emerging evidence suggests that metabolic and cancer
cell intrinsic oncogenic signals may mediate cancer immune
evasion and resistance to immunotherapies18–22. Hence, in
addition to understanding the regulatory roles of immune cells in
cancer, elucidation of the intrinsic genomic alterations in cancer
cells that may impact immune status or reprogramming of the
cancer microenvironment is key to deciphering molecular
mechanisms that limit response to immunotherapies in the clinic.
Here, we report that hotspot S427F/Y mutations in RXRA or
focal amplification/overexpression of PPARG in bladder cancer
induce the activation of the PPARγ/RXRα pathway, leading to
suppression of cytokine secretion from cancer cells. Non-
inflamed immune phenotypes are observed in human bladder
tumors and in a syngeneic mouse bladder tumor model. Likely as
a consequence of the suppressive immuno-environment, we
further demonstrate that PPARγ/RXRα pathway activity in the
syngeneic bladder tumor model renders partial resistance to
immune
checkpoint
blockade
suggesting
the
potential
for
PPARγ/RXRα signaling to promote innate/acquired resistance to
immunotherapies in the clinic. Collectively, we posit that this
resistance phenotype may be reversed by therapeutic targeting of
PPARγ/RXRα offering a therapeutic approach to sensitizing
bladder
cancer
with
activated
PPARγ/RXRα
pathway
to
immunotherapies.
Results
Genomic alterations of RXRA and PPARG inbladder cancer.
Performing comprehensive mining of cancer genomic alterations
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other cancer genomic
databases, we observed RXRAS427F/Y, located in the ligand-
binding domain (LBD) of RXRα, as hotspot mutations specifically
enriched in bladder cancer (4.3%, 23/534)23–25 (Fig. 1a, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Since RXRα forms heterodimers with class II
nuclear receptors (NRs) to regulate their transcriptional activ-
ities26, 27, we analyzed differentially expressed gene programs in
RXRαS427F/Y compared with wild-type (WT) tumors as well as
genomic status and mRNA expression of all class II NRs that are
known to heterodimerize with RXRα27 using TCGA data set. The
most significant differentiation between WT and S427F/Y mutant
tumors
included
upregulation
of
peroxisome
proliferator-
activated receptors (PPARs)-regulated gene expression involved
in lipid and peroxisome metabolism in the mutant setting (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). Moreover, PPARG, the gene encoding PPARγ,
is the only RXRα-heterodimerizing NR gene that exhibited
recurrent genomic alterations (amplification) and high expression
selectively in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) among the
cancer types profiled by TCGA (Supplementary Fig. 3). Located
at the center of the focal amplicon in chromosome 3p (Fig. 1b),
PPARG was identified as a significant focal amplification speci-
fically in bladder cancer by genome identification of significant
targets in cancer (GISTIC) analysis28. The amplification of
PPARG (copy number (CN)>4) occurred in 12% (49/410) of the
TCGA MIBCs. Importantly, amplification of PPARG was asso-
ciated with increased mRNA expression of PPARG (P < 2.2e−16),
suggesting that it is functionally critical (Fig. 1c). Interestingly,
overexpression of PPARG (log TPM > 7) also occurred in about
27% (96/358) MIBC patients without CN gain (CN<3), sug-
gesting that a subset of the bladder tumors may engage non-
genomic mechanisms to facilitate high expression of PPARG. In
aggregate, nearly 40% of MIBC show genetic lesions or non-
genomic based misexpression in the RXRα/PPARγ heterodimer
suggesting an essential role for this complex in the pathogenesis
of MIBC.
We next analyzed the transcriptional impact of these genetic
alterations by stratification into three groups in the TCGA MIBC
cohort. We found a significant overlap of the differentially
expressed genes in the RXRA-S427F/Y and PPARG-overexpressed
(Log2(TPM + 1)>7) groups relative to the “normal” group
(RXRA-WT or non-S427F/Y, PPARG Log2(TPM + 1)≤7), with
lipid metabolism and PPAR pathways being commonly activated
in both RXRA and PPARG alterations (Fig. 1d, Supplementary
Fig. 4). Interestingly, cancer immunity-related cytokine and
antigen processing/presentation pathways were commonly down-
regulated in MIBC bearing RXRA or PPARG alterations (Fig. 1d,
Supplementary Fig. 4). These data suggest that both genomic
alterations act on convergent pathways to potentially drive
development of bladder cancer. We also explored the possibility
that RXRA or PPARG alterations may be restricted to subtypes of
bladder
cancer
classified
by
expression
and
genomic
profiles23,
29–32.
Indeed,
RXRAS427F/Y
(P = 0.037),
PPARG-
amplification
(CN > 3,
P = 5.426e−05),
and
overexpression
(Log2(TPM + 1)>7, P < 2.2e−16) were significantly enriched in
the luminal subtype of MIBC as assessed by a Fisher’s exact test,
while RXRAS427F/Y and PPARG amplification/overexpression
trended toward mutual exclusion (Fig. 1e). Taken together, this
suggests that the non-overlapping recurrent genomic alterations
of RXRA and PPARG may similarly play a crucial role in a subset
of luminal MIBC.

of
PPARγ. To determine the functional impact of RXRαS427F/Y we
next aimed to gain structural insights into how the mutations
may alter its ligand binding or heterodimerization properties with
PPARγ. Available crystal structures show that the S427 residue is
located in the dimer interface, outside the ligand binding pocket
(Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the mutations are unlikely
to alter the ligand binding properties of RXRα. Instead, the
mutations could alter the selectivity profile for other NR partners

 and/or the oligomerization properties. We analyzed the available
heterodimer crystal structures to predict, in silico, how the
mutation might impact the selectivity profile for other NR part-
ners (Supplementary Fig. 6). We predicted that the mutation
would be accommodated, having little impact, in RXRα hetero-
dimers with many partner receptors, such as LXR, PXR, RAR,
CAR, and TR. The mutation might be detrimental to hetero-
dimers with FXR and VDR, and homodimer of RXRα itself
(Supplementary Figs. 5b, and 6), due to steric interference.
However, we predicted that RXRα heterodimer with PPARγ
would be enhanced in the mutant owing to accommodation of
S427F/Y at the dimer interface and a likely newly formed π–π
stacking between the mutant residue and Y477 of PPARγ in the
C-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Since the S427F is the
prevalent mutation found in patients (Fig. 1a), we focused on this
for additional characterization by purifying the LBD of RXRαWT
and RXRαS427F (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Consistent with pre-
vious studies33, 34, we confirmed that RXRαWT eluted pre-
dominantly as a tetramer and dissociates to monomer with
addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Interest-
ingly, RXRαS427F elutes exclusively as a monomer in the absence
of any exogenous ligand (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 7c).
Examination of the dimer interface showed that S427 was tucked
into a small hydrophilic pocket and substitution with the bulky
phenylalanine or tyrosine would disrupt this dimer (Supple-
mentary Figs. 5 and 6). Moreover, we found that the mutant was
able to associate with PPARγ in a ligand-independent fashion
(Fig. 2a). We next characterized the interaction between PPARγ
and monomeric RXRαWT or RXRαS427F using surface plasmon
resonance (SPR). RXRαS427F showed enhanced binding affinity to
PPARγ than its WT counterpart (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 8).
Together, these data suggest the S427F primes RXRα by altering
its oligomerization state and enhancing its interaction with
PPARγ.
To further characterize this mutation, we determined the
crystal structure of the heterodimer RXRαS427F and PPARγ
bound to 9-cis-retinoic acid and rosiglitazone, respectively, with
co-activator peptide Src1 at 1.95 Å resolution (Fig. 2c, Supple-
mentary Table 1). Overall, our structure superimposed closely on
the WT structure35 (PDB 1FM6) with a RMS of 1.4 Å for all Cα
π–π stacking interaction with the C-terminal Y477 of PPARγ
resulting in 11 new Van der Waals (VDW) contacts (Fig. 2d).
These new interactions may account, in part, for the tighter
binding and slower off-rate observed in the SPR experiments. The
mutation did not appear to significantly alter the ligand binding
pockets, but the additional interactions with Y477 could have a

 stabilizing effect on the active conformation of AF-2 (Fig. 2d). In
aggregate, our data indicate that the S427F mutation primes
RXRα in the monomeric form and enhances its interaction with
PPARγ, potentially predisposing PPARγ for binding co-activator
partners. These aberrant properties of RXRαS427F/PPARγ could
contribute to both activation of PPARγ-dependent transcription
and transrepression of inflammation/immune-related genes36.

scriptome profiling revealed a significant overlap of differentially
expressed genes between the PPARγ, RXRαS427F and RXRαS427Y
overexpressing human bladder cancer lines relative to their
respective controls (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore,
as we observed in the TCGA MIBC data set (Supplementary

of pathways with PPAR signaling being the most significantly
activated (Fig. 3a). Supporting this finding, overexpression of

independent expression of known PPARγ target genes ANGPTL4

 role of RXRαS427F/Y in regulating PPARγ function. We confirmed
ANGPTL4 and PLIN2 as bona fide PPARγ target genes in bladder
lines as pharmacological modulation by PPARγ agonist rosigli-
tazone (Rosi) or antagonist T0070907 significantly altered the
expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Furthermore,
PPARγ overexpression (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 11) also
enhanced the ligand-independent expression of PPARγ target
genes39, 40 suggesting that all three genetic alterations converge
onto the PPARγ pathway.
To assess whether RXRαMUT are dependent on PPARγ for
transcriptional regulation, we engineered SV-HUC-1 lines to
inducibly express RXRαS427F and shRNAs targeting PPARγ.
Whereas the control shRNA (shVec) showed a significant
increase in expression of target genes following expression of
RXRαS427F, the increase in expression was significantly blunted
following knockdown of PPARγ (Fig. 3d). We further confirmed
this dependence using PPARγ-specific antagonist T0070907 in
human bladder cancer lines HT-1197 carrying the endogenous
RXRαS427F, and 5637 and UM-UC941 lines bearing PPARγ
amplifications (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore,
RXRαMUT preferentially and constitutively interact with PPARγ
to activate PPARγ/RXRα-mediated signaling activity in the
bladder cancer cells.
Having confirmed that RXRαMUT and PPARγ alterations both
constitutively activate PPARγ alterations dysregulation αS427F/Y
or PPARγ overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Further-
more, an insignificant growth inhibition was observed following
PPARγ knockdown across a number of cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. 13b, c). This insignificant effect on growth following genetic
knockdown of PPARγ was further confirmed by pharmacologi-
cally inhibiting the pathway across a variety of cell lines spanning
multiple genotypes, suggesting this pathway may have insignif-
icant influence on growth-promoting cancer phenotypes in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
PPARγ/RXRαS427F/Y is associated with non-inflamed pheno-
type. As noted previously, RXRα
S427F/Y and PPARγ-over-
expressing bladder tumors were significantly associated with
suppression of immune infiltration and inflammation-related
pathways (Fig. 1d). In support of this, we found that cytokine and
immune pathways were significantly suppressed by PPARγ or
RXRαS427F/Y in the engineered T24 bladder cancer cell lines
indicating that tumor autonomous signaling may influence the
host immune response (Fig. 4a). We further performed a corre-
lation analysis across the TCGA bladder tumors for PPARγ and a
curated immune signature including inflammatory factors and
immune lineage markers (refer to “Methods”). Overwhelmingly,
PPARγ-associated expression was significantly anti-correlated
with the immune signature hinting at the possibility that tumor-
autonomous PPARγ activity may suppress cytokine secretion and
immune cell infiltration (Fig. 4b). In addition to high PPARγ
expressing tumors, RXRαS427F/Y positive bladder tumors also
showed an anti-correlation with immune lineage markers,
immune checkpoint genes, and inflammatory chemokines sug-
gesting that both genotypes may significantly hamper immune
infiltration (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 15).
To further validate this finding, we extended our analysis to
additional clinical data sets. To this end, we identified PPARγ
active and inactive tumors using GLMnet74 (refer to “Methods”)
across an independent cohort of 127 chemotherapy naïve MIBC
(TURBT meta-dataset) and the MD Anderson bladder cancer
data set (GSE48075). Following identification of PPARγ active/
inactive tumors, we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
using hallmark gene sets (MSigDB Collections) and a bladder
cancer-specific immunesignature190 (refer to “Methods”). In
support of the TCGA-centric analysis above (Fig. 4 b,c,
Supplementary
Fig.
15),
this
analysis
also
revealed
that
immune/inflammation-related hallmark gene sets and immune-
signature190 were negatively enriched in PPARγ active bladder
cancers in two independent cohorts (Supplementary Figs. 16 and
17). Additionally, PPARG expression in bladder cancer was
significantly correlated with reduced expression of T-cell markers,
immune checkpoint genes and inflammatory factors (Supple-
mentary Fig. 18), indicating that tumor-intrinsic PPARγ activity
might suppress the tumor immune surveillance by excluding
immune cell infiltration in bladder cancer.
We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for
PPARγ and CD8 in a cohort of human bladder tumors (Eisai
cohort) (Supplementary Table 2). This analysis revealed a
significant anti-correlation between PPARγ expression in tumor
cells and infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor compartment
(Fig. 4 d,e, Supplementary Fig. 19, Supplementary Table 3). We
further performed similar PPARγ and CD8 staining in an
independent larger cohort of bladder tumor samples (bladder
cancer meta-dataset). Again, we observed a significant decrease in
infiltrating CD8+ T cells into PPARγHigh tumors (P = 0.004,
Kruskal–Wallis
test)
(Fig.
4f,
Supplementary
Fig.
20).
In
summary, gene expression and protein staining across several
independent
clinical
cohorts
demonstrate
that
PPARγHigh/
RXRγS427F/Y tumors are associated with less CD8+ T-cell
infiltration and non-inflamed immune microenvironment.
PPARγ/RXRαS427F/Y blunts immunotherapy response. We
probed the potential mechanism(s) that promote the non-
inflamed immuno-phenotype by PPARγ/RXRαS427F/Y in blad-
der cancer. Previous analysis revealed the potential for PPARγ/
RXRαS427F/Y to influence inflammatory gene expression (Fig. 4a,
Supplementary Fig. 18). To functionally confirm the potential for
PPARγ/RXRαS427F/Y to influence chemokine expression and
secretion in bladder tumor cells, we profiled the expression/
secretion of key inflammatory factors in engineered T24 lines
in vitro. Consistent with the correlation analysis, RXRαS427F/Y or
PPARγ overexpression significantly inhibited expression (Fig. 5a)
and secretion (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 21) of key pro-
inflammatory chemokines that function as chemoattractant of
effector T cells, including IL6, IL8, CCL2, CCL5, TNF, and

 CXCL10. CXCL10 has been associated with better reponse to
anti-PDL1 treatment of bladder cancer patients in clinical trials16.
Collectively, our findings suggest that the PPARγ/RXRαS427F/Y
pathway in tumor cells might influence the activity/localization of
host immune cells and potentially blunt response to immu-
notherapy. Because many of these genes are transcriptional tar-
gets of NFκB, we evaluated the potential regulation of NFκB
factors by PPARγ. The analysis shows that the protein level and
subcellular localization of the NFκB subunit p65 remain unaf-
fected by PPARγ over-expression (Supplementary Fig. 22).
Nevertheless, PPARγ/RXRα could transrepress NFκB target genes
by interaction with the promoter of these genes or competing
with
the
transcriptional
coregulators
as
proposed
in
the
literature36.

 T cells, we subcutaneously implanted murine bladder tumor
MBT2 cells engineered to overexpress RXRαWT or RXRαS427F
(Supplementary Fig. 23) into syngeneic mice and assessed basal
tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells once the tumors reached ~300
mm3. MBT2-RXRαS427F tumors presented less CD3+ CD8+ T-
cell infiltration with a greater than twofold decrease relative to
WT tumors (Fig. 5c). In contrast, other immunocytes, including
T helper (CD3+ CD4+), Treg (CD4+FOXP3+) and monocyte/
MDSC (CD11b+), did not show significant alterations of
infiltration
in
RXRαS427F
tumors
relative
to
WT
tumors
(Supplementary Fig. 24). In light of recent reports speculating
the importance of CD8+ T-cell infiltration into tumors for
driving checkpoint blockade efficacy and the lack of responders to
atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) in the TCGA Cluster I luminal
subtype16, we also evaluated PPARγ/RXRα activity (GLMnet74,
refer to “Methods”) in MIBC from three cohorts (TGCA, bladder
cancer meta-dataset and MD Anderson). The vast majority of
PPARγ/RXRα active tumors were presented in Cluster I, a subset
of luminal bladder cancer, suggesting PPARγ/RXRα activation
may contribute to lack of response to immunotherapy (Supple-
mentary Fig. 25). We next assessed functional response of MBT2-
RXRαWT and -RXRαS427F tumors to immune checkpoint therapy
in the C3H syngeneic mouse model. The MBT2-RXRαWT tumors
showed
a
statistically
significant
response
to
anti-CTLA4
treatment at day 7 (P = 0.0189, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post-hoc test) (Fig. 5d).
Similarly, MBT2-RXRαWT also showed a significant response to
anti-PD-1 treatment at day 5 (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA
followed by the Tukey post-hoc test) (Supplementary Fig. 26).
In contrast, MBT2-RXRαS427F tumors showed a partial resistance
to both immunotherapies (P > 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed
by the Tukey’s post-hoc test) (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 26).
Collectively, these data reinforce the anti-inflammatory role of
tumor-intrinsic PPARγ/RXRα activity and potentially as a driver
of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies in bladder
cancer.
Having uncovered genomic activation of PPARγ/RXRα path-
way as a potential resistance mechanism to immunosurveillance
and immunotherapies, we next attempted to explore the impact
of therapeutic targeting of RXRα or PPARγ on inflammatory
gene expression as an initial step to restore the inflamed immuno-
environment and immune-response in bladder cancer. We found
that knockdown of PPARγ significantly augmented chemokine-
related immune pathway activity in bladder cancer cells (Fig. 5e).
Furthermore, chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10, which contribute
to immunosurveillance, were induced by shRNAs of PPARγ and
RXRα in HT-1197 bladder cancer cells bearing endogenous
RXRαS427F (Fig. 5f). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of
PPARγ with antagonist T0070907 significantly increased the
expression of key cancer immunity-enhancing inflammatory
factors including CCL2 and IL8 in the PPARG-amplified 5637
cells (Fig. 5g). Together, our data propose that the PPARγ/
RXRαS427F pathway may serve as a viable therapeutic node for
activating immunosurveillance, enhancing response to immu-
notherapies in bladder cancer.
Discussion
In this study we show that S427F/Y hotspot mutations of RXRα
and focal amplification or overexpression of PPARγ, occurring in
nearly 40% of MIBC, activate PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer func-
tion in a ligand-independent manner. We further confirm,
through interrogation of multiple engineered lines and clinical
data sets, that tumor-intrinsic PPARγ/RXRα pathway activity
inhibits host immune response through suppressing expression
and secretion of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, we demon-
strated the functional role of RXRαS427F in hindering tumor
infiltration of CD8+ T cells and promoting partial resistance to
checkpoint blockade therapies in a syngeneic tumor model.
Lastly, we present evidence that therapeutic targeting of PPARγ
may reactivate the immune response and potentially also the
response to immunotherapies by enhancing expression of pro-
inflammatory factors (Fig. 5h).
We demonstrate that recurrent alterations in PPARγ/RXRα
heterodimer lead to enhanced PPARγ signaling, reinforcing the
importance of this pathway in bladder cancer biology. Surpris-
ingly, unlike classic oncogenic pathways that promote cancer cell
proliferation, PPARγ/RXRα alterations slightly reduced cell
growth in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 13). Although we cannot
completely exclude the potential role of PPARγ/RXRα in trans-
formed cell autonomous phenotypes, our data suggest that
induction of microenvironmental reprogramming favored by
tumorigenesis is a key function of PPARγ/RXRα activation in
bladder cancer. Thus, RXRAS427F/Y and PPARG-Amp represent
an expanding list of tumor cell-intrinsic “immuno-oncogenes”
that promote tumorigenesis through modulating the immune
microenvironment. Future studies will help to refine the level of
tumor-stroma interaction driving tumorigenesis that may ulti-
mately reposition immunotherapies from targeting immune
lineages to cancer cells themselves.
Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) was the first FDA-approved

 was suggested to be regulated by and associated with response to
BCG42–44. Recently, bioinformatics studies implied an anti-
correlation between PPARγ expression and T-cell-inflamed
phenotypes45,
46.
Clinical
trials
using
immune
checkpoint
blockade in metastatic bladder cancer have revealed highly
encouraging efficacy47, 48, yet only about 25% of the patients
responded to checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1 atezoli-
zumab16. Response-predictive biomarker analysis from these
studies revealed that high CD8+ T-cell infiltration, mutation
burden, and molecular subtypes were associated with better
clinical response of bladder cancer patients16. Although PPARγ/
RXRα status was not correlated with mutation burden in bladder
cancer (Supplementary Fig. 15c), there is a significant anti-
correlation with CD8+ T-cell infiltration across four independent
cohorts of clinical samples (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 18), sug-
gesting that PPARγ/RXRα could serve as an independent marker
of immuno-phenotype and responsiveness to immunotherapy.
Indeed, using a syngeneic mouse bladder tumor model, we
showed that RXRαS427F reduced tumor infiltration of CD8+
T cells, and conferred partial resistance to checkpoint blockade
treatment (Fig. 5 c,d, Supplementary Fig. 26).
It has previously been shown that PPARγ/RXRα suppresses
immune cell activity by transrepression of pro-inflammatory tran-
scriptional factors36, 49. Bladder cancer cells appear to utilize a
similar molecular strategy to evade immunosurveillance. In bladder
cell lines, RXRαS427F/Y or PPARγ overexpression is both sufficient
and necessary to downregulate the expression of a series of pro-
inflammatory chemokines. Reduced secretion of chemokines may
allow the tumors to reprogram the immune microenvironment to
be less “inflamed”, consequently enabling resistance to immune-
directed therapies (Fig. 5h). Compromising PPARγ/RXRα function
through RNAi and pharmacological inhibition enhanced expression
of immune-potentiating chemokines in bladder cancer cells bearing
RXRαS427F/Y or overexpressing PPARγ, offering the initial steps
toward
reprogramming
the
cancer
immunity
and
restoring
response to immunotherapies (Fig. 5e–g).
It is well documented that hormones play important physio-
logical roles in homeostasis of metabolism and immunity. Ster-
oids have been widely used as anti-inflammatory treatment in the
clinic. PPARγ is a key regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism
in many cell types, and also possesses a robust anti-inflammatory
activity in immune cells49, 50. Notably, recent studies on cancer
immunity revealed the importance of lipid and glucose metabo-
lism in regulating immune cell activity and cancer immuno-
surveillance7, 19, 51. Cancer cells can suppress the functionality of
T effector cells by competing for glucose sources in the micro-
environment21, 22. In addition, altered triglyceride biosynthesis in
dendritic cells or cholesterol metabolism in T cells appears to be a
key mechanism to inhibit tumor immunity by inducing T-cell
exhaustion or dendritic cell homeostasis51–53. Of note, the
PPARγ/RXRα pathway has a well-established function in lipid
and glucose metabolism in adipocytes and muscle cells50, 54.
Agonistic PPARγ augments glucose uptake and oxidation of fatty
acids, two metabolic events recently associated with cancer cell-
immune cell energy competition22, 55. On the other hand, it has
been shown that lipid and glucose metabolism also influences
cytokine secretion and modulation of inflammation56–58. There-
fore, it is conceivable that the classic physiological axis of hor-
mone/metabolism/immunity
may
play
a
central
role
in
immunomodulation of cancer not only in cell autonomous
manners
but also
through
cancer/immune/stromal
cell-cell
interactions (Fig. 5h). Further understanding of the regulatory
mechanisms and deeper identification of relevant pathways/tar-
gets in specific tumors should pave the way for the next-
generation cancer immunotherapies.
Methods
Cell culture. All human cell lines except UM-UC9 were purchased from ATCC.
The UM-UC9 cell line was purchased from ECACC. Mouse bladder tumor cell line
MBT2 was purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources
(JCRB) Cell Bank. Cell line authentication was achieved by genetic profiling using
polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci (ATCC). All cell lines were free of
mycoplasma contamination. Parental and derivative 5637 (PPARγ amplified
human bladder cancer line) and KU-19-19 (human bladder cancer line) lines were
maintained in ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Parental and derivative HT-1197 (RXRαS427F-bearing human bladder
cancer cell line) and SCaBER (human bladder cancer cell line) lines were main-
tained in ATCC-formulated Eagle’s Minimum Essential medium containing 10%
FBS. Human bladder cancer T24 parental and derivative lines and the colorectal
cell line HCT-116 were maintained in ATCC-formulated McCoy’s 5a Medium
Modified containing 10% FBS. Normal, immortalized SV-HUC-1 cells were
maintained in ATCC-formulated F-12K medium containing 10% FBS. Parental
and derivative mouse bladder cancer cell line MBT2 cells were maintained in
ATCC-formulated Eagle’s Minimum Essential medium containing 10% FBS. Lenti-
X-293T cells (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., cat. # 632180), a cell line for lentiviral
packaging, was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
Invitrogen, cat. # 11965) containing 10% FBS and 4 mM L-glutamine.
Generation of genetically engineered cell lines. RXRαWT/MUT cDNAs were
synthesized by Genewiz and cloned into the pInducer lentiviral vector. To over-
express hPPARγ, cDNA (GeneCopoeia, cat. # GC-Z0320) was procured and cloned
into the pLenti6.3 lentiviral vector. Hairpin sequences to knockdown hPPARγ and
RXRα were designed using the Broad Institute GPP web portal, synthesized by IDT
and cloned into the pLKO-iKD-H1-puro lentiviral vector system. In all cases,
lentivirus was produced by transfecting Lenti-X-293T cells with VSVG:delta R8.9:
cloned vector constructs at a ratio of 1:4:4. Virus was harvested 2–3 days after
transfection, filtered, and used to infect cell cultures in the presence of 8 μg/ml
polybrene. In all cases, infected cells were selected with appropriate drugs in the
media. RXRαWT/MUT inducible overexpressing lines were generated by selection of
respective lines in medium with 10% Tet-Free FBS with Geneticin for 2–3 weeks.
Gene expression was induced by 3 day treatment with 100 ng/ml doxycycline
(DOX). PPARγ constitutively overexpressing lines were generated by selection of
respective lines in medium with 10% FBS plus blasticidin for 2–3 weeks. PPARγ
knockdown lines were generated by selection of respective lines in medium with
10% Tet-free FBS with puromycin for 2–3 weeks. Stable cell lines infected with
control vectors were generated to be used as negative controls for in vitro and
in vivo experiments. All primer sequence information and antibiotic concentra-
tions used to select the various derivative lines are itemized in Supplementary
Table 5.
Proliferation assays. Growth kinetic assay: 1000 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates in media supplemented with 10% Tet-free FBS. For each cell line, cells were
treated with 100 ng/ml DOX or without DOX. Growth rate for −/+DOX cells was
measured every 2 or 3 days using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
Reagent (Promega, cat. # G7573).
Long-term colony formation assays: 5000–7500 parental cells were seeded in
six-well plates in media supplemented with 10% FBS. Compound was added the
day after seeding and media/compound was replaced every 3 days. Viable colonies
were stained after 2–3 week cultures. Following media aspiration, 0.5% crystal
violet was added to the wells for about 1 h. Then crystal violet solution was
removed and wells were carefully washed with H2O to remove residual staining
solution. The plates were air-dried overnight prior to imaging.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR. For assessing basal gene
expression differences, parental lines were seeded for 24–48 h prior to sample
collection, RXRαWT/MUT/shPPARγ lines (and respective vector controls) were
cultured with 100 ng/ml DOX for 3 days prior to sample collection and PPARγ
overexpressing lines (and respective vector controls) were seeded for 24–48 h prior
to sample collection. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, cat. # 74104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To assess
changes in gene expression in response to test compounds, parental/engineered
lines were cultured as described above prior to compound treatment at the
described doses for 24 h prior to sample collection. For qPCR analysis, cDNA was
made using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosys-
tems, cat. # 4374966) and real-time PCR was performed in triplicates using Taq-
Man Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, cat. # 4369016) on an ABI
ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. Expression levels were normalized to GAPDH
expression.
Sanger sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from HT-1197 parental cells
using the Blood and Tissue DNAeasy Kit (Qiagen, cat. # 69581) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and sent to IDDEX for confirmation of the hetero-
zygous RXRαS427F mutation.

 Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in loading buffer (Invitrogen, cat. #
NP0007) containing protease inhibitor (Roche, cat. # 05892791001) and reducing
reagent DTT (Invitrogen, cat. # NP0009), sonicated and subsequently boiled for 5
min. Approximately 20 μg of protein was loaded per lane and resolved by SDS
polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes, blocked in 5% low-fat milk and probing was carried out overnight with
antibodies to PPARγ (C26H12, 1:1000 dilution) (Cell signaling, cat. # 2435S),
RXRα (D-20, 1:200 dilution) (Santa Cruz, cat. # SC-553), p65 (Santa Cruz, cat.
# SC-8008, 1:1000 dilution), Vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # V4505, 1:5000 dilu-
tion), and GAPDH (Sigma, cat. # G9545, 1:5000 dilution). Membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Millipore, cat. # AP136P, 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h and signal was
developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (GE Healthcare).
Scans of the original western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 27.
Human chemokine array. Conditioned media from 48 h incubation of sub-
confluent cells in 2% FBS containing media was applied to the Human Inflam-
mation Array C3 (Raybiotech, cat. # AAH-INF-3-8) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Biochemistry. The ligand binding domains of the receptors His-TEV-PPARγ
(234-505), His-TEV-RXRα-WT (223-462) and His-TEV-RXRα-S427F (223-462)
were cloned into pET28a (EMD Millipore) via Nco1 and EcoR1 restriction sites.
Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli overnight at 18 °C after induction with
0.5 mM IPTG at an OD600 of ~0.8. Soluble protein was purified by Ni-NTA
chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography with a 16/60 Sepha-
cryl S-300 column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. Peak fractions were pooled and flash frozen in liquid N2.
For His-TEV-RXRα-WT, two peaks were observed in the elution profile. The
predominant peak corresponded to the inactive tetramer and the minor peak was
the monomer and these were pooled accordingly. To assess their stability, we reran
these fractions on the sizing column after overnight incubation at 4 °C. The
monomer and tetramer fractions appear to be stable under these conditions,
consistent with previous reports33. The tetrameric RXRα is known to be inactive in
the absence of ligand, so the monomer fraction was used for subsequent SPR and
TR-FRET assays. The size exclusion profiles for PPARγ, RXRα-S427F, and het-
erodimer were further characterized analytically on a 10/300 Superdex 200 column.
For this analysis, equivalent molar volumes were loaded and the heterodimer was
formed by mixing the two proteins at a 1:1 molar ratio.
SPR analysis. SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore T200 equipped
with CM5 sensor chips (GE). The RXRα-WT and RXRα-S427F surfaces were
prepared using standard amine-coupling procedures in 10 mM Na-acetate buffer
pH 5.5. The resulting immobilization levels ranged from 750 to 950 resonance units
with estimated surface activity of ~30%. Interactions with PPARγ were analyzed in
dose response from 3 μM to 24 nM by twofold serial dilutions. The running buffer
was 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% P20 with 1 M sodium
chloride as the regeneration buffer. The association phase was 60 s and the dis-
sociation phase was 120 s. After reference and buffer signal subtraction the data
were fit to a steady state binding model, a 1:1 kinetic model as well as a hetero-
analyte kinetic model using Biacore T200 evaluation software (Supplementary
Fig. 8). These data and models were then exported and replotted in GraphPad
Prism to generate the publication quality figure.
Crystallography. His-TEV-RXRα-S427F (223–462) and untagged PPARγ
(234–505) were co-expressed in E. coli using a bicistronic construct cloned into
pET-28a (EMD Millipore). Soluble protein was obtained by overnight induction at
18 °C using 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested and protein was purified using Ni-
NTA chromatography followed by overnight TEV protease cleavage of the His-tag
and a polishing subtractive Ni-NTA step to remove the His6-tagged TEV. The flow
through was concentrated and injected on a 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 column equi-
librated in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES 7.5, 350 mM ammonium acetate, 1 mM
EDTA)35. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to ~18 mg/ml and flash
frozen in liquid N2. For crystallization, protein was formulated at 10 mg/ml (172
μM) in storage buffer and incubated with 9-cis-retinoic acid and rosiglitazone (860
μM each with final DMSO 5.7%), SRC-1 peptide (Ac-CPSSHSSLTERH-
KILHRLLQEGSPS-amide) (516 μM), and TCEP (2 mM). Crystals grew in the dark
at room temperature from 0.5 + 0.5 μl sitting drops equilibrated over a reservoir
containing 20–24% PEG3350 and 0.02 M Na citrate. Crystals were frozen in
reservoir solution supplemented with the agonist ligands and 20% ethylene glycol.
Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, LS-CAT 21-ID-F (Supple-
mentary Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using
MOLREP59 and refined using Refmac60 with ligand coordinates generated using
JLigand61. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with 5JI0.
Modeling the functional consequence of RXRαS427F/Y. The helix–helix inter-
action mediated by Helix-11 is one of the main structural motifs in the dimer
interface. Alignment of the C-terminal Helix-11 and -12 from available RXRα
heterodimer crystal structures shows that S427 of RXRα is located at a central
pivotal point where the two interacting helices start to diverge (Supplementary
Figs. 5 and 6). In these structures, the central residues (n) interact with each other
and with the third residue downstream (n + 3). If this third residue is small (LXR,
PXR, RARα, CAR, and TR), S427F could be accommodated and there would likely
be little impact on heterodimerizaiton. If the n + 3 residue is bulky (FXR, RXR, and
VDR), there would likely be a clash with S427F detrimental to heterodimerization.
The partner PPARγ is exceptional for two reasons. First, the n + 3 residue is a small
threonine which can accommodate the F427 mutation. Second, the C-terminal
residue Y477 of PPARγ folds back toward the central residue of Helix-11. As a
result, the S427F mutant of RXRα may form a π–π stacking pair with Y477 of
PPARγ to promote or stabilize heterodimer formation. Superposition of structures
was carried out using the Protein Structure Alignment function of Schrodinger
software via Maestro interface.
Cohort selection and TMA/microarray of bladder cancer. Characteristics of
bladder cancer patients, enrolled from three institutions (Bern, Vancouver,
Southampton), are summarized in Supplementary Table 4. The Ethics Committees
of each institute approved this study and all patients consented to analysis of their
tumor tissues. The Protocol numbers are as follows: Bern, Switzerland KEK-Be
219/2015; Vancouver, BC, Canada H09-01628; Southampton, UK, 10/H0405/99.
All patients were diagnosed for muscle invasive bladder cancer by pre-
chemotherapy transurethral resection (TURBT). They received thereafter at least
three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent cystectomy and pelvic
lymph node dissection. For all tissue sampling, hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections
were used to identify representative areas of tumor. Of chemotherapy-naïve
TURBT specimens two punches were taken per patient for TMA construction62.
For gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted from TURBT specimens
from a 1 mm diameter core punch by using RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). After cDNA amplification and labeling (Ovation WTA FFPE system and
Encore Biotin Module (NuGen, San Carlos, CA)) samples were hybridized to
GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Quality control was
assessed by Affymetrix Power Tools packages and internally developed metrics63.
The SCAN algorithm was used to normalize and summarize the microarray data64.
All array files for these cases are available from the National Center for Bio-
technology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Immunohistochemistry. For the Eisai cohort, FFPE samples used for staining were
obtained from Proteogenex and banked at Eisai (Andover, MA) (Supplementary
Table 2). Five-micron sections were prepared from FFPE samples using a rotary
microtome (Leica Microsystems, RM2255). Sections were placed on the charged
slides and thoroughly dried on a warm plate at 35–37 °C overnight. Protocol “Bond
HRP Detection for FFPE Tissue, mouse Ab_Ver 2” was used for IHC staining using
anti-human CD8 mouse antibody (clone 4B11, Leica Microsystem, Cat #NCL-L-
CD8-4B11, final concentration 0.285 µg/ml). Protocol “Bond HRP Detection for
FFPE Tissue, Rabbit Ab_Ver 2” was used for IHC staining using anti-human
PPARγ rabbit mAb (clone C26H12, Cell Signaling, cat. # 2435, final concentration
1 µg/ml). IHC staining was performed in a Leica BOND-RX Autostainer (Leica
Microsystems), a Leica ST5020 Multistainer and Coverslipper CV5030-TS5025
(Leica Microsystems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Slides
were digitized using the Aperio ScanScope whole slide scanning system. Digitized
slides were reviewed visually using the ImageScope software version 12.0.1.5027
and the results (positive or negative staining in each sample) were compared for
two duplicate runs. Staining patterns were also evaluated and compared for two
duplicate runs. Informed consent was obtained from all patients by the Russian
Oncological Research Center n.a. N.N. Blokhin Rams Ethics Committee.
For the bladder cancer meta-dataset, freshly cut tissue sections/TMAs were used
to determine the protein expression of targets of interest. Each
immunohistochemical assay was optimized and performed using the Ventana
Discovery Ultra autostainer, with a species specific secondary antibody against the
relevant primary antibodies, described below. In brief, tissue sections were
incubated in Tris EDTA (cell conditioning 1: CC1) buffer, at 95 °C for 60 min to
retrieve antigenicity, followed by incubation with primary antibody at 37 °C for 60
min (PPARγ, anti-rabbit, clone #2435, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:100 dilution;
CD8, anti-mouse, NCL-L-CD8-4B11, Leica, 1:100 dilution). Bound primary
antibodies were incubated with Ventana universal secondary antibody at 37 °C for
32 min and visualized using Ventana DAB Map detection kit.
Scoring was done by assigning four point scale system as well as percent
composite. Descriptively, score 1 represents no staining/negative by any tumor
cells, score 2 represents a weak stain, score 3 represents moderate intensity stain
and score 4 with a strong intensity staining. The overall protein expression was
determined by multiplying the intensity score with the percent positive staining.
For CD8 staining, the positive cells were counted in each tissue core.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were plated on cover slips in 24-well
plates for 24 h, then fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% triton, blocked in
3% BSA (PBS) and incubated with anti-p65 (Santa Cruz, cat. # SC-8008, 1:100
dilution) and anti-PPARγ (Cell Signaling, cat. # 2435S, 1:100 dilution) antibodies.

 Antigens were visualized using Alexa Fluor 488/594 conjugated antibodies
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500 dilution). Nuclei were stained with DAPI Vecta-
shield mounting media (Vector Laboratory). Images were acquired on Zeiss LSM-
780 confocal microscope at ×40 magnification.
Derivation of a PPARγ signature. Glmnet65 (Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized
Generalized Linear Models) is used to shrink the differential genes to a smaller
subset that predicts PPARG expression. A differential gene list related to PPARG
pathway activity is obtained from in vitro cell line model. This list went through the
following steps to select the features that predict PPARG expression in TCGA
BLCA cohort:
1.
Filtering out low expressed genes: filter out genes with median log2 (TPM + 1)
value across the patients <1
2.
Filtering out less variable genes: filter out genes with MAD value of the
expression <0.5
3.
Adjust the base level expression to be zero: center the median of each gene to
be zero
4.
cv.glmnet from glmnet R package is used to shrink the given features into a
smaller subset that predicts PPARG expression (α = 0.5 and standardize =
FALSE)
Discovery of GLMnet74. To translate this in vitro derived PPARγ signature into
the clinical setting, a GLMnet classifier was generated as follows. The 170 genes
from the in vitro PPARγ signature were used for non-hierarchical clustering of the
samples of the provisional bladder TCGA (Supplementary Fig. 15a). The cluster
with concordant gene expression, labeled in the vertical annotation bar was
determined as PPARγ active, the remaining samples as PPARγ inactive. Strength of
association of the 170 genes between the PPARγ active and inactive cluster was
used for feature selection. The expression of the 74 selected features was central
normalized in each patient and genes were modeled into GLMNET. Genomic
tuning and modeling was performed by optimizing lambda and using 10-fold
cross-validation (α = 1.0). Using leave one out cross-validation, model performance
was controlled and optimized in this discovery set. The final model was locked
(GLMnet74). In the independent data sets (Bladder cancer metadata set and MD
Anderson) the expression of the 74 selected genes was central normalized in each
patient before applying GLMnet74 to calculate the prediction scores.
Discovery of immunesignature190. A PPARγ related, bladder cancer specific
immune signature, was determined as follows: Of the Nanostring pan cancer
immune panel (n = 771), genes used in the PPARG signature were removed (n =
36). 425/735 genes were significantly (holm corrected p-value) underexpressed
in PPARγ active tumors. 190 genes with the strongest and lowest expression in
PPARγ active tumors were selected. The relation of Immunesignature190
and PPARγ activity of bladder cancers was determined by Gene signature
expression analysis in the Bladder cancer meta-dataset and MD Anderson data set.
Differential gene analysis. Linear model for microarray (limma)66 was used for
differential gene expression analysis. The input TPM was transformed by log2
(TPM + 1), where 1 is added for each TPM value to avoid the divergence of zero
TPM.
Gene set enrichment analysis. GSEA software was downloaded from broad
institute through the following link: http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/
downloads.jsp. “GseaPreranked” tool was used with the ranked list from the dif-
ferential gene analysis67. The ranked list was created from the differential gene
analysis with the p score defined as the following. The absolute value of the p score
is defined as −log2 (adjusted p value), where the adjusted p value is calculated by
limma from the differential gene analysis. The sign of the p score was defined as the
sign of the log2-fold-change from limma. Biocarta, Kegg and Reactome gene sets
were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). Enrichment
analysis in the bladder cancer meta-dataset (Supplementary Fig. 16) and MD
Anderson data set (Supplementary Fig. 17), were performed as follows: Genes were
ranked with Signal2Noise and a weighted enrichment statistic was used to calculate
Normalized Enrichment Scores, p-values and false detection rate. Enrichment of
hallmark gene sets (MSigDB Collections) and Immunesignature190 were analyzed
between PPARγ active and inactive tumors, respectively.
Efficacy studies in MBT2 syngeneic tumor model. Animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with internal animal care and use committee (IACUC)
guidelines defined by the H3 Biomedicine IACUC. 5×105 MBT2-RXRαWT and
-RXRαS427F cells resuspended in 0.1 ml PBS were subcutaneously implanted in the
right flank region of 6–8 week old female C3H mice. Sample size (n = 12 per group
for all studies except n = 11 for WT groups in anti-PD1 study) was chosen based
on previous checkpoint inhibitor experiments in the MBT2 model to ensure
adequate statistical power. Mice were treated with 2 mg/ml DOX in drinking water
(supplemented with 5% sucrose) from the day of implantation and DOX treatment
was continued for the duration of the study. Prior to treatment, mice were assigned
using a randomization block design. In brief, experimental animals were first
divided into homogenous blocks based on tumor volume. Second, within each
block, randomization of experimental animals to different groups was conducted.
This randomization approach ensures that each animal has the same probability of
being assigned to any given treatment group and therefore minimizes systematic
error. Animal studies described herein were not blinded. Intraperitoneal biw dosing
with PBS and 5 mg/kg anti-PD1 (CD279, Bio X Cell) or 5 mg/kg anti-CTLA4
(CD152, Bio X Cell) was initiated once the tumors reached ~ 100 mm3 and con-
tinued for the duration of the study. The body weights and tumor volumes were
measured every 2–3 d. Tumor volumes were calculated based on the formula:
Tumor volume = length × width2 × 0.5, where length = largest diameter of tumor
(mm) and width = diameter perpendicular to length (mm). Data are expressed as
the mean ± SEM for tumor volume. All doses and regimens were well tolerated.
The differences in tumor volume during the study period between the PBS and
anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 treatment groups were analyzed by a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post-hoc test using the endpoint
measurements. One mouse was excluded from WT group in anti-PD1 study
because the tumor began to spontaneously regress while all other tumors grew
10–30 fold during the course of the study. Statistical analyses were performed using
the GraphPad Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Quantitation of tumor infiltrating immune cells. MBT2-RXRαWT and
-RXRαS427F cell implantation and DOX treatment was initiated as described above.
Once tumors reached ~100 mm3, animals were randomized and dosed with PBS.
Tumors were collected on the second day following the first dose (~300 mm3, n =
6) and FACS analysis was performed to assess number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells
in the MBT2-RXRαWT and -RXRαS427F tumors. In brief, tumors were collected,
depleted of blood vessels/necrotic/calcified tissue and dissociated with Collagenase
B/DNAase I followed by mechanical disruption into single cell suspensions. One
million cells were transferred into FACS tubes followed by addition of CD3-PE,
CD4-PerCP, CD8a-FITC and FoxP3-APC antibodies. One million cells were
transferred into FACS tubes followed by addition of CD11b-PE antibody. Incu-
bation was performed in the dark for 30 min. Tubes were spun down at 1200 rpm
for 5 min, supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 2 ml PBS.
Tubes were spun down again, supernatant discarded and cells were resuspended in
150 μl PBS and analyzed by FACS machine.
Statistics. Appropriate statistical methods were performed as described in specific
Method sections. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
