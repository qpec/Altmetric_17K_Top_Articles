The role of adrenaline in cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
Christopher J. R. Gough1 and Jerry P. Nolan1,2*
Abstract
Adrenaline has been used in the treatment of cardiac arrest for many years. It increases the likelihood of return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC), but some studies have shown that it impairs cerebral microcirculatory flow. It is
possible that better short-term survival comes at the cost of worse long-term outcomes. This narrative review
summarises the rationale for using adrenaline, significant studies to date, and ongoing research.
Keywords: Cardiac arrest, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Adrenaline, Epinephrine, Outcome
Background
Adrenaline has been included in resuscitation guidelines
worldwide since the 1960s and, through its action of
increasing coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure, is
thought to increase the chance of restoring a heartbeat
(return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)) and of
improving long-term neurological outcome. However,
there are no human data to show that long-term neuro-
logical outcome is improved with injection of adrenaline
during cardiac arrest. Several observational studies docu-
ment an association between the injection of adrenaline
and worse neurological outcome, but all of these are
confounded because of indication bias (those with more
prolonged cardiac arrests are more likely to be given
adrenaline and are more likely to have a poor outcome).
This narrative review summarises the rationale for using
adrenaline, significant studies to date, and ongoing
research.
Why is adrenaline used in cardiac arrest and why
might it be harmful?
Adrenaline has been a key component of advanced life
support algorithms for many years. Its mechanism of
action—stimulation of α1 receptors in vascular smooth
muscle—causes vasoconstriction. This increases the aor-
tic diastolic pressure, which increases coronary perfusion
pressure (CPP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP).
The CPP is strongly associated with return of spontan-
eous circulation (ROSC) [1].
Although global cerebral and coronary blood flow is
increased by adrenaline, microcirculatory flow may be
reduced. Once ROSC has been achieved, excessive
plasma concentrations of adrenaline will cause tachycar-
dia (which increases oxygen demand) and arrhythmias,
including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrilla-
tion (VF).
Animal studies
A study of 36 adult pigs, which were randomised to one
of two adrenaline doses (20 or 30 μg/kg) or to placebo,
bolused every 3 minutes, documented increased arterial
blood pressure and increased CePP in the adrenaline
groups [2]. These two groups, however, had lower SpO2
values and lower cerebral tissue oximetry values than
the placebo group, consistent with reduced organ and
brain perfusion. A six-pig study measuring cerebral,
coronary, and aortic pressures and blood flow identified
that injection of 40 μg/kg of intravenous (IV) adrenaline
significantly increased mean aortic pressure (29 ± 5 vs 42
± 12 mmHg, p = 0.01), cerebral perfusion pressure (12 ±
5 vs 22 ± 10 mmHg, p = 0.01) and coronary perfusion
pressure (8 ± 7 vs 17 ± 4 mmHg, p = 0.02), but mean cor-
onary blood flow decreased (29 ± 15 vs 14 ± 7.0 mL/min,
p = 0.03) [3].
Microcirculatory blood flow was evaluated with orthog-
onal polarization spectral imaging in ten pigs that were
randomised to receive either adrenaline 30 μg/kg or vaso-
pressin 0.4 units/kg during CPR [4]. Post-resuscitation

 microvascular flows and cerebral oxygen tension (PbO2)
were higher and cerebral carbon dioxide tension (PbCO2)
lower after vasopressin compared with adrenaline. In an-
other study by the same group, cerebral blood flow (CBF;
assessed with microcirculatory imaging), cerebral oxygen
tension (PbO2), and carbon dioxide tension (PbCO2) were
measured in four groups of five pigs. The pigs receiving
bolus adrenaline (30 μg/kg) achieved a higher mean aortic
pressure than those given placebo during and after CPR
(p < 0.05), but had lower PbO2 values (p < 0.01) and higher
PbCO2 values (p < 0.01) after resuscitation [5]. Microcir-
culatory blood flow was lower in the adrenaline groups
than the placebo group after resuscitation (p < 0.01). This
was also observed in a separate study where 15 pigs were
subjected to 5 min of VF, and 5 minutes of precordial
compression before electrical defibrillation was attempted
[6]. Microcirculatory blood flow was assessed in the sub-
lingual mucosa at regular intervals, and CPP was also re-
corded. Six of the pigs received 1 mg of adrenaline after
1 min of precordial compression. Injection of adrenaline
reduced microcirculatory blood flow (p < 0.05), which per-
sisted for several minutes.
In another study, piglets were randomised to vasopres-
sin, or vasopressin and adrenaline, with the adrenaline
given by bolus (20 μg/kg) followed by infusion (10 μg/
kg/min) [7]. Although the adrenaline with vasopressin
group had higher mean blood pressure (p = 0.03) and
CBF (p < 0.05) during CPR, after resuscitation the CBF
was numerically 36% lower, although this was not statis-
tically significant (p = 0.06). Neuronal injury and signs of
disruption to the blood–brain barrier were both greater
in the adrenaline group.
In a study of 20 adult dogs, coronary, cerebral and
renal blood flow were measured, and cardiac tissue sam-
ples were taken for lactate concentration and myocardial
adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) [8]. The dogs were
allocated randomly into two groups—those that received
CPR alone and those that also received adrenaline (1 mg
bolus then 0.2 mg/min). The adrenaline group had
higher myocardial blood flow (48 ± 11 vs 21 ± 4 ml/min/
100 g, p < 0.05), but lower renal blood flow (1 ± 0 vs 74
± 23 ml/min/100 g, p < 0.01). There was no significant
difference between the groups in ATP values but the
adrenaline group had a higher lactate concentration in
the epicardium (6.3 ± 0.6 vs 4.2 ± 0.6 nmol/mg, p < 0.05,
with a rise from baseline of 5.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5 nmol/
mg, p < 0.05). The higher lactate values associated with
administration of adrenaline could reflect either in-
creased myocardial oxygen demand and/or stimulation
of glycolysis.
The effect on CBF of bolus adrenaline compared with
an infusion was evaluated in 24 pigs that were rando-
mised to receive either boluses of adrenaline every 3 min
(20 μg/kg) or a bolus (20 μg/kg) followed by an infusion
(10 μg/kg/min). CBF was monitored continuously. The
adrenaline bolus groups had transient increases in CBF
after each bolus, but the infusion group had higher CBF
overall (p < 0.01) [9].
In summary, adrenaline increases the mean aortic
pressure, but the effect on coronary and cerebral blood
flow is inconsistent. In many cases, adrenaline reduces
microcirculatory flow, even if global organ blood flow is
either increased or unchanged. The different techniques
used to monitor cerebral blood flow may contribute to
differences in results.
Human physiological studies
In an early study of 100 patients, to enable continuous
pressure monitoring, during cardiac arrest invasive lines
were placed into the right atrium via the subclavian vein
and into the aortic arch via the femoral artery [1].
Twenty-four patients had ROSC. The maximal CPP was
much higher in the patients who had ROSC, and no
patient with a maximal CPP less than 15 mmHg had
ROSC.
An observational study of regional cerebral oxygen-
ation (rSO2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) in 36 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest doc-
umented rSO2 for 5 minutes before and after 89 doses
of adrenaline [10]. Of note, 66.7% of patients received
only a single dose of adrenaline. Excluding 33 adrenaline
events that were preceded by a previous dose of adren-
aline given in the 5-minute window, the effect on rSO2
of 56 doses was assessed. The mean rSO2 increased by
1.4% in the 5 minutes after adrenaline dosing compared
to the 5 minutes before (95% confidence interval (CI)
0.41–2.40%, p = 0.006). However, the rSO2 values were
already increasing by 0.88%/minute before injection of
adrenaline and this trend was not significantly altered by
the adrenaline (p = 0.583). Whether or not NIRS is suffi-
ciently sensitive and reliable for detecting changes in re-
gional cerebral oxygenation associated with adrenaline
remains to be established [11].
Patients in cardiac arrest may transition from one
rhythm to another, for example from PEA to VF, which
may in turn give them a higher chance of achieving
ROSC.
In
an
Oslo
study
of
174
patients
with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with an initial
rhythm of PEA, patients given adrenaline were signifi-
cantly more likely to transition into a different rhythm
(rate ratio = 1.6, p < 0.001) [12]. Although the rate of
transition from PEA to ROSC increased markedly in the
adrenaline group, the rate of transition from ROSC to
VT/VF also increased (regression parameter = 0.3, p <
0.01), as well as from ROSC to PEA (regression param-
eter = 1.07, p < 0.01).
In summary, adrenaline increases CPP and this is asso-
ciated with a higher rate of ROSC. However, adrenaline

 also increases instability and although it increases the
likelihood of transition to ROSC, it also makes the pa-
tient more prone to develop arrhythmias, including VF.
Propensity analysis
Several Japanese studies have documented associations
between adrenaline use and short- and long-term out-
comes. These observational studies are prone to consid-
erable bias (e.g. patients successfully resuscitated early
are much less likely to have received adrenaline) and a
variety of statistical techniques are used to adjust for
confounders. One such technique is propensity analysis;
this is used when two groups of patients have dissimilar
characteristics that could account for any observed dif-
ference in outcome. A score is calculated that is the
probability that a patient would receive the treatment of
interest, based on characteristics of the patient, treating
clinician, and environment [13, 14]. Many observational
studies of the management of OHCA, such as some of
those from the Japanese nationwide OHCA registry, use
propensity score matching, which creates two groups of
study participants—one group that received the treat-
ment of interest and the other that did not—while
matching individuals with similar propensity scores. This
approach has several limitations. Firstly, only the mea-
sured characteristics can be adjusted for, so any unmeas-
ured confounders that affect treatment selection or
outcome will not be corrected for. Secondly, the quality
of the propensity model used will affect its outcome, as
will the size and quality of the included data. Observa-
tional data cannot establish causal relationships or treat-
ment effects, but appropriately used propensity analysis
on a sufficient sample size can provide a useful approxi-
mation of the effect of an intervention.
Clinical observational studies, including
systematic reviews and meta-analyses
Among 417,188 OHCAs in the Japanese nationwide
registry between 2005 and 2008, ROSC before hospital
arrival was achieved in 18.5% of 15,030 patients who re-
ceived adrenaline, and in 5.7% of 402,158 patients who
did not receive adrenaline (p < 0.001; unadjusted odds
ratio (OR) 3.75; 95% CI 3.59–3.91; Table 1) [15]. After
propensity matching the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for
ROSC was 2.51 (95% CI 2.24–2.80). Although the raw
outcome data indicate a higher rate of one-month sur-
vival in those receiving adrenaline, after propensity
matching the aOR for one-month survival was 0.54 (95%
CI 0.43–0.68) and for CPC 1–2 the aOR was 0.21 (95%
CI 0.10–0.44). These data suggest that more patients
who received adrenaline survived to hospital admission,
but that longer-term outcomes were better in the
no-adrenaline group.
Another analysis of the same Japanese nationwide
OHCA registry, but using a different period (2007 and
2010), showed that among patients receiving adrenaline,
the unadjusted rate of ROSC was higher in those with
an initial non-shockable rhythm (18.5 vs 5.7%) but lower
in those with an initial shockable rhythm (21.6 vs 28.1%)
[16] (Table 1). The unadjusted survival rates (at one
month or to discharge) and rates of survival CPC 1–2 in
all patients were lower in those receiving adrenaline.
The authors identified 1990 propensity-matched pairs of
patients with and without adrenaline with an initial

Nakahara
and
colleagues
[16]
used
a
time-dependent propensity analysis which may account
for the contradictory findings between their study and
that of Hagihara and co-investigators. Time-dependent
propensity analysis better adjusts for what has recently
been described as ‘resuscitation time bias’ where inter-
ventions such as injection of adrenaline are more likely
to be implemented the longer the duration of cardiac ar-
rest, and longer durations of cardiac arrest are associated
with worse outcome [17].
A third analysis of the Japanese nationwide registry,
this time covering the period 2009–2010, identified
209,577 OHCA [18]. Among the 15,492 patients who
had an initial shockable rhythm, the rate of ROSC,
one-month survival and one-month CPC 1–2 was 27.7,
27.0, and 18.6% in those who did not receive adrenaline
and 22.8, 15.4, and 7.0% in those who did receive adren-
aline (all p < 0.001). In the 194,085 patients who initially
had a non-shockable rhythm, the rate of ROSC and
one-month survival was 3.0%, and 2.2% in those who did
not receive adrenaline, and 18.7 and 3.9% in those who
did receive adrenaline (both, p < 0.001). There was no
significant difference in one-month CPC 1–2 between
the two groups. Injection of adrenaline within 20 min of
onset of CPR was associated with better survival. For
non-shockable rhythms, injection of adrenaline within
10 min and 10–19 min of the onset of CPR was associ-
ated with increased one-month survival (aOR 1.78, 95%
CI 1.50–2.10 and aOR 1.29, CI 1.17–1.43, respectively).
Delayed injection of adrenaline was associated with
worse neurological outcomes at one month (aOR 0.63,
95% CI 0.48–0.80 and aOR 0.49, CI 0.32–0.71) for
adrenaline injected at 10–19 min and greater than
19 min, respectively. Several studies have shown that
early adrenaline administration is associated with better
outcomes compared with later adrenaline (see ‘Adren-
aline timing’ below).
A Paris study, including all patients with OHCA who
achieved ROSC and were admitted to a single centre be-
tween 2000 and 2012, found that 17% of patients who
received adrenaline had a favourable neurological out-
come (CPC 1–2) while 63% of patients who did not re-
ceive adrenaline had a CPC 1–2 [19]. After adjusting for
known confounders, use of adrenaline was associated
with a worse neurological outcome (aOR for favourable
neurological outcome 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.47), even
after adjusting for in-hospital interventions. Although
the authors made considerable effort to adjust for
confounders, the observational nature of this study pre-
cludes any firm conclusion on causality.
The effect of adrenaline can be inferred from a
before-after trial in Ontario, Canada, which studied the
impact of introducing prehospital advanced life support
(ALS) to an optimised basic life support automated
external defibrillation (BLS-AED) system [20]. The ALS
phase included tracheal intubation and intravenous
drugs. Of the 4247 patients enrolled in the ALS phase,
95.8% received adrenaline. Patients in the ALS phase
had higher rates of ROSC (18.0 vs 12.9%, p < 0.001) and
survival to hospital admission (14.6 vs 10.9%, p < 0.001)
but no difference in survival to hospital discharge (5.1 vs
5.0%, p = 0.83) [20]. The limitation of this study is that it
is difficult to separate the impact on outcome of tracheal
intubation and injection of adrenaline. For example, any
beneficial effect of adrenaline could be offset by harm
caused by tracheal intubation, and vice versa. Determin-
ing the impact of single interventions when they are
delivered as components of a package of care
is
challenging.
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis includ-
ing 13 observational studies and one randomised con-
trolled trial, with 655,653 OHCA patients, found that
the administration of adrenaline before hospital arrival
was associated with an increase in ROSC (OR 2.84, 95%
CI 2.28–3.54, p < 0.001), but was also associated with an
increase in the risk of poor neurological outcome at hos-
pital discharge (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31–0.84, p < 0.01),
without affecting survival at one month (Figs. 1 and 2)
[21].
In summary, these observational data suggest that
adrenaline increases the rate of ROSC, but may have
detrimental
effects
on
overall
survival,
particularly
neurologically intact survival. It appears to have greatest
benefit—or least harm—in patients with cardiac arrest
with an initial non-shockable rhythm.
Adrenaline timing
An analysis of 25,095 adult in-hospital cardiac arrest
(IHCAs) with an initial non-shockable rhythm in the Ameri-
can Heart Association Get with the Guidelines-Resuscitation
(AHA GWTG-R) registry between 2000 and 2009 identi-
fied an association between survival and time to injection
of adrenaline [22]. Time to adrenaline administration was
analysed by 3-minute intervals, with an aOR of survival to
hospital discharge of 1.0 for 1–3 min as the reference
group. The aOR for survival to hospital discharge was
0.91 (95% CI 0.82–1.00, p = 0.055) for 4–6 min, 0.74 (95%
CI 0.63–0.88, p < 0.001) for 7–9 min, and 0.63 (95% CI
Gough and Nolan Critical Care  (2018) 22:139 
Page 4 of 8
 0.52–0.76, p < 0.001) for over 9 min. The results were
similar for good neurological survival.
Another analysis of the AHA GWTG-R registry included
patients with an initial shockable rhythm who were defibril-
lated within 2 minutes of the cardiac arrest and who
remained in a shockable rhythm after defibrillation [23].
The authors focused on the patients who were given adren-
aline within 2 minutes after the first defibrillation, which is
counter to the guidelines of the AHA and European Resus-
citation (these organisations recommend adrenaline deliv-
ery only after the second or third shocks, respectively). Of
2978 propensity-matched patients, 1510 received adren-
aline within 2 minutes of defibrillation and this intervention
was associated with decreased odds of survival (OR 0.70,
95% CI 0.59–0.82, p < 0.001). Early injection of adrenaline
was also associated with a decreased rate of ROSC (OR
0.71, 95% CI 0.60–0.83, p < 0.001) and good functional out-
come (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.83, p < 0.001). As well as
the potential decrease in cerebral and coronary microcircu-
latory flow, it is possible that the increase in myocardial
oxygen demand associated with adrenaline may be particu-
larly harmful in the first few minutes of a VF cardiac arrest.
A further analysis of the AHA GWTG-R registry
evaluated the impact on outcome of time to adrenaline
administration among children (age < 18 years) with
IHCA and an initial non-shockable rhythm [24]. Among
1558 children, 31.3% survived to hospital discharge. Al-
though the median time to first adrenaline dose was 1
minute (interquartile range 0–4), multivariate analysis
identified that longer time to adrenaline administration
was associated with lower risk of survival to discharge,
with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.95 per minute delay (95% CI
0.93–0.99), as well as a lower risk of survival with
favourable neurological outcome, RR 0.95 per minute
delay (95% CI 0.91–0.99). Children in whom the time to
adrenaline administration was longer than 5 minutes
had a lower risk of survival to discharge compared with
those given adrenaline within 5 minutes (21.0 vs 33.1%,
aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.93, p = 0.01).
Another analysis of the Japanese nationwide registry be-
tween 2008 and 2012 included 119,639 patients with a
witnessed OHCA [25]. The 20,420 patients who received
adrenaline were divided into four groups based on timing
of adrenaline administration: early adrenaline (5–18 min),

 intermediate adrenaline (19–23 min), late adrenaline
(24–29 min), and very late adrenaline (30–62 min). Mul-
tiple logistic regression analyses and aORs were deter-
mined for CPC 1–2 at one month, and for ROSC. Overall,
the adrenaline group had a higher rate of ROSC (18 vs
9.4%) but a lower rate of CPC 1–2 (2.9 vs 5.2%). In com-
parison with the late group, CPC 1–2 was highest in the
early adrenaline group (aOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.90–3.27),
followed by the intermediate group (aOR 1.53, 95% CI
1.14–2.05); the very late adrenaline group had the worst
neurological outcomes (in comparison with the late group:
aOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47–1.08).
Other observational studies have shown that adren-
aline is rarely given very early in a cardiac arrest. In a
literature review where drug delivery time was reported
in 7617 patients, the mean time to first drug delivery by
any route was 17.7 min [26]. Another US retrospective
study of 686 patients reported similar findings—the
mean time to adrenaline administration was 14.3 min,
while
those
who
received
early
adrenaline
(within
10 min) were more likely to have ROSC (32.9 vs 23.4%,
OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07–2.38), although there was no sig-
nificant difference in survival to discharge [27].
In summary, these observational data indicate that
earlier use of adrenaline is associated with better out-
comes than later use of adrenaline, but in patients with
an initial shockable rhythm, administration of adrenaline
within 2 minutes of the first defibrillatory shock may be
detrimental.
Adrenaline dose
The optimal dose of adrenaline remains unknown. A
meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
comparing standard dose adrenaline (1 mg; SDA) with
high-dose adrenaline (> 1 mg; HDA) found that SDA had
a lower rate of ROSC (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.97, p =
0.02) (Fig. 3), and survival to admission (RR 0.87, 95% CI
0.76–1.00, p = 0.049). However, there was no difference in
survival to discharge (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76–1.42; Fig. 4)
or neurologically favourable survival (RR 1.20, 95% CI
0.74–1.96) [28].
A recent before–after study of 2255 patients with
non-traumatic OHCA compared different doses of
adrenaline. Initially, 1 mg adrenaline was given at
4 min, followed by additional 1 mg doses every 2 min
in those with non-shockable rhythms, and every 8 min
in those with shockable rhythms [29]. During the
intervention period, 0.5 mg of adrenaline was given at 4
and 8 min, followed by every 2 min in those with
non-shockable rhythms, and every 8 min in those with
shockable rhythms. Although the dose of adrenaline
per patient reduced during the intervention period,
there was no difference in survival to hospital discharge
or favourable neurological outcome in either the shock-
able or non-shockable groups.
Adrenaline dosing intervals
A review of 20,909 IHCAs from the AHA GWTG-R de-
fined the adrenaline average dosing interval as the time
between the first adrenaline dose and the resuscitation
endpoint, divided by the total number of adrenaline
doses received after the first dose [30]. Compared with
an average dosing interval of 4 to < 5 min per dose, sur-
vival to hospital discharge was higher in patients with
longer dosing intervals: aOR 1.41 (95% CI 1.12–1.78) for 6
to < 7 min/dose; aOR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02–1.65) for 7 to <
8 min/dose; aOR 1.79 (95% CI 1.38–2.32) for 8 to < 9 min/
dose; aOR 2.17 (95% CI 1.62–2.92) for 9 to < 10 min/dose.
A much smaller single-centre study of 896 IHCAs in
Taiwan also found an association between shorter adren-
aline dosing intervals and worse outcome [31].
An analysis of 1630 IHCAs among children in the
same registry categorised average dosing intervals as
1–5 min, > 5 to < 8 min, and 8 to < 10 min/dose [32].
Compared with a reference of 1–5 min/dose, the aOR
for survival to hospital discharge was 1.81 (95% CI 1.26–
2.59) for > 5 to < 8 min/dose, and 2.64 (95% CI 1.53–
4.55) for 8 to < 10 min/dose.
In summary, although high-dose adrenaline had no ap-
parent benefit over standard-dose adrenaline, a higher
rate of survival to hospital discharge was associated with
longer adrenaline dosing intervals.

 Clinical randomised controlled trials
In a study from Norway, 851 OHCA patients were ran-
domised to receive either ALS with IV access and drugs
as indicated (IV group) or ALS with IV access delayed
until 5 min after ROSC (no IV group) [33]. Eighty per-
cent of the patients in the IV group received adrenaline
during resuscitation. In the 286 patients whose initial
rhythm was shockable (VF/pVT), there were no differ-
ences between the groups in the rates of ROSC, survival
to ITU admission, or survival to hospital discharge. In
the 565 patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm
(asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA)), those in
the IV group had higher rates of ROSC (29 vs 11%, p <
0.001) and survival to ITU admission (19 vs 10%, p =
0.003), but survival to hospital discharge was similar (2
vs 3%, p = 0.65).
A post hoc analysis of this study compared out-
comes for patients actually receiving adrenaline with
those not receiving adrenaline [34]. Patients receiving
adrenaline had a higher rate of hospital admission
(OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9–3.4) but lower rate of survival to
hospital discharge (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.8) and lower
rate of neurologically intact survival (OR 0.4, 95% CI
0.2–0.7).
A double-blind placebo-controlled RCT from West-
ern Australia randomised 534 patients to ALS with and
without adrenaline. The adrenaline group had a higher
rate of hospital admission (25.4 vs 13.0%, OR 2.3, 95%
CI 1.4–3.6) but survival to hospital discharge was not
statistically different between the groups (4 vs 1.9%, p =
0.15). The effect of adrenaline on pre-hospital ROSC
was particularly marked in non-shockable rhythms (OR
6.9, 95% CI 2.6–18.4) than in shockable rhythms (OR
2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.5). With the exception of two pa-
tients in the adrenaline group, all survivors had good
neurological outcomes (CPC 1–2) [35].
In summary, these data from prospective clinical trials
suggest that adrenaline increases the rate of ROSC, but
not
long-term
survival
or
neurologically
favourable
survival.
Ongoing studies
The PARAMEDIC-2 trial (Pre-hospital Assessment of the
Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug
administration In Cardiac arrest) has recently finished
recruiting more than 8000 patients. This individually
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in-
cluded OHCA patients in whom ALS was initiated, while
excluding patients in cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis or
life-threatening asthma, under-16 year olds, and those
who were pregnant. Adrenaline and placebo were pre-
pared in identical syringes and placed in pre-randomised
packs of ten syringes. Outcomes will be survival to 30 days,
hospital discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months, health-related
quality of life, and neurological outcomes at hospital dis-
charge and 3 and 6 months [36]. The results of this study
will be reported in 2018.
Conclusions
Although the administration of adrenaline remains one
of the most common ALS interventions, and likely in-
creases rate of ROSC after cardiac arrest, its effect on
long-term outcomes is far less certain. Several animal
studies indicate that whilst global blood flow to vital or-
gans is generally increased, microcirculatory flow may be
made worse by adrenaline. Many clinical observational
studies document an association between the injection
of adrenaline and worse long-term outcomes, yet others
show an association between early injection of adren-
aline and better long-term outcome. Ultimately, it is
hoped that the recently completed large RCT comparing
adrenaline with placebo will provide some clarity on the
role of adrenaline, if any, in the treatment of cardiac
arrest.
