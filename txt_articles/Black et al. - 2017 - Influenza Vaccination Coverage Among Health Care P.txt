The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommends that all health care personnel (HCP) receive an 
annual influenza vaccination to reduce influenza-related morbid-
ity and mortality among HCP and their patients and to reduce 
absenteeism among HCP (1–4). To estimate influenza vaccination 
coverage among HCP in the United States during the 2016–17 
influenza season, CDC conducted an opt-in Internet panel 
survey of 2,438 HCP
. Overall, 78.6% of survey respondents 
reported receiving vaccination during the 2016–17 season, simi-
lar to reported coverage in the previous three influenza seasons 
(5). Vaccination coverage continued to be higher among HCP 
working in hospitals (92.3%) and lower among HCP working in 
ambulatory (76.1%) and long-term care (LTC) (68.0%) settings. 
As in previous seasons, coverage was highest among HCP who 
were required by their employer to be vaccinated (96.7%) and 
lowest among HCP working in settings where vaccination was not 
required, promoted, or offered on-site (45.8%). Implementing 
workplace strategies found to improve vaccination coverage among 
HCP
, including vaccination requirements or active promotion 
of on-site vaccinations at no cost, can help ensure that HCP and 
patients are protected against influenza (6).
The Internet panel survey of HCP was conducted for CDC 
by Abt Associates, Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts) during 
March 28–April 19, 2017, to provide estimates of influenza vac-
cination coverage during the 2016–17 influenza season. Similar 
surveys have been conducted since the 2010–11 influenza 
season, and survey methodology has been described previously 
(7). HCP were recruited from two preexisting national opt-in 
Internet sources: Medscape, a medical website managed by 
WebMD Health Professional Network,* and general population 
Internet panels operated by Survey Sampling International 
(SSI).† Responses were weighted to the distribution of the U.S. 
population of health care personnel by occupation, age, sex, race/
ethnicity, work setting, and U.S. Census region.§ Because the 
* Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dentists, 
pharmacists, allied health professionals, technicians, and technologists were 
recruited from the current membership roster of Medscape. Additional 
information on Medscape is available at http://www.medscape.com.
† Assistants, aides, and nonclinical personnel (e.g., administrators, clerical support 
workers, janitors, food service workers, and housekeepers) were recruited from 
general population Internet panels operated by Survey Sampling International. 
Additional information on Survey Sampling International and its incentives 
for online survey participants is available at https://www.surveysampling.com.
§ Population control totals of U.S. health care personnel by occupation and work 
setting were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of 
Labor, Occupational Employment Statistics, May 2015 National Industry-
Specific Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (https://www.bls.gov/
oes/current/oessrci.htm). Population control totals by other demographic 
characteristics were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population 
Survey Monthly Labor Force Data, September 2016 (https://www.bls.gov/cps/
data.htm).

study sample was based on HCP from opt-in Internet panels 
rather than probability samples, statistical testing was not con-
ducted.¶ An increase or decrease of at least 5 percentage points 
between seasonal estimates was considered a change; estimates 
with smaller differences were considered similar.
Among the 2,547 HCP who started the survey from either 
Medscape or SSI and had eligible responses to the screening 
questions, 2,493 (97.9%) completed the survey.** Fifty-four 
respondents with completed surveys who reported working in 
“other health care settings” were excluded because examination 
of their survey responses indicated that they were either unlikely 
to have contact with patients or to have worked in one of the 
health care settings of interest for this analysis; in addition, one 
respondent whose work location was in Canada was excluded. 
The final analytic sample consisted of 2,438 HCP
.
Overall, 78.6% of respondents reported having received an 
influenza vaccination during the 2016–17 season. Among all 
HCP
, coverage increased from 63.5% in the 2010–11 season 
to 75.2% in the 2013–14 season, and ranged from 77.3% 
to 79.0% in subsequent seasons (Figure) (Table 1). As in 
previous surveys, coverage in the 2016–17 season was highest 
among HCP working in hospital settings (92.3%), followed 
by HCP working in ambulatory care (76.1%), other clinical 
settings (75.0%), or LTC (68.0%) settings. Coverage among 
HCP working in other clinical settings increased from 69.8% 
in 2015–16 to 75.0% in 2016–17; coverage in hospital, 
ambulatory care, and LTC settings was similar in 2015–16 
and 2016–17 (Table 1). Among vaccinated HCP
, 76.5% were 
vaccinated at their workplace.
Overall, vaccination coverage in 2016–17 was highest among 
physicians (95.8%), nurse practitioners and physician assistants 
(92.0%), nurses (92.6%), and pharmacists (93.7%), and low-
est among other clinical HCP (80.0%), assistants and aides 
(69.1%), and nonclinical HCP (73.7%) (Table 1). However, 
in hospital settings, vaccination coverage was approximately 
90% or higher in all occupational groups, including assistants 
and aides and nonclinical personnel.
Overall, 42.3% of HCP reported a requirement to be vac-
cinated for the 2016–17 season, an increase over the 2013–14 
season but similar to the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons. HCP 
working in hospitals were more likely to report a vaccination 
requirement (69.5%) than were HCP working in ambulatory 
care (39.0%), LTC (26.2%), or other clinical settings (22.0%) 
(Table 2). HCP working in ambulatory care, LTC, and other 
clinical settings more often reported that their employer did 
not require, provide, or promote vaccination (21.7%, 30.5%, 
and 32.2%, respectively), compared with HCP working in 
hospital settings (3.9%).

** A survey response rate requires specification of the denominator at each stage 
of sampling. During recruitment of an online opt-in survey sample, such as 
the Internet panels described in this report, these numbers are not available; 
therefore, a response rate cannot be calculated. Instead, the survey cooperation 
rate is provided.

 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
MMWR / September 29, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 38 
1013
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
As in previous seasons, vaccination coverage in 2016–17 
was highest (96.7%) among HCP working in settings where 
vaccination was required, ranging from 90.0% in LTC settings 
to 98.3% in hospital settings (Table 2). Among HCP whose 
employers did not have a requirement for vaccination, cover-
age was higher among those who worked in locations where 
vaccination was available at the worksite at no cost for >1 day 
(80.3%) than among those with vaccination available for 
1 day only (73.8%) or among those who worked in locations 
where their employer did not provide influenza vaccination 
on-site at no cost but actively promoted vaccination through 
other mechanisms†† (70.4%). Vaccination coverage was lowest 
(45.8%) among HCP working in locations where employers 
did not require vaccination, provide vaccination on-site at no 
cost, or promote vaccination (Table 2).
Discussion
The overall influenza vaccination coverage estimate among 
HCP was 78.6% in the 2016–17 season, an increase of 15 
percentage points since the 2010–11 season, but similar to the 
2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons (5). As in previous seasons, 
the highest coverage was among HCP whose workplace had 
vaccination requirements. In the absence of requirements, 
HCP with vaccination available at their workplace had higher 
coverage than those without on-site vaccination. HCP working 
in hospital settings consistently reported higher vaccination 
coverage than did those working in other settings and were the 
most likely to report workplace vaccination requirements and 
on-site vaccination. Even in occupational groups with lower 
overall coverage (i.e., assistants, aides, and nonclinical person-
nel), hospital personnel reported vaccination coverage ≥90%. 
In the 2016–17 season, 93.7% of HCP working in hospital 
settings reported either having a vaccination requirement or 
having on-site vaccination for at least 1 day. Most vaccinated 
HCP reported being vaccinated at their place of work, under-
scoring the importance of workplace vaccination availability.
HCP working in LTC settings consistently have lower influenza 
vaccination coverage than do HCP working in all other health 
care settings. Influenza vaccination among HCP in LTC settings 
is especially important because influenza vaccine effectiveness is 
generally lowest in the elderly, who are at increased risk for severe 
disease (2). In addition, studies have demonstrated that vaccina-
tion of HCP in LTC settings confers a health benefit to patients, 
including reduced risk for mortality (1–3). In contrast to HCP 
working in hospitals, only 26.2% of respondents working in LTC 
settings reported having a workplace requirement for vaccination. 
Among HCP in LTC settings, 30.5% reported that their employer 
did not require vaccination, make vaccination available on-site at 
no cost, or promote vaccination in any way. Workplace vaccina-
tion programs that have been successful in increasing coverage in 
hospital settings could be implemented in LTC and other settings 
with lower vaccination coverage. Outside of hospital settings, 
assistants and aides, “other” clinical personnel, and nonclinical 
HCP have persistently low vaccination coverage. Although some 
facilities might not prioritize these groups for vaccination pro-
grams, especially nonclinical HCP
, these personnel often spend 
considerable time with and in proximity to patients.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, the study used a nonprobability sample of 
volunteer members of Medscape and SSI Internet panels, which 
might affect the generalizability of these findings to the U.S. 
population of HCP
. Second, vaccination status and vaccination 
requirements were self-reported and might be subject to recall 
bias. Finally, coverage findings from Internet survey panels have 
differed from population-based estimates from the National 
Health Interview Survey in past influenza seasons, although 
trends in coverage were similar across seasons (8,9).
The highest influenza vaccination coverage among HCP con-
tinues to be reported in worksites with employer requirements 
for vaccination. In the absence of vaccination requirements, the 
findings in this study support the recommendations found in 
the Guide to Community Preventive Services, which include 
active promotion of on-site vaccination at no cost or low cost 
to increase influenza vaccination coverage among HCP (6). 
Measurement of and feedback about vaccination coverage are 
additional interventions recommended by the Community 
Preventive Services Task Force (6). Federal reporting require-
ments might influence vaccination coverage by occupational 
setting (10). CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network 
(NHSN) has included reporting of health care personnel influ-
enza vaccination since 2012. During 2013–2015, the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) added requirements 
to report health care personnel influenza vaccination data 
through NHSN for acute care hospitals (2013), ambulatory 
surgery centers (2014), and outpatient hemodialysis facilities 
(2015), among other settings.§§ LTC facilities currently are 
not covered by CMS quality reporting requirements. LTC 
employers can use the LTC web-based toolkit¶¶ developed by 
CDC and the National Vaccine Program Office, which pro-
vides access to resources, strategies, and educational materials 
for increasing influenza vaccination among HCP in long-term 
care settings.
 
†† Employer promoted influenza vaccination among employees through public 
identification of vaccinated persons, financial incentives or rewards to individual 
persons or groups of employees, competition between units or care areas, free 
or subsidized cost of vaccination, personal reminders to be vaccinated, or 
publicizing of the number or percentage of employees receiving vaccination.

were ever in the same room as patients.
 
† Weights were calculated based on each occupation type, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, work setting, and U.S. Census region to represent the U.S. population of HCP. 
Work setting and overall occupation are presented as weighted estimates of the total sample. Where the groups are stratified by work setting, the estimates are 
presented as weighted estimates of the occupation group subsample of each work setting subgroup.
 
§ Includes all respondents who indicated that their employer required them to be vaccinated for influenza.

 ¶¶ Vaccination coverage estimate not reliable because the sample size was <30.
 
*** Influenza vaccination was promoted among employees through public identification of vaccinated persons, financial incentives, or rewards to individuals or 
groups of employees, competition between units or care areas, free or subsidized cost of vaccination, personal reminders to be vaccinated, or publicizing of the 
number or percentage of employees receiving vaccination. Restricted to respondents without an employer requirement for vaccination or on-site vaccination.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recom-
mends annual influenza vaccination for all health care person-
nel (HCP) to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality in 
health care settings. For the 2015–16 influenza season, the 
estimated overall influenza vaccination coverage among health 
care personnel was 79.0%.
What is added by this report?
Influenza vaccination coverage among HCP during the 2016–17 
influenza season, assessed using an opt-in Internet panel 
survey, was 78.6%, similar to coverage during the 2015–16 
season. Employer vaccination requirements and offering 
vaccination at the workplace at no cost were associated with 
higher vaccination coverage. Occupational settings with the 
lowest influenza vaccination coverage were the least likely to 
require vaccination or provide vaccination on-site at no cost.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Employer vaccination requirements or, in the absence of 
requirements, offering influenza vaccination on-site at no cost, 
can achieve high HCP vaccination coverage. Implementing 
comprehensive evidence-based worksite intervention strate-
gies is important to ensure HCP and patients are protected 
against influenza.
