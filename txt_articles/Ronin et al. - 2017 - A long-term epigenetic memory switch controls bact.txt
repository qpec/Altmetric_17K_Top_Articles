Abstract When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the
expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating
conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon
infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability
in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and
non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal
growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this
bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-
virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating
conditions. We identified the per operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This
unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host
spreading.

Introduction
Bacterial populations spontaneously differentiate into distinct phenotypic states (Avery, 2006;
Dubnau and Losick, 2006). This variability has been described as a bet-hedging strategy that results
in subpopulations that will survive under unpredictable stress (Fraser and Kaern, 2009). It has also
been suggested that phenotypic variability is a ‘division of labor’ strategy: essentially, the bacterial
population diversifies in order to utilize nutrients more efficiently or to allow invasion and coloniza-
tion of diverse niches in the host (Ackermann et al., 2008). Diversification upon infection is also
related to antigenic variation, which is a key strategy to eluding the acquired immune response of
the host (Kamada et al., 2015; Stewart et al., 2011).
The role of phase-variation mechanisms in phenotypic diversification through reversible genetic
changes is well established (see for example, Casadesu
´s and Low, 2013; McClain et al., 1991;
Silverman and Simon, 1980). Diversification processes, not linked to DNA alteration have been
attributed to noise in gene expression that can be further amplified by regulatory motifs such as
excitatory dynamics (Su
¨el et al., 2006) positive feedback leading to bi-stability (Ozbudak et al.,
2004) and ultrasensitivity (Temme et al., 2008; Rotem et al., 2010; Levine et al., 2012). Interest-
ingly, phenotypic diversification in microorganisms is frequently accompanied by growth rate vari-
ability. One striking example is that of bacterial persistence under antibiotic treatment (Lewis, 2000)
mediated by growth rate bimodality (Balaban et al., 2004; Brauner et al., 2016; Helaine and
Holden, 2013).
Pathogenic bacteria tightly regulate the expression of virulence machinery. Environmental condi-
tions that are close to those in the host environment can induce the expression of the virulence
genes (‘activating conditions’) (Leverton and Kaper, 2005; Rosenshine et al., 1996). In contrast,

 ‘non-activating conditions’ include a broad spectrum of conditions that do not resemble the host
environment. Variability in the expression of virulence genes is observed when the bacteria are
exposed to activating conditions (Nielsen et al., 2010; De Angelis et al., 2011; Somvanshi et al.,
2012;
Atack
et
al.,
2015).
This
process
has
been
extensively
studied
in
Salmonella
(Ackermann et al., 2008; Temme et al., 2008). Salmonella employ a type III secretion system (T3SS)
to inject the host cells with virulence factors. Interestingly, upon shifting from non-activating to activ-
ating conditions, Salmonella exhibit bimodal T3SS expression. The burden of T3SS expression,
together with its bimodal expression, results also in growth rate bimodality (Ackermann et al.,
2008; Diard et al., 2013; Hautefort et al., 2003; Sturm et al., 2011). The bimodality in the T3SS
expression provides Salmonella with a fitness advantage in the host (Diard et al., 2013), contribut-
ing also to antibiotic persistence (Arnoldini et al., 2014), and to reduction in generation of non-viru-
lent mutants termed ‘defectors’ (Diard et al., 2013).
The aim of this study was to examine whether phenotypic variability plays a role in the virulence
of a model organism, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), a human specific pathogen, during infection
and in the transition to non-activating conditions. The major virulence factors of EPEC are a T3SS,
similar to that of Salmonella, and a type IV pili termed the bundle forming pili (BFP) (Gayta
´n et al.,
2016; Hazen et al., 2016, 2015b). EPEC can cause symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection
to a devastating lethal disease in infants and spreads in the host population by the fecal-oral route
(Hazen et al., 2016). Whereas the phenotypic variability of virulence upon shifting from non-activat-
ing to activating conditions has been extensively studied (e.g. Arnoldini et al., 2014; Diard et al.,
2013; Sturm et al., 2011), the opposite process (i.e., the behavior of the pathogen population upon
shifting from activating to non-activating conditions) is poorly understood. In vivo, shifts from activat-
ing to non-activating conditions can occur transiently within the host and also in the process of host-
to-host spread.
Using our recently established ScanLag (Levin-Reisman et al., 2010) setup that can detect sub-
populations lag time or growth rate variability by tracking single-colony appearance, we evaluated
the phenotypic variability of growth of EPEC populations upon activation and in the transition from
activating to non-activating conditions. Our analysis revealed a novel long-term hysteretic memory-
switch in EPEC, which mediates bimodality in virulence expression. Whereas bimodal virulence
expression is observed as a transient behavior in activating conditions, the transition from activating
to non-activating conditions resulted in the stable co-existence of non-virulent bacteria and a
eLife digest Bacteria typically cope with harsh and changing environments by activating specific
genes or accumulating those mutations that change genes in a beneficial way. Recently, it was also
shown that the levels of gene activity can vary between otherwise identical bacteria in a single
population. This provides an alternative strategy to deal with stressful conditions because it
generates sub-groups of bacteria that potentially already adapted to different environments.
Bacteria that enter the human body face many challenges, and this kind of pre-adaptation could
help them to invade humans and overcome the immune system. However, this hypothesis had not
previously been tested in a bacterium called enteropathogenic E.coli, which infects the intestines
and is responsible for the deaths of many infants worldwide.
Ronin et al. show that cells in enteropathogenic E.coli colonies spontaneously form into two
groups when exposed to conditions that mimic the environment inside the human body. Once
triggered, one of these groups is particularly dangerous and this “hypervirulent” state is
remembered for an extremely long time meaning that the bacteria remain hypervirulent for many
generations. In addition, Ronin et al. identified the specific genes that control the switch to the
hypervirulent state.
These findings have uncovered the existence of groups of enteropathogenic E.coli that are pre-
adapted to invading human hosts. Finding out more about how the switching mechanism works and
its relevance in other bacteria may help researchers to develop new therapies that can help fight
bacterial infections.

 hypervirulent subpopulation that continued to express full virulence even after many generation of
growth in non-activating conditions. It is likely that this hysteretic switch is common in pathogenic
bacteria, ensuring persistence of infection and improved host-to-host spreading.
Results
Colonies originating from an activated EPEC culture exhibit bimodal
growth
The expression of the EPEC virulence machinery is activated upon growth in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) at 37˚C to OD600 of 0.2–0.5 (‘activating conditions’). In contrast, overnight
growth in Luria-Bertani liquid medium (LB) is considered as ‘non-activating conditions’ (Hazen et al.,
2015a; Leverton and Kaper, 2005; Puente et al., 1996; Rosenshine et al., 1996). We searched for
growth heterogeneity in EPEC upon transition from activating to non-activating conditions. As a
negative control, the non-pathogenic E. coli K-12 was also evaluated. Cultures were grown under
activating or non-activating conditions and plated on LB agar plates (i.e., non-activating conditions).
Analysis of the colony growth dynamics, using ScanLag (Levin-Reisman et al., 2010) scanners,
showed that EPEC and K-12 from the overnight LB cultures displayed unimodal distributions of col-
ony appearance times (Figure 1A,B). In contrast, colonies of EPEC that originated from activating
culture conditions exhibited a bimodal distribution of appearance time (Figure 1C, Figure 1—
source data 1); the ‘activated’ K-12 culture maintained a unimodal distribution (Figure 1D). Further
analysis showed that the bimodality in EPEC colony appearance time was due to a slightly reduced
growth rate of the bacteria in the late-appearing colonies (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These
differences in the growth rates resulted in bimodal colony size distribution at 17 hr post-plating
(Figure 1E–G). We refer to these two colony morphotypes as BIG and SMALL, for early- and late-
appearing colonies, respectively (Figure 1C,F).
SMALL morphotype is triggered by a resettable phenotypic switch
To examine the inheritability of the SMALL and BIG phenotypes, we resuspended SMALL and BIG
colonies and immediately re-plated the bacteria on LB agar (Figure 2A). Most SMALL colony bacte-
ria gave rise to SMALL colonies (96% ± 3%; mean ± s.d.) (Figure 2B,D), whereas the bacteria origi-
nated from BIG colonies gave rise to bimodal distribution in colony size with 79% ± 4% BIG and 21%
± 4% SMALL colonies (Figure 2C,E). Remarkably, repeating this procedure for four consecutive
cycles resulted in similar ratios of BIG to SMALL colonies (Figure 2D,E). These findings suggested
that the memory of the SMALL phenotype is inherited for tens of generations.
To test whether the switching between BIG and SMALL morphotypes is mediated by DNA rear-
rangement, we extracted DNA from BIG and SMALL colonies and sequenced the genomes at high
coverage (Supplementary file 1). The genome sequences of SMALL and BIG colonies were identical
and very close to that of the published reference sequence of EPEC strain E2348/69 (Iguchi et al.,
2009). More advanced analysis, using a custom algorithm for the detection of DNA rearrangements
typical to phase variation, identified three loci that were undergoing active phase variation by DNA
inversion (Goldberg et al., 2014). However, we did not detect any specific differences in these
regions between the BIG and SMALL genomes. The only significant difference between the two
genomes was an approximately two-fold lower coverage of pMAR2 (EAF plasmid, Iguchi et al.,
2009) in the BIG variant genome relative to the SMALL genome (Supplementary file 1). These
results suggest that genetic changes are not involved in the colony size bimodality, favoring the pos-
sibility that the morphotypes are produced through an epigenetic mechanism.
We noticed a reduction in the SMALL morphotype inheritability when SMALL colonies were
grown for more than 24 hr, before suspending and re-plating, suggesting that growth to stationary
phase may affect the SMALL morphotype memory. To test this prediction, SMALL or BIG colonies
were resuspended and grown in LB broth to stationary phase and then plated and analyzed. In both
cases the SMALL morphotype disappeared (Figure 2F–H), and the culture was ‘reset’ to form the
unimodal colony-size distribution typical of that reported for stationary-phase cultures (Figure 1A,
Levin-Reisman et al., 2010). Taken together, these results show that the SMALL morphotype is
extremely stable during growth, but disappears in stationary phase cultures.

 Mathematical analysis of the bimodal switch in non-activating
conditions
In order to characterize the switching process and measure the switching rates between the two
morphotypes, we fitted the results of the SMALL and BIG colony fractions in non-activating condi-
tions to a model based on switching between two phenotypes with different growth rates
(Balaban et al., 2004) (Figure 3A, Equations 1 and 2, see Materials and methods-Mathematical
model). BIG bacteria (B) have a higher growth rate and can switch to the SMALL morphotype with
rate a, whereas SMALL bacteria (S) can switch to the BIG morphotype with rate b. The model repro-
duced our experimental observations and suggested that upon growth in non-activating conditions,
the switching rate from BIG to SMALL is about 10 times higher than from SMALL to BIG, resulting in
a stable co-existence of the two morphotypes. Furthermore, the time scale of the switching from
SMALL to BIG was extremely long, requiring more than 100 hr and many generations to reach
steady state (see Materials and methods-Mathematical model).
Figure 1. EPEC displays the bimodal colony size after virulence activation. Bacterial cultures of EPEC or E. coli K-12 were grown overnight in LB media
(Non-Activation) or in DMEM for 3 hr at 37˚C to OD600 ~0.3 (Activation). Cultures were then diluted, plated on LB agar, and incubated at 32˚C (non-
activating conditions). Colony appearance time was monitored by ScanLag at 15 min intervals. The resulting histograms show (A, B, C, D) the fractions
of colonies detected at each time point and (E, F) colony size distributions 1000 min after plating. Colonies larger or smaller than 105 pixels were

 Prediction and measurements of switching dynamics in activating
conditions
The switching rates extracted from the growth of EPEC bacteria in non-activating conditions result in
slow dynamics of switching between the two morphotypes. However, already after 3 hr of growth in
activating conditions, we observe a high proportion of SMALL morphotypes, suggesting that the
switching rate from BIG to SMALL in activating conditions is higher than in non-activating conditions.
Our model predicted that longer exposure to activating conditions would lead to a higher percent-
age of the SMALL morphotype. In order to evaluate the predictive value of the model and the
switching rates under activating conditions, we diluted a stationary phase culture into DMEM and
monitored BIG and SMALL colony ratios over time. We found that the switching from BIG to SMALL
was tenfold faster under activating conditions than under non-activating conditions (Figure 3B and
Materials and methods-Mathematical model). As a result, within a few hours under activating condi-
tions, the SMALL morphotype dominated the culture. Similarly to growth in LB, stationary phase
resets the culture to unimodality (Figure 3B,C). Taken together, these results show that although
the bimodal switch generates variability both under activating and non-activating conditions, the
higher switching rate under activating conditions results in a fast increase of the SMALL to BIG ratio.
In both conditions, stationary phase resets the culture to a unimodal BIG population.

 PerA and PerB are sufficient for the bimodal phenotype
Activating conditions, which were shown above to increase the SMALL/BIG ratio, are known to acti-
vate the expression of key transcriptional regulators of EPEC virulence including Ler, GrlA, PerA,
and PerC (Figure 4A, reviewed in Clarke et al., 2003; Mellies et al., 2007). We tested for possible
involvement of these regulators in the BIG to SMALL switch and found that Ler and GrlA are not
required for the bimodal colony size phenotype (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In contrast, the
EPEC strain cured of the EAF plasmid, which encodes the perABC operon, lost the capacity to gen-
erate bimodality and produced only BIG colonies (Figure 4B). Complementing this strain with the
EAF plasmid restored the bimodal phenotype. To identify the EAF plasmid genes required to estab-
lish the bimodality, we examine mutant strains DperA, DperC, and DbfpA (Figure 4B, Figure 4—fig-
ure supplement 1). Notably, only the DperA mutant failed to exhibit bimodality. Importantly, PerA
is the autoactivator and thus the perA mutant is deficient in expressing the entire perABC operon.
Complementing the DperA strain with a low copy number plasmid, containing the perABC operon
with its native regulatory region transcriptionally fused to gfp (pPerABC-GFP)restored the bimodal-
ity. In this case, the SMALL colonies appeared later and were more abundant than in the wt strain,
probably due to excessive PerABC expression. These results show that the per operon is required
for the co-existence of the BIG and SMALL morphotypes, whereas PerC, GrlA, Ler, T3SS biogenesis,
and BFP formation were not required for colony size bimodality (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).
To find whether PerA or PerB underlie the bimodality, we deleted different fragments from the
pPerABC-GFP plasmid resulting in pPerA-GFP, pPerB-GFP or pPerAB-GFP. Notably, we kept the
native regulatory region implying that in all cases PerA is required for expression. We transformed
the DperA mutant with plasmids expressing PerA-GFP, PerB-GFP or PerAB-GFP. Whereas comple-
mentation of DperA with PerA-GFP or PerB-GFP expressing plasmids resulted in unimodal colony
morphotypes (Figure 5A), the PerAB-GFP plasmid restored bimodality, indicating that both PerA
and PerB are required for the bimodality. Microscopic observations show that GFP expression is
bimodal in pPerAB-GFP plasmids, while uniformly high in pPerA-GFP (Figure 5B). PerB and GFP
cannot be expressed from pPerB-GFP in the absence of PerA and accordingly no GFP was observed
in DperA mutant containing this plasmid (Figure 5). Expression of GFP from this plasmid was
restored in the wt EPEC (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These results show that both PerA and
PerB expression are required for the co-existence of the BIG and SMALL morphotypes. To deter-
mine whether other EAF plasmid factors are required for the growth bimodality, we transformed E.
Coli K-12 MG1655 strain with the above pPer plasmids and found that co-expression of PerA and
PerB is sufficient for induction of bimodality also in this strain. In agreement with the results obtained
in the DperA EPEC strain, PerA or PerB alone failed to generate bimodality (Figure 5). These results
show that PerAB expression generates a bimodality of growth also without the EAF plasmid,
although the phenotype was milder (i.e. the growth difference between the two morphotypes is
smaller) (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).
Bimodality of perABC expression during activation underlies colony-
size bimodality
We next asked whether the colony-size bimodality correlates with bimodality in perABC expression
in the progenitor cells, namely the founders of each colony. We subjected a culture of the DperA
EPEC complemented with pPerABC-GFP to activating conditions and measured GFP expression by
microscopy (Figure 6A). We detected a bimodal expression of the perABC-gfp operon. Further-
more, the bacteria that did not express GFP were larger and divided more rapidly than those that
expressed GFP. To correlate between perABC-gfp expression and colony size, we used Fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect separately the GFP-OFF and GFP-ON bacteria
(Figure 6B). Each subpopulation was then plated and analyzed by ScanLag (Figure 6C,D). The
results showed that the GFP-OFF bacteria grew in BIG colonies, whereas the GFP-ON bacteria gen-
erated almost exclusively SMALL colonies. Similar results were obtained using wild-type EPEC trans-
formed with pPerABC-GFP, whereas no bimodality was observed with control pZS11*GFP plasmid
expressing GFP from a synthetic constitutive promoter (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Taken
together, these results show that during growth in activating conditions, a bimodal expression of the
perABC operon is established in progenitor cells that lead to bimodality in colony size upon plating
and growth in non-activating conditions.

 Bimodality of perABC expression results in bimodal ler expression upon
shift from activating to non-activating conditions
Ler is the T3SS master regulator, and under activating conditions its expression is induced by two
redundant positive regulators, PerC and GrlA (Bustamante et al., 2011; Go
´mez-Duarte and Kaper,
1995; Porter et al., 2004) (Figure 4A). Under activating conditions, we observed that Ler expres-
sion from chromosomal ler-gfp transcriptional fusion was unimodal (Figure 7A–C), as previously
reported (Berdichevsky et al., 2005; Roe et al., 2004). This was in contrast to the bimodal perABC-
gfp expression in the same conditions (Figure 6A,B). We predicted, however, that upon shifting the
culture from activating to non-activating conditions, which suppresses GrlA activity, only the sub-
population that expresses perABC will continue to express ler, resulting in bimodal Ler expression.
As predicted, we found that upon shifting from activating to non-activating conditions, Ler-GFP
expression was reduced in approximately 50% of the bacterial population and became bimodal
(Figure 7B,D). Time-lapse microscopy of bacteria taken from BIG and SMALL colonies showed that,
as expected, Ler expression was uniformly high in the SMALL population but bimodal in the BIG
population (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These results suggest that the bimodal expression
from perABC during activating conditions does not result in bimodal Ler expression since GrlA,
which is redundant to PerC, activates ler expression regardless of whether PerC is expressed or not.
However, upon shifting to non-activating conditions and the bimodal expression of perABC drives
the bimodality of Ler expression.
Long-term memory of the virulence state is controlled by the per
operon through a hysteretic switch
The stability of the SMALL morphotype suggests that the virulence switch mediated by the per
operon is a hysteretic switch, maintaining long-term memory of the previous state as shown in
Figure 8A. Accordingly, the entire population switches to a virulent state upon activation, character-
ized by unimodal and high ler expression (Figure 8A, State 1). In contrast, per expression during
activation is typically bimodal, although prolonged activation eventually shifts the population to
SMALL (Figure 3B). When transferred to non-activating conditions, the per-ON bacteria remain
hypervirulent, expressing both Ler and PerABC, leading to SMALL colony morphotype (Figure 8,
State 2). This hypervirulent state is maintained for an extremely long time but is ‘reset’ to the non-
virulent state during stationary phase (Figure 8, State 3). When a ‘reset’ population is subjected to
non-activating conditions the majority remains in the BIG morphotype (Figure 8, State 4). This
insight leads to several predictions. Firstly, the SMALL morphotype should express virulence factors
downstream of both ler and per (i.e., BFP and T3SS), even after many generations of growth in non-
activating conditions. Secondly, the BIG colony morphotype should consist mainly of non-virulent
bacteria with ~20% of hypervirulent ones. Finally, the deletion of the per operon should not prevent
the activation of virulence (i.e., T3SS expression can be driven through the GrlA-Ler path), but erase
the hysteretic switch, and thus ler expression and virulence of all bacteria, should decline as soon as
the DperA bacteria are transferred to non-activating conditions (Figure 8B).
In order to test these predictions, we extracted proteins from EPEC and DperA cultures grown
under conditions that would lead to states shown schematically in Figure 8A,B and performed West-
ern blot analysis using antibodies raised against BfpA, EspB, and Tir. BfpA, an important constituent
of the type IV pilli, was used as readout for PerA activity, and the T3SS proteins EspB and Tir were
used as readout for Ler activity. As an additional negative readout of virulence, we used flagellin
(FliCH6), which is known to be repressed by GrlA (Iyoda et al., 2006) (Figure 4A). As expected, in
EPEC, EspB, Tir, and BfpA, but not FliC were highly expressed upon growth in activating conditions
(Figure 8A,C: State 1). Similar expression patterns were seen in SMALL colony bacteria, despite the
fact that at least 20 generations had passed since the transition from activating to non-activating
conditions (Figure 8A,C: State 2). In contrast, bacteria from BIG colonies showed low expression lev-
els of all virulence factors and high levels of FliC. The residual expression of BfpA, EspB, and Tir by
the BIG colony bacteria is consistent with the prediction of ~20% SMALL variants in the BIG popula-
tion (Figure 8A,C: State 4). Finally, the DperA mutant showed high expression of EspB and Tir when
grown in activating conditions, consistent with activation of ler expression by GrlA (Figure 8B,D:
State 1). However, expression of these proteins rapidly diminished when the mutant culture was
shifted to growth under non-activating conditions (Figure 8B,D: State 4), leading to a pattern

to the pattern of expression in the stationary phase LB culture (Figure 8A,C: State 3).

 Bimodality in per operon expression results in bimodality of host cells
infectivity
Our results show that the SMALL colonies express a high level of functional T3SS and BFP and thus
may be hypervirulent. To determine whether this expression pattern results in a hypervirulent pheno-
type, we first tested SMALL colony bacteria for BFP functionality by monitoring BFP-mediated self-
aggregation (Bieber et al., 1998). Time-lapse microscopy showed that, as expected, resuspended
SMALL colony bacteria rapidly aggregated, whereas BIG colony bacteria remained mostly planktonic
(Figure 9A, Video 1 (BIG), Video 2 (SMALL), Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). In both cases, the
aggregates disintegrated upon reaching stationary phase, consistent with the resetting of colony-
size bimodality (Figure 2F–H) and the significant reduction in BfpA production in stationary phase
(Figure 8C).
In order to determine whether high levels of per operon expression correlate with higher infectiv-
ity, we followed the infection of Hela cells with EPEC DperA bacteria transformed with pPerABC-
GFP plasmid. We used microscopy to evaluate perABC-gfp expression, aggregation (i.e., microcol-
ony formation), and attachment to host cells. The results showed that the bacteria that expressed
PerABC (GFP-ON, per-ON) formed microcolonies that rapidly attached to the epithelial cells
(Figure 9B). In contrast, the GFP-OFF (per-OFF) bacteria remained mostly planktonic and unat-
tached. These results show that the per-ON bacteria, which generate the SMALL colony morpho-
type, display higher infectivity than per-OFF bacteria.
We next asked whether this high infectivity is maintained in bacteria taken from SMALL colonies
(i.e., bacteria originating from per-ON bacteria but that were grown in non-activating conditions for
many generations). We infected HeLa cells with a 1:1 mix of bacteria from SMALL and BIG colonies
tagged with constitutive YFP and mCherry (Gefen et al., 2008), respectively, and compared infectiv-
ity by time-lapse microscopy (Figure 9C, Figure 9—figure supplement 1B). During the first hours of
infection, the SMALL bacteria formed aggregates (microcolonies) and almost no planktonic single
bacteria were found in the surrounding medium (Figure 9C–E, Figure 9—figure supplement 1B,
Videos 3 and 4). Furthermore, these SMALL microcolonies attached to host cells, an indication of
BFP function (Figure 9—figure supplement 2), induced actin rearrangement in the host, and
invaded into the host cell, indicatives of T3SS functionality (Figure 9—figure supplement 2, Fig-
ure 9—figure supplement 3). In contrast, only a few bacteria that originated from BIG colonies
were organized into attached microcolonies, and formation of actin rearrengement as well as inva-
siveness were marginal (Figure 9C–E, Figure 9—figure supplement 1B, Videos 3 and 4, Figure 9—
figure supplement 3). These results show that the SMALL morphotype maintains high infectivity and
expresses functional BFP and T3SS even after many generations of growth in non-activating
conditions.
Discussion
This study showed, for the first time to our knowledge, that the virulence machinery of a human
pathogen, EPEC, is controlled by a hysteretic switch with long epigenetic memory. We showed that
PerA and PerB are sufficient for this hysteretic switch. We found that when exposed to virulence-
activating conditions all EPEC bacteria upregulate expression of T3SS virulence genes, unlike the
bimodal virulence expression observed in Salmonella. However, we found that the EPEC virulent
population is bimodal for expression of the per regulated genes, resulting in two coexisting virulent
sub-populations of bacteria, planktonic (per-OFF) and aggregative (per-ON), with different infection

 and invasion abilities. The latter population constitutively expresses both BFP and T3SS for many
generations, rapidly attaches to host cells as microcolonies, delivers effectors into the host cell, and
invades it. This rapid invasion may protect the bacteria against the host immune system and estab-
lish persistent infection (Tuchscherr et al., 2011).
The striking difference between the two phenotypes that we unveiled is in their abilities to main-
tain their virulence state when transferred to non-activating conditions. Whereas the per-OFF bacte-
ria no longer express ler regulated genes upon transfer to non-activating conditions, the per-ON
bacteria maintain high expression of the ler regulated virulence genes even after tens of generations
of growth in non-activating conditions. This per-ON long-term memory may allow the pathogen to
overcome transit through niches of non-activating conditions without a drop in virulence level. An
extreme case of this type of transit is the host-to-host transit through the fecal-oral route. In addi-
tion, the long-term memory per-ON state may set the stage for further diversification within this sub-
population, possibly creating a range of infective phenotypes, each adapted to a different niche
and/or stage of infection within the host intes-
tine. Alternatively, the hysteretic switch that ena-
bles the coexistence of two different phenotypes
may be attributable to bet-hedging (i.e. to risk
spreading in the absence of a predictable envi-
ronment). The SMALL morphotype infects host
cells more rapidly but bears the cost of express-
ing virulence genes and exposure to the immune
system, whereas the BIG morphotype grows
faster and is less immunogenic. Notably, bimo-
dality is stable mainly under non-activating con-
ditions, suggesting that insufficient cues from
the environment regarding bacterial residence
inside or outside the host may promote a bet-
hedging strategy (Kussell and Leibler, 2005).
We found that PerA is central for this switch
and that the PerA-regulated perABC operon
exhibits bimodal expression when co-expressed
with PerB. Notably, the per operon is regulated
by PerA auto-activation (Figure 4A), a network
motif that has been shown to lead to bimodality

which PerB may be required.
Specific
environmental
conditions
(termed
here ‘activating conditions’) strongly increased
the per-ON frequency in the population by
enhancing the switching rate by a factor of ~10
compared to non-activating conditions. Thus,
growth under activating conditions resulted in
almost 100% of per-ON cells at steady state. Importantly, our results show that per expression is
essential for establishing a hysteretic long-term memory switch, resulting in the co-existence of per-
OFF and per-ON subpopulations, of which the latter remains stable even in the face of drastic
changes in the environmental conditions, such as shifts in temperature and growth media. Given this
stability, a single bacterium in the per-ON state generates a colony of the SMALL morphotype in
which most of the bacteria remain per-ON and
are primed for rapid infection of host cells. Inter-
estingly, the per-ON memory vanished once
growth reaches stationary phase, and the entire
population switched to per-OFF.
Bimodality in expression of virulence genes
has been extensively studied in Salmonella and
thus it is useful to compare the two pathogens.
In EPEC, expression of the Ler master regulator,
and thus expression of T3SS, is high and unimo-
dal under activating conditions. Redundant acti-
vation of the ler promoter by independent
regulators (GrlA and PerC) ensures that all bac-
teria express virulent genes during activation. In

The per-switch acts hysteretically, locking the
expression of ler and activation of virulence in an
‘ON’ state, even when bacteria are switched
back to non-activating conditions. Thus in EPEC,

 ler expression becomes bimodal only when the bacteria are transferred to non-activating conditions,
resulting in the co-existence of non-activated bacteria and bacteria that are already primed for infec-
tion through constitutive expression of BFP and T3SS. Importantly, we were able to evaluate the
rates of switching between the two EPEC phenotypes and found that the rate from ON to OFF is
extremely slow (several weeks), even under non-activating conditions. A long-lived ON state has
been observed also in Salmonella (Sturm et al., 2011), but upon shifting to non-activating condi-
tions, regulators of virulence decay within 1 to 2 hr (Temme et al., 2008).
The importance of the described hysteretic switch for EPEC virulence is reflected by the conserva-
tion of the switch core: the perABC operon. Recent reports comparing the genome sequences of a
large number of EPEC clinical isolates show that EPEC is an umbrella name for a collection of E. coli
strains belonging to diverse phylogenetic branches that acquired independently, through horizontal
gene transfer, a pathogenicity island encoding T3SS (the LEE island) (Ingle et al., 2016). Notably,
most of these EPEC strains also acquired plasmids containing the perABC operon (Ingle et al.,
2016). Furthermore, strains containing both the LEE and plasmids encoding perABC and bfp oper-
ons cause a more severe disease (Hazen et al., 2015b). Hazen et al. proposed that the contribution
of PerA might be related to regulation of additional virulence-related genes (Hazen et al., 2015b).
Our findings suggest that perABC also enhances the fitness of infecting EPEC by facilitating forma-
tion of long-term memory and stable phenotypic bimodality. The contribution of the per-switch to
virulence in vivo could not be tested since an animal model for EPEC is not available. Pathogens
closely related to EPEC, including enterohemorragic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR),
do not carry the perABC operon. Interestingly, however, heterogeneity in virulence is observed in
these pathogens (Roe et al., 2004; Kamada et al., 2015), but the involved switch and whether it is
also hysteretic have not been studied.
In conclusion, we report here how a hysteretic switch controls the virulence traits of a human
pathogen, EPEC. Our findings and approach should provide a framework to search for similar
switches in other pathogens. Furthermore, this understanding may lead to the development of new
strategies to interfere with the establishment of stable virulence-ON mechanisms and thus reduce
virulence and pathogen spreading to new hosts.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The used bacterial strains, plasmids and primers are listed (Supplementary file 2 and 3).
Activating conditions: Following the procedure in (Kenny et al., 1997), bacterial strains were
grown overnight (O/N) in LB medium (Sigma, Israel) at 37˚C without shaking, diluted 1:40 into
DMEM-HEPES (Gibco, Israel) medium and incubated for 3 hr at 37˚C without shaking to exponential
phase (O.D.~0.3).
Non-activating conditions: bacteria were plated in LB agar at a concentration below 200 cfu/plate
and incubated at 32˚C.
For analysis of bacteria isolate directly from colonies, BIG and SMALL colonies were collected
according to their size at 17 hr (1000 min) after plating and diluted in 0.9% NaCl to density of ~108
bacteria/ml.
Plasmid construction and gene inactivation
Deletion mutants were produced as described (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). pZS*GFP was cre-
ated by replacing the hip promoter of pZS*1HGFP plasmid (Rotem et al., 2010) with the synthetic
PLtetO-1 promoter (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) using 5’-phosphorylated PCR primer, followed by liga-
tion. pPerABC-GFP was created with an isothermal cloning kit (NEB, United States). The hip pro-
moter of pZS*1HGFP was replaced with the genomic region of the perABC operon including the
upstream promoter region. The derivative plasmids: pPerA-GFP, pPerB-GFP and pPerAB-GFP were
produced by single ligation step after excision of the PerAB, PerA/C and PerC respectively (see
Supplementary file 2).

 HeLa cell growth conditions
HeLa cells (Supplementary file 2) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 300 mg/ml L-Glutamine,
100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 mg/ml Streptomycin and 10% FCS at 37˚C and 5% CO2. For infection experi-
ments, HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates. When cultures reached ~106 cells/well, they were
washed twice with PBS and medium was changed to DMEM-HEPES (Gibco, United States) without
supplements. HeLa cells were routinely tested for absence of mycoplasma contamination by EZ-PCR
Mycoplasma Test Kit (Biological Industries LTD., Israel).
Colony growth distribution measurements by ScanLag
Bacteria were diluted to a concentration of 103 bacteria/ml and plated on LB agar. The plates were
placed in a 32˚C incubator on EPSON Perfection 3490 scanners that scan the plates every 15 min
with custom ScanLag software, as described (Levin-Reisman et al., 2010). MatLab based applica-
tions were used to automatically detect colonies in each frame and to monitor the growth of individ-
ual colonies (Software for controlling the scanners and for image analysis can be found at http://bio-
site.phys.huji.ac.il/Materials). The area growth rate of each colony and its time of appearance were
extracted as described (Levin-Reisman et al., 2010)
Experimental measurements of bimodal switching rates
EPEC was grown overnight in LB medium (Sigma, Israel) at 37˚C, diluted to ~1000 cells/ml in DMEM
and grown under activating conditions. The low culture density enabled follow up of many hours of
exponential growth before reaching stationary phase. To eliminate possible artifacts due to the BFP-
mediated-aggregation we induced disaggregation as follows: the culture was divided into tightly
closed Eppendorf tubes, one for each time point. These tubes were subjected to intensive vortex
and kept on ice for 10 min before plating. Disaggregation was confirmed by microscopy. The levels
of BIG and SMALL progenitors in the populations at each time point during growth were determined
by ScanLag.
Time-lapse microscopy
Time-lapse microscopy was performed using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope system. Autofocus
and image acquisition were done by using custom macros in mManager (an open source software
program) to control the microscope, stage, shutters, and camera. The microscope was placed in a
large incubator box (Life Imaging Systems) that controls the temperature to an accuracy of 0.1˚C.
GFP- or YFP-expressing bacteria were imaged using Yellow GFP filter (Ex-500nm, Em-535nm,
Chroma USA); mCherry signal was measured by HcRed1 filter (Ex-575nm, Em-640nm, Chroma USA).
Excitation was performed with LEDs (Coolled, United Kingdom) and images were acquired with a
cooled CCD camera (�75˚C) (Orca II, Back-illuminated, Hamamatsu) and processed with ImageJ
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). X100 NA 1.40 oil objective was used for individual bacterial observation
on agar pads; X63 NA 0.70 long-distance air objective NA for imaging Hela and bacteria in 24-well
plates; X20 was used for imaging growing colonies on a very thin LB + 1.5% agar layer.
To observe the growth of individual bacteria, a LB + 1.5% agarose pad was prepared in a polydi-
methylsiloxane (PDMS) square mold and dried for 10 min at 37˚C. Bacterial samples of 1 ml (~105
cells) were placed between the microscopic slide and the pad inserted into the same PDMS mould
and covered with a coverslip. For microscopic observation of self-aggregation, agarose pads were
not dried and bacteria (5 ml, ~105 cells) originated from suspended colony were placed between
the microscopic slide and the pad.
Western blot analysis
The OD of the cultures was determined and density was adjusted if needed. Bacteria were collected
by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml loading sample buffer per 0.1 O.D. Proteins were
extracted by boiling of the samples and resolved by 12% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast
Gels (Bio-Rad, Israel). Total protein staining was used as a loading control (see Figure 8—figure sup-
plement 1). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for standard Western
blot analysis with antibodies raised in rabbits against BfpA (gift from Michael Donnenberg), Tir and
EspB (gift from Gad Frankel), or FliC-H6 (gift from the Israeli Ministry of Health) and secondary anti-
rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody.

 EPEC self-aggregation test
Bacteria were diluted 1:50 in LB media in 24-well plates. The plates were incubated at 32˚C with
mild agitation under non-activating conditions and transferred manually every 30 min to an Epson
Perfection V500 Scanner for imaging of aggregates.
Actin staining for microscopy
HeLa cells were grown on round coverslips within 24-well plates. In the next day cells were washed
and infected with ~106 bacteria/well. Two hours after infection, the wells were washed twice with
PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, 10 min. The coverslips were then washed twice with
TBS, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Actin was stained with
Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, United States) and DNA was stained with Dapi (Molecular
Probes, United States), at a 1:1000 dilution. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS, mounted
with ImumMount (Thermo Scientific, United States) and viewed with a fluorescence inverted micro-
scope with X100 oil objective.
Time-lapse imaging of HeLa cell infection
HeLa cells were seeded in 24-wells plates (NUNC, United States) and grown in 1 ml/well as men-
tioned above. EPEC BIG/pZA21mCherry and SMALL/pZA21YFP colonies (harboring mCherry and
YFP constitutive markers), were suspended, mixed 1:1 and added to the HeLa cells at a concentra-
tion of ~106 bacteria/well. Time-Lapse microscopy was performed directly on 24-wells plates
(NUNC, United States) at 37˚C. The opposite fluorescent markers (i.e. SMALL/pZA21mCherry and
BIG/pZA21YFP) were measured in parallel to rule out effects of markers. The analysis of fluorescent
intensities was performed with ImageJ. The total area occupied by bacteria was measured according
to the yellow fluorescence signal. In order to compare different frames with variable Hela
cell coverage, we normalized the total number of bacteria attached to cells with the total area of
cells in the frame. This area was extracted from phase-contrast images. Planktonic bacteria area was
normalized with the total area of the frame not covered by Hela cells.
Gentamicin protection assay
HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates and infected with EPEC bacteria were incubated at 37˚C for 2 hr.
Gentamicin at a final concentration of 25 mg/ml was added to kill extracellular bacteria with little
effect on intracellular bacteria (Benjamin et al., 1995) and plates were returned to the 37˚C incuba-
tion. Bacteria that survived the gentamicin treatment were counted at 30 min intervals after gentami-
cin addition. To this end cells were washed twice to remove gentymicine, lysed in 1 ml 1% Triton
X-100 to free the intracellular bacteria, which were then pelleted by centrifugation (3 min at 1500g),
resuspended in PBS and spread onto LB agar plates to evaluate bacterial CFU/ml. Isolated colonies
were counted after overnight incubation at 37˚C, and the progeny of BIG-YFP and SMALL-mCherry
colonies were differentiated by color. The time point t = 0 sample was measured before gentamicin
treatment. All bacterial counts were normalized to counts at t = 0 counts. The same results were
obtained with swapped reporter colors, SMALL-YFP and BIG-mCherry.
Direct visualization of live internalized bacteria
EPEC containing a plasmid with IPTG inducible GFP reporter (pSA11) was used to generate SMALL
colonies, which were suspended and used to infect HeLa cells. Two hours post infection gentamicin
was added (25 mg/ml) and after an additional hour IPTG (20 mg/ml) was added to the infected cells.
Only the metabolically active intracellular bacteria that are not exposed to gentamicin are able to
produce GFP in response to IPTG, thus enabling to detect even a small fraction of intracellular bac-
teria by time-lapse microscopy.
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy imaging
For immunostaining experiments, the gentamicin protection assay was performed as described
above, except for the growth of HeLa which was here done on round coverslips inserted into 24-well
plates. HeLa cells were infected with EPEC SMALL/pSA11 bacteria for 2 hr and then treated with 25
mg/ml gentamicin. After 1 hr wells were supplied with IPTG to visualize metabolically active intracel-
lular bacteria. One hour later samples were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde-

red filter (Ex-570nm, Em-620nm) and Hoechst was measured with a Dapi filter (Ex-430nm, Em–
470nm).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
BIG or SMALL colonies were suspended, diluted in PBS to ~105 cells/ml and analyzed using a FACS
Aria III cell-sorter equipped with 488 nm and 561 nm lasers (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Side and
forward scatter of bacteria were determined using log scale SSC/FSC plots with respective thresh-
olds of 200 and 2200. Sorting was done at a minimal flow rate according to GFP intensity criteria.
Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
BIG and SMALL colonies were suspended, diluted 1:200 and bacteria were grown in LB to O.D.~0.3
at 32˚C. DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagene) according the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Genomic extraction, Whole-Genome Sequencing and analysis was done as pub-
lished previously (Goldberg et al., 2014). The WGS raw data are available as NCBI BioProject
PRJNA255355 (Accessions: SRX757584 and SRX757585 for SMALL and BIG respectively)
Mathematical model
We used a simple mathematical model to describe the expected dynamics of switching between the
BIG and SMALL morphotypes. Fitting the experimental results to the data enabled the evaluation of
the switching rates, a (BIG to SMALL) and b (SMALL to BIG), under virulence activating conditions.
Surprisingly, we found that what was considered as ‘non-activating conditions’, namely growth in LB,
does not abolish the switching but rather reduces its frequency.
The two morphotypes, BIG (B) and SMALL (S) are characterized by different growth rates, mB and
ms respectively, and switching rates, a and b, respectively (Equations 1 and 2 in Figure 3A). The ana-
lytical solution of Equations 1 and 2, as detailed in (Balaban et al., 2004), is:

Switching rate under non-activating conditions
In this work, the difference between the growth rates of the two morphotypes, "=mB� ms, is small
compared to the growth rates as determined by time-lapse microscopy: mB=1.24 ± 0.02 h�1
(N = 98), mS=1.18 ± 0.02 h�1 (N = 56), and e = 0.06 ± 0.03 h�1 (means ± s.e.). Microscopic observa-
tions revealed that b is smaller than all other rates. In the limit of b = 0, Equation 1 can be greatly
simplified, and, when starting from the BIG morphotype (i.e., S0 = 0), as done in the experiment of
Figure 2A–E, we expect:

 determined above, and fitting Equation 1 to the only free parameter, b, results in b = 0.0017 (c.i.
0.001, 0.007) h�1.
Switching rate under activating conditions
The switching rates under activating conditions (Figure 3B) were determined by monitoring the
dynamics of formation of SMALL and BIG colonies from a culture containing only BIG morphotypes,
as well as the growth of the whole culture (Figure 3C). Fitting the experimental data using a 2-
parameter fit for Equation 2 yields: a = 0.24 (c.i. 0.10, 0.37) h�1, D=a�e=0.21 (c.i. 0.10, 0.31) h�1.
Note that the key parameter that controls the time-scale of population dynamics is D= a-", the
difference between the loss of BIG due to switching and gain in BIG due to faster growth of BIG vs.
SMALL bacteria. Whereas this parameter is positive under activating conditions, leading to a domi-
nance of the SMALL morphotype at steady state, it has an opposite sign under non-activating condi-
tions, predicting a stable co-existence of the two morphotypes even when b = 0.
In summary, the mathematical model of switching enabled us to predict the population dynamics
of the SMALL and BIG sub-populations in non-activating and in activating conditions. The main
parameter that was found to change is a, the switching rate from BIG to SMALL, which increases
more than 10-fold in activating conditions. Finally, the switching rate from SMALL to BIG, b, was
found to be extremely low compared to all other time-scales, enabling a long-term memory of the
SMALL morphotype over hundreds of generations.
