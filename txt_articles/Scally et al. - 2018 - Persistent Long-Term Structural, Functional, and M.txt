ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized 
acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. 
Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of 
left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional 
consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.
METHODS: In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients 
with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and 
comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed 
clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic 
resonance including cardiac 31P-spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women 
(97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) 
months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting 
symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on 
exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 
mL/kg/min, P<0.001; increased VE/Vco2 slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, P=0.002). 
Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, 
patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac 
deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, ‒16±1.0 versus 
‒23±1.5%, P<0.001; global longitudinal strain, ‒17±1 versus ‒20±1%, 
P=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 
ms, P<0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-
adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including 
demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with 
persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Taken together our findings 
demonstrate that after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, patients develop a 
persistent, long-term heart failure phenotype.

The Aftermath of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
T
akotsubo cardiomyopathy has a dramatic clinical 
presentation, mimicking an acute myocardial infarc-
tion (MI).1 It is characterized by a precipitating major 
stressful event and diagnosed when invasive cardiac cath-
eterization demonstrates unobstructed coronary arteries 
and ballooning of the left ventricle. This can lead to major 
left ventricular dysfunction and acute heart failure. In the 
weeks after onset, the left ventricular dysfunction gradu-
ally recovers, which leads to the commonly accepted be-
lief that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient and self-
limiting condition. This concept has been reinforced by 
the absence of demonstrable myocardial damage on 
routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.2
We have previously shown severe global edema of 
both the left and right ventricles associated with pro-
found cardiac energetic impairment in the acute stages 
of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.3,4 These abnormalities do 
not completely resolve by 4 months and occur in appar-
ent contradistinction to the recovery of left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction. In the current study, we explored 
whether long-term (>1 year) abnormalities persist after 
an acute episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Specifi-
cally, we hypothesized that a persistent impairment in 
cardiac energetic status (primary end point) takes place, 
which, despite a normalized resting left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction, results in persistent symptoms and car-
diac limitation during cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
(peak Vo2 as secondary end point).
METHODS
The data-analytic methods and study materials will be made 
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the 
results or replicating these findings. 
This was an observational cross-sectional case-control 
study of patients with prior (>12 months) takotsubo car-
diomyopathy. All cases had to have a previously established 
diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy fulfilling the Mayo 
Clinic5 and the European Society of Cardiology‒Heart Failure 
Association criteria,6 plus evidence of absence of fibrosis on 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had invasive 
coronary angiography and left ventriculography at the time 
of the initial diagnosis. All patients were identified from the 
Scottish Takotsubo Registry, and age-, sex-, and comorbidity-
matched control subjects from the University of Aberdeen 
volunteer database were invited to participate. To match the 
comorbidities of the takotsubo participants precisely, control 
subjects were chosen to (1) be healthy and on no medication, 
(2) have isolated hypertension on 1 antihypertensive medica-
tion only, or (3) have diabetes mellitus (diet or metformin con-
trolled). The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee), and all 
subjects gave written informed consent.
Clinical Assessment
Patients underwent a clinical assessment for symptom bur-
den, including New York Heart Association status and qual-
ity of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire). 
Control subjects were carefully assessed by an experienced 
clinician, incorporating a detailed history and clinical exami-
nation. All participants underwent venous blood sampling 
for assessment of clinical hematology and biochemistry (full 
blood count, urea, creatinine, and electrolytes), brain natri-
uretic peptide (BNP) and a range of inflammatory cytokines. 
Exercise tolerance and metabolic performance were assessed 
using treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing, with further 
measurements of BNP at peak and 15 minutes after peak 
exercise. Structure and function of the heart were assessed 
using transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic 
resonance, including assessment of cardiac energetic status 
by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Biomarkers of Cardiovascular 
Homeostasis and Inflammatory Status
Serum was separated after centrifugation at 50 g for 10 
minutes and stored at ‒80°C. BNP concentrations were 
determined using an immunoassay (Alere Triage MeterPro). 
Quantification of serum cytokine concentrations—growth-
regulated protein or chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, tumor 
necrosis factor-α, interferon γ, monocyte chemoattractant 
protein 1, and the interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 (chemokine 
ligand 8), IL-10, IL-12p40)—were performed using a bespoke 
commercially available kit (MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/
Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel; Merck Millipore).
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on a tread-
mill (Marquette 12000, GE) integrated with a metabolic sys-
tem (Quark PFT, Cosmed) using a progressive incremental 
ramp protocol of 1 km/h and base elevation of 1% gradient 
every minute until volitional exhaustion. Oxygen consumption 
(Vo2) was measured breath by breath, and 12-lead ECG, heart 
and respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturations 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy have 
persistent limiting symptoms and reduced exercise 
capacity.
• Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with long-
term structural and metabolic alterations in the 
myocardium.
• Takotsubo cardiomyopathy progresses to a persis-
tent heart failure phenotype.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Patients should be counseled regarding the long-
term symptomatic consequences of takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy.
• A better understanding of the mechanisms and 
the development of therapeutic interventions 
are urgently required to improve the outcome of 
patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

were measured throughout. Any test with a respiratory 
exchange ratio (RER) <1.1 was classed as suboptimal, and 
subjects with a forced expiratory volume end of the first sec-
ond <70% of predicted were excluded from these analyses.
Transthoracic Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed using a Vivid E9 equipped 
with a 2.5-MHz (M5S) transducer (GE Vingmed) by a single 
experienced British Society of Echocardiography-accredited 
sonographer. Three cardiac cycles in each of the standard 
parasternal long-axis, short-axis, apical 4-, apical 3-, and apical 
2-chamber views were obtained at end-expiratory breath hold 
at a frame rate of ≥85 Hz and stored for off-line analysis. Any 
subject with left bundle-branch block on ECG was excluded 
from the strain and deformation analysis. Image analysis was 
performed using EchoPAC software (version 1.13) as previously 
described measuring left ventricular longitudinal, radial and cir-
cumferential strain, and deformation indices.7
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 
31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
All participants were scanned on a 3T Philips Achieva scan-
ner (Best). 31P-CMR spectroscopy (31P-CMRS) was acquired 
using a 14-cm diameter transmit and receive 31P surface coil 
as described previously.3 A nonwater-suppressed 1 H point-
resolved spectroscopy acquisition was used to monitor reso-
nance frequency determination and B0 shimming over the 
31P-CMRS volume of interest, which was positioned to cover 
the entire interventricular septum. The 31P-CMRS acquisi-
tion was an ECG-gated image-selected in vivo spectroscopy 
sequence, triggered to mid-late diastole, with a repetition 
time of ≥10 seconds. A 5-channel cardiac coil was used to 
acquire cine imaging, early and late gadolinium enhancement 
(Gadovist, 0.1 mmol/kg) with swap of the phase-encoding 
direction, and pre- and postcontrast Modified Look-Locker 
Imaging T1 mapping.8 Data for T1 mapping were acquired 
with 3(3)3(3)5 and 5(3)3 schemes for native and postcontrast 
T1 measurement, respectively. 31P-CMRS data were analyzed 
in JMRUi3.0 as described previously.3 The phosphocreatine/γ-
adenosine triphosphate (PCr/γATP) ratio (which is the gold 
standard for in vivo assessment of myocardial energetic sta-
tus)9 was determined after the γATP was corrected for blood 
contamination and PCr/γATP ratios were saturation-corrected 
as described previously.10–12 To ensure that spectra were of 
good quality, Cramér-Rao standard deviations of all peaks 
were calculated, and only those <20% were accepted. The 
CMR images were analyzed in CMR Tools (Cardiovascular 
Imaging Solutions) for computation of left ventricular volumes 
and mass. T1 maps were imported into Segment (Medviso), 
and T1 values were generated for each of the 16 segments 
of the 17-segment model13 (omitting the true apex), and the 
myocardial extracellular volume fraction was calculated as 
described previously.4
Our interobserver variabilities for strain echocardiogra-
phy, 31P-CMRS, and CMR have been reported previously and 
ranged between 3 and 6±1% to 2% for all strain echocar-
diography parameters, 1.5 and 2.7±0.5 to 1.5% for cardiac 
magnetic resonance inclusive of T1 mapping, and 5±2% 
for cardiac spectroscopy. Our interstudy variability for 
healthy volunteers were 5±2% for strain echocardiography, 
2±0.5% for cardiac magnetic resonance and T1 mapping, 
and 6±2% for PCr/γATP ratio.3,4,7
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistics 
version 24.0 and R version 3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing). Case and control groups were compared by anal-
ysis of variance, with age and sex as covariates, to reduce the 
unexplained residual variability and increase the power of the 
comparison. Because some medications/comorbidities were not 
present in control subjects, data were analyzed both with and 
without these as covariates (the data without these additional 
covariates are reported because they did not affect the conclu-
sions). Log-transformed values were used where distributions 
appeared skewed. Means were calculated and adjusted for age 
and sex distribution in the whole dataset. Data are shown as 
mean±SEM or median (range). Statistical significance was set 
at P<0.01 rather than the usual 0.05 to reduce the risk of type 
I errors resulting from multiple hypothesis tests.
RESULTS
Thirty-seven patients with prior takotsubo cardiomy-
opathy were recruited at a median time of 20 months 
(range 13–39) from the index event. They were pre-
dominantly middle-age or elderly (median 65 years, 
range 34–81) women. Their demographics and acute 
takotsubo episode details are summarized in Table 1. 
Thirty-seven control subjects of a similar median age 
64 (range 34–86), sex (36 female), and comorbidity 
distribution were enrolled (Table 1). The diagnosis of a 
psychiatric illness predated the acute takotsubo event 
in all cases.
Symptoms
The majority (88%) of patients with prior takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy had symptoms including fatigue 
(74%), shortness of breath (43%), palpitations (8%), 
and chest pain (8%). Most patients were New York 
Heart Association class I (70%), 10 patients were New 
York Heart Association class II (27%), and 1 patient was 
New York Heart Association class III (3%). All control 
subjects were asymptomatic.
Thirty-five patients completed the Minnesota Living 
with Heart Failure Questionnaire (Figure 1). The median 
total score was 13 (range 0–76). Only 3 patients report-
ed a score of 0, and patients scored higher in the physi-
cal domain with a median of 7 (range 0–33) than in the 
emotional domain with a median of 1 (range 0–25).

Consumption)

thy, 1 had both breathlessness and ischemic changes

ercise to an RER of 1.1, and their results are shown in 
Table 2, Figure 2, and Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement. No desaturation on exercise occurred in 
either group. Blood pressure and heart rate responses 
as well as the breathing reserve were similar between 
groups. Compared with control subjects, patients with 
prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had a lower peak Vo2 
and a higher VE/Vco2 slope (P<0.001 and P=0.002, re-
spectively). These findings were consistent irrespective 
of the exclusion of those subjects receiving β-blocker 
therapy (n=5 patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy; 
P=0.004 for peak Vo2 and P=0.003 for VE/Vco2 slope). 
Patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had a 
lower metabolic equivalent than the control subjects 
(P=0.001). There was no significant difference between 
groups in the BNP concentrations at any of the time 
points assessed (rest, peak exercise, or 15 minutes after 
peak exercise) (Table 2).

The Aftermath of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
Echocardiography
Left ventricular ejection fraction and estimated pul-
monary artery pressure were similar in patients with 
prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy and control subjects 
(Table 1). However, compared with control subjects, the 
global left ventricular longitudinal and apical circum-
ferential strain were reduced (P=0.006 and P<0.001, 
respectively). As a result, global left ventricular twist, 
twist rate, and untwist rate were reduced in patients 
with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P<0.001, 
P<0.001, and P=0.009, respectively) (Table 1 and Table 
II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
Indexed left ventricular volumes, mass, and ejection 
fraction were similar in patients with prior takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy and control subjects (Table 1). None 
of the participants had evidence of late gadolinium 
enhancement. However, whole heart native T1 values 
were higher in patients with prior takotsubo cardiomy-
opathy than control subjects (P<0.001). The differences 
were seen in the basal, midcavity, and apical segments 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). No differ-
ence was found in the whole heart-calculated extracel-
lular volume fraction (P=0.3).
Resting cardiac energetic status (PCr/γATP ratio) 
and cardiac spectra were markedly different in pa-
tients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Figure 3). 
When the subject groups were divided by comorbid-
ity status (hypertension, diabetes mellitus), they had 
similar PCr/γATP ratios as those without (Table 3, 
Figure 3).

(P=0.08), but all other cytokine concentrations were 
similar between the groups (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement). 
Clinical hematology and biochemistry were within 
normal limits in all participants (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This is the first detailed cross-sectional case-control 
study investigating the long-term structural and func-
tional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We 
demonstrate that most patients with prior takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy have persistent symptoms of heart fail-
ure because of physical rather than emotional disability. 
This finding is consistent with their poor exercise tol-
erance and evidenced by objective reductions in peak 
Vo2 because of cardiac limitation on cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing (increased VE/Vco2 slope). In turn, these 
factors appear to be related to alterations in native T1 
values, impaired left ventricular strain patterns, and re-
duced cardiac energetic status. Taken together, these 
findings demonstrate a substantial and persistent ad-
verse alteration in long-term cardiac morbidity associ-
ated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and define a new 
clinical phenotype in this population.
Our study has a number of important strengths. 
First, we used a rigorous definition of takotsubo car-
diomyopathy and specifically excluded patients with 
any prior overt or covert cardiac disease. Second, we 
had a robust sample size and specifically incorporated 
a control population that was well matched for impor-
tant characteristics and typical comorbidities. Third, we 
deliberately studied patients remote from their index 
event to ensure that we were exploring effects that 
could not be attributable to the acute index episode. 
Finally, we undertook highly detailed symptomatic and 
objective assessments of cardiac structure and function 
using state-of-the-art techniques. Therefore, we believe 
our findings are robust, informative, and novel.
Study Rationale
Despite its dramatic clinical presentation, a fundamental 
characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the spon-
taneous recovery of the left ventricular ejection fraction, 
which returns to normal or near normal in all patients 
over a variable period of time (days to weeks). In contrast 
to this assumption of rapid and complete recovery, 2 
large registries have recently and independently reported 
that the long-term mortality of takotsubo cardiomyopa-
thy appears comparable to that of patients with MI.14–16 
Because these prognostic registry data are in apparent 
contradiction with the universally observed resolution of 
left ventricular ejection fraction, the key question aris-
ing is: what additional processes intervene to confer on 
these patients such an unexpectedly poor prognosis? 
Our study provides important mechanistic data that may 
help explain some of these findings.
Exercise Capacity and Metabolic 
Performance
It was surprising and noteworthy that nearly half of our 
patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy were un-
able to exercise sufficiently to achieve the required RER 
of 1.1. Their attempted but unachieved cardiopulmo-
nary exercise test strengthens the argument that these 
patients experience marked exercise limitation, mostly 
represented by their symptoms of general fatigue. Even 
in those patients who achieved an RER >1.1,  several 
important abnormal characteristics were present, in-
cluding lower peak Vo2 and higher VE/Vco2 slope. Un-

The Aftermath of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
like other typical heart failure phenotypes, patients with 
prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had an appropriate 
blood pressure response and no chronotropic incom-
petence with exercise. Their normal oxygen saturation 
at maximal exercise and normal breathing reserve ruled 
out a respiratory cause for their peak Vo2 reduction.

The Aftermath of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
Despite their normal left ventricular ejection fraction, 
these metabolic characteristics are strongly suggestive 
of a heart failure phenotype. Both peak Vo2 and VE/
Vco2 slope are predictors of cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality in heart failure of several etiologies.17–19 
The finding of a lower forced expiratory volume in pa-
tients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy is perhaps 
surprising and unexplained, although patients with oth-
er heart failure syndromes also have a reduced forced 
expiratory capacity.20 Although only detected as a mild 
reduction (all forced expiratory volumes were >90% 
of predicted), this may also be a feature of post-ta-
kotsubo–cardiomyopathy, although the less likely pos-
sibility of subclinical and previously unrecognized lung 
pathology of a different etiology in this group has not 
been entirely ruled out.
Functional and Structural Abnormalities 
of the Left Ventricle and Cardiac 
Energetic Status
How do we account for the increased symptoms and 
markedly reduced exercise capacity in the face of an 
apparently normal left ventricular ejection fraction? We 
report here several important abnormalities of left ven-
tricular performance. Echocardiography strain defor-
mation data reveal subtle abnormalities located mostly 
in the left ventricular apex. Together with the signifi-
cantly basal, midcavity, and apical prolongation of T1 
values suggesting microscopic fibrosis,21,22 this finding 
points to the fact that distinctive and regional intra-
myocardial remodeling processes persist after an acute 
episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, suggesting that 
the heart loses some if its wringing motion mostly in 
the regions acutely affected (the apex and midcavity 
in this cohort studied in this report). Although these 
changes are subtle and do not result in any marked, 
readily identifiable remodeling, such as that seen to 
occur after MI, they do have an impact on the func-
tional status and development of heart failure symp-
toms. These data are in keeping with the prediction of 
the acute invasive hemodynamic studies performed by 
Medeiros et al, 23 who predicted that if the mismatch 
observed in the acute phase in the ventricular-arterial 
coupling of these patients remains prolonged, it could 
conceivably contribute to chronic myocardial remodel-
ing. Finally, further evidence comes from the reduction 
in cardiac energetic status of these patients, which is in 
keeping with their exercise/metabolic testing. The low-
er PCr/γATP ratio in patients with takotsubo suggests 
that this abnormality, once established, is ongoing and 
likely contributory to the chronic takotsubo phenotype, 
at least in part. The abnormal cardiac energetic status 
did not appear to be driven by other pathologies such 
as hypertension or diabetes mellitus, which are known 
to negatively impact on cardiac energetic status.24–26 
These comorbidities do so in more advanced clinical 
stages compared with our patients with takotsubo (no 
patient in our cohort was on >1 antihypertensive or 1 
antidiabetic medication, and comorbidities were well 
controlled on this regime without any evidence of end-
organ damage).
Biomarkers of Cardiovascular 
Homeostasis and Inflammation
Given the remarkable intensity and extent of edema 
present in the myocardium in the acute stages of ta-
kotsubo cardiomyopathy, which was shown to be slow 
to resolve, we thought it important to explore the 
long-term pro- and anti-inflammatory status of these 
patients. Although the mean concentrations of all pro-
inflammatory cytokine concentrations were numerically 
higher in patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 
no statistically significant differences were identified. 
We therefore cannot exclude a low-grade systemic or 
myocardial inflammatory state, and this warrants fur-
ther investigation in a larger sample size. Similarly, al-
though the BNP concentrations were not significantly 
different from the control subjects, they were above 
accepted resting reference values for normalcy.27 The 
above-normal BNP values may represent increased myo-
cardial stretch because of increased filling pressures, a 
persistent low-grade inflammation status, or both. Fur-
ther studies are required to elucidate this. However, 
this study was not powered to assess any biomarker 
end points, so these data are of hypothesis-generating 
value at this stage.
Study Limitations
We acknowledge our study’s weaknesses. From our 
study design, it is not possible to determine whether 
these marked abnormalities described here are a con-
sequence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or predate 
and predispose the patient to develop this condition. 
Further work is needed to establish whether predispos-

ing factors are identifiable so that susceptible individu-
als can be investigated or offered potential preventive 
therapies. Moreover, it would be important to estab-
lish cause and effect as well as potential mechanisms 
of pathways of this serious condition. We also ac-
knowledge the potential for case selection bias, in that 
symptomatic patients may have been more inclined to 
volunteer for inclusion in our study. Future prospective 
cohorts may be able to address this concern.
A Gap in Knowledge
Overall, the data in this study fill an important gap of cur-
rently missing but much needed information for the ap-
propriate clinical care of patients with takotsubo. Many 
descriptive studies have focused on the acute presenta-
tion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The invariable recov-
ery of left ventricular ejection fraction has misled the 
medical community into believing that takotsubo cardio-
myopathy is transient and self-limiting. Despite a well-
recognized early mortality28–30 and establishment of clini-
cal features pointing to those at risk,31,32  no data have 
described the physiological and clinical status of these 
patients long term. To the best of our knowledge, these 
data, which demonstrate that patients with takotsubo 
have symptoms and objective findings compatible with 
a heart failure syndrome, are unique and novel in the ta-
kotsubo literature. These findings should impact clinical 
practice primarily in the counseling and follow-up of such 
patients, and they should encourage further research into 
therapies to mitigate symptoms and improve prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS
We describe a new clinical phenotype in patients who 
suffered an acute takotsubo episode >1 year previously. 
This is characterized by impaired cardiac energetic 
status and reduced maximal oxygen consumption on 
exercise because of significant cardiac limitation. Our 
findings demonstrate that patients with prior takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy develop a heart failure phenotype with 
a significant impact on quality of life.
