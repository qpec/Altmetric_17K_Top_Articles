 Commissioning of specialist
palliative care services in England
Harriet Lancaster, Ilora Finlay, Maxwell Downman, James Dumas
ABSTRACT
Objectives Some failures in end-of-life care
have been attributed to inconsistent provision of
palliative care across England. We aimed to
explore the variation in commissioning of services
by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) using
a data collection exercise.
Methods We sent a Freedom of Information
request in the form of an open questionnaire to
all 209 CCGs in England to assess their
commissioning of palliative and end-of-life care
services, mainly focused on the provision of
specialist palliative care services.
Results 29 CCGs provided information about
the number of patients with some form of
palliative care needs in their population. For
specialist palliative care services, CCGs allocated
budgets ranging from £51.83 to £2329.19 per
patient per annum. 163 CCGs (77.90%)
currently commission 7-day admission to their
specialist palliative care beds. 82.84% of CCGs
commission 7-day specialist palliative care
services in patients’ own homes and out-of-hours
services rely heavily on hospice provision. 64
CCGs (31.37%) commission pain control teams,
the majority of whom only operate in regular
working hours. 68.14% of CCGs reported
commissioning palliative care education of any
sort for healthcare professionals and 44.85% of
CCGs had no plans to update or review their
palliative care services.
Conclusions The most important finding from
this exercise is that the information CCGs hold
about their population and services is not
standardised. However, information based on
data that are more objective, for example,
population and total budget for palliative care,
demonstrate wide variations in commissioning.
INTRODUCTION
Specialist palliative care is a specific level
of service provided by professionals who
have undergone specialist training in pal-
liative care and who are members of a
specialist palliative care team (including
specialists in palliative medicine and pal-
liative nursing). Specialist palliative care
often
supports
patients
who
have
a
complex terminal illness, whether dying
or earlier in their illness. More general,
palliative and end-of-life care can be pro-
vided
by any
healthcare
professional,
who is not required to have specific pal-
liative training, but may require support
from
specialist
palliative
care.
For
example, physiotherapists may provide
support to a dying patient, but would not
be required to have end-of-life care train-
ing to do so.1 The National End of Life
Care Intelligence Network (NEoLCIN)
estimate that currently 171 000 people
across the UK receive specialist palliative
care input, but that 92 000 people per
year have unmet palliative care needs.2
In 2015, several reports highlighted defi-
cits in the provision of all palliative care ser-
vices. Marie Curie reported that 65% of
medical
professionals
stated
that
poor
coordination between different palliative
care
agencies
left
many
with
unmet
palliative
care
needs.3
The
Economist
Intelligence Unit suggested that pain control
and out-of-hours services needed improve-
ment,4 and a BBC investigation revealed fail-
ures in out-of-hours medication.5
In May 2015, the Parliamentary and
Health
Service
Ombudsman
(PHSO)
published
a
thematic
report
entitled
‘Dying without Dignity’, which identified
six themes in palliative care failings in
England6
1. Not recognising that people are dying, and
not responding to their needs.
2. Poor symptom control.
3. Poor communication.
4. Inadequate out-of-hours services.
5. Poor care planning.
6. Delays
in
diagnosis
and
referrals
for
treatment.
The 2012 Health and Social Care Act
requires
that
Clinical
Commissioning
Groups (CCGs) provide services to meet
the
needs
of
their
local
population.
However, since this legislation passed, no

 comprehensive survey has reviewed current palliative
care service provision across England.7 8 To address
this, we sought data from all 209 CCGs in England
about the palliative care services they commission.
This study was undertaken during preparation of
the private members bill, Access to Palliative Care Bill
2015–2016, which has been retabled in Parliament in
June 2016. In several parliamentary debates, MPs and
Peers highlighted considerable variation in palliative
care provision with variable services and no clear stan-
dards around what constitutes good end-of-life care.9
The study also uses the W
elsh Palliative Care
Strategy, which was developed in 2008, as a best prac-
tice model for comparison. The strategy aimed to
establish fair access to specialist palliative care across
W
ales on a 24/7 basis at a time when W
elsh Health
Boards faced many of the issues identified by the
PHSO’s report. The success of the W
elsh strategy was
partly due to the development of a funding formula,
which used data on the population to be served to
provide community services, hospice beds and hospital
support teams. This funding formula established ser-
vices in deprived areas that previously had no specialist
palliative care team, with specialist consultant tele-
phone advice available at all times, improved access to
medication, education of generalists and direct patient
evaluation of their care.10 The funding formula was
reiterated in the subsequent 2013 strategy.11
W
e
compared
the
CCG
information
obtained
through this exercise, with the W
elsh funding formula
model to explore differences in hospice bed provision
when a national standard is not in place. W
e also
explored variables in specialist palliative care and
general end-of-life services commissioned.
METHODS
Study design
Data on the commissioning of specialist and generalist
palliative care services in England were obtained
through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.
Prior discussion with a CCG lead clarified that FOI
requests create an unwelcome workload with the
CCG staff and that formal piloting of a questionnaire
on this scale would be difficult. Therefore, continuous
review of the responses was undertaken throughout
the data collection, and adjustments to the FOI
request were made as necessary (figure 1).
An initial questionnaire, composed of 11 open-ended
questions, was constructed and sent to the FOI depart-
ment of all 209 CCGs on 26 June 2015 (see online
supplementary appendix 1).12 After review of the first
10
responses,
Questionnaire
2
(see
online
supplementary appendix 2) was developed, containing 4
additional questions from topic areas that would benefit
from data collection, and sent to all CCGs on 15 July
2015, notifying them of the changes made and request-
ing their resubmission to include all new questions. A
final question was added to the questionnaire and this
final version (Questionnaire 3/online supplementary
appendix 3) was sent to all 209 CCGs on 20 July, detail-
ing the changes that had been made and again requesting
resubmission (figure 1). FOI respondents are administra-
tive staff who report on data held by the CCG and may
consult with clinicians if they need to; it is beyond the
scope of this study to take into account the differing
levels of seniority of the administrative staff. The ques-
tionnaire included a definition of specialist palliative
care to be used by the CCG when answering the FOI
request (see online supplementary appendix 4).
The questions in the FOI request addressed seven
key
themes,
as
shown
in
online
supplementary
appendix 3:
1. CCG population size and their assessment of palliative
care needs
2. Allocated specialist and generalist palliative care budgets
3. Number of specialist palliative care beds
4. Provision
of
specialist
palliative
care
out-of-hours
services
5. Provision of specialist palliative care support teams
6. Education
and
training
in
specialist
palliative
care
provision
7. Future plans for specialist palliative care services
Data collection and analysis
FOI request responses were received over the period 8
July 2015 to 29 December 2015. FOI request regula-
tions state that a response must be provided within 20
working days; therefore, after this period, CCGs

 which had not responded were sent a reminder. A
final reminder was sent to all unresponsive CCGs on
30 November 2015.
In total, 204 CCGs responded. T
en provided a
response
based
only
on
Questionnaire
1,
113
responded to Questionnaire 2 and 81 responded to
the final Questionnaire 3. This was to be expected
after we decided to undertake a method of continuous
review; therefore, the response rates we have calcu-
lated for each question in the Results section of this
paper take into account the questionnaire used by the
CCG and the total number of responding CCGs for
that question. W
e feel this is the best way to analyse
our data fairly.
CCGs were contacted via email throughout the
study and data were collated using Microsoft Excel
onto one central spread sheet by JD and MD.
Answers were summarised, abbreviated or translated
into usable data as needed at the discretion of the
author (ie, budget information was translated into one
quantitative figure for analysis), and all data were veri-
fied before analysis by the lead author (HL). The
amount of information collected was greater than
anticipated; therefore, data pertinent to each of the
themes outlined were used to carry out a basic
descriptive analysis.
The following Microsoft Excel descriptive statistics
were used to analyse the data for each of the themes
outlined above.
Themes 4, 5, 6 and 7 used sum and percentage for-
mulae only; themes 1, 2 and 3 used minimum,
maximum, median, quartiles, mean, sum and correl-
ation coefficient formulae. The box and whisker plot
created for theme 2 was constructed using BoxPlotR
online tool.13 Correlation coefficients were inter-
preted
using
Mukaka’s
‘Rule
of
Thumb
for
Interpreting the Size of a Correlation Coefficient’.14
Data benchmarking
Where CCGs were unable to provide information
about
the
population
size
of
their
area,
the
unweighted populations published by NHS England
in 2014 were used (uplifted by Office for National
Statistics (ONS) for population growth).15
The W
elsh Palliative Care Strategy 2008 funding
formula states that 1 bed (actual bed or hospice at
home virtual bed) per 15 000 population should be
dedicated to specialist palliative care needs. This
figure was used to draw comparisons between the
number of specialist palliative care beds provided by
W
elsh Health Boards and English CCGs for their
populations.10
It was important to correlate the data collected with
the number of people within each CCG population
with palliative care needs. However, the response rate
to this question on our FOI was low. Therefore, we
estimated that 0.75% of a population will have pallia-
tive care needs at any one time, and this was used as a
benchmark throughout the data analysis. This figure is
in accordance with Murtagh et al,16 Gómez-Batiste
et al17 and Marie Curie’s End of Life Care Atlas
(from 2011–2012 data).18
RESULTS
The results have been grouped into the themes of the
questionnaire, as outlined in Methods and online
supplementary appendix 3.
Population size and palliative care needs under the CCG
(Questionnaire 2 and 3) (Q2 and Q3 only)
W
e asked CCGs to provide information about the
size of the population they served and an estimate of
the palliative care needs of that population.
Population
One hundred and seventy-nine CCGs (92.27% of
respondents to Q2 and Q3) provided information
about the size of the population they covered. The
data showed a wide range from 73 000 people up to
915 000.
Number of deaths per year
Sixty-seven CCGs (34.54% of respondents to Q2
and Q3) held information on the total number of
deaths per year in their population. Fifty-two CCGs
also classified these deaths by age-group. On average,

 98.92% were adult (aged 18 and above), 0.61% were
child and 0.62% were neonatal deaths.
Populations with palliative care needs
(Questionnaire 3 only) (Q3 only)
T
wenty-nine CCGs (35.80% of respondents to Q3)
held information about the number of patients with
palliative care needs in the population they serve.
These data showed that on average, 0.43% of the
population at any one time will have palliative care
needs, with a range of 0.10–1.28%, and a median of
0.31%, as estimated by CCGs.
Specialist palliative care services commissioned
(Q2 and Q3 only)
One hundred and eighty-nine CCGs (97.42% of respon-
dents to Q2 and Q3) provided qualitative data about the
services they commissioned. T
able 1 summarises the
number of CCGs which recorded providing a specific
palliative care service in their response.
Specialist palliative care professionals
▸
Forty-eight CCGs (24.53% of all respondents) provided
information about the specialist palliative care consul-
tants,
nurses
and
allied
health
professionals
they
commissioned.
▸
Thirty-eight CCGs provided specific information about
the number of hours worked by these professionals in
the form of a whole time equivalent (WTE) (figure 2).
▸
The correlation coefficient for the WTE commissioned
by specialist palliative care professionals and the esti-
mated palliative care needs of the population is 0.12.
Together
with
figure
2,
this
indicates
a
negligible
correlation.14
Specialist palliative care services in a community setting
(Q2 and Q3 only)
One hundred and eighty-seven CCGs (96.40% of respon-
dents to Q2 and Q3) reported that they commissioned spe-
cialist palliative care services in a community setting with
large variation in the services they provided.
Budget
W
e asked CCGs about the budget they have dedicated
to specialist palliative care services and general pallia-
tive and end-of-life care services for the financial year
2015–2016.
▸
One hundred and forty-two CCGs (69.61% of all
respondents) provided quantitative data on their special-
ist palliative care budgets and 103 CCGs (50.49% of all
respondents) provided quantitative data on their budget
for other palliative care or end-of-life services (table 2).
▸
The range of budgets for both categories was very wide.
For generalist palliative care, the range could mean a
budget difference of up to £6191.65 per patient per year
(using our population estimate of 0.75% of population
has palliative care needs).
▸
Figure 3 shows the distribution of these budgets.
▸
Only 19 CCGs provided data about their current pallia-
tive care needs population and annual specialist palliative
care budget. Analysis of these two parameters gave a cor-
relation coefficient of+0.45, indicating a low positive
correlation between these parameters.14
Beds
W
e asked CCGs how many beds they commissioned
specifically dedicated to specialist palliative care ser-
vices, in a variety of care settings, and the access
patients have to those beds (table 3).

Commissioning Group (CCG) each week, compared with the estimated number of people with palliative care needs in the CCG

 Number of dedicated specialist palliative care beds commissioned
▸
One hundred and twenty-one CCGs (59.31%) provided
information about the number of beds they commis-
sioned, of which 115 responses provided usable data for
the quantitative analysis in table 3, and figure 4. (The
remaining six responses were excluded from analysis as
they did not provide quantitative data for these questions,
or their response covered more than one CCG area).
▸
Thirteen CCGs (6.37% of all respondents) stated they
did not commission dedicated specialist palliative care
beds.
▸
Fifty-five CCGs (29.96% of all respondents) declared
this information was not held by them.
▸
The average number of beds was 13.58 per 1000 people
with palliative care needs in any given area. There was
wide variation, with 1 CCG commissioning 61.65 beds
per 1000 people and another commissioning 0.55 per
1000 people, a range of 61.10.
▸
The correlation coefficient between the number of beds
commissioned and palliative care population is negligible
to low at 0.29.14
▸
Figure 4 shows the number of beds commissioned by each
CCG and their palliative care needs population. Where
CCGs did not provide data on their palliative care needs
population, this has been estimated as 0.75% of the popu-
lation for the CCG (see the Methods section).
▸
Sixty-nine out of 115 CCGs (60%) commission more spe-
cialist palliative care beds than the W
elsh model would
forecast for their population. However, the majority of the
CCGs who provided data on their palliative care needs
assessment (black plots), actually fell below this benchmark
(solid line indicate 1 bed per 15 000) (figure 4).
Patient accessibility to specialist palliative care beds
▸
Analysis of patient admission to specialist palliative care
beds (table 3) shows that 163 CCGs (77.90% of all
respondents) commission for 7-day admission to special-
ist palliative care beds.
▸
According to these data, 74.85% of these beds are from
hospices, and between 4.9% and 6.1% of these beds are
known to be NHS provided.
▸
W
e could not draw conclusion about patient accessibility
to NHS-funded beds as approximately three-quarters of
CCGs responded ‘not applicable’ to this question.
Out-of-hours services
The commissioning of 24/7 specialist palliative care
services varied widely.
▸
One hundred and seventy-two CCGs (84.31% of all
respondents) reported that they commissioned 7-day
access to some form of specialist palliative care, ranging
from some CCGs providing a telephone advice line to
others providing a 24-hour on-call specialist palliative
care team.
▸
One hundred and sixty-nine CCGs (82.84% of all
respondents) reported that they commissioned 7-day spe-
cialist palliative care services for patients in their own
homes. Again, this varied from solely advice lines to
dedicated night care teams.
▸
Table 4 shows the most common 7-day services CCGs
commission in patients own homes. Hospice-led or
hospice-at-home service only was the most common
response, followed by a combination of services, most
likely
hospice
or
hospice-at-home
with
community
nursing or night-time services.
▸
In addition, 163 CCGs (79.90% of all respondents)
reported that they commissioned 24/7 specialist palliative
care advice. Of these:
–
One hundred and twenty-three (75.46%) provided
advice from a consultant to all other out-of-hours’
healthcare professionals in the area.
–
One
hundred
and
seventeen
(71.78%)
provided
advice directly to patients and their carers.

In all three questionnaires, CCGs were asked to provide their annual
budget for specialist palliative care services and their annual budget for
other palliative care and end-of-life services for the financial year 2015–
2016. All ‘budget per patient’ data are calculated using our population
estimate of 0.75% of population, where ‘patient’ refers to a person with
palliative care needs in the CCG population. ‘Usable data’ refers to a
quantitative figure provided by the CCG which could be analysed using
descriptive statistics, and did not represent the budget of more than one
CCG area.

 available out of the usual Monday–Friday, 9:00–17:00
hours. Only 10 CCGs provided details of their services,
showing weekend and evening services were predominantly
on-call consultants or telephone helpline. Fifteen CCGs
named acute trusts in their area which were responsible for
coordinating support teams and 13 CCGs gave no details.
Education
W
e asked CCGs what educational support they com-
mission for specialist palliative care services.
▸
One hundred and thirty-nine CCGs (68.14% of all respon-
dents) commissioned or named a provider who gave edu-
cational support in specialist palliative care. There was
variation in the type of educational support that CCGs
commission, with some offering a comprehensive package
including regular training for GPs and in communication
skills, while others provided occasional education days.
▸
Of those 139, 99 CCGs commissioned educational
support requiring palliative care specialists to educate
other healthcare professionals.
Future
Finally, we asked CCGs if they had plans for any new
specialist palliative care services in the future.
(Q2 and Q3 only)
▸
One hundred and eighty-eight CCGs provided details on
whether they had any plans in place for the future of
their specialist palliative care service.
▸
Of the 188 in this analysis, 101 CCGs had plans for new
services, were under review or had a review planned
with the scope of implementing developments. These
plans were at various stages of development and ranged
from the extension of 7-day services to putting systems
in place to ensure that each patient has a key worker and
access to comprehensive care whenever needed.
▸
Eighty-seven CCGs had no plans for future services.

 DISCUSSION
This study was undertaken during preparation of the
Private Members Bill, Access to Palliative Care Bill
2015–2016, and was subsequently used to inform
debate during the legislative second reading in the
House of Lords (23 October 2015).
Although this exercise aimed to provide evidence of
the variations in the commissioning of palliative and
specialist palliative care services by CCGs, it became
apparent that the actual data held by CCGs were also
inconsistent—some CCGs provided accurate data on
the number of deaths and palliative care needs of
their population, but others declared they did not
hold such information. CCGs, and in turn their ser-
vices, may benefit from national guidelines on what
baseline information should be used to best commis-
sion their healthcare services.
Our
most
reliable
conclusions
come
from
the
annual palliative care budget data. There is limited
correlation between the palliative care needs of the
population and the budget allocated to palliative care
services. Although greater spend per patient does not
necessarily
equal
better
services,
the
fluctuating
budget per patient provides evidence to support con-
cerns about a ‘postcode lottery’ raised in parliamen-
tary debates.19 Further work would be needed to
assess whether budgets truly reflect the needs of the
local population, and how CCGs calculate their
budget allocations.
The data collected on specialist palliative care beds
are encouraging. The majority of CCGs (60%) who
provided quantitative data on beds actually commis-
sion more specialist palliative care beds than the W
elsh
model would forecast for their population. Poor
patient accessibility to beds has been documented as a
problem in a number of reports;1
6
10 therefore,
further work would be needed to determine whether
the organisation of these resources may be an under-
lying problem.
The provision of round-the-clock access to specialist
palliative care and pain control is inconsistent. While
some of the data we collected are encouraging, the
variation in services means that some areas are only
served by a basic out-of-hours service such as a tele-
phone line that does not involve consultant advice;
while others are supported by dedicated night-time
services and support networks. Further work would
be needed to fully understand areas which are strug-
gling due to staffing shortages.
The PHSO’s report has shown how essential it is
that educational training is provided to all staff
involved in care of the dying. Our data suggest that
the type of training provided to healthcare profes-
sionals on palliative care may be inconsistent, but it is
not clear whether this contributes to the variation in
service level.
Our data suggests that only half of those who
responded are committed to improving their services
in the future. There is currently no national initiative
in place to monitor how often services are reviewed,
or to support CCGs in developing their services and
sharing best practice.
The information obtained in this FOI exercise
reflects some of the key failures identified in the
PHSO’s report, and has also highlighted the need for
CCGs to hold standard data on the healthcare needs
and service provision across their population.
Limitations
The most important finding from this exercise is that
information is not standardised, is poorly defined and
therefore very difficult to interpret. Our data were
also collected via an open questionnaire, which meant
the responses were of varying length and detail, and
did not always provide the quantitative parameter
needed for analysis. In addition, the low response rate
on some of our questions resulted in a small sample
size. In particular, the low response rate to our ques-
tion on the palliative care needs population size, led
us to use 0.75% as a reliable benchmark figure
throughout our analysis. It is important to acknow-
ledge that the palliative care needs population will
vary across the country, and this figure will not truly
represent the needs of every CCG’s population.
CONCLUSIONS
This study goes some way to provide evidence that
while there is excellent specialist palliative care provi-
sion in parts of England, there is a vast degree of vari-
ation across the country and across different services.
Most strikingly, there is little uniformity in the data
CCGs are required to hold, and disparity in the
responsibility of service provision between CCGs,
Trusts and local hospices. As a result, a paucity of ser-
vices means that patient choice at the end of life
cannot always be honoured and unless national guide-
lines are put in place to support CCGs in commission-
ing care, the deficits described in the PHSO’s report
will not be addressed.
Palliative care needs to be available at all times
because crises often occur out of hours. In W
ales, spe-
cialist staffing levels have been determined within the
available funding, and a dedicated number of pallia-
tive care beds ensures fair access to specialist palliative
care across 7 days. This model provides a starting
point for CCGs to benchmark and improve provision
for their population.
Our data reveal that the devolution of decision-
making down to CCGs suggests that palliative care
provision is not being considered as a core service in
some parts of England. Despite much evidence of its
cost efficacy,20–22 the provision of specialist palliative
care is in need of a national framework to ensure that
patients achieve good end-of-life care everywhere.
