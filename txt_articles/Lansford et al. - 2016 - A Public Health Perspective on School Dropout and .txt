Abstract
Purpose—This study aimed to advance a public health perspective on links between education 
and health by examining risk and protective factors that might alter the relation between dropping 
out of high school and subsequent negative outcomes.
Methods—A community sample (N = 585) was followed from age 5 to 27. Data included self 
and parent reports, peer sociometric nominations, and observed mother-teen interactions.
Results—High school dropouts were up to four times more likely to experience individual 
negative outcomes (being arrested, fired, or on government assistance, using illicit substances, 
having poor health) by age 27 and twenty-four times more likely compared to graduates to 
experience as many as four or more negative outcomes. Links between dropout and negative 
outcomes were more pronounced for individuals who were in low SES families at age 5, rejected 
by elementary school peers, and became parents at a younger age; the dropout effect was 
decreased for individuals who had been treated for a behavioral, emotional, or drug problem by 
age 24.
Conclusions—Addressing school dropout as a public health problem has the potential to 
improve the lives of dropouts and reduce societal costs of dropping out.

 National estimates suggest that each high school dropout costs the United States economy at 
least $250,000 over the course of his or her lifetime because of greater reliance on welfare 
and Medicaid, more criminal activity, poorer health, and lower tax contributions [1]. On 
average, the annual median income of a high school dropout is $25,000, compared to 
$46,000 for an individual with a high school or equivalent degree [1]. A higher proportion of 
dropouts than high school graduates is unemployed and incarcerated [2,3], and dropouts 
have poorer health, even controlling for income and other sociodemographic disparities 
associated with dropping out [4].
School dropout has not typically been conceived as a public health issue, but the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and the American Public Health Association have advocated 
such a reframing because good health is predicted by good education, and health disparities 
are predicted by educational disparities [5,6]. Education is a strong predictor of health 
outcomes including mortality [7], likely in part because less education is highly correlated 
with health risk behaviors such as smoking, being overweight, and being sedentary and in 
part because more education leads to more income which can then purchase housing in safer 
neighborhoods, healthier food, better health care, and the like [8,9]. Estimates suggest that 
promoting education to reduce health disparities could save 8 times more lives than could be 
saved through medical advances in drugs and devices [10].
Despite the well-documented negative outcomes associated with dropping out of school, not 
all individuals who drop out experience this litany of negative life outcomes. The purpose of 
this study was to examine risk and protective factors that might alter the link between 
dropping out of high school and subsequent socially relevant outcomes in adulthood: 
receiving government assistance (e.g., food stamps), being fired, being arrested, using illicit 
drugs, and being in poor health. We selected these outcomes because each is substantially 
more likely for individuals who drop out of high school than for graduates [1–4]. With 
annual data on a community sample initially recruited before kindergarten and followed to 
age 27, we were able to test risk and protective factors assessed during childhood, 
adolescence, and young adulthood that might alter the link between dropping out and 
subsequent socially relevant outcomes.
METHOD
Participants
We recruited target participants when they entered kindergarten in 1987 or 1988 at three 
sites: Knoxville and Nashville, TN and Bloomington, IN [11]. We approached parents 
during kindergarten pre-registration and asked if they would participate in a longitudinal 
study of child development. Approximately 75% agreed. About 15% of children at the 
targeted schools did not pre-register. We recruited late enrolling families on the first day of 
school or by subsequent contact. The sample consisted of 585 families at the first assessment 
(52% male; 81% European American, 17% African American, 2% other ethnic groups). The 
sample reflected a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, ranging from 8 to 66 on the 
Hollingshead index, which was computed from parental education and occupation levels 
when the child was in kindergarten (M = 39.53, SD = 14.01) [12]. We assessed participants 
annually through age 27. Parents provided written informed consent each year for their own

 and their child's participation, until participants reached age 18, when they began providing 
their own written informed consent. Institutional review boards at the universities involved 
in this study approved the research protocols. The present sample included 529 individuals 
(90% of the original sample) who provided enough data (i.e., continued to participate in the 
study in the years after high school graduation would have been anticipated) to determine 
whether they had completed high school by the age of 24, the cut-off age used by the U.S. 
Department of Education in most federal reports of dropouts. Compared to the 56 original 
participants who did not provide enough data to determine whether they completed high 
school, the 529 participants with sufficient data had higher SES at age 5 and were more 
likely to be female, but did not differ on ethnicity. The sample size varies somewhat across 
variables; the smallest n (383) was for the observed mother-adolescent relationship quality 
variable at age 16, described below, as this required a lengthy observation session that not all 
participants completed.
Procedures and Measures
Dropout Status—We used target participants' annual reports of school enrollment and 
degrees obtained to determine which participants dropped out before completing high 
school. We defined dropouts as those individuals who had not reported completing high 
school by the age of 24. Given that participants began kindergarten in 1987 or 1988, 
anticipated graduation would have been in 2000 or 2001 (or a year or two later if students 
were retained in grade). Nationally, 13.5 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds in 2000 were not in 
high school and had not completed high school [13], very similar to the 14 percent of our 
sample that had dropped out by age 24 (n = 74).
Socially Relevant Outcomes during Adulthood—At age 27, target participants 
reported on five socially relevant domains that were summed to create an index of health and 
well-being (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics). First, receipt of government assistance was 
assessed by asking whether participants (a) live in a public housing project or are on the 
waiting list for public or subsidized housing, (b) are receiving help from the government in 
paying rent, (c) are receiving welfare such as TANF or WIC for themselves or their 
dependents, (d) are covered by Medicaid or another public assistance program that pays for 
health care, or (e) receive food stamps. If participants received any of those forms of 
government assistance, they were coded as 1; if not, they were coded as 0. Although 
individuals receiving these forms of government assistance may perceive them positively, 
they generally have been regarded as negative outcomes for society in the dropout literature 
[1]. Second, participants were asked how many times in their life they had been fired or laid 
off (never or once coded 0, two or more times coded 1). Third, participants were asked if 
they had been arrested since the age of 18 (0 = no, 1 = yes). Fourth, participants reported 
how often they had used illicit drugs for non-medical purposes in the last six months (0 = 
never, 1 = one or more times). Fifth, participants rated their physical health (0 = excellent, 
very good, or good, 1 = fair or poor). We created a composite variable reflecting the number 
of socially relevant negative outcomes each participant experienced by summing ratings on 
these 5 domains (range = 0 to 5).

 Risk and Protective Factors—Age 5 socioeconomic status (SES) was based on the 
Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Social Status [12]. During the age 5 interview, mothers 
responded to questions regarding the child's misbehavior, their own discipline practices, and 
whether the child had ever been physically harmed by an adult. Interviewers then rated 
privately the probability that the child had been severely harmed, using a criterion of 
intentional strikes to the child by an adult that left visible marks for more than 24 hours or 
that required medical attention. A score of 0 was assigned if maltreatment had definitely not 
or probably not occurred, and a score of 1 was assigned if maltreatment had probably 
occurred, definitely occurred, or if authorities had been involved. Agreement between 
independent raters for this classification was 90% (kappa = .56) [14].
In kindergarten through third grade (ages 5–8), sociometric interviews were conducted 
during the winter of each school year in classrooms in which at least 70% of children's 
parents gave consent [15]. Children were shown pictures of their classmates (in kindergarten 
and first grade) or a class roster (in second and third grades) and were asked to name up to 
three peers they especially liked and up to three peers they especially disliked. A social 
preference score was created by taking the standardized difference between the standardized 
like most nomination score and the standardized dislike most nomination score [15–17]. 
Children were classified as being rejected if their social preference score was less than 1, 
standardized like most score was less than 0, and standardized like least score was greater 
than 0. A cross-year composite was created to reflect whether children had been rejected by 
peers during any year in kindergarten through third grade.
When children were 12, their mothers completed nine items regarding awareness of their 
child's activities, whereabouts, and friends [18]. Items were rated on 5-point scales and 
averaged to reflect maternal monitoring (α = .69). At age 16, mother-adolescent relationship 
quality was observationally assessed in a 45-minute interaction focused on communication 
about rules, roles, responsibilities, and conflict resolution. Coders rated individual and 
dyadic behavior on a set of 9-point rating scales [19]. A superordinate 9-point rating 
summarized overall observed relationship quality. A high score indicated the relationship 
was warm, open, and emotionally satisfying. Interrater agreement was computed for 20% of 
the total cases (average intraclass r = .70; p < .001). Also at age 16, adolescents rated how 
often their friends engaged in 10 antisocial behaviors [20]. Each behavior was rated on a 5-
point scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = very often, and values were averaged to create a 
scale (α = .74).
At age 22, target participants reported how often they are involved in activities at church (0 
= never, 6 = 5 or more times a week). They also reported their frequency of civic 
engagement [21] in seven areas (e.g., volunteered in a public service, neighborhood, or 
political association; donated money, food, or clothes to charity) in the last year (1 = never, 5 
= many times). The seven items were averaged to create a civic engagement scale (α = .76). 
In addition, target participants rated four items regarding their connection to a peer group 
(e.g., “I feel happiest when I am with members of this group”) [22], on a 5-point scale (1 = 
strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The four items were averaged for the adult peer group 
affiliation scale (α = .77). Also, at age 22, target participants rated the quality of their

 relationships with their mother and father, each on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 = really 
bad to 10 = perfect [23].
At age 24, target participants were asked whether they had ever been treated for behavioral, 
emotional, or drug problems (0 = no, 1 = yes) [24]. Annually from age 18 to 25, target 
participants were asked “Do you currently have a romantic partner?” We constructed an 
index of romantic involvement as the number of waves the participant reported being in a 
romantic relationship across these eight years [25]. Annually from age 15 to 27, target 
participants were asked whether they had any children; we constructed an index of the age at 
which the participant first became a parent. Participants who had not yet become a parent by 
the age of 27 (59% of the sample) were assigned a value of 28 for the age at first parenthood 
variable.
Analysis Plan
We conducted three sets of analyses. First, we present descriptive statistics for individuals 
who dropped out of high school compared to high school graduates on the frequency of each 
of the five individual outcome variables and then the composite that includes all five. 
Second, we conducted 2 (dropout or not) × 2 (categorical risk factor or not) ANOVAS 
predicting the continuous composite outcome. Third, for continuous risk factors, we 
conducted regressions that included the main effect of dropping out, the main effect of the 
risk factor, and the interaction between dropping out and the risk factor as predictors of the 
continuous composite outcome. The interaction terms in the ANOVAs and regressions tested 
whether each risk or protective factor altered the link between dropping out and the socially 
relevant outcomes.
RESULTS
Individuals who dropped out of high school were nearly four times more likely to be 
receiving government assistance, were twice as likely to have been fired two or more times, 
were more than three times more likely to have been arrested since the age of 18, were twice 
as likely to have used illicit drugs in the last six months, and were more than twice as likely 
to report poor health (see Table 1). We then examined a composite indicator by summing the 
number of negative outcomes experienced and found a large effect of dropping out, F(1, 
451) = 85.13, p < .001, with individuals who had dropped out of high school nearly 5 times 
more likely than high school graduates to have one or more negative outcomes and 24 times 
more likely to have as many as four or more negative outcomes.
Despite the significant risk posed by dropping out of school, not all dropouts experienced 
the same level of negative outcome, so we turned to the question of which factors from 
childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood might alter the link between dropping out and 
subsequent outcomes. For categorical risk and protective factors, we conducted 2-way 
analyses of variance (ANOVAs) that included the main effect of dropping out, the main 
effect of the risk or protective factor, and the interaction between the two. For continuous 
risk and protective factors, we first centered the risk and protective factors and then 
conducted regression analyses with comparable main effects and the interaction. Links 
between dropout status and negative outcomes were altered by four of the risk and protective

 factors we tested (see Figure 1; main effects are reported in Tables 2 and 3). First, 
individuals from lower SES families had more negative outcomes at age 27 than individuals 
from higher SES families; furthermore, the risk of dropping out in relation to more negative 
outcomes at age 27 was more pronounced for individuals whose family SES in kindergarten 
was lower than for individuals whose family SES in kindergarten was higher, t = −2.10, p = .
036. Second, individuals who were rejected by peers during elementary school were at 
higher risk for negative outcomes at age 27, and the effect of peer rejection was more 
pronounced for individuals who dropped out compared to those who graduated, F(1, 446) = 
9.26, p = .002. Third, whether the individual had ever been treated for emotional, behavioral, 
or drug problems altered the link between dropping out and experiencing later negative 
outcomes such that individuals who graduated were at higher risk of later negative outcomes 
if they had been treated, whereas individuals who dropped out were at higher risk of later 
negative outcomes if they had not been treated, F(1, 387) = 7.35, p = .007, suggesting that 
despite the risk posed by emotional, behavioral, and drug problems in predicting school 
dropout in the first place, treatment for those problems had the potential to ameliorate 
subsequent risk for negative outcomes into adulthood for dropouts. Fourth, the risk of 
dropping out in relation to more negative outcomes at age 27 was more pronounced for 
individuals who became a parent at a younger age than for those who became a parent at an 
older age or who had not yet become a parent by the end of the study period, t = −1.99, p = .
048.
We tested a number of other possible risk and protective factors that might alter the link 
between dropping out and negative outcomes, as above using 2-way ANOVAs to test 
categorical factors (Table 2) and regression analyses to test continuous factors (Table 3). 
Civic engagement and self-reported mother-child relationship quality during early adulthood 
were not significant risk or protective factors for dropouts or graduates. The other factors we 
investigated did not alter the relation between dropping out and subsequent outcomes but 
instead were equally protective or risky for dropouts and graduates alike, as these risk and 
protective factors did not show a significant interaction with dropout status, suggesting that 
these risk and protective factors were related to outcomes in the same way for dropouts and 
graduates. Being male, being African American, being physically abused in the first five 
years of life, and affiliating with antisocial peers during adolescence predicted more negative 
outcomes at age 27 equally for dropouts and graduates. Being in a romantic relationship for 
more years, maternal monitoring during early adolescence, observed quality of the mother-
child relationship during adolescence, self-reported father-child relationship quality during 
early adulthood, frequency of involvement in church activities, and strongly affiliating with a 
peer group in early adulthood were equally protective for dropouts and graduates.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with previous research, individuals in our sample who dropped out of high school 
were at elevated risk of problems in multiple domains during adulthood. The main effects of 
dropping out on negative outcomes at age 27 were striking: Individuals who dropped out of 
high school were 24 times more likely than graduates to have experienced four or more 
negative outcomes. Nevertheless, regardless of dropout status, individuals with better 
relationships with their parents during adolescence and early adulthood, less affiliation with

 deviant peers during adolescence, more time in a romantic relationship in late adolescence 
and early adulthood, and more involvement with a peer group and church activities during 
early adulthood had better outcomes.
Furthermore, although one of the risk factors that exacerbates the negative outcomes 
associated with dropping out (i.e., age 5 SES) is not directly amenable to change (although 
some large scale interventions have attempted to move families out of poverty [26]), three of 
the risk factors (i.e., peer rejection during elementary school; treatment for behavioral, 
emotional, and drug problems; and becoming a parent at a young age) might be. First, 
several promising and model interventions to improve peer relationships during elementary 
school have been identified in the Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development 
(www.blueprintsprograms.com) [27]. Second, behavioral, emotional, and drug problems 
increase the probability of school dropout [28]. Treatments for these problems may not only 
reduce school dropout but, for those who dropout anyway, offer the potential to reduce the 
subsequent negative outcomes associated with dropping out. For graduates, our findings 
likely imply that individuals experiencing more negative outcomes in early adulthood are 
more likely to seek treatment rather than that treatment causes more negative outcomes. 
Third, only 40% of teen mothers complete high school, and one-third of girls who drop out 
indicate that pregnancy or early parenthood was a key factor [29]. This is a particularly toxic 
problem when parenthood also compounds the negative outcomes associated with dropping 
out. Approaches that help teens delay sexual debut or use effective contraception could not 
only reduce teen pregnancy but also prevent school dropout that often follows for pregnant 
girls.
Notable strengths of this study include the prospective longitudinal design following a 
community sample from the age of 5 to 27 with data available from multiple sources 
including parents, peers, direct observations, and self-reports. The study also had limitations. 
First, we do not claim to have studied all of the potential risk and protective factors that 
could have altered the link between dropping out and subsequent negative outcomes. 
Emotional abuse and neurocognitive functioning are examples of other potential risk factors 
that could be examined in future research. Second, although we had data only through age 
27, development does not stop there. Life pathways tend to stabilize fairly early in 
adulthood, but individuals continue to change over time in response to new opportunities and 
constraints that may serve as turning points toward better or worse future adjustment [30]. 
Third, we examined effects of risk and protective factors on the link between dropout status 
and a composite indicator that encompassed five socially relevant outcomes, but some risk 
and protective factors may be more tied to specific individual outcomes than to others. 
Finally, we adopted a variable-centered rather than person-centered approach. Originally, we 
sought to identify a group of dropouts that was exhibiting success in a number of domains to 
understand what promotes success in this at-risk group, but this proved sadly difficult to do, 
as the large majority were experiencing negative outcomes in multiple domains. Future 
research with large national samples may be able to identify a large enough subgroup of 
successful dropouts to delve more into predictors of positive outcomes for this group.
Researchers, policymakers, and advocates have argued that school dropout should be 
reframed as a public health problem because education is a strong predictor of long-term

 health and health-services utilization. In comparison to college graduates, the average 
American high school dropout's life expectancy at birth is 14.2 years less for men and 10.3 
years less for women [31]. During their lives, dropouts are more likely than graduates to 
experience both chronic and acute health problems [9]. The American Public Health 
Association estimates that eliminating dropout could save more than $17 billion annually in 
Medicaid and other health care expenditures, as well as additional billions in welfare, 
criminal justice, and increased tax revenues [5]. Although entirely eliminating dropout may 
not be possible, it is surely a worthy goal, regardless of whether dropout is the cause of later 
problems or a mediating marker in a risky developmental trajectory that begins long before 
dropout occurs. Understanding school dropout in the context of other risk and protective 
factors provides a starting point for disrupting continuity between school dropout and later 
negative outcomes.

 IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION
Individuals who dropped out of high school were 24 times more likely than graduates to 
have experienced four or more negative outcomes (e.g., being incarcerated, fired) by age 
27, but several risk and protective factors (e.g., treatment for behavioral, emotional, or 
drug problems) altered the risks associated with dropping out.

 Figure 1. 
Significant interactions between dropout status and four risk factors (household SES in 
kindergarten; rejection by elementary school peers; treatment for behavioral, emotional, or 
drug problems by age 24; age at first parenthood) in the prediction of age 27 negative 
outcomes. For the continuous SES and age at first parenthood variables, the plotted lines 
depict slopes at one standard deviation above and below the mean. Each risk factor was 
related to the number of negative outcomes experienced by dropouts but not by graduates. 
The high age of first parenthood group included individuals who had not yet become parents 
by the age of 27.
