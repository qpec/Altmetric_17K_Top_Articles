Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with metabolic risk factors including hypertension and dyslipidemia and may progress
to liver fibrosis. Studies have shown that hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are heritable, but whether they have a significant shared gene
effect is unknown. This study examined the shared gene effects between hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and their associations with
metabolic risk factors. This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort of well-characterized, community-dwelling twins
(45 monozygotic, 20 dizygotic twin pairs, 130 total subjects) from southern California. Hepatic steatosis was assessed with mag-
netic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction and hepatic fibrosis with magnetic resonance elastography. A standard bivari-
ate twin additive genetics and unique environment effects model was used to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance
between two phenotypes accounted for by additive genetic effects and individual-specific environmental effects. Genetic correla-
tions estimated from this model represent the degree to which the genetic determinants of two phenotypes overlap. Mean (6 stan-
dard deviation) age and body mass index were 47.1 (621.9) years and 26.2 (65.8) kg/m2, respectively. Among the cohort, 20%
(26/130) had hepatic steatosis (magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction �5%), and 8.2% (10/122) had hepatic
fibrosis (magnetic resonance elastography �3 kPa). Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), triglycerides, glucose, homeostatic
model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin, hemoglobin A1c, and low high-density lipoprotein had significant shared gene
effects with hepatic steatosis. Triglycerides, glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin, hemoglobin A1c,
and low high-density lipoprotein had significant shared gene effects with hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis had a high-
ly significant shared gene effect of 0.756 (95% confidence interval 0.716-1, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Genes involved with steatosis
pathogenesis may also be involved with fibrosis pathogenesis. (HEPATOLOGY 2016;64:1547-1558)

N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
comprised of a spectrum of liver pathologies
characterized by hepatic steatosis in patients
with little to no history of alcohol use or secondary
causes of hepatic steatosis.(1) Nonalcoholic steatohepa-
titis (NASH) is an advanced form of NAFLD and
predisposes patients to the development of hepatic
fibrosis, which is associated with increased risks of cir-
rhosis,
mortality,
and
liver
transplantation.(2-5)

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 NAFLD, including its complications, is now a leading
cause of liver disease in the United States and world-
wide.(6-8) Due to the heavy disease burden of NAFLD
and its associated morbidity and mortality, there is a
great need to characterize the heritability of NAFLD
to identify patients who may be at risk for the disease,
improve the understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis,
and identify potential targets for treatment.
Hepatic steatosis represents the initial step for the
pathogenesis of NASH and hepatic fibrosis, and we
have previously demonstrated in twin models that both
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are heritable traits.(9) Var-
ious genes, including PNPLA-3 and TM6SF2, are
associated with the development of hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis, although variations in these genes do not
account for all the variance seen in hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis, and additional genes remain to be identi-
fied.(10-15) But while hepatic steatosis can progress to
hepatic fibrosis, it is unknown if there are direct genet-
ic links between these two traits. Hepatic fibrosis has
been shown to be the most important predictor of
mortality
and
liver
transplantation
in
NAFLD
patients,(5,16) and an improved understanding of the
shared heritability between hepatic steatosis and fibro-
sis may elucidate potential targets for NAFLD preven-
tion and treatment. If steatosis and fibrosis gene
regulation significantly overlap, then it is plausible that
improvement in steatosis by a shared mechanistic
pathway may eventually trigger improvement in fibro-
sis in the context of targeting specific nodal points in
the mechanistic pathway. Additionally, studies have
shown NAFLD to be associated with metabolic risk
factors including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
and insulin resistance(17-20), and there is a genetic
component to this association.(21) However, further
studies
are
needed
to
characterize
the
genetic
association between hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and
individual metabolic risk factors.
Using a prospective study design of community-
dwelling monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we evaluat-
ed if study participants with genetic susceptibilities to
hepatic steatosis also have genetic susceptibilities to
hepatic fibrosis. We also evaluated the genetic suscep-
tibilities of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with metabolic
risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels,
triglycerides, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Mathe-
matical models involving additive genetics and unique
environmental effects (called AE models) were con-
structed for the cohort to distinguish between the
shared genetic and environmental determination of
individual traits. Magnetic resonance imaging-proton
density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic reso-
nance elastography (MRE), two novel, accurate, and
noninvasive imaging biomarkers, were respectively
used to assess for hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in this
prospective study.
Participants and Methods
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospectively
recruited cohort of monozygotic and dizygotic twin
pairs living in southern California. All twin pairs

 imaging visits were performed on the same day for
each twin pair, and the study took place from 2012 to
2015. All participants provided written informed con-
sent before enrolling in the study. The study protocol
was approved by the UCSD institutional review board.
INCLUSION CRITERIA
Participants were included in the study if they were
twins at least 18 years old who provided written
informed consent. The zygosity of the majority of twin
pairs as monozygotic or dizygotic had been confirmed
through genetic testing before the participants enrolled
in the study. A previously published questionnaire, as
described by Boyd et al.,(24) was used to further con-
firm twinship status (see Supporting Information for
details).
EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Participants were excluded from the study if they
met any of the following criteria: (1) significant alcohol
intake (>10 g/day in females or >20 g/day in males)
for at least 3 consecutive months over the previous 12
months or if the quantity of alcohol consumed could
not be reliably ascertained; (2) clinical or biochemical
evidence of liver diseases other than NAFLD, includ-
ing hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alpha-1-antitrypsin defi-
ciency,
hemochromatosis,
Wilson’s
disease,
autoimmune hepatitis, polycystic liver diseases, chole-
static liver diseases, and vascular liver diseases; (3)
chronic illnesses associated with hepatic steatosis,
including human immunodeficiency virus infection,
type I diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis,
lipodystrophy, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and glycogen
storage diseases; (4) use of drugs known to cause
hepatic steatosis, including amiodarone, glucocorti-
coids, methotrexate, L-asparaginase, and valproic acid
for at least 3 out of the previous 6 months; (5) history
of bariatric surgery, including roux-en-Y gastric bypass
and gastroplasty; (6) presence of systemic infectious ill-
nesses; (7) females who were pregnant or nursing at
the time of the study; (8) contraindications to MRI,
including metal implants, claustrophobia, and body
circumference greater than that of the imaging cham-
ber; (9) any other condition(s) which, based on the
principal investigator’s opinion, may significantly affect
the participant’s compliance, competence, or ability to
complete the study.
DEFINITION OF NAFLD
Participants were considered to have NAFLD if
they had hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF �5%) and no
secondary causes of hepatic steatosis due to factors
including the use of steatogenic medications, other liv-
er diseases, and significant alcohol intake (see Exclu-
sion Criteria above for details).
CLINICAL RESEARCH
ASSESSMENT
All participants underwent clinical research assess-
ments at the UCSD NAFLD Research Center (see
Supporting Information for details).
GENOTYPING
DNA samples were extracted from whole blood
samples collected during the clinical research visit.
Genotyping was performed by Human Longevity Inc.
(San Diego, CA).
PRIMARY OUTCOME
The primary outcome was the presence of shared
gene effect between hepatic steatosis and hepatic
fibrosis.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES
The secondary outcomes were the shared gene of
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with the following meta-
bolic risk factors: systolic blood pressure (SBP), dia-
stolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), triglycerides, ferritin, glucose, homeostatic
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
insulin, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
MRI
MRI was performed at the UCSD MR3T Research
Laboratory using the 3T research scanner (GE Signa
EXCITE HDxt; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI)
with all participants in the supine position, on the
same day as the clinical research visit, to reduce poten-
tial confounding factors. MRI-PDFF was used to
measure hepatic steatosis, and MRE was used to mea-
sure hepatic fibrosis. MRI-PDFF has been shown to
be a highly precise, accurate, and reproducible nonin-
vasive biomarker to quantify hepatic fat content,(25,26)

 correlates well with magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(r2 5 0.99, P < 0.001),(22,23) and is superior to nonin-
vasive imaging techniques such as ultrasound and com-
puted
tomography
for
measuring
hepatic
fat
content,(27) even in iron-overloaded livers that may
coexist with NAFLD livers.(28) MRI-PDFF has also
been shown to correlate well with histology from con-
temporaneous liver biopsies.(29,30) MRE has been
shown to be a highly accurate, noninvasive biomarker
to estimate hepatic fibrosis quantified by liver stiffness
values in units of kilopascals(31) and has been shown to
be more accurate than clinical prediction rules(32) and
ultrasound-based
acoustic
radiation
force
impulse
imaging(33) for quantifying hepatic fibrosis. Please see
Supporting Information for a description of the mag-
netic resonance procedures.
JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT USING
LIVER BIOPSY TO ASSESS FOR
HEPATIC STEATOSIS AND
FIBROSIS
Due to the invasive nature of liver biopsies, it would
be unethical to perform liver biopsies in study partici-
pants with no clinical indications for liver biopsies.(1)
Therefore, we used noninvasive imaging techniques to
quantify hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. MRI-PDFF has
been shown to be accurate for estimating hepatic stea-
tosis and more precise than liver biopsies.(25) MRE has
also been shown to be accurate for estimating hepatic
fibrosis.(31-33)
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Patients’ demographic, anthropometric, clinical, and
biochemical characteristics were summarized. Categor-
ical variables were shown as counts and percentages,
and associations were tested using a chi-squared test or
Fisher’s exact test. Normally distributed continuous
variables were shown as mean (6 standard deviation),
and differences between groups were analyzed using a
two-independent samples t test or Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test. Odds ratios were derived from general-
ized estimating equations (PROC GENMOD) to
account for intrapair correlations within twinships. A
two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
AE models were used to estimate the shared genetic
determination (rG) and shared environmental determi-
nation (rE) between twin pairs. In the classical twin
study of sets of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, four
latent factors can account for the variance of any phe-
notype: additive genetic effects (A); nonadditive genet-
ic effects, including dominance (D); common or
shared environmental effects (C); and nonshared or
individual-specific
environmental
effects
(E).(34)
Because monozygotic twins are presumed to be geneti-
cally identical, they correlate perfectly (r 5 1.0) with
respect to both additive and nonadditive genetic
effects. Dizygotic twins share, on average, 50% of their
genes, resulting in correlations of 0.50 for additive
genetic effects and 0.25 for nonadditive genetic effects.
The C term is defined as environmental factors that
make twins similar; hence, common environmental
factors correlate 1.0 across twin pairs, regardless of
zygosity. The E term represents environmental factors
that lead to differences between twins. Because these
are individual-specific factors, they are assumed to be
uncorrelated across twins. Error is assumed to be ran-
dom across individuals, so measurement error forms
part of the estimate of E in these analyses. These latent
factors comprise what are referred to as the univariate
ACE or ADE models; due to model underidentifica-
tion, an ACDE model cannot be tested in the classical
twin design.(34)
The ACE and ADE models are easily extended to
the multivariate case.(34) In addition to genetic and
environmental sources of variance, sources of covari-
ance can be examined in the bivariate model. In the
present study, we used bivariate models to compute
genetic correlations between two phenotypes. A phe-
notypic correlation measures shared variance; a genetic
correlation measures shared genetic variance. More
specifically, a phenotypic correlation is defined as the
total covariance (genetic plus environmental) of two
variables divided by the square root of the product of
the total variance of variable 1 and the total variance of
variable 2. After decomposing the sources of variance
in the bivariate model, we computed genetic correla-
tions. These are defined as the genetic covariance divid-
ed by the square root of the product of the genetic
variance of variable 1 and the genetic variance of vari-
able 2. The analyses were performed using OpenMx, a
structural equation modeling software package for
genetically informative data (http://openmx.psyc.vir-
ginia.edu). Prior to the model fitting, the measures
were adjusted for controlling age, gender, and ethnici-
ty. Overall, AE models tended to provide the best fits
to the data. Consequently, the genetic effects estimated
in these AE models refer to broad-sense heritability,
reflecting
the
proportion
of
phenotypic
variance

 accounted for by the combined effect of all genetic
influences (A1D).
SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION
In previous studies, the heritability of hepatic steato-
sis ranged from 0.37, when hepatic steatosis was
assessed using ultrasound and serum alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) levels,(35) to almost 1.0, when
hepatic steatosis was assessed using MRI in obese His-
panic probands and their relatives.(36) We have also
previously estimated the heritability of hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis to be approximately 0.5.(9) Based on these
numbers, we anticipated that the heritability of hepatic
steatosis and fibrosis with one another should also be
approximately 0.5. It has been shown that, to detect an
additive genetic component of 0.4-0.8 in an ACE
model, approximately 36-74 twin pairs are needed to
produce a power of 0.95 with an alpha value of
0.05.(37) Therefore, the 65 twin pairs in this study
should provide an adequate sample size to assess the
heritability of steatosis and fibrosis in our population.
Results
BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
Included in the study were 130 participants (45
monozygotic twin pairs, 20 dizygotic twin pairs) who
underwent clinical research assessments and imaging
with MRI-PDFF and MRE. Initially, 438 participants
were assessed for eligibility, 152 provided informed
consent, and 130 were included in the final analysis
(see Supporting Fig. S1 for details). The mean (6
standard deviation) age was 47.1 (621.9) years, and
the mean (6 standard deviation) body mass index
(BMI) was 26.2 (65.8) kg/m2. Among the cohort, 26/
130 (20%) had hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF �5%)
and 10/122 (8.2%) had hepatic fibrosis (MRE �3
kPa). Compared to twins without NAFLD, twins
with NAFLD were significantly older (54.9 6 17.3
years versus 45.2 6 22.5 years, P 5 0.04) and had a
higher BMI (31.5 6 4.8 kg/m2 versus 24.8 6 5.1 kg/
m2, P < 0.0001). As expected, twins with NAFLD
also had significantly higher measurements of hepatic
steatosis by MRI-PDFF (10.7 6 5.1 versus 2.4 6 0.9,
P < 0.0001) and hepatic fibrosis by MRE (3.0 6 1.2
versus 2.2 6 0.4, P < 0.0001). Detailed demographic,
biochemical, and imaging data of the cohort, stratified
by the presence or absence of NAFLD, are summa-
rized in Table 1.

between hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and metabolic risk
factors are summarized below.

gene effects between hepatic steatosis and total cholester-
ol, LDL cholesterol, and ferritin (Table 2). Significant
shared gene effects between hepatic steatosis and meta-
bolic risk factors are shown in Fig. 1A.
Shared Gene Effects Between Hepatic
Fibrosis and Metabolic Risk Factors
There were significant shared gene effects between
hepatic fibrosis, as measured by MRE, and BMI at 0.493
(95% CI 0.493-0.845), P 5 0.00649; HDL cholesterol
at -0.614 (95% CI -0.890 to -0.614), P 5 5.74e-4; trigly-
cerides at 0.657 (95% CI 0.657-1), P 5 3.44e-4; glucose
at 0.746 (95% CI 0.746-1), P 5 0.0029; HOMA-IR at
0.610 (95% CI 0.218-1), P 5 0.0025; insulin at 0.429
(95% CI 0.167-0.735), P 5 0.023; and HbA1c at 0.566
(95% CI 0.566-1), P 5 0.015. There were no significant
shared gene effects between hepatic fibrosis and SBP,
DBP, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and ferritin
(Table 2). Significant shared gene effects between hepatic
fibrosis and metabolic risk factors are shown in Fig. 1B.
Shared Gene Effect Between Hepatic
Steatosis and Fibrosis
There was a significant shared gene effect between
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis at 0.756 (95% CI 0.716-
1), P 5 2.54e-5 (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Figure 3 depicts
MRI-PDFF images and MRE elastograms of a repre-
sentative pair of 60-year-old male twins with both
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis traits.

 SHARED ENVIRONMENTAL
EFFECT
Using AE models, the shared environmental effects
(rE) between hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and metabolic
risk factors are summarized below.
Shared Environmental Effect Between
Hepatic Steatosis and Metabolic Risk
Factors
There was a significant shared environmental effect
between hepatic steatosis, as measured by MRI-
PDFF, and ferritin at 0.307 (95% CI 0.019-0.544), P
5 0.037. There were no other significant shared envi-
ronmental effects between hepatic steatosis and other
metabolic risk factors (Table 3).
Shared Environmental Effect Between
Hepatic Fibrosis and Metabolic Risk
Factors
There were no significant shared environmental
effects between hepatic fibrosis, as measured by MRE,
and metabolic risk factors (Table 3).

Discussion
MAIN FINDINGS
In this study, we used a well-characterized, prospec-
tive, community-dwelling twin cohort design to dem-
onstrate that hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis have
statistically
and
clinically
significant
shared
gene
effects. This builds on our previous findings that
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are each individually heri-
table traits.(9) We also demonstrated significant shared
genetic effects between hepatic steatosis and fibrosis
and a wide number of metabolic risk factors, including
HDL, triglycerides, insulin resistance, and HbA1c.
These results suggest a genetic basis underlying the
pathogenesis of both hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and
with metabolic risk factors. This is a paradigm-
changing finding as most experts believe that hepatic
steatosis is inconsequential and only hepatic fibrosis is
associated with worse outcomes, including mortality
and liver transplantation.(5) The shared gene effects
between hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis suggest
that development of hepatic steatosis may itself por-
tend a worse outcome. However, the time horizon for
hepatic steatosis to reach these adverse outcomes may
be long, and studies with 10-20 years of follow-up may
be needed to assess these outcomes. It also has implica-
tions in developing targeted therapies for the treatment
of NASH. It provides a biological plausibility that
reduction of hepatic steatosis over a sustained period of
time may also influence the expression of genes associ-
ated with fibrosis progression/regression and may be
viable target for the treatment of NASH.
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
PUBLISHED LITERATURE
Studies have shown that both hepatic steato-
sis(9,35,36) and fibrosis(9) are heritable traits. We build
on the results of these studies to show additional herit-
abilities
between
hepatic
steatosis
and
fibrosis.

 Additionally, NAFLD has been associated with meta-
bolic risk factors,(17-20) although the relative contribu-
tions of genetic versus environmental factors to these
associations are unknown from these studies. While
we have previously demonstrated genetic covariance

 fat content was not measured directly.(21) Additionally,
no previous studies have demonstrated genetic covari-
ance between hepatic fibrosis and metabolic risk fac-
tors. This is the first study to demonstrate genetic
covariance between metabolic risk factors and both
hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in a community-dwelling
cohort of twins, with accurate quantification of steato-
sis and fibrosis throughout the liver achieved through
the use of noninvasive MRI-based imaging techniques.
There are currently few effective medical therapies
to manage NAFLD and its complications. Vitamin E
and thiazolidinediones have been shown to improve
hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients.(38-40) However,
few treatments have been shown to be effective in
reversing NAFLD-associated hepatic fibrosis. The
genes PNPLA3(10,41) and TM6SF2(42,43) have been
shown to modify the risks of hepatic steatosis and
fibrosis, and other genetic pathways associated with
steatosis, fibrosis, and metabolic traits remain to be
elucidated. Future identification of these genetic path-
ways may lead to individualized, targeted therapies
that may prevent and/or reverse hepatic steatosis and
fibrosis.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
The strength of this study lies in its use of a twin
study design that allows for the evaluation of the heri-
tability of steatosis, fibrosis, and metabolic risk factors.

 community-dwelling twins in which twins with condi-
tions such as excessive alcohol use, use of steatogenic
medications, viral hepatitis, and secondary causes of
steatosis were systemically excluded. The use of MRI-
PDFF allowed for detailed mapping and steatosis
quantification throughout the liver, and the use of
MRE allowed for an accurate, noninvasive way to
quantify hepatic fibrosis.
However, this study is limited by the lack of biopsy,
which remains the gold standard for diagnosing liver
steatosis and fibrosis. While biopsies are limited by
their interobserver variability and sampling bias, they
allow for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation, hepa-
tocyte ballooning, and NASH that cannot be diag-
nosed noninvasively. However, because it is unethical
to perform liver biopsies in normal control patients
with no suspicion of NAFLD, a study involving liver
biopsies can only be performed if at least one twin has
suspected NAFLD. Our use of noninvasive bio-
markers instead of liver biopsy to assess hepatic steato-
sis and fibrosis allowed us to use a community-
dwelling cohort of patients, rather than preselected
patients with increased risk of NAFLD. Although
MRI-PDFF has been shown to have high interreader
reproducibility in nontwin studies(44) and the interob-
server variability of magnetic resonance readings in our
study was minimized with only one analyst performing
all the image analyses, the general interobserver vari-
ability of magnetic resonance readings in similar twin
study designs remains unknown. Additionally, MRI-
PDFF has been shown to be highly accurate for map-
ping hepatic steatosis throughout the liver without the
sampling variability associated with liver biopsies, and
MRE has also been shown to be highly accurate for
the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis, so we believe our non-
invasive diagnostic tests can reliably measure steatosis
and fibrosis.(31-33)
IMPLICATION FOR FUTURE
STUDY
In this study, we demonstrate in a prospective,
community-dwelling cohort of twins that patients with
genetic susceptibility to hepatic steatosis also have
genetic susceptibility to hepatic fibrosis. We also dem-
onstrate that hepatic steatosis and fibrosis have shared
genetic effects with metabolic risk factors. Additional
studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to iden-
tify individual genes or pathways that may be implicat-
ed in hepatic steatogenesis and/or fibrogenesis. The
identification of these genes may allow for further
individualized, targeted therapy that may prevent and
even reverse hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.
