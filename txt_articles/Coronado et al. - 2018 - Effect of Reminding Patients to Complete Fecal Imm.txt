BACKGROUND: The Community Preventive Services
Task Force recommends multi-component interventions,
including patient reminders, to improve uptake of colo-
rectal cancer screening.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effectiveness of
different forms of reminders for a direct-mail fecal immu-
nochemical test (FIT) program.
DESIGN: Patient-randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 2772 adults aged 50–75, not up to date
with colorectal cancer screening recommendations, with
a clinic visit in the previous year at any of four participat-
ing health center clinics.
INTERVENTION: Participants were mailed an introduc-
tory letter and FIT. Those who did not complete their FIT
within 3 weeks were randomized to receive (1) a reminder
letter, (2) two automated phone calls, (3) two text mes-
sages, (4) a live phone call, (5) a reminder letter and a live
phone call, (6) two automated phone calls and a live phone
call, or (7) two text messages and a live phone call. Pa-
tients with a patient portal account were sent two email
reminders, but were not randomized.
MAIN MEASURES: FIT return rates for each group,
6 months following randomization.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 255 (10%) participants
returned their FIT within 3 weeks of the mailing. Among
randomized participants (n = 2010), an additional 25.5%
returned their FITs after reminders were delivered (esti-
mated overall return rate = 32.7%). In intention-to-treat
analysis, compared to the group allocated to receive a
reminder letter, return rates were higher for the group
assigned to receive the live phone call (OR = 1.51 [1.03–
2.21]) and lower for the group assigned to receive text
messages (OR = 0.66 [0.43–0.99]). Reminder effectiveness
differed by language preference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that FIT reminders
that included a live call were more effective than re-
minders that relied solely on written communication (a
text message or letter).

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States.1 In 2017, an estimated 135,000
individuals will be diagnosed with CRC, and 50,000 will die
from the disease.1 While screening for CRC has been shown
unequivocally to reduce incidence and mortality,2 adherence
to screening remains low. In 2015, only 63% of adults aged 50
and older reported being up to date with CRC screening
recommendations.1 Screening rates are particularly low
among Hispanics (50%), uninsured individuals (25%), and
immigrants who have been in the United States for fewer than
10 years (34%). In community health centers providing care to
underserved patients, an average of only 38% of eligible adults
were found to be up to date in 2015.3 Direct-mail fecal testing
programs have been shown to improve CRC screening rates in
multiple health care settings, including community health
centers,2, 4–9 with improvements ranging from a 22% to 45%
absolute increase.2, 4–9 Most of these programs delivered
follow-up reminders to adults who were mailed fecal test kits,
with the reminders generally delivered through a letter or
telephone call (either automated or live) or, more recently,
through text messages and occasionally patient navigation
(staff trained to provide assistance with overcoming screening
barriers).2, 4, 8–11
Despite the widespread use of follow-up reminders for
direct-mail fecal testing programs, few studies have evaluated
the impact that reminders have on fecal test return rates. To
address this important gap in the literature, we compare the
effectiveness of reminders for a direct-mail fecal testing pro-
gram. We partnered with Sea Mar Community Health Centers,
the largest community health center in the state of Washington,
to answer the question: How well do individual and multiple
reminders work for patients who are mailed a fecal immuno-
chemical test (FIT)? A secondary question was: Can we infer a
difference in the effectiveness based on patients’ preferred
language (English or Spanish)? We also report on the

 percentage of eligible patients who received the reminders
(reach). The results of this study will inform future efforts to
optimize the return rate for direct-mail fecal testing programs.
METHODS
Study Setting
We partnered with Sea Mar Community Health Centers to
compare the effectiveness of multiple strategies to remind
patients who were mailed a FIT to mail it back. Sea Mar is a
health center in western Washington that serves more than
130,000 patients in 32 medical clinics. We selected four Sea
Mar primary care clinics for our pilot. In 2015, Sea Mar served
more than 29,000 patients aged 50 to 75. Sea Mar’s CRC
overall screening rate in 2015 was 40%.
Reminders for a Direct-Mail Program
This pilot study compared the effectiveness of four single-
mode reminders (a reminder letter, automated phone calls, live
phone calls, and text messages) and three multi-modal re-
minders (a reminder letter and live call, automated and live
calls, and text messages and live call). Our pilot also included
a separate parallel non-randomized arm to determine the fea-
sibility of delivering reminders using an electronic patient
portal (Fig. 1). Patients with active patient portal accounts
were not randomized and were sent reminder messages
through the portal. All procedures and intervention materials
were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board
of Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and the study was reviewed
and approved by Sea Mar’s research committee. Informed
consent was waived.

 We mailed the introductory letter and FIT kit packets to all
eligible adults using templates developed for the Strategies and
Opportunities to Stop Colorectal Cancer (STOP CRC) pro-
gram.12 The introductory letter explained the importance of
CRC screening and informed recipients they would be mailed
a FIT. The letters were developed in English and translated into
Spanish and Russian. FIT kit packets contained a FIT kit,
pictorial wordless13 and written instructions (in English, Span-
ish) on how to complete the kit, and a postage-paid envelope for
returning the kit to the health center’s centralized laboratory. All
screening was conducted using the Polymedco OC FIT-Chek
(Polymedco, Inc., Cortlandt Manor, NY), a single-specimen
FIT that requires no dietary restrictions.
Research and clinic staff developed reminders using
materials adapted from the National Colorectal Cancer
Roundtable.14 All written and automated reminders (e.g.,
reminder letter, automated phone calls, text messages,
patient portal messages) were developed in English and
translated into Spanish and Russian by certified bilingual
project staff. The script for the live call was developed in
English and translated into Spanish by bilingual project
staff (none of the outreach workers spoke Russian).
Study Procedures
Centralized clinic outreach staff used electronic health record
codes developed and refined in STOP CRC to identify adults
overdue for CRC screening who had attended a clinic visit
within the calendar year.15 A total of 3462 adults met the
criteria and were mailed an introductory letter. Clinic staff
identified anyone whose letter was returned by the post office
as undeliverable, and reviewed the medical records to identify
anyone who was up to date with CRC screening (not captured
using health record codes), and removed 740 names. The
remaining 2722 adults were mailed a FIT kit (2 weeks later).
An additional 244 patients were excluded after the mailing
because they reported prior CRC screening, declined partici-
pation or no longer received care at Sea Mar, or had an invalid
address (not previously identified).
Patients who returned their FITs within 3 weeks (n = 255)
and who had patient portal accounts (n = 213) were not
randomized. Those with patient portal accounts were sent
two email reminders to return their FITs. The remaining
2010 were stratified by clinic and randomized (in a 1:1 ratio)
into one of the seven intervention groups via a random number
algorithm generated by the project analyst. Clinic outreach
staff assigned eligible participants to the intervention in se-
quential order. Reminders were delivered on a set schedule
(Table 1). Live calls were delivered by bilingual patient advo-
cates fluent in English and Spanish, and interpreter services
were available for patients who spoke other languages. Live
calls were made between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
All automated calls, text messages, and patient portal mes-
sages were delivered by the health center’s vendor, ClientTell
(Valdosta, GA). For automated phone calls, patients were
invited to press “0” to be transferred immediately to speak to
a Sea Mar staff person. To lessen the burden on clinic staff, the
four clinics launched the intervention at 7-week intervals from
November 2015 to May 2016.
Analysis
We describe the demographic characteristics of all randomized
patients across each intervention arm, the percentage of FIT
kits returned after the FIT mailing and prior to randomization,
and the percentage of FIT kits returned within 6 months of
randomization. Our primary intention-to-treat analysis com-
pared FITreturn rates across treatment arms using a 6-degrees-
of-freedom Wald test. We performed the same test according
to language subgroup. If the Wald test was significant
(p < 0.05), we used logistic regression, adjusting for clinic,
to compare the effects in each treatment arm, including the
patient portal arm, to the reminder letter reference group. We
did not adjust the paired analyses for multiple comparisons,
because our findings were considered exploratory.
For the per-protocol analysis sample, we excluded patients
whose reminder letters were returned by the post office as
undeliverable and those who had disconnected or non-
working phone numbers, among other reasons. Sea Mar’s
vendor relayed whether an automated message was left on a
recipient’s voice mail or whether the call was answered in
person. Clinic outreach staff entered telephone numbers into
an online search engine to determine whether the number was
assigned to a landline or cell phone. Patients receiving text
messages who had landlines were excluded from the per-
protocol sample (n = 93; 30%). The vendor provided no

RESULTS
A total of 2010 patients were randomized to one of the seven
reminder arms (Fig. 1). Randomized patients were mostly
aged 50–64 years, and men and women were represented in
similar proportions (Table 2). Hispanics represented about
one-quarter of the sample, and nearly 20% of the sample
preferred speaking Spanish. Over three-quarters of the sample
were insured, and about one-half had family income less than
$20,000.
Overall, 512 randomized adults returned their FIT kits, for a
return rate of 25.5%. When we include those who returned
their FIT kits within the 3 weeks prior to randomization and
those in the patient portal group, the estimated overall return
rate was 32.7%. In intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocat-
ed to live phone call reminders had 50% greater odds of
completing their FIT kits than patients allocated to reminder
letters (Table 3). In contrast, patients who received text-
message reminders had 34% lower odds of returning their
FITs than patients who received mailed letters. We found no
significant differences in FIT completion rates for other re-
minder protocols compared to a simple reminder letter. A total
of 21% of individuals in the patient portal group returned their
FIT kits.
In per-protocol analysis (Table 4), overall FIT return was
highest in the groups that received either the live phone calls
(OR, 1.73; [95% CI, 1.16–2.58]) or the combination of auto-
mated and live calls (OR, 1.74; [95% CI, 1.17–2.60]). In per-
protocol analyses stratified by language preference, English-
preferring adults had higher odds of FIT return if they were

combination of a reminder letter and live call (OR, 1.78; [95%
CI, 1.07–2.97]), an automated and live call (OR, 1.73; [95% CI,
1.04–2.88]), or text message and live call (OR, 1.90; [95% CI,
1.15–3.14]). Among Spanish-preferring adults, higher odds of
FIT return were associated with the combination of automated
and live phone calls (OR, 3.45; [95% CI, 1.42–8.39]).
In total, 79% of randomized adults were reached; reach was
highest for the patient portal (98%) and reminder-letter groups
(95%) and lowest for the text-message (70%) and automated-
call (65%) groups (Table 1). Among the 202 adults reached via
automated phone call, 62% received a voice message and 38%
were reached in person. Among the 228 reached via the live
call, 50% were reached in person.
DISCUSSION
Previous research has acknowledged the success of direct-mail
fecal testing programs and the limitations of point-of-care
methods for delivery of fecal testing.5 We assessed the effec-
tiveness of automated reminders and combined automated and
live reminders for a direct-mail FIT program in a large, diverse
community health center in western Washington. While many
direct-mail fecal testing programs have delivered patient re-
minders, ours is the first study to rigorously test the effective-
ness of these reminders in a community health center popula-
tion, and among patients with differing language preferences.
We observed important variations in return rates based on
reminder mode used, and both the overall return rate and
reminder mode effectiveness differed according to patients’
language preferences. In general, modes that included a live
call performed better than modes that relied solely on written
communication (a text message or letter). Despite our effort to
translate written and automated reminders for the three most
common languages spoken by patients in the health center
(English, Spanish, and Russian), low levels of health literacy
are thought to be common among patients served by commu-
nity health centers. For patients who preferred speaking Span-
ish, the combination of the automated and live phone calls
produced the highest return rates. A live call may help build
trust (confianza), an important value and motivator for care-
seeking among Latinos.
Overall, patients who received live reminder phone calls
were more likely to complete a FIT than those who were
mailed reminder letters; this finding is consistent with some
previous evaluations and inconsistent with others. Among
Latino and Vietnamese patients in a large public hospital,
Walsh and colleagues reported a significant boost in self-
reported fecal testing rates among patients who received a
mailed fecal test and telephone counseling compared to those
who received only a mailed fecal test (absolute percentages in
each group: 25% vs. 15%; p < 0.01).16 In contrast, Levy and
colleagues tested the effectiveness of a direct-mail FIT pro-
gram targeting 373 consented participants in rural primary
practices in Iowa, with and without a structured live reminder
phone call delivered by project staff, and found no additional
boost in FIT returns (absolute percentages in each group: 45%
vs. 49%; p = 0.50).17 Our findings suggest that a live call is
superior to a mailed reminder in improving FIT returns.
Contrary to expectations, we observed lower odds of FIT
return among adults assigned to receive text-message re-
minders, and the effect was unchanged in per-protocol analy-
sis where landline phone numbers were removed from the

 denominator. Baker and colleagues and Gupta and colleagues
used text-message reminders in direct-mail FIT programs;
however, both combined this approach with concurrently de-
livered automated phone calls, making it unclear how to
attribute the effect.2, 5 However, in sub-analyses limited to
those who did and did not receive a text-message reminder,
Baker and colleagues reported no difference in return rates
(44% vs. 44%), suggesting minimal influence from this ap-
proach.2 Our findings show that text messages, by themselves,
performed more poorly than reminder letters.
We observed that randomized patients who preferred Spanish
returned their FITs at a higher rate than patients who preferred
English (FIT return rates: 34% v. 22%, p < 0.001; data not
shown). This finding may reflect the relatively low likelihood
that Latino patients will discuss CRC screening with their
doctors during in-clinic visits.14 Our research team previously
reported a higher FIT return rate for Spanish speakers than
English speakers in a direct-mail FIT program delivered to
patients in a community health center (FIT return rate: 46%
vs. 28%, respectively).11 Similarly, Gupta and colleagues re-
ported higher direct-mail FIT return rates by Hispanics than
non-Hispanic whites (FIT return rate: 48% vs. 34%, respective-
ly), although the differences were not directly tested.5 In con-
trast, Baker and colleagues reported no differences in the mag-
nitude of the effect of direct-mail and reminder interventions
based on race/ethnicity or preferred language.2
Program reach for follow-up reminders is an important con-
sideration, especially in community health centers, where pa-
tients’ contact information may become quickly outdated.
Among the limited number of studies conducted in community
health centers, Jean-Jacques and colleagues reported that 40%
of patients were reached after three live phone attempts, and that
23% of available phone numbers were either incorrect or dis-
connected.8 Similarly, Singal and colleagues and Baker and
colleagues separately reported that only 48% and 37% of
intended recipients, respectively, were reached with up to three
attempts to deliver a live-call reminder.2, 9 We observed that
81% of intended recipients were reached using up to two
attempts to deliver a live call. Previous studies have reported
that automated phone calls were successfully delivered to 76–
89% of intended recipients,2, 4, 18 with over half (51–54%) of
the calls answered by a voice message system.2, 4 We observed
lower reach for automated phone calls in our study (65%). Text
messages were successfully delivered to 51% of recipients in a
study by Baker and colleagues and to 78% of recipients in a
study by Goldman and colleagues.2, 4 We observed a 70% reach
for text messages. Our findings underscore the importance of
maintaining up-to-date telephone contact information for the
delivery of both automated and live telephone reminders.
The effectiveness of reminders must be weighed against the
costs of delivering those reminders and patient experience
with receiving reminders, among other factors. Automated
phone calls and text messages are the least costly options to
implement, yet live reminders may allow staff to address or
triage other patient health care needs. Future research might
assess the views of clinic leadership and patients regarding the
value of FIT reminders.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study had a number of strengths, including its large and
diverse sample, randomized design, and the near-complete cap-
ture of fecal testing events and demographic characteristics in the
electronic health record. In addition, we used a waiver of in-
formed consent to avoid selection bias. The delivery of live
reminders by bilingual (English and Spanish) clinic staff also
meant that the quality of intervention delivery did not differ
measurably between patients whose preferred language was En-
glish or Spanish. Moreover, our delineation of phone numbers as
cell or landline numbers allowed us to uniquely assess return rates
among patients in the text-message group who had cell phones.
Notwithstanding these strengths, however, the study did
have several limitations. Relatively few patients in our sample
had active patient portal accounts, and the non-randomized
allocation to this group meant that we were unable to more
rigorously assess the effectiveness of this modality compared

 to other reminder modes. Some aspects of our available data
limited our ability to ascertain whether a patient received the
reminder(s). Additionally, it is possible that letters sent to
invalid addresses may not always have been returned and that
automated phone messages could have been delivered to
unintended recipients. Also, even though we determined
whether phone numbers were cell or landline numbers, we
could not be certain that cell phones enabled text-message
functions. We have no way of knowing the magnitude of this
misclassification.
CONCLUSION
Our FIT kit reminder study involved adults receiving care at a
community health center in the Pacific Northwest. Our find-
ings show that there are variations in FIT return rates based on
reminder mode used and that both the overall return rate and
effectiveness of reminder mode differs according to patient
language preference. Our data appear to suggest that re-
minders that included a live call performed better than re-
minders that relied on written communication (a text or letter).
