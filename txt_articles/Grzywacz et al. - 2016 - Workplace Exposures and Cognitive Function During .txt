Abstract
 Objective—Expand understanding of the role of selected workplace exposures (i.e., 
occupational complexity, conflict in the workplace, pace of work, and physical hazards) in adults’ 
cognitive function.
 Methods—Cross-sectional data (n=1,991) from the second wave of the Midlife in the United 
States (MIDUS) study; restricted to participants who completed telephone-based cognitive 
assessments of episodic memory, executive functioning, and self-perceived memory. Occupational 
exposure data were harvested from the O*NET Release 6.0.
 Results—Greater complexity was associated with better self-perceived memory among 
women and men, and better episodic memory and executive functioning among women. Greater 
physical hazards was independently associated with poorer episodic memory and executive 
functioning.
 Conclusions—Objective assessments of physical and psychosocial exposures in the 
workplace are independently associated with cognitive outcomes in adulthood, with psychosocial 
exposures being particularly pronounced among women.

Occupation is widely believed to shape adults’ cognition and trajectories of cognitive change 
across the lifespan. Substantial occupational epidemiological research highlights the threats 
posed by physical agents in the workplace. There is compelling evidence that chronic 
occupational exposure to lead is associated with poorer cognitive function later in life.1 
Likewise, there is a substantial body of research implicating organophosphates,2 various 
solvents,3,4 and particular types of noise5,6 result in poorer cognitive outcomes including

 cognitive disorders. An increasing body of research questions whether chronic exposure to 
intellectual, social, and interpersonal agents in the workplace shape adult trajectories of 
cognitive change. Occupational complexity or the extent to which workers must make 
decisions with ambiguous or competing contingencies7 has been associated with better 
cognitive outcomes in both clinical8,9 and general population samples.10–15 These 
associations are frequently interpreted in terms of “cognitive reserve,” or the idea that jobs 
requiring frequent problem solving provide regular opportunities to enhance brain structures 
and connections that are protective against aging-related or environmental insults to the 
brain.16
The Job Demands-Control (JDC) model17 offers two additional perspectives on the often-
cited protective effects of occupational complexity. The first perspective provided by the 
JDC model draws attention to the health implications of “demands” or the patterned and 
spontaneous stressors that occur through or arise from performing the job. Specifically, the 
JDC model would argue that psychological demands imposed on workers, such as 
inappropriate production goals or pace of work and interpersonal conflict in the workplace, 
likely have direct effects on any health outcome. Second, if the decision making component 
of “occupational complexity” is conceived of as a form of “control” or the amount of 
freedom workers have over tasks and how they are performed, the JDC model would argue 
that the putative benefit of occupational complexity depends on the relative level of 
psychological demands. This argument receives some empirical support. In contrast to the 
evidence linking complexity to cognitive outcomes, some researchers find null or inverse 
associations between complexity and cognitive outcomes.18,19 Such an inconsistency is 
suggestive of modifying effects, and there is evidence that individuals in jobs characterized 
by high demands and low control (so called ‘high strain jobs”) have poorer cognitive 
outcomes.20
Research on the putative role of occupational experiences in shaping cognition across 
adulthood is developing, but several meaningful gaps remain in the literature. First, the 
evidence base is carved into clear silos, such that physical agents in the workplace is largely 
done by industrial hygienists and occupational epidemiologists, whereas research focused on 
the social and psychological agents in the workplace is largely performed by social 
epidemiologists, organizational psychologists, or organizational behavior researchers. Cross-
fertilization of ideas is rare, and there are few cases where both physical and psychosocial 
agents in the workplace are considered simultaneously in the same analysis. Likewise, there 
is substantial variability in the methods employed in this domain of research. Several 
population studies of aging rely on self-reported measures of cognitive function10,13,16 or 
occupational characteristics.15,20 Others use more sophisticated measures of both, including 
composite measures of job exposures from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles11,21,22 or 
the Occupational Information Network (O*NET).13,23,24 Few studies have used robust 
indicators of cognitive function and occupational characteristics13,22,25 and we could locate 
no studies that consider possible modifying effects of objectively assessed psychological 
demands on the occupational complexity - cognitive function association. Further, despite 
some evidence that the putative benefit of occupational complexity on subsequent cognitive 
capacity differs by gender,19 few studies examine possible variation in protective effects of

 mental demand on cognition by age, gender, or educational attainment despite the fact that 
these are major bases of occupational stratification.
The overall goal of this study was to expand understanding of the role of workplace 
exposures in both of the physical and psychosocial domains in adults’ cognitive function. To 
accomplish this goal we use objective assessments of occupational exposure from the 
O*NET integrated with the Midlife Development in the United States to accomplish two 
primary aims. Specifically, this study sought to: 1) delineate variation in selected indicators 
of adult cognitive function by objective indicators of occupational exposure to occupational 
complexity, as well as objective indicators of psychological demands; 2) determine whether 
associations of occupational complexity with cognitive function are modified by 
psychological demands; and 3) determine if associations of occupational complexity and 
psychological demands persist after further adjustment for exposure to physical hazards in 
the workplace. We also explore age, gender, and educational variation in associations of 
occupational characteristics with cognitive function.
 Method
 Participants
Data for this study was derived from the second wave of the Midlife in the United States 
(MIDUS) study, collected between 2004 and 2006. The initial wave two survey included 
4963 non-institutionalized adults aged 32–84 (M=55, SD=12.4), from the 48 contiguous 
states. The sample was obtained using a random digit dialing (RDD), for a response rate of 
71%. The cognitive measurements were obtained in a second telephone interview (n=4,186), 
with a completion rate of 86%. Forty seven percent of the participants were male, and their 
mean education level was 14.24 years (SD = 2.60). We limited our analysis to data collected 
at the second wave, as the first wave (1995–1996) was not matched with the O*NET 
occupational scoring.
The initial sample included MIDUS participants who were employed at the time of data 
collection (N=2,273). Final analyses were performed on a subsample of respondents who 
provided all necessary data (n=1,991). To test for non-random attrition, we compared 
participants with and without complete data. Participants who did not provide all the 
necessary data were approximately two years older, more likely to be female, had greater 
educational attainment, and had more functional limitations. The mean age of participants in 
our sample was 51.4 (SD=9. 7) and ranged between the ages of 32 and 81. Just under half 
the sample (49.7%) was male (n=989). The sample was well educated with 43.9%having 
earned an undergraduate college degree (BS/BA) or more, 52.3% completing high school 
and some college or technical training, and 3.8% with less than a high school degree.
 Measures
 Dependent variables—Cognitive function was assessed using the Brief Test of Adult 
Cognition by Telephone (BTACT).26,27 The BTACT was designed especially to enable 
assessment of cognitive functioning in large community based samples. Unlike other 
cognitive batteries (such as the Mini Mental State Examination,28 the BTACT aims to

 identify non-pathological variation in cognitive function. Participants were asked to 
complete a series of tests after a brief hearing test.
The BTACT includes seven cognitive dimensions: immediate recall and delayed recall of a 
list of 15 words; working memory span, where participants are asked to repeat a series of 
digits in reversed order; verbal fluency – examines the number of animals participant can 
recall in 60 seconds; inductive reasoning – where participants are requested to complete the 
next number in a series of 5 numbers; processing speed – the number of digits completed in 
30 seconds by counting backwards from 100; attention switching task – in this task 
participants’ reaction times are recorded in two conditions: a normal condition in which they 
are asked to respond with “go” to the stimulus “green” and “stop” to the stimulus red”, and a 
reverse condition were they are asked to respond with “stop” to the stimulus “greed” and 
“go” to “red”.
The 5 later tests reflect the construct of executive functioning, and the first two tests 
(immediate and delayed recall) reflect respondents’ episodic memory. This structure was 
confirmed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.29 In this study, we will only 
use the two constructs and will not present the results for the separate tasks. The scores were 
standardized. Self-perceived memory was assessed with a single item asking respondents to 
compare their memory to their age counterparts. Responses ranged from 1 “poor” to 5 
“excellent”.
 Independent variables—The independent variables in our models were based on the 
Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The O*NET collects information regarding 
occupational characteristics by surveying occupation analysts and workers from each 
occupation, under the sponsorship of the US Department of Labor/Employment and 
Training Administration. The collection of data from workers is aimed at identifying the 
typical workers’ characteristics in each occupation, the requirements from workers, 
occupational requirements and the characteristics of the workforce typical of the occupation. 
The current O*NET taxonomy covers 974 occupations, and provides scaling on 227 
variables. A subset of the O*NET variables, largely those reflecting the Occupational 
Requirements section of the O*NET content model30 were harvested from the O*NET 
Release 6.0, which was released July 2004. Release 6.0 data were harvested as they were 
most temporally proximal to the collection of occupational information from MIDUS 
respondents.
Occupational complexity was measured with a single item determining the degree to which 
the job requires workers to identify complex problems, review related information to 
develop and evaluate options, and implement solutions. Two indicators of psychological 
demand were obtained. Pace of work refers to the role that time constraints play in the way 
job tasks are performed and was assessed with four items relating to the frequency in which 
worker has to meet strict deadlines; the level to which the pace of the job is set by speed of 
machinery or equipment; the regularity of the work schedule; and the number of hours 
worked in a typical work week. Finally, the amount of conflict workers are likely to 
encounter at their work (conflict at work) was assessed with three items assessing the 
frequency workers: face conflict situations in the job; deal with unpleasant, angry or

 discourteous individuals as part of the job requirements; and deal with physical aggression 
of violent individuals.
Physical hazards in the workplace reflects the combination of two sets of items. The first set 
of items assessed the frequency of exposure to hazardous conditions, the likelihood of injury 
as well as the degree of injury resulting from the exposure, if an injury occurred. The list of 
hazardous conditions includes exposure to: radiation; disease or infections; high places, 
hazardous conditions in general; hazardous equipment; and minor cuts, burns, bites or 
stings. The second set of items assessed exposure to environmental conditions. The list of 
environmental conditions included exposure to uncomfortable or distracting levels of sounds 
or noises; very hot or cold temperatures; extremely bright or inadequate lighting; exposure to 
contaminants; cramped workspace; and exposure to whole body vibrations. The correlation 
between the “hazards” and “environmental conditions” was high (r=.84, p<.001); 
consequently, the two scores could not be used separately. Factor analysis with Varimax 
rotation revealed that all but two items loaded on a single factor (eigenvalue of 6.7). 
Consequently, all the items except for the two that did not load (i.e., exposure to radiation 
and exposure to diseases and contaminations) were combined to create a single physical 
hazards variable
 Control variables—Age (continuous) and gender (male=1) were assessed as likely 
confounds of posited associations of occupational exposures and cognitive function. 
Likewise, educational attainment was assessed using a single item asking participants to 
report the highest level of education completed. Response options were: (1) no school/some 
grade school; (2) eighth grade/junior high school; (3) some high school (9–12 years) no 
diploma/no GED; (4) graduated from high school; (5) 1 to 2 years of college, no degree yet; 
(6) 3 or more years of college, no degree yet; (7) graduated from 2-year college, vocational 
school, or associated degree; (8) graduated from a 4 or 5 year college, or bachelor's degree; 
(9) some graduate school; (10) master's degree; PhD, EdD, MD, DDS, LLB, LLD, JD, or 
other professional degree. Finally, functional limitations were assessed by asking 
participants to report level of limitation in performing a list of 8 daily activities including: 
lifting/carrying groceries; bathing/dressing; climbing several flight stair; climbing one flight 
of stairs; bending/kneeling/stooping; walking more than one mile; walking several blocks 
and walking one block. Each item was rated on a scale ranging from 1 “not at all” to 4 “a 
lot”. The score was created by averaging the items (M=1.56, SD=.76).
 Analysis
Multilevel models were fit to account for dependence among observations resulting from the 
clustering of individuals in the same occupational groups. Prior to conducting final analyses, 
an unconditional model was fit to calculate the intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient to 
determine the proportion of the variance explained by the different occupational groups. ICC 
scores were significant (above 5% of variation) and vary as follows: episodic memory 
(ICC=.07); executive functioning (ICC=.15); self-perceived memory (ICC=.05).
A stepwise model building strategy was used for each indicator of cognitive function. In the 
first step the outcome was regressed on occupational complexity and the indicators of

 psychological demand (i.e., pace of work, conflict at work) and relevant control variables to 
determine if occupational complexity and the indicators of psychological demand were 
independently associated with the outcome. In the second step, two-way interactions of 
complexity with pace of work and complexity with conflict were added to the model to 
delineate possible moderation effects. Only significant interactions were carried forward to 
the third and final step where physical hazards were added to the model.
 Results
Means, Standard deviations and correlations between study variables are presented in Table 
1. The independent variables occupational complexity, pace of work, conflict at work, and 
physical hazards were associated with nearly every indicator of cognitive function. The only 
exception was a null association of conflict at work with self-perceived memory. 
Occupational complexity and conflict at work were positively correlated with both episodic 
memory (r = 0.10, p < 0.001; r = 0.08, p < 0.001 respectively) and executive functioning (r = 
0.23, p < 0.001; r = 0.05, p < 0.05 respectively). Occupational complexity was positively 
associated with self-perceived memory (r = 0.11, p < 0.001), the association of conflict at 
work with self-perceived memory approached significance (r = 0.04, p < 0.10). Pace of work 
and physical hazards were negatively correlated with episodic memory (r = −0.12, p < 
0.001; r = −0.17, p <0.001, respectively), executive functioning (r = −0.14, p < 0.001; r = 
−0.21, p < 0.001, respectively), and self-perceived memory (r = −0.05, p < 0.05 r = −0.08, p 
< 0.001, respectively).
The first outcome considered was episodic memory (Table 2). Consistent with the cognitive 
reserve hypothesis, greater occupational complexity was associated with better episodic 
memory (b = 0.003, p < 0.05). Neither of the psychological demand variables was associated 
with episodic memory, nor was there any evidence suggesting that psychological demand 
modifies the association of occupational complexity with episodic memory. Greater 
exposure to physical hazards was associated with poorer episodic memory (b = −0.005, p < 
0.01). Further, once exposure to physical hazards was added to the model, the previously 
significant association of occupational complexity with episodic memory was attenuated (p 
< 0.10).
Greater occupational complexity was associated with better executive function (b = 0.005, p 
< 0.001). Pace of work, one indicator of psychological demand, was inversely associated 
with executive function suggesting that individuals exposed to elevated pace of work had 
poorer executive function (b = −0.005, p < 0.05). Conflict at work was not associated with 
executive function. There was no evidence that psychological demand modifies the 
association of occupational complexity with executive function. Greater exposure to physical 
hazards was associated with poorer executive function (b = −0.01, p < 0.001). Once 
exposure to physical hazards was controlled, association of pace at work with executive 
function was attenuated to the null. The magnitude of the association of occupational 
complexity with executive function was also attenuated, but it retained statistical 
significance.

 The final outcome was self-perceived memory (Table 4). Greater occupational complexity 
was associated with better self-perceived memory (b = 0.003, p < 0.05). Neither of the 
psychological demand variables was associated with self-perceived memory. However, there 
was evidence that conflict at work modified the association of occupational complexity with 
self-perceived memory such that the association is stronger for higher levels of conflict, and 
weaker when conflict at the workplace is at mean or low (see Figure 1). There was no 
evidence that exposure to physical hazards was associated with self-perceived memory.
We explored whether the associations of occupational complexity, psychological demand 
(i.e., pace of work and conflict at work), and physical hazards with cognitive functioning 
differed across age groups, gender, and educational attainment. There was little consistent 
evidence suggesting that associations reported in Tables 2–4 differed by age or educational 
attainment. However, the association of conflict at work with executive functioning was 
found to differ by age (b = 0.0004, se = 0.001, p < 0.05). We evaluated the nature of the 
interaction by conducting a test of simple slopes by splitting the file into younger and older 
adults based on a simple median split of the age variable. The test of simple slopes indicated 
that conflict at work was not significantly associated with executive function in either age 
group.
The association of occupational complexity with two indicators of cognitive function 
differed by gender. The occupational complexity-by-gender interaction term for episodic 
memory was significant (b = −0.006, se = 0.004, p < 0.05), as was the occupational 
complexity-by-gender interaction term for executive functioning (b = −0.007, se = 0.002, p < 
0.05). Gender-stratified simple slopes analyses indicated that associations of occupational 
complexity with each outcome were significant for women (b = 0.006, se = 0.002, p < 0.01 
for episodic memory; b = 0.008, se = 0.002, p < 0.001 for executive functioning), but not for 
men. These differential slopes are illustrated in Figure 2.
 Discussion
The goal of this study was to expand understanding of the role of workplace exposures in 
adults’ cognitive function. Specifically, this study was designed to address the bifurcation in 
the cognitive aging literature that tends to separate physical and psychosocial exposures in 
the workplace, and the relative paucity of cognitive aging research with robust measures of 
both cognitive function and occupational characteristics. Additionally, this study considered 
interactive effects of discrete workplace exposures on adult cognition, and the possibility 
that the putative effects of workplace exposures on cognition may vary by age, gender and 
educational attainment (cf. Stenfors and colleagues19).
This analysis of objective indicators of occupational exposure found consistent associations 
between occupational complexity and each indicator of cognitive function. Consistent with 
the cognitive reserve hypothesis16 and a recent literature review31 we found that exposure to 
higher levels of occupational complexity was associated with better researcher-assessed 
episodic memory and executive function, as well as better self-perceived memory. These 
results are consistent with previous studies11,21,23 that used objective indicators of job 
exposure and self-reported cognitive ability, as well as the few other studies that have used

 rigorous measures on each side of the equation.13,22,25 Our findings contribute to the 
literature by replicating previous results in another national data set using different 
instruments to assess episodic memory and executive function. This replication provides 
compelling evidence of a robust association between exposure to occupational complexity 
and adults’ cognitive functioning that is consistent with notions of “cognitive reserve”.16
A second and equally meaningful contribution to the literature is our joint attention to both 
the physical and psychosocial environments in the workplace. Independent of occupational 
complexity, greater exposure to physical hazards in the workplace was associated with 
poorer episodic memory and executive function. These results are consistent with evidence 
from industrial hygiene research suggesting that greater exposure to chemicals like lead,1 
organophosphates2 and solvents3,4 are associated with poorer cognitive outcomes. They are 
also consistent with studies documenting that exposure to other physical hazards, like 
particular types of noise,5,6 may undermine cognitive function.
That both occupational complexity and physical hazards are independently associated with 
episodic memory and executive function is compelling. First, it highlights the reality that 
cognition in adulthood has a complex etiology, and signals the importance of looking across 
disciplines and fields for plausible predictors. More research combining physical and 
psychosocial workplace exposures is needed. Second, the independent associations of 
occupational complexity and physical hazards with objectively assessed cognitive outcomes 
may offer insight into well-described socioeconomic inequalities in cognitive 
outcomes.32–34 Indeed, although not the focus of this study, it is noteworthy that associations 
of educational attainment with episodic memory and executive function were attenuated 
after exposure to physical hazards were added to the model containing occupational 
complexity. This finding is consistent with Marengoni’s and colleagues’32 finding that high 
physical demand on the job attenuated but did not completely explain educational 
differences in incident cognitive impairment without dementia. Together the evidence is 
suggestive that additive or incremental workplace exposures in both the physical and 
psychosocial domains of work may be useful for explaining inequalities in cognitive aging. 
More research in this area is needed
Finally, three other findings of this study are noteworthy. First, it is noteworthy that the 
association of occupational complexity with self-perceived memory was modified by 
conflict at work. This association is consistent with the Job Demand-Control model arguing 
that control and decision making in the workplace is a meaningful buffer of job stressors.17 
However, the meaningfulness of this finding must be tempered by the fact that it emerged 
only for the self-reported cognitive outcome. Second, it is interesting that the association of 
pace of work, essentially an indicator of time constraints in the workplace, with executive 
function was attenuated to non-significance after adjustment for exposure to physical 
hazards. This is an important area for additional research because it highlights the potential 
significance of physical and psychosocial workplace exposures in understanding 
occupational health outcomes. Finally, we found that associations of occupational 
complexity with objective indicators of cognitive function differed by gender such that the 
associations only held for women. A pair of manuscripts by Rieiro and Lourenco21,35 using 
data from Brazilian adults suggests that occupational complexity is equally relevant to both

 women and men. However, in their study that focused solely on women,35 these authors did 
suggest that the putative benefit of occupational complexity for cognitive functioning 
appears to be linear for men, but non-linear for women. That is, there was no difference in 
cognitive function between non-working women and those with low occupational 
complexity; whereas for men, there were notable differences in cognitive functioning 
between non-working men and those with low occupational complexity. Our results are 
completely opposite of these previous findings because they suggest that only women 
benefit from occupational complexity. Perhaps the survey items completed by O*Net 
occupational analysts and selected workers in work sites perform differently in male versus 
female dominated positions. Our findings coupled with the absence of parallel previous 
research and clear stratification in types of jobs held by women and men indicate that more 
research in the area is needed.
The contributions of this study need to be considered in light of its limitations. Most notably, 
the cross-sectional design undermines the ability to make causal inferences. Next, our 
occupational complexity measure consisted of a single item with unknown reliability. 
Furthermore, previous research suggests that complexity with data (relative to complexity 
with people or things)11 or that complexity with people (relative to complexity with data or 
things)12 may be most instrumental for cognitive function in later life. Although both the 
single item and the lack of differentiation in the type of complexity are weaknesses, the 
threat of these weaknesses is somewhat lessened by the convergence of the current results 
with the critical mass of previous research. Another limitation of this study is difficulty 
interpreting the observed gender differences in the effects of workplace exposures on 
cognitive function. Because of gender stratification in the workplace, we cannot discern 
whether the differential effects of workplace exposure are different for women, or if they are 
different because women occupy different types of jobs where variation in these exposures is 
more salient. Each of these limitations necessitates further research.
Limitations notwithstanding, this manuscript makes several contributions to the literature. 
We replicate previous research demonstrating potential enhancements to adults’ cognitive 
reserve from occupational complexity, although the benefits of complexity to episodic 
memory and executive functioning were limited to women. Newer to the literature is clear 
and consistent evidence that exposure to physical hazards in the workplace undermines 
cognitive function for both women and men, independent of the effects of complexity. 
Collectively these results highlight the importance of ongoing attention directed toward 
occupational exposures, both physical and psychosocial, in understanding cognition among 
adults and potentially cognitive trajectories across adulthood.
