Background-—Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) accounts for approximately one third of deaths in women. Although
there is an established relationship between positive patient experiences, health-related quality of life, and improved health
outcomes, little is known about gender differences in patient-reported outcomes among ASCVD patients. We therefore compared
gender differences in patient-centered outcomes among individuals with ASCVD.
Methods and Results-—Data from the 2006 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative US sample,
were used for this study. Adults ≥18 years with a diagnosis of ASCVD, ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) codes and/or self-reported data, were included. Linear and logistic regression were used to compare self-reported
patient experience, perception of health, and health-related quality of life by gender. Models adjusted for demographics,
socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. There were 21 353 participants included, with >10 000 (47%-weighted) of the
participants being women, representing �11 million female adults with ASCVD nationwide. Compared with men, women with
ASCVD were more likely to experience poor patient–provider communication (odds ratio 1.25 [95% confidence interval 1.11–
1.41]), lower healthcare satisfaction (1.12 [1.02–1.24]), poor perception of health status (1.15 [1.04–1.28]), and lower health-
related quality of life scores. Women with ASCVD also had lower use of aspirin and statins, and greater odds of ≥2 Emergency
Department visits/y.
Conclusions-—Women with ASCVD were more likely to report poorer patient experience, lower health-related quality of life, and
poorer perception of their health when compared with men. These findings have important public health implications and require
more research towards understanding the gender-specific differences in healthcare quality, delivery, and ultimately health
outcomes among individuals with ASCVD. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e010498. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010498)

A
therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of
the leading causes of morbidity and mortality,1–3
accounting for at least one third of deaths in women
worldwide.4 In the United States, almost 48 million women
are affected by ASCVD.4 The excess mortality from ASCVD in
women compared with men5 has generated much interest in
women’s cardiovascular health in recent decades. Research
studies have demonstrated an increased risk of hospitaliza-
tion and higher healthcare expenditure among women
compared with men with ASCVD.6,7 Some studies have also
shown that compared with men, women with ASCVD were
more likely to experience delays in undergoing lifesaving

 revascularization procedures,8,9 and less likely to undergo
cardiac rehabilitation,10–12 or receive recommended preven-
tive pharmacotherapies.13,14 Major cardiovascular risk factors
such as smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus also appear
to be more deleterious in women than in men.15,16 These
overwhelming results have led to the intensification of
research, focusing on the influence of sex and gender in
cardiovascular disease.17 These efforts have improved the
understanding of gender-specific differences in cardiovascular
disease and have resulted in an �30% reduction in female
mortality from ASCVD.16
However, among individuals living with ASCVD, little is
known regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
patient healthcare experience based on gender, even though
these patient-reported matrices have been demonstrated to
be associated with improved health outcomes among ASCVD
patients.3 To bridge this gap in knowledge, using a nationally
representative US sample of individuals with ASCVD, we
compared the patient-reported outcomes of their healthcare
experience, self-perception of health and HRQoL, based on
gender. Understanding potential gender disparities in patient-
centered metrics could provide opportunities for more
favorable healthcare delivery and outcomes among individuals
with ASCVD.
Methods
Data Availability Statement
The authors will not directly release the data and materials
from this project. However, the Medical Expenditure Panel Sur-
vey (MEPS) data sets used in this project are made available
from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to
prospective researchers and are easily replicable from the
methods described in the article.
Study Design and Sampling
Data from the MEPS were used to conduct this retrospective
study. MEPS data are collected and sponsored by the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality through national series of
surveys containing information on individuals and families,
their health service providers, and employers. The MEPS is
reported annually and collects information on sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, patient experience, medical condi-
tions, prescription medication, health resource utilization,
associated costs, and sources of payment, reported in
different data files. Additional information on healthcare
utilization and cost is collected from physicians, hospitals, and
pharmacies. To be nationally representative, person-weight
and variance estimation stratum are assigned to each
respondent to account for survey nonresponse and the
characteristics of the national population of the survey year.
To obtain comprehensive information on each participant,
using unique person identifiers, we merged 3 different yearly
MEPS files: full-year consolidated data files, medical condi-
tions files, and the prescription medicine files, each of which
contains specific information on the participants. The full-year
consolidated data files contain sociodemographic information,
health resource utilization, and information related to patient
healthcare experience and healthcare expenditure. The med-
ical conditions files contain information on self-reported and
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses of medical conditions. The
prescription medicine files contain information on names of
medications, drug codes, and dates. According to the
Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, this
study was exempt from Institutional Review Board review
because MEPS is a de-identified, publicly available data set.
We pooled information from 2006 to 2015 MEPS data
(Figure 1). For this analysis, individuals ≥18 years of age with
a diagnosis of ASCVD (coronary artery disease, stroke, and/or
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Among individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-
ease, women were more likely to report poor communica-
tion with their healthcare providers, poor satisfaction with
their healthcare experience, and poor self-perception of
health compared with their male counterparts, even after
accounting for sociodemographic factors and other comor-
bidities.
• Women with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were
less likely to report aspirin and statin use and had increased
use of the Emergency Department compared with their male
counterparts.
• There was no significant association between patient–
provider gender concordance/discordance with respect to
the majority of patient-reported outcomes among individu-
als with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however,
female patients treated by female providers reported better
health-related quality of life in the physical component
score.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Women with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have
worse patient-reported outcomes.
• This has important public health implications, and measures
should be undertaken to promote equitable healthcare
delivery.
• More work is needed to understand why women report
poorer communication with their healthcare providers and
worse healthcare experience compared with men.

 peripheral artery disease, ascertained by self-report or any of
the following ICD-9-CM codes: 410, 413, 414, 433–437, 440,
and 443, respectively) with positive sampling weights (for
national representativeness) were included.
Study Variables
Patient–provider communication
Annually, participants of the MEPS answered questionnaires
derived from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
Providers and Systems survey. Responses to the following
communication-related questions recommended by the Con-
sumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
consortium were used to assess patient–provider communi-
cation (PPC): (1) How often healthcare providers explained
things in a way that was easy to understand? (2) How often
providers showed respect for what you had to say? (3) How
often providers spent enough time with you? (4) How often
providers listened carefully to you? The responses to these
questions were reported on a 4-point Likert scale: 1-never, 2-
sometimes, 3-usually, and 4-always. Healthcare provider refers
to both physicians and nonphysicians. As recommended by
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems,
“never” and “sometimes” responses were collapsed into a
single variable labeled “never/sometimes.”3 The responses
were therefore recoded and labeled as 1-never/sometimes, 2-
usually, and 3-always (Table S1). The responses to these 4
questions were summed up to give a total score ranging from 4
to 12. We generated a weighted average response from 1 to 3,
represented as 1—“Poor PPC,” 2—“Average PPC,” 3—“Opti-
mal PPC,” and then combined “Average” and “Optimal” PPC to
obtain a binary variable (Poor PPC versus Average/Optimal
PPC), using poor PPC as the outcome.3 Similarly, in the
analysis of the responses to each of the PPC-related questions,
“never/sometimes” responses were used as the outcome of
interest
(“never/sometimes”
versus
“usually/always”)
(Table S1). The responses to the PPC-related questions are
also components of the ALERT model (Always, Listen Carefully,
Explain Things Understandably, Respect What the Patient Has
to Say, Time Management), designed to help physicians recall
the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
Systems questions.3,18
Patient satisfaction
Patient satisfaction with health care received was assessed
using participants’ response to the question: “Rating of health
care from all doctors and other health providers,” from 0
(worst health care possible) to 10 (best health care possible).
To truly identify unsatisfied respondents, we classified this
variable into 2 categories: “Poor Patient Satisfaction” (scores
≥0 to ≤3) or “Excellent/Good Patient Satisfaction” (scores ≥4
to ≤10).
Healthcare-related quality of life and perception of
health status
We defined HRQoL using the summary scores from the
physical-health component score (PCS) and the mental-health
component score (MCS) of the 12-item Short Form version 2,

 with PCS and MCS scores ranging from 0 (worst health status
possible) to 100 (best health status possible). To detect the
mean difference in HRQoL based on gender, we analyzed
these summary scores as continuous variables. We also
further divided the summary scores into quartiles, using the
lowest quartile in both the physical and mental component to
reflect poor HRQoL.
Information on self-perception of overall health was
collected at 3 different points annually. The responses were
provided on a 5-point Likert scale: 1-excellent, 2-very good, 3-
good, 4-fair, and 5-poor. It was further dichotomized it into a
binary variable, with fair and poor responses as a single
variable labeled as “Poor” (average score ≥4) and excellent,
very good and good responses combined and labeled as
“Good” (average score <4).
ASCVD medication utilization
Given the established role of aspirin and statin medications
for the secondary prevention management of ASCVD, we
ascertained the utilization of these medications by gender as
a quality-of-care indicator among these individuals with
ASCVD.3 During the data collection process, MEPS partici-
pants provided the names of their prescribed medications and
where they were obtained. Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality researchers collected more detailed information
on these medications, from the drug stores and pharmacies,
with the consent of the respondents.3 Lipid-lowering medica-
tions containing a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
agent were coded as statins.3 A self-reported response to the
question posed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality researchers: “does the person take aspirin fre-
quently?” was used to measure aspirin use.3
Healthcare resource utilization
Information on the total number of Emergency Department
visits and hospitalizations per survey year is contained in the
MEPS full-year consolidated file. Two or more Emergency
Department visits or hospitalizations per survey year were
used as a measure of increased health resource utilization.3
Gender of the respondent and other covariates
The gender of the MEPS participants was used as the primary
predictor variable. Additional variables used for this study
include age, race/ethnicity, family income, health insurance,
education, geographical region, marital status, employment
status, modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (without cardio-
vascular components) and cardiovascular modifiable risk
factor (CRF) profile. We classified sociodemographic charac-
teristics into various subgroups: 4 categories were used for
age (18–39, 40–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years); 4 categories for
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, black, Asian, and His-
panic); 4 categories for family income (poor/very low income
[<125% of the federal poverty level], low income [125% to
<200% federal poverty level], middle income [200% to <400%
federal poverty level], and high income [≥400% federal poverty
level]); 5 categories for health insurance (uninsured, Medicaid,
private, Medicare, and a combination of private and public
insurance); 3 for education (less than high school, high
school/Graduate Educational Development, and some college
or higher); 4 for geographical region (Northeast, Midwest,
South, and West); 5 for marital status (married, widowed,
divorced, separated, and never married); 3 for employment
status (currently unemployed, currently employed, and cur-
rently unemployed but was employed within the past
12 months); and 3 categories for modified Charlson Comor-
bidity Index (0, 1, and ≥2). Individuals with self-report and/or
ICD-9 diagnosis of hypertension; ICD-9 code 401, diabetes
mellitus; ICD-9 code 250, and dyslipidemia; ICD-9 code 272,
received a score of “1” for each unfavorable cardiovascular
risk factor (Table S2). Individuals reporting inadequate
physical exercise (lack of participation in moderate-vigorous
physical activity for ≥30 minutes, for ≥5 times/wk), currently
smoking, and obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) also
received a score of “1” for each unfavorable risk factor
(Table S2). The total of the unfavorable risk factors per
individual was used to classify their CRF profile into 3
categories: “Poor CRF Profile” (≥4 CRFs), “Average CRF
Profile” (2–3 CRFs), or “Optimal CRF Profile” (0–1 CRFs). The
responses of the MEPS participants to the question “Is Your
Provider Male or Female” were used to identify the gender of
the healthcare provider. We gender-matched the respondents
and their healthcare providers to evaluate the influence of
patient–provider
gender
concordance/discordance
on
patient-reported outcomes among individuals with ASCVD.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, version
13.1 (StataCorp, LP, College Station, TX), with a P<0.05
considered as statistically significant. All analyses took into
consideration the complex survey-specific design of MEPS,
and used appropriate variance estimation and person-level
weights to achieve national representativeness. We used v2
tests to compare demographic characteristics in the study
sample. Linear regression models were used to measure the
association of gender (comparing women with men) with the
HRQoL scores (continuous), and logistic regression models
were applied for all other binary outcomes. All linear and
logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race/
ethnicity, region, level of income, level of education, health
insurance, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and modifiable risk
factors of ASCVD. Similar measures of association were used
to compare patient-reported outcomes, based on patient–
provider gender match. A patient–provider pair was said to be

Results
Sample Characteristics
There were 349 405 individuals sampled in the MEPS from
2006 to 2015, of which 21 353 were included in our study,
translating to about 23.3 million noninstitutionalized US
civilian adults with ASCVD (Figure 1). A description of the
sample population is shown in Table 1. Over 10 000 (47%) of
the participants were women (representing �11 million
female adults with ASCVD nationwide). The majority of the
participants were non-Hispanic white, middle-aged, from the
southern region of the country, and of higher socioeconomic
strata. Women were more likely than men to be unemployed,
have less than a high school education, and be widowed/
divorced but more likely to have a regular healthcare provider.
Patient Experience
A greater proportion of women with ASCVD reported poor
communication with their healthcare providers (12% of men
versus 15% of women, P<0.001) (Figure 2). In analyses
adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidities (Table 2), compared with men, women with
ASCVD
were
more
likely
to
report
an

worse
healthcare experience, having a higher odds of reporting
that their healthcare provider never/sometimes listened
(odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–
1.42), never/sometimes showed respect for their opinion
(OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.38), and never/sometimes spent
enough time with them (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20–1.54)
(Table 2). Overall, compared with men, women with ASCVD
had 25% higher odds of experiencing poor communication
with their healthcare providers (summary score, OR 1.25,
95% CI 1.11–1.41).
One in 4 women with ASCVD were dissatisfied with the
health care received from their providers. A lesser proportion

 reporting poor satisfaction with health care, when compared
with men (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.24) (Table 2).
Perception of Health and HRQoL
More women than men self-perceived their health status as
poor (33% of men versus 39% of women, P<0.001) (Figure 2).
Among those with ASCVD, an individual’s gender was
significantly associated with the perception of overall health
status; compared with men, women had 15% higher adjusted
odds of reporting that their health status was poor (OR 1.15,
95% CI 1.04–1.28) (Table 2).
There were gender-specific differences in HRQoL among
individuals with ASCVD; women with ASCVD had worse
HRQoL when compared with men. Overall, women had
significantly lower scores on both the 12-item short form
PCS and MCS scales, used to assess HRQoL, with women
reporting poorer scores for both the PCS and MCS measure-
ments when compared with men (68% versus 57%, and 39%
versus 30%, respectively) (Figure 2). In adjusted linear
regression analyses (Table 2), women with ASCVD were more
likely to have worse HRQoL scores with a mean difference of
�2.08 (95% CI �2.55, �1.61) in PCS and �1.57 (95% CI
�2.01, �1.13) in MCS when compared with men. Results
were similar in models further adjusted for provider type and
provider gender (Table S3).
As displayed in Table 3, female participants were less
likely to perceive their health status as poor if they were
gender-concordant with their healthcare provider (OR 0.78,
95% CI 0.64, 0.94) and were more likely to attain higher
scores in the physical component of the HRQoL item, when
compared with a gender-discordant pair. Overall, patient–
provider gender concordance/discordance did not seem to
show
any
significant
association
with
the
majority
of
patient-reported outcomes among individuals with ASCVD
(Table 3). There were no significant interactions between
the gender of the participants and patient–provider gender
concordance
on
any
of
the
patient-reported
outcome
measures, with the exception of the physical component
score of the HRQoL item; P for interaction=0.03.
In Table 4, the gender-specific differences in the surrogate
indicators for quality of cardiovascular care and health resource
utilization are shown. Compared with men with ASCVD, women
less likely to report use of aspirin (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58, 0.72)
and statin use (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.48, 0.62). Women with
ASCVD were 1.28 times more likely to utilize the Emergency
Department 2 or more times per survey year, compared with
men (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11, 1.46).
Further analyses also showed that trends in gender
differences in patient-reported outcomes among individuals
with ASCVD remained mostly the same, even after stratifica-
tion by race/ethnicity, age, level of income, and insurance
status (Figures S1 through S5).
Discussion
In a nationally representative sample of the US population
with ASCVD, women were more likely to report a poor patient
experience
(poorer
patient–provider
communication
and
lower satisfaction with the health care received) when
compared with men. Additionally, women were more likely
to have a poor perception of their health status and a lower
HRQoL when compared with men.
Patient experience is a key element of patient-centered
care. Evidence on the influence of gender on patient
experience has been conflicting; some studies suggest that
women report more effective communication,19 and are more
satisfied with their health care when compared with men.20 In
contrast, other studies report that women are more likely to
be dissatisfied with the health care received than men.21–23 A
prior analysis using data from the 2002 MEPS found that

 past year, women were less likely than men to feel their
providers always spent enough time with them.24 This is
consistent with our findings from the 2006 to 2015 MEPS
showing that women with ASCVD were more likely to report
poorer patient–provider communication than men.
Although a positive healthcare experience has been shown
to be associated with improved health outcomes among ASCVD
patients,3 there is a paucity of information on the influence of
gender on patient experience among ASCVD patients specif-
ically. This current study demonstrates that among individuals
with ASCVD, women are more likely to have a negative
healthcare experience when compared with men. Our results
are similar to the findings shown among surgical patients,
which demonstrated lower satisfaction among women com-
pared with men.25–28 Although the exact mechanism underly-
ing the poor patient experience among female patients is
unclear, women may be more assertive, have higher expecta-
tions and/or desire more participatory and interactive encoun-
ters
with
their
healthcare
providers.19
These
social
expectations may influence the interpretation of the commu-
nication skills of the healthcare provider to a greater degree,
hence impacting the overall patient satisfaction with health
care. Negative patient experience may be a contributing factor
to some of the worse outcomes demonstrated among women
with ASCVD. It is therefore important to explore the likely

 mechanisms responsible for the poor patient experience
among women with ASCVD and possible solutions to address
these disparities, which may provide better chances for
improved and equitable healthcare delivery.
Certain characteristics of the healthcare provider, such as
type of provider (physician versus nonphysician)29,30 and
gender of the healthcare provider have been associated with
patient-reported outcomes.31–33 Although there is a scarcity
of information addressing the interplay between these patient
and provider characteristics among individuals with ASCVD,
overall, reports on the influence of the gender of the
healthcare provider and patient–provider gender concordance
on patient experience has been mixed.31–35 Of note, a recent
study by Greenwood et al of patients with acute myocardial
infarction found a higher mortality for female patients treated
by male physicians, but similar outcomes for both male and
female patients treated by female physicians.34 This study
and others35 suggest that outcomes may be better for female
patients treated by female physicians. In the study by
Greenwood et al, the authors did find an association of
better outcomes for female patients if the treating male
physicians had worked with more female colleagues and had
more experience in treating women patients in the past,
compared with male physicians who had not.
Gender disparities in perceived patient–provider commu-
nication may be 1 possible explanation for worse outcomes in
women with ASCVD. The findings in this current study, which
demonstrated
poorer
patient-reported
outcomes
among
women with ASCVD when compared with men, remained
grossly the same after adjusting for provider factors including
provider gender. However, female participants had higher
scores on the physical component of the HRQoL item if they
were gender concordant with their healthcare provider (versus
gender discordant), whereas there was no association by
provider concordance status in male patients.
Positive patient-reported outcomes such as HRQoL and
perception of health have been demonstrated to be associated
with improved survival and health outcomes, playing a partic-
ularly important role among cancer patients.36 However, these
patient-centered measures have been shown to be poor among
individuals with cardiovascular disease,37 with some gender-
specific differences; in post–myocardial infarction patients,
HRQoL and self-perception of cardiovascular risk factors have
been demonstrated to be worse among women when compared
with men.38–40 Across all indications for coronary angiography,
women reported lower HRQoL than men irrespective of the
severity or treatment for coronary artery disease.41 These
results align with those generated from this study, as we show
that women with ASCVD had a lower HRQoL, which was more
prominent in the physical functioning aspect of their quality of
life, and a poorer perception of their overall health status when
compared with men.
Gender-specific differences have also been described in the
management of cardiovascular disease. Compared with men,
women were less likely to undergo a coronary artery bypass
graft42 and were less likely to receive evidence-based pharma-
cological and preventive therapies at discharge following
revascularization and/or myocardial infarction, which can
contribute to worse clinical outcomes.42–44 This current study
also found that women with ASCVD were less likely to report
the use of ASCVD-preventive therapies (eg, aspirin and statins),
when compared with men. With the “Go Red For Women”
campaign introduced by the American Heart Association and
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in 2001–2002,
there has been an increase in the awareness of cardiovascular
disease among women.43 However, significant gender differ-
ences still exist in the management and outcomes of cardio-
vascular disease, so there is still more work that needs to be
done to optimize cardiovascular health in women.
Aside from biological sex differences in the manifestation of
ASCVD, gender plays a major role in the social, environmental,
and psychological aspects of life, influencing health expecta-
tions, healthcare-seeking behavior, and perception of health.45
Women experience an escalated demand for domestic and
caregiving responsibilities, and this is particularly prominent
among families of ethnic minorities.46 This is often associated
with psychosocial stress that is more common in women,47–50
with less time for optimal self-care, symptom neglect, poor
perception of health, lower quality of life,46 and worse health
outcomesoverall.Althoughseveralotherdeterminantsofhealth
such as level of education, race/ethnicity, and level of income
may influence health outcomes, in this current study, the
vulnerability of women to worse patient-reported outcomes
persisted even after taking these factors into consideration.
Gender differences in cardiovascular outcomes are beyond the
influenceofbiologicalandmedicalfactors,4astheyextendtothe
psychosocial and patient-centered determinants of health.
Improved recognition and understanding of these gender-
specific differences and challenges among women with ASCVD
will be vital to the improvement of women’s cardiovascular
health.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has some limitations. Since MEPS has a cross-
sectional design, we cannot establish causal mechanisms
between
gender
and
patient-reported outcomes
among
individuals with ASCVD. Since there is no standardized
definition for the components of patient experience, all the
factors that might influence these measures may not have
been accounted for. Also, since our study population includes
self-reported diagnosis of ASCVD, the risk of underestimation
of the cohort size is a possibility. The timeliness of the MEPS
may influence the responses of the participants, hence there is

 the possibility of a recall bias, although it should be minimal at
best. Also, we could not address the underlying reasons for the
gender-specific differences in patient-reported health out-
comes, which could be because of treatment differences and
referrals, indications and contraindications, patient preference,
or other medical-social factors that could contribute to
differences in health outcomes. Finally, patient-reported data
were used to identify the gender of the MEPS participants,
which was reported as either male or female; we therefore
could not account for the transgender population.
On the other hand, our study has many strengths, including
the design and execution of the MEPS with its multilevel
ascertainment of information obtained from survey partici-
pants and weighting to make our results generalizable to all
noninstitutionalized US adults living with ASCVD.
Conclusions
In conclusion, women with ASCVD were more likely to report
poorer patient experience, lower HRQoL, and poorer perception
of their health when compared with men. This has important
public health implications, given the established relationship
between positive patient experiences, HRQoL, and improved
health outcomes. Continued research towards understanding
the gender-specific differences in patient-reported matrices
may provide an opportunity to improve perception of healthcare
quality, delivery, and ultimately health outcomes among women
with ASCVD.
