ABSTRACT
Malignant mesothelioma has a poor prognosis for which there remains an urgent 
need for successful treatment approaches. Infection with the Edmonston vaccine 
strain (MV-Edm) derivative of measles virus results in lysis of cancer cells and has 
been tested in clinical trials for numerous tumor types including mesothelioma. Many 
factors play a role in MV-Edm tumor cell selectivity and cytopathic activity while also 
sparing non-cancerous cells. The MV-Edm receptor CD46 (cluster of differentiation 
46) was demonstrated to be significantly higher in mesothelioma cells than in control 
cells. In contrast, mesothelioma cells are not reliant upon the alternative MV-Edm 
receptor nectin-4 for entry. MV-Edm treatment of mesothelioma reduced cell viability 
and also invoked apoptotic cell death. Forced expression of eIF4E or translation 
stimulation following IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor 1) exposure strengthened the 
potency of measles virus oncolytic activity. It was also shown that repression of cap-
dependent translation by treatment with agents [4EASO, 4EGI-1] that suppress host 
cell translation or by forcing cells to produce an activated repressor protein diminishes 
the strength of oncolytic viral efficacy.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) arises from 
mesothelial cells in the pleura and is not curable with 
current therapies. The current standard of care for 
unresectable mesothelioma is combination chemotherapy 
of cisplatin and pemetrexed resulting in a median time 
to progression of 7 months and overall survival of 12 
months. Overall response rates to this first line systemic 
therapy is only 41% in Phase 3 trials [1]. A promising 
approach for intracavitary cancers such as mesothelioma 
and ovarian cancer is viral oncolytic therapy. Studies using 
the Edmonston strain of the measles virus (MV) have been 
carried out or are underway in these diseases [2]. Previous 
data have demonstrated marked activity of the measles 
virus in xenograft models of mesothelioma with prolonged 
survival of murine models treated with oncolytic therapy 
[3]. These studies have led to a Phase 1 trial of measles 
virus therapy in pleural mesothelioma (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier NCT01503177).
CD46, expressed in all nucleated cells, is the 
primary receptor for Edmonston vaccine strains of 
measles virus. Wild-type MV strains typically interact 
with signaling lymphocytic-activation molecule (SLAM). 
Binding of MV hemagglutinin (MV-H) with CD46 
triggers structural changes of MV-fusion protein (MV-F), 
necessary for syncytium formation, that leads to fusion 
of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane [4]. In

normal tissues CD46 is expressed at low density while it 
is often overexpressed on many cancer tissues, resulting 
in a natural tropism for cancer cells while sparing normal 
cells [5]. Recently another receptor, nectin-4, has been 
identified for MV infection. In non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) nectin-4 has been associated with a poorer 
prognosis and is expressed in 58% of NSCLC tumors [6]. 
The incidence of nectin-4 expression in mesothelioma 
is unknown. Additionally, another factor important for 
viral tropism of cancer cells are deficiencies in the innate 
antiviral response pathway in cancer cells that elevates 
permissiveness for viral replication and spread selectively 
within tumors compared to normal cells [7].
In spite of these alterations there remain differential 
responses both in vitro and in vivo depending on the tumor 
model employed. Activation of cap-mediated translation in 
general results in translation of what appears to be a limited 
yet vital cohort of proteins associated with maintenance of 
the malignant phenotype [8]. Previous studies have shown 
5’ cap-mediated translation of proteins is up-regulated 
in many or most cancers, including mesothelioma, and 
that downregulation of the eIF4F complex activity in 
mesothelioma is associated with loss of the malignant 
phenotype and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies 
[9, 10]. In addition, viral infection in non-transformed 
cells is highly associated with redirection of cap-
mediated translation away from production of proteins 
associated with host cellular maintenance and towards 
viral replication. Moreover, viruses are fully dependent 
on the host cell translation machinery to produce the 
proteins that are crucial for viral replication [11]. This is 
also likely true for viral infection of transformed cells. The 
hyper-activation of protein translation seen in the cancer 
phenotype may render transformed cells more sensitive 
to viral mediated oncolysis dependent upon the relative 
elevated levels of host cell protein synthesis.
In the current study, findings are presented 
which identify host cell cap-dependent translation as 
an important factor mediating measles virus activity 
against mesothelioma cells. Furthermore, results herein 
demonstrate that viral entry into mesothelioma cells 
is dependent upon the expression of CD46 and is 
independent of nectin-4.
RESULTS
Measles virus represses mesothelioma 
proliferation
Previous research revealed that replication-
competent measles virus strains can infect and inhibit 
growth of a wide variety of cancer types [2]. To test if 
mesothelioma cells are permissive to infection from the 
Edmonston vaccine strain (MV-Edm) of measles virus a 
panel of MM cell lines and a non-transformed cell line 
were treated with MV-GFP (green fluorescence protein 
producing measles virus) and fluorescence microscopy 
performed (Figure 1A). When compared to non-
malignant immortalized mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) there 
is an increase in cytopathic effects as viewed by syncitia 
formation (Figure 1A) in characterized mesothelioma cell 
lines. The formation of syncitia (multinuclear aggregates) 
is characteristic of MV infection and denotes an efficient 
cell-to-cell spread of MV-Edm. To investigate the 
oncolytic strength of measles virus in mesothelioma, four 
MM cell lines were treated and assessed for cell survival 
and compared to non-transformed cells (Figure 1A). 
MM cells were treated with increasing multiplicities of 
infection (MOIs) of MV-CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen 
producing measles virus) for 72 hours and cells counted. 
In conjunction with increasing MOI of MV-CEA there is a 
stepwise decrease in cell viability that is more pronounced 
in mesothelioma cells, except for H513, than LP9 or MeT-
5A cells (Figure 1B). Together these data show that at 
all MV doses cell viability is diminished substantially 
compared to untreated cells, and in three of four MM cell 
lines cell viability is decreased extensively, compared to 
non-transformed mesothelial cells. In addition, the CEA 
marker, a surrogate of viral gene expression, produced 
and secreted into the medium following cellular infection 
and replication of the measles virus, increases inversely 
with cell viability following exposure to increasing doses 
of MV-CEA (Figure 1C). To verify the MeT-5A cell line 
immunoblot analysis was employed determining that the 
SV40 large T antigen is produced. The generation of MeT-
5A started by employing healthy human mesothelial cells 
that were infected with plasmid pRSV-T (an SV40 ori - 
construct containing the SV40 early region of the Rous 
sarcoma virus long terminal repeat) that lead to creation 
of the immortalized cell line [12]. These cells, in the 
original work, produced the SV40 large T antigen, as do 
the MeT-5A cells used in the experiments presented in this 
investigation (Figure 1D).
Apoptosis is induced by measles virus in 
mesothelioma
Two markers of apoptosis were studied that include 
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and 
Annexin V staining. PARP cleavage was assessed in MM 
cells treated with MV-CEA as an indicator of apoptosis 
induction. The panel of 4 MM cell lines were either 
treated with MV-CEA (MOI of 1.0) or left untreated 
for 48 hours and lysates prepared. Immunoblot analysis 
revealed that MV-CEA treatment led to increased PARP 
cleavage denoting apoptosis as compared to untreated 
cells (Figure 2A). A consequence of apoptosis that can 
be measured by Annexin V staining is the externalization 
of phosphatidylserine. Three MM cell lines were either 
treated with MV-GFP (MOI of 1.0) or left untreated for 48 
hours and cells were subjected to Annexin V measurement

(Figure 2B). The increase in the level of Annexin 
V-positive cells was from 4.4 to 87.4% for H513 cells, 
from 2.96 to 59.9% for H2373 cells and from 2.6 to 97% 
for H2596 cells following MV-GFP treatment. Results 
from both of these different apoptosis assays demonstrate 
that measles virus is capable of invoking apoptotic cell 
death in mesothelioma cells.
CD46 levels are elevated in mesothelioma
Previous studies demonstrated that the cytopathic 
effects in tumor cells resulting from MV-Edm infection, 
is dependent upon a threshold CD46 receptor density [5]. 
The critical component of this phenomenon is that below 
the threshold CD46 density virus-induced cell-to-cell 
fusion occurs at a minimal level but above the threshold 
CD46 level cell-to-cell fusion increases dramatically 
resulting in amplified cytopathic effects. The level of 
MV-Edm receptor, CD46, in MM cells was measured 
and compared to non-transformed and non-immortalized 
(LP9) and non-transformed but immortalized (MeT-5A) 
cells (Figure 3A). The CD46 receptor level on three of 
four MM cell lines was significantly higher than in the 
LP9 control cells (Figure 3A, 3B). The level of CD46 may 
partly explain the oncolytic specificity of MV-Edm for 
MM cells displayed in Figure 1. However, based on CD46 
receptor level alone it would be expected that H513 would 
be more sensitive and H2596 less sensitive to measles 
virus than what was revealed in the cell viability studies.
MV-Edm relies on CD46 receptor and not 
nectin-4 for MM host cell entry
For both the wild-type and vaccine strains of MV, 
nectin-4 was recently identified as a receptor [13, 14]. 
To assess the relevance of nectin-4 as a receptor for MV-

micrographs (magnification 100X) acquired (A). Human MM cells, immortalized mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) and mesothelial cells (LP9)

Edm in mesothelioma infection the level of nectin-4 
was determined (Figure 3C and 3D). A panel of 4 MM 
cell lines, along with non-transformed mesothelial cells, 
was analyzed for nectin-4 expression employing flow 
cytometry. Nectin-4 was highly expressed only in H513 
cells, the MM cell line least sensitive to MV-Edm. To 
explore the reliance of MV-Edm on nectin-4 and CD46 
receptors for H513 host cell entry, cells were treated with 
blocking antibodies against nectin-4, CD46 or both. As 
a control isotype IgG antibodies were used. Following 
antibody treatment H513 cells were treated with MV-
GFP (MOI 1.0) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 
(Figure 3E). Fluorescence of treated cells was measured 
employing a plate reader (Figure 3F). The viral infection 
of H513 was not impacted by the addition of blocking 
antibodies to nectin-4. However, the blocking CD46 
antibody attenuated, nearly-completely, infection by 
MV-GFP. Blocking both receptors with antibodies also 
halted MV-GFP infection. The fluorescence measurement 
following antibody treatment corroborates these results. 
Exposure to nectin-4 blocking antibody was permissive 
for MV-GFP infection (high mean fluorescence) while 
the exposure to CD46 blocking antibody (low mean 
fluorescence) was not. These results suggest that for H513 
cells that express nectin-4, MV-GFP viral entry depends 
upon CD46 and not nectin-4. In summary, three of four

MM cell lines did not produce nectin-4 while the cell line 
that did was not reliant upon nectin-4 for viral entry but 
depends on CD46 (Figure 3C-3F).
Host cell translation inhibition suppresses 
measles virus potency
One of the primary toxic effects of oncolytic viral 
infection of cancer cells is redirection of cap-mediated 
protein translation away from necessary host cellular 
metabolism and towards viral replication. Indeed, viruses 
are potently dependent on the translation machinery 
of their host cells for viral protein production. These 
proteins are required for viral genome replication and 
progeny virion production [11]. With this in mind, down 
regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the 
rate limiting protein of the eukaryotic initiation complex 
(eIF4F) should blunt viral replication and cytotoxicity 
engendered by measles virus. To explore the impact that 
inhibition of cap-mediated translation has on the oncolytic 
activity of MV-Edm for mesothelioma, cells were treated 
with a translation inhibitor, measles virus or both agents. 
An eIF4E targeted antisense oligonucleotide (4EASO) 
previously demonstrated to diminish eIF4E protein 
levels was used to attenuate cap-mediated translation. 
A mismatch control ASO (mmASO) was employed for 
comparison [15]. mmASO had an inhibitory effect upon 
cell line H513 and this effect may be specific for this cell 
line but did not impact the viability of the other cell lines 
studied. When mesothelioma cells are transfected with 
4EASO there is an expected decrease in eIF4E protein 
levels, demonstrated with immunoblot analysis, and 
concordant decrease in cell viability when compared to 
mmASO (Figure 4A, 4B). Cell viability was not reduced in 
three of four cell lines treated with the combination of MV 
and 4EASO compared to at least one of the single agent 
treatments alone. However, for H2596 the diminishment 
between MV and the combined treatment was slight 
compared to MV-CEA alone (Figure 4A). To verify that 
the reduced cytotoxicity from inhibited host cell cap-
dependent translation is due to decreased viral production, 
CEA levels in culture medium from MV-CEA infected and 
ASO treated cells was measured. Previous work indicated 
that an increase in MV-CEA titer was directly associated 
with an increase in the CEA level in culture medium that 
correlates with viral replication and viral gene expression 
[16]. CEA marker secreted into the medium following 
MV-CEA infection of cell lines H513, H2373 and H2596 
decreased significantly with the addition of 4EASO to 
the MV-CEA infected cells (Figure 4C). This suggests 
that during inhibition of host cell translation MV-CEA 
production is reduced. These results together indicate 
that in the presence of limiting and diminished levels of 
eIF4E the mesothelioma cells are rendered less sensitive 
to oncolytic viral effects of MV-CEA.
Further, if repressing cap-mediated translation 
by reducing eIF4E levels attenuates measles virus 
cytotoxicity, then forcing mesothelioma cells to produce 
an endogenous repressor protein of eIF4E, 4E-BP1, should 
also result in a similar decreased sensitivity to measles 
virus oncolysis. Mesothelioma cells were selected to 
ectopically express a dominant active form of 4E-BP1 
with residues threonine 37 and 46 replaced with alanines 
(4E-BP1A37/A46), rendering the resulting protein insensitive 
to phosphorylation and thus constitutively active in its 
repressor function. In previous studies, mesothelioma 
cells producing 4E-BP1A37/A46 were shown to have 
strongly diminished assembly of the eIF4F cap-dependent 
translation complex compared to cells not producing 
4E-BP1A37/A46 [10]. To evaluate the ability of 4E-BP1A37/
A46 to repress measles virus cytopathic activity MM cell 
line H2596 was stably transfected with empty vector or 
with the gene for dominant active 4E-BP1A37/A46. These 
cells were then either left untreated or treated with MV-
GFP at an MOI of 0.5 (Figure 4D). Cell viability following 
MV-GFP treatment led to reduced cytotoxicity in cells 
producing dominant active 4E-BP1A37/A46 compared to 
the same cells not producing 4E-BP1A37/A46. The results 
promote the notion that host cell translation potency 
controls oncolytic MV efficacy.
Additionally, based on the results from Figure 4A 
and 4B, we next examined the combination effects of 
measles virus with 4EGI-1, a small-molecule inhibitor 
of translation initiation [17], quantitatively using Chou-
Talalay methodology [18]. With the Chou-Talalay 
approach growth effects of MV-Edm, 4EGI-1, and the 
combination of MV-Edm and 4EGI-1 were measured in 
the panel of 4 MM cell lines in a 96 well plate format. 
Analysis was performed using Compusyn software and the 
combination indices (CI) determined (Table 1). For these 
studies and by definition, synergism (CI <1) is greater than 
an additive effect (CI =1) and antagonism is lower than an 
additive effect (CI >1). The combination effects of MV-
CEA and 4EGI-1 for the 4 MM cell lines determined for 
the six different agent combinations per cell line yielded 
CI values indicating from slight to strong antagonism (C 
> 1) (Table 1). The average CI for the 6 different drug 
combinations for cell line H2373 was slightly antagonistic 
(1.12), for H2596 was moderately antagonistic (1.31), for 
H2461 was antagonistic (2.18) and for H513 was strongly 
antagonistic (8.31) [18]. These results, for each cell line 
indicating antagonism, also suggest that the strength of 
viral oncolysis is dependent upon active protein synthesis.
Measles virus activity is enhanced by stimulation 
of host cell translation
Results from three different methods to attenuate 
cap-mediated translation that lead to suppressed oncolytic 
activity of MV-Edm in mesothelioma were just revealed. 
To examine the role that enhanced protein translation has 
on the potency of MV oncolytic activity, two different 
approaches to stimulate cap-mediated translation were 
employed. Previous studies demonstrated that IGF-I

stimulation of mesothelioma cells directly promotes 
activation of the eIF4F complex and thereby triggers 
enhanced cap-dependent translation [10]. To assess the 
impact that IGF-I stimulation has on the activation of 
MV oncolysis, three MM cell lines were left untreated or 
treated with IGF-I (5 nM), MV-GFP (MOI 0.1) or treated 
with both agents (Figure 5A) and cell viability measured 
24 hours later. In all cell lines the cell viability was 
significantly reduced to a greater extent in the presence of 
IGF-I when treated with MV-GFP than in cells treated with 
MV-GFP but in the absence of IGF-I. The added efficacy 
of MV was likely due to elevated host cell translation 
machinery for progeny virion production, engendered by 
IGF-I stimulation.
In most examples the oncogenic potential of 
deranged eIF4F hyperactivity is connected to eIF4E 
activity, which is the rate-limiting element of the 
translation initiation complex [19, 20]. Moreover, in NIH-

of eIF4GI and eIF4E in the cap-affinity assay by 1.52 and 
1.81 fold, respectively, compared to cells lacking meIF4E. 
These results indicate elevated cap-meditated translation 
for MeT-5A producing ectopic meIF4E. MeT-5A cells 
either producing or not producing meIF4E was then 
treated with MV-CEA at the indicated MOI and assayed 
for cell viability 72 hours later. MeT-5A cells expressing 
ectopic meIF4E were significantly more sensitive to MV-
Edm than cells not producing ectopic meIF4E at each 
MOI employed (Figure 5B). In order to confirm that the 
improved cytotoxicity from stimulated host cell cap-
dependent translation is due to increased viral production, 
CEA levels in culture medium from cells producing 
and not producing meIF4E was measured. CEA marker 
emitted into the medium following MV-CEA infection 
of MeT-5A cells expressing ectopic meIF4E increased 
significantly compared to MV-CEA infected MeT-5A 
cells not expressing meIF4E (Figure 5D). This indicates 
that during stimulation of host cell translation MV-CEA 
replication is enhanced. Together, these data show that 
cells with hyperactivated cap-mediated translation induces 
enhanced oncolytic measles virus activity.
DISCUSSION
The attenuated Edmonston vaccine strain of 
measles virus (MV-Edm) has become one of the 
promising replicating oncolytic viruses that are capable 
of infecting and killing tumor cells by proliferating in 
cancer tissues thereby magnifying their antineoplastic 
impact [2]. A number of factors control the proficiency 
of a virus to infect a cell. A mixture of permissiveness 
(viral replication) and susceptibility (viral entry) governs 
viral tropism for a host cell and is necessary for a virus 
to establish infection. MV-Edm oncolytic specificity has 
been shown to rely on the differential expression of the 
CD46 receptor [5], defects in the type I IFN response [22] 
and defects in antiviral innate immune response [23, 24]. 
In the present study, and in earlier investigations [22, 25], 
the CD46 receptor has revealed to be highly expressed 
in mesothelioma cells, and thus explains a large part 
of the susceptibility of infection. In the work presented 
here mesothelioma cells were shown not to be reliant on 
nectin-4 for viral entry. Most human malignancies exhibit 
increased levels of CD46 protein, and overexpression of 
regulatory membrane complement cofactor protein CD46 
can assist in evading complement lytic activity for cancer 
cells [26]. While the elevated levels of CD46 can enhance 
the malignant phenotype in cancer it also engenders 
the tumor cells more sensitive to infection by MV-Edm 
potentiating cell killing.
A basic function following viral infection remains 
redirection of normal cellular metabolism towards 
processes favoring viral replication. For wild-type 
HL strain of MV it is suggested that the MV-N protein 
shuts off host translation in MV-infected cells through 
protein-protein interactions with host cell eukaryotic 
initiation factor 3 (eIF3) [27]. It is believed that this same 
procedure works for MV-Edm strain. This mechanism 
for viral permissiveness is critical and functions through 
subversion of cap-mediated translation towards production 
of critical viral proteins. This may be particularly 
important in cancer cells where often the activation of the 
eIF4F complex is associated with production of critical 
proteins needed for both maintaining the malignant 
phenotype and blocking apoptosis.
Although eukaryotic translation is mediated through 
both cap-mediated mechanisms as well as IRES, the 
default translational complex in most cancer cells appears 
to be eIF4F directed [28]. Based on the current results, 
the permissiveness of mesothelioma cells to oncolytic 
viral therapy appears to depend in a large part to ongoing 
presence of hyperactivation of cap-mediated translation. In 
the studies presented here, the stimulation of cap-mediated 
translation by either IGF-I exposure or forced expression 
of eIF4E induced enhanced measles virus oncolytic 
activity. And the opposite is true as well. Repression 
of cap-dependent translation by forcing mesothelioma 
cells to produce an activated repressor protein or with 
the treatment of mesothelioma with agents [4EASO, 
4EGI-1] that suppress host cell translation decreases the 
potency of oncolytic viral efficacy. This argues strongly 
that transformed mesothelial cells will be preferentially 
susceptible to viral oncolysis imparting selectivity 
towards the malignant phenotype for this therapy. This is 
particularly important in view of the deleterious effects of 
infection of normal host cells by wild-type MV.
In addition, selectivity for measles viral therapy in 
mesothelioma is likely mediated through over-expression 
of the CD46 receptor protein when compared to non-
transformed mesothelial cells. Although the vast majority 
of the population is immunized to measles, there remains 
a benefit to developing a viral therapy that demonstrates 
selectivity towards cancer cells over non-transformed 
host cells. In this regards, both the preferential expression 
of the CD46 receptor and activation of the eIF4F 
complex in mesothelioma cells are important in defining 
measles virotherapy as a safe and targeted treatment in 
mesothelioma. In ovarian cancer, like mesothelioma, 
the CD46 receptor is also over-expressed [29] and cap-
mediated translation is aberrantly stimulated [8]. Given 
these attributes a phase I/II trial of MV-Edm in patients 
with recurrent ovarian cancer was launched. In this 
study intraperitoneal treatment was well tolerated and 
correlated with favorable overall survival. [30]. The 
result of a Phase 1 trial of measles virus therapy in pleural 
mesothelioma has not finalized but looks promising as 
well (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01503177).
A number of targeted cancer treatments in both 
clinical use and development target pathways that 
impact protein translation through mTOR inhibition [8]. 
It is important to note that a primary target of mTOR is 
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
activation of protein translation via phosphorylation and 
consequent deactivation of the 4EBP1 repressor protein. 
It is reasonable to view with caution combining viral 
oncolytic therapies with treatments that target mTOR or 
the eIF4F complex. Based on the findings in the current 
study, it would be expected that such a strategy would not 
be additive in its cytotoxicity but more likely antagonistic.
Mesothelioma remains a lethal cancer with few 
effective therapies. Given the intracavitary nature of 
the disease and high expression of CD46, measles 
therapy remains an interesting and promising approach. 
A primary characteristic of mesothelioma cells, and of 
most transformed cells, remains the activation of eIF4F-
mediated translation. It is apparent that this phenotype 
renders mesothelioma susceptible to this oncolytic therapy 
and deserving of continued clinical development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, cell culture and viruses
The medium for MM cell lines, H513, H2373, 
H2461 and H2596 (American Tissue Culture Collection 
(ATCC), Manassas, VA) was RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life 
Technologies, Waltham, MA) containing 10% newborn 
calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). LP9 cells, 
non-transformed human mesothelial cells (Coriell Institute 
for Medical Research, Camden, NJ), were propagated in 
a medium containing a 1:1 ratio of M199 and MCDB10 
basal medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 
15% newborn calf serum [not heat inactivated], 2 mM 
glutamine, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
and 0.4 μg/mL hydrocortisone. MeT-5A (ATCC) cells 
(non-transformed, SV40 immortalized mesothelial cells) 
were grown in M199 containing Earle's BSS, 0.75 mM 
L-glutamine, 1.25 g/L sodium bicarbonate supplemented 
with 3.3 nM EGF, 400 nM hydrocortisone, 870 nM insulin, 
20 mM HEPES, trace elements and 10% calf serum. All 
cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. The authenticity 
of these cell lines were verified by short tandem repeat 
analysis (Johns Hopkins Cell Authentication Facility).
Recombinant MV-Edmonston vaccine strain (MV-
Edm) bearing the gene that encodes green fluorescent 
protein (MV-GFP) or encoding the gene for the soluble 
extracellular domain of human CEA (carcinoembryonic 
antigen) (MV-CEA) were constructed and propagated as 
described previously [31]. The titer of viral stocks was 
determined by 50% end-point dilution assays [(TCID50)/
mL] performed on Vero cells [32].
Cell lysate preparation
The cells were removed from the plates by scraping 
after washing once with PBS (phosphate buffered 
saline), after which cells were collected by centrifugation 
(14K rpm, 14 seconds), washed again with ice cold 
PBS followed by another round of centrifugation and 
resuspended in a volume of TNESV lysis buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1 % NP-40; 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.1 
M NaCl) containing protease (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) 
and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). In instances 
that cell lysates were used for cap-affinity assays, cells 
were resuspended in a volume of freeze-thaw lysis 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM 
NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate) 
containing the same protease and phosphatase inhibitors 
followed by three freeze-thaw cycles (15 min at −80°C, 
2 minutes at 37°C). Protein lysate concentration was 
determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) 
and stored at −80°C.
Cell transfection
MeT-5A, SV40 immortalized mesothelial cells, 
were transfected with previously described [33] pMSCV-
M1GR1 constructs, either encoding or not encoding 
HA-tagged translational regulator eIF4E from mouse 
(meIF4E), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, 
Waltham, MA) following manufacturer’s instruction. 
GFP-positive cells were sorted at 488 nm laser emission 
on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) DiVA (BD 
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with a 530/528 optical 
filter followed by immunoblot analysis of collected cells to 
assess expression of HA-tagged meIF4E protein.
Cell line H2596 was transfected with pACTAG-2 
(empty vector) or pACTAG neo/HA-4EBP1A37/A46 to 
generate cell lines H2596 empty vector and H2596 
4EBP1A37/A46 utilizing G418 (Media Tech Inc., Manassas, 
VA, catalog number 30234CR) (neo gene) resistance as 
described [10].
In vitro cap-affinity assay
The strength of cap-mediated complex formation 
was measured as before [10]. Lysate (300 μg) from MeT-
5A cells that either do or do not produce exongeneous 
HA-tagged mouse eIF4E were diluted in 300 μL freeze-
thaw lysis buffer and combined with 50 μl of a 50% 
slurry of 7-methyl GTP-SepharoseTM4B (Amersham 
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and incubated while mixing 
for two hours at 4°C. Freeze-thaw lysis buffer containing 
100 μM 7-methylguanosine 5’-triphosphate (Sigma-
Aldrich) was employed, along with heating at 95°C for 5 
minutes, to elute the captured binding partners, eIF4E and 
eIF4GI from the 7-methyl GTP-SepharoseTM4B beads. 
The eluted samples were then prepared for immunoblot 
analysis. The density of protein bands was determined 
by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, 
MD), a public domain Java image processing program. 
The protein bands for eIF4E and eIF4GI were normalized 
to their respective densities found in the MeT-5A empty 
vector sample.

Immunoblot analysis
Protein samples for the cap-affinity assay were 
separated by 8-15% gradient SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis). Ten or twelve percent SDS-PAGE 
was used for PARP and eIF4E proteins, respectively. 
Following protein transfer to PVDF (Amersham 
Biosciences) the membranes were blocked in 5% non-
fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature in Tris-
buffered saline-Tween (TBST: 0.15 M NaCl; 0.01 M 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes 
were then incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature 
or overnight at 4° C with the chosen primary antibody. 
The primary antibodies employed were rabbit α-eIF4E 
(catalog number 9742), rabbit α-PARP (catalog number 
9542), α-SV40 large T antigen (catalog number 15729) 
all from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) at a 
1:1000 dilution, mouse α-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog 
number A1978) at a 1:10,000 dilution and rabbit α-eIF4GI 
(kindly provided by Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University 
Montreal, QC, Canada) at a 1:2500 dilution. Preceding 
and following incubation with the appropriate horseradish 
peroxidase labeled secondary antibodies, the blots were 
washed three times for 5 minutes in TBST and detection 
was then performed utilizing ECL Plus Western Blotting 
System (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the bands 
of interest.
Viral infection alone and combined with drug 
treatment
For the results in Figure 1A, each cell line 
was seeded in 6 well plates at 1 x 105 cells per well, 
incubated overnight and treated or not treated with MV-
GFP at an MOI of 1.0. At 48 hours after infection cells 
were photographed employing light and fluorescence 
microscopy. For the results in Figure 1B and 1C, MeT-5A 
and MM cells were seeded at 1 x 105 cells per well in 6 
well plates. Following overnight incubation the cells were 
washed with Opti-MEM (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 
then infected with MV-CEA at different multiplicities of 
infection (MOI) in 0.4 mL of Opti-MEM for 2 h at 37 °C. 
Complete medium for each cell line was then added to the 
wells for the duration of the treatment.
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) (ABR Affinity 
Bioreagents, Golden, CO), stimulation (5 nM) was 
carried out on 1 x 105 cells per well following overnight 
incubation. After overnight IGF-I stimulation cells were 
treated or not treated with MV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. 
Subsequent to the MV-GFP infection, IGF-I at 5 nM was 
maintained in the appropriate wells. At 24 hours after 
infection cells were counted.
Second-generation 
antisense 
oligonucleotides 
(ASOs), containing a phosphorothioate backbone, 
were provided by Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, 
Indiana) and were 20 nucleotides in length [34]. 4EASO 
has the sequence, 5’-TGTCATATTCCTGGATCCTT-3’, 
where the underlined nucleotides are 2’-methoxyethyl-
modified (MOE). It was designed to target the 3’ 
untranslated region of human eIF4E mRNA. The 
mismatch ASO (mmASO) control has the sequence 
5’-TCTTATGTTTCCGAACCGTT-3’ containing the same 
base composition as 4EASO. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, 
Life Technologies) was employed for ASO transfection 
as described previously [15]. Following ASO transfection 
cells were then infected or not infected with MV-CEA as 
described above with subsequent cell harvest at 48 hours 
or counted at 72 hours at the indicated MOIs. All cells 
for proliferation studies were counted by trypan blue 
exclusion employing a hemacytometer. Cell survival is 
expressed as cell number normalized to untreated cells. 
Experiments were performed in triplicate.
For 
experiments 
employed 
to 
determine 
combination indices (CI), 5000 cells per well were seeded 
in the presence of 1% serum in each well of 96-well plates. 
Following overnight incubation, the cells were either left 
untreated or treated with the indicated MOI of MV-CEA 
for 2 hours. The cells were then treated with 4EGI-1 
(ChemBridge, San Diego, CA, ID:5154300) at the desired 
concentrations and medium was added to produce a final 
serum concentration of 10%. The cells were next incubated 
at 37°C for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by using 
Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, 
Rockville, MD). Experiments were performed in triplicate 
and cell viability values normalized to untreated cells. 
The degree of cooperation between 4EGI-1 and MV-CEA 
subsequent to treatment was determined using the Chou-
Talalay method employing CompuSyn software. The 
resulting combination index (CI) quantitatively depicts 
synergism (CI<1), additive effect (CI=1) and antagonism 
(CI>1) [18].
CEA level determination
MeT5-A and MM cells were treated with the 
indicated MOI of MV-CEA. Seventy-two hours later 
cell medium was collected from infected and uninfected 
cells and analyzed for CEA concentration. The CEA 
levels were measured using CEA ELISA kit (Bio-
Quant, Inc., San Diego, CA) following manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Annexin V measurement
Phosphatidylserine externalization was determined 
as an indicator of apoptosis utilizing Guava Nexin Reagent 
and the Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (EMD Millipore, 
Guava Technologies, Billerica, MA). Cells (1 x 105 per 
well) were infected or not infected with MV-GFP at an 
MOI of 1.0 as outlined above in six well plates for 48 
hours. The Guava Nexin reagent was added to harvested 
cells and incubated in the dark for 20 minutes at room 
 Oncotarget

temperature. Samples were analyzed using flow cytometry 
per manufacture’s recommendation. Results are expressed 
as the percentage of gated cells that are positive for 
Annexin V staining. A total of 5000 events were analyzed 
per sample.
Assessment of CD46 and nectin-4 levels
Cells were grown to ~70-80% confluency, harvested, 
washed in 1X PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin 
(PBS-BSA), centrifuged and resuspended in PBS-BSA. 
Cells were then incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C with 
phycoerythrin (PE) CD46 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge 
Science Park, Cambridge, UK), anti-nectin-4-PE (R & D 
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, catalog number FAB2659) 
or control isotype-matched antibodies (Invitrogen, Life 
Technologies), centrifuged and resuspended in PBS-
BSA. Cells were analyzed for CD46 or nectin-4 level on 
a Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ) FACSCalibur 
cytometer. Analysis was done using FlowJo (Ashland, 
OR) software.
Blocking antibodies against CD46 and nectin-4
H513 cells (1 x 104 per well) were seeded onto 
96-well plates in Opti-MEM. The following day cells 
were treated with isotype IgG (R & D Systems, catalog 
number AB-108-C), or nectin-4 IgG (R & D Systems, 
catalog number AF2659) or CD46 IgG (Santa Cruz, 
Dallas TX, catalog number sc-5267-clone m177) 
or both CD46 and nectin-4 antibodies. All antibody 
concentrations are 100 μg/mL. One hour following 
antibody additions, MV-GFP was added to the wells at 
an MOI of 1.0. After an infection of 2 hours, complete 
medium was added to the cells. 48 hours later cells 
were analyzed by fluorescence and light microscopy. 
In parallel, fluorescence of triplicate sets of treated 
cells was measured employing a 96-well plate reader. 
Untreated and MV-GFP infected cells without blocking 
antibodies were used as negative and positive controls, 
respectively.
