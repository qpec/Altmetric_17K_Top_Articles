IMPORTANCE The diagnostic properties of a graded provocation challenge (PC) among
children presenting with a rash in the course of amoxicillin treatment are currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy and the negative predictive value of the PC in a cohort of
children referred with suspected allergy to amoxicillin.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2012,
and April 1, 2015, at the allergy clinic of the Montreal Children’
s Hospital, Montreal, Quebec,
Canada. All children referred with suspected allergy to amoxicillin were approached. In
addition, 346 eligible children were followed up to assess reactions to subsequent use of
amoxicillin at the time of illness in cases with negative PC results. Data were collected on
clinical characteristics, suspected antibiotic exposure, personal and first-degree relatives’
comorbidities, and history of atopy and management of the reaction. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regressions were compared to determine factors associated with
immediate and nonimmediate reactions to the PC.
INTERVENTIONS All children had a graded PC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reactions to the graded PC, the negative predictive value
of the PC for nonimmediate reactions, and factors associated with immediate and
nonimmediate reactions to the PC.
RESULTS A total of 818 children were assessed (median age, 1.7 years [interquartile range,
1.0-3.9 years]; 441 [53.9%] male). Among all participants, 770 (94.1%) tolerated the PC,
17 (2.1%) developed mild immediate reactions, and 31 (3.8%) developed nonimmediate
reactions. The graded PC had a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI, 90.9%-100.0%), a negative
predictive value of 89.1% (95% CI, 77.1%-95.5%), and a positive predictive value of 100.0%
(95% CI, 86.3%-100.0%). Among all 346 participants eligible for annual follow-up, 250
(72.3%; 95% CI, 67.2%-76.8%) responded, 55 of whom received subsequent full treatment
with amoxicillin; 49 of these 55 participants (89.1%) reported tolerance to subsequent full
treatment with amoxicillin, while 6 (10.9%) developed nonimmediate cutaneous reactions.
History of a reaction occurring within 5 minutes of exposure was associated with immediate
reactions to the PC (adjusted odds ratio = 9.6; 95% CI, 1.5-64.0), while a rash that lasted
longer than 7 days (adjusted odds ratio = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4-16.4) and parental history of drug
allergy (adjusted odds ratio = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.8) were associated with nonimmediate
reactions to the PC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Graded PCs provide an accurate and safe confirmatory test
for skin-related reactions to amoxicillin. Further studies are required to assess factors
associated with the PC outcome groups.

R
espiratory tract infections, in particular acute otitis me-
dia (AOM), are some of the most frequent infections for
which pediatric patients seek medical treatment
(15.8 ± 1.5 million clinical encounters for AOM in the United
States during 2006-2008).1 This is associated with signifi-
cant financial and sociological burden in North America. Dur-
ing the past decade, guidelines have been developed that rec-
ommend observation in lieu of antibiotic use for patients with
AOM under select circumstances. Despite this, recent studies
in the United States indicate that 83.1% ± 2.2% of children with
a diagnosis of AOM received an antibiotic prescription, mostly
amoxicillin (40.9%).1 Up to 10% of children develop rashes
while receiving antibiotics.2 Most are diagnosed without fur-
ther evaluation as allergic to the implicated antibiotic,3 and
most continue to avoid the suspect antibiotic in favor of alter-
natives, which may be less effective, more toxic, and more
expensive.
Antibiotic allergies are an immunologically mediated re-
sponse to a pharmaceutical in a sensitized person and are me-
diated by IgE, IgG, or T lymphocytes.4 Immediate reactions are
usually induced by an IgE-mediated mechanism and occur
within the first hour following drug administration.5,6 These
reactions usually appear as urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis,
bronchospasm,oranaphylaxis(ie,involvementof≥2organsys-
tems and/or hypotension).7 Nonimmediate reactions de-
velop at least 1 hour after drug administration and are often
induced by a T-lymphocyte–dependent reaction. They typi-
cally manifest as a macular or papular rash.8-10 Less common
but more severe entities of nonimmediate reactions include
serum sickness, acute generalized exanthematous pustulo-
sis, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.11,12
The relative proportion of established immediate and non-
immediate reactions among children presenting with a rash in
the course of amoxicillin treatment is currently unknown. The
clinical characteristics and demographic predictors of these re-
actions are also unclear, and it is not established whether cur-
rently standardized skin tests (ie, PRE-PEN [benzylpenicil-
loyl polylysine injection]) can contribute to the diagnosis of
amoxicillin allergy.
Currently, the diagnosis of drug allergy is based on the
collaboration of clinical history and confirmatory tests
including in vivo tests (skin tests), in vitro tests (specific IgE
levels and basophil activation tests), and antigen challenge
tests.13 For many antibiotics (including amoxicillin), such
tests are not validated, have a high false-negative rate, or
are simply not available.14,15 For nonimmediate reactions
including macular or papular rashes and serum sickness–like
reactions (SSLRs; defined when there is skin and joint
involvement),16 skin tests are even less useful given the high
false-negative or false-positive results.13,15 Confirmation or
exclusion of the diagnosis of drug allergy often depends on
drug challenge, which is considered the gold standard.15,17
However, studies suggest that some of these reactions may
be attributed to an interaction between the antibiotic and a
pathogen.8-10 To our knowledge, there are currently no stud-
ies in which all children presenting with a rash during
amoxicillin treatment have been assessed through a provo-
cation challenge (PC) and prospectively followed up to
assess future treatment.
In 2012, our team initiated a registry aiming to assess the
accuracy of a graded PC for the diagnosis of immediate and
nonimmediate allergic reactions in all children referred with
suspected amoxicillin allergy. In addition, we followed this co-
hort up to 3 years to assess future use of amoxicillin and the
development of allergic reaction on subsequent use in those
with a negative graded PC result.
Methods
Setting
All consecutive children referred to the allergy clinic of the
Montreal Children’
s Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with
suspected allergy to amoxicillin were approached. Exclusion
criteria were any reactions compatible with either Stevens-
Johnsonsyndromeortoxicepidermalnecrolysis.Patientswith
a history compatible with anaphylaxis were not excluded.
Design
Thisobservationalstudyfeaturesaretrospectivearmandapro-
spective arm. We characterized the suspected reactions to an-
tibiotics retrospectively and investigated PC outcomes and fu-
ture use of amoxicillin prospectively. We used the Standards
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guidelines to
assess the properties of the graded PC. The study was ap-
proved by the McGill Research Ethics Board. All participants
provided written informed consent.
Sources of Data
After parents consented, a standardized questionnaire (vali-
dated previously with a pilot of 40 patients and their parents)
was completed by a trained member of our team and the fam-
ily on the clinical characteristics, comorbidities (including his-
tory of atopy and use of medications regularly and during the
suspected reaction), suspected antibiotic exposure, and man-
agement of the reaction. All children were offered a graded PC
(10% of the therapeutic dose of amoxicillin, then 20 minutes
later 90% of the therapeutic dose, ie, 50 mg/kg/dose to a maxi-
mum of 1.5 g). Children were observed for at least 1 hour after
receiving their last dose.
Key Points
Question How accurate is a graded provocation challenge in
children referred with suspected allergy to amoxicillin?
Findings In this cohort study, the graded PC had a specificity of
100.0%, a negative predictive value of 89.1%, and a positive
predictive value of 100.0%. History of a reaction occurring within
5 minutes of exposure was associated with immediate reactions to
the PC, while a rash that lasted longer than 7 days and parental
history of drug allergy were associated with nonimmediate
reactions to the PC.
Meaning The graded PC provides an accurate and safe
confirmatory test for skin-related reactions to amoxicillin.

The dose range for the PC was 550 to 1500 mg of amoxi-
cillindependingonthechild’
sweight.Familiesofchildrenwith
negative PC results were given a study email address and tele-
phone contact to report any adverse reaction in the following
week or on subsequent treatment.
In cases of positive immediate reactions, skin prick tests
and intradermal tests with benzylpenicillin (10 000 U/mL in
skinpricktest;1000U/mLinintradermaltest;and10 000U/mL
in parallel) and PRE-PEN (0.04 mg/mL) were conducted 2 to
3monthslateraccordingtopreviouslypublishedprotocols.14,18
In addition, trained members of our team contacted families
annually for 3 years to assess amoxicillin use and develop-
ment of future reactions. Given the poor predictive values of
skin tests for the diagnosis of nonimmediate reactions and the
lack of standardized available intradermal tests for amoxicil-
lin itself, neither was used in this study.
The diagnosis of immediate antibiotic allergy was made
only in those with a positive PC result within 1 hour of the PC’
s
last dose; this was defined as the occurrence only of objective
symptoms, including urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, rhini-
tis,vomiting,diarrhea,protractedabdominalpain,orshock.14,15
A single episode of vomiting was not considered a positive re-
action, while severe and repetitive vomiting was classified as
positive. Nonimmediate reactions were defined as parents’re-
port of nonimmediate objective symptoms (as defined ear-
lier) as well as the presence of arthritis or arthralgia at least 1
hour after the PC and up to 1 week afterward. Reactions to the
PC were classified as mild when symptoms were limited to the
oral mucosa or the skin; severe reactions included cardiovas-
cular or respiratory symptoms or involvement of any 4 sys-
tems; and all other reactions were classified as moderate.19 All
participantswithimmediateandnonimmediatereactionswere
invited for reassessment in the allergy clinic, and a PC with a
third-generation oral cephalosporin (cefixime) was offered
(10% and then 90% of the therapeutic dose, ie, 8 mg/kg fol-
lowed by 1 hour of observation).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical character-
istics of reactions were calculated using 95% confidence in-
tervals. To assess the percentage and 95% confidence inter-
val for the different groups defined by the graded PC, a
multinomial distribution was used for inferences. Univariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses were compared
to assess potential confounders and evaluate the effects of so-
ciodemographic predictors (including age and sex), presence
of comorbidities (eg, atopic diseases, use of other medica-
tions such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acet-
aminophen during the reaction and on a daily basis), family
history of drug allergy and atopy in first-degree relatives, and
clinicalcharacteristicsofthereaction(timebetweeninitialsus-
pected reaction and challenge, whether this was the first ex-
posure, and clinical symptoms of the suspected reaction, ie,
type of rash, presence of arthritis or arthralgia or of symp-
tomsinvolvingtherespiratory,digestive,orcardiovascularsys-
tem) on immediate and nonimmediate reactions to the PC. All
statistical analyses were conducted using R version 2.12.0 sta-
tistical software (R Foundation).
Results
Between March 1, 2012, and April 1, 2015, 818 participants who
were referred with a suspected reaction to amoxicillin con-
sented to an amoxicillin PC (1 patient refused). The median age
was1.7years(interquartilerange,1.0-3.9years)and441(53.9%)
were male. We identified 3 groups of PC outcomes: (1) toler-
ant to the PC; (2) immediate reaction to the PC (<1 hour); and
(3) nonimmediate reaction to the PC (>1 hour) (Figure 1). The
3 groups were comparable regarding sociodemographic char-
acteristics (the majority were male) (Table 1) and most clini-
cal characteristics of the alleged reactions and comorbidities
(Table 1 and Figure 2). However, a rash lasting longer than 7

days and parental history of drug allergy were more preva-
lent in children with nonimmediate reactions, and a history
of reaction occurring within 5 minutes was more common in
children with immediate reactions to the PC (Table 1).
Among 818 children who underwent the PC, 770 (94.1%)
tolerated the PC. Seventeen patients (2.1%) reacted immedi-
ately. Immediate reactions were all mild and consisted of
hives only. All resolved within a few hours after treatment
with second-generation antihistamines. Among the 17
patients with immediate reaction, 5 reacted within 20 min-

penicillin and PRE-PEN tests 2 to 3 months later were posi-
tive in only 1 child (5.9%) who had an immediate oral amoxi-
cillin PC reaction. The third group consisted of 31 children
(3.8%) who had nonimmediate reactions to the PC. Reac-
tions were all mild and varied from a macular or papular rash
with angioedema to an SSLR (Figure 3). The median time
between the PC and development of nonimmediate reac-
tions was 12 hours (interquartile range, 5.0-36.0 hours) and 9
of the 31 children with nonimmediate reactions (29.0%; 95%
CI, 14.9%-48.2%) reacted more than 24 hours after the PC.
Thus, the graded PC detected reactions developing hours to
days after initiation of treatment. According to the reaction
severity classification by Perry et al,19 all reactions to the PC
were mild with hives or a macular or papular rash.
We found no significant predictors in those who had im-
mediate reactions apart from reaction occurring within 5 min-
utes of exposure (adjusted odds ratio = 9.6; 95% CI, 1.5-
64.0). However, the wide confidence interval precludes
definitive conclusion on this effect. Our analysis revealed
higher odds for nonimmediate PC reaction in those who re-
ported a rash that lasted longer than 7 days (adjusted odds ra-
tio = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4-16.4) when controlling for age, sex, per-
sonal and first-degree relatives’comorbidities, and history of
atopy. In addition, parental history of drug allergy was asso-
ciated with increased odds of nonimmediate reaction to the
PC (adjusted odds ratio = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.8).
To address the potential for misclassification bias in our
sample,346patientswereeligibleforannualfollow-upviatele-
phone call. Among them, 250 (72.3%; 95% CI, 67.2%-76.8%)
responded, 55 of whom received subsequent full treatment
with amoxicillin; 49 of these 55 patients (89.1%) reported that
they tolerated subsequent full treatment with amoxicillin and
6 (10.9%) developed delayed reaction localized to the skin,
identical to initial reactions (Table 2).
The graded PC had a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI, 90.9%-
100.0%), a negative predictive value of 89.1% (95% CI, 77.1%-
95.5%), and a positive predictive value of 100.0% (95% CI,
86.3%-100.0%).
All patients with immediate and nonimmediate reac-
tions to the PC with amoxicillin tolerated a subsequent PC with
cefixime.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to assess the use of
a graded oral PC in all children presenting with rash due to sus-
pected amoxicillin allergy. We demonstrate that in this popu-
lation, history and currently standardized skin tests are less
useful in predicting amoxicillin allergy. We show that a PC is a
useful and safe way to assess these children, including those
presenting with SSLRs, and that cefixime may serve as a safe
alternative for those who do have reactions.
Our unique study design incorporated an annual fol-
low-up of our cohort and hence we were able to show that in
addition to the 3.8% who reacted nonimmediately to the PC,
10.9% among those who have used amoxicillin for a full course
again had nonimmediate rashes. Given that all those who re-
acted to the PC are considered true reactors and that in fol-
low-up only 6 children had reactions among 55 who were tol-
erant of the PC and subsequently administered full treatment
for a suspected bacterial infection (mainly AOM), our find-
ings establish a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI, 90.9%-
100.0%), a negative predictive value of 89.1% (95% CI, 77.1%-
95.5%), and a positive predictive value of 100.0% (95% CI,

the percentage of false-negative results for our sample and
hence we were not able to estimate sensitivity. Although al-
most a third of nonimmediate reactions occurred more than
24 hours after the PC, it is possible that had we used a PC over
a longer interval (5-14 days) for all cases we would have been
able to identify an additional percentage of reactors. How-
ever,itisalsolikelythatreactorswouldhaveexperiencedmore
substantial reactions. Further, it is possible that some of the
reactions, as previously suggested in the literature,1,2 require
an interaction between an infectious agent and the drug and
thus would not be captured even with more prolonged PCs.
Amoxicillin allergy is overdiagnosed in children and can
only rarely be reproduced by skin testing and/or PC. Our re-
sults confirm that the vast majority of children suspected to
have amoxicillin allergy are tolerant to amoxicillin. Although
others have reported that amoxicillin allergy is overdiag-
nosed, no studies to our knowledge have assessed all chil-
dren with a graded PC. Our results are consistent with previ-
ously published reports20-22 suggesting that fewer than 10%
of rashes occurring while an individual is receiving β-lactam
treatment are allergic in nature. Zambonino et al22 found that
1.15% of children reacted immediately and 6.77% reacted late;
however, not all of these were determined by a PC. Macy and
Ngor23 found that fewer than 5% of those assessed for a sus-
pected allergy to penicillin by an oral amoxicillin PC featur-
ing a therapeutic dose had IgE-mediated reactions. Similar to
previous studies assessing PC in those with amoxicillin
allergy,20noneofthereactionstothePCweremoreseverethan

The larger proportion of nonimmediate reactions noted in
our study may be due to the difference in catchment popula-
tion (adults vs pediatrics) or because we administered the PC
toallparticipantsregardlessofhistory.Inaddition,studiessug-
gest that amoxicillin rash may develop due to the interaction
with certain viral infections.1,2 Hence, our study that follows
futureuseofamoxicillinduringsubsequentinfectionhaslikely
captured amoxicillin-related hypersensitivity reactions that
would have been missed in other circumstances.
Similar to other studies,24,25 our findings support the safe
use of oral PCs in cases of SSLR. However, in contrast to pre-
vious studies, ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to ex-
emplify the usefulness of the graded PC in these cases. Se-
rum sickness–like reactions are characterized by fever, rash,
and joint involvement. The pathogenesis is not known but is
not associated with circulating immune complexes, hypo-
complementemia, or vasculitis.24,26 In contrast with true se-
rum sickness, renal and hepatic involvement is rare. The most
frequent finding is of erythema and urticarial lesions that are
often migratory. In the series reported by Hebert et al,27 many
oftheurticarialwhealshadduskytopurplecenters,whichwere

primaryclinicalfeatureisjointinvolvementincludingpainand
swelling.AhallmarkofSSLRisthebenignoutcome.27Themost
common cause of SSLR was reported to be cefaclor.28 How-
ever, with decreased use of cefaclor, recent reports suggest
amoxicillin as a principal trigger.29 Our results clearly dem-
onstrate that a graded PC is an appropriate diagnostic test in
children with SSLR to amoxicillin.
To our knowledge, there are no currently published posi-
tive predictive values for skin tests in the diagnosis of immedi-
ateandnonimmediatereactionstoamoxicillin.Ourresultsshow
that currently used standardized tests (PRE-PEN) are not use-
ful for the diagnosis of immediate reactors in PC. In fact, this
test was negative in 94.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-99.7%) of immedi-
ate reactions. Further, a graded PC was safe in both immediate
and nonimmediate reactors. Given the high percentage of chil-
dren tolerating the PC, it is likely that most immediate or non-
immediate rash reactions in the context of amoxicillin treat-
ment are related to viral infections.20,30,31 The rash may be
caused by a direct viral effect or through interaction between
the virus and the immune system that triggers a reaction to the
drug, as our results in the subgroup followed up and receiving
full treatment suggest.11,32,33 Although allergic drug reactions
have been considered to be immediate (IgE mediated) or non-
immediate(T-lymphocyteeffectormechanisms),acceleratedre-
actions have also been defined (within 2-6 hours after
exposure).34 Studies suggest that T lymphocytes are impli-
cated not only in nonimmediate reactions but also in immedi-
ate and accelerated reactions.35 The latter may account for the
poor sensitivity of skin tests based on IgE-mediated mecha-
nisms in the subgroup with immediate reaction to the PC.
Inadditiontotheclinicalsignificance,thedirecthealtheco-
nomic benefit of assessing true amoxicillin allergy by PC alone
is clear. Among 17 participants in our sample who had an im-
mediate reaction, just 1 (5.9%) had a positive skin test result.
We estimated the direct health care system cost of a single skin
test to be CaD $170 (US $126; including the cost of physician
and nurse services as well as the PRE-PEN ampule).36,37 We ap-
proximated the cost of a single PC to be CaD $220 (US $164;
including the allergist and nursing services as well as the
amoxicillin).36,37 In our sample, 16 of 17 participants with a
negative skin test result were eligible for a PC. The cost of a
skin test and a PC for those 17 participants is approximately
CaD $6420 (US $4776; including 1 patient with a skin test only
and 16 with skin tests and PC), as compared with CaD $3740
(US $2782) if all 17 had a PC alone.
Further, it is estimated that there are 1 544 703 cases/year
ofAOMinQuebecinchildrenaged0to4years.38Amongthose,
95% will receive antibiotic treatment and 41% (601 662 chil-
dren) will be treated with amoxicillin.1,39 Given that 13% of
those receiving amoxicillin will report a reaction,40 78 216 chil-
dren aged 0 to 4 years in Quebec will have a suspected reac-
tion to amoxicillin in any given year. According to our esti-
mates, 1564 (2.0%) of those will have an immediate reaction.
Therefore, for immediate reactions the cost of a skin test for
the 94 patients who will have a positive result and the 1470
who will have a negative result and require a PC (assuming 6%
of children will have a positive skin test result as observed in
our sample) is approximately CaD $589 280 per year (ie, CaD
$15 980 + CaD $573 300 [US $438 338, or US $11 887 + US
$426 451]), as compared with CaD $344 080 (US $255 945) if
all had a PC alone.

Our findings suggest that a rash lasting longer than 7 days
as well as reported parental drug allergy might be indepen-
dently associated with increased odds of a nonimmediate re-
action to the PC. Given that most common viral rashes in chil-
dren last up to 7 days,41 it is possible that longer duration of
cutaneous symptoms may represent a true amoxicillin al-
lergy. The association between nonimmediate reactions and
reported family history of drug allergy is supported by previ-
ousreportsontheassociationbetweenspecificgeneticlociand
other nonimmediate drug allergies, suggesting a familial
effect.42,43 It is noteworthy that neither paternal nor mater-
nal drug allergy solely was associated with nonimmediate re-
actions.
Our study has some potential limitations. Our catchment
population recruited from a single pediatric center did not in-
clude cases of anaphylaxis and did not include adults. Hence,
our results could not be generalized to all cases of suspected
amoxicillin allergy but rather might only be generalized to pe-
diatric cases presenting with cutaneous, nonanaphylactic re-
actions. In addition, it is possible that the reactions that oc-
curred in children tolerating the PC but not a full subsequent
course of amoxicillin are related to a viral reaction rather than
to a true nonimmediate reaction. The latter might be more
likely given that parents reported that subsequent reactions
were identical to initial reactions. It is also possible that with
moreprolongedPCprotocols,wewouldhavebeenabletoiden-
tify an additional number of nonimmediate reactions.3 How-
ever, even such a prolonged PC may not be able to detect cases
resulting from an interaction between amoxicillin and a viral
infection. Moreover, our PC reached high doses and pro-
voked delayed reactions, confirming its utility for these types
ofreactions.Questionnaireanswersrelyonparentalreportand
hencemayresultinrecallandinformationbias.However,given
that all participants were referred with suspected amoxicillin
allergy and that the PC was administered to all, it is likely that
if such a bias does exist it will be nondifferential and will not
affect the observed associations. Given the lack of commer-
cially available minor determinants (penicilloate and penil-
loate)otherthanpenicillinG,wewerenotabletoconductthese
tests. However, recent studies suggest that testing with PRE-
PENandpenicillinGvsPRE-PENandaminordeterminantmix-
ture would not substantially increase the number of false-
negative cases and that penicillin G can be safely used as an
alternative to a minor determinant mixture in diagnosing peni-
cillin allergy.44,45 Finally, given that not all participants re-
quired full subsequent treatment with amoxicillin, we were
able to determine the percentage of false-negative results for
only a subgroup of participants rather than all 818 partici-
pants. Hence, we were not able to provide sensitivity esti-
mates.
Conclusions
Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to determine the per-
centage of immediate and nonimmediate amoxicillin allergic
reactions through a graded PC in all children presenting with
asuspectedamoxicillin-inducedrash.Ourfindingssuggestthat
the presentation may be very similar in those with hypersen-
sitivity and those who are tolerant of amoxicillin. Further, we
showed that skin tests are less useful for the diagnosis of im-
mediate reactions to amoxicillin. Finally, our study highlights
the usefulness of the graded PC with an appropriate follow-up
to diagnose non–life-threatening reactions to amoxicillin. Fu-
ture studies are required to assess factors associated with spe-
cific PC outcomes and in particular should investigate specific
associations with genetic markers to accurately determine fu-
ture risk for antibiotic allergic reactions.
