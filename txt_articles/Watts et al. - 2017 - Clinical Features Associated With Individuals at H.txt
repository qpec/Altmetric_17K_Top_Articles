IMPORTANCE The identification of a subgroup at higher risk of melanoma may assist in early
diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE To characterize melanoma patients and the clinical features associated with their
melanomas according to patient risk factors: many nevi, history of previous melanoma, and
family history of melanoma, to assist with improving the identification and treatment of a
higher-risk subgroup.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Melanoma Patterns of Care study was a
population-based observational study of physicians’reported treatment of 2727 patients
diagnosed with an in situ or invasive primary melanoma over a 12-month period from October
2006 to 2007 conducted in New South Wales. Our analysis of these data took place from
2015 to 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age at diagnosis and body site of melanoma.
RESULTS Of the 2727 patients with melanoma included, 1052 (39%) were defined as higher
risk owing to a family history of melanoma, multiple primary melanomas, or many nevi.
Compared with patients with melanoma who were at lower risk (ie, without any of these risk
factors), the higher-risk group had a younger mean age at diagnosis (62 vs 65 years, P < .001),
but this differed by risk factor (56 years for patients with a family history, 59 years for those
with many nevi, and 69 years for those with a previous melanoma). These age differences
were consistent across all body sites. Among higher-risk patients, those with many nevi were
more likely to have melanoma on the trunk (41% vs 29%, P < .001), those with a family
history of melanoma were more likely to have melanomas on the limbs (57% vs 42%,
P < .001), and those with a personal history were more likely to have melanoma on the head
and neck (21% vs 15%, P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that a person’
s risk factor status could
be used to tailor surveillance programs and education about skin self-examination.

utaneousmelanomaincidenceisincreasinginpredomi-
nantly European populations.1 Australia’
s incidence is
among the highest in the world,2 and for young Aus-
tralian adults aged 15 to 44 years, melanoma is the most com-
mon malignant abnormality and one of the leading causes of
cancer death.3
Australian4 and international5 clinical practice guide-
lines for management of cutaneous melanoma recommend
that people at higher risk of melanoma consider having
regular surveillance and be educated about skin self-
examination and appropriate sun protection. Number of
nevi, family history of melanoma, and a history of multiple
primary melanomas are among the strongest risk factors for
developing a first or subsequent melanoma.6-8 Further char-
acterization of individuals with these risk factors, and of the
clinical features associated with their melanomas, may
assist in the identification and treatment of this higher-risk
subgroup and could improve our understanding of the etio-
logical heterogeneity of melanoma.
The Melanoma Patterns of Care study documented the
characteristics and treatment of people diagnosed with mela-
noma in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, over a 12-month
period. We aimed to describe patient and melanoma charac-
teristics, including age at diagnosis, histopathological tumor
characteristics, and body site of the melanoma for those iden-
tified as having either many nevi, or a family or personal his-
tory of melanoma (ie, higher-risk patients), and to compare
these characteristics to those of lower-risk patients without
these risk factors.
Methods
Study Sample
The Melanoma Patterns of Care study was a population-
based,observationalstudybasedonphysicians’reportedtreat-
ment of melanoma patients residing in NSW, Australia, with a
new histopathologically confirmed primary in situ, invasive
cutaneous, or unknown primary site melanoma (ICD-O-3 site
codes C44.0 to C44.9 and C80.9; morphology codes 8720-
8790 /2 or /3)9 reported to the NSW Central Cancer Registry
in the 12 months from 23 October 2006. New South Wales is
the most populous state in Australia and includes about one-
third of the Australian population. Patients’demographic in-
formation and degree of spread of the melanoma was ob-
tained from the Registry. Ethics approval was granted by
Human Research Ethics Committees of The University of Syd-
ney and the Cancer Institute NSW. Informed consent was
waived because the data obtained from the cancer registry for
thisstudywasconsistentwiththeaimsoftheNewSouthWales
Cancer Registry.
Data Collection
The “doctor providing initial care following diagnosis” for this
study was the referring physician on the diagnostic pathol-
ogy report on which the cancer registration was based. It is
mandatory for pathologists in NSW to notify every newly di-
agnosed cancer to the Central Cancer Registry. For each new
melanoma reported during this period, the physician provid-
ing initial care was contacted by the study team and asked to
complete a questionnaire regarding the treatment of their pa-
tient. Physicians to whom the initial physician referred a mela-
noma patient were also contacted by the study team and asked
to complete a questionnaire. eFigure 1 in the Supplement de-
scribes this process. While all invasive melanomas were cap-
tured and followed during the study period, questionnaire re-
sponses were only sought for the first 450 notifications of in
situ melanomas, to minimize workload. Trained field work-
ers assisted with completion of questionnaires using patient
records, when requested by physicians with large numbers of
patients.
Questionnaires were completed for 2758 (71%) of 3869 of
patients diagnosed with melanoma during the study period.
Thirty-one (1%) patients for whom risk status was not com-
pleted were excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining 2727
patients, 1052 (39%) were defined as higher risk if they had one
ormoreof:multipleprimarymelanoma(physicianswereasked
“Did the patient have a personal history of melanoma?”), or a
family history of melanoma in a blood relative, or many nevi;
and 1675 (61%) patients were defined as lower risk (eFigure 1
in the Supplement). Body site of the melanoma was catego-
rized as head and neck (face, scalp, ears, neck), trunk, upper
limbs (including shoulders), and lower limbs (including hips).
For 22 patients who were diagnosed with multiple primary
melanomas during the study period, the thickest lesion was
chosen for analysis. Postcode of residence was used to derive
socioeconomic status, based on the Index of Relative Social-
Economic Disadvantage10 that ranks social and economic well-
being, and to derive an index of remoteness based on the Ru-
ral, Remote and Metropolitan Areas classification.11 The
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology (STROBE) checklist was used to guide the report-
ing of this study.12
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of variance F tests, χ2 tests, t tests, and Wilcoxon rank
sum tests were used to compare groups defined by risk fac-
tors. Linear regression was used to test for 2-way interac-
tions. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3, SAS
Institute Inc), with statistical significance inferred at P < .05.
Key Points
Question Does age at diagnosis and body site of melanoma differ
according to patient risk factors?
Findings In this population-based study of 2727 patients with
melanoma, the average age at diagnosis was lower for patients
with a family history (56 years) or with many nevi (59 years)
compared with those without risk factors (65 years). Melanoma
more commonly occurred on the trunk for those with many nevi,
on the limbs for those with a family history, and on the head and
neck for those with a previous melanoma.
Meaning A person’
s melanoma risk factors might be useful in
tailoring skin self-examination and surveillance programs.

Results
Sample Representativeness
Information was collected from clinicians for 71% of patients
diagnosed with melanoma during the study period. The age
distribution of study patients was virtually identical to that of
all melanomas registered by the Cancer Registry during the
study period, but our sample had a slightly higher proportion
of females (39% in those surveyed, 36% in those not sur-
veyed),andaslightlylowerproportionofmelanomasthatwere
4 mm or larger (5% vs 7%).
Patient and Melanoma Characteristics for Those at Higher
Risk vs Lower Risk
Table 1 describes the 1052 patients classified as higher risk, the

family history (28%). Higher-risk patients had, on average, a
higher proportion of superficial spreading melanomas than
lower-risk patients (49% vs 45%), fewer lentigo maligna mela-
nomas (12% vs 15%, P = .007), and a lower proportion of mela-
nomaslargerthan1mmthick(29%vs32%,P < .001).Thehigher-
risk group had a younger mean age at diagnosis (62 years vs 65

pared with 16% of lower-risk patients. A difference in mean age
at diagnosis between higher- and lower-risk patients was ob-
servedforfemales(55.9yearsvs63.3years,P < .001)butnotfor
males(65.1vs65.3years,P = .79).However,alowermeanageof

tients was consistent across all body sites and histological sub-
typesexceptlentigomalignamelanoma(eTable1intheSupple-
ment).Thereweresimilarproportionsofmenandwomeninthe
higher-risk and lower-risk groups, and they had similar socio-
economic status and proportions of urban to rural locations of
residence.
Higher-risk patients were less likely than lower-risk pa-
tients to have a melanoma situated on the head and neck (17%
vs 23%) and more likely to have a melanoma diagnosed on the
trunk(37%vs34%)andlimbs(46%vs43%)(P = .002)(Table1).
The relative tumor density was calculated using the method
described by Pearl and Scott,13 which takes into account the
proportion of skin surface area for each body site. According
to their formula, a relative density of 1 indicates a uniform dis-
tribution of melanomas over the surface of the body, values
above 1 indicate an excess concentration and values less than
1 indicate a lower concentration of melanomas at a particular
bodysite.Thebodysitewiththehighestconcentrationofmela-
nomas relative to its skin surface area was the head and neck
area region (relative tumor density 1.80 for higher-risk pa-
tients and 2.58 for lower-risk patients), followed by the upper
limbs (1.48 and 1.32, respectively), trunk (1.13 and 1.03, respec-
tively), and lower limbs (0.48 and 0.45, respectively).
The pattern of melanomas on different body sites also dif-
feredbysex(Table2).Ineachriskgroup,malesweremorelikely
than females to have melanoma on the trunk and head and
neck, and less likely to have melanoma on the upper and lower
limbs (P < .001).
Differences in Melanoma Characteristics
for Higher-Risk Patients, According to Risk Factor
Among higher-risk patients, those with many nevi were more
likely to have melanoma on the trunk (41% vs 29%, P < .001),
those with family history were more likely to have melanoma
on the limbs (57% vs 42%, P < .001), and those with a per-
sonal history were more likely to have melanomas on the head
and neck (21% vs 15%, P = .003) (Table 3). Lentigo maligna
melanoma was more common for patients with a previous
primary melanoma (22%) compared with those with a family
history (9%) or many nevi (10%).
Patients with a family history of melanoma or with many
nevi were more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age than
those with a personal history of melanoma (Table 3). Fifteen
percent of patients with a family history of melanoma were
younger than 40 years at diagnosis compared with 9% of pa-
tients without a family history. About half (54%) of patients
who had no prior melanoma history were younger than 60
years at diagnosis. The mean age at diagnosis was 56 years for
patients with a family history, 59 years for those with many
nevi, and 69 years for those with a previous melanoma. These
differences in age at diagnosis according to risk factor were ob-
served regardless of the body site of the melanoma (eTable 2
in the Supplement). For patients with many nevi or a per-
sonal history of melanoma, the mean age at diagnosis was low-
est for melanoma on the lower limbs, followed by the upper
limbs, then trunk, then the head and neck (P < .01). Patients
with a family history of melanoma also followed this pattern
but the differences were not statistically significant.
Discussion
In this large population-based study, those classified as being
athigherriskofdevelopingmelanomahadayoungermeanage
at diagnosis, were less likely to have a melanoma on their head
and neck region, and were less likely to have a lentigo ma-
ligna melanoma subtype compared with lower-risk patients.
However, these characteristics differed according to the type
of risk factor; presence of many nevi, family history, or a per-
sonal history of melanoma.
The younger age at diagnosis for patients with a family his-
tory or many nevi is consistent with a genetic predisposition to
melanoma.14-16 Although men and women had a different dis-
tributionofmelanomasondifferentbodysites,whencompared
with lower-risk patients, those at higher risk consistently had a

This is not so of nonEuropean origin populations,26 in which
overall melanoma risk is much lower and body site distribu-
tions are quite different. The approach to high-risk people in
such populations requires separate consideration.
Limitations
Identification of risk factors was based on physicians’recall
and patients’medical records. We did not assess the reliabil-
ity or validity of the risk factor data obtained. Assessing va-
lidity would require contacting patients and conducting a thor-
oughindependentassessmenttocompareagainsttheclinician-
reported data. A supplementary study assessing the validity
and interrater and intrarater reliability of such data would be
valuable. There also may have been different interpretations
of the risk factors. For example, the questionnaire item asked
whether or not the patient had “many nevi” rather than rec-
ord actual nevus count, and for family history there was no as-
certainment of the number of affected relatives or their rela-
tionship to the proband, which would have enabled further
categorization of risk status. Simple, validated questions are
now available to measure family history in clinical settings.27
In addition, other melanoma risk factors, such as hair color,
skin type, previous history of keratinocytic lesions, sun-
burns, or smoking were not collected.
Conclusions
Our data indicate that individuals with many nevi or a family
history of melanoma will, on average, present with mela-
noma at a younger age and be more likely to develop mela-
noma on areas normally covered by clothing (intermittently
sun-exposed sites). Individuals at higher risk of developing
melanoma are likely to benefit from increased surveillance in-
cluding whole-body skin checks and monitoring of nevi.28,29
The results of our study suggest that a person’
s risk factor sta-
tus might be used to tailor their surveillance program in terms
of starting age and education about skin self-examination, or
more intensive surveillance. They could be considered for in-
corporation into clinical practice guidelines to optimize out-
comes for high-risk individuals.5 Risk prediction models that
include these risk factors could be used to personalize pre-
ventionandscreeningstrategies,forexamplebybasingthesur-
veillance starting age on a suitable 10-year absolute risk
threshold.30

NOTABLE NOTES
Robert Willan—Dermatologist and Humanist Extraordinaire
Richard J. Lucariello, BA
Robert Willan was a English physician who was renowned not only for
his dedication to providing health care for the underprivileged but also
for the development of the first classification system of cutaneous
diseases.1-3 Born into a Quaker family on November 12, 1757, Willan at-
tendedmedicalschoolattheUniversityofEdinburghfrom1777to1780.
While studying at the University of Edinburgh, Willan was an officer of
both the Royal Medical Society and the Physical Society.1
As a physician at the Carey Street Dispensary in London from 1783
to 1803, Willan spent much of his medical career caring for the poor
and underprivileged of the 18th-century London slums. During this
time period, hospitals in London primarily cared for the affluent.
Hence, the sick poor of London largely depended on dispensaries for
their medical care.2
While working at the Carey Street Dispensary, Willan developed an
interest in cutaneous diseases. Willan was the first physician who at-
temptedtodevelopaclassificationsystemforcutaneousdiseases,based
primarilyonthemorphologicalfeaturesofthedermatologicdisease.1His
classification system included 8 orders: the papulae, squamae, exan-
themata, bullae, pustulae, vesiculae, tubercula, and maculae.1,3 Orders
were further subdivided into genera, which were based on species. For
example, the squamae order included 4 genera: Lepra, Psoriasis, Pity-
riasis, and Ichthyosis.1,3 The genus Pityriasis contained the species capi-
tis, rubra, and versicolor.1,3
In 1808, Willan published On Cutaneous Diseases, Vol 1, a detailed
descriptionofhisfirst4orders:thepapulae,squamae,exanthemata,and
bullae.Thisworkalsoincludeddetailedillustrationsofplatesmadefrom
watercolor drawings.3 Willan intended to publish his second volume of
On Cutaneous Diseases, which was to address his remaining 4 orders.2
However,in1811,hedevelopedhemoptysiswhilecaringforapatientand
died on April 7, 1812, in Funchal, Portugal.
Willan’
s legacy, however, did not die with him. He was fortunate
enough to have a dedicated and highly talented pupil, who became his
eventualsuccessorattheCareyStreetDispensary.Thismentee,Thomas
Bateman, helped solidify his mentor’
s legacy by successfully complet-
ing Willan’
s Cutaneous Diseases in 1817.2 Bateman’
s work Delineations
ofCutaneousDiseases,ExhibitingtheCharacteristicAppearancesofthe
Principle Genera and Species, Comprised in the classification of the late
Dr Willan not only addressed the remaining 4 orders (the pustulae, ve-
siculae, tubercula and maculae) that Willan had been unable to com-
plete himself but also included illustrated plates from Willan’
s own col-
lection of watercolor drawings.2

complisheddermatologistsofhistimeandthroughoutthehistoryofscience.
