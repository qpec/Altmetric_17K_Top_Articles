Hepatic fibrosis is marked by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Cholestatic injury precedes liver fibrosis, and
cholangiocytes interact with HSCs promoting fibrosis. Mast cells (MCs) infiltrate following liver injury and release his-
tamine, increasing biliary proliferation. We evaluated if inhibition of MC-derived histamine decreases biliary prolifera-
tion and fibrosis. Wild-type and multidrug resistance 2 knockout mice (9-11 weeks) were treated with cromolyn
sodium for 1 week to block MC-derived histamine. Biliary mass and proliferation were evaluated by immunohisto-
chemistry for cytokeratin 19 and Ki-67. Bile flow, bicarbonate excretion, and total bile acids were measured in all mice.
Fibrosis was evaluated by sirius red/fast green staining and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for alpha-smooth
muscle actin, fibronectin, collagen type 1a, and transforming growth factor-beta 1. HSC activation was evaluated by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction in total liver and immunofluorescent staining in tissues for synaptophysin 9.
Histamine serum secretion was measured by enzymatic immunoassay. Mouse liver and human liver samples from con-
trol or primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were evaluated for MC markers by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, cultured MCs were transfected with histidine decarboxylase short hairpin RNA to
decrease histamine secretion and subsequently cocultured with cholangiocytes or HSCs prior to measuring fibrosis
markers, proliferation, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 secretion. Treatment with cromolyn sodium decreased
biliary proliferation, fibrosis, histamine secretion, and bile flow in multidrug resistance 2 knockout mice. Primary scle-
rosing cholangitis mice and patients have increased MCs. Knockdown of MC histidine decarboxylase decreased cholan-
giocyte and HSC proliferation/activation. Conclusion: MCs are recruited to proliferating cholangiocytes and promote
fibrosis. Inhibition of MC-derived histamine decreases fibrosis, and regulation of MC mediators may be therapeutic
for primary sclerosing cholangitis. (HEPATOLOGY 2016;64:1202-1216)

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 P
rimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progres-
sive disease of the liver characterized by chronic
cholestasis leading to inflammation and fibrosis
of the biliary epithelium. PSC often occurs in the third
and fourth decades of life and can affect intrahepatic
and/or extrahepatic ducts, leading to diffuse stricturing
and thickening.(1) Though the etiology of PSC is not
fully known, it has autoimmune features which may
explain the presence of serum markers such as antin-
uclear antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cyto-
plasmic antibodies, which are found in up to 50% and
80% of cases, respectively.(1,2) No effective treatment has
been found to slow or alter the progression of PSC, and
it remains a leading cause of liver transplantation.
The multidrug resistance gene 2 is an adenosine
triphosphate-binding cassette transporter, which encodes a
P-type glycoprotein responsible for the excretion of biliary
phospholipids.(1,3)
Multidrug
resistance
2
knockout
(Mdr22/2) mice, which mimic human PSC progres-
sion,(3) lack this gene, causing bile acids to accumulate in
the intrahepatic biliary system and disrupt portal tract
function. The proper function of the bicarbonate umbrella
has been demonstrated to be important in the regulation
of cholangiopathies including PSC, and Mdr22/2 mice
have been described to be vulnerable to toxic bile
formation, which can be induced by decreased bicarbonate
excretion, abnormal bile composition, increased biliary
pressure, and biliary casts.(4,5) While hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs) are the primary producers of collagen leading to
fibrosis in most chronic liver diseases,(3) cholangiocytes
have also been found to play a role in promoting hepatic
fibrosis by interacting with HSCs through hedgehog
signaling.(6)
Mast cells (MCs) are developed from pluripotent
stem cells found in the bone marrow and the spleen.
They secrete histamine, as well as a variety of other
cytokines, and play an important role in both the
innate immune system and the allergic response.(7)
MC-derived histamine can stimulate biliary prolifera-
tion and fibrosis through autocrine and paracrine
mechanisms.(8) Furthermore, the number of hepatic
MCs increases as liver disease progresses.(9) Following
bile duct ligation, MCs are found in close proximity to
bile ducts and portal tracts.(8) MC infiltration corre-
lates with increased bile duct mass and proliferation,
and treatment with the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodi-
um decreases bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced bile
duct mass and biliary proliferation.(8)
Cromolyn sodium has also been used to treat the
autoimmune disorder irritable bowel disease.(10,11)
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that cromolyn
sodium acts directly on MCs but has no direct effect
on cholangiocytes, suggesting that this compound may
be useful to modulate MC degranulation during chol-
angiopathies.(8) Such evidence is important for studies
aimed at treatments for cholangiopathies because it
further details the paracrine role served by MCs in the
setting of liver diseases such as PSC.

 primers, short hairpin (shRNA), and real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) materials were obtained from Qiagen
(Valencia,
CA).
Antibodies
for
immunoblotting,
immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).
Histamine enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) kits were pur-
chased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).
IN VIVO MODELS
We used the genetically modified mouse model of
PSC Mdr22/2. Both FVB/NJ (wild type [WT]) and
Mdr22/2 male mice (9-11 weeks of age) obtained
from Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA) were
implanted with osmotic minipumps to deliver cromo-
lyn sodium (24 mg/kg body weight) for 1 week.(8) All
mice were housed in the Baylor Scott and White
Health Animal Facility and given free access to drink-
ing water and standard chow. All animals were kept in
a temperature-controlled environment with a 12:12
light/dark cycle, and all protocols strictly adhered to
regulations set forth by the local Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
From all animals we collected serum and liver blocks
(frozen and paraffin-embedded). We performed hema-
toxylin and eosin staining in livers to evaluate lobular
damage, hepatic necrosis, and inflammation.
DETECTION OF MCs, MC
MARKERS, AND HISTAMINE
SECRETION IN PSC MICE
In all groups hepatic MC presence was detected by
immunohistochemistry for mouse MC protease 1. MC
marker expression (c-kit, chymase, and tryptase) was
measured in total liver by real-time PCR.(8,12) Hista-
mine secretion was evaluated by EIA in serum from all
groups of mice.(13)
EVALUATION OF MCs AND MC
MARKERS IN HUMAN PSC
To determine if MCs are present in human PSC, we
measured the expression of MC markers by toluidine
blue staining, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR
for c-Kit, FC�R1, chymase, and tryptase in human liver
sections from control (no disease) and PSC patients (84%
late stage PSC and 16% advanced PSC). The classifica-
tion of late-stage and advanced-stage PSC was as follows:
stage 1, inflammation and connective tissue proliferation
around the small bile ducts; stage 2, inflammation passes
into the liver with the formation of scar tissue; stage 3,
more severe scar tissue forms; and stage 4, biliary liver cir-
rhosis. Stages 1 and 2 represent early-stage PSC, and
stages 3 and 4 represent late-stage to advanced-stage
PSC, which have similar characteristics. Liver sections (4-
5 lm thick) obtained by needle biopsies from three con-
trol patients and three PSC patients were provided by
one of the authors (P.I.) under a protocol approved by the
ethics committee of the Humanitas Research Hospital;
the protocol was also reviewed by the local Veterans’
Administration institutional review board and research
and development committee. The use of human tissue
was also approved by the Baylor Scott & White Health
institutional review board.
EVALUATION OF BILIARY MASS
AND PROLIFERATION
Because we previously demonstrated that MCs infil-
trate the liver following BDL and participate in sus-
taining biliary proliferation,(8) we measured the effects
of cromolyn sodium on intrahepatic bile duct mass
(IBDM) and proliferation in Mdr22/2 mice. In liver
sections from all groups we performed immunohisto-
chemistry for the biliary marker cytokeratin 19(8,13) to
measure IBDM and the number of cholangiocytes
positive for Ki-67 to evaluate biliary proliferation.
CROMOLYN SODIUM EFFECTS

EXCRETION, AND TOTAL BILE
ACIDS
Bile was collected from all animal groups according
to previous work.(14) Incannulation of the gallbladder
was performed using a 30-gauge needed attached to
polyethylene 10 tubing immediately following ligation
of the common bile duct. Bile was collected for up to
20 minutes and stored for bicarbonate and total bile
acid (TBA) analysis. Body temperature was monitored
and maintained at 378C throughout the collection, and
fluids were introduced into the peritoneal cavity. Bicar-
bonate levels were assessed in all groups by National
Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (Yale Univer-
sity School of Medicine), and TBA was measured in
bile, serum, and total liver homogenate from all groups
using the commercially available Mouse Total Bile
Acid Assay Kit (Crystal Chemical, Wakefield, MA).

 EFFECTS OF MCs AND MC-DERIVED
HISTAMINE ON HEPATIC FIBROSIS
To evaluate the effects of MCs on hepatic fibrosis,
we measured collagen content in liver sections from all
experimental groups by fast green/sirius red (along
with semiquantification) and Masson’s trichrome.(13)
In total liver we measured the following fibrotic
markers by real-time PCR: a-smooth muscle actin (a-
SMA), collagen type-1a, and fibronectin.(13) Transform-
ing growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1) is a known regulator
of HSC-driven fibrosis,(1) and we evaluated the expres-
sion of TGF-b1 in total liver by real-time PCR.(8,13)
ALTERATIONS TO VASCULAR
ENDOTHELIAL CELLS
FOLLOWING MC-DERIVED
HISTAMINE INHIBITION
We measured the effects of cromolyn sodium on the
vascular bed by evaluating the expression of von Wille-
brand factor (factor VIII) by immunofluorescence in
liver sections and the expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor A in total liver RNA by real-time PCR
as described.(8,13)
EVALUATION OF HSC
ACTIVATION
We evaluated the effects of MCs on HSC activa-
tion. In tissue sections from all groups we measured
HSC
activation
by
immunofluorescence
for
synaptophysin-9 (SYP-9). Livers were costained with
cytokeratin 19 to visualize bile ducts. In total liver we
evaluated SYP-9 gene expression by real-time PCR.
IN VITRO EVALUATION OF MC/
CHOLANGIOCYTE/HSC
INTERACTIONS
Our hypothesis is that, following cholangiocyte injury
(i.e., BDL or in Mdr22/2), MCs infiltrate the liver and
release factors (e.g., histamine) to increase cholangiocyte
proliferation and activate HSCs, thereby contributing to
fibrosis progression. To evaluate if MCs alter both chol-
angiocytes and HSCs in vitro, we used immortalized
murine biliary cell lines that we have previously used in
numerous studies and are comprised of all sizes of mouse
cholangiocytes,(13,15) human HSCs (hHSCs), and cul-
tured mouse MCs. To determine if MC-derived hista-
mine alters either cholangiocyte or HSC proliferation/
activation, MCs were first transfected with empty
vector or shRNA targeting histidine decarboxylase
(HDC) to inhibit the production and release of MC
histamine.(13,16)
Cholangiocytes were plated and allowed to come to
confluence before the addition of nonadherent MC
cultures (transfected with empty vector [MCneg] or
HDC shRNA [MCshHDC] to manipulate MC his-
tamine levels).(15,16) After up to 6 days of coculture,
proliferation/activation and fibrosis were measured by
real-time PCR for proliferating cellular nuclear antigen
(PCNA), a-SMA, fibronectin, and TGF-b1.(8)
Human HSCs were stimulated with MC superna-
tants collected from transfected MCs, MCneg (stable
levels of histamine), or MCshHDC (depleted levels of
histamine); and we measured hHSC expression of
PCNA, a-SMA, fibronectin, and TGF-b1.
STATISTICAL METHODS
All data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of
the mean. Groups were analyzed by the Student
unpaired t test when two groups were analyzed or a
two-way analysis of variance when more than two
groups were analyzed, followed by an appropriate post
hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
DETECTION OF MCs, MC
MARKERS, AND HISTAMINE
SECRETION
Because MCs have been found in close proximity to
proliferating bile ducts, infiltrate the liver following
BDL in rats,(8) and are found in human PSC(17), we
aimed to demonstrate that MCs are present in
Mdr22/2 mice. Immunohistochemistry for mouse
MC protease 1 demonstrated that there is an increase
in the number of MCs in Mdr22/2 compared to WT
mice and that MC numbers were reduced in Mdr22/2
mice treated with cromolyn sodium (Fig. 1A). Further,
MCs were found in close proximity to large bile ducts
(marked with black arrows, Fig. 1A). In serum from
Mdr22/2 mice, histamine secretion increased com-
pared to WT, whereas in Mdr22/2 mice treated with
cromolyn sodium, histamine secretion was significantly
down-regulated (Fig. 1B). The expression of c-Kit,
chymase, and tryptase increased in Mdr22/2 mice
compared to WT; and treatment with cromolyn sodi-
um decreased these genes (Fig. 1C).

 Using samples collected from patients diagnosed
with late-stage or advanced-stage PSC and corre-
sponding control tissues, we confirmed the presence of
MCs and MC markers (Fig. 2). Similar to previous
reports, livers from human PSC patients displayed
robust
MC
marker
expression
including
c-Kit,
FC�R1, chymase, and tryptase, as shown by real-time
PCR (Fig. 2A) and by immunostaining for toluidine
blue and immunohistochemistry for chymase and tryp-
tase (Fig. 2B) when compared to control tissue that
had few or no MCs. These data support the concept
that MCs are an important player in the regulation
and progression of human PSC.

LIVER DAMAGE AND DECREASES
BILIARY MASS AND
PROLIFERATION IN MDR22/2
MICE
In Mdr22/2 mice necrosis, lobular damage, and
portal inflammation increased compared to WT,
whereas treatment with cromolyn sodium ameliorated
these pathological features (Fig. 3A). The liver/body
weight ratio increased in Mdr22/2 mice compared to
WT,
whereas
treatment
with
cromolyn
sodium
decreased the liver/body weight ratio compared to
Mdr22/2 mice (Fig. 3B).
We have demonstrated that cromolyn sodium treat-
ment decreases IBDM and proliferation in rats follow-
ing BDL.(8) In our current study we found that IBDM
and cholangiocyte proliferation were both increased in
Mdr22/2 compared to WT mice (Fig. 3C,D). In
Mdr22/2 mice treated with cromolyn sodium, IBDM
and proliferation decreased compared to Mdr22/2
mice (Fig. 3C,D).
BLOCKING MC-DERIVED
HISTAMINE INHIBITS BILE
FLOW, DECREASES
BICARBONATE LEVELS, AND
REDUCES THE TBA POOL
In Mdr22/2 mice, there was increased bile flow;
however, treatment with cromolyn sodium reduced
bile
flow
(Fig.
4A).
Bicarbonate
excretion
was
unchanged between WT and Mdr22/2 mice but was
reduced in Mdr22/2 mice treated with cromolyn sodi-
um compared to Mdr22/2 mice (Fig. 4B). TBA
composition in bile was reduced in Mdr22/2 mice
treated with or without cromolyn sodium compared to
WT (Fig. 4C), whereas serum bile acids (Fig. 4D) and
total liver homogenate bile acids (Fig. 4E) were
increased in Mdr22/2 compared to WT mice and
treatment with cromolyn sodium decreased both serum
and total liver homogenate bile acid levels.
INHIBITION OF MC-DERIVED
HISTAMINE DECREASES
HEPATIC FIBROSIS IN MDR2-/-
MICE
In liver sections we evaluated collagen content by fast
green/sirius red and Masson’s trichrome staining (Fig.
5A). Mdr22/2 mice have increased collagen deposition
compared to WT, whereas in Mdr22/2 mice treated
with cromolyn sodium collagen deposition was reduced
(Fig. 5A). Fast green/sirius red staining was semiquanti-
fied and demonstrates that there is a significant up-
regulation of collagen content in Mdr22/2 mice com-
pared to WT and that treatment with cromolyn sodium
decreases collagen content in Mdr22/2 mice (Fig. 5B).
By real-time PCR, we found that a-SMA, collagen
type-1a, and fibronectin increased in Mdr22/2 mice
compared to WT. When Mdr22/2 mice were treated
with cromolyn sodium, the expression of these fibrotic
genes decreased (Fig. 5C).
BLOCKING MC-DERIVED
HISTAMINE ALTERS VASCULAR
CELL PROLIFERATION IN
MDR22/2 MICE
Immunofluorescence for factor VIII reveals that there
is an up-regulation of vascular cell positivity in Mdr22/2
mice compared to WT and that treatment with cromolyn
decreases the intensity/positivity of factor VIII (Support-
ing Fig. S1). Further, vascular endothelial growth factor
A gene expression was increased in Mdr22/2 mice com-
pared to WT and decreased in Mdr22/2 mice treated
with cromolyn sodium (Supporting Fig. S1).

FIG. 1. MCs were found in close proximity to bile ducts in Mdr22/2 mice. (A) The number of mouse MC protease 1-positive

decreased the number of infiltrating MCs. (A) MCs are indicated with red arrows, and large bile ducts are marked with black

 have on biliary proliferation and fibrotic reaction. MCs
were transfected with HDCshRNA (MCshHDC) to
inhibit histamine production or empty vector (MCneg)
prior to coculture with cultured cholangiocytes (Fig.
7A). When cholangiocytes were cocultured with
MCneg (stable levels of HDC), there was an increase
in proliferation, fibrosis markers, and TGF-b1 as
shown by PCR (Fig. 7B). In contrast, in cholangio-
cytes cocultured with MCshHDC, there was a signifi-
cant decrease in these parameters suggesting that MC-
derived histamine regulates biliary proliferation and
fibrotic reaction in vitro (Fig. 7B).
Next, hHSCs were stimulated with supernatants col-
lected from MCneg and MCshHDC transfected cells
for up to 48 hours (Fig. 8A). In hHSCs stimulated with
MCneg (stable levels of MC histamine), there was a sig-
nificant increase in proliferation (Fig. 8B) and fibrotic
markers (Fig. 8C) compared to basal treatment; however,
in
hHSCs
stimulated
with
supernatants
from
MCshHDC (inhibited levels of MC histamine), these
parameters decreased. These data strongly indicate that
hHSCs are influenced by MC-derived histamine, which
ultimately alters HSC activation, driving fibrosis.

 (through cromolyn sodium treatment) decreases pro-
liferation and hepatic fibrosis associated with PSC. In
support of our findings, it has been demonstrated that
MCs are present in human PSC(19,20) and contribute
to the progression of fibrosis. c-Kit-positive MCs
have been found in the portal tract,(19) and increased
MC infiltration has been shown within the sclerosing
areas of PSC patients.(20) Our results demonstrate
that MCs are found in both advanced-stage and late-
stage human PSC and may contribute to the fibrotic
phenotype. MCs have also been found in primary bil-
iary cirrhosis and alcoholic liver injury(17,21) implicat-
ing these immune cells in liver damage.
Our previous work demonstrates that in models
of damage or cellular proliferation histamine levels
are increased.(15,18) We have shown that cholangio-
cytes secrete histamine and that during cholangio-
carcinoma
progression
there
is
an
autocrine
regulation of cholangiocyte histamine release that
increases tumor growth.(16) Following BDL, MCs
infiltrate the liver and increase proliferation.(8) In
addition, patients with PSC have increased serum
histamine concentrations and the presence of MCs
is
increased.(22)
These
studies
indicate
a
link

FIG. 3. (A) Liver damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining in liver sections from all groups. Inflammation, necro-
sis, and lobular damage increased in Mdr22/2 mice compared to WT mice; and these features were reduced in Mdr22/2 mice
treated with cromolyn sodium. Images are 320 magnification. (B) Liver weight and body weights were recorded for each animal,
and the ratio was calculated. Mdr22/2 mice have an increased liver/body weight ratio compared to WT, and treatment with cro-
molyn sodium significantly decreases the liver/body weight ratio compared to Mdr22/2. (C) Bile duct mass and (D) Ki-67 were
evaluated in liver sections from WT mice, Mdr22/2 mice, and Mdr22/2 mice treated with cromolyn sodium. We found that bile
duct mass (cytokeratin 19 staining, red arrows) and Ki-67 increased in Mdr22/2 mice compared to WT mice, whereas treatment
with cromolyn sodium decreased both bile duct mass (red arrows) and the number of proliferating cholangiocytes (green arrows).

 damage and is marked by increased biliary prolifera-
tion and periportal or portal fibrosis. Further, our
previous work has also shown that inhibition of his-
tamine decreases biliary proliferation and damage(8);
therefore, modulation of MC-derived histamine
induces an alteration in biliary response and hepatic
fibrosis.
Mdr22/2 mice undergo a transformation from birth
to maturity that involves biliary proliferation associated
with liver damage, peaking anywhere from 6 to 12
weeks of age.(3) The male mice we used were 9-11
weeks of age, and, as shown by hematoxylin and eosin,
there was marked inflammation along with increased
bile duct mass and biliary proliferation, which were
alleviated by cromolyn sodium treatment. Cromolyn
sodium has been found to inhibit cellular proliferation
in a number of models and diseases. In various cancer
cell lines cromolyn sodium decreased proliferation,
including adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,
mammary gland carcinoma, and epidermoid larynx
carcinoma, demonstrating that cromolyn sodium is
antiproliferative.(23)
It has been reported that Mdr22/2 mice are suscepti-
ble to toxic bile formation, which can be caused by
increased bicarbonate excretion, abnormal bile composi-
tion, increased biliary pressure, and biliary casts.(4,5) In
our study we found an increase in bile flow in Mdr22/2
mice that was ameliorated by cromolyn sodium treat-
ment. Bicarbonate levels were elevated compared to WT
and significantly reduced by cromolyn sodium treatment.
In support of our findings, an early study found that his-
tamine treatment increased choleresis in sheep; and while
treatment with an H1HR antagonist did not alter
histamine-induced bile flow, the H2HR antagonists

FIG. 4. In vivo, we measured the effects of cromolyn sodium treatment on bile flow, bicarbonate excretion, and TBA concentration.
In Mdr22/2 mice there was increased bile flow; however, treatment with cromolyn sodium significantly reduced bile flow (A). Bicar-
bonate excretion was unchanged between WT and Mdr22/2 mice but was reduced in Mdr22/2 mice treated with cromolyn sodium
compared to Mdr22/2 mice (B). TBA composition in bile was reduced in Mdr22/2 mice treated with or without cromolyn sodium
compared to WT (C), whereas serum bile acids (D) and total liver homogenate bile acids (E) were increased in Mdr22/2 mice com-
pared to WT and treatment with cromolyn sodium decreased both serum and total liver homogenate bile acid levels. Data are
expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean of at least six experiments from each animal for bile flow, six experiments from each
animal for bicarbonate excretion, four experiments for bile TBA, 10 experiments for serum TBA, and four experiments for total liver
TBA. *P < 0.05 versus WT; #P < 0.05 versus Mdr22/2 mice. Abbreviation: NS, not significant.

 cimetidine and ranitidine both inhibited histamine-
induced choleresis.(24) Further, in rats, ischemic reperfu-
sion has been shown to decrease hepatic bile flow and
treatment with ranitidine reversed these effects,(25) again
demonstrating that histamine (through HR activation)
has a relevant effect on choleresis and hepatic function.
Interestingly, a study investigating MC effects on ische-
mic reperfusion and bile flow found that there was no
difference in bile flow excretion between WT rats and
MC-deficient, Ws/Ws rats,(26) which, in contrast to our
study, might be explained by the difference in injury and
rodent model. Our data demonstrate that hepatic bile
flow is increased in PSC mice (which have more MCs
compared to WT), and our studies are the first to dem-
onstrate that inhibition of MC-derived histamine may
regulate the bicarbonate umbrella and have a protective
role against toxic bile in Mdr22/2 mice. TBA was
increased in the Mdr22/2 mice but decreased in serum
and significantly reduced in liver homogenates in mice
treated with cromolyn sodium. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to demonstrate that inhibition of MC-
derived histamine alters and decreases the TBA pool in a
PSC model, and further studies are planned to better
understand this important event.
The pattern of PSC progression in Mdr22/2 mice
has been described to be similar to that seen in
humans. Popov et al. reported that Mdr22/2 mice dis-
play a robust fibrotic reaction beginning at 2 weeks
after birth and that by 8 weeks of age there is an
increase in collagen deposition and fibrosis-related

FIG. 5. Fibrosis and collagen content were evaluated by immunostaining and real-time PCR in WT mice, Mdr22/2 mice, and
Mdr22/2 mice treated with cromolyn sodium. (A) Staining with fast green/sirius red and Masson’s trichrome demonstrated an
increase in collagen content in Mdr22/2 compared to WT mice. (B) Treatment with cromolyn sodium decreased collagen content
and the fibrotic reaction in Mdr22/2 mice as shown by semiquantification of fast green/sirius red staining. (C) The expression of a-
SMA, collagen-type 1a, and fibronectin was increased in total liver messenger RNA from Mdr22/2 compared to WT mice; and treat-
ment with cromolyn sodium decreased these fibrotic genes. Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean of at least nine

 genes are, including a-SMA, that is 20-fold greater
than in WT mice.(27) Our studies reveal that Mdr22/2
mice exhibit large portal and periportal fibrosis but not
parenchymal fibrosis, and examinations of Mdr22/2
mice at later ages also confirm the presence of bile duct
disease and hepatic fibrosis,(28) which is concurrent
with our present findings. Mdr22/2 mice were found
to have large amounts of collagen content and an
increase in a-SMA and fibronectin. When we treated
mice with cromolyn sodium, there was a marked
decrease in fibrosis progression. Because our model
induces portal and periportal fibrosis, we can presume
that these changes are dependent on ductal fibrosis and
not just cholestatic liver injury. Studies attest to the
ability of cromolyn sodium to alter the remodeling of
tissues, a process that is critical in fibrotic scarring. In
pulmonary vascular remodeling, it has been shown that
MC stabilization through cromolyn sodium treatment
ameliorated the vascular remodeling in rats subjected
to pulmonary arterial hypertension and resulted in
more favorable hemodynamics.(29) Further, MCs can
stimulate collagen synthesis in the skin by dermal
fibroblasts and thereby may alter scar formation. A
study by Chen et al. found that cromolyn sodium
treatment reduced the formation of cutaneous scars
and inflammation but did not weaken the healing
wound, suggesting that cromolyn sodium plays an
important role in tissue alteration.(30)

 Because hepatic fibrosis is also considered an inflam-
matory event,(31) cromolyn sodium may be reducing
the degree of inflammation and inflammatory media-
tors and thereby attenuating fibrosis progression. To
understand this further, we examined a primary
inflammatory mediator of fibrosis, TGF-b1.(32,33)
Once activated, MCs release numerous factors into the
tissue environment including inflammatory cytokines
like TGF-b1, histamine, and other growth fac-
tors.(12,34,35) Our present study also includes an exami-
nation of HSCs that, once activated, promote fibrosis
through numerous mechanisms including TGF-b1,
nuclear factor jB, and hedgehog signaling.(36-38) We
found that HSC activation and TGF-b1 expression
were increased in Mdr22/2 mice compared to WT but
that when mice were treated with cromolyn sodium
there was a decrease in activated HSCs.(39) These results
suggest that MCs interact with HSCs and that MC-
derived histamine may alter HSC activation. To support
these findings, a recent study has demonstrated that MC
tryptase induces the activation of protease-activated
receptor 2 and increases HSC activation and prolifera-
tion, thus promoting hepatic fibrosis and implying that
MCs interact directly with HSCs to drive fibrosis.(40) To
back our findings, it has been demonstrated that in rats
with myocardial fibrosis MCs infiltrate, correlating with
increased fibrosis and TGF-b1 levels. When these rats
were treated with cromolyn sodium, MC infiltration was
reduced along with myocardial fibrosis and TGF-b1
expression.(41) Taken together, inhibition of MC-derived
histamine may be beneficial in preventing the fibrotic
reaction found in PSC.

 There is a dynamic regulation of cellular prolifera-
tion and activation during PSC-induced fibrosis.(42,43)
HSCs are a key player in this event, and recent studies
have
demonstrated
that
cholangiocytes
are
also
involved in the progression of hepatic fibrosis.(44,45)
Our past studies have shown that MCs and cholangio-
cytes interact and that MC-derived histamine alters
cholangiocyte proliferation.(8) To understand if MCs
alter cholangiocyte and hHSC fibrotic events, we per-
formed in vitro studies using established cultured cell
lines. To this end, we found that when either cholan-
giocytes or HSCs were cocultured or treated with
MCs containing stable levels of histamine, there were
increases in proliferation, activation, and fibrotic gene
expression. In contrast, when these cells were cocul-
tured with MCs containing diminished levels of hista-
mine, the fibrotic reaction and cellular activation were
reduced. Our data imply that MCs may interact
with
both
cholangiocytes
and
HSCs
to
drive
fibrosis and that MC-derived histamine alters both the
cholangiocyte and hHSC fibrotic reaction. It has been
demonstrated by Omenetti et al. that HSCs and chol-
angiocytes interact to promote epithelial-mesenchymal
transformation, cell migration, and the progression of
fibrosis.(46) And, in support of the concept that MCs
may also influence HSCs, it has been shown that
protease-activated receptor 2 (activated by MC tryp-
tase) stimulates the activation of HSCs and increases
profibrogenic cytokines and collagen and that in
protease-activated receptor 2 knockout mice these phe-
nomena are decreased, again supporting the concept
that MCs may interact with HSCs during fibrosis.(47)
Portal fibroblasts are also key regulators of hepatic
fibrosis, and in Mdr22/2 mice portal myofibroblasts
are activated and contribute to fibrosis.(28,48) An early
study by Akiyoshi et al. reported that MCs, portal

FIG. 8. (A) In vitro, we measured the effects of MCs transfected with empty vector (MCneg) or HDC shRNA (MCshHDC) on
hHSCs in culture. Following stimulation with supernatants from MCs containing stable levels of histamine (MCneg), expression of
(B) hHSC PCNA, (C) a-SMA, and fibronectin was increased, whereas in hHSCs stimulated with supernatants from MCs containing
depleted levels of histamine (MCshHDC), these parameters were decreased. Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the
mean of at least four experiments for real-time PCR. *P < 0.05 versus basal hHSCs, #P < 0.05 versus MCneg.

 myofibroblasts, and cholinergic nerve terminals work
synergistically to promote liver fibrosis,(49) demonstrat-
ing that the paracrine influence from MCs is not limit-
ed to altered HSCs and cholangiocyte function. In
human fibrosis, MC chymase expression is increased,
which is coupled with increased expression of myofi-
broblast angiotensin II receptor AT1, suggesting that
fibrosis can be mediated by MCs and myofibro-
blasts.(50) Our data demonstrate that MCs influence
cholangiocytes and HSCs; however, we cannot rule
out the important role that activated myofibroblasts
may play in our model, and further studies are war-
ranted to examine this (Supporting Fig. S2, working
model).
In summary, we have demonstrated that MCs are
present in the Mdr22/2 PSC mouse model and
human PSC and that MCs contribute to HSC activa-
tion and fibrosis. Inhibition of MC-derived histamine
decreases proliferation/fibrosis and may act on the
bicarbonate umbrella. Targeting MCs and MC-
derived components may offer new therapeutic benefits
for patients with PSC.
