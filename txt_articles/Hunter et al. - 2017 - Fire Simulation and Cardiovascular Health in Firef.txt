BACKGROUND: Rates of myocardial infarction in firefighters are increased 
during fire suppression duties, and are likely to reflect a combination 
of factors including extreme physical exertion and heat exposure. We 
assessed the effects of simulated fire suppression on measures of 
cardiovascular health in healthy firefighters.
METHODS: In an open-label randomized crossover study, 19 healthy 
firefighters (age, 41±7 years; 16 males) performed a standardized training 
exercise in a fire simulation facility or light duties for 20 minutes. After 
each exposure, ex vivo thrombus formation, fibrinolysis, platelet activation, 
and forearm blood flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelial-
dependent and -independent vasodilators were measured.
RESULTS: After fire simulation training, core temperature increased 
(1.0±0.1°C) and weight reduced (0.46±0.14 kg, P<0.001 for both). In 
comparison with control, exposure to fire simulation increased thrombus 
formation under low-shear (73±14%) and high-shear (66±14%) conditions 
(P<0.001 for both) and increased platelet-monocyte binding (7±10%, 
P=0.03). There was a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow 
with all vasodilators (P<0.001), which was attenuated by fire simulation in 
response to acetylcholine (P=0.01) and sodium nitroprusside (P=0.004). 
This was associated with a rise in fibrinolytic capacity, asymptomatic 
myocardial ischemia, and an increase in plasma cardiac troponin I 
concentrations (1.4 [0.8–2.5] versus 3.0 [1.7–6.4] ng/L, P=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to extreme heat and physical exertion during 
fire suppression activates platelets, increases thrombus formation, impairs 
vascular function, and promotes myocardial ischemia and injury in healthy 
firefighters. Our findings provide pathogenic mechanisms to explain 
the association between fire suppression activity and acute myocardial 
infarction in firefighters.

ardiovascular events are the leading cause of death 
among firefighters and are responsible for ≈45% of 
on-duty fatalities each year in the United States.1 
These deaths disproportionately cluster around fire sup-
pression duties, despite this activity accounting for only 
1% to 5% of a firefighter’s time.2 Death from coronary 
artery disease was 12 to 136 times more likely to occur 
during or shortly after fire suppression than nonemer-
gency duties. The hostile conditions of fire suppression 
include high ambient temperatures, extreme physical ex-
ertion, noxious air pollutants, and psychological stress. 
It is likely that there are additive or synergistic effects of 
these potential triggers in susceptible firefighters that 
may culminate in acute cardiovascular events.
Fire training forms an important part of the recruit-
ment process and training among operational firefight-
ers. The cardiovascular response to fire suppression 
is difficult to study in a real-life setting because of the 
unpredictability of events and time pressures during an 
emergency situation. As a research tool, real fire train-
ing centers offer a unique opportunity to assess the 
physiological effects of fire suppression in a controlled 
setting.3–15 Previous observations suggest that heat and 
physical stress, in combination with hemoconcentration 
attributable to fluid loss, reduce cardiac output and in-
duce a hypercoagulable state.3,16 However, our under-
standing of the pathogenic mechanisms to explain the 
association between fire suppression and acute myocar-
dial infarction is incomplete, and, therefore, the optimal 
approach to reduce risk in firefighters is uncertain. Our 
aim was to undertake a comprehensive assessment of 
the effects of fire suppression on cardiovascular health 
in firefighters.
METHODS
Study Participants
Nineteen healthy nonsmoking firefighters were enrolled in 
the study. The study was performed in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, with the approval of the local research 
ethics committee and the written informed consent of all vol-
unteers. Subjects were recruited by sending study information 
sheets and letters to randomly selected firefighters from the 
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Exclusion criteria included 
cigarette smoking, known cardiovascular disease, arrhyth-
mias, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, use of regular 
medication, renal or hepatic impairment, or an intercurrent 
infective illness. Subjects reported no symptoms of respiratory 
tract infection within the 4-week period preceding the study.
Study Design
Subjects attended on 2 occasions, at least 1 week apart, 
and participated in a standardized training exercise in a fire 
simulation facility (exposure) or undertook light duties (control) 
in an open-label, randomized crossover design. Firefighters 
attended after a period of 48 hours off-duty to minimize the 
impact of confounding from other occupational exposures. Fire 
simulation exposure was performed at a separate dedicated 
training facility before transportation to the clinical research 
facility. During the control period, firefighters attended the 
clinical research facility and were permitted to undertake light 
activity similar to that performed during a shift without emer-
gency duties.
After each exposure, cardiovascular assessments were 
performed in a quiet, temperature-controlled room main-
tained at 22°C to 24°C with subjects lying supine. All subjects 
abstained from alcohol for 24 hours and from food, tobacco, 
and caffeine-containing drinks for at least 4 hours before each 
vascular study. Female subjects were assessed at the same 
time point of their menstrual cycle.
The primary end points were ex vivo thrombus formation, 
forearm blood flow, and net t-PA (tissue-type plasminogen acti-
vator) release. Secondary end points were platelet activation 
assessed by flow cytometry, differential cell count, plasma 
urea, creatinine, lactate, glucose, and cardiac troponin I con-
centrations, ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure monitor-
ing, and ischemic burden on 12-lead Holter monitoring.
On the basis of previous studies,17–20 ex vivo thrombus for-
mation was assessed 1 to 2 hours after each exposure, and 
forearm blood flow and t-PA release were assessed 2 to 4 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of 
death among firefighters and are responsible for 
≈45% of on-duty fatalities each year in the United 
States.
• The risk is substantially increased during fire sup-
pression duties, and is likely to reflect factors 
including physical exertion, heat, and exposure to 
air pollution.
• In healthy firefighters, we assessed the effects of 
simulated fire suppression on thrombus formation, 
platelet activation, and forearm blood flow.
• Exposure to heat and physical exertion during fire 
suppression activates platelets, increases thrombus 
formation, and impairs vascular vasomotor function 
in firefighters: all key mechanisms in the pathogen-
esis of acute myocardial infarction.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Increased thrombogenicity and impaired vascular 
function may be secondary to an increase in core 
body temperature and dehydration during fire 
suppression.
• Limiting the duration of exposure, active cooling, 
and effective rehydration are simple and inexpen-
sive ways that might mitigate the risk posed by fire 
suppression.
• These findings suggest pathogenic mechanisms to 
explain the association between fire suppression 
activity and acute myocardial infarction in suscep-
tible firefighters.

hours after each exposure. Blood samples were obtained at 
baseline, immediately, 4 hours, and 24 hours postexposure.
Subjects were fitted with a portable 12-lead ECG (Lifecard 
CF, Delmar Reynolds Medical Ltd) and blood pressure moni-
tor (Spacelabs 90217, Spacelabs) at least 30 minutes before 
and for 24 hours after exposure. On the evening before the 
fire simulation training, firefighters were asked to swallow an 
ingestible temperature monitor (CorTemp, HQInc). In cases 
where the pill was no longer in their gastrointestinal tract when 
arriving at the study site, subjects swallowed a second pill ≈30 
minutes before study commencement. Core body temperature 
was measured continuously with externally worn temperature 
loggers (CorTemp, HQInc) from 30 minutes before exposure, 
throughout the exposure, and for at least 6 hours thereafter. 
All subjects wore full personal protective equipment and self-
contained breathing apparatus for the fire simulation exposure.
Overall sweat loss was determined by the difference in 
body mass between the beginning and end of the exposure, 
and was corrected for any fluid consumption. Firefighters 
voided urine before being weighed before the fire simulation 
exposure. Participants reported their ratings of perceived exer-
tion, from 6 to 20 (very light to very, very difficult) on the Borg 
scale immediately postexposure.21
Exposures
Firefighters attended the Scottish International Fire Training 
Center, Edinburgh, for the fire simulation exposure. This is a spe-
cially designed facility consisting of steel shipping containers 
bolted together on 2 levels with the internal layout of a dwelling 
house. Fires are ignited simultaneously in 1 or 2 rooms of the 
facility 15 minutes before the fire simulation exercise starts. 
Internal temperature is monitored throughout the facility at 0.5, 
1.0, and 1.5 m above floor level. Fire simulation exposure was 
undertaken as a standardized exercise for a median duration 
of 20 minutes 22 s (range, 19 minutes 42 s to 21 minutes 6 s). 
All participants undertook the same tasks in the same order. 
This comprised entering the facility as part of a team of 4 
firefighters, ascending stairs while dragging a water-filled hose 
throughout the facility, locating and attempting to extinguish 
the fire located on the first floor, before identifying and rescu-
ing a casualty. Casualties took the form of 80-kg dummies on 
the ground floor that were lifted with assistance from a second 
firefighter and removed from the facility. The exposure was 
determined to be complete by the supervising instructor as 
soon as the firefighter stepped outside the exposure facility. 
The firefighter was immediately escorted to an adjacent out-
building where postexposure assessments were undertaken. 
After the exposure, firefighters removed their personal protec-
tive equipment and self-contained breathing apparatus. They 
were advised to rehydrate as they normally would after this 
exercise and to measure the volume of fluid they ingested. 
Weight after the exposure was corrected for the volume of fluid 
ingested to determine losses during fire simulation.
Ex Vivo Thrombosis Studies
Thrombus formation was measured using the Badimon 
chamber as described previously.18,19 In brief, a pump was 
used to draw blood from an antecubital vein through a series 
of 3 cylindrical perfusion chambers maintained at 37°C in a 
water bath. Carefully prepared strips of porcine aorta, from 
which the intima and a thin layer of media had been removed, 
acted as the thrombogenic substrate. Each study lasted for 
5 minutes during which flow was maintained at a constant 
rate of 10 mL/min. Porcine strips with thrombus attached 
were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Strips 
were wax embedded, sectioned, and stained with Masson 
Trichrome. Images were acquired at ×20 magnification, 
and the thrombus area was measured using an Ariol image 
acquisition system (Leica Microsystems GmbH) by a blinded 
operator. Results from at least 6 sections were averaged to 
determine thrombus area for each chamber, as described 
previously.18,19
Flow Cytometry
Blood was taken from an antecubital vein using a 21-gauge 
cannula and anticoagulated with d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-argi-
nine chloromethylketone (75 μm; Cambridge Biosciences) 
as previously described.22 Samples were not analyzed unless 
venesection achieved rapid and uninterrupted blood flow. Five 
minutes after sample collection, samples were stained with the 
following conjugated monoclonal antibodies: allophycocyanin-
conjugated CD14, allophycocyanin-conjugated CD36, phy-
coerythrin-conjugated CD62P, and phycoerythrin-conjugated 
CD154; phycoerythrin-conjugated CD40, fluorescein isothio-
cyanate–conjugated CD42a, and appropriate control isotypes 
(all Becton Dickinson). All antibodies were diluted 1:20. Once 
stained, samples were incubated for 20 minutes at room tem-
perature to identify P-selectin and CD40L on the platelet sur-
face and CD40 on the monocyte surface. Platelet-monocyte 
samples were fixed with FACS-Lyse (Becton Dickinson). Platelet 
samples were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Samples were 
analyzed within 24 hours using a FACSCalibur flow cytom-
eter (Becton Dickinson). Platelet-monocyte aggregates were 
defined as monocytes positive for CD14. Data analysis was 
performed using FlowJo (Treestar).
Vasomotor and Fibrinolytic Studies
All subjects underwent brachial artery cannulation with a 
27-standard wire gauge steel needle under controlled condi-
tions. After a 30-minute baseline saline infusion, acetylcholine 
at 5, 10, and 20 μg/min (endothelium-dependent vasodilator 
that does not release t-PA; Merck Biosciences); bradykinin at 
100, 300, and 1000 pmol/min (endothelium-dependent vaso-
dilator that releases t-PA; American Peptide Company); sodium 
nitroprusside at 2, 4, and 8 μg/min (endothelium-independent 
vasodilator that does not release t-PA; Hospira, Inc); and vera-
pamil at 10, 30, and 100 μg/min (endothelium- and nitric 
oxide–independent vasodilator that does not release t-PA; BGP 
Products Ltd) were infused for 6 minutes at each dose. The 4 
vasodilators were separated by 20-minute saline infusions and 
given in a randomized order, with the exception of verapamil, 
which was always given last because of the longer duration 
of action.23 Forearm blood flow was measured in infused and 
noninfused arms by venous occlusion plethysmography with 
mercury-in-silicone elastomer strain gauges as described 
previously.24
Venous cannulas (17 gauge) were inserted into large 
subcutaneous veins of the antecubital fossae of both arms. 
Blood (10 mL) was withdrawn simultaneously from each arm 
at baseline and during infusion of each dose of bradykinin

and collected into acidified buffered citrate (Stabilyte tubes, 
Biopool International) for t-PA assays and into citrate (BD 
Vacutainer) for plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 assays. 
Samples were kept on ice before being centrifuged at 2000g 
for 30 minutes at 4°C. Platelet-free plasma was decanted and 
stored at –80°C before assay.
Plasma t-PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 
antigen concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbant assays (TECHNOZYM t-PA Combi Actibind, 
Technoclone; Zymutest plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, 
Hyphen BioMed). Hematocrit was determined by capillary tube 
centrifugation at baseline and during infusion of bradykinin at 
1000 pmol/min.
Assays
Venous blood was analyzed for total cells, differential cell 
counts, and platelets by an autoanalyzer and for plasma 
urea and electrolytes, lactate, and glucose concentration in 
the regional laboratories at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. 
Plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations were deter-
mined using a high-sensitivity assay (ARCHITECTSTAT, Abbott 
Diagnostics). This assay has a limit of detection of 1.2 ng/L, an 
upper reference limit (99th centile) of 34 ng/L in men and 16 
ng/L in women.25 We previously reported an interassay coef-
ficient of variation of 12.6% at 3.5 ng/L.26
ECG Analysis
Electrographic recordings were analyzed with the use of 
the Medical Pathfinder Digital 700 Series Analysis System 
(Delmar Reynolds Medical Ltd) as previously described.27 A 
single operator, blinded to both subject characteristics and 
exposure, verified any abnormal rhythms and manually edited 
artifact and aberrant beats. Holter monitors were attached 
at least 30 minutes before the exposure period. This 30-min-
ute period was used to normalize the ST segment for each 
lead during a rest period. Thereafter, ST-segment deviation 
was calculated by comparing the ST-segment amplitude dur-
ing the first 60 minutes (including the 20-minute exposure 
period) and then across the subsequent 23-hour period. The 
ST-segment amplitude was determined at the J-point plus 50 
ms; 0.5 mm events were defined as any episode with ≥0.5 
mm ST-segment depression lasting at least 1 minute. The 
ischemic burden during each exposure was calculated as the 
product of the change in the ST-segment amplitude and the 
duration of the exposure. Leads II, V2, and V5 were selected 
a priori for ST-segment analysis to reflect separate regions 
of the myocardium. The maximum ST-segment depression 
and ischemic burden were determined for each lead and as 
a composite.27
Data Analysis and Statistics
Continuous variables are reported as mean±standard error 
of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed with 
GraphPad Prism, version 5.0 (Graph Pad Software) by 2-way 
analysis of variance with repeated measures and 2-tailed 
Student paired t test, or Wilcoxon signed-rank as appropri-
ate. Cardiac troponin I concentrations were log transformed 
before analysis. Statistical significance was taken at 2-sided 
P<0.05.
RESULTS
Nineteen healthy nonsmoking firefighters (mean age, 
41±7 years; 16 males) were enrolled (Table 1). Seven-
teen firefighters had both exposures; 2 firefighters un-
able to complete the study were excluded.
The average maximum temperature in the fire simu-
lation facility was 406.2±13.5°C. Mean core tempera-
ture was at 37.4±0.1°C at baseline and peaked at 
38.4±0.1°C. Body weight reduced by 0.46±0.14 kg. 
Heart rate and temperature rose rapidly and were asso-
ciated with asymptomatic ST-segment depression during 
fire simulation exposure (analysis of variance P<0.01 for 
all; Figure 1). Perceived exertion was rated as 14±0.2 
on the Borg scale.
Thrombus Formation and Platelet Activation
In comparison with the control period, thrombus for-
mation was increased after fire simulation exposure by 
73% in the low-shear chamber (change in thrombus area 
5781 μm2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3340–8221 
μm2; P<0.001) and by 66% in the high-shear chamber 
(change in thrombus area 6563 μm2; 95% CI, 3481–
9645 μm2; P<0.001, Figure 2). Platelet-monocyte ag-
gregation differed at baseline between control and fire 
simulation exposure, but was increased after fire simula-
tion (7%; 95% CI, 0%–13%; P=0.03) and was unchanged 
across the control period (–6%; 95% CI, –15% to 1%; 
P=0.09, Figure 2). Platelet surface expression of P-se-
lectin and CD40 ligand were similar after control and fire 
simulation exposure (P>0.05 for both).
Vascular Vasomotor and Fibrinolytic Function
After fire simulation exposure, both systolic and diastol-
ic blood pressures were lower immediately before the 
vascular studies in comparison with the control period 
(systolic blood pressure 125±2 versus 134±3 mm 
Hg, 
diastolic blood pressure 75±2 versus 82±2 mm 
Hg; 
P<0.01 for both). Basal forearm blood flow was higher 
at baseline after fire simulation exposure in comparison 
with the control period (2.3±0.2 versus 1.7±0.1 mL·100 
mL–1·min–1; P=0.01). After the administration of ace-
tylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside, and vera-
pamil, there were dose-dependent increases in forearm 
blood flow after both fire simulation and control periods 
(P<0.001, Figure 3). Vasodilatation expressed as a ratio 
of forearm blood flow in the infused and control arms 
was attenuated in response to acetylcholine (P=0.01) 
and sodium nitroprusside (P=0.004) in comparison with 
control, but was unaffected by bradykinin or verapamil 
infusions (P>0.05 for both).
Bradykinin caused a dose-dependent increase in 
plasma t-PA antigen concentrations (P<0.001). After 
fire simulation exposure, there was a doubling of the net

release of t-PA antigen in comparison with control (area 
under the curve, 51.9 versus 27.9 ng·100 mL–1·min–1; 
P=0.006, Figure 2).
Secondary End Points
There were increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, 
and total leukocytes immediately after fire simulation in 
comparison with control (hemoglobin 149±3 versus 138±3 
g/L, hematocrit 0.43±0.01 versus 0.40±0.01, platelets 
305±15 versus 234±10×109 cells/L, total leukocytes 
7.4±0.6 versus 5.9±0.2×109 cells/L; P<0.05 for all, 
Table 1). Total leukocytes remained elevated at 6 hours post-
exposure in comparison with the control period (7.5±0.4 
versus 6.1±0.2×109 cells/L; P<0.05). Serum lactate was 
increased immediately after fire simulation exposure reflect-
ed by a corresponding fall in bicarbonate concentrations 
(lactate 3.7±0.5 versus 1.0±0.1 mmol/L, bicarbonate 
20±0.7 versus 25±0.4 mmol/L; P<0.05 for both).
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration in-
creased 1 hour after fire simulation in comparison 
with control (3.0 [1.7–6.4] versus 1.5 [1.3–2.9])ng/L, 
P=0.010). There was a significant increase in the num-
ber of episodes of ST-segment depression exceeding 
0.5 mm, maximum ST-segment depression, and cumula-
tive ischemic burden during fire simulation exposure in 
comparison with the control period (P<0.05 for all), but 
these parameters did not differ across the subsequent 
23-hour period (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
After a short exposure to fire simulation training, we 
demonstrate changes in physiological measures of 
cardiovascular function. This is the first study to dem-
onstrate that participation in fire simulation results in 
increased ex vivo thrombus formation along with en-
hanced platelet activation and impairment of vasomotor

endothelial function: all key mechanisms in the patho-
genesis of acute myocardial infarction. It is intriguing 
that fire simulation was associated with evidence of 
minor myocardial injury and asymptomatic myocardial 
ischemia. Taken together, this comprehensive cardio-
vascular assessment has detected plausible mechanis-
tic links between participation in fire suppression duties 
and acute myocardial infarction.
Participation in fire simulation training places an in-
ordinate strain on the cardiovascular system. By under-
taking a comprehensive physiological assessment that 
included continuous core body temperature and hemo-
dynamic monitoring, we are able to demonstrate the ef-
fect that heat and physical exertion has on a range of 
physiological and cardiovascular health measures. We 
reveal a significant loss of body weight secondary to de-
hydration in association with a temperature rise of 1°C, 
lactic acidosis, and leukocytosis. It is unsurprising that 
this was associated with an acute increase in heart rate 
and relative hypotension over the following 3 to 4 hours 
as the subjects returned to normothermia.
For the first time, we demonstrate an increase in 
ex vivo thrombus formation in response to fire simula-
tion exposure that is perhaps not surprising given the 
associated hemoconcentration. The Badimon chamber 
is a well-validated ex vivo model of thrombosis permit-
ting measurement of thrombus formation in native whole 
blood in conditions that simulate coronary arteries after 
plaque disruption.18,28,29 The degree of thrombus forma-
tion demonstrated in healthy firefighters after a short fire 
simulation exposure is notable. Our group has previously 
reported an increase in ex vivo thrombus formation after 
diesel exhaust exposure,18 but the degree of thrombus 
formation in the current study was >3-fold greater. This is 
likely to be explained by systemic inflammation together 
with presumed sympathetic activation, the combination 
of which stimulates platelets and activates coagulation 
pathways. Moreover, the increased thrombogenicity at-
tributable to dehydration further compounds this effect, 
resulting in a substantial increase in thrombus formation. 
Others have previously demonstrated a 24% increase 
in platelet count and an increase in platelet aggregabil-

Core temperature and heart rate rapidly increased during the fire simulation accompanied by asymptomatic ST-segment depres-
sion. Core temperature remained increased for 120 minutes, and ST segments returned to baseline gradually during the same 
time period. Mean arterial pressure was unchanged throughout. Values are mean±95% confidence interval.

ity.11 Alongside demonstrating a 31% increase in plate-
let count, we use a more robust assessment of platelet 
activation by flow cytometry and have demonstrated an 
increase in platelet-monocyte aggregates after fire simu-
lation, suggesting that increased thrombus formation is 
at least in part mediated by platelet activation.
We observed an increase in endothelial tissue plas-
minogen activator release from the vascular endothe-
lium in response to intra-arterial bradykinin infusion after 
fire simulation exposure, and this is likely to be compen-
satory in response to the marked prothrombotic state. 
Previous studies have shown that plasma t-PA antigen 
concentrations increase in parallel with increased co-
agulation in the early phase after both submaximal exer-
cise30,31 and a similar fire simulation exposure.7 However 
this fibrinolytic response diminishes within 2 hours with 
a persistent imbalance of thrombosis and fibrinolysis in 
favor of a prothrombotic state. This perhaps explains the 
ongoing susceptibility to cardiac events in firefighters be-
yond the immediate postexposure period. Furthermore, 
it has been previously established that creating a proin-
flammatory state in the vascular endothelium results in a 
sustained and substantial increase in endothelial tissue 
plasminogen activator while simultaneously impairing en-
dothelial vasomotor function.32 A limitation of our study 
is that we did not assess t-PA release at a later time 
point, when any systemic inflammatory response to fire 
simulation is likely to be more marked.
Previous work by Tei and colleagues33 has demon-
strated that exposure to heat alone in the form of a hot 
water bath or sauna, increased core body temperature 
by 1.2°C and reduced systemic vascular resistance dur-
ing and for up to 30 minutes after exposure in patients 
with heart failure. The authors conclude that regular heat 
exposure could have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular 
physiology in these patients. Although we demonstrate a 
similar increase in core temperature after fire simulation, 
the additional physical and psychological effects of fire 
suppression are distinct. Furthermore, we evaluated vas-
cular function 2 hours after exposure when core body 
temperature had nearly returned to baseline. In a set-
ting similar to our study, Fahs and colleagues5 revealed 
an increase in arterial stiffness together with increases 
in forearm blood flow and reactive hyperemia after fire 
simulation as measured noninvasively by venous occlu-
sion plethysmography. Limited conclusions were drawn

Thrombus formation ex vivo was increased in response to fire simulation in under both low-shear and high-shear conditions in 
comparison with control (Student t test, P<0.001 for both, A and B, respectively). Platelet-monocyte aggregates were increased 
after fire simulation exposure in comparison with control (Student t test, P=0.004, n=12, C). Where venipuncture and sample 
processing resulted in significant ex vivo platelet activation, data were excluded from further analysis by a researcher blinded 
to the exposure. There was a dose-dependent increase in t-PA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) in response to bradykinin in 
both exposures (2-way ANOVA with repeated measures, P<0.001), that was augmented after fire simulation in comparison with 
control (ANOVA, P=0.006, D). ANOVA indicates analysis of variance.

from this study given the apparently opposing vascular 
effects demonstrated. In contrast, we used venous oc-
clusion plethysmography with intra-arterial infusion of 
vasodilators, widely regarded as the gold-standard as-
sessment of endothelial vasomotor function. Although 
forearm blood flow after fire simulation exposure was 
elevated because of systemic vasodilatation, we demon-
strated a detrimental effect on endothelium-dependent 
and -independent vasodilatation after exposure to fire 
simulation by reporting the change in blood flow as a 
ratio of the infused to noninfused arms to account for 
systemic vasodilatation.
The endothelium is a major target for inflammation and 
consequent oxidative stress with impairment of endotheli-
al vasomotor function being associated with an increased 
risk of acute cardiovascular events, including cardiovas-
cular death.34,35 It is conceivable that the proinflammatory 
state created by exposure to fire simulation accounts for 
the attenuated response to acetylcholine and sodium 
nitroprusside whose vasodilatory actions are mediated 
by nitric oxide. We postulate that oxygen free radicals 
scavenge nitric oxide, thus reducing its bioavailability. By 
contrast, there was no impairment of vasomotor function 
with bradykinin or verapamil after either exposure. This 
would suggest that impaired vasodilatation to acetylcho-
line and sodium nitroprusside is not simply a manifes-
tation of altered basal tone or systemic vasodilatation. 
Bradykinin causes vasodilatation primarily through the re-
lease of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and 
prostaglandins, and therefore the vasomotor response to 
bradykinin infusion may be less susceptible to the acute 
effects of oxidative stress. Alternatively, active vasodila-
tation during whole body heat stress may be mediated by 
the cyclooxygenase pathway,36 which could also explain 
the lack of attenuation in forearm vasomotor response to 
bradykinin after fire simulation exposure. It is likely that 
vasodilatation is mediated by upregulated prostanoids 
in this setting and counteracts the impairment of nitric 
oxide–mediated dilatation resulting in a neutral response 
to bradykinin administration.
We have demonstrated small increases in plasma 
high-sensitivity troponin I concentrations after fire sup-

There was a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow with each vasodilator (2-way ANOVA with repeated measures,

attenuated in response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (P=0.01 and P=0.004, A and B, respectively) after fire simula-
tion in comparison with control. There was no difference in forearm blood flow in response to bradykinin or verapamil (P>0.05

pression exposure. Previous studies have reported a 
link between endurance exercise and cardiac troponin 
release.37–39 The magnitude of increase in troponin 
postexercise is related to exercise intensity and car-
diovascular physiology. In a recent meta-analysis, there 
was a pooled increase in cardiac troponin I from base-
line of 40 ng/L (95% CI, 21.4–58 ng/L) and in cardiac 
troponin T of 26 ng/L (95% CI, 5.2–46) after prolonged 
endurance exercise with a mean exercise duration of 
229 minutes.39 We used a high-sensitivity cardiac tro-
ponin I assay with excellent precision at very low con-
centrations in this study26,40 and were able to observe 
a small increase in cardiac troponin I concentrations 
in all subjects after only 20 minutes of fire suppres-
sion training. In addition, we demonstrate ST-segment 
depression on ambulatory monitoring and periods of 
asymptomatic myocardial ischemia during and imme-
diately after fire simulation exposure. The firefighters 
in this study were healthy with no risk factors for, and 
no known underlying coronary artery disease. Although 
cardiac troponin I concentrations remained within the 
normal reference range and the degree of myocardial 
ischemia was relatively small, it is plausible that these 
changes represent direct cardiac injury and the cardio-
toxic effect of cytokines such as tumor necrosis fac-
tor, heat shock protein, or oxygen free radicals. Alter-
natively this may represent an oxygen supply-demand 
mismatch causing myocardial injury at the extremes of 
physical exertion.41 Further studies would be required 
comparing the effects of fire suppression with the ef-
fects of an equivalent period of physical exercise in the 
absence of fire suppression to determine the mecha-
nism of myocardial injury.
The measured maximal heart rates in this study were 
similar to those in other fire simulation studies.10,16,42–44 
Despite the apparent strenuous exertion, the fire simula-
tion exposure was graded by subjects as strenuous, yet 
not very hard on the Borg Scale. Ratings of perceived 
exertion are commonly used in simulated real fire ex-
ercises. However, there is generally poor correlation 
between perceived exertion and heart rate, with most 
subjects grading exercises as less strenuous than their 
heart rates would otherwise suggest. This raises an 
important safety issue and questions if firefighters are 
aware they are working at the limits of their physiological 
capabilities.
Fire simulation exposure undoubtedly is not ac-
curately representative of real-life fire suppression, 
which is the main limitation of this study. In real-life fire 
suppression, the physiological stresses demonstrated 
in this fire simulation will undoubtedly be compounded 
by uncontrolled and higher ambient temperatures, 
multiple entries into the same fire, and the potential 
psychological stress of attending an unknown and 
dangerous situation where one’s life and the lives of 
others are at risk. All firefighters involved in this study

were familiar with the fire simulation center and the ex-
ercise undertaken owing to previous attendances for 
annual training. If we can extrapolate the findings of 
this study to a real-life fire suppression scenario, we 
would surmise that firefighters would have higher core 
temperatures, given a higher ambient temperature, 
that are unable to return to baseline given multiple 
entries to the same fire within a short time frame when 
there is often inadequate time for active cooling or re-
hydration before reentry. Further studies are required 
outside a fire training facility to assess the effects 
of real-life fire suppression that will encompass the 
additional triggers of psychological stress and air pol-
lution, not assessed here, but undertaking such stud-
ies will undoubtedly prove logistically challenging. In 
addition, although we have been able to demonstrate 
that the combination of extreme heat and physical ex-
ertion is detrimental to many measures of cardiovas-
cular function, we did not undertake a comparison of 
fire simulation exposure to an exposure consisting of 
either heat or exercise alone to assess the effect of 
each individual component on cardiovascular function. 
However, in this study we wished to simulate the ef-
fects of a real-life fire suppression activity as closely 
as possible, and, in reality, firefighters are never ex-
posed to heat without physical exertion and neither 
is avoidable for them. Further experimental studies 
would be required to be undertaken to explore each of 
these components separately.
Our study has important implications for firefighters 
participating in fire simulation training. If the increased 
thrombogenicity and impaired vascular function ob-
served in our study is secondary to an increase in core 
body temperature and dehydration, then limiting the du-
ration of exposure, active cooling, and effective rehydra-
tion would be simple and inexpensive ways to mitigate 
the risk posed by fire simulation training.
In conclusion, exposure to extreme heat and physi-
cal exertion during simulated fire suppression increases 
thrombogenicity, impairs vascular function, and causes 
myocardial injury in healthy firefighters. Our findings sug-
gest the pathogenic mechanisms to explain the associa-
tion between fire suppression activity and acute myocar-
dial infarction in susceptible firefighters.
