INTRODUCTION: As we come to appreciate
how our microbial communities (microbiota)
assemble following birth, there is an opportu-
nity to determine how this facet of our devel-
opmental biology relates to the healthy or
impaired growth of infants and children. Child-
hood undernutrition is a devastating global
health problem whose long-term sequelae,
including stunting, neurodevelopmental ab-
normalities, and immune dysfunction, re-
main largely refractory to current therapeutic
interventions.
RATIONALE: To test the hypothesis that per-
turbations in the normal development of the
gut microbiota are causally related to under-
nutrition, we first applied random forests
(RF), a machine learning method, to bacterial
16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from
fecal samples that were collected serially from
healthy Malawian infants and children during
their first 3 postnatal years. Age-discriminatory
bacterial taxa were identified with distinctive
time-dependent changes in their relative abun-
dances; they were used to construct a sparse
RF-derived model describing a program of
normal postnatal gut microbiota development
that is shared across biologically unrelated
individuals. A metric based on this model
(microbiota-for-age Z-score) was used to de-
fine the state of development (maturation) of
fecal microbiota from infants and children
with varying degrees of undernutrition. Fecal
samples obtained from 6- and 18-month-old
children with healthy growth patterns or with
varying degrees of undernutrition were trans-
planted into young germ-free mice that were
fed a representative Malawian diet. The recip-
ient animals’ rate of lean body mass gain was
characterized by serial quantitative magnetic
resonance, their metabolic phenotypes were de-
termined by targeted mass spectrometry, and
their femoral bone morphologic features were
delineated by microcomputed tomography.
RESULTS: Undernourished children in the
Malawian birth cohort that we studied have
immature gut microbiota. Unlike microbiota
from healthy children, immature microbiota
transmit impaired growth, altered bone mor-
phology, and metabolic abnormalities in the
muscle, liver, and brain to recipient gnoto-
biotic mice. The representation of several
age-discriminatory taxa in the transplanted mi-
crobiota harbored by recipient animals corre-
lated with their growth rates. Microbiota from
6-month-old infants produced greater effects
on growth than did microbiota from 18-month-
old children, although in each age bin, the growth
effects produced by a healthy donor’s commu-
nity were greater than those produced by an
undernourished donor’s community. Cohousing
coprophagic mice shortly after they received
microbiota from healthy
or severely stunted and
underweight 6-month-old
infants resulted in the in-
vasion of age- and growth-
discriminatory taxa from
the former into the latter
microbiota in the recipient animals, with as-
sociated prevention of growth impairments.
Introducing cultured members from this group
of invasive species ameliorated growth and
metabolic abnormalities in recipients of micro-
biota from undernourished donors.
CONCLUSION: These preclinical findings pro-
vide evidence that gut microbiota immaturity is
causally related to childhood undernutrition.
The age- and growth-discriminatory taxa that
we identified should help direct studies of the
effects of host and environmental factors on gut
microbial community development, and they
represent therapeutic targets for repairing or
preventing gut microbiota immaturity.▪

Preclinical evidence that gut microbiota immaturity is causally related to childhood under-
nutrition. (A) A model of normal gut microbial community development in Malawian infants and
children, based on the relative abundances of 25 bacterial taxa that provide a microbial signature
defining the “age,
” or state of maturation, of an individual’s (fecal) microbiota. (Hierarchical cluster-
ings of operational taxonomic units are indicated on the left.) (B) Fecal samples from healthy (H) or
stunted and underweight (Un) infants and children were transplanted into separate groups of young
germ-free mice that were fed a Malawian diet. The immature microbiota of Un donors transmitted
impaired growth phenotypes to the mice. (C) Evidence that a subset of age-discriminatory taxa are
also growth-discriminatory. Cohousing mice shortly after they received microbiota from 6-month-old
healthy or undernourished donors resulted in the invasion of taxa from the healthy donor’s
microbiota (HCH) into the undernourished donor’s microbiota (UnCH) among recipient animals and
prevented growth impairments. Adding cultured invasive growth-discriminatory taxa directly to the
Un donor’s microbiota (Un+) improved growth.

Undernourished children exhibit impaired development of their gut microbiota.
Transplanting microbiota from 6- and 18-month-old healthy or undernourished Malawian
donors into young germ-free mice that were fed a Malawian diet revealed that immature
microbiota from undernourished infants and children transmit impaired growth
phenotypes. The representation of several age-discriminatory taxa in recipient animals
correlated with lean body mass gain; liver, muscle, and brain metabolism; and bone
morphology. Mice were cohoused shortly after receiving microbiota from healthy or
severely stunted and underweight infants; age- and growth-discriminatory taxa from the
microbiota of the former were able to invade that of the latter, which prevented growth
impairments in recipient animals. Adding two invasive species, Ruminococcus gnavus and
Clostridium symbiosum, to the microbiota from undernourished donors also ameliorated
growth and metabolic abnormalities in recipient animals. These results provide evidence
that microbiota immaturity is causally related to undernutrition and reveal potential
therapeutic targets and agents.
U
ndernutrition is a leading cause of infant
and childhood mortality worldwide (1–5).
The mechanisms that underlie this disor-
der’s manifestations, ranging from persistent
abnormalities in growth and immune func-
tion to cognitive deficits, remain obscure. Child-
hood undernutrition is not due to food insecurity
alone; it also results from a combination of fac-
tors including diets with low nutrient density or
bioavailability, pathogen burden, and gut muco-
sal barrier dysfunction (6–8).
The World Health Organization has used a
cohort of 8440 healthy children living in six
countries to develop anthropometric standards
that define nutritional status [weight-for-height
Z-score (WHZ), weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ),
and height-for-age Z-score (HAZ)] (9, 10). A re-
cent study (11) of infants and children with
healthy growth phenotypes living in Mirpur,
an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, involved
monthly fecal collection from birth through
the end of the second year of life. In this study,
a 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) analysis of bacterial
membership in the gut microbiota and the ap-
plication of a machine learning method [random
forests (RF) (12)] revealed 24 “age-discriminatory”
taxa, whose changes in relative abundance over
time define a program of normal maturation of
the microbiota across biologically unrelated in-
dividuals (11). This model served as the basis for
computing two related metrics, relative micro-
biota maturity and microbiota-for-age Z-score
(MAZ), that significantlycorrelatedwith thechron-
ological age of children with healthy growth phe-
notypes. Applying these metrics showed that
children living in Mirpur with moderate acute
malnutrition (MAM) or severe acute malnutrition
(SAM) have gut microbiota that are “immature;”
in other words, the representation of the age-
discriminatory taxa in their gut communities was
more similar to younger than to age-matched
healthy individuals from the same locale. More-
over, the degree of this immaturity was greater in
SAM than MAM (11). Treatment of children with
SAM with either one of two ready-to-use thera-
peutic foods produced only incomplete and tran-
sient improvement in this immaturity and no
improvement in their HAZ scores (11).
These findings raise several questions. To what
extent are these age-discriminatory taxa also
indicative of the normal development of the
gut microbiota of infants and children elsewhere?
Are the age-discriminatory taxa biomarkers of
gut microbiota development, or are they media-
tors of healthy growth? If the latter, can their
introduction into immature microbiota prevent
disease?
A Malawian model of gut
microbiota development
To address these questions, we first developed a
RF-based model of gut microbial community de-
velopment from a serially sampled cohort of
Malawian twins that were concordant for healthy
growth. We investigated correlations between
nutritional status and microbiota maturation to
ascertain whether an MAZ score could predict
future growth performance.
In a previous study, we followed a cohort of
317 twin pairs and three sets of triplets, living in
five rural villages in southern Malawi, from birth
to 36 months of age, with periodic sampling of
their fecal microbiota (13). To define healthy mi-
crobiota development in this population, we
took the polymerase chain reaction amplicons
generated from variable region 4 (V4) of bacte-
rial 16S rRNA genes and sequenced them. We
used 220 fecal samples collected from 27 twin
pairs and two sets of triplets whose serial an-
thropometric measurements were indicative of
consistently healthy growth [WHZ = 0.09 ±
0.93; fecal collection over an age range of 0.6
to 33.5 months; 4.0 ± 1.6 samples (mean ± SD)
per individual; tables S1A and S2A provide mi-
crobiota donor characteristics and a summary
of sequencing data sets]. V4 16S rRNA reads
with ≥97% nucleotide sequence identity were
grouped into operational taxonomic units (97%
ID OTUs), and taxonomic assignments were made
(14, 15).
We modeled microbiota maturation in these
healthy Malawian infants and children by using
RF to regress OTUs against chronological age in
a subset (“training set”) of the healthy twin co-
hort (Fig. 1A). The application of the training set–
based model to the subset excluded from model
building (“test set”) yielded a positive and signif-
icant correlation between host chronological age
and predicted microbiota age (coefficient of de-
termination R2 = 0.80, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C and
fig. S1). The model was further validated using
an additional randomized nutritional interven-
tion trial that took place in the Mangochi
district of southern Malawi, in which subjects
were studied at 6, 12, and 18 months of age [the

 iLiNS-DYAD-M study (16)]. We again saw a pos-
itive and significant correlation between chron-
ological age and predicted microbiota age (R2 =
0.71, P < 0.0001). Multiple OTUs from the sparse
Malawian model had ≥97% sequence identity to
OTUs in the sparse Bangladeshi model (Fig. 1A
and table S3B) (11).
We then used the Malawian RF-derived model
to analyze the relationship between microbiota
maturity and nutritional status in 259 children
enrolled in iLiNS-DYAD-M who had fewer than
three reported days of antibiotic consumption
from 6 to 18 months of age (table S1B). There
was a significant positive correlation between
their MAZ scores and their WHZ (Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient r = 0.1664, P = 0.0073)
and WAZ scores (r = 0.1715, P = 0.0056) but not
their HAZ scores (r = 0.1022, P = 0.1) (table
S2B). There was a significant correlation be-
tween MAZ at 12 months and anthropometry at
18 months [r = 0.1406 and P = 0.02 for WHZ; r =
0.1373 and P = 0.02 for WAZ (for HAZ, r =
0.1184 and P = 0.05)]. These results suggest
that MAZ may be useful for predicting future
(ponderal) growth. Further studies and analy-
ses are required to discern the effects of several
variables, such as the duration of prior antibiotic
use, enteropathogen load, number of diarrheal
days, geography, and various nutritional inter-
ventions, on the relationship of MAZ measure-
ments at various postnatal ages to anthropometry
and other metrics of healthy growth (e.g., cogni-
tive testing and immunization responses).
Identification of age-discriminatory taxa
that are also growth-discriminatory
To test whether there is a causal relationship be-
tween microbiota maturity and growth, we se-
lected fecal samples from 19 Malawian donors
representing either healthy or undernourished
growth phenotypes for transplantation into
5-week-old, actively growing germ-free C57BL/
6J mice. Of the 19 donor samples, nine were from
6-month-old infants, four of which were classi-
fied as healthy [WHZ = 1.45 ± 0.57 (mean ± SD),
WAZ = 1.75 ± 0.56, and HAZ = 1.27 ± 0.45] and
five of which were classified as moderately or se-
verely underweight and stunted (WHZ = –1.27 ±
0.49, WAZ = –3.90 ± 1.82, and HAZ = –4.36 ± 2.07).
Ten samples were from 18-month-old children,
four with healthy weights (WHZ = 1.44 ± 0.08,
WAZ = –0.3 ± 0.57, and HAZ = –2.84 ± 0.99) and
six who were moderately or severely underweight
and stunted (WHZ = –1.75 ± 0.17, WAZ = –2.88 ±
0.42, and HAZ = –3.28 ± 0.82) (table S4A includes
MAZ metrics; all 18-month-old donors were
members of twin pairs, in which HAZ scores
are typically lower than in singletons, and all
6-month-old donors were singletons). Fecal sam-
ples from the 18-month-old children were from the
Malawi twin cohort; the 6-month-old microbiota
donors were participants in the iLiNS-DYAD-M
study who had not yet received a nutritional
supplement.
Each microbiota sample was transplanted into
a separate group of 5-week-old male germ-free
mice (N = 5 animals per sample). Three days

lets. (A) A RF regression of fecal bacterial
97% ID OTUs from a training set of healthy
Malawian infants and children (N = 31) on
chronological age yielded a rank order of
age-discriminatory taxa. RF assigns a mean
squared error (MSE), or feature importance
score, to each OTU; this metric indicates the
extent to which each OTU contributes to the
accuracy of the model. The 25 most age-
discriminatory taxa, ranked by MSE, yielded a sparse model that predicted microbiota age and
accounted for ~80% of the observed variance in the healthy cohort (table S3A gives a complete list of
OTUs and MSE values). The top 25 most discriminatory OTUs with their taxonomic assignments are
shown ranked by feature importance (mean ± SD of the increase in MSE).The inset shows the results of
10-fold cross-validation; as OTUs are added to the model in order of their feature importance rank, the
model’s error decreases. Taxa highlighted in red indicate OTUs with >97% nucleotide sequence identity
with an OTU present in a sparse RF-based model of microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi
infants and children (11). (B) A heat map of changes over time in the relative abundances of the 25 OTUs

Downloaded from 
 before transplantation, all mice were switched
onto a sterile (irradiated) Malawian diet formu-
lated based on the results of a dietary survey of the
complementary feeding practices for 9-month-old
Malawian children enrolled in the iLiNS-DOSE
study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00945698)
that took place in the Mangochi district. We se-
lected eight ingredients to produce a cooked
diet representative of that consumed by Malawian
children (M8; see the supplementary materials);
its micro- and macronutrient content does not
fulfill the needs of humans or mice (table S5, A
and B, gives a list of ingredients and the results
of a direct nutritional analysis).
After a single gavage of the donor microbiota,
recipient mice were observed for 4 to 5 weeks
(Fig. 2A shows the experimental design). Fecal
samples were collected for bacterial V4 16S rRNA
analysis. Growth was monitored by serial mea-
surements of total body weight and body com-
position [lean mass and fat mass, as defined by
quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR)]; after
euthanasia, femurs were removed for micro-
computed tomographic (micro-CT) characteri-
zation of bone morphology.
Mice colonized with microbiota from healthy
donors (N = 8 donors) gained significantly more
weight and lean body mass than mice colonized
with microbiota from undernourished donors
(N = 11) [P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively,
determined by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA); table S6, A and B], yet there was no
significant difference in food consumption be-
tween the groups (P > 0.05, determined by
Student’s t test; table S7). 16S rRNA sequencing
of fecal samples obtained from recipient mice
revealed variable transplantation efficiency. Of
the 19 donor samples, eight produced trans-
plantation efficiencies of ≥50%. When we re-
stricted our analysis to the eight donor samples
producing ≥50% transplantation efficiency, the
discordant growth phenotypes between recipi-
ents of healthy versus undernourished micro-
biota were pronounced (weight gain, P < 0.0001;
lean mass gain, P = 0.0005; two-way ANOVA;
Fig. 2, B and C). There was no significant differ-
ence in fat mass gain (P = 0.78, two-way ANOVA;
table S6B) or food consumption between the
groups (P > 0.05, Student’s t test; tables S6, A and
B, and S7).
For both the 6-month and 18-month age bins,
mice colonized with healthy donor microbiota
gained significantly more total body weight and
lean massthan those colonizedwith undernourished
donor microbiota (weight, P = 0.0003 and P =
0.0043 for recipients of the 6- and 18-month-old
donor microbiota, respectively; lean mass, P = 0.03
and P = 0.0013, respectively; two-way ANOVA;
table S6, A and B). Recipients of microbiota from
healthy or undernourished 6-month-old donors
grew more than recipients of microbiota from
18-month-old healthy or undernourished donors
(P < 0.0001 for healthy and P < 0.0001 for under-
nourished, based on lean mass gain; two-way
ANOVA).
Growth over the course of the 5-week experi-
ment in the 19 different groups of recipient mice
ranged from 107 to 156% of the starting weight
(averaged per group; table S6A). There was no
significant relationship between growth pheno-
types and bacterial diversity in the fecal microbiota
of recipient animals (table S6A). We applied
RF to regress the growth phenotypes of recipient
gnotobiotic mice against 97% ID OTUs identi-
fied in their fecal microbiota. Two models were

Fig. 2. Transplantation of microbiota from 6- and 18-month-old donors
to young germ-free mice provides evidence of a causal relationship
between gut microbiota maturity and growth phenotypes. (A) Experi-
mental design of the microbiota screen. Mice (4.5 weeks old) were switched
to the M8 diet 3 days before gavage with the selected microbiota donor’s
fecal sample (N = 5 mice per donor). Fecal samples, body weight, and body
composition were defined at the indicated time. (B and C) Gnotobiotic mice
colonized with fecal samples from healthy donors gain more total body
weight (B) and lean mass (C) than mice colonized with microbiota from
undernourished donors (the graphs show means ± SEM; P values shown
for the donor status effect are based on two-way ANOVA). All recipient
mice harbor microbiota that represent ≥50% of the OTU diversity that is
present in the intact uncultured donor’s sample. (D) The 30 most weight
gain–discriminatory OTUs and their taxonomic assignments, ranked by
feature importance (the bar graph shows increase in mean MSEs ± SD).
The weight gain model explained ~66% of the observed phenotypic var-
iation (P < 0.0001, determined by a permutation test with 999 permuta-
tions).T
axa in red indicate OTUs that appear within the 30 most discriminatory
OTUs for the RF-based models of both weight and lean mass gain. Taxa in
purple indicate species that appear in the 25-member sparse RF-derived
model of Malawian gut microbiota maturation. Colors to the right of the
OTU ID numbers represent Spearman’s rank correlation of the same OTU ID
with chronological age within the healthy Malawian infant and child cohort

Fig. 3. Cohousing results in the transfer of species from the microbiota
of cagemates colonized with the healthy donor’s community into the
microbiota of cagemates colonized with the severely stunted and under-
weight donor’s community, resulting in the prevention of growth impair-
ments. (A) Experimental design for the cohousing experiments. Dually housed
4.5-week-old mice were switched to the M8 diet and colonized 3 days later
with intact uncultured microbiota from either the healthy or the stunted and
underweight donor. Four days post-colonization (dpc), subsets of the mice
were cohoused (HCH and UnCH), while control mice colonized with microbiota
from the healthy or stunted and underweight donors remained in their original
isolators and were paired with a new cagemate from that isolator (H-H and
Un-Un controls). Fecal samples were collected throughout the experiment;
growth was assayed by changes in total body weight and body composition
(the latter by qMR). Mice were euthanized three weeks after colonization.
(B) HCH and UnCH mice had significantly higher lean mass gain (indicated by
the asterisks) relative to the Un-Un controls 15 days after colonization (Un-Un
versus HCH, P = 0.0447; Un-Un versus UnCH, P = 0.0121; Mann-Whitney test;
N = 6 cages of cohoused mice and 3 cages of each dually housed control
group; two independent experiments). (C) Heat map showing the results of
the invasion assay. T
o quantify invasion further, we used the mean and SD of
the null distribution of invasion scores (defined as the scores from recipients
of the H or Un donor’s microbiota that had never been cohoused with each
other) to calculate a z value (standard score) and a Benjamini-Hochberg ad-
justed P value for the invasion score of each species in HCH and UnCH mice
(see the supplementary materials). We defined a taxon as a successful invader
if it (i) had a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P ≤ 0.05 and (ii) had a relative
abundance of ≤0.05% before cohousing and ≥0.5% in the fecal microbiota at
the time of euthanasia.Table S12 provides information about the direction and
success of invasion. Each row represents a species-level taxon, and each
column represents a mouse at a given day after colonization.The rows of the
heat map were hierarchically clustered according to pairwise distances using
Pearson correlation. Bars at the right side of each experimental arm repre-
sent the fold change (fc) in that species’ relative abundance before and after
cohousing [fold change is defined as the log2 of the average relative abun-
dance of the species after cohousing (days 7 through 22), divided by the
average relative abundance of the species before cohousing (day 4)]. Species
in red represent those identified as one of the top 30 growth-discriminatory taxa
by the RF-based models of weight or lean mass gain shown in Fig. 2.

icantly correlated with age in the cohort of healthy
Malawian twins and triplets (P < 0.0001 for all

The relationship between age- and
growth-discriminatory taxa and femoral
bone phenotypes
We used micro-CT to assay the morphology of
trabecular and cortical regions of femurs ob-
tained from mice harboring microbiota with
≥50% transplantation efficiency. There were
strong trends toward higher cortical ratios of
bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV) and
volumetric bone mineral density in recipients
of gut microbial communities from undernour-
ished donors (P = 0.05 and P = 0.07, respectively;
Mann-Whitney test). Differences between mice
harboring microbiota from 6- and 18-month-
old donors were evident in trabecular rather
than in cortical bone, regardless of donor nu-
tritional status; mice colonized with 6-month-
old donor communities had significantly higher
bone mineral density, BV/TV, and trabecular
connectivity and number, as well as significantly
lower trabecular spacing, irrespective of their
nutritional status (P < 0.001 for all bone metrics;
Mann-Whitney test; fig. S3). We extended our
RF and Spearman ranked correlation analyses
to identify OTUs that discriminate these femoral
bone phenotypes (fig. S4 and table S10). Six of
the OTUs represented in both of the growth-
discriminatory RF-based models, including one
assigned to B. longum, were also represented
among the top 20 most discriminatory features
in at least three of the five RF-based models of
bone metrics (fig. S4). Although our sample size
was small, these results provide additional evi-
dence for microbiota-dependent regulation of
bone morphology (17), with the effects being in-
fluenced by the age and nutritional status of the
donor.
Repairing impaired growth phenotypes
We next determined whether age- and growth-
discriminatory bacterial species were capable of
repairing the growth abnormalities associated
with microbiota from stunted and underweight
donors. We selected gnotobiotic recipients of mi-
crobiota from two 6-month-old donors that trans-
mitted the most discordant growth phenotypes
in the initial screen of 19 microbiota (fig. S5A).
One was a healthy infant from Mangochi (HAZ =
1.49, WAZ = 1.43, and WHZ = 0.9) with age-
appropriate microbiota maturity (microbiota age
of 6.7months); the other was aseverely stunted and
underweight infant (HAZ = –3.35, WAZ = –3.08,
and WHZ = –0.79) from Malindi (located 20 km
from Mangochi) with an immature microbiota

 (microbiota age of 4.6 months). The configurations
of these transplanted microbiota were distinct:
Mice colonized with the healthy donor com-
munity were dominated by F. prausnitzii (33 ±
19% relative abundance), whereas mice colonized
with microbiota from the undernourished donor
were dominated by Clostridium neonatale (37 ±
11% relative abundance) (N = 5 mice per donor).
Of the 27 species (66 97% ID OTUs) present in
recipients of the healthy donor community
and the 22 species (33 97% ID OTUs) present
in recipients of immature microbiota from the
undernourished donor, 13 OTUs representing
13 different species were present in both (see fig.
S5B and table S11).
Taking advantage of the coprophagic behav-
ior of mice, we gavaged 5-week-old male germ-
free C57BL/6J animals with microbiota from
either the healthy or the stunted and under-
weight donor. Four days later, before pheno-
typic differences were apparent, we combined
(dually housed) mice containing the healthy (H)
donor microbiota (H-H controls). We also com-
bined mice that received the undernourished
(Un) donor community (Un-Un controls). The
experimental group consisted of H and Un mice
that were cohoused with one another (HCH-UnCH)
(see Fig. 3A). All animals were fed the M8 diet
beginning three days before colonization and
throughout the course of the 3-week experiment.
Animals were weighed twice a week; body com-
position and fecal samples were assayed once a
week.
HCH and UnCH cagemates both gained signif-
icantly more lean mass than Un-Un controls
did (UnCH, P = 0.0121; HCH, P = 0.0447; Mann-
Whitney test; Fig. 3B) but had no significant
difference in lean mass gain relative to H-H con-
trols. We characterized invasion using a previ-
ously described approach (18) that uses Microbial
SourceTracker [(19) and supplementary mate-
rials]. The fecal microbiota of H-H or Un-Un
controls sampled 4 days after gavage (just before
cohousing) were treated as source communi-
ties. The fecal communities belonging to each
HCH and UnCH mouse were then traced to these
sources (see the supplementary materials). Re-
sults indicated significant invasion by members
of the healthy microbiota into the microbiota
of UnCH cagemates (Fig. 3C and table S12). Nine
OTUs from the HCH cagemates’ microbiota were
consistent invaders (a total of 12 cohoused mice).
Based on the rank order of their invasion scores,
the two most successfulinvaders were F. prausnitzii,
an age- and growth-discriminatory taxon in the
RF models and the most abundant OTU in the
fecal microbiota of UnCH mice at the conclusion
of the cohousing experiment, and Ruminococcus
gnavus, a growth-discriminatory taxon. In con-
trast, only two OTUs from the microbial com-
munity of the undernourished donor successfully
invaded the gut community of HCH mice; one
was assigned as Enterococcus and the other as
Eubacterium limosum, which together repre-
sented 2.7 ± 1.7% of the community after co-
housing [the Enterococcus OTU 4316566 had a
significant negative correlation with lean mass
gain in the initial screen of 19 donor microbiota
(r = –0.14, P = 0.0065)].
Culturing discriminatory taxa and
characterizing their effects on growth
Acquisition of HCH-derived bacterial taxa in the
microbiota of UnCH cagemates was accompanied
by reductions in the relative abundances of 19
OTUs in the latter, six of which were below the
limits of detection (<0.01%) by the end of the
cohousing experiment. These observations raised
two questions. Which invasive OTUs mediated the
observed effects on growth phenotypes? Did the
reduction in other OTUs improve growth in UnCH
cagemates? Therefore, we attempted to culture
F. prausnitzii and R. gnavus from the fecal mi-
crobiota of healthy Malawian infants from the
iLiNS-DYAD-M cohort. These efforts yielded three
additional strains—Clostridium nexile (positive-
ly correlated with lean mass gain), Clostridium
symbiosum (lean mass gain–discriminatory), and
Dorea formicigenerans (weight gain– and lean
mass gain–discriminatory)—making for a five-
member consortium.
Analogous to the cohousing experiment, male
germ-free C57BL/6J mice were placed on the
M8 diet at 4.5 weeks of age; 3 days later, five mice
were each given a single gavage with the intact
microbiota from the Un donor, with or without
the five-member consortium (Fig. 4A). The five-
member consortium produced a significant
increase in body weight and lean mass gain com-
pared with the untreated group (P = 0.03 and P =
0.01, respectively, at the time of euthanasia 21
days after gavage; Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 4B).
Only two members of the consortium, R. gnavus
strain TS8243C and C. symbiosum strain TS8243C,
successfully colonized recipient mice [relative
abundances of 27 ± 3% (mean ± SD) and 2.6 ±
0.3%, respectively, in feces obtained at euthana-
sia] (Fig. 4C; fig. S6 and table S13 show the re-
sults of reconstructions of selected metabolic
subsystemsinR.gnavusTS8243CandC. symbiosum
TS8243C). None of the other members were de-
tected in recipients sampled on days 4, 7, and 14
after gavage. Moreover, the efficiency of incorpo-
ration of members of the Un donor’s microbiota
into recipient mice was indistinguishable be-
tween the two treatment arms; i.e., (i) R. gnavus
and C. symbiosum did not result in extirpation
of any major constituents of the community
[the only species that fell below 0.1% of the
community’s composition was Bifidobacterium
bifidum, whose relative abundance was only
0.6 ± 0.1% (mean ± SD) in the control group at
the time of euthanasia], and (ii) the proportion-
al representation of OTUs in the Un community
was similar between the experimental and con-
trol groups (Fig. 4C and table S14). These results
provide direct evidence that the cultured strains
of R. gnavus and C. symbiosum ameliorate the
impaired growth phenotype transmitted by an
undernourished donor’s immature microbiota.
The presence of these two organisms also
affected metabolic phenotypes (Fig. 4D and table
S15). The metabolic features that most discrimi-
nated mice with R. gnavus and C. symbiosum
from the untreated group were acylcarnitines
(C5 to C22), which were significantly increased
in cecal samples and decreased in the liver and
serum of fed mice harboring the two taxa (P < 0.05,
Student’s t test). Some of these acylcarnitines
also distinguished mice harboring the H ver-
sus the Un donor microbiota (fig. S7, A and B).
Among metabolites that were decreased in the
livers of treated mice were the C5, C5-DC, and
C6-DC acylcarnitines, all of which can be derived
from branched-chain amino acid catabolism.
As proposed for the comparison of mice har-
boring the H versus the Un donor microbiota
(see the supplementary materials), the decrease
in these liver metabolites suggests an impact of
the presence of two growth-promoting taxa on
host metabolic machinery that drives amino
acids away from oxidation in favor of protein
synthesis and lean mass formation. The mech-
anisms by which the gut microbiota communi-
cates metabolically with other tissues remain to
be defined.
Acknowledging that the generalizability of
these effects needs to be directly tested using
additional microbiota from other undernourished
infants and children, we proceeded to assess
whether the growth-discriminatory taxa identi-
fied in our preclinical model correlate with growth
in Malawian infants and children. To do this, we
used the 220 samples from the healthy Malawian
twin cohort to generate two RF-based models. One
regressed the 30 most weight gain–discriminatory
OTUs shown in Fig. 2D against WHZ; the
other regressed the 30 most lean mass gain–
discriminatory taxa described in fig. S2 against
this metric. We then evaluated how well the mod-
els were able to predict WHZ scores in the 259
members of the iLiNS-DYAD-M cohort across all
time points surveyed (6, 12, and 18 months old
for each individual). During this brief 12-month
window, there were significant and positive cor-
relations between predicted and observed WHZ
using either the weight gain– or lean mass gain–
discriminatory taxa (weight gain–discriminatory
model, r = 0.12 and P < 0.0008; lean mass gain–
discriminatory model, r = 0.11 and P < 0.002; P <
0.0001 for both models in a permutation test with
999 permutations). In both models, B. longum was
the most discriminatory taxon, with F. prausnitzii
OTUs following as the second or third most dis-
criminatory in the weight gain and lean mass
gain models, respectively (fig. S10). The increasing
ability to assemble the genomes of bacterial
strains from shotgun sequencing of fecal com-
munity DNA (20) should allow these types of
analyses to be further developed in Malawian
and other populations that are surveyed longi-
tudinally at frequent intervals over extended pe-
riods of time. This approach would also provide
direct information about the representation of
the strains that we cultured and subsequently
characterized in our preclinical model.

 are several interrelated factors that could disrupt
normal gut microbiota succession in infants and
children. They include, but are not limited to, (i)
poor maternal nutritional status, (ii) enteropath-
ogen invasion, (iii) the history of consumption
of antibiotics, (iv) disturbances in gut mucosal im-
mune system development (21), and/or (v) the
history of complementary feeding. Phenotyped
birth cohorts provide an opportunity to perform
correlation analyses designed to test the signifi-
cance of the relationship between microbiota
maturity (and the representation of specific age-
and growth-discriminatory taxa), anthropometry,
and the factors listed above, as well as the enig-
matic disorder currently described as environ-
mental enteric dysfunction (22).
In this study, we showed that microbiota from
6-month-old donors produced greater effects
on growth in recently weaned mice than mi-
crobiota from 18-month-old donors, although
overall, the effects produced by a healthy donor’s
age-appropriate community were greater than
those produced by an undernourished donor’s
immature microbiota. Though it will be impor-
tant to extend these analyses to microbiota sam-
pled from additional individuals representing
this and other geographic sites and cultural tra-
ditions, these findings suggest that in healthy
children, microbiota development is optimized
to satisfy the different growth needs of the host
at different ages. An immature microbiota ap-
pears to cause a form of neoteny that is not con-
ducive to healthy growth when nutrients are
limiting. How will a host adapt to therapeutic
interventions that result in rapid progression to
an age-appropriate microbiota? Are there mech-
anisms (including those involving the mucosal
immune system) that feed back to regulate the
rate of microbiota development? The answers
have implications for designing therapeutic strat-
egies for durable repair and prevention of stunting
and neurodevelopmental and/or immunologic
abnormalities associated with undernutrition.
So far, ready-to-use complementary foods with
and without antibiotics have generally produced
only modest effects on growth and the longer-
term sequelae of undernutrition (23). Certain
locally available complementary foods that are
provided after the cessation of exclusive breast-
feeding may have the ability to promote colo-
nization of growth-discriminatory gut taxa in
proportions that are age-appropriate, and these
could be tested for their clinical value in systematic
trials. In this respect, gnotobiotic mice colonized
with microbiota from chronologically age-matched
healthy and undernourished donors, and fed diets
representative of those consumed by the micro-
biota donors, should permit highly controlled di-
rect tests of the effects of antibiotics, breast milk
components (e.g., bovine mimics of human breast
oligosaccharides), and complementary foods on
the mechanisms by which growth-promoting
bacterial strains influence growth, metabolic,
bone, immune, and neurologic phenotypes.

specimens included in this study was approved by the University of
Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee.
Specimens were provided to Washington University in St. Louis
under a materials transfer agreement (MTA) between the
University of Malawi and Washington University, and
their collection and use for this study was approved by the
Washington University Human Research Protection Office
(Federalwide Assurance no. FWA00002284). 16S rRNA sequences,
generated from fecal samples in raw format before post-
processing and data analysis, and shotgun sequencing
data sets, generated from the R. gnavus TS8243C and
C. symbiosum TS8243C genomes, have been deposited in the
European Nucleotide Archive under accession number
PRJEB9853. J.I.G. is a cofounder of Matatu, a company
characterizing the role of diet-by-microbiota interactions
in animal health. A.L.O. is an adjunct vice president for
research for Buffalo BioLabs. L.V.B., M.R.C., and J.I.G. designed
the gnotobiotic mouse studies; L.V.B. and M.R.C. performed the
experiments with gnotobiotic animals; I.T. and M.J.M. designed
and implemented the clinical monitoring and sampling for the
twin study and participated in patient recruitment, sample
collection and preservation, and/or clinical evaluations;
K.M.M., Y.F., J.M.J., K.G.D., and P.A. designed and oversaw the
clinical studies, sample collection and processing, and/or clinical
monitoring and evaluations in the iLiNS-DYAD-M study; L.V.B.
generated the 16S rRNA data; L.V.B., M.R.C., S.V., and O.I.
generated the metabolomics data; T.S. and L.V.B. cultured
bacterial isolates; B.H., D.A.R., S.A.L., and A.L.O. performed
metabolic reconstructions of the R. gnavus and C. symbiosum
genomes; L.V.B., M.R.C., M.J.B., S.S., C.B.N., and J.I.G. analyzed
the data; and L.V.B. and J.I.G. wrote the paper.
