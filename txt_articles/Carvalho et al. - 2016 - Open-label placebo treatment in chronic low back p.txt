pain: a randomized controlled trial

Abstract
This randomized controlled trial was performed to investigate whether placebo effects in chronic low back pain could be harnessed
ethically by adding open-label placebo (OLP) treatment to treatment as usual (TAU) for 3 weeks. Pain severity was assessed on three
0- to 10-point Numeric Rating Scales, scoring maximum pain, minimum pain, and usual pain, and a composite, primary outcome,
total pain score. Our other primary outcome was back-related dysfunction, assessed on the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire.
In an exploratory follow-up, participants on TAU received placebo pills for 3 additional weeks. We randomized 97 adults reporting
persistent low back pain for more than 3 months’ duration and diagnosed by a board-certified pain specialist. Eighty-three adults
completed the trial. Compared to TAU, OLP elicited greater pain reduction on each of the three 0- to 10-point Numeric Rating Scales
and on the 0- to 10-point composite pain scale (P , 0.001), with moderate to large effect sizes. Pain reduction on the composite
Numeric Rating Scales was 1.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.0-2.0) in the OLP group and 0.2 (20.3 to 0.8) in the TAU group. Open-
label placebo treatment also reduced disability compared to TAU (P , 0.001), with a large effect size. Improvement in disability
scores was 2.9 (1.7-4.0) in the OLP group and 0.0 (21.1 to 1.2) in the TAU group. After being switched to OLP, the TAU group
showed significant reductions in both pain (1.5, 0.8-2.3) and disability (3.4, 2.2-4.5). Our findings suggest that OLP pills presented in
a positive context may be helpful in chronic low back pain.
1. Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) causes more disability than any other
medical condition worldwide.2,31 It is the most common
occupational disorder globally30 and, in the United States, is
ranked third among all diseases by disability-adjusted life-
years.24 Researchers and clinicians have identified a pressing
need for innovative treatments and management tools.11
Recent studies have demonstrated that some commonly
prescribed front-line therapies for LBP are actually not superior
to placebo controls in double-blind randomized clinical trials
(RCTs)22,33 or are of only marginal increased efficacy.26 In
themselves, placebo responses in trials for LBP can be large
and clinically significant.5,10 Undoubtedly, some of these
improvements are due to normal waxing and waning of
symptoms and regression to the mean.27 Recent evidence
suggests
that
beyond
such
spontaneous
improvement,
a significant percentage of these responses are due to placebo
effects: ie, the psychosocial effects of the therapeutic encoun-
ter, including its interactions, rituals, and symbols.18
Administrating fake pills to harness placebo effects poses an
ethical conundrum for physicians in clinical practice due to the
widespread belief that deception is necessary for placebo pills to
work (eg, pretending sugar pills are drugs or, more commonly,
giving genuine medications that have no known effect on the
condition).29 However, 4 studies have directly tested the effect of
an open-label placebo (OLP) prescription, and all indicated that
patients reported benefits after taking pills presented honestly as
placebos. Three were small pilot studies.19,25,28 The fourth was
a controlled trial in irritable bowel syndrome and showed significant,
clinically meaningful benefits over no-treatment controls.17
The received wisdom is that clinical administration of a placebo
requires deception (or double-blind conditions) to be effective.
How is it that a placebo treatment is able to produce effects even
when the participants know that the pill is inert? One possibility is
that the positive rationale with which the placebo was presented
was convincing enough to allow participants to suspend their
disbelief.21 Participation in the study and then in the follow-up for
TAU participants implies a belief or hope that the treatment might
be helpful. Engendering hope when participants feel hopeless
about their condition can be therapeutic.8 Although placebo
analgesia has been associated with expectancy,21 it is possible
that pill-taking, including bodily sensations such as twisting bottle
tops and swallowing, can produce associations of placebo
analgesia independent of conscious expectancies.1 Consistent
with that hypothesis, recent evidence suggests that noncon-
scious processes actively contribute to placebo responses.15,16 It
is also possible that spontaneous fluctuations in pain might be
interpreted as evidence that the placebo is working, thereby
strengthening expectations of relief and setting in motion a benign
cycle between expectancy and change.20

 The goal of this study was to investigate whether adding OLP to
treatment as usual (TAU) could benefit patients with chronic low
back pain (cLBP) compared to TAU that controlled for additional
spontaneous improvement, regression to the mean and the
patient-provider relationships.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
Between November 2013 and December 2015, we conducted
a 3-week RCT comparing current treatment plus OLP to current
treatment alone (TAU), in an outpatient pain unit of a general public
hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As a retention device, we offered
participants in the TAU group the opportunity to take placebo pills
for 3 weeks at the conclusion of the main study. We followed these
participants as an exploratory secondary outcome. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant before
participation in the study. The Comissa
˜ o de ´
Etica do Centro
Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (Western Lisbon Hospital Centre’s
Ethics Committee) approved the design and informed consent.
2.2. Study population
Participants were recruited from advertisements for “a novel
mind–body clinical study of chronic low back pain” in flyers,
posters, Facebook posts, magazine advertising, and referrals from
health care professionals. Participants were included if they were
$18 years old and had persistent lower back pain for more than 3
months’ duration. Diagnosis was confirmed by a nurse practitioner
(P.R.) and a board-certified pain specialist (L.C.). Participants were
excluded if they were medicated with opioids in the prior 6 months
or had a history of refusing to take oral medication. Because the
study was a proof-of-concept, we thought that inclusion of these
subpopulations might render our goal more difficult. To reduce
potential heterogeneity from different causes of pain, we excluded
patients with cancer, fractures, infections, prior lower back
surgery, and disk degeneration due to ageing or trauma. We also
excluded conditions that make the treatment difficult (eg, paralysis,
psychosis) and other conditions that might confound treatment
effects or interpretation of results (eg, severe fibromyalgia,
rheumatoid arthritis, concurrent care from other providers). Any
surgery within the past 30 days, pregnancy, breastfeeding,
concurrent legal issues, and participation in another clinical study
were also excluding factors.
Participants were allowed to continue their cLBP medications
(eg, paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs],
etc) as long as they agreed to not change their medication routine
or dosage during the trial, nor make any major life-style changes
(eg, starting a new diet or changing their exercise pattern) during
the study.
2.3. Intervention
The principal investigator (PI) (C.C.) screened telephone and
e-mail inquiries and told potential enrollees that participants
would be enrolled in a clinical trial to test a novel mind–body
treatment approach for cLBP. During screening, the PI checked
for inclusion and exclusion criteria, after which the first face-to-
face appointment at the pain unit was scheduled. Before
randomization, all participants first met a registered nurse
practitioner (P.R.) for a medical history examination and then
with a board-certified pain specialist (L.C.). Participants were then
informed by the PI that if they agreed to participate in the study
they would be randomized to take placebo pills (OLP) or to
a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group for 3 weeks and that the latter
would be offered the opportunity to take the placebo pills after the
first 3 weeks. We offered this opportunity to the TAU group so that
they would not be disappointed in not receiving the intervention and
perhaps produce nocebo effects. The PIexplained that the placebo
pill was an inactive substance, like a flour pill, that contained no
active medication in it. After informed consent, all participants were
asked if they had heard of the “placebo effect” and explained in an
approximately 15-minute a priori script, adopted from an earlier
OLP study,18 the following “4 discussion points”: (1) the placebo
effect can be powerful, (2) the body automatically can respond to
taking placebo pills like Pavlov dogs who salivated when they heard
a bell, (3) a positive attitude can be helpful but is not necessary, and
(4) taking the pills faithfully for the 21 days is critical. All participants
were also shown a video clip (1 minute 25 seconds) of a television
news report, in which participants in an OLP trial of irritable bowel
syndrome were interviewed (excerpted from: http://www.nbcnews.
com/video/nightly-news/40787382#40787382).
After these interactions, a sequentially numbered, opaque,
sealed randomization envelope that contained treatment assign-
ment was opened. Up to this point, the participant–provider
interaction—including delivering the positive rationale and the
explanation of the importance of both groups—was the same for
all participants. Participants randomized to the OLP group were
given a typical prescribed medicine bottle of placebo pills with
a label clearly marked “placebo pills” and “take 2 pills twice a day.”
The placebo pills were Swedish Orange gelatin capsules filled
with microcrystalline cellulose, a common inert excipient for
pharmaceuticals (Bial, Porto, Portugal). Participants in TAU were
reminded of the importance of the control group and of the
opportunity to receive placebo pills after the first 3 weeks.
The midpoint (day 11) visit was brief (approximately 10-15
minutes) and included an assessment administered by the
registered nurse, who was blind to treatment assignment. This
was followed by a brief conversation with the PI, who reminded
participants receiving placebo pills about the 4 discussion points
and reminded participants in the TAU arm that they could start the
placebo pills at the end of the 3 weeks and thanked them for
helping make a successful study. All interactions were in a context
of a warm supportive participant–provider relationship.
2.4. Randomization
Randomization was prepared in advance by a research assistant
using a computerized program (“Research Randomizer”) and then
inserted in a numbered, opaque, sealed envelope. Randomization
was revealed to the PI and the participant during the first visit, after
discussion of the 4 points. A registered nurse (P.R.) blinded to
treatment assignment conducted all assessments.
2.5. Outcome assessments
During baseline interviews, we obtained data on participant
demographics, including age, gender, years of education,
employment status, current pain medication, and complemen-
tary medicine usage (Table 1). Outcomes were measured at
baseline and after 11 and 21 days using paper and pencil
questionnaires. Participants on the TAU arm who agreed to
participate in a 3-week OLP follow-up responded again to the
questionnaires 21 days later. There was no midterm visit during
the 3-week open-label follow-up.
Following validated procedures in research on cLBP, our
a priori primary outcomes were a change from baseline at

 3 weeks in lower back pain intensity during the prior week and
dysfunction related to lower back pain. Pain intensity was
assessed by asking participants to rate their pain using 3
standard Numeric Rating Scales, ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to
10 (“worst pain imaginable”), scoring maximum pain, minimum
pain, and usual pain. The mean of the 3 measures was our
primary pain outcome. Our other primary outcome was back-
related dysfunction, which was measured using the validated
Portuguese adaptation of the Roland–Morris Disability Question-
naire.23 The Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire includes 24
yes or no statements about difficulties in daily activities, such as
difficulties in getting dressed and climbing stairs. The overall
score is a sum of positive responses, ranging from 0 to 24, with
a higher score signifying more disability. Our secondary measure
was bothersomeness, assessed by asking participants to rate
how bothersome their pain has been during the past week on
a scale of 0 (“not at all bothersome”) to 10 (“extremely
bothersome”).6
Given the novel nature of the study, after outcome data were
gathered at the completion of the 3-week trial, participants were
interviewed briefly by the PI and asked the following questions.
Participants in the placebo arm were asked: (1) What do you think
about the idea of taking placebo pills? (2) Did you expect the
placebo to work or were you skeptical? (3) What did you think was
in the placebo pills? (4) Any further comments/what have you
learned with your participation in this study? Participants in the
TAU group were asked: (1) Were you disappointed to be in the
treatment-as-usual group? (2) What did you like most and least
about the study? (3) Any further comments?
2.6. Statistical analysis
This trial was designed prospectively to assess and compare
differences between OLP 1 TAU treatment and TAU. We
calculated that we need 96 participants to provide 90% power
to detect a 1-point difference between group changes in the pain
scores. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test these
differences on all outcomes, with pretreatment scores as the
covariates. The effect of an independent variable in an ANCOVA
with pretreatment scores as the covariate is the same, regardless
of whether posttreatment scores or change scores are the
dependent variable. For ease of interpretation, we present
adjusted mean change scores rather than adjusted mean
posttreatment scores. To adjust for dropouts, we used a last
value carried forward approach, which implicitly assumes no
change from baseline for participants who dropped out. Changes
in pain, disability, and bothersomeness during the 3-week follow-
up period among participants in the TAU group were analyzed via
paired sample t tests.
3. Results
We enrolled participants from November 2013 and December
2015. Figure 1 shows details. A total of 239 people completed
telephone and/or e-mail screening, 118 of whom were not eligible
or refused to participate, leaving 121 people who attended the
enrolment visit. During this visit, 24 people were deemed ineligible
or refused to participate. We randomized the remaining 97
participants to OLP or TAU. Seven participants in each group
(OLP/TAU) were later found to be ineligible (opioid use 4/3,
inability to take medications orally 2/1, changed medications 1/2,
pain related to trauma 0/1) and were excluded from the analysis,
leaving a sample of 83 participants. Three participants in the OLP
group and 4 in the TAU group discontinued at midpoint. We
replaced missing data from dropouts using the last observation
carried forward method. At baseline, the 2 groups were well
balanced with regard to demographics, medication, usual pain,
maximum pain, disability, and bothersomeness of the pain
(Table 1). Despite proper randomization, the TAU group reported
lower baseline minimum pain scores than the OLP group
(difference on the 10-point scale 1.25, 95% confidence interval:
0.41-2.10). There were no other significant differences between
the 2 groups at baseline. Our data analysis plan included the use
of analysis of covariance, which adjusts for baseline differences
between individuals and thus provides a statistical control for
group differences when randomization does not succeed in
producing completely balanced groups on baseline measures.
3.1. Outcomes at 3 weeks
Table 2 and Figure 2 show the mean change in outcomes at the
end of the 3-week treatment period, adjusted for baseline scores.
The 3 pain scores were significantly correlated at baseline and the
3-week endpoint and composite pain scores showed adequate
reliability (Cronbach alpha 5 0.70 and 0.91 at baseline and
endpoint, respectively). Thus, the composite score provides the
most reliable measure of pain severity and pain reduction. The
ANCOVA on the composite score revealed that compared to
TAU, OLP elicited greater pain reduction on the composite pain
measure (P , 0.001). Open-label placebo also reduced disability
compared to TAU (P , 0.001), with a large effect size. Differences
on bothersomeness were not significant (P 5 0.195). The
ANCOVA also revealed that compared to TAU, OLP elicited
significantly greater pain reduction on each of the 3 pain rating

 scales (P 5 0.008, 0.018, and 0.040 for minimum, usual, and
maximum pain, respectively). Effect sizes ranged from medium
(g 5 0.46) to large (g 5 0.76).
A reduction in pain of 27.9% has been found to correspond to
clinical ratings of “much improved” and a 30% reduction has been
recommended as an indication clinical significance.7,9 There was
a clinically significant 30% reduction in both usual and maximum
pain in the placebo group compared to reductions of 9% and
16% in usual and maximum pain, respectively, in the continued
usual treatment group. Open-label placebo reduced minimum
pain by 16% compared to an increase in pain of 25% with TAU.
There was also a 29% reduction in pain-related disability in
placebo group compared to 0.02% in the TAU arm.
With 7 dropouts in a total of 83 participants, there is a concern
as to whether the use of LOCF might have impacted the results.
To address this concern, we conducted a completer analysis.
The results of the completer analysis were consistent with those
of the LOCF analysis for all variables (minimum pain, P 5 0.004;
usual pain, P 5 0.018; maximum pain, P 5 0.017; composite
pain, P 5 0.001; disability, P 5 0.001; and bothersomeness,
P 5 0.140).
Adverse events were almost nonexistent. At midpoint, 1 OLP
participant reported feeling the discomfort she had previously felt
on NSAIDs during the first 2 days, but it then disappeared. It is
unclear what she meant. At endpoint, 1 participant reported
a rash and 1 participant reported an increase in pain when she
forgot to take the pills for a couple of days, but said the pain
disappeared as soon as she resumed taking pills.
The detailed results of the qualitative checkout questionnaire
will be reported elsewhere. Important findings include that
participants understood they were taking placebos. Of the 33
OLP participants who responded to the question on the contents

2769
 of the pills, 30 reported that “it was not an active substance” (eg,
“sugar,” “flour,” nothing in it,” or “what you said it would be”).
Three participants reported that the pills were “pain killers” (eg, “it
worked so well that it has to contain something”). In response to
the question, whether the participants initially thought the
treatment would work or were skeptical, of the 30 participants
in the OLP, 21 said “skeptical” or “a little,” 9 said they believed it
would work. In the TAU arm, most respondents were not
disappointed about assignment “because I knew I will have it
later.”
3.2. Outcomes of TAU participants who took placebo pills
after the main study
At their last treatment session, participants in the TAU group were
invited to participate in a follow-up continuation, during which
they would receive OLP. Of the 38 TAU participants who
completed the main study, 7 declined follow-up OLP, leaving
31 participants entering the follow-up phase. Two of these
participants discontinued after entering the follow-up phase. We
replaced missing data from these 2 dropouts using the last
observation carried forward method. One participant neglected
to rate minimum pain at the end of the follow-up. Thus, analyses
of minimum pain and composite pain intensity included 30
participants.
Table 3 reports the mean change in outcomes from the end of
the 3-week treatment period to the end of the 3-week follow-up.
After being given OLP for 3 weeks, participants in TAU who had
entered the follow-up showed significant pain relief on all
outcome measures (P # 0.001 for each), with moderate to large
effect sizes. Pain reductions ranged from 1.3 to 1.7 on a 0 to 10
scale. Percent pain reduction ranged from 29% for maximum
pain to 46% for minimum pain. Back pain–related disability
decreased by 40% and pain bothersomeness decreased
by 34%.
4. Discussion
The study is the first to demonstrate potential clinically significant
benefits of OLP treatment in cLBP. We found that adding OLP to
TAU resulted in significantly greater reductions in cLBP and pain-
related disability than TAU alone (Table 2). The amount of
additional pain reduction produced by OLP was approximately
30% of baseline pain and disability ratings.
Almost 90% of the participants in this trial were taking pain
medication, primarily NSAIDs, before and during the trial.
Although NSAIDs are reported to reduce LBP more than
double-blind placebo, the difference amounts to less than 1
point on a 0 to 10 pain scale.26 In this study, OLP enhanced pain
reduction by 1.49 points on a 0 to 10 scale compared to a 0.24

 point change with continued standard treatment without the
added placebo. This was an added benefit beyond the effect of
continued NSAID and/or other ongoing treatment. These data
suggest that patients with cLBP could benefit from the addition
OLP to their current treatment regimen. Our study supports
earlier studies that suggest a benefit for OLP treatment.17,19,25,28
Our findings support the Institute of Medicine position that
“placebo conceivably be a form of treatment of pain, especially in
light of the shortcoming of other modalities or benefits they bring
in their right.”14
Our data suggest that OLP can be a safe and effective adjunct
to treatment for cLBP. Only 6 participants who attended an
enrollment visit refused participation. Only 3 participants in the
open-label group discontinued treatment, and only 2 participants
in the TAU group discontinued after beginning OLP treatment
during the follow-up. In contrast, 17 participants requested
prescriptions for placebo at the end of their participation in the
study.
4.1. Limitations
This RCT has several limitations. Most importantly, our sample
size was relatively small and the trial duration was too short to
obtain estimates of long-term effects. Replication with a larger
sample size and a longer follow-up is required before our “proof-
of-principle” study allows for any clinical recommendations.
Importantly, it is worth noting that large survey13 and focus group
research3 indicates that participants are amenable to accepting
OLP treatments if honestly described and endorsed as a possible
benefit by their physicians. Furthermore, given that OLP
treatment involves transparency and informed consent, the
ethics of open-label is unproblematic.4
Our outcome measures were subjective rather than objective.
Self-appraised outcomes raise the issue of report bias (eg,
wishing to please the experimenter),12 and this might be
exacerbated in a nonblind design. However, self-reported pain
and disability are the standard outcomes assessed in clinical trials
of cLBP. We deliberately chose cLBP for this study just because
evidence suggests that placebo effects are clinically critical and
significant in conditions based on subjective self-assessment.18
Furthermore, despite not having objective markers of changes in
any pathophysiology, our results are supported by more than 40
neuroimaging studies of pain conditions that suggests that
placebo analgesia is, in fact, correlated with objective changes in
quantifiable and specific areas of the brain and relevant
neurotransmitters.32
The results of this trial might not be generalizable to all patients
with cLBP. As is typical in clinical trials, exclusion criteria limit
generalizability. In addition, advertisement of a “novel mind–body
clinical study” may have appealed to individuals who have
concerns about conventional medicine and/or are drawn to
complementary and alternative approaches. We note, however,
that 87% of the participants were taking conventional pain
medications during the week before the entering the trial, whereas
only 14% were using complementary treatments. Also, this form of
self-selection bias is present in all clinical trials in which drugs,
psychotherapy, or any other form of treatment is advertised.
5. Conclusions
Our data suggest that harnessing placebo effects without
deception is possible in the context of a plausible rationale. More
research on this possibility is warranted in cLBP and other
conditions defined by self-appraisal.
