Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening 
in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Although the digital rectal examination (DRE) is commonly performed 
to screen for prostate cancer, there is limited data to support its use in primary 
care. This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 
DRE in screening for prostate cancer in primary care settings.
METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, DARE (Database of Abstracts of 
Reviews of Effects), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Data-
base of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature) from their inception to June 2016. Six reviewers, in pairs, inde-
pendently screened citations for eligibility and extracted data. Pooled estimates 
were calculated for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and 
negative predictive value (NPV) of DRE in primary care settings using an inverse-
variance meta-analysis. We used QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
Accuracy Studies 2) and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Devel-
opment, and Evaluation) guidelines to assess study risk of bias and quality.
RESULTS Our search yielded 8,217 studies, of which 7 studies with 9,241 patients 
were included after the screening process. All patients analyzed underwent both 
DRE and biopsy. Pooled sensitivity of DRE performed by primary care clinicians 
was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.36-0.67; I2 
= 
98.4%) and pooled specificity was 0.59 (95% 
CI, 0.41-0.76; I2 
= 
99.4%). Pooled PPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.31-0.52; I2 = 
97.2%), 
and pooled NPV was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.58-0.70; I2 = 
95.0%). The quality of evi-
dence as assessed with GRADE was very low.
CONCLUSION Given the considerable lack of evidence supporting its efficacy, we 
recommend against routine performance of DRE to screen for prostate cancer in 
the primary care setting.

INTRODUCTION
A
pproximately 1.1 million men receive the diagnosis of prostate can-
cer yearly, making it the most commonly diagnosed malignancy 
in men after nonmelanoma skin cancers.1 As prostate cancer con-
tributes to substantial morbidity and mortality, screening via the digital 
rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or both 
has become the mainstay of clinical practice. Almost one-half of Canadian 
men aged older than 40 years receive a PSA test during their lifetime, 
and the DRE is frequently incorporated as part of a routine primary care 
examination in men.2,3 Some evidence suggests, however, that the DRE 
may not significantly reduce mortality, but instead may result in a high 
number of false-positives leading to unnecessary invasive diagnostic tests 
that can precipitate pain, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence, 
as well as overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer.2,4-6
Recommendations regarding prostate cancer screening have been incon-
sistent. The Canadian Urological Association recommends screening with 
both DRE and PSA in all average-risk men aged 50 years and older with a 
minimum life expectancy of 10 years.7 In contrast, the Canadian Task Force 
on Preventive Health Care recommends against use of the PSA test for

prostate cancer screening in men aged 55 years or older 
without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer.8 The 
lack of consensus stems from a paucity of evidence to 
either support or refute the clinical utility of DRE, which 
has overall estimated sensitivity, specificity, and posi-
tive predictive value (PPV) of 53.2%, 83.6%, and 17.8%, 
respectively, in asymptomatic men aged 39 to 92 years.9
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-
analysis was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 
DRE when performed specifically in the primary care 
setting for prostate cancer screening. To the best of 
our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the 
diagnostic utility of DRE in primary care.9,10 Although 
Hoogendam et al10 aimed to conduct a similar study, 
careful evaluation of their findings reveals that DREs 
were not performed by primary care clinicians in all 
included studies.
METHODS
Data Sources and Searches
An experienced health sciences research librarian 
(L.B.) developed and conducted the search strategy. 
A combination of key words and subject headings was 
used to encompass 3 concepts: prostate cancer, digital 
rectal examination, and biopsy. The following data-
bases were searched from inception to June 18, 2016: 
MEDLINE, Embase, DARE (Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects), Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nurs-
ing and Allied Health Literature) (see Supplemental 
Appendix available at http://www.annfammed.org/
content/16/2/149/suppl/DC1/). All databases, with the 
exception of CINAHL, were searched through Ovid. 
No geographic or date restrictions were applied. Non-
English studies were excluded.
Study Eligibility Criteria and Selection
We included all diagnostic studies and systematic 
reviews investigating the effectiveness of DRE in 
screening for prostate cancer in a primary care setting. 
Only studies in which it was evident that a primary 
care clinician performed the DRE were included. All 
patients must have received a DRE regardless of their 
symptoms, PSA level, or other prognostic factors. All 
included studies must have used biopsy as a means of 
determining diagnosis. No restrictions were placed on 
patient sociodemographics.
We accepted the definition of an abnormal DRE 
used in each study, recognizing that it is defined vari-
ably in the literature. All studies must have reported 
true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-
negative rates of DRE, or provided at least 2 of these 
values to allow for the calculation of at least 1 of 4 
measures: sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or negative pre-
dictive value (NPV).
All titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were evalu-
ated independently by 3 pairs of reviewers to deter-
mine whether they met the eligibility criteria using 
Covidence online software.11 Any discrepancies that 
arose were discussed and resolved by consensus, or 
resolved by a third reviewer when necessary.
Data Extraction
Two reviewers independently extracted data by using 
pilot-tested data extraction forms. Any discrepancies 
in data collection were reconciled as stated above. We 
obtained information on study characteristics, sample 
population, and outcome measures (true-positive, true-
negative, false-positive, and false-negative rates).
Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment
Two independent reviewers used the validated Qual-
ity Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 
(QUADAS-2) tool to assess the quality of included 
studies.12 Two reviewers independently used the Grad-
ing of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for assessing 
the quality of evidence of our pooled analyses across 
5 domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, 
imprecision, and publication bias.13
Pooled Analysis
We performed meta-analysis of the sensitivity, specific-
ity, PPV, and NPV values obtained from the individual 
studies using a random-effects model weighted by 
inverse variance. A 2-sided α level of .05 was consid-
ered significant. Heterogeneity was estimated using 
the I2 statistic, which indicates the proportion of total 
variation in estimates attributed to heterogeneity, as 
well as the Q statistic. We used a cut-off of 25% for I2 
to represent minimal heterogeneity, 50% to represent 
moderate heterogeneity, and 75% to represent high 
heterogeneity. MedCalc software (version 16.8.4; 
MedCalc Software BVBA) was used to conduct the 
meta-analysis.14 All other statistical analyses were 
conducted in R (version 3.0.2; R Project for Statistical 
Computing).15 Pooled effects are presented in a forest 
plot with associated 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
Study Selection and Characteristics
We included in this review and meta-analysis 7 stud-
ies with 9,241 patients who underwent both DRE and 
prostate biopsy (Figure 1).16-22 The characteristics of 
these studies are summarized in Table 1.

Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment
All 7 studies were considered to have possible risk of 
bias according to the QUADAS-2 criteria (Table 2 and 
Supplemental Appendix Figure A1 available at http://
www.annfammed.org/content/16/2/149/suppl/DC1/). 
Lack of clarity surrounding participant enrollment 
methods in the majority of studies made it difficult to 
judge conferred risk of bias or applicability concerns in 
the patient selection domain. Similarly, risk of bias and 
applicability for the index test domain were difficult to 
determine because not all studies explicitly stated their 
criteria for an abnormal DRE. All 7 studies were deemed 
to have high risk of bias in the flow and timing domain, 
as only patients with an abnormal PSA or DRE under-
went the reference standard test (ie, prostate biopsy).
In addition, the studies’ overall quality of evidence 
was considered very low according to the GRADE 
assessment; downgrading was due mainly to risk of 
bias, inconsistency, and imprecision (Table 3).13 Fur-
thermore, although not all funnel plots were symmet-
ric, they were of limited value in judging publication 
bias because of the small sample size and heterogene-
ity. To ensure limited bias from positive studies, we 
performed manual searches of the reference lists of rel-
evant systematic reviews, and a health sciences librar-
ian (L.B.) accessed papers that were difficult to access 
or not published online.13
Pooled Results
In pooled analysis of the 7 studies, DRE performed by 
primary care clinicians generally had poor performance 
for prostate cancer screening, and there was high het-
erogeneity across studies. Pooled sensitivity of the DRE 
performed by primary care clinicians was 0.51 (95% CI, 
0.36-0.67; I2 = 98.4%) and pooled specificity was 0.59 
(95% CI, 0.41-0.76; I2 = 99.4%) (Table 4 and Supple-
mental Appendix Figure A2 available at http://www.
annfammed.org/content/16/2/149/suppl/DC1/). Pooled 
PPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.31-0.52; I2 = 97.2%), and 
pooled NPV was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.58-0.70; I2 = 95.0%). 
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review 
to investigate the effectiveness of DRE for prostate 
cancer screening in primary care. We found studies 
of DRE to have flaws resulting in “very low” quality 
and high levels of between-study heterogeneity. The 
between-study heterogeneity in our meta-analyses 
may have resulted from the various definitions used 
for abnormal DRE or from differences in training for 
primary care practitioners in performing DRE.16,18-23 A 
survey across Canadian medical schools revealed con-
siderable differences in teaching methods and found 
that approximately one-half of graduating students 
had never performed a DRE during their clerkship 
training.24,25 Furthermore, only one-half of surveyed 
primary care physicians reported feeling confident in 
their ability to detect prostate nodules using DRE.23 
Inter-examiner reliability between urologists in iden-
tifying a prostate finding as suspicious for cancer has 
been found to be only “fair” after adjusting for chance 
agreement (κ = 0.22, P =.009),26 and performance is 
anticipated to be poorer among non-urologists. We 
were, however, unable to explore training as a source 
of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses because 
the individual studies did not report this factor.
The World Health Organization has stipulated that 
screening tests should have scientific evidence to dem-

onstrate their effectiveness and that the overall benefits 
of screening should outweigh harms.27 As it stands, 
DRE does not meet these criteria. Surprisingly, a 
majority of Canadian primary care physicians routinely 
use DRE. One survey of 955 primary care physicians 
in Ontario found that 81% reported using both PSA 
and DRE to screen for prostate cancer, 9.4% reported 
using DRE alone, 7.2% reported using PSA alone, and 
8.3% did not offer prostate cancer screening at all.28 
Although the majority of physicians in this sample 
offered screening, only 38% believed it provided a sur-
vival benefit. On the basis of the lack of evidence sup-
porting its use, we do not recommend routinely using 
DRE as a screening tool for prostate cancer in primary 
care, unless it is proven effective in future studies. 
Additionally, although we did not study possible harms 
of DRE, its invasiveness and potential to lead to unnec-
essary biopsy, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment argue 
against its routine use.2,4-6
Our study has several limitations. Many studies 
do not explicitly report the setting in which, or by 
whom, the DRE is performed; this uncertainty cre-
ates difficulty in ensuring that all relevant literature 
is captured. Among the 7 studies meeting eligibility 
criteria, there was substantial variation in both setting 
and reported diagnostic accuracy of DRE. The latter 
may be partly explained by the lack of a universal defi-
nition for an abnormal DRE.29 These limitations, the 
paucity of published data, and the lack of high-quality 
randomized controlled trials on this topic make it 
difficult to interpret the results of our meta-analysis 
and decrease the reliability of our findings. Finally, 
for ethical reasons, only patients with a positive DRE 
or elevated PSA level underwent a biopsy, potentially 
underestimating the false-negative rate, and thus over-
estimating the sensitivity and NPV of DRE.
In conclusion, there is a paucity of data evaluat-
ing the effectiveness of DRE in the primary care set-
