Regional Variation in Primary Care Involvement  
at the End of Life
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Variation in end-of-life care in the United States is frequently driven 
by the health care system. We assessed the association of primary care physician 
involvement at the end of life with end-of-life care patterns.
METHODS We analyzed 2010 Medicare Part B claims data for US hospital refer-
ral regions (HRRs). The independent variable was the ratio of primary care physi-
cians to specialist visits in the last 6 months of life. Dependent variables included 
the rate of hospital deaths, hospital and intensive care use in the last 6 months 
of life, percentage of patients seen by more than 10 physicians, and Medicare 
spending in the last 2 years of life. Robust linear regression analysis was used to 
measure the association of primary care physician involvement at the end of life 
with the outcome variables, adjusting for regional characteristics.
RESULTS We assessed 306 HRRs, capturing 1,107,702 Medicare Part B beneficia-
ries with chronic disease who died. The interquartile range of the HRR ratio of 
primary care to specialist end-of-life visits was 0.77 to 1.21. HRRs with high vs 
low primary care physician involvement at the end of life had significantly differ-
ent patient, population, and health system characteristics. Adjusting for these dif-
ferences, HRRs with the greatest primary care physician involvement had lower 
Medicare spending in the last 2 years of life ($65,160 vs $69,030; P 
= 
.003) and 
fewer intensive care unit days in the last 6 months of life (2.90 vs 4.29; P <.001), 
but also less hospice enrollment (44.5% of decedents vs 50.4%; P 
= 
.004).
CONCLUSIONS Regions with greater primary care physician involvement in end-
of-life care have overall less intensive end-of-life care.

INTRODUCTION
D
uring the last decade, individuals dying in the United States 
have received an increasing volume and intensity of care without 
clear improvements in the quality of that care. Although rates 
of hospice enrollment have doubled, levels of intensive care and burden-
some care transitions have risen as well.1 Intensity of care at the end of life 
continues to have substantial regional variability2 with little relationship 
to patient preference.3 Health system factors such as intensive care unit 
(ICU) bed density and physician characteristics4-6 have been found to be 
major drivers of end-of-life care intensity. Understanding the potential 
influence of the primary care physician in this shifting landscape is critical 
to explaining variations in care patterns and identifying opportunities for 
quality improvement.
Primary care involvement in coordinating and providing continuity of 
care improves overall health outcomes. Regions with greater densities of 
primary care physicians have fewer ambulatory care–sensitive hospitaliza-
tions,7,8 lower mortality,7 and less Medicare spending7 for the general Medi-
care population. Patients with lung cancer whose primary care physicians 
are involved during their hospitalizations have 25% lower odds of ICU 
care.9 Patients with more primary care physician visits preceding the last 
6 to 12 months of life have been noted to have fewer hospital days, lower

costs, and lower rates of in-hospital death.10 Primary 
care improves patient care through several mechanisms: 
coordination of care and services,11,12 continuity of rela-
tionships,13 and comprehensiveness of practice.14
Research gaps exist in several aspects of primary 
care physician participation in end-of-life care. It is 
debated to what degree primary care physicians are 
involved in care at this time, as they are perceived as 
often transferring the care of the dying to specialists, 
especially for patients with cancer.15-17 Studies attempt-
ing to measure this, however, have found considerable 
primary care physician involvement specifically for 
patients with terminal cancers.17,18 The association 
between primary care physician involvement in end-of-
life care and hospice referral is also debated. Some evi-
dence suggests generalists refer to hospice earlier than 
specialists do,19,20 but other studies show the reverse.21 
Physicians and patients may avoid hospice referral if 
it means their relationship ends.22 Long duration of 
relationship had been reported to decrease prognostic 
accuracy, thereby reducing the ability of physicians to 
identify patients with 6-month life expectancies.23
Given our aging population, understanding and 
optimizing the role of primary care physicians in care 
at the end of life is critical to both improve the care 
of the dying and reduce unnecessary, costly intensive 
care. We therefore set out to measure and characterize 
regional variation in primary care physician involve-
ment at the end of life and determine the association of 
high regional primary care physician involvement with 
end-of-life outcomes.
METHODS
Data and Population
The unit of our analysis was the hospital referral region 
(HRR), the market area for tertiary care commonly 
used in analysis of variation across small areas.24 We 
analyzed 2010 HRR-level data from the Dartmouth 
Atlas.25 The data are derived from 2010 Medicare files 
for fee-for-service enrollees, including the Denomina-
tor files, the MedPAR file, the inpatient file, the physi-
cian file (for a 20% sample of Part B beneficiaries), the 
Outpatient file (again for a 20% Part B sample), and 
the Hospice file. The Medicare cost data are adjusted 
for regional price difference. A full description of the 
Dartmouth Atlas data set is given elsewhere in an 
online compendium of research methods.26
We collected data for a cohort of the 2010 Medi-
care beneficiaries having chronic illness. The cohort 
was determined to have at least 1 of the following 
conditions: cancer/leukemia, congestive heart fail-
ure, chronic pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes 
with end organ damage, peripheral vascular disease, 
chronic renal failure, severe chronic liver disease, and 
coronary artery disease.
Independent Measures
The primary independent variable was the ratio of pri-
mary care visits to specialist visits in the last 6 months 
of life, calculated from Medicare claims data of visits 
billed over this time period. Primary care physicians 
were defined as family practice or internal medicine 
physicians. On the basis of evidence suggesting that 
primary care physician coordination is overwhelmed if 
patients are also seeing a large number of specialists,11 
we used the ratio of primary care physician to special-
ist visits instead of the absolute number or frequency 
of primary care physician visits. This ratio has been 
established as a marker of the orientation of the health 
care system toward primary care,27 which is especially 
suitable for our study of regional characteristics.
Covariates included HRR-level demographic infor-
mation from the Medicare files such as age, sex, race, 
and the mean hierarchical condition category score, 
which is a count of conditions intended to estimate 
degree of illness. Given evidence that population 
health measures improve over counts of chronic condi-
tions in adjusting for regional illness levels,28 we col-
lected HRR-specific obesity and smoking rates from 
the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
We used the 2010 AMA Masterfile to capture regional 
physician densities. Zip code–level Rural-Urban Com-
muting Area codes (RUCAs) were used along with 
census data to calculate the percent of each HRR 
defined as urban (RUCA <4).
Outcome Measures
Primary outcome measures were the percent of deaths 
occurring in the hospital, aggregate hospice enrollment 
rates, percent of patients seeing 10 or more physicians 
in the last 6 months of life, percent of patients receiv-
ing ICU care during their final hospital admission, 
hospital and ICU days in the last 6 months, and Medi-
care spending. These measures are commonly reported 
population-level indicators of end-of-life care.1,29,30
Analysis
We divided the 306 HRRs evenly into quartiles based 
on the ratio of primary care to specialist involvement 
at the end of life. Patient, population, and workforce 
characteristics were described for each quartile. To 
measure the association between each characteristic 
and primary care involvement at the end of life, we 
used robust linear regression analysis. Robust methods 
were used for all analyses to reduce the influence of 
any outliers or heteroscedasticity that could bias the 
model. The independent variable in this model was the

HRR-level ratio of primary care to specialist visits, not 
the quartile of HRRs.
Robust linear regression analysis was then used to 
measure the association of primary care–to-specialist 
ratio with end-of-life care patterns, with each end-of-life 
care variable as the dependent variable, and the ratio of 
visits as the primary independent variable. Covariates in 
these models include the percentage of the HRR below 
100% of the Federal Poverty Limit (FPL), percentage of 
African American beneficiaries, mean beneficiary age, 
percentage of female beneficiaries, average Hierarchical 
Condition Category (HCC) score, percentage of ben-
eficiaries living in an urban zip code, regional obesity 
rates, stroke rates, and density of specialist physicians. 
We selected these variables a priori and then tested 
them for multicollinearity. In addition, the models were 
tested for normal residuals and influential outliers. From 
these models, we determined the P value of associa-
tion between primary care involvement and end-of-life 
outcomes from a regression 
analysis using the HRR-level 
primary care–to-specialist ratio. 
The models were then used to 
predict the level of each end-of-
life care variable, adjusted by all 
covariates, for each quartile of 
HRRs ranked by primary care 
involvement.
All analysis was done using 
STATA version 13.1 statistical 
software (StataCorp LP). Insti-
tutional review board approval 
was not sought, as the data for 
this study were entirely publicly 
available, non–individual level 
data.
RESULTS
We assessed 306 HRRs, in which 
a total of 1,107,702 Medicare 
Part B beneficiaries with chronic 
disease died in 2010. There was 
great variation in the regional 
ratio of primary care physician 
to specialist visits in the last 6 
months of life, with a mean of 
0.98 and an interquartile range 
of 0.77 to 1.21 (Table 1).
HRRs with more primary 
care physician involvement at 
the end of life were significantly 
different from those with less 
primary care physician involve-
ment in nearly every characteristic (Table 1). Quartiles 
with greater primary care physician involvement at the 
end of life had different demographics than those with 
less primary care physician involvement at the end of 
life, with fewer African Americans, smaller percentages 
of urban-dwelling individuals, and lower mean HCC 
scores. Although the density of physicians was similar 
across quartiles, the quartile with the most primary care 
physician involvement at the end of life had a different 
composition of physicians, with more primary care phy-
sicians and fewer specialists, as well as fewer ICU beds.
Significant variation by primary care involvement 
was seen in the end-of-life outcomes of interest, even 
after adjusting for patient characteristics, popula-
tion characteristics, and specialist density (Table 2). 
Regions in the highest quartile of primary care physi-
cian involvement had lower hospice enrollment rates 
compared with those in the lowest quartile (44.5% vs 
50.4%, P = .004), but less ICU care (2.90 vs 4.29 days

in the ICU in the last 6 months, P <.001, and 14.5% 
vs 17.5% of terminal admissions containing ICU care, 
P <.001). In addition, there was overall less Medicare 
spending in the last 2 years of life in regions with 
more primary care physician involvement ($65,160 vs 
$69,030, P = .003) and less fragmentation of care (37.0% 
of decedents saw ≥10 physicians in the last 6 months of 
life vs 42.4%, P <.001). There was no difference in hos-
pital deaths or hospital days in the last 6 months.
DISCUSSION
These findings add evidence to our increasing under-
standing that physician and health system charac-
teristics often drive variation in end-of-life care. We 
found notable variation in the involvement of primary 
care physicians vs specialists in the last months of life. 
Chronically ill adults living in regions with greater 
primary care physician involvement experience less 
hospital and ICU care in their last 6 months of life and 
are less likely to have more than 10 physicians involved 
in their care. In addition, these regions have less costly 
end-of-life care, despite lower rates of hospice use.
Primary care clinicians have previously been shown 
to improve the quality of care and lower costs of care. 
There has been little work done, however, on their role 
in end-of-life care. This study fills in gaps by demon-
strating that primary care physicians are the main phy-
sicians for about half of the HRRs in the country, and 
regions where they are the predominant clinician in 
the last 6 months of life have less costly and intensive 
end-of-life care.
The finding that greater primary care physician 
involvement is associated with less hospice use is a para-
dox worthy of further investigation, with several pos-
sible explanations. Primary care physicians may hesitate 
to refer to hospice if doing so is perceived as terminat-
ing a long-standing relationship.22 Alternatively, primary 
care physicians may not recognize patients as having a 
prognosis of less than 6 months because of their long-
standing relationship.23 Finally, hospice growth may be 
concentrated in regions where primary care physicians 
are not as predominant a source of care.31
The results of this study must be interpreted in light 
of the limitations of its design as a small-area regional 
analysis. To avoid ecological fallacy, we can make infer-
ences only about regional differences, not about indi-
vidual associations within regions. Future work needs to 
examine the extent and impact of primary care involve-
ment on care at the end of life at the patient level. In 
addition, we used a rough, though validated, measure 
of primary care involvement: the ratio of primary care 
physician to specialist visits. We therefore could not 
capture instances where a single visit to a primary care 
physician altered the course of treatment, measure 
unbilled primary care physician coordination of care, 
or qualify the nature of primary care physician involve-
ment around coordination, advance care planning,

and discussions about goals of care. A mixed-methods 
approach will be needed to appreciate the role of pri-
mary care physicians in a more nuanced way.
This study provides preliminary evidence that the 
involvement of primary care physicians is a source of 
regional variation in end-of-life care. In addition, it is 
promising that areas of high primary care physician 
involvement appear to have lower-intensity, lower-cost 
care. Given the size of the aging population and the 
magnitude of the primary care physician infrastruc-
ture, further work to understand and optimize the role 
of primary care physicians will be critical to improve 
care of the dying.
