Abstract
Mycobacterium bovis can cause tuberculosis (TB) in social mammals including lions,
cattle and man, but canine infections are considered rare. In 2016/17 we investigated
a M. bovis TB outbreak in a pack of approximately 180 Foxhounds within the bovine
TB Edge Area of England. We employed a combination of immunological tests includ-
ing an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and a serological assay (DPP VetTB,
Chembio). Test‐positive hounds were euthanased and subjected to post-mortem
examination (PME). Overall 164 hounds were tested; 97 (59%) responded positively
to at least one test. Eighty‐five (52%) dogs responded to M. bovis antigens by IGRA
while only 21 (12.9%) had detectable serological responses. At PME three hounds
(3.1%) had visible lesions (VL) due to M. bovis infection, later confirmed by culture.
Samples from 24 non‐VL hounds were cultured and M. bovis infection was confirmed
in a further three hounds (11%). This study is the first investigation and report of an
outbreak of M. bovis TB in a canine species. We establish that, in principle, diagnostic
tests used for identifying infected individuals of other species can effectively be used
in the dog. Further work is urgently needed to establish the sensitivity and specificity
of the testing approach used in this study for future clinical application.

INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium (M.) bovis is one of the nine member species of the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) which are capable of
causing tuberculosis (TB), across a broad taxonomy of social mam-
mal including but not limited to humans, lions, elephant and meer-
kats (Angkawanish et al., 2013; Brosch et al., 2002; Drewe, 2010;
Miller et al., 2012; Parsons, Drewe, Gey van Pittius, Warren, & van
Helden, 2013). Within this group of pathogens, M. bovis stands out
as the least host restricted and thus has significant zoonotic poten-
tial (Broughan et al., 2013; Michel et al., 2013; Miller & Olea‐
Popelka, 2013; Palmer, 2007). Disease in humans due to infection
with M. bovis, termed “zoonotic TB” by the World Health Organi-
sation
(WHO),
is
a
major
global
public
health
priority
which
resulted in nearly 150,000 cases and at least 12,500 deaths in
2010 worldwide (Ciszewski, Czekaj, Chojnacki, & Szewczyk, 2015;
Dürr et al., 2013; Olea‐Popelka et al., 2017). In addition, the lack
of diagnostic discrimination between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in
most human mycobacterial reference laboratories (MRLs) means
that the true mortality and morbidity caused by zoonotic TB is
possibly
underestimated
(Dürr et al.,
2013;
Olea‐Popelka
et al.,
2017).

 Discriminating between TB caused by different species of the
MTBC is challenging as all member species share identical sequences
across the 16s rRNA gene and 99.5% sequence homology across the
remainder of the genome (Brosch et al., 2002). The most discriminat-
ing features between the species at the nucleotide level are genomic
deletions, termed regions of difference (RD; Teo, Cheng, Jureen, &
Lin, 2013). These have been shown to encode a variety of different
virulence factors, for example, RD‐1 is present on all MTBC
mycobacteria other than M. bovis Bacillus‐Calmette‐Guérin (BCG)
and M. microti and encodes for the immunodominant proteins and
key virulence factors; early secreted antigenic target‐6 KDa (ESAT‐6)
and culture filtrate protein‐10 KDa (CFP‐10) (Gao et al., 2004; Guinn
et al., 2004; Junqueira‐Kipnis et al., 2006).
The human burden of disease is highest across Africa, South‐East
Asia and the Western Pacific. In South Africa, dogs have been
shown to become infected with M. tuberculosis, as diagnosed using
human interferon gamma release assays (IGRA), when exposed to
high risk humans, that is, those with active TB disease (Parsons,
Warren, Ottenhoff, Gey van Pittius, & van Helden, 2012). Similarly,
African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) have been found to be infected
with M. bovis, presumptively from hunting exposure (Ayele, Neill,
Zinsstag, Weiss, & Pavlik, 2004). In the UK, however, the significance
of M. bovis in companion animals is largely limited to domestic cats,
were frequent diagnoses are made (Broughan et al., 2013; Gunn‐
Moore, 2014; Pesciaroli et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2017). Canine inci-
dence of TB in the UK is currently considered to be rare, and almost
all reported cases are limited to individual sporadic infection or small
numbers of epidemiologically unrelated cases (Ellis et al., 2006; Gay
et al., 2000; Liu, Weitzman, & Johnson, 1980; Park, Lim, Kwon, Bae,
& Park, 2016; Parsons et al., 2012; Pesciaroli et al., 2014; Posthaus
et al., 2011; Shrikrishna, de la Rua‐Domenech, Smith, Colloff, &
Coutts, 2009; Snider, 1971; Szaluś‐Jordanow et al., 2016; Van Der
Burgt, Crawshaw, Foster, Denny, & Schock, 2009).
Between the end of 2016 and July 2017, a large outbreak of
M. bovis infection occurred in a kennel of working Foxhounds within
the Edge Area of England; which is a buffer zone of intermediate
bovine TB incidence separating the High and Low bovine TB Risk
Areas and subject to additional surveillance and controls for this dis-
ease. This report describes the clinical features of the outbreak, the
testing approach taken and the epidemiological aspects of the spread
of disease as they are currently understood. Work to evaluate the
testing approach further is currently ongoing and will be published
separately. We go on to explain the new statutory controls which
have been implemented in England as a result of this incident to
minimize the low risk of spreading TB through the feeding of fallen
stock to hounds in registered kennels.

OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION
2.1
|
Index case
The hunt kennel where this outbreak occurred is situated in the
south of England, UK, and housed up to 180 working Foxhounds
ranging in age from juvenile puppies (<10 weeks old, n = 32), young
adults (up to and including a year old, n = 21) and adults up to
8 years old (median age of 4 years).
The kennel is situated within the designated Edge Area of bovine
TB incidence. The hounds work across six counties, four of which
are also within the Edge Area, and two in the Low Risk Area, up to
three times weekly during the peak of their hunting season (August–
April).
In a similar fashion to many hunt kennels, the hounds were pre-
dominately fed raw meat, permitted offal and bone from fallen stock
(so called “flesh feeding”), as permitted under Animal By‐Products
legislation (Article 18, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1069/2009).
The index case (Case 0) occurred in December 2016. The pack
had experienced an outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease in
the previous weeks, resulting in a number of individual hounds suf-
fering from reduced body condition, lethargy and poor appetite. Two
of these hounds developed marked polyuria and polydipsia and died.
Clinical suspicion at this time was of leptospirosis infection as rou-
tine vaccination was, and remains, unused and clinical signs were
compatible (Rissi & Brown, 2014). The hounds were not subjected
to any confirmatory diagnostic testing at this time and carcasses
were disposed of. When a third hound, a 4 year old entire male with
no previous history of ill health, developed anorexia, plus marked
polyuria and polydipsia, blood samples were taken for routine
haematology, serum biochemistry and leptospirosis IgG titre testing.
These tests revealed; an inflammatory leucocytosis (21.8 × 109/L
[reference interval, RI, 6–15 × 109/L]) consisting of a mature neu-
trophilia (17 × 109/L [RI 3.6–12 × 109/L]), lymphopenia (0.4 × 109/L
[RI 0.7–4.8 × 109/L]), monocytosis (3 × 109/L [RI 0–1.5 × 109/L]) and
eosinopenia (0 × 109/L [RI 2–10 × 109/L]). Serum biochemical analy-
sis
showed
a
marked
azotaemia
(urea
18.7 mmol/L
[RI,
1.7–
7.4 mmol/L], creatinine 457 μmol/L [RI 40–132 μmol/L]), hypoalbu-
minaemia (18 g/L [RI 26–35 g/L]) and hypocalcaemia (total calcium
2.04 mmol/L [RI 2.30–3.00 mmol/L]). Serological testing returned
only a very low positive combined leptospirosis IgG titre (1+), indi-
cating that active leptospirosis was unlikely to be the cause of the
azotaemia and other clinical signs.
The dog was euthanased and subjected to post-mortem examina-
tion (PME). Both kidneys were found to be grossly diffusely grey in
colour and firmly textured. Across both the visceral and cut surfaces
were multifocal to coalescing nodular, approximately round, areas
containing hard white and soft black material (Figure 1). Representa-
tive samples were collected and fixed in formalin for histological
evaluation by one of the authors (MD, FRCPath and experienced
veterinary pathologist). Additional samples were frozen and later
submitted for mycobacterial culture and PCR.
Examination of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed
extensive, multifocal to coalescing areas of severe, chronic‐active,
necrotising, granulomatous to pyogranulomatous nephritis (Figure 2).
Silver staining for the identification of spirochetes was negative, as
was periodic acid‐Schiff staining for fungi (not shown), while a Ziehl‐
Neelsen stain revealed moderate numbers of
positive staining

 cytoplasm of epithelioid macrophages, indicative of mycobacterial
infection (Figure 3).
The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) was notified of the
findings and remaining fresh tissue was submitted for both routine
mycobacterial culture (APHA, Weybridge) and for mycobacterial PCR
(Leeds University Teaching Hospital Microbiology Department), both
of which confirmed infection with M. bovis subsp. bovis which was
genotyped to 10:a.

Testing regime
Once M. bovis infection had been confirmed a prospective test and
cull policy was implemented at the kennels in order to contain the
spread of infection within the pack and remove any potentially
infected animals. This was combined with immediate voluntary
movement restrictions implemented by the kennel and increased
biosecurity measures, for example, increased kennel disinfection pro-
tocols, cessation of feeding fallen stock and immediate repairs to
limit wildlife access to the hounds.

Interferon‐gamma release assays
Interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) release assay tests were originally devel-
oped on the principle of quantitatively evaluating IFN‐γ production
by peripherally circulating antigen‐specific effector memory T‐cells
upon in vitro stimulation, in order to aid the diagnosis of M. bovis TB
(bTB) in cattle, where it has a reported sensitivity of 81.8%–100%
and specificity of 88%–99% (Bezos et al., 2014; Schiller et al., 2009;
Vordermeier et al., 2006; Wood & Jones, 2001). They have subse-
quently been adapted to identify active and latent TB in human
patients with at least equivalent sensitivity and increased specificity
compared to the tuberculin skin test, as well as being practically
easier to perform (Eisenhut, 2014; Kim et al., 2011; Thillai, Pollock,
Pareek, & Lalvani, 2014; Zhou et al., 2011). An IGRA test has been
validated for use in domestic cats with up to 100% sensitivity for
the detection of MTBC infections (Rhodes, Gruffydd‐Jones, Gunn‐
Moore, & Jahans, 2008a, 2008b; Rhodes et al., 2011). Whereas
intra‐dermal testing has been shown to be of unreliable clinical utility
in the dog, an IGRA has been used successfully for the detection of
M. tuberculosis infections in dogs in a high risk setting (Parsons et al.,
2012). The in vitro nature of the test protocol allowed us to test
individual animal responses to multiple antigen combinations with
technical replicates in this outbreak.
To interrogate the immune response of the hounds to mycobac-
teria, the antigens purified protein derivative (PPD) M. avium (PPDA),

 PPD M. bovis (PPDB) and a cocktail of the RD‐1 specific immun-
odominant proteins ESAT6 and CFP‐10 were selected. PPDA from
M. avium is frequently used in both IGRA and tuberculin skin testing
to assess for exposure/sensitization to, or infection with, environ-
mental mycobacteria species (Pai, Dheda, Cunningham, Scano, &
O'Brien, 2007; Rhodes et al., 2008a; Wood & Jones, 2001). Infection
with an MTBC mycobacteria is confirmed if the IFN‐γ response of
any animal is greater to PPDB than to PPDA (Rhodes et al., 2008a;
Wood & Jones, 2001). The presence of a concurrent response to the
immunodominant antigens ESAT‐6/CFP‐10 indicates infection with
an RD‐1 positive MTBC mycobacteria (i.e., excludes infection with
M. microti or previous vaccination with M. bovis‐BCG) (Guinn et al.,
2004; Teo et al., 2013).
The IGRA assays were conducted at Biobest Laboratories, Edin-
burgh in line with the assay protocol validated and previously pub-
lished for use in the cat (Rhodes et al., 2008a, 2011). A 5 ml
heparinized whole blood sample was taken from each hound and
transported to the laboratory at ambient temperature within 18 hrs.
Upon receipt, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
removed; blood was diluted 1:1 with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS, Gibco, UK) and layered over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma, UK)
before centrifugation at 800 g for 40 min at room temperature.
PBMC were removed from the resulting interface, washed with
HBSS and re‐suspended in complete culture media (RPMI 1640 con-
taining 100 μg/ml L‐glutamine, 10% foetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml
penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 5 × 10−5 mol/L 2‐mercaptoethanol
and non‐essential amino acids) to a density of 2 × 106/ml. 100 μl of
PBMC suspension was stimulated in duplicate with PPDA or PPDB
(Lelystad, Prionics, Netherlands); both at a final concentration of
10 μg/ml, a peptide cocktail of ESAT‐6/CFP‐10 at a final concentra-
tion of 5 μg/ml (Lionex, Germany), a mitogen positive control of
phorbol myristate acetate plus calcium ionophore (PMA/Ca, Sigma,
UK, 50 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml respectively), and finally a complete cul-
ture medium only (i.e., negative) control.
Cells were incubated for 4 days at 37°C/5% CO2, after which the
supernatants were removed, and duplicates pooled, for quantifica-
tion of IFN‐γ by ELISA. Supernatants were either directly assayed or
stored at −80°C until required. The IFN‐γ ELISA was conducted
using a commercially available canine specific ELISA kit (DY781B,
R&D Systems, Europe Ltd., UK) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Pooled supernatant from each cell culture condition
was assayed in duplicate. Optical density (OD) values were measured
at a wavelength of 450 nm and the replicate values for each condi-
tion were averaged and standard deviations calculated. Where repli-
cates differed by more than 30% from each other, the test was
considered invalid.
Prior to the instigation of testing, a prospective case definition
was set to determine which hounds would be considered positive; it
was decided that a statistically significant response to any of the
three test antigens (PPDB, PPDA or ESAT6/CFP10) above the nega-
tive (culture medium control) condition was plausibly indicative of a
biologically significant antigen specific T‐cell response. Furthermore,
such a response would be consistent with not just exposure to
mycobacteria but rather would be suggestive of significant challenge
and probable infection. To achieve maximum diagnostic sensitivity,
and due to the fact that very little is known about the infection
dynamics, clinical progression or probability of mycobacterial shed-
ding by dogs once they are infected with mycobacteria, it was
assumed that any hound with a significant IFN‐γ response to at least
one test antigen was infected and potentially infectious. Any such
hound would therefore pose a risk to human and animal health as
well as to the environment and so should be removed from the pack
and euthanased.
As no cut off values or reference intervals exist for the dog, we
defined the threshold for responsiveness to antigen stimulation as
the mean OD value of the negative control replicates, plus two stan-
dard deviations (�
x þ 2SD). Minimum antigen responses were defined
as the mean OD value of the replicates, minus two standard devia-
tions (�
x � 2SD). If a calculated minimum antigen response value was
greater than that calculated for the negative control, then the
response was considered positive. For a test to be considered inter-
pretable, the PMA/Ca (positive control) response had to be positive
by the same criteria when compared to the negative control.
In total 164 hounds were tested by IGRA, only 11 tests failed
and required repetition; the most frequent reason for this (n = 6)
was that there was insufficient response to the PMA/Ca positive
control, followed by clotted blood samples which precluded the iso-
lation of PBMC (n = 4) and only one test required repetition due to
significant disagreement between replicate values. All IGRA test
result data are shown in Supporting Information Table S1.
Of the 164 hounds, 85 (52.0%) were found to be positive by the
above case definition. Within those found to be positive, 77 (90.1%)
displayed a significant response bias to PPDB which was greater
than the PPDA response (which was also significantly elevated
above the negative condition in 37, 48.1%, of these hounds), a pat-
tern considered indicative of MTBC infection.
Within the group of hounds displaying a typical MTBC infection
response, 48 (62.3%) also responded to the peptide cocktail ESAT‐6/
CFP‐10. Five of the test positive individuals (3.1%) responded to
ESAT‐6/CFP‐10 and no other test antigens. These individuals were
considered positive by the case definition and so were removed
from the pack and euthanased. Similarly, only three individuals
(1.8%) responded to PPDA and no other test antigens; whilst it was
considered unlikely that these were infected with MTBC mycobacte-
ria, they were removed from the pack, and euthanased, as a precau-
tion.

Serological assay
Concurrently to the IGRA testing, serological assessment of each
hound was conducted. Blood was taken from each hound at the same
time as the whole blood was collected for IGRA testing, 5mls of whole
blood was placed into plain blood tubes and left upright at room tem-
perature to allow clot formation. On arrival at the laboratory, blood
was centrifuged at 800 g for 15 min at room temperature. Serum was
removed and frozen at −20°C in 500 μl aliquots until needed.

 The Dual Path Platform (DPP) VetTB test for Cervids (Chembio
Diagnostic Systems Inc., USA) consists of two nitrocellulose strips
inside a cassette that allows independent delivery of the test sample
and antibody‐detecting reagent to the two test antigens (MPB83
and combined ESAT‐6/CFP‐10) and the test control (Jaroso et al.,
2010). One cassette was used per hound. Tests were carried out at
room temperature. Thirty microlitres of serum was dispensed into
the sample well followed by two drops of sample buffer. After five
minutes, a further four drops of sample buffer was added to the buf-
fer‐only well. Cassettes were incubated for a further 20 min. This
protocol is used by APHA for Eurasian badger (Meles meles) TB serol-
ogy with preliminary estimates of test sensitivity of 55.3% (38%–
71.4%) and specificity of 97.5% (86.8%–99.9%) (Greenwald et al.,
2003). Test results were obtained by inserting each cassette into a
hand‐held optical reader device (Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc.,
USA), measuring reflectance in relative light units (RLU). A numerical
RLU value for the control band (to show the test was valid) and the
test band was provided by the reader.
Test results were obtained first qualitatively by visual inspection
and to check the cassette quality control band and the presence/ab-
sence of antigen binding by serum antibody, and then quantitatively
by inserting each cassette into an Optricon DPP Reader (Chembio
Diagnostic Systems Inc., USA), to measure reflectance of antigen
binding by antibody in relative light units (RLU).
A total of 163 hounds were tested; of these 11 (6.7%) generated
positive test bands visible by eye; of these, nine had antibodies
directed against antigen MPB83 and two against ESAT‐6/CFP‐10.
No hounds were positive to both MPB83 and ESAT6/CFP10.
Hounds which produced a visibly positive test were considered to
be infected, removed from the pack and euthanized.
In addition, a further 10 hounds (6.1%) showed RLU values
greater than that of the majority of the remaining population and
were assigned as “intermediate positive” test results (Figure 4).
While interpreting these results is challenging, these hounds were
considered to be at increased risk of infection in comparison to the
background population and so were also removed from the group
and euthanased. All test result data for the Chembio DPP VetTB test
are given in Supporting Information Table S2.

Screening of at risk, in‐contact dogs
During the course of the outbreak, a number of dogs were identified
out with the pack which had considerable potential for exposure to
the hounds at the affected kennels. These dogs fell into three
groups; (A) those dogs kept as pets by individuals who lived at or
worked closely with the kennels and who spent a considerable
amount of time with the hounds; (B) individual bitches from the
affected kennel, that had been sent within the previous 18 months
to other kennels for the purpose of breeding and remained at those
kennels; and (C) a group of bitches that were sent from the affected
kennel during the 18 months prior to the outbreak, to other kennels
for purposes of breeding and were then returned, possibly bringing
the infection with them.
After consultation with owners, 19 at‐risk pet dogs (group A)
were subjected to IGRA testing according to the same protocol as
the hounds, outlined above (Section 2.2.1). Of these dogs only two
were found to produce significant responses to PPDB and with a
PPDB > PPDA bias, neither of these were responsive to ESAT‐6/
CFP‐10. Retrospective investigation revealed that one of these dogs
was a hound which had been retired from the affected pack due to
age‐related poor performance only a few weeks prior to Case 0
becoming clinically sick. The second was a terrier dog, used as a
“cutting room scrap dog” that is, it was regularly close to the prepa-
ration of carcasses before they were fed to the hounds.
In total, 13 bitches were sent from the affected kennel to one of
two other kennels for breeding purposes, (groups B and C); both of
these kennels are in the High Risk Area (HRA) of endemic bTB of Eng-
land. Seven of these bitches were still away at the other kennels at the
time of testing (i.e., group B), where they were assessed by IGRA and
DPP VetTB test assay (as outlined above; Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2)
and found to be negative on both tests. Six bitches had been off site
for breeding purposes in the 18 months preceding the outbreak and
returned to the kennels before the first case occurred (i.e., group C).
Only three of these animals were still alive at the time of the outbreak;
one was found to be IGRA positive (PPDB > PPDA) but was DPP
VetTB test‐negative and had no visible lesions at PME. The remaining
two live hounds were test negative by both assays. The reason for,

Post-mortem examination of test positive
animals and subsequent mycobacterial culture
During the course of the outbreak, from December 2016 until July
2017, a total of eight hounds became clinically unwell (Table 1). All
hounds displayed similar clinical signs to Case 0 including acute
onset anorexia, lethargy, polyuria and polydipsia. Only one of these
hounds was subjected to IGRA testing ante mortem and was found
to be responsive to the antigen cocktail of ESAT‐6/CFP‐10, the
remainder had to be euthanased for welfare reasons before samples
could be obtained.
All IGRA and serology test positive but clinically healthy animals
were euthanased and carcasses disposed of by incineration. Prior to
incineration, all carcasses were subjected to a minimum of a gross
PME; the exterior of the carcass was assessed, the abdominal and
thoracic cavities were opened and all viscera visually inspected.
Overall, 97 of the 164 hounds tested in the initial screening tests
were euthanased. Of these 97, three (3.1%) were found to have
grossly visible renal pathology (visible lesions, VL) as described for
Case 0; lesioned tissues were removed for mycobacterial culture and
histological examination. In all cases, acid‐fast bacilli were noted on
histology and M. bovis was cultured from the fresh tissue (see
below).
In addition, 24 (25% of the 97) non‐visible lesioned (NVL) hounds
were randomly selected to have a full PME with samples taken for
mycobacterial culture and histological examination. For each of these
hounds
the
submandibular,
pre‐scapular,
axillary,
bronchial
and
mesenteric lymph nodes were removed with one (left hand side for
paired nodes) or one half (for unpaired nodes) formalin fixed and the
other kept in sterile containers for mycobacterial culture. Given the
frequency of renal lesions in previously confirmed cases, representa-
tive internal samples of both kidneys as well as urine obtained by
cystocentesis were taken for mycobacterial culture.
Post-mortem samples were assessed by mycobacterial culture
either at APHA, Weybridge (clinically sick animals only) or the Roslin
Institute, University of Edinburgh (clinically sick and clinically well
animals). Samples from two of the eight clinically sick animals (25%)
were tested in both laboratories to check for culture agreement and
both laboratories were able to grow M. bovis from both samples.
All samples for mycobacterial culture were treated according to
APHA's standard operating procedure by both laboratories. Briefly,

 inside a Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratory up to 20 g of tissue
was homogenized, decontaminated with 5% oxalic acid or 10%
sodium hydroxide, and centrifuged, the pellet was re‐suspended in
sterile phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again. Urine
was centrifuged and removed from the sediment. The homogenate
or urine sediment respectively was then re‐suspended in PBS and
sown onto solid Middlebrook 7H11 OADC (Sigma, UK) and liquid
Middlebrook 7H9 ADC (Sigma, UK) culture media.
Cultures were read at 6 weeks of incubation and again at
14 weeks in order to allow sufficient time required for any MTBC
organism (i.e., either M. bovis or M. microti) to grow in culture if pre-
sent in the tissue sample.
A total of 14 hounds (8.2%) were confirmed as infected with
M. bovis by mycobacterial culture (Table 1). Of these; all eight hounds
which showed signs of clinical disease were found to be culture posi-
tive at 6 weeks. Six hounds were sub‐clinically infected; three were
identified as being visible lesion positive at PME, in each case M. bovis
was isolated from at least one lymph node, at least one kidney and
from urine samples. All cultures in these animals were positive by
6 weeks. Three hounds were NVL at PME but were culture positive,
as with the VL hounds, in each case M. bovis was isolated from at least
one lymph node, at least one kidney and from urine samples, however,
all cultures were only found to be positive at 14 weeks.
Positive cultures were harvested and heat killed before genotyp-
ing; M. bovis was identified on the basis of colony morphology and
genotyping by APHA. Genotyping was performed using spoligotyp-
ing (Kamerbeek et al., 1997) and VNTR typing (Exact Tandem Repeat
loci A to F, Frothongham & Meeker‐O'Connell, 1998). Positive cul-
tures grown at the Roslin Institute were harvested and digested with
enzymatic lysis buffer containing 20 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, UK).
Mycobacterial genomic DNA was obtained using a DNeasy Blood
and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany) in accordance with the manufac-
turer's instructions. Harvested DNA was used as a template for PCR
identification of the mycobacterial genes heat shock protein 65
(hsp65) and 16s rDNA. If these were positive further testing was
conducted to look for the presence of the MTBC antigen 85A, and
the RD‐1 specific gene ESAT‐6. A summary of all PME and culture
results is shown in Table 1.

testing protocol
Once the initial screening testing had been completed, the 66
hounds that remained were kept in isolation for 60 days. At this
time, because the test accuracy of the two testing methods is
unknown, the IGRA test was repeated. Nine hounds were found to
be IGRA positive, none were visibly lesioned at PME.
Following these results it was decided that the remaining 57
hounds were unlikely to be infected/infectious and so voluntary
restrictions on the kennels were lifted. The hounds continue to be
closely monitored for any change in appetite, body weight and body
condition score. All of the remaining hounds remain well at the time
of writing.

SCREENING OF AT RISK, IN‐CONTACT
HUMANS
Mycobacterium bovis is a known zoonotic bacteria. Once infection
was confirmed by laboratory culture from samples taken from the
hounds, Health Protection England (HPE) was informed to assess the
risk to human health. An in‐depth risk assessment was conducted,
and contacts were stratified in to risk pool. A ‘stone in the pond’
approach was adopted for screening, with those at highest risk of
exposure screened initially. This investigation and its findings are the
subject of an additional study, where 11 people were screened
(Phipps et al., submitted). One asymptomatic exposed person has
tested positive for TB on initial screening by IGRA and has since
been diagnosed with latent TB. Due to the nature of the contact
between this individual and the infected hounds, it remains possible
but unproven that the person was infected by contact with either
the hounds and/or contaminated bovine material.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
4.1
|
Risk pathway identification
The APHA conducted an epidemiological investigation into the
source of the outbreak to investigate possible transmission path-
ways. A qualitative risk assessment approach was used to address
the likelihood of each of these routes of infection. The more proba-
ble contenders in order of likelihood were:
4.1.1
|
Movement of infected hounds into the
kennels (inhalation/ingestion/biting)
Thirteen female hounds moved to, and six returned from, other ken-
nels for breeding purposes during the 18 months prior to clinical
signs in Case 0. This included locations in the HRA that were also
within the home‐range for genotype 10:a of M. bovis, where infected
carcases would have been more likely to have been fed. Within the
previous 3 years, but prior to the 18 months investigation in Sec-
tion 2.2.3; three hounds, two male and one female, moved onto the
premises from three other kennels in the HRA. The likelihood of
these hounds becoming infected from fallen stock at these kennels
or through other transmission pathways in the HRA was assessed as
medium and therefore the most likely. This likelihood was somewhat
mitigated by the fact that only one of the tested bitches was posi-
tive to the screening tests, and she had no visible lesions at PME.
However, not all animals could be followed up because of missing
records or mortalities, only ten of the 16 traced animals were alive
and available for testing at the time of the outbreak.
4.1.2
|
Feeding of M. bovis‐infected fallen stock
(ingestion)
Details of the fallen stock collected from farms and fed to the
hounds in the kennels over the 12‐month period prior to the first

O'HALLORAN ET AL.
 hound death were examined to provide an evaluation of the likely
risk posed. A total of 24 carcases were sourced from an Approved
Finishing Unit (AFU) for negative‐testing cattle from TB restricted
farms. However, no tuberculous lesions had been confirmed at post-
mortem meat inspection in the abattoir in any cattle from the unit
over the previous 3 years, reflecting the fact that most were sourced
from low cattle TB incidence areas, that is, from across the Low Risk
Area and/or low incidence parts of the Edge Area. Apart from the
AFU, six carcases were collected from farms with a history of TB
breakdowns caused by genotype 10:a of M. bovis—two dating back
to breakdowns in 2014 and one in early 2016 due to the purchase
of one infected cow. However, none of these incidents had ongoing
infection within the herds in question and all had been subject to
parallel IGRA and tuberculin skin testing, with negative results, which
reduces the probability of residual infection.
The feeding of fallen stock from local cattle herds with undis-
closed M. bovis 10:a infection remains a low likelihood considering
the low TB incidence in the area, annual TB testing of herds, and
the herd level test sensitivity with a cut‐off of one reactor. Only
one farm was in a 4 year testing parish, but was assessed as low
risk after considering its purchase history. No alpaca carcases or
lungs had been fed. However, it is possible that kennel staff may
not have recognized TB lesions in carcases if present. The likeli-
hood of feeding infected material to the hounds at this kennel was
consequently assessed as low, but with a medium level of uncer-
tainty regarding prevalence of carcase infection and dose–response
in dogs.
4.1.3
|
Exposure to infected livestock or wildlife
during exercising (inhalation/ingestion/biting) either
directly or via M. bovis‐contaminated environment
About 85% of the geographical area to which the hounds were
exposed had low cattle TB incidence and no indication of wildlife
infection. The remaining 15% had some TB cattle breakdowns where
APHA investigation indicated possible wildlife sources. The very
infrequent reporting of M. bovis in farm dogs suggests that farm‐
based transmission pathways are not very effective (Wilkins et al.,
2008). Kennel staff reported that direct contact between wildlife
and working hounds during exercise was unlikely. However, the
worst case scenario of an encounter with an infectious badger, or
infected carcase could have been missed. The likelihood of infection
whilst exercising was considered very low, but with high uncertainty
associated with wildlife prevalence and general lack of quantification
of the transmission pathways from the environment.
4.1.4
|
Exposure to infected local wildlife at the
kennels (inhalation/ingestion/biting)
The kennels are located in an area of the country where cattle TB
incidence is low and there is no evidence of wildlife infection.
Access to the kennels by larger wildlife such as badgers was very
unlikely. Likelihood was considered very low with low uncertainty.
Once in the kennels, infection appears to have spread horizon-
tally between the hounds, suggesting that in certain conditions such
as intensive housing of large packs, relatively high rates of transmis-
sion can occur within dog populations. It is known that badgers can
excrete up to 100,000 M. bovis colony forming units (CFU) per ml of
urine where kidneys are infected (Corner, O'Meara, Costello, Lesel-
lier, & Gormley, 2012). Dogs with similar pathology may have simi-
larly high excretory rates. Inhalation of infected urine aerosols or
ingestion of such high doses are valid and likely transmission path-
ways in this scenario to account for dog to dog spread. However,
the fact that no gross tuberculous pathology was found in the respi-
ratory and digestive systems of the clinical cases or test positive
dogs adds a level of uncertainty as to what the exact transmission
route was.
4.2

Statutory changes resulting from the
assessment
This outbreak prompted a policy review of the feeding of raw flesh
from fallen stock to hounds, permitted under Article 18 of Commis-
sion Regulation (EC) No. 1069/2009. A condition of this regulation is
that fallen stock fed are not killed or have not died as a result of the
presence or suspected presence of a disease communicable to
humans or animals. An interpretation of this is that TB reactors, nor-
mally removed by APHA, and inconclusive reactors, should not be
fed. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) commissioned a risk assessment from APHA to consider
the likelihood of M. bovis infection occurring in hounds at Animal
By‐Product (ABP) registered kennels through the routine feeding of
fallen stock sourced from farms in the HRA of England.
The overall likelihood of at least one foxhound becoming
infected with M. bovis within the next 5 years, if current practices
remained unchanged, was considered to be medium. This assessment
was subject to a high level of uncertainty associated with the true
prevalence of M. bovis infection in fallen stock carcases in the HRA
and the dose–response following ingestion of infected material in
dogs. However, the fact that this is the first reported case in a ken-
nel in the UK, may suggest that the actual risk is lower. On the one
hand this conclusion is caveated by the possibility of under‐reporting
through lack of systematic surveillance for TB in dogs. Alternatively,
the conclusion is supported by a survey of culled hounds from ten
Irish hunting kennels, over a 3‐year period (2003–2005), which iden-
tified M. bovis infection in one of 52 foxhounds submitted for PME
as part of the survey (Jahns, Callanan, McElroy, Sammin, & Bassett,
2011).
As a proportionate risk mitigation strategy, DEFRA has intro-
duced tighter restrictions on the collection and feeding of fallen
stock to hounds in registered kennels. Since 10 October 2017 the
feeding of offal from livestock species to dogs from recognized ken-
nels or packs of hounds has been banned in England (Anonymous,
2017). Hunt kennel operators must also carry out additional exami-
nations for lesions of TB in fallen stock originating from “high risk”
premises (defined as farms under movement restrictions due to a
O'HALLORAN ET AL.

 bovine TB breakdown, or which have been released from such
restrictions in the previous 12 months). In addition, APHA has devel-
oped training materials and guidance on the identification of TB in
carcases of cattle and other livestock, for collectors and kennels
feeding fallen stock to hounds. This should raise awareness of TB
and assist recognition of tuberculous lesions in fallen stock for notifi-
cation of suspicion of TB in carcases to APHA, as legally required
under The Tuberculosis (England) Order 2014. The hunt kennel
industry is also strengthening the voluntary code of practice and
guidance for its members, to recommend PME of all hounds that die
of unexplained or suspect causes.

DISCUSSION
To the authors’ knowledge this outbreak represents the only docu-
mented occurrence of TB in a canine species with evidence of
onward dog‐to‐dog transmission within the affected group. Previous
reports of TB in dogs have been of single sporadic cases or small
case series of unrelated infections. The reason for, and source of,
this outbreak remains unproven; however, given the known ability of
M. bovis to spread readily between social animals, it is not surprising
that a large group of kennelled hounds presented a pool of compe-
tent, susceptible hosts once the pathogen was introduced. Also
remarkable in this outbreak was its fulminant nature; from the occur-
rence of the index case until the resolution of the outbreak
(7 months), nearly one in ten animals on the premises became clini-
cally sick. TB is usually considered a chronic disease with only a
small percentage of infected individuals becoming clinically unwell
(Eisenhut, 2014). Therefore, this rapid progression to disease in a rel-
atively high proportion of animals can be considered unusual,
although not unheard of, as sporadic fulminant human cases of renal
TB leading to death by acute renal impairment have been reported
(Adzic‐Vukicevic et al., 2017; Dissanayake, 2004; Isao et al., 2006;
Pathan et al., 2001; Punia & Kumar, 2008; da Silva Junior, Brito,
Rabelo, & Saboia, 2016).
The reasons for the fulminant nature of this outbreak are likely
to be multifactorial; a combination of pathogen virulence, host
genetics and phenotype, as well as environmental conditions. There
is a possibility that the pathogen became host‐adapted. However, all
animals from which viable organism was isolated were found to be
infected with genotype 10:a. It may therefore also be the case that
this strain of M. bovis in particular poses some genetic virulence with
respect to the dog, or that it became tolerant to a new host and so
spread amongst the hounds once introduced.
From a host perspective of transmission dynamics, the kennel
stocking density was higher than that recommended by the Masters
of Foxhounds Association (MFHA). This would have created an ideal
opportunity for spread of disease once the index case became clini-
cally sick and infectious. Similarly, the physiological stress of over-
crowding may have made individuals more susceptible to infection.
A number of the kennels were in suboptimal states of repair. This
meant that once the kennels became contaminated, it was almost
impossible to appropriately disinfect them. They have since been
destroyed completely and the kennel has moved to a new, clean site.
Foxhounds per se are known to be at risk of mycobacterial infections
with outbreaks of canine leproid granulomas reported in New Zeal-
and and Australia (Smits et al., 2012). These outbreaks all affected
closely related individuals and so the high level of genetic related-
ness between individuals within this pack could imply that if a
genetic susceptibility, such as a defect in cellular immune response,
did exist, then it would likely have high penetrance.
The majority of the clinical signs in sick hounds were non‐specific
and compatible with those seen due to M. bovis infections in other
species; lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and lymphadenopathy (Isaac,
Whitehead, Adams, Barton, & Coloe, 1983; Murray et al., 2015;
O'Halloran & Gunn‐Moore, 2017). Unusually for companion animals,
every clinically ill animal, those with lesions at PME as well as NVL
hounds that were found to be culture positive, had renal infections.
The kidney is not generally considered a so‐called “target organ” for
mycobacterial infections in companion animals, however, it is the
second most common site of extra‐pulmonary TB in humans, after
lymph nodes (Adzic‐Vukicevic et al., 2017; Murray et al., 2015;
O'Halloran & Gunn‐Moore, 2017; Pesciaroli et al., 2014; da Silva
Junior et al., 2016). Renal tuberculous infections are often consid-
ered to be insidious and present with mild or even subclinical dis-
ease, a significant proportion of cases are incidental findings at
PME (Guarino, Martínez‐Roig, Maiques‐Llacer, González‐Rivero, &
Anguerri‐Feu, 2009; Isao et al., 2006; Punia & Kumar, 2008). In
human cases of infection where irreversible kidney damage occurs,
there are commonly co‐morbidities. Amyloidosis is one such co‐mor-
bidity, particularly recognized across India, which predisposes to
glomerulonephritis and potentially fatal nephrotic syndrome (Chong
et al., 2017; Sanz‐Martín, Samillán‐Sosa Kdel, De Miguel, & Martí-
nez‐Miguel, 2016). This may also be the case for dogs; Foxhounds
have previously been reported to be affected by renal amyloidosis
(Mason & Day, 1996), and this kennel has had previously confirmed
clinical cases, and one of the M. bovis infected hounds was found to
be positive for renal amyloidosis (data not shown).
Other conditions which adversely affect the outcome of renal TB
are the deposition of anti‐mycobacterial antibodies within the glo-
meruli and/or hypercalcaemia which is a common complication of TB
and is directly nephrotoxic (Bellendir, Kochanova, & Nakonechny
1978; Chan et al., 1994; Ko et al., 2004; Zhao, Sun, Xu, & Sun,
2017). It is possible that either of these conditions could have had
an impact on the number of dogs affected and the severity of dis-
ease seen in this outbreak.
The relatively high level of renal immune‐privilege may have
allowed mycobacteria to replicate there whilst avoiding immune
surveillance and clearance (Kurts et al., 2001). All of the hounds with
renal lesions also had positive urine cultures (where these were
available), which suggests that this could be a major source of infec-
tion for onward dog‐to‐dog transmission. However, if contaminated
urine was the main source of infectious material, for example, via
aerosolization, then lung pathology would be expected, but there
were no pulmonary lesions in any of the dogs subjected to PME. In
1880 |
O'HALLORAN ET AL.
 addition, the urine cultures were only found to be positive after
14 weeks of culture suggesting that the initial number of organisms
present was low. Based on the distribution of lesions it would
appear that the mycobacteria arrived in the kidney by haematoge-
nous spread. If so this indicates a distant source of infection which
has not been identified.
Infected urine was identified as a key risk factor for potential
human exposure during the risk assessment of kennel staff, predomi-
nately due to the use of power washers to clean excreta from the
hard standing, which posed a significant risk of aerosolization (Phipps
et al., submitted). The outcome of TB screening for at‐risk humans at
the kennels was that a single individual was diagnosed with latent
TB (Phipps et al., submitted). If urine from infected dogs was heavily
contaminated with M. bovis it would have been likely that a higher
proportion of individuals at risk would have been test positive.
Based on these observational data, it is possible to conclude that
M. bovis infected dogs are likely to be infectious to each other, and
their urine may contaminate their local environment, but that this
may not be the only or even the major route of transmission, and
that the risk to human health is low.
No ante mortem tests have been validated for the diagnosis of
M. bovis infection in dogs; we therefore combined two established
testing methods for other species to try and maximize our diagnostic
sensitivity and bring this outbreak under control. The tests used here
target the disparate arms of the immune response, with the IGRA
evaluating the cell mediated Th1 response whilst the serological
assay used to detect a humoral Th2 response. The percentage of
tested animals deemed to be positive by each test was markedly dif-
ferent with 52% of dogs classed as infected by IGRA at initial
screening but only 12.9% of dogs classed as infected or “at risk” by
serology. This difference is likely due to the dominance of cell medi-
ated immunity in an animals’ response to mycobacterial infection
(Khan, Hunter, & Jagannath, 2016) but further investigation of the
canine immune response to M. bovis and mycobacterial antigens is
needed before this can be shown conclusively, this work is currently
ongoing and will be published separately.
Whilst uncertainty exists with regards to the source of infec-
tion, it seems likely that contaminated fallen stock carcasses were
involved. All culture positive animals had the same genotype iso-
lated, which has not been frequently detected in the area local to
the kennels. This suggests a single introduction with a large dose
of infectious material was likely and that infection then spread
between cohabiting hounds (Reynolds, 2006). One kennel worker
was also diagnosed with latent TB, potentially due to exposure to
infected
hounds
and/or
their
contaminated
feed,
though
this
remains unproven. Though the risk posed by M. bovis infected
hounds to other hounds, cattle herds, local wildlife, their environ-
ment and their human keepers is low, this outbreak demonstrates
that the risk is plausible and real. Resultantly, to try to prevent
such an outbreak from occurring again, the conditions for the col-
lection and use of animal by‐products for feeding to dogs in recog-
nized kennels or packs of hounds have now been amended to ban
the feeding of offal from fallen stock. Similarly, health surveillance
requirements for hounds have been increased by the MFHA. To be
successful, these policy changes will need to be aided, however, by
the future evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy and test develop-
ment for canine TB.
