Key points
r Mammals defend against cold-induced reductions in body temperature through both shivering
and non-shivering thermogenesis. The activation of non-shivering thermogenesis is primarily
driven by uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipose tissue and to a lesser degree by the browning
of white adipose tissue.
r Endurance exercise has also been shown to increase markers of white adipose tissue browning.
r This study aimed to determine whether prior exercise training would alter the response to
a cold challenge and if this would be associated with differences in indices of non-shivering
thermogenesis.
r It is shown that exercise training protects against cold-induced weight loss by increasing food
intake. Exercise-trained mice were better able to maintain their core temperature, independent
of differences in markers of non-shivering thermogenesis.
Abstract Shivering is one of the first defences against cold, and as skeletal muscle fatigues there
is an increased reliance on non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown and beige adipose tissues are the
primary thermogenic tissues regulating this process. Exercise has also been shown to increase
the thermogenic capacity of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Whether exercise has an effect
on the adaptations to cold stress within adipose tissue and skeletal muscle remains to be shown.
Male C57BL/6 mice were either subjected to voluntary wheel running or remained sedentary for
12 days. Exercise led to decreased body weight and increased glucose tolerance. Mice were then
divided into groups kept at 25°C room temperature or a cold challenge of 4°C for 48 h. Exercised
mice were protected against cold-induced reductions in weight and in parallel with increased food
intake. Providing exercised mice with the same amount of food as sedentary mice eliminated the

protection against cold-induced weight loss. Cold exposure led to greater reductions in rectal
temperature in sedentary compared to exercised mice. This protective effect was not explained by
differences in the browning of white adipose tissue or brown adipose tissue mass. Similarly, the
ability of the β3-adrenergic agonist CL 316,243 to increase energy expenditure was attenuated in
previously exercised mice, suggesting that the activation of uncoupling protein-1 in brown and/or
beige adipocytes is not the source of protective effects. We speculate that the protection against
cold-induced reductions in rectal temperature could potentially be linked to exercise-induced
alterations in skeletal muscle.

Introduction
Mammalsinitiateobligatoryheat-conservingmechanisms
when exposed to cold. Initial responses to the cold are
energetically inexpensive and include vasoconstriction
and piloerection and changes in posture in an effort to
reduce surface area (Cannon & Nedergaard, 2011). If these
measures are not effective, endogenous heat generating
mechanisms such as shivering and the activation of brown
adipose tissue (BAT) will be used. Shivering, during
which muscles repeatedly and vigorously contract, utilizes
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce heat. This
process is energetically costly and thus cannot be sustained
for an extended period of time (Manfredi et al. 2013).
As the muscle fatigues, a decrease in shivering intensity
is concomitantly met with an increase in non-shivering
thermogenesis(NST),whichisprimarilymediatedbyBAT
through the activation of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)
(Cannon & Nedergaard, 2004). Previous work has
determined that cold exposure induces the activation of
functionally thermogenic adipocytes within subcutaneous
white adipose tissue (WAT), termed beige adipocytes, of
both rodents and humans (Cousin et al. 1992; Wu et al.
2012). Additionally, recent reports from our lab (Peppler
et al. 2018) and others (Wu et al. 2014; Stanford et al.
2015) have shown that endurance-type exercise such as
voluntary wheel running (VWR) also increases markers
of beige adipocytes, such as the expression of UCP-1, in
the subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) depot in rodents.
It should be noted, however, that similar effects have not
been reported in humans (Zuriaga et al. 2017; Tsiloulis
et al. 2018).
Cold-acclimated UCP-1 knockout (UCP-1 KO) mice
are incapable of recruiting NST, but they are able to
successfully adapt to long-term (weeks) cold exposure
seemingly through an improved shivering capacity
(Nedergaard et al. 2001). This potentially suggests that
exercise may improve the endurance capacity of muscle
during cold exposure to prolong the shivering response,
similar to the effect of cold acclimation improving
shivering capacity in a model devoid of functional BAT.
Previous work has examined the simultaneous effects of
exercise and cold exposure. Treadmill exercise training
of rats in the cold (12°C) increased BAT UCP-1 mRNA
expression whereas training at a warmer temperature
(22°C) did not (Seebacher & Glanville, 2010). Inter-
estingly, the increase in UCP-1 mRNA with exercise
in the cold was greater than the induction with cold
alone. In another study, BAT activity, as determined by
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding, was increased in
cold-exposed rats (6 weeks, 4°C) and this was attenuated
by a single bout of exercise in the cold (Arnold et al.
1986). These apparent discrepancies could be related to
the nature of the exercise performed and/or differences in
temperature.
Although an abundance of research exists on the
independent metabolic effects of cold or exercise, there is
limitedinformationontheinteractionofpreviousexercise
training on the metabolic response to cold. Therefore,
the present study aimed to determine whether prior
exercise training would alter the response to 48 h cold
exposure. We hypothesized that previously exercised mice
would be protected against cold-induced drops in rectal
temperature and this would be associated with greater
increases in markers of WAT browning.
Methods
Ethical approval
The Animal Care Committee at the University of Guelph
approved all procedures outlined in this study (animal use
protocol number 3864), which are in accordance with the
guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and
the recent editorial by Grundy (2015).
Animals and exercise training protocol
To the best of our knowledge studies examining
exercise-induced browning of white adipose tissue have
been completed at temperatures between 22 and 25°C (Xu
et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2014; Peppler et al. 2017, 2018) or the
housing temperatures have not been reported (Bostrom
et al. 2012; Trevellin et al. 2014; Stanford et al. 2015). While

housing mice at temperatures below thermoneutrality
could limit translatability to humans, it has been suggested
by some (Speakman & Keijer, 2012), though not without
debate (Cannon & Nedergaard, 2010), that housing mice
at �23–25°C best mimics human physiology. Given this,
and to remain consistent with previously published work,
mice were housed at �25°C. Eight-week-old male C57BL6
mice (Charles River, Saint-Constant, QC, Canada) were
housed individually at room temperature (RT, �25°C)
and kept on a 12 h:12 h light–dark cycle. Mice were
provided with corncob substrate bedding material, and a
tube for environmental enrichment with ad libitum access
to standard rodent diet (Teklad, Madison, WI, USA; cat
no. 7004) and water. Following �1 week of acclimation,
mice were weight-matched into either a sedentary group
(SED), which were kept in standard shoebox cages, or an
exercisegroup(Ex),whichhadaccesstovoluntaryrunning
wheels in their cages for 12 days. Distance, time spent
running, food intake and body weight were recorded daily.
A total of �120 mice were used in this study over multiple
cohorts.
Glucose tolerance test
On day 8 of the 12-day exercise training intervention,
an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) was
performed at �12.00 h. Mice were fasted 4 h prior to the
GTT and Ex mice did not have access to running wheels
overnight or during the GTT in order to avoid the residual
effects of exercise. Blood glucose was measured using a
handheld glucometer (Freestyle Lite, Abbott Laboratories,
AbbottPark,IL,USA),atbaselineand15,30,45,60,90and
120 min following an I.P. weight-adjusted bolus (2 g kg−1)
injection of D-glucose. Area under the curve (AUC) was
calculated from changes in glucose over time.
Acute cold challenge and tissue collection
Following the exercise intervention, mice were further
assigned to groups that were subjected to either an
acute cold challenge at 4°C in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled refrigerator (Frigidaire, Mississauga,
ON, Canada) or remained at RT (Fig. 1A). We chose to
challenge mice at 4°C as a number of previous studies
have used this degree of cold challenge to examine
adipose tissue and whole-body thermogenesis (Fisher
et al. 2012; Pazos et al. 2015; Madi et al. 2017; Shin et al.
2017; Defour et al. 2018). Four groups were examined
in this study: (i) SED kept at RT (SRT), (ii) exercised
mice kept at RT (ExRT), (iii) SED kept at 4°C (SC), and
(iv) exercised mice kept at 4°C (ExC). Mice that were
previously exercised were removed from cages that had
access to VWR and placed in standard shoebox cages. All
mice housed at RT were provided with environmental
enrichment (bedding material and tube), but with the
exception of corncob substrate, cold challenged mice were
not provided with environmental enrichment to avoid
diminishing thermogenic responses (shivering or NST)
(Gaskill et al. 2013; Blix, 2016). Body weight, food intake,
blood glucose and rectal temperature (TH-5 Thermalert
Monitoring System, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA) were
measured in the fed state immediately prior to (i.e. 0) and
at 2, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after commencing the acute
cold challenge at 09.00 h, or room temperature control.
After 48 h, mice were then anaesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (�5 mg 100 g BW−1) and adipose tissue
depots (iWAT, eWAT, iBAT) skeletal muscles (triceps
and soleus), hypothalamus and blood were collected and
either placed in formalin for histological analyses (adipose
tissues) or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
−80°C until further analysis (Fig. 1A). Mice were killed
by exsanguination following removal of the heart.
Pair feeding and cold exposure
A pair-feeding experiment was designed in order to
delineate if differences in food intake were linked to the
altered response to the cold challenge in trained mice.
Following 12 days of the VWR intervention as described
above, exercised mice were divided into two groups; mice
that were given food ad libitum (ExC ad libitum – ExCal),
or were pair-fed (ExC pair-fed – ExCpf) to the average
foodintakeofSCasdeterminedbytheacutecoldchallenge
(12 g of food/mouse for the entire 48 h cold exposure).
A sedentary control group was included and provided
food ad libitum (SCal). All groups remained at 4°C for
a 48 h period and, as before, body weight, food intake,
blood glucose and rectal temperature were recorded prior
to (0 h) and 2, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h following the start of
cold exposure.

on
acute non-shivering thermogenic capacity, we measured
energy expenditure following acute treatment with the
β3-adrenergic agonist, CL 316,243. Mice (n = 7/group)
were first anaesthetized with an I.P. injection of sodium
pentobarbital (70 mg kg−1 body weight). Pentobarbital
was used because it does not inhibit non-shivering
thermogenic processes and delineates any exacerbated
noise caused by stress from injection and excessive
cage activity, which allows for a steady baseline reading
for all groups (Virtue & Vidal-Puig, 2013; Fischer
et al. 2016; Schreiber et al. 2017). Mice were then
placed into the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring
System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, Columbus,
OH, USA) for approximately 30 min to obtain base-
line measurements. Next, CL 316,243 (1 mg kg−1 body
weight, I.P.) or an equivalent volume of sterile saline was
administered and metabolic assessment continued for an

blood collected for further analyses.
Serum measurements
As
previously
described
(Castellani
et
al.
2014;
MacPherson et al. 2014), serum non-esterified fatty acids
(NEFA) and glycerol concentrations were determined on
a 96-well plate measured using commercially available
kits (NEFA: Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA; Glycerol:
Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada). Serum creatine
kinase was measured using a kit from Pointe Scientific
(Canton, MI, USA).
Histology
Adipose tissues (eWAT, iWAT and BAT) were fixed
in 10% neutral-buffer formalin and processed for
haematoxylin and eosin (H&S) staining as previously
described (Beaudoin et al. 2013). Once processed, images
were captured using an Olympus FSX 100 light micro-
scope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at ×40 magnification.
Qualitative analyses were conducted on iWAT and BAT. In
eWAT, adipocyte size was quantified by a blinded observer
from approximately 300 cells (n = 4 mice/group) using
ImageJ software (Schneider et al. 2012).
Western blotting
Tissue samples were homogenized in 5× (iWAT, eWAT),
15× (BAT), 20× (triceps, soleus), or 60× (hypo-
thalamus) cell lysis buffer (FNN0021 Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada) supplemented with
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor

Protein content was determined using a bicinchoninic
acid assay and samples were prepared using a cocktail

Tris-buffered

night at 4°C with primary antibody. The following day,
membranes were washed for 3 × 5 min with TBST
and then incubated with the corresponding secondary
antibody for 1 h, after which signals were detected
using chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry
(Alpha Innotech, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Ponceau S

Following dissection of all visible blood and connective
tissues and powdering of the triceps and soleus, muscle
glycogen content was determined from 2–3 mg of

Statistical analyses
All data are reported as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test or a
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the effects
of, or interactions between, exercise and cold exposure
were performed and a Fisher’s LSD post hoc test was
completed to locate differences. Data was log10 trans-
formed if normal distribution and/or equal variance tests
failed. Statistical analyses were completed using SigmaPlot
(Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and graphs were
plotted using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
VWR attenuates weight loss and increases food
intake following acute cold exposure
Previous work from our lab (Peppler et al. 2018)
and others (Stanford et al. 2015) has shown that
acute exercise training by VWR can attenuate weight
gain, improve glucose tolerance and increase indices of
browning in white adipose tissue. We first aimed to
determine whether 12 days of VWR would lead to similar
metabolic adaptations as previously demonstrated. Mice
ran 5.4 ± 0.3 km day−1 (Fig. 1B) for 6.3 ± 0.2 h day−1
predominantly during the dark phase (Fig. 1C). Initial
body masses of SED (24.1 ± 0.4 g) and Ex (24.9 ± 0.4 g)
mice did not differ significantly (Fig. 1D). Despite no
differences in food intake throughout the intervention
(P = 0.88; Fig. 1E), Ex mice weighed significantly less
than SED after 12 days of VWR (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1D).
Overall there was a significant (P < 0.001) effect of VWR
on weight gain. SED mice gained weight (1.36 ± 0.33 g),
whereas Ex mice were protected from increases in weight
gain (−0.51 ± 0.27 g). VWR significantly improved
glucose tolerance (P < 0.001), in comparison to SED
controls (Fig. 1F). Protein expression from sedentary and
exercised mice that had been sacrificed immediately after
12 nights of VWR demonstrated the expected increases
in mitochondrial and thermogenic markers in iWAT (Fig.
1G), eWAT (Fig. 1H), BAT (Fig. 1I) and triceps (Fig. 1J).
Note that UCP-1 protein content was not detectable in
eWAT and triceps.
Exercise training attenuates reductions in rectal
temperature, but not the increase in blood glucose,
during acute cold exposure
Having characterized the effects of 12 days of VWR, we
then investigated whether prior VWR had an impact
on the response to cold exposure. SC and ExC mice
ate considerably more food during cold exposure in
comparison to their RT counterparts (P < 0.001),
with ExC mice consuming more than SC (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2A). In line with this finding, cold exposure decreased
the phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 in the hypo-
thalamus(P=0.003;Fig.2B),whichislinkedtoreductions
in food consumption (Kwon et al. 2016). There were no
differences in AMPK phosphorylation between groups.

We were unable to detect the phosphorylated form of
STAT3, a readout of leptin signalling, in the hypothalamus
(not shown). Mice exposed to the cold experienced a
significant reduction in body mass, with the reduction
being attenuated in exercised mice (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C).
There was a main effect of cold (P = 0.042) to reduce
NEFA levels (Fig. 2D) while glycerol concentrations were
unchanged following either intervention Fig. 2E).
To determine if prior exercise training impacted the
ability of mice to maintain temperature during a cold
challenge, we measured rectal temperature at multiple
time points during the 48 h cold exposure. While cold
exposure led to reductions in rectal temperature, this was
attenuated in exercised mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 2F and G).
At RT, blood glucose AUC was reduced in exercised mice
(P < 0.001), while there were no differences between
sedentary and exercised mice during cold exposure
(Fig. 2H and I).
Exercise training and acute cold exposure
independently affect eWAT
To gain insight into potential mechanisms that could
be associated with the protection against cold-induced
reductions in rectal temperature, we assessed lipolytic,
mitochondrial and thermogenic proteins in three distinct
adipose tissue depots. VWR significantly reduced the
tissue mass of eWAT in RT and cold-exposed mice
(P < 0.001) but we found no effect of cold exposure
(Fig. 3A). Changes in tissue mass were reflected by

A–C, food intake was measured (A; n = 22/group) and the hypothalamus was collected following termination to
determine the content of proteins involved in satiety (B; n = 8–9/group). Additionally, the change in body mass
was calculated following cold exposure (C; n = 18–19/group). D and E, NEFA (D) and glycerol (E) concentrations in
the plasma were also determined following termination (n = 5). F and G, rectal temperature was measured as an
indication of core temperature over a period of 48 h, and the AUC was calculated to show overall changes. H and I,
blood glucose was measured in a non-fasted state at the same time points as rectal temperature (n = 18–19/group).

differences in cell morphology (Fig. 3B). In comparison
to SED at RT, VWR (P < 0.001) and cold (P < 0.01)
significantly reduced unilocular fat cell size (Fig. 3C).
It is well known that lipolysis is increased during
cold exposure and this is an important mechanism to
provide fatty acids to skeletal muscle for shivering and BAT
for non-shivering thermogenesis (Cannon & Nedergaard,
2004). Thus, we assessed the protein expression and/or
phosphorylation of select lipolytic enzymes, and markers
of mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 3D and E). There was a
main effect of cold to increase the protein content of ATGL
(P < 0.001), the rate-limiting enzyme initiating lipolysis
(Lass et al. 2011), whereas the phosphorylation of HSL
on both stimulatory (ser563) and inhibitory (ser565) sites
were not different. There was a main effect for exercise to
increase the protein content of the mitochondrial enzymes
PDH-E1α,COXIV(P<0.05)andCORE1(P<0.01)while
there was a trend for cold to increase PGC-1α (P = 0.088).
While some have reported that gonadal adipose tissue is
susceptible to browning (Neinast et al. 2015), we were
unable to detect UCP-1 protein content in any of the
groups.
Cold-induced adaptations in iWAT are not impacted
by previous exercise training
Inguinal subcutaneous WAT is particularly responsive
to exercise and cold with recent studies demonstrating
the appearance of ‘beige’ adipocytes with these inter-
ventions (Cinti, 2002; Stanford & Goodyear, 2017). We
thus examined the effects of cold exposure on iWAT
morphology from sedentary or exercised mice. A main
effectofexercise(P=0.002)andcoldexposure(P<0.001)
was observed, demonstrating reductions in iWAT tissue
mass (Fig. 4A). As expected, SRT appeared to have
primarily large, unilocular adipocytes and ExRT mice
displayed drastically smaller adipocytes with some clusters
of multilocular cells, as indicated by the black arrows

(Fig. 4B). Following acute cold exposure, there were clear
qualitative differences in iWAT histology in comparison to
RT mice, with large numbers of multilocular adipocytes
in both sedentary and trained mice. The percentage of
multilocular cells within a given field of view yielded
similar values between SC and ExC (Fig. 4C). Of note,
the observed degree of multilocularity within a single
adipocyte differed amongst SC and ExC. Overall, ExC
mice appeared to have smaller lipid droplets arranged in a
denser composition than SC.
A hallmark feature of ‘browned’ white adipose tissue
is the presence of UCP-1. Similar to the appearance of
multilocular fat cells, cold exposure, in both sedentary
and exercised mice increased the protein content of
UCP-1 (P < 0.001), along with increases in the content
of ATGL (P < 0.05) and PGC-1α (P < 0.001), which
trended towards an increase with exercise as well (Fig. 4D
and E). Additionally, the mitochondrial enzyme CORE1
trended towards an increase with exercise (P = 0.071). In
comparison to RT, exercise (P < 0.01) and cold exposure
(P < 0.001) had a robust effect on the protein content of
COXIV. In contrast, phosphorylation of HSL at serine 563
was lower after cold exposure (P < 0.001).
Prior exercise training does not impact the effect of
cold exposure on BAT
Brown adipose tissue is the primary organ involved in
non-shivering thermogenesis (Cannon & Nedergaard,
2004) and thus we wanted to determine if VWR
impacted the response of this tissue to cold exposure. Not

revealed parallel qualitative changes in morphological
features; SRT and ExRT mice were observed to have a
similar frequency of multilocular adipocytes containing
small lipid droplets, which appeared to be enhanced
by cold exposure (Fig. 5C). These observations, albeit
qualitative not quantitative, were comparable between
sedentary and exercised mice that were exposed to the
cold.
As BAT lipolysis is an important step in providing
substrate to fuel NST (Cannon & Nedergaard, 2004),
we measured indices of lipolysis and detected significant
increases in the phosphorylation of HSL at serine 563
(P < 0.05) alongside decreases in ATGL protein content
and phosphorylation of HSL at serine 565 (P < 0.05;
Fig. 5C and D). AMPK phosphorylation at threonine 172
was significantly increased by cold exposure (P = 0.034).
Surprisingly we did not detect increases in the content
of UCP-1, PGC-1α or other mitochondrial proteins, and
in fact observed a reduction in the protein content of
PDH-E1α (P < 0.05), CORE1 (P = 0.108) and PGC-1α
(P < 0.01) after cold exposure.
Chemically induced non-shivering thermogenesis
is reduced in previously trained mice
Non-shivering thermogenesis is dependent upon the
activation of UCP-1 by the sympathetic nervous system.
Given the lack of response in BAT to cold exposure,
regardless of prior exercise, we aimed to determine if the
acute thermogenic response to β-adrenergic stimulation
was altered with prior exercise. As before, previously
exercised mice weighed less (sedentary 27.4 ± 0.6,
exercised 24.4 ± 0.3 g, P < 0.001) and had less eWAT
(sedentary 614 ± 59, exercised 233 ± 18 mg, P < 0.001)
and iWAT (sedentary 342 ± 28, exercised 171 ± 10 mg,
P < 0.001) compared to sedentary mice. Sedentary or
exercised mice were anaesthetized (Fig. 6A) and were
injected with either saline or CL 316,243 (CL) and serum
NEFA/glycerol concentrations, oxygen consumption and
energy expenditure were measured. CL specifically targets
the β3-adrenergic receptors, which are predominantly
found on white and brown adipocytes (Emorine et al.
1989), and has been used as a tool to examine the capacity

treatment significantly increased NEFA (Fig. 6B) and
glycerol (Fig. 6C) serum concentrations (P < 0.001).
The effect of CL on serum NEFA was reduced with
exercise (P < 0.01). CL treatment of sedentary mice
drastically increased oxygen consumption and energy
expenditure (P < 0.001; Fig. 6D–G) in both exercise
and sedentary mice. Interestingly, CL-induced increases
in energy expenditure were attenuated in exercised mice
(P = 0.045; Fig. 6G). There were no differences between
groups in average RER following either saline or CL
treatment (sedentary saline 0.74 ± 0.01, exercise saline
0.72 ± 0.02, sedentary CL 0.74 ± 0.01, exercise CL
0.72 ± 0.01).
Increases in food intake accounts for changes in body
mass but is not associated with exercise-induced
increases in body temperature during cold exposure
Given the increased hyperphagic response of exercised
mice in comparison to sedentary mice during cold
exposure, we sought to determine whether these increases
in food intake could be associated with the protection
against cold-induced weight loss and/or reductions in
rectal temperature. To address this question, exercised
mice were provided with the same amount of food as the
sedentary control animals or fed ad libitum, during a 48 h
cold exposure. Accordingly, SCal (sedentary, cold-exposed
mice given ad libitum food) and ExCpf (exercise-trained,
cold-exposed mice pair-fed to the average consumption
of sedentary controls) consumed equal amounts of food
and ExCal (exercise-trained, cold-exposed mice given ad
libitum food) consumed significantly more than both
groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 7A). There were no differences
in phosphorylated AMPK or Akt protein content between
groups in the hypothalamus (Fig. 7B).
After cold exposure, ExCal lost significantly less weight
than both the SCal (P = 0.022) and ExCpf (P = 0.04) mice
(Fig. 7C). Interestingly, despite differences in food intake
and weight loss, the protection against cold-induced drops
in rectal temperature were similar in ExCal and ExCpf
groups (Fig. 7D and E) while there was no change in blood

Effects in skeletal muscle following exercise
and acute cold exposure
Skeletal muscles undergo similar metabolic changes
following exercise and cold exposure (Castellani &
Young, 2016), as these interventions both involve
vigorous muscular contractions. Given this, we wanted
to determine if the protection against cold-induced drops
in rectal temperature in exercised mice was associated
with differences in markers of mitochondrial content or
glycogen use. We assessed changes in triceps and soleus
muscles as this would provide insight into potential fibre
type-specific differences. In triceps, there was a main
effect of exercise (P = 0.016) and a marginal effect of
cold exposure (P = 0.062) on glycogen concentrations
(Fig. 8A). Exercised mice exhibited a �2.5-fold greater
reduction in glycogen content when exposed to the cold in
comparison to sedentary mice (P = 0.004; Fig. 8B). When
expressed as a percentage reduction in glycogen compared
to room temperature values, a similar relationship was
seen (sedentary 8.9 ± 3.3, exercise 20.6 ± 3.2% decline
P = 0.019). Glycogen content was increased in soleus
muscles from exercised mice (Fig. 8E), while there was no
effect of cold (Fig. 8E). The relative change in glycogen
expressed as either absolute values (Fig. 8F) or as a
percentage (sedentary 6.5 ± 13.4, exercise 6.3 ± 7.6%
increase, P = 0.98) was not different between sedentary
and exercised mice.
To characterize markers of mitochondrial biogenesis
following exercise and cold exposure, protein expression
was analysed in triceps (Fig. 8C and D) and soleus
(Fig. 8G and H) muscles. In triceps, there was a
trend towards an increase in COXIV (P = 0.074) and

effect of cold exposure. In soleus muscle both exercise
and cold increased HKII, whereas exercise increased
(P < 0.001), but cold reduced (P < 0.05) PGC-1α protein
content.
Previous investigations have used circulating creatine
kinase activity as a surrogate marker of cold-induced
shivering in mice (Fisher et al. 2012; Tran et al. 2016). In
the current investigation, there was a main effect of cold
(P = 0.037) to increase serum creatine kinase activity (SRT
160 ± 48 U L−1, ExRT 118 ± 30 U L−1, SC 274 ± 85 U L−1,
ExC 152 ± 30 U L−1).
Some (Bal et al. 2016), though not all (Golozoubova
et al. 2001), have suggested a role of skeletal muscle in NST.
In particular uncoupling protein 3 (UCP-3) (Vidal-Puig
et al. 2000), the primary UCP in skeletal muscle, and
sarcolipin (Bal et al. 2012), a protein that regulates the
activityofsarcoendoplasmicreticulumCa2+-ATPase,have
been implicated in this process. With these points in
mind we sought to determine if the protection against
cold-induceddropsinrectaltemperatureinexercisedmice
could beassociated with greater increases in UCP-3and/or

Discussion
A renewed interest in the field of thermogenesis has
generated a considerable amount of research aimed at
developing methods to increase thermogenic capacity
and subsequently energy expenditure, given the potential
importance these strategies may have on improving
metabolic health (Aldiss et al. 2017; Jankovic et al. 2017;
Liu et al. 2017). Two stimulators of thermogenesis, exercise
and cold exposure, have been previously described in this
regard (Smith & Roberts, 1964; Norheim et al. 2014).
However, the synergistic effects of prior exercise training
and cold exposure remain poorly understood (Castellani
& Tipton, 2015). In this study, we show that prior exercise
training by VWR alters the response to cold exposure, in
which mice are protected against cold-induced weight loss
and reductions in rectal temperature. While the former
may be accounted for by increases in food consumption,
both responses are independent of increases in markers of
cold-induced NST in WAT and BAT. These experiments
were completed in male mice and further work is required
to determine if there is a sex-specific effect of prior exercise
on cold-induced thermoregulation.
Our data complement previous reports (Stanford et al.
2015; Peppler et al. 2018) showing that short-term
exercise via VWR attenuates weight gain, improves glucose
tolerance and increases thermogenic markers in WAT.
Similar to the temporal effects of exercise in rodents
(Kelly et al. 2011), a dynamic remodelling period occurs
during acute (<7 days) cold exposure (Jia et al. 2016). For
example, Jia et al. (2016) reported drastic reductions in
body and WAT mass coupled with significant increases
in food intake occurring after 48 h at 4°C. In the
current study following 48 h of cold exposure, we have
shown that exercised mice were partially protected against
cold-induced weight loss and this occurred in parallel
with increases in food intake. Our findings are similar
to previous reports that used models of simultaneous
cold exposure and exercise (Omata, 1990; Vaanholt et al.
2007), and demonstrated increases in food intake in
the cold with exercise compared to running at room
temperature. When we pair-fed exercised mice and
sedentary mice, the protective effect of prior exercise
against cold-induced weight loss was prevented. Together,
these data indicate that the amount of food consumed
during cold exposure plays a large role in the protective
effect against weight loss in exercise-trained mice. Mice
are more susceptible to heat loss than larger mammals
due to their smaller surface-to-volume ratio, and thus
insulation is an important defence against low ambient
temperatures(Vaanholtetal.2007;Cannon&Nedergaard,
2009). In this study, it is possible that exercised mice are
compensating for the loss of insulative tissue by increasing
food consumption in the cold.
In addition to weight loss, our study determined that
acute cold exposure led to reductions in rectal temperature
and this effect was attenuated with exercise, findings which
are consistent with previous reports in rats following
a short-term (3–6 h) cold exposure (Chin et al. 1973;
McDonald et al. 1988). In contrast to cold-induced
changesinbodymass,theprotectiveeffectofpriorexercise
was not dependent on increases in food consumption as
we found that pair-fed exercised mice maintained a similar
rectal temperature during cold exposure in comparison
to mice given ad lib access to food. Numerous reports
have shown that UCP-1-mediated BAT thermogenesis is
essential, even for short-term cold exposure (Bartelt et al.
2011;Yoneshiro&Saito,2015).Giventhiswehypothesized
that perhaps NST could be mitigating the protective
effects of exercise against cold-induced drops in rectal
temperature. However, our study provides evidence that
this was not the case, as the protein content of UCP-1 and
PGC-1α in BAT was not increased despite the appearance
of enhanced multilocularity in the cold-exposed mice,
as depicted by the representative histology. Moreover,
despite a protection against cold-induced drops in rectal
temperature, the increase in interscapular BAT mass was
not greater in previously trained mice.
It should be noted that in the present study, sedentary
and exercised mice were maintained at �25°C during the
exercise protocol, which falls below the thermoneutral
zone of a mouse (29–31°C) (Cannon & Nedergaard,
2004; Fischer et al. 2018). Mice are under mild thermo-
regulatory stress in normal housing conditions, driving a
constant increase in metabolism to compensate for heat
loss(Tsch¨
opetal.2011),whichmayprovokeunintentional
increases in NST (Kalinovich et al. 2017; Fischer et al.
2018). Thus, during cold exposure, mice are already
partially acclimated, which may at least in part explain the
lack of a cold-induced response in thermogenic protein
expression in BAT. It would be interesting to determine
whether exercise training in thermoneutral conditions
would alter the response to cold stress.
In addition to BAT, iWAT has recently been suggested
to be a thermogenic organ (Cinti, 2002; Kajimura et al.
2015). Pioneering work by Stanford and colleagues (2015)
have shown that short-term VWR increases indices of
‘browning’ in this depot, exhibited by an increase in
UCP-1 gene and protein expression as well as the pre-
sence of multilocular adipocytes, and recent work from
our lab (Peppler et al. 2018) supports these findings.

Herein, we found that despite iWAT being responsive
to VWR, cold-induced changes in iWAT were similar
between groups as shown by equivalent increases in the
number of multilocular fat cells and the protein content
of UCP-1. This is consistent with previous work by our
lab (Peppler et al. 2018), suggesting that iWAT browning
is not required for exercise-induced changes in whole
body thermoregulation and metabolism. Additionally,
we demonstrated that increases in energy expenditure
induced by the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL 316,243,
an agent that activates UCP-1 (Crane et al. 2014) in both
white and brown adipose tissue depots and has been used
as a surrogate of NST capacity (Crane et al. 2014), was not
enhanced in exercised mice. These results are consistent
with early work demonstrating that exercise did not alter
the metabolic response to noradrenaline, a hormone that
targets multiple adrenergic receptors, in rats (Stromme
& Hammel, 1967). Collectively, these findings provide
evidence that NST (in either WAT or BAT) likely does not
account for the altered response to cold stress observed in
previously exercised mice.
Shivering is an important mechanism that generates
heat during cold exposure. The importance of shivering
has been highlighted by an investigation using UCP-1
KO mice. In this study UCP-1-deficient mice were first
acclimated, or not, to 18°C for 4 weeks before being
exposed to 4°C. This acclimation period resulted in
increasesinmarkersofskeletalmusclefattyacidoxidation,
likely as a result of the sustained muscular activity that
occurredduringshivering.Whencoldtoleranceat4°Cwas
subsequently measured, the cold acclimated UCP-1 KO
mice were protected against cold-induced drops in rectal
temperature (Shabalina et al. 2010). Similar to prolonged
shivering during cold acclimation, exercise training also
increases skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (Holloszy,
1967) and perhaps this could lead to enhanced shivering
or fatigue resistance in the cold. In an effort to address
this question we measured serum creatine kinase activity,
a marker of cold-induced shivering used by several other
groups (Fisher et al. 2012; Tran et al. 2016). While we
found a main effect of cold on serum creatine kinase there
were no differences between sedentary and exercised mice.
Although somewhat unexpected this could potentially
be explained by differences in clearance. Alternatively,
and perhaps more likely, VWR induces muscle damage
and remodelling (Irintchev & Wernig, 1987), which may
protect against the muscle damage induced by prolonged
shivering. A limitation of the current study is that skeletal
muscleEMGactivitywasnotrecordedduringtheduration
of the cold exposure. This data would provide direct
insight into if the protection against cold-induced drops
in rectal temperature, were in fact due to enhanced
shivering in previously trained mice, a conclusion that
cannot be drawn from our serum creatine kinase
data.
In addition to muscle oxidative capacity, increases
in muscle glycogen content have been associated with
enhanced cold tolerance. Acutely increasing muscle
glycogen by either a fasting-refeeding protocol, or a
3 h bout of swimming followed by a 24 h recovery
period resulted in increases in cold tolerance when mice
were exposed to −5°C (LeBlanc & Labrie, 1981). As
these acute interventions would not increase oxidative
capacity, it would perhaps suggest an important role for
glycogen availability in fuelling thermogenic mechanisms
within muscle. In this regard, we found a main effect of
exercise to increase muscle glycogen in triceps muscles and
muscle glycogen utilization, as estimated by the difference
between RT and cold conditions, was �2.5-fold greater in
exercised compared to sedentary mice.
While not without controversy (Golozoubova et al.
2001), some have suggested the existence of muscle based
non-shivering thermogenesis mediated by the protein
sarcolipin(Baletal.2012).Incontrasttopreviousfindings,
which reported increases in sarcolipin protein content
following 9 days of cold exposure (Bal et al. 2016),
we were unable to detect sarcolipin content in soleus
muscles from cold-exposed mice. Conversely, sarcolipin
was detected in soleus muscles from trained mice, findings
that are consistent with previous work reporting increases
in sarcolipin mRNA expression in soleus muscles from
mice that had access to voluntary running wheels for
6 weeks (Campbell & Dicke, 2018). These findings
provide associative evidence that perhaps sarcolipin could
be involved in the training-induced protection against
reductions in rectal temperature in cold-exposed mice.
The data reported in this paper provide fundamental
advances
regarding
the
metabolic
adaptations
to
post-exercise cold exposure in rodents. Our primary
findings are twofold: (1) prior exercise via VWR protects
against cold-induced weight loss, through a mechanism
involving increases in food intake, and (2) prior exercise
via VWR protects against cold-induced reductions in
rectal temperature. The mechanisms relating to the latter
remainunclear,butwespeculatethatNSTisnotmediating
this, as cold-induced increases in BAT mass, iWAT UCP-1
protein content and CL 316,243 induced increases in
energy expenditure, a marker of NST, were not greater
in previously exercised mice. We speculate that prior
exercise training could potentially enhance the capacity
for muscle-based thermogenesis and this could be linked
to the attenuated drop in rectal temperature during cold
exposure.
