Abstract
Background: Few studies have explored the relationship between air pollution and fertility. We used a natural
experiment in California when coal and oil power plants retired to estimate associations with nearby fertility rates.
Methods: We used a difference-in-differences negative binomial model on the incident rate ratio scale to analyze
the change in annual fertility rates among California mothers living within 0-5 km and 5-10 km of 8 retired power
plants between 2001 and 2011. The difference-in-differences method isolates the portion of the pre- versus post-
retirement contrast in the 0-5 km and 5-10 km bins, respectively, that is due to retirement rather than secular
trends. We controlled for secular trends with mothers living 10-20 km away. Adjusted models included fixed effects
for power plant, proportion Hispanic, Black, high school educated, and aged > 30 years mothers, and neighborhood
poverty and educational attainment.
Results: Analyses included 58,909 live births. In adjusted models, we estimated that after power plant retirement
annual fertility rates per 1000 women aged 15–44 years increased by 8 births within 5 km and 2 births within 5-10 km
of power plants, corresponding to incident rate ratios of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.4) and 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0–1.2), respectively. We
implemented a negative exposure control by randomly selecting power plants that did not retire and repeating our
analysis with those locations using the retirement dates from original 8 power plants. There was no association,
suggesting that statewide temporal trends may not account for results.
Conclusions: Fertility rates among nearby populations appeared to increase after coal and oil power plant retirements.
Our study design limited the possibility that our findings resulted from temporal trends or changes in population
composition. These results require confirmation in other populations, given known methodological limitations of
ecologic study designs.

Introduction
Oil and coal power plants can emit significant air pollu-
tion, including particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), benzene, lead, mercury, and other known health
hazards [1]. The amount of emitted pollution varies,
however, based on fuel usage and type, control technolo-
gies (e.g., scrubbers), stack heights, and meteorological
conditions [2]. While populations living closest to power
plants experience higher levels of primary air pollutants,
substantial exposure to secondary particulate matter can
occur up to 500 km away [3].
Residential proximity to power plants has been linked
to health outcomes such as cardiovascular and respira-
tory disease [4] and adverse birth outcomes [5, 6]. Coal
and oil plants, especially older and less efficient ones,
typically emit more pollution than those run on natural
gas [7]. Between 2007 and 2016 coal-fired electricity
generation dropped by 40% in the U.S [8]. Future coal
and oil power plant retirements–driven by energy effi-
ciency, abundant and cheap natural gas, and legislation
related to climate change–may benefit the health of
those living nearby.

 Another possible result of power plant retirement is
improved fertility among nearby populations. Some evi-
dence suggests links between environmental factors and
infertility [9], but few studies have investigated the role
of air pollution on reproductive outcomes such as live
birth rates, infertility, and miscarriage [10]. Three studies
have reported associations between traffic-related air
pollution and longer time-to-pregnancy, infertility, and
spontaneous abortion [11–13]. Fewer than expected mis-
carriages and stillbirths were reported after a coal plant
retirement in Croatia [14].
Only Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2014) have examined the
relationship between air pollution and fertility rates in a
general population. They reported an association be-
tween higher levels of traffic-related pollution and coarse
fraction particulate matter (PM2.5–10) in Barcelona and
reduced fertility [15]. The components of air pollution
differ between that generated by traffic and power
plants, however, and the authors noted the potential for
residual confounding due to their ecological design.
Research suggests that residential proximity to indus-
trial facilities, including power plants, is also associated
with adverse mental health outcomes, including stress
and depression, due to perceptions of neighborhood dis-
order and feelings of personal powerlessness [16, 17].
This
may
have
implications
for
fertility
based
on
evidence linking higher levels of stress with difficulty
conceiving [18].
We sought to expand this limited research by capital-
izing on a natural experiment when 8 coal and oil power
plants retired in California between 2001 and 2011. Nat-
ural experiments enable researchers to investigate the
impact of modifiable factors or interventions on health
outcomes by exploiting changes in exposure that are
difficult to manipulate experimentally [19]. Natural ex-
periments effectively randomize exposure, reducing the
threat of residual confounding inherent in observational
studies [20]. We implemented a quasi-experimental
difference-in-differences approach to estimate the asso-
ciation between coal and oil power plant retirements
and nearby fertility rates.
Methods
Study population
We obtained birth certificate data from January 1, 2001
to December 31, 2011 from the California Department
of Public Health. We abstracted infant sex and birth
date, maternal address, age, date of last menstrual period
(LMP), race/ethnicity, and educational attainment from
birth certificates. After exclusions (Additional file 1:
Figure S1, available in Supplement), 558,308 live births
took place within 20 km of a retiring coal or oil power
plant during the study period.
Power plant exposure
We downloaded data on coal and oil power plants in
California from the U.S. Energy Information Agency
(EIA) [8], the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Air Markets Program [21], and the California
EPA Air Resources Board (CARB) [22]. These data
contained plant latitude and longitude, fuel type, start
date, retirement date, and monthly fuel consumption.
CARB also provided annual NOx emissions data on
power plants that retired after 2007. We obtained
NOx emissions data on the Hunters Point plant from
the EPA Air Markets Program database but were un-
able to locate emissions data on the two smallest
power plants that retired in 2002. We included power
plants as exposure areas in the analysis if they used
coal or oil as a primary fuel (e.g., bituminous coal,
distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil) and if they re-
tired between 2001 and 2011. Eight California power
plants met these criteria (Fig. 1), 6 oil and 2 coal.
Two power plants were eventually converted to burn
biomass,
but
this
transition
required
additional
permitting and took over a year, meaning they were
not active during the study period. For simplicity, we
refer to the date of retirement from coal or oil use as
“retirement,” even if the plant later transitioned to a
new fuel.
Based on maternal address at the time of delivery, we
used QGIS (qgis.org, QGIS Development Team) to iden-
tify births that took place within a 20 km radius of one of
the eight power plants. In order to assess a gradient of ex-
posure, we assigned each birth to one of three area bins
within the larger 20 km-radius circular area: 0-5 km; 5-
10 km; and 10-20 km from a power plant. We used these
area bins–0-5 km; 5-10 km; and 10-20 km–and the popu-
lation of women aged 15–44 years living within them
as the units of analysis. Next, we applied temporal re-
striction criteria. We defined births to mothers with
an LMP in the year following power plant retirement
as unexposed and births to mothers with an LMP be-
tween 1 and 2 years prior to power plant retirement
as
exposed
(Fig.
2).
These
definitions
had
the
advantage of providing a one-year washout period
and of matching exposed and unexposed periods to
account for fixed cohort bias, seasonal trends in fer-
tility, and power plant emissions (which peak during
the summer months). We anticipated that fertility
trends among women living 10-20 km from power
plants would be similar to those located ≤10 km in
the absence of power plant retirements. Compared to
a ≤ 10 km group, the 10-20 km group would expe-
rience a smaller change in power plant-related expo-
sure after retirement. Therefore, this 10-20 km group
allowed us to control for temporal trends in fertility
and isolate changes due to plant retirement.

 Fertility rate
For each of the 8 plants, we estimated the number of
women aged 15–44 years living within 20 km before and
after retirement using block group level data from the
closest, non-overlapping censuses: 2000 U.S. census and
2005–2009, 2006–2010, 2008–2012, 2009–2013, and
2011–2015 American Community Survey (ACS) [23].
For example, the Kings Beach plant retired in December
2002 and we estimated the population before retirement
with 2000 census data and the population after retire-
ment with 2005–2009 ACS data. When block groups did
not
fall
entirely
in
specific
area
bins,
we
used
geographic-area weighting to allocate the population.
We operationalized fertility rate as the number of live

 births per 1000 women aged 15–44 years within 5 km,
5-10 km, and 10-20 km of power plants before and after
retirement.
Neighborhood data
For our primary analysis, we downloaded block group
level data on the number of individuals living below the
federal poverty threshold and who attained less than a
high school education from the 2000 U.S. census and
the ACS [23]. Based on mother’s address at the time of
birth we linked block group data. In sensitivity analyses
we used additional years of ACS data as described below.
We also obtained address-level 2005–2011 annual fore-
closure data across California from CoreLogic (formerly
DataQuick), which we assigned based on mother’s
census block group and infant’s birth year.
Statistical analysis
We used a difference-in-differences design [24] to com-
pare fertility rates within 20 km of power plants before
and after retirement. The difference-in-differences method
isolates the portion of the pre- versus post-retirement
contrast in the 0-5 km and 5-10 km bins, respectively, that
is due to retirement rather than secular trends [24]. We
used a negative binomial model to estimate the associ-
ation between power plant retirements and annual fertility
rates on the incident rate ratio scale [25]. Under the as-
sumption that secular trends are parallel in both groups
and that the negative binomial was correctly specified, the
resulting difference-in-differences estimator corresponds
to log-fertility incidence rate ratio. We obtained the
difference-in-differences estimates from the product inter-
action term of two indicator variables: one for the area bin
(i.e., 0-5 km or 5-10 km, with 10-20 km as the reference)
and one for exposure (i.e., post-retirement, with pre-
retirement as the reference). We hypothesized that we
would
observe
a
difference-in-differences
estimators
greater than 1, representing increased fertility rates in the
communities 0-5 km and 5-10 km from the power plants
after retirement. We identified predictors of fertility a
priori [26–28] and controlled for them to increase preci-
sion of our model [29, 30]. Adjusted models included
fixed effects for power plant, and the proportion births to
mothers ≥30 years, mothers of Black or Hispanic race/eth-
nicity, and mothers with ≤ a high school degree in each
plant-area bin. They also included census block group
poverty and educational attainment to account for neigh-
borhood characteristics. Finally, we used the estimated
parameters of the adjusted negative binomial model to
calculate the number of births per 1000 women at the
mean values of all covariates. Regression analyses were im-
plemented in Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX) and R Statistical Software, version 3.3.2 (R-
project.org, R Core Team).
Sensitivity analyses
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, to assess
if small numbers were driving the observed associations,
we repeated the analysis after omitting Kings Beach and
Portola plants, the plants with the fewest women of
childbearing age living within 20 km. Second, we strati-
fied the overall analyses by primary fuel type: coal or oil.
Third, we implemented a negative exposure control [31]
by randomly selecting 8 operational (i.e., non-retiring)
power plants in California. We repeated the analyses
using the geographic location of these operating plants
and by randomly assigning to them the retirement dates
of the original 8 retired plants. An association with the
negative exposure control would have suggested that ob-
served temporal changes in fertility were unrelated to
power plant retirement.
Demographic shifts, particularly those related to the
Great Recession, a period of substantial economic down-
turn, and the housing foreclosure crisis that peaked in
California in the summer of 2008 [32–34], could have in-
fluenced our results. Because block group level ACS data
only exists in 5-year windows, we included the annual
number of block group level foreclosures as an indicator
of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and re-ran
analyses for the years 2005–2011. We also used block
group level data [23] prior to and after power plant retire-
ments to explore changes in the number and composition
of people living near plants after they retired. We esti-
mated the change in the number of total, non-Hispanic
white residents, and women aged 15–44 years, the percent
of population living below the federal poverty threshold,
and median household income.
Finally, we linked daily PM2.5 data from the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air
Quality Model (CMAQ) to mothers’ block groups to as-
sess changes in air pollution exposures near retiring power
plants. We compared average annual PM2.5 levels in the
1–2 years prior to the year after power plant retirements.
Results
Eight California power plants–2 coal and 6 oil–retired be-
tween 2001 and 2011 (Additional file 1: Table S1 available
in supplement). The U.S. EIA reported that the amount of
coal used for electricity generation in California declined
over the study period from nearly 1 million short tons per
year in 2000 to 539,439 short tons in 2012 [35]. The
amount of distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil also
declined (Additional file 1: eFigure S2 available in supple-
ment). Average nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the
8 power plants in our analysis fell from 177 tons in the
year prior to retirements to 4 tons per year in the year
post-retirement [21, 22]. CMAQ data also suggested larger
reductions in PM2.5 after power plant retirement in the <
5 km area bin (median pre vs. post: 12.8 μg/m3 vs. 10.
Casey et al. Environmental Health  (2018) 17:44

 8 μg/m3) compared to the 10-20 km area bin (median pre
vs. post: 10.8 μg/m3 vs. 10.2 μg/m3) (Additional file 1:
eTable S2).
The main analysis included 58,909 live births. We ob-
served an average annual fertility rate of 45 births per
1000 women aged 15–44 years (SD = 24). Temporal
trends in maternal and neighborhood characteristics ap-
peared similar by area bin (Table 1). We did note, how-
ever, a greater increase in the proportion of births to
Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black mothers in the < 5 km
bin compared to the 5-10 km and 10-20 km bins. The
number of foreclosures increased across all three expos-
ure buffers in the unexposed period, reflecting temporal
changes in the housing market.
Unadjusted fertility rates varied by power plant and
area bin (Fig. 3). We expected minimal confounding due
to the difference-in-differences design, and a comparison
of point estimates between the unadjusted and adjusted
models suggested that the included covariates did not
confound the association (Table 2). In the < 5 km area
bin, the incident rate ratio (IRR) from the adjusted
model was 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.4); this corresponds to an
annual fertility rate of 51 births per 1000 women aged
15–44 years post-retirement and 43 births per 1000
women aged 15–44 years pre-retirement. In the 5-10 km
buffer, the IRR was 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0–1.2), corresponding
to an annual fertility rate of 47 births per 1000 women
aged 15–44 years post-retirement and 45 births per 1000
women aged 15–44 years pre-retirement. We observed
little change in annual fertility rates in the 10-20 km
area bin; the annual fertility rate in the pre-period was
41 (95% CI: 26–57) compared to 42 (95% CI: 25–59) live
births per 1000 women aged 15–44 years in the post-
period.
We completed several robustness checks. When we
omitted two power plants with the fewest women of
childbearing age living nearby results remained similar
(IRR = 1.2 [95% CI: 1.0–1.4], IRR = 1.1 [95% CI: 1.0–1.3]
in the 0-5 km and 5-10 km bins, respectively). This
suggests small, variable rates did not drive the observed
association. We observed little change in adjusted asso-
ciations when stratifying the overall analysis by primary
fuel type, except we no longer observed an association
between power plant retirement and fertility rates in the
5-10 km bin for coal power plants (Additional file 1:
Table S3). While the 10-20 km bins controlled for secu-
lar trends local to each plant, in order to further assess
the possible effect of statewide trends on our results we
implemented negative exposure control analysis, using
power plants that did not retire during the study period.
This
included
biomass,
geothermal,
hydroelectric,
natural gas, oil, and solar plants. When combining the
location of these plants and their surrounding births
with the retirement dates of the original eight power
plants we found no significant changes in fertility rates
(IRR = 1.1 [95% CI: 0.8–1.3] and IRR = 1.1 [95% CI: 0.9–

 1.3] in the 0-5 km and 5-10 km bins, respectively,
Additional file 1: Table S4). This result suggested that
statewide temporal trends may not have accounted for
our results. When we integrated foreclosures occurring
in the year of birth in block groups within each bin, esti-
mates remained similar (7 additional births per 1000
women in the 0-5 km bin and 1 additional birth per
1000 women in the 5-10 km bin, Additional file 1: Table
S5). Finally, we did not identify any major population
shifts between the unexposed and exposed time periods
that could explain results (Additional file 1: Table S6).
Discussion
Our study leveraged a natural experiment of 8 coal and
oil power plants retirements and found an association
with increased fertility rates nearby. Annual fertility rates
increased by 8 births per 1000 women aged 15–44 years
in the immediate 5 km radius. We observed a gradient,
fertility increased the most within 5 km and to a lesser
extent
within
5-10
km.
Because
exposed
periods
occurred prior to unexposed periods and several plant
retirements occurred proximal to the housing foreclos-
ure crisis [32–34] temporal trends could have influenced
our results. Therefore, we conducted several sensitivity
analyses to
assess
demographic changes
over
time
among residents living near power plants. We found no
evidence that these compositional changes explained our
findings.
Prior literature has assessed the association between
power plant proximity and birth outcomes [5, 6, 36, 37].

 We extended this literature, finding an association
between power plant retirements and increased fertility.
Combustion of petroleum products releases numerous
air pollutants, such as SO2, NOx, PM, and trace metals
like mercury [38] previously linked to reduced human
fertility [11, 15]. Stress and mental
health among
individuals living near power plants may also have
played a role [18].
Several mechanisms could explain our findings of in-
creased fertility in the year following plant retirements.
Fecundability (i.e., the probability of conception) may
have improved. Even exposure to relatively low levels of
PM2.5, PM10, and ozone has been associated with
changes in sperm morphology and increases in sperm
containing increased DNA fragmentation [39]. In a
Czech study of 1916 couples, a 10 μg/m3 increase in
PM2.5 level was associated with a 22% reduction in
fecundability [40]. Air pollution may lead to oxidative
stress
or
endocrine
disruption
that
could
explain
observed
changes
in
sperm
and
conception
more
broadly.
In
vitro
fertilization
studies
have
also
demonstrated associations between some–NO2, PM2.5,
and PM10–but not all, air pollutants and disrupted
fertilization and implantation [41–43].
Prior literature has reported changes of a similar magni-
tude in fertility associated with air pollution exposures.
While traffic and power plant air pollution differ [44],
traffic studies provide information about potential mecha-
nisms of action related to increased fertility. Nieuwenhuii-
sen (2014) found a 13% reduction in census tract fertility
rates with IQR increases in PM2.5–10 from traffic in
Barcelona, Spain during 2011–2012 [15]. A study using
data from 116,430 nurses on self-reported infertility (de-
fined as attempting to become pregnant for one year with-
out success) found an 11% increase in the hazard of
infertility among women living < 200 m (versus ≥200 m)
from a major roadway [11]. Self-reported data indicated
that ovulatory disorder and male infertility may have
driven these associations [11]. In Texas and Michigan,
among 393 couples attempting to conceive, couples were
3% more likely to become pregnant for each additional
200 m they lived away from a major roadway [12]. These
changes in fertility may result from endocrine disruption,
oxidative
stress,
or
DNA
modifications
caused
by
pollutants [10].
A reduction in spontaneous abortion may also help
explain our findings. As many as 10–20% of clinically
recognized pregnancies end in a pregnancy loss [45],
and research has shown that these rates increase follo-
wing period of stress, such as natural disasters [46]. Our
results are consistent with evidence that reports associa-
tions between pollutant exposures and increased fetal
loss. One study found reduced miscarriage and stillbirth
following the temporary closure of a coal plant in
Croatia [14]. Two observational studies (350,000 and
750,000 live births, respectively) in New Jersey and Ohio
found elevated odds of stillbirth (versus live birth) with
increased exposure to ambient SO2, carbon monoxide,
and PM2.5 in the third trimester [47, 48]. In Mongolia,
which experiences high levels of air pollution from coal
combustion in winter months, researchers found a cor-
relation between ambient PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels
and fetal death [49].
In addition to changes in air quality, the closure of oil
and coal power plants may have changed economic con-
ditions for individuals living nearby and thus affected
fertility. For instance, if residential proximity was related
to employment at the power plants, closure may have
resulted in more job loss among individuals living closer
to the power plants (i.e., < 5 km). We do not have data
to assess this pathway, but job loss would have likely re-
duced fertility [50], biasing our results towards the null.
In addition, other aspects of power plants could have af-
fected fertility rates. Some studies suggest a link between
industrial activities and stress, which have been associ-
ated with reduced fertility [16, 18].
We assessed whether compositional changes and
economic improvement around power plants after re-
tirement might have explained our results. First, we
restricted the unexposed period to the single year
after power plant retirement, limiting compositional
changes that may have occurred over longer periods
of time. Second, using ACS data we found minimal
changes in population composition, such as small
changes in neighborhood poverty following plant re-
tirements. We also assessed whether changes in the
housing market due to the foreclosure crisis affected
fertility, unrelated to contemporaneous power plant
retirements.
Models
adjusted
for
the
number
of
annual foreclosures by area bin did not differ from
our original results. This adjustment, however, may
have been insufficient if temporal changes in foreclo-
sures differed by area bin pre- and post-retirement
[51]. Finally, we used communities located 10-20 km
from power plants as controls under the assumption
that they might have had similar composition to
communities
located
closer
but
would
experience
smaller changes in air pollution due to power plant
retirements. The choice of control group may have
produced
conservative
estimates,
since
pollutants
from coal plants can travel over 10 km [1].
Assessment of spatial and temporal exposures has
been noted as a methodological concern in studies of
air pollution and reproductive health [52]. Our design,
utilizing a natural experiment of plant closures, ad-
dresses these issues through specification of exposure
location and timing. As fertility did not cause the
closing of plants, staggered closing dates allowed us
Casey et al. Environmental Health  (2018) 17:44 
Page 7 of 10
 to approximate a randomized design using difference-
in-differences methods.
Our study had several limitations. Because fertility
is governed by both biological and behavioral factors
[28, 53], our outcome variable (i.e., the fertility rate)
lacks specificity to identify pure biological effects. The
estimated benefit of power plant retirement for area-
level fertility rate may not apply to individual couples
attempting to conceive. In addition, the fertility rate
denominator estimate included error. The ACS pro-
vides population estimates at the block group level in
5-year windows, not annually, and block groups did
not perfectly overlap with our selected area bins.
Furthermore, we assumed a constant population dens-
ity of women 15–44 years across block groups, which
also added uncertainty to fertility rate estimates. Se-
veral of the plants had a relatively small number of
births occur within 20 km, which could have resulted
in variable rates and spurious associations. To assess
this issue, we repeated analysis after removing the
two plants with the fewest women of childbearing age
nearby and noted no qualitative change in results. We
also
lacked
air
quality
measurements
at
mothers’
homes or places of work meaning we could not ac-
count for varying levels of background air pollution
or identify a single pollutant as the potential causative
agent. However, CMAQ PM2.5 data did suggest more
reduction in air pollution closer to power plants after
retirement.
Future
analyses
could explore
whether
other sources of air pollution, for example biomass
plants or traffic, contribute to changes in fertility.
Two of the eight power plants eventually transitioned
to burning biomass, which release air pollutants. Such
transitions take time. For example, the Port of Stock-
ton coal plant retired in January of 2011 and did not
reopen to burn biomass until February of 2014 [54].
We treated these transitions, therefore, as retirements
for the purpose of this study where we compared the
year after retirement to the period 1–2 years prior. In
addition, we assigned exposure based on the residen-
tial address on the birth certificate and could not
account for exposure accrued from work, travel, or
residential mobility during pregnancy. We were un-
able to assess the association of plant closures with
neighborhood perceptions and maternal stress. Finally,
an assumption of our difference-in-differences analysis
is that secular trends in fertility in the 10-20 km area
bin mirror that of the < 5 km and 5-10 km area bins,
conditional
on
measured
covariates.
Although
the
demographics of the distance bins may have exhibited
some
differences
over
the
study
period
[51],
unadjusted
and
adjusted
estimates
were
similar,
suggesting that any differences in the measured cova-
riates over time did not confound our results.
Conclusion
Our results indicate potential fertility benefits associated
with coal and oil power plant retirements in California.
These results require confirmation in other populations,
given known methodological limitations of ecologic
study designs. The two coal-fired generators retired in
this study had capacities–54 MW and 24 MW–about 1
order of magnitude lower than the nationwide average
coal plant. Therefore, we might expect stronger associa-
tions in other locations. The U.S. EIA has identified
nearly 7000 MW of coal and oil capacity in 8 states
slated for retirement in 2018 alone. The Clean Power
Plan [55]–the federal government’s strategy to curb car-
bon dioxide emissions from electricity generation–and
similar climate change policies will also likely lead to
more power plant retirements as states strive to meet
emissions standards. Our study design limited the possi-
bility that the estimated increase in fertility rates after
coal and oil power plant retirements resulted from
temporal trends or changes in population composition.
Ecologic designs have known methodological limitations,
however, so our results require confirmation in other
populations. Future plant retirements will afford oppor-
tunities to further assess their potential reproductive
health benefits.
