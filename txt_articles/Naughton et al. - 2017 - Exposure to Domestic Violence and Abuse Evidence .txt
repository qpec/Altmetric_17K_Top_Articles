Abstract 
Recent literature on exposure to domestic violence highlights the need for increased 
understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence and abuse (DVA).  The current aims were to 
explore whether two separate dimensions, physical and psychological DVA, were evident in 
adult children’s reports of their exposure to DVA in their family of origin and whether these 
dimensions impacted psychological wellbeing and perceived satisfaction with emotional support 
(hereafter referred to as social support satisfaction).  Young adults (N = 465, aged 17 to 25, 70% 
female) reported their experiences of DVA as perpetrated by their parents/caregivers, as well as 
psychological wellbeing and social support satisfaction, in an online survey.   Using 
confirmatory factor analysis we verified the presence of a 2-factor model (physical and 
psychological DVA).  Hierarchical linear regression analysis demonstrated the differing impact 
of these two factors: specifically, while exposure to psychological DVA (DA) was related to 
reduced psychological wellbeing, there was no significant effect of exposure to physical DVA 
(DV).  However, mediation analysis suggested the presence of a suppression effect; there was a 
magnification of the negative relationship between exposure to psychological DA and social 
support satisfaction when exposure to physical DV was accounted for.  Although findings are 
preliminary, they provide strong evidence to support theoretical arguments regarding the need 
for future research to conceptualize exposure to DVA in terms of both physical and 
psychological dimensions.  Our findings also highlight that in order to improve service response 
and provide effective interventions, it is essential to include exposure to psychological DA in 
risk assessments of such young adults.

Exposure to Domestic Violence and Abuse: Evidence of Distinct Physical and Psychological 
Dimensions 
 Research over the last two decades has clearly established that child exposure to 
domestic violence and abuse (DVA) can have a negative impact on children’s cognitive, 
emotional, behavioral and social functioning (Holt, Buckley, & Whelan, 2008) which can 
continue into adulthood (Cater, Miller, Howell, & Graham-Bermann, 2015; Naughton, 
O’Donnell, & Muldoon, 2015).    To date, quantitative research has tended to focus on exposure 
to the more clearly definable physical aspect of DVA (Haselschwerdt et al, 2014), however 
recent qualitative research suggests that the children are exposed to a wide range of types of 
DVA (Haselschwerdt, et al., 2016a).  As such, while physical DV is important, the non-physical 
aspect (hereafter referred to as psychological DA) may also be imperative to our understanding 
of child adjustment (Callaghan, Alexander, Sixsmith, & Fellin, 2015; Izaguirre & Calvete, 2015).  
Grych and Hamby (2014) have argued that our understanding of phenomena is limited by how 
we conceptualize it.  This suggests a need to more fully understand the complex phenomenon 
that is child exposure to DVA.  For example, to the best of our knowledge, there is no 
quantitative research within the exposure to DVA literature (hereafter termed ‘exposure 
literature’) examining whether or not exposure to psychological and physical DVA, are in fact 
two distinct dimensions. 
Recent theoretical arguments (for example Haselschwerdt et al., 2014, 2016a) suggest a 
need to further our understanding of the impact of child exposure to various types of DVA on 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

adjustment.  While Haselschwerdt et al. (2016a) suggest that children are indeed exposed to a 
wide variety of forms of DVA; there has been a tendency to conceptualize child exposure as a 
physical violence model (Katz, 2015).  Further, given the overreliance on the physical model for 
assessing the risk of those exposed to DVA (Naughton, O’Donnell, Greenwood, & Muldoon, 
2015) it is essential that we explore if  there is evidence to support that exposure to the physical 
dimension of DVA contributes to reductions in wellbeing over and above those explained by 
exposure to the psychological dimension.  
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative research on child exposure has 
not yet considered the possibility that different dimensions of DVA might also impact social and 
psychological functioning in different ways.  For example, as psychological DA is associated 
with social isolation both for adult victims (Goodman & Smyth, 2011) and the children within 
such families (Levendosky, 2013), it is plausible to suggest that exposure to the psychological 
dimension might have an effect on young adults’ satisfaction with available social support that 
exposure to the physical dimension does not.  The overarching aim of the current study was, 
therefore, to investigate if there were two distinct dimensions of child exposure to DVA as 
experienced by young adults and if such dimensions impacted differently on different 
psychosocial outcomes. 
 In the current study, exposure to DVA refers to young adults’ (aged 17 to 25) perception 
of the occurrence of intra-parental DVA in their homes; specifically where the perpetrator and 
the victim are the person’s parents/caregivers.  While physical DV encapsulates behaviors such 
as hitting, choking, kicking, hair pulling, and threatened or actual use of a deadly weapon (knife, 
gun), psychological DA is conceptualized broadly to include verbal abuse (shouting, screaming, 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
5 
 
 
name-calling,), emotional abuse (humiliation, intimidation), controlling, isolating, damage to 
belongings, and purposeful harming of a pet (Edleson, Shin, & Armendariz, 2008).  In the 
general DVA literature, psychological and physical violence are established as two 
intercorrelated yet distinct pathological phenomena (Kelly, 2004).  However, while there is an 
emerging cognizance of the importance of the power dynamics in which exposure to physical 
DV may occur – specifically whether aversive stimuli are or are not used by one parent to 
control the other, referred to as coercive control (Haselschwerdt, 2014; Jouriles & McDonald, 
2015) – there is scant research which explores whether or not exposure to psychological DA, in 
the absence of physical DV, has consequences for children or indeed for adult children.   
Thus far, there is limited literature on the differing effects of physical and psychological 
DVA.  Tschann et al. (2008) identified that increased emotional distress (depression, anxiety and 
anger) and negative appraisals were both associated with non-violent parental conflict but not 
inter-parental physical violence.  Further Gonzalez, MacMillan, Tanaka, Jack, and Tonmyr 
(2014) investigated the differing outcomes for children under 15 (Mage = 6.05).  Operationalizing 
exposure to subtypes of DVA (direct physical, indirect physical, and emotional) and also child 
functioning (internalizing/externalizing) as dichotomous variables (present/absent) based on 
child welfare workers reports, they found that exposure to both psychological and physical DVA 
resulted in the greatest risk to child wellbeing.  In addition, Litrownik, Newton, Hunter, English, 
and Everson (2003) investigated the impact of exposure to family aggression (inclusive of all 
‘grown-ups in the house’, p. 63) in a longitudinal study on young children.  Using single items to 
record child reports of physical and psychological aggression in the family, they identified that 
where both child and mother reported the occurrence of physical family aggression at baseline 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
6 
 
 
(age 4), depression/anxiety was more likely in the child at follow-up (age 6).  Child reports of 
psychological forms of aggression alongside mothers’ reports of physical aggression within the 
family at age 4, on the other hand, predicted aggressive behaviors at age 6.   
These studies highlight a need to account for exposure to both dimensions of DVA on 
child/young adult adjustments.  This is consistent with a growing recognition within the broader 
DVA literature (Kelly, 2004; Sullivan, 2013), but also emerging within the qualitative exposure 
literature (Callaghan et al., 2015; Katz, 2015), of the detrimental impact of the psychological 
dimension of DVA.   Indeed, the broader DVA literature highlights that psychological DA is the 
most common form of DVA and may occur in the absence of physical DV (Henning & Klesges, 
2003; Sullivan, 2013).  Furthermore, Callaghan et al. (2015) suggest that as father’s controlling 
behavior can extend to the children, they may be directly drawn into the dynamic of 
psychological DA, making it a particular concern.   
Aims of the Current Study 
To date, despite the recent theoretical concerns around psychological DA, the exposure to 
DVA literature has tended to assess DVA as typically reflecting physical DV (Artz, 2014; 
Haselschwerdt et al., 2014).  However, Edleson et al. (2008) constructed the Child Exposure to 
Domestic Violence (CEDV) measure to incorporate exposure to both the physical and 
psychological dimensions of exposure.  Yet both the original CEDV measure and adapted 
versions (eg., Cater et al., 2015), operationalize CEDV as a unidimensional construct.  The 
current study employs the Edleson et al. (2008) measure, adapted to be gender neutral, to assess 
exposure to DVA amongst a sample of young adults.  This scale was chosen as it was developed 
specifically to capture children’s/adult children’s perceptions of their own exposure to DVA as 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
7 
 
 
opposed to parent/caregivers’ or other key informants’ perceptions.  First and foremost, we 
aimed to establish if there is empirical evidence for physical and psychological dimensions of 
DVA.  Our second aim was to investigate the potentially different impacts of these two 
dimensions of DVA on two conceptually distinct outcomes: psychological wellbeing and social 
support satisfaction. 
CEDV has been shown to impact on various facets of psychological wellbeing (Artz et al., 
2014).  However, another centrally important and likely area for DVA to impact is in relation to 
social support satisfaction.  Indeed, in the context of child exposure to violence, social support is 
considered the most frequently studied protective factor (Grych, Hamby, & Banyard, 2015).  
However, within the exposure literature to date, social support has been investigated as a 
moderator (i.e., the impact of social support on the strength of the relationship between exposure 
to DVA and outcomes; e.g., Tajima, Herrenkohl, Moylan, and Derr, 2011) or a mediator (i.e., 
how social support explains the relationship between exposure to DVA and outcomes; e.g., 
Owen, Thompson, Shaffer, Jackson, & Kaslow, 2009).  As such, to date, there is a scarcity of 
literature which investigates social support directly as an outcome; that is, studies that examine 
the direct effect of exposure to DVA on levels of social support.  Further, Ford et al. (2014) 
established in a longitudinal study that adverse childhood experiences (including exposure to 
DVA) predicted reduced levels of social support in adulthood. Additionally, Sperry and Widom 
(2013) suggest a need to orient to how child maltreatment impacts on the level of perceived 
social support.  Thus in the current study, orienting to the theoretical arguments that link trauma 
to social support (Muldoon & Lowe, 2012), we explore the impact of exposure to both physical 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
8 
 
 
and psychological dimensions of DVA on young adults’ reports of their perceived satisfaction 
with their current social support. 
To further our understanding of the impact of CEDV on young adults, we propose the 
following two hypotheses.  1) Two distinct factors are evident in adult children’s reports of their 
exposure to DVA.   2) Exposure to physical DV and exposure to psychological DA are related to 
(a) psychological wellbeing and (b) social support satisfaction. 
 
Methods 
     Participants and Procedure 
Following ethical approval, in 2014, an email was sent to the student population of an 
Irish university, inviting students aged between 17 and 25 to participate in an online study 
entitled ‘Social factors and wellbeing of young adults who may have experienced traumatic life 
events’.  As an acknowledgment of their time, participants were given an opportunity to be 
entered into a prize draw for an Amazon voucher valued at £40.  Participants responded to the 
following measures: CEDV, general health questionnaire, social support satisfaction 
questionnaire, and demographics, in that order.  While a total of 465 students completed the 
CEDV measure (the first measure in the survey), 23.66% failed to complete all measures, 
resulting in a final sample size of 355.  There was no significant group difference (t (463) = -
1.60, p = .11) in the level of reported CEDV between participants who completed all measures (n 
= 355) and those who dropped out (n = 110) (Authors, 2015).  Participants (n=355) had a mean 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

age of 20.07 years (SD = 2.08). 70.6% of them identified as female, ethnicity was not sought as 
the student population is predominantly white Irish.  
Measures 
           Demographics. As a measure of socio-economic status (SES), participants were asked if 
they were in receipt of income-assessed government funding to attend university. As the young 
people may not be familiar with the intimate details of their parents’ income and this funding is 
based on a governmental assessment of such, this was an appropriate operationalization of SES 
for the current study.  53.5% of participants indicated that they were not in receipt of government 
funding, therefore were classified as being from higher SES backgrounds.  Participants were also 
asked to record their age and gender. 
Child Exposure to Domestic Violence (CEDV).  Edleson et al.’s (2008) validated 
measure for CEDV was used to assess (adult) child exposure to DVA.  While the original scale 
contained 3 sections, in the current study nine items from section 1 were used.  These nine items 
were adapted to capture DVA as perpetrated by either or both of the participant’s 
parents/caregivers, rather than assessing father-only perpetration as in the original measure.   
Items are available in Table 1.  This measure has previously been validated with American 
children (10-16 years) and also adapted to measure retrospective CEDV in Swedish young adults 
(Cater et al., 2015).  Haselschwerdt (2014) highlights this measure as having the potential to tap 
into the different types of CEDV; however, to the best of our knowledge, all published studies 
to-date have used the measure as a single dimensional measure with higher total scores 
indicating higher levels of exposure. Participants rated 9 items on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = 
never, 1 = rarely, 2= sometimes, 3 = often and 4 = a lot) indicating the frequency of occurrence 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
10 
 
 
of the behavior. As we know that young adults can continue to be exposed to intra-parental DVA 
(Haselschwerdt, 2016b) we did not limit their exposure to childhood (under 18 years) but rather 
measured lifetime exposure. Briefly, participants indicated whether their exposure had occurred 
within the last six months (on-going) or previously (historical) (see Authors, 2015). 
Psychometric details for CEDV are included in the Results section.  
General health questionnaire (GHQ).   Goldberg’s (1992) 12-item measure, GHQ, has 
been used extensively in population-based studies to assess disruption in normal psychological 
functioning (Goldberg et al., 1997).  Participants rated 12 items on a 4-point Likert scale (from 1 
= not at all to 4 = a lot) to indicate how much each item related to them.  Negative items were 
reverse scored.  The mean was calculated to give a range of 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating 
higher levels of psychological wellbeing.  Reliability was excellent, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 
.91 for the current study. 
Social support questionnaire (SSQ6).  Sarason, Levine, Basham, and Sarason’s (1983) 
6-item SSQ measure was used to assess current satisfaction with perceived emotional support. It 
is of note that the term ‘social support satisfaction’ is used to denote this construct throughout the 
paper.  The measure contains two sections.  In section A, participants were asked to name up to 
four individuals from whom they could count on obtaining emotional support. For example, 
“Please name the people you can really count on help you feel relaxed when you were under 
pressure or tense?” Then in section B, they rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = very 
dissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied) how satisfied they were with this perceived available emotional 
support.  In this study, the Section B – SSQ6 items were used to denote social support 
satisfaction.  The mean was calculated to give a range of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
11 
 
 
higher social support satisfaction.  Reliability was excellent, with a Cronbach’s alpha (internal 
consistency) of .92. 
Analytic Strategy  
          The findings are presented in two distinct parts.  Initially, confirmatory factor analysis 
(CFA) was employed to investigate hypothesis 1.   CFA tests the fit of the current data to a 
hypothesized model.  In accordance with Jöreskog and Sörborn’s (1984) alternative modeling 
strategy”, separate CFAs were undertaken for 3 proposed models for the CEDV variable: Model 
A, a single factor model; Model B, a theoretically driven two-factor model; and Model C, a data-
driven, adjusted two-factor model.  The established statistical evidence for the presence of 2 
distinct dimensions; physical and psychological DVA facilitated the testing of hypothesis 2.  In 
Part 2, hierarchical linear regression was employed to investigate how exposure to both physical 
and psychological DVA impact on both psychological wellbeing and social support satisfaction.  
This also enabled us to comment on the validity of a two-dimensional approach to understanding 
CEDV.  Finally, we used PROCESS model 4 (Hayes, 2013) to further explore the findings from 
the linear regression analysis; that is, the idea that exposure to physical DV exerted a suppression 
effect on the relationship between exposure to psychological DA and social support satisfaction.   
Results 
Part 1. Evidence for a Two Dimension Model of Adult Children’s Exposure to Domestic 
Violence and Abuse 
          In line with our first hypothesis we undertook a confirmatory factor analysis to determine 
if a single- or two-factor model of CEDV best fit the current data.  We initially tested Model A 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
12 
 
 
(single factor, with all nine items) for goodness of fit.  As predicted, this model was a poor fit for 
the current data (relative chi-square (CMID/DF) = 14.10, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.89, 
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .18).  As the one-factor model was a poor 
fit, we proceeded to test the first two-factor model, a theoretically derived model (Model B).  
Here, consistent with theoretical arguments, the 9 items were loaded on two distinct but 
correlated factors, namely psychological and physical CEDV.  Fit estimates for Model B were in 
the expected direction, but did not have an acceptable model fit (CMID/DF =6.62, CFI =0.93, 
RMSEA = .10).   
On further investigation, the modification indexes (M.I.) indicated that Item 3 (prevent 
eat/sleep), which was clustered on the psychological factor, also correlated with the physical 
factor (M.I. = 6.33); this suggests that this item loads similarly on both factors.  Modification 
indexes also indicated that correlations existed between error terms of two items which loaded on 
the psychological factor (Item 1, ‘humiliate’ and Item 9, ‘argue’) M.I. =6.99) and two items 
which loaded on the physical factor (Item 7, ‘threaten weapon’ and Item 8, ‘use weapon’; M.I. = 
9.9).  Since the items tap into similar constructs, we assumed that the correlations reflected non-
random measurement error stemming from content overlap.  Taking account of these findings, 
we then tested the fit of the adjusted two-factor 8 item model (model C), in which the error terms 
were allowed to be correlated and Item 3 was dropped.  This adjusted interrelated two-factor 
model had good fit estimates (CMID/DF = 2.32, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = .05), verifying that two 
factors underlie the higher-order CEDV variable.  Fit estimates are presented in Table 2, while 
Figure 1 illustrates the best fit model (Model C).  As predicted the two factors were inter-
correlated (.81).

Reliability was analyzed through Cronbach’s Alpha.  Both exposure to physical DV (α = 
.76) and psychological DA (α = .85) demonstrated very good reliability.  Items were totaled to 
give final scores between and 0 and 12 for exposure to physical DV and between 0 and 20 for 
exposure to psychological DV, with high scores indicating high levels of exposure. However, as 
low scores (<3) of exposure to psychological DA were regarded as more consistent with 
exposure to low-level conflict and not psychological DA, exposure to psychological DA was 
defined as a score of 3 and greater.  21.6% of participants (n = 92) reported exposure to physical 
DV (defined as a total score of 1 or more) while 55.7% (n = 259) reported exposure to 
psychological DA (defined as a total score of 3 or more).   
Part 2. Exposure to Psychological and Physical Domestic Violence and Psychological 
Wellbeing and Social support satisfaction 
To determine the association between the variables of interest, Pearson correlations were 
performed.  Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations are presented in Table 3.    
In line with hypothesis 2, two separate hierarchical linear regression analyses were 
performed, with criterion variables of psychological wellbeing and social support satisfaction 
respectively.  To control for the possible impact of SES on outcomes, this variable (coded 0 = 
lower SES, 1 = higher SES), was added in step 1.  As the correlations between gender and age 
with predictor and criterion variables were non-significant they were not included in the 
regression model.  As we did not have an a priori hypothesis as to which of the underlying 
factors (psychological or physical) of CEDV would explain unique variance, both factors were 
added in step 2 using forced entry.  Furthermore, as the variance inflation factors (VIF) for all 
variables were less than 2, multicollinearity was not an issue.  Results are presented in Table 4.

Exposure to psychological DA (β = -.33, p <.001) was the sole significant predictor and 
explained 15% of the variance in psychological wellbeing (F (2, 352) = 30.34, p < .001).   
Higher levels of exposure to psychological DA predicted reduced levels of psychological 
wellbeing.   There was no unique predictive effect for exposure to physical DV on psychological 
wellbeing (β = -.07, p > .05).    
SES (β = .15, p =.02) explained a significant 2% of the variance (F (2, 346) = 3.98, p = 
.02) for the criterion variable social support satisfaction.  Higher SES predicted increased levels 
of social support satisfaction.  Exposure to psychological (β = -.46, p <.001) and physical (β = 
.18, p =.008) DVA explained 14% of the variance in social support satisfaction (F (2, 344) = 
27.87, p < .001).  Higher levels of exposure to psychological DA predicted reduced levels of 
social support satisfaction.  However, as the Beta value for exposure to physical DV was

positive, this suggests that when controlling for exposure to psychological DA, increased levels 
of exposure to physical DV predicted an increase in levels of social support satisfaction.

         To further elucidate the findings of the hierarchal linear regression for social support 
satisfaction, a mediation analysis using PROCESS model 4 (Hayes, 2013) was conducted.  This 
was the preferred statistical tool as 78.4% of participants reported no exposure to physical DV, 
thus limiting the utility of the inclusion of an interaction term in multiple linear regression 
models.

       Bootstrapping was applied as this makes no assumptions about the normality of the sampling 
distribution and reduces the likelihood of type 1 error (Preacher & Hayes, 2004).  Bootstrapping 
involved drawing 10,000 random samples from the data pool to estimate each pathway’s effects, 
with computed bias corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) determining the 
significance of each pathway.  Results are presented in Table 5, while the model is presented in 
Figure 2.   
 As SES was shown to contribute to variance in social support satisfaction in the 
hierarchical linear regression analysis, it was added as a covariate to the mediation model.  
Exposure to psychological DA predicted increased exposure to physical DV (B = .22, p < .001), 
which in turn predicted increased social support satisfaction (B = .17, p = .008).  The direct effect 
was negative (B = -.15, p < .001), with exposure to psychological DA predicting reduced levels 
of social support satisfaction.  However, as the indirect effect was positive (B = .04, 95% CI [.01, 
.07]), the statistical adjustment for exposure to physical DV within the model resulted in an 
increase in the predictive power of exposure to psychological DA for social support satisfaction.  
This is referred to as a suppression effect, which is statistically similar though conceptually 
different to a mediation effect.  It occurs when you have incongruent mediation – opposite signs 
for direct and indirect effects (MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000) – as in the current 
findings where there is a negative direct effect and positive indirect effect (see above).   As such, 
within the current dataset, for the young adults who reported high levels of exposure to 
psychological DA, those who also reported higher levels of exposure to physical DV fared better 
in terms of perceived social support satisfaction than those who reported lower levels of physical 
DV.

Discussion         
To date, studies based on the child exposure to domestic violence (CEDV) measure 
(Edleson et al., 2008), including adaptations, have conceptualized CEDV as a unitary construct, 
with higher total scores indicating higher levels of exposure.  However, consistent with our first 
hypothesis, our findings evidence two distinct dimensions of young adults’ reported experience 
of their exposure to DVA.  These two distinct yet related underlying factors can be thought of as 
physical and psychological dimensions of DVA.  We suggest that this is both a novel and 
important finding. The verification of two statistically distinct factors facilitated the analysis of 
the differing impact of being exposed to both the physical and psychological dimensions of DVA  
The two dimensions appear to drive different psychosocial outcomes.  We argue that this more 
complete and nuanced understanding of the nature of CEDV will facilitate our longer term 
understanding of the consequences of exposure to DVA. 
In line with hypothesis 2a, which proposed a differing relationship between the 
underlying factors and psychological wellbeing, the patterns within our data suggests that it was 
exposure to the psychological dimension of DVA which explains the reductions in psychological 
wellbeing for young adults, with no unique variance explained by the physical dimension when 
accounting for the impact of the psychological dimension. 
The establishment of the psychological dimension as the driving factor in reduced 
psychological wellbeing is consistent with the broader DVA literature, which highlights the 
deleterious impact of psychological DA on victims (Kelly, 2004).  The current findings are also 
in line with previous exposure literature. For example, Tschann et al. (2008), using the Revised 
Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996) identified that 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
21 
 
 
parental reports of non-violent parental conflict, but not inter-parental violence, were associated 
with adolescents’ increased emotional distress.’ 
 
A possible explanation for the current findings may be the higher levels of exposure to 
the psychological factor when compared to physical factor.  However, our findings were 
consistent with those found by Cater et al. (2015) who, with a similar aged population, also used 
an adapted form of the CEDV instrument to capture child exposure.  Their young adults also 
reported higher levels of exposure to the individual items that cluster on the current study’s 
psychological factor, when compared to the individual items that cluster on the current study’s 
physical factor of CEDV.    
Consistent with our hypothesis (2b) that there would be a differing relationship between 
the distinct dimensions (physical and psychological) and social support satisfaction. Our findings 
suggest that while exposure to both dimensions contributed to variations in young adults’ levels 
of social support satisfaction, exposure to the psychological dimension predicted reduced levels 
of social support satisfaction whereas exposure to the physical dimension predicted  increased 
levels of social support satisfaction while accounting for the psychological dimension and SES.  
Reinforcing this finding, we established a suppression effect; when we accounted for exposure to 
physical DV, the negative impact of exposure to psychological DV on the levels of social 
support satisfaction was magnified.  Thus, in terms of levels of social support satisfaction, 
exposure to increased levels of physical DV can be said to reduce the negative impact of 
exposure to increased level of psychological DA. 
  While we cannot address the underlying mechanism that may explain these findings 
based on the current data, it is possible that the clearly visible parameters that underlie physical 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
22 
 
 
DV (kicking, punching, use of weapon) render it easier to make sense of and categorize as an 
unacceptable behavior, therefore facilitating disclosure and increased levels of social support 
satisfaction.  However, as psychological DA lacks physical parameters, it may be more difficult 
to comprehend as abusive, and indeed less amenable to understanding from others.  This 
argument is consistent with findings from a linked qualitative study (Authors, under review) 
which identified that the occurrence of extreme physical violence facilitated the young people to  
disclose the occurrence of DVA in their homes and enabled them to seek external help.  
While the current findings establish that exposure to psychological DA explains 14% and 
15% of variations in psychological wellbeing and social support satisfaction respectively, 
previous research has established other constructs that may account for the remainder variance.  
For example, exposure to a wide range of violence including community violence, direct 
childhood abuse, and sibling abuse, also contribute to maladjustments (Margolin, Vickerman, 
Oliver, & Gordis, 2010).  Further, mediators such as young adults’ family identification (i.e., 
their perceived embeddedness within the family group; Naughton, O’ Donnell, & Muldoon 
2015), threat appraisal (Grych, Jouriles, Swank, McDonald, & Norwood, 2000), parental warmth 
(Miller, Cater, Howell, & Graham-Bermann, 2015), and maternal mental health (Miranda, de la 
Osa, Granero, & Ezpeleta, 2013) have all been identified as underlying processes in the link 
between exposure to DVA and adjustments. 
Limitations  
This study’s primary focus was to demonstrate the underlying factors of DVA and the 
consequences of exposure to both physical and psychological DVA, thus it was imperative to 
limit the scope of this study to focus solely on the psychological and physical factors of the 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
23 
 
 
higher order CEDV variable.   The authors do wish to indicate the need to interpret these results 
with some caution.  The current study captured both on-going and past exposure to DVA so may 
be subjected to recall bias (Hardt & Rutter, 2004). The cross-sectional design precludes 
demonstration of causal effects, therefore the current findings should be considered preliminary.  
Diversity and Culture 
Participants in the current study were predominantly white Irish Catholic, so analyses of ethnic 
group differences were not possible.  It is also worth noting that how Irish young people are 
impacted by exposure to both physical and psychological DVA, and how this impacts on their 
perceived satisfaction with social support satisfaction, may be culturally distinct.  As such, 
replications of the study with diverse populations are warranted to determine the generalizability 
of the current study’s findings. Although previous studies have found gender differences in 
outcomes for young adults (Cater et al., 2015), no such patterns were identified within the 
current data set (Authors, 2015).  Further, in the current study SES explained 2% of the variation 
in social support satisfaction, and although statistically significant, 2% may not hold practical 
significance. The current study accessed SES based on the young people’s receipt of government 
assisted funding to attend university.  Future research may benefit from increased attention to the 
young people’s social environment including SES.   
 Research Implications 
Following from the above stated limitations, it is therefore important that future studies 
should investigate the generalizability of the present results by investigating the differing impacts 
of exposure to both physical and psychological DVA for younger children, at-risk groups and 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
24 
 
 
community groups of various culture backgrounds, and in the context of other adverse childhood 
experiences.  Our novel findings do extend previous literature and serve to clarify less conclusive 
results regarding the overall impact of child exposure to DVA (Kitzmann, Gaylord, Holt, & 
Kenny, 2003).   The current findings evidence two distinct dimensions of young adults’ reported 
experience of their exposure to DVA; importantly they highlight how the differing impact of the 
underlying factors can vary between distinct psychosocial outcomes.  The patterns within our 
data therefore clearly suggest a need for future research to account for the effect of exposure to 
both physical and psychological DVA when investigating the impact of this phenomenon.   
However previous quantitative child exposure literature has tended to operationalize child 
exposure as physical DV only and where psychological DA is included as a unidimensional 
construct, as for example in the CEDV instrument (Edleson, et al., 2008).  Our findings however 
are consistent with recent concerns raised by Grych and Hamby (2014).  In their contribution to 
the advancement of the measurement of violence, they highlight methodological issues; for 
example, their concerns on the ability of total scores on self-report violence instruments to fully 
capture the construct under investigation.  Therefore, the current findings augment Grych and 
Hamby’s recommendations that researchers desist from oversimplifying complex phenomena 
such as DVA.  
The verification of the psychological dimension as the driving force in reduced 
psychological wellbeing also has implications for future research.  Follingstad (2011) highlights 
the difficulty that academic researchers have in defining and conceptualizing psychological DA.  
Perhaps because of this, previous research in this area has tended to focus on exposure to 
physical DV (Jouriles & McDonald, 2015).  Sullivan (2013) recommends that the broader DVA 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
25 
 
 
literature places a ‘critical foci’ on psychological DA and the co-occurrence of different types of 
DVA (p.123).  The current findings suggest this is also an important issue when considering 
children’s exposure to DVA.  
 It is however also possible that the current findings do not hold for younger children. Vu, 
Jouriles, McDonald, and Rosenfield (2016), in a review of longitudinal studies, highlighted that 
the impact of child exposure on wellbeing increases with age.  Future research is required to 
investigate the impact of exposure to both physical and psychological DVA across the life span.   
It is also imperative that future longitudinal studies further elucidate the suppression effect of 
exposure to physical DV on the association between exposure to psychological DV and social 
support satisfaction. 
  
There is an onus on social scientific research to provide reliable and valid evidence to 
inform interventions to facilitate the recovery of children and young adults who grow up in 
homes affected by DVA.  Grych and Hamby (2014) suggest that our understanding of a 
phenomenon is limited by how we conceptualize it.  Consistent with theoretical arguments, the 
current findings suggest that it essential that this complex phenomenon is not only 
conceptualized broadly (Haselschwerdt, 2014) but also that it is not reduced to a unitary 
homogenous construct (Grych & Hamby, 2014).    
Clinical and Policy Implications  
There is a need for increased awareness among practitioners and policy makers regarding 
the potential negative consequence of exposure to psychological DV.  For example, much 
research in this area has highlighted the necessity for interventions to encourage the development 
  
  EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
26 
 
 
of both peer relationships (Levendosky, Huth-Bocks, & Semel, 2002) and parent/child 
relationships (Owen et al., 2009) as protective factors for children who are exposed to DVA.  
The current findings suggest that low levels of exposure to physical DV, in conjunction with 
high levels of exposure to psychological DA, may be problematic in terms of young adults’ 
perceived satisfaction with social support satisfaction.  As such, young adults with exposure to 
low levels of physical but high levels of psychological DVA are arguably (at least) equally in 
need of such intervention as those who are exposed to primary physical DV.  It is, therefore, 
essential that this specific population is not excluded by systems which prioritize exposure to 
physical DV in their risk assessments.
