Abstract
Importance—Longitudinal studies of delinquent youth have focused on criminal recidivism, not 
on psychosocial outcomes in adulthood. This omission is critical because most youth return to the 
community where they become the responsibility of pediatric health care providers.
Objective—To investigate 8 positive outcomes among delinquent youth 5 and 12 years after 
detention, focusing on sex and racial/ethnic differences.
Design—The Northwestern Juvenile Project, the first comprehensive longitudinal US study of 
long-term outcomes of delinquent youth after detention (n=1829). Youth were interviewed in 
detention and reinterviewed up to 9 times over 12 years.
Setting—Project staff conducted face-to-face structured interviews at the Cook County Juvenile 
Temporary Detention Center (Chicago, Illinois) between November 20, 1995, and June 14, 1998. 
At follow-ups, participants were interviewed wherever they were living, in the community or in 
correctional facilities.

 Participants—Stratified random sample, 1172 males and 657 females (1005 African Americans, 
524 Hispanics, 296 non-Hispanic whites, and 4 of other race/ethnicity). At baseline, median age 
was 15 years. Twelve years later, at median age 28 years, 1520 (83.1%) of the original sample 
remained.
Main Outcome and Measures—Achievement of positive outcomes in 8 domains: educational 
attainment, residential independence, gainful activity, desistance from criminal activity, mental 
health, abstaining from substance abuse, interpersonal functioning, and parenting responsibility. 
Outcomes were assessed with widely used measures supplemented by correctional records.
Results—Females were significantly more likely than males to achieve most positive outcomes. 
Twelve years after detention, only 21.9% of males and 54.7% of females had achieved more than 
half of the outcomes. As youth aged, the number of positive outcomes increased only modestly. 
Among males, non-Hispanic whites were significantly more likely to achieve most positive 
outcomes compared with minorities, but less likely to abstain from substance abuse. Latent class 
analysis shows that African American males fared the worst, with lives characterized by 
incarceration, criminal activity, and few positive outcomes.
Conclusions and Relevance—Findings highlight racial/ethnic disparities in achieving 
positive outcomes. To improve outcomes, pediatric health care professionals should recognize the 
importance of psychosocial health, facilitate access to services in the community, and partner with 
on-site systems of care.
The United States has the highest incarceration rate of any developed country.1 Each year, 
approximately 1.5 million youth are arrested.2 More than 54,000 juveniles—
disproportionately racial/ethnic minorities—were incarcerated on an average day in 2013.3 
Nearly all of these youth eventually return to their communities.
Delinquent youth are at great risk for poor outcomes in adulthood, having limited social 
support,4 adult guidance,4 educational attainment,5 and cognitive resources.6 The stigma of 
prior criminality limits opportunities for employment.7 Moreover, the experience of 
incarceration may impair psychosocial development.8,9
Despite these adversities, some delinquent youth desist from crime, pursue an education, and 
become employed. However, little is known about positive outcomes among youth after 
detention. The most comprehensive study—conducted in England—has limited 
generalizability to addressing health disparities in the United States.10 Investigations 
conducted in the United States also have limitations. The classic Glueck and Glueck 
study11–13—conducted in the 1940s—examined a variety of outcomes, but did not include 
racial/ethnic minorities (now two-thirds of US juvenile detainees3). More recent studies also 
have unrepresentative samples, examining only serious or adjudicated (convicted) 
offenders,14–16 who represent a fraction of youth in the juvenile justice system. One study 
oversampled youth referred to group homes and sentenced to drug treatment, further 
reducing generalizability.15 Finally, studies have examined outcomes only to the early 
20s14–16 and assessed only recidivism and gainful activity.16,17
These omissions are critical. Hispanics, now the largest minority group in the United 
States,18 are disproportionately confined in a number of states.19 Disproportionate minority

 confinement especially affects African American males, who comprise approximately 17% 
of youth in the United States20 but 40% of youth in correctional facilities.21 Data on females 
are needed because females are a growing proportion of youth in the juvenile justice system, 
comprising 27.9% of youth processed in juvenile court and 13.6% of incarcerated youth.21 
Data on positive outcomes of delinquent youth will inform the development of gender-
specific preventive interventions, and address racial/ethnic health disparities.
This is the first comprehensive US study of long-term outcomes of delinquent youth after 
detention. Using data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, we examined the achievement 
of positive outcomes in 8 domains: educational attainment, residential independence, gainful 
activity, desistance from criminal activity, mental health, abstaining from substance abuse, 
interpersonal functioning, and parenting responsibility. We examine: (1) prevalence of 
specific outcomes 5 and 12 years after detention (at median ages 20 and 28 years, 
respectively), focusing on sex and racial/ethnic differences; (2) overall counts of positive 
outcomes; and, (3) common patterns of outcomes, using a latent class analysis.
METHODS
An overview appears below. Additional information is available in eMethods and is 
published elsewhere.22
Sample, Procedures, and Measures
We recruited a stratified random sample of 1829 youth at intake to the Cook County Juvenile 
Temporary Detention Center (CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, 
and June 14, 1998. The CCJTDC is used for pretrial detention and for offenders sentenced 
for fewer than 30 days. Consistent with data on juvenile detainees nationwide,3,23 nearly 
90% of detainees at CCJTDC were male; most were racial/ethnic minority youth. To ensure 
adequate representation of key subgroups, we stratified our sample by sex, race/ethnicity 
(African American, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or other), age (10–13 years or 14–18 
years), and legal status (processed in juvenile or adult court). Face-to-face structured 
interviews were conducted at the detention center in a private area, most within 2 days of 
intake. The stratified random sample included 1172 males and 657 females (1005 African 
Americans, 524 Hispanics, 296 non-Hispanic whites, and 4 of other race/ethnicity). At 
baseline, youth had a median age of 15 years (mean 14.9; SD 1.4 years).
We conducted follow-up interviews at approximately 3, 5, 6, 8, and 12 years after the 
baseline interview (hereafter referred to as “after detention”) for the entire sample; 
subsamples were interviewed more frequently. Participants were interviewed whether they 
lived in the community or in correctional facilities. We present outcomes at 2 time points, 
which, for simplicity, we refer to as 5 and 12 years after detention. As in our prior work,22 
the 5-year time point consists of 1561 (85.3% of 1829) participants interviewed an average 
of 4.9 years after detention (SD, 0.4; median 4.7 years). The 12-year time point consists of 
1519 (83.1% of 1829) participants interviewed an average of 12.3 years after detention (SD, 
0.3; median 12.2 years). eTable 1 summarizes demographics and retention at 5 and 12 years 
after after detention, when participants were median ages 20 and 28 years, respectively Table

 1 shows definitions and measures for the 8 positive outcomes at the 5- and 12-year follow-
ups.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using STATA statistical software, version 12 (StataCorp) with 
its survey routines. To generate prevalence estimates and inferential statistics that reflect 
CCJTDC’s population, each participant was assigned a sampling weight augmented with a 
nonresponse adjustment to account for missing data. Because minorities are 
disproportionately incarcerated, weighted estimates for males and females overall are similar 
to those for African American males and females.
We present prevalence estimates for participants who were still living at follow-up. (Five and 
12 years after detention, 50 and 97 participants had died, respectively.) Because 
incarceration prevents people from achieving many positive outcomes, we also present 
prevalence only for participants living in the community during the recall period (see 
eMethods). We used logistic regression to examine sex and racial/ethnic differences in 
outcomes, adjusting for age at detention and legal status. We used the Latent Class Analysis 
Stata plugin24 to empirically identify “classes” of participants who exhibited similar patterns 
of positive outcomes 12 years after detention. Three participants who self-identified as 
“other” race/ethnicity were excluded from all analyses. We conducted separate analyses for 
males and females because combining them could obfuscate important differences.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Positive Outcomes in Specific Domains
Figure 1 illustrates sex differences 5 and 12 years after detention. For each positive outcome, 
Figure 1 shows prevalence among males, prevalence among females, and the corresponding 
odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing females with males. Figures 2–3 
show racial/ethnic differences in positive outcomes among males and females, respectively 
(see also eTables 2–4). eFigures 1 and 2 show the prevalence of achieving positive outomes 
at both time points (see also eTable 5).
Sex Differences—Five years after detention, females were more likely than males to have 
positive outcomes in every domain except abstaining from substance abuse; the largest sex 
differences were in desistance from criminal activity, residential independence, and 
parenting responsibility. Twelve years after detention, there were fewer sex differences; 
females, however, were still more likely than males to have most positive outcomes. 
Notably, two-thirds of females had desisted from criminal activity compared with one-
quarter of males; more than three-quarters of females had a positive outcome in parenting 
responsibility compared with less than one-quarter of males. Females were more likely than 
males to have positive outcomes at both time points for educational attainment, desistance 
from criminal activity, interpersonal functioning, residential independence, parenting 
responsibility, and mental health.

 Racial/Ethnic Differences
Males—Non-Hispanic whites were more likely than African Americans and Hispanics to 
have positive outcomes in many domains, especially at the 12-year follow-up (Figure 2). For 
example, 12 years after detention, non-Hispanic whites had more than 5 times the odds of 
gainful activity than African Americans and more than 2 times the odds of Hispanics. 
However, African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be abstaining from 
substance abuse compared with non-Hispanic whites.
Females—There were far fewer racial/ethnic differences among females at either time 
point (Figure 3). Notably, as with males, non-Hispanic whites had greater odds of 
educational attainment than minorities.
Positive Outcomes Among Persons Living in the Community
Because incarceration prevents people from achieving some of the outcomes assessed (Table 
1), we also examined sex and racial/ethnic differences only among participants who lived in 
the community during the entire recall period. Findings were substantially similar 
(eMethods).
Counts of Positive Outcomes
eFigure 3 shows sex differences in the total counts of positive outcomes 5 and 12 years after 
detention. The number of positive outcomes increased only modestly between 5 and 12 
years (eTable 6). Twelve years after detention, 21.9% of males and 54.7% of females had 
achieved more than half of the outcomes (5 or more); only 1 in 10 males and one-third of 
females had achieved 6 or more positive outcomes. At both time points, females had more 
positive outcomes than males: at 5 years, the mean difference was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8); at 
12 years, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7).
eFigures 4 and 5 show racial/ethnic differences in the total counts of positive outcomes for 
males and females, respectively. Among males 12 years after detention, nearly 1 in 2 non-
Hispanic whites had achieved more than half of the outcomes, compared with only 1 in 4 
Hispanics and only 1 in 5 African Americans. Non-Hispanic white males had more positive 
outcomes than minority males: at 5 years, the mean difference was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.7–1.4) 
versus African Americans and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5–1.3) versus Hispanics. At 12 years, the 
differences were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9–1.6) and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5–1.3), respectively. Among 
females, there were no significant racial/ethnic differences.
Patterns of Positive Outcomes
We used latent class analyses to empirically identify “classes” of participants who exhibited 
similar patterns of positive outcomes 12 years after detention. Table 2 shows the percentage 
of participants in each class for males and females, the probability of attaining a particular 
positive outcome in each class, and the racial/ethnic distribution and incarceration 
characteristics of each class. Among males, we found 5 classes: (1) poor overall functioning 
(24.4%): unlikely to have positive outcomes in any domain; (2) incarcerated (28.1%): 
positive outcome in only 1 domain, abstaining from substance abuse; (3) living 
independently but struggling (20.7%): positive outcomes in only 1 domain, residential

 independence; (4) family men but struggling (5.9%): high probability of achieving 
interpersonal functioning, parenting responsibility, and abstaining from substance abuse; and 
(5) functioning independently (21.0%): likely to attain positive outcomes in nearly all 
domains. Among males who had been incarcerated in the past year, 81.0% were in the 
poorest functioning classes (Classes 1–3) (Table 2). Minorities—especially African 
Americans—were overrepresented in the classes with the fewest positive outcomes (Classes 
1–3) (eTable 7).
Among females, we found 4 classes: (1) unstable moms (14.4%): positive outcomes in only 
1 domain: parenting responsibility; (2) substance free but struggling (10.1%): positive 
outcomes in only 1 domain: abstaining from substance abuse; (3) at-home moms (59.9%): 
especially likely to be positive in parenting responsibility, desistance from criminal activity, 
and residential independence, but unlikely to have gainful activity or interpersonal 
functioning; and (4) positive overall functioning (15.6%): likely to have positive outcomes in 
every domain except interpersonal functioning. Among females who had been incarcerated 
in the past year, 72.4% were in the poorest functioning classes (Classes 1 and 2) (Table 2). 
There were no racial/ethnic differences (see eTable 7).
DISCUSSION
Twelve years after detention, only 1 in 5 males and nearly 1 in 2 females had attained 
positive outcomes in more than half of the domains assessed, which included gainful 
activity, educational attainment, interpersonal functioning, and parenting responsibility. 
Moreover, the numbers of positive outcomes increased only slightly between late 
adolescence and young adulthood. The socioeconomic picture was bleak. Only half of our 
participants had a high school degree or its equivalent, rates substantially lower than among 
comparably aged persons nationwide (88.4%).25,26 Only one-fifth of males and 
approximately one-third of females in our sample were working full time or in school. In 
contrast, 77% of the general population is socioeconomically self-sufficient by 29 to 30 
years of age27; in one study, 67% of males and 52% of females, aged 22 to 32 years, were 
employed full-time in 2011–2013.28
This study is the first to document the dearth of long-term positive outcomes in multiple 
domains among delinquent youth after detention. Outcomes are even worse than those found 
by Ramchand and colleagues,15 who found that 7 years later (ages 20–24 years), 58% of 
serious offenders sampled from group homes had completed high school or its equivalent, 
and 32% were employed full time.
Why do females function substantially better than males in nearly every domain? First, 
delinquency among females is largely confined to adolescence.29 Even in the general 
population, males are more likely than females to have static and enduring risk factors for 
delinquent behavior, such as nervous system dysfunctions, difficult temperaments, delayed 
achievement of verbal and motor milestones, and hyperactivity.29,30 Males’ more extensive 
involvement with correctional systems during the transition to adulthood limits opportunities 
to achieve adult roles, such as employment.

 Second, delinquent females are more likely than males to be involved in prosocial activities 
and relationships.31 Prosocial involvement, including parenting, is critical to positive 
functioning. In our study, females were over 18 times more likely to be parenting their 
children than males.
The latent class analysis demonstrated that African American males fared the worse, with 
lives characterized by incarceration, criminal activity, and few positive outcomes. Hispanic 
males functioned more poorly overall than non-Hispanic white males. Racial/ethnic 
disparities among delinquent youth appear to be even greater than disparities in the general 
population.32 The cycle of disadvantage may be most profound for racial/ethnic 
minorities,33 who have fewer resources and opportunities to fulfill adult responsibilities.
Limitations
Our data are subject to the limitations of self-report. Generalizability may be limited to 
youth in urban detention centers with similar sociodemographic characteristics. We did not 
control for social class because nearly all youth who enter detention are poor. Participants 
lost to follow-up may have biased the sample. Of course, we could not examine the 
outcomes of deceased participants; however, including them in computations (defined as 
negative on all outcomes) did not alter findings substantially (see eMethods). Outcome data 
are a snapshot of functioning at 2 time points. Although counts of positive outcomes provide 
a useful summary of overall functioning, their utility is limited because it gives equal weight 
to each outcome. We likely overestimated residential independence at 12 years because we 
were unable to determine the number of “householders” in our sample as defined by the US 
Census Bureau (whether participants’ residences were legally in their name).34 To define 
gainful activity, we followed the decision rules set forth by the US Department of Labor that 
defines full-time homemakers as unemployed. Although homemakers would not score a 
positive outcome in this category, they could score as positive in “parenting responsibility.” 
Note that although this decision could make females appear to have worse outcomes, they 
actually had better outcomes than males. Finally, detention is the outcome of multiple risk 
factors and developmental processes. We cannot determine that detention caused poor 
outcomes independently of those risk factors.
Implications
1. Expand the scope of services for delinquent youth, focusing on minority 
males—Our findings demonstrate that programs must be improved for males, who, based 
on US Department of Justice statistics, comprise 72% of cases handled by juvenile courts35 
and 86% of youth in residential placement.3 Although re-entry programs that focus on 
reducing criminal recidivism are critical for public safety, other needs of delinquent youth 
must be addressed. To improve outcomes, pediatric health care professionals should 
recognize the importance of psychosocial health, facilitate access to services in the 
community, and partner with on-site systems of care.36 Programs are most effective when 
they implement services flexibly, based on individual need and developmental stage.4
Providing services for delinquent males is challenging. Compared with females, males may 
be less amenable to intervention for delinquent behavior; they generally have lower levels of

 interpersonal agreeableness,30 greater susceptibility to deviant peer influence,37 and, in 
many cases, longer histories of oppositional behavior and aggression.38 Moreover, 
adolescent males are less likely than females to seek mental health services,39 and their 
mental health needs are less likely to be detected in correctional settings.40 Racial/ethnic 
minorities are even less likely to receive services than non-Hispanic whites.41
Despite these challenges, expanding services may improve the outcomes of many racial/
ethnic minority males who have been incarcerated. The potential impact cannot be 
overstated. The US Department of Justice estimates that among infants born in 2001, 1 in 3 
African American males and 1 in 6 Hispanic males will be incarcerated in a state or federal 
prison at some point during their lifetime.42
2. Support policies that reduce the collateral consequences of criminal 
records—Delinquent youth have many risk factors that reduce the likelihood of positive 
outcomes.4–6 However, involvement with the justice system presents additional obstacles to 
positive outcomes as youth—especially minorities—age. First, delinquent youth may find it 
difficult to return to school after release. Many have cognitive deficits6 and low expectations 
of success.43 Delinquent youth—particularly minorities—experience harsher disciplinary 
actions than nondelinquent peers.44,45 Punitive discipline may have the unintended 
consequence of increasing delinquency and fostering the “school-to-prison pipeline.”46 
Second, use of criminal records to make employment decisions impedes hiring of ex-
offenders. Finally, in many states, convicted felons may be banned from voting, public 
housing, college/university admissions, child custody, and public aid.47,48 Convicted felons 
may also be barred from certain occupations, including working in health care facilities, 
insurance agencies, hair-dressing, and cosmetology.49 These consequences increase the 
likelihood of recidivism.50
Conclusions
Positive adult outcomes are the exception and not the rule, particularly for racial/ethnic 
minorities. To succeed, delinquent youth must be helped not only to desist from crime but 
also to overcome barriers to social stability and employment.

bThe 5-class model for males minimized adjusted BIC (4-class = 551.2; 5-class = 527.3; 6-class = 528.7), had reasonable entropy (4-class = 0.68; 5-class = 0.72; 6-class = 0.74), and provided the most interpretable groups. Although a 3-class model for females minimized the 
adjusted BIC (3-class = 319.0; 4-class = 325.2; 5-class = 342.2), the 4-class model had substantially better entropy (3-class = 0.51; 4-class = 0.66; 5-class = 0.61) and yielded more meaningful groups.
cPrevalence across latent classes sum over each characteristic. For example, 26.2% of African American males are in Poor Overall Functioning, 29.4% are in Incarcerated, 19.4% are in Living Independently but Struggling, 5.9% are in Family Men, but Struggling, and 19.1% are 
in Functioning Independently.
