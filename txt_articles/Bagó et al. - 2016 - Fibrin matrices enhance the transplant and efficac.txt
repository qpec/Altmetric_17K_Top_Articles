Abstract
Tumor-homing cytotoxic stem cell (SC) therapy is a promising new approach for treating the 
incurable brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM). However, problems of retaining cytotoxic SCs within 
the post-surgical GBM resection cavity are likely to significantly limit the clinical utility of this 
strategy. Here, we describe a new fibrin-based transplant approach capable of increasing cytotoxic 
SC retention and persistence within the resection cavity, yet remaining permissive to tumoritropic 
migration. This fibrin-based transplant can effectively treat both solid and post-surgical human 
GBM in mice. Using our murine model of image-guided model of GBM resection, we discovered 
that suspending human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCS) in a fibrin matrix increased initial 
retention in the surgical resection cavity 2-fold and prolonged persistence in the cavity 3-fold 
compared to conventional delivery strategies. Time-lapse motion analysis revealed that cytotoxic 
hMSCs in the fibrin matrix remain tumoritropic, rapidly migrating from the fibrin matrix to co-
localize with cultured human GBM cells. We encapsulated hMSCs releasing the cytotoxic agent 
TRAIL (hMSC-sTR) in fibrin, and found hMSC-sTR/fibrin therapy reduced the viability of 
multiple 3-D human GBM spheroids and regressed established human GBM xenografts 3-fold in 
11 days. Mimicking clinical therapy of surgically resected GBM, intra-cavity seeding of 
therapeutic hMSC-sTR encapsulated in fibrin reduced post-surgical GBM volumes 6-fold, 
increased time to recurrence 4-fold, and prolonged median survival from 15 to 36 days compared 
to control-treated animals. Fibrin-based SC therapy could represent a clinically compatible, viable 
treatment to suppress recurrence of post-surgical GBM and other lethal cancer types.

 1. Introduction
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor, and one of the deadliest 
forms of cancer1–3. Invasive GBM cells escape into the non-diseased brain, making 
complete surgical resection impossible. Small molecule chemotherapies are unable to reach 
invasive GBM foci. As a result, GBM is incurable and median survival remains only 12–15 
months4. Engineered stem cell (SC) therapies are a promising treatment strategy for 
GBM5,6. SCs have the unique ability to seek out GBM, migrating to solid and diffuse GBM 
deposits. A variety of preclinical studies have shown that SCs genetically engineered with 
cytotoxic agents eradicate solid GBM and markedly extend survival5,7–12. As a result, SC-
therapy for GBM entered human patient testing where tumoricidal SCs are delivered into the 
walls of the surgical cavity following resection of recurrent GBMs8.
Despite the central role of surgical tumor resection in clinical GBM therapy and SC 
treatment, solid GBM models have been the mainstay of preclinical SC therapy testing5. We 
used a mouse model of GBM resection to discover that SCs directly injected in suspensions 
are rapidly lost from the post-surgical cavity and cytotoxic SC therapy fails to suppress the 
recurrence of post-surgical minimal GBM13,14. We found that transplanting cytotoxic SCs in 
hydrogel scaffolds could restore intra-cavity SC retention (i.e.: increase the number of cells 
present 3 hrs post-implant) and tumor killing. Thus, there is significant interest in new 
matrix material that is clinically compatible and highly effective at transplanting cytotoxic 
SCs to eradicate residual GBM foci and delay tumor recurrence. Despite this urgent need, 
different matrix material for cytotoxic SC therapy is virtually unexplored.
Fibrin scaffolds, prepared by the combination of fibrinogen and thrombin proteins, were 
among the earliest biomaterials used to prevent bleeding and create cellular scaffolds. Fibrin 
is a natural biopolymer that forms a scaffold to promote cell attachment during wound 
healing15. Unlike slowly forming extracellular matrices, fibrin scaffolds rapidly assemble 
into three-dimensional branching fibers following the cleavage of fibrinogen polypeptides 
by activated thrombin. The biological and mechanical properties of fibrin gels have led to 
their extensive use in clinical patient surgery and for a variety of bioengineering 
applications16. TISSEEL (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL.) is a clinically approved 
fibrin sealant that is widely used to control bleeding and stop cerebral spinal fluid leaks 
during surgical GBM resection in human patients17. Clinical studies have shown that 
TISSEEL fibrin glue is biocompatible and biostable in the brain of human patients18. 
Importantly, these properties have led to the use of fibrin scaffolds for tissue engineering of 
adipose, skin, liver, and bone tissues19, delivery of therapeutic molecule for various 
diseases19,20, and brachytherapy treatment of brain tumors21–23.
We undertook the first studies exploring a fibrin scaffold-based approach to cytotoxic SC 
therapy for cancer using the FDA approved fibrin sealant TISSEEL. Here, we show that 
packing cytotoxic SCs in fibrin matrices increased both the retention and persistence of 
cytotoxic SCs in the post-surgical GBM resection cavity. Yet, the fibrin scaffolds remained 
permissive to SC tumoritropic migration, allowing cells to rapidly exit the matrix and co-
localize with GBM cells. Using different models of GBM, we found that pre-formed fibrin/
cytotoxic SC patches were effective against solid GBM, while intracavity fibrin/cytotoxic

 SC therapy showed significant anti-tumor effects against surgically resected orthotopic 
GBM xenografts. These results begin to define a new approach to cancer therapy, delivering 
cytotoxic SC therapies from fibrin matrices to treat both solid and surgically resected GBM.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cell lines
U87, LN229, and U251 human GBM cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, 
VA, USA) and human hMSC (Texas A&M Institute for Regenerative Medicine, TX, USA) 
were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum, 100 μg/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Characterization of hMSC was 
performed by Texas A&M Institute for Regenerative Medicine and confirmed 
differentiation capacity to bone and fat as well as expression of hMSC markers was 
confirmed by flow cytometry.
2.2. Lentiviral vectors
The following lentiviral vectors were used in this study: green fluorescence protein fused to 
firefly luciferase (LV-GFP-FLuc), green fluorescence protein fused to Renilla luciferase 
(LV-GFP-RLuc), mCherry protein fused to firefly luciferase (LV-mC-FLuc), a secreted 
variant of TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, LV-sTR), and Gaussia 
luciferase fused to TRAIL (LV-diTR). GFP-RLuc and GFP-FLuc were constructed by 
amplifying the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase or firefly luciferase using the vectors 
luciferase-pcDNA3 and pAC-hRLuc (Addgene) respectively. The restriction sites were 
incorporated in the primers, and the resulting fragment was digested with BglII and SalI, and 
ligated in frame in BglII/SalI digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). 
The GFP-FLuc or GFP-RLuc fragments were digested with AgeI (blunted) and SalI, and 
ligated into pTK402 (provided by Dr. Tal Kafri, UNC Gene Therapy Center) digested with 
BamHI (blunted) and XhoI to create LV-GFP-FLuc or LV-GFP-RLuc. Similarly, mCFLuc 
was created by amplifying the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase from luciferase-pcDNA3, 
ligating into BglII/SalI digested mCherry-C1 (Clontech), and ligating the mC-FLuc 
fragment into pTK402 LV backbone using blunt/XhoI sites. To create LV-sTR and LV-
diTR, the cDNA sequence encoding sTR or diTR was PCR amplified using custom-
synthesized oligonucleotide templates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The restriction sites 
were incorporated into the primers, the resulting fragment was digested with BamH1 and 
XhoI, and ligated in-frame into BamH1/XhoI digested pLVX plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. 
Scott Magness, UNC Department of Medicine, USA). Both LV-sTR and LV-diTR have 
IRES-GFP (internal ribosomal entry sites-green fluorescent protein) elements in the 
backbone as well as CMV-driven puromycin element. All LV constructs were packaged as 
LV vectors in 293T/17 cells using a helper virus-free packaging system as described 
previously12,24. GBM and hMSC were transduced with LVs at varying multiplicity of 
infection (MOI) by incubating virions in a culture medium containing 5 μg/ml protamine 
sulfate (Sigma) and cells were visualized for fluorescent protein expression by fluorescence 
microscopy. TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) was 
purchased from the University of North Carolina Hospitals and Clinics.

 2.3. Seeding in fibrin
Fibrin patches were created under sterile conditions using Sealer and Thrombin preparations 
from TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant (purchased from the University of North Carolina Hospitals 
and Clinics). To prepare the fibrin scaffolds, eight microliters of Sealer solution (67 – 106 
mg/mL fibrinogen) were mixed with 100,000–500000 hMSCs. Eight microliters of the 
Thrombin (400 – 625 units/mL thrombin) preparation was added to initiate gelation and 
physically mixed using a micropipette tip for 30 seconds to create droplets. Fibrin patches 
were created by flattening the droplets through physical pressure to a thickness of 
approximately 1 mm. Fibrin patches loaded with cells were then cultured under standard 
conditions with supplemented DMEM (10% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% L-glutamine).
2.4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM images were captured using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM 
JEOL 6400 F) at 15 kV and 200 kV accelerating voltage, respectively. Cell seeded samples 
were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 30 min and dehydrated using a graded 
concentration (50–100% v/v) of ethanol. Drying of fibrin scaffolds was accomplished by 
immersion in hexamethyldisilazane for 15 min followed by air-drying overnight under a 
fume hood. Dried samples were then sputter coated with gold to observe the morphology of 
fibers and the attached hMSCs using FESEM.
2.5. Cell viability and TRAIL secretion in vitro
To define the viability of hMSCs in scaffolds, hMSC-GFPFLuc (1×105 cells/scaffold) were 
encapsulated in fibrin droplets as described or seeded directly into wells without 
encapsulation. On days 0, 2, 5 and 9 after seeding, high-resolution fluorescent images were 
captured using an Olympus MVX-10 microscope and bioluminescent images were captured 
by incubating cells in D-luciferin (1.5 μg/ml) and measuring luciferase activity using an 
IVIS® Kinetic imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell growth was 
determined by quantification of the fluorescent signal intensity using NIH Image or from 
luciferase activity using the IVIS® Kinetic image analysis software and expressed as 
p/sec/cm2/sr. Arbitrary color bars represent standard light intensity levels (blue= lowest; red 
= highest). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
To determine TRAIL secretion, hMSC-diTR (1×105 cells/scaffold) were seeded as describe 
above. On days 0, 2, 5 and 9 after seeding, equal volumes of cell culture medium containing 
the secreted diTR fusion proteins was collected, incubated with coelenterazine (1 μg/ml), 
and photon emission was determine using an IVIS® Kinetic imaging system (Perkin Elmer, 
Waltham, MA)
2.6. Time-lapse imaging and motion analysis
A 0.6% agarose mold was prepared to mimic brain tissue as described previously25. 3 ml of 
the agarose solution was added to each well of 6-well culture plates and allowed to solidify. 
A 2ml aspirating pipette attached to a vacuum was used to create cavities in the agarose 
~500μm apart. hMSC-GFPRLuc embedded in fibrin were placed in one of the agarose 
cavities. Human U87-mCFLuc cells were seeded in the adjacent hole or the cavity was left 
empty and the wells were filled with media. The cell/agarose system was placed in a

 VivaView live cell imaging system (Olympus) and allowed to equilibrate. Fluorescent 
images were captured at 10x magnification every 20 minutes for 64 hours in 6 locations per 
well (to monitor sufficient cell numbers). Experiments were conducted in triplicate. NIH 
Image was then used to generate movies and to define the migratory path of hMSCs, as well 
as the directionality, displacement and velocity of hMSC migration using the “Manual 
Tracking” and “Chemotaxis Tool” plugins.
2.7. Co-culture viability assays
hMSC-sTR or hMSC-GFRLuc (3 × 105) were seeded in fibrin scaffolds as described above. 
Human U87, Ln229, and U251 GBM cells expressing mCherry-FLuc (2 × 105 cells) were 
plated around the hMSCs seeded in fibrin. 3-D co-culture assays were preformed to mimic 
in vivo characteristics by forming 3-D cell spheroids using the bio-assembler kit (Nano3D 
Biosciences, Houston, TX, USA) according to manufactures specifications. Briefly, GBM 
cells in a 6 well plate with an 80% of confluence, were treated overnight with 72 μl of 
nanoshuttle magnetic particles. The next day, cells were detached with trypsin and plated in 
an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate. A magnetic driver of 6 neodymium magnets (field 
strength = 50 G) designed for 6-well plates were placed atop the well plate to levitate the 
cells to the air–liquid interface and cultured for an additional 18–24 hrs to form spheroids. 
Finally, the spheroids were plated adjacent to hMSC/fibrin and viability was measured by 
luciferase assay 48 hrs later as described previously12. To determine the impact of reduced 
hMSC cell number on GBM killing, decreasing numbers of hMSC-sTR or control hMSCs 
were encapsulated in fibrin (1×102–1×104 cells/scaffold) and seeded with U87 human GBM 
spheroids (5×103 cells). Tumor cell viability was determined 24 hrs later by luciferase assay. 
To determine the efficacy of hMSCs engineered with different cytotoxic therapies, hMSCs 
expressing thymidine kinase (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA) were seeded with 
U87 or U251 tumor spheroids as before. Therapy was initiated by the addition of ganciclovir 
(GCV; UNC Hospitals) to the culture media (10 μg/ml). GBM cell viability was assessed 72 
hrs later using a luciferase-based assay.
2.8. In vivo models
Stem cell persistence—To investigate the transplant of fibrin-encapsulated stem cells in 
the post-surgical GBM cavity, U87-mCFLuc were harvested at 80% confluency. Nude mice 
(6–8 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA) were 
implanted stereotactically with the U87-mCFLuc (5×105 cells) in the right frontal lobe 2 
mm lateral to the bregma and 0.5 mm from the dura (n=12). For tumor resection, mice were 
immobilized on a stereotactic frame and placed under an Olympus MVX-10 microscope 
connected to a Hamamatsu ORCA 03G CCD camera. A midline incision was made in the 
skin above the skull exposing the cranium of the mouse. The intracranial xenograft was 
identified using mCherry fluorescence. A small portion of the skull covering the tumor was 
surgically removed using a bone drill and forceps and the overlying dura was gently peeled 
back from the cortical surface to expose the tumor. The U87-mCFLuc tumor was surgically 
excised using a combination of surgical dissection and aspiration under mCherry excitation. 
Fluorescent images of mCherry+ GBM were continuously captured to assess accuracy of 
image-guided surgical resection. Following tumor removal, hMSC-GFPFLuc (1×106 cells) 
were divided into two groups (n=6/group) and: 1) suspended in 10 μls of saline and directly

 injected into the walls of the cavity, or 2) seeded into the resection cavity in fibrin matrices. 
The skin was closed with surgical glue. hMSC levels were determined by serial 
bioluminescence imaging. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (4.5 mg/ml 
in 150 μls saline) and photon counts were measured 5 minutes after injection over 7 mins 
using the IVIS® Kinetic imager.
To determine the initial retention of hMSCs within the surgical cavity, hMSCs hMSC-
GFPFLuc (1×106 cells) were directly injected into the walls of the surgical cavity or 
encapsulated in fibrin matrices and seeded into the interior of the surgical cavity. 
Bioluminescence imaging was performed 3 hours post-implantation to determine the levels 
of hMSCs retained within hours of injection, and photon emission was expressed relative to 
fibrin implant.
To determine the persistence of hMSC transplanted hMSCs, hMSC-GFPFLuc (1×106 cells) 
were directly injected into the walls of the surgical cavity or encapsulated in fibrin matrices 
and seeded into the interior of the surgical cavity. Serial bioluminescence imaging was 
performed 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days post-implantation.
Photon emission was determined using the IVIS® Kinetic imaging analysis software and 
expressed expressed as p/sec/cm2/sr relative to day 0. All experimental protocols were 
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at The University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill and care of the mice was in accordance with the standards set forth by the 
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, USDA 
regulations, and the American Veterinary Medical Association.
Solid tumor therapy—Nude mice were anesthetized and U87 GBM cells (3×105 cells) 
were injected into the para-spinal space of the mouse in 100 μl of PBS (2 independent 
injection sites per animal, (n=8). One week later, fibrin scaffolds bearing hMSC-sTR (n=4) 
or control hMSC-GFPRLuc (n=4) were surgically implanted over the established tumors. 
Tumor growth was determined by serial FLuc imaging and image analysis as described 
above, expressed as p/sec/cm2/sr relative to day 0.
Post-surgical minimal GBM therapy—To investigate the efficacy of hMSC-sTR 
encapsulated in fibrin for treatment of post-operative GBM, U87-mCFLuc (5×105 cells) 
were implanted into the frontal lobe of mice as described above. Established GBMs were 
surgically resected under image-guidance and hMSC-sTR or hMSC-GFPRLuc in fibrin 
were seeded into the resection cavity (n=6/group). Tumor regrowth was monitored by serial 
Fluc imaging as described earlier.
2.9. Tissue processing
Immediately after the last imaging session, mice were sacrificed, perfused with formalin, 
and brains extracted. The tissue was immediately immersed in formalin. 30 μm coronal 
sections were generated using a vibrating microtome (Fisher). Sections were washed three 
times with PBS and visualized using a confocal microscope (Olympus). In a subset of mice, 
brains were isolated and incubated with or without D-luciferin, and ex vivo whole-brain 
bioluminescent and fluorescent imaging was performed using the IVIS® Kinetic system.

 2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by Student t test when comparing 2 groups and by ANOVA, followed 
by Dunnetts post-test when comparing greater than 2 groups. Data were expressed as mean
±SEM and differences were considered significant at P<0.05. Survival times of mice groups 
(n=5/group) were compared using logrank test.
3. Results
3.1 Generation and characterization of fibrin scaffolds bearing engineered stem cells
3.1.1 Characterizing cytotoxic hMSCs encapsulated in fibrin scaffolds—To first 
characterize cytotoxic SCs encapsulated in fibrin scaffolds, human mesenchymal stem cells 
(hMSCs) engineered to express GFP and firefly luciferase (hMSC-GFPFLuc) were 
suspended in the fibrin component of the medical-grade fibrin sealant TISEEL (approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration, STN 103980). The matrix was rapidly polymerized 
by addition of thrombin, encapsulating the hMSCs within the scaffold (Fig. 1A). Scanning 
electron microscopy showed the hMSC/fibrin matrix displayed a cross-sectional thickness of 
175 μm with cells clearly attached to the fibrin (Fig. 1B). We next investigated the impact 
fibrin encapsulation on the growth of engineered SCs. Fluorescent and bioluminescent 
imaging (BLI) showed hMSC-GFPFluc proliferated in the fibrin scaffolds 9-fold over 9 
days, and there was no statistically significant difference in growth rate between 
encapsulated cells and cells grown in standard well plates (Fig. 1C–D). 2x magnification 
fluorescent images show the growth (increase in GFP signal) at a low magnification, while 
the 10x images show the increase in MSC number within the fibrin at a higher resolution. To 
validate the fluorescence images, bioluminescence imaging of the same cell populations are 
shown in the bottom panels. Summary graphs of these data are shown in Figure 1D and 
expressed relative to no scaffold controls.
An effective SC therapy must release cytotoxic agents to kill cancer cells. Scaffold 
architecture could dramatically alter the level of drug escaping the matrix. To investigate the 
impact of fibrin matrices with different architectures on SC secretion, we engineered hMSCs 
with a diagnostic fusion between TRAIL and Gaussia luciferase (hMSC-diTR) that we have 
previously utilized to detect differences in drug release between stem cell types12. Equal 
numbers of the hMSC-diTR were cultured: 1) without scaffolds, 2) encapsulated within a 
fibrin scaffold with a droplet morphology (droplet), 3) encapsulated within a fibrin scaffold 
that was mechanically flattened after being loaded with cells (patch: encapsulated), or 4) 
seeded on the surface of a pre-fabricated flat scaffold (patch: surface) (Fig. 1E). BLI of 
media samples collected 1, 3, and 6 days post-seeding showed diTR secretion was nearly 
equal in all groups, suggesting the shape of the scaffold, as well as encapsulation versus 
surface seeding had minimal impact on hMSC-diTR drug release. Based on ability of 
cytotoxic SCs to efficiently grow and release cytotoxic agents from fibrin scaffolds, we 
investigated a new strategy where fibrin is used to increase the efficacy of cytotoxic SC 
therapy for cancer. The fibrin matrix is designed to retain the cells within the post-surgical 
cavity yet permit tumor-homing migration and robust drug release to eradicate residual post-
surgical cancer foci.

 3.1.2 Fibrin encapsulation increases retention and persistence of hMSCs 
transplanted into the GBM cavity—Effective SC therapies must persist in the post-
operative GBM resection cavity long enough and in sufficient numbers to eradicate residual 
GBM foci. We used our mouse models of GBM resection to investigate the retention and 
persistence of engineered hMSCs transplanted into the GBM cavity with fibrin 
encapsulation or using standard direct injection (Fig. 2A). Established intracranial human 
GBM xenografts were surgically debulked using image-guided micro-surgery. hMSC-
mCFLuc were embedded in fibrin patches and seeded into the cavity. Alternatively, equal 
numbers of hMSC-mCFLuc were directly injected into the walls of the surgical cavity in a 
subset of animals to mimic the scaffold-free transplant that is currently used in clinical GBM 
patient trials. Quantitative BLI 3 hrs post-implantation showed fibrin encapsulation 
increased the post-operative retention of hMSCs within the resection cavity by 54% 
compared to standard direct injection (Fig. 2B). Fibrin encapsulation also markedly 
increased the persistence of the hMSCs within the post-operative cavity from 10 days to 
more than 28 days (Fig. 2C–D). The fibrin matrix initially allowed the hMSC-mCFLuc to 
proliferate in the post-operative cavity, as the BLI signal increased 2.7-fold in 7 days post-
transplant before gradually declining. In contrast, hMSC-mCFLuc directly injected into the 
post-operative cavity were rapidly cleared from the cavity with only 19% of cells remaining 
at 7 days post-transplant and complete clearance by day 10 (Fig. 2C–D). Ex vivo whole-
brain fluorescent and BLI performed 21 days post-transplant confirmed the in vivo BLI. 
Significant photon emission was detected in the resection cavity of the fibrin-encapsulated 
hMSC-mCFLuc group, while no BLI signal was detected in brains where hMSC-mCFLuc 
were directly injected (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, whole-brain cross-sectional analysis showed 
the hMSC-mCFLuc signal extended beyond the boarder of the resection cavity, suggesting 
hMSCs migrated from the cavity into the parenchyma. This was confirmed by high-
resolution fluorescent imaging of tissue sections, where numerous mCherry+ hMSCs were 
found to line the tissue adjacent to the resection cavity in fibrin-encapsulated brains (Fig. 
2F). Directly injected hMSCs were detected in tissue sections, but the few cells were 
confined to a small single site (Fig. 2G). Together, these data provide the first demonstration 
that fibrin encapsulation improves the retention and survival of engineered stem cells into 
the GBM resection cavity, while allowing stem cells to migrate from the matrix into the 
parenchyma.
3.1.3 hMSCs migrate out of fibrin scaffolds and home to GBM cells—The tumor-
selective migration of stem cells is a critical component of their efficacy against GBM6,26. 
As such, it is vital that any scaffold delivery system permit the migration of engineered stem 
cells from the scaffold to collocalize with GBM. To study the migration and tumoritropic 
homing of hMSCs seeded in fibrin scaffolds, we developed a novel strategy that combined 
time-lapse motion analysis with 3-dimensional (3-D) under-agarose migration systems 
(outlined in Fig. 3A). In this system, a tissue culture dish is filled with a 0.6% agarose 
solution to mimic the composition of the brain. A cavity is created in the agarose and 
hMSC-GFPFLuc in fibrin scaffolds are seeded into the cavity. Human U87-mCFLuc are 
seeded into a second cavity 500 μm away to establish a chemotactic signaling gradient. The 
system is placed in an incubator microscope and kinetic images are captured every 20

 minutes for 64 hrs to define the migration of hMSCs as they move out of fibrin scaffolds 
through the agarose matrix towards the U87-mCFLuc cells.
Using this approach, time-lapse imaging showed that encapsulated hMSCs migrated out of 
the fibrin scaffolds and localized with co-cultured GBM cells in less than 64 hours (Fig. 3B 
and Suppl. Movie 1). Single cell analysis showed the migratory paths of the hMSCs were 
directed selectively towards the co-cultured GBM cells (Fig. 3C and Suppl. Movie 2), with 
few cells migrating in the opposite or lateral direction to the GBM cells (Fig. 3F). In 
contrast, few hMSCs migrated from the scaffold when GBM cells were not present (Fig. 3D 
and Suppl. Movie 3). Those cells that did exit the fibrin migrated in a random non-directed 
360° pattern (Fig. 3E, F and Suppl. Movie 4). Quantitative analysis showed the presence of 
GBM cells increased the directionality of hMSC migration 4.6-fold, increased the 
displacement of hMSCs from the fibrin matrix 5-fold, and increase the velocity of hMSC 
migration from .32 μm/sec to .35 μm/sec (Fig. 3G). Together, these data suggest that fibrin 
scaffolds are permissive to tumoritropic hMSC migration.
3.2 Anti-tumor efficacy
3.2. Efficacy of therapeutic hMSCs in fibrin against 3-D human GBM spheroids
—The ideal cytotoxic SC therapy must release tumoricidal agents at levels sufficient to 
eradicate GBM cells despite fibrin encapsulation. We used a 3-D levitation cultured strategy 
to more accurately mimic therapy for solid GBM foci (Fig. 4A). GBM cells were labeled 
with magnetic material and cultured in levitation by a magnet placed over the culture dish to 
form 3-D human GBM spheroids. The GBM spheroids were co-cultured with hMSC-sTR or 
control hMSC-GFPRLuc encapsulated in fibrin and tumor killing was determined by kinetic 
optical imaging. BLI performed 48 hrs later revealed hMSC-sTR/fibrin reduced the viability 
of solid GBM spheroids by 92% (U87), 85% (LN229), and 80% (U251) compared to 
control-treated spheroids (Fig. 4 B–C). To determine the hMSC-sTR:GBMs ratio required to 
induced tumor cell death, we cultured human GBM cells with decreasing numbers of 
hMSC-sTR encapsulated in fibrin. Using cell viability assays, we detected statistically 
significant reductions in tumor viability at ratios as low as 0.1:1, however minimal killing 
was observed at ratios of 0.02:1 (Fig. 4D–E). To investigate fibrin-based delivery of hMSCs 
releasing different therapeutic agents, we performed co-cutlure assays utilizing hMSCs 
engineered with thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme/prodrug therapy. In this approach, the TK 
gene is inserted into hMSCs (hMSC-TK). Therapy is initiated by addition of the inactive 
pro-drug ganciclovir (GCV), which is converted to a toxic product by TK. This approach 
has been widely used in cell-based cancer therapy. As shown in figure 4F, fibrin/hMSC-TK 
therapy signficiantly reduced the viability of both U87 and U251 human GBM cells. 
Together, these findings suggest that 1) hMSC-sTR release cytotoxic agents from the fibrin 
at levels that reduce viability of human GBM spheroids, 2) there is minimum ratio of 
hMSC-sTR:GBM cell required for efficient tumor killing, and 3) fibrin-based transplant 
effectively delivers hMSCs releasing different cytotoxic agents..
3.2.2 Solid tumor therapy using cytotoxic hMSC/fibrin composites—Cytotoxic 
hMSC/fibrin therapy could be used to efficaciously treat solid tumors if the fibrin matrices 
bearing the therapeutic SCs could be implanted in close proximity to the established tumors.

 To study the efficacy of fibrin-based cytotoxic hMSC therapy for solid tumors, U87-
mCFLuc cells were xenografted into mice and allowed to grow for 10 days. hMSC-sTR or 
control hMSC-GFPRLuc were encapsulated in fibrin patches. A skin incision was made 
over the established tumor, and the cytotoxic hMSC/fibrin composite matrix was surgically 
implanted over each tumor (outlined in Fig. 4G). Serial BLI of tumor growth showed the 
control-treated tumor expanded rapidly, increasing in size 8-fold over the next 11 days (Fig. 
4H–I In contrast, hMSC-sTR/fibrin therapy attenuated tumor progression, resulting in 
tumors that were only 1.8% larger 11 days post-treatment (Fig. 4H–I). Together, these 
findings demonstrate that fibrin-encapsulated hMSC-sTR therapy markedly attenuates the 
progression of solid tumors.
3.2.3 Intracavity cytotoxic hMSC/fibrin therapy for post-surgical minimal GBM
—Surgical resection is part of the clinical standard-of-care for human GBM patients1. 
Therefore, we determined the impact of fibrin-encapsulated hMSC-sTR intracavity therapy 
on post-surgical minimal GBMs. Human GBM cells were xenografted into the parenchyma 
of mice. 1 week later, the tumors were surgically resected. Cytotoxic hMSC-sTR or control 
hMSC-GFPRLuc were encapsulated in fibrin patches and transplanted into the resection 
cavity (outlined in Fig. 5A). Intra-operative fluorescent imaging was used to reveal the 
location of the mCherry+ GBM, guide surgical resection, and confirm efficient seeding of 
hMSC-sTR/fibrin into the resection cavity (Fig. 5B). Serial BLI revealed rapid GBM 
recurrence in control-treated animals, with tumors increasing 110-fold in 18 days (Fig. 5C–
D). In contrast, hMSC-sTR/fibrin therapy suppressed GBM recurrence 8-fold at 18 days 
after therapy. Survival analysis revealed the hMSC-sTR/fibrin tumor suppression allowed 
animals to survive more than 36 days after initial treatment (Fig. 5E). In contrast, control 
animals succumbed to recurrent GBMs only 15 days. Post-mortem tissue analysis revealed 
the presence of hMSC-sTR in the residual GBM microsatellite foci on the boarder of the 
GBM resection cavity (Fig. 5F). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that intracavity 
hMSC-sTR/fibrin therapy is a highly efficacious treatment for post-surgical minimal GBM.
4. Discussion
Thousands of patients die from brain cancer each year1,3. Cytotoxic SC therapy is a 
promising new strategy capable of eradicating primary and invasive GBM foci in pre-
clinical models5,6,27,28. Developing a strategy capable of retaining cytotoxic SCs within the 
post-surgical cavity is essential to preventing GBM recurrence in eventual clinical trials. 
Fibrin is extensively used for hemostasis in human surgery, biocompatible, and an effective 
scaffold for regenerative medicine applications15,17,18,29,30. Here, we exploit the beneficial 
properties of fibrin to create a new approach to cytotoxic SC therapy for GBM. We 
discovered that transplanting cytotoxic SCs in fibrin scaffolds significantly increased the 
initial retention and markedly prolonged the persistence (time to clearance) of the cells in 
the post-surgical GBM resection cavity. Yet, the fibrin matrix remained permissive to SC 
tumoritropic migration. In vivo, fibrin-based cytotoxic therapy reduced solid GBM, delayed 
post-surgical GBM recurrence, and prolonged survival of tumor bearing animals. Taken 
together, these findings reveal that transplanting cytotoxic SC in FDA-approved fibrin glue 
is a promising new strategy for treating post-surgical GBM.

 In this study, we used TISSEEL as the fibrin matrix. This fibrin sealant has been extensively 
characterized due to its wide use in human patients to achieve hemostasis. In addition to the 
active ingredient fibrinogen and thrombin, the product contains aprotinin, a protease 
inhibitor that prevent premature breakdown of the matrix 31. Studies have shown TISSEEL 
has a Young modulus of 15 kPa and tensile strength of 29 kPa32. Other fibrin matrices have 
been shown to be stronger and more resistant than TISSEEL, which has been attributed to 
the lack of fibrin-polymer crosslinking due the absence of factor XIII form the TISSEEL 
formulation. However, studies have shown that TISSEEL is predicted to be fully absorbed 
within 14 days31. We utilized the TISSEEL according to manufacturer’s suggestions and did 
not tune the fibrin matrix to alter rigidity, strength, or porosity. We found that the fibrin 
matrix did not interfere with the proliferation of cytotoxic SCs. Temporal analysis by both 
fluorescence and BLI imaging showed the rate of growth was not statistically different 
through 1 week between cytotoxic SCs that were grown on culture dishes or on fibrin 
matrices. Of equal importance, encapsulation of the cytotoxic SCs did not inhibit release of 
cytotoxic agents from the cells, even when the architecture of the scaffold was changed. 
This suggests fibrin encapsulation does not reduce the efficacy of tumoricidal SC therapy, 
and that it will be possible to create cytotoxic SC therapies from fibrin matrices of different 
shapes. Although our initial fibrin/thrombin ratios created a matrix with pores that allowed 
efficient drug release, this could be tuned even further by increasing or decreasing pore size 
by altering thrombin concentrations33. A denser fibrin network could provide additional 
structure support, but reducing the pore size beyond a certain size will eventually prevent 
efficient drug release and tumor killing. Future studies will be required to elucidate the ideal 
fibrin structure for SCs engineered with different cytotoxic agents.
The ideal scaffold material for transplanting cytotoxic SCs in clinical GBM patient testing is 
unknown. A rapidly polymerizing matrix would shorten surgical time and eliminate the risk 
of physical washout of SCs. The matrix material should be biocompatible to avoid immune 
reaction and biostable to provide lasting structural support for the therapeutic SCs in the 
cavity. The material must support retention of SCs within the surgical cavity, yet allow 
therapeutic agents released from cytotoxic SCs to penetrate the matrix and induce killing in 
the GBM. Tumor-homing migration is a key advantage of SC therapy5,6, and the matrix 
material should also permit the migration of SCs out of the matrix and into residual GBM 
foci. A pliable matrix would allow reshaping to determine the optimal matrix architecture 
that maximizes cytotoxic SC survival, drug release, and migration. Material with hemostatic 
properties would control post-surgical bleeding and potentially improve both SC survival 
and patient recovery16. Lastly, matrix material currently approved for use in human surgery 
would increase the clinical utility of this approach and increase the rate of translation into 
human patient testing.
For cytotoxic SC therapy, the transplant matrix must retain cytotoxic SCs within the surgical 
cavity, yet also permit tumoritropic migration to eradicate distant invasive GBM foci. To 
date, the “gold standard” for in vitro cell migration has been boyden chamber transwell 
assays9,34. However, this method is severely limited in several ways. In particular, the 
transwell layout prevents serial imaging to kinetically track cell movement. Therefore, we 
combined under-agar assays with real-time kinetic imaging to establish a new approach to

 track stem cell migration. In this approach, the use of agar allows us to establish a 
chemotactic gradient that more accurately mimics the in vivo scenario. Additionally, the 
ability to perform time-lapse imaging not only allows continuous visualization of cell 
movement over 2–3 days, but also allows determination of valuable kinetic information 
(directionality, displacement, and velocity of movement) that cannot be measured in 
transwell assays. Our imaging results showed the presence of human GBM cells drew 
hMSCs out of the fibrin matrix, as the SC migrated selectively to the cancer cells. This 
migration was directional, as few hMSCs migrated in opposite directions or lateral to the 
GBM. The presence of the GBM cells also increased the velocity of the hMSC migration. In 
the absence of GBM cells, the hMSCs remained primarily in the fibrin, slowly migrating out 
in a random 360-degree pattern. Although unexplored in the context of brain cancer, hMSCs 
are known to migrate out of fibrin matrices35. Furthermore, altering the composition of the 
fibrin matrix significantly changes to the migratory capacity of the cells. This suggests that 
fine-tuning the fibrin matrix could further improve the tumoritropic migration of the hMSCs 
to GBM cells. However, it is unclear whether altering the matrix to maximize migration will 
negatively impact the ability of the scaffold to retain SCs within the surgical cavity.
Retaining transplanted cytotoxic SCs within the post-surgical GBM cavity is an enormous 
challenge. We found that cytotoxic hMSCs within fibrin matrices increased initial cell 
retention 2-fold compared to traditional direct-injection methods. Additionally, more than 
21-fold greater levels of hMSCs suspended in fibrin were present in the brain at day 7 when 
fibrin-based transplant was used, and these cells persisted markedly longer than cells 
delivered via direct injection. These findings were confirmed by post-mortem analysis. Ex 
vivo BLI and fluorescence imaging showed significantly greater numbers of fibrin-
transplanted cells were present in the resection cavity compared to direct injection. 
Fluorescence analysis of brain sections revealed a significant number of fibrin-encapsulated 
hMSCs lined the walls of the resection cavity three weeks post-transplant, yet only a few 
residual cells remained in the direct injection group. These data suggest fibrin-based 
matrices improve the retention and persistence of cytotoxic SCs within the surgical cavity. 
Matrices and materials that improve cytotoxic SC retention within the GBM cavity are 
virtually unexplored. Previously, we found hylarunonic acid (HLA) hydrogels improve the 
retention of mouse neural stem cells delivered into the resection cavity14. However, the 
rapid gelation time of fibrin reduces the potential for cell washout and surgical time if 
intracavity polymerization is utilized. Additionally, the increased pliability of fibrin over the 
rigid HLA provides opportunities for new and potentially more effective scaffold 
architectures to be formed ex vivo or re-molding of pre-formed patches to conform to the 
unique architectures of different surgical cavities. Additionally, the hemostatic properties of 
the fibrin can aid in controlling post-operative bleeding, a benefit that cannot be achieved 
with the HLA. Importantly, TISSEEL is a FDA-approved matrix that is already used during 
human GBM patient surgery, a benefit that should expedite the translation of fibrin-based 
cytotoxic SC therapy into clinical trials.
We investigated the cytotoxic effects of fibrin-encapsulated hMSC therapy using 3-D cell 
culture models. In our unique approach, magnetic beads were used to create 3-D cell 
spheroids of different human GBM cells lines36. These tumor spheroids were then

 suspended adjacent to fibrin-encapsulated SCs releasing the pro-apoptotic agent TRAIL. 
Although 2-D cultures remain the mainstay of preclinical studies, 3-D models more 
accurately mimic the in vivo environment. We discovered that fibrin-based hMSC-sTR 
therapy reduced the viability of all three human GBM spheroids tested compared to control-
treated spheroids, although the response was slightly varied across cell lines. We 
purposefully selected TRAIL because we have extensively demonstrated the anti-GBM 
effects of SC engineered with this secreted agent11,12,37–39. This makes TRAIL ideal for use 
in characterizing the therapeutic efficacy of untested cell matrices such as fibrin. TRAIL 
induces killing by binding to death receptors present on the surface of tumor cells and 
triggers a well-characterized caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death40. The fact that death 
receptors are present primarily on tumor cells provides high specificity for tumor killing and 
allows minimal toxicity to normal (non-cancerous) tissue in the brain. GBM is a 
heterogeneous disease and studies have demonstrated that the levels of death receptors vary 
in GBM cells. As the level of death receptor expression decreases, the response of GBM 
cells to TRAIL-induced cell death decreases. Therefore, the variability in the response of the 
U87, LN229, and U251 cells lines is due to differences in death receptor expression between 
the tumor lines11,41. However, we observed that TRAIL therapy induced >80% killing in all 
three lines. This supports the conclusion that this approach would result in substantial tumor 
kill across multiple GBM cell lines. It is likely that different drug combinations will be 
needed to fully eradicate GBM in clinical trials. Future studies will focus on the 
development of fibrin-based transplant of new single-agent therapies as well as new multi-
drug hMSC combination therapies.
In our study, fibrin-based transplant of cytotoxic SCs into the post-surgical GBM resection 
cavity suppressed GBM recurrence 5.4-fold in 3 weeks. However, more impressively, fibrin-
based hMSC-sTR treatment prolonged the median survival of post-operative mice from 15 
to 36 days. This suggests that transplanting cytotoxic hMSCs suspended in fibrin is an 
efficacious new approach for treating post-surgical GBM. Despite the robust tumor 
suppression and extensions in survival, the GBM still recurred. The mechanisms driving 
recurrence are unknown. Further development of the fibrin scaffold could improve 
persistence of the cytotoxic SCs by altering scaffold composition or architecture. The fibrin 
scaffolds could be used to deliver multi-drug hMSC therapies to target drug-resistant tumor 
populations. The ability of fibrin to encapsulate large numbers of cells suggests a higher 
initial dose of cytotoxic SCs could be delivered which could improve tumor killing, but 
increased dose could risk drug-related toxicities to non-cancer tissue. Fibrin itself has been 
extensively utilized as a drug depot, delivering numerous small molecule agents42. This 
could allow for new combination therapies delivered simultaneously from the scaffold and 
cytotoxic SCs. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of fibrin-based delivery of 
small molecule drugs, such as temozolomide. However, similar to the clinically utilized 
polymer-based delivery system Gliadel, the efficacy of this approach is likely limited by 
reliance on the passive diffusion of the drug that is unable to reach invasive foci beyond 2cm 
from the resection cavity43,44. The current approach uses fibrin to delivery tumoricidal SCs 
capable actively exiting the scaffolds and homing to distant GBM cells. This approach 
should improve killing of invasive tumor cells and improve treatment response, particularly 
for distant invasive GBM foci.

 Although the results of this study are promising, there are several limitation. First, the 
optimal degradation rate of the fibrin matrix remains unknown. The fibrin must stabilize 
cytotoxic stem cells within the surgical cavity long enough to prevent surgery-induced 
clearance, yet must release the cells to allow accumulation in tumor foci and tumor kill. It is 
unclear whether a rapid degradation that allows cells to be quickly released into the brain 
parenchyma is more effective than a slow-degrading stable matrix. In addition, altering the 
matrix could influence the differentiation of the tumoricidal stem cells it is delivering, as 
stiffness of substrates has been shown to impact the outgrowth of neurites45. We are actively 
exploring the impact of various degradation rates on cytotoxic stem cell migration, anti-
tumor efficacy, and differentiation. Similarly, we are also exploring different strategies for 
delivering the fibrin/stem cell composition as fibrin spray is commonly used in the clinical 
setting and has been shown to efficiently deliver hMSCs46. Secondly, these studies were 
performed using models of human GBM resection/recurrence in immune-depleted mice. 
This leaves the impact of the immune system unknown. Fibrin is extensively used in human 
patients where it is known induce minimal immune activation. Yet, further studies exploring 
fibrin-based cytotoxic stem cell transplant in immune-competent hosts are required to fully 
define the immune activation associated with this approach and the impact this may have on 
treatment efficacy. Lastly, the small scale of the mouse brain leaves the question of scale-up 
unanswered. Large animal models of GBM resection/recurrence will be needed to determine 
the quantity, size, shape, and stem cell number required to effectively treat a human-scale 
surgical cavity in eventual human patient testing.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the findings of this study reveal that fibrin scaffolds are a promising new 
approach for intra-cavity cytotoxic SC therapy of surgically resected GBM. In this way, 
neurosurgeons could deliver the fibrin/cytotoxic stem cell solution onto the walls of the 
resection cavity following GBM removal in eventual human patient trials. The extensive 
clinical use of fibrin should ease the translation of these preclinical studies into patient trials.

 Figure 1. Characterization of cytotoxic hMSCs within fibrin matrices
(A) Representative white-light images demonstrating the rapid gelation of fibrinogen 5, 10, 
and 30 seconds after the addition of thrombin to create encapsulated cytotoxic stem cells. 
(B) SEM images showing fibrin matrices encapsulating engineered hMSCs. Cross-sectional 
analysis revealed the presence of hMSCs within the fibrin matrix (indicated with 
arrowhead). Dotted line depicts site of cross section. (C) Representative fluorescent and BLI 
depicting the growth of hMSC in fibrin over time. Fluorescent images are captured at 10x to 
depict cellular morphology and 2x to demonstrate overall cell growth. Simultaneous BLI 
was performed to validate cell volumes. (D) Summary graph comparing the growth of 
hMSC-sTR cultured with or without Fibrin. P>0.05 value by Two-Way ANOVA. (E) 
Summary data showing the levels of cytotoxic protein secreted by hMSC-diTR grown in 
different fibrin matrices or without scaffolds. “Droplet” formation was created by 
suspending and polymerizing stem cells in a droplet of fibrin. The “encapsulated patch” was 
created by encapsulating stem cells in a fibrin droplet that was pressed into a flat sheet. The 
“surface patch” was created by seeding stem cells onto the surface of a fibrin scaffold that 
was polymerized and flattened. Secretion was determined by BLI on media samples 
collected 1, 3, and 6 days after seeding. Data in D and E are mean ± SEM and represent 3 
different experiments performed in triplicate. Scale bar in B from left to right are 250 μm, 50 
μm and 10 μm.

 Figure 2. Fibrin scaffolds improve the retention and persistence of engineered hMSCs 
transplanted into the postoperative surgical cavity
(A) Intra-operative images showing the seeding of engineered hMSCs encapsulated in fibrin 
matrices within the post-surgical cavity. Mice were immobilized on stereotactic devices (1) 
and an incision was made in the scalp (2). A craniotomy was performed to expose the 
underlying tumor (3) that was resected using image-guided microsurgery to create a 
resection cavity (4). Engineered hMSCs were seeded into the cavity in fibrin (5). The skin 
was then closed over the resection cavity (6). (B) Summary graph demonstrating that fibrin-
based transplant increases the retention of hMSCS transplanted into the post-surgical cavity 
compared to traditional direct injection. Retention was determined by quantitative BLI to 
detect hMSC volumes 3 hrs after transplant. *P<0.05 by Student’s t test. (C–D) 
Representative images and summary data demonstrating hMSCS transplanted in the 
resection cavity in a fibrin matrix persist significantly longer than hMSCs delivered by 
direct injection. BLI images were captured longitudinally on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 
post-transplant to track the levels of transplanted hMSCs. *P<0.01 by repeated measures 
ANOVA. (E) Ex vivo fluorescent and BLI imaging of brains 21 days after transplanting 
hMSC-mCFLuc into the resection cavity via fibrin or direct injection. A hMSC-mCFLuc 
signal was detected in the fibrin-transplanted animals in both the dorsal view and coronal 
cross-sections, but no signal was detected in the direct injection brains. (F–G) 
Representative fluorescent images showing the presence of hMSC-mCFLuc in the 
parenchyma following delivery into the resection cavity in fibrin (F) or by direct injection 
(G). Whole brain photo-stitched images are shown. * indicates the resection cavity. The

 Figure 3. Fibrin matrices are permissive to the tumoritropic migration of engineered hMSCs
The migration of fibrin-encapsulated stem cells to GBM cells was measured using time-
lapse motion analysis and under-agar co-culture system. (A) Schematic depiction of the co-
culture strategy. GFP+ stem cells were encapsulated in fibrin and seeded into one well of an 
agar-filled culture dish. mCherry+ U87 human GBM cells were seeded 500 μm away in an 
adjacent well. The cells were placed under a fluorescence microscope in an incubator and 
images were captured every 20 minutes for 64 hours. Image analysis software was then used 
to generate time-lapse movies, perform single-cell tracking, and quantify migratory 
direction, distance, and velocity. The imaging field is depicted by the dotted blue line. (B) 
Summary images showing hMSCs (green) migrate out of fibrin and home to co-cultured 
GBM cells (red). (C) Single-cell analysis depicting the migratory path of hMSCs from fibrin 
scaffolds as they home to GBM cells over time. Each line depicts the path of one cell. (D) 
Fluorescent images and single-cell analysis (E) showing the random motion of hMSCs in 
fibrin when cultured without GBM cells. (F) Rosetta graphs demonstrating the directed 
migration hMSCs out of fibrin scaffolds when GBM are present and the random migration 
of hMSCs from fibrin without GBM. (G) Summary graphs showing the directionality, 
displacement, and velocity of hMSCs in fibrin in the presence and absence (control) of 
human GBM cells. *P<0.05 by Student’s t test. Scale bars in B and D are 400 μm.

 Figure 4. Transplanting cytotoxic hMSC/fibrin composites inhibit the progression of solid 
tumors
(A) The efficacy of hMSC-sTR encapsulated in fibrin for treatment of solid GBM was first 
determined using 3-D GBM spheroids and levitation culture. Human GBM cells were 
loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and seeded in 6-well plates. A magnetic driver was 
placed over the dish to levitate the GBM cells. Once spheroids were formed (24 hrs later), 
the spheroids were plated adjacent to hMSC-sTR or hMSC-GFPRLuc encapsulated in fibrin. 
Tumor spheroid viability was determined using FLuc BLI. (B–C) Representative images and 
summary graph demonstrating the significant reduction in the viability of different human 
GBM cell spheroids by hMSC-sTR/fibrin treatment compared to control-treated spheroids. 
*P<0.05 by Student’s t test. (D–E) Representative fluorescent images (D) and summary data 
(E) showing the viability of human GBM spheroids (red) cultured with increasing numbers 
of hMSC-sTR encapsulated in fibrin (green). The dotted line indicates the boarder f the 
fibrin matrix. *P<0.01 by repeated measures ANOVA. (F) Representative images and 
summary data demonstrating the anti-tumor killing effects of hMSC-TK/GCV therapy (red) 
on U87 and U251 human tumor spheroids (green). The dotted line indicates the boarder of 
the fibrin matrix. *P<0.05 by Student’s t test. (G) To determine the efficacy of fibrin-based 
hMSC delivery on established tumors, U87-mCFLuc xenografts were created in mice. Fibrin 
patches were created bearing hMSC-sTR or control hMSC-GFPRLuc. An incision was 
made over the established tumor in mice (1), the pre-formed scaffold bearing the SCs were 
surgically implanted over each established tumor (2–3), and the skin incision was closed (4). 
(H–I) Serial bioluminescence imaging was used to follow the growth tumors in each 
treatment group. Significantly smaller tumor volumes were observed in hMSC-sTR-treated

 Figure 5. Cytotoxic hMSCs delivered into the resection cavity in fibrin delay re-growth of post-
surgical residual GBM
(A) To mimic clinical fibrin-delivered stem cell therapy for surgically resected GBM, 
established intracranial human GBMs were surgically debulked in mice. Therapeutic stem 
cells were transplanted into the post-operative cavity in fibrin patches. (B) Representative 
images showing pre-resection mCherry+ GBMs, the post-surgical GBM cavity, and GFP+ 
hMSC-sTR in fibrin seeded in the resection cavity. The dotted line indicates the resection 
cavity. The arrowheads indicate residual GBM foci. (C-D) Representative images (C) and 
summary graph (D) of serial BLI showing a significant reduction in GBM regrowth in 
hMSC-sTR-treated animals compared to control-treated animals. Significantly smaller 
tumor volumes were observed in hMSC-sTR-treated tumors across multiple time points. 
*P<0.01 by repeated measures ANOVA. (E) Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis showing the 
survival of animals with resected GBMs treated with hMSC-sTR therapy or control hMSC-
GFPRLuc. Median survival was 36 days for hMSC-sTR treated animals vs. 15 days for 
control-treated mice.. *P<0.01 by log-rank test. (F) Fluorescent images of post-mortem 
tissue sections showing the presence of GFP+ hMSCs (green) along the boarder of the 
recurrent GBM (red). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (blue). Data in D are mean ± 
SEM. Scale bar in F is 100μm.
