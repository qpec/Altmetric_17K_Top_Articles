Abstract
Background—Vaccination protects individuals directly and communities indirectly by reducing 
transmission. We aimed to determine whether information about herd immunity and local 
vaccination coverage could change an individual’s vaccination plans and concern about influenza.
Methods—We surveyed Minnesota residents 18 years during the 2016 Minnesota State Fair. 
Participants were asked to identify the definition of herd immunity, to report their history of and 
plans to receive influenza vaccine, to report their concern about influenza, and to estimate the 
reported influenza vaccination coverage in their county. After providing educational information 
about herd immunity and local vaccination rates, we reassessed vaccination plans and concerns. 
We used logistic regression to estimate predicted percentages for those willing to be vaccinated, 
for concern about influenza, and for changes in these outcomes after the intervention. We then 
compared those individuals with and without prior knowledge of herd immunity, accounting for 
other characteristics.

 Results—Among 554 participants, the median age was 57 years; most were female (65.9%), 
white (91.0%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (93.9%). Overall, 37.2% of participants did not know 
about herd immunity and 75.6% thought that the influenza vaccination coverage in their county 
was higher than it was reported. Those not knowledgeable about herd immunity were significantly 
less likely than those knowledgeable about the concept to report plans to be vaccinated at baseline 
(67.8% versus 78.9%; p = 0.004). After learning about herd immunity and influenza vaccination 
coverage, the proportion of those not knowledgeable about herd immunity who were willing to be 
vaccinated increased significantly by 7.3 percentage points (p = 0.001). Educating participants 
eliminated the significant difference in the proportion planning to be vaccinated between these two 
groups (80.1% of those knowledgeable and 75.1% of those who were not initially knowledgeable 
became willing; p = 0.148).
Conclusions—Education about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could be a useful 
tool for increasing willingness to vaccinate, generating benefits both to individuals and 
communities.

1. Background and significance
Influenza is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease that is responsible for an estimated 3–5 
million cases of severe illness and 250,000–500,000 deaths each year primarily among 
young children, the elderly, and pregnant women [1,2]. The annual incidence depends on 
many factors including the variability of circulating strains, the proportion of individuals in 
the population who have acquired natural immunity or who have been immunized, and the 
efficacy of the annual vaccine [3]. Maintaining high vaccination coverage is important 
because the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is relatively low and not everyone can be 
vaccinated [4–6]. Beginning in 2010 in the United States, annual influenza vaccination was 
recommended for all individuals aged 6 months or older with the exception of those with 
medical contraindications [7]. Despite this universal recommendation and the Healthy 
People 2020 target of 70% vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
estimate that only 45.6% of the U.S. population and 49.7% of Minnesota residents were 
vaccinated against influenza during the 2015–16 influenza season [8–10].
Vaccination protects individuals directly by inducing an immune response and protects 
communities indirectly by reducing transmission and the risk of infection. Indirect 
protection at the community level provides additional benefit beyond what would be 
expected from direct protection alone [3,11]. This concept of “herd immunity” or 
“community immunity” demonstrates that vaccinating a high proportion of the population 
can prevent outbreaks and protect both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The degree 
to which vaccination can reduce transmission in a population depends upon several factors, 
including the transmissibility of the pathogen, the network of human interactions and 
frequency of contacts, and the effectiveness and distribution of the vaccine. Herd immunity 
is best thought of as a continuum rather than a threshold [12]. Estimates of the influenza 
vaccination coverage needed to maximize the benefits of herd immunity and reduce disease

 transmission vary widely; under various scenarios vaccinating 33–73% of the population can 
prevent outbreaks [3,12].
Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals consider community-level benefits of 
vaccination in addition to personal benefits when choosing whether to be vaccinated [13]. 
While willingness to vaccinate was highest when individuals themselves were at risk, Vietri 
et al. found that college students were more willing to be vaccinated when they were told 
that 95% of the community would benefit from their decision compared to a scenario where 
only 10% would benefit [14,15]. A systematic review found that between 1 and 6% of 
parents chose benefit to others as their primary motive for vaccinating their children while 
37% ranked benefit to others as their secondary motive [16,17]. Since maximizing 
community-level benefits of vaccination requires high levels of vaccine uptake, some 
vaccination campaigns have sought to increase willingness to be vaccinated by emphasizing 
the added communal benefits. For example, ‘Do It For The Herd’ is a frequent phrase used 
to promote free influenza vaccination clinics for University of Minnesota students, faculty, 
staff, and others which is aimed at increasing vaccination coverage by emphasizing the 
population-level benefits of decreasing transmission [18].
Despite these efforts, little is known about whether individuals are aware of the impact of 
their vaccination decision on their community and whether receiving education about the 
community-level benefits of immunization and the vaccination coverage in their county will 
influence their willingness to be vaccinated. To address this, we aimed to determine (1) 
whether participants were familiar with both (a) the concept of herd immunity and the 
vaccination coverage needed for community-wide protection and (b) the vaccination 
coverage in their county, and (2) whether individual plans to get vaccinated and/or concern 
about getting influenza would change after providing education about herd immunity and 
reported, local vaccination rates.
2. Research methods
2.1. Setting and study design
We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the University of Minnesota’s (UMN) Driven to 
Discover (D2D) Research Facility over a 4-day period at the 2016 Minnesota State Fair, a 
12-day event held annually in August and attended by 1.9 million individuals. The UMN 
D2D Facility is a building on the grounds of the state fair where researchers can conduct 
studies by recruiting individuals attending the fair. Prior to implementing the survey, we 
conducted a small pilot study to refine the questions and the educational information 
provided.
2.2. Participant recruitment
Potential participants were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, residents of 
Minnesota for at least six months of the year, and could read, speak, and understand English. 
Eligibility and consent were determined prior to participants self-administering the 5–10 
minute survey using Apple iPads.

 2.3. Survey methodology
The survey consisted of a maximum of 26 questions (Table 1) about demographic 
characteristics, county of residence, knowledge of herd immunity, history and frequency of 
influenza vaccination, willingness to get vaccinated, and concern about influenza. 
Participants were then asked to estimate the percentage of the population of their county that 
would need to be vaccinated for the community to benefit from herd immunity (by 
preventing outbreaks, thus protecting everyone even those who are not vaccinated) and to 
estimate the percentage of the population in their county that had received the influenza 
vaccine in the previous year. After entering these estimates, participants were presented with 
written statements via the iPads to educate themselves about (1) the definition of herd 
immunity; (2) the reported 2015–2016 influenza vaccine uptake among individuals 6 months 
and older in their own county obtained from the Minnesota Department of Health’s 
Immunization Information Connection (MIIC), a statewide Immunization Information 
System (IIS) [19]; and (3) that at least 70% of a community needed to be vaccinated to 
prevent outbreaks and benefit everyone. Since the estimates for coverage needed to 
maximize the benefits of herd immunity and reduce disease transmission vary widely, 70% 
was chosen based on previous research and to align with the Healthy People 2020 influenza 
vaccination target [3,8]. Following this educational intervention, participants were again 
asked to report (1) how likely they were to get vaccinated against influenza in the upcoming 
year and (2) how concerned they would be about getting influenza in the upcoming year if 
they did not get vaccinated, and, in addition, (3) how concerned they were that an outbreak 
might occur in their county (post-intervention only). We collected and managed survey data 
using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software, a secure, web-based 
application designed to support data capture for research studies [20].
2.4. Ethical approval
The University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed and approved the 
study after determining that it met Exempt Category 2 guidelines.
2.5. Categorization of survey responses
To assess prior knowledge of herd immunity, we asked participants to select the correct 
definition from five options presented. Participants who chose ‘vaccinating enough people to 
protect even those who are not vaccinated’ were categorized as ‘knowledgeable about herd 
immunity’; all others were categorized as ‘not knowledgeable about herd immunity’.
To assess the vaccination coverage needed to prevent outbreaks (herd immunity), we 
categorized participants as ‘overestimated the reported herd immunity level’ if they 
estimated a level >75% (more than 5% over 70% coverage), as ‘underestimated the reported 
herd immunity level’ if they estimated a level < 65% (more than 5% under 70% coverage), 
and as ‘correct herd immunity level’ if they estimated within ±5% of 70% coverage.
To assess the vaccination coverage in participants’ own counties in the past year, we 
categorized participants as ‘overestimated the vaccination coverage’ if they estimated a level 
more than 5% over the reported coverage, as ‘underestimated the vaccination coverage’ if

 they estimated a level more than 5% under the reported coverage, and as ‘correct vaccination 
coverage’ if they estimated within ±5% of the reported coverage.
Plans to get vaccinated and concern about getting influenza were assessed on 5-point Likert 
scales. Participants were categorized as ‘planning to get vaccinated’ if they responded 
‘extremely likely’ or ‘likely’, as ‘not planning to get vaccinated’ if they responded 
‘extremely unlikely’ or unlikely’, and as ‘undecided’ if they responded ‘undecided’. 
Participants were categorized as ‘concerned about getting influenza’ if they responded 
‘somewhat’, ‘moderately’, or ‘extremely’ concerned, and as ‘not concerned about getting 
influenza’ if they responded ‘not at all’ or ‘slightly’ concerned. The same categorization was 
used to categorize the responses for ‘concern about an influenza outbreak’.
2.6. Statistical methods
We aimed to evaluate the relationship between participants’ knowledge of herd immunity, 
estimates about influenza vaccination coverage, estimates about how high coverage needs to 
be to protect everyone, and participants’ plans to get vaccinated, concern about getting 
influenza, and their change in plans and concern before and after the intervention.
Chi-square tests were used to assess the univariate relationships between knowledge of herd 
immunity and expectations about vaccination coverage and (a) plans to vaccinate, (b) 
concern about influenza, and (c) concern about an outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression 
models were used to estimate the predicted probabilities of vaccination plans and concern 
about getting influenza for participants who were knowledgeable about herd immunity 
compared with those who were not knowledgeable. The probabilities of these two outcomes 
were estimated both before and after participants learned about herd immunity, the coverage 
needed for protection, the benefits of herd immunity, and the reported vaccination coverage 
in their county. All regression models controlled for age (in years), sex (male, female, other), 
race (white, non-white), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic/ Latino), education level 
(High School Degree or less, Associates Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, Graduate Degree), 
county of residence (within Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area, outside metro) and whether 
participants had ever had an influenza vaccination (yes, no). Participants with missing 
responses could not be included in analyses where that response was required. The marginal 
standardization method was used to estimate the probabilities [21]. Predicted probabilities 
were multiplied by 100 and reported as percentages. Differences or changes in predicted 
percentages were reported for all regression models with 95% confidence intervals and p-
values calculated using the bootstrap [22]. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all 
statistical tests. Stata 14 was used for data management and analysis [23].
3. Results
3.1. Participant characteristics
Of the 554 adults who completed the survey, the median age was 57 years, the majority were 
female (65.9%), white (91.0%), and non-Hispanic or Latino (93.9%) (Table 1). Participants 
were also highly educated with 56.9% reporting having a Bachelor’s degree or higher (Table 
1).

 3.2. Participant knowledge
3.2.1. Influenza vaccination—Overall, the majority of participants considered 
themselves somewhat or very knowledgeable about vaccines (79.9%) (Table 2). Medical 
professionals, including doctors, pediatricians, and nurses, were the most common primary 
source of information about vaccines (47.3%) (Table 2). Of the 86.8% of participants who 
reported having been vaccinated against influenza at least once in their lifetime, the majority 
(74.6%, n = 359) reported that they had received a flu vaccination last year and 64.0% (n = 
308) reported that they had received a flu vaccine every year for the past ten years (Table 2). 
Respondents were most likely to identify their concern about influenza or concern about 
their health in general as the primary reason for vaccination (47.6%, n = 229) (Table 2). Of 
the 13.2% of all participants who indicated that they had never before received an influenza 
vaccine, 28.8% (n = 21) reported that the primary reason was that they never get sick while 
17.8% (n = 13) noted that that they were concerned about potential side effects (Table 2).
Overall, based on the survey responses alone without adjusting for any other factors or 
considering prior knowledge, before learning about herd immunity or vaccination coverage 
levels, 65.7% of participants reported that they were likely to get vaccinated in the upcoming 
year, while 22.7% were not planning to get vaccinated and 11.6% were undecided (Table 2).
3.2.2. Herd immunity—The majority of participants (62.8%) correctly identified the 
definition of herd immunity (Table 2). In unadjusted analyses, prior to the intervention, 
79.9% of participants who were knowledgeable about herd immunity were planning to get 
vaccinated compared to only 64.6% of participants who were not knowledgeable (Chi-
squared test of proportion; p = 0.0002); after the intervention, 81.8% of knowledgeable 
participants reported plans to get vaccinated compared to 70.9% of participants who were 
not knowledgeable (Chi-squared test of proportion; p = 0.005).
3.3. Expectations about local vaccination coverage and coverage needed to benefit from 
herd immunity
Minnesota county-level influenza vaccination coverage for 2015–2016 ranged from a low of 
26.3% in Todd County to a high of 50.6% in Lincoln County. The majority of participants 
(80.7%) were residents of Hennepin, Ramsey, Dakota, Anoka, Washington, Olmsted, Scott, 
Chisago, Wright, and Carver counties (listed in descending order), where influenza 
vaccination coverage ranged from 27.2% to 40.8%. Only 13.7% of participants estimated the 
influenza vaccination coverage within 5% of the reported coverage in their own county 
(Table 2). The majority of participants (75.6%) assumed that vaccination coverage was 
higher than reported levels (Table 2), overestimating the percentage vaccinated by 28.0 
percentage points on average (Fig. 1). Participants estimated a wide range of coverage levels 
needed to benefit from herd immunity; 30.1% thought that <65% coverage would be needed 
and 42.2% estimated that over 75% coverage would be needed (Table 2).
3.4. Impact of information about herd immunity and vaccination coverage on plans to be 
vaccinated
Results from the multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, before the 
educational information was presented, a significantly higher proportion of participants who

 were knowledgeable about herd immunity planned to get vaccinated compared with those 
who were not knowledgeable (78.9% [95% CI: 75.1–82.6%] versus 67.8% [95% CI: 61.3–
74.2%]; p = 0.004) (Table 3). Significant increases in vaccination plans pre- and post-
intervention were observed among participants who were not knowledgeable about herd 
immunity but not among those who were knowledgeable about herd immunity, as would be 
expected (Table 3). Among those who were not knowledgeable about herd immunity, the 
percentage planning to get vaccinated increased 7.3 percentage points (95% CI for the 
change: +3.1, 12.5) from 67.8% to 75.1% (p = 0.001) after learning about herd immunity 
(Table 3). While before the intervention, those knowledgeable about herd immunity were 
significantly more likely to have plans to be vaccinated than those not knowledgeable about 
herd immunity (p = 0.004), after the intervention, there was no significant difference 
between the two groups (p = 0.148) (Table 3).
3.5. Impact of information about herd immunity and vaccination coverage on change in 
concern about influenza
In univariate analyses, a significantly higher proportion of participants who learned that the 
reported vaccination coverage in their county was lower than they expected were concerned 
about an outbreak occurring than those who found out that the coverage was higher than 
they expected (76.4% versus 63.6%; p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference 
in concern about influenza between those who were knowledgeable and not knowledgeable 
about herd immunity before or after the intervention, though the proportion concerned 
increased significantly in both groups (Table 4).
4. Discussion
We found that while the majority of participants were familiar with the concept of herd 
immunity, most incorrectly believed that the vaccination coverage in their county was higher 
than it actually was during the 2015–16 influenza season. Those who were least informed 
about herd immunity were the least likely to plan to get vaccinated before the intervention 
and also had the largest significant increase in the proportion willing to be vaccinated after 
receiving education about local vaccination coverage and the benefits of herd immunity. This 
suggests that educating individuals about the importance of the community benefits of 
vaccination, even when briefly providing basic information, could have important 
implications for improving vaccine uptake especially among those least knowledgeable.
A recently published study by Betsch et al. [24] evaluated the likelihood of vaccination 
when participants were told that their contribution to herd immunity protects a large 
proportion of their community. They concluded that communication about herd immunity 
benefits improved the willingness of individuals to consider vaccination and that social 
motives could increase vaccination rates when used as a tool for vaccine advocacy [24]. In 
our study, we tested a simple, novel intervention by educating respondents about the concept 
of herd immunity and the vaccination levels in their county, the latter being information that 
is not typically readily available to individuals. We found that this information led to 
changes in the proportion of individuals who planned to get vaccinated, suggesting higher 
vaccine acceptance, especially among those who were previously uninformed about herd

 immunity. Allison et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey about school-based 
immunization programs, and they found that if parents believed that influenza vaccination 
was a social norm, they were more likely to have their child immunized [25]. In this study, 
we have also demonstrated the value of informing individuals about local vaccination rates, 
even when vaccination rates are low. Future studies could further explore this concept by 
testing more complex and nuanced interventions that incorporate knowledge of local 
vaccination uptake into educational campaigns as part of efforts to increase vaccination. Our 
results also suggest that increases in plans to get vaccinated might be achieved if information 
about herd immunity and local vaccination rates were made available more widely. The 
potential impact of such an intervention on vaccination rates would require further 
investigation.
Our study explored the effects of learning about local vaccination rates and the community-
level benefits of herd immunity on plans to get vaccinated during the upcoming year. We 
delivered an innovative educational intervention to examine whether information about herd 
immunity and local vaccination rates could impact individual plans to get vaccinated and 
concern about getting influenza immediately among a large sample of adults. However, our 
study may be limited in that we utilized a convenience sample, which is unlikely to be 
representative of the broader population given the demographic distribution; in addition, 
participants self-reported their influenza vaccination status, their history of influenza 
vaccination, their plans to get vaccinated in the future, and their concern about getting 
influenza. Further studies are needed to determine whether these self-reported changes 
translate into changes in actual vaccination rates; our study provides evidence to motivate 
researchers to investigate further. Other studies could also take into consideration the 
confidence that participants have in vaccinations or providers, access to affordable and 
convenient vaccinations, and whether complacency about vaccination exists as all could 
influence vaccine hesitancy.
The findings of our study present a first step towards investigating how learning local 
vaccination rates and the benefits of herd immunity may increase plans to get vaccinated. 
When participants were informed about herd immunity, the vaccination coverage in their 
county, and the vaccination coverage needed to prevent outbreaks, the percentage of 
participants with plans to get vaccinated increased significantly among those who were not 
previously knowledgeable about herd immunity when compared to those who were 
knowledgeable. Prior to the intervention, knowledgeable participants were more likely to 
have plans to vaccinate, while after the education was delivered, plans to get vaccinated 
increased among those who were not knowledgeable and there was no significant difference 
in the percent of participants with plans to vaccinate between those who were previously 
knowledgeable about herd immunity and those who were not.
5. Conclusions
Education about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could be a useful tool in 
increasing vaccination rates and benefiting communities. After the intervention, a higher 
proportion of participants reported that they had plans to get vaccinated and were concerned 
about getting influenza after learning about herd immunity and the vaccination coverage in

 their county. Initially, those who were least informed about herd immunity were significantly 
less likely than those with some knowledge of herd immunity to plan to get vaccinated, but 
their willingness to vaccinate significantly increased after receiving education about local 
vaccination coverage and the benefits of herd immunity, closing the gap between the two 
groups and increasing the proportion planning to be vaccinated.

At this point in the survey, participants were presented with information about influenza vaccination:
  “Influenza and the “Flu” Vaccine
 – The flu is a common respiratory illness. It is spread person to person by coughs and sneezes
 – The flu causes fever, chills, cough, congestion, body aches, and fatigue.
 – The flu can cause serious illness, hospitalization, and in rare cases, death.
 – Flu vaccines are available every year before the flu season begins in the fall and everyone aged 6 months and older is recommended to get 
the vaccine.
 – Some flu vaccines are given as a shot in the arm and some are sprayed into the nose.”

At this point in the survey, participants were presented with information about the concept of herd immunity:
  “Herd Immunity
  At the beginning of the survey, we asked you to choose the definition of herd immunity.
  Herd immunity is vaccinating enough people to protect everyone and prevent outbreaks.
  If a high enough percent of the population is vaccinated, EVERYONE benefits.
  Even those who are not vaccinated will be protected from the disease.
  For each disease, the percent of people who need to be vaccinated to ensure that everyone is protected is different”.
What do you think is the minimum percent of people who need to get the flu 
vaccine to protect everyone, even those who are not vaccinated (to reach 
herd immunity and prevent outbreaks)?a
Overestimated the reported herd immunity level.

level.

At this point in the survey, participants were presented with the following information:
  “At least 70% of a population needs to get the flu vaccine to protect EVERYONE, even those who are not vaccinated.
  against the strains that match the vaccine. It is best if everyone over the age of 6 months is vaccinated”.
  “Last year, XX% of [your] county got the flu vaccine.” [The reported vaccination coverage for the country of residence was presented 
here].
