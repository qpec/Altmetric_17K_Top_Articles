ABSTRACT
Nearly all cervical cancers are causally associated with human papillo-
mavirus (HPV). The burden of HPV-associated dysplasias in sub-Saharan Africa is in-
fluenced by HIV. To investigate the role of the bacterial microbiome in cervical dys-
plasia, cytobrush samples were collected directly from cervical lesions of 144
Tanzanian women. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
and deep sequenced. Alpha diversity metrics (Chao1, PD whole tree, and operational
taxonomic unit [OTU] estimates) displayed significantly higher bacterial richness in
HIV-positive patients (P � 0.01) than in HIV-negative patients. In HIV-positive pa-
tients, there was higher bacterial richness in patients with high-grade squamous in-
traepithelial lesions (HSIL) (P � 0.13) than those without lesions. The most abundant
OTUs associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were Mycoplasma-
tales, Pseudomonadales, and Staphylococcus. We suggest that a chronic mycoplasma
infection of the cervix may contribute to HPV-dependent dysplasia by sustained in-
flammatory signals.
IMPORTANCE HPV is known to be the causal agent in the majority of cervical can-
cers. However, the role of the cervical bacterial microbiome in cervical cancer is not
clear. To investigate that possibility, we collected cervical cytobrush samples from
144 Tanzanian women and performed deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
We found that HIV-positive patients had greater bacterial richness (P � 0.01) than
HIV-negative patients. We also observed that women with high-grade squamous in-
traepithelial lesions (HSIL) had greater cervical bacterial diversity than women with
cytologically normal cervices. Data from our precise sampling of cervical lesions
leads us to propose that Mycoplasma contributes to a cervical microbiome status
that promotes HPV-related cervical lesions. These results suggest a greater influence
of the bacterial microbiota on the outcome of HPV infection than previously
thought.

uman papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent responsible for 99% of cervical
cancers (1). HPV contributes to about 4.8% of all cancers (1). The disease burden
of HPV is most dramatic in developing regions of the world, with HPV contributing to
14.2% of cancers in sub-Saharan Africa (1). Cervical cancer disproportionately affects
sub-Saharan Africa, where 9% of the world’
s female population over 15 years old
accounts for 14% of the world’
s incidence of cervical cancer and 18% of cervical
cancer-related deaths (2). The current study uses cervical swab samples obtained from
Tanzania, which has among the highest cervical cancer mortality rates by country.
Sub-Saharan Africa also has among the highest HIV rates in the world. The associ-

 ation between HIV and cervical cancer has been better studied than any other factor
associated with HPV-related cancers. HIV infection has been strongly linked to in-
creased risk of infection with HPV and the severity of HPV pathogenesis (3–5). High-risk
HPV genotypes are more prevalent in HIV-positive (HIV�) women, suggesting that HIV
infection provides an environment where these high-risk HPVs can better establish
infection and replicate (6). A likely factor in this is a decrease in T-cell surveillance, which
results in an increase in HPV replication with decreasing CD4� cell count, and other
changes in the cervical immune microenvironment as HIV infection progresses. Multiple
studies have shown an increase in HPV detection in cervical intraepithelial neoplasms
in individuals with less than 200 CD4� cells per �l of serum (7–10). Thus, the cervical
immune microenvironment may be a cofactor in suppression of cervical cancer.
Changes in the cervicovaginal bacterial microbiome have been suggested to con-
tribute to the development of precancerous cervical lesions (11–17). Chronic inflam-
mation of the cervix (cervicitis), which is a result of cervicovaginal pathogens, leads to
conditions like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and bacterial vaginosis (BV), both of
which are associated with persistent HPV infection and cervical cancer (18, 19). Both PID
and BV are more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and in HIV-positive populations
(20–22). Comparative genomic analyses in women infected with HIV have shown that
a shift in microbial diversity as a result of BV is detectable; whether this shift directly
affects formation of precancerous cervical lesions is not clear (23). Given that cervical
cancer rates are expected to rise in sub-Saharan Africa as the HIV-positive population
receives life-extending antiretroviral therapy (ART), it is even more important to un-
derstand the risk factors associated with the cervical microbiome. There are previous
studies that have analyzed how cervical microbiota differ at different stages of cervical
cytology or as a function of HIV status (24–28). The current study defines bacterial
communities associated with cervical lesions and with HIV, which represents a signif-
icant advance. Cervical cytology is graded by pap smear screening for nuclear abnor-
malities according to the Bethesda guidelines.
In this study, we utilized 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing on a set of 144 cervical
swab samples from a cohort of Tanzanian women to gain an understanding of the
differences in the cervical bacterial community composition as a function of cervical
cytology grade and HIV status. The data presented here identify bacterial taxonomies
associated with high-grade cervical lesions. In these studies, cervical lesions were
sampled directly by cytobrush, instead of cervicovaginal lavage sampling. The rationale
behind this approach was that the sites of the lesions are where tumors form, thus
bacteria associated with lesion sites are more likely to be relevant to the process of
disease progression than those associated with other regions.
RESULTS
Demographics. Of the 144 patient samples, 41 were HIV positive (HIV�) and 103
were HIV negative (HIV�), with an average patient age of 37 years old. Of these 144
samples, 134 had HPV tests and deep sequencing reads of �1,000. The frequencies of
HPV� and HPV� samples with respect to HIV status are plotted in Fig. 1A. There were
8 HIV� HPV� samples and 87 HIV� HPV� samples, but there were no HIV� HPV�
samples and 39 HIV� HPV� samples. Among HIV� samples, HPV had a statistically
significant effect (P � 0.02) on the cervical microbiome (Fig. 1B and C). Those microbes
which were enriched in HPV� samples were Bacteriodetes and fusobacteria. Also, there
was a decrease in Actinobacteria. Cervical cytology was determined to be negative for
intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) in 23 samples, low-grade squamous intra-
epithelial lesions (LSIL) in 72 samples, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(HSIL) in 50 samples. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), the standard for cervical
lesion detection in Tanzania, was carried out immediately following sample collection.
Twenty-six patients were found to be VIA positive for cervical lesions and 115 were VIA
negative. All VIA-positive samples were identified as LSIL or HSIL, while several VIA-
negative samples were found to be NILM, LSIL, or HSIL by pap smear. Odds ratios were
used to identify risk factors for testing VIA positive. Testing HIV�, HSIL, having �5

Cervical bacteria composition and richness. Samples rarefied to an even depth
(1,000 reads) were used to generate 813 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). To assess
whether the sampling depth was adequate, rarefaction curves were generated using
observed OTUs for HIV status and cervical cytology (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). Rarefaction curves for both did not converge but showed a diminishing rate
of new OTU identification as the number of reads per sample increased, implying that
sampling depth was adequate for evaluating dominant members of the cervical
bacterial community. Good’
s coverage test showed that the sequencing depth was able
to characterize 99.4% of the bacterial community on average.

 The taxonomic analysis of the reads revealed the presence of six main phyla (relative
abundance of �1%) in the cervical epithelium, regardless of HIV or cervical cytology
status (Fig. 2). Firmicutes was the predominant phylum across all sampling groups,
accounting for 41.3% of total reads. The average relative abundance of Firmicutes
decreased slightly in HIV� samples compared to HIV� samples (44.4% to 40.2%) and
varied by cervical cytology, though no obvious trend was apparent. When considering
only the HIV� samples, the relative abundance of Firmicutes appeared to decrease in
patients with cervical lesions. Firmicutes reads were primarily from the genus Lactoba-
cillus, which accounted for 21.9% of total reads. Tenericutes accounted for 1.5% of total
reads and showed a clear increase in relative abundance with increasing severity of
cervical lesions. In HIV� patients, Tenericutes increased from 0.3% of reads in NILM
patients to 1.3% in HSIL patients (Fig. 2C). In HIV� patients, the shift is larger; the
relative abundance of Tenericutes increased from 0.2% in NILM patients to 5.0% in HSIL
patients (Fig. 2D). Tenericutes reads were primarily assigned to the Mycoplasma and
Ureaplasma genera, which account for 1.1% and 0.2% of total reads, respectively.
Proteobacteria, fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria had smaller or less con-
sistent shifts in relative abundance between HIV and cervical cytology categories. The
relative abundance of Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes were significantly different between
HIV� and HIV� groups (P � 0.020 and P � 0.017, respectively). No other phyla reached
significance on the basis of HIV status or cervical cytology. Comparison of the relative
abundance of bacterial families (Fig. 3) found that Mycoplasmataceae and Prevotel-
laceae were significantly more abundant in HIV� patients (P � 0.03 and P � 0.07,
respectively). No families were found to be significantly different in abundance on the
basis of cervical cytology alone. However, when analyzed among HIV� patients,
Prevotellaceae was found to be significantly more abundant in cervical lesions (P �
0.068).

 patients than in HIV� patients (Fig. 4). A subset of these samples was matched such
that the HIV� and HIV� groups consisted of the same number of samples, with the
same average age, and the same contribution of each cervical cytology to help to
control for effects of these confounding variables and to ensure that differences in
diversity estimates are not due to differences in sample size. In this matched subset,
estimates also displayed higher (P � 0.003) bacterial richness in HIV� patients.
Alpha diversity metrics were similar (P � 0.50) for the samples from patients at
different cervical cytology grades (NILM, LSIL, or HSIL) in both matched and unmatched
sets. When alpha diversity metrics were compared between cervical cytology groups
separately for HIV� samples, LSIL and HSIL trended toward a higher diversity compared
to NILM (P � 0.198 and P � 0.261, respectively). Analysis of age-matched, HIV�
NILM/HSIL pairs maintained this trend (P � 0.264; Chao1 P � 0.13). Comparison of the
relative abundance of genus-level reads between these groups showed a noticeably
more diverse profile for HSIL samples, which lack the dominance of Lactobacillus and
Haemophilus seen in NILM samples.
Beta diversity analysis showed that bacterial communities were quite varied be-
tween samples (Fig. 5); no discrete communities characterized a large number of
samples. On average, the cervical bacterial communities of HIV-positive patients were
shown to be significantly different from the communities of HIV-negative patients (P �

 0.001). Similarly, patients who tested positive for HPV tended to have different bacterial
communities from those who tested negative for HPV (P � 0.008). Bacterial commu-
nities were also shown to differ significantly depending on cervical cytology among
HIV-positive patients (P � 0.05).
Bacteria associated with cervical cytology states and/or HIV status. Linear
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify bacterial taxonomies which
differentiate cervical microbiota in normal individuals (NILM) from microbiota in pa-
tients with precancerous lesions (HSIL). The sum of reads at each taxonomic rank was
considered. Gammaproteobacteria, s24_7, Paraprevotellaceae (nonverified taxonomy),
and Finegoldia associated with NILM cervices, while Pseudomoriadaceae, Staphylococ-
cus, and Mycoplasmatales associated with precancerous lesions. Mycoplasmatales were
dominant among Tenericutes, resulting in the significant association seen between the
phylum and cervical lesions. A distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) analysis of
bacterial communities as a function of HIV and/or cervical cytology is summarized in
Fig. S2. LEfSe was then used to compare HIV�, age-matched pairs of NILM and HSIL
patients to determine which bacteria may influence the development of lesions in
high-risk, HIV� populations. Mycoplasmatales were most strongly associated with
cervical lesions in HIV� patients, followed by Parvimonas and Streptococcus. In NILM
patients, an abundance of Lactobacillus, especially Lactobacillus iners was found, and
somewhat less significantly Finegoldia. LEfSe analysis of samples by HIV found several
bacteria to be associated with being HIV� (Fig. 6C). An abundance of non-Lactobacillus
bacilli was the most significant differentiating taxonomy between HIV-positive and
-negative samples. Mycoplasma was also associated with HIV� individuals, supporting
the significant difference in relative abundance between HIV-positive and -negative
groups shown previously using a direct Kruskal-Wallis comparison. Interestingly, Urea-
plasma (a member of Mycoplasmatales) and Lactobacillus reuteri were associated with

 HIV� patients, while other members of their respective families were associated with
HIV� patients. This suggests the existence of metabolic niches in the cervical micro-
biome which may be populated by pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria.
DISCUSSION
We found that HPV was in high abundance in the cohort (Fig. 1A). All of the patients
who were HIV positive were positive for one or more HPVs (Fig. 1A). Among the HIV�
samples, HPV was associated with at least a 10-fold increase in Bacteriodetes and
fusobacteria as well as a decrease in Actinobacteria (Fig. 1B and C). Previous studies
support the conclusion that HPV affects the microbiome (24).
Certain members of the cervicovaginal microbiome are known to protect against
infection and pathogenesis. The primary defense mechanisms of the cervicovaginal
mucosa are antimicrobial peptides, a pH of less than 4.5, and a microbiome dominated
by lactobacilli. An imbalance in these defenses can result in physiochemical changes
that produce alterations of the vaginal mucosa and cervical epithelium (27). In partic-
ular, an abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus shows an inverse relationship with de-
tectable or symptomatic HIV, HPV, or herpesvirus infection (25). This suggests that other
cervicovaginal microbes may be important in preventing or enhancing the acquisition
and pathogenesis of such infections. Microbes that are associated with enhanced
pathogenesis have largely gone unidentified or unstudied, especially in the population
most at risk, HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa.
In this study, HIV was shown to have a significant effect on the cervical microbiome,
increasing bacterial richness and decreasing beta diversity. These results are similar to
what has been reported for the cervicovaginal microbiome and suggest that changes
in the cervical epithelium microenvironment brought on by HIV exert some selective
pressure on cervical bacterial communities (24–28). Mycoplasma was significantly more
abundant in HIV-positive patients and was found to be one of the main categories of
bacteria that differentiate the cervical microbiota of HIV-positive and HIV-negative
individuals (Fig. 3). Interestingly, bacteria of the order Bacilli, of which Lactobacillus is a
member, were strongly associated with HIV-positive patients. The absence of Bacilli
reads classified as Lactobacillus among the significant factors of HIV-positive cervical
microbiota suggests that this may be due to a shift from protective to nonprotective
Bacilli in HIV� individuals. When the cohort was analyzed without taking HIV status into
account, cervical cytology did not appear to have a statistically significant association
with differences in the cervical microbiome (Fig. 4B). However, when HIV was controlled
for by separating analysis by groups of HIV-positive or HIV-negative patients only,
differences in cervical bacterial communities that varied on the basis of cervical lesion
status began to reach statistical significance (Fig. 4C). This suggests that development
of precancerous cervical lesions is associated with a certain microbiota. Among these
microbiota, Mycoplasmatales stood out as the most significant differentiator between
the cervical microbiota of a cervix with precancerous lesions from a cervix without
precancerous lesions (Fig. 6). Bacteria belonging to the order Mycoplasmatales also
showed the clearest linear increase in abundance with development of more severe
lesions in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. The most common Myco-
plasmatales to infect the urogenital tract of women are Mycoplasma genitalium and
Mycoplasma hominis. M. genitalium and M. hominis are noncommensal bacteria com-
monly associated with cervicitis, BV, PID, and HIV infection, though M. genitalium has
been much better studied (29–31). It is not well understood whether HIV promotes
mycoplasma infection or persistence of an otherwise transient infection in an HIV-
negative individual. One study found that HIV-positive women cleared M. genitalium
infections more slowly than HIV-negative women did, and the infection recurred in 39%
of the patients after clearance (32). The role of M. genitalium infection in influencing
initial infection of HIV also remains unclear; however, a strong association between the
severity of M. genitalium infection and HIV shedding from the cervix has been shown
(33). What is clear is that M. genitalium infects the epithelia, disrupting tight junctions,
and inducing a chronic inflammatory response. The potential for M. genitalium to

 influence replication of HIV suggests that host innate responses to M. genitalium
infection may influence pathogenesis of other sexually transmitted infections. Induc-
tion of HPV in this way is particularly interesting based on the association between
Mycoplasma and cervical lesions. Infection with M. genitalium increases the rate of
infection with an HPV genotype associated with a high risk of developing cervical
cancer (34). Recent work has shown that mycoplasma also increases the risk of
development of cervical lesions, supporting the association we report in this study (34).
Mycoplasma can establish persistent, intracellular infections in epithelial cells, which
may lead to bacterial vaginosis and/or cervicitis. M. genitalium has been established as
an independent, causal microbe responsible for cervicitis (35). This suggests that
Mycoplasma may act as both an intracellular and extracellular stressor, particularly if
coinfection with HPV has taken place. This interaction would most likely involve
inflammatory cytokines induced by Mycoplasma infection. Further study is needed to
determine whether the inflammatory cytokines induced by Mycoplasma infection
include cytokines that are associated with precancerous cervical lesions.
Mycoplasma is a low-abundance microbe that has been shown to cause cervicitis.
However, the lack of significant associations in previous metagenomic studies is largely
due to a lack of optimization of statistical analyses for the presence of low-abundance
microbes. In our study, Mycoplasma was a prominent result, likely due to the large
HIV-positive proportion of the cohort, wherein immunosuppression allowed higher
abundance of the bacteria to accumulate. There was a linear increase in the abundance
of Mycoplasmatales from NILM to HSIL seen in both HIV-positive and -negative groups.
In this study, we took great effort to control for variation in the cervical microbiome
so as to reduce confounding effects that might obscure the bacterial communities that
were associated with HPV pathogenesis. The HIV-positive population is of particular
interest, since they appear to show changed cervical microbiota associated with HPV
pathogenesis (Fig. 2, 3, 4, and 6). Future studies, recruiting a cohort of all HIV-positive
women with and without cervical lesions would be desirable in order to better
characterize HIV-associated microbiota which promote HPV infection and progression
to cervical cancer. Currently, few cervical microbiome cohort studies have been con-
ducted in HIV-positive populations. It is clear that variables such as diet, genetic
background, antibiotics or ART, can dramatically affect the microbiota and thus should
be carefully controlled at the point of recruitment to the study.
Longitudinal studies of the cervical microbiome are needed to understand how
microbe populations change over time, particularly in individuals with HSIL. Long-term
longitudinal studies will allow determination of early changes in the cervical microbiota
that may help predict the development of precancerous lesions. Because progression
of HPV infection to cervical cancer is a process that takes decades, and in many
individuals never reaches cancer at all, such a study would need to be large. Studies of
the cervical microbiome can be further improved using metagenomic sequencing,
rather than 16S or other targeted sequencing techniques that lack depth. 16S ampli-
fication ignores microbes that lack a gene to match the primers, for example, viruses,
archaea, and eukaryotes are not accounted for. Because only a portion of one gene is
being sequenced, the microbes present may be estimated only to the genus level or to
a higher taxonomic level. Since the majority of medium- or large-scale cervicovaginal
microbiome studies have used this method, the role of nonbacterial components of
cervicovaginal microbiome in HPV infection and disease has not been characterized.
As the world’
s HIV-positive population grows, cervical cancer is expected to become
an even more significant problem, despite increasing coverage of antiretroviral treat-
ment (ART). Compared to the risk reduction after ART seen in other AIDS-defining
cancers like Kaposi’
s sarcoma and non-Hodgkin’
s lymphoma, the risk of cervical cancer
is not significantly affected, and recurrence rates remain high with or without treatment
(36–39). Understanding microbes that influence this environment will help identify
cervical microbiota associated with low- and high-grade cervical lesions. This may allow
certain cervical microbiota to be used as diagnostic markers for those at high risk of
developing cervical cancer and for the development of preventative probiotic or

 antibiotic treatments that could control the cervical microbiome by promoting bacte-
rial colonization with a microbiota associated with healthy cervical cytology. Our
studies have identified a unique microbiota associated with HSIL. Data derived from our
precise sampling of cervical lesions lead us to propose that Mycoplasma contributes to
a cervical microbiome status that promotes HPV-related cervical lesions. These results
suggest a greater influence of the bacterial microbiota on the outcome of HPV infection
than previously thought.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and ethical precautions. This study reports findings derived from a larger cross-
sectional cohort study analyzing demographics of HPV and cervical cancer in HIV-positive and -negative
women from rural and urban Tanzania.
The cervical microbiome study participants were part of a larger ongoing study to follow HIV- and
HPV-associated cervical dysplasia in women at Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI), the only cancer
treatment hospital in Tanzania. Between March 2015 and February 2016, female patients undergoing
cervical cancer screening were approached for enrollment in the study. Those who were pregnant,
menstruating, under 18, reported being sick in the past 30 days, or had a preexisting, non-HIV,
immunologic defect were excluded from the study. Disease histories as well as physical examinations
were carried out to rule out any clinical symptoms or visible signs for these conditions. Samples were
collected at three sites in Tanzania: ORCI in Dar es Salaam and rural clinics in Chalinze and Bagamoyo.
A total of 144 cervical cytobrush samples obtained from these women were sequenced, of which 134
samples produced at least 1,000 reads and complete demographic data was available for the women. Of
these, 132 had complete HIV data and cervical cytology reads.
Demographic data collection. All study participants gave informed consent and were evaluated by
study clinicians. A set of pretested, standardized questionnaires was used to gather demographic data.
All personal identifiers were removed from samples to ensure patient confidentiality. With the permission
of the patients, medical history was retrospectively retrieved from hospital medical records. More than
30 variables were identified and assessed in the questionnaire. The current study uses only data collected
regarding age and laboratory test results (pap smears, visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA], CD4 count,
genotyping of HPV, results of serological testing for HIV-1).
Specimen collection, HIV, CD4, and pap tests. Blood samples were collected via venipuncture into
acid-citrate-dextrose tubes and processed using centrifugation at the on-site study laboratory within
6 h of being drawn. The separated plasma was tested at the ORCI, as part of standard of care, using
Standard Diagnostics HIV-1/2 3.0 detection kit and BD products CD4 FITC, CD8 PE, and CD3 Per CP
antibodies to test the CD4 counts using a BD Accuri C6 Plus. Cervical cytobrush samples and pap smears
were collected from all patients. Pap smears were examined by at least three trained cytologists and
classified according to the pap classification protocol: negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy
(NILM); atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); low-grade squamous intraepi-
thelial lesions (LSIL); atypical squamous cells but cannot exclude high-grade lesions (ASC-H); high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Cervical cytobrush specimens were placed in lysis buffer and then
shipped to the Nebraska Center for Virology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) for processing.
DNA isolation, 16S rRNA library preparation, and sequencing of the V4 region. Cervical
cytobrush samples were vortexed and separated from the brush with lysis buffer. DNA was extracted
from the lysis buffer using the Qiagen Tissue extraction kit (Dneasy) according to the manufacturer’
s
protocol. The DNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometer at 260/280 nm.
DNA was then used for tag sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. A
250-bp section of the V4 region was amplified using universal primers described in reference 40. The
PCRs were performed in 25 �l. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation of 98°
C for
3 min, followed by 25 cycles, with 1 cycle consisting of denaturation at 98°
C for 30 s, annealing at 55°
C
for 30 s, and extension at 68°
C for 45 s, and then a final elongation of 68°
C for 4 min. Following
amplification, PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel to confirm correct product size.
Normalized amplicons (1 to 2 ng/�l) from 144 samples were pooled together using an epMotion M5073
liquid handler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Pooled libraries were sequenced using the Illumina
MiSeq platform using the dual-index sequencing strategy outlined by Kozich et al. (40).
HPV genotyping. To determine HPV status, DNA samples were subjected to HPV redundant primer
using the GP5�/GP6� primer set, which detect up to 40 different mucosal HPVs (41–43). Samples found
to be HPV positive were genotyped for HR-HPVs (types 16, 18, 30, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59,
and 66) and LR-HPVs (types 6 and 11) using a low-cost multiplex PCR assay (44).
Data processing and bacterial community analysis. The sequencing data obtained from the
sequencer was subsequently analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq data analysis pipeline developed by the
Fernando lab (described in detail at https://github.com/FernandoLab). Briefly, initial quality filtering was
carried out to remove sequences that had ambiguous bases, incorrect lengths, and inaccurate assem-
blies. Subsequently, the quality-filtered reads were run through the UPARSE pipeline (http://www.drive5
.com/uparse/) and subjected to chimera filtering and OTU clustering (at a similarity threshold of 97%),
followed by the generation of an OTU table. Taxonomy was assigned to the OTUs using the assign_tax-
onomy.py command available in QIIME using the latest version of the Greengenes database (May 2013).
Statistical analyses. The OTU table was rarefied across samples to the lowest sample depth (1,000
reads) using QIIME based on the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator. All statistical

 analyses were performed with samples at an even depth. Bar charts summarizing average taxonomic
makeup of samples by HIV status and cervical cytology were constructed from the rarefied OTU table in
QIIME. Heatmaps showing the relative abundance of bacterial taxonomic families were constructed using
the “plot_ts_heatmap” command using the mctoolsR package for R. Differences in bacterial families by
HIV status or cervical cytology were evaluated using the “taxa_summary_by_sample_type”command in
mctoolsR using Kruskal-Wallis. Families with less than 1% abundance were excluded in this analysis.
Alpha diversity estimators Chao1, observed OTUs, and PD whole tree and rarefaction curves were
calculated for the overall bacterial community using QIIME. Good’
s coverage test was performed to
evaluate whether adequate sampling depth was achieved. Mean alpha diversity estimates for HIV-
positive, HIV-negative, NILM, LSIL, and HSIL groups were compared using nonparametric two-sample t
tests using Monte Carlo permutations in QIIME. The weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrix
for bacterial communities were calculated using QIIME. Even depth across samples avoided biases that
could be encountered when using the UniFrac metric (45). Bacterial community composition differences
were evaluated using the unweighted UniFrac distance matrix as an input for a distance-based redun-
dancy analysis (db-RDA) in QIIME, where HIV status, cervical cytology, and HPV status were used as main
effects. A heatmap was generated using the heatmap.2 command in the “ggplots”package for “R”using
the Bray-Curtis distance matrix to visualize relationships between samples. Significance was declared at
P � 0.1 throughout this study. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify
specific OTUs that differed HIV status and cervical cytology (46). LEfSe uses a nonparametric factorial
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test followed by a linear discriminant analysis to identify both statistically
significant and biologically relevant features. The relative abundances of the OTUs were used as input for
LEfSe. Demographic data were examined using odds ratio and an associated P value to test for factors
associated with HIV status and/or a positive VIA status. All P values are reported as FDR-corrected P
values.
Ethics statement. All human subject protocols were approved by safety committees at the Ocean
Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) and UNL in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Participation by
patients was entirely voluntary, and written patient consent was required for inclusion in the study.
