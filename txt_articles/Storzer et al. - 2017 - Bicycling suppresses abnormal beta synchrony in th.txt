Objective: Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the loco-
motion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from
freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and
contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.
Methods: We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson
disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and
high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients
(57.5 6 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.
Results: In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta
power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general.
Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around
18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.
Interpretation: These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, move-
ment leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients sus-
ceptible to freezing. Abnormal �18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and
suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.
T
he basal ganglia are a key player in the locomotor
network interacting with cortical motor, cerebellar,
and brainstem structures and consequently, gait impair-
ments are a main problem in Parkinson disease.1 It is
well known that oscillatory activity in the corticobasal
ganglia loop, especially in the beta band (13–35Hz), is
altered in Parkinson disease,2 and it has been proposed
that beta oscillations promote the maintenance of the
motor state at the expense of voluntary movement.3
Walking abilities are especially affected in patients
suffering from freezing of gait (FOG), a common phe-
nomenon in advanced Parkinson disease. FOG is defined
by the episodic inability of forward progression despite
the intention to walk.4 In addition, these patients also
show an abnormal spatiotemporal gait pattern in between

 ability to bicycle.7,8 This is puzzling with respect to our
understanding of the human motor system and strongly
suggests that, despite the similarity in their rhythm and
involved muscle groups,9 bicycling and walking may
involve cerebral structures including the basal ganglia in
different ways.
There is evidence linking FOG to the excessive syn-
chronization in the basal ganglia caused by reduced levels
of dopamine in combination with temporarily increased
motor, cognitive, or limbic load.10,11 In line with this,
abnormally synchronized basal ganglia beta band oscilla-
tions have been found in patients with FOG both during
rest12 and during walking.13 Whereas nonfreezers dis-
played the characteristic power reduction across the entire
beta band in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during
walking, oscillatory activity specifically in the low beta
band (12–22Hz) was increased in freezers.13 These find-
ings are consistent with the assumed antikinetic nature of
oscillatory beta activity. However, the question remains
how exactly this difference in movement-related beta
power changes is related to FOG. Is this difference spe-
cific to gait or is it rather a general signature of altered
basal ganglia activity that distinguishes freezers from
nonfreezers?
As no study to date has examined basal ganglia
activity during bicycling, or how it may differ from walk-
ing, potential mechanisms concerning how bicycling abil-
ities are preserved in Parkinson disease have remained
speculative. It is still not entirely clear whether the basal
ganglia are critically involved in the control of bicycling
at all, and if so, how the underlying oscillatory activity
may be modulated. Recently, our group demonstrated
that healthy adults exhibit stronger sensorimotor high
beta power (23–35Hz) suppression in bicycling than in
walking.14 We hypothesized that bicycling attenuates
pathological oscillations also within the basal ganglia of
parkinsonian patients as compared to walking. To test
this hypothesis, we recruited Parkinson patients with and
without FOG who had undergone implantation of elec-
trodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. This
approach provides the rare opportunity to record local
field potentials (LFPs) directly from the STN while initi-
ating, sustaining, and terminating pedaling on a station-
ary bicycle or walking.
Patients and Methods
Patients and Surgery
Seventeen Parkinson disease patients clinically selected for bilat-
eral DBS therapy participated in this study. One patient termi-
nated the recording after the bicycling task due to fatigue and
did not perform the walking task. One patient was inadver-
tently recorded in the medication ON state and was thus
excluded from the analysis. Data of 2 patients had to be
excluded because of severe movement artifact contamination of
all STN channels. Thus, data are presented from the remaining
13 patients (age 5 57.5 6 5.9 years, 4 female, Table). The study
was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Fac-
ulty of the Heinrich Heine University D€
usseldorf (study num-
ber 4294) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients gave their prior written informed consent.
Motor state and history of FOG were assessed preopera-
tively with part III of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale and the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q).15 Cog-
nitive and emotional states were assessed with the Mattis
Dementia Rating Scale, the Frontal Assessment Battery, and the
Becks Depression Inventory. Five patients were classified as
freezers because of a score >1 regarding the FOG-Q question
#3: “Do you feel that your feet get glued to the floor while
walking, turning or when trying to initiate walking?” Addition-
ally, we observed freezing episodes in 2 of these 5 patients dur-
ing the experiment. These episodes were excluded from the
analysis.
Surgery was performed at the Department of Stereotaxy
and
Functional
Neurosurgery
of
the
University
Hospital
D€
usseldorf as described earlier.16 Six patients (#3, 5–9) were
bilaterally implanted with a rechargeable Vercise DBS system
(model 2201, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA). Patient #11
was implanted with a Boston Scientific Vercise PC stimulator
and had segmented directional leads with 8 contacts arranged in
2 ring contacts and two 3-segment contacts (1-3-3-1, model
2202-DL). The remaining 6 patients (#12–17) were implanted
with the Infinity DBS system (model 6170, St. Jude Medical,
Saint Paul, MN), which is also equipped with segmented leads
(1-3-3-1).
Experimental Design and Procedure
Recordings took place 1 to 5 days after electrode implantation
using externalized leads. Patients were off oral dopaminergic
medication for �12 hours and off subcutaneous apomorphine
administration for � 2 hours.
Patients engaged in bicycling on a stationary bicycle sim-
ulator, over-ground walking, and the respective baseline condi-
tions, that is, sitting and standing (Fig 1). Patients started with
a 120-second baseline rest period. This was followed by repeat-
edly alternating 10 seconds of rest and 10 seconds of move-
ment. This way, 30 episodes of acoustically cued movement
initiation and termination were captured. At last, patients
engaged in 120 seconds of continuous movement. Patients
started either in the bicycling or in the walking condition with
the order of conditions being pseudorandomized and counter-
balanced across patients. For a more detailed description of the
paradigm and the bicycle simulator, see Gratkowski et al.17
Patients were instructed to bicycle and to walk at their own
comfortable cadence, as physical fitness was heterogeneous in
the patients under study. Cadence was assessed in bicycling and
walking as revolutions per minute (rpm) and strides per minute
(spm), respectively. Patients were asked to keep cadence con-
stant across conditions.

 Data Acquisition and Analysis
LFPs from the STN were recorded with a portable electroen-
cephalographic (EEG) amplifier at a sampling rate of 2,048Hz
(Porti amplifier, TMSi, Enschede, the Netherlands) using the
open source software packages OpenBCI and Svarog.18 The
portable amplifier was attached with a waist belt and a custom-
made pocket. The externalized leads were fixed with tape on
the back of the neck. In addition, EEG from a few cortical Ag/
AgCl electrodes, positioned over sensorimotor and parietal
areas, and electromyogram of bilateral leg muscles (tibialis
anterior, biceps femoris, and rectus femoris) were assessed
simultaneously. The water-based ground electrode was inte-
grated in a wristband, and LFP and EEG data were recorded
with an average reference. LFP and EEG data were re-
referenced offline with a bipolar montage consisting of adjacent
contacts in the vertical plane. This yielded 7 and 9 bipolar
channels per STN depending on the electrode model, respec-
tively. Data were obtained from 26 STNs. Two STNs were
excluded due to a malfunctional extension or connector. Two
further STNs had to be excluded because of severe movement

 artifact contamination affecting all channels. Consequently, 22
STNs were included in the analysis.
Data were analyzed with the MATLAB-based FieldTrip
toolbox19 using MATLAB R2015b (MathWorks, Natick, MA).
Analysis was focused on LFPs. First, data were bandpass filtered
offline (1–1,000Hz). Next, data were visually inspected for
movement artifacts and respective segments were excluded from
further analysis.
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS.
Power spectra were calculated for the
baseline rest condition, that is, sitting or standing for bicycling
or walking, respectively. Data were divided into 1-second seg-
ments with an overlap of 50%, and the fast Fourier transform
was calculated for each segment using a single Hanning taper.
Afterward, spectra were averaged over segments. Event-related
modulations of LFP power were analyzed by performing time-
frequency decomposition locked to movement initiation and
termination with a sliding Hanning window of 1-second length
and a step size of 0.05 seconds. Power changes were expressed
as the relative power change in decibels to the baseline rest con-
dition. The goniometer signal was used to define movement
initiation and termination in line with Storzer et al.14 Based on
visual inspection, 3.5% of the selected initiations and 5.4% of
the selected terminations had to be adapted.
CHANNEL SELECTION.
We selected 1 bipolar channel per
STN for the analysis. Based on Litvak and colleagues,20 the
channel with the strongest change of spectral power in the 13-
to 35Hz range (pooled over conditions) was selected. We veri-
fied that the corresponding channels also showed a baseline
beta peak. The selected channel was the same for all movement
conditions, to prevent channel selection from affecting the com-
parison between bicycling and walking. Due to nonfunctional
contacts in Patients #13 and #15, the contact pair 2C-4
(Patient #13) and 3B-3C (Patient #15) had to be selected. Two
bipolar channels had to be adapted due to movement artifact
contamination in 2 patients (#5 and #17). In these cases, the
next possible channel with strong beta suppression was selected
instead.
The Table lists the selected channels for each STN
together with the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates
and the probability of being within the STN. Coordinates and
the respective probabilities were determined as described by
Hirschmann and colleagues21 and based on the probability
maps of the STN derived from ultra–high-resolution 7T mag-
netic resonance images provided by Forstmann et al.22 Elec-
trode localization was not possible for 1 patient due to
movement artifacts contaminating the computed tomography.
Statistics
To assess beta power changes before and after movement initia-
tion, baseline-corrected power was averaged in the time window
from 20.5 to 1 second. Likewise, power was averaged in the
window from 0.5 to 2 seconds around movement termination.
We verified that similar results were obtained when choosing
different window sizes.
Differences in baseline-corrected power, cadence, and
baseline log power were evaluated by fitting linear mixed-effects
models using the package lme4 1.1-13 for R version 3.4.0.23 In
contrast to a conventional analysis of variance, linear mixed-
effects models account for similarity between samples, for exam-
ple, between values obtained from left and right STN of the
same patient.
In each model, the fixed effects structure was defined as
the 2-level factor movement type (bicycling or walking) and the
2-level factor patient group (freezer or nonfreezer). Additionally,
the 2-level factor frequency band (low or high beta) was
included in case the dependent variable was power. The defini-
tion of low (13–22Hz) and high beta (23–35Hz) was based on
previous studies.12,13,24 All interactions were included in the
model. Furthermore, we included the random factors patient
and STN. STN was nested in patient.
Factors were sum coded. Normality and homoscedasticity
of residuals were verified by visual inspection. Probability values

ces of acoustically cued movement initiation and termination were captured. Subsequently, patients walked or pedaled

Cadence was significantly affected by movement type
(b 5 23.89, 95% CI 5 25.65 to 22.13, v2 5 13.95,
p < 0.01), reflecting a higher cadence in walking than in
bicycling. Cadence was on average 41.21 rpm (95%
CI 5 35.93–46.50) for bicycling and 43.83 spm (95%
CI 5 38.55–49.11)

and
39.33 rpm (95% CI 5 32.65–46.01) and 52.26 spm
(95% CI 5 45.56–58.94) in freezers. Moreover, the 2-
way interaction of group and movement was significant
(b 5 2.58, 95% CI 5 0.82–4.34, v2 5 8.11, p < 0.01).
Post hoc tests confirmed that the consistent difference
between bicycling and walking was more pronounced in
patients with FOG (t ratio[11] 5 24.55, p < 0.01).
Beta Power Changes Locked to Movement
Initiation
Relative power changes locked to movement initiation
were evident in the beta band both in bicycling and in
walking for patients with and without FOG (Fig 2).
Relative beta power was on average 20.82dB (95%
CI 5 21.65 to 20.00) for bicycling and 20.59dB (95%
CI 5 21.41 to 0.24) for walking in nonfreezers and
20.58dB (95% CI 5 21.61 to 0.44) and 0.30dB (95%
CI 5 20.72 to 1.33) in freezers. The mixed model

(b 5 20.28,

bicycling than in walking irrespective of group or fre-

tion of group and frequency was significant (b 5 20.32,
95% CI 5 20.53 to 20.12, v2 5 8.99, p < 0.01; see Fig
3B). Post hoc tests revealed a significant difference
between
low
and
high
beta
power
in
freezers
(t[60] 5 2.65, p < 0.05). Whereas nonfreezers displayed a
power reduction in the whole beta band during bicycling
and walking, movement was accompanied by a selective
low beta power increase in freezers.
As depicted in Figure 2 (upper panel), the power
increase observed in freezers was due to enhancement of
a specific narrowband oscillation occurring at approxi-
mately 18Hz. It was particularly strong at movement
onset — a time at which the remaining beta band was
generally suppressed (Fig 4). Uncoupling of the 18Hz
oscillation from the remaining beta band was more pro-
nounced during walking than during bicycling (b 5 0.13,
95% CI 5 0.04–0.22, v2 5 8.62, p < 0.01).

 Beta Power Changes Locked to Movement
Termination
Time-frequency representations of LFP power locked to
movement termination showed a beta power increase rel-
ative to the baseline rest condition (beta rebound) for
both bicycling and walking in patients with and without
FOG (Fig 5). Rebound strength was affected by fre-
quency band (b 5 20.45, 95% CI 5 20.63 to 20.28,
v2 5 23.67, p < 0.01), as it predominantly involved the
high beta band. The rebound was not different between
FIGURE 4: Modulation of the �18Hz oscillation and the remaining beta band in freezers. Grand average envelopes of the
18Hz oscillation (red) and the remaining beta band (blue) for patients with freezing of gait (FOG) are shown. Local field poten-
tial (LFP) data of each subthalamic nucleus (STN) were bandpass filtered around the frequency (62Hz) showing the strongest
movement-related power increase. Next, envelopes of the filtered data were computed by taking the Hilbert transform. Enve-
lopes were filtered by a moving average filter of length 2,500 samples and correlated with the envelope of the remaining beta
band. Please note that grand average plots are plain averages across all STNs, not accounting for possible correlations within
patients. The gray boxes represent 5 of the 30 periods of movement, that is, bicycling and walking. Narrowband and broad-
band beta envelopes are uncoupled during walking but not during cycling in patients with FOG. Modulation of the �18Hz
oscillation is increased at the start and end of the movement phases.
FIGURE 3: Predictor estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the mixed model on relative beta power around movement
initiation. (A) Bicycling is accompanied by stronger beta power suppression relative to baseline than walking irrespective of
group and frequency band. (B) Superimposed on the general effect of movement type on beta power, the interaction of group
and frequency band was significant. Nonfreezers show a power reduction in the low and high beta band relative to baseline,
irrespective of the movement type. In contrast, freezers display a selective power increase in the low but not in the high beta
band, resulting in a significant difference between low and high beta power as indicated by the asterisk.

95% CI 5 20.37 to 0.41, v2 5 0.01, p 5 0.93).
Differences in Baseline Beta Power
To test the importance of movement for the observed mod-
ulations, we repeated the analysis for beta power at baseline
(sitting or standing). The interaction between patient group
and frequency band reached significance (b 5 20.46, 95%
CI5 20.91 to 20.02, v2 5 3.87, p< 0.05). Post hoc tests
were carried out between freezers and nonfreezers, but only
showed a trend for increased low beta power in freezers (t
ratio[10.09]5 22.16, p5 0.06; high-beta: t ratio[10.09]5
21.40, p5 0.19). Whether patients were standing or sit-

Discussion
We demonstrate for the first time that beta band activity
in the parkinsonian STN is modulated differently by
bicycling and walking. We found greater beta power sup-
pression in bicycling relative to walking, whereas the beta
rebound upon movement termination was equally strong.
Importantly, patients with FOG exhibited a low beta
power increase during movement — a characteristic
oscillation around 18Hz. This apparently abnormal oscil-
lation may comprise a signature of altered activity in the
motor system and susceptibility to freezing that has not
been described before.
Stronger Beta Power Suppression in Bicycling
We found bicycling to be associated with stronger sup-
pression of beta oscillations relative to walking, in line
with previous observations in the sensorimotor cortex of
healthy participants.14 Beta rebound after movement ter-
mination, however, was of similar magnitude. Thus, the
difference in beta power modulation between bicycling
and walking was specific to beta power suppression dur-
ing movement. It is not unlikely that this is a crucial
part of the physiological mechanism explaining why bicy-
cling ability is preserved in Parkinson disease and more
importantly, why bicycling has a therapeutic effect.27
Some functional differences in the cerebral net-
works
underlying
bicycling
and
walking
would
be
expected, as they differ in some aspects such as sensori-
motor input, postural control, and coordination. It
remains to be clarified which of these differences are
associated with the stronger beta power suppression. Pos-
tural control during standing is impaired in Parkinson
disease patients, with impairment and decline being
more pronounced in freezers.28,29 However, after com-
paring beta baseline power between the different move-
ment
conditions,

difference was found. Consequently, stronger beta power
suppression during bicycling is not likely to be due to
reduced need for postural control.
A key difference could be the more continuous
nature of bicycling, which is associated with persistent
tactile feedback to both feet and lacks the stationary

frequency plots show power changes locked to movement termination (t 5 0) in freezers (9 subthalamic nuclei [STNs]) and non-
freezers (13 STNs) for bicycling and walking. Please note that grand average plots are plain averages across all STNs, not

 phases that are part of walking. Thus, the likelihood of
the subsequent movement is higher in bicycling, which
has been related to beta power suppression.30 Further-
more, leg movements in bicycling have fewer degrees of
freedom due to the fixed pedal trajectory, regardless of
the exact foot placement. In consequence, the limb
movements required for bicycling are less complex than
for walking and could impose a lower computational
load on the motor system. In line with this interpreta-
tion, a previous study of our group found stronger gait
phase-dependent power modulations in walking com-
pared to bicycling in the sensorimotor cortex of healthy
participants,14 which could be indicative of a reduced
demand for cortical monitoring of ongoing movement.
Low Beta Power Increase in Patients with FOG
In line with a previous report by Singh and colleagues,13
freezers showed increased low beta power during move-
ment. More specifically, patients with FOG displayed an
abnormal �18Hz oscillation in the STN that was not
present in Parkinson disease patients without FOG.
From where might this oscillation originate and what are
its implications?
FUNCTIONAL ROLE.
Due to its predominance in the
OFF medication state and its corresponding reduction by
both medication and DBS,24,31 the lower beta range is
assumed to be particularly associated with antikinetic
symptoms. Thus, the �18Hz oscillation might reflect a
movement-inhibiting
signal
throughout
the
motor
network.
At the descriptive level, this altered oscillatory activ-
ity in freezers was intensified during walking. However, a
specific difference between bicycling and walking in
freezers could not be confirmed statistically. Although
this might be due to small subgroup sample sizes, the
current data point to a small effect, if any, which might
be difficult to detect even with larger samples. Alterna-
tively, the 18Hz oscillation might be a general signature
of altered basal ganglia activity that distinguishes freezers
from nonfreezers irrespective of the motor state. The
interaction between frequency band and patient group
regarding beta baseline power supports this interpreta-
tion, as it indicates a difference between patient groups
even at rest.
As the low beta power increase was seen irrespective
of actual freezing episodes, it likely reflects a predisposi-
tion to freeze. It might be boosted by interference in the
corticobasal ganglia loops due to additional response con-
flict or motor, cognitive, or limbic load, thereby trigger-
ing a freezing episode.10,11
ANATOMICAL ORIGIN.
Interestingly, phase synchroni-
zation in the beta band over the left prefrontal area was
found to be associated with increased susceptibility to
upper limb freezing.32 The STN receives direct cortical
projections from frontal areas via the hyperdirect path-
way,33 which is assumed to mediate a top-down stopping
signal.34 Thus, an excessive cortically driven inhibitory
signal might manifest as an abnormal �18Hz oscillation
in the STN of freezing patients. Alternatively, the
�18Hz oscillation might emerge from the interaction
between STN and GPe35 or originate in the striatum due
to increased levels of cholinergic drive as a consequence
of dopamine depletion.36 Results of a recent study ana-
lyzing functional interactions between the STN, motor
cortex, and pedunculopontine nucleus during walking in
hemiparkinsonian rats suggest the STN proper as a
potential source of increased beta oscillations at around
18Hz.37
POWER INCREASE OR FREQUENCY SHIFT?
Changes
in baseline-corrected power, such as the 18Hz power
increase reported here, can sometimes be a consequence
of a movement-related shift in peak frequency.38,39
Although we observed a clear shift in 1 of the 5 patients
with FOG in non–baseline-corrected power (data not
shown), a specific power increase at 18Hz without a clear
shift was observed in the remaining patients. Due to the
limited sample size, we cannot definitively say which of
the 2 patterns may best represent freezers in general. Fur-
ther research is needed to clarify this issue.
WHY ARE FREEZERS ABLE TO BICYCLE?
Our pre-
sent results add substantially to the clarification of this
question by providing electrophysiological correlates of
the
risk
of
freezing
and
demonstrating
differences
between bicycling and walking. We found that bicycling
suppresses broadband beta power. Hence, the effect of
bicycling is reminiscent of the therapeutic effects of DBS
and medication.31,40–42 We explain the comparably low
level of beta power during bicycling by a comparably low
computational load on the motor system. This low load
may decrease the risk of interference between the parallel
but separated corticobasal ganglia loops, and thus the
risk of freezing.10,11 If the movement sequence is made
more complex, for example, by uncoupling the pedals of
the bike, the load is increased and patients with FOG
show irregular pedaling patterns with the return of inter-
mittent cessations.43 Likewise, freezing was found to be
partially alleviated by using a “walk-bicycle,” that is, a
bicycle without pedals and with a low seat.44 Locomotion
with the walk-bicycle still requires alternating stepping
movements of the legs but reduces the need for postural
control and lateral weight shifts that were shown to be
599
 abnormally coupled in patients with FOG.45 In sum-
mary, we suggest that bicycling ability remains unaffected
in most patients because it has a lower computational
load on motor networks.7,8
Methodological Considerations
A methodological challenge in LFP studies on different
types of movements lies in movement-related artifacts.
We carefully inspected our data and excluded heavily
contaminated
data.
Nevertheless,
movement
artifacts
remained in our data to some extent, particularly in the
walking condition. However, these artifacts were found
to be restricted to lower frequencies <10Hz, and thus,
could not influence the presented results in the beta fre-
quency band.
The
limited
availability
of
suitable
patients
restricted
subgroup
sample
sizes,
lowering
statistical
power, and the investigated cohort represents Parkinson
disease patients selected for DBS therapy rather than the
general patient population. Nevertheless, our data are in
line with previous research13 and provide a promising
basis for future studies. Such work should characterize
the 18Hz oscillation further, for example, by investigat-
ing possible modulations during actual freezing episodes,
and should include a representative number of patients
with and without FOG, allowing for statistical testing
also with regard to different types of FOG. Finally,
patients were identified as freezers according to the
FOG-Q. Future studies should include an objective
examination of FOG and include only patients with defi-
nite acute FOG.46
Conclusion
Our study provides important first evidence for differ-
ences between bicycling and walking in the oscillatory
activity of the STN in Parkinson disease patients. Our
results indicate that bicycling is accompanied by a stron-
ger movement-related suppression of pathological beta
oscillations compared to walking, with an influence on
STN beta rhythms reminiscent of the effects of DBS.
Furthermore, freezers exhibited a selective, prolonged,
distinct, and narrowband beta oscillation locked to the
initiation of movement at �18Hz. This oscillation was
seen irrespective of actual freezing episodes, and was
descriptively weaker and rather brief in duration upon
initiation of bicycling, signifying that it likely reflects sus-
ceptibility to freezing. Bicycling facilitates suppression of
overall beta power, and we speculate that, due to its con-
tinuous nature, it is computationally less demanding
than walking and thus less prone to overloading the net-
works involved in locomotion.
