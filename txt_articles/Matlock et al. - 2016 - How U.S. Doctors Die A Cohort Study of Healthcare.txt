OBJECTIVES: To compare healthcare use in the last
months of life between physicians and nonphysicians in
the United States.
DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service
Medicare
beneficiaries:
decedent physicians (n = 9,947) and a random sample of
Medicare decedents (n = 192,006).
MEASUREMENTS: Medicare Part A claims data from
2008 to 2010 were used to measure days in the hospital and
proportion using hospice in the last 6 months of life as pri-
mary outcome measures adjusted for sociodemographic
characteristics and regional variations in health care.
RESULTS: Inpatient hospital use in the last 6 months of
life was no different between physicians and nonphysi-
cians, although more physicians used hospice and for
longer (using the hospital: odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 0.93–1.04; hospital days: mean
difference

P = .14);

pice: mean difference 2.06, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: This retrospective, observational study is
subject to unmeasured confounders and variation in coding
practices, but it provides preliminary evidence of actual
use. U.S. physicians were more likely to use hospice and
ICU- or CCU-level care. Hospitalization rates were similar.

Key words: end of life; hospice; physicians; Medicare
T
he public, clinicians, and policy-makers alike have
become increasingly concerned about rising healthcare
use at the end of life.1–4 One-quarter of all Medicare
spending occurs in the last year of life, a finding consistent
over decades. For Medicare beneficiaries, this use can be
more than twice as much depending simply on where in
the country one lives.5 This has raised concerns that many
of the interventions provided near the end of life may be
of little value.6–10 Worse, higher spending in the last
week of life has been associated with poorer quality of
death,11 and many interventions may be discordant with
the individual’s preferences.12
Recent publications have highlighted these persistent
gaps in care for persons with life-limiting illness.13,14
These gaps include lack of prognostic understanding and a
failure to address care goals and preferences. Many believe
that, when doctors are patients, they may die differently
than the rest of society. In 2011, Dr. Ken Murray pub-
lished an essay describing his physician colleague’s decision
to opt for comfort-based care over chemotherapy for his
incurable cancer.15 The current medical literature supports
the hypothesis that doctors may die differently than non-
doctors. When physicians are surveyed, they overwhelm-
ingly opt for a nonaggressive, comfort-based approach to
care in the face of life-limiting illness.16 Physicians are also
more likely to have completed an advance directive docu-
menting care preferences than the general population.17 It
is
not
known
whether
actual
healthcare
use
differs
between physicians and nonphysicians at the end of life.
Because physicians are intimately familiar with the
healthcare arena, they are uniquely aware of potential ben-
efits and limitations of modern medicine. Their medical
knowledge allows for a better understanding of prognosis.
As a consequence, it was hypothesized that physicians
would approach their own death and dying differently

 than someone without the same level of understanding and
experience. The objective of this study was to compare the
actual use patterns of physician and nonphysician dece-
dents at the end of life.
METHODS
Study Overview
The goal was to compare healthcare use in the last
6 months of life of physicians and nonphysicians. This ret-
rospective observational cohort study involved Medicare
decedents with validated death dates between July 2008
and December 2010. It was hypothesized that physicians
would use fewer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) ser-
vices and more hospice care in the last 6 months of life
than nonphysician decedents. The Colorado multi-institu-
tional review board deemed this study exempt.
Data Sources
Identification of Nonphysician Decedents
The study sample of nonphysician decedents was randomly
drawn from the Medicare Enrollment Database, which
includes monthly indicators of whether beneficiaries are
enrolled in fee-for-service or Medicare advantage plans, as
well as demographic information including dates of birth
and death, sex, race and ethnicity, and residential ZIP
codes. Medicare decedents younger than 65 or with man-
aged care coverage during the study period were excluded.
There was no overlap between the sample of physician
decedents and nonphysician decedents.
Identification of Physician Decedents
The American Medical Association (AMA) maintains a
Physician Masterfile on U.S. physicians dating back to the
early 1900s. This data file includes physician name, death
date, and last known mailing or office address. A Medicare-
contracted third party (Buccaneer: A General Dynamics
Company, Fairfax, VA) matched physician decedents—
identified with data from the AMA Physician Masterfile—to
the Medicare inpatient, skilled nursing facility, and hospice
claims data from 2008 to 2010 by developing a multistep
algorithm to maximize accuracy of matching. All subjects
under 65 years of age or with health maintenance organiza-
tion enrollment within the study period were excluded.
For the subgroup analysis of physician decedents
according to specialty, the 259 specialty designations were
grouped
into
18
general
categories
(Supplementary
Appendix S1).
Usage Outcomes
The
Medicare
inpatient
and
hospice
claims
for
the
6 months before decedent’s date of death were used to
determine usage.
Inpatient Care
The concept of inpatient care was operationalized to
include rates of hospital and ICU use (the proportion of
subjects hospitalized or cared for in the ICU in the last
6 months and 1 month of life) and mean total days in the
hospital (primary outcome) and ICU in the last 6 months
and 1 month of life. The proportions of physicians and
nonphysicians dying in the hospital were also examined.
ICU use was defined using the inpatient base claims
and revenue center files. Because admit and discharge ICU
dates were unavailable in the Medicare data set, ICU use
was defined using a combination of hospital stays from the
inpatient base claims and revenue codes from the revenue
center files. Specifically, ICU length of stay was defined as
the sum of the revenue center unit count for hospital stays
with revenue code 020x, according to the intensive care
day count definition from the data dictionary provided by
the research data assistance center for the Medicare Provi-
der Analysis and Review file.
Hospice Care
Hospice use in the last 6 months of life was examined
using several different methods: overall enrollment rates in
hospice care (primary outcome), length of stay in hospice,
and hospice use within 3 and 7 days of death. Hospice
enrollment within 3 and 7 days of death have been identi-
fied
as
potential
measures
of
poor-quality
end-of-life
care.18
Covariates
All covariates for the adjusted analysis were selected a priori
to account for factors known to be associated with varia-
tions in care at the end of life. Sociodemographic informa-
tion available from the Medicare claims includes birth date,
sex, and race and ethnicity. Socioeconomic status was oper-
ationalized as median annual household income calculated
based on 2010 U.S. Census ZIP code data.19 Dual eligibility
—eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid—was further
adjusted for because it is also associated with lower socioe-
conomic status. (Mean household income was $50,528 for
dually eligible beneficiaries and $57,441 for non-dually eli-
gible beneficiaries.) The effect of comorbidities was adjusted
for using the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index based
on diagnoses in the Medicare claims during the final
6 months of life.20 To account for regional variations in
health care at the end of life, decedents were linked to their
hospital referral region (HRR) using ZIP code. HRRs are
regions defined by the Dartmouth Atlas based on referral
patterns for tertiary care.5 A measure of supply (number of
acute care hospital beds per 1,000 residents in 2006) and a
measure of practice (the hospital care intensity index, a
standardized regional composite measure that incorporates
the numbers of days individuals spend in the hospital and
the number of physician encounters during the hospitaliza-
tion measured as a ratio compared to the national average,
in 2010) was included for each HRR.21
Analysis
Characteristics of the study sample were described using
means and standard deviations for continuous variables
and numbers and percentages for categorical variables and
then compared for physicians and nonphysicians using t-

 tests or chi-square tests as appropriate. Differences in mea-
sures for hospital and hospice use between physicians and
nonphysicians were first tested using t-tests for continuous
measures and chi-square tests for dichotomous measures.
Differences between medical subspecialties for the two pri-
mary measures were also investigated by comparing one
group
with
all
other
subspecialty
fields.
Differences
between physicians and nonphysicians were further tested
using linear or logistic regression, adjusting for other
covariates. Differences between physicians and nonphysi-
cians stratified according to age group (<75, 75–84, ≥85)
and according to the interaction between age group and
cohort (physician vs nonphysician) in the regression mod-
els were examined for the primary measures to determine
whether the differences were consistent across age groups.
Significance was defined as P < .05 (or 95% confidence).
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Sample
The AMA Physician Masterfile contained 15,635 deceased
physicians aged 65 and older between 2008 and 2010; it
was possible to uniquely match 14,334 beneficiaries, yield-
ing a 92% match rate. The final cohort comprised 9,947
physician decedents (Figure 1) and a random sample of
192,006 nonphysician decedents with a verified death date
between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, not cov-
ered by a health maintenance organization. Characteristics
of the sample cohort are found in Table 1.
Hospital Use
After excluding 613 subjects whose death dates preceded
their inpatient discharge dates, the cohort consisted of
9,914 physicians and 191,426 nonphysicians. In the last
6 months and 1 month of life, a smaller proportion of
physicians than of nonphysicians had at least one hospital-
ization (66.6% vs 69.5%, P < .001; 50.1% vs 52.5%,
P < .001, respectively). After adjusting for covariates, the

 difference was not statistically significant for the last
6 months (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.96, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) = 0.91–1.01) but was statistically sig-
nificant for the last 1 month of life (aOR = 0.91; 95%
CI = 0.87–0.96). The mean number of days spent in the
hospital in the last 6 months and 1 month of life was
nearly identical for physician and nonphysician decedents
(12.2 vs 12.4, P = .28; 5.3 vs 5.3, P = .87, respectively),
also with no significant differences after adjustment. There
were no significant differences between the proportions of
physicians and nonphysicians who died in the hospital
(25.3% vs 25.9%, P = .18), including after adjustment
(Table 2).
In the last 6 months and 1 month of life, the propor-
tion of physicians and nonphysicians having at least one
ICU stay were essentially equivalent (34.6% vs 34.3%,
P = .45; 25.6% vs 25.0%, P = .18, respectively). The dif-
ferences remained nonsignificant with adjustment. The
mean number of days spent in the ICU in the last 6 months
and 1 month of life was slightly greater for physicians than
nonphysician decedents (3.1 vs 2.8, P < .001; 1.7 vs 1.5,
P < .001 respectively). These clinically modest differences
remained after adjustment (Table 2).
Hospice Use
Nineteen subjects whose death dates preceded their hospice
start or discharge dates were removed from the cohort
described in Table 1, resulting in 9,947 physicians and
191,987 nonphysicians. For the outcome of any hospice use,
46.4% of physicians and 43.2% of nonphysicians had
enrolled in hospice care for some amount of time during the
last 6 months of life (P < .001). These differences remained
significant after adjusting for covariates (aOR = 1.21, 95%
CI = 1.16–1.27). Unadjusted, the mean number of days in
hospice care was approximately the same for physicians and
nonphysicians (19.4 vs 19.3, P = .88), although in the
adjusted analysis, physicians used hospice on average
2.44 days more than nonphysicians (P < .001). Finally, the
proportion of physicians using hospice 3 days before death
was significantly different from that of nonphysicians (8.1%
vs 7.5%, P = .03), although this was not statistically signifi-
cant after adjustment. The proportion of physicians using
hospice within 7 days of death was slightly greater than that
of nonphysicians (16.8% vs 15.0%, P < .001). The differ-
ences remained significant after adjustment (aOR = 1.08,
95% CI = 1.02–1.14) (Table 2).

 Age Stratification
In the age-stratified analyses for the two primary out-
comes, the small differences between physician and non-
physician decedents were seen only in the older age groups
(Table 3). Adjusting for covariates, the difference between
physicians and nonphysicians was not significantly differ-
ent in any of the age groups.
By Specialty
Use according to medical subspecialty for the primary
measures was similar. Psychiatry appeared to have the
lowest hospice use (39% vs 47%, P < .001), and adult
medical subspecialty appeared to have higher hospital use
(13.9 vs 12.3 mean number of days, P = .04) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
It was hypothesized that doctors would have lower use of
hospital and ICU services and higher use of hospice ser-
vices. The findings, in contrast, were mixed. Physicians
were more likely to use hospice. With a mean number of
hospice days of 20, a 2.4-day-longer stay could be consid-
ered a moderately important clinical difference. In con-
trast, physicians were slightly more likely to use the ICU.
Taken together, these results suggest that physician dece-
dents use slightly more resources in general.
Based on prior survey research of physician attitudes
toward end-of-life care, it was expected that physicians
would have less use of high-intensity hospital-based care at
the end of life.16,17,22,23 First, it was expected that their
knowledge of medicine and its limitations would be evi-
dent in their avoidance of high-intensity end-of-life care.
Nonphysicians tend to overestimate the benefits of treat-
ments, believing, for example, that chemotherapy for Stage
IV cancer is curative24 and that cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion has a high success rate.25 These are the kinds of mis-
perceptions that can lead to greater use of hospital and
ICU services. Second, it was hypothesized that physicians
would ensure that the care they received was congruent
with their preferences. A power differential exists in the
traditional physician–patient relationship, often causing
individuals to defer to their physicians for fear of being
labeled “difficult.”26 It was thought that this power differ-
ential would not exist in physician-patients, allowing them
to more comfortably exert their preferences. Finally, the
practice of medicine often exists at the interface between
life and death. As such, it was thought that physicians
might have a higher level of death acceptance (and thus
lower use of hospitalization and ICU services) than a pop-
ulation of people who did not have the same familiarity
with death and dying.
Why might the findings conflict with the prior evi-
dence that demonstrates physician preferences for less-
aggressive care? It could be generational; the average age
of physician decedents in the sample was 83. Many of
these physicians trained and practiced medicine at a time
before hospice or palliative care and before many of the
technological advances in intensive care. Thus, the burdens
of highly aggressive care at the end of life may be more
apparent to younger generations of physicians, but the fact
that the modest differences between physicians and non-
physicians were concentrated in the oldest cohort argues

 against a generational argument. Decedents aged 65 to 74
had no difference in use across all care settings. Ultimately,
testing a generational theory would require a repeat of the
present study 30 years from now. Second, fear and avoid-
ance of dying are strong motivators of much of human
behavior,27 and perhaps physicians are not immune to
these fears of dying.
The most troubling potential explanation for the find-
ings is that higher-level healthcare system factors affect
end-of-life care independent of patient or clinician factors.
Future qualitative research using an organizational per-
spective should explore the details of the experiences of
physicians and their families as they encounter the health-
care system near the time of their death. This presumably
empowered and informed population may be able to pro-
vide unique insights into the degree and mechanisms by
which the culture and the system influence care at the end
of life. The recent Institute of Medicine report highlights
the limitations of the fee-for-service Medicare reimburse-
ment structure that provides incentives for procedures
while providing little to no coverage for the supportive ser-
vices patients and families commonly need to provide
high-quality care outside of the hospital.14 Thus, the sys-
tem has evolved to favor hospital-based interventions that
may offer less value during a person’s final months.
This study has several limitations. First, because it was
a retrospective, observational study, there may be unmea-
sured confounders. It was not possible to adjust for indi-
vidual education and income. To address this concern,
median income within a ZIP code and dual eligibility,
which captures some aspects of socioeconomic status and
is a proxy for education and income, were adjusted for.
Second, this analysis is based on administrative data, and
coding of claims varies geographically,28 although the lack
of regional differences after adjusting for hospital care
intensity suggests that diagnostic coding variation was not
an important limitation. Third, Medicare Advantage is
excluded from this analysis; it could be that the physicians
likely to choose less-aggressive care are also more likely to
enroll in a Medicare Advantage program, and by limiting
to
fee-for-service
enrollees,
more
aggressively
minded
physicians may have been selected for. Fourth, the sample
of physician decedents was largely Caucasian men, repre-
senting the unfortunate reality that previous generations of
physicians in the United States were mostly Caucasian
men. Finally, use is only a proxy for what we truly care
about—whether patients actually received medical services
that were concordant with their well-informed goals and
values.
Many believe that doctors in the United States die dif-
ferently from the rest of society. Since the 2011 publica-
tion of Dr. Murray’s essay,15 the media has focused on
this idea that doctors forgo aggressive care in favor of care
that focuses on quality of life and comfort. Notable exam-
ples include a Radiolab story on National Public Radio29
and a New York Times article,30 both reporting that
physicians die differently. Even the Institute of Medicine
referred to the idea that doctors die differently in its report
Dying in America.14 The current findings suggest a more-
mixed and -nuanced picture. Doctors may be more likely
to die using hospice, but they are no less likely to use
high-intensity hospital care. If anything, they have higher
rates of ICU use in the last 6 months of life. Society as a
whole and policy-makers focused on containing healthcare
costs in particular may be surprised to learn that even
physicians, with knowledge of and experience with death
and dying, have use of hospitals nearly identical to that of
nonphysicians.
