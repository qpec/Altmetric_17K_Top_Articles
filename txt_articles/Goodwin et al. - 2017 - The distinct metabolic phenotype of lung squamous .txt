Adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) are the two predominant
subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are distinct in their histological,
molecular and clinical presentation. However, metabolic signatures specific to individual
NSCLC subtypes remain unknown. Here, we perform an integrative analysis of human NSCLC
tumour samples, patient-derived xenografts, murine model of NSCLC, NSCLC cell lines and
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and reveal a markedly elevated expression of the GLUT1
glucose transporter in lung SqCC, which augments glucose uptake and glycolytic flux. We
show that a critical reliance on glycolysis renders lung SqCC vulnerable to glycolytic inhibi-
tion, while lung ADC exhibits significant glucose independence. Clinically, elevated GLUT1-
mediated glycolysis in lung SqCC strongly correlates with high 18F-FDG uptake and poor
prognosis. This previously undescribed metabolic heterogeneity of NSCLC subtypes impli-
cates significant potential for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and targeted ther-
apeutic strategies for lung SqCC, a cancer for which existing therapeutic options are clinically
insufficient.

verall, 80–85% of all human lung cancers are non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the majority of NSCLC
comprises two major histological subtypes: adenocarci-
noma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC)1. SqCC
accounts for 25–30% of all lung cancers. Five-year survival rates
among advanced SqCC patients being treated with current
chemotherapeutic regimens is less than 5% (ref. 2). Although
ADC
has
benefited
the
most
from
molecularly
targeted
therapies3, to date, few achievements in the development of a
targeted therapy for SqCC have been made, resulting in the use of
platinum-based chemotherapy remaining the first-line treatment
for decades4. The recent FDA approval of Necitumumab in
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line
treatment for metastatic SqCC has generated positive, albeit
limited clinical impact5,6.
Aerobic glycolysis has been implicated in tumour growth and
survival, contributing to cellular energy supply, macromolecular
biosynthesis and redox homeostasis7,8. Despite recent advances in
our understanding of the metabolic differences between cancer
and
normal
cells,
tumour-type-dependent
metabolic
heterogeneity is still largely unknown9. In particular, the
differential usage of metabolic pathways in NSCLC subtypes
has not been addressed outside clinical observations10–15, and
detailed
functional
studies
have
not
been
performed
in
representative preclinical models.
The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is a facilitative membrane
glucose transporter16. Among 14 GLUT family members, GLUT1
is the most frequently implicated in human cancers and is
responsible for augmented glucose uptake and metabolism17.
Several oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-Myc, have been
shown to directly regulate GLUT1 mRNA expression in human
cancers18. Aberrant activation of growth factor or oncogenic
signalling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, enhances GLUT1 activity
via increased membrane trafficking19,20. In addition to these cell-
autonomous,
intrinsic
pathways,
GLUT1
expression
is
profoundly regulated by tumour microenvironmental effectors.
For example, hypoxia induces GLUT1 expression via the
transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). In
addition, the selective acquisition of KRAS or BRAF mutations in
response to glucose deprivation has been shown to upregulate
GLUT1 expression21,22. Elevated GLUT1 expression is clinically
relevant to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with
the use of 18fluro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) for initial diagnosis
as well as prognostic evaluation of NSCLC23.
In this study, we sought to identify the lung SqCC-specific core
metabolic signature by integrating multifactorial experimental
approaches. We show that GLUT1 is remarkably and uniquely
elevated at both the mRNA and protein levels in SqCC as the
principal cellular glucose transporter, but is minimally expressed
in ADC. Elevated GLUT1 expression in SqCC is associated with

 enhanced glucose and 18F-FDG uptake and cellular glucose
metabolism, suggesting substantial heterogeneity of glucose
dependence and usage between SqCC and ADC. We further
demonstrate that SqCC is more susceptible to glucose deprivation
than ADC. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic flux
via non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG)
and GLUT1-specific inhibitor, WZB117, selectively suppresses
tumour growth in SqCC, whereas ADC is significantly resistant to
glycolytic inhibition. These observations suggest that the reliance
of SqCC on GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake and metabolism
can be exploited for the development of targeted therapeutic
strategies for SqCC.
Results
TCGA analyses reveal that GLUT1 is elevated in lung SqCC. To
uncover the SqCC-specific
gene expression
profile
among
NSCLC, we unbiasedly analysed differential gene expression
between SqCC and ADC patient tumour samples utilizing The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database24. Analysis of the
mRNA-sequencing gene expression profiles from 501 SqCC and
517 ADC patient tumour samples identified a set of differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) between the two NSCLC subtypes
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Among enriched DEGs, this analysis
identified that the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is among
the most significant DEG elevated in SqCC (410-fold median
increased expression compared to ADC) along with genes
associated with squamous differentiation (for example, KRTs,
PKP1, DSP, SFN and JUP) and extracellular matrix (for example,
COL1A1 and COL3A1)25 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). We
further examined the mRNA expression of all other 13 GLUT
family members and verified that, although other GLUT family
member mRNAs (for example, GLUT3) are expressed, GLUT1 is,
by far, the most significantly expressed glucose transporter in
SqCC patients (Fig. 1b). We also observed a robust correlation
between GLUT1 mRNA expression and the mRNA expression of
p63, cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and cytokeratin 6A, the most commonly
employed
clinical
biomarkers
in
distinguishing
SqCC26
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). Notably, no correlation of GLUT1
expression with proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA in the
TCGA cohort of SqCC was found (Supplementary Fig. 2c),
suggesting that high GLUT1 expression is not reflective of high
cellular proliferation but is phenotypically associated with SqCC.
Collectively, these TCGA analyses provide evidence that GLUT1
overexpression is specifically linked to the SqCC subtype.
Elevated GLUT1 expression in human lung SqCC. To validate
specific upregulation of GLUT1 in human SqCC, we analysed
GLUT1 expression in human SqCC (tumour, n ¼ 21; normal,
n ¼ 19) and ADC (tumour, n ¼ 15; normal, n ¼ 15) tumour
tissue samples (Supplementary Table 1). The GLUT1 immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) score (multiplication of the intensity score
by positive area score, Supplementary Fig. 3) was significantly
higher
in
SqCC
than
in
ADC
(Fig.
1c,d).
Consistently, human SqCC tumours have significantly higher
GLUT1 mRNA expression than ADC (Fig. 1e). No significant
increase was observed in ADC compared to paired normal lung
tissues (Fig. 1e), suggesting that GLUT1 expression is specifically
elevated in SqCC.
To further determine whether GLUT1 expression is specifically
elevated in human SqCC, we measured GLUT1 levels in tissue
microarrays of lung cancer patients. We found that GLUT1
expression is predominantly confined to SqCC patients (79%,
27/34), with little to no expression observed in the various
non-squamous subtypes (21%, 6/28; Fig. 1f). This was quantita-
tively associated with a greater than threefold increase of
GLUT1-positive area in SqCC compared to ADC (Fig. 1f).
Consistent with TGCA data analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2b), we
found a significant correlation between GLUT1 and p63/CK5
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b), indicating that elevated GLUT1
expression is specific to SqCC across a wide selection of lung
cancer patients as opposed to other NSCLC subtypes.
We further validated differential expression of GLUT1 within
human NSCLC using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model27.
Immunohistochemical analysis of GLUT1 expression across an
array of SqCC (n ¼ 7) and ADC (n ¼ 9) PDX samples revealed
significantly elevated GLUT1 expression in SqCC PDX tumours
compared to ADC PDX tumours (Fig. 1g and Supplementary
Table 2). SqCC PDX tumours showed high levels of relatively
homogeneous GLUT1 expression (Po0.001, two-tailed t-test). In
contrast, GLUT1 expression was strictly confined adjacent to
severely necrotic areas in ADC PDX tumours indicative of
hypoxic induction of GLUT1. Notably, despite the fact that most
ADC PDX tumours were established from highly advanced
metastatic patients (Supplementary Table 2) because of the
relatively low PDX success rate of early-stage ADC tumours,
GLUT1 expression is negligible in ADC PDX tumours. Taken
together, these data provide strong evidence of the heterogeneous
expression of GLUT1 in NSCLC and its specific overexpression in
SqCC as the principal glucose transporter.
Lung SqCC-specific GLUT1 expression in NSCLC animal model.
Next, we sought to determine whether GLUT1 expression could
differentiate SqCC from other various pulmonary neoplasia in the
KrasG12D; Lkb1-null (KL) mouse model of NSCLC. The KL mice, in
which oncogenic mutant Kras, KrasG12D, is expressed and tumour
suppressor Lkb1 is deleted upon intratracheal inhalation of ade-
novirus-Cre, exhibit a full spectrum of NSCLC subtypes, allowing
the characterization of different tumour types within the same
mouse25,28,29 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The majority of tumours
that develop in KL mice can be histopathologically identified as
ADC (B45%) and SqCC (B25%), the two most frequently
observed NSCLC phenotypes in humans (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Immunohistochemical staining on serial sections of KL tumours
revealed that GLUT1 is exclusively expressed in SqCC tumours
determined by co-localization with diagnostic markers such as p63
(Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 5c). In contrast, no detectable levels
of GLUT1 were found in TTF-1-positive ADC tumours (Fig. 1h).
Accordingly, we found a strong correlation between GLUT1 levels
and
squamous
marker
p63
in
individual
KL
tumours
(Supplementary Fig. 5d). To exclude the possibility of a distinct
subset of KL ADC that may express p63, we further validated SqCC
or ADC subtypes in KL tumours by double-staining with two SqCC
markers, p63 and CK5, as well as a combination of SqCC and ADC
markers, CK5 and TTF-1. In all KL tumours we examined, p63 and
CK5 were co-localized in SqCC tumours, whereas TTF-1-
expressing tumours (ADC) were negative for SqCC marker CK5
expression and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Taken together,
these data demonstrate that GLUT1 expression is markedly and
specifically elevated in murine SqCC tumours.
Elevated GLUT1 and glucose uptake in lung SqCC cell lines.
We next asked whether NSCLC cell lines retain differential
GLUT1 expression to clinical and animal model tissues. Across a
panel of NSCLC cell lines, the majority of SqCC cell lines express
7–15-fold higher levels of GLUT1 mRNA as compared to ADC
cell lines (Fig. 2a), which closely correlates with GLUT1 protein
levels (Fig. 2b). We focused our further in vitro and in vivo studies
to four cell lines, SqCC cell lines HCC95 and HCC1588, and ADC
cell lines A549 and H522, after validating their expression of p63
and CK5 (Supplementary Fig. 6a), indicating that these cell lines

 conserved their in situ specific phenotype. Consistent with TCGA
data, GLUT1 is predominantly expressed in SqCC cell lines
compared to other GLUT family members (Supplementary
Fig. 6b). We further validated membrane localization of GLUT1
in these cells19,20. Immunocytochemical staining showed GLUT1
concentrated at the plasma membrane in SqCC cell lines (Fig. 2c).
Quantification of GLUT1 fluorescence intensity was three- to
fourfold higher in SqCC cell lines as compared to ADC cell lines
(Fig. 2c). Fluorescent glucose uptake was measured using flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 6c) and fluorescent microscopy
(Fig. 2d), revealing a dramatic increase in glucose uptake in SqCC
cell lines. Collectively, these data show that not only is GLUT1
transcriptionally upregulated specifically in SqCC, it is localized
to the plasma membrane where it significantly contributes to
enhanced glucose uptake.
GLUT1 knockdown impairs SqCC viability and tumour
growth. Given the high expression level and critical role in
cellular glucose uptake, we reasoned that GLUT1 may be neces-
sary for cell viability and growth of SqCC. We performed short-
hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of GLUT1 in SqCC
HCC95 and HCC1588 cells using two different GLUT1-targeting
sequences (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). GLUT1 knock-
down markedly suppressed the proliferative capacity of SqCC
cells compared to shGFP control cells even in high-glucose
(25 mM) conditions (Fig. 3b). This was accompanied by extensive
apoptosis and cell death, which we observed by Annexin-V and
7-aminoactinomycin-D (7-AAD) staining, respectively (Fig. 3c).
In contrast, GLUT1 knockdown in ADC cell lines A549 and
H522 only moderately suppressed proliferation with no induction
of apoptosis or cell death (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Fluores-
cently labelled glucose uptake was significantly decreased in
GLUT1-deficient
cells,
which
was
correlated
with
lower
intracellular ATP, NADH and NADPH, suggesting not only
disrupted bioenergetics, but an essential role for the GLUT1-
dependent flux of glucose intermediates into glycolysis-dependent
pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 3d–f). In
contrast to SqCC, reduced glucose uptake did not affect cell
viability or intracellular ATP in ADC cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. 7d,e). Consistently, transient GLUT1 knockdown using short
interfering RNA (siRNA) was more pronounced in SqCC cell
lines, with a complete suppression of proliferation in SqCC but
not ADC cells despite reduced glucose uptake in both SqCC and
ADC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). Intriguingly, A549 was
more sensitive to transient GLUT1 knockdown than H522, in
accordance with previous reports that loss of LKB1 sensitizes cells
to
metabolic
disruption30;
however,
both
ADC
cell
lines
continued
to
proliferate
even
after
depletion
of
GLUT1
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). We further employed an additional
SqCC cell line, HCC2814, that contains an amplification of
PIK3CA and lacks a Kras mutation, which are representative
features of human lung SqCC. Consistently, GLUT1 knockdown
in HCC2814 markedly suppressed in vitro proliferation, which is
associated with increased apoptosis and decreased intracellular
ATP levels (Supplementary Fig. 8d–h).
To determine whether GLUT1 knockdown inhibits tumour
growth in vivo in SqCC, we implanted HCC95-expressing stable
shGLUT1 or shGFP into nude mice. In accordance with in vitro
proliferation, GLUT1 knockdown significantly inhibited the
growth
of
HCC95
tumours
(Fig.
3g
and
Supplementary
Fig. 7g). In contrast, no significant difference in tumour growth
was observed between shGLUT1 and shGFP cells in A549 or
H522 tumours (Supplementary Fig. 7f,h). The selective cytotoxi-
city of GLUT1 knockdown in SqCC strongly suggests glycolytic
addiction and a specific reliance on glucose metabolism. Notably,
a reduction of glucose uptake in ADC cell lines reveals that, while
ADC may rely on GLUT1 as its primary glucose transporter,

 there exist mechanisms within ADC to maintain bioenergetics,
cellular viability and proliferative capacity outside of glucose
metabolism. Overall, these data show that GLUT1 expression and
function are vital for maintaining energy homeostasis and
proliferation in SqCC.
Lung SqCC is reliant on glycolysis. GLUT1-mediated glucose
transport is considered a key regulatory step of glycolysis in several
cancers and benign tissues17. Thus, we reasoned that enhanced
GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in SqCC can be essentially
linked to tumour aerobic glycolysis. To test this, we first performed
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on DEGs enriched in TCGA
NSCLC tumour subtypes31. Notably, glycolysis was identified as
one of the most significantly enriched KEGG gene sets in SqCC
(Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Moreover, the key genes
belonging to metabolic pathways branching off from glycolysis, the
pentose phosphate pathway or those providing intermediate
metabolites into glycolysis (for example, fructose, mannose,
sucrose and pyruvate metabolic pathways) were also highly
elevated in the SqCC-enriched DEGs (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 9a,b). We further analysed the expression levels of individual
glycolytic enzyme genes in the TCGA data sets and found that the
majority of them are significantly upregulated in SqCC compared to
ADC (Fig. 4c). These data suggest that, along with high GLUT1
expression, SqCC exhibits a coordinately elevated glycolytic and
branching metabolic flux.
To verify elevated glycolytic metabolism in SqCC, we measured
extracellular lactate concentration and oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) of representative ADC and SqCC cell lines. We observed
significantly increased lactate production in SqCC cell lines
cultured in 25 mM glucose compared to the ADC cell lines
(Fig. 4d). Interestingly, SqCC cell lines exhibited significantly
reduced lactate production at near physiological glucose con-
centration (5 mM), whereas ADC cell lines showed no change
(Fig. 4d). OCR is also elevated in SqCC cell lines when cultured in
25 mM glucose. Likewise, near physiological glucose (5 mM)
resulted in a significant reduction of OCR only in SqCC cell lines
(Fig. 4e). We speculated that this reduction in lactate production
and OCR was associated with a disruption of cellular bioener-
getics. Indeed, SqCC cell lines grown in media containing 5 mM
glucose exhibit significantly reduced intracellular ATP, NADH
and NADPH levels compared to cells grown in 25 mM glucose
(Fig. 4f–h). However, ADC cell lines exhibited no change in ATP,
NADH or NADPH levels between cells grown in 5 mM glucose or
25 mM glucose. It is possible that the change in SqCC
bioenergetics represents a higher capacity for glucose uptake
and utilization, whereas in 25 mM glucose, glucose uptake in
ADC becomes saturated. To validate whether this fluctuation in
bioenergetics represents a substantial reliance on glucose, but not
an artefact of non-physiologically elevated glucose uptake due to
high GLUT1 level in SqCC cell lines, we cultured SqCC and ADC
cell lines in decreasing concentrations of glucose. At 5 mM
glucose concentration, reduced intracellular ATP, NADH and
NADPH (Fig. 4f–h) is associated with a significant decrease in
cellular viability compared to ADC cell lines (Fig. 4i), indicating
that SqCC cell lines are significantly more sensitive to glucose
concentrations than ADC cell lines. Lower than physiological
glucose concentrations further decreased the cellular viability of
SqCC cell lines. Furthermore, metabolic flux analyses in ADC and
SqCC cell lines cultured in 5 mM glucose after glucose starvation
revealed that cellular glycolytic flux (extracellular acidification
rate, ECAR) is significantly more elevated in SqCC cell lines
compared to ADC cell lines (Fig. 4j). OCR was markedly
decreased in SqCC compared with a divergent increase in
ADC (Fig. 4j). In accordance with SqCC-specific susceptibility
to GLUT1 knockdown, these distinct metabolic responses
strongly suggest a unique reliance on glucose by SqCC but also
provide a rationale for decreased cell viability upon glucose
deprivation.

 If SqCC essentially relies on glycolysis to sustain its survival
and proliferation, inhibition of cellular glycolytic flux should be
able to selectively exert cytotoxic effects on SqCC (Supplementary
Fig. 9c). To test this, we treated SqCC and ADC cells with 25 mM
2-DG, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue that essentially
inhibits the cellular glycolytic flux. Cell viability analysis revealed
that SqCC cell lines exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to
2-DG
treatment
compared
to
ADC
cell
lines
(Fig.
4k;
Supplementary Fig. 10a). Notably, A549, although LKB1-null
and therefore supposedly more sensitive to metabolic disruption
as described previously30,32, was significantly more viable than
SqCC cell lines. Next, we sought to determine whether targeted
GLUT1 inhibition selectively affects cellular viability of SqCC cell
lines. We chose WZB117, a selective, small-molecule GLUT1
inhibitor33, and measured glucose uptake and ECAR in response
to WZB117 treatment. Consistent with the previous study
demonstrating inhibition of glucose uptake in A549, WZB117
inhibited glucose uptake in A549 by 77% (Fig. 4l). In SqCC cell
lines HCC95, HCC1588 and HCC2814, we saw a reduction in
glucose uptake of 64%, 74% and 73%, respectively (Fig. 4l).
Decreased glucose uptake was associated with a substantial
reduction in ECAR in both ADC and SqCC cell lines in a dose-
dependent
manner
after
WZB117
treatment
(Fig.
4m).
Furthermore, cell viability measurements after treatment with
WZB117 revealed that SqCC cell lines showed significantly higher
susceptibility to GLUT1 inhibition than ADC cell lines (Fig. 4n;

 Supplementary Fig. 10b). Considering that WZB117 inhibited
glucose uptake and glycolysis in both ADC and SqCC, these
results suggest a crucial reliance on GLUT1 for survival and
proliferation of SqCC as well as a glycolytic independence in
ADC. Although GLUT1 is the predominant glucose transporter
expressed in both lung ADC and SqCC cells, a recent study as
well as our computational docking analysis (AutoDock Vina,
Scripps Research Institute) suggest that WZB117 may exert its
effects by binding both GLUT1 and GLUT3 transporters34.
Despite
this
additional
affinity,
GLUT3
is
modestly
and
comparably expressed in the ADC and SqCC cell lines used in
our study (Supplementary Fig. 6b), and evaluating the functional
role of
GLUT3 in ADC using
GLUT3 knockdown cells
demonstrated no difference in the proliferation of shGLUT3
and shGFP control ADC cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b).
Collectively, these results suggest a crucial reliance on GLUT1
for survival and proliferation of SqCC as well as a glycolytic
independence in ADC.
Targeting glycolysis or GLUT1 inhibits SqCC tumour growth.
We next investigated whether targeting glycolysis or GLUT1
selectively suppresses in vivo tumour growth of SqCC. We treated
mice bearing SqCC, HCC1588 or ADC, A549 xenograft tumours
with 2-DG (intraperitoneally (i.p.) 500 mg kg � 1, once daily).
Xenograft tumours conserved the distinct histological features
and p63 expression patterns of SqCC and ADC upon histo-
pathological evaluation, as well as markedly elevated GLUT1
expression in SqCC tumours (Supplementary Fig. 12). Consistent
with in vitro results (Fig. 4k), tumour growth of SqCC HCC1588
was significantly inhibited (B60%) upon 2-DG treatment com-
pared to the vehicle-treated group, with no antitumour activity
found in 2-DG-treated ADC A549 tumours (Fig. 5a–c and
Supplementary Fig. 13a). Tumour growth inhibition in 2-DG-
treated SqCC HCC1588 tumours was associated with increased
apoptotic cell death and necrosis, while ADC A549 tumours
exhibited no apoptosis or necrotic areas upon 2-DG treatment
(Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 13b), indicating that SqCC is
selectively susceptible to glycolytic inhibition in accordance with
enhanced reliance on glycolytic metabolism.
Next, we reasoned that pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1
should exert similar specific inhibitory effects in SqCC. WZB117
has previously been shown to significantly inhibit ADC A549
tumour growth over a period of 10 weeks. However, ADC A549
showed no difference in tumour growth when treated with
WZB117
over
the
course
of
3–4
weeks
(Fig.
5e
and
Supplementary Fig. 13c), in agreement with the previous study33.
Equivalently, ADC H1299 tumour growth was unaffected by
WZB117 treatment (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 13d). In
sharp contrast, SqCC HCC1588 and HCC2814 tumours exhibited
up to 40 and 41% reduction in tumour growth upon GLUT1
inhibition, respectively (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 13e,f).
Consistent
with
2-DG
treatment,
WZB117-treated
SqCC
HCC1588 and HCC2814 tumours show increased levels of
necrosis and apoptosis; however, cell viability of ADC A549 and
H1299 tumours was not affected by WZB117 treatment (Fig. 5h).
These results indicate that SqCC relies on GLUT1-mediated
glycolysis for in vivo tumour growth and is thereby selectively
susceptible to glycolytic inhibition.
Enhanced 18F-FDG uptake in lung SqCC. Previous clinical
studies have identified increased 18F-FDG uptake in squamous
subtypes10–15. We took advantage of the KL NSCLC mouse
model, which displays both ADC and SqCC lung tumour
heterogeneity
(Supplementary
Fig.
5a,b),
by
performing
18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging of KL mice followed by pathological
evaluation
and
immunohistochemical
staining
for
GLUT1
(Fig. 6a). 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax) was shown to be strongly
correlated with SqCC subtypes (Fig. 6a,b), with no correlation
found between total tumour burden and SUVmax (Fig. 6c).
A comparison of individual SqCC (p63 þ, SP-C �) and ADC
(p63 �, SP-C þ) tumours within the same mouse confirmed
markedly elevated 18F-FDG uptake in SqCC tumours (Fig. 6d). In
addition, analysis of SUVmax of human NSCLC patients
(Supplementary Table 1) confirmed that higher SUVmax is
evident in SqCC patients compared to ADC patients (Fig. 6e,f).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that 18F-FDG uptake is
significantly increased in SqCC tumours, reflecting high GLUT1
expression and glucose uptake compared to ADC tumours.
PI3K/AKT signalling induces GLUT1 expression through HIF-1a.
We next explored the mechanism underlying the specific upregu-
lation of GLUT1 in SqCC. It has previously been shown that human
SqCC tumours and cell lines exhibit high prevalence of genomic
copy number gains in chromosome 3q, the genomic region con-
taining the gene of the catalytic subunit of the PI3K complex,
PIK3CA35,36. Given that PI3K/AKT signalling has been shown to
enhance
the
translation
of
HIF-1a
under
non-hypoxic
conditions37,38, we hypothesized that aberrantly activated PI3K/
AKT signalling may contribute to GLUT1 expression through
oncogenically stabilized HIF-1a signalling. A previous TCGA
analysis has identified significant enrichment of PI3K pathway-
activating
alterations,
which
include
oncogenic
or
genomic
alterations of PIK3CA, PTEN and mTOR in 47% of the TCGA
cohort of lung SqCC35. We confirmed the frequent amplification of
the
genomic
region
containing PIK3CA within lung SqCC
(Supplementary Fig. 14a; Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data
Analysis Center 2016, SNP6 Copy number analysis, GISTIC2, Broad
Institute of MIT and Harvard)39. Our TCGA analyses revealed both
shallow genomic copy number gains and high-level amplifications of
PIK3CA in the majority of patients of the TCGA lung SqCC cohort
(46.4% amplification, 44% shallow gain) and a robust linear
correlation between PIK3CA genomic copy number and mRNA
expression (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 14c). Notably, GLUT1
mRNA expression positively correlated with PIK3CA genomic copy
number (Fig. 7a). Our analysis also revealed that lung SqCC exhibits
the highest mRNA expression of PIK3CA among the TCGA cohorts
(Supplementary Fig. 15a). Our analysis of the TCGA lung SqCC
cohort further revealed frequent shallow deletions in the genomic
region containing PTEN (9.8% deep deletion, 44.8% shallow
deletion; Supplementary Fig 14b). Similar to PIK3CA, PTEN
mRNA expression robustly correlated with genomic copy number
(Supplementary Fig 14d). TCGA lung SqCC patients with PTEN
genomic loss exhibit the highest expression of GLUT1 mRNA
(Fig. 7b). However, no correlation was found between the GLUT1
mRNA level and genomic loss of CDKN2b (p15), the most frequent
genomic copy number loss identified within the TCGA lung SqCC
cohort (Supplementary Fig. 14b,g), supporting a specific correlation
of GLUT1 expression with PIK3CA/PTEN genomic abnormalities.
GSEA performed on the ranked set of DEGs between SqCC and
ADC TCGA tumour samples identified a significant enrichment of
AKT and mTOR oncogenic signalling in SqCC, as defined by the
oncogenic signature gene set (Supplementary Fig. 14e,f). Analysis of
TCGA reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)40 data also identified a
significant positive correlation between GLUT1 mRNA expression
and PIK3CA, phospho-AKT (pT308), phospho-AKT (pS473) and
phospho-4E-BP1 (pT37/T46) as well as a negative association
between GLUT1 mRNA expression and PTEN protein expression
(Supplementary Fig. 15b,c). These results suggest significant input
from the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulating GLUT1 expression
in SqCC.

 To determine whether PI3K/AKT signalling accounts for the
HIF-1a-mediated GLUT1 expression in SqCC, we analysed
activities of AKT and its downstream signalling pathways as well
as HIF-1a expression in KL SqCC and ADC tumours. Consistent
with TCGA analysis, SqCC tumours exhibit increased AKT
signalling activities compared to ADC tumours, which is strongly
associated with HIF-1a expression (Fig. 7c and Supplementary
Fig. 16a). Downstream of AKT phosphorylation, 4EBP1 and S6 are
known to promote translation of HIF-1a mRNA37. Our analysis of
SqCC and ADC KL tumours identified that higher p-AKT,
p-4EBP1 and p-S6 expression in SqCC is associated with higher
HIF-1a and GLUT1 expression in SqCC tumours compared to
ADC tumours (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 16a). Elevated AKT/
mTOR activity and HIF-1a expression were also evident in SqCC
cells and xenograft tumours (Supplementary Fig. 16b,c).
To validate whether non-hypoxic HIF-1a mediates GLUT1
expression in SqCC, we knocked down HIF-1a in SqCC cells. We
found that HIF-1a knockdown resulted in a marked decrease in
GLUT1 expression level under non-hypoxic conditions (Fig. 7d).
Importantly, SqCC cell lines maintained under non-hypoxic
conditions (21% O2)
have highly elevated GLUT1
mRNA
(Fig. 2a), suggesting hypoxia-independent mechanism(s). Further-
more, GSEA analysis of DEGs between TCGA lung SqCC and ADC
cohorts identified a significant upregulation of known HIF-1a
target genes41 (Supplementary Fig. 14h), which include GLUT1 and
various glycolytic enzymes within the DEGs enriched in the TCGA
lung SqCC cohort (Supplementary Fig. 14i). Collectively, these
results suggest that oncogenically activated PI3K/mTOR/HIF-1a
signalling contributes to GLUT1 expression in SqCC.
High GLUT1 correlates with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients.
We next investigated the clinical and prognostic value of
GLUT1 expression in the TCGA lung SqCC cohort. We sepa-
rated the patients into high and low GLUT1 mRNA-expressing
groups based on the median GLUT1 mRNA expression.
Kaplan–Meier 5-year survival analysis revealed a significantly
reduced survival duration in lung SqCC patients with high
tumour GLUT1 expression (Plog-rank ¼ 0.04) with a hazard ratio
of 1.46 (Fig. 8a). Interestingly, we determined high GLUT1
expression to be associated with poor survival in lung ADC
patients (Supplementary Fig. 17), suggesting that GLUT1
expression can be employed as a potential prognostic bio-
marker in NSCLC patients. We further performed clin-
icopathologic correlation with GLUT1 expression in NSCLC
patients (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1). Our analysis con-
firmed that GLUT1 expression is strongly associated with SqCC
(Table 1). High GLUT1 expression is associated with poor
tumour cell differentiation (Table 1). Lung SqCC has been
primarily linked to smoking42. Indeed, we found that GLUT1
expression was strongly associated with smoking (P ¼ 0.03,
Table 1). High GLUT1 expression was also strongly associated
with male patient gender, a reflection of the cultural bias among
smokers in the Korean tumour cohort43. Consistently, TCGA
analysis revealed significantly increased GLUT1 expression in
NSCLC patients with smoking history compared to lifelong
non-smokers (Fig. 8b). Taken together, these data suggest that
lung
cancer
patients
with
high
GLUT1
expression
are
significantly associated with SqCC histological phenotype,
smoking and poor differentiation.

 Increasing evidence suggests that there exist multiple layers of
inter- as well as intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity that may
essentially affect therapeutic outcomes of metabolic inhibition9.
In light of this, identification of distinct metabolic alterations that
are linked to specific subtypes of NSCLC may lead to the clinical
development of effective NSCLC therapeutics with reduced
toxicities. In this study, we have discovered distinct metabolic
heterogeneity between major tumour subtypes of human NSCLC,
ADC and SqCC. Our comprehensive analysis encompassing

 enhanced glucose uptake and glycolytic dependency. Conversely,
GLUT1 and glycolytic enzyme expression remain relatively low in
the majority of ADC when compared to SqCC, suggesting that
ADC may be significantly less reliant on glucose metabolism. Our
study further provides evidence of the selective antitumour effects
of glycolytic (2-DG) or GLUT1 (WZB117) inhibition on SqCC.
These results have revealed that SqCC is vitally reliant on
augmented GLUT1-mediated glucose metabolism for survival
and tumour growth. Intriguingly, a recent epidemiological study
has demonstrated, in a large cohort, that a diet composed of foods
that cause consistently high availability of blood glucose is
strongly associated with the development of SqCC among NSCLC
patients46. This study suggests that high dietary glycaemic index
and carbohydrate availability may contribute to the development
of SqCC, supporting our finding of the elevated glucose
dependence of SqCC.
In sharp contrast, in vitro cellular bioenergetic pathways and
cell viability as well as in vivo tumour growth of ADC was not
affected by glucose restriction or glycolytic inhibition. Although
previous studies have reported an increase in GLUT1-mediated
aerobic glycolysis by EGFR, KRAS, BRAF or other frequent
oncogenic mutations in ADC22,47–49, our analysis found no
significant increase in GLUT1 mRNA expression in ADC patients
possessing KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, LKB1, PIK3CA or PTEN
mutations compared to those who did not (Supplementary
Fig. 18a). However, it should be noted that the limited number of
TCGA lung ADC patients who possess rare mutations hinder a
conclusive analysis. Further study within large cohorts of NSCLC
will be required to assess GLUT1 expression with less-frequent
oncogenic mutations. LBK1 inactivation has been linked to
increased HIF-1a signalling50,51; however, a slight but statistically
significantly lower expression of GLUT1 was detected in tumours
with LKB1 mutations compared to LKB1 wild-type tumours
(P ¼ 0.0076, Mann–Whitney u-test, Supplementary Fig. 18a).
Moreover, these studies did not compare GLUT1 expression or
FDG uptake among the different subtypes of NSCLC. We
demonstrate that LKB1-null A549 cell line exhibits higher
GLUT1 expression as compared to other ADC cell lines we
tested,

and
SqCC
xenograft
tumours
(HCC95
and

A549 xenograft tumours (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Importantly,
as in SqCC, GLUT1 mRNA expression was also increased in
ADC patients possessing genomic copy number gains of PIK3CA,
although occurring at a much lower frequency than in the TCGA
lung SqCC cohort (Supplementary Fig. 18b). However, GLUT1
levels in PIK3CA-amplified ADC tumours were significantly
lower (3.3-fold) than SqCC tumours (Fig. 7a and Supplementary
Fig. 18b), suggesting additional histology-specific regulation of
GLUT1 expression in SqCC. These observations suggest a
mechanistic involvement of aberrantly activated PIK3 pathway
signalling in elevated glucose metabolism in NSCLC. Considering
the recently described plasticity of NSCLC and potential for ADC
to escape treatment through LKB1 inactivation or dysregulated
pentose phosphate pathway-mediated metabolic reprogramming
and
squamous
transdifferentiation
in

mice52,
our
characterization of GLUT1-mediated glycolytic metabolism in
SqCC may be an important step in identifying and preventing
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance in ADC.
Enhanced influx and consumption of glucose in highly
proliferative malignant cells can be utilized not only to fulfil
cellular bioenergetic demands, but more importantly to provide
various macromolecular building blocks and NADPH for cellular
biosynthetic reactions and redox homeostasis53. Aberrantly

 have been identified as critical glycolysis-diverting pathways
conferring crucial metabolic benefits for tumorigenesis by
providing essential intermediates for nucleotide biosynthesis
and cellular reducing power in the form of NADPH54,55.
Intriguingly, SqCC cells have elevated levels of NADPH, which
was significantly reduced in lower glucose concentrations (5 mM),
suggesting that heightened glucose utilization of SqCC cells may
contribute to these branched metabolic pathways (Fig. 4h).
Accordingly, TCGA cohort of lung SqCC shows significantly
higher expression of rate-limiting enzymes for the serine
biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways compared to
ADC
(Supplementary
Fig.
19a,b).
In
addition,
a
recent
metabolic tracing study revealed a significant increase in serine
biosynthesis among NSCLC cell lines with high Nrf2 activity56.
Interestingly, our TCGA analysis revealed greater than twofold
higher Nrf2 mRNA expression in SqCC than ADC tumour
samples (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Further studies to assess
metabolites and metabolic enzymes involved in these pathways
will be of great importance.
KRAS mutations are infrequently found in human SqCC lung
tumours; this underlines an inherent limitation in capturing the
distinct genetic alterations of SqCC within mouse models and
individual cell lines. The KL mouse model, as well as SqCC cell
line HCC1588, features a KRAS mutation whose role in driving
SqCC tumour formation is not well understood. However,
GLUT1 is uniformly elevated in most SqCC cell lines we tested
(Fig. 2a,b), despite diverse molecular alterations present in these
cell lines (Supplementary Table 3). The use of PDX models
provides an excellent opportunity to explore the differential
metabolism of NSCLC subtypes in an even more clinically
relevant setting. Not only do PDX models retain the genetic and
histopathological characteristics of their donor tumours, but
distinct elevation of GLUT1 expression in SqCC is recapitulated
across successive mouse-to-mouse passages (Fig. 1g). Further
characterization using the PDX tumours will be crucial for
validating
enhanced
glucose
reliance
and
susceptibility
to
glycolytic inhibition in SqCC.
This study provides evidence that the elevated GLUT1-
mediated glycolytic flux has clinical relevance with high potential
for translational development. Our findings of increased 18F-FDG
uptake in human and murine SqCC are consistent with previous
clinical studies, demonstrating that SqCC has higher 18F-FDG-
PET activity11–13. While increased 8F-FDG uptake in SqCC is
clearly evident, recent studies have also demonstrated that certain
subtypes of ADC, such as the solid subtype, demonstrate high
8F-FDG-PET activity as well57. Our analysis of 18F-FDG uptake
in NSCLC patients suggests that, while a small proportion of
Acinar and Papillary ADC tumours have comparably similar
SUVmax, SqCC tumours exhibit significantly increased SUVmax
(Supplementary Table 1). While constitutively elevated GLUT1
expression in SqCC shows no correlation with proliferation
markers Ki67 or PCNA (Supplementary Fig. 2c), a small subset of
ADC
tumours
displays
comparably
high
GLUT1
mRNA
expression (Fig. 1a) that significantly correlates with Ki67 and
PCNA mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 20). These data suggest
that, in contrast to SqCC, GLUT1 expression in ADC may be
restricted to advanced tumours, which may play a critical role in
malignancy and 18F-FDG uptake. Our clinical correlation analysis
of both human NSCLC tumours and TCGA clinical data revealed
a robust association of SqCC-specific high GLUT1 expression
with poor tumour cell differentiation status (Table 1), supporting
the prognostic potential of high GLUT1 expression in SqCC.
High prevalence of multiple genetic alterations leading to
aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT signalling has been reported in
SqCC35,36. Genetic deletion of PTEN, a phosphatase that
negatively regulates PI3K/AKT activity, resulted in SqCC in
LKB1-deficient mice58, suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway is
critically implicated in SqCC. Our TCGA analyses confirmed that
genomic copy number gain, including both shallow and high-
level amplifications, of PIK3CA frequently occurs in the TCGA
lung SqCC cohort (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 14a; Broad
Institute TCGA Genome Analysis Data Center, 2016, SNP6 Copy
number analysis, GISTIC2, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard),
leading to lung SqCC exhibiting exceptionally high mRNA
expression of PIK3CA among the TCGA cohorts (Supplementary
Fig. 15a). Besides, a frequent genomic copy number loss of PTEN
is evident within the TCGA cohort of SqCC samples (Fig. 7b and
Supplementary Fig. 14b). Significantly enriched AKT and mTOR
oncogenic signalling (Supplementary Fig. 14e,f), as defined by
curated oncogenic signalling gene sets59, further suggests an
increased
PI3K/AKT/mTOR
activity
in
SqCC.
Correlative
analysis of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling using RPPA data with
GLUT1 mRNA expression confirms a strong association in lung
SqCC (Supplementary Fig. 15b). Interestingly, we observed a
modest negative correlation between GLUT1 mRNA expression
and PIK3CA, p-AKT, and p-S6 in lung ADC, suggesting the
involvement of further histology-specific regulation of GLUT1 in
ADC (Supplementary Fig. 15c). In an agreement with human
SqCC, KL and xenograft SqCC tumours exhibit significantly
increased AKT activity and downstream signalling directing the
stabilization of HIF-1a and GLUT1 expression (Fig. 7c and
Supplementary Fig. 16a–c). These results propose potential
mechanisms underlying SqCC-specific GLUT1 induction by
which oncogenic PI3K/AKT-mediated stabilization of HIF-1a
leads to overexpression of GLUT1 and other glycolytic enzymes,
which subsequently results in heightened glucose metabolism in
SqCC. Importantly, these genomic alterations that lead to an
increase in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling are among the most
strongly correlated with GLUT1 expression in SqCC (Fig. 7a,b).
In addition, it has been shown that mTOR inhibitor MLN0128
attenuates HIF-1a and GLUT1 expression in NSCLC cell lines
and the KL model of NSCLC, which is associated with decreased
18F-FDG uptake, further corroborating the regulation of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway signalling on GLUT1 expression through
HIF-1a (ref. 30). Collectively, these data suggest that PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signalling may represent a viable target for future
therapeutic development. However, the clinical efficacy of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibition as a stand-alone therapy is limited in lung
SqCC60 because of potential multiple kinase signalling adaptation
mechanisms61–64. Further preclinical and clinical assessment of
resistance
mechanisms
in

SqCC
is
needed
for
the
development
of
combinatorial

therapies as well as effective screening to determine patient
candidacy for treatment.
We cannot exclude the possibility of involvement of extrinsic
microenvironmental factors such as hypoxic induction of HIF-1a
that contributes to GLUT1 expression especially when tumours
become hypoxic at the advanced stages. Although augmented HIF-
1a signalling has been well associated with elevated glycolytic flux
and FDG uptake in human cancers, it is evident that tissue-specific
metabolic regulation may contribute to further heterogeneity in
glucose metabolism. For example, Von Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL)
deletion and inactivation are among the most common mutations
observed in renal cell carcinoma leading to oncogenic stabilization
of HIF-1a. Yet, renal cell carcinoma does not exhibit markedly
elevated FDG uptake, suggesting that tissue-specific differences may
further regulate glucose metabolism among different cancers that
harbour similar oncogenes65. A recent study demonstrating
significant metabolic heterogeneity being crucially regulated by
the tumour microenvironment66,67 argues for the necessity of
further studies to determine whether SqCC exhibits a unique
hypoxia-prone tumour microenvironment such as poor perfusion

 or infiltration of metabolically active inflammatory cells, which
consume high levels of oxygen, thereby causing local hypoxia.
Our results demonstrating specific anticancer effects of GLUT1
and glycolysis inhibitors on SqCC suggest enough therapeutic
window for GLUT1 inhibition. Although there is potential risk of
side effects in employing GLUT1 inhibitors, given that GLUT1 is
the primary GLUT family member expressed in red blood cells
and endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier16, haematologic
analysis and histological evaluation of major organs including the
brain revealed no apparent toxicities with the administration
regimens used in this study; yet, significant anti-SqCC effects
were achieved (Supplementary Fig. 21a,b and Fig. 5f,g). Despite
the significant advances in lung cancer treatment with targeted
therapy, exceedingly few promising options have been made for
SqCC.

Methods
Mice. Lox-Stop-Lox KrasG12D mice28 and Lkb1lox/lox mice68 were obtained from
the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All mice were backcrossed over 15
generations into the FVB/N. Lung tumours were induced by intranasal inhalation
of Adenovirus-Cre28. All experimental procedures utilizing mice were approved by
The University of Texas at Dallas and The University of California, Los Angeles,
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
Human NSCLC samples. Human lung tumour, corresponding non-malignant
lung tissue specimens and clinical information were provided by the National
Biobank of Korea—Kyungpook National University Hospital (NBK-KNUH). A
collection of 21 SqCC, 15 ADC and paired non-tumoral frozen tissue samples were
obtained for RNA extraction, as well as archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
samples from surgically resected lung cancer specimens of the same set of patients.
All materials derived from the NBK-KNUH were obtained from patients at the
time of surgery under institutional review board-approved protocols. Informed
written consent was obtained from all patients and the study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of KNUH.
Cell culture. All NSCLC lines used in this study were obtained from the Hamon
Cancer Center Collection (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
TX)69 and common mutational statuses have been extensively characterized
(Supplementary Table 3). Cells were cultured in high-glucose (4.5 g l � 1) DMEM
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids at 37 �C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. All cell lines have been DNA-
fingerprinted using the PowerPlex 1.2 Kit (Promega) and were found mycoplasma-
free using the e-Myco kit (Boca Scientific).
In vivo xenograft tumour experiments. For tumour implantation, 5 � 106 cells
were suspended in 50% matrigel (Corning Life Sciences) and 50% Hank’s Balanced
Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma) was injected subcutaneously into the hind flank of
male nu/nu (Foxn1nu) mice (Jackson Lab) between 6 and 7 weeks of age. In all, 24
mice were used for shGLUT1 knockdown xenograft experiments and 86 mice were
used for the treatment of glycolytic inhibitors 2-DG or WZB117. Treatment was
administered via intraperitoneal injection: 2-DG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
500 mg kg � 1 in PBS (Sigma) once daily and WZB117 10 mg kg � 1 in DMSO/PBS
(Calbiochem) once daily. Tumour volume was measured at indicated times using
electronic calipers.
Small animal 18FDG-PET/CT imaging and analysis. For animal 18FDG-PET and
CT imaging and analysis, a standardized protocol was used70. Mice were made to
fast for 4 h before the injection of FDG and kept warm, under gas anaesthesia (2%
isoflurane) for the duration of the FDG uptake and imaging procedure. Mice were
injected with 200 mCi FDG by i.p. injection. A 1-h interval for uptake was allowed
between probe administration and micropositron emission tomography
(microPET)/microcomputed tomography (microCT) scanning. Image acquisition
and reconstruction were performed70. Briefly, mice were placed in a dedicated
imaging chamber designed for use for the CT and both PET systems. Data were
acquired by using a Siemens Inveon Preclinical Solutions microPET focus 220 for
10 min and a MicroCAT II CT (Imtek Inc.) instrument for 8 min. MicroPET
images were reconstructed by using statistical maximum a posteriori probability
algorithms (MAP) into multiple frames. MicroCT images were reconstructed using
filtered back-projection without scatter or attenuation correction. We chose a ramp
filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 and a zoom of 5 to give a voxel size of
0.379 mm3. PET and CT images were analysed using the OsiriX Imaging Software
(version 3.8; OsiriX). MicroCT and PET images were reviewed blinded to score
tumour burden starting at 3 weeks post-tumour induction and continuing every 2
weeks after imaging. Lesions were identified in the upper, mid and lower portions
of the right and left lung lobes, then they were measured and their locations
recorded. Consecutive two-dimensional regions of interest were drawn on lung
lesions in coronal and axial views to detect the maximum FDG uptake. These
regions encompassed the entire metabolically active tumour. The tumour diameter
from microCT images was measured in the coronal and axial views, and the two
values were averaged to give a mean diameter per lesion. Tumour volume was
calculated using the equation 4/3p(r3).
Clinical 18FDG-PET imaging and analysis. For clinical imaging, all patients fasted
for at least 6 h, and their blood glucose levels were determined before the
administration of 18F-FDG. Patients with blood glucose levels higher than
150 mg dl � 1 were rescheduled for a later examination, and treatment was admi-
nistered to maintain a blood glucose concentration of o150 mg dl � 1 in all sub-
jects. Patients received intravenous injections of B5.2 MBq of FDG per kg of body
weight and were advised to rest for 1 h before the acquisition of the 18F-FDG-PET/
CT image. 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans were performed using a Discovery 600
(GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Before the PET scan, for attenuation
correction, a low-dose CT scan was obtained without contrast enhancement from
the skull base to the thigh when the patient was supine and breathing quietly. PET
scans were also obtained from the skull base to the thigh at 2.5 min per bed
position. PET images were reconstructed with a 128 � 128 matrix, an ordered-
subset expectation maximum iterative reconstruction algorithm. The PET/CT
images were interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, and a
final consensus was achieved for all patients. A positive finding was defined as any
focus with an increased FDG uptake as compared with the surrounding normal
tissue. Foci of FDG uptake due to normal physiology or benign variants, such as
muscular exercise or an infectious pulmonary infiltration, were excluded from the
analysis. The primary tumours underwent semiquantitative and volumetric ana-
lyses using a volume viewer software on a GE Advantage Workstation 4.5 (GE
Healthcare). The SUVmax was obtained using the following formula:
SUVmax ¼ maximum activity in the region of interest (mBq g � 1)/(injected dose
(mBq)/body weight (g)). Automatic measurements were used to delineate the
volume of interest using an isocontour threshold method based on the SUV.
Informed written consent was obtained from all patients and the study protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of KNUH.
Immunoblot. Cells were lysed in CST lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology)
supplemented with MG132 (40 mM; Calbiochem) and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche). Lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting
performed on polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Fisher Scientific) with
primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA overnight at 4 �C. The following antibodies
were used for immunoblotting: GLUT1 (1:1,000; Alpha Diagnostic; GT11-A),
p63 (1:1,000; Biocare Medical; CM163A), CK5 (1:1,000; Abcam; ab52635),
HIF-1a (1:1,000; BD Transduction Laboratories; 610959), AKT and Ser473-p-AKT
(1:1,000; Cell Signaling; 9,272 and 9,271, respectively), b-actin (1:5,000; Sigma;
A5441). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz)
were diluted 1:5,000 in 5% skim milk, followed by detection with SuperSignal West
Femto or Pico substrate kits (ThermoFisher). Uncropped images of immunoblots
are provided as Supplementary Fig. 22.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were seeded on coverslips and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by per-
meabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA
and applied overnight at 4 �C. The following primary antibodies were used: GLUT1
(1:250; Alpha Diagnostic; GT11-A) and p63 (1:200; Biocare Medical; CM163A).
Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to visualize primary
antibody staining (1:400; Life Technologies; A-11070, T-6390). Cells were coun-
terstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted using Vecta-
shield Mounting Medium (Vector Labs) and viewed under a fluorescent
microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ni-U).
IHC and immunofluorescence. Lung cancer patient tissue microarrays were
obtained from Protein Biotechnologies. KL and xenograft mice were perfused with
PBS/10 mM EDTA followed by 4% PFA. Tissues were removed and further fixed in
4% PFA overnight followed by paraffin embedding. Tissue sections were stained
with haematoxylin and eosin in accordance with standard methods. For IHC, tissue
sections (5 mm) were subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval (citrate buffer,
pH 6). Primary antibodies were applied and incubated at 4 �C overnight. Vectastain
ABC (Vector Labs), EnVision kit (Dako) or TSA kit (PerkinElmer) with DAB
substrate (Vector Labs) were used to amplify and visualize primary antibody
staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For immunofluorescence, pri-
mary antibodies were visualized through Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488)-conjugated

Cell Signaling; 9664), Ser473-p-AKT (1:200; Cell Signaling; 4060), Ser235/236-p-S6
(1:200; Cell Signaling; 4858) and Thr37/46-p-4EBP1 (1:200; Cell Signaling; 2855).
Images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U microscope through the NIS
Elements imaging software (Nikon) and quantified through ImageJ (NIH).
Patient-derived xenografts. Surgical specimen samples from lung cancer patients
were obtained from Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases,
with the patients’ informed consent. Animal studies were performed in compliance
with the guidelines of the institutional animal study committee of Osaka Medical
Center. Primary xenograft tumours were generated by inoculating small pieces of
patient tumours into immunodeficient mice27. Surgically resected tissues were
minced and washed with HBSS (Invitrogen). Specimens were digested in DMEM
supplemented with 0.26 U ml � 1 Liberase DH (Roche) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 �C for 1–2 h. Digested tissue suspensions were
passed through 500- and 250-mm metal mesh filters for removal of undigested
fragments. Suspensions were further filtered through 100- and 40-mm cell strainers
(BD Falcon). Fragments on the cell strainer and cells in the flow-through fractions
were collected separately, and each were washed with HBSS and cultured in
StemPro hESC medium (Gibco). After processing, the tumour fragments
spontaneously form cancer-tissue-originated spheroids. One hundred cancer-
tissue-originated spheroids were then suspended in 50 ml of matrigel (Corning Life
Sciences) and subcutaneously transplanted into nonobese diabetic severe combined
immunodeficient mice.
Quantitative RT–PCR. Cells were lysed with TRI reagent (Sigma) and RNA
extraction performed with the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymoresearch)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For quantitative RT–PCR, RNA was
mixed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad) supplemented
with iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was
performed with the CFX-96 real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-
time PCR primers are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
shRNA and siRNA knockdown. pLKO.1-shRNA-HIF-1a (Mission TRC shRNA,
TRCN0000003810), shRNA-GLUT1#1 (Mission TRC shRNA, TRCN0000043583)
and shRNA-GLUT1#2 (Mission TRC shRNA, TRCN0000423590) were obtained
from Sigma. For lentivirus production, HEK 293 T cells were transfected with
pLKO.1 shRNA, psPAX2 and pMD2.G using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen).
Cells were incubated with viral supernatant containing 8 mg ml � 1 polybrene.
pLKO.1-shRNA-GFP was used as a control vector. Reverse transfection with a pool
of four specific siRNAs targeting GLUT1 (L-007509-02-0005, ONTARGETplus
SMARTpool; Dharmacon) was performed using siRNAs complexed with Lipo-
fectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Targeting sequences for all shRNA and siRNAs are
provided in Supplementary Table 5.
Cellular metabolic analysis. Glucose uptake was analysed using Glucose Uptake
Cell-Based Assay Kit (Cayman) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells
were incubated in glucose-free DMEM (Gibco) containing a fluorescently labelled
deoxy-glucose analogue, 2-NBDG at 37� for 1 h. Cells were prepared as per the
manufacturer’s protocol and emission at 535 nm was measured using flow cyto-
metry (SH800, Sony) and a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ni-U).
Generated histograms were overlayed using FlowJo and fluorescent intensity was
quantified via ImageJ. For extracellular lactate measurement, cells were cultured in
pyruvate-free DMEM (Gibco) containing 5 or 25 mM glucose. Media was collected
after 48 h and lactate concentration was measured using the L-Lactate Assay Kit I
(Eton Bioscience) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. OCR was measured using
the Extracellular Oxygen Consumption Assay (Abcam). Cells were prepared in a
96-well plate and OCR was measured through a fluorescent microplate reader at
650 nm for 2 h (Biotek Cytation 5) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Cellular
ATP levels in cells cultured in 25 or 5 mM glucose media (DMEM, Gibco) or
treated with 50 mM WZB117, or 25 mM 2-DG were measured using an ATP
detection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellular
NADH and NADPH levels were assayed using the NAD þ /NADH-Glo or NADP/
NADPH-Glo Assay Kit (Promega). Cells were plated on a 96-well plate in pyr-
uvate-free media containing 25 or 5 mM glucose. Cells were then allowed to
proliferate for 24 h, lysed and assayed in 1% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide.
Cellular NADH and NADPH levels were assayed based on the manufacturer’s
instructions and luminescence was measured using a Biotek Cytation 5 plate
reader. Raw luminescence was then normalized to cell count measured by a
TC20-automated cell counter (Bio-Rad).
Extracellular metabolic flux analysis. ECAR and OCR were measured using a
Seahorse XFp Analyzer (Agilent). Cells were plated in appropriate growth medium
the day prior to the assay and allowed to adhere overnight. On the day of the assay,
the cells were washed and incubated in glucose- and pyruvate-free Seahorse XF
Base Medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine for 1 h in a 37 �C non-CO2
incubator. Standard assay settings were used to measure ECAR and OCR prior to
and after the addition of 5 mM glucose. To measure changes in ECAR upon
WZB117 treatment, escalating doses of WZB117 (50 then 100 mM) were admi-
nistered using the standard assay settings. ECAR and OCR were normalized to cell
count following the assay.
In vitro glycolysis inhibition and flow cytometry analyses. Cell death was
measured using the PE Annexin-V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were treated with 25 mM 2-DG
or 50 mM WZB117 in 5 mM glucose, pyruvate-free DMEM (Gibco) for 48–72 h.
Cells were collected and stained with annexin-V and 7-AAD as per the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Cells were analysed by flow cytometry (SH800, Sony) and
FlowJo software.
TCGA analysis. Level 3 mRNA-sequencing gene expression data from the TCGA
was obtained through the Broad Institute’s Firebrowse data portal for the TCGA
SqCC and ADC cohorts. In total, 501 lung SqCC and 517 lung ADC tumour
samples were included in our analysis. We additionally included 51 lung SqCC and
59 lung ADC tumour-paired normal tissue samples in our analysis. The obtained
gene expression profiles were produced on the Illumina HiSeq platform and
constructed using the RSEM package to determine gene expression in terms of
transcripts per million mappable reads. The expression profiles were further
quartile-normalized for comparability between data sets. We employed R and Excel
to produce a global gene expression set in which each gene is ranked by the
difference in average expression (expressed in transcripts per million mappable
read) between lung SqCC samples and lung ADC samples. Visualization of dif-
ferential gene expression by heatmap was produced using the Broad Institute’s
GenePattern HeatMapImage module using row normalization on gene sets of
interest. We then used GSEA to determine gene set and pathway enrichment
within DEGs between lung SqCC and lung ADC. Using the pre-ranked GSEA
package, a ranked global gene list, produced from the TCGA level 3 mRNA-
sequencing data, was used to identify the core enriched KEGG and oncogenic
signature gene sets in lung SqCC. A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 500 genes
per set were used as the parameters to define gene set enrichment. Pearson
parametric and Spearman nonparametric correlation analyses were performed in
Prism GraphPad. Somatic Copy number analysis was carried out using the GIS-
TIC2 algorithm on level 3 SNP6 data obtained from the Broad Institute’s Fire-
browse portal. For this analysis, 501 lung SqCC patient tumour samples with SNP6
genomic copy number data were used. Copy number variation calls were made
from the gene-level threshold GISTIC2 output. The GISTIC algorithm takes into
account both high and low thresholds for copy number determination across all the
input samples to assign significance to copy number variation. Correlative analysis
of SNP6 copy number variation data with mRNA gene expression was performed
in Excel and R using linear regression. Level 3 RPPA data were obtained through
the Broad Institute’s Firebrowse portal.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out in Excel, R, Prism
GraphPad 6 and SAS. All results were expressed as mean±s.e.m. or median±the
interquartile range. A P value of 0.05 via two-tailed Student’s t-test of unknown
variance, Mann–Whitney U-test, w2-test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA
was considered statistically significant for hypothesis testing. Multiple comparison
testings were accompanied with ANOVA to identify the source of significant
variance among the data.
Data availability. The mRNA sequencing, genomic copy number analysis data,
DNA mutational data, RPPA and clinical cohort information referenced during the
study are available in a public repository from the TCGA website (www.cancer-
genome.nih.gov). All TCGA data used in the study, including mRNA-sequencing
gene expression profiles, Gistic2 genomic copy number analysis, DNA mutational
data, RPPA and clinical cohort information were obtained through the Firebrowse
data portal (www.firebrowse.org). The authors declare that all the other data
supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its
supplementary information files and from the corresponding author upon
