ABSTRACT
Peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is a scarce abdominal-
pelvic malignancy that presents with non-specific features 
and exhibits a wide clinical spectrum from indolent to 
aggressive disease. Due to it being a rare entity, there 
is a lack of understanding of its molecular drivers. 
Most treatment data are from limited small studies 
or extrapolated from pleural mesothelioma. Standard 
treatment includes curative surgery or pemetrexed-
platinum palliative chemotherapy. To date, the use of novel 
targeted agents has been disappointing.
Described is the management of two young women 
with papillary peritoneal mesothelioma with widespread 
recurrence having received platinum-pemetrexed 
chemotherapy. Both patients obtained symptomatic and 
disease benefit with apitolisib, a dual phosphoinositide 
3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-mTOR) 
inhibitor for subsequent relapses, with one patient having 
a partial response for almost 3 years. Both are alive and 
well 10–13 years from diagnosis.
Conclusion These case presentations highlight a 
subgroup of rare MPeM that behave indolently that is 
compatible with long-term survival. This series identifies 
the use of targeted therapies with PI3K-mTOR-based 
inhibitors as a novel approach, warranting further clinical 
assessment. Development of prognostic biomarkers is 
essential to aid identify tumour aggressiveness, help 
stratify patients and facilitate treatment decisions.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) 
is a rare malignancy, accounting for 30% of 
all mesotheliomas.1 In contrast with pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM), it is common in 
younger women, often exhibiting a more 
indolent course with long-term survivors.2 3 
Asbestos exposure is the prime risk factor for 
MPM, however, the evidence for its associa-
tion with peritoneal disease is much weaker.4–6
Epithelioid, sarcomatoid and biphasic 
are the most common histological meso-
thelioma subtypes. Deciduoid epithelioid 
is a rare subtype associated with a poor 
prognosis.7–9 Borderline and benign vari-
ants 
have 
been 
described, 
including 
multicystic and well-differentiated papillary 
mesothelioma (WDPM). The latter, is a 
non-invasive subtype that occurs in women 
of reproductive age with no asbestos expo-
sure, which demonstrates an indolent 
clinical course with a relatively good prog-
nosis, although the potential for aggressive 
progression exists, thus, long-term follow-up 
is advocated.7 10 Due to the different clinical 
outcomes, WDPM should be histologically 
differentiated 
from 
the 
architecturally 
similar but more aggressive epithelioid 
papillary form.
MPeM typically presents with non-specific 
features, including abdominal pain, disten-
sion, palpable pelvic masses, altered bowel 
habit and rarely subcutaneous nodules. 
Constitutional symptoms such as asthenia, 
weight loss and fever also occur.1 11 Radio-
logical findings suggestive of MPeM include 
peritoneal thickening, mesenteric nodules

Key questions
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare clinical 
entity with few clinical trials being undertaken and 
most data derived from its pleural counterpart. 
Platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy is the standard 
therapy and studies with novel targeted agents have 
been disappointing.
What does this study add?
 
► These cases demonstrate significant sustained 
clinical benefit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-
mammalian 
target 
of 
rapamycin 
(PI3K-
mTOR) inhibition in peritoneal cases without 
PIK3CA mutations or phosphatase and tensin 
homologue (PTEN) loss.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► This highlights a novel therapeutic strategy by 
targeting the PI3K-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signalling 
network and should encourage recruitment of 
peritoneal mesothelioma patients to early phase 
clinical studies.

and omental cakes. Slow-growing disease is often an inci-
dental surgical finding.1 5 11
Distant metastases are rarely associated with MPeM, 
thus, disease confined to the peritoneum is amenable 
to potentially curative cytoreductive surgery with a 
median overall survival of 28–35 months.5 Hyperthermic 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been advocated 
as postoperative therapy and long-term survival can 
be achieved,12 13 although prospective randomised 
trials have not been conducted.14 Treatment for inop-
erable MPeM involves palliative chemotherapy with 
pemetrexed, cisplatin and gemcitabine alone or in 
combination.1 14 The former is based on data extrapo-
lated from a large phase III pleural mesothelioma study 
that demonstrated a 2.8-month survival benefit with 
cisplatin-pemetrexed combination to 12.1 months.15 
MPeM-specific studies with pemetrexed ± cisplatin 
include a phase II study16 and an expanded access 
programme in 109 patients that demonstrated a 57% 
1-year survival rate with pemetrexed-cisplatin compared 
with 42% with pemetrexed alone.17 Additionally, a 
phase II study in 26 patients using pemetrexed and 
gemcitabine combination showed promising results 
with median overall survival of 26.8 months.18 Given the 
paucity of peritoneal randomised trials, this regimen is 
the accepted standard first-line therapy for metastatic 
MPeM.
Recent trials in pleural mesothelioma using novel 
targeted agents have been disappointing, despite prom-
ising preclinical data. Phase II studies using agents 
targeting the epidermal and vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptors have yielded little promise.19–21 Neither 
has the use of vorinostat, a histone deactylase (HDAC) 
inhibitor, nor the mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) inhibitor everolimus.22–24 Improved under-
standing of the pathogenesis and molecular drivers of 
MPeM is warranted, in order to elucidate new therapeutic 
options in this poorly understood disease.
Activation 
of 
the 
phosphoinositide 
3-kinase 
(PI3K)-phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-
AKT-mTOR signalling network, a critical driver 
of oncogenesis, has been reported in mesothe-
lioma through loss of PTEN function, reported in 
30%–60%,25 26 and somatic mutations in the neuro-
fibromatosis type 2 (NF2) in up to half of malignant 
mesothelioma cases.27 Thus, pharmacological inhibition 
of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT-mTOR pathways could provide 
putative therapeutic benefit in mesothelioma. Herein, 
we report two patients with MPeM who were treated with 
apitolisib, a dual class I PI3K, mTORC 1 and 2 inhibitor.28 
This agent has shown promise particularly in patients 
with mesothelioma in early phase studies. Three-quar-
ters of the partial responses in the dose escalation 
phase were in patients with mesothelioma (one perito-
neal and two pleural) with a 12% partial response rate 
confirmed in the phase II expansion.29 These cases show 
that PI3K-mTOR inhibitors may offer novel treatment 
strategies after palliative chemotherapy, enabling long-
term survival despite disease recurrence.
CASE REPORTS
Two female patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital, 
London, UK are described. All patients provided written 
consent for research publications.
Case 1
A female aged 28 years presented with abdominal pain, 
percutaneous biopsy of a 15 cm pelvic mass was reported 
as a benign highly differentiated adenomatous tumour 
(table 1). At laparotomy the lesion was only amenable 
to partial resection. Final histology confirmed papillary 
MPeM. She received four cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-peme-
trexed chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiotherapy and 
brachytherapy. Following a 2-year disease-free interval, 
further pelvic recurrence was resected with bilateral salp-
ingo-oophorectomy and appendicectomy, followed by 
four cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed and MRI surveillance 
thereafter. Inoperable pelvic progression occurred after 
2 years and was rechallenged with eight cycles of carbo-
platin-pemetrexed, with stable disease. The third relapse 
occurred after 1.5 years, 6.5 years from diagnosis, and the 
patient commenced a phase I trial with the PI3K-mTOR 
kinase inhibitor, apitolisib.28 30 She received over 2.5 years 
of this agent with minimal toxicity and good symptomatic 
benefit. The CA-125 fell from 217 to 32 and a confirmed 
partial radiological response was detected. Interestingly, 
intermittent interruption of apitolisib dosing for toxici-
ties during the intrapatient dose escalation was mirrored 
with a rise in the CA-125 and radiological evidence of 
minor growth, which was then suppressed following reini-
tiation of treatment. After 2.8 years, slow progression 
ensued and she was taken off study and actively moni-
tored for 5 months before developing new peritoneal 
metastases. She was enrolled into a second phase I trial 
with the combination of a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 
(PARP)31 and an AKT inhibitor. This was well tolerated, 
the CA-125 fell from 200 to 69. However, after 6 months 
she had slowly progressive disease. She is alive and well 13 
years after diagnosis.
Case 2
A female aged 19 years presented with vaginal bleeding, 
abdominal pain and distension; CT scan confirmed large 
volume pelvic and peritoneal disease (table 1). The 
omental mass was laparoscopically resected and histo-
pathology confirmed a WDPM. She became pregnant 
almost immediately after diagnosis, hence was monitored 
until delivery of a healthy child. The disease progressed 
1 year after diagnosis and was considered inoperable; 
therefore, she commenced four cycles of cisplatin-peme-
trexed with stable disease. Further progression occurred 
2 years later, disease stability was obtained with rechal-
lenge of four further cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed. The 
third significant progression occurred after 1 year and 
she enrolled into two sequential phase I trials. The first

with an oral HDAC inhibitor that was terminated early 
due to cardiotoxicity. The second with apitolisib, which 
she received for 15 months with significant tumour 
regression (27% decrease), overall stable disease by the 
Response Evaulation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). 
The use of MRI volumetric assessment demonstrates 
a significant reduction of the large burden peritoneal 
disease by 39% (figure 1), highlighting the superiority 
of MRI imaging in this type of disease. She continues on 
follow-up with disease control without requiring further 
treatment to date. She remains alive, 10 years following 
initial presentation and has recently given birth to a 
healthy second child.
DISCUSSION
Despite the majority of patients with MPeM demonstrating 
an aggressive biological phenotype, these cases highlight 
the potential for some cases of invasive epithelioid meso-
thelioma in younger women to behave indolently. Both 
patients are still alive with follow-up ranging from 123 to 
156 months. These cases exhibit different MPeM histolog-
ical subtypes (one papillary, one WDPM), but all appear 
slow growing. Some studies have suggested a cohort of 
MPeMs have a different biological behaviour compatible 
with long-term survival, but such cases cannot be identi-
fied on the basis of histology alone. Platinum-pemetrexed 
chemotherapy was the treatment backbone for both 
patients that led to disease stability.
Both patients subsequently achieved tumour shrinkage 
with apitolisib, the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor. Case 1 had 
symptomatic 
improvement, 
normalisation 
of 
the 
CA-125, a maintained radiological partial response and 
remained on treatment for 2.8 years. Case 2 received 15 
months of apitolisib with significant tumour reduction 
of almost a third by RECIST and 40% using volumetric 
measurements. Molecular sequencing was undertaken 
to ascertain the reason for their responses. No mutations 
were detected in the 19 most common oncogenes tested 
using the prevalidated Sequenom panel V.1.0, specifically 
no PIK3CA or RAS/RAF mutations were evident. Also, 
no PTEN loss was evident by immunohistochemistry.29 
Notably, no assays to assess NF2 have been undertaken, 
this would be interesting to know as mutations can occur 
in up to half of mesothelioma cases27 and could account 
for sensitivity to PI3K-mTOR pathway blockade. Another 
molecular change that would be interesting to assess is the 
BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1), a tumour suppressor, 
in which somatic mutations occur up to 60% in mesothe-
lioma.32 33
Much of the data for peritoneal mesothelioma is derived 
from the pleural counterpart, however, should these 
be considered similar biological entities? Furthermore,

in-depth molecular characterisation of these patients is 
required to elucidate the oncogenic drivers of MPeM. 
Targeting the loss of function of tumour suppressors 
PTEN and NF2 is pharmacologically challenging, and 
new efforts are needed through inhibition of synthetic 
lethal targets or other approaches such as targeting ubiq-
uitin-mediated destruction or epigenetic gene silencing. 
The latter is mediated through the HDAC family that 
reduce DNA transcription through histone modifications. 
HDAC overexpression has been documented in MPM, 
but large-scale evaluation of the best-studied HDAC inhib-
itor, vorinostat, failed to show survival benefits in pleural 
mesothelioma; more specific HDAC inhibitors may be 
needed. In addition, prognostic biomarkers are needed 
to identify aggressiveness in tumour biology necessitating 
early treatment from the more indolent cases.
The CA-125 tumour marker is often elevated in peri-
toneal mesothelioma and has been associated with 
massive peritoneal involvement.6 Among CA-125 secre-
tors, it can be used as a sensitive marker that correlates 
with the extent of debulking surgery and also in assessing 
disease progression.34 In our series, CA-125 mirrored the 
radiological and clinical course of the disease. However, 
multiple marker fluctuations occurred on treatment 
without obvious corroborative radiological evidence of 
disease alteration. Therefore, it remains undetermined 
whether CA-125 can be considered a reliable marker in 
indolent MPeM. More novel tumour markers are under 
investigation such as mesothelin, mesothelin-related 
proteins and osteopontin.35–37
This case series highlights the challenging nature of 
the initial diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma, given 
the non-specific symptoms coupled with difficulties in 
making an accurate diagnosis based on histology. MPeM 
in female patients shows similarity with epithelial ovarian, 
tubal and peritoneal cancer, leading to further diagnostic 
quandary. From our experience, laparoscopic biopsies 
were the most reliable approach to ensure the correct 
diagnosis and specific histological subtype was confirmed 
which is essential to facilitate the optimal clinical manage-
ment.
Both cases were monitored by routine CT scans. MRI 
scans can provide more detailed assessment of diffuse 
peritoneal disease; it is especially useful during the 
follow-up period in order to identify significant disease 
progression in the context of slowly enlarging disease and 
to help determine when to instigate treatment. In addi-
tion, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting 
the use of diffusion-weighted MRI. Radiological assess-
ment of MPeM can be challenging and RECIST criteria 
may not be the optimal radiological tool due to the diffuse 
pattern and often small-volume disease.
Many of these patients had slow progression over many 
years despite recurrences, and the question is when to 
initiate treatment? Both cases showed demonstrable 
clinical benefit and tumour shrinkage with frequent 
rechallenges of anticancer therapies. Generally, chemo-
therapy does not seem to cause significant tumour 
shrinkage, suggesting that MPeM is not particularly 
chemosensitive. Targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis

has shown promising antitumour activity in two patients 
treated within our series. Newer experimental agents 
are obviously needed and are being investigated. The 
combination of a PARP inhibitor with an AKT inhibitor 
may merit further exploration; based on preclinical data 
suggesting that the combination can increase PARP inhib-
itor sensitivity. Other approaches could include targeting 
mesothelin itself and specific drug-related conjugates are 
now in clinical trial. Clearly, further research is warranted 
into optimal MPeM treatments, timing and the develop-
ment of prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers that will 
hopefully translate into superior clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, these cases highlight the importance of 
obtaining the correct histological diagnosis to tailor 
treatment and to dissect out the indolent from the more 
aggressive subtypes. This must be carefully correlated 
with symptomatic and radiological changes to drive treat-
ment decisions. Chemotherapy remains the backbone of 
treatment, and can offer long-term disease control. The 
molecular understanding of this condition is poor, which 
correlates with the paucity of biological treatment options 
available. These cases highlight the clinical success of 
the use of apitolisib, the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, deriving 
symptomatic benefit and sustained tumour shrinkage. 
Moreover, this provides a much-needed novel therapeutic 
approach in this rare disease entity that warrants further 
clinical evaluation.
