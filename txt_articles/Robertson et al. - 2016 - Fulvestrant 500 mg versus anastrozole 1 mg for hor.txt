SUMMARY 
47 
BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are a standard of care for hormone receptor-
48 
positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC). We investigated 
49 
whether the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant could improve 
50 
progression-free survival versus anastrozole in postmenopausal patients who had not 
51 
received prior endocrine therapy. 
52 
METHODS: In this Phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial (FALCON), eligible 
53 
patients, from 113 centres in 20 countries, were endocrine therapy-naïve, had estrogen 
54 
receptor and/or progesterone receptor-positive LA/MBC, WHO performance status 0–
55 
2, and ≥1 measurable/non-measurable lesion(s). Patients were randomised (1:1) to 
56 
fulvestrant (500 mg IM; Days 0, 14, 28, then each 28 days) or anastrozole (1 mg orally 
57 
daily) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme. The primary endpoint was 
58 
progression-free survival (PFS), determined by RECIST 1·1, intervention by surgery 
59 
or radiotherapy due to disease deterioration, or death (any cause). This trial is 
60 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01602380). 
61 
FINDINGS: Between 17 October 2012 and 11 July 2014, 524 patients were enrolled 
62 
and 462 patients were randomised (fulvestrant, n=230; anastrozole, n=232). Primary 
63 
endpoint was met, as shown by a statistically significant improvement in PFS for 
64 
fulvestrant vs anastrozole (hazard ratio [HR] 0·797; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
65 
0·637–0·999; p=0·0486). Median PFS was 16·6 (95% CI 13·83–20·99) vs 13·8 (95% 
66 
CI 11·99–16·59) months for fulvestrant and anastrozole, respectively. Most common 
67 
adverse events (AEs) were arthralgia (16·7% vs 10·3%) and hot flushes (11·4% vs 
68 
  
Page 4 
10·3%); 7·0% vs 4·7% discontinued due to AEs with fulvestrant and anastrozole, 
69 
respectively. 
70 
INTERPRETATION: Results confirm the superior efficacy of fulvestrant over 
71 
anastrozole in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive LA/MBC who 
72 
have not received prior endocrine therapy.

INTRODUCTION 
76 
First-line treatment recommendations for postmenopausal women with hormone 
77 
receptor-positive (estrogen receptor [ER], and/or progesterone receptor [PgR]) locally 
78 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer includes endocrine therapy with a 
79 
third-generation aromatase inhibitor (AI; anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) or 
80 
tamoxifen.1–3 In hormone receptor-positive disease, third-generation AIs have 
81 
increased efficacy compared with tamoxifen in terms of time to progression.4–8 
82 
Fulvestrant, a selective ER degrader (SERD) that blocks ER function by inducing ER 
83 
degradation,9 is approved for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive 
84 
advanced breast cancer and disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.10,11 
85 
The 500 mg dose of fulvestrant was approved based on data from the Phase 3, 
86 
double-blind Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer 
87 
(CONFIRM) study that compared fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg in 
88 
patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who experienced 
89 
progression after prior endocrine therapy.12 In CONFIRM, progression-free survival 
90 
(PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 0·80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·68–0·94; p=0·006)12 
91 
and overall survival (OS; HR 0·81; 95% CI 0·69–0·96; p=0·02)13 were increased with 
92 
fulvestrant 500 mg vs fulvestrant 250 mg. 
93 
Improved efficacy of first-line treatment with fulvestrant vs anastrozole was 
94 
demonstrated in a Phase 2, open-label Fulvestrant First-Line Study Comparing 
95 
Endocrine Treatments (FIRST) study in postmenopausal women with hormone 
96 
receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.14 Fulvestrant was 
97 
shown to be at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of clinical benefit rate (CBR; 
98 
  
Page 6 
72·5% [74/102] vs 67·0% [69/103], respectively; odds ratio, 1·30; 95% CI, 0·72–
99 
2·38; p=0·386).14 In subsequent follow-up analyses, fulvestrant was associated with a 
100 
longer PFS/time to progression (HR 0·66; 95% CI 0·47–0·92; p=0·01)15 and 
101 
improved OS (HR 0·70; 95% CI 0·50–0·98; p=0·04)16 vs anastrozole. 
102 
The objective of the current study was to confirm the superior PFS advantage for 
103 
fulvestrant versus anastrozole observed in the FIRST study, in a double-blind Phase 3 
104 
design. The population for FALCON were postmenopausal women with hormone 
105 
receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had not received 
106 
prior endocrine therapy, in order to avoid reducing efficacy of the control arm through 
107 
exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy. 
108 
METHODS 
109 
Study design 
110 
The Fulvestrant and AnastrozoLe COmpared in hormonal therapy Naïve advanced 
111 
breast cancer (FALCON) trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01602380) is a Phase 3 
112 
randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, international, multicentre study that 
113 
compared the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant with anastrozole in 
114 
postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed ER+ and/or PgR+ locally 
115 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
116 
Ethical approval 
117 
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
118 
International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice guidelines. An 
119 
  
Page 7 
Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approved the final protocol at each 
120 
study site. All patients provided written, informed consent. 
121 
Participants 
122 
Eligible patients were postmenopausal women who had a World Health Organization 
123 
(WHO) performance status of 0–2, and ≥1 measurable and/or non-measurable 
124 
lesion(s). Key exclusion criteria included prior hormonal treatment for breast cancer; 
125 
presence of life-threatening, metastatic, visceral disease; prior systemic therapy for 
126 
breast cancer, except one line of cytotoxic chemotherapy; radiation therapy if 
127 
completed ≤28 days prior to randomisation (unless for bone pain control); human 
128 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) over-expression/gene amplification; 
129 
concomitant anticancer treatment (except bisphosphonates/denosumab); systemic 
130 
estrogen-containing hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) use ≤6 months prior to 
131 
randomisation (see Supplementary Appendix for full inclusion and exclusion criteria).  
132 
Randomisation and masking 
133 
Patients were randomised sequentially (1:1) to fulvestrant 500 mg or anastrozole 1 mg 
134 
using a computer-generated randomisation scheme and an integrated voice/web 
135 
response system. Patients were stratified at randomisation according to locally 
136 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer; prior or no prior treatment with chemotherapy 
137 
for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and measurable or non-measurable 
138 
disease. 
139 
Study drugs were labelled using a unique identifier linked to the randomisation 
140 
scheme. The active study drug and placebo for fulvestrant (pre-filled syringes) and 
141 
anastrozole (tablets) were identically packaged to maintain blinding. 
142 
  
Page 8 
Procedures 
143 
Study treatment was initiated at randomisation (Day 0). Fulvestrant (plus daily 
144 
anastrozole placebo) was administered on Days 0, 14 (±3), 28 (±3), and every 28 (±3) 
145 
days thereafter as two 5 mL intramuscular injections at each visit. No fulvestrant dose 
146 
reductions were permitted. Anastrozole (plus fulvestrant placebo on Days 0, 14, 28, 
147 
and every 28 days thereafter) was administered once daily as a single tablet. Treatment 
148 
continued until objective disease progression or other criteria for discontinuation were 
149 
met in terms of adverse events (AEs), protocol non-adherence, or patient’s decision to 
150 
withdraw. 
151 
Study visits occurred at screening (Day -28 to -1), randomisation (Day 0), Day 14, 
152 
every 4 weeks from Week 4 to 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease 
153 
progression. Safety and tolerability were assessed at each study visit, and for up to 8 
154 
weeks after the last fulvestrant/placebo injection. HRQoL questionnaires were 
155 
administered at baseline and at 3-monthly intervals. Following disease progression or 
156 
treatment discontinuation, HRQoL questionnaires will be administered at 6-monthly 
157 
until a final OS analysis. 
158 
Outcomes 
159 
The primary endpoint of the study was to demonstrate the superior PFS of patients 
160 
treated with fulvestrant vs anastrozole. A progression event was determined based on 
161 
tumour assessments performed locally by each investigator, and was defined by 
162 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1·1, or 
163 
surgery/radiotherapy for worsening of disease, or death from any cause.  
164 
  
Page 9 
Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR; best overall response of 
165 
either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] in patients with measurable 
166 
disease at baseline), duration of response (DoR), and expected duration of response 
167 
(EDoR), CBR (best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks), 
168 
duration of clinical benefit (DoCB), expected duration of clinical benefit (EDoCB), 
169 
and OS (time from randomisation until death by any cause). 
170 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Trial Outcome Index 
171 
(TOI)17 derived from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer 
172 
(FACT-B) questionnaire, and FACT-B total score. 
173 
Safety and tolerability assessments included AEs (graded according to Common 
174 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [CTCAE], version 4·0), serious AEs (SAEs), 
175 
discontinuations due to AEs, deaths due to AEs, and pre-defined AEs of special 
176 
interest (joint disorders and back pain) were reported throughout the study. Laboratory 
177 
parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, physical examination, and vital 
178 
signs were monitored at pre-specified time points throughout the study. The safety 
179 
analysis population was used for all safety outcome variables and included all patients 
180 
who received at least one dose of randomised treatment (including placebo) according 
181 
to the actual treatment initially received. 
182 
Statistical analysis 
183 
For the primary outcome, PFS was evaluated at a single time point when 
184 
approximately 306 progression events had occurred. Randomisation of approximately 
185 
450 patients was planned to achieve 306 progression events. It was calculated that if 
186 
0·69 is the true PFS HR for the comparison of fulvestrant vs anastrozole, this number 
187 
  
Page 10 
of events would provide 90% power for statistical significance at the 5% two-sided 
188 
level. A PFS HR of 0·80 would deliver a statistically significant difference for the 
189 
primary outcome. The primary analysis for this study was conducted in the intent-to-
190 
treat (ITT) population comprising all randomised patients. 
191 
Comparison of PFS for fulvestrant vs anastrozole was performed using a stratified 
192 
log-rank test at the two-sided 5% significance level in the ITT population. Strata 
193 
included were prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease and 
194 
measurable disease; locally advanced vs metastatic disease was not included because 
195 
only a small number of patients had locally advanced disease. Results are presented as 
196 
an estimate of the HR, associated 95% CI, and p value. An interim analysis of OS was 
197 
performed at the time of PFS analysis, and OS was analysed in the same way as PFS. 
198 
OS and ORR were tested using a multiple testing procedure with an alpha-exhaustive 
199 
recycling strategy to control type-I error at the overall alpha level.18 CBR was 
200 
analysed using a logistic regression model including the same stratification factors as 
201 
for PFS and examination of odds ratio of the two treatment groups. ORR was analysed 
202 
in the same way as CBR; however, measurable disease was not included in the model. 
203 
Kaplan-Meier plots were produced for DoCB and DoR. EDoCB and EDoR are 
204 
methodologies designed to provide an unbiased treatment comparison of DoCB and 
205 
DoR by including all randomised patients (rather than just responding patients), and 
206 
were calculated using the method of Ellis et al.19 EDoR and EDoCB allow a statistical 
207 
comparison to be made on the duration of response and clinical benefit between the 
208 
two treatment arms. An analysis of time to deterioration of TOI and FACT-B total 
209 
score was performed as described for PFS. 
210 
  
Page 11 
A subgroup analysis was performed on PFS data (ITT) for the following baseline 
211 
covariates: ER+ and PgR+ (yes/no); metastatic disease (yes/no); concomitant use of 
212 
bisphosphonates (yes/no); measurable disease (yes/no); prior chemotherapy for locally 
213 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer (yes/no); geographic region; prior systemic 
214 
estrogen containing HRT (yes/no); and visceral disease (yes/no). HRs and 95% CI 
215 
were calculated, and a Kaplan-Meier was generated for each subgroup. A global 
216 
interaction test was performed using a Cox-proportional hazard model to evaluate if 
217 
the treatment effect was consistent across the covariates. A post hoc interaction test to 
218 
assess for consistency of the treatment effects across the visceral and non-visceral 
219 
subgroups was also performed. 
220 
All patients who received at least one dose of randomised treatment were included in 
221 
the safety population. AEs were summarised descriptively using Medical Dictionary 
222 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms. 
223 
This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01602380. 
224 
Role of the funding source 
225 
This study was designed and funded by AstraZeneca, who was involved in the 
226 
reviewing and interpretation of data, the writing of the manuscript, and in the decision 
227 
to submit for publication. 
228 
All authors had access to all the data and were responsible for the decision to submit 
229 
the manuscript.  
230 
RESULTS 
231 
  
Page 12 
Between 17 October 2012 and 11 July 2014, a total of 524 patients were enrolled. Of 
232 
these, 462 patients were randomised (ITT; Figure 1): 230 received fulvestrant and 232 
233 
received anastrozole at 113 centres in 20 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, 
234 
South America, and South Africa. Data cut-off was 11 April 2016. 
235 
Two patients in the fulvestrant group did not receive study treatment following 
236 
randomisation (patient decision); therefore, the safety population comprised 228 and 
237 
232 patients in the fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, respectively. 
238 
In total, 14 and 13 protocol deviations related to eligibility criteria were observed in 
239 
the fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, respectively. Three patients were reported to 
240 
have received prior endocrine therapy. These protocol deviations were considered 
241 
unlikely to affect the interpretation of study data. 
242 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced 
243 
between groups (Table 1).  
244 
There were 309 progression events at data cut-off; of these, 143/230 (62·2%) and 
245 
166/232 (71·6%) occurred in the fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, respectively. 
246 
Fulvestrant was associated with a statistically significant improvement in PFS 
247 
compared with anastrozole (HR 0·797; 95% CI 0·637–0·999; p=0·0486; Figure 2). 
248 
Median PFS was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·83–20·99) with fulvestrant and 13·8 
249 
months (95% CI 11·99–16·59) with anastrozole (difference in medians, 2·8 months). 
250 
Table 2 shows the proportions of patients with CR, PR, and SD. In patients with 
251 
measurable disease, ORR was 46·1% (89/193) with fulvestrant and 44·9% (88/196) 
252 
with anastrozole (odds ratio 1·07; 95% CI 0·72–1·61; p=0·7290). DoR in patients 
253 
with measurable disease at baseline is shown in Supplementary Figure 1a. Median 
254 
  
Page 13 
DoR was longer in the fulvestrant arm than the anastrozole arm (20·0 [95% CI 15·90–
255 
27·63] and 13·2 [95% CI 10·64–16·72] months, respectively). EDoR was 11·4 and 
256 
7·5 months, respectively (EDoR ratio 1·52; 95% CI  1·03–2·26; p=0·0367). 
257 
CBR was 78·3% (180/230) and 74·1% (172/232) with fulvestrant and anastrozole, 
258 
respectively (odds ratio 1·25; 95% CI 0·82–1·93; p=0·3045). DoCB in patients with 
259 
clinical benefit is shown in Supplementary Figure 1b. Median DoCB was 22·1 (95% 
260 
CI 18·46–24·87) and 19·1 (95% CI 16·53–20·47) months for fulvestrant and 
261 
anastrozole, respectively. The EDoCB was 21·9 months in the fulvestrant arm and 
262 
17·5 months in the anastrozole arm (EDoCB ratio 1·26; 95% CI 0·99–1·59; 
263 
p=0·0561). 
264 
Median OS could not be calculated as currently there is insufficient follow-up (31% 
265 
maturity). At data cut-off, 67/230 (29·1%) and 75/232 (32·3%) patients in the 
266 
fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, respectively, had died (HR 0·88; 95% CI 0·63–
267 
1·22; p=0·4277). 
268 
Treatment effects on PFS were largely consistent across the pre-specified patient 
269 
subgroups (global interaction test, p=0·1061), with some exceptions noted: patients 
270 
with prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease; patients with 
271 
non-measurable disease; patients who were not ER+ and PgR+ at baseline; and 
272 
patients with visceral disease (Figure 3a). For patients with non-visceral disease, the 
273 
HR was 0·59 (95% CI 0·42–0·84), with median PFS of 22·3 (95% CI 16·62–32·79) 
274 
vs 13·8 (95% CI 11·04–16·59) months for fulvestrant and anastrozole, respectively 
275 
(Figure 3b). In the visceral disease subgroup, the HR was 0·99 (95% CI 0·74–1·33), 
276 
with median PFS of 13·8 (95% CI 11·04–16·53) months for fulvestrant and 15·9 
277 
  
Page 14 
(95% CI 11·27–16·89) months for anastrozole. A post hoc interaction test to assess for 
278 
consistency of the treatment effects across the visceral and non-visceral subgroups 
279 
gave p=0·0092.  
280 
At data cut-off, median duration of actual exposure to fulvestrant was 14·7 months 
281 
(range 0·9–37·7) and to anastrozole was 13·9 months (range 0·2–36·0). In total, 
282 
166/228 (72·8%) and 173/232 (74·6%) patients reported an AE in the fulvestrant and 
283 
anastrozole groups, respectively. Table 3 presents AEs with an incidence >5% in 
284 
either group. SAEs were reported by 30/228 (13·2%) vs 31/232 (13·4%) patients 
285 
receiving fulvestrant or anastrozole, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 presents 
286 
SAEs considered causally related to treatment). Overall, 16/228 (7·0%) and 11/232 
287 
(4·7%) patients in the fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, respectively, discontinued 
288 
due to AEs (Supplementary Table 2). Grade 3 or worse AEs were reported by 51/228 
289 
(22·4%) and 41/232 (17·7%) patients receiving fulvestrant and anastrozole, 
290 
respectively; none occurred in >5% of patients in either group. There were 6/228 
291 
(2·6%) and 7/232 (3·0%) deaths due to AEs in the fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, 
292 
respectively. No deaths due to AEs were considered causally related to treatment. 
293 
AEs of special interest (joint disorders and back pain) were reported by 59/228 
294 
(25·9%) and 42/232 (18·1%) patients in the fulvestrant and anastrozole groups, 
295 
respectively. All AEs of special interest were mild or moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 
296 
2), with the exception of one patient (1/228 [0·4%]) in the fulvestrant group who had 
297 
Grade 3 back pain. No AEs of special interest led to treatment interruption, or had a 
298 
fatal outcome. No SAEs of special interest were reported.

Page 15 
Overall, no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, ECG recordings, 
300 
physical examination, or vital signs were observed in either group. 
301 
Mean FACT-B and TOI scores were maintained and similar in both treatment groups. 
302 
Time to deterioration was not statistically significantly different between treatment 
303 
arms for both TOI scores (HR 0·90; 95% CI 0·70–1·15; p=0·4008) and FACT-B total 
304 
score (HR 0·84; 95% CI 0·66–1·07; p=0·1594). 
305 
DISCUSSION 
306 
The primary endpoint of this Phase 3 study was met, with patients receiving 
307 
fulvestrant experiencing statistically significantly longer PFS than patients receiving 
308 
anastrozole, confirming the hypothesis that fulvestrant is a more efficacious treatment 
309 
than anastrozole in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally 
310 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior treatment with 
311 
endocrine therapy. This represents a meaningful and relevant finding for which 
312 
clinical data are limited.20 Strengths of this study are the inclusion of a diverse patient 
313 
population, the double-dummy study design, and the use of a standard-of-care 
314 
comparison arm. Unlike many other studies where patients were allowed to receive 
315 
prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, patients in the FALCON study were completely 
316 
endocrine therapy-naïve and were even limited in their use of HRT prior to 
317 
randomisation to greater than 6 months, given the known effect of HRT withdrawal. 
318 
Therefore, this study provides a direct comparison of the therapeutic efficacy between 
319 
the SERD fulvestrant and a third-generation AI without the confounding effects of 
320 
prior adjuvant endocrine therapy exposure of any type. The HR for PFS seen in this 
321 
study (0·797) is similar to the improvement shown by third-generation AIs over 
322 
  
Page 16 
tamoxifen.4–8 In addition to the primary endpoint results, pre-defined subgroup 
323 
analyses were performed. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant 
324 
across all the subgroups although it was noted that potential enhanced treatment 
325 
effects with fulvestrant vs anastrozole were seen in some subgroups, including 
326 
patients with non-visceral disease compared with visceral disease. This latter 
327 
observation requires further study. 
328 
The FALCON data add to the extensive data on the efficacy of fulvestrant in patients 
329 
with advanced breast cancer, and consolidate the evidence for superior efficacy for 
330 
fulvestrant over a third-generation AI, initially raised by the results of the Phase 2 
331 
FIRST study, where the majority of patients were also endocrine-naïve.14–16 
332 
The superiority of fulvestrant over anastrozole in an endocrine therapy-naïve patient 
333 
population warrants future clinical evaluation of fulvestrant in other endocrine 
334 
therapy-naïve patient populations, such as the (neo)adjuvant setting, where a Phase 3 
335 
comparison with anastrozole for 6 months before surgery is currently underway 
336 
(NCT01953588). The superior efficacy of fulvestrant was not associated with an 
337 
enhanced response rate. The PFS advantage appears to be driven by the more durable 
338 
responses associated with fulvestrant treatment as shown by the DoR and EDoR 
339 
analyses. Since aromatase inhibition is prone to resistance generated by ESR1 
340 
mutation,21 one possibility for the PFS advantage is that fulvestrant is less prone to 
341 
this resistance mechanism. The recent advent of circulating tumour DNA analysis 
342 
should allow this hypothesis to be further evaluated. In preliminary studies it does 
343 
appear that fulvestrant retains activity against tumours that harbour an ESR1 
344 
mutation.22 
345 
  
Page 17 
The AE profile observed was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of 
346 
fulvestrant and anastrozole. The most common AE reported with fulvestrant in the 
347 
FALCON study was arthralgia, which occurred at a numerically higher frequency to 
348 
that noted in the FIRST study (16·7% [38/228] and 9·9%, respectively);14 however, no 
349 
patients discontinued as a result. More patients in the fulvestrant group experienced 
350 
myalgia than in the anastrozole group. Less than 2% of patients in either treatment 
351 
group experienced SAEs causally related to treatment or discontinued treatment due to 
352 
AEs, and no treatment-related deaths occurred.  
353 
An alternative to first-line fulvestrant has been established by the results of the 
354 
Palbociclib Ongoing Trials in the Management of Breast Cancer (PALOMA-2) trial 
355 
(NCT01740427), which excluded patients resistant to AIs, and the Mammary 
356 
Oncology Assessment of LEE011’s (ribociclib) Efficacy and Safety (MONALEESA-2 
357 
trial (NCT01958021). These studies  investigated the efficacy of the cyclin-dependent 
358 
kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors palbociclib or ribociclib plus letrozole, 
359 
respectively, vs letrozole alone in postmenopausal women who had not received prior 
360 
systemic treatment for advanced breast cancer.23,24 Statistically significant 
361 
improvements in PFS were shown for palbociclib plus letrozole (HR 0·58; 95% CI 
362 
0·46–0·72; p<0·0001) in PALOMA-2, and ribociclib plus letrozole (HR 0·56; 95% CI 
363 
0·43–0·72; p=3·29 × 10-6) in MONALEESA-2 vs letrozole alone.23 Both the 
364 
PALOMA-2 and MONALEESA-2 studies demonstrate that addition of a second agent 
365 
from a different class is associated with improved efficacy but additional toxicity, and 
366 
the potential for an increased financial burden.25 As such, the incidence of Grade 3 
367 
and 4 SAEs, and permanent treatment discontinuation due to AEs (both 
368 
haematological and non-haematological AEs) was greater with palbociclib plus 
369 
  
Page 18 
letrozole and ribociclib plus letrozole than letrozole alone. Thus, when considered in 
370 
the context of the results from FALCON, fulvestrant provides a lower toxicity option 
371 
for first-line therapy that could be favoured for patients with low or intermediate risk 
372 
disease with relatively good prognosis (e.g. non visceral disease), patients with high 
373 
risk disease who have comorbidities restricting the use of combination targeted 
374 
therapy, patients who cannot afford a CDK4/6 inhibitor, or in countries where 
375 
CDK4/6 inhibitors are not been approved by regulatory authorities.  
376 
It is clearly important to identify patients likely to gain most benefit from treatment 
377 
with endocrine monotherapy. Indeed, patients who achieved clinical response to 
378 
fulvestrant experienced longer duration of response vs anastrozole. Thus, patients with 
379 
endocrine-sensitive disease may not always require a combination treatment that is 
380 
associated with greater toxicity. FALCON and PALOMA-2/MONALEESA-2 trials 
381 
are not directly comparable and are immature from an OS perspective. OS results 
382 
could provide additional evidence to support decisions between the use of a first-line 
383 
CDK4/6 inhibitor with an AI vs fulvestrant monotherapy, particularly given the OS 
384 
advantage already observed for fulvestrant over anastrozole in the FIRST study. 
385 
In conclusion, the FALCON study results support the conclusion that fulvestrant is 
386 
more efficacious than anastrozole on the basis of a statistically significant 
387 
improvement in PFS in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive 
388 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine 
389 
therapy. Both treatments were associated with an acceptable tolerability profile. 
390 
Collectively, the efficacy and tolerability findings support the clinical effectiveness of 
391 
fulvestrant in this setting.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT PANEL 
Evidence before this study 
We performed a general search on PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov (search terms 
‘fulvestrant 500 mg’ and ‘clinical trial’) to identify clinical studies of fulvestrant 
500 mg, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), versus any third-generation 
aromatase inhibitor. No date or language limitations were applied. From the results 
identified, we believe that the randomised, double-blind, multicentre FALCON trial 
(NCT01602380) is the first Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
fulvestrant compared with anastrozole in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal 
women with advanced breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine treatment, 
a clinically meaningful patient population. 
Added value of the study 
A previous open-label, Phase 2 study (the FIRST study) in postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the 
majority of whom were endocrine-naïve, demonstrated that first-line fulvestrant was 
at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of clinical benefit rate and was superior in 
terms of time to progression and overall survival. Results from this randomised, 
double-blind, Phase 3 FALCON study therefore add to the extensive data on the 
efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in patients with advanced breast cancer, and 
consolidates evidence for superior efficacy for fulvestrant over anastrozole 
demonstrated earlier in the FIRST study. 
 
  
Page 20 
Implications of all the available evidence 
The results of the FALCON study confirm that a SERD is a more efficacious 
treatment than a third-generation AI, which is the standard-of-care in first-line 
endocrine therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. 
These findings consolidate the known clinical effectiveness of fulvestrant and support 
the use of fulvestrant monotherapy in endocrine-naïve patients with hormone receptor-
positive advanced breast cancer. As such, the FALCON study results have important 
implications for clinical practice.
