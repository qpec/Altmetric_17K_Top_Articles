Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a safe and effective vector for
gene therapy for retinal disorders. Gene therapy for hearing
disorders is not as advanced, in part because gene delivery to
sensory hair cells of the inner ear is inefficient. Although
AAV transduces the inner hair cells of the mouse cochlea, outer
hair cells remain refractory to transduction. Here, we demon-
strate that a vector, exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV), is a
potent carrier of transgenes to all inner ear hair cells. Exo-
AAV1-GFP is more efficient than conventional AAV1-GFP,
both in mouse cochlear explants in vitro and with direct
cochlear injection in vivo. Exo-AAV shows no toxicity in vivo,
as assayed by tests of auditory and vestibular function. Finally,
exo-AAV1 gene therapy partially rescues hearing in a mouse
model of hereditary deafness (lipoma HMGIC fusion part-
ner-like 5/tetraspan membrane protein of hair cell stereocilia
[Lhfpl5/Tmhs�/�]). Exo-AAV is a powerful gene delivery sys-
tem for hair cell research and may be useful for gene therapy
for deafness.
INTRODUCTION
Hearing loss, congenital or acquired (most commonly age-related hear-
ing loss), is a major health issue that affects approximately 30 million
people in the United States alone1 compared to about 5.4 million for
Alzheimer’s disease.2 Congenital hearing loss has an incidence of about
1:1,000 births,3 of which about half have a defined genetic cause.
Because the cochlea is surgically accessible and local application into
a relatively immune-protected environment is possible, gene therapy
using viral vectors is an attractive approach for treating hearing loss.
For congenital recessive deafness, gene addition is possible, whereas
congenital dominant forms might be treated by silencing or correcting
the mutated gene.4 Gene therapy also holds promise for age-related
hearing loss by targeting pathways involved in hair cell (HC) or spiral
ganglion neuron survival (e.g., neurotrophic factors5 or antioxidant
proteins6,7) or by manipulating gene expression in supporting cells to
induce their transdifferentiation into hair cells.8 For congenital hered-
itary hearing loss, at least 70 genes are causative in humans. In many
cases, they affect the function of hair cells, the receptor cells of the inner
ear. The cochlea has two types of hair cells. Inner hair cells (IHCs)
convert the mechanical stimulus of sound vibration into a neural signal
that is transmitted by type I spiral ganglion neurons to the brain. Outer
hair cells (OHCs) connect only to poorly defined type II neurons. Their
main function is to amplify the vibration produced by sound by as
much as 60 decibels (dB) in a frequency-specific manner, and they
are essential for frequency discrimination9 (important in speech
perception). Most deafness genes known to affect hair cell function
are expressed in both cell types, so, in general, gene therapy strategy
should target both IHCs and OHCs. Hair cells in the vestibular system
are essential for our sense of balance and for coordinating eye move-
ments. They are often affected in hereditary deafness so gene therapies
should target them as well.
The major limitation of gene therapy for the cochlea is the relative in-
efficiency of vectors that mediate transgene expression in hair cells.
Several gene delivery strategies have targeted sensory cells in the co-
chlea, including viral and non-viral methods (see Kohrman and
Raphael10 and Sacheli et al.11 for review). As yet, however, none of
these has led to efficient transgene expression in hair cells. Adeno-
associated virus (AAV) vectors are presently the most promising vec-
tors for cochlear gene delivery, but in vivo transduction is mostly
limited to IHCs. In previous studies,12,13 virtually no OHCs were
transduced by AAV vectors after in vivo injection in mice. Similarly,
it is difficult to express genes in hair cells in vitro for research, which
has slowed characterization of proteins involved in hair cell function.
There is, therefore, a great need for a vector system that effectively

 transduces both IHCs and OHCs, both in vitro and in vivo. It would
pave the way to clinical trials, and would also be useful in studying
hair cell physiology.
In this work, we tested exosome-associated AAV vectors (exo-AAVs)
for delivery to cochlear hair cells and compared different injection
routes to the cochlea in mice. Exosomes are cell-derived natural lipid
structures involved in intercellular communication and are potential
therapeutic carriers of nucleic acids and proteins (see Fitzpatrick
et al.14 and György et al.15). We previously observed that exosome as-
sociation of AAV enhances transduction of cells in vitro and
in vivo,16,17 so we hypothesized that exosomes would also augment
gene delivery into cochlear hair cells.
We demonstrate here that exo-AAV vectors are efficient carriers of
transgenes into cochlear and vestibular hair cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Exo-AAV vectors outperform conventional AAV vectors in
gene transfer efficiency and are well tolerated. Furthermore, we
show that exo-AAV is useful as a gene therapy system, partially
rescuing hearing in a mouse model of human deafness (lipoma
HMGIC fusion partner-like 5/tetraspan membrane protein of hair
cell stereocilia [Lhfpl5/Tmhs�/�]).
RESULTS
AAV1 Associates with Exosomes When Vectors Are Isolated
from Ultracentrifuged Cell Culture Medium
Of AAV serotypes, AAV1 (the number denotes the capsid sero-
type) has been reported to be the most effective for cochlear hair
cell transduction in preclinical gene therapy studies.12,13 We there-
fore prepared exo-AAV1 and conventional AAV1. AAV1 and
exo-AAV1 were isolated from the lysate and culture medium of
vector-producing 293T cells, respectively (Figure 1A; see Materials
and Methods). Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and
transmission EM (TEM) in combination with immunogold label-
ing, we qualitatively observed AAV capsids both bound to the
surface of exosomes and in their interiors (Figures 1A and S1A–
S1D). The capsids lining the outer exosome membrane could be
clearly distinguished as surface bound, whereas capsids that appear
“inside” could be above, inside, or below the vesicle within the
TEM section. However, we observed instances of capsids distort-
ing the membrane from the interior of the vesicle, directly con-
firming that at least some of the capsids are indeed on the interior
(Figure S1B).
Exo-AAV Outperforms Conventional AAV in Transgene Delivery
to Cochlear Hair Cells in Explant Cultures
We first assessed transgene delivery efficiency of conventional AAV1
and exo-AAV1 vectors on cochlear explant cultures. Cochleas were
dissected at postnatal day 1 (P1) and placed in organ culture. Vectors
were added to the culture medium 1 day later. We used vectors encod-
ing GFP under the strong hybrid cytomegalovirus (CMV)/chicken
beta actin (CBA) promoter. After culturing the cochleas with the vec-
tors for 3 days (equivalent to age P5), tissues were fixed, labeled with
phalloidin and with antibodies to the hair cell marker myosin VIIa,
and viewed with a confocal microscope.
Exo-AAV1 vector was superior to conventional AAV1 vector in gene
delivery to hair cells (Figures 1B–1E). At 1011 genomic copies (GCs)
per cochlea, conventional AAV1-GFP vector transduced approxi-
mately 20% of IHCs and OHCs, whereas exo-AAV1-GFP transduced
up to 65% of IHCs and 50% of OHCs (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respec-
tively; Figure 1C). We also looked for regional differences in effi-
ciency, and found exo-AAV1 outperformed conventional AAV1 at
both the middle and basal turns of the cochlea (Figure 1D; p < 0.01
for middle and basal turns, not significant for apical turn).
We also tested another serotype, AAV9, as both exo-AAV9 and con-
ventional AAV9. At 1011 GCs/cochlea, we observed a significant
enhancement of transduction by exo-AAV9 (Figures 1E and S2A).
Strikingly, exo-AAV9 transduced almost 95% of IHCs and OHCs
(Figure 1E). We conclude that both exo-AAV1 and exo-AAV9 vec-
tors significantly enhance both IHC and OHC transduction in
cochlear explant cultures compared to conventional AAV vectors.
Exo-AAV Outperforms Conventional AAV in Transgene Delivery
to Cochlear Hair Cells In Vivo
These results indicate that exo-AAVs can be powerful gene-delivery
vehicles for in vitro experimental work, but they may not reflect the
in vivo performance needed for therapy. We therefore compared con-
ventional AAV1 and exo-AAV1 in vivo using direct injections into
P0/P1 mouse cochleas. We compared two injection routes: through
the round window membrane (RWM) into the scala tympani (used
in two animal models of hereditary deafness12,13), and through the
lateral wall of the cochlea by cochleostomy at the basal turn.
In both cases, 250 nL of virus-containing solution was injected
over �10 min.
Conventional AAV1-GFP transduced some IHCs but few OHCs.
Cochleostomy delivery of conventional AAV1 vector resulted in
only 36% GFP-positive IHCs and 17% GFP-positive OHCs (Figures
2A and 2B). Upon RWM injection, we observed more GFP-positive
IHCs (up to 65%) but fewer OHCs (�14%) (Figures 2A and 2B).
With either route, however, exo-AAV1-GFP vectors significantly
enhanced gene delivery. When delivered by cochleostomy, exo-
AAV transduced 63% of IHCs and 28% of OHCs. With RWM injec-
tion, 88% of IHCs and 25% of OHCs were transduced (Figures 2A
and 2B).
As reported by Askew et al.,13 cochlear injection of P0 mouse pups is
difficult, causing significant variability in transduction. Our results
(Figures 2B–2D) include all of the injected mice (n = 38 for cochleos-
tomy; n = 23 for RWM), even those with very low transduction effi-
ciency that may result from unsuccessful injection. In our best injec-
tions with exo-AAV vectors, we observed >95% IHCs and �50%
OHCs transduced with our working dose (250 nL, containing 5 �
109 genomic copies of AAV). The best cases of the cochleostomy
and RWM injections had similar hair cell transduction rates.

 However, in our hands, cochleostomy results were more variable and
there were more instances with very low GFP expression.
Because GFP expression in individual hair cells may vary with multi-
ple AAV genomes being delivered, we quantified GFP intensity using
automated image analysis. Among GFP-positive IHCs, average GFP
fluorescence intensity per cell was 70% higher with exo-AAV than
with conventional AAV, with either cochleostomy or RWM injection
(p < 0.01 for cochleostomy and p < 0.05 for RWM injection; Fig-
ure 2C). For OHCs, no significant difference in GFP intensity per
cell was evident between exo-AAV1 and conventional AAV1.
For cochleostomy, transduction rates varied with distance from the
injection site. We counted more transduced hair cells in the base
(near the injection site) than in the apex (Figure 2D). The gradient
was particularly steep and significant for OHCs, with only a few
OHCs transduced at the apex (repeated-measures ANOVA for the
entire dataset to analyze the relationship between location and trans-
duction; p = 0.0009 for AAV1 and p = 0.02 for exo-AAV1). With
RWM injection, however, there was no significant gradient, suggest-
ing that the virus can diffuse more freely with this approach. Overall,
in all subregions tested, with both injection routes, exo-AAV1 signif-
icantly outperformed conventional AAV1 (Figure 2D).
With cochleostomy injections of either conventional or exo-AAV1,
we also observed robust expression of GFP in spiral ganglion neurons,
cells in the inner sulcus, Claudius cells, and Hensen cells (Figure S3).
Surprisingly, GFP-positive hair cells were also evident in the utricle
and in the ampullas of the lateral semicircular canals following

 exo-AAV administration by either cochleostomy (Figure S4) or
RWM injection (Figures 3A and 3B). In the utricle after RWM injec-
tion, exo-AAV1 transduced 30% of hair cells (Figure 3C), 2.3 times
more than conventional AAV1 (p < 0.05, Mann Whitney U test),
indicating some level of diffusion throughout endolymphatic com-
partments at that age. Several myosinVIIa-negative cells (supporting
cells) were also transduced with either vector. Thus, exo-AAV vectors
also have the potential for gene delivery to the vestibular system.
Because exo-AAV9 outperformed exo-AAV1 in vitro, we also tested
AAV9 in vivo. Transduction rates in vivo were similar between exo-
AAV1 and exo-AAV9, with AAV9 targeting 60% of IHCs and 25% of
OHCs after injection (Figure S2B).

using three different litters for each vector and different exo-AAV preparations, with 38 mice/cochleas in total. For RWM injection, we performed the injections on two separate

Exo-AAV1 Gene Delivery Partially Rescues
Hearing in Lhfpl5–/– Mice
We next tested the ability of exo-AAV to pro-
duce efficient expression of a biologically rele-
vant gene, asking whether exo-AAV1 could
improve hearing in a mouse model for human
hereditary deafness. We selected a mouse with
a targeted deletion of Lhfpl5 (also known as
Tmhs). LHFPL5 protein is an integral compo-
nent of the mechanotransduction machinery
in both OHCs and IHCs, and its absence leads
to early hair cell degeneration, profound deaf-
ness,
and
severe
vestibular
dysfunction.18
Because this model is on the C57BL/6 back-
ground and our previous gene transfer experi-
ments were performed on CD1 mice, we tested whether exo-AAV
transduces hair cells with the same efficiency on the C57BL/6 back-
ground. We did not observe any differences between CD1 and
C57BL/6 transduction rates using exo-AAV1-GFP (Figure S5).
Although results were variable, we noted that some of the C57BL/6
animals showed very efficient transduction (>95% IHC and >85%
OHC transduction; Figure S6), which was never achieved with con-
ventional AAV1.
For gene-addition therapy, a mouse-codon-optimized gene encoding
LHFPL5 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus was cloned
into an AAV vector backbone under the CBA promoter (Figure S7A).
When this exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 was produced in HEK293T cells,

 anti-HA immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed bands of the ex-
pected molecular weight for LHFPL5 (Figure S7B).
Next, we tested whether this construct restores function in cochlear
explant cultures from Lhfpl5�/� animals. Exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5
restored FM1-43 loading in explant cultures (indicating the presence
of functional mechanotransduction channels) (Figure 4A). In addi-
tion, anti-HA labeling was present in hair cell stereocilia (Figure 4B).
We quantified average FM1-43 signal in cochlear explants from
Lhfpl5+/� mice, Lhfpl5�/� mice, and Lhfpl5�/� mice transduced in
culture with two different doses of exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5. The
average FM1-43 fluorescence intensity per hair cell in Lhfpl5�/� co-
chlea was comparable to the background intensity in an area without
hair cells. In Lhfpl5�/� cochleas transduced by exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5
vector, FM1-43 intensity was 70% of the Lhfpl5+/� positive control at
the highest tested dose (Figure 4C). FM1-43 intensity increased from
apex to base in exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5-treated Lhfpl5�/� cultures, a
gradient similar to that seen with the GFP reporter (Figure 1D). At
all points, cellular FM1-43 intensity levels were significantly higher
than in untreated Lhfpl5�/� cultures (Figure 4D). At the base,
FM1-43 intensity was as high in exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5-treated
Lhfpl5�/� cultures as in heterozygous positive controls (Figure 4D).
These data confirmed that the construct was functional and that
the HA tag allowed specific detection of the transgene.
Next, we injected exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 into the cochlea by RWM
injection at P1 to P2. RWM injection was used rather than cochleos-
tomy because it was less variable in our hands. Furthermore, we
could use a higher volume and therefore dose using RWM injection,
and there was less of base-to-apex decrease in transduction with
RMW injection compared to cochleostomy (Figure 2D). For in vivo
injection, we administered the maximum injectable volume based on
preliminary experiments: 1,200 nL (containing 2.7 � 109 GCs).
Several days later, we dissected cochleas and cultured them for 1 to
2 days before viewing. Anti-HA immunostaining at P4+2 showed
distinct signal in stereociliary bundles of both IHCs and OHCs (Fig-
ure 5A). High magnification images revealed anti-HA staining at the
tips of stereocilia, including the tallest row, in agreement with the
previously reported localization of native LHFPL518 (Figure 5B).
We confirmed that exo-AAV-transduced IHCs and OHCs have
functional mechanotransduction, as assessed by FM1-43 loading
(Figure 5C). We assessed the efficiency of exo-AAV transduction
by counting the hair cells with anti-HA labeling at the bundle and
found that 72 ± 17% of IHCs and 30 ± 5% of OHCs exhibited bundle
staining,

nearly
equal
distribution

the

(Figure 5D).
We also tested AAV-HA-Lhfpl5-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-
GFP packaged in exo-AAV1. This allows co-expression of LHFPL5

 and GFP in the same cell. Importantly, all GFP-positive cells exhibited
anti-HA staining, confirming specificity of the anti-HA antibody
(Figure S8). Some GFP-negative cells also showed anti-HA bundle
staining, which may be due to weak translation downstream of the
IRES, making GFP undetectable.
To determine whether exo-AAV-mediated gene transfer impairs
normal hearing, we tested heterozygous animals injected with exo-
AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 by RWM injection. RWM injection did not alter
hearing thresholds, as measured by auditory brainstem evoked re-
sponses (ABRs) (Figure 6B) or change ABR P1 or P2 peak amplitudes
(Figure 6C), confirming that both the procedure and the vectors are
safe at early ages.
Next, we tested physiological rescue of hearing in deaf mice injected
with exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 and performed ABR recordings at
4 weeks post-injection using frequencies from 4 to 45 kHz (Figures
6A–6C). Uninjected Lhfpl5�/� animals did not show detectable
ABRs at any sound pressure level (SPL) up to 100 dB (Figure 6A).
In Lhfpl5�/� animals injected through the RWM with exo-AAV1-
HA-Lhfpl5, we observed improved hearing thresholds at frequencies
from 4 to 22 kHz (Figure 6B) in 9 out of 12 animals. The four an-
imals with the best rescue showed thresholds of �70 dB SPL at 8

and 11 kHz, an improvement of �30 dB. We
never detected ABRs for sound presented to
the non-injected side. Although we did not
directly analyze gene transfer in the non-in-
jected ear, the ABR data suggest that any
gene transfer to the contralateral ear is mini-
mal using this injection protocol. Nevertheless,
we have previously reported low levels of gene
transfer to inner ear hair cells after intravenous
injection of exo-AAV in adult mice, suggesting
that it may be possible to transduce both ears under certain
conditions.19
Theaveragepeak2 amplitudesat 90dBSPLwere0.88± 0.18and0.84±
0.12 mV (mean ± SEM) at 8 and 11 kHz, respectively, which is approx-
imately 25% of those in normal heterozygotes (Figure 6C). Latencies of
peak 1 and peak 2 were not significantly increased in rescued animals
compared towild-type(WT)animalsat thesameSPL,except at 11 kHz
for peak 1 (Figure 6C; p < 0.01, two-tailed t test). Injected and non-in-
jectedheterozygotesdidnotshowastatisticallysignificantdifference in
the latency of the P1 or P2 ABR peaks (Figure 6C).
We tested the behavioral correlates of hearing and balance in Lhfpl5
knockouts (KOs) rescued with exo-AAV. We first found that rescue
of hearing by exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 was sufficient to elicit a startle
response to a loud clap, a standard test of hearing (Movie S1).
Head bobbing and circling are common traits of Lhfpl5 KO mice and
may reflect abnormal vestibular function.20–22 Because GFP-positive
hair cells were also evident in vestibular sensory epithelia, suggesting
vector diffusion to the vestibular system (Figure 3), we performed
behavioral tests in treated (injected through the RWM with exo-
AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5) and nontreated Lhfpl5 KO mice. We performed

 an open field test, in which animals were placed in a circular arena for
5 min. Normal heterozygous mice showed gait and head stability and
normal explorative behavior (Movie S2). On the contrary, Lhfpl5�/�
mice exhibited frequent head tossing, gait instability, backward move-
ment, and circling. Five out of 12 exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5-treated
Lhfpl5�/� animals did not exhibit head tossing, indicating rescue of
balance function. Averaging all animals, we found head tossing was
significantly decreased in the treated Lhfpl5�/� animals compared
to the untreated animals (Figure 6D) (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U
test). Similarly, circling was analyzed using computerized image anal-
ysis. Treated Lhfpl5�/� animals exhibited significantly fewer 360� ro-
tations compared to untreated animals (Figure 6D) (p < 0.05, Mann-
Whitney U test). These results confirm that hearing and the abnormal
movements characteristic of compromised balance in these mice are
improved after exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 gene therapy.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that exosome-associated AAV transduces
cochlear and vestibular hair cells with much greater efficiency than
do conventional AAV vectors. Prior studies had shown some trans-
duction of IHCs with conventional AAVs, but little transduction of
OHCs.12,23 We found that exo-AAV1 efficiently transduces IHCs
and transduces OHCs much more efficiently than does conventional
AAV1. AAV1 was our standard of comparison because it has been
used in prior studies of hearing gene therapy.12,13 In those studies,
it was shown to only transduce inner hair cells relatively efficiently.
Interestingly, we found that exo-AAV9-GFP was extremely efficient
at transduction of cochlear explant cultures, although, in vivo, this
serotype performed similarly to exo-AAV1.
In order to determine whether the efficient reporter gene levels in
HCs achieved with exo-AAV could be translated to expression of
HC-relevant genes, we tested exo-AAV-mediated expression of
Lhfpl5 in deaf Lhfpl5�/� mice. After RWM injection, we found wide-
spread expression of HA-tagged LHFPL5 throughout the cochlea.
Treated Lhfpl5�/� mice were able to respond to sound, as measured

 Although this is an important step forward in strategies of gene ther-
apy for deafness, hearing restoration was not complete. It may be that
the window of therapeutic intervention is limited for Lhfpl5. LHFPL5
is expressed in mice beginning about E16.5, and hair cell degeneration
in the knockout is evident by P8,24 so we may not have expressed the
transgene soon enough (mice were injected with vector at P0 or P1). It
may also be that the HA tag, used for immunostaining, interfered to
some extent with the protein function. An untagged Lhfpl5 could be
expressed in future studies. Nevertheless, we achieved hearing thresh-
olds that were 20 dB better than in a recent rescue of Tmc1 deficiency
with conventional AAV1.13 Although we did not test distortion prod-
uct otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), a measure of OHC function
in vivo, we did confirm OHC transduction by immunostaining for
the HA tag and FM1-43 loading. Further DPOAE measurements
will be necessary to confirm functional OHC mechanotransduction.
Interestingly, the best rescue was in the 8–11 kHz range, as also found
by Askew et al.13 Vector transduction efficiency was relatively even
along the cochlea, so this frequency-dependent rescue could be
because mouse hearing is normally most sensitive in that range.
In a similar study, Akil et al. used a conventional AAV vector to
achieve robust hearing rescue in VGLUT3 KO mice.12 However,
the VGLUT3 KO only affects inner hair cells, not outer hair cells,
and so is easily rescued by conventional AAV1. Indeed, the authors
show that virtually no outer hair cells were transduced with conven-
tional AAV1. In contrast, exo-AAV allows efficient transduction of
outer hair cells as well, and is thus applicable to the great majority
of deafness genes that are required for function in both inner and
outer hair cells. In gene therapies in which both hair cell types require
correction, conventional AAV1 will likely not suffice.
The published behavioral phenotype of Tmhs (Lhfpl5) mutant mice
is circling and abnormal head movements, such as shaking and
tossing, which are indicative of a balance disorder.24 We observed
that exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5-treated Lhfpl5 KO mice had improve-
ments in both circling and head tossing behavior. We also observed
robust transduction of hair cells in the vestibular system in these
mice. Together, this may suggest a rescue of balance dysfunction
in these mice, although further testing using measurements
such as vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) could be done to
confirm this.
We used self-complementary (sc) AAV vector genomes in our trans-
duction comparisons between exo-AAV and AAV (Figures 2 and 3)
as well as for rescue experiments (Figure 6). Sc genomes are geneti-
cally engineered variants of the natural single-stranded (ss) AAV
genome,25,26 which give rise to complementary, half-sized AAV ge-
nomes that fold into a double-stranded-like structure. Sc genomes
are thought to bypass the second-strand synthesis step required for
transcription of transgenes from ssAAV vectors. Bypassing this step
generally leads to an earlier onset and more robust level of transgene
expression, although it comes with the cost of reduced cassette size
(�2.4 kb compared to 4.7 kb for ss vectors). That said, many genes
fit into sc vectors, including Lhfpl5, and a scAAV vector is in clinical
trials for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (clinicaltrials.gov).
It may be promising for certain deafness genes.
Exo-AAV is relatively easy to purify,19 allowing rapid production of
several different constructs for experimental testing. In contrast,
purification of conventional AAV is a more complicated and time-
consuming process. Also, it is important to note that if new AAV cap-
sids with enhanced transduction in hair cells are discovered, they can
be incorporated into the exo-AAV system for a potentially even better
performance.
In conclusion, we show that exo-AAV vectors are efficient delivery
vehicles for mammalian hair cells of the inner ear, both in vitro
and in vivo. Exo-AAV-mediated genetic modification of inner and
outer hair cells should facilitate elucidation of the basic biology of
hair cells, and represents a promising avenue for gene therapy for hu-
man hereditary deafness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All experiments were performed in compliance with ethical regula-
tions and approved by the Animal Care Committee of Harvard Med-
ical School. For in vitro and in vivo studies, we used CD1 mice
(Charles River), which were housed and bred in the animal facility
at Harvard Medical School. Wild-type C57BL/6 animals were ordered
from Charles River. Lhfpl5 heterozygous and homozygous KO ani-
mals were housed and bred in our facility. Male and female mice
were randomly chosen for study. Pilot experiments allowed us to es-
timate the sample size for the animal experiments.
Genotyping
For genotyping, we used the following primers: wild-type exon 2 for-
ward: TGACTGCTGGATCTCAGTGC; wild-type exon 2 reverse:
GTTTGGCTGCTGGTCTTAGC; Lhfpl5 KO forward: TAGCAGG-
CATGCTGGGGATG; Lhfpl5 KO reverse: TCCGCTGATGGCC
TTTCTCA. PCR conditions were as follows: 95�C for 2 min, followed
by nine cycles of 95�C for 30 s, 66�C for 30 s (�1�C/cycle), and 72�C
for 30 s, then 25 cycles of 95�C for 30 s, 57�C for 30 s, and 72�C for 30
s, and finally 75�C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated on an
agarose gel. Lhfpl5�/� allele shows a 238-bp band. Wild-type allele
shows a 577-bp band.
Vector Preparation
We isolated conventional AAV and exo-AAV vectors from trans-
fected HEK293T cells, as previously described.16,17 For each produc-
tion, we plated two 15-cm tissue culture dishes with 1.5 � 107
HEK293T cells. The next day, cells were transfected using the calcium
phosphate method, with the adenovirus helper plasmid (pAdDF6,27
26 mg), rep/cap plasmid (pXR128 for AAV1, pAR9 for AAV9,
12 mg) and inverted terminal repeats (ITR)-flanked transgene cassette
plasmid (10 mg) to induce production of AAV. All plasmids were ob-
tained from the Massachusetts General Hospital virus vector core.
Plasmids were diluted in 780 mL with 2.5 mM HEPES and 2 M
calcium chloride and then added drop-wise into 780 mL 2x

Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 2 February 2017 387
 HEPES-buffered saline (280 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, and 1.5 mM
Na2HPO4, pH 7.04) while vortexing in 15-mL tubes. The mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 20 min before adding it to cells
drop-wise. The day after transfection, medium was changed to
DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The following day,
medium was changed to DMEM containing 2% exosome-free FBS
(made by overnight 100,000 � g ultracentrifugation to deplete bovine
exosomes). Exo-AAV vectors were isolated from the media 3 days af-
ter transfection using differential centrifugation as described before.16
Cells were depleted at 300 � g for 5 min and 1,000 � g for 10 min.
Next, larger extracellular vesicles (apoptotic bodies, microvesicles)
were removed by a 20,000 � g spin for 60 min. The supernatant
from the 20,000 � g spin was subjected to 100,000 � g centrifugation
using a type 70 Ti rotor in an Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge for 1.5 hr
(both Beckman Coulter). The exosome pellet was re-suspended in
serum-free, antibiotic-free DMEM medium. Conventional AAVs
were purified from the cell lysate using iodixanol-gradient ultracentri-
fugation. Vectors were stored at �80�C until use. For titration of exo-
AAV vectors, we first treated the titration aliquot with DNase to re-
move plasmid DNA. Next, we isolated all capsid-protected nucleic
acids from the sample using the Roche High Pure Nucleic Acid viral
kit (Roche) in order to remove PCR inhibitors and nucleases poten-
tially present in exosome preparations and to fully lyse the exosomal
membrane. For titration of conventional AAV, we have observed that
the DNase I treatment and downstream nucleic acid purification steps
are not required because the crude cell lysates are treated with Benzo-
nase nuclease to remove plasmid DNA. Titration of standard AAV by
simply diluting the sample before titration or using the DNase I/
Roche High Pure Nucleic Acid viral kit procedure, as for exo-AAV,
yielded identical titers. Finally, we quantified AAV genomic copies
in conventional and exo-AAV preparations using TaqMan qPCR
with BGH polyA-sequence specific primers and probe.17 Titers for
all vectors (AAV and exo-AAV) were in the 2 � 1012 � 1.5 � 1013
GCs/mL range.
AAV Vector Constructs
AAV transgene plasmid (AAV2 inverted terminal repeat [ITR]
flanked) encoding GFP under the hybrid CMV immediate-early/
CBA promoter, AAV-CBA-GFP, was kindly provided by Dr. Miguel
Sena-Esteves (UMass Medical Center). AAV-CBA-GFP is a sc
genome. pAdDF6,27 pXR128 (AAV1), and AAV9 plasmids were all
obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital virus vector
core. We constructed two AAV vectors encoding murine Lhfpl5.
The transgene was designed from the coding region of mRNA of
Mus musculus Lhfpl5 (NCBI reference sequence: NM_026571.2). A
mouse-codon-optimized version of mouse Lhfpl5 with an N-terminal
human influenza HA tag was synthesized and inserted into a cloning
vector (pUC57-Kan) by Genscript. To construct this plasmid, we first
digested sc-AAV-CBA-GFP with HindIII and NheI to remove the
GFP transgene. The pUC57-Kan plasmid was similarly digested to
release codon-optimized, HA-tagged Lhfpl5. This insert was ligated
with the scAAV backbone to create scAAV-CBA-HA-Lhfpl5. A sec-
ond construct was made using an ss AAV plasmid as the backbone.
For this construct, we used the plasmid ssAAV-CBA-IRES-GFP,
which was kindly provided by Dr. Miguel Sena-Esteves. This plasmid
contains a multiple cloning site after the CBA promoter and an IRES-
driven GFP, allowing for co-expression of GFP and a gene of interest.
We digested ssAAV-CBA-IRES-GFP with SpeI and NheI, and de-
phosphorylated the plasmid with calf inositol phosphatase before
agarose gel purification. We PCR amplified HA-Lhfpl5 from
scAAV-CBA-HA-Lhfpl5 using forward and reverse primers flanked
with SpeI and NheI recognition sequences, respectively. The ampli-
fied product was digested overnight with SpeI and NheI and ligated
with similarly digested ssAAV-CBA-IRES-GFP. After restriction
digest screening for correct ligation orientation, ssAAV-CBA-HA-
Lhfpl5-IRES-GFP was generated. Confirmational DNA sequencing
was performed.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Exo-AAV vectors were pelleted and fixed for 30 min in 4% formalde-
hyde in PBS. The pellet was cryoprotected in 2.3 M sucrose in PBS
before it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (approximately
80 nm thick) were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of mouse anti-
AAV1 antibody, which recognizes intact capsids (Clone ADK1a;
American Research Products), followed by a 10-nm gold-conjugated
secondary anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were
acquired with a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron
microscope (FEI Company) in the Harvard Medical School Electron
Microscopy Facility.
Cryo-EM
Cryo-EM was performed on conventional and exo-AAV1 vectors.
Briefly, 4 mL of sample was deposited on electron microscopy grids
coated with a perforated carbon film. After draining the excess liquid
with a filter paper, grids were quickly plunged into liquid ethane and
mounted onto a Gatan 626 cryoholder. Cryo-EM observation was
performed with a Tecnai F20 (Fei Company) microscope operated
at 200 kV, and images were recorded with a USC1000-SSCCD camera
(Gatan).
Immunoblotting
293T cells were transfected for AAV production using scAAV-CBA-
HA-Lhfpl5, as described above. Cells were lysed using M-PER
(mammalian protein extraction reagent) (Thermo Scientific) 5 days
after transfection. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel elec-
trophoresis, and proteins were subsequently transferred to a nitrocel-
lulose membrane. For detection of the HA-tagged LHFPL5, we used a
biotinylated anti-HA antibody (Biolegend, catalog number 901505) at
1:2,000 dilution, followed by streptavidin conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (GE Healthcare, 1:25,000 dilution). Specific antibody
binding was detected by incubating the membrane with Pierce ECL
Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposing autora-
diographic film to the membrane.
Cochlear Culture
To assess viral transduction by different vectors in vitro, we explanted
cochleas from CD1 wild-type mice at P1. Briefly, after dissecting out
the temporal bone, we opened the bone and the cochlear coil from the
Molecular Therapy
388 Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 2 February 2017
 scala vestibuli side. Next, we removed the stria vascularis and de-
tached the coil from the modiolus. The spiral ligament was kept in
place to improve plating of the cochleas. The specimen was plated
onto a glass-bottom dish (P35G-1.5-14-C; Mattek) using a tissue
glue (Cell-Tak, Corning). Cochleas were cultured in DMEM supple-
mented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% N2 supplement (Thermo-
Fischer), and 5 mg/mL carbenicillin. After overnight culture, we added
the vector solution in 200 mL of medium at a dose of 1011 GCs per co-
chlea (unless indicated otherwise). After overnight incubation, we
changed the media and kept the cochleas in culture for 3 more days
to the equivalent of P6.
Cochlear Immunostaining and Imaging
Cochleas were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Fixed
cochleas were washed three times with PBS to remove fixative and
were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and permeabilized with
0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr at 22�C. Primary antibodies
were diluted in 5% normal goat serum (NGS)/0.1% Triton X-100/
PBS and incubated overnight at 4�C. To stain hair cells, we used rabbit
polyclonal anti-myosin VIIa antibody (Proteus Biosciences, 1:500
dilution) with a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary
antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 in a 1:1,000 dilution for 1 hr
(Life Technologies). To stain the hair bundle actin, we used phalloidin
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 544 (Life Technologies) (1:100). To stain
for the HA tag, we used an anti-HA antibody (C29F4, rabbit; Cell
Signaling Technology). GFP was detected with its intrinsic fluores-
cence. Tissues were mounted on a Colorfrost glass slide (Thermo-
Fischer Scientific) using Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium
(Thermo-Fischer). Imaging was performed with an Olympus Fluo-
View 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) using a PlanApoN
60�/1.42NA oil-immersion objective.
FM1-43 Loading
We assessed the ability of hair cells to accumulate the styryl dye FM1-
43 to test functional restoration of hair cell mechanotransduction in
culture. Cultured cochleas were quickly washed twice with Leibovitz’s
L15 medium (GIBCO) and incubated in the presence of 2 mM FM1-
43 dye (Thermo-Fisher) for 30 s. Excess dye was removed by chela-
tion using 0.2 mM SCAS (4-sulfonato calix[8]arene, sodium salt,
from Biotium) for 2 min. Imaging was performed with an upright
Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) using a
LUMPLanFI/IR 60�/1.1 water-dipping objective.
In Vivo Cochlear Injections
For in vivo analysis, we performed procedures on P0 or P1 wild-type
mouse pups of the CD1 strain. After injection, we waited 14 days
before sacrifice to assess vector transduction.
Cochleostomy
P0 to P1 CD1 pups were anesthetized by hypothermia, and then kept
on an ice pack during the procedure. A small incision was made un-
derneath the external ear. The incision was enlarged, and soft tissues
were pushed apart using an eyelid retractor to expose the bulla. The
bulla was then opened, following the stapedial artery, using a
25-mm flattened microprobe. Soft connective tissues were removed
to get access to the lateral wall of the cochlea. A glass pipette was in-
serted through the lateral wall perpendicular to the stria vascularis to
a depth of 300 mm, then 250 nL of solution (containing 5 � 109 GCs of
AAV) was injected at a constant rate of 45 nL/min using a Nanoliter
2000 Injector (World Precision Instruments). We closed surgical in-
cisions with two to three sutures using a 7-0 Vycril surgical suture.
Following surgery, the pups were maintained at 37�C until complete
recovery (10–15 min).
Round Window Membrane Injection
As for cochleostomy, the bulla was exposed and opened. Then, the
round window niche was localized visually. Covering connective tis-
sues were removed in order to expose the round window. We injected
250 nL of vector solution at a rate of 45 nL/min for adequate compar-
ison with cochleostomy (introducing 5 � 109 GCs of AAV for GFP
expression experiments). For rescue experiments, we injected 1–
1.2 mL of the exo-AAV1-HA-Lhfpl5 construct into the ear (2.7 �
109 GCs). We closed surgical incisions with two to three sutures using
a 7-0 Vycril surgical suture.
Image Analysis
To compare transduction efficiency between conventional AAV and
exo-AAV, we determined the percentage of GFP-positive hair cells
and the intensity of GFP expression. To determine the percentage
of GFP-positive cells, we manually counted GFP-positive and GFP-
negative cells in in vitro cultures for three regions in each cochlea
(approximately 120 hair cells/image). For in vivo injections, we
captured eight high-magnification images along the cochlea at exactly
the same distance from the base for all cochleas. Then, in each case, an
investigator blinded to the vector used counted all visible hair cells on
four of the images (always using the locations) and determined the
percentage of GFP-positive cells. For intensity determination, we
used Imaris 8.1 software (Bitplane AG). Briefly, we segmented indi-
vidual hair cells based on myosin VIIa fluorescence and quantified
GFP fluorescence in IHCs and OHCs separately. Measurements
were normalized to the GFP intensity values from hair cells in non-
injected cochleas, which were segmented the same way. We only
counted GFP-positive hair cells (scored as having a GFP intensity 2
SDs above the mean background) to avoid transduction rate as a con-
founding variable. To quantify FM1-43 fluorescence intensity on
z-stacks of images, we used ImageJ 1.46r software. When comparing
different groups, we always used the same imaging settings, including
zoom settings, pixel ratio, and z-step size.
Auditory Brainstem Response
The ABR assay was performed using a Tucker Davis Technologies
workstation (System III; TDT). Mice were anesthetized by intraperi-
toneal injection of a ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) cock-
tail. Anesthetized mice were then placed on a heating pad, and
electrodes were placed subcutaneously in the vertex, underneath the
left or right ear, and on the back near the tail. Tone stimuli of 4,
5.6, 8, 11.2, 16, 22, 32, and 45.3 kHz were calibrated with a precision
microphone system (PS9200 Kit; ACO Pacific) using the TDT SigCal

 software package. The recorded signals were band-pass filtered
(300 Hz to 3 kHz) and amplified 100,000 times. The number of acqui-
sition trials was set to 500 averages. Maximum stimulus intensity was
set to a 95-dB peak SPL, with attenuation decreasing from 85 dB to
0 dB SPL at 5-dB intervals. Band-pass filters (500–3,000 Hz) were
applied to the traces before analysis.

A simple startle response was performed. Briefly, animals were placed
in an opaque white bucket and allowed to equilibrate for several mi-
nutes in quiet. An investigator performed a hand clap, which was not
visible to the animals. The animals were filmed by a Panasonic
HCV550 camera at the age of 4 weeks. Lhfpl5 knockout animals never
responded.
Open Field Test and Behavioral Function Quantification
We used a 37-cm-diameter arena with low and even illumination.
Animals were tested at the age of 6 weeks. Animals were placed on
the side of the arena and were filmed for 5 min. After each mouse,
the arena was cleaned to avoid olfactory distractions. To quantify
head tossing and circling, videos were analyzed by two investigators
who were blinded to the genotype or the injection status of the ani-
mals. For head tossing, 3 separate min were counted and averaged
for each investigator. The average scores assigned by each separate
investigator showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman r =
0.86, p = 1.76 � 10�11). Circling was quantified using the Ethovision
XT software package (Noldus). We counted full circle rotations dur-
ing a 5-min observation period (360� turns in either the clockwise or
counterclockwise direction).
Head tossing and circling behavior were tested at 2 separate days. The
results between the 2 days showed a strong correlation (Spearman
test, for head tossing: rho = 0.7, p < 0.05; for circling: rho = 0.85,
p < 0.001).
Statistics
To compare two non-related sample groups, we used a t test for two
independent samples or a Mann-Whitney U test. For normality
testing, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test. For correlations, we used
Spearman correlation. To test the relationship between the location
on the cochlea and virus transduction, we performed the repeated-
measures ANOVA test. For statistical testing, we used the GraphPad
Prism software. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
