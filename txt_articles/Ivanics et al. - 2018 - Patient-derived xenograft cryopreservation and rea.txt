Introduction
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are being increasingly utilized in preclinical oncologic research. 
Maintaining large colonies of early generation tumor-bearing mice is impractical and cost-
prohibitive. Optimal methods for efficient long-term cryopreservation and subsequent reanimation 
of PDX tumors are critical to any viable PDX program. We sought to compare the performance of 
“Standard” and “Specialized” cryoprotectant media on various cryopreservation and reanimation 
outcomes in PDX tumors. Standard (10% DMSO media) and Specialized (Cryostor®) media were 
compared between overall and matched PDX tumors. Primary outcome was reanimation 
engraftment efficiency (REE). Secondary outcomes included time-to-tumor-formation (TTF), 
time-to-harvest (TTH), and potential loss of unique PDX lines. Overall 57 unique PDX tumors 
underwent 484 reanimation engraftment attempts after previous cryopreservation. There were 10 
unique PDX tumors cryopreserved with Standard (71 attempts), 40 with Specialized (272 
attempts), and 7 with both (141 attempts). Median frozen time of reanimated tumors was 29 weeks 
(max.177). Tumor pathology, original primary PDX growth rates, frozen storage times, and 
number of implantations per PDX model were similar between cryoprotectant groups. Specialized 
media resulted in superior REE (overall: 82% vs. 39%, p<0.0001; matched: 97% vs. 36%, 
p<0.0001; >52 weeks cryostorage: 59% vs. 9%, p<0.0001), shorter TTF (overall 24 vs. 54 days, 
p=0.0051; matched 18 vs. 53 days, p=0.0013) and shorter TTH (overall: 64 vs. 89 days, p=0.009; 
matched: 47 vs. 88 days, p=0.0005) compared to Standard. Specialized media demonstrated 
improved REE with extended duration cryostorage (p=0.048) compared to Standard. Potential loss 
of unique PDX lines was lower with Specialized media (9% vs. 35%, p=0.017). In conclusion,

Introduction
Contemporary translational oncology research requires appropriate preclinical models that 
can recapitulate the human cancer phenotype. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) is one such 
model that are created by implanting freshly obtained tumors from individual patients using 
either surgical resection specimens or biopsy material into immunocompromised mice and 
represent a novel approach to the study of human malignancy.1–5 These PDX tumors 
accurately recapitulate the histologic features of the patient tumors from which they are 
derived and maintain the biological heterogeneity present in human cancer.1,6,7 Furthermore, 
they maintain their biological similarity to the original patient tumors from which they were 
derived in early generation passage and this has been demonstrated via gene expression 
profiling, copy number variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and chromosomal 
stability, making this model particularly ideal for preclinical studies due to limited genetic 
drift.1,6–10 The results of in vivo treatment studies in these models have shown improved 
correlation with actual patient tumor response compared to other traditional methods such as 
cell-line based or transgenic animal models.2,11–14 Furthermore, PDX models have also 
shown potential to predict clinical recurrence several months prior to conventional 
surveillance modalities in patients having undergone curative intent surgery and as such they 
can be used to predict the natural history of tumor and response to therapy.15–17
Any program that utilizes PDX requires optimized methods to create, maintain, and 
successfully store such a valuable research platform for future experimentation. Following 
successful engraftment and establishment of original first generation (F1) tumor bearing 
mice, PDX tumors can be expanded and amplified into subsequent later generations (F2, F3, 
etc.) for amplification of primary patient tumor tissue as well as for the purpose of planned 
formal large scale in vivo treatment investigations. However maintaining a large number of 
living tumor-bearing mice is not logistically or financially feasible for high-volume 
programs or labs with limited resources. A method to facilitate the delayed use of previously 
generated early generation xenografts is cryopreservation.18–21 This process entails freezing 
biological tissue for extended periods and is made possible with the use of cryoprotectant 
solutions that facilitate maintenance of cellular viability. Applying this method to PDX 
tumors allows for long-term storage of a living but frozen biobank of early generation PDX 
tumors with the ability to thaw and reimplant, or “reanimate”, the tumors at any future time 
point based on demand. Reliable techniques to cryopreserve, store, and reanimate PDX 
tumors are a critical component of any successful xenograft program and provide a 
safeguard against the loss of highly precious and irreplaceable primary patient tumor tissue 
over the course of time. Prevention of cellular injury during the cryopreservation process is

 the largest biological obstacle. In order to prevent such freezing injury various 
cryoprotectants such as glycerol, ethanediol, propanediol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
have been used for stable freezing and long-term preservation of established cell lines and 
tissues.22–27 Cryopreservation of primary patient tumor and subsequent PDX has been 
investigated previously, but the efficacy of reanimation has typically been low, or not 
reported.23,24,28,29 Cryopreservation of composite tissues, such as PDX tumors, is more 
complex than for homogenous cell lines as a three-dimensional architecture needs to be 
maintained during both freezing and thawing. As such, tissues are composed of a variety of 
cell types with varying degree of vulnerability to the cryopreservation process.30 While the 
feasibility of cryopreservation is well established, several cryoprotectant agents are utilized, 
either lab-based or commercially available, for varying applications. As a result, the optimal 
method of cryopreservation of PDX tissue remains to be elucidated and given the significant 
amount of resources required for generation of a single patient PDX model, any loss of such 
would have devastating consequences on the viability of any program. Given the incomplete 
and variable knowledge regarding the optimal cryoprotectant for PDX, we sought to evaluate 
a reliable and reproducible method of cryopreservation and reanimation of PDX tumor tissue 
using pancreatic cancer PDXs.
The most common standard cryopreservation media is a combination of varying cell culture 
media, serum albumin (10%), and DMSO (10%), which has a composition similar to the 
extracellular fluid compartment and is used in most laboratories with varying concentrations 
for cryopreservation of biological tissues.31 Cryostor™ is a specialized commercially 
available serum and protein-free cryoprotectant solution (10% DMSO) but which has a 
composition similar to the intracellular fluid compartment.31 This product was designed to 
mitigate temperature induced cell stress responses by scavenging free radicals, pH buffering, 
provides oncotic/osmotic support, energy substrates, and ionic concentrations that balance 
the intracellular state at ultra-low temperature environments (−80°C to −196°C).21,31–33 As 
this specialized media was specifically developed for the cryopreservation of extremely 
sensitive and vulnerable cell populations (human embryonic and pluripotent stem cells) we 
compared cryopreservation and subsequent reanimation engraftment outcomes between 
standard laboratory cryoprotectant media used in most PDX programs and this specialized 
media.
Materials and Methods
Original F1 PDX creation/Tumor engraftment
Data was obtained retrospectively from 2 high volume surgeon-directed PDX programs at 
Mayo Clinic and MD Anderson Cancer Center whose combined engraftment experience 
over 5 years is in excess of 500 unique cancer patients and subsequent derived PDX models 
with pancreatic adenocarcinoma representing the most common histologic cancer subtype. 
Following a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The University of Texas MD Anderson 
Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, patients undergoing curative-intent 
resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma or radiologic biopsy of metastatic lesions consented 
participation for generation of PDX tumors. Using previously reported methods, fresh

 minimally ischemic (< 30–60 min) tumor tissue was obtained immediately after pathologic 
examination.3 Once histologic confirmation of cancer had been made pathology, fresh tumor 
tissue was placed in a 50 ml falcon tube containing 25 ml RPMI media with 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. The media-containing tumor was placed on ice and transferred rapidly to an 
animal procedure room. 6–8 week old female NOD/SCID mice were placed in a mouse 
induction chamber and anesthetized using 1–3% Isofluorane with oxygen supplementation. 
The medium from the falcon tube was discarded and the tumor samples were placed on a 
sterile Petri dish on ice. The tumor sample was sliced into small fragments of 1–2 mm in 
maximum dimension to allow diffusion and enable viability. 400 μl of Matrigel ® 
(Corning®) was added to the tumor fragments so that they were fully immersed in order to 
increase primary engraftment efficiency.34,35 The areas of incision were disinfected with 70–
100% ethanol. Incisions were made using sterile scissors just above the hind flank of the 
mouse and slightly enlarged with blunt dissection to allow a tissue pocket to be created 
under the hind flank lymphatic fat pad, and a tumor tissue fragment was implanted into the 
created tissue pocket. The incision was approximated with either interrupted sutures or a 
bioglue (Vetbond™). If enough primary patient tumor was available, similar primary 
engraftment was performed on the contralateral side. In general at least 5 mice were 
engrafted for each unique individual PDX sample to maximize probability of primary (F1) 
PDX engraftment. PDX growth metrics were recorded and included the time from 
implantation to the first time a growing tumor is palpated (i.e. 3–4mm) in the mouse and is 
referred to as the time-to-tumor-formation (TTF).36 (Figure 1) The time from implantation 
to the harvest of tumor (typically when tumors reach 15mm in greatest dimension) is 
referred to as the time-to-harvest (TTH). Harvested PDX tumors are then processed with 
portions sent for histologic confirmation by GI oncologic pathologists. (Figure 2)
Cryopreservation
At the time of the F1 PDX harvest, engrafted PDX tumors were sliced into 5×2mm pieces 
with a sterile scalpel blade. This dimension facilitates optimal absorption of cryoprotectant 
into the tumors, for uniform freezing temperature throughout the sample, and secures 
enough tumor tissue to subsequently be re-engrafted into 5 mice upon reanimation. The 
sliced tumors (1–2 slices per vial) were placed in plastic screw top cryopreservation vials 
(Thermo Scientific) preloaded with 1.5 ml of either Standard cryopreservation media 
containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with 10% fetal bovine serum and RPMI 
solution or Specialized (Cryostor™ CS10 - BioLife Solutions, Owego, NY, USA) 
cryoprotectant alone. These were labeled and entered into an electronic web-based inventory 
registry according to the PDX ID and generation number (F1, F2 etc.). These vials were 
placed into a Mr. Frosty™ Freezing container (Thermo Scientific) which is subsequently 
placed in a −80°C freezer. These freezing containers contain 100% isopropyl alcohol and 
achieve an ideal rate of cooling near −1°C/min. These freezing chambers are kept in −80°C 
for at least 24–48hrs before transfer to long-term cold storage.
Thawing/Reanimation
Previously deep frozen cryovials were maintained in liquid N2 or dry ice during transport 
for thawing and re-engraftment. The thawing is rapid and accomplished with a water bath 
(25–37°C) or a running water rinse for 30–60 seconds.37 The vial is agitated until almost all

 ice has thawed inside the vial itself and is then rinsed with 70% ethanol. The contents of the 
vial are poured onto a Petri dish and the tumor samples are thoroughly rinsed (at least twice) 
with PBS solution in order to remove all cryoprotectant solvents that may potentially 
adversely affect engraftment efficacy. The thawed and rinsed cryopreserved tumor samples 
are implanted into NOD/SCID mice following the methodology described above. 
Reanimation engraftment efficiency (REE) was recorded as a percentage and defined as: 
(number of tumors successfully reanimated/number of cryopreserved tumors implanted). 
TTF and TTH were similarly recorded.
Statistical Analysis
Intergroup comparisons for continuous variables were examined with the student’s t-test 
(two-tailed) and Welch’s t-test where appropriate. Categorical variables were compared 
using the Pearson’s chi-square for uniform distribution and with Fischer’s exact test for non-
uniform distribution. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, 
Inc) Version 6.01, September 21, 2012 and JMP® 10.0.0 (2012 SAS Institute Inc.). For all 
comparisons, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Overall 57 unique PDX tumors underwent 484 reanimation engraftment attempts after 
previous cryopreservation. There were 10 unique PDX tumors cryopreserved with Standard 
(71 attempts), 40 with Specialized (272 attempts), and 7 with both (141 attempts) 
cryoprotectants. There were no differences in baseline patient tumor and original F1 PDX 
growth characteristics in regards to previous neoadjuvant therapy (35.3% vs. 51.1%, 
p=0.40), poorly differentiated tumor (35.3% vs. 42.6%, p=0.78), median TTF (36 days vs. 
25 days, p=0.70), or median TTH (88.5 days vs. 90.5 days, p=0.14) between 
cryopreservative media cohorts, respectively. (Table 1)
When comparing TTF between original (F1) tumors to reanimated tumors there was a 
significantly longer median TTF duration (53.5 days vs. 36 days, p=0.021) for tumors 
cryopreserved with Standard media. When comparing TTH between original (F1) tumors to 
reanimated tumors there was a significantly shorter median TTH duration (90.5 days vs. 64 
days, p = 0.0001) for tumors cryopreserved with Specialized media. (Table 2 and Figure 3) 
Median duration of cryopreservation was similar between Standard and Specialized media 
cohorts respectively, for overall as well as for matched cases (21 weeks vs. 29 weeks, p = 
NS; 25 weeks vs. 37 weeks, p = NS) with the longest duration of successful engraftment 
after cryopreservation of 73 weeks for Standard and 177 weeks for Specialized. The number 
of tumors implanted per unique PDX was similar between Standard and Specialized (median 
5.0 vs. 5.0, p = NS). In total, 126 (Standard) and 358 (Specialized) cryopreserved tumors 
underwent reanimation attempts. The median TTF (overall: 54 days vs. 24 days, p=0.0051; 
matched cases: 53 days vs. 18 days, p=0.0013) and TTH (overall: 89 days vs. 64 days, 
p=0.009; matched cases: 88 days vs. 47 days, p=0.0005) was significantly longer for 
Standard versus Specialized. (Table 3 and Figures 4 and 5)
The overall REE was 39% (49/126) for Standard and 82% (294/358) for Specialized and this 
significantly favored Specialized (p<0.0001). For matched cases REE was 36% (20/55) for

 Standard and 97% (83/86) for Specialized and this significantly favored Specialized 
(p<0.0001) media. For those tumors with the longest duration of cryopreservation (>52 
weeks frozen time) REE was significantly lower for Standard at 9% (5/37) versus 
Specialized 59% (45/70) (p<0.0001). A one-way ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) was 
conducted to determine statistically significant differences between REE on the duration of 
cryopreservation controlling for the cryoprotectant used. Both the type of cryoprotectant 
(Standard vs. Specialized) and the duration (weeks) of cryopreservation were significant 
predictors of REE (p<0.0001 and 0.0168, respectively) and while REE decreased for both 
cryoprotectants as a function of time and duration of cryopreservation, REE remained higher 
for Specialized media compared to Standard with non-zero engraftment at 3 years with 
utilization of Specialized media (p=0.048). (Table 2 and Figure 6). As loss of unique PDX 
models is the most potentially devastating consequence for a program, we assessed for 
failure of reanimation. Overall when comparing unique PDX lines potentially lost, there 
were 35% (6/17) Standard cryopreservation failures compared to 8.5% (4/47) Specialized 
failures (p=0.017).
Discussion
Cryopreservation refers to freezing biological tissue for long-term storage in such a way that 
cells remain viable for long durations for subsequent reanimation. Cryopreservation of PDX 
tumors is essential to maintaining early generation/passage tumors that have minimal 
biologic deviation from the tumor of origin. The success of the freezing process depends on 
three critical factors: proper and timely handling of PDX tumor tissues, use of appropriate 
cryoprotective agents, and controlled rate of freezing and storage at cryogenic temperatures. 
There are two potential mechanisms for cell injury during freezing.18,37 First, when water 
freezes in the cell suspending solution, solutes become more concentrated in the remaining 
liquid phase21,37 that leads to cellular osmotic dehydration of the biological sample and 
injury/death.38,39 Second, as cells freeze, intracellular ice crystals can form and directly 
puncture and damage the plasma membrane18,19,24,39–41, In order to prevent such freezing 
injury various cryoprotectants such as glycerol, ethanediol, propanediol and dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) are used for stable freezing and long-term preservation of established cell 
lines and tissues.18,20,25,40–42 These solutions are non-toxic and easily soluble and are 
thought to prevent such injury via several proposed mechanisms.18,20,22,25,40–44 They can 
partially solubilize the cell membrane so that it is less prone to puncture and interrupt the 
lattice of the ice, so that fewer intracellular crystals form. Cryoprotectants also increase the 
solute concentration in cells thus lowering the glass transition temperature (for water is 
−135C) of a solution below which molecular movement ceases and all biological activity is 
suspended thus preventing actual freezing and the cytosol maintains some flexibility in a 
glassy phase. Furthermore these solutions displace water molecules and form hydrogen 
bonds with biological molecules. Hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions is important for 
proper protein and DNA function. Thus, as the cryoprotectant replaces the water molecules, 
the biological material retains its native physiological structure and function, although they 
are no longer immersed in an aqueous environment. The rate at which cryopreserved tissues 
are frozen is also a critical component to this process. A freezing rate falling within −0.3 to 
−1.8C/min is optimal.45 A variety of methods to obtain this rate have been utilized including 
Ivanics et al.

 specifically designed controlled rate freezers, portable freezing containers with or without 
low-freezing point insulator solutions, and even simple polystyrene boxes found in most 
labs. Regardless of method, maintaining a rate of cooling very close to −1°C/minute, the 
optimal rate for cell preservation, is necessary for best long-term reanimation outcomes.
Successful cryopreservation and subsequent reanimation is critically necessary in any high 
volume PDX program. We have demonstrated that long-term (>3 years) cryopreservation of 
PDX tumors is feasible and reproducible and that subsequent reanimation can be reliably 
performed with high efficiency. A specialized and commercially available cryoprotectant 
specifically formulated for vulnerable cell populations, demonstrated superior performance 
over standard traditional lab-based DMSO media solution as a cryoprotectant with markedly 
improved reanimation engraftment efficiency (REE), shorter TTF and TTH, successful 
reanimation even with extended cryostorage (>52wks), and less risk of potential unique 
PDX models lost to cellular injury due to the cryopreservation process. The implications of 
these results are substantial for high volume programs involved in PDX studies or other 
highly precious and vulnerable cellular and tissue biobanks that require long-term 
cryopreservation for future reanimation.
Although previous data has demonstrated that derived PDX tumors are remarkably well 
maintained as they move through subsequent later generations of mice, the potential for new 
mutations and molecular evolution of these derived tumors does exist.46,47 For this reason, 
studies involving PDX should optimally be conducted in early generation PDX tumors as 
these have been demonstrated to have minimal deviation from the original patient tumor.1 
Logistically, this poses a problem because maintenance of large numbers of tumor-bearing 
mice is not practically feasible and continued passage into next generations may alter the 
biological phenotype which may then further complicate studies as these tumors may deviate 
from the original patient tumor. Optimal methods of cryopreservation can remedy such 
issues by allowing safe, replicable, and high efficiency reanimation rates so future studies 
can be performed on an as needed basis with early generation PDX. Additionally, we have 
found nearly identical genetic signatures in early generation PDX with and without the use 
of cryopreservation.48
In addition to the type of cryoprotectant used, there are a number of aspects that may affect 
the engraftment efficacy after cryopreservation and may have introduced sources of bias to 
this study. First, tissues may be damaged by ischemia from the time the tumor is removed 
from its blood supply until they have been cryopreserved. There may have been differences 
in the ischemic time from harvest until cryopreservation between the two groups. This 
specific information was not captured during our data collection process and is therefore a 
potential confounder. If the tumor samples are not thoroughly washed after thawing to 
ensure removal of the cryoprotectant, this may have affected engraftment rate during 
reanimation. Tumors that have undergone neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery and PDX 
creation may have lower engraftment rates compared to non-treated tumors, however we 
found no difference in neoadjuvant therapy receipt between the groups. Similarly, high-
grade tumors may have higher engraftment rates and shorter TTF and TTH than low-grade 
tumors, but again there was no difference in the degree of tumor differentiation between 
groups in this study. When tumors are large, the central portion may outgrow its blood

 supply and become necrotic. It is therefore critical that viable tissue for cryopreservation is 
taken from the periphery of the tumor. Another aspect that may introduce bias is differences 
between the sizes of tumor samples placed in the cryoprotectant-containing vials as this may 
prevent uniform penetration of the cryoprotectant and may result in inadequate 
cryopreservation and tissue damage, thus maintaining specific protocols for the 
cryopreservation process is critical.
Cryopreservation with subsequent reanimation is not only feasible but is also an efficient 
method to overcome economic and logistic aspects that are otherwise unavoidable in large 
volume programs. Creation and maintenance of a PDX program is labor intensive and very 
resource costly. Requisites of a program include high clinical patient volumes of the specific 
malignant histologic subtype that PDXs are to be created from (in order to better represent 
patient tumor heterogeneity) as well as active involvement of variety of disciplines including 
surgical oncologists, pathology staff, veterinary facilities, etc. In addition appropriate CORE 
facilities including animal veterinary facilities, histologic processing, and downstream 
molecular analysis of derived PDX tumors are needed. Finally, optimal methods of 
cryopreservation and reanimation are necessary to continue such programs over the long-
term to allow for the creation of a large repertoire and registry of cryopreserved tumors that 
can be reanimated at a later date for any specific study or experiment. Given these requisites, 
continued developments in tissue preservation may allow regionalization of PDX programs, 
facilitating transfer of viable tumors from smaller centers without access to a PDX program 
but perhaps with different patient characteristics and demographics. This development 
would allow the PDX model to reach a larger scale and ultimately benefit a greater number 
of patients.
As our data have demonstrated, PDX tumors can be successfully reanimated after over 3 
years in cryopreservation and it appears the use of a specialized commercially available 
cryoprotectant is superior to standard lab-based cryoprotectant media solutions and our 
respective laboratories currently utilize such specialized solutions exclusively based on the 
results of this work. Future studies in this field should aim to determine the upper limit of 
duration for safe and reliable cryopreservation.
