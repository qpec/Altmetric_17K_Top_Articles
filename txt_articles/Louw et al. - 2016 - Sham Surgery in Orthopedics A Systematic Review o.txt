Abstract
Objective. To evaluate the evidence for the effective-
ness of sham surgery in orthopedics by conducting
a systematic review of literature.
Methods. Systematic searches were conducted on
Biomed Central, BMJ.com, CINAHL, the Cochrane
Library, NLM Central Gateway, OVID, ProQuest
(Digital Dissertations), PsycInfo, PubMed/Medline,
ScienceDirect and Web of Science.
Secondary
searching (PEARLing) was undertaken, whereby
reference lists of the selected articles were re-
viewed for additional references not identified in the
primary search. All randomized controlled trials
comparing surgery versus sham surgery in ortho-
pedics were included. Data were extracted and
methodological
quality
was
assessed
by
two
reviewers
using
the
Critical
Review
Form—
Quantitative Studies. Levels of scientific evidence,
based on the direction of outcomes of the trials,
were established following the Australian National
Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
Hierarchy of Evidence (Australian National Health
and Medical Research Council, 1999).
Results. This review includes six randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) involving 277 subjects. All six
studies were rated as very good on methodological
quality. Heterogeneity across the studies, with re-
spect to participants, interventions evaluated, and
outcome measures used, prevented meta-analyses.
Narrative synthesis of results, based on effect size,
demonstrated that sham surgery in orthopedics
was as effective as actual surgery in reducing pain
and improving disability.
Conclusions. This review suggests that sham sur-
gery has shown to be just as effective as actual sur-
gery in reducing pain and disability; however, care
should be taken to generalize findings because of
the limited number of studies.

Introduction
Orthopedic rehabilitation is deeply rooted in a biomed-
ical health model focusing on tissues and tissue injury
[1–3]. This biomedical model emphasizes the search for

 anatomical or biomechanical faults, which, when cor-
rected, would lead to an expected improvement in pain
and disability [1–3]. Unfortunately, strict adherence to
the biomedical model has shown limited scientific effi-
cacy in decreasing pain and disability [4,5]. Further,
anatomical and biomechanical pathology is poorly corre-
lated to pain. For example, approximately 40% of
asymptomatic people have a bulging disc on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) [6,7], 25–50% of the general
population exhibit disc and zygapophyseal degeneration
on MRI [8], 40% of asymptomatic people have rotator
cuff tears on MRI [9], and there is just a 50% correlation
between the presence of knee arthritis and pain [10].
This disparity between tissue health and perception of
pain has led to the search for a better paradigm for
understanding
pain
in
physical
rehabilitation
and
a
greater interest in the neuroscience of pain [11]. The
paradigm shift from a tissue-based model of pain has
led to the inclusion of the brain and the current neuro-
matrix model of pain [12–14]. Central to the neuromatrix
model is the importance of consciousness and the brain,
and how pain is better defined as a measure of potential
threat, rather than true tissue health [12,15–17]. The big-
ger the perceived threat, the greater the experienced
pain [15]. The neuromatrix model suggests that various
beliefs and cognitions will determine if pain is to be
experienced or not [18,19]. Subsequently, altering a pa-
tient’s beliefs regarding the health of their tissues may
powerfully influence their experience of pain [17,20–22].
Orthopedic surgery also usually follows a stringent bio-
medical model correlating the correction of faulty anat-
omy or biomechanics with pain relief [23]. At its simplest
level, a patient with a bony fracture is thought to experi-
ence pain because of the fracture (tissue damage), and
surgical repair of the fracture will, logically, lead to even-
tual elimination of the pain. If the surgical repair of the
damaged tissue is required for eventual pain relief then
how can the potential result of sham surgery be ex-
plained? Sham surgery refers to a faked surgical inter-
vention that omits the step thought to be therapeutically
necessary. The earliest report of a sham surgical pro-
cedure in 1959 reported that patients undergoing liga-
tion of the internal mammary artery did no better than
patients in the sham surgery group receiving only a skin
incision under local anesthesia without the ligation pro-
cedure [24]. Since then, only a few sham surgical inter-
ventions have been published, for Parkinson’s disease
[25,26], Meniere’s disease [27–29] and orthopedic con-
ditions [30–32]. The proposed mechanism behind sham
surgery and its efficacy is the expectation of benefit or
placebo effect [26,33]. When patients believe they are
receiving an invasive surgical procedure with the ex-
pectation that their underlying pathology or disease
state is being properly corrected, they will report im-
provement in symptoms and dysfunction. Another ex-
planation for the observed benefits of sham surgery
could be that there is a change in the brain’s perception
of the underlying pathology or disease state, despite the
fact that the procedure could not directly affect these
[30,31]. Understandably, sham surgery is very contro-
versial in the community. Opponents of sham surgery
raise the ethical issues of withholding surgery from pa-
tients, as well as noting the many variables requiring
control before it may be demonstrated that the sham
procedure truly resulted in a placebo effect [34–37].
Clinical and life experiences suggest that a direct rela-
tionship between pathoanatomy and pain does not exist.
To further explore this, we decided to conduct a system-
atic review to evaluate the efficacy of sham surgery in
orthopedic medicine. Specific questions asked included:
1) Were there any differences in outcome measures
(pain and disability) observed following sham surgery
when compared to actual surgical procedures?; and 2) if
none were observed, what might account for observed
benefits following a sham procedure? The purpose of
this review was not to undervalue orthopedic surgery,
but rather shed further light on the correlation between
pathoanatomy, the brain, and pain experiences.
Methods
Literature Database Search
This report closely adheres to the PRISMA method for
reporting on systematic reviews. Computerized literature
searches between May 2015 and July 2015 were per-
formed on the following databases with no limitations
on
time
frame:
PubMed/Medline,
Biomed
Central,
BMJ.com, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, NLM Central
Gateway, EMBASE, OVID, AMED, ProQuest (Digital
Dissertations), PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, and Web of
Science. Each database has its own indexing terms and
functions, and therefore different search strategies were
developed for each database by the authors. The main
search
items
included
“joint,”
“orthopedic,”
“ortho-
paedic,” “placebo,” “procedure,” “sham” and “surgery.”
In PubMed, medical subject headings (MeSH) terms
were used where possible, with Boolean operators. The
search strategies for the remaining databases included
synonyms of the main search items. When database
facilities allowed search limits, searches were restricted
to
randomized
clinical
trials.
Secondary
searching
(Pearling) was undertaken, whereby reference lists of
the selected articles were reviewed for additional refer-
ences not identified in the primary search.
Inclusion Criteria for Article Selection
Articles chosen to go through the selection process
were reviewed by two authors. All titles and abstracts
were read to identify potentially relevant articles. Articles
were included if they met the inclusion criteria listed in
Table 1. When there was uncertainty regarding the eligi-
bility of the article from the abstract, the full text version
of the article was retrieved and evaluated for the inclu-
sion criteria. The full text version of all articles that met
the inclusion criteria were retrieved for quality assess-
ment and data extraction.

 Assessment of Methodological Quality
Critical appraisal of each included study was con-
ducted by determining: 1) the level of evidence on
the
Australian
National
Health
and
Medical
Research
Council
(NHMRC)
Hierarchy
of
Evidence
(Australian
National
Health
and
Medical
Research
Council, 1999); and 2) the methodological quality of
each
study,
using
the
Critical
Review
Form—
Quantitative Studies [38].
All authors independently scored the studies and where
disagreement occurred, consensus was achieved by
discussion. Quality scores were divided into five catego-
ries: poor (score � 8), fair (score: 9–10), good (score:
11–12), very good (score: 13–14) and excellent (score:
15–16) [39]. The Critical Review Form—Quantitative
Studies [38] includes 17 of the 22 items that are con-
tained in the CONSORT statement [40,41]. It does not
include item 1 (study design stated in title or abstract),
items 8 to 10 (randomization: sequence generation, allo-
cation concealment and implementation respectively) or
item 19 (adverse events). Although the CONSORT state-
ment was not designed to evaluate methodological
quality [40], it was documented whether these five
CONSORT criteria were fulfilled by the included RCTs,
providing further methodological quality information.
Data Extraction
Data were initially extracted by the authors using the
PICO approach [42]. A study was considered “relevant”
when at least one of the outcome measures concerned
pain or disability. For being “generally consistent,” at
least 75% of the trials that analyzed the same sham sur-
gery had to exhibit the same results (positive, neutral, or
negative). The results (to determine the efficacy of sham
surgery in orthopedic medicine) were posted in narrative
form, and the outcomes were defined as positive
(experimental group obtained a significantly greater im-
provement compared to the control group); neutral
(there were no statistically significant differences be-
tween groups); or negative (the control group obtained
a significant greater improvement compared to the ex-
perimental group). An alpha of P < 0.05 was used to
define a significant outcome measure. This method is
based on four levels of scientific evidence on the quality
and the outcome of the trials [43,44].
Analysis of the Data
Data on the effectiveness of the sham surgery for ortho-
pedics were also extracted for each study. To determine
the effect of the sham surgery on each outcome meas-
ure, the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the
between-group differences was calculated for RCTs,
based on the results provided in each article [45].
Moreover, the mean change between pre- and post-
treatment (and 95% CI) was calculated for the RCTs.
Pain reduction of more than 20%, irrespective of the
measurement tool, was considered clinically worthwhile
[46,47]. It was expected that there would be heterogen-
eity in participants, interventions, comparisons and out-
comes.
Therefore
the
results
of
the
studies
were
synthesized in a narrative format.
Results
Search Strategy Yield
Initially 12,673 hits were gained from databases and
secondary searches. After review of the titles and ab-
stracts, those articles that did not meet the inclusion cri-
teria were removed. After reviewing 471 abstracts, the
full text of 46 articles were retrieved. Upon further review
of the 46 articles, duplicates were removed, non-
orthopedic and non-RCT studies excluded, leaving six
studies for the systematic review. This systematic review
is based on six published studies (Figure 1). All six stud-
ies included in this review were RCTs [30–32,48–50].
Methodological Quality
There was 100% agreement in scoring between the au-
thors conducting the systematic review. Scoring in meth-
odological quality was noted, with scores rated as 14 in

Justification
English language
Major journals in this area are pub-
lished in this language.
No time limit
Given the limited number of sham
surgeries it was decided to set no
time limit.
Humans
Since the objective of the study was
to determine true placebo effect
and change in perception and to
make findings clinically meaningful,
animal studies were excluded.
No age limit
Given the limited number of sham
surgeries it was decided to set no
age limit.
Randomized
controlled trials
(RCTs)
Randomized controlled trials were
chosen because of their high levels
of evidence and to pool results.
Sham surgery
This review focused on surgical inter-
ventions where one group in the
RCT did not receive the actual sur-
gical intervention but a procedure
mimicking the actual surgical
interventions.
Outcomes
No limitations were set on the out-
comes measures used in the RCTs
mainly due to the limited studies in
the area.

 four studies (very good) and 15 in two studies (excellent).
Table 2 provides details regarding the criteria that were
fulfilled
on
the
Critical
Appraisal
Form—Quantitative
Studies. Four of six studies failed to provide adequate
description of sample size calculation (criterion 6) and all
six studies failed to mention the validity of the outcomes
measures chosen to report results (criterion 8).
Table 2 also provides details regarding the fulfilment of
the CONSORT criteria. All but two studies reported all
the criteria of the CONSORT criteria 1, 8, 9, 10 and 19,
with the studies by Moseley [30] and Kroslak [48] failing
to report on the adverse events (criteria 19).
Clinical Data of Included Trials
Six randomized clinical trials are included in this review,
with two on vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression
fractures [31,32]; two on intradiscal electrothermal ther-
apy (IDET) [49,50]; one on arthroscopic debridement for
osteoarthritis of the knee joint [30]; and one on open
debridement of common extensor tendons for lateral
epicondilitis [48]. The average duration of symptoms for
the osteoporotic compression fractures ranged from 9.5
[31] to 20 weeks [32]; and for the IDET it was greater
than 24 months [49,50]. The study by Kroslak [48] re-
ported an average duration of symptoms of 59 months.
Finally, the study by Moseley [30] did not report the
average duration of knee symptoms due to knee osteo-
arthritis but exclusion criteria indicated symptoms to be
present > 6
months.
In
total,
sham
surgery
was
performed on 277 orthopedic patients of whom 52.7%
were female. The average age of the patients ranged
from 40.8 6 7.5 years [50] to 78.9 6 9.5 years [31] with
a mean age (calculated as the mean of the mean re-
ported ages) of 56.1 years of age.
Sham Surgery Procedure
Details of the specific content of the sham surgery pro-
cedures used in the studies are found in Table 3. All tri-
als used similar procedures for sham surgery including:
mimicking the actual surgical procedure, skin incisions,
use of the same surgical equipment; sounds to mimic
the real surgical procedure, smells to mimic the real sur-
gical procedure, similar postoperative instructions and
management as the real surgical procedure, and similar
time in the operating room as real surgical procedure
[30–32,48–50]. Only two studies used no penetration of
the joint structure containing the presumed patho-
anatomical cause of pain [30–32].
Professionals Performing Sham Surgery
Sham surgery was performed by a radiologist (vertebro-
plasty) [31], a single orthopedic surgeon (knee arthros-
copy)
[30]
and
single
unspecified
surgeon
(lateral
epicondylitis) [48]. Three studies failed to identify the
professionals who performed the surgery [32,49,50].
Use of Sham Procedure
All six RCTs provided detailed descriptions of the surgi-
cal procedures which were compared to the sham sur-
gery. The orthopedic surgeries can be summarized as
skin incision, penetration of the anatomical structure
containing the proposed patho-anatomical structures
causing pain and dysfunction, use of surgical instru-
ments, and correction of pathoanatomical cause of the
structured involved in the patient’s pain and disability
[30–32,48–50].
Outcome Measures
There was great variability in outcome measurements
across the studies in terms of the number, type used
and the number of occasions they were used (Table 3).
Researchers and clinicians utilizing sham surgery were
mainly interested in determining if sham surgery affected
issues
related
to
pain
[30–32,48–50],
function
[30,32,48–50], quality of life [31,32,49, 50], disability
[31,32,49,50], adverse events [31], self-perceived recov-
ery [31,48,49], and general health [32].
Although similar outcome measures were sometimes
used for pain, disability and quality of life in the six stud-
ies, the measurement of pain with the numerical pain
rate scale and visual analog scale varied in their report
of the pain rating period, over the course of a previous
week [31,49] to average back-pain intensity during the
preceding 24 hours [32], thus nullifying the ability to
compare the outcomes of the studies. Further, the

 initiation, frequency, and duration of the outcomes var-
ied considerably between the studies. Outcomes meas-
ures were initiated as soon as 3 days after surgery [32]
and as late as 6 months after surgery [50]. The duration
of outcome measure reporting ranged from 3 months
[32] to 2 years [30].
Treatment Effectiveness
Data gained from the RCTs could not be pooled into a
meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the out-
comes and comparison groups. Results are reported in
narrative form and summarized in Table 4.
Pain
All six studies in this review examined sham surgery’s
effect on pain [30–32,48–50]. A sham knee arthroscopy
was just as effective as lavage and debridement in
reducing knee pain at 1 and 2 years after the surgery
[30].
Percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagula-
tion (90 seconds, 70� C) was no more effective in reduc-
ing chronic discogenic low back pain than the sham
procedure [49]; however, percutaneous intradiscal elec-
trothermal therapy (4 minutes, 90� C) did reduce pain
more than the sham procedure [50]. Sham vertebro-
plasty surgery was as effective as the actual vertebro-
plasty in reducing overall pain rating 3 months following
the surgery [31,32].
In
patients
with
osteoporotic
fractures,
undergoing
sham vertebroplasty or actual vertebroplasty, there was
a decrease use of opioid medication with no significant
between-group differences at any follow-up period [31].
Finally, sham surgery was just as effective in reducing
pain as a common surgical technique for lateral epicon-
dylitis (surgical excision of the macroscopically degener-
ated portion of extensor carpi radialis brevis) [48,51].
Function
Five of the six studies examined sham surgery’s effect
on function [30, 32, 48–50]. Sham knee arthroscopy

a 23-gauge needle was
used to infiltrate the peri-

lamina. An incision was
made in the skin, and a
13-gauge needle was
placed posterolaterally
relative to the eye of the
pedicle. Gentle tapping
guided the needle through
the pedicle into the anter-
ior two thirds of the frac-
turedvertebral body.
Anterior–posterior and lat-
eral images were re-
corded with the needle in
the correct position.
Prepared polymethylme-
thacrylate (PMMA) (ap-
proximately 3 ml) was
slowly injected into the
vertebral body, and satis-
factory infiltration of the
vertebral body was con-
firmed radiographically. A
bipedicular approach was
used only if there was in-
adequate instillation of ce-
ment with the unipedicular
approach. Injection was
stopped when substantial
resistance was met or
when the cement reached
the posterior quarter of
insertion of the 13-gauge
needle to rest on the
lamina.
The central sharp stylet was
then replaced with a blunt
stylet. To simulate verte-
broplasty, the vertebral
body was gently tapped,
and PMMA was prepared
so that its smell perme-
ated the room.
After the intervention, all
participants received usual

 was just as effective as lavage or debridement in im-
proving function in individuals undergoing arthroscopy at
2-year follow-up [30]. There was no statistical difference
between the sham and intradiscal radiofrequency ther-
mocoagulation in either disability scales at 8 weeks [49].
Oswestry Disability Index scores were significantly better
at 6 months post IDET compared to sham [50]. Finally,
there were no significant differences in functional meas-
ures 26 weeks after lateral epicondylitis excision surgery
compared to sham surgery [48].
Quality of Life and General Health
Five of the six studies examined sham surgery’s effect
on quality of life [31,32,48–50]. Although quality of life
outcomes between sham vertebroplasty and actual ver-
tebroplasty fail to reach clinically difference, one week
after sham vertebroplasty, patients in the sham surgery
group rate their quality of life (QUALEFFO) better than
patients having undergone the actual vertebroplasty
procedure [31]. There was no significant difference in
change of COOP/WONCA scores between the sham
and radiofrequency lesion group for discogenic low
back pain at 8 weeks [49]. Overall, patient ratings of
stiffness and elbow condition were not significantly dif-
ferent between sham and true lateral epicondylitis sur-
gery at 26 weeks [48].
In the only study examining general health following
sham surgery, no difference was found in general health
between sham vertebroplasty and actual vertebroplasty
[32].
Disability
Four studies examined the effect of sham surgery on
disability [31,32,49,50]. Sham vertebroplasty was as ef-
fective as actual vertebroplasty in decreasing disability
(P ¼ 0.49) [32]. Furthermore, the two groups did not dif-
fer in the post-specified proportion of patients who had
clinically meaningful improvement in physical disability
related to back pain at 1 month [32]. Sham intradiscal
thermal surgery may be just as effective as actual intra-
discal thermal surgery in decreasing disability [49,50].
Perceived Recovery
Three studies reported on perceived recovery following
sham surgery [31,48,49]. No difference was found in
perceived recovery between the sham vertebroplasty
procedure and vertebroplasty procedure [31], between
sham intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation and
the actual procedure [49], and between sham lateral
epicondylitis debridement surgery and the actual pro-
cedure [48].
Adverse Events
Only one study examined the adverse events following
sham surgery [31], although all others reported no ad-
verse events. Patients receiving sham vertebroplasty for
osteoporotic fractures compared to actual vertebro-
plasty had no meaningfully different rates in adverse
events. Seven participants (three in the vertebroplasty
group and four in the sham group) reported an incident
of clinical vertebral fracture within 6 months after the
study intervention. Three participants (one in the verte-
broplasty group and two in the sham group) reported
new rib fractures at 1 week [31].
Discussion
Sham surgery is quite rare and marred with ethical con-
siderations [36,52–54]. To the authors’ knowledge, this
is the first systematic review investigating the efficacy of
sham surgery in orthopedic medicine [52]. Although
care should be taken to extrapolate findings from six
RCTs consisting of only four types of orthopedic sur-
geries, the results from the current review indicate that
in comparison to real surgery, sham surgery provides
similar results in pain and disability. The results indicate
that sham surgery in orthopedic medicine led to real
changes in patients, similar to the real surgical interven-
tion. For the 277 patients involved in these six studies,
those who underwent a sham orthopedic procedure re-
ported outcomes similar to those who had the real sur-
gical intervention. These findings concur with findings in
sham surgery for ligation of the internal mammary artery
[24], Parkinson’s disease [25,26], and Meniere’s disease
[27–29].
Orthopedic surgery is based on a biomedical health
model focusing on tissues and tissue injury [1–3]. This
biomedical model seeks to find the anatomy or bio-
mechanics at fault and once surgically corrected, it is
expected that the pain and resulting disability will be
resolved [1–3]. In all six studies included in the current
review, the authors described detailed procedures to
maintain blinding and ensure patients would not be-
come aware they were in the sham surgery group,
including pre-operative and post-operative education,
sounds, duration of procedures, smells and rehabilita-
tion. Pain is complex and recent research highlights the
finding that pain is more likely be a measure of potential
threat, than of true tissue health [12,15–17]. The greater
the perceived threat, the higher the pain experienced
[15]. Most patients view pain as an indicator of tissue
health and if they believe that activity may further dam-
age their tissue and thus increase pain, they may de-
crease physical movements as a logical protective
mechanism [17]. The surgical experience may likely be
interpreted by the patient’s brain as the process of cor-
recting faulty tissue. Once completed, the perception of
a painful, movement limiting degenerative disc, vertebral
fracture, arthritic knee or chronically inflamed elbow is
re-evaluated by the brain, resulting in decreased pain
and increased function.

 We can hypothesize that the sham surgery likely altered
the patient’s perception of the health of their tissues.
This hypothesis is supported by the results of a study
where patients undergoing lumbar discectomy who
were shown and given their disc fragment had superior
postoperative results compared to traditional discec-
tomy [21]. The authors reasoned that patients who saw
their disc fragment received “visual confirmation” that
the corrective surgery was successful, much like the vis-
ual, auditory and sensory and physical stimuli produced
during the sham procedures, thus providing perception
of a technically successful surgery. Additionally, the find-
ing of this review is underpinned by recent research
evaluating the effect of a cognitive educational approach
of explaining pain and pain processing to patients utiliz-
ing neurobiology and neurophysiology, with the aim of
altering a patient’s view of his or her tissues and the
reasons for pain perception [12,55,56]. This reconceptu-
alization of pain and the health of their tissues allow pa-
tients to report less pain, improve movement, decrease
fear and decrease brain activity [12,55,56]. This finding
is strengthened by the fact that patients report change
in pain and move better after education only, with no
physical interventions [17].
The current systematic review is limited by the number
of studies as well as the heterogeneous nature of stud-
ies which precluded true meta-analyses, which would
have been helpful to determine the real effectiveness of
sham surgery in orthopedics. Furthermore, the carry-over
of results of intradiscal thermal therapy, knee arthroscopy,
vertebroplasty surgical procedures, and lateral epicondylar
soft tissue debridement, to other more comprehensive
and common orthopedic surgeries such as knee and hip
replacement or rotator cuff repairs, is limited.
Conclusion
The results of the systematic review provide preliminary
evidence that sham surgery in orthopedics may provide
results similar to the actual surgical interventions. Even
though sham surgery remains controversial, the fact
that sham surgery yields results similar to real surgery
highlights the powerful contributions of the brain to pain
modulation. The premise in the biomedical health model
that correcting altered anatomy or biomechanics will
alter pain and resulting disability is challenged by these
sham surgery results. Patients who believed that faulty
tissues had been surgically corrected experienced the
same relief as patients who had undergone real surgical
correction of purportedly damaged tissues. Health prac-
titioners making decisions regarding surgical versus
conservative management in orthopedic medicine would
do well to consider these results.
