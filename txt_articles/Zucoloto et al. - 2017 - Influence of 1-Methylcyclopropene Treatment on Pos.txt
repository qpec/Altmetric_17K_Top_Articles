Scab (Venturia inaequalis) is a very serious disease for apples causing up to 80% of loss in yield but there are only a few studies on
postharvest quality of scab-resistant cultivars. In this study we evaluated the effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on fruit quality,
total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity after storage of four scab-resistant cultivars and compared to a standard cultivar,
“Golden Delicious.” In general, ethylene production and respiration rates significantly differed among cultivars, between control
and 1-MCP-treated fruits, and between storage duration regimes. 1-MCP treatment retarded fruit softening and lowered juice pH
but storage effect on soluble solids and acidity depended on cultivar and 1-MCP treatment. Total phenolic content was significantly
affected by storage duration and 1-MCP treatment. Antioxidant capacity of the four scab-resistant cultivars was either similar to or
significantly higher than that of “Golden Delicious” with the 1-MCP-treated fruits having significantly higher antioxidant capacity
than the nontreated fruits after storage. Our results clearly show that the quality of four scab-resistant cultivars was comparable
to that of “Golden Delicious” and 1-MCP effect differed among cultivars. These differences need to be considered in developing
storage regime to minimize quality deterioration during long-term storage.
1. Introduction
The hazardous effects of pesticides on human health and the
environment have contributed to the introduction of cultivars
with effective resistance genes to major plant diseases. Yield
losses from fungal diseases are significant in most apple pro-
ducing countries worldwide. Apple scab, caused by the fungus
Venturia inaequalis, is one of the most destructive diseases
of apples throughout the world, causing up to 80% loss in
yield without chemical intervention, which could include
multiple classes of fungicides applied up to 22 times during
the growing season [1]. In 1944 Hough, from University of
Illinois, was the first to identify the scab-resistant gene 𝑉
𝑓
in Malus floribunda [2]. Since 1944, additional scab-resistant
genes have been identified in other apple species [3]. In 1948,
three US universities (Purdue, Rutgers, and Illinois, PRI)
formed a research team to develop apple cultivars resistant
to scab, utilizing the 𝑉
𝑓 gene [3]. In recent years, several
apple cultivars containing 𝑉
𝑓 have been introduced into
commercial production from the PRI program, including
“Dayton,” “Prima,” “Priscilla,” and “Jonafree” [4]. Among
the most promising introductions are “WineCrisp” [5],
“CrimsonCrisp” [6], “Pixie Crunch” [7], and “GoldRush”
[8]. In addition to the scab-resistant apple cultivars released
by the PRI breeding program, several cultivars have also
been released by breeding programs at Cornell University
in NY, by Agriculture Canada, and by the National Institute
of Agronomic Research in Angers, France, and Consorzio
Italiano Vivaisti in Italy, and Breeding Initiative Niederelbe
in Germany [9].
Despite the introduction of several apple scab-resistant
cultivars, most have gained very little popularity, especially in

North America, because of lack of recognition by consumers
[4, 10]. The overwhelming acceptance of “Honeycrisp” (a scab
susceptible) cultivar by consumers in a relatively short-period
of time has made it possible for newer cultivars to also be
successful. “GoldRush,” “WineCrisp,” and “CrimsonCrisp”
are becoming commercially popular in the USA, especially
among organic and small acreage producers. However, there
is very little scientific information published on the posthar-
vest quality or storage potential of these cultivars. Abbott
et al. [11] reported that the eating quality of “GoldRush”
fruit slices was higher than “Granny Smith” and “Golden
Delicious” and comparable to “Fuji” while there are two other
studies that had ranked the sensory quality of scab-resistant
cultivars from different sources [12, 13]. However, most other
available information relies on nonscientific data to describe
the quality of these cultivars.
The objectives of this research were to determine fruit
quality after two periods of storage of four scab-resistant
cultivars, “CrimsonCrisp,” “GoldRush,” “Pixie Crunch,” and
“WineCrisp,” and compare the results to a standard cultivar,
“Golden Delicious.” In addition, we examined the effect of
the ethylene inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), on the
quality of the four cultivars following storage. 1-MCP has
been shown to maintain fruit storage quality of several apple
cultivars [14].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Plant Material. Fruits were harvested from six-year-old
“CrimsonCrisp,” “GoldRush,” “Pixie Crunch,” “WineCrisp,”
and “Golden Delicious” trees grafted on “Budagovsky 9” root-
stock and trained to the tall spindle system. Trees were
grown at the Fruit Research Farm at University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA. Cultural management
of the trees was according to the 2013 Midwest Tree Fruit
Pest Management Guide (https://ag.purdue.edu/hla/Hort/Pages/
sfg sprayguide.aspx).
Full bloom date for “Pixie Crunch” and “CrimsonCrisp”
was 29 April, and that for “WineCrisp” and “Golden Deli-
cious” was 2 May. The full bloom date for “GoldRush” was 6
May 2013. Fruits of “Pixie Crunch” and “CrimsonCrisp” were
harvested on 2 September and “WineCrisp” and “Golden
Delicious” on 10 September, and “GoldRush” was harvested
on 2 October 2013. Harvest dates were determined by mea-
suring flesh firmness, soluble solids, and starch levels, as
described by Witney et al. [15], from 10 fruits of each cultivar
from the middle of the canopy (3 trees per cultivar).
2.2. 1-MCP Treatment and Storage. A total of 240 uniform
size fruits from each cultivar were randomly divided into
two lots of 120 fruits, with each lot further divided into three
replicates of 40 fruits each. One of the two lots of each cultivar
was placed in a 117 L plastic container, tightly sealed; then
500 ppb of 1-MCP (SmartFresh�, AgroFresh, Collegeville, PA,
USA) was injected with a hypodermic needle through a
rubber septum installed in the wall of the container. Fruits
were exposed to the 1-MCP for 24 hours at 0 ± 1∘C, following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten fruits per replicate were
labeled and stored at 0 ± 1∘C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity
for up to 140 days. Treated fruits were sampled after 70 and
140 days of storage, placed at room temperature (20 ± 1∘C)
for seven days to simulate commercial handling practices,
and then evaluated for their quality characteristics. Ten
fruits from each replicate and treatment were analyzed for
respiration, ethylene, firmness, skin color, soluble solids,
and acidity as described next. Representative tissue samples
(about 10 g) were collected from the sun- and shade-exposed
sides of each fruit and freeze-dried in a Virtis freeze dryer
(VirTis Comp. Inc., Gardiner, NY, USA) to analyze chemical
composition and measure antioxidant capacity.
2.3. Fruit Firmness and Skin Color. Flesh firmness was
measured in two perpendicular peeled sides from each
fruit using a penetrometer (FT327, McCormick Fruit Tech,
Yakima, Washington, USA) equipped with an 11 mm tip. Fruit
firmness was presented in newton (N).
Skin color was measured at two different locations of
equatorial regions of the fruit using a digital colorimeter
(CR-200, Konica Minolta, Osaka, Japan) and expressed as
averaged values. The hue angle values were calculated from
the equation arctan(𝑏∗/𝑎∗).
2.4. Soluble Solids and Titratable Acidity. Juice extract from
each replicate was used to measure soluble solids, titratable
acidity, and pH. Soluble solids were measured using a tem-
perature compensated refractometer (Leica 10430, Buffalo,
NY, USA), while titratable acidity was determined by titrating
juice samples from each replicate with a standardized 0.1 M
NaOH and expressed as milligrams of malic acid per 100 mL
juice using a pH meter (Fisher Science Education, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA).
2.5. Organic Acids. A 1.0 g freeze-dried sample from each
replicate was extracted with 5 mL of 0.004 N H2SO4 using
a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematics, Switzerland) set at a
speed of 4 for 1.0 min in the dark. The homogenate was
centrifuged at a 27,000𝑔 at 5∘C for 30 min. A 1.0 mL fraction
of the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 𝜇m nylon filter
and a 5 𝜇L fraction was injected into an HPLC (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a photodiode array detector and
a REZEX 10 𝜇 8% H organic acid column (300 × 7.8 mm)
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Sulfuric acid (0.0004 N)
was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min.
Organic acids were detected at 210 nm and quantified based
on an external organic acids standard curve (malic, oxalic,
and tartaric acids) as mg/100 g dry weight.
2.6. Ethylene and Respiration Measurement. Ethylene pro-
duction and respiration rates were measured using a sub-
sample of five fruits from each replicate. Fruits were weighed
and placed in a 3.8 L glass jar and sealed for 1 h at 27∘C.
A 1.0 mL gas sample was withdrawn from each jar with
a hypodermic syringe and injected into an AutoSystem
gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal
conductivity detector (TDC). Ethylene was measured using
FID, activated alumina column, and helium as carrier. The

oven, injector, and detector temperatures were 80, 100,
and 200∘C, respectively. Ethylene measurement data were
expressed as 𝜇L/g/h. Respiration rate was measured as the
amount of CO2 generated. The amount of CO2 was measured
using TDC, Porapak R column (Agilent Technologies Santa
Clara, CA, USA), and helium as carrier gas. One-milliliter air
samples were collected from the same jars, as described above
for ethylene, evaluated for CO2 production, and expressed as
mL/kg/h.
2.7. Total Phenolics and Antioxidant Capacity. For extraction
of polyphenols, approximately 0.5 g of freeze-dried tissue
samples was homogenized in 20 mL of 70% methanol using a
Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica Ag, Luzern, Switzerland)
set at a speed of 4 for 1 min. The homogenate was centrifuged
twice for 10 min at 4,000𝑔. The supernatant was collected and
used to determine total phenolic content using a colorimetric
Folin-Ciocalteu method as previously described by Ku et al.
[16]. Briefly, 10 𝜇L of sample extracts was mixed with 0.2 N
Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (100 𝜇L) in a 96-well plate.
After 3 min, 90 𝜇L of a saturated sodium carbonate solution
was added to the mixture, followed by incubation at room
temperature for 1 h. The resulting absorbance of the mixture
was measured at 630 nm using a BioTek EL 808 microplate
reader (Biotek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The
total phenolic content was calculated on the basis of a
standard curve using gallic acid (concentration range from
31.25 to 500 𝜇g/mL). Results were expressed in milligrams of
gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of dried apples.
Antioxidant capacity was evaluated using 2,2󸀠-azino-
bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and ferric
reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods according to
Ku et al. [16]. Briefly, the ABTS method involved dissolving
7 mM ABTS (ammonium salt) in potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) and combining with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate.
The mixture was stored in the dark for 10 min. The dark blue
solution was diluted with potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) until the absorbance reached 1.0±0.02 at 734 nm (BioTek
EL 808 microplate reader, Biotek Instruments, Winooski,
VT, USA). A 200 𝜇L fraction of the resulting solution was
mixed with 10 𝜇L of the sample, and after 6 min of incubation
under dark condition at room temperature, the absorbance
was recorded. The results were expressed as Trolox equiva-
lent (mM TE/g dry weight). All samples were analyzed in
triplicate. For FRAP assay, 10 𝜇L of the sample was mixed
with 200 𝜇L of freshly prepared FRAP reagent, consisting of
2.5 mL of a 10 mM TPTZ solution in 40 mM HCl in distilled
water, 2.5 mL of 20 mM FeCl3⋅6H2O in distilled water, and
25 mL of 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6). The absorbance was
measured at 593 nm after 6 min of incubation on a microplate
reader (BioTek EL 808 microplate reader, Biotek Instruments,
Winooski, VT, USA). The results were expressed as Trolox
equivalents (mM TE/g of dry weight). All samples were
analyzed in triplicate.
2.8. Statistical Analysis. The experiment was set up as a
randomized complete plot design with four replications.
Analysis of variance and post hoc tests were performed using
JMP Pro 12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
3. Results and Discussion
Results of this study show that the four scab-resistant culti-
vars have comparable fruit quality to the standard cultivar
“Golden Delicious” after 70 and 140 days of storage. Fruit
firmness differed significantly among the five cultivars. At
harvest, “WineCrisp” was the firmest (102.5 N) compared to
the other cultivars. Storage and 1-MCP treatment significantly
affected the fruit firmness (Figure 1). Fruit firmness decreased
over storage duration, in particular after 140 days at 0∘C
followed by 7 days at 20∘C, in all cultivars except for 1-MCP-
treated “WineCrisp.” Generally, fruits treated with 1-MCP
were firmer than nontreated fruits, except “GoldRush,” where
there was no difference between treated and nontreated fruits
even after 140 days of refrigerated storage and then 7 days at
room temperature. Several studies have shown that fruit firm-
ness decreased during storage, but 1-MCP treatment retarded
fruit softening [17, 18]. Watkins et al. [19] also showed
differences among cultivars in response to 1-MCP, with 1-
MCP-treated “Empire” and “Red Delicious” being about 20
and 10 N firmer than the control, respectively, while no signif-
icant differences in firmness were observed in 1-MCP-treated
“La Rome” and “McIntosh” fruits. Firmness of most fruits
is associated mainly with changes in pectin composition,
especially galacturonic acid. Activities of enzymes involved in
pectin degradation and fruit softening are generally ethylene-
dependent [20, 21]. There is an agreement that 1-MCP treat-
ment maintains fruit firmness through inhibition of ethylene
action and reducing activities of cell wall hydrolases [22]. The
variability in fruit softening in response to 1-MCP, among
the five cultivars, may have been due to differences in the
degree of ethylene inhibition. Several studies have reported
different responses to 1-MCP among different apple cultivars
[19, 23, 24]. For example, DeLong et al. [23] found that
1-MCP-treated fruits of “Redmax” and “Redcort Cortland”
apples had significantly higher firmness than the control,
while there was no difference in firmness between 1-MCP-
treated and control fruits of “Summerland McIntosh” apples
after nine months of storage. In the present study, we found a
significant interaction between cultivar and 1-MCP treatment
(𝑝 < 0.0001) and between cultivar and storage duration (𝑝 <
0.0001). These results suggest that textural change in response
to 1-MCP treatment and storage is cultivar-dependent.
Similar to firmness, soluble solids content differed among
the cultivars (Table 1). At harvests, soluble solids content
was similar in four cultivars but lower in “GoldRush.” After
storage, “Golden Delicious” fruits have the highest soluble
solids, except for 1-MCP-treated fruit stored for 140 days at
0∘C followed by 7 days at 20∘C. Soluble solids content in
“Golden Delicious,” “GoldRush,” and “WineCrisp” increased
with storage but that in “Pixie Crunch” did not change with
storage in both control and 1-MCP treatment. Soluble solid
content in “CrimsonCrisp” decreased in control but increased
in 1-MCP-treated fruits after 140 days at 0∘C followed by
7 days at 20∘C. These results indicate differential sugar
metabolism during storage and response to 1-MCP among
cultivars. Similarly, Watkins [25] found significant difference
in soluble solids in response to 1-MCP treatment among
cultivars, while DeLong et al. [23] reported that soluble solids

has identified a significant interaction between cultivar and
1-MCP treatment (𝑝 < 0.0001, Table 1) indicating that change
in soluble solids content is cultivar-dependent.
Titratable acidity and pH also differed among cultivars.
“GoldRush” was consistently highest in titratable acidity
but lowest in pH while their change over storage differed
between control and 1-MCP treatment (Table 1). Fruit acidity
generally decreased with storage in the control group but

remained unchanged in the 1-MCP-treated “GoldRush” and
“WineCrisp” in both storage durations (Table 1). In both
storage durations, 1-MCP-treated fruits had higher titratable
acidity, except for “Golden Delicious” stored for 140 days. Our
results also show significant interaction between cultivar and
1-MCP treatment and between cultivar and storage duration
for titratable acidity (𝑝 < 0.0001 for both interactions),
indicating that treatments effects were cultivar-dependent.
Similarly, Bai et al. [24] reported differential effect of 1-
MCP on titratable acidity among several apple cultivars.
Bai et al. [24] reported that the influence of 1-MCP on
titratable acidity was less pronounced on 8-month stored
fruits of “Delicious,” “Fuji,” and “Granny Smith” fruits than
on “Gala.” In general, our data show a positive correlation
between total organic acids content and titratable acidity
and a negative correlation between pH and titratable acidity
(𝑝 < 0.0001, data not shown). However, changes in total
organic acid content in response to 1-MCP treatment or
storage duration were different from changes in titratable
acidity or pH (Table 1). Previously, we reported different
organic content among these five apple cultivars [26]. At
harvest, we found that the total organic acid content was the
lowest in “Pixie Crunch” [26]. After storage, total organic
acid content was highest in “GoldRush” and lowest in “Pixie
Crunch” (Figure 2). However, there was no difference in total
organic acids between the two storage durations or between
the control and 1-MCP treatment, except in “Pixie Crunch”
where 1-MCP treated fruits had higher total organic acids
compared to the control (Figure 2). The increase in total
organic acids in “Pixie Crunch” treated with 1-MCP was not
paralleled to changes in pH or titratable acidity (Table 1),
which could be attributed to the fact that titratable acidity
and pH are measured anion rather than direct analyses of acid
molecules.
The SSC/TA has been suggested as an important indicator
of fruit flavor and consumer acceptance [27]. The ratio of
soluble solids to titratable acidity (SSC/TA) was highest
in “Pixie Crunch” and lowest in in “GoldRush” (Table 1).
“Pixie Crunch” is gaining considerable popularity among
organic growers for its balanced sugar to acid ratio. This ratio
generally increased in fruits stored at 140 days in storage but
was lower in fruits treated with 1-MCP. Jan and Rab [28]
reported differences in SSC/TA among different cultivars and
storage durations.
As expected, hue angle varied among cultivars depending
on their color (Figure 3). At harvest, “Golden Delicious” and
“GoldRush” apples, yellow-colored cultivars, had >110∘ of hue
angle while red cultivars, “WineCrisp,” “Pixie Crunch,” and
“CrimsonCrisp,” had the hue angle of 23.6, 19.7, and 19.4∘,
respectively. Hue angle values changed differentially between
control and 1-MCP treatment and between storage duration
(Figure 3). Hue angle of “Golden Delicious” and “GoldRush”
decreased during storage, while the other cultivars had
similar hue angle values except for a significant decrease
in 1-MCP-treated “CrimsonCrisp.” The 1-MCP treatment
affected hue angle of “GoldRush,” “WineCrisp,” and “Pixie
Crunch” fruits stored for 70 days at 0∘C, while that of
“Golden Delicious,” “GoldRush,” and “WineCrisp” apples
was affected after 140 days of storage. In general, 1-MCP
treatment increased the hue angles of yellow cultivars and
decreased them in red cultivars (Figure 3).
Hue angle is an indicator of color, which is a major
determinant of appearance and marketability of most fruits.
Skin color of apple fruits is affected mainly by three pig-
ment groups, chlorophylls (green color), carotenoids (yellow
color), and anthocyanin (red color) [29, 30]. Change in skin
color of control “WineCrisp” fruits during storage indicates a
degradation of chlorophyll and accumulation of anthocyanin.
Similarly, a higher hue angle in the yellow cultivars after
140 days of refrigerated storage followed by 7 days at 20∘C
with 1-MCP treatment suggests an inhibition of chlorophyll
degradation, while increased hue angle in “WineCrisp” with

storage may indicate anthocyanin degradation during stor-
age. Except for “CrimsonCrisp,” 1-MCP treatment resulted
in significantly different hue angle at either storage duration,
indicating that 1-MCP treatment may play a role in accu-
mulation and degradation of pigments of apple skin during
storage. However, the mechanism of how 1-MCP influences
pigments in apple skin is not yet fully understood. Our study
has identified significant interactions for hue angle between

storage duration (𝑝 < 0.0001) and among all three factors
(𝑝 < 0.0001), indicating that these factors were dependent on
each other and treatment effects differed among cultivars. In
agreement with our results, Vidrih et al. [31] reported that 1-
MCP treatment affected skin color of “Jonagold” and “Golden
Delicious” but has no effect on “Idared” skin color, indicating
cultivar differences in response to 1-MCP.
Ethylene production was highest in “Golden Delicious,”
followed by “GoldRush,” and lowest in “CrimsonCrisp,”
while “WineCrisp” and “Pixie Crunch” produced interme-
diate levels in both storage treatments (Table 2). However,
there was no difference in ethylene production between the
two storage durations, except in “GoldRush” where it was
higher in fruits stored for 140 days at 0∘C followed by 7 days
at 20∘C than for 70-day treatment, indicating that fruits of
this cultivar require longer time to reach their climacteric
peak than the other cultivars. Ethylene synthesis in the 1-
MCP treatments was between 5.3- and 15-fold lower than
the untreated fruits after 70 days of storage and between 2.1-
and 66-fold lower than the untreated fruits after 140 days of
storage at 0∘C followed by 7 days at 20∘C (Table 2).
Studies have shown that ethylene synthesis changes dur-
ing long-term storage of apples [23, 32, 33]. However, results
differed, depending on cultivar and storage conditions. Tsan-
tili et al. [34] reported different levels of ethylene synthesis
between “Cortland,” “Law Rome,” and “Idared” apples dur-
ing 25 weeks of storage at 0.5∘C. The 1-MCP effect on ethylene
production also slightly differed among cultivars. Although 1-
MCP reduced ethylene production in many apple cultivars,
the rate of synthesis started to increase after 5 weeks of
storage in “Cortland” and “Law Rome” apples, while it stayed
relatively constant in “Idared” fruits after 25 weeks of storage
[34]. In the present study, 1-MCP treatment reduced ethy-
lene production in all five cultivars. However, we observed
significant differences in ethylene production among the five
cultivars as well as differential response of these cultivars to
the 1-MCP treatment in the two storage durations. Our results
are in agreement with earlier observations made by Tsantili
et al. [34]. Additionally, Watkins et al. [19] showed different
sensitivity to 1-MCP among four apple cultivars, resulting in
different degree of inhibition of ethylene production. They
reported that fruits of “McIntosh” apples were less sensitive
to 1-MCP, at three concentrations, compared to “Empire,”
“Delicious,” and “Law Rome.” These results are in agreement
with the observed interactions in our data between cultivar
and storage duration and among cultivar, 1-MCP treatment,
and storage duration (Table 2), which indicate that these
factors were dependent on each other and, therefore, 1-MCP
treatment effect differed depending on cultivar and storage
duration. Tatsuki et al. [35] reported that the expression levels

of the ethylene receptor genes, MdERS2 and MdERS2, and
the ACC-synthase gene, MdACS1, were inhibited in 1-MCP-
treated “Fuji” apples even when the treatment was delayed for
a week after storage. However, Tatsuki et al. [35] reported that
in, “Orin,” a high ethylene-producing cultivar, a delay in 1-
MCP application after harvest resulted in less suppression of
ethylene production and the level of gene expressions. These
data also suggest cultivar difference in response to 1-MCP,
similar to our result.
Unlike ethylene, respiration rates were not significantly
different between the four disease resistant cultivars (Table 2).
However, “Golden Delicious” treated with 1-MCP and stored
for 140 days had higher respiration than similarly treated and
stored disease resistant cultivars. Respiration rate of apple
fruit has been reported to change during long-term storage,
especially during first 1–3 months [36–38]. Although signif-
icant reduction of respiration rate by 1-MCP was reported
for “Gala” and “Golden Delicious” apples during 5 months
of storage at 0 or 1∘C [37, 38], respiration rate of 1-MCP
treated “Delicious” apples was not different from that of
control after 50 days of storage at 0∘C [36]. We found
that the respiration rate slightly differed among cultivars,
especially in the fruit treated with 1-MCP and stored for
140 days at 0∘C and then 7 days at 7∘C. The 1-MCP effect
also differed depending on cultivar and storage duration.
There was a significant interaction between cultivar and 1-
MCP treatment and between 1-MCP treatment and storage
duration. But there was no significant interaction between
cultivar and storage duration, indicating that 1-MCP effect
differed among cultivars and storage duration but the effect
of storage duration was relatively consistent for cultivars used
in this study.
We previously reported total phenolic content of theses
apple cultivars at harvest [26]. In general, total phenolic
content decreased with storage, except for 1-MCP-treated
“Pixie Crunch.” Total phenolic content in control fruits
was not different among cultivars, except for lower content
in “Pixie Crunch” after 140 days of storage (Figure 4).
When treated with 1-MCP, “GoldRush” was the highest in
total phenolic for 70 days storage treatment but “Golden
Delicious,” “GoldRush,” and “CrimsonCrisp” were higher
than the other cultivars after 140 days of refrigerated storage
followed by 7 days at 20∘C. 1-MCP-treated fruit of “Gol-
dRush,” “WineCrisp,” and “Pixie Crunch” had higher total
phenolic content compared to control after 70 days of storage
whereas only “Golden Delicious” had higher total phenolic
content with 1-MCP treatment after 140 days of storage.
Studies have shown that change in phenolic content dur-
ing storage was cultivar-dependent [39, 40]. Our results also
show that change in total phenolic content during storage was
different among cultivars. However, total phenolic content
after storage was generally lower in all cultivars [26]. Increase
in total phenolic content in response to 1-MCP treatment was
reported in “Red Delicious” [41], while, in “Cripps Pink,”
Hoang et al. [42] reported a twofold increase in the flesh and
about 10% decrease in the peel after 160 days of storage. Dif-
ferent results among studies including the present study could
partially be due to different cultivar used and inconsistent 1-
MCP treatment and storage conditions. Ethylene is known to
increase activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a
key enzyme involved in earlier step of phenolic biosynthesis
[43], which has been shown to increase flavonoid content
in apples [44]. Our results of decreased total phenolic after
storage indicate that the phenolic synthesis and degradation
during storage might involve multiple factors, in addition to
ethylene. Moreover, the total phenolic content analyzed by
Folin-Ciocalteu reflects another compound having reducing
capacity [45] and, therefore, different chemical composition
among cultivars and their change during storage can affect
the total phenolic content. Additionally, our results showed
significant interaction between cultivar and storage duration
(𝑝 = 0.0028) but not between cultivar and 1-MCP treatment,

suggesting that 1-MCP effect was relatively consistent for
all cultivars but storage duration effect differed among
cultivars.
“GoldRush” and “CrimsonCrisp” exhibited the highest
total antioxidant capacity, as measured by ABTS and FRAP,
in response to 1-MCP treatment (Table 3). These cultivars
were also found to be the highest in antioxidant capacity
at harvest [26]. However, antioxidant capacity measured by
ABTS generally decreased while that analyzed by FRAP assay
increased after storage. These differences may partially be
related to the difference between assays [45]. Additionally, not
only phenolic compounds but also some other compounds
having reducing capacity can affect the result of these assays
[45], indicating potential interference of those compounds
and their change during storage on antioxidant capacity. The
1-MCP effect on antioxidant capacity was also dependent on
cultivar and storage duration, similar to total phenolic con-
tent (Table 3). Hoang et al. [42] reported that total antioxidant
activity increased by 40 and 70% in the peel and flesh of
“Cripps Pink” apple, respectively, during storage with most
of total antioxidants concentrating in the flesh. However, they
found that 1-MCP significantly reduced the total antioxidant
activity in peel after 160 days of storage at 0∘C.
4. Conclusions
Data from this study have demonstrated that the four
scab-resistant apple cultivars, “GoldRush,” “Pixie Crunch,”
“WineCrisp,” and “CrimsonCrisp,” have excellent eating
quality, compared to the most widely grown scab susceptible
cultivar, “Golden Delicious,” as judged by their flesh skin
color, firmness, soluble solids, juice pH, and titratable acidity.
Fruit quality, chemical composition, and antioxidant capacity
of these apples were significantly affected by storage duration
and 1-MCP treatment but these effects depended on cultivar.
The favorable qualities of these four scab-resistant apple
cultivars make them highly desirable for organic production
and for production by small farmers and consumers who
are conscious of the health risk of chemicals, their high
cost, and their effect on the environment. Moreover, our
results provide valuable information of these scab-resistant
cultivars in developing storage regimes to minimize quality
deterioration during long-term storage.
