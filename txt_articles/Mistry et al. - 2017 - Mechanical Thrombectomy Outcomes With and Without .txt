S
everal randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a 
clear benefit of mechanical thrombectomy with standard 
medical management including intravenous thrombolysis 
over standard medical therapy alone for the treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion of the ante-
rior cerebral circulation.1–5 The 2015 update to the American 
Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines 
recommends treating eligible acute ischemic stroke patients 
with intravenous thrombolysis even if they are being consid-
ered for mechanical thrombectomy.6
However, whether pre-treatment with intravenous throm-
bolysis provides any additional benefits to the patients under-
going mechanical thrombectomy remains unclear. Early and 
successful recanalization of the occluded vessel, commonly 
defined as thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia score of 2b/3, 
is critical to achieve best possible functional outcomes.6 Pre-
treatment with intravenous thrombolysis may prolong the time 
to mechanical thrombectomy—which offers a greater chance of 
successful recanalization—especially in drip and ship models 
of care7,8 and increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications. 
Conversely, intravenous thrombolysis may be beneficial in 
patients with multifocal ischemia or harder-to-reach clots and 
be an important adjunct to achieving successful recanalization. 
It may even lyse the clot mitigating the need for mechanical 
thrombectomy. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis 
of published studies to determine whether pre-treatment with 
Background and Purpose—Whether prior intravenous thrombolysis provides any additional benefits to the patients 
undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel, acute ischemic stroke remains unclear.
Methods—We conducted a meta-analysis of 13 studies obtained through PubMed and EMBASE database searches to 
determine whether functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days, successful recanalization rate, and symptomatic 
intracerebral hemorrhage rate differed between patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with (MT+IVT) and 
without (MT−IVT) pre-treatment with intravenous thrombolysis.
Results—MT+IVT patients compared with MT−IVT patients had better functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 
0–2; summary odds ratio [OR], 1.27 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05–1.55]; P=0.02; n=1769/1174), lower mortality 
(OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55–0.91]; P=0.006; n=1774/1202), and higher rate of successful recanalization (OR, 1.46 [95% 
CI, 1.09–1.96]; P=0.01; n=1652/1216) without having increased odds of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 
1.11 [95% CI, 0.69–1.77]; P=0.67; n=1471/1143). A greater number of MT+IVT patients required ≤2 passes with a 
neurothrombectomy device to achieve successful recanalization (OR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.37–3.10]; P=0.0005; n=316/231).
Conclusions—Our results demonstrated that MT+IVT patients had better functional outcomes, lower mortality, higher 
rate of successful recanalization, requiring lower number of device passes, and equal odds of symptomatic intracerebral 
hemorrhage compared with MT−IVT patients. The results support the current guidelines of offering intravenous 
thrombolysis to eligible patients even if they are being considered for mechanical thrombectomy. Because the data are 
compiled from studies where the 2 groups differed based on eligibility for intravenous thrombolysis, randomized trials 
are necessary to accurately evaluate the added value of intravenous thrombolysis in patients treated with mechanical 
thrombectomy.

 Mistry et al  Thrombectomy Outcomes With or Without Thrombolysis   2451
intravenous thrombolysis was beneficial in patients treated with 
mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.
Methods
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
The common evidence medicine framework PICO (Patient Population, 
Intervention, Control, Outcome) was used to specify our research ques-
tion: Did adult patients with acute ischemic stroke from a large ves-
sel occlusion of the anterior cerebral circulation (patient population) 
who underwent mechanical thrombectomy preceded by intravenous 
thrombolysis (MT+IVT; intervention) have better functional outcomes, 
higher rate of successful recanalization, and lower rates of mortality 
and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH; outcomes) com-
pared with patients who only received mechanical thrombectomy 
(MT−IVT; control)? This meta-analysis was guided by the PRISMA 
guideline (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis).9 Because no prior review protocol specifically exists to 
address this question, a search of titles and abstracts of published jour-
nal articles in the NCBI/NLM PubMed (from 1966 to March 21, 2017) 
and OVID EMBASE (from 1980 to March 21,  2017) databases was 
conducted (by E.A.M. and A.M.M.) without language restriction using 
the following string of terms (thrombectomy OR endovascular) AND 
(thrombolysis OR tPA OR plasminogen OR intravenous) AND (stroke). 
References generated from these searches were imported into the ref-
erence manager EndNote X7 (Thompson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA), 
and duplicate references were removed. Titles and abstracts of journal 
articles were then systematically screened (by E.A.M and A.M.M.) 
for studies comparing outcomes of interest between MT+IVT and 
MT−IVT patients. Unpublished studies and conference abstracts were 
excluded. Studies were excluded if they included posterior circulation 
stroke patients; pediatric patients; primarily used Merci device or intra-
arterial pharmacotherapy; contained duplicate data on patients reported 
in other studies; had missing data on our outcomes of interest; did not 
report data on both MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups of patients; or, were 
case series with <15 patients. A total of 13 studies7,10–21 were included 
after a full text review of studies identified through the screening process 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). A bibliography search of 
these studies did not reveal any additional relevant studies.
Data Extraction
A review of all 13 studies was performed by 3 authors (E.A.M., 
A.M.M., and M.R.F.). From each final study, the number of patients 
with the following outcomes in the MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups 
were extracted independently by 2 reviewers (E.A.M and A.M.M.): 
90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 2 and 6, success-
ful recanalization, number of device passes to achieve a successful 
recanalization, and sICH. These outcomes were collected as defined 
by the study criteria. Whether age, National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time from symptom onset to groin puncture, or 
Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score differed statistically between 
the MT+IVT and MT−IVT patients in each study was noted as well.
Meta-Analyses
Using Review Manager (RevMan) software for Macintosh ver-
sion 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane 
Collaboration, 2014), dichotomous data from published studies were used 
to generate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and 
a meta-analysis was performed with a Mantel–Haenszel random effects 
model to calculate a summary OR with 95% CIs. Statistical significance 
was identified with a P≤0.05. For each of our outcomes of interest, a meta-
analysis was conducted. Heterogeneity among the studies included in the 
meta-analyses was assessed and noted with I2>75% and Tau2>1 statistics.22 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted by sequential exclusion of 1 study at 
a time to assess for a significant change in the summary OR. Additional 
sensitivity analyses included subgrouping randomized trials (for mRS 
0–2 and mortality meta-analyses) and studies that had nonsignificant dif-
ferences in the distributions of age, baseline NIHSS, symptom onset to 
groin puncture time, and successful recanalization—the widely accepted 
predictors of functional outcome—between the MT+IVT and MT−IVT 
groups (for mRS 0–2 meta-analysis). To explore potential heterogene-
ity in the good functional outcomes meta-analysis, a meta-regression 
model was generated using differences in the median symptom onset to 
groin puncture times between the MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups in the 
studies. Risk of selection, performance, detection, and attrition bias 
in each study was assessed by referring to the Cochrane risk of bias 
assessment tool.22 Publication bias was assessed with (1) a funnel plot 
plotting ORs against error/variance and (2) with Begg and Mazumdar’s 
and Egger’s tests using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software ver-
sion 2.2 for Windows (Biostat Inc, Englewood, NJ). An asymmetrical 
funnel plot or a 2-tailed P<0.05 with the latter 2 tests was suggestive of 
potential publication bias. The trim and fill method was used to adjust 
the summary OR by theoretical incorporation of nonexistent studies when 
publication bias was suggestive.
Results
Study Characteristics
Of the 13 studies included, 3 studies included randomized trial 
patients.13,14,19 For each study included in the meta-analyses, the 
following variables are listed in the Table: study design, time 
period, endovascular device used, intravenous thrombolytic dose 
used, time from symptom onset to groin puncture, method for 
evaluation of recanalization, and whether age, baseline NIHSS, 
and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT scores were evaluated. 
The majority of the patients in these studies were treated with 
modern neurothrombectomy devices. Patients who were given 
intravenous thrombolysis received a treatment dose (recombi-
nant tissue-type plasminogen activator or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg 
when specified) in all studies except in Broeg-Morvay et al,12 
where either a treatment or bridging dose of 0.6 mg/kg was used. 
Moreover, this was the only study where patients in the MT−IVT 
group were eligible for treatment with intravenous thromboly-
sis. The difference in symptom onset to groin puncture times 
between the MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups varied among the 
studies (Table). Other known predictors of outcome, such as 
age, baseline NIHSS, or Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score 
(when available), did not statistically differ between the MT+IVT 
and MT−IVT groups in all the studies. All studies reported good 
functional outcome as mRS 0 to 2. sICH was defined as either a 
≥4 points increase in NIHSS or as parenchymal hematoma type 
1 or 2 per ECASS study (European Cooperative Acute Stroke 
Study)23 criteria. Measure of successful recanalization varied 
among the studies and included Thrombolysis in Myocardial 
Infarction score 2/3, thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia score 
2b/3, or modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia score 2b/3. 
Last, considerable risk of bias existed in these studies (Figure II 
in the online-only Data Supplement), including publication bias 
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement; Figure III in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Clinical Outcomes
Randomized trial patients contributed more than a quarter of 
the total weight of the good functional outcomes and mortality 
meta-analyses. Therefore, respective subgroup analyses were 
conducted for these outcomes.

Nonrandomized Studies
Subgroup analysis of patients in nonrandomized studies dem-
onstrated a strong trend with quantitatively similar summary 
OR of 1.31 (95% CI, 0.99–1.73) for good functional outcomes 
(n=1088/938, respectively; P=0.06; Figure 1A) and 0.76 (95% 
CI, 0.56–1.03) for mortality (n=1089/963, respectively; P=0.08; 
Figure 1B) in MT+IVT compared with MT−IVT patients.
Combined Clinical Outcomes Analyses
There was no significant difference in heterogeneity between ran-
domized trials and nonrandomized studies subgroups (I2<25%). 
Therefore, a combined analysis was conducted. Overall, MT+IVT 
patients demonstrated higher odds of having good functional out-
comes and lower mortality than MT−IVT patients (mRS 0–2: 
n=1769/1174, respectively; summary OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.05–
1.55]; P=0.02; mortality: n=1774/1202, respectively; summary 
OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55–0.91]; P=0.006; Figure 1). But, similar 
rates of sICH were observed in MT+IVT and MT−IVT patients 
(n=1471/1143, respectively; summary OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.69–
1.77]; P=0.67; Figure 2). I2 and Tau2 statistics did not reveal 
significant heterogeneity in these 3 meta-analyses. The number 
needed to treat for 1 additional individual to incur an mRS of 0 to 
2 was calculated to be 17 (95% CI, 10–83).22
Mulder et al19 was excluded from the good functional 
outcome and mortality meta-analyses because all of these 
MR CLEAN trial patients were also included in Goyal 
et al.14 REVASCAT trial patients (n=103) reported in Goyal 
et al14 may also be included in Abilleira et al10; if so, they

would constitute at maximum 9% of the patients reported 
in Abilleira et al.10 We addressed this minor duplication 
of patients with sensitivity analysis conducted by sequen-
tial exclusion of 1 study at a time. This did not alter the 
significance of the summary ORs in the 3 meta-analyses, 
except for exclusion of Gerschenfeld et al,7 study in the 
meta-analysis of good functional outcome which led to a 
summary OR of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.99–1.37), P=0.07. Only 
3 studies13,17,19 had nonsignificant differences in age, base-
line NIHSS, proportion of successful recanalization, and 
symptom onset to groin puncture time between MT+IVT 
and MT−IVT groups (n=383/191, respectively). Summary 
OR derived only from these 3 studies showed no significant 
difference in the odds of having good functional outcome 
(summary OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.91–2.05]; P=0.13). Last, to 
explore heterogeneity in outcomes among the studies based 
on symptom onset to groin puncture time, a meta-regres-
sion was conducted and revealed no significant correlation 
(slope=−0.5×10−4; P=0.95; Figure 3) of good outcomes 
with differences in the median symptom onset to groin 
puncture times between MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups 
in the studies. The Goyal et al14 study was excluded from 
this analysis because of unavailability of symptom onset to 
groin puncture time data.
Procedural Outcomes
MT+IVT patients (n=1652) demonstrated significantly higher 
odds of achieving a successful recanalization than MT−IVT 
patients (n=1216; summary OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.09–1.96]; 
P=0.01; Figure 4A). Six studies provided data on the number 
of passes needed to achieve successful recanalization. A meta-
analysis of 511,15–17,20 of these studies was conducted (data from 
1 study13 could not be quantitatively incorporated). MT+IVT 
patients (n=316) had significantly higher odds of achieving a 
successful recanalization within 2 passes of mechanical throm-
bectomy device (summary OR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.37–3.10]; 
P=0.0005; Figure 4B) compared with MT−IVT patients (n=231). 
In sensitivity analysis, exclusion of any 1 study did not alter the 
significance in both of these meta-analyses. I2 and Tau2 statistics 
did not reveal significant heterogeneity in these meta-analyses.
Discussion
We performed meta-analyses on outcome data reported in 
the literature of acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing 
mechanical thrombectomy with or without intravenous throm-
bolytic pre-treatment. Our aim was to understand whether 
pre-treatment with intravenous thrombolysis, which by itself 
achieves successful recanalization in 6% to 30% of patients 
with acute large vessel occlusion, provided additional benefits

to the outcomes of patients undergoing mechanical throm-
bectomy, a treatment modality that offers a 70% to 80% rate 
of successful recanalization.1–5,24 Our results demonstrated 
that MT+IVT patients had better functional outcomes (mRS 
0–2), lower mortality, and higher rate of successful recanali-
zation without having increased odds of sICH compared with 
MT−IVT patients. These results support the current guidelines 
to offer intravenous thrombolysis to eligible patients even if 
they are being considered for mechanical thrombectomy.6
Better clinical outcomes in the MT+IVT patients may be a 
result of a higher rate of successful recanalization. Systemic 
thrombolysis may facilitate thrombectomy and serve as an 
adjunct in achieving a higher rate of successful recanali-
zation. For instance, significantly lower number of passes 
were required to achieve a successful recanalization in the 
MT+IVT patients. Added systemic thrombolysis may also be 
beneficial in multifocal ischemia or harder-to-reach clots (ie, 
distal location, tortuous vessels, high grade tandem stenosis, 
and difficult arterial access). Furthermore, in a small number 
of patients, thrombolysis may occur to the point of mitigat-
ing the need for mechanical thrombectomy as was seen in 
≈4% to 7% of patients in the thrombectomy trials.1–5,13
However, these results must also be interpreted with impor-
tant limitations. Patients who underwent mechanical throm-
bectomy in these studies were not randomized to receive 
intravenous thrombolysis or controlled. Therefore, the MT+IVT 
and MT−IVT patients were inherently different in all studies 
based on eligibility for intravenous thrombolysis except one.12 
Delayed presentation and coagulopathy were the most common 
reasons for ineligibility for intravenous thrombolysis. Hence, it 
is plausible that the former would render patients in MT−IVT 
group less likely to have better functional outcomes and success-
ful recanalization because of a more organized clot, and the latter 
would increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, 
compared with the MT+IVT group, a significantly longer symp-
tom onset to groin puncture time in the MT−IVT group was seen 
in only 2 studies.10,20 Six studies11,13,15–17,19 had no difference, and 
surprisingly, 4 studies7,12,20,21 actually had a significantly shorter 
symptom onset to groin puncture time in the MT−IVT group 
compared with the MT+IVT group. We attempted to explain the 
good functional outcomes by accounting for these differences 
in symptom onset to groin puncture times between the 2 groups 
in a meta-regression. No correlation was found. However, such 
analysis is limited by lack of individual patient data. The rate 
of sICH was interestingly not different between the 2 groups. 
Although patients receiving anticoagulation have higher chances 
of sICH, intravenous thrombolytics are also known to induce a 
transient coagulopathy which may increase and equalize the 
risk of sICH between the 2 groups.25–27 Therefore, in our study, 
the heterogeneity of symptom onset to groin puncture time and 
thrombolysis-induced coagulopathy may have countered these 
well-known negative prognosticators in the MT-IVT group. 
However, 1 study specifically adjusted for thrombolysis and 
coagulopathy in individual patients and found no evidence of 
increased sICH with MT+IVT.13 Ideally, a comparative study 
in patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis is necessary to 
reveal the added value of pre-treatment with intravenous throm-
bolytics in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrated that MT+IVT patients had better 
functional outcomes, lower mortality, higher rate of successful 
recanalization, requiring lower number of device passes, and 
equal odds of sICH compared with MT-IVT patients. The results 
support the current guidelines of offering intravenous throm-
bolysis to eligible patients even if they are being considered

for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the data are compiled 
largely from studies where the MT+IVT and MT−IVT groups 
differed based on eligibility for intravenous thrombolysis. 
Comparison in studies with matched ages, baseline NIHSS, and 
symptom onset to groin puncture time between MT+IVT and 
MT−IVT groups failed to demonstrate a significant difference. 
This highlights the need for true randomized trials to accurately 
evaluate the added value of intravenous thrombolysis in patients 
treated with mechanical thrombectomy.
