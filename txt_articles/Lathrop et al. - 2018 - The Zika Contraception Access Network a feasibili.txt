Summary
Background Prevention of unintended pregnancy is a primary strategy to reduce adverse pregnancy and birth 
outcomes related to Zika virus infection. The Zika Contraception Access Network (Z-CAN) aimed to build a network 
of health-care providers offering client-centred contraceptive counselling and the full range of reversible contraception 
at no cost to women in Puerto Rico who chose to prevent pregnancy during the 2016–17 Zika virus outbreak. Here, we 
describe the Z-CAN programme design, implementation activities, and baseline characteristics of the first 
21 124 participants.
Methods Z-CAN was developed by establishing partnerships between federal agencies, territorial health agencies, 
private corporations, and domestic philanthropic and non-profit organisations in the continental USA and Puerto 
Rico. Private donations to the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCF) 
secured a supply of reversible contraceptive methods (including long-acting reversible contraception), made available 
to non-sterilised women of reproductive age at no cost through provider reimbursements and infrastructure 
supported by the CDCF. To build capacity in contraception service provision, doctors and clinic staff from all public 
health regions and nearly all municipalities in Puerto Rico were recruited into the programme. All providers 
completed 1 day of comprehensive training in contraception knowledge, counselling, and initiation and management, 
including the insertion and removal of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Z-CAN was announced through 
health-care providers, word of mouth, and a health education campaign. Descriptive characteristics of programme 
providers and participants were recorded, and we estimated the factors associated with choosing and receiving a 
LARC method. As part of a Z-CAN programme monitoring plan, participants were invited to complete a patient 
satisfaction survey about whether they had obtained free, same-day access to their chosen contraceptive method after 
receiving comprehensive counselling, their perception of the quality of care they had received, and their satisfaction 
with their chosen method and services.
Findings Between May 4, 2016, and Aug 15, 2017, 153 providers in the Z-CAN programme provided services to 
21 124 women. 20 110 (95%) women received same-day provision of a reversible contraceptive method. Whereas only 
767 (4%) women had used a LARC method before Z-CAN, 14 259 (68%) chose and received a LARC method at their 
initial visit. Of the women who received a LARC method, 10 808 (76%) women had used no method or a least effective 
method of contraception (ie, condoms or withdrawal) before their Z-CAN visit. Of the 3489 women who participated 
in a patient satisfaction survey, 3068 (93%) of 3294 women were very satisfied with the services received, and 
3216 (93%) of 3478 women reported receiving the method that they were most interested in after receiving counselling. 
2382 (78%) of 3040 women rated their care as excellent or very good.
Interpretation Z-CAN was designed as a short-term response for rapid implementation of reversible contraceptive 
services in a complex emergency setting in Puerto Rico and has served more than 21 000 women. This model could 
be replicated or adapted as part of future emergency preparedness and response efforts.

Introduction
Prevention of unintended pregnancy is a primary strategy 
to reduce adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes related 
to Zika virus infection.1,2 Puerto Rico has the highest 
number of symptomatic Zika virus infections in the USA 
and US territories, including infections in women.3 
Additionally, 65% of pregnancies in Puerto Rico are 
unintended, and about 138 000 of the 715 000 women 
aged 15–44 years in Puerto Rico are at risk for unintended 
pregnancy.4 5–10% of the pregnancies with laboratory-
confirmed Zika virus infection that were reported to the 
US Zika Pregnancy Registry resulted in a fetus or infant 
with Zika-virus-associated birth defects, and the full 
range of adverse development outcomes is not yet

known.5 The threat of severe birth defects associated with 
Zika virus infection during pregnancy underscores the 
importance of contraception to prevent unintended 
pregnancies. However, a review of existing data and 
in-depth interviews with key informants early in the Zika 
virus outbreak in March, 2016, demonstrated that 
contraceptive access in Puerto Rico was limited by 
reduced availability of the full range of reversible 
methods, high out-of-pocket costs, insufficient provider 
reimbursement, logistical barriers that limit same-day 
provision, lack of patient education, and shortage of 
providers trained in insertion, removal, and management 
of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), which 
includes intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants.4 
LARC is a highly effective, safe, cost-effective, and 
user-friendly method of contraception that reduces 
unintended pregnancy and abortion.6–9 In 2002–14, LARC 
use in the USA increased from 2·4% to 14·3% of women 
using contraception.10 However, LARC use in Puerto Rico 
was low before the Zika virus outbreak,  with estimates 
indicating that less than 1% of women using 
contraception used a LARC method.4
Recognising the importance of contraceptive access 
during the Zika virus outbreak, the National Foundation 
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDCF), with technical assistance from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in 
collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and 
private donors, established the Zika Contraception 
Access Network (Z-CAN) in Puerto Rico. Z-CAN was a 
short-term response (from May, 2016, to September, 2017) 
for rapid implementation of reversible contraceptive 
services in a complex emergency setting. Z-CAN aimed 
to build a network of health-care providers trained in 
client-centred contraceptive counselling and same-day 
provision of the full range of reversible contraceptive 
methods (including LARC) at no cost to women who 
choose to delay or avoid pregnancy, and to raise 
awareness in women and families of contraception as a 
primary prevention measure to reduce adverse pregnancy 
and birth outcomes related to Zika virus infection. In 
addition to access barriers, a history of coerced 
sterilisation and concern for unethical testing of oral 
contraceptives 
in 
Puerto 
Rico 
were 
important 
considerations in programme design.11,12
Here we describe the Z-CAN programme design and 
implementation activities and the baseline characteristics 
of the first 21 124 women served through Z-CAN.
Methods
Programme design and implementation
Z-CAN was designed to address gaps in contraceptive 
access and service provision in Puerto Rico as a preventive 
measure to reduce the effect of Zika virus on infants. The 
development of Z-CAN included several strategies to 
rapidly reduce access barriers to contraception in 
Puerto Rico’s health system, strengthen infrastructure to 
support the Z-CAN programme, and work towards the 
sustainability of reversible contraceptive services after 
the Z-CAN programme ends (figure 1).
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published on or before 
April 1, 2016, using the terms “Contraceptive Choice Project”, 
“Zika and family planning”, and “Zika and contraception”. The 
Contraceptive CHOICE Project was a prospective cohort study of 
10 000 women of reproductive age in St Louis, MO, USA, who 
wanted to prevent pregnancy and initiate a new method of 
contraception. The study was designed to introduce and 
promote the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) 
methods, and the results showed that 65% of participating 
women chose LARC methods when cost, provider, and facility 
barriers were removed. In a report from April 1, 2016, early in 
Puerto Rico’s 2016–17 Zika virus outbreak, women in the 
country were shown to have a high unmet need for 
contraception, high incidence of unintended pregnancy, poor 
access to contraception, and the highest number of Zika 
infections in the USA and US territories. We did not identify any 
studies that described a contraception-focused programme as 
part of the response to the Zika virus outbreak.
Added value of this study
The Zika Contraception Access Network (Z-CAN) is the first to 
describe the large-scale implementation of a comprehensive 
programme to rapidly expand access to contraceptives during a 
major public health emergency response. The programme was 
implemented quickly and was able to serve more women than 
previous projects based on expansion of contraceptive access. 
Z-CAN included introduction to and education about LARC 
methods for both providers and patients with no previous 
exposure to or experience with these newer contraceptive 
methods.
Implications of all the available evidence
This large and rapidly established contraception programme 
could be replicated in other areas with serious and complex 
public health emergencies to ensure that unintended births are 
averted. Although this programme was developed to prevent 
unintended pregnancies and birth defects associated with Zika 
virus infection, avoiding unintended pregnancy is an important 
strategy for a wide variety of public health responses, 
particularly in view of frequent disruptions in care and services 
in emergency settings.

The development of strong partnerships was crucial 
in the design and implementation of Z-CAN. The 
programme was built with a network of partners 
including federal agencies, territorial health agencies, 
private corporations, and domestic philanthropic and 
non-profit organisations in the continental USA and 
Puerto 
Rico. 
Private 
donors 
provided 
product 
commitments to CDCF for the full range of reversible 
contraceptive methods (including LARC methods). 
CDCF established a plan for contraception procurement 
and distribution adherent to US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and territorial guidelines and for 
private donations through CDCF-supported provider 
reimbursement and infrastructure costs to ensure 
contraception was available to women at no cost.
The gaps in contraceptive access and service provision4 
meant that it was necessary to build provider and staff
 
capacity in contraception knowledge, counselling, and 
initiation and management, including the insertion and 
removal of LARC. Z-CAN recruited doctors and clinic 
staff (nurses and clinic administrators) from all public 
health regions and nearly all municipalities on the island 
who practised in private and publicly funded clinics and 
who were interested in  receiving training in the provision 
of contraception.13 Doctors and clinic staff were not 
recruited from municipalities with no community health 
centres, government facilities, or private practices 
providing women’s health care. Doctors and staff were 
recruited through the Puerto Rico section of the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Puerto Rico 
Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Puerto Rico Department 
of Health, the Puerto Rico Primary Care Association, the 
Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, and 
Medicaid-managed care organisations. Before Z-CAN, 
none of the participating clinics routinely provided 
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices or contra-
ceptive implants, and access to copper intrauterine 
devices was very limited. A 1-day comprehensive training 
course offered participants an overview of Zika virus 
(including the risk of sexual transmission and the 
importance of condom use for disease prevention), a 
tested 
curriculum 
on 
client-centred 
contraceptive 
counselling, didactic information about the full range of 
reversible contraceptives, a review of evidence-based 
contraceptive guidelines,14,15 practical training in insertion 
and removal of intrauterine devices (providers were

observed on three to five simulations),13 an FDA-approved 
etonogestrel implant training, and a overview of Z-CAN 
policies and procedures.
Provider reimbursement for these services was 
previously identified as barriers to contraception access.4 
Through Z-CAN, private donations were used to provide a 
level of provider reimbursement that was commensurate 
with Medicaid reimbursement rates in the continental 
USA. 
This 
reimbursement 
covered 
client-centred 
contraceptive counselling for women and their partners, 
if desired, and method provision. If a LARC was provided, 
the reimbursement fee was bundled to include both 
insertion and removal at the time of the insertion visit to 
ensure that women could have their LARC devices 
removed when desired at no cost.
After initial training, a Z-CAN staff member and a 
family planning specialist proctored providers and clinic 
staff to ensure delivery of high-quality care. Proctoring 
visits consisted of: direct observation of contraceptive 
counselling, at least one insertion of an intrauterine 
device, and staff interaction with patients; review of data 
collection, inventory tracking, and billing procedures; and 
a clinic audit to ensure that supplies, space, equipment, 
and security were sufficient to participate in Z-CAN. If 
provider, staff, and clinic met all readiness criteria, they 
were authorised to receive contraceptive products and to 
begin offering Z-CAN services.
Data collection and analysis
Women learned of Z-CAN through providers, word of 
mouth, and a health education campaign involving 
community engagement activities, Z-CAN materials, 
posters in health centres, a campaign website, and a 
Facebook page. Non-sterilised women of reproductive age 
were eligible to receive Z-CAN services, irrespective of age 
or insurance status. All Z-CAN services were provided 
free of charge.
At the initial Z-CAN visit, women were assigned a 
unique identification number. Providers and clinic staff
 
recorded women’s demographic information, reproductive 
and contraception histories, and their chosen contraceptive 
method. Data were submitted without personal identifying 
information to the Z-CAN programme and entered into a 
REDCap database hosted on a secure server.16
The data presented here are descriptive characteristics 
of programme providers and women receiving Z-CAN 
services. To examine factors associated with choosing and 
receiving a LARC method, we estimated unadjusted and 
adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% CI. Data were 
analysed using SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11.0.0 to 
account for clustering of patients within clinic-provider 
dyads.
The CDC’s Public Health Ethics Committee (PHEC) 
provided internal consultation during the programme 
and project design to ensure no conflicts of interest 
existed and to address any ethical concerns.17 The 
Public Health Ethics Conflict of Interest Work Group, 
part of the CDC Zika Response Emergency Operations 
Center and comprised of individuals from the PHEC, 
reviewed the Z-CAN programme proposal during its 
design phase and recommended that the programme 
offer the full range of reversible contraceptive methods 
and have measures in place to prevent coercion of 
women.
As part of the Z-CAN programme monitoring plan, 
women were invited to participate in a 10 min 
self-administered online survey within 2 weeks of their 
initial visit. Z-CAN-trained clinic staff collected contact 
information from women who did not opt out of being 
contacted for future surveys. Women were invited to 
participate in the survey via email or text message; those 
without online access could complete the survey on the 
telephone with programme staff. The survey measured 
whether participants received free same-day access to the 
contraceptive method of their choice after receiving 
comprehensive counselling, patient perception of the 
received quality of care, and satisfaction with their chosen 
method and services. Perception of quality of care was 
measured using the validated interpersonal quality of 
family planning care scale,18 comprised of 11 items 
measured using a five-point Likert scale (a score of 1 means 
poor; a score of 5 means excellent; appendix). No personal 
identifiers were collected, and unique identification 
numbers were used to merge survey responses with initial 
visit data. Women were considered non-respondents if 
they did not complete the survey within 3 weeks after 
confirmed receipt of email or text message invitation and 
after up to three outreach attempts. Responses were 
collected through Survey Monkey online software, and 
respondents received a US$10 electronic gift card. We used 
SAS version 9.3 to compare baseline characteristics of 
survey respondents and non-respondents.
The Z-CAN programme and patient satisfaction 
survey were determined by CDC to be non-research 
public health practice activities and thus exempt from 
Institutional Review Board review. The programme did 
not obtain consent from women served by Z-CAN 
providers. The women received a letter at their initial 
visit that described the follow-up contact planned for 
programme monitoring purposes and were given the 
opportunity to opt out. Women who did not opt out 
were invited to participate in the patient satisfaction 
survey. If a woman chose to participate in the survey, 
she did so by consenting to the survey within the online 
environment.
Role of the funding source
The philanthropic donors to CDCF had no role in 
programme design, data collection, data analysis, data 
interpretation, or writing of the report. CDC provided 
technical assistance in collaboration with CDCF for 
programme design and implementation. The cor-
responding author had full access to all of the data and 
the final responsibility to submit for publication.

Results
Training for providers took place between April 30, 2016, 
and Dec 6, 2016. 177 doctors, including nine resident 
doctors training in obstetrics and gynaecology, each 
participated in one of the eight Z-CAN training sessions. 
Of those who completed training, 153 practising doctors 
(141 obstetrician gynaecologists and 12 family doctors or 
paediatricians) agreed to participate in Z-CAN, completed 
proctoring visits, and received contraceptive supplies to 
provide Z-CAN services. The characteristics of providers 
are listed in table 1. 139 clinics across the island 
participated in the Z-CAN project (figure 2). The Z-CAN 
programme design, scale-up, and implementation 
occurred rapidly across the island, and the first Z-CAN 
contraception services were offered on May 4, 2016.
As of Aug 15, 2017, data were available for 21 124 women 
who had attended an initial visit in the Z-CAN programme 
(table 1). The mean age of participants was 26 years 
(SD 6·66).
The distribution of contraception methods used by 
women before and after joining the Z-CAN programme 
is shown in figure 3. Before their initial Z-CAN visit, 
most women used either no method or one of the least 
effective contraceptive methods (condoms, sponge, 
withdrawal, spermicide, or fertility awareness methods), 
and only a small proportion of women used one of the 
most effective methods (male sterilisation, intrauterine 
device, or implant; figure 3). At their visit, more than 
14 259 (68%) women chose and received a LARC method 
and 5250 (25%) women chose oral contraceptive pills or 
other moderately effective hormonal contraception (eg, 
depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection). Of the 
959 (5%) women who did not receive a contraceptive 
method, the most common reasons were being undecided 
on method preference or not ready to receive the method 
that day, pregnancy could not be ruled out, or the desired 
method was not in stock (table 1). Of the 14 259 women 
who chose and received a LARC method, 7167 (50%) 
women received a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine 
device, 5031 (35%) women received an etonogestrel 
implant, and 2061 (14%) women received a copper 
intrauterine device. Women were more likely to choose 
and receive a LARC method if they had a college degree, 
had no insurance, had at least one livebirth, used a most 
effective contraceptive method before Z-CAN, and saw a 
Z-CAN provider in private practice or a public health or 
academic 
clinic, 
after 
adjustment 
for 
all 
other 
characteristics (table 2). Women aged 25 years or more 
and women using a moderately effective contraceptive 
method before Z-CAN were less likely to choose and 
receive a LARC method. Results were similar when the 
analysis was restricted to women who received a 
contraceptive method at their initial visit.
The satisfaction survey began on Oct 28, 2016. 
By July 21, 2017, 9829 women had received invitations 
to complete the patient satisfaction survey, and

Respondents differed from non-respondents with respect 
to age, insurance status, and type of method received; 
compared with non-respondents, respondents overall 
were slightly older, had private insurance, and chose a 
more effective method during their visit. 3489 women 
participated in the patient satisfaction survey, but not all 
women completed every question of the survey. 
3068 (93%) of the 3294 women who answered the 
question about their satisfaction with services were very 
satisfied, 203 (6%) women were somewhat satisfied, and 
23 (1%) women were not satisfied. 3216 (93%) of the 3478 
women who answered the question about receiving the 
method they were most interested in after receiving 
counselling did receive the method they were most 
interested in. Of the 3040 women who completed every 
item on the 11-item interpersonal quality of family 
planning care scale, 2382 (78%) respondents rated their 
care as excellent or very good on all 11 items. Results 
from individual items measuring quality of care are 
summarised in the appendix.
Discussion
In Puerto Rico, the combination of a high incidence of 
Zika virus infection, a high incidence of unintended 
pregnancy, and low use of highly effective contraception 
necessitated programmatic efforts to improve con-
traceptive access as a primary prevention strategy to 
reduce adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes related to 
Zika virus infection. The Z-CAN programme shows the 
feasibility of implementing a programme to increase

Access Network (Z-CAN) provider in Puerto Rico, as of Aug 15, 2017 (N=21 124)
Proportions might not add up to 100% because of missing data. Most effective contraceptive methods include 
intrauterine devices, implants, and partner sterilisation. Less than 1% of women using these methods will get 
pregnant during the first year of typical use. Moderately effective contraceptive methods include injectables, pills, 
patch, ring, and diaphragm. 6–12% of women using these methods will get pregnant during the first year of typical 
use. Least effective birth control methods include male and female condoms, withdrawal, sponge, fertility 
awareness methods, and spermicides. Least effective birth control methods have a failure rate of 18 or more 
pregnancies per 100 women who use these methods each year. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention 
have produced an overview of the effectiveness of family planning methods. Methods provided by Z-CAN included 
intrauterine devices, implants, injectables, pills, patch, ring, and male condoms.

access to the full range of reversible contraception, 
including LARC methods, within a complex public health 
response. Z-CAN also shows that it is possible to build 
capacity quickly with standardised and targeted training 
sessions and limited mentoring of committed providers 
and to provide high-quality, comprehensive contraceptive 
services in an emergency response.
Contraception has an important role in the Zika 
response because Zika virus infection during pregnancy 
increases the risk for microcephaly and other severe birth 
defects.2 Contraception could be a key response strategy 
in other public health emergencies in which prenatal 
exposures pose a severe risk to pregnant women and 
their infants.19 Guidance for rapid reproductive health 
assessment 
and 
programme 
implementation 
in 
emergency settings is available, but existing tools position 
contraception services as post-emergency activities rather 
than services to be implemented in the emergency 
phase.20 Z-CAN shows that with concerted effort, 
commitment, dedicated resources, and recognition of the 
benefits of giving women the option to prevent pregnancy 
during a time of crisis, it is possible to prioritise and 
implement effective contraceptive provision early in an 
emergency response.
Contraceptive use and provision in Puerto Rico before 
the Z-CAN programme was limited by policy, financial, 
and logistical barriers.4,21 Most of the 21 124 women seen 
by the Z-CAN programmme chose and received a LARC 
method, and most of these women were not using an 
effective method of contraception before Z-CAN; these 
findings suggest that when barriers to access are removed 
(eg, cost, limited service points, and lack of providers), 
most women who wanted to prevent pregnancy during 
the Zika virus outbreak chose a highly effective method 
of contraception. The choice of a LARC method was 
more likely in women who had previously given birth 
than in nulliparous women. Intrauterine devices are 
generally safe for all women, including nulliparous 
women.14 Providers might have misconceptions about 
the safety of intrauterine devices in nulliparous women, 
which have been shown to be associated with infrequent 
provision,22 emphasising the opportunity for providers to 
include LARC methods in counselling and eligibility 
determinations for all women seeking contraception. 
Although use of LARC methods by women using 
contraception in the USA is low (14%),10 our findings are 
consistent with those from other demonstration 
projects9,23 that removed barriers to LARC access such as 
cost, provider availability, geographic access, and 
comprehensive contraception counselling. Women who 
chose a short-acting method were given up to 6 months 
advanced supply. Women who perceived a return visit to 
receive additional contraceptive supplies as a barrier 
might have inadvertently been incentivised to choose a 
LARC method. However, results from the patient 
satisfaction survey suggested that most women left their 
initial Z-CAN visit with the method they were most 
interested in receiving. In the context of the Zika virus 
outbreak, improved access to contraception has the 
potential to decrease unintended pregnancies and the 
number of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes related 
to Zika virus infection.1,4,24
On the basis of results from multiple large-scale 
programmes and research studies to reduce barriers to 
contraceptive access, we anticipated that Z-CAN services 
would lead to an increase in LARC use. Because of their 
many advantages, including high effectiveness, safety, 
reversibility, user ease, high user satisfaction, and 
cost-effectiveness, LARC methods are crucial in public

health efforts to decrease unintended pregnancies. 
However, issues of perceived or actual provider coercion 
of women to choose LARC methods (or refuse LARC 
removals), particularly based on age, race, and class, have 
been reported.25,26 The historical context of unethical 
contraceptive practices and research in Puerto Rico and 
concerns for reproductive coercion with LARC provision 
were important considerations in programme design. An 
important element of the Z-CAN training and proctoring 
for all providers and clinic staff was to develop competency 
in delivering high-quality, patient-centred contraceptive 
counselling 
that 
facilitated 
autonomous 
decision 
making.13 Respondents to the satisfaction survey indicated 
high satisfaction with Z-CAN services, and nearly all 
women received the method they were most interested in 
after counselling, suggesting that participants received 
high-quality and patient-centred services through Z-CAN. 
The Z-CAN programme evaluation will include additional 
follow-up surveys of women participating in the 
programme to further assess quality of and satisfaction 
with Z-CAN services.
Through partnership and collaboration with a diverse 
group of stakeholders, Z-CAN reduced barriers to 
contraception as part of the public health response to the 
Zika virus outbreak and expanded the capacity of 
Puerto Rico’s health-care system to integrate same-day 
access to contraceptive services into normal clinic 
practice. Z-CAN efforts to build sustainability with key 
stakeholders include building the capacity of a broad 
network of providers who can provide access to 
contraception, 
raising 
awareness 
in 
women 
of 
reproductive age in Puerto Rico about the availability of 
contraceptive methods, expanding the number of 
contraceptive service access sites, eliminating prior 
authorisation requirements and cost-sharing in health 
insurance plans, and discussing continued availability of 
LARC methods in Puerto Rico through pricing 
negotiations and development of a sustainable supply 
chain with manufacturers. Although the total cost to 
implement, sustain, or replicate the Z-CAN programme 
is difficult to calculate, the most expensive aspects of the 
programme were provision of the contraceptive methods 
(almost all of which were donated in the case of Z-CAN) 
and provider reimbursement for services. Different 
contexts will have different cost challenges, but the 
financing requirements of these crucial aspects might be 
substantial and should be considered in programme 
design 
and 
sustainability 
planning. 
Successful 
sustainability will be achieved if the elimination of the 
most pressing barriers addressed by Z-CAN is 
maintained.
This programme has several strengths. To our 
knowledge, Z-CAN is the first contraception access 
programme developed as a primary prevention strategy 
to mitigate the effect of a Zika virus outbreak, and it is the 
first contraception access programme as a primary 
intervention to prevent adverse pregnancy and birth 
outcomes in the context of a public health emergency 
response. The Z-CAN programme contains important 
elements of both rapid programme design and 
implementation and sustainability planning and can be 
adapted 
to 
other 
settings 
in 
which 
improving 
contraceptive access could enhance the response to an 
emergency. The strong partnerships between programme 
teams and stakeholders in Puerto Rico and the high 
demand for contraceptive services also strengthened the 
programme.
The Z-CAN programme and this study also have 
several limitations. Although Z-CAN had broad coverage 
across the island, the programme was not able to provide 
services 
in 
municipalities 
without 
health-care 
infrastructure, so some women had to travel outside 
their municipality to access care. Because of the rapid 
design and implementation of Z-CAN and the specific 
threat of Zika virus to maternal and child health, our 
results are not readily generalisable to non-emergency 
situations. The response rate to the patient satisfaction 
survey was low, and the results of the survey might not be 
generalisable to all women who received Z-CAN services. 
The programme was implemented to serve women 
throughout the risk period for Zika virus transmission, 
while working towards sustainability of high-quality and 
accessible contraceptive services. Although the design 
and implementation phases were relatively fast, rate-
limiting steps (eg, design of a procurement and 
distribution system for donated contraceptive methods) 
slowed the delivery of services in the early phases of the 
programme. In view of the challenges of procurement 
and payment of LARC methods, reaching a level of 
sustainability of contraceptive services that closely 
mimics Z-CAN will probably be difficult.21
Z-CAN was designed as a short-term response for rapid 
implementation of contraceptive services in a complex 
emergency setting. Z-CAN has established an extensive 
network of providers in Puerto Rico and has served more 
than 21 000 women seeking to prevent pregnancy during 
the risk period for Zika virus infection. The programme 
might have prevented unintended pregnancies and birth 
defects related to Zika virus infections during the 
outbreak. Mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus has 
reached 95 countries worldwide and all but two countries 
in the Latin America Caribbean Region.27 On the basis of 
these preliminary results, Z-CAN is a model programme 
that could be replicated or adapted in these settings as 
part of emergency preparedness and response efforts. 
Additionally, Z-CAN’s design and implementation could 
be refined and adapted in other non-emergent settings, in 
which increased access to contraception could improve 
health outcomes.
