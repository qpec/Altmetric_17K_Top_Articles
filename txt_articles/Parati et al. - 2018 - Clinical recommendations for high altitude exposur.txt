Introduction
The travelling options currently available allow an increasingly large
number of individuals, including sedentary people, the elderly and dis-
eased patients, to reach high altitude (HA) locations, defined as loca-
tions higher than 2500 m above sea level (asl),1S i.e. the altitude above
which many of the physiological responses that represent challenges
for the human body start developing. Physiological acclimatization
mechanisms impose an increased workload on the cardiovascular sys-
tem, but the actual risk of adverse cardiovascular events associated
with HA exposure is still a debated issue.1–4
The aim of this article is to review the available evidence on the
effects of HA in cardiovascular patients and to address their risk of
developing clinically relevant events. This was done through multiple
Medline searches on the PubMed database, with the main aim of pro-
moting a generally safe access to mountains. Searched terms included
a combination of either ‘high altitude’ or ‘hypobaric hypoxia’ plus

response’, ‘systemic hypertension’, ‘pulmonary hypertension’, ‘ischae-
mic heart disease’, ‘cardiac revascularisation’, ‘heart failure’, ‘congeni-

previous review article on this topic,2S we now include the most
recent data on hypoxia-induced changes in left ventricular (LV) sys-
tolic and diastolic function, lung function and ventilation control,
blood coagulation, and on the effects of pharmacological interven-
tions. We also offer an update on the clinical and pathophysiological
findings related to the exposure to altitude of patients with pre-
existing cardiovascular conditions (ischaemic heart disease, heart fail-
ure, and arterial and pulmonary hypertension).
Physics and cardiovascular
physiology at high altitude
With increasing altitude, a progressive reduction in barometric pres-
sure, air temperature and air humidity can be observed (Figure 1).1S
For the purpose of this article, we refer to Imray et al.’s1S classification
of altitude ranges.
Barometric pressure directly determines the inspired oxygen
(O2) partial pressure and, in combination with alveolar ventilation,
sets the alveolar O2 partial pressure. Its reduction leads to a condi-
tion known as ‘hypobaric hypoxia’. In practice, at sea level, O2
constitutes 20.94% of total gas molecules in inspired air, which with
a normal rate of alveolar ventilation leads to an alveolar partial O2
pressure of roughly 100 mmHg for a barometric pressure of
roughly 760 mmHg.5S When breathing at 3000 m altitude asl, the
same percentage of O2 in the inspired air, combined with a lower
barometric pressure and higher rate of ventilation, results in an
alveolar partial O2 pressure of roughly 67 mmHg, corresponding to
what would occur breathing a hypoxic air mixture (fraction of
inspired O2 0.14) at sea level (Figure 1).5S A series of physiological
responses help to maintain adequate tissue O2 delivery and supply
at HA, through a process called ‘acclimatization’. Its efficacy
depends on the duration of individual’s exposure to altitude, age,
sea level partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and
minute ventilation.2,3,4S,5S These crucial processes include increase
in ventilation, cardiac output, red cell mass and blood O2 carrying
capacity, and other metabolic modifications at the microvascular
and cellular levels (Take home figure). Some of these mechanisms
are activated almost immediately, whereas others need hours to
days to attain full expression.2,4–6 A more extensive description of
the effects of HA exposure on cardiovascular physiology is pro-
vided in the seminal papers by Ba
¨rtsch et al.2

¨rtsch and Gibbs2 Physiological response to hypoxia. Life-sustaining oxygen delivery, in spite of a reduction
in the partial pressure of inhaled oxygen between 25% and 60% (respectively at 2500m and 8000m), is ensured by an increase in pulmonary ventila-
tion, an increase in cardiac output by increasing heart rate, changes in vascular tone, as well as an increase in haemoglobin concentration. BP, blood

Systemic blood pressure and heart rate
Acute exposure to hypoxia produces endothelium-dependent and
endothelium-independent systemic vasodilation,6S–9S which may ini-
tially induce some degree of blood pressure (BP) reduction. After a
few hours, this is counter-balanced, however, by a generalized
altitude-dependent increase in sympathetically mediated vasocon-
striction, caused primarily by arterial hypoxaemia through afferent
signalling to the cardiovascular control regions of the mid-brain via
the arterial peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid
bodies.5,6,10S As a result, a significant and persistent arterial BP
increase occurs shortly after the arrival at HA, proportional to the
altitude reached and more evident at night.7 This leads to a reduced
degree of the physiological blood pressure fall during sleep,8 which
persists at least over the first 7 days of altitude exposure.9 This is
accompanied by an increase in heart rate (HR) both at rest and dur-
ing exercise,10,11,11S although maximal HR achieved during exercise
at HA is lower compared to sea level (see Supplementary material
online, Table S1).2,11–14
Ventilation
With acute exposure to altitude, the decrease in PaO2 stimulates
peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies leading to sympa-
thetic activation and to an increase in minute ventilation.2,14
Moreover, mild interstitial lung fluid accumulation15 can occur in
physically active persons and decreases alveolar diffusing capacity.14
Hypoxia-induced hyperventilation leads to hypocapnia and respira-
tory alkalosis, which blunts the initial full hypoxic ventilatory
response. The combination of hyperventilation and resulting hypo-
capnia, with increased peripheral chemosensitivity and abnormal
loop gain in chemoreflex-induced respiratory regulation7S may lead
to the appearance of nocturnal periodic breathing (PB). This is an
abnormal ventilatory pattern, characterized by periods of central
apnoea or hypopnoea alternating with periods of hyperventilation,
mainly occurring during sleep.10,16,17,13S,18
With exposure over days to weeks, the sensitivity of the peripheral
chemoreceptors to hypoxia increases, resulting in a further increase
in sympathetic activity and enhancement of ventilation, despite the
progressive increase in arterial blood O2 content and lower partial
pressure
of
arterial
carbon
dioxide
(PaCO2)
(‘ventilatory
acclimatization’, see Supplementary material online, Table S1).19,14S
Pulmonary arterial pressure
Alveolar hypoxia and arterial hypoxaemia (to a lesser degree) induce
vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation, either directly and
through sympathetic activation,14,18,19,14S,15S resulting in increased pul-
monary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure (hypoxic
pulmonary vasoconstriction).14S Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
is a protective mechanism during regional alveolar hypoxia (e.g.

lated altitudes in a laboratory setting, according to the 1976 US standard Atmosphere by NASA.5S (central two columns); relationship between
altitude2S and environmental characteristics (temperature, humidity, and solar radiation) (box on the right-hand side). We used the 1976 US standard
atmosphere model by NASA to estimate barometric pressure at a given altitude, because the former is a function not only of altitude but also of lati-
tude. For similar altitudes, barometric pressure (and consequently also partial pressure of arterial oxygen) is higher the closer we are to the equator
line.

pneumonia) to shift blood flow to better ventilated lung regions, but
at HA, where the hypoxic stimulus is ubiquitous throughout the lungs,
global alveolar hypoxia leads to general pulmonary hypertension with
the risk of pulmonary oedema or right ventricular failure in the
extreme cases (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).16S We
found
only
one
study
investigating
pre-capillary
pulmonary
hypertension.17S Although the sample size was small (n= 14) and the
exposure to simulated HA was short (at rest and after 20 min of mild
exertion), non-invasive measures of the right heart function demon-
strated a predictable rise in pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, not
associated with a deterioration in the right heart function.
Left ventricular function
The left ventricle undergoes significant changes when exposed to
HA.11,20,21,17S In particular, a reduction in both diastolic and systolic
LV volumes and geometrical alterations (increase in the sphericity
index) occur, the diastolic function worsens and the LV contractility
and LV apex twist increase, the last change being similar to what is
observed in cases of subendocardial LV fibre dysfunction.20
Moreover, after 2 weeks of exposure to very HA, LV mass decreases
disproportionately when compared with the concomitant reduction
in total body weight (11% vs. 3% reduction for LV mass vs. body
mass, adjusted for body surface area, P < 0.05).21 Lung impairment via
cardiopulmonary interaction (with arterial hypoxaemia made worse
due to mild interstitial oedema), especially during the first 2 weeks,
and the increased LV inotropic stimulation by an increased sympa-
thetic activity are considered to play a role in the development of
these changes, but probably they cannot completely explain the
extent of the observed findings.
Recent evidence suggests that hypoxia itself can be the basis for LV
alterations. 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy performed before
and after ascent to Mt. Everest in healthy individuals revealed a
decrease in the cardiac creatine phosphate/adenosine triphosphate
(PCr/ATP) ratio by 18% (P < 0.01), similarly to what is observed in
patients with diseases associated with chronic hypoxia.21 All these
reductions returned to pre-trek levels 6 months after return to the
sea level. The authors concluded that a decrease in energy reserve
may be a ‘universal response to periods of sustained low O2 availabil-
ity, underlying hypoxia-induced cardiac dysfunction both in the
healthy human heart and in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases’.
Other effects
Mild dehydration and a hypoxic-mediated diuresis were found to lead
to an acute increase in haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration in
the first several days at HA,18S after which the renal production of
erythropoietin stimulates new red blood cell production to increase
red cell mass, with a further rise in haemoglobin concentration. In the
acute exposure phase, this can be associated with increased blood
coagulability.22 Nevertheless, an increased thrombotic risk at HA has
never been convincingly demonstrated, and the limited available data
are conflicting with respect to a hypothetical prothrombotic state.22,23
Heart failure
Heart failure (HF) is often associated with co-morbidities, such as pul-
monary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
kidney disease, cardiac ischaemia, anaemia, and thrombophilia. This
condition is also characterized by an increased chemosensitivity.20S
All these conditions are likely to make HF patients more vulnerable

to the HA environment. In spite of this, brief simulated HA exposure
was found to be safe for HF patients,24 even when performing mild
physical exercise. Agostoni et al.24 evaluated 38 patients with severe
stable HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III–IV] under-
going cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a progressive reduction
in inspired O2 from 21% (sea level) to 18%, 16%, and 14% (the last
simulating 3000m altitude). No episodes of angina, arrhythmias, or
electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of ischaemia occurred at any
simulated altitude. The reduction in maximum work rate achieved at
simulated altitude was progressively greater the more severe the
exercise limitation at sea level. Finally, patients who showed the larg-
est increase in the lung diffusion capacity for CO (DLCO) at sea level
during moderate exercise were those who showed the lowest exer-
cise capacity reduction at simulated altitude,20S linking HA exercise
performance to gas exchange adaptability.
Schmid et al.25 evaluated stable HF patients (NYHA Class II) exer-
cising during a short exposure to HA (3454 m, Jungfraujoch,
Switzerland) and at sea level. During HA exercise, mean peak VO2
decreased by 22%, without causing arrhythmias or altering echocar-
diographic variables, with the exception of an increase in pulmonary
artery systolic pressure (PAPs). Drug therapy of HF may also inter-
fere with HA adaptation mechanisms. Critical HF drugs such as beta-
blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act on
the chemoreceptors and on haemodynamic responses through adre-
nergic receptors, which are also involved in the alveolar–capillary gas
diffusion control (b2-receptors). Despite their importance in the
care of patients with HF which is incontrovertible at sea level, ACE
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do blunt the
kidney’s ability to produce erythropoietin and could limit the com-
pensatory rise in haematocrit and blood O2-carrying capacity that is
important at HA.21S,22S HIGHCARE (HIGH altitude CArdiovascular
REsearch) investigators reported that healthy subjects receiving the
non-cardioselective b2 antagonist carvedilol reached lower peak
exercise ventilation and lower VO2 peak at HA than those receiving
the selective b1 receptor blocker nebivolol.13 Carvedilol also
reduced hyperventilation during exercise, possibly by reducing
peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity. This effect may be favourable
in normoxia, because the fall in arterial O2 saturation is quite small at
sea level, but can be much greater and unfavourable at HA.20S,23S
Moreover, administration of diuretics should be based on the bal-
anced evaluation of signs of early dehydration or fluid gain. Among
the diuretics, acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor with mild
diuretic effect, which is frequently used for mountain sickness pro-
phylaxis and treatment, should be specifically considered.24S It should
be emphasized that the concomitant administration of acetazolamide
and other diuretics may increase the risk of dehydration and electro-
lyte imbalances at HA and should thus be carefully evaluated.
A final issue is related to periodic breathing. It can be present in HF
patients at sea level, both during sleep and exercise, but likely it will
worsen at HA.12S,25S,26 Whether it should be suppressed with aceta-
zolamide remains an issue yet to be clarified.
Very little is known about the effects of HA in patients who under-
went heart transplant. Living at moderate altitude seems not to be
harmful, but no data are available on the effects of acute HA
exposure.26S Recommendations for HF patients going to be exposed
to HA are summarized in Table 1.
Ischaemic heart disease
It has been suggested that living permanently at moderate altitude
might be beneficial, reducing CV mortality.27S Acute exposure to HA,
on the other hand, may represent a more challenging condition for the
cardiovascular system. Given that total O2 demand is constant for a
given workload and that myocardial O2 extraction is already very high
at sea level, with acute HA exposure cardiac output must increase to
maintain O2 delivery despite the reduced blood arterial O2 content.
In healthy subjects, epicardial coronary blood flow increases due to
vasodilation during acute HA exposure and thus there may not be any
significant impairment during exercise of coronary flow reserve, at least
up to 4500m.27 The actual risk of cardiac ischaemia associated with HA
is indeed unclear. On the one hand, stress testing performed in healthy
subjects above a simulated altitude of 8000 m27S did not induce ECG
alterations; on the other hand, changes in arterial wall properties may
reduce coronary O2 supply in diastole at HA, with possible clinical impli-
cations in subjects with silent coronary plaques. Evidence in this regard
has been obtained through calculation of the subendocardial viability
ratio (SEVR), defined as the ratio between diastolic pressure–time index
(DPTI, an estimate of myocardial O2 supply based on both coronary
artery driving pressure in diastole and diastolic time) and systolic pres-
sure–time index (SPTI, an estimate of myocardial O2 consumption in
systole). Subendocardial viability ratio, therefore, indirectly estimates
the degree of myocardial perfusion and was found to be significantly
reduced at 4559m in healthy volunteers (from 1.63± 0.15 to
1.18± 0.17; P< 0.001).28 The administration of acetazolamide was asso-
ciated with a smaller degree of SEVR reduction under hypobaric hypo-
xia exposure and with faster recovery after residing for 3 days at HA,
suggesting that acetazolamide may offset the reduction in subendocar-
dial O2 supply in these conditions.28 Similarly, at HA, also the O2 supply/
demand ratio (SEVR-CaO2, i.e. SEVR corrected for the arterial O2 con-
tent) displayed significant reductions, which were more pronounced
with placebo (from 29.6± 4.0 to 17.3± 3.0; P< 0.001), than with aceta-
zolamide (from 32.1± 7.0 to 22.3± 4.6; P< 0.001), indicating a smaller
reduction in subendocardial O2 supply/demand ratio with acetazola-
mide administration. The clinical relevance of a reduced SEVR at HA in
patients with an increased cardiovascular risk is suggested by a case
report of a middle-aged mild hypertensive subject with normal cardio-
pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at sea level, in whom acute expo-
sure to an altitude of 3340m was responsible not only for a marked
reduction in SEVR and in SEVR-CaO2 but also for the development of
angina and ischaemic ECG changes when cardiopulmonary stress test-
ing was repeated at HA. This occurred 2 days after a negative stress test
at sea level, the only difference being the acute exposure to HA.29
Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may face more diffi-
culties with HA exposure, because of the already increased basal cor-
onary flow at sea level, impairment in arterial elastic properties
induced by atheromatous lesions and microvascular dysfunction.
However, there is little evidence available about HA-induced ischae-
mia in CAD patients. Schmid et al.30 did not find signs of ischaemia
during CPET performed at 3454m in 22 low-risk ischaemic patients
with a normal CPET at sea level. The HA evaluation was performed
6–18 months after revascularization, either by percutaneous stenting
or by surgical coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and after
wash-out from beta-blockers. The same conclusion was reached by

tion about ongoing treatment, previous performance of any revascu-
larization procedure and time since acute MI occurrence reduce the
ability to generalize these findings to a wider population.
Evidence for ‘medium-risk’ patients is even more limited. One
study examined the simulated altitude effects on coronary flow in 8
medium-risk patients undergoing stress testing at a simulated altitude
of 2500m. The results showed an inability of their coronary blood
flow to adapt after an increase in demand.30
Percutaneous revascularization
Only one study and a couple of case reports are available on this
topic. In the above-mentioned study by Schmid et al.30, among the 22
low-risk, revascularized ischaemic patients, 15 had ST-elevation MI
and 7 non-ST-elevation MI, undergoing CPET at HA. Among these
patients, 15 had undergone percutaneous revascularization, and
none
showed
signs
of
ischaemia
during
altitude
exercise.30
Moreover, Wu et al.32 described the case of a 49-year-old male engi-
neer with a history of CAD treated with 2 drug-eluting stents who,
2 years later, went to work on the Qinghai-Tibet railway (4905m)
for 10 days. ECG, echocardiography, and polysomnography did not
show any signs of ischaemia or arrhythmia on multiple trips over
3 years. On the other hand, Basavarajaiah and O’Sullivan33 reported
2 cases of very late stent thrombosis in patients undergoing intense
physical exertion at moderate altitude (3000 m and 1300 m, 16 and
48 months after drug-eluting stent implantation, respectively).
However, no evidence supports a causal link between HA and stent
thrombosis in these patients. In contrast, intense physical activity has
been associated with late stent thrombosis at sea level.29S
Coronary artery bypass grafting
In the aforementioned study by Schmidt et al.,30 7 patients underwent
CABG. A rapid ascent to HA (3454 m) and submaximal exercise
were found to be safe 6 months after CABG.30S
Recommendations for ischaemic heart disease patients are
reported in Table 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S2.
Systemic arterial hypertension
As described above, BP increases after a few hours at HA (especially
at night) and remains virtually unchanged over the following days.34
Hypertensive patients may be more susceptible to HA due to an
already elevated hypoxic peripheral and central chemoreflex
sensitivity30S,32S and to alteration in calcium homeostasis.33S,34S

General recommendations for
all cardiovascular patients
Patients should continue pre-existing medications at HA.
All therapy changes, especially dual anti-antiplatelet
therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation, must be
discussed with a doctor before enacting. Individuals
who do not engage in physical exertion at low altitude
should not engage in physical activity at HA.

Acetazolamide administration seems to reduce the risk
of subendocardial ischaemia at HA in healthy subjects,
and thus use of acetazolamide for AMS prevention
might be helpful. No data are available, however, in
patients with CAD.

The HIGHCARE-Himalaya study found that the exposure of
healthy volunteers to progressively higher altitudes (up to 5400m)
was associated with a progressive, marked increase in systolic
and diastolic ambulatory BP, which was more evident than the corre-
sponding increase in conventional BP measurements.7 This increase
became evident a few hours after HA was reached, persisted during
the prolonged altitude sojourn (12 days) and was more pronounced
in older subjects (Figure 2).
The efficacy of a number of antihypertensive drugs at HA has been
tested in volunteers, also through the various studies performed in the
frame of the HIGHCARE projects. Non-selective beta-blockade with
carvedilol in healthy subjects resulted in a significant reduction in the
BP response to HA but was associated with reduced arterial haemo-
globin O2 saturation and exercise tolerance. In contrast, a highly selec-
tive beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker (nebivolol), while also
effective in reducing the pressor response to HA, preserved the nor-
mal nocturnal BP dipping, and was associated with a lesser reduction in
exercise tolerance at HA.8 Monotherapy with a long-acting ARB (tel-
misartan) demonstrated an impressive response on both daytime and
night-time BP, but only up to an altitude of 3400m. During acute expo-
sure to a higher altitude (5400m), the drug was ineffective, because of
the concomitant suppression of the renin–angiotensin system.7 The
mechanisms underlying the increase in BP above an altitude of 5000m
are indeed complex in nature, which could explain different responses
obtained with different antihypertensive drugs. Interestingly, also aceta-
zolamide was found to antagonize the BP rise induced by HA, as well
as the parallel occurrence of central sleep apnoea.9,35
The effects of altitude exposure on hypertensive patients have also
been specifically assessed. Wu et al.36 studied Chinese railroad work-
ers and reported a greater increase in blood pressure at HA in hyper-
tensive compared with healthy individuals. This observation was
confirmed and expanded in the HIGHCARE-Andes Lowlanders
Study,35 where acute exposure of hypertensive patients, permanently
living at sea level, to an altitude of 3259 m, induced a further signifi-
cant increase in 24 h BP above their already elevated pressures
observed at sea level, with a mildly steeper rise during night-time
than during daytime periods.
When considering the effects of antihypertensive treatment at alti-
tude in patients suffering from high blood pressure included in the
HIGHCARE ANDES study, the combination of a dihydropyridine cal-
cium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker [nifedi-
pine GITS (Gastro Intestinal Therapeutic System) and telmisartan]
was found to be effective in controlling BP at HA in hypertensive
patients.35
In a large recent study by Keyes et al.,35S 672 trekkers, 60 with a
prior diagnosis of hypertension, underwent conventional blood
pressure measurement at rest at altitudes of 2860, 3400 and
4300 m. No significant differences in mean systolic BP (SBP) and
diastolic BP (DBP) among altitudes were found either in normoten-
sive or in hypertensive trekkers, probably because of the large
interindividual variability in BP levels at different altitudes obtained
with the method of BP measurement used in this study. At 3400m,
60% of normotensive participants had a BP within 10mmHg of
their BP at 2860m, while in 21% BP increased above and in 19%
decreased below this threshold. Conventional BP decreased with
altitude exposure in a greater proportion of hypertensive than of
normotensives trekkers (36% vs. 21% at 3400 m, P = 0.01 and 30%
vs. 15% at 4300 m, P = 0.05). These results should be interpreted
on the background of the acknowledged limitations of conventional
BP measurements.35S Indeed, conventional BP measurements at
rest have been demonstrated to be poorly sensitive to environ-
mental influences, in particular when assessing BP response to
altitude.7,8 This limitation is emphasized by considering additional
data reported by Keyes et al., obtained through the few good qual-
ity 24 h ambulatory BP recordings obtained in a very small sub-
group of trekkers (2 hypertensive and 4 normotensive individuals).
Severe hypertension was recorded in five participants, asympto-
matic, regardless of their conventional BP values. Moreover, an
increase in nocturnal SBP and DBP in hypertensive but not in nor-
motensive participants was reported, although the authors did not
show their mean 24h, daytime, night-time SBP and DBP values.
This study further emphasizes the limitations carried by focusing
only on conventional BP measurements performed at rest, when
exploring the environmental effects on BP at altitude.
Recommendations for hypertensive patients are summarized in Table 3.
Arrhythmias and implantable
devices
Arrhythmias
The increased sympathetic activity5 and decreased SaO2 characterizing
HA exposure, in addition to the increase in right ventricular work and in
cellular transmembrane shifts of potassium, might be a favourable sub-
strate for arrhythmias. However, to date, an increase in malignant
arrhythmias at HA has never been systematically demonstrated. Kujanik
et al. compared ECG Holter recordings of healthy volunteers obtained
at HA and at sea level. They found increased ventricular and supraven-
tricular ectopy already at mild-moderate altitude (1350m), but these
findings were not correlated with a significant increase in sustained ven-
tricular arrhythmias.37 Gibelli et al. evaluated microvolt T-wave alternans
(MTWA) and HR variability in eight healthy trained subjects at sea level
and after a mountain climbing expedition (Pakistan, 8150m), both at
rest and during exercise. Despite enhanced sympathetic activity,

MTWA testing during exercise at HA was negative in all participants.38
The authors concluded that there is a low risk of dangerous arrhythmias
in healthy trained subjects during exercise under hypobaric hypoxia
conditions. The possibility, however, of an increased arrhythmic risk in
patients with heart diseases favouring arrhythmias, remains an issue yet
to be properly addressed in future studies.37S During sleep at HA, bra-
dycardia, bradyarrhythmias and cycling of heart rate with periodic
breathing are common findings in young subjects.11S Recommendations
are summarized in Supplementary material online, Table S3.
Pacing and implantable cardioverter
devices
Little information is available. Brief exposure to a simulated altitude
of 4000m apparently does not affect ventricular stimulation thresh-
olds39 and a recent observational study showed a low implantable
cardioverter device (ICD) activation rate (4%) in patients living at
altitude.38S Recommendations are summarized in Supplementary
material online, Table S3.
Pulmonary hypertension
We found just one very recent study using flight simulation (exposure
to a simulated altitude of 1700–2500 m) to determine the need
for supplemental O2 during prolonged hypoxia in patients with
pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this study, patients with PAH
[World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 with functional class
(FC) III symptoms at diagnosis] on vasodilator treatment did not
experience any acute deterioration in RV function during simulated
mild altitude, at rest or following mild exertion.39S
The known physiological effects of hypoxia, however, suggest that
in-flight O2 administration should be considered for patients with
WHO-FC III and IV pulmonary hypertension and for those with
PaO2 consistently<60 mmHg.40S–42S Similarly, such patients, as well
as patients known to be affected by pulmonary hypertension, should
consider
the
use
of
supplemental
O2
when
exposed
to
altitudes>1500–2000 m.43S Recommendations are summarized in
Supplementary material online, Table S3.
Congenital heart disease
Adults with congenital heart disease should be stratified by specific
haemodynamic and pathophysiological conditions to assess their fit-
ness to HA exposure.40
Patients with concurrent pulmonary hypertension should be care-
ful when going to HA. Indeed, the occurrence of an elevated pulmo-
nary pressure due to a pre-existing clinical condition worsens the
effects of HA exposure. This is exemplified by the fact that corrective
surgery for Fontan patients, in whom maintaining low pulmonary
resistance is essential, has a worse outcome when performed at

HA41,44S, 45S than at sea level. On the other hand, after successful sur-
gical correction, short-term HA exposure (at 3454 m) had no nega-
tive impact on pulmonary blood flow and exercise capacity when
compared with controls and was clinically well tolerated.41
Patients with cyanotic heart conditions and right to left shunting
are likely to develop more severe hypoxaemia than healthy individu-
als as the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance at HA can worsen
the right-to-left shunt.46S,47S However, reduced blood O2 content is
not dangerous by itself, because cardiac output and haematocrit
increase sufficiently to maintain adequate systemic O2 delivery.
Various trials carried out in a laboratory setting and during short-
term exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at altitude suggest that some of
those patients are able to maintain O2 delivery even with reductions
in inspired pO2, by increasing their cardiac output along with their
already higher haematocrit associated with their congenital cardiac
abnormalities.42,43,44
Recommendations are summarized in Supplementary material
online, Table S3 and can be applied also for air travel, although specific
data in this regard are largely missing.
Cerebrovascular conditions
Ischaemic stroke
Even though evidence is limited, HA exposure seems to pose a risk
of cerebral ischaemia for patients who already have suffered an
ischaemic stroke,29,45,46 both because of the direct effect of hypoxia
and due to a reduced cerebrovascular reactivity.47,48S
Whether the increase in haematocrit and the greater blood viscos-
ity also contribute to a greater stroke risk at HA is unknown. There
are, however, data, although somehow controversial,19 suggesting
that highlanders and people working at altitude might have a higher
risk of stroke compared to those living and working at low
altitude.48,49
Although presently there is not enough evidence to provide any
strong recommendation on this issue, it has been suggested only based
on clinical experience that carotid ultrasound imaging, commonly per-
formed in daily practice to check for the existence of complicated pla-
ques or severe carotid stenosis, might help to assess the risk of new
events during HA exposure after atherothrombotic stroke.
Haemorrhagic stroke
Arterial blood pressure elevation at HA increases the risk of rupture
of cerebral aneurysms and arterial venous malformations as well as
the theoretical risk of hypertension-related cerebral haemorrhage.50
Nevertheless, there is no evidence on the incidence of intracranial
haemorrhage in alpine regions. We could not find any systematic
study evaluating the incidence of intracranial bleeding at HA, nor any
case report on this topic, although, admittedly, intracranial haemor-
rhage could be one of the causes of some of the sudden death cases
reported in this condition.
Recommendations for cerebrovascular patients are summarized in
Supplementary material online, Table S3.
Limitations
This article summarizes the available evidence on the effects of HA
exposure in patients with a variety of cardiovascular problems, aimed
at providing practical recommendations for preventive and therapeu-
tic decision-making.
Some general limitations of our article, which apply to all sections,
should be acknowledged (see Supplementary material online, Table
S4). In the field of HA medicine only a limited number of well-
conducted studies are available, which usually have small sample sizes,
primarily evaluating young subjects and commonly with lack a ran-
domized controlled design. Moreover, studies are often not fully
comparable because they are performed at different altitude levels
and are confounded by a number of different factors, such as the
degree of baseline physical conditioning, extent of physical effort at
HA, speed of ascent, climate changes, and latitude. Finally, different
test settings have been used to investigate the cardiovascular effects
of altitude exposure, either in the field or in an experimental labora-
tory with simulated altitude with either normobaric or hypobaric
hypoxia exposure. All these limitations and the lack of a standardized
data reporting system make it very difficult to verify the validity and
strength of data from a given trial as well as the consistency of results
among studies and to reproducibly and precisely assign the observed
effects to different altitude levels.
Conclusions
Available studies, although only in a few instances being performed
according to a randomized double-blind controlled design, provide
indications that, in spite of their ‘soft’ nature, might nevertheless allow
for a safer exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at altitude in patients with
a variety of cardiovascular conditions, offering some practical advices
and guidance for both patients and physicians. The relative lack of
highly powered studies, and the type of data summarized in this
article, emphasize the need for additional trials of suitable size to bet-
ter address the cardiovascular implications of both acute and chronic
HA exposure.
