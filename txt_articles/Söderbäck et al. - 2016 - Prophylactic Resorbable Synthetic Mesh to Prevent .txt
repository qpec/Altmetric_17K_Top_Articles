Background: Wound dehiscence and incisional hernia are potentially serious compli-
cations following abdominal surgery, especially if performed through a midline incision. 
Although prophylactic reinforcement with on-lay mesh has been shown to reduce this 
risk, a permanent mesh carries the risk of seroma formation, infection, and persistent 
pain. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of a reabsorbable on-lay mesh to 
reinforce the midline suture in patients with high risk for wound dehiscence or incisional 
hernia.
Method: Sixteen patients with three or more risk factors for wound dehiscence or 
incisional hernia were included. A TIGR® Matrix mesh, composed of a mixture of 40% 
copolymer fibers of polyglycolide, polylactide, and polytrimethylene carbonate and 60% 
copolymer fibers of polylactide and polytrimethylene carbonate, was placed on the 
aponeurosis with an overlap of five on either side and fixated with continuous monofil-
ament polydioxanone suture. All postoperative complications were registered at clinical 
follow-up.
results: Mean follow-up was 9 months. One patient developed a seroma that needed 
drainage and antibiotic treatment. One patient had a wound infection that needed 
antibiotic treatment. There was no complication requiring a reoperation. No wound 
dehiscence or incisional hernia was seen.
conclusion: On-lay placement of TIGR® Matrix is safe and may provide a feasible way 
of reinforcing the suture line in patients with high risk for postoperative wound dehis-
cence or incisional hernia. Larger samples are required, however, if one is to draw any 
conclusion regarding the safety and effectiveness of this technique.

Wound dehiscence and incisional hernia after laparotomy are 
serious and costly complications. The problem of incisional hernia 
is often underestimated since the hernia may not be clinically obvi-
ous until several years after the operation and thus does not always 
come to the attention of the surgeon. Recent studies have shown 
that the risk for wound dehiscence and incisional hernia can be 
reduced by meticulous suture technique (1). However, even with 
a careful suturing around 5% of patients undergoing laparotomy 
suffer from wound complications (2) that may lead to prolonged 
hospital stay and severe morbidity (3). Risk factors for wound dehis-
cence and incisional hernia include acute surgery, reoperation, age 
over 80 years, generalized malignant disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), hypoalbuminemia, sepsis, obesity, 
anemia, insulin-treated diabetes with secondary complications, 
steroid treatment, smoking, chemotherapy, radiation therapy of 
the abdominal wall, and resection of the abdominal wall (3–8).
Reinforcement of the suture line with a mesh may be an 
effective way of preventing wound dehiscence (9). By placing a 
polypropylene mesh on the aponeurosis after closure of the mid-
line, the risk for incisional hernia has been shown to be reduced 
by at least two-thirds (10, 11). A synthetic mesh left permanently 
in the subcutaneous tissue, however, is associated with wound 
complications that may be difficult to manage, including infec-
tion, seroma, and chronic pain (12).
A possible way of reducing the frequency of wound complica-
tions due to permanent mesh placement may be to use a slowly 
resorbable mesh. Biological meshes have been used for strength-
ening of the abdominal wall in cases where a gradually resolving 
mesh is necessary for the long-term outcome. To date, however, 
biological meshes have been very expensive and do not always 
have optimal properties for this purpose. The TIGR® Matrix 
Surgical Mesh, on the other hand, is a completely synthetic mesh 
that is gradually absorbed. It is intended for use in reinforcement 
of soft tissues where weakness exists, in procedures involving 
repair of hernia and abdominal wall defect, abdominal wall 
reinforcement, and muscle flap reinforcement (13).
The aim of this pilot study was to see if TIGR Matrix is feasible 
as a mesh for prophylactic reinforcement in high-risk incisions.

This study included patients from Uppsala University Hospital, 
the Uppsala Cancer Clinic, and Karolinska University Hospital, 
Huddinge, undergoing surgery through a midline incision. 
Inclusion criteria were the presence of at least three documented 
risk factors for incisional hernia or wound dehiscence.
Listed risk factors for this study were: reoperation, age over 
80 years, generalized malignant decease (presence of distant 
metastases at the time of surgery), COPD Grades III–IV accord-
ing to the GOLD classification (FEV1 <50% of the expected), 
serum albumin level <20 g/l, sepsis, infection in combination 
with two or more of the following: abnormal body temperature, 
heart rate, respiratory rate or blood gas, and white blood cell 
count, BMI >35, hemoglobin <80 g/l, diabetes with secondary 
complications (angiopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy) and 
insulin treatment, steroid treatment (with at least 1 mg beta-
methasone daily or equivalent) for 7 days preoperatively, smok-
ing (at least 10 cigarettes a day for 1 year), chemotherapy (last 
administration within 2 weeks prior to surgery), and radiation 
therapy of the abdominal wall.
The abdominal wall was closed with continuous Polydioxanon 
Suture (PDS) with a 4:1 ratio of the suture to incision length. 
After closing the midline incision according to usual routines, 
the aponeurosis was reinforced by on-lay TIGR® Matrix Surgical 
Mesh (Novus Scientific Uppsala Sweden).
TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh is composed of two different 
synthetic resorbable fibers having different degradation char-
acteristics. The first fiber, constituting 40% of the matrix, is a 
copolymer of polyglycolide, polylactide, and polytrimethylene 
carbonate. The second fiber, making up 60% of the matrix, is a 
copolymer of polylactide and polytrimethylene carbonate. Both 
fibers are degraded by bulk hydrolysis, resulting in a decreasing 
tensile strength caused by loss of fibers. In vitro tests have shown 
that the first fiber (polyglycolide, polylactide, and polytrimethyl-
ene carbonate) loses its functional tensile strength after 2 weeks, 
and in vivo studies in the abdominal wall of sheep have shown 
that it is fully absorbed after 4 months (14). Corresponding 
figures for the second fiber (polylactide and polytrimethylene 
carbonate) are 9 months and approximately 36 months, respec-
tively. As the first fiber is resorbed, the elasticity increases, which 
improves collagen formation. The TIGR Matrix Surgical Mesh 
is a resorbable mesh implant, classified as a Class III device in 
accordance with the European Medical Device Directive (MDD) 
93/42/EEC, Annex IX, Section 2.4, Rule 8.
In the present study, TIGR® Matrix was used to reinforce 
the midline suture. After closing the midline, with best possible 
suturing technique, a TIGR® Matrix mesh was placed on-lay on 
the rectal aponeurosis with an overlap of 5 cm on either side. 
The mesh was fixated with a continuous PDS 2-0 suture on 
each side parallel to the midline incision (Figure 1), followed 
by skin closure. All patients were followed up according to the 
clinical practice at each unit, but always including a follow-up

visit 1 month after surgery. Endpoints in this study were wound 
dehiscence, wound infection, seroma, and persistent pain.
resUlTs
Sixteen patients were included in the study. Baseline data and 
outcome are presented in Table 1. Most of the patients underwent 
peritonectomy with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases. Mean follow-up time in the 
study was 9 months. Of the 16 patients, 1 had a seroma that needed 
drainage and antibiotic treatment, and 1 had a wound infection 
that needed antibiotic treatment. There was no complication 
requiring a reoperation. No dehiscence or incisional hernia was 
seen. None of the surgeons found the on-lay fixation technically 
difficult or time consuming. There were no major complaints 
regarding discomfort from the mesh.
DiscUssion
On-lay placement of TIGR® Matrix is safe and may be a feasible 
way of reinforcing the midline suture in patients with high risk 
for postoperative wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. No 
major complication, incisional hernia, or dehiscence was seen 
after follow-up of at least 6 months. However, larger samples are 
required if one is to draw any conclusion regarding the safety and 
effectiveness of this technique.
Three surgeons from three different hospitals performed the 
procedures. None of the surgeons found the procedure technically 
difficult or time consuming. One patient developed a seroma that 
caused moderate symptoms. As the mesh is resorbed, the seroma 
formation should also resolve. Similarly, pain from the mesh 
as well as non-septic mesh inflammation may also be managed 
conservatively, awaiting the gradual resorption of the mesh.
The need for relaparotomy is not rare in patients undergoing 
abdominal surgery. Performing a laparotomy through a mesh 
from a previous laparotomy may be complicated, with increased 
risk for infection or other wound complication. This problem is 
also avoided by using a resorbable mesh.
The present study demonstrates that reinforcement of the 
midline suture after laparotomy using a synthetic resorbable 
mesh is not associated with major adverse events. It was too 
small, however, to be able to provide definite evidence for the 
effectiveness of the technique. Whether or not late incisional 
hernias develop when the mesh is completely resorbed can only 
be determined in studies with longer follow-up and under more 
controlled circumstances. The present study was intended as a 
pilot study before the initiation of a larger randomized clinical 
trial with incisional hernia and wound dehiscence as primary 
endpoints.
In conclusion, the prophylactic placement of an on-lay slowly 
resorbable mesh to strengthen the midline suture in patients with 
high risk for incisional hernia or wound dehiscence appears to 
be a safe technique. A larger controlled and randomized trial 
is required to fully evaluate the effect of a prophylactic resorb-
able mesh on the development of incisional hernia and wound 
dehiscence.
