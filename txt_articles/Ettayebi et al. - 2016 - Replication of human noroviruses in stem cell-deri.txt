The major barrier to research and development of effective interventions for human noroviruses
(HuNoVs) has been the lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system. HuNoVs
are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. We report the successful cultivation of
multiple HuNoV strains in enterocytes in stem cell–derived, nontransformed human intestinal
enteroid monolayer cultures. Bile, a critical factor of the intestinal milieu, is required for strain-
dependent HuNoV replication. Lack of appropriate histoblood group antigen expression in
intestinal cells restricts virus replication, and infectivity is abrogated by inactivation (e.g.,
irradiation, heating) and serum neutralization.This culture system recapitulates the human
intestinal epithelium, permits human host-pathogen studies of previously noncultivatable
pathogens, and allows the assessment of methods to prevent and treat HuNoV infections.
H
uman noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the most
common cause of epidemic and sporadic
cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide,
and are the leading cause of food-borne
gastroenteritis (1–3). Since the introduction
of rotavirus vaccines, HuNoVs have become the pre-
dominant gastrointestinal pathogen within pediat-
ric populations in developed countries (4). HuNoVs
are highly contagious, with rapid person-to-person
transmission directly through the fecal-oral route

Downloaded from 
 and indirectly from contact with contaminated
fomites or by consumption of contaminated food
or water. In addition to causing morbidity and
mortality in young children, immunocompromised
patients, and the elderly, norovirus disease causes
substantial economic burden as a result of health
care costs and loss of productivity (5, 6). HuNoVs
have resisted efforts to establish in vitro cultiva-
tion methods for more than 40 years. Previous
reports of possible cultivation systems have not
been reproduced or support limited replication
of a single strain (7–10). Insight into the patho-
physiology of HuNoV infections has been elu-
cidated primarily from studies using healthy
adult volunteers. The lack of a reproducible cul-
ture system for HuNoVs has remained the major
barrier to achieving a full mechanistic under-
standing of their replication, stability, antigenic
complexity, and evolution. An in vitro cultiva-
tion system is critical to define HuNoV-host
interactions that underlie the high virus infectivity
and explosive illness they cause, to determine
how to prevent transmission, and to treat infec-
tions and illness.
Ex vivo human intestinal enteroid
cultures support HuNoV replication
Attempts to culture HuNoVs in transformed
intestinal epithelial cells and in primary human
immune cells have been unsuccessful (8, 11, 12).
We hypothesized that a novel culture system
pioneered by the Clevers group in the Nether-
lands, which generates human intestinal enter-
oids (HIEs) from stem cells isolated from intestinal
crypts in human intestinal tissues (13, 14) and
recapitulates the natural intestinal epithelium,
should support HuNoV growth. These multicell-
ular, differentiated HIEs are nontransformed,
physiologically active cultures that respond to
agonists and contain multiple intestinal epi-
thelial cell types (enterocytes, goblet, enter-
oendocrine, and Paneth cells), whether grown as
three-dimensional or monolayer cultures (fig. S1)
(13–16).
To evaluate whether these novel cultures sup-
port replication of the previously noncultivatable
HuNoVs, we inoculated monolayers of HIEs with
GII.4 HuNoVs, which cause the majority of pan-
demic and outbreak infections worldwide (1).
Jejunal monolayer cultures were readily infected
by stool filtrates of multiple GII.4 variants (GII.4/
2006a, GII.4/2006b-1 to -3, GII.4/2009, and GII.4/
2012-1 and -2; table S1). At 96 hours post-infection

 (hpi), 1.5 to 2.5 log10 increases in genome equiv-
alents of viral progeny were identified by reverse
transcription–quantitative polymerase chain re-
action (RT-qPCR) in comparison to the amount
of genomic RNA detected at 1 hpi after removal
of the virus inoculum and two washes of the
monolayers to remove unattached virus (Fig. 1A,
relative changes indicated above the bars for
each variant). All inocula used to infect enter-
oid cultures were fecal filtrates, which suggests
that bacteria were not required as cofactors
for infection, in contrast to previous reports of
HuNoV cultivation in BJAB and Raji B cell lines
(9, 10). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in stool filtrates
did not promote replication, as there was no re-
duction in HuNoV replication in samples treated
with polymyxin B that reduced LPS levels from
4.84 to 0.63 endotoxin units (12) (fig. S2A).
We next evaluated the growth characteristics
of HuNoV infection by assessing cytopathic ef-
fect (CPE), antigen detection, and the kinetics
of infection. Cytopathic changes such as cell
rounding, destruction of the monolayer, and an
increase in the number of dead cells as assessed by
trypan blue staining were observed in GII.4-
inoculated cultures. CPE was observed for the
tested GII.4 variants GII.4/2012-1, GII.4/2012-
2, and GII.4/2006b-3 (see table S1 for strain
details; GII.4/2012-1 results shown in fig. S2B,
left panel). CPE was not reduced by inocula-
tion with polymyxin B–treated samples (fig. S2B),
and CPE was not observed in cultures inoculated
with g-irradiated stool filtrate (fig. S2B, right
panels), which abrogated viral replication. Viral
replication was demonstrated by detecting the
major viral capsid protein (VP1) with nonstructural
proteins [RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol)
and nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase)] or double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA, an intermediate in HuNoV
RNA replication) in infected cells by confocal
microscopy (Fig. 1B and fig. S3, A to C). Immuno-
fluorescent analysis for VP1 revealed that 35 to
45% of cells in the HIE monolayer were infected,
which was confirmed by flow cytometry where
41% of cells were VP1-positive (Fig. 1C). HIE
cultures contain multiple cell types (stem cells,
Paneth cells, and goblet, enteroendocrine, and
enterocyte cells), and only the enterocytes were
infected. Detection of villin, an enterocyte marker,
in VP1-positive cells showed that HuNoVs infected
and replicated in enterocytes (Fig. 1B).
Productive infection was confirmed by trans-
mission electron microscopy, which yielded images
of virus particles with typical morphology (17) in
the supernatant of infected HIEs (Fig. 1D). Two
particle sizes were detected (Fig. 1D), with par-
ticles of the expected size (31.6 ± 3.3 nm) and
some smaller particles (18.5 ± 3.7 nm; Fig. 1D,
inset). Both particle sizes have been observed
previously in stools of children infected with
HuNoVs and in preparations of recombinant
virus-like particles (VLPs) (18). By Western blot
analysis, nonstructural polyprotein synthesis and
processing [as evidenced by the detection of sev-
eral viral protein genome-linked (VPg)–containing
polyprotein processing intermediates] and cap-
sid protein (VP1) production were first detected
at 12 hpi in infected cells but not at 1 or 6 hpi or
in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1E). Consistent with
the production of virus particles (Fig. 1D), VP1
was detected in the culture supernatant by 24 hpi
(Fig. 1E). Replication was confirmed by the growth
kinetics of GII.4/2012-1 in jejunal HIE monolayer
cultures, which showed a time-dependent increase
in genome equivalents between 1 and 24 hpi,
after which a plateau was reached (Fig. 1F). Be-
cause polyprotein processing, RNA replication,
and synthesis of subgenomic RNA are required
for VP1 and particle production (19), these findings
demonstrate that an entire HuNoV replication
cycle occurs in infected HIEs by 24 hpi. GII.4/
2009 and GII.4/2012-1 HuNoV could also be
passaged in jejunal HIEs with optimized con-
ditions (Fig. 1G, GII.4/2009 shown; see below
for conditions). Cells expressing VP1 and VPg
were observed during infection with passaged
virus (fig. S4A), and particles of both sizes (fig.
S4B) were seen. Together, these results indicate
that GII.4 HuNoV infection of HIEs results in a
productive and complete virus replication cycle,

 and that this system can be used to define cel-
lular processes that HuNoVs co-opt to replicate
and induce pathogenesis.
Replication of some HuNoV strains
requires the presence of bile
Noroviruses are genetically diverse. Most HuNoVs
are classified into two genogroups (GI and GII),
which are further subdivided into nine GI gen-
otypes and 20 GII genotypes. We next tested
whether monolayer cultures of jejunal HIEs could
support replication of other HuNoV strains (GI.1,
GII.3, GII.17). Initially, no replication of these
viruses was observed. Consequently, several com-
ponents of the intestinal milieu were assessed
for their ability to promote replication of these
HuNoVs in HIE monolayers. Addition of pro-
teases (trypsin, pancreatin) required for the rep-
lication of another gastrointestinal virus, human
rotavirus, failed to enhance HuNoV replication.
In contrast, viral replication, as demonstrated by
RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence analyses,
was observed in HIEs pretreated with nontoxic
levels of human bile and inoculated with stool
filtrates of GII.3, GII.17, and GI.1 HuNoVs (Fig. 2,
A and B, and fig. S5). Replication occurred in a
bile dose–dependent manner, with concentra-
tions of human bile greater than or equal to
0.5% being required for GII.3 replication (Fig.
2A). Bile from different sources, such as human,
sow, and commercially available bovine and por-
cine, all promoted GII.3 replication without CPE
(fig. S6). Assessment of the kinetics of GII.3 in-
fection demonstrated that, similar to GII.4 strains,
virus yields increased between 1 and 24 hpi
(Fig. 2C). The addition of bile to GII.4 HuNoV-
inoculated cultures was not required, but it en-
hanced virus replication (fig. S7). Enhancement
was observed when human (fig. S7A), piglet (fig.
S7B), porcine (fig. S7C), and sow (fig. S7D) bile
were evaluated.
These results indicate that there are strain-
specific differences in the requirement for factors
in the intestinal milieu such as bile to support
or enhance HuNoV replication. Of note, even
with the addition of bile, the increases in yields
for GII.3 as well as for GII.17 and GI.1 virus
strains were lower than that observed for the
GII.4 variants. In 12 independent experiments
performed in triplicate on jejunal HIEs, the mean
relative increase of GII.3 genome equivalents from
1 hpi to a later time point ranged from a factor of
10 to a factor of 173 (average increase, factor of
48); for GII.4 HuNoVs, the mean relative increase
ranged from a factor of 34 to a factor of 6730
(average increase, factor of 670). Evaluation of
additional intestinal components or further op-
timization of conditions may be required to achieve
higher levels of replication for GII.3 and other
HuNoVs. To date, we have successfully obtained
replication of two HuNoV genogroups compris-
ing four genotypes of virus (including four GII.4
variants and GII.3, GII.17, and GI.1 strains) in
human jejunal enteroid monolayers (table S1).
We next evaluated whether the requirement
of bile for GII.3 HuNoV infection and replica-
tion was due to a bile effect on the HIE cells or
on the virus. Stool filtrate was pretreated with
5% bile or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
1 hour and then diluted in PBS (final concen-
tration of 0.025% in the bile-treated sample)
prior to inoculating HIE cultures not treated
with bile. HIEs also were either not treated or
treated with 5% bile for 48 hours prior to and
during infection. The pretreatment of cells with
bile was carried out for a longer duration as
compared to pretreatment of the virus with bile
because bile has multiple known effects on cell-
ular functions, including acting as a detergent,
increasing digestion and absorption of fat, and
regulating metabolic and inflammatory processes
by activating various signaling pathways (20).
An increase in genome equivalents was observed
only when HIE cells were treated with bile (Fig.
2D), indicating that the bile effect is on the cells
and not on the virus.
Further assessment of bile treatment revealed
that addition of bile to cultures during or after
virus adsorption, but not prior to adsorption, is
required for GII.3 replication (Fig. 2, E and F).
Testing of heat- or trypsin-treated bile for GII.3
infections in HIEs found no effect on replica-
tion (fig. S8), indicating that the active factor
is not proteinaceous. The successful cultivation
of GII.3 HuNoV required both novel HIE cultures
and supplementary bile, because the addition of
bile to transformed epithelial cell lines including
Huh7, Vero, HEK293FT, and undifferentiated
or differentiated Caco-2 BBe cells did not pro-
mote HuNoV replication (fig. S9). These results
indicate that HIEs and bile together mimic the
human replication niche of HuNoVs.
The sensitivity of the HIE culture system to
support HuNoV replication was evaluated by
determining the lower limit of virus required
for successful infection. For this, the dose re-
quired to produce infection in 50% of the in-
oculated cultures (ID50) for GII.4 and GII.3 HuNoVs
was calculated by the Reed-Muench method (21).
The ID50 values for GII.4/2012-1 and GII.3 HuNoVs
were ~1200 and ~2.0 × 104 genome equivalents
per well, respectively, assessed at 7 days post-
infection (dpi; geometric mean of two experi-
ments, representative experiments shown in fig.
S10, A and B). These results indicate that this
replication system is amenable to determining
the infectivity of low levels of virus, as has been
observed in emesis, contaminated food, and fe-
cal samples after recovery from illness (8, 22, 23).
This replication system also will allow evalu-
ation of whether a given virus, currently detected
in a variety of samples by molecular methods,
is infectious and poses a potential risk to
human health.
HuNoVs replicate in enterocytes in
cultures from different segments of the
small intestine
The site of replication of HuNoVs in immuno-
competent individuals is unknown, although
histologic alterations have been observed in small

Downloaded from 
 intestinal biopsies from volunteers infected with
Norwalk virus (24) and antigen has been de-
tected in duodenal, jejunal, and (to a lesser extent)
ileal enterocytes from gnotobiotic pigs infected
with a GII.4 HuNoV (25). We therefore evaluated
whether HuNoVs infect cells derived from dif-
ferent regions of the small intestine by inoculating
HIE cultures made from biopsies obtained from
different intestinal segments that retain segment-
specific properties (26). GII.4 and GII.3 HuNoVs
replicated in enteroids derived from duodenal,
jejunal, and ileal intestinal segments (Fig. 3).
Replication varied by strain and intestinal seg-
ment, with GII.4 variants showing increases by
factors of 11 to 1535 between 1 and 96 hpi in the
three segments and GII.3 virus showing increases
by factors of 3 to 51.
We investigated whether HuNoVs replicated
in cell types other than enterocytes. HuNoV
antigen was not detected in goblet cells (n =
200) or enteroendocrine cells (n = 50) assessed
in duodenal, jejunal, and ileal HIEs. Together,
the growth of HuNoVs in HIEs from all seg-
ments of the small intestine detected by RNA
replication and confocal staining indicates that
enterocytes (Fig. 1B) are the primary target for
infection and replication.
Secretor status of HIEs affects
strain-specific HuNoV replication
HuNoV infection is dependent on expression
of genetically determined histoblood group anti-
gens (HBGAs), and genetic resistance to some
HuNoV genotypes has been documented in chal-
lenge and outbreak studies (27). The presence of
a functional fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2, secretor-
positive genotype) enzyme, which transfers fu-
cose to HBGA precursors in gastrointestinal cells
in secretor-positive persons, correlates with sus-
ceptibility to infection with most GII.4 HuNoVs.
We generated HIEs from secretor-positive and
-negative persons to determine whether these
cultures recapitulate genotype-specific patterns
of HuNoV susceptibility (14). All secretor-positive
jejunal HIEs supported productive replication
of GII.4 variants (by factors of 44 to 1270) and
GII.3 HuNoVs (by factors of 10 to 173), as assessed
by increases in genome equivalents between
1 and 96 hpi (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GII.4 strains
did not infect HIEs generated from secretor-
negative individuals when assayed at 96 hpi or
6 dpi (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). However,
GII.3 virus infected two of three secretor-negative
HIEs, one of which was positive only after 6 days
in culture (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). These
results mirror epidemiologic data showing that
GII.3 HuNoVs, but not GII.4 HuNoVs, can infect
some individuals (27) and indicate that HuNoV
infection of HIEs is a biologically relevant sys-
tem that mimics infections in genetically de-
fined individuals. Further analysis of genetically
defined HIEs will aid in determining additional
host susceptibility factors to infection.
HuNoV cultivation in HIEs allows evaluation
of virus neutralization and inactivation
Functional antibodies in serum that block the
binding of HuNoV VLPs to HBGAs correlate
with protection against clinical gastroenteritis
in volunteer challenge and vaccination studies
(28–30). HBGA-blocking assays examine the
ability of human serum to block the interaction

Downloaded from 
 of HuNoV VLPs with H type 1 and H type 3
glycans and porcine gastric mucin (31, 32), and
the antibody titer that results in 50% blocking
(BT50) has been used as a surrogate for virus
neutralization (28). We used the HIE cultivation
system to directly measure virus neutralization.
Neutralizing antibody titers (the reciprocal anti-
body dilution present in serum able to reduce
virus yields by 50% relative to virus incubated
in media alone) were compared to HBGA-blocking
titers. Serum samples from two individuals,
one with a high BT50 and another with a low
BT50 against GII.4 VLPs, were tested (Table 1).
Both samples had low BT50s against GII.3 VLPs.
The neutralization titers were higher than the
BT50 values (Table 1 and fig. S11, A to D) and
virus-induced CPE was neutralized (fig. S11E);
these findings suggest that virus neutralization
is a more sensitive assay than the HBGA blocking
assay, and that neutralization epitopes other
than HBGA-blocking epitopes may exist on
norovirus particles.
The previous inability to cultivate HuNoVs
has hampered the development of strategies
to control and prevent HuNoV infection, and has
limited the ability to determine the effectiveness
of existing methods to inactivate virus to prevent
transmission in various settings, including in food
or on contaminated surfaces. The persistence of
HuNoVs in the environment, their high trans-
missibility, and the problem of chronic infection
of immunocompromised individuals document
a need for antiviral treatment and prophylaxis of
norovirus infections. To determine whether the
HIE infection model is suitable for testing virus
inactivation, we evaluated GII.3 and GII.4 HuNoV
inactivation by g irradiation and heat treatment.
No growth was observed after g irradiation of
either GII.4 or GII.3 HuNoVs (Fig. 5A). Com-
pared to incubation of GII.4 or GII.3 viruses at
room temperature for 60 min, heating at 60°C
for as little as 15 min inactivated both viruses; no
increase in yield was detected from 1 to 72 hpi
(Fig. 5, B and C). These studies indicate that
HuNoV infection of HIEs will allow evaluation
of new methods to inactivate HuNoVs and to
measure the effectiveness of disinfectants and
sanitizers, including characterization of the effi-
cacy of both traditional and novel control measures.
Implications of in vitro replication of
HuNoV for understanding its biology
HuNoV was visualized by Albert Kapikian in
1972 (17), but conditions to grow these viruses
in vitro have remained an unsolved mystery
for more than 40 years. Our results show that
HuNoV replication in HIEs is robust, based on
achieving several log10 increases in replication
of multiple variants of the epidemiologically
predominant GII.4 HuNoVs in HIE lines from
different small intestinal segments from mul-
tiple immunocompetent individuals; replica-
tion was documented by expression of structural
and nonstructural proteins, production and re-
lease of virus particles into culture supernatants,
and successful passaging of virus. The cultiva-
tion system described in this study has biologic
relevance, with replication of different strains
being consistent with known host restriction
based on HBGA expression. Variability in replica-
tion between different HIE cultures is observed;
specific cultures (secretor-positive) are highly sus-
ceptible to HuNoV strains, and other cultures
(secretor-negative) show variable resistance to
infection with specific HuNoV strains. These re-
sults mirror infectivity patterns seen in epide-
miological studies. Future work with additional
strains is needed to understand the basis for
this variability, particularly for infection of dif-
ferent secretor-negative lines with GII.3 viruses.
HuNoVs replicate in enterocytes from differ-
ent intestinal segments in HIEs. In addition,
factors present in the intestinal milieu, such as
bile, enhance or are required for replication to
occur. Bile obtained from various mammalian
sources (human, sow, piglet, porcine, and bo-
vine) mediates this effect, although there is
variability between bile sources and virus strains.
These results are consistent with previous data
from intestinal biopsies from HuNoV-infected
immunocompromised transplant patients and
studies in large animals (gnotobiotic pigs and
newborn calves) infected orally with HuNoV GII.4
or bovine norovirus GIII.1 strains, respectively,
where enterocytes in different segments of the
small intestine are clearly infected and express
viral antigen (25, 33, 34). Filtered stool was used
as inoculum in the present study, and bacterial
LPS was not required for infectivity. These re-
sults differ from reports of cultivation of a single
strain of HuNoV in B cells where unfiltered in-
ocula and commensal bacteria are required as
cofactors (9, 10), and of HuNoV replication in
other animal models following nonoral routes of
inoculation, including intraperitoneal injection
of immunodeficient mice (35) or intravenous
injection of chimpanzees (36); in those models,
virus was not detected in the intestinal epithelium
but was detected in cells in the lamina propria,
with some expressing DC-SIGN (chimpanzees) or
with a macrophage-like morphology (mice).
Replication of HuNoVs in enterocytes in HIEs
supports the observation that another site(s) of
primary replication besides B cells must exist, be-
cause HuNoVs can infect B cell–deficient patients
(37, 38). Our results are reminiscent of initial
conditions that required the addition of intestinal
contents from gnotobiotic piglets to successfully
culture a porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC), a mem-
ber of the Sapovirus genus of the Caliciviridae
family, using primary porcine kidney cells (39).
Species-specific bile enhanced primary replication
in that system, and subsequent studies showed
that bile acids and a continuous porcine kidney
cell line can support PEC replication (40). Addi-
tional studies are needed to determine the ac-
tive components of bile needed to support HuNoV
replication in HIEs. The active component(s) in
bile and mechanism(s) of action required for
HuNoV cultivation in HIEs remain to be fully char-
acterized, but initial characterization demonstrates
that it is not a protein. The establishment of this
cultivation system will facilitate applications in many
different realms of public health importance—
such as food safety and the development of new
diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics—and will
advance research on HuNoV evolution, immu-
nity, and pathogenesis.

The TRPM2 channel is a
hypothalamic heat sensor that limits
fever and can drive hypothermia

Body temperature homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the
nervous system.The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and
regulates internal temperature. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient
receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a temperature sensor in a subpopulation of
hypothalamic neurons.TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased
temperatures to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of
hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body temperature,
respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body
temperature on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels
in monitoring internal body temperature should promote further analysis of molecular
mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic
circuits involved with temperature homeostasis.
C
ore body temperature (Tcore) is normally
maintained very accurately in mammals
within a narrow range around 37°C and
serves as an important vital sign that is
routinely monitored in hospitalized pa-
tients. Pathological conditions such as infections
and systemic inflammation cause fever (1, 2), an
increase in the body’s temperature that is thought
to be mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)–
induced inhibition of warm-sensitive neurons
(WSNs) in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory
center (3). Adverse drug-induced fluctuations in
Tcore can have severe and even fatal consequences
(4). Conversely, clinically controlled modulation
of Tcore has beneficial effects and can prevent
tissue damage, promote trauma recovery (5, 6), or
help decrease obesity (7).
The preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus
serves as a thermostat, integrating temperature
information to orchestrate the autonomous and
behavioral adaptations needed to achieve thermal
homeostasis (3, 8). POA neurons receive and inte-
grate information from peripheral temperature
sensors located in the skin, spinal cord, and viscera.
Local POA warming and cooling experiments (9–13)
and genetic manipulations (14) have shown that
this region of the central nervous system also
detects local brain temperature changes, which
have a strong impact on Tcore. In fact, temper-
ature changes in the POA can exert a dominant
effect on Tcore and can override lower-priority
temperature inputs from peripheral temperature
sensors, such as those located in the skin (15, 16).
Warming of the POA induces heat dissipation
mechanisms such as cutaneous vasodilation, evap-
orative heat loss mechanisms, and behavioral ad-
aptations, whereas cooling of the POA triggers
heat conservation and thermogenesis.
POA neurons exhibiting pronounced temper-
ature sensitivity have been described in in vivo
models and in vitro preparations (17–19). WSNs
enhance their firing rate upon warming, a process
that is thought to relay temperature information
to peripheral organs to promote heat loss (3).
Conversely, a drop in deep brain temperature in-
hibits WSNs, a process that correlates with induc-
tion of thermogenesis and heat gain.
However, the genetic identity of WSNs and the
molecular basis of their temperature sensitivity
have remained elusive. Our work defined a pop-
ulation of WSNs that controls temperature ho-
meostasis and identified a transient receptor
potential (TRP) ionchannel that subserves thermo-
detection in hypothalamic neurons.
TRPM2 is a heat sensor in a subset of
POA neurons
To identify thermosensory molecules in the
thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus,
we established calcium imaging as a means to
monitor warming-induced responses of primary
POA neuronal cultures (fig. S1, A to F). We ap-
plied a stringent criterion to identify WSNs by
fura-2–mediated calcium imaging. We only counted
neurons as WSNs if their relative increase in signal
on receiving a thermal stimulus (up to 45°C) was
larger than the mean fura-2 signal plus 5 times
the standard deviation (5SD) of thermally un-
responsive human embryonic kidney–293 cells
subjected to the same temperature stimulus (fig.
S1, E and F). This procedure allowed us to account
and correct for the small unspecific temperature
effect on the fluorescent fura-2 signal (20) (see
fig. S1F and table S1 for details). We found that
16.3 ± 4.7% (mean ± SEM; n = 6 mice) of cultured
POA neurons responded to warming, a fraction
that is in the same range (10 to 16%) observed in
electrophysiological studies of rodent POA cultures
(21, 22) and slightly lower than WSN percentages
(20 to 40%) observed in POA slice preparations
(17, 23). Extracellular calcium appeared to be the
source of the temperature-triggered increase in
intracellular concentrations of free calcium, be-
cause chelation of external calcium abolished the
response, whereas depletion of intracellular cal-
cium stores did not have any effect on warm
sensitivity (fig. S1, D and G).
Several ion channels are thermosensitive, ex-
emplified by a steep temperature dependence
(Q10 coefficient) of their opening probabilities.
In particular, cationic TRP ion channels have
been identified as thermosensors in the peripheral
nervous system and function in the detection of
ambient temperature changes (24–27).
To identify candidate channels mediating the
observed warm sensitivity in neuronal POA cul-
tures, we tested various inhibitors and agonists
of TRPs and other thermosensitive ion channels
(fig. S1, H to L). The calcium response appeared
to be mediated by direct Ca2+ flux through a ther-
mosensitiveionchannelandnotanindirectreadout
of voltage-gated channels, because nifedipine and
tetrodotoxin, which are blockers of voltage-gated
calciumandsodiumchannels,respectively,hadonly

ature (fig.S1, H,J, K,andL). 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl
borate (2-APB), a potent inhibitor of several ion
channels and activator of TRPV-type channels
(28–30), abolished the temperature response of
POA neurons in a reversible manner (Fig. 1A).
