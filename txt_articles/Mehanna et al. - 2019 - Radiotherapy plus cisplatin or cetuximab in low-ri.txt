Summary
Background The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, a disease affecting younger 
patients, is rapidly increasing. Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, has been proposed for 
treatment de-escalation in this setting to reduce the toxicity of standard cisplatin treatment, but no randomised 
evidence exists for the efficacy of this strategy.
Methods We did an open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 32 head and neck treatment centres in Ireland, 
the Netherlands, and the UK, in patients aged 18 years or older with HPV-positive low-risk oropharyngeal cancer 
(non-smokers or lifetime smokers with a smoking history of <10 pack-years). Eligible patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to receive, in addition to radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions), either intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m² on days 1, 
22, and 43 of radiotherapy) or intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m² loading dose followed by seven weekly infusions of 
250 mg/m²). The primary outcome was overall severe (grade 3–5) toxicity events at 24 months from the end of 
treatment. The primary outcome was assessed by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. This trial is registered 
with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN33522080.
Findings Between Nov 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2016, 334 patients were recruited (166 in the cisplatin group and 168 in 
the cetuximab group). Overall (acute and late) severe (grade 3–5) toxicity did not differ significantly between 
treatment groups at 24 months (mean number of events per patient 4·8 [95% CI 4·2–5·4] with cisplatin vs 4·8 
[4·2–5·4] with cetuximab; p=0·98). At 24 months, overall all-grade toxicity did not differ significantly either (mean 
number of events per patient 29·2 [95% CI 27·3–31·0] with cisplatin vs 30·1 [28·3–31·9] with cetuximab; p=0·49). 
However, there was a significant difference between cisplatin and cetuximab in 2-year overall survival (97·5% vs 
89·4%, hazard ratio 5·0 [95% CI 1·7–14·7]; p=0·001) and 2-year recurrence (6·0% vs 16·1%, 3·4 [1·6–7·2]; 
p=0·0007).
Interpretation Compared with the standard cisplatin regimen, cetuximab showed no benefit in terms of reduced 
toxicity, but instead showed significant detriment in terms of tumour control. Cisplatin and radiotherapy should be 
used as the standard of care for HPV-positive low-risk patients who are able to tolerate cisplatin.

Introduction
The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
is increasing rapidly in high-income countries,1,2 reaching 
epidemic proportions in some estimates.3 This increase 
has been attributed to a rise in human papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection. HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma is considered to be a distinct disease 
entity from HPV-negative head and neck cancer. The 
disease affects younger adults and treatment can be 
successful.4 HPV status, tumour nodal stage, and 
smoking history define three groups with distinct survival 
outcomes: low risk (HPV-positive, <10 pack-years; 3-year 
overall survival 93%), intermediate risk (HPV-positive, 
>10 pack-years; 3-year overall survival 71%) and high risk 
(HPV-negative; 3-year overall survival 48%).4
Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab 
bioradiotherapy are both approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration for treatment of head and neck 
cancer, with cisplatin being standard of care for 
advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in 
most countries. However, concurrent cisplatin therapy 
is associated with substantial increases in acute, 
sometimes life-threatening, toxicity,5–7 compared with 
radiotherapy alone. The treat 
ment also increases long-
term sequelae,5,7,8 including xerostomia and dysphagia.

oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma might endure 
substantial, life-changing side-effects of treatment, that 
could affect their quality of life, for several decades.
There is global consensus about the need for 
treatment de-escalation (reduction of toxicity while 
preserving anti-tumour efficacy) for these patients.9 
One such strategy seeks to substitute cetuximab for 
cisplatin as the radiosensitiser. Radiotherapy can 
induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
expression in head and neck cancers, resulting in 
acquired resistance.10 Cetuximab, a targeted EGFR 
inhibitor, might help overcome this resistance and 
might also induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity. In a randomised trial,11 bioradiotherapy 
with cetuximab was shown to significantly improve 
overall survival com 
pared with radiotherapy alone 
(median 49·0 months vs 29·3 months; hazard ratio 
[HR] 0·74; p=0·03) in patients with head and neck 
cancer, and, in an updated analysis,12 in patients with 
HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
(HR 0·16 [95% CI 0·07–0·36]). Since toxicity rates 
(except for rash) were broadly similar between the two 
groups, cetuximab could potentially represent a less 
toxic alternative to cisplatin in this setting.
Conversely, an inverse association between HPV 
positivity and EGFR status has been reported.13 Therefore, 
EGFR inhibition might not be as effective as chemo- 
therapy in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma. Studies have reported conflicting results in this 
regard14,15 and, as yet, no randomised comparisons have 
been done in HPV-positive patients. The De-ESCALaTE 
trial aimed to compare the toxicity, survival, and time-
to-recurrence outcomes of cetuximab versus cisplatin 
in patients with low-risk, HPV-positive oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma receiving radiotherapy in the 
curative setting. As these treatments might have different 
effects on quality of life, especially swallowing, relevant 
patient-reported outcomes were also measured between 
the two groups.
Methods
Study design
This open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial was 
done at 32 head and neck treatment centres in Ireland 
(n=1), the Netherlands (n=1), and the UK (n=30). 
The first and last authors and the Trial Management 
Group designed the study, which was coordinated by 
Warwick Clinical Trials Unit. Sample collection and 
coordination was done by the University of Birmingham, 
UK, and p16 immunohistochemistry was done at 
Newcastle University, UK. The authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis, 
and for adherence to the study protocol. All authors 
contributed to the writing of the manuscript. The study 
protocol is available online.
All treating hospitals were approved as head and neck 
treatment centres by their country’s health authorities. All 
centres and oncologists completed the trial’s central 
radiotherapy quality assurance accreditation (see appendix 
for more information).
Patients
Eligible patients were recruited by their treating clinicians. 
Patients had to be aged at least 18 years with a histologically 
confirmed diagnosis of advanced oropharyngeal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (American Joint Committee on 
Cancer/International Union for Cancer Control [AJCC/
UICC] tumour, node, and metastasis [TNM] 7th Edition 
manual: T3N0–T4N0, and T1N1–T4N3) that was classified 
as low risk as per the Ang classification:4 that is, the tumour 
sample had to be positive on p16 immunohistochemistry, 
and the patient had to be a non-smoker or have a lifetime 
self-reported smoking history of less than 10 pack-years. 
Patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, and 
adequate renal, haematological, and hepatic function for 
cisplatin-based curative chemoradiotherapy.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour samples 
were histologically confirmed to be squamous cell 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Standard treatment for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive 
oropharyngeal cancer (cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy) 
results in considerable acute and long-term toxicity. Wide 
consensus exists about the need for de-escalation treatments 
with decreased toxicity and similar survival. Cetuximab, 
an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration, is thought to result in 
reduced toxicity and thus might represent an ideal form of 
de-escalation in this setting. Meta-analyses of existing small, 
mainly retrospective studies reported poorer outcomes with 
cetuximab than with cisplatin for head and neck cancers 
overall, but a possible benefit in HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal cancer.
Added value of this study
Results of our open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial 
show that, in patients with low-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal 
cancer, not only did cetuximab result in similar rates of severe and 
all-grade toxicity to cisplatin but it importantly resulted in poorer 
overall survival and higher rates of locoregional recurrence and 
distant metastases than did standard cisplatin therapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy should remain the 
standard of care for patients with low-risk HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal cancer. Our findings also suggest caution with 
de-escalation strategies and highlight the importance of phase 3 
trial data before changing clinical practice.

carcinoma and tested in two quality-assured, central 
laboratories for p16 by immunohistochemistry, by use of 
proprietary reagents (CINtec Histology kit; Roche mtm 
labsAG; Basel, Switzerland). p16 was scored positive if 
70% or more of malignant cells showed strong and diffuse 
nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.16 High-risk HPV DNA 
in-situ hybridisation was done with proprietary reagents 
(INFORM-HPV-III Family 16 Probe-B, Ventana Medical 
Systems Inc, Tuscon, USA). The probe cocktail detects 
HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 56, 58, and 66, 
and is visualised as a blue reaction product in malignant 
cells.17 Patients reported smoking history and alcohol 
consumption by self-completed questionnaires, and their 
comorbidities were graded by the recruiting clinician. 
Patients were excluded if they had T1–T2N0 disease or 
were classified as HPV-negative, high-risk, or HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma intermediate-
risk on the Ang classification. The study was approved 
by the Coventry and Warwickshire Research Ethics 
Committee. Patients were recruited by their treating 
clinicians and all patients provided written informed 
consent.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible patients underwent computer-generated central 
randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy 
or cetuximab bioradiotherapy. Trial-group assignments 
were balanced by use of a bespoke minimisation 
algorithm according to centre, tumour stage (TNM7: T1–
T2 vs T3–T4), nodal stage (N0–1 vs N2–3), radiotherapy 
site (unilateral; bilateral), and planned gastrostomy 
insertion before treatment.
Procedures
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy with either three doses 
of intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m² on days 1, 22, and 
43 of radiotherapy or intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m² 
loading dose 1 week before followed by seven weekly 
infusions of 250 mg/m² during radiotherapy. Patients 
were assessed for treatment response 12 weeks after 
radiotherapy completion by clinical examination and by 
CT, MRI, or PET-CT scan. Follow-up consisted of clinical 
examination, monthly in the first year and every 2 months 
in the second year, for at least 24 months after treatment 
completion.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was overall (acute and late) severe 
toxicity (grades 3–5). Treatment toxicity was assessed 
with the Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 4, for a period of 24 months from the 
end of treatment. Secondary outcomes were overall 
survival, time to recurrence, quality of life, swallowing, 
and acute and late severe toxicities reported separately; 
suspected recurrences were assessed by imaging and 
biopsy. Patients completed the paper-based European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality-of-Life Questionnaire–Core 30 general (EORTC 
QLQ-C30, version 3) questionnaire and the EORTC 
QLQ-H&N35 questionnaire specific to head and neck 
cancers,18 and the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory19 
at baseline before treatment, at radiotherapy completion, 
and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment.
Statistical analysis
A target sample size of 304 patients (152 in each group) 
was calculated to enable detection of reductions greater 
than 25% in the overall number of severe (grade 3–5) 
acute and late toxicities with a two-sided test at the 
5% level of significance, allowing for 10% dropout 
with greater than 90% power, assuming an average 
of 2·5 overall severe events per patient.
Recruitment of 304 patients was also estimated to allow 
detection of a 50% reduction in late severe toxicities with 
at least 90% power and a 25% or greater reduction in 
acute severe toxicities with 85% power. An additional 
30 patients were recruited to allow for withdrawals and 
any higher risk (T4,N3) patients recruited. The interim 
analysis was done after the first 200 patients were 
recruited. More details are provided in the appendix.
An intention-to-treat analysis was done for all 
outcomes, and a per-protocol analysis was done for 
primary out 
comes and secondary outcomes of toxicity 
and survival. All patients allocated to treatment groups 
were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, even if 
they did not receive the treatment. Patients who 
withdrew or who had major protocol violations as 
assessed by the independent trial monitoring team were 
excluded from the per-protocol analyses. All analyses 
were unblinded.
Mean numbers per patient of toxicity events (short-
term [acute] toxicity and adverse long-term [late] effects, 
based on the TAME method of reporting toxicities6) were 
compared by t tests. Proportions of patients affected by 
one or more toxicity event were compared by Pearson’s 
χ² test. A severe toxic event was defined as a toxicity 
assessed as grade 3–5 by CTCAE, version 4. The type of 
event was characterised by the CTCAE, version 4, System 
Organ Class and Term. Toxicities were classified as acute 
if they first appeared during or up to 3 months after 
treatment, and were classified as late if they persisted, or 
first appeared, more than 3 months up to 24 months 
after treatment. Multiple occurrences of events of a 
single toxicity type within an analysis time period are 
counted as a single event. Events that were present both 
within 90 days after treatment and remained after that 
period were counted as acute events and also as late 
events but were not counted twice when analysing the 
overall number of acute and late events. Toxicities 
reported as part of a serious adverse event notification 
but that were not reported as a toxicity event were added 
to the counts of toxicity events.

Overall survival and time to recurrence were measured 
from the date of randomisation and compared by the 
log-rank test with all-cause mortality in the intention-to-
treat population.
Deaths were classified as being due to head and neck 
cancer or to other causes. Recurrences could be loco-
regional or distant, or both. Patients who died from head 
and neck cancer causes as the first event were classed as 
recurrences. New primaries and persistent nodal disease 
(detected within 90 days from randomisation) were not 
included in the analysis of time to recurrence. Patients on 
follow-up and patients lost to follow-up were censored at 
the last date at which they were known to be alive. 95% CIs 
were generated with a univariate Cox proportional hazards 
model. The proportional assumption was tested by 
plotting the observed Kaplan-Meier values against the Cox 
predicted values. The effect of randomised treatment on 
outcome was also assessed after adjusting for known 
prognostic factors with a multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards model. Two post-hoc subgroup sensitivity 
analyses examined the association with overall survival of 
the very low-risk group with TNM-8 stage I and II disease, 
and those who were doubly positive for p16 and HPV-
DNA in-situ hybridisation.
Standard scoring methods were applied to quality-of-life 
questionnaires.18 Missing quality-of-life scores were not 
imputed. All scores were normalised, ranging from 0 to 
100, and transformed to unweighted summated scales 
in which higher scores indicated better health. Global 
quality of life was assessed with the EORTC QLQ C30 
global measure. Separate comparisons were made at 
each timepoint. Unadjusted p values were used. On the 
EORTC questionnaires and the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia 
Inventory, a 10-point difference in scores was considered 
to be clinically relevant.19,20 Analyses were done with Stata, 
version 15.1.
This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN33522080.

Results
Between Nov 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2016, 334 patients were 
recruited (166 in the cisplatin group and 168 in the 
cetuximab group). There were seven withdrawals from the 
treatment protocol before treatment started and six after 
starting treatment (figure 1; appendix). All patients allocated 
to treatment groups were included in the intention-to-treat 
analyses, and 159 patients in the cisplatin group and 162 in 
the cetuximab group were included in the per-protocol 
analyses. There was no crossover between groups.
We observed no notable imbalances in baseline 
characteristics (age, tumour site, tumour stage, smoking 
history, performance status, and comorbidities) between 
the two groups (table 1; appendix). The mean age was 
57 years. 80% of patients were men, 65% had T1–T2 
disease (TNM 7), 76% had N2–N3 disease (TNM 7), and 
46% were either current or past smokers, with a median 
lifetime smoking history of 8 pack-years (table 1). Of the 
324 (97%) patients tested for HPV-DNA on in-situ 
hybridisation, 304 (94%) were positive, 20 were negative, 
and ten were unknown. At the 3-month post-treatment 
assessment, 165 (51%) patients were assessed with 
PET-CT and 162 (49%) by MRI, with equal distribution 
among the groups.
The median duration from randomisation to start of 
radiotherapy was 14 days (IQR 11–17) and did not differ 
between groups. Only eight (5%) patients in the cisplatin 
group and four (3%) in the cetuximab group received a 
dose of less than 70 Gy (p=0·256; appendix), all patients 
received a dose of 65 Gy or more, and 332 (99%) received 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Radiotherapy inter-
ruptions or modifications occurred in 12 (9%) patients 
receiving cisplatin and 14 (7%) receiving cetuximab.
In the cisplatin group, 62 (38%) patients received all 
three cycles of cisplatin, 83 (51%) received two cycles, and

16 (10%) received one cycle. Of those who received one or 
two cycles, nine received one or two doses of carboplatin 
instead (appendix). One patient did not receive any 
chemotherapy because of sepsis. The median total 
cisplatin dose received was 200 mg/m² (IQR 200–300) 
and 26 (16%) received less than 200 mg/m² in total. The 
main reasons for discontinuation or reduction in cisplatin 
dose were myelosuppression, oral or gastrointestinal 
toxicity, or nausea and vomiting.
In the cetuximab group, 130 (79%) patients received all 
eight cycles of cetuximab; 23 (14%) received seven cycles, 
mainly omitting the final dose (appendix). The median 
total cetuximab dose received was 2150 mg/m² 
(IQR 2133–2150). The main reasons for discontinuation 
were skin rash, patient decision, and oral or gastro- 
intestinal toxicity.
Patients had a median follow up of 25·9 months (95% CI 
25·5–26·0). The primary outcome of reported overall 
severe (grades 3–5) toxicity did not differ significantly 
between treatment groups; the mean number of events 
per patient was 4·8 (95% CI 4·2–5·4) for cisplatin and 4·8 
(4·2–5·4) for cetuximab (p=0·98). Overall toxicity of all 
grades did not differ significantly either; the mean number 
of events per patient was 29·2 (95% CI 27·3–31·0) in the 
cisplatin group versus 30·1 (28·3–31·9) in the cetuximab 
group (p=0·49; table 2; appendix).
In the acute period, severe short-term toxicities did not 
differ significantly between groups; the mean number of 
events per patient was 4·4 (95% CI 3·9–4·97) for the 
cisplatin group versus 4·4 (3·8–4·9) for the cetuximab 
group (p=0·84). Rates of all-grade toxicity did not differ 
significantly either; the mean number of events per 
patient was 20·0 (95% CI 18·8–21·1) in the cisplatin 
group versus 20·4 (19·2–21·5) in the cetuximab group 
(p=0·64; table 2).
Severe late toxicity events (adverse long-term [late] 
events) did not differ significantly between the cisplatin 
and cetuximab groups (mean 0·4 vs 0·5 events 
per patient; p=0·53), and neither did all-grade late toxicity 
events (mean 9·4 vs 9·9 events per patient; p=0·49; 
table 2; appendix). The proportions of patients affected 
by either overall severe (grade 3–5) or all grade toxicities 
also did not differ significantly between the two groups 
(appendix).
Similar results were seen for all these outcomes in the 
per-protocol population (appendix). Furthermore, a post-
hoc subgroup analysis of toxicity outcomes in patients 
who received the complete treatment regimens (three 
doses of cisplatin or eight doses of cetuximab) showed 
similar outcomes to the intention-to-treat analysis, with 
no significant differences between the two groups in 
any of the primary or secondary toxicity outcomes 
(appendix).
The range of toxicities differed between the two 
treatment groups (table 3). For cisplatin, the most 
common acute severe toxicities were gastrointestinal 
(mean 2·12 events per patient) and the most common 
late toxicities were gastrointestinal (mean 0·2 events per 
patient) and labyrinthine (otological symptoms including 
hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo; mean 0·1 events per 
patient). Cisplatin also caused more haematological, 
metabolic, and renal toxicity than did cetuximab. For

cetuximab, the most common severe toxicities were also 
gastrointestinal (mean 1·9 acute and 0·2 late events per 
patient). Cetuximab also caused more skin toxicity and 
infusion reactions in the acute phase than did cisplatin 
(table 3).
There were significantly more serious adverse events 
with cisplatin than with cetuximab. 162 adverse events 
(mean rate of one event per patient) occurred in patients 
receiving cisplatin and 95 events (mean rate of 0·6 events 
per patient) occurred in patients receiving cetuximab 
(p<0·0001; appendix). The majority of serious adverse 
events (in 252 [98%] patients) resulted in admission to 
hospital. Serious adverse events in the cisplatin group 
were more likely (98 [61%] patients) to be assessed as 
related or possibly related to treatment than in the 
cetuximab group (18 [19%]; appendix). The most common 
serious adverse events for cisplatin were vomiting (in 
48 [30%] patients) and nausea (in 46 [28%]), and those for 
cetuximab were vomiting (22 [13%]) and oral mucositis 
(21 [13%]; appendix). 114 (70%) serious adverse events 
with cisplatin resolved without sequelae compared with 
59 (62%) with cetuximab.
A significant difference in 2-year overall survival was 
observed between cisplatin and cetuximab (97·5% vs 
89·4%, HR 5·0 [95% CI 1·7–14·7], log-rank p=0·0012; 
figure 2A) and in the 2-year recurrence rate (6·0% vs 
16·1%, 3·4 [1·6–7·2]; log-rank p=0·0007; figure 2B), in 
favour of cisplatin. After adjusting for known prognostic 
factors, the effect of treatment on overall survival 
(HR 5·9 [95% CI 2·0–17·8]; p=0·0015) and recurrence 
(3·9 [1·8–8·2]; p=0·0004) remained significant. Giving 
cetuximab instead of cisplatin was estimated to lead to 
one extra death at 2 years for every 12 patients treated 
(number needed to harm 12·3 [95% CI 7·0–50·8]). 
Similar results were seen for all above outcomes in the 
per-protocol population (appendix).
Overall, six patients died in the cisplatin group versus 
20 in the cetuximab group. Cancer-related deaths 
occurred in four patients in the cisplatin group and 
in 15 in the cetuximab group. Four (2·5%) patients 
had persistent disease after cisplatin therapy, compared 
with five (3%) after cetuximab therapy. Significantly 
fewer recurrences were observed with cisplatin than with 
cetuximab (ten [6%] vs 29 [18%]; log-rank p=0·0007; 
appendix). Significantly fewer locoregional recurrences 
(3% vs 12%, log-rank p=0·0026) and fewer distant 
metastases (3% vs 9%, log-rank p=0·0092) were observed 
with cisplatin than with cetuximab. Five (3%) patients in 
each group developed second primaries. 11 (7%) patients 
in the cisplatin group had neck dissection for possible 
persistent disease at the 3-month post-treatment assess-
ment point, and none for recurrent disease after this 
timepoint. Ten (6%) patients in the cetuximab group 
had neck dissection for possible persistent disease at the 
3-month post-treatment point, and two for recurrent 
disease after this timepoint.
We did two post-hoc subgroup sensitivity analyses. In 
the 276 patients with TNM8 stage I or II disease, a 
significant difference in 2-year overall survival was 
observed: 98·4% (95% CI 93·9–99·6) for the cisplatin 
group (n=133) and 93·2% (87·4–96·4) for the cetuximab 
group (n=143; HR 4·3 [95% CI 0·9–19·8], log rank 
p=0·0431; appendix). In particular, the 58 patients with 
TNM8 stage III (T4 or N3) disease showed a larger 2-year 
overall survival detriment with cetuximab (67·1% [95% CI 
42·5–83·1]) than with cisplatin (93·3% [75·9–98·3], 
HR 4·8 [95% CI 1·0–23·3], log rank p=0·0304; appendix). 
In the 304 (94%) patients who tested doubly positive for 
p16 and HPV-DNA, there was still a significant difference 
in 2-year overall survival between cisplatin (97·2% 
[95% CI 92·8–99]) and cetuximab (89·7% [83·2–93·8]; 
HR 4·4 [95% CI 1·5–13·1]; log rank p=0·0035; appendix). 
The mean global quality-of-life score on EORTC 
QLQ-C30 did not differ significantly between treatment 
groups at any of the timepoints (mean difference at 
24 months of 1·51 points in favour of cisplatin, p=0·9976; 
figure 2C). A significant difference in social functioning 
was observed in favour of cetuximab at the end of 
treatment (mean difference of 8·67 points, p=0·0374), 
but this difference disappeared 6 months later. At 
12 months and 24 months, a significant difference in 
role functioning was observed in favour of cisplatin 
(difference in mean scores of 8·32 points, p=0·0173; 
appendix). None of the differences reached the minimal 
clinically important difference of 10 points.
In terms of swallowing, no significant differences were 
observed between the treatment groups as assessed by 
the global M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory score 
(mean difference at 24 months of 6·90 points in favour 
of cisplatin, p=0·1279; appendix). The only significant 
differences between the groups in the domains occurred 
at 12 months after treatment, and all were in favour 
of cisplatin (mean difference in emotional domain of

Discussion
HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is 
projected to become the most common form of head and 
neck cancer in many developed countries.21,22 Results 
of our study show that, in the setting of low-risk 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the use of 
cetuximab bioradiotherapy instead of cisplatin-based 
chemoradiotherapy resulted in no overall benefit in 
terms of toxicity but showed significant detriment in 
tumour control. Our trial also highlights that the good 
survival outcomes of HPV-positive low-risk oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma are in part a function of the 
type of treatment received, and not merely a reflection 
of favourable intrinsic tumour biology. Therefore, 
cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy should continue to 
be considered the standard of care in this setting.
Contrary to expectations from the findings of the initial 
cetuximab registration trial,11 the rates of early, late, and 
overall serious toxicity resulting from cetuximab were 
not lower than those of cisplatin, although the toxicity 
profile was different. Global quality of life also appeared 
to be similar. Less than half of patients received the full 
dose of cisplatin because of toxicity. However, there was 
still a significant difference in survival compared with 
the cetuximab group in which most patients received 
the full regimen. Although cetuximab does result in 
fewer serious adverse events, this alone is not sufficient 
justification for its use in this setting. The findings of our 
study confirm those of other studies and meta-analyses 
comparing chemotherapy to bioradiotherapy with EGFR 
inhibitors in mixed head and neck cancer populations.23,24 
Until now, to our knowledge, no randomised studies had 
been done in HPV-positive disease.
As HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell car-
cinoma is a relatively new disease entity, there have been 
changes in risk classification schemes, its TNM staging 
system, and the use of p16 immunohistochemistry as the 
sole determinant of HPV positivity since the inception of 
this trial and during its conduct. We defined low-risk

Data are mean number of events per patient or number of patients with at least one severe toxicity (%). An event was defined as the incidence of a toxicity assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 4. Severe toxicity classified as grade 3, 4, or 5 on CTCAE, version 4. A toxicity that reached grade 3–5 in the acute phase and continued as grade 3–5 into the late phase was counted as 
both acute and late toxicities, but only counted once in the overall toxicity category. If a patient had two or more severe toxicities, they were still counted once in the total count.

patients according to the Ang classification,4 which is the 
most widely cited and used system. Since then, many 
other prognostic systems have been developed for this 
indication, each with different component factors. The 
new AJCC/UICC TNM 8th edition has included a new 
classification for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma. In this new classification, HPV-positive 
T4 and N3 cases, constituting stage III HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, have been 
shown to have higher rates of distant metastases than 
stage I or II tumours.25 Additionally, the use of p16 alone 
as a surrogate marker of HPV causation has been criticised, 
because in some studies the subsets comprising 
p16-positive, HPV-DNA-negative disease appear to have 
poorer outcomes, similar to patients with p16-negative 
and HPV-DNA-negative disease.26 In other studies, this 
subset of patients showed similar survival to patients 
with p16-positive, HPV-positive disease.27 To understand 
whether these factors affected our con 
clusions, we did 
post-hoc sensitivity analyses and found no difference in 
the results. Patients with T4 or N3 disease appeared to 
have even higher detriments in overall survival if they 
were treated with cetuximab than if they were treated 
with cisplatin. The numbers were small, however, leading 
to wide confidence intervals.
Our study was originally designed to test for differences 
in toxicity as a means of assessing whether cetuximab 
effectively reduces treatment-related toxicity for patients 
with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell car- 
cinoma. We anticipated equivalent disease control and 
survival endpoints between study groups and did not 
formally power the study to show non-inferiority. Despite 
this limitation, the trial shows significant differences 
in both recurrence and survival endpoints in favour 
of cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. This outcome 
appears to be due to a relatively larger effect of cisplatin, 
compared with cetuximab, on locoregional control and 
distant metastases. We used p16 and HPV DNA in-situ 
hybridisation to assess HPV status, as this method is 
widely accepted16 and is recommended by the US National 
Comprehensive Care guidelines as one of the appropriate 
options for this purpose.28 This could be viewed as a 
limitation, because HPVE6/E7 RNA evaluation by PCR is 
considered the gold standard for testing HPV status. 
However, this method is not easily feasible in the clinical 
setting; moreover, in our study, patients who were

p16-positive and HPV-positive showed similar survival 
rates to those who were p16-positive and HPV-negative.
Studies testing different de-escalation approaches 
for low-risk and intermediate-risk HPV-positive oro- 
pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are underway. Our 
data suggest that cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy 
delivers substantially improved outcomes compared with 
bioradiotherapy with cetuximab, even in patients with 
good outcomes. Assuming that cetuximab does not 
reduce the efficacy of radiotherapy to control disease, 
these findings support the beneficial effects of adding 
cisplatin to radiotherapy in this group of patients. The 
reduced rate of distant metastasis also suggests that 
cisplatin might contribute to a systemic effect, even in 
low-risk patients. In light of our findings, we would 
advise caution with de-escalation strategies, especially 
those that remove systemic chemotherapy altogether, 
and strongly advocate that the results of phase 3 trials 
should be awaited before making any changes to routine 
clinical management.
This study is, to our knowledge, one of the first to 
compare cetuximab with cisplatin in combination with 
radiotherapy in the context of treatment de-escalation in 
HPV-positive disease. Not only did this trial show no 
reduction in toxicity with cetuximab but it also confirmed a 
statistically and clinically significant detriment in tumour 
control and survival endpoints with this therapy. These 
results have immediate implications for clinical practice 
and highlight the importance of doing comparative phase 3 
trials in new indications, even for treatments that are 
already approved or have shown benefit in phase 2 trials.

Data sharing
De-identified participant data and the data dictionary will be available 
along with the study protocol and statistical analysis plan from 
Jan 1, 2020, onwards. Please email M.L.Dalby@warwick.ac.uk. The final 
dataset will include basic demographics, tumour characteristics, 
treatment detail, survival, and quality of life and toxicity outcomes. Data 
will not include name, address, hospital number or date of birth, or any 
other identifying data. The data will be accompanied by metadata which 
gives a complete explanation of the data fields, the definition, the 
standards used such as TNM staging, and the units used. The data will 
be shared through custodianship by the principal investigator. A data 
access committee will be convened and will comprise the principal 
investigator and two other co-investigators. They will be responsible for 
assessing requests for data sharing about granting access. The data 
management committee will be responsible to the steering committee 
and requests for appeals will be made directly to the trial steering 
committee. The process for requesting data sharing will be as follows: 
the requestor will complete a two-page proforma requiring name and 
contact details of the requestor, the objectives of the study, the 
methodology, the expected outcome, the statistical analysis plan, whether 
the project will be a collaboration with the DeESCALaTE study 
organisers or will only acknowledge the study and its organisers, ethical 
committee approval, and funding and peer review details. The data 
sharing committee will meet at least twice a year to consider these 
requests. Urgent requests may be considered in between these 
meetings. In the event of a declined application, the requestors may 
lodge an appeal with the trial steering committee chairperson. The 
dataset will be stored with the principal investigator at the Institute of 
Head and Neck Studies and Education in the long term. The data will be 
available for public release from the time of publication of the main 
results of the study. Prior to that, access of the data may be considered in 
specific circumstances. After 5 years of publication of the result, the data 
may then be lodged with a data archiving facility. Requestors who are 
granted access to the data will be required to complete a data sharing 
agreement, which is based on the principles, content, and format 
published by the the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI).
