OBJECTIVES: Inadequate sleep during infancy is associated with adverse outcomes for infants 
and families. We sought to improve sleep behaviors and duration through a responsive 
parenting (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention.
METHODS: The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) 
study is a randomized trial comparing a RP intervention with a safety control. Primiparous 
mother-newborn dyads were randomized after childbirth, and research nurses delivered 
intervention content at home visits at infant ages 3, 16, 28, and 40 weeks and at a research 
center visit at 1 year. The RP sleep component included developmentally appropriate 
messages about bedtime routines, sleep location and behaviors, and responses to wakings. 
Portions of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered 2, 8, and 52 weeks after 
birth with expanded sleep-related data collection at 16 and 40 weeks.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-nine dyads completed the first home visit; 90.7% 
completed the 1-year visit. Compared with controls, RP group infants were less likely to 
have prolonged bedtime routines >45 minutes and more likely to have earlier bedtimes at 
16 and 40 weeks. They were less likely to be fed immediately before bed and more likely to 
self-soothe to sleep. At 8, 16, and 40 weeks, RP group nocturnal sleep duration was longer 
by 35, 25, and 22 minutes, respectively (P < .05 for all). Sleep duration at 1 year was similar 
between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The INSIGHT RP intervention positively influenced developmentally appropriate 
bedtime routines, sleep-related behaviors, and sleep duration for infants.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Short sleep 
duration during infancy has been associated with 
numerous adverse outcomes for infants and their 
families. Inadequate sleep affects infant cognitive, 
psychomotor, physical, and socioemotional 
development, as well as parental emotional health 
and parenting practices.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A responsive parenting 
intervention delivered at home nurse visits positively 
infl
 uenced developmentally appropriate bedtime 
routines, sleep-related behaviors, and nighttime 
sleep duration in the fi
 rst year after birth.

PAUL et al 
Many young children get less 
sleep than they require, 
1 and 
today’s children sleep less than 
those in previous generations.2 
Inadequate sleep is problematic 
because sleep is associated with 
cognitive, psychomotor, physical, 
and socioemotional development, 
including emotional regulation, 
mood, and behavior in infancy 
and childhood.3–6 Furthermore, 
infant sleep-related behaviors are 
associated with maternal sensitivity, 
relationship quality, parental 
emotional health, and parenting 
practices.7, 
8 Inadequate sleep has 
also emerged as an important 
risk factor for obesity9, 
10 with 
links between sleep and weight 
beginning in infancy.11–16 Short 
sleep duration during infancy is also 
associated with inadequate sleep 
later in childhood, 
17 and therefore 
improving sleep-related behaviors 
and extending infant sleep duration 
has the potential to influence the 
long-term well-being of children and 
families.
During the first year, infants spend 
much of their time asleep but 
experience substantial changes in 
sleep/wake cycles. For the first 
few weeks, infants wake every 
few hours, typically to feed, and 
normal circadian rhythms are 
developed.18–23 After this period, 
how parents put their infant to 
bed (eg, bedtime routines, falling 
asleep independently) and respond 
to night wakings represent 
sources of variability in infants’ 
developing sleep patterns24, 
25 
and also affects the frequency and 
timing of feedings. Previously, 
we demonstrated that early in 
infancy, nocturnal sleep duration 
can be extended by teaching 
parents caregiving procedures 
to address non–hunger-related 
fussiness.26, 
27 Combined with 
education on hunger and satiety 
cues, this reduced nighttime feeds 
and awakenings. Another recent 
report describing an Internet-based 
intervention designed to improve 
infant and toddler sleep revealed 
that participants took less time to 
fall asleep, had less time awake 
overnight, and had longer sleep 
durations between awakenings.28 
Maternal sleep and mood improved, 
and positive benefits on infants’ 
sleep were seen 1 year later.29
Given evidence of sleep’s 
malleability and its links to weight 
outcomes, we included sleep-related 
components within a responsive 
parenting (RP) intervention 
designed for the primary prevention 
of obesity. On the basis of previous 
research, 
26–28 the sleep components 
focused on consolidating sleep and 
extending night sleep duration by 
providing guidance on sleep-related 
parenting behaviors, particularly 
establishing consistent bedtime 
routines, encouraging self-soothing 
and early bedtimes, and strategies 
to address night waking.30 In this 
ongoing randomized, controlled 
trial, the RP intervention is 
compared with a home safety 
control intervention that includes a 
safe sleep component. We assessed 
intervention effects on infant sleep 
in the first year with the hypothesis 
that sleep duration would be longer 
and positive sleep-related behaviors 
would be more prevalent compared 
with controls.
METHODS
Participants and Design
Mothers and their newborns were 
recruited after delivery from 
1 maternity ward (Penn State 
Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 
Hershey, PA) into the Intervention 
Nurses Start Infants Growing on 
Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) 
study from January 2013 to 
March 2014 (see Supplemental 
Information). The study design 
and inclusion/exclusion criteria 
have been published previously.30 
Major eligibility criteria included 
term singletons weighing ≥2500 g 
delivered to English-speaking, 
primiparous mothers ≥20 years 
old. Using a computer-generated 
algorithm, 291 dyads were 
randomized 2 weeks after delivery 
to the RP or control groups, 
stratified on birth weight for 
gestational age (<50th percentile 
or ≥50th percentile) and intended 
feeding mode (breastfeeding 
or formula). A baseline survey 
was administered to mothers 
electronically. Two hundred and 
seventy-nine mother-infant dyads 
completed the first home visit and 
are considered the study cohort for 
outcomes as specified before study 
initiation in the protocol.
As described previously, 
research nurses were trained in 
administering both the RP and 
control interventions30 at home 
visits conducted at infant age 3–4, 
16, 28, and 40 weeks, and a research 
center visit occurred at age 1 year. 
This study was approved by the 
Penn State College of Medicine’s 
Human Subjects Protection Office 
and registered at http:// 
www. 
clinicaltrials. 
gov without sleep noted 
as an a priori outcome.
RP Intervention Sleep-Related 
Components
INSIGHT’s RP intervention contained 
messages addressing infant 
behavioral states: Drowsy, Sleeping, 
Fussy, and Alert.30 Lessons include 
instructing parents to (1) recognize 
infant hunger and satiety cues; (2) 
use alternatives to feeding to soothe 
a fussy, but nonhungry, infant; (3) 
provide appropriate portions of 
healthy foods and allow children to 
determine the amount consumed; 
(4) improve acceptance of 
developmentally appropriate foods 
such as vegetables through repeated 
exposure and positive role modeling, 
while discouraging controlling 
feeding practices; and (5) actively 
engage infants in playtime to reduce 
sedentary behaviors.

Developmentally appropriate 
sleep guidance was delivered at 
visits within 3 categories: Bedtime 
Routine, Sleep Location and 
Behaviors, and Night Waking (Table 
1). This guidance was consistent 
with recommendations for age-
appropriate sleep durations, 
31 
helped parents recognize whether 
fussiness was due to fatigue versus 
hunger, provided strategies to 
transition infants from a fussy 
or drowsy state to sleep without 
feeding, and included detailed 
information on bedtimes and 
routines before bed, particularly 
the importance of consistent, 
short bedtime routines that do not 
finish with feeding to sleep, early 
bedtimes, and the importance of 
self-soothing to sleep and after night 
wakings. Before the 3-week visit, 
participants received materials 
by mail; for RP parents, materials 
included a video32 describing 
alternative soothing strategies and 
instructions to view it, practice 
soothing strategies before the 
home visit, and use these strategies, 
particularly at night. At the 16- and 
40-week visits, nurses used the Brief 
Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)33 
to provide each mother with a 
personalized infant sleep profile, 
28 
including information regarding 
how much her infant slept relative 
to recommendations and customized 
sleep-related feedback.
Control Group Sleep-Related 
Components
Briefly, INSIGHT’s home safety 
control intervention contained crib 
safety and prevention of sudden 
infant death syndrome components 
in a 2-week mailing and at the 
3–4-week home visit.30 At the 3–4- 
and 16-week visits, the infant’s 
sleep surface was examined by the 
nurse to tailor safety guidance. At 
the 16- and 28-week visits, sleep 
safety recommendations addressed 
developmental changes, such as 
rolling over and pulling to stand. At 
40 weeks, information on prevention 
of carbon monoxide poisoning was 
provided.
Measures
Data were collected and managed 
using REDCap.35 Paper surveys 
were mailed to those lacking 
Internet connectivity (n = 20). A 
detailed listing of measures has been 
published.30
Background Characteristics
Demographic information collected at 
enrollment included parent and child 
race/ethnicity, annual income, and 
marital status. Data extracted from 
medical charts included maternal 
age, prepregnancy weight, gestational 
weight gain, infant gestational age, 
and birth anthropometrics.
Sleep
The validated BISQ was used to 
assess sleep.33 This survey assesses 
infant sleep location, before-bedtime 
activities, and sleep patterns. Sleep 
duration is divided into nighttime 
(7 PM–7 AM) and daytime (7 AM–7 PM) 
and is reported in hours and 
minutes. Selected questions

capturing sleep duration (day and 
night), location, and night feedings 
were administered at infant age 
2 (baseline), 8, and 52 weeks. An 
expanded version was completed at 
16 and 40 weeks that also included 
questions on bedtime routine 
components and duration, infant 
sleep behaviors and environment, 
and parenting responses to night 
wakings. Further questions assessed 
specific behaviors related to the 
RP intervention’s sleep guidance. 
A Bedtime Routines Questionnaire36 
was completed at age 52 weeks, 
with questions about consistency of 
parenting behaviors before bedtime 
and consistency of the bedtime 
environment.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Descriptive statistics were generated 
for sleep duration, bedtime routine 
components, sleep location and 
behaviors, and night wakings. Each 
outcome variable was assessed for 
normality. Statistical significance 
was defined as P ≤ .05. Bedtime 
routine data were analyzed by χ2 
and Mantel-Haenszel tests. Effects of 
study group on sleep duration were 
analyzed by t tests; effects of sleep 
behaviors were analyzed as nested 
effects, along with study group, in 
analyses of variance, with Tukey’s 
honest significant difference post 
hoc comparisons used to compare 
sleep behavior effects on sleep 
duration, wakings, and feedings.
RESULTS
Among 279 participants, there were 
no differences between RP and 
control groups on demographic or 
baseline characteristics including 
feeding mode (Table 2). Mothers 
were predominantly white, non-
Hispanic, married, employed, well-
educated, and privately insured 
at enrollment. At 1 year, 90.7% 
remained in the study with no 
significant difference in attrition by 
study group.
Bedtime Routine and Sleep 
Behaviors
At baseline 2 weeks after delivery, 
there were no significant group 
differences in bedtime routines, 
sleep location, or sleep behaviors. 
By the next assessment (8 weeks), 
differences began to emerge. 
Reflecting RP intervention content, 
more RP infants were usually or 
always allowed to self-soothe to 
sleep (put to bed for the night while 
still awake: 35% vs 16%, P < .001), 
as opposed to sometimes, rarely, or 
never.
The more detailed bedtime routine 
and sleep behavior data collection at 
ages 16 and 40 weeks revealed many 
differences between groups (Table 3). 
As instructed by the nurses, RP 
infants were more likely to have 
shorter bedtime routines beginning 
≤45 minutes before bed at 16 (51% 
vs 37%; P = .03) and 40 weeks (57% 
vs 44%; P = .04). Although there were 
many similar components of bedtime 
routines between groups including 
calm activities, RP infants were more 
likely to be read to at 16 (47% vs 
28%; P = .002) and 40 weeks (61% 
vs 49%; P = .05). Although nearly 
all infants were fed as part of their 
bedtime routine at both 16 and 40 
weeks, RP infants were less likely

to be fed as the last activity of their 
bedtime routine at 16 (20% vs 40%; 
P < .001) and 40 weeks (22% vs 33%; 
P = .05).
Again reflecting intervention 
content, RP infants had earlier 
bedtimes (Fig 1). At 16 weeks, 46% 
of RP infants went to bed by 8 PM 
versus 24% of controls (P < .001); 
the disparity was 66% vs 47% at 40 
weeks (P = .002). RP infants were 
less likely to fall asleep being held 
at either time point (16 weeks: 36% 
vs 48%; P = .06; 40 weeks: 21% vs 
38%; P = .004) and more likely to 
self-soothe so sleep (16 weeks: 44% 
vs 28%; P = .009; 40 weeks: 59% vs 
46%; P = .04). RP infants were more 
likely to be swaddled at 16 weeks 
(33% vs 20%; P = .01) and listen 
to white noise at 40 weeks (34% 
vs 21%; P = .02), whereas pacifier 
use was similar between groups at 
both assessment points. RP mothers 
were also marginally more likely to 
report that their infants fell asleep 
within 15 minutes of being put to 
bed (16 weeks: P = .07; 40 weeks: 
P = .06).
Data from the abbreviated BISQ 
at age 1 year indicated that 61% 
of RP infants were in bed by 8 PM 
versus 52% for controls (P = .11). 
Although this did not reach statistical 
significance, RP mothers reported 
using the same bedtime routine 
every night (55% vs 34%; P = .001), 
a finding supported by the Bedtime 
Routines Questionnaire, which 
demonstrated more consistency 
for the RP group overall (P = .02) 
and on Routine Behaviors (P = .05) 
and Routine Environment (P = .03) 
subscales.
Sleep Duration
At baseline 2 weeks after birth, 
mean (SD) nighttime, daytime, and 
total sleep durations in minutes 
for the entire study cohort were 
485.4 (98.4), 464.9 (99.8), and 
951.4 (151.0), respectively, with 
no study group differences (Fig 2). 
After interventions were initiated, 
however, there were significant 
group differences in reported sleep 
duration. At 8 weeks, total daily sleep 
duration was marginally longer in RP 
infants versus control infants (866.3 
± 130.3 vs 839.2 ± 146.6; P = .10). 
The intervention affected nighttime 
sleep specifically; RP group infants 
slept an average of 532.3 (76.0) 
minutes overnight compared with 
497.2 (90.5) minutes in the control 
group (P < .001). At 16 weeks, a 
marginally significant disparity for

40 weeks, nighttime sleep remained 
longer for the RP group (624.6 ± 67.6 
minutes vs 602.9 ± 76.1 minutes; P = 
.01), but no differences were detected 
in total 24-hour sleep between groups. 
There were no intervention effects 
on daytime sleep at any time point. 
At age 1 year, daytime and nighttime 
sleep durations were similar between 
study groups, although RP infants 
were marginally more likely to sleep 
the recommended 12 to 14 hours per 
day (odds ratio: 1.89, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.95–3.78). There was no 
interaction between feeding mode 
(breastfeeding vs formula feeding) 
and study group on sleep duration at 
any study assessment point.
Sleep-related parenting behaviors 
that were a focus of the RP 
intervention were associated with 
increased nighttime sleep duration 
among the total sample (Fig 3). In 
particular, 16-week nighttime sleep 
duration was longest for infants 
put to bed by 8 PM, regardless of 
intervention group (607.1 vs 550.0 
minutes, P < .001). At 40 weeks, 
infants self-soothing to sleep and 
who had a bedtime at 8 PM or earlier 
slept on average 78 minutes longer 
at night than those who did not self-
soothe and had a bedtime later than 
8 PM (P < .001).
Night Waking and Feeding
At the 2-week baseline and 8-week 
assessments, no differences existed 
in parental response to night 
wakings or number of nighttime 
feedings. Although night waking and 
feeding at night were also similar 
between groups at 16 and 40 weeks, 
those in the RP group were more 
likely to “dream feed” (P < .001 and 
P = .001, respectively), a nighttime 
feed initiated by the parent 
before the parent’s bedtime (RP 
intervention suggestion for infants 
<4 months). Parenting behaviors 
in response to night awakenings 
also differed; consistent with 
intervention content, RP mothers 
were less likely to report feeding 
their infant back to sleep at 16 (54% 
vs 72%; P = .002) and 40 weeks 
(24% vs 41%; P = .005). Finally, at 
40 weeks, these parents were more 
likely to report soothing their child 
with methods other than picking up 
and holding/rocking their infant to 
sleep.
Across study groups, self-soothing to 
sleep and earlier bedtimes predicted 
fewer night waking, fewer nighttime

feeds, and less time awake at night. 
At 16 weeks, those with bedtimes 
after 8 PM who did not self-soothe to 
sleep woke and fed nearly twice as 
often as those with earlier bedtimes 
who self-soothed to sleep (1.85 vs 
0.95 wakings, 1.70 vs 0.81 feeds; 
P < .001 for both). At 40 weeks, 
bedtime was not associated with 
nighttime feedings or wakings, but 
self-soothing to sleep was associated 
with reduced wakings (1.38 vs 0.88; 
P < .001) and feeds (0.89 vs 0.49; 
P = .001) compared with those not 
self-soothing to sleep. Alternatively, 
those who had bedtime by 8 PM 
and self-soothed to sleep had less 
time awake at night compared with 
those who did not engage in these 
behaviors (38 vs 85 minutes; P < 
.001).
DISCUSSION
The INSIGHT RP intervention 
promoted developmentally 
appropriate bedtime routines, 
sleep-related behaviors, and sleep 
duration, particularly nighttime sleep 
duration for infants in the first year. 
In addition to longer reported sleep 
durations at several time points, 
RP mothers were more likely to 
report consistent bedtime routines 
and earlier bedtimes. Their infants 
were more likely to self-soothe to 
sleep without being fed and were 
less likely to be fed back to sleep 
after night wakings. These findings 
are consistent with sleep-related 
content of the RP intervention, which 
was designed to promote healthy 
developmental and behavioral 
outcomes, including the protective 
effect on rapid infant weight gain 
and overweight at age 1 year that we 
recently reported.37
Improving sleep duration and sleep-
related behaviors during infancy can 
affect infant and family well-being in 
both the short- and long-term. Infant 
sleep duration has been associated with 
toddler sleep duration and numerous 
other health outcomes.17, 
29 
For example, Mindell and Lee reported 
that longer nighttime sleep duration 
for infants is associated with improved 
parental perception of infant mood, 
38 
and difficult bedtimes and short 
sleep duration affect socioemotional 
development during the first 2 years 
and beyond.3, 
39 Parental mental health 
is also adversely affected among infants 
who have difficult bedtimes or do not 
sleep well.7, 
8
We included a sleep component in 
our RP intervention designed for 
the primary prevention of obesity 
because previous studies have shown 
inverse relationships between sleep 
duration and both dietary intake and 
weight among infants and young 
children.10–13, 
26, 
40 In an experiment 
designed to promote longer nighttime 
sleep among breastfed infants, 
treatment group participants slept 
longer at night and had fewer 
nocturnal feedings than controls.26 
Data from the Gemini study also 
supported the inverse relationship 
between sleep duration and energy 
intake by demonstrating that 
16-month-old children with short sleep 
durations consumed more calories 
at night, mostly from milk, versus 
their peers who slept longer.40 Recent 
experimental evidence showed that 
within individual children, increasing 
sleep duration resulted in lower energy 
intake, lower levels of leptin, and lower 
weight.15 Although the RP intervention 
increased nighttime sleep duration, 
it did not reduce nighttime feedings. 
However, RP group infants were less 
likely to be picked up, held, and/or fed 
back to sleep, which is consistent with

our objective to reduce feeding as the 
default response to night waking or 
other infant distress.
Limitations of this study include 
maternal self-report of all sleep 
outcome data.33 However, the BISQ 
and other sleep questionnaires 
have shown strong agreement with 
actigraphy-derived sleep duration.33, 
41 
Next, social desirability may have 
influenced some of the findings, 
given that some survey questions 
mapped directly onto intervention 
content. Lastly, the population in 
central Pennsylvania is relatively 
homogeneous with all participants 
coming from 1 center.
Even in this relatively homogeneous 
sample, findings reveal that although 
a greater proportion of RP mothers 
were implementing sleep guidance 
relative to control, a substantial 
proportion of RP mothers were not, 
and future research is needed to 
identify factors associated with uptake 
as well as barriers to implementing the 
RP guidance. Future research could 
address whether key components of 
the RP sleep intervention could be 
delivered as anticipatory guidance 
in a variety of health care settings 
and whether findings generalize to 
sociodemographic groups at increased 
risk for sleep problems and health 
disparities.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings reveal that sleep-
related behaviors are modifiable 
during infancy and that those in the 
RP intervention had longer nighttime 
sleep duration. Clinicians can inform 
parents that simple strategies, 
including a consistent bedtime by 8 PM 
and allowing infants to self-soothe to 
sleep without being held, rocked, or 
fed, are associated with significantly 
longer nighttime sleep durations, fewer 
nighttime wakings and feeds, and less 
time awake at night. RP, which has 
been associated with other positive 
developmental outcomes, 
42 shows 
promise for promoting good sleep 
hygiene and the primary prevention 
of sleep problems, which could affect 
related health and wellness outcomes 
for infants and families.
