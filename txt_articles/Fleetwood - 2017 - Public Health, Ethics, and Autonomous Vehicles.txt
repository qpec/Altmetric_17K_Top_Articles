 Public Health, Ethics, and Autonomous Vehicles
With the potential to save
nearly 30 000 lives per year in
the United States, autonomous
vehicles portend the most sig-
nificant advance in auto safety
history by shifting the focus
from minimization of postcrash
injury to collision prevention.
I have delineated the im-
portant public health implica-
tions of autonomous vehicles
and provided a brief analysis of
a critically important ethical
issue inherent in autonomous
vehicle design.
The broad expertise, ethical
principles, and values of public
health should be brought to
bear on a wide range of issues
pertaining to autonomous ve-
hicles. (Am J Public Health.

T
he public’s health has been
dramatically affected by
improvements in automotive
design, such as seatbelts and
automatic airbags, yet nothing
portends a more significant re-
duction in morbidity and mor-
tality rates from motor vehicle
accidents than autonomous
vehicles, sometimes known as
“driverless, “robotic,” or “self-
driving” cars.1,2 Motor vehicle
safety ranks among one of the past
decade’s “ten great public health
achievements”3 in the United
States, right up there with to-
bacco control, prevention and
control of infectious disease, and
occupational safety.4 Autono-
mous vehicles, which could re-
duce traffic fatalities by up to 90%
by eliminating accidents caused
by human error—estimated to be
94% of fatalities—could save
more than 29 000 lives per year in
the United States alone.5,6
Around the world, autonomous
cars could save 10 million lives
per decade, creating one of the
most important public health
advances of the 21st century.7,8
Although crash avoidance or
mitigation of harm caused by
motor vehicle accidents are spe-
cifically public safety issues, for
simplicity I have included public
safety issues under the intellectual
umbrella of public health. From
the vantage point of public
health, the overarching goal is to
transform the current approach
to automotive safety from re-
ducing injuries after collisions to
complete collision prevention.
Although the feasibility of cre-
ating an autonomous vehicle that
never crashes is debatable and,
by some analyses, impossible to
achieve—considering the burst
of enthusiasm, investment, and
effort in autonomous vehicle
technology—it is time to reflect
on the many public health issues
that have not yet been adequately
analyzed or discussed.9,10
Vehicles equipped with auto-
mated driving systems are
described in the literature as
“autonomous,” “driverless,”
“robotic,” or “self-driving,” yet it
is important to clarify distinctions
and use terms consistently. SAE
International (formerly the Soci-
ety of Automotive Engineers)
specifies 5 levels of automation,
and the US National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration re-
cently adopted this system.11–13
Levels start at level 0—no
automation—which relies on
a human driver, full-time, for all
aspects of driving. In level 1—
driver assistance—the system
sometimes assists with a specific
task, like steering or acceleration
and deceleration, with the human
driver performing all remaining
tasks. In level 2—partial automa-
tion—the system performs tasks,
such as steering along with ac-
celeration and deceleration, and
the human monitors and is oth-
erwise fully responsible for the
remainder of driving tasks. In level
3—conditional automation—the
system manages all driving
tasks and monitors the driving
environment, and the human
intervenes only when the
system requires assistance. In level
4—high automation—the system
drives and monitors in certain
environments and conditions
without a human response and is
considered fully autonomous in
many driving scenarios, and the
system performs even if a human
driver does not respond appro-
priately to a request for inter-
vention. Finally, in level 5—full
automation—the system does
everything a human driver could
do under all conditions, matching
or exceeding a human’s capabil-
ities in every driving scenario.
A key distinction is that in
levels 1 and 2, a human driver
monitors the driving environ-
ment, whereas in higher levels
the driver can cede control under
certain conditions and an auto-
mated driving system will mon-
itor the driving environment and
take control. Some vehicles may
have multiple features that allow
them to operate at different levels
depending on which levels are
engaged. I, focusing on ethics and
public health, emphasize vehicles
that can drive themselves in-
dependently, without human
intervention or continuous

 monitoring, at least some of the
time. I refer to this type of ve-
hicle, classified in SAE levels 3, 4,
and 5, with the generic term
“autonomous vehicle” to en-
hance clarity and simplicity.
Autonomous vehicles are on
their way. Google began their
test project in 2009 and has
clocked more than 1.5 million
miles with test drivers aboard in
California, Texas, Washington,
and Arizona,14 and then-President
Barack Obama proposed spend-
ing $4 billion to “accelerate the
acceptance” of autonomous ve-
hicles in the United States.15 In
August 2016, Singapore led the
innovation race with the world’s
first autonomous taxis operated
by nuTonomy, a highly auton-
omous vehicle software startup
with the goal of creating a fully
autonomous fleet by 2018.16 In
nuTonomy’s test phase, a human
driver sits in the front seat pre-
pared to take the wheel if nec-
essary while a backseat researcher
monitors the vehicle computers.
Not to be outpaced, Uber
established the Advanced Tech-
nologies Center in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, with the goal of
“bringing safe, reliable trans-
portation to everyone, every-
where” and, in September 2016,
began testing autonomous vehi-
cles with live passengers and an
ancillary human driver on Pitts-
burgh streets.17,18 The poten-
tial worldwide market is
huge, and international
automakers— including Volvo,
Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, Tesla,
and Ford—are rapidly exploring
autonomous vehicle technology.
On a larger scale, prototype au-
tonomous buses were tested in
Switzerland and Finland, and
autonomous trucks are already
being tested on highways in
Colorado and Nevada.19–22
Autonomous vehicles are re-
plete with public health issues
that have ethical implications that
warrant cogent analysis and in-
formed response.23 Several re-
cent symposia have discussed the
ethical issues of autonomous
vehicles but did not have a spe-
cifically public health focus.24–27
Conversely, a recent symposium
on autonomous vehicles at the
Johns Hopkins Center for Injury
Research and Policy in the
Bloomberg School of Public
Health and a recent report by the
Altarum Institute examined au-
tonomous vehicles and the role of
public health but did not focus
sustained attention on ethical is-
sues.28,29 All this important work
sets the stage for future academic
symposia, publications, public
hearings, and community con-
versations that should examine,
in depth, the important ethical
and public health ramifications
of autonomous vehicles.
APPLYING PUBLIC
HEALTH ETHICS
The introduction and poten-
tial proliferation of autonomous
vehicles present the classic chal-
lenge of balancing the freedom
of private manufacturers to in-
novate with government’s re-
sponsibility to protect public
health.30 Autonomous vehicles
raise many public health issues
beyond their potential to im-
prove safety, ranging from con-
cerns about more automobile use
and less use of healthier alterna-
tives like biking or walking to
concerns that focusing on au-
tonomous vehicles may distract
attention and divert funding from
efforts to improve mass transit.
There are, additionally, issues
of access, especially for the poor,
disabled, and those in rural
environments.
There are important and
complex policy and regulatory
concerns; insurance issues,
including the possibility of
a no-fault auto insurance system
for autonomous vehicles; prod-
uct and tort liability issues; and
issues pertaining to privacy and
cybersecurity for all communi-
cations into and within the ve-
hicle, all of which are beyond the
scope of this article.31–38 Finally,
we have just begun to explore the
effect autonomous vehicles will
have on traffic, pollution, and the
built environment.28 Clearly,
many issues affect the health of
the public beyond accident pre-
vention and, with their consid-
erable skills as researchers, data
analysts, policy advocates, and
community catalysts, public
health leaders have much to
contribute to conversations
about health impacts, equity,
social justice, and the values
of public health.39
I provide an example and brief
analysis of a very important eth-
ical issue for autonomous vehi-
cles; the algorithms being created
for autonomous vehicles in situ-
ations of forced choice, such as
whether to hit a parked car or
a pedestrian on an ice-covered
road. I argue for greater in-
volvement starting now, during
the design phase, of public health
leaders and describe how the
values of public health can guide
conversations and ultimate de-
cisions. By reflecting on the
ethical and social implications
of autonomous vehicles and
working collaboratively with
designers, manufacturers,
companies like Uber and nuTon-
omy, city health departments, the
public, and policymakers on the
local, state, and federal level, public
health leaders can help develop
guidelines that foster equity and
safety across the population.
A widely cited framework for
public health ethics provides
a starting place for public health
leaders to frame the questions and
influence the decisions that will
be made in the coming months
and years.39 As the classic
Code of Ethics for Public Health40
recommends, public health ad-
vocates can advocate the rights of
individuals and their communi-
ties while protecting public
health by helping to establish
policies and priorities through
“processes that ensure an op-
portunity for input from com-
munity members.” 40(p1058)
Public health thought leaders can
ensure that communities have the
information they need for in-
formed decisions about whether
and how autonomous vehicles
will traverse their streets, and they
can make sure that manufacturers
who test and deploy autonomous
vehicles obtain “the commun-
ity’s consent for their imple-
mentation.”40(p1058) Finally,
public health leaders can work for
the empowerment of the disen-
franchised, incorporating and re-
specting “diverse values, beliefs,
and cultures in the community”
and collaborating “in ways that
build the public’s trust.”40(p1058)
CAN GOVERNMENT
REGULATION KEEP
PACE?
Autonomous vehicles con-
stantly obtain information from
their environment, using a vari-
ety of sophisticated cameras and
sensors that rely on ultrasound,
radar, and laser-based ranging, or
“lidar.” A variety of advanced
technologies enable autonomous
vehicles to correct for human
mistakes and “learn” from the
“experience” of other autono-
mous vehicles. Because all store
sensor data, engineers are able to
reconstruct events of a crash and
examine what the vehicle sensed
through its multiple inputs and
analyze the logic it used to de-
termine its course. Manufacturers

 and software developers can then
use this information to modify
the car’s program and thereby
improve future decisions. Yet
each such improvement, every
choice, is replete with ethical
assumptions. However, machine
learning has only begun to ex-
plore moral behavior—or ethical
crashing algorithms—for auton-
omous vehicles.41,42 Is it better to
kill 2 autonomous vehicle pas-
sengers or 2 pedestrians? One
person or 1 animal? Collide with
a wall or run over a box with un-
known contents? Forced choices
like these must be programmed in
with sophisticated algorithms that,
ultimately, rest on fundamental—
but largely unarticulated—ethical
assumptions.
In September 2016, the US
Department of Transportation
issued the very first Federal Au-
tomated Vehicles Policy.13 In
that document, the department
highlighted the transformational
change affecting the automobile
industry, stating that autonomous
vehicles “may prove to be the
greatest personal transportation
revolution since the populariza-
tion of the personal automobile
nearly a century ago.”13 Among
other things, the department
provides 15 safety standards for
testing what they refer to as highly
autonomous vehicles, including
fullyself-drivingcars,andrequiring
safeguards for system failures. On
the single page devoted to ethical
issues of autonomous vehicles in
the 116-page policy, the de-
partment recognizes the com-
plexity and challenges of ethical
issues, such as forced-choice al-
gorithms, and states:
This discussion is intended only
to introduce the relevance
and importance of ethical
considerations to the
development and deployment of
HAVs [highly autonomous
vehicles]. It is not intended to be
exhaustive or definitive or to
answer ethical questions, but
rather only to raise the general
topic of ethics as worthy of
discussion and consideration
by manufacturers, consumers,
government, and other
stakeholders.13(section 11)
FORCED-CHOICE
ALGORITHMS
We can anticipate that many
ethical and policy issues will be
raised by the adoption of au-
tonomous vehicles. Autonomous
vehicles present classic ethical
conflicts between an individual’s
interest—that passengers arrive
quickly, cheaply, and safely at
their destination—and the com-
munity’s interest—that roads be
safe for all travelers, including
passengers in both autonomous
and driver-dependent vehicles,
as well as bicyclists and pedes-
trians.43 Our government has
various duties to protect the
population, including increasing
the availability of information to
the public and to decision-
makers, protecting people from
harm, and providing the condi-
tions under which people can
lead healthy lives.44
Public health ethics addition-
ally recognizes the need to reduce
health inequalities and protect
vulnerable groups. Although
certain freedoms are infringed
on—I cannot, for example, build
my own highway off-ramp to
provide myself a shortcut to my
house—such restrictive laws
balance individual freedom with
community benefit or pre-
vention from harm. The political
process includes balancing com-
peting interests and, further, ex-
tends to regulating the behavior
of others (in this case, autono-
mous car manufacturers and
companies, such as Uber and
nuTonomy, which deploy the
vehicles) and establishing mech-
anisms for ongoing transparency
and accountability. Although
autonomous vehicles may help
reduce morbidity and mortality
from motor vehicle accidents,
their design and use must be
tempered by regulations that are
devised following an informed,
collaborative political process that
meets the objectives and aligns
with the values of public health.
Driving in the real world
frequently poses ethically chal-
lenging situations requiring
drivers to make sophisticated,
nearly instantaneous, ethical de-
cisions, and it is simplistic to as-
sume that self-driving cars need
only follow the rules of the road.
Driving examples abound, as
when a driver deliberately crosses
a double yellow line into an
empty lane reserved for oncom-
ing traffic rather than hit a person
changing a tire on the shoulder of
the road or when a driver goes
through a red traffic signal to get
out of the path of an oncoming
train. The autonomous vehicle,
like the human driver, must
balance safety, mobility, and le-
gality when those objectives
conflict. A research scientist at the
University of Virginia Trans-
portation Research Council
states that automated vehicles
must decide quickly, with
incomplete information, in
situations that programmers often
will not have considered, using
ethics that must be encoded
all too literally in software.
Fortunately, the public doesn’t
expect superhuman wisdom but
rather a rational justification for
a vehicle’s actions that considers
the ethical implications. A
solution doesn’t need to be
perfect, but it should be
thoughtful and defensible.45
Yet just what is required for
a decision to be ethically de-
fensible? Hypothetical situations
illustrating ethical conflicts be-
tween competing undesirable
outcomes in which an agent must
make a choice have long been the
objects of philosophic debate and
can help illuminate the kinds of
ethical issues involved here. The
trolley problem, a scenario cre-
ated by philosopher Philippa
Foot in 1967 and popularized by
many other philosophers and
cognitive scientists since, presents
a conflict that has been widely
cited in discussions of self-driving
cars.46,47 Although there are
some points of disanalogy that I
willnotdiscuss,initssimplestform
the trolley problem supposes that
there is a runaway trolley on train
tracks heading directly for 5
people who are, inexplicably, tied
to the tracks.48 You, the reader,
are standing beside a lever that, if
pulled, will switch the trolley to
a different track that has only 1
persontiedtoit.Youcaneitherdo
nothing, allowing the speeding
trolley to kill the 5 people on the
main track, or divert the trolley by
pulling the lever, resulting in
the death of just 1 person. The
thought experiment asks which
choice is most ethically justifiable.
For US drivers on the horns of
this kind of dilemma in the real
world, the sudden emergency
doctrine and the unavoidable ac-
cident doctrine provide legal
protection in some states for rea-
sonably prudent human drivers
who make questionable choices
under very limited and extenu-
ating circumstances.49,50 We must
consider whether the decisions
made by autonomous vehicles
should be legally protected in the
sameway. Willmanufacturersand
vehicle owners avoid liability in
such situations? Although the
need for the implementation of
a forced-choice algorithm may
arise infrequently on the road, it is
important to analyze and resolve
such issues as much as possible
early in the development phase.
Of course, one can simply
tally the death toll and argue on
a utilitarian basis that the death of
AJPH LAW & ETHICS

 1 person is preferable to the death
of 5, or resort to a straightforward
rule-based approach that applies
a seemingly inviolable rule, such
as “do not kill.” Yet, in addition
to providing inconsistent di-
rectives, such simplistic ap-
proaches miss the complexities of
forced-choice situations. Is it
worse to actively pull the lever to
change course than to just let
things happen as fate allows? Is it
really better to just stand there
and watch to avoid breaking
a rule? Should we quickly assess
the social value of the 5 potential
victims versus the 1 victim, not-
ing perhaps that the 5 are wearing
Nazi uniforms and the 1 is dressed
as a nurse? Would the death of
children be more repugnant than
the death of elderly adults? Should
pregnant women count twice,
once for themselves and once for
the fetus? Finally, in an accident
causing injuries but not fatalities,
should algorithms prioritize de-
cisions by the likelihood, severity,
and quality of life effects of various
types of injuries as well as the
number of people injured?
Perhaps some data will help.
In a recent empirical study of
autonomous car ethics, partici-
pants were given various hypo-
thetical forced-choice accident
scenarios and asked to choose
between the death of 1 or more
pedestrians and the death of
a passenger or several passengers
in the autonomous vehicle.51,52
The study found that 76% agreed
that the most justified approach
was the utilitarian approach in
that the autonomous vehicle
sacrificed its own passengers if
that would result in saving more
lives overall (n = 182; 95%
confidence interval = 69, 82).
However, when it came to
purchasing an autonomous ve-
hicle, respondents were signifi-
cantly less likely to buy an
autonomous vehicle if they and
their family were the passengers
to be sacrificed in a forced-choice
accident scenario than if they and
their family members were not
sacrificed for the greater good
(scale = 1–100; median = 19;
P < .001).52 In short, study par-
ticipants wanted other people to
buy vehicles that made utilitarian
choices to preferentially save the
most people but preferred to
purchase a vehicle that prefer-
entially protected its own
passengers.
For those who want to chal-
lenge their own ethical
decision-making, the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology
Media Lab has created an online
platform that generates autono-
mous vehicle accident scenar-
ios.51,52 Results gathered from
previous users enable participants
to see how their responses
compare with those of others,
vividly illustrating the complex-
ity of the moral choices and the
range of outcomes. Although
some have argued that experi-
mental analyses of the trolley
problem suffer from low external
validity, and the early work has
uncovered a wide range of re-
sults, projects like these aptly
demonstrate the inconsistencies
in participants’ ethical reasoning
and the need to think carefully
about the ethical challenges of
forced-choice algorithms.53
As public health experts think
about forced-choice scenarios,
concerns for fairness, equity,
and informed choice should
lead to discussions about the
possible difference between
a pedestrian—who is literally an
innocent bystander—and the
occupants of an autonomous
vehicle—who have voluntarily
climbed aboard. By choosing to
ride in an autonomous vehicle,
passengers have access to a level of
safety and convenience that is
unparalleled in other forms of
transportation. Should those
voluntary passengers in the
autonomous vehicle—who are
directly benefiting from the
technology—bear some slight
additional risk over pedestrians
when a forced-choice scenario
arises, even if the pedestrians are
fewer in number than the pas-
sengers in the autonomous vehi-
cle?Dotheyhaveadutytoprotect
innocent bystanders from harm?
Moreover, does boarding an au-
tonomous vehicle constitute im-
plicit agreement to assume slight,
but additional, risk? If so, to what
extent, and how will autonomous
vehicle passengers be informed
about any additional level of risk
they might be assuming?
Of course, manufacturers
might object strenuously to
codifying that risk ratio into the
forced-choice algorithm. As
a research scientist at the Virginia
Transportation Research Coun-
cil and others point out, the
owner of a private autonomous
vehicle might reasonably
assume that the vehicle would
preferentially protect its own
occupants.54–56 Passengers’
knowledge that autonomous
vehicles may be programmed to
prioritize the other vehicle or
pedestrian in some forced-choice
scenarios might well have
a chilling effect on their enthu-
siasm as riders. Consumer
acceptance might plummet,
because passengers may prefer to
take their chances with a live
driver rather than ride in an au-
tonomous vehicle in which the
odds are, even slightly, stacked
against it and them.
Similarly, one could argue that
a taxicab for temporary hire
should prefer the safety of its own
passengers during the time that
the paying passenger is in it.
And, from a public health per-
spective, if concerns about self-
preservation lead fewer people to
ride in autonomous vehicles,
then society as a whole would
experience a net loss as more
people will die from manned
vehicle accidents, clearly running
counter to the goals of public
health. Of course, if all cars in
a community were autonomous
vehicles, and all autonomous
vehicles in that community were
programmed to give priority to
the other vehicle in case of a tie in
the number of likely deaths—an
algorithm ethically well-
grounded in beneficence—we
would end up with a net gain of
lives saved. However, it seems
very unlikely that (1) all cars in
a community will be autono-
mous any time soon and
(2) autonomous vehicle manu-
facturers, or consumers, would
find this forced-choice algorithm
acceptable. Nevertheless, these
somewhat far-fetched scenarios
can illuminate important ethical
distinctions and warrant open,
rational discussion.
Inresponsetotheforced-choice
dilemma, some autonomous
vehicle supporters claim that
autonomous cars will never
get themselves into such
forced-choice situations, so such
discussions are merely intellectual
exercises without practical ap-
plication. They optimistically
assert that, like omniscient, om-
nipotent beings, autonomous
vehicles will be able to anticipate
danger far enough ahead to avoid
every potential mishap. Although
eventually we might reach such
a state of autonomous perfection,
programmers right now are de-
termining how the autonomous
car should react under various
conditions and are implicitly
applying various ethical assump-
tions. They recognize that the
vehicles are not perfect and will
not be any time soon. What are
we to do in the interim while
the autonomous vehicles are
“learning” from their mistakes?

morbidity and mortality from

 assume a near-ideal imple-
mentation, with few if any me-
chanical or software failures, but
they also assume that forced de-
cisions are being made now using
solid logic grounded firmly in
broadly acceptable ethical pre-
cepts. We must deal with these
challenges by engaging in in-
formed discussion using well-
justified frameworks and ac-
cepted principles of public health
ethics and by asking the right
questions now so that manufac-
turers, stakeholders, and the
government develop guidelines
for algorithms, policies, laws, and
regulations that promote fairness
and equity and align with the
values of public health.
A CALL TO ACTION
I have discussed autonomous
vehicles and public health ethics,
focusing on the design-stage
example of forced-choice algo-
rithms and arguing that there is an
important and immediate role for
public health expertise, advo-
cacy, and community engage-
ment in the discussions about
autonomous vehicles. Public
health leaders can focus on 4
pragmatic areas with ethical im-
pact, including (1) advocating
transparent and collaborative
discussion of public health issues
related to autonomous vehicles,
starting with the forced-choice
algorithms under development
by manufacturers; (2) expanding
the public’s awareness of the
ideals of public health and ethical
issues relevant to autonomous
vehicles; (3) facilitating the in-
clusion of broad perspectives—
including the historically disen-
franchised—in the discussion of
issues, including community in-
put into when, where, and how
autonomous vehicles are tested
and deployed; and (4) ensuring
that rational, ethically justifiable
regulations are developed con-
sistently across states, codified by
the appropriate government
agency, funded appropriately,
and implemented, monitored,
and assessed effectively.
Public health leaders should
welcome autonomous vehicles as
an incredible innovation that will
likely transform transportation,
especially in urban environments,
while saving lives. It is incumbent
on public health experts to keep
pace with the evolving technol-
ogy, lead and participate actively
in informed discussions, engage
communities broadly, advocate
rational and consistent regula-
tions, systematically analyze
ethical issues, and insist that
outcomes be measured and dis-
seminated effectively. It is only
through early and consistent
engagement that public health
leaders will ensure that their
unique skills, knowledge, values,
and perspective take the lead in
the important ongoing conver-
sations about autonomous
vehicles.
