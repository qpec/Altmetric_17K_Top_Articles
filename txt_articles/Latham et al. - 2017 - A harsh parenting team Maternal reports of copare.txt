Background: Parenting and coparenting are both important for children’s adjustment, but 
their interaction has been little explored. Using a longitudinal design and considering two 
children per family, we investigated mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of coparenting as 
moderators of associations between their coercive parenting and children’s disruptive 
behaviour. Methods: Mothers and fathers from 106 ‘intact’ families were included from the 
Twins, Family and Behaviour study (TFaB). At Time 1 (Mchild age=3 years 11 months, SDchild 
age=4.44 months) parents reported on their coercive parenting and children’s disruptive 
behaviour via questionnaire; at Time 2 (Mchild age=4 years 8 months, SDchild age=4.44 months) 
perceptions of coparenting and the marital relationship were collected by telephone interview. 
Questionnaire-based reports of children’s disruptive behaviour were collected at follow-up 
(Mchild age=5 years 11 months, SDchild age=5.52 months). Multilevel modelling was used to 
examine child-specific and family-wide effects. Results: Conservative multilevel models 
including both maternal and paternal perceptions demonstrated that maternal perceptions of 
coparenting and overall coercive parenting interacted in their prediction of parent-reported 
child disruptive behaviour. Specifically, accounting for perceived marital quality, behavioural 
stability, and fathers’ perceptions, only in the context of perceived higher quality coparenting 
was there a positive association between mother-reported overall coercive parenting and 
children’s disruptive behaviour at follow-up. Conclusions: When combined with highly 
coercive parenting, maternal perceptions of high quality coparenting may be detrimental for 
children’s adjustment. Keywords: Coercive parenting, coparenting, disruptive behaviour, 
moderation.

Children’s disruptive behaviour confers substantial long-term psychosocial risk to the 
individual as well as potential societal burden, with notable emphasis on preschool onset (see 
review, Costello & Maughan, 2015). As such, it is vital to understand family processes 
implicated in the development of these problems. The role of parents has received 
considerable attention in this regard; in particular, harsh, coercive parenting—a negative 
discipline strategy characterised by smacking, shouting and scolding—has been consistently 
associated with increased disruptive behaviour (Gershoff, 2002; Oliver, 2015; Patterson, 
1982; Wiggins, Mitchell, Hyde, & Monk, 2015). However, family systems theory 
conceptualises the family as an organised whole made up of interconnected, interdependent 
subsystems (Minuchin, 1988) emphasising the importance of the broader family context. 
Accordingly, the inter-parental (hereon referred to as ‘marital’) relationship has been a 
common research focus (e.g., Amato & Keith, 1991; Davies & Cummings, 1994), including 
in the preschool years (Stover et al., 2016). However, increasingly attention has turned to 
coparenting.  
 
Coparenting and Children’s Adjustment  
Coparenting describes the way in which adults work together in their role as parents 
(Feinberg, 2002). Termed the ‘executive subsystem’, coparenting is conceptualised as 
comprising multiple constructs including support, undermining, closeness, conflict, division 
of labour, child-rearing agreement, and parenting endorsement. These constructs are 
important individually but may also be considered together as a global measure of 
coparenting quality (Feinberg, 2003). Thus, high quality coparenting may be evidenced by, 
for example, expressions of warmth during interactions with the child, shared child-rearing 
values and actions that support and extend a coparent’s parenting efforts. In contrast, lower 
quality coparenting may involve criticism, or actions that thwart or undermine their parenting

attempts (Van Egeren & Hawkins, 2004). Conceptually, coparenting is considered distinct 
from both the marital relationship and from parenting per se—although related to both. 
Moreover, because of its greater proximity to the child, coparenting is seen as likely to be 
more closely associated with children’s development than the marital relationship (Feinberg, 
2002). 
Researchers commonly consider coparenting in child infancy, viewing the transition to 
parenthood as a key period. However, the developmental changes characteristic of early 
childhood—not least the child’s increasing autonomy—bring new challenges for the 
coparenting team, to which it must adapt and respond (McHale & Irace, 2011). As well as 
these child influences on coparenting, consistent evidence suggests that coparenting 
influences children’s adjustment. For example, positive, supportive coparenting has been 
linked with fewer internalising and externalising behaviour problems in toddlers (Kolak & 
Vernon-Feagans, 2008), fewer aggressive interactions enacted during pre-schoolers’ doll play 
(McHale, Johnson, & Sinclair, 1999) and better social skills at age 4 years (Cabrera, Scott, 
Fagan, Steward-Streng, & Chien, 2012). Conversely, undermining and less supportive 
coparenting has been associated with decreased inhibition in 3-year-olds (Belsky, Putnam, & 
Crnic, 1996), and with externalising behaviour problems in preschool children (Schoppe, 
Mangelsdorf, & Frosch, 2001). Importantly, associations have been demonstrated over and 
above parenting and marital quality (see review, Teubert & Pinquart, 2010).   
  
Interactive Processes 
In line with family systems theory (Minuchin, 1988), the marital relationship and 
parenting have been considered as interactive processes for child outcomes (e.g., DeBoard-
Lucas, Fosco, Raynor, & Grych, 2010), but coparenting has been relatively neglected. Yet, 
for two-parent families, individual parenting frequently takes place in front of the other 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING

parent (Cox & Paley, 1997) such that parenting may be better understood in the light of its 
coparenting context.  
To our knowledge, only three published studies have examined the interaction 
between parenting and coparenting in relation to children’s adjustment. For example, Stright 
and Neitzel (2003) demonstrated a buffering role for observed supportive coparenting on the 
relationship between observed parent rejection of children’s problem-solving efforts and 
subsequent observations and teacher-ratings of classroom adjustment. Compared to children 
in families where coparenting was observed to be less supportive, in the context of supportive 
coparenting, children had better classroom adjustment even when parents were critical of 
their efforts. Similarly, Scrimgeour, Blandon, Stifter, and Buss (2013) reported a ‘protective-
stabilising’ effect of highly cooperative coparenting for preschool children’s prosocial 
behaviour, finding observations of coparenting to buffer the effects of mother-reported low 
use of inductive reasoning. Finally, in toddlers, Kwon, Jeon, and Elicker (2013) explored 
associations between maternal and paternal perceptions of coparenting, observed parental 
guidance and maternal-reports of social-emotional competencies, but found no interaction. 
Emerging research, then, suggests that considering parenting within its coparenting 
context may be important for child adjustment, but findings are mixed and the constructs 
examined rather narrow, warranting further research. Specifically, relatively little attention 
has been given to the perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ within a family. Historically, there 
has been some resistance to using parents’ reports in family research (e.g., Holden & 
Edwards, 1989), however, evidence suggests that they may be critical for understanding 
family processes (e.g., Acitelli, Douvan, & Veroff, 1993; Montoya, Horton, & Kirchner, 
2008). Moreover, given the plethora of research on its deleterious role for child adjustment, 
coercive parenting is a prime candidate for examining in the coparenting context, but remains 
unstudied.

Current Study 
We aimed to examine potential interactive effects of coparenting and coercive parenting 
on children’s disruptive behaviour, seeking to extend the existing literature in three main 
ways. First, we examined changes in children’s disruptive behaviour during the transition to 
school. Early-onset disruptive behaviour is of particular importance for long-term outcomes 
(Costello & Maughan, 2015). Moreover, school transition is an important period for 
children’s socio-emotional development, during which family influences may be particularly 
salient (e.g., Olson, Sameroff, Lunkenheimer, & Kerr, 2009; Sher-Censor, Khafi, & Yates, 
2016). Second, we investigated both mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of coparenting and 
coercive parenting together. Third, research examining associations between coparenting and 
children’s adjustment—like family research more generally—has typically relied on one 
child per family; using multilevel modelling (MLM), we considered twin pairs. For the first 
time, we capitalise on a twin sample to examine child-specific and shared coparenting and 
parenting effects, as well as their interaction, while naturally controlling for sibling age 
differences. Twin families represent an important, yet understudied, population for 
coparenting, since parents report experiencing more parenting stress (Olivennes, Golombok, 
Ramogida, Rust, & Team, 2005). In line with the—albeit scant—previous research, we 
anticipated higher quality coparenting to buffer children from coercive parenting, evidenced 
by lower levels of disruptive behaviour at follow-up. 
 
 
Method 
Sample & Procedure 
 
The Twins, Family and Behaviour (TFaB) study involves families with twins born in 
England and Wales in 2009-2010 (see AUTHOR CITATION). We included a subsample of 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING 
5 
 
106 ‘intact’, cohabiting families (91.5% married) where both parents were active participants 
(212 children, 49.5% female; 44 monozygotic and 58 dizygotic twin pairs, 4 pairs zygosity 
unclassified). Twin zygosity was determined using maternal reports shown to be 95+% 
accurate when compared to DNA testing (Price et al., 2000). The subsample was well-
educated (70.59% of mothers and 61.96% of fathers had an undergraduate degree or higher 
qualification), and the majority were in part- or full-time employment (93.48% fathers, 
77.67% mothers). Families categorised their total household income, endorsing the full range 
(<£5,000 to >£100,000; “average” category endorsed was £40,000-£49,999, comparable to 
the UK average of £46,500 (UK Census, 2011)).  
 
Data were used from postal questionnaire (Time 1: Mchild age=3 years 11 months, 
SDchild age=4.44 months); 40-minute telephone interview (Time 2: Mchild age=4 years 8 months, 
SDchild age= 4.44 months) and follow-up questionnaire (Time 3: Mchild age=5 years 11 months, 
SDchild age=5.52 months). Informed consent was provided at each study phase. The project was 
approved by NHS Health Research Authority, National Research Ethics Service committee 
and the University of Sussex Science & Technology Cross-schools Research Ethics 
Committee. 
 
Measures 
Child disruptive behaviour (Time 1; Time 3) was measured using the Intensity scale 
of the 36-item Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg & Pincus, 1999). Example 
items include, ‘acts defiant when asked to do something’ and ‘destroys toys and other 
objects’. For each child, mothers and fathers reported the frequency of each behaviour on a 7-
point scale (‘never’ (coded 1) to ‘always’ (7)) (mothers α=.89/.94; fathers α=.91/.94). Items 
were summed for each parent (maternal/paternal rTime 1=.48; rTime 3=.57), and these scores 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING 
6 
 
combined to yield mean ECBI scores at Time 1 and Time 3. The ECBI has demonstrated 
high reliability and validity across age and SES (Eyberg, Colvin, & Adams, 1999). 
Coercive parenting (Time 1) was assessed using the subscale from the Parenting and 
Family Adjustment Scale (PAFAS; Sanders, Morawska, Haslam, Filus, & Fletcher, 2014), 
comprising five items (e.g., ‘I shout or get angry with him/her when s/he misbehaves’, and ‘I 
smack him/her when s/he misbehaves’). Items were rated on a 4-point scale (‘not at all’ (0) to 
‘very much/most of the time’ (3)), and summed such that higher total scores indicated more 
coercive parenting (mothers α=.71/.72; fathers α=.56/.60). The PAFAS has been validated in 
a normative sample (Sanders et al., 2014; see Discussion). 
Family-wide variables were calculated as family averages (across the twins) for 
maternal and paternal coercive parenting, and child-specific variables created as 
discrepancies from this average, capturing the amount and direction of differential treatment 
(Jenkins et al., 2009). For example, in a family where the coercive parenting score is 2 for 
TwinA and 3 for TwinB, family-wide (‘overall’) coercive parenting would be (2+3)/2=2.5 for 
both children; child-specific (‘differential’) coercive parenting would be 2-2.5=-0.5 for 
TwinA, and 3-2.5=0.5 for TwinB.  
Marital quality (Time 2) perceptions were assessed for mothers and fathers using the 
six-item Quality Marriage Index (Norton, 1983). Items include ‘My relationship with my 
partner makes me happy’ and ‘My relationship with my partner is very stable’. Responses 
were given on a 7-point scale (‘disagree strongly’ (1) to ‘agree strongly’ (7)); the final item, 
‘Please rate the degree of happiness, everything considered, in your relationship’, used a 10-
point scale (1=low-10=high). A higher score indicated higher perceived marital quality 
(mothers α=.94; fathers α=.89). This measure has excellent convergent and discriminant 
validity (Heyman, Sayers, & Bellack, 1994).

Coparenting.  Mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of coparenting were assessed (Time 
2) using a short-form of the Coparenting Relationship Scale. This 14-item Brief Measure of 
Coparenting (Feinberg, Brown, & Kan, 2012) includes items such as, ‘My partner 
undermines my parenting’, and ‘My partner and I have different ideas about how to raise 
[child]’, which encompass seven core coparenting constructs (support, undermining, conflict, 
agreement, closeness, endorsement and division of labour). Responses were given on a 7-
point scale (‘disagree strongly’ (1) to ‘agree strongly’ (7)). Negative items were reversed, and 
responses averaged such that a higher score reflected perceptions of higher quality 
coparenting (mothers α=.75; fathers α=.63). The Brief Measure of Coparenting has shown 
good internal reliability, construct and convergent validity (Feinberg et al., 2012).  
 
Missing Data & Statistical Power 
At Time 1 and Time 2, never more than 15% (range 2.8% (mothers’ coercive parenting, 
Time 1) - 14.15% (fathers’ ECBI, Time 1) missing data were observed. At Time 3, 21.7% of 
mothers’ and 27.4% of fathers’ ECBI data were missing. Data were not Missing Completely 
At Random (Little, 1988) (�2(156)=211.06, p=.002). Thus, multilevel multiple imputation 
was implemented in MPlus, allowing imputation of variables at all levels (Muthén & Muthén, 
2012). Fifty datasets were imputed and MLM fitted to the pooled data (Graham, Olchowski, 
& Gilreath, 2007). For MLM, the sample size at the highest level most strongly influences 
statistical power (Snijders, 2005). In two-level models, simulation studies have indicated that 
a sample greater than 50 at the highest level (here, families) provides reliable estimates of 
coefficients, variances and standard errors (Maas & Hox, 2005).  
 
Analytic Strategy 
We used MLM to account for the nested, non-independent nature of our data, and to 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING

enable the simultaneous examination of family-wide factors (contributing to sibling similarity 
in disruptive behaviour and their differentiation from children in other families), and child-
specific factors (contributing to sibling differences). Note that child-specific predictors may 
explain both within- and between-family variance, whereas family-wide predictors can 
account only for between-family variance. MLM yields fixed effects much like traditional 
regression coefficients, and random effects, which refer to the estimates of within- and 
between-family level variance once predictor variables are accounted for. The use of MLM 
for family data is detailed elsewhere (Jenkins et al., 2009). 
A series of models included both maternal and paternal predictors at different levels 
(and their interactions) to examine their contribution to variance in child disruptive 
behaviour. Model 1 estimated within- and between-family variance in children’s disruptive 
behaviour; the intraclass correlation (ICC), calculated as the between-family variance divided 
by the total variance, indicated the degree of sibling behavioural similarity. Model 2 indexed 
behavioural stability from Time 1 to Time 3. Model 3 controlled for this stability and 
perceptions of marital quality, as well as adding coparenting, and child-specific and family-
wide coercive parenting predictors. Finally, Model 4 added child-specific (overall coercive 
parenting*differential coercive parenting, and coparenting*differential coercive parenting) 
and family-wide (coparenting*overall coercive parenting) interaction terms.  
MPlus v.6 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012), was used with Full Maximum Likelihood 
estimation, chosen over Restricted Likelihood, to examine regression coefficients and 
variance components at the same time (Bickel, 2007). All variables were residualised 
standardised scores (controlling for child age and sex).

Results 
Preliminary Analyses 
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all study variables.  
---TABLE 1--- 
Paired-samples t-tests revealed no significant mean level differences between twins in 
a pair. Correlations (Table 2) showed stability in child disruptive behaviour over time, as well 
as positive associations between coercive parenting and disruptive behaviour. Coercive 
parenting was not associated with marital quality or coparenting. Correlations between 
marital quality and coparenting were large for both mothers and fathers, suggesting higher 
marital quality related to perceptions of higher quality coparenting. Marital quality and 
mother-reported coparenting did not correlate with child disruptive behaviour, although 
higher quality father-reported coparenting modestly related to lower levels of child disruptive 
behaviour at Time 1.  
---TABLE 2--- 
Multilevel Modelling (MLM) 
 
Table 3 presents our MLM results.     
---TABLE 3--- 
Model 1 estimated within- and between-family variance in child disruptive behaviour at Time 
3. The ICC, calculated as 0.74/(0.74+0.13)=0.85, suggested considerable twin similarity 
indicating that 85% of the variance in disruptive behaviour resided at the between-family 
level. Model 2 evidenced substantial behavioural stability over time (Δ-2LL=114.86, df=1, p 
<.005), explaining 68.92% ((0.74-0.23)/0.74) of the between-family variance and 7.69% 
((0.13-0.12)/0.13) of the within-family variance. Model 3 added child-specific (maternal and 
paternal differential coercive parenting) and between-family (maternal and paternal 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING

perceptions of marital quality, coercive parenting, and coparenting) predictors, significantly 
improving model fit (Δ-2LL=21.80, df=8, p<.010) and explaining an additional 4.05% ((0.23-
0.20)/0.74) of the between- and 7.69% ((0.12-0.11)/0.13) of the within-family variances. 
However, accounting for behavioural stability, no predictors were found to be significant. In 
Model 4, significant prediction of behaviour change was demonstrated from the between-
family level interaction term, maternal coparenting*overall coercive parenting. Comparing 
Model 4 with Model 3 shows a significant improvement to the fit of the model (Δ-
2LL=20.70, df=6, p<.005), with an additional 1.35% (0.20-0.19)/0.74) of the between- and 
7.69% ((0.11-0.10)/0.13) of the within-family variance explained.  
---FIGURE 1--- 
 
In order to interpret and illustrate the interaction, for simplicity we plotted simple 
slopes (Figure 1). The slope representing high maternal coparenting quality suggested a 
positive association (β=0.29, t=2.72, p=.008) between family-wide maternal coercive 
parenting and child disruptive behaviour at follow-up. There was no such association when 
mothers reported coparenting quality to be average (β =0.14, t=1.83, p=.071) or low (β=-0.02, 
t=-0.23, p=.820). We interpret these findings to suggest, contrary to expectation, that 
maternal perceptions of higher quality coparenting exacerbated the deleterious effects of her 
overall coercive parenting. 
 
Discussion 
The current study examined the interaction between coparenting and coercive parenting 
in the longitudinal prediction of children’s disruptive behaviour. In a UK sample of twins, we 
used conservative multilevel models to illuminate maternal and paternal child-specific and 
family-wide predictors. 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING

As expected, during the transition to school we found considerable stability in combined 
maternal-/paternal-reported child disruptive behaviour (Olson et al., 2009), with the majority 
of variance residing between families, indicating substantial twin similarity. The main effects 
for family-wide and child-specific predictors were not significant, however a significant 
interaction was found for maternal perceptions of coparenting and her overall coercive 
parenting. We discuss our results, before noting study limitations and future directions.  
 
Coparenting and coercive parenting: Interacting processes 
The direction of the interaction we illuminated was striking, and not anticipated. 
Although a scarce literature, two previous studies (Stright & Neitzel, 2003; Scrimgeour et al., 
2013) led us to expect that high quality coparenting would buffer children from coercive 
parenting in terms of their behavioural outcomes. Instead, we found that mothers’ perceptions 
of high quality coparenting exacerbated the association between her coercive parenting and 
the development of disruptive behaviour. 
We argue that coercive mothers’ perceptions of high quality coparenting—that is, having 
a partner who supports their parenting, makes them feel like a good parent and shares the 
same child-rearing values—may reflect a tacit family climate in which hostile interpersonal 
interactions are deemed acceptable. By explicitly—or implicitly—reinforcing, supporting or 
endorsing his coercive coparent, the father models tolerance of this interpersonal aggression. 
Moreover, in this climate, repetitive cycles of aversive parent-child interaction may be more 
likely, contributing to the development of disruptive behaviours (Patterson, 1982). In these 
ways, perceived ‘higher quality’ coparenting in the context of maternal coercion may be 
indicative of a cohesive ‘harsh parenting team’, the deleterious effects of which for child 
adjustment are greater than the sum of their parts. In contrast, where the mother reports low 
quality coparenting, the father may not support her coercive behaviours, indeed he may 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING 
12 
 
explicitly act in a way she perceives to be undermining (e.g., telling her to stop). 
Accordingly, this context may provide a buffer for child adjustment, since acceptance of 
coercive behaviours is not modelled, and may even be highlighted by the father as 
inappropriate. These interpretations emphasise the importance of the support, endorsement 
and undermining aspects of coparenting. Beyond the scope of this study using a brief 
measure of global coparenting quality, we encourage future research to explore interactions 
between coercive parenting and coparenting subscales to illuminate those most relevant.      
Although the current findings are retrospectively intuitive, they were not as we 
hypothesised on the basis of prior research (Stright & Neitzel, 2003; Scrimgeour et al., 2013).  
We highlight two primary differences between this work and our own that may be 
responsible for the distinctive direction of effects we find. 
First, both prior studies used independent observations of coparenting. Observation 
methods are commonly considered the ‘gold-standard’ for family research (Rasbash, Jenkins, 
O’Connor, Tackett, & Reiss, 2011), whereas the validity of parent report methods has been 
questioned (Holden & Edwards, 1989). However, for coparenting, these observations assess 
only visible behaviours, manifested when all relevant family members are present, thus 
potentially failing to capture aspects of coparenting that may be less explicit, or only 
exhibited in the absence of the coparent (McHale, Kuersten-Hogan, Lauretti, & Rasmussen, 
2000). In contrast, parent-reports of coparenting provide a measure of coparenting across 
contexts, which may be critical (Blandon, Scrimgeour, Stifter, & Buss, 2014). Further, we 
posit that coparent support, approval and appreciation of parenting efforts as perceived will 
likely provide stronger endorsement of one’s parenting than objective ratings can assess. 
These suppositions are supported by literatures demonstrating a role for perceptions over 
objective ratings (e.g., Acitelli et al., 1993). 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING 
13 
 
Second, the previous studies examined aspects of parenting—rejection of problem-
solving and inductive reasoning—that are distinct from ours. We are the first to investigate 
the interactive effects of coparenting and coercive parenting, one of the most prominent 
parenting constructs for children’s adjustment. Of interest, occurring at the family-wide level 
in our sample, the interaction contributed to sibling behavioural similarity, differentiating 
them from children in other families. This implies that, even accounting for child-specific 
parental treatment, mothers’ overall coercive parenting may have broad detrimental effects 
that are shared by siblings in the family when the coparenting quality is high. In other words, 
the potential for shared beneficial effects of high quality coparenting for child disruptive 
behaviour may depend on the overall quality of parenting itself. These findings are 
reminiscent of those indicating that the beneficial effects of father involvement for child 
conduct problems are dependent on the quality of parental care (Jaffee, Moffitt, Caspi, & 
Taylor, 2003). 
One important question is why paternal factors were not significant predictors of child 
disruptive behaviour. Our conservative model includes both parents examining the effect of 
paternal predictors over and above those of the mother. Although the role of the father is 
changing (Cabrera, Tamis-LeMonda, Bradley, Hofferth, & Lamb, 2000), even in two-parent 
families, fathers typically spend less time with their children compared to mothers (Craig & 
Powell, 2012; Lamb, 2004). Thus, our findings may reflect the greater salience of mothers’ 
coercive parenting (compared to fathers’) for children’s adjustment (Besnard et al., 2013; 
Rothbaum & Weisz, 1994). 
The current study capitalised on a twin sample to explore family-wide and child-specific 
effects of coparenting and coercive parenting. Although twins and singleton children have 
broadly comparable levels of disruptive behaviour (Moilanen et al., 1999; van den Oord, 
Koot, Boomsma, Verhulst, & Orlebeke, 1995), there has been no research comparing 
 RUNNING HEAD:  COPARENTING AND COERCIVE PARENTING 
14 
 
coparenting in twin and non-twin families. It is possible that coparenting, and its interaction 
with parenting, may be different—perhaps particularly important—in twin-families given 
their experience of greater parenting stress (Olivennes et al., 2005). This interesting question 
warrants future research. 
The current study has a number of strengths, including its longitudinal nature and the 
inclusion of both parents. However, our internal consistencies (particularly for father-reports) 
of coercive parenting are a little low. While this scale is adequate for the current hypothesis-
driven analysis, similar limitations have been noted elsewhere (Sanders et al., 2014), such 
that research to augment and replicate our novel work is recommended. Additionally, we 
were interested in coparenting within families headed by a mother and father; as such, 
caution is warranted in generalising to other family types, including to families of non-twins. 
We encourage colleagues to seek replication of our study with more detailed measures, 
within samples of socio-economic diversity, across family types, and in non-twin and twin-
sibling samples.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Utilising a novel sample and methodology, the current study makes an important 
contribution to understanding children’s disruptive behaviour, in addition to the so-far limited 
research exploring parenting and coparenting subsystems in the prediction of children’s 
adjustment. Specifically, for the first time, we highlight that the influence of high quality 
coparenting, previously assumed to be only beneficial, may be rather more complex. With 
replication and extension, our results are likely to have key implications for interventions 
focused on coparenting as a means to improve child adjustment, which have caught the eye of 
policy makers in recent years (Asmussen & Weizel, 2010), suggesting that they would be 
well-advised to consider parenting strategies concurrently.

effects of coparenting and coercive parenting and their interaction. 
� Mothers’ perceptions of coparenting moderated the association between overall 
coercive parenting and children’s disruptive behaviour development during 
school transition. 
� Mothers’ perception of high quality coparenting intensified the toxicity of her 
coercive parenting for children’s disruptive behaviour.     
� It is important to consider parenting and the coparenting context together, since a 
high quality coparenting team may not always be ideal for children’s adjustment.
