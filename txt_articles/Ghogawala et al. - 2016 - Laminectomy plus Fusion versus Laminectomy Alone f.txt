Characteristics of Operating Room 
Procedures in U.S. Hospitals, 2011 
 
Audrey J. Weiss, Ph.D., Anne Elixhauser, Ph.D., and Roxanne M. 
Andrews, Ph.D. 
 
Introduction 
 
Patients admitted to the hospital may undergo a variety of 
treatments, including medical therapy involving administration of 
medications, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (such as an X-
ray) that occur outside the operating room (OR), and major OR 
procedures (such as appendectomy).  Approximately 15 million 
hospital stays each year in the United States involve OR 
procedures.1  On average, hospital stays that involve an OR 
procedure have been reported to be 2.5 times more costly than 
stays that do not involve an OR procedure.2 
 
Identifying the volume, characteristics, and costs of OR 
procedures can help policymakers and researchers better 
understand population health and facilitate health care 
improvement efforts.  Changes in health care provider payment 
arrangements and advances in medical practice and technology 
can impact the nature of the procedures that are performed in 
hospital operating rooms.3  For example, some less complex 
surgical procedures, such as cataract surgery, that were once 
routinely performed in inpatient hospital operating rooms are now 
primarily performed in the ambulatory surgery setting.4 
 
This Statistical Brief presents data from the Healthcare Cost and 
Utilization Project (HCUP) on characteristics of OR procedures in 
2011.  For this Statistical Brief, OR procedures are defined using 
the HCUP procedure classes tool.5  In this tool, OR procedures 
are identified based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) that use 
physician panels to determine whether the procedure would be 
performed in a hospital OR in most hospitals.  The findings in this 
Statistical Brief represent an update to 2007 statistics reported by

Highlights 
■ In 2011, hospitalizations that 
involved operating room (OR) 
procedures constituted 29 
percent of the total 38.6 million 
hospital stays in the United 
States and 48 percent of the 
total $387 billion in hospital 
costs. 
■ Hospital stays that involved an 
OR procedure were about twice 
as costly as stays that did not 
involve an OR procedure. 
■ Compared with hospital stays 
that did not include an OR 
procedure, stays involving an 
OR procedure resulted in a 
longer length of stay, were more 
likely to be elective admissions, 
and were less likely to involve 
major or extreme severity of 
illness. 
■ Hospital stays involving OR 
procedures were about half as 
likely to result in patient death 
as were stays without an OR 
procedure.  
■ The 20 most common 
procedures accounted for more 
than half of all OR procedures.  
Cesarean section and 
circumcision were the most 
frequent OR procedures.  
Musculoskeletal procedures and 
cardiac procedures also 
accounted for a substantial 
portion of the most common OR 
procedures. 
■ Twenty procedures accounted 
for more than half of all costs for 
stays involving OR procedures.  
Spinal fusion, knee arthroplasty, 
and percutaneous coronary 
angioplasty (PTCA) were the 
procedures with the highest 
aggregate hospital costs.

Findings 
 
Characteristics of hospital stays involving operating room procedures, 2011 
In 2011, a total of 38.6 million hospital stays occurred in the United States at an aggregate cost of $387.2 
billion.  Of these, just over one-fourth of the stays (28.9 percent) and nearly half of the costs (47.9 
percent) involved hospitalizations during which OR procedures were performed (Figure 1).

Table 1 presents the patient characteristics for hospital stays with and without OR procedures.  The vast 
majority of these hospital stays occurred among adults aged 20–84 years (81.3% of stays involving OR 
procedures and 73.1% of stays without OR procedures).  Children (aged 0–19 years) and the elderly 
(aged 85 years and older) were less likely to undergo OR procedures.  Females accounted for just over 
half of hospital stays, with and without an OR procedure.  Among hospital stays involving an OR 
procedure, the most common expected primary payers were private insurance (41.3 percent of stays) and 
Medicare (34.0 percent).  For hospital stays that did not involve an OR procedure, Medicare was the most 
common primary payer (42.1 percent of stays).

Overall, hospital stays with OR procedures accounted for $185 billion and stays without OR procedures 
accounted for $202 billion (Table 2).  Hospital stays with OR procedures were twice as expensive as 
hospital stays without OR procedures in total costs (mean cost of $16,700 versus $7,400 per stay) and 
cost per day ($3,300 versus $1,700).

Hospital stays involving an OR procedure were longer than stays that did not involve an OR procedure 
(5.0 versus 4.4 days).  Elective hospital admission was more frequent for stays that involved an OR 
procedure (48.5 percent) than for stays without an OR procedure (13.4 percent).   
 
Hospital stays with an OR procedure were less likely to involve major or extreme severity of illness 
compared with stays that did not involve an OR procedure (23.7 versus 34.7 percent of stays).  Patients 
with an OR procedure were half as likely to die in the hospital compared with those who did not have an 
OR procedure (1.1 versus 2.2 percent).

Most frequent and costly types of operating room procedures, 2011 
Table 3 provides the top 20 most frequent all-listed OR procedures.  Together, these 20 procedures 
accounted for more than half (54.0 percent) of the 15.7 million OR procedures performed in 2011.  
Cesarean section and circumcision were the most common OR procedures, accounting for more than 8 
percent and 7 percent of all OR procedures, respectively.  Five musculoskeletal procedures—knee 
arthroplasty, laminectomy, spinal fusion, hip replacement, and treatment of hip or lower extremity fracture 
or dislocation—together accounted for about 17 percent of all OR procedures.  Four cardiac 
procedures—percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cardiac 
device-related procedures, and heart valve procedures—together accounted for another 7 percent of all 
OR procedures.

Six of the top 20 OR procedures with the highest aggregate hospital costs were musculoskeletal 
procedures: spinal fusion (7.1 percent of aggregate costs for stays with OR procedures), knee 
arthroplasty (6.3 percent), hip replacement (4.4 percent), treatment of hip fracture (2.4 percent), 
laminectomy (1.3 percent), and treatment of other lower extremity fracture (1.2 percent).   
 
Four heart-related procedures were among the top 20 OR procedures with the highest aggregate costs: 
PTCA (5.4 percent of costs for stays with OR procedures), CABG (3.6 percent), heart valve procedures 
(3.4 percent), and pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator procedures (2.2 percent).  Among the 20 OR 
procedures with the highest aggregate hospital costs, heart valve procedures and CABG had the highest 
mean costs per hospital stay ($53,400 and $38,700, respectively). 
 
Two childbirth and delivery-related procedures (Cesarean section and circumcision) were also in the top 
20 OR procedures with the highest aggregate costs, accounting for 4.1 percent and 1.0 percent of costs 
for stays with OR procedures. 
 
Four gastrointestinal procedures were in the top 20: colorectal resection (3.7 percent of aggregate 
inpatient costs for stays with OR procedures), cholecystectomy (2.8 percent), appendectomy (1.4 
percent), and small bowel resection (1.3 percent).

Data Source  
 
The estimates in this Statistical Brief are based upon data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project (HCUP) 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).  Supplemental sources included 
population denominator data for use with HCUP databases.7  
 
Many hypothesis tests were conducted for this Statistical Brief.  Thus, to decrease the number of 
false-positive results, we reduced the significance level to .0001 for individual tests.  
 
Definitions  
 
Procedures, ICD-9-CM, and Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) 
All-listed procedures include all procedures performed during the hospital stay, whether for definitive 
treatment or for diagnostic or exploratory purposes.  The first-listed procedure is the procedure that is 
listed first on the discharge record.  Inpatient data define this as the “principal procedure”—the procedure 
that is performed for definitive treatment rather than for diagnostic or exploratory purposes (i.e., the 
procedure that was necessary to take care of a complication).  ICD-9-CM is the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, which assigns numeric codes to 
procedures.  There are about 4,000 ICD-9-CM procedure codes. 
 
CCS categorizes procedure codes into clinically meaningful categories.8  This "clinical grouper" makes it 
easier to quickly understand patterns of procedure use.  CCS categories identified as “Other” typically are 
not reported; these categories include miscellaneous, otherwise unclassifiable procedures that may be 
difficult to interpret as a group.  In addition, procedure categories that are nonspecific or likely to be 
adjuncts to other procedures (e.g., excision, lysis peritoneal adhesions; partial bone excision; 
intraoperative cholangiogram) are not included in the listings of specific procedures in Tables 3 and 4. 
 
Major operating room (OR) procedures were defined using procedure classes, which categorize each 
ICD-9-CM procedure code as either major therapeutic, major diagnostic, minor therapeutic, or minor 
diagnostic.9  Major OR procedures are considered to be valid OR procedures based on diagnosis-related 
groups (DRGs).  This classification scheme relies upon physician panels that classify ICD-9-CM 
procedure codes according to whether the procedure would be performed in a hospital operating room in 
most hospitals.   
 
Types of hospitals included in HCUP  
HCUP is based on data from community hospitals, which are defined as short-term, non-Federal, general, 
and other hospitals, excluding hospital units of other institutions (e.g., prisons).  HCUP data include 
obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedic, cancer, pediatric, public, and academic medical 
hospitals.  Excluded are long-term care, rehabilitation, psychiatric, and alcoholism and chemical 
dependency hospitals.  However, if a patient received long-term care, rehabilitation, or treatment for 
psychiatric or chemical dependency conditions in a community hospital, the discharge record for that stay 
will be included in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). 
 
Unit of analysis 
The unit of analysis is the hospital discharge (i.e., the hospital stay), not a person or patient.  This means 
that a person who is admitted to the hospital multiple times in one year will be counted each time as a 
separate "discharge" from the hospital.

Total hospital charges were converted to costs using HCUP Cost-to-Charge Ratios based on hospital 
accounting reports from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).10  Costs will reflect the 
actual expenses incurred in the production of hospital services, such as wages, supplies, and utility costs; 
charges represent the amount a hospital billed for the case.  For each hospital, a hospital-wide cost-to-
charge ratio is used.  Hospital charges reflect the amount the hospital billed for the entire hospital stay 
and do not include professional (physician) fees.  For the purposes of this Statistical Brief, costs are 
reported to the nearest hundred. 
 
Aggregate costs are calculated using aggregate charges.  Aggregate charges include discharges with 
missing or invalid charges that are imputed by taking the mean charges for all discharges of the same 
diagnosis-related group (DRG) with nonmissing charges.  Fewer than 2 percent of cases are missing 
charges in HCUP data.  Mean costs are calculated using only discharges with nonmissing and valid 
charges.  Because of the manner in which missing charges are imputed to calculate aggregate charges, 
simple calculation of the number of discharges multiplied by the mean cost will not always equal the 
aggregate costs.  
 
Payer 
Payer is the expected primary payer for the hospital stay.  To make coding uniform across all HCUP data 
sources, payer combines detailed categories into general groups:  
– Medicare: includes patients covered by fee-for-service and managed care Medicare  
– Medicaid: includes patients covered by fee-for-service and managed care Medicaid  
– Private Insurance: includes Blue Cross, commercial carriers, and private health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) 
– Other: includes Worker's Compensation, TRICARE/CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, Title V, and other 
government programs 
– Uninsured: includes an insurance status of "self-pay" and "no charge.” 
 
Encounters billed to the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) may be classified as 
Medicaid, Private Insurance, or Other, depending on the structure of the State program.  Because most 
State data do not identify SCHIP patients specifically, it is not possible to present this information 
separately. 
 
When more than one payer is listed for a hospital discharge, the first-listed payer is used. 
 
Patient complexity 
Cases with the highest severity of illness are discharges with a score of 3 or 4 on the All Patient Refined 
DRG (APR-DRG) severity of illness scale.  The four severity of illness subclasses are numbered 
sequentially from 1 to 4 indicating minor, moderate, major, or extreme severity of illness.  The 
determination of severity of illness is disease specific.  Thus, the significance attributed to complicating or 
comorbid conditions is dependent on the underlying problem.  For example, certain types of infections are 
considered a more significant problem in a patient who is immunosuppressed than in a patient with a 
fractured arm.  In APR-DRGs, high severity of illness is primarily determined by the interaction of multiple 
diseases.  Patients with multiple comorbid conditions involving multiple organ systems represent difficult-
to-treat patients who tend to have poor outcomes.  The assignment of a patient to a severity of illness 
subclass takes into consideration not only the level of the secondary diagnoses but also the interaction 
among secondary diagnoses, age, principal diagnosis, and the presence of certain operating room and 
nonoperating room procedures.

About the NIS 
 11 
 
 
The HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) is a nationwide database of hospital inpatient stays.  The 
NIS is nationally representative of all community hospitals (i.e., short-term, non-Federal, nonrehabilitation 
hospitals).  The NIS is a sample of hospitals and includes all patients from each hospital, regardless of 
payer.  It is drawn from a sampling frame that contains hospitals comprising more than 95 percent of all 
discharges in the United States.  The vast size of the NIS allows the study of topics at both the national 
and regional levels for specific subgroups of patients.  In addition, NIS data are standardized across 
years to facilitate ease of use.
