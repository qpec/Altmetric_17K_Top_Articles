Abstract
Importance—Marijuana use may alter ventral striatal response to reward, which may heighten 
susceptibility to substance use disorder (SUD). Cross-sectional studies have reported either 
increased ventral striatal response to reward or no difference in marijuana users compared with 
controls. Longitudinal research is needed to resolve the inconsistencies and disentangle preexisting 
susceptibility from the effects of marijuana use on neural function involved in reward responding.
Objective—To determine whether marijuana use among young adults prospectively impacts 
nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation during reward anticipation.
Design—Longitudinal study of self-report marijuana use and brain function using functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at three consecutive time points.
Setting—Data were obtained from young adult participants in the Michigan Longitudinal Study, 
an ongoing, prospective study of youth at high risk for SUD and a contrast sample of control 
families.
Participants—The sample consisted of 108 young adults (36% female; 78% family history of 
SUD) who underwent three fMRI scans at approximately age 20 (time 1), 22 (time 2), and 24 
(time 3).
Main Outcome and Measures—We investigated the impact of marijuana use on neural 
response in the NAcc to reward anticipation during a monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) using

 a cross-lagged model. Covariates for analyses included sex, age at first scan, family history of 
SUD, prior marijuana use, and binge drinking (prior and concurrent). This model was also tested 
separately with the inclusion of cigarette smoking.
Results—Greater marijuana use was associated with later blunted activation in the NAcc during 
reward anticipation (time 1 to time 2: β=−0.26, P=0.04; time 2 to time 3: β=−0.25, P=0.01). When 
we tested the cross-lagged model with the inclusion of prior and concurrent cigarette use, the 
impact of marijuana use from time 2 to time 3 remained significant and the effect of cigarette use 
was non-significant.
Conclusions and Relevance—Our findings indicate that marijuana use is associated with 
decreased neural response in the NAcc during the anticipation of non-drug rewards. Over time, 
marijuana use may alter anticipatory reward processing in the NAcc, which may increase risk for 
continued drug use and later addiction.

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States, with use 
especially prevalent among young adults1. Marijuana use typically emerges during 
adolescence, peaking in the early 20s, with 35% of 21- and 22- year-olds reporting past year 
use2. This pervasiveness may be due to low perceptions of harm2, despite the short- and 
long-term negative consequences3 of marijuana. Short-term consequences may include acute 
anxiety, paranoia, and altered perception4, as well as impaired motor coordination while 
driving5. Deficits in academic achievement6 and disrupted brain structure and function7–10 
suggest long-term negative consequences of marijuana use. Of particular relevance to this 
study is evidence that earlier marijuana use onset leads to a faster transition to marijuana 
dependence11 and increases risk of developing other substance use disorders (SUDs)12.
Marijuana’s psychoactive properties are due largely to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
THC binds to CB1 cannabinoid neural receptors and stimulates the transmission of 
dopamine from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the 
ventral striatum (VS), a region involved in reward-driven behavior, including substance 
use13–15. A recent positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated reduced 
reactivity of this system in chronic marijuana users during extracellular dopamine 
stimulation, which was correlated with greater addiction severity and craving16. This is 
consistent with theories positing that with chronic use, the incentive salience of cues that 
predict receipt of the drug strengthens, likely at the expense of rewards not associated with 
that drug—an effect believed to contribute to the development and maintenance of 
problematic substance use17–19. Thus, marijuana use may cause a perturbation of the 
dopaminergic reward system, thereby increasing risk for developing marijuana and other 
SUDs.
A number of cross-sectional studies have investigated the impact of marijuana use on non-
drug reward responding during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the 
monetary incentive delay task (MIDT)20–22. Monetary reward anticipation during the MIDT

 reliably and robustly activates the VS, including the NAcc. Some studies report that 
marijuana users show increased activation of the VS to monetary reward anticipation 
compared to non-users23,24, whereas others have found no differences25–27. Cross-sectional 
studies, however, may be unable to disentangle differences in activation due to preexisting 
neural susceptibilities compared to altered neural function as a result of marijuana use. 
Increased NAcc activation to reward anticipation has been linked to behavioral traits 
associated with substance use risk22, 28–30 and prospectively associated with later substance 
use problems21. Thus, longitudinal studies that account for preexisting susceptibilities are 
needed to more clearly identify the cumulative impact of marijuana use on neural 
mechanisms underlying reward responsivity.
To address this gap, the present study examined cross-lagged, prospective associations 
between marijuana use and NAcc activation to monetary reward anticipation. fMRI during 
the MIDT was conducted at three time points—average ages of 20, 22, and 24—that 
coincide with the normative peak of marijuana use2. Consistent with prior evidence 
supporting attenuated dopamine release in the VS among heavy marijuana users16 and 
reduced incentive salience for non-drug rewards17,18 in chronic substance users, we 
hypothesized that greater marijuana use would be associated with later decreases in NAcc 
activation to monetary reward anticipation, beyond possible cofounding influences.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 108 young adults recruited from the Michigan Longitudinal Study, an 
ongoing, prospective study of youth from families with high levels of SUD and a contrast 
sample of families without SUD31. 77.78% of participants were categorized as high risk, 
based on parental history of SUD, which was ascertained by a clinical psychologist using the 
Diagnostic Interview Schedule—Version 4 (DIS-IV)32. Exclusionary criteria are in 
eMethods of the Supplement. No minimum levels of marijuana use were required for 
inclusion in the present study. All eligible participants were assessed for psychosocial 
functioning at 3-year intervals and substance use and problems beginning annually at age 11. 
Additional details on MLS assessment and data collection protocol are provided 
elsewhere31,33. Participants completed three consecutive scans at approximately 2-year 
intervals. The present study was reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan 
Medical School Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed 
consent. Table 1 displays participant characteristics including race/ethnicity and sex.
Substance Use Assessment
Substance use was assessed annually using the Drinking and Drug History questionnaire34. 
Past year marijuana use was measured by the number of days during the past year that 
participants reported using marijuana or hashish. Past year binge drinking was measured by 
number of days during the past year that participants reported drinking ≥5 standard alcoholic 
drinks. Past year cigarette use was measured by the number of days participants reported 
smoking cigarettes during the past year. For each substance, "prior" use was the number of

 days of use from age 11 through the year prior to time 1. Substance use means and 
percentages are shown in Table 1.
fMRI Paradigm
To assess neural response during anticipation of monetary reward, participants performed a 
modified version of the MIDT20–22. Each trial began with an incentive cue indicating 
whether they could win or lose a small ($0.20) or large $5.00) monetary reward or whether 
no money was at stake (cue). A fixation cross then appeared (anticipation), followed by a 
variable-duration target. Pressing the button while the target was on the screen signified a 
correct response. After each trial, participants were shown feedback indicating whether they 
pressed the button quickly enough (outcome). Additional details are provided in eMethods 
of the Supplement.
fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis
Whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) images were acquired on a 3.0T GE 
Signa scanner (GE Healthcare) using a T2*-weighted single-shot combined spiral in/out 
sequence (repetition time [TR]=2000 ms; echo time [TE]=30 ms; flip angle=90°; field of 
view [FOV]=200 mm; 64×64 matrix; in plane resolution=3.12×3.12 mm; slice thickness=4 
mm)34. In addition, a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted scan was obtained (TR=25 
ms; minimum TE; FOV=25 cm; 256×256 matrix; slice thickness=1.4 mm). Image 
processing and individual-level analyses are described in eMethods of the Supplement.
The present report focuses on the contrast between anticipation during monetary gain trials 
and neutral trials (i.e., “reward anticipation”). Contrasts for small and large gains were 
estimated separately. Given problems associated with circularity of statistical inference when 
defining volumes of interest based on observed contrast activation36, and considering the 
present study’s a priori interest in the NAcc, anatomical masks of the left and right NAcc 
were created as described previously22,28 using the Build ROI function in MarsBaR37 
(eFigure 1). Contrasts for small and large gains were then linearly combined and averaged 
across hemispheres. Associations between incentive amount and hemisphere in NAcc 
volume are described in eMethods of the Supplement. We previously reported acceptable 
reliability of NAcc activation across sessions21.
Cross-Lagged Model Analysis
To examine longitudinal associations between marijuana use and NAcc activation during 
monetary reward anticipation, cross-lagged analyses were conducted using robust maximum 
likelihood estimation in Mplus version 7.238. Log transformations was performed to 
improve the normality of the marijuana use variable (transformed variable skewness: time 
1=1.56; time 2=1.62; time 3=1.83; transformed variable kurtosis: time 1=1.42; time 2=1.30; 
time 3=1.82). Cross-lagged analyses included across-time stability coefficients for marijuana 
use and NAcc activation, within-time associations between marijuana use and NAcc 
activation, and across-time cross-lagged paths between marijuana use and NAcc activation.
Covariates were sex, age at time 1, parental history of SUD, prior marijuana use and binge 
drinking, and past year binge drinking. Age at time 1 was included to control for the range in

 ages (18–24 years old) at the initial scan. Parental history of SUD was included to control 
for heightened substance use risk39. Due to evidence suggesting an impact of onset and 
duration of marijuana use on brain structure and function3,7, we accounted for prior 
marijuana use. We also accounted for prior and past year binge drinking, given the high 
comorbidity between marijuana and alcohol use40–42. Because marijuana use is also 
comorbid with cigarette smoking41 and some studies suggest that nicotine use may reduce 
the impact of THC on NAcc response to non-drug reward anticipation43,44, we tested an 
additional analytic model that included prior and past year cigarette use as covariates. The 
following parameters determined adequate model fit: non-significant chi-square, a root mean 
square error of approximation (RMSEA) below 0.06, and a comparative fit index (CFI) and 
Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) of 0.95 or higher45. Signficant pathways were established based 
on α = 0.05.
To allow comparison with prior cross-sectional studies23–25,27, we also investigated 
associations between Time 1 NAcc activation and prior marijuana use and age at first use 
using partial correlations, controlling for prior binge drinking and cigarette use.
Results
Task Performance
Reaction times and accuracy data are provided in eResults and eTable 1 of the Supplement. 
Partial correlations were conducted to test associations between marijuana use and task 
performance, controlling for sex, age at time 1, parental history of SUD, prior marijuana use 
and binge drinking, and co-occurring past year binge drinking. No significant (α = 0.05) 
partial correlations were found between marijuana use and task performance (eTable 2). 
Participants showed robust VS activation at each time during reward anticipation (eFigure 
2).
Marijuana–NAcc Cross-Lagged Associations
Partial correlations found no association between NAcc activation at time 1 and prior 
marijuana use (r=0.10, P=0.48) and a trend for a negative correlation between age of first 
marijuana use and NAcc activation at time 1 (r=−0.23, P=0.07). The cross-lagged model 
showed excellent model fit and significant cross-lagged paths between marijuana use and 
blunted NAcc activation during monetary reward anticipation (Figure 1). Past year marijuana 
use at time 1 negatively predicted NAcc activation at time 2, with no covariates reaching 
significance. Past year marijuana use at time 2 negatively predicted NAcc activation at time 
3, with significant covariates of prior marijuana use (β=0.31, P=0.007) and prior binge 
drinking (β=−0.17, P=0.01). Stability coefficients were significant for past year marijuana 
use (time 1–2: β=0.48, P=0.000; time 2–3: β=0.76, P=0.000) and for NAcc activation (time 
1–2: β=0.26, P=0.003; time 2–3: β=0.35, P=0.000). A graphical representation of cross-
lagged results is shown in Figure 2. Testing positive for marijuana use but reporting 
abstinence within 48 hours prior to each scan did not greatly impact findings (eResults).
A cross-lagged model including prior and past year cigarette use also fit well (χ2=14.53, 
P=0.27, RMSEA=0.04, CFI=0.99, TLI=0.94). Stability coefficients were significant for past

 year marijuana use (time 1–2: β=0.44, P=0.003; time 2–3: β=0.73, P=0.000) and NAcc 
activation (time 1–2: β=0.27, P=0.002 and time 2–3 and β=0.36, P=0.000). The negative 
association between time 2 marijuana use and time 3 NAcc activation remained significant 
(β=−0.29, P=0.005) with significant covariates of prior marijuana use (β=0.42, P=0.001) and 
prior binge drinking (β=−0.17, P=0.008), however the association between time 1 marijuana 
use and time 2 NAcc activation was only marginally significant (β=−0.24, P=0.07), with no 
covariates reaching significance. Pearson correlations were examined between marijuana use 
and other substances of interest included in cross-lagged analyses (eTable 3).
Discussion
The present study is the first to report longitudinal associations between marijuana use and 
NAcc activation during a non-drug reward anticipation task. We found a significant, 
prospective relationship between marijuana use and decreased NAcc activation to monetary 
reward anticipation. Our findings indicate that continued marijuana use may result in a 
blunted NAcc response to non-drug rewards, even when controlling for prior and co-
occuring substance use. Importantly, the model also controlled for potential risk factors, 
such as familial risk for SUD and baseline differences in NAcc activation. This work 
provides robust evidence that marijuana use has long-term associations with anticipatory 
reward processing.
While existing studies have shown increased NAcc activation to monetary reward 
anticipation among marijuana users23,24 or no significant differences from controls25–27, we 
found decreased NAcc activation over time. Prior cross-sectional studies may not have been 
able to account for preexisting differences in NAcc activation that predisposed certain 
individuals toward engaging in reward seeking behavior, such as substance use. At time 1, 
we found a trend for an association between greater NAcc activation and earlier age of use 
onset, but no association with amount of use, supporting the view that heightened reward 
system activation represents a risk factor for use rather than a consequence. Using 
prospective, cross-lagged analyses, we isolated the relation between marijuana use and later 
NAcc function more directly, while accounting for baseline NAcc activation at time 1. 
Findings indicate that continued marijuana use impacts anticipatory reward processing, 
while preexisting differences in NAcc function were not associated with later marijuana use. 
Given that the baseline measurement in this study was conducted in young adulthood, future 
prospective studies at earlier ages may more clearly detect preexisting striatal risk related to 
continued marijuana use on reward responsivity.
Finding a prospective relationship between marijuana use and decreased NAcc activation to 
monetary reward supports a mechanism through which marijuana use may lead to enhanced 
vulnerability to SUD. Although early substance use involves voluntary decisions to use, our 
findings support the view that repeated consumption produces long-term alterations in neural 
circuits involved in reward processing, which may in turn contribute to drug seeking 
behavior and compulsive use19. One possibility is that effects of chronic marijuana use on 
these neural systems results in a general blunting of reward responding. This may lead to 
further drug use in an attempt to counteract insufficient reward responsivity, consistent with 
the reward deficiency theory of addiction46. We did not observe an association between

 NAcc response to monetary reward and later marijuana use. While a direct, robust 
association may not exist between these factors, repeated marijuana use may result in a bias 
toward marijuana and marijuana-associated cues relative to non-marijuana cues. Repeated 
stimulation of mesolimbic neural circuits during marijuana use may sensitize this circuitry to 
attribute greater salience to stimuli paired with marijuana use47. This bias toward marijuana 
cues may contribute to repeated marijuana use and an increased risk for addiction. To test 
this theory, it will be necessary for future studies to prospectively examine neural response 
to both marijuana-associated and non-drug reward cues over time.
An additional possibility is that blunted reward system responding in marijuana users is 
associated with general anhedonia, which may maintain substance use. This may be a more 
marijuana-specific association, given that endogenous cannabinoids have been shown to be 
involved in regulating emotional responses48, and animal work has demonstrated a link 
between exposure to exogenous cannabinoids and depressive phenotypes49,50. Marijuana 
may be used to cope with dysregulated mood, and continued marijuana use may alter neural 
systems involved in mood and emotion (e.g., dopaminergic reward system). Attenuated 
striatal reactivity to dopamine stimulation in marijuana abusers has been shown to correlate 
with negative emotionality16, which is also supported by our prior work demonstrating a 
prospective relationship between marijuana use and greater negative emotionality51.
Given the high incidence of polysubstance use41 and that all drugs of abuse impact 
dopamine levels in the NAcc13–15, we accounted for potentially confounding substance use. 
For example, there is evidence that heavy alcohol use may blunt NAcc activation to reward 
anticipation52,53. We found an impact of chronic marijuana use on anticipatory reward 
processing when controlling for potential effects of prior and co-occuring binge drinking. 
Thus, marijuana use may have a specific influence on NAcc response above and beyond that 
of heavy alcohol use. Interestingly, cumulative marijuana use and binge drinking prior to 
time 1 had a significant impact on NAcc activation at time 3 but not at time 2. This was 
likely due to the more proximal influence of marijuana use at time 1 accounting for a large 
degree of the variance of time 2 NAcc activation, resulting in less unexplained variance to be 
accounted for by prior marijuana use and binge drinking. In contrast, there may have been 
more unexplained variance to be accounted for by prior marijuana use and binge drinking at 
time 2 given the weaker correlation (see eTable 3).
Due to prior work showing blunted NAcc during monetary reward anticipation among 
marijuana users who also use cigarettes43,44, we tested a cross-lagged model that included 
cigarette use. The association between marijuana use at Time 1 and later NAcc activation 
was reduced to trend-level, whereas the association between marijuana use at Time 2 and 
later NAcc activation remained significant. This difference in the impact of cigarette use on 
the model over time is likely due to a higher correlation between marijuana and cigarette use 
at time 1 than time 2 (r=0.42 and r=0.25, respectively; see eTable 3). However, no significant 
effects of prior or co-occuring cigarette use on NAcc activation were observed at any time 
point. Our findings suggest that reduced NAcc activation was not being driven by nicotine 
effects on endocannabinoid modulation of the NAcc43. More specific cross-lagged, group 
comparisons between marijuana, cigarette, and combined marijuana and cigarette users may

 further disentangle the relation between marijuana and nicotine on anticipatory reward 
processing.
Limitations
The binge drinking threshold was ≥5 standard alcoholic drinks for both men and women, 
which is greater than the typical cut-off of ≥4 drinks for women54. Our findings may also 
have limited generalizability to other groups, given that our sample consisted predominately 
of White and high-risk (defined by family history of SUD) youth. Yet, in many ways this 
was an appropriate sample, given that both White youth2 and youth with a family history of 
SUD39 tend to show high levels of substance use. Finally, early versus late marijuana use 
onset could be an important moderator, but we did not have an adequate number of early 
onset marijuana users to test for such differences. Future studies with larger sample sizes 
should examine whether these associations differ across age of marijuana use onset.
Conclusions
The present study provides evidence for the longitudinal impact of marijuana use on NAcc 
functioning during monetary reward anticipation. In light of the rise in marijuana use rates 
coupled with decreasing perceptions of harm2, this study provides important and novel 
information pertaining to the long-term influence of marijuana use on brain mechanisms 
underlying addiction. Educating youth about the impact of marijuana on this neural circuitry 
and its potential downstream consequences on addiction vulnerability may help improve 
efforts to prevent the initiation and escalation of marijuana use. Such efforts may dispel the 
notion that marijuana use produces no lasting neural influences and may elucidate the 
potential harms associated with this substance.

Longitudinal Cross-Lagged Associations Between Marijuana Use and Nucleus Accumbens 
(NAcc) Activation During Reward Anticipation
Results are shown from cross-lagged analysis of past year marijuana use at each scan date 
and NAcc activation during reward anticipation. Coefficients are standardized path 
coefficients, with covariates of sex, age at time 1, parental history of substance use disorder, 
prior marijuana use and binge drinking up to 12 months prior to time 1, and past year binge 
drinking corresponding to each time (covariances of exogenous variables are not depicted to 
improve readability). Straight single-headed arrows represent causal paths; Curved double-
headed arrows represent covariances.
Indices of model fit: χ2=8.94, P=0.35, RMSEA=0.03, CFI=0.99, TLI=0.97 *P<0.05, 
**P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
