pain was associated with a 62% increased odds of recurrent 
falls. Those with moderate and severe foot pain showed in-
creased odds of  
≥ 
2 falls (OR 1.78, CI 1.06–2.99, and OR 3.25, 
CI 1.65–7.48, respectively) compared to those with no foot 
pain. Foot function was not associated with falls. Compared 
to normal foot posture, those with planus foot posture had 
78% higher odds of  
≥ 
2 falls.  
Conclusion: Higher odds of re-
current falls were observed in individuals with foot pain, es-
pecially severe foot pain, as well as in individuals with planus 
foot posture, indicating that both foot pain and foot posture 
may play a role in increasing the risk of falls among older 
adults.

Introduction 
 
More than 30% of individuals over the age of 65 years 
fall at least once a year. This figure increases to over 40% 
for persons aged 75 years and older  
[1] 
. Among older 
adults, falls are a common cause of injury  
[2] 
, related hos-
pitalizations  
[3] 
, and even death  
[4] 
. Moreover, fear of 
falling, often resulting from past falls, has been shown to 
heighten activity avoidance behaviors  
[5] and may nega-

Abstract 
 
Background: Although foot pain has been linked to fall risk, 
contributions of pain severity, foot posture, or foot function 
are unclear. These factors were examined in a cohort of old-
er adults.  
Objective: The purpose of this study was to exam-
ine the associations of foot pain, severity of foot pain, and 
measures of foot posture and dynamic foot function with 
reported falls in a large, well-described cohort of older adults 
from the Framingham Foot Study.  
Methods: 
 Foot pain, pos-
ture, and function were collected from Framingham Foot 
Study participants who were queried about falls over the 
past year (0, 1, and  
≥ 
2 falls). Logistic regression was used to 
calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the relation of falls with foot pain, pain severity, foot 
posture, and foot function adjusting for covariates.  
Results: 
The mean age of the 1,375 participants was 69 years; 57% 
were female, and 21% reported foot pain (40% mild pain, 
47% moderate pain, and 13% severe pain). One-third report-
ed falls in the past year (1 fall:  
n 
 = 263,  
≥ 
2 falls:  
n 
 = 152). Foot

tively impact physical activity levels and quality of life. In 
addition to these effects, treatment for fall-related injuries 
imposes a large and rising economic cost as the elderly 
population in the US is projected to increase  
[6] 
. 
 
The increasing risk of falls is multifactorial, with many 
interacting factors ranging from age  
[7] and balance im-
pairment  
[8] to psychological and environmental factors 
 
[1] 
. Foot pain has become an area of potential interest in 
falls outcomes. Foot pain is highly prevalent with popu-
lation-based research indicating that 24–30%  
[9–12] of 
older adults report foot pain. Moreover, foot pain may 
have an impact upon overall health. Studies have linked 
foot pain to worse self-reported health status  
[11] 
, im-
paired balance  
[13] 
, and worse physical function  
[14–16] 
. 
Several studies have also found that foot problems  
[1] and 
foot pain  
[17] are associated with increased odds of falling 
among older adults.
 
While foot pain has been linked to functional impair-
ments and risk of falls, no studies have evaluated the im-
pact of foot pain on falls in a population-based sample of 
adults. Furthermore, to our knowledge, only 1 study  
[15] 
has examined the role of dynamic foot function upon falls 
in older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was 
to examine the associations of foot pain, severity of foot 
pain, and measures of foot posture and dynamic foot 
function with reported falls in a large, well-described co-
hort of older adults from the Framingham Foot Study. 
We hypothesized that foot pain and the categories of non-
normal foot measures would be associated with occur-
rence of falls and number of falls. 
 
Methods 
 
Participants 
 
Participants were from the population-based Framingham 
Foot Study (2002–2008)  
[18] 
, a study of community-dwelling, am-
bulatory adults residing in and around the town of Framingham, 
MA, USA, derived from members of the Framingham Heart 
Study’
s Original and Offspring Cohorts  
[19, 20] 
. The Framingham 
Foot Study has been approved by the Boston University and He-
brew SeniorLife Institutional Review Boards, and participants pro-
vided written, informed consent prior to enrollment. Participants 
with data on foot pain and falls within 1 year of the Foot Study 
exam were included in this cross-sectional analysis.
 
Assessment of Foot Pain  
 
Presence of foot pain was determined at the Foot Study visit in 
response to an NHANES-type question: “On most days do you 
have pain, aching, or stiffness in either of your feet?” Responses 
were categorized as “Yes, pain in one or both feet” or “No, no pain 
in either foot.” Participants who reported foot pain were then 
asked to categorize the severity of pain in the affected foot as mild, 
moderate, or severe. If pain in both feet was reported, the foot with 
the most severe pain was used in the analysis.
 
Falls Ascertainment 
 
Falls data were collected at the core Framingham Study visit as 
whether a participant fell in the past year (yes/no). The core Fram-
ingham Study visit typically occurred on the same day as the Foot 
Study visit, or for a small proportion within 1 year of their Foot 
Study exam. If a participant reported falling in the past year, they 
were then asked how many times they had fallen. Number of falls 
was categorized into 3 groups: no falls (zero in the past year), single 
fall, or recurrent falls for those who reported falling  
≥ 
2 times in the 
past year. For analysis, we examined falls in 2 ways: first, as any falls 
(yes or no); secondly, as no fall, single reported fall, or  
≥ 
2 (recur-
rent) reported falls.
 
Foot Posture and Dynamic Foot Function 
 
A Tekscan MatScan foot pressure mat was used to collect plan-
tar pressure scans during quiet standing and also while walking at 
a self-selected pace as reported previously  
[21] 
. Foot posture was 
derived from the modified arch index (MAI) which was calculated 
using the quiet standing scans as previously described  
[21] 
. Briefly, 
the pressure in the middle third of the foot is divided by the total 
pressure under the foot. Foot posture was categorized into 3 groups 
using sex-specific quintiles of the MAI: planus, normal, and cavus. 
Dynamic foot function was estimated from the center of pressure 
excursion index (CPEI), a measure of the medial shift of the center 
of pressure when walking  
[22, 23] 
. Foot function was categorized 
into 3 groups using sex-specific quintiles of the CPEI: pronated, 
normal, and supinated. 
 
Covariates 
 
Covariates in our analyses included age, body mass index 
(BMI), and cohort of origin. Age in years was recorded at the foot 
examination. Also at this time, participants’
 height and weight 
were measured and used to calculate BMI (kg/m 
2 
). Height was ob-
tained using a calibrated stadiometer and rounded to the nearest 
quarter inch. Weight was measured with a balance beam scale and 
rounded to the nearest half pound. To account for any cohort dif-
ferences within the Framingham Study, we created a dichotomous 
variable for cohort origin (Framingham Original Cohort or Off-
spring Cohort).
 
Statistical Methods 
 
Characteristics of the study sample were examined by the fall 
groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the relation of 
foot pain, foot posture, and foot function with falls outcomes. Ad-
ditionally, we examined the relation between severity of foot pain 
and falls. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, BMI, and 
cohort origin (Framingham Original Cohort or Offspring Cohort).

40–50 years, 22% were aged 51–60 years, and 76% were 
aged 61 years and older) and a mean BMI of 28, and 57% 
were female. Twenty-one percent ( 
n = 283) of partici-
pants reported foot pain, aching, or stiffness on most 
days. Among those reporting pain, 113 (40%) indicated 
mild foot pain, while 134 (47%) and 36 (13%) reported 
having moderate or severe foot pain, respectively ( 
Ta-
ble 1 
). Nearly one-third of the participants ( 
n = 415) re-
ported having fallen in the last year. Of those who fell, 263 
participants fell once, and 152 reported falling  
≥ 
2 times. 
Four participants who reported falling did not indicate a 
number of falls, and thus were not considered in the anal-
yses of recurrent fallers. Of the study participants, 250 
were missing foot posture and dynamic foot function 
measures. Thus, analyses of foot posture and dynamic 
foot function included the subset of 1,125 participants. 
 
Foot Pain and Falls 
 
After adjusting for age, BMI, and cohort, there was no 
association with any falls in the past year for those with 
foot pain compared to those without foot pain (OR 1.08, 
95% CI 0.81–1.44). However, there was a 62% increased 
odds of recurrent falls (95% CI 1.10–2.39) for participants 
with foot pain compared to those without foot pain. Sim-
ilar patterns were seen when the severity of foot pain was 
examined: those who reported moderate or severe foot 
pain showed significantly increased odds of having recur-
rent falls (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06–2.99 and OR 3.52, 95% 
CI 1.65–7.48, respectively) compared to those who re-
ported no foot pain ( 
Table 2 
). 
 
Foot Function, Foot Posture, and Falls 
 
There were no significant relations observed between 
the dynamic foot function measures with ORs ranging 
from 1.01 to 1.28 and wide CIs. There was little to no as-
sociation for cavus foot posture as well. However, par-
ticipants with planus foot posture had a 78% increased 
odds of having recurrent falls compared to those with 
normal foot posture (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10–2.87) (

ble 3 
).

Discussion 
 
This cross-sectional study of older adults showed a sig-
nificant association between the severity of foot pain and 
falls. While mild foot pain did not affect the odds of falling, 
moderate to severe foot pain was associated with increased 
odds of recurrent falls. This cross-sectional study also 
showed a significant relation between foot posture and 
falls, in which participants with a planus foot posture had 
an increased odds of recurrent falls compared to those 
with a normal foot posture. These results indicate that foot 
pain and foot posture may play an important role in recur-
rent falls among older adults. We did not observe in-
creased odds of falling in connection with foot pain and 
any falls or single falls reported over the past year.
 
Foot Pain and Falls 
 
This study found that moderate or severe foot pain was 
associated with increased odds of recurrent falls. Similar 
results have been reported in other studies relating foot 
problems (e.g., pain, foot deformities) to falls. A 1988 falls 
study of 336 older adults found that “serious foot prob-
lems” significantly increased fall risk  
[1] 
, but it was un-
clear if that study’
s definition of foot problems included 
foot pain or pain severity. While large, population-based 
data that relate foot pain with falls are scarce, the results 
of this study are consistent with smaller studies of falls in 
older adults. Notably, a prospective study of 313 Austra-
lian participants over the age of 60 years reported that 
fallers had a significantly greater prevalence of foot pain 
 
[17] 
. A similar result was observed in a study of 176 adults 
aged 62–96 years in which fallers reported significantly 
higher rates of disabling foot pain  
[24] 
. One novel finding 
of the current study was that foot pain was significantly 
associated with recurrent falls, and the association was 
stronger with worsening pain severity, suggesting that 
not only foot pain but the worsening of foot pain is linked 
to more falls.
 
Evaluating the functional aspects of foot pain and foot 
problems may offer insight into potential mechanisms for 
how foot pain can lead to falls. Individuals with foot pain 
have a significantly worse self-reported health-related 
quality of life  
[11, 25] along with higher self-reported dis-
ability  
[26] 
 and functional limitation  
[27] 
. Functional 
tests (e.g., stair ascent and descent, alternate stepping test, 
timed walks) and tests of dynamic balance (e.g., coordi-
nated stability test, leaning balance test)  
[13, 28] also 
show diminished performance among those with rela-
tively worse foot health. Thus, it may be that the increase 
in falls among those with foot pain observed in this and 
previous studies is the result of related functional impair-
ments. Future work should explore interventions to mit-
igate foot pain in relation to falls and functional perfor-
mance measures.
 
Foot Pain Severity and Falls 
 
Few studies have directly investigated the effect of foot 
pain severity on falls. Studies in older adults which clas-
sified disabling foot pain using the Manchester Foot Pain 
and Disability Index (MFPDI) have found greater odds of 
falling  
[17] 
, as well as reduced gait speed and higher re-
ported functional limitations  
[25] 
, but neither study in-

cluded categories of severity of foot pain. By comparison, 
the Women’
s Health and Aging Study found that the 
presence of self-reported moderate to severe foot pain re-
sulted in a significant increase (35%) in fall risk  
[29] 
. 
 
A notable finding of the current study was the associa-
tion between increased odds of recurrent falls for those 
participants who reported moderate or severe foot pain. 
Studies of overall health, physical function, and disability 
may offer additional insight into these data. A 1998 study 
of >1,000 older women found that participants with mod-
erate or severe foot pain had significantly worse perfor-
mance on timed walking and chair stand tests than those 
with mild or no foot pain  
[14] 
. Menz and Lord  
[28] noted 
in a study of 135 older adults aged 75–93 years that recur-
rent fallers had worse overall foot health than both non-
fallers and those who only fell once as indicated by a 
weighted score of foot health that included a dichoto-
mous pain response. This finding is consistent with re-
sults of the present study showing that those with severe 
foot pain have greatly increased odds of being recurrent 
fallers, as these individuals likely have worse foot health 
overall. Future studies should examine the effects of pain 
severity on physical performance, functional limitation, 
and disability. 
 
Foot Posture, Dynamic Foot Function, and Falls 
 
There were no significant relations observed between 
the dynamic foot function measures in the study partici-
pants. However, those participants who had planus foot 
posture compared to those with normal foot posture had 
a 78% increased odds of having recurrent falls in the past 
year. The cavus foot posture measure showed little asso-
ciation with falls. There is scant literature on foot func-
tion and falls. 
 
The association observed between planus foot posture 
and falls may be due to a direct effect on balance. Several 
studies have shown that individuals with planus foot pos-
ture have impaired postural stability  
[30–33] 
, possibly be-
cause the planus foot type is inherently more mobile 
when standing  
[34] 
. Alternatively, this association could 
be indirect, mediated by the association between planus 
foot posture and foot pain  
[35] 
.
 
The lack of association between dynamic foot function 
and falls was unexpected but may be explained by the fact 
that all pressure measurements were obtained while bare-
foot. Footwear has been shown to modify center of pres-
sure patterns  
[36] and as such may have confounded the 
association between dynamic foot function and falls. Al-
though this will also have affected static foot posture mea-
sures, it is likely that footwear has a greater influence on 
dynamic function than static alignment. We were unable 
to assess these aspects in our current study.
 
Strengths and Limitations 
 
A major strength of this study is that the study par-
ticipants are derived from the Framingham Study, a well-
characterized cohort that contains large numbers of both 
men and women within a wide age range. We also used a 
validated foot examination to assess foot pain and foot 
pain severity along with measures of foot function and 
posture. A novel aspect of the current study is the consid-
eration of foot function and posture as well as foot pain. 
However, a number of limitations need to be considered 
when interpreting the findings. We did not examine pe-
ripheral neuropathy or nociceptive versus neuropathic 
pain in our study. We also did not collect data on injuri-
ous falls. Thus, the study is limited by this lack of infor-
mation on type of pain or injury from fall. Our study was 
cross-sectional, and thus, causal inferences cannot be as-
cribed. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate 
the question. Also, the Framingham Study is primarily 
comprised of Caucasians, and thus, the results may not be 
generalizable to non-Caucasian groups. In addition, par-
ticipants provided a reporting of falls in the past year ei-
ther at the time of their foot exam or, for <5%, within 1 
year of the foot exam. Thus, for some participants, the 
falls data were ascertained at a different time point than 
their foot assessment. Falls were documented retrospec-
tively, which may have limited accuracy due to the diffi-
culties older people may have in recall over a 12-month 
period  
[37] 
. However, the rate of falls reported here is 
similar to large prospective studies that have found strong 
associations between past falls and subsequent falls  
[38, 
39] 
. Finally, severity of foot pain was self-reported, and 
hence, misclassification may have occurred. 
 
Falls are often devastating events for older adults. 
More insights into these occurrences may lead to better 
interventions. In this study, foot pain was associated with 
increased odds of recurrent falls after controlling for pos-
sible confounders. Moderate foot pain and severe foot 
pain were even more strongly associated with recurrent 
falls. No significantly increased risks for falls were indi-
cated by foot pain and occurrence of any fall or 1 fall in 
the past year. Further, recurrent falls were more likely in 
those with planus foot posture. The results indicate that 
foot pain and foot posture may play a role in the occur-
rence of falls in older adults. Future work should examine 
the mechanisms by which foot pain affects risk of falls as 
well as the potential of interventions to reduce foot pain 
and reduce the risk of falls in older adults.
