Abstract
Despite consistent declines in rates of cigarette use among adolescents in the last five years, rates 
of marijuana use have remained constant, with marijuana being the most widely used illegal drug 
among adolescents. More work is needed to understand how social norms, perceived risks and 
benefits, and social media messaging impact use of marijuana. This study compared perceptions 
and social norms related to marijuana, blunts and cigarettes. Additionally, we assessed how 
perceptions related to social norms, risks and benefits, and exposure to pro- versus anti-marijuana 
messaging is related to use. Participants were 786 adolescents from Southern and Northern 
California (36.7% male, 63.3% females; mean age = 16.1 years; SD = 1.6). Participants came from 
diverse ethnic backgrounds, with 207 (26.61%) White, 171 (21.98%) Asian/Pacific Islander, 232 
(29.82%) Hispanic, and 168 (21.59%) other. Results indicated that marijuana and blunts were 
consistently perceived as more socially acceptable and less risky than cigarettes (p<0.01). 
Participants who reported that their friends used marijuana had a 27% greater odds of using 
marijuana themselves. Further, seeing messages about the good things or benefits of marijuana use 
was associated with a 6% greater odds of use [OR 1.06 (CI 1.00, 1.12)]. This study's findings offer 
a number of important public health implications, particularly as states move towards legalization 
of marijuana for recreational use. As this occurs, states need to take adolescents’ perceptions of 
risks, benefits, social norms, and peer influences into account as they implement strategies to 
reduce youth use of marijuana and blunts.

1. Introduction
Despite consistent declines in rates of cigarette use among adolescents in the last five years, 
rates of marijuana use have remained constant, with marijuana being the most widely used 
illicit drug among adolescents (Miech et al., 2015). Nationally representative data from 
Monitoring the Future show rates of conventional cigarette use among 10th graders declining 
significantly from 9.1% in 2013 to 7.2% in 2014; and among 12th graders from 16.3% in 
2013 to 13.6% in 2014 (Miech et al., 2015). Rates of marijuana use have remained stable, 
with 16.6% of 10th graders and 21.2% of 12th graders reporting past 30-day use in 2014 
(Miech et al., 2015). Blunts (marijuana rolled in tobacco leaf) have become a common form 
of marijuana among adolescents, with more than half of 30-day marijuana users also 
reporting blunt use (Golub et al., 2006; Delnevo et al., 2011).
Adolescents’ perceptions related to marijuana use have also changed, with the number of 
youth who perceive significant risk from using marijuana once or twice a week decreasing 
from 54.6% in 2007 to 39.5% in 2013 (Miech et al., 2015). Moreover, 73.3% of 10th graders 
reported disapproval of occasional marijuana use in 2007, yet 62.9% reported disapproval in 
2014 (Miech et al., 2015). Social media is a key venue for sharing marijuana-related 
information and attitudes, particularly among adolescents. For example, between 2012 and 
2013, more adolescents than adults tweeted about marijuana, with the majority of these 
tweets reflecting positive attitudes about marijuana (Thompson et al., 2015).
Social acceptability and perceptions of risks and benefits, including the active sharing of 
these beliefs on social media, are important predictors of health behavior decision-making 
(Ennett et al., 2008; Alexander et al., 2001; Song et al., 2009; Rodriguez et al., 2007; 
Halpern-Felsher et al., 2004). Perceptions of risks generally vary by sex and age, with 
females and minorities tending to rate perceived risks higher than white males (Slovic, 
2000). Additionally, perceptions of risk related to marijuana use are known to be higher 
among females, non-whites, older adults, and individuals who have a family income 
between $20,000-49,999 (Pacek et al., 2015). However, few studies have examined 
adolescents’ beliefs about specific risks and benefits related to marijuana and blunts, and 
studies have not examined relationships among adolescents’ perceptions, social 
acceptability, awareness of social media and actual marijuana use (Goldberg et al., 2009; 
LaBrie et al., 2011). Understanding these relationships is critical, especially since smoking 
marijuana places one at risk for a number of the same negative health outcomes and 
secondhand smoke effects as smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes (Wang et al., 2014). 
Long-term use of marijuana can lead to addiction, with initiation in adolescence associated 
with higher rates of addiction, negative impacts on brain development, and lower levels of 
school and lifetime achievement (Bray et al., 2000; Brook et al., 2013; Hall & Degenhardt, 
2009; Meier et al., 2012; Volkow et al., 2014; Zalesky et al., 2012). There is also concern

 that using both marijuana and tobacco at the same time (i.e., blunts) can reinforce the 
rewarding effects of both substances (Viveros et al., 2006).
Using a sample of 9th and 12th grade students recruited from California schools, this study 
addresses important gaps in the literature by first reporting adolescents’ rates and patterns of 
use of and access to marijuana, blunts, and cigarettes. Second, this study examines and 
compares adolescents’ perceived prevalence, social acceptability, and risks and benefits of 
marijuana, blunts, and cigarettes. Lastly, this paper assesses to what extent these factors are 
associated with actual use of marijuana. Such information is important in order to inform the 
creation of better education and warning messages, especially as marijuana and blunt use 
increases in popularity and moves from an illicit drug to a legal drug for recreational use 
(Lyman & Haugh, 2014).
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
This study utilized a convenience sample, in which we recruited participants from 10 large 
high schools throughout California. These schools were diverse with respect to geographic 
location (urban, suburban, and rural), race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES); and 
were schools that were willing to participate in the study. Researchers introduced the study 
and invited all ninth and 12th graders to participate, during which time they provided 
students with consent forms for parents and students 18 and over, assent forms for students 
under age 18, and project information to take home and discuss with their parents/guardians.
Approximately 4,000 students learned about the study, of whom 1,299 returned signed 
consent/assent forms; 405 (31.1%) of the consented students were disqualified from the 
study because of incorrect contact information, being in the wrong grade, or non-response to 
subsequent contact. Overall, 786 (87.9%) of eligible consented students completed the 
survey. There were some small but non-meaningful racial/ethnic differences between those 
who did and did not complete the survey; however, there were no differences by mother's 
education.
The sample size was designed to allow sufficient power (80%) to detect the contrasts of 
interest. The sample included 484 (63.21%) females and 281 (36.67%) males; mean age = 
16.1 (SD=1.6). Participants were ethnically diverse, with 207 (26.61%) White, 171 (21.98%) 
Asian/Pacific Islander, 232 (29.82%) Hispanic, and 168 (21.59%) other. Demographics of 
the students who participated in the study reflected the demographic make-up of their 
respective schools.
2.2. Procedures
Participants were sent an email with a link to the online survey, administered through 
Qualtrics. The order of questions and queries about marijuana blunts, and cigarettes were 
counterbalanced in order to control for order effects. Participants received $10.00 for 
participating. Procedures for this study were approved by our university's institutional 
review board.

 2.3. Measures
The survey included 125 questions addressing a number of research questions; and took 
participants between 30 and 60 minutes to complete. Participants were allowed as much time 
as they wanted to complete the survey, although they were encouraged to complete the 
survey at one time to increase confidentiality of their responses. Only those measures related 
to the current study are reported here. Comprehensive results regarding the cigarette use data 
can be found in Roditis et al. (2016). Many measures were derived from past surveys on 
adolescents’ attitudes towards substances, including those that have tested the validity of the 
assessments (Chaffee et al., 2015; Goldberg et al., 2009; Halpern-Felsher et al., 2004; 
Roditis et al., 2016; Song et al., 2009). All measures were pilot tested with adolescents of 
the same age and demographics of our sample. Participants indicated items that were not 
clear, and then we revised the survey and pilot tested it again until all measures were clear. 
Most items were continuously scored; the few that were dichotomized are noted below.
2.3.1. Never/ever use—Participants were asked: “During your entire life, how many 
times have you ever used [cigarettes, marijuana, blunts]?” Responses were then 
dichotomized so that individuals were categorized as “ever users” if they used the product at 
least once, and “never users” if they reported never using the product.
2.3.2. Patterns of and access to marijuana use—Participants answered the following 
questions: “Where did you get [marijuana, blunts] the last time you used them?” “When you 
use [marijuana, blunts], where is the place you use them most often?” “When do you use 
[marijuana, blunts] most often?” and “With whom do you use [marijuana, blunts] most 
often?”
2.3.3. Social Norms—Participants answered the following questions regarding perceived 
prevalence of use: “As far as you know has your mother/female guardian; father/male 
guardian; siblings; closest friends ever used the following,” and “Out of 100 teens your age 
and race/ethnicity, how many do you think use [cigarettes, marijuana, blunts]?” Participants 
answered the following question regarding perceived acceptability, “Friends think it is 
socially acceptable to use [cigarettes, marijuana, blunts].”
2.3.4. Perceptions of short-term health risks, short-term social risks and 
benefits—Participants indicated the likelihood of experiencing several short-term social 
and health risks and benefits if they were to just start using each product. The risks and 
benefits included: friends will be upset with you, you'll get in trouble, get bad breath, bad 
cough, cold, trouble catching breath, mouth sores, worse performance in sports, you'll look 
cool, you'll look more mature, and you'll fit in with your peers (Halpern-Felsher et al., 2004; 
Roditis et al., 2016).
2.3.5. Receptivity to marketing—Participants were asked: “Do you or your friends own 
any promotional materials for [marijuana, blunts],” coded as yes/no, and “How likely is it 
that you would wear promotional items for [marijuana, blunts],” coded as very likely to very 
unlikely.

 2.3.6. Social media—Participants answered the following: “Have you ever seen a 
message posted on social media about [the risks or bad things/benefits or good things] 
related to using marijuana/blunts?” and “have you ever posted a message on social media 
about [the risks or bad things; the benefits or good things] related to using marijuana/
blunts?” Responses were dichotomized into yes and no.
3. Analysis
Differences in perceptions of risks and benefits and social norms across products were 
assessed using a generalized linear model with the generalized estimating equation method 
and an exchangeable correlation matrix to adjust the variance estimates for non-
independence within school as implemented in Proc Genmod of SAS, v94. Post hoc testing 
utilized Tukey-Kramer tests. The relationship among marijuana use, perceptions of social 
norms, risks and benefits, and viewing of ads on social media was assessed using logistic 
regression. The outcome variable, marijuana use, was coded into 2 categories of never used 
and ever used. Predictor variables included: (1) perceived prevalence variables, (2) perceived 
risk and benefit variables factor analyzed into the following categories: health and social 
risks, benefits, and risk of addiction, and (3) awareness of social media attitudes and beliefs 
related to marijuana. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were also included in the model; however, 
interactions with sex and race/ethnicity were not significant and therefore were removed in 
the final model. Missing data, which was negligible and varied item to item, were left 
missing. SPSS version 23 was used for the descriptive analyses.
4. Results
4.1. Use/dual use and access to marijuana, blunts and cigarettes
Among the participants, 98 (12.63%) had ever tried cigarettes, 195 (25.13%) had ever tried 
marijuana, and 142 (18.30 %) had ever tried a blunt. Of the 98 students who had ever used a 
cigarette, 75 (76.53%) had used marijuana and 61 (62.24%) had also used a blunt. Of the 
195 ever marijuana users, 75 (38.46%) had used cigarettes and 140 (71.79%) had used a 
blunt. Of the 142 blunt users, 61 (42.96%) had used a cigarette.
The majority of ever marijuana or blunt users reported getting these products from friends 
the last time they used them (62.0% and 60.5%, respectively), tended to use these products 
with friends (79.5% and 76.8%, respectively), and most used them at friends’ houses (46.3% 
and 46.7%, respectively). Ever marijuana or blunts users reported use most often when 
stressed out (46.2% and 45.8%, respectively; see Table 1).
4.1.1. Social Norms—There were significant differences in participants’ reports of 
mother, father, sibling, and friend use of these products. Participants reported lower rates of 
marijuana and blunt use and higher rates of cigarettes use among adult figures in their lives. 
Conversely, participants reported much higher rates of marijuana than cigarette use among 
friends (with 51.2% of participants reporting that their friends use marijuana). They 
perceived significant differences in rates of use among peers, reporting that 50.92% of their 
peers had ever used marijuana, 42.63% had ever used blunts and 34.43% had ever used

 cigarettes. Participants viewed marijuana and blunts as more socially acceptable than 
cigarettes (See Table 2).
4.1.2. Perceptions of risks and benefits—Participants rated cigarettes as being overall 
more harmful to their health, more harmful to their friends’ health, more harmful to the 
environment, and more addictive than marijuana or blunts (p<0.01). Post-hoc analyses 
showed that participants perceived marijuana as more harmful to the environment than 
blunts, and perceived blunts as more likely to lead to addiction than marijuana. Participants 
viewed marijuana and blunts as similarly risky when it comes to their and their friends’ 
health (p<0.01; see Table 2).
Generally, participants rated marijuana and blunt use as less likely to result in short-term 
health risks than cigarettes, with post-hoc analyses showing that they viewed marijuana and 
blunts as similarly risky. Participants also rated marijuana and blunt use as less likely than 
cigarettes to result in the short-term social risks of friends getting upset and bad breath. 
Participants reported no difference in the likelihood of getting in trouble from using 
marijuana, blunts, or cigarettes. Adolescents rated marijuana and blunts as more likely to 
confer social benefits of looking cool and fitting in than cigarettes, though they rated all 
products as equally likely to make them look mature.
Participants rated marijuana and blunts as less likely to make them feel jittery or nervous, 
more likely to reduce stress, and more likely to make them feel high or buzzed than 
cigarettes. They rated all three products as equally likely to help with concentration. 
Marijuana and blunts were rated as less addictive, and easier to quit than cigarettes (see 
Table 2).
4.2. Marketing
4.2.1. Social Media—A similar number of participants reported seeing messages on social 
media about the risks and benefits related to marijuana use (51.9% and 52.7%, respectively). 
Additionally, 34.4% reported seeing messages about risks related to blunt use and 28.6% 
reported seeing messages on benefits related to blunt use. A smaller number of participants 
reported actively posting online about these products, with 13% posting about the risks 
related to marijuana use, 10.9% posting about the benefits, 10.1% posting about the risks of 
blunt use, and 4.6% posting about the benefits of blunts (see Table 3).
4.2.2. Receptivity to marketing—While only 3.0% and 1.5% of participants reported 
owning a promotional item for marijuana or blunts respectively, they reported that 31.7% 
and 18.2 of friends owned a promotional item for marijuana or blunts, respectively. 
Adolescents reported that they were generally unlikely to wear promotional items for 
marijuana or blunts (see Table 3).
4.3. Factors related to marijuana use
Perceptions of social norms, health and social risks, awareness of social media, and age were 
all associated with marijuana use. Individuals who reported that close friends used marijuana 
had a 27% greater odds of having ever used themselves [OR 1.27 (CI 1.20, 1.34)]. 
Roditis et al.

 Individuals who reported having seen a message on social media about the benefits of using 
marijuana use had a 6% greater odds of having used themselves [OR 1.06 (CI 1.00, 1.12)]. 
For every unit increase in perceptions of health and social risks related to use there was a 
corresponding .001% greater odds of not using marijuana [0.999 (CI 0.997, 0.999)]. Finally, 
for every year increase in age, there was a corresponding 6% greater odds s of using 
marijuana [OR 1.06 (CI 1.03, 1.09)] (see Table 4).
5. Discussion
Use rates in this study were highest for marijuana, followed by blunts and cigarettes. Most 
adolescents who use these products get them from friends, use them in friends’ houses, and 
when they feel stressed.
Adolescents perceived lower marijuana and blunt use but higher cigarette use among 
parents. Conversely, adolescents perceived higher use of marijuana and blunts and lower use 
of cigarettes among their siblings and peers. These differences in perceived use may reflect 
current trends in adolescent marijuana and cigarette use nationwide, in which rates of 
cigarette use is much lower than marijuana use, with cigarette use continuing to decline, 
marijuana use remaining higher (Miech et al., 2015), and rates of marijuana use being higher 
among adolescents and young adults compared to adults (Center for Behavioral Health 
Statistics and Quality, 2015).
While approximately a quarter of participants report having used marijuana, they thought 
that more than half of their friends have used marijuana. Importantly, participants who 
reported that their friends used marijuana had a 27% greater odds of using marijuana 
themselves. Previous studies also show relationships between friend drug use and adolescent 
drug use, and friend use is a powerful influence on adolescents’ social norms and 
acceptability of particular behaviors (Duan et al., 2009). The fact that participants report 
friend use rates of marijuana as double that of self-reported use may be reflective of 
changing social norms in which marijuana use is seen as an acceptable and common 
behavior, which, in turn, may be influencing decisions to use (Godin & Kok, 1996; Madden 
et al., 1992).
Marijuana and blunts were generally perceived as more socially acceptable, less risky, and 
more beneficial than cigarettes. Despite the fact that blunts contain nicotine yet marijuana 
doesn't, adolescents didn't perceive differences in the likelihood of becoming addicted or 
being able to quit marijuana or blunts, although adolescents rated marijuana as more 
addictive than blunts. This is of particular importance, as it is possible that using both 
tobacco and marijuana together (as occurs with blunts) may actually increase the addictive 
potential of these products (Volkow et al., 2014). While perceptions of benefits and addiction 
were not related to use in this study, perceptions of greater health and social risks were 
associated with lesser odds of using marijuana. Other studies have also found risk 
perceptions related to use (Song et al., 2009; Rodriguez et al., 2007; Roditis et al., 2016). 
The fact that perceptions of benefits were not related to use is surprising as other studies 
have found perceptions of benefits to predict use (Slovic, 2000). It is possible that perceived 
social norms are more important drivers of adolescents’ decisions to use marijuana than 
Roditis et al.

 perceived risks and benefits despite the fact that these constructs are linked (Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015; Duan et al., 2009).
While perceptions of benefits of marijuana were not related to use, seeing messages about 
the good things or benefits of marijuana use was associated with a 6% greater odds of use. In 
contrast, despite adolescents seeing ads for both risks and benefits of marijuana, messages 
regarding risks were not related to use. It is possible that individuals who use marijuana are 
actively seeking and more aware of messages related to benefits of marijuana use.
There are limitations to this study. The data are self-reported. Further, given the cross-
sectional nature of our data, we cannot suggest a causal relationship between factors 
associated with marijuana use and marijuana use itself. Additionally, some of the factors 
associated with marijuana use have a confidence interval approaching 1.0. Finally, these data 
were collected throughout Northern and Southern California and thus are not nationally 
representative.
Despite these limitations, this is one of the few studies to assess perceptions of social norms, 
risks and benefits for marijuana, blunts, and cigarettes. Additionally, this study assessed how 
these factors as well as awareness of social media are related to marijuana use. Results from 
this study offer a number of important public health implications, particularly as states move 
towards legalization of marijuana for recreational use. As this occurs, states need to take 
adolescents’ perceptions of risks, benefits, social norms, and peer influences into account. 
Though there is mixed evidence on how legalization impacts adolescent marijuana use, 
advocates for marijuana legalization argue that legalization itself does not increase use 
among youth (Wall et al., 2011; Lynne-Landsman et al., 2013). However, there is no 
evidence that legalization alone does anything to decrease use or access among adolescents.
The results from this study have a number of implications for prevention strategies. 
Perceived rates of marijuana use among friends is higher than participant self-reported use 
rates and reported national averages of adolescent use. This finding is similar to findings in 
the alcohol use literature, which finds that youth and young adults tend to overestimate rates 
of binge drinking. Importantly, dispelling this misperception has been used effectively in a 
number of social norms campaigns focused on reducing binge drinking in college campuses 
(DeJong et al., 2006; LaBrie et al., 2010). This suggests that using a similar social norms 
marketing approach, in which youth learn that rates of marijuana use among peers are much 
lower than they think, may be a useful strategy to prevent use.
In this study, both perceived friend use and having seen positive messages about marijuana 
was associated with greater odds that an adolescent used marijuana. These findings also 
suggest the need for marketing, education and intervention strategies that specifically tackle 
social acceptability and peer use.
This study also shows that adolescents perceive marijuana and blunts to be significantly less 
harmful than cigarettes, despite the fact that all of these products are combustible smoking 
products. Additionally, despite the fact that blunts have nicotine, adolescents did not 
perceive these to be more addictive than marijuana. These findings suggest that there is also 
a need for educational and marketing campaigns that realistically address what the risks of

 marijuana and blunt use are for both youth and adults, including risks of addiction. National, 
state, and local public health agencies should consider lessons learned from regulatory and 
informational strategies that have been used in tobacco control, and should implement such 
strategies before legalization occurs (Barry et al., 2014).
