Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Treatment of chronic low back pain (LBP) in older adults is limited by the 
adverse effects of analgesics. Effective nonpharmacologic treatment options are needed.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the effectiveness of a mind-body program at increasing function and 
reducing pain in older adults with chronic LBP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This single-blind, randomized clinical trial 
compared a mind-body program (n = 140) with a health education program (n = 142). 
Community-dwelling older adults residing within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area were recruited 
from February 14, 2011, to June 30, 2014, with 6-month follow-up completed by April 9, 2015. 
Eligible participants were 65 years or older with functional limitations owing to their chronic LBP 
(≥11 points on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire) and chronic pain (duration ≥3 
months) of moderate intensity. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 1, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS—The intervention and control groups received an 8-week group program 
followed by 6 monthly sessions. The intervention was modeled on the Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction program; the control program, on the “10 Keys” to Healthy Aging.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Follow-up occurred at program completion and 6 
months later. The score on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire was the primary 
outcome and measured functional limitations owing to LBP. Pain (current, mean, and most severe 
in the past week) was measured with the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes 
included quality of life, pain self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Intent-to-treat analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS—Of 1160 persons who underwent screening, 282 participants enrolled in the trial (95 
men [33.7%] and 187 women [66.3%]; mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.6] years). The baseline mean (SD) 
Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire scores for the intervention and control groups were 
15.6 (3.0) and 15.4 (3.0), respectively. Compared with the control group, intervention participants 
improved an additional −1.1 (mean, 12.1 vs 13.1) points at 8 weeks and −0.04 (mean, 12.2 vs 
12.6) points at 6 months (effect sizes, −0.23 and −0.08, respectively) on the Roland and Morris

 Disability Questionnaire. By 6 months, the intervention participants improved on the Numeric 
Pain Rating Scale current and most severe pain measures an additional −1.8 points (95% CI, −3.1 
to −0.05 points; effect size, −0.33) and −1.0 points (95% CI, −2.1 to 0.2 points; effect size, −0.19), 
respectively. The changes in Numeric Pain Rating Scale mean pain measure after the intervention 
were not significant (−0.1 [95% CI, −1.1 to 1.0] at 8 weeks and −1.1 [95% CI, −2.2 to −0.01] at 6 
months; effect size, −0.01 and −0.22, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—A mind-body program for chronic LBP improved short-
term function and long-term current and most severe pain. The functional improvement was not 
sustained, suggesting that future development of the intervention could focus on durability.
Chronic pain affects approximately 100 million adults in the United States.1 Among adults 
65 years and older, the prevalence of pain was found to be 52.9% in the National Health and 
Aging Trends Study.2 The back was the most common site and identified in 30.3% of the 
sample. Those adults with pain exhibited decreased physical function compared with those 
without pain. Treatment is often unsatisfactory in older adults, in part owing to the adverse 
effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids. Fewer treatment options may 
lead to the prescription of invasive interventions that may be of limited benefit.3 Additional 
nonpharma-cologic treatment options are needed.
According to the most recent National Health Interview Survey, 18 million Americans tried 
meditation in 2012.4 This uptake of meditation is associated with a growing evidence base 
on its health benefits. In particular, a recent meta-analysis found mindfulness meditation has 
a moderate effect on decreasing pain, anxiety, and depression.5 The effect on pain found in 
this study was primarily owing to a reduction in visceral pain, whereas the effect on 
musculoskeletal pain was not clinically significant. However, the latter finding was based on 
only 2 studies with small sample sizes.6,7 Therefore, further evidence of the effects of 
mindfulness meditation on musculoskeletal pain conditions is needed.
A pilot study in older adults with chronic low back pain (LBP) demonstrated the feasibility 
of an 8-week mind-body program that taught commonly used methods of mindfulness 
meditation. In addition, initial evidence of a treatment effect for decreasing pain and 
increasing function and quality of life has been noted.6,8 We present the next phase of this 
research, which was to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in an 
adequately powered clinical trial. The primary aim of the study was to determine the 
effectiveness of the mind-body program at increasing function and reducing pain in adults 
65 years or older with chronic LBP. We hypothesized that mindfulness meditation would be 
associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function after the 8-week 
mind-body program compared with a health education control program. We also 
hypothesized that compared with the control group, intervention participants would 
experience decreased pain and increased psychological function immediately after the 8-
week mind-body program, and that 6 months after program completion, the magnitude of 
improvement in physical function, pain, and psychological function would be maintained.

 Methods
Overview
This experimental study was designed as a randomized, education-controlled clinical trial of 
a mind-body program for older adults with chronic LBP. Details of the study procedure have 
been published previously.9 We randomized 282 independent, community-dwelling adults 
65 years or older who were recruited from metropolitan Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Participants in the mind-body (intervention) group received the group intervention of 8 
weekly 90-minute mindfulness meditation sessions modeled on the Mindfulness-Based 
Stress Reduction program.10 Controls received an 8-week group health education program 
based on the “10 Keys” to Healthy Aging.11 After completion of the 8-week program, 
participants in the intervention and control programs were asked to return for 6 monthly 
booster sessions. Measures were obtained at baseline, after the 8-week program, and 6 
months after program completion. Recruitment occurred from February 14, 2011, to June 
30, 2014. The final 6-month assessment was completed April 9, 2015. The study protocol 
was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pittsburgh. All 
participants provided written informed consent.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Participants were included if they were 65 years or older, spoke English, had intact cognition 
(Mini-Mental State Examination score, ≥24),12 had functional limitations owing to their 
chronic LBP (defined as a score of ≥11 on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire 
[RMDQ]; range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating increased limitations),13 and had self-
reported moderate chronic pain levels on a verbal descriptor scale (Pain Thermometer; 
measured on a visual scale as pain as bad as it could be, extreme, severe, moderate, mild, or 
no pain) occurring daily or almost every day for at least the previous 3 months.13 
Participants were excluded if they had participated in a previous mindfulness meditation 
program, had serious underlying illness (such as malignant neoplasms, infection, 
unexplained fever, weight loss, or recent trauma) causing their pain, were nonambulatory, 
had severe impaired mobility, had visual or hearing impairment that interfered with 
assessments, had pain in other parts of the body more severe than their chronic LBP or acute 
back pain, had an acute or a terminal illness, or had moderate to severe depressive symptoms 
(Geriatric Depression Scale score, ≥21; range, 0-30).14
Assessments and Outcome Measures
The RMDQ was the primary outcome measure. It contains 24 questions specifically related 
to functional limitations as a result of LBP. A clinically meaningful change on the RMDQ 
ranges from a 2.5- to a 5.0-point improvement (reduction) from baseline.15 Pain (present, 
average, and most severe during the past week) was measured by self-report with the 
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS; range, 0-20, with higher scores indicating worse pain).16 
Because pain is a complex phenomenon that affects quality of life, mood, and psychological 
function, we chose a variety of established instruments to measure these different domains. 
Quality of life was measured with the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (Global Health 
Composite [range, 9-67, with higher scores indicating better global health]; and Physical 
Health Composite [range, 20-65, with higher scores indicating better physical health]).17

 Given the strong association between chronic pain and depression,18 we used the Geriatric 
Depression Scale. Self-efficacy has been shown to predict task performance.19 We measured 
this construct with the well-validated Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (range, 0%-100%, 
with higher scores indicating improved self-efficacy).20 Pain catastrophizing was measured 
with the Catastrophizing Scale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (range, 0-6, with 
higher scores indicating greater catastrophizing).21 We assessed self-reported mindfulness 
with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; range, 1-6, with higher scores 
indicating greater mindfulness).22 Data on comorbidity were reported with the Cumulative 
Illness Rating Scale (range, 0-13, with higher scores indicating more comorbid conditions).
23 Expectancy and credibility were assessed at baseline.24 Assessment of primary and 
secondary outcome measures occurred immediately (8 weeks) and 6 months after program 
completion.
To examine the process of change, brief (15-minute) monthly telephone evaluations of major 
domains (function, pain, mindfulness, and health system encounters) were conducted. 
Health system encounters were determined by monthly telephone calls that included 
questions regarding the use of health care services. All encounters that involved 
hospitalization or emergency department visits were reviewed by the principal investigator 
(N.E.M.) and by the data safety monitoring board (which included a physician) to determine 
whether the reasons constituted an adverse event related to the intervention or control 
programs.
Randomization and Blinding
After initial telephone screening, in-person written informed consent was obtained. If 
participants were still eligible after screening for physical function, cognition, and 
depression, a physical examination and baseline measures were completed. All eligible 
research participants were randomized into the intervention or the control group after 
baseline measures were obtained. The initial randomization was generated by the study 
statistician (C.G.M.) using a permuted block design with a block size of 4 in a 1:1 ratio 
using SAS PROC PLAN software (SAS Institute, Inc). The list was uploaded into the Web-
based data collection system and concealed such that each allocation was only provided after 
a participant was deemed eligible. After 155 participants had been randomized, a significant 
imbalance between groups by sex was noted. With approval from the data safety monitoring 
board, we changed the fixed randomization to a baseline adaptive randomization to balance 
future allocations by sex and corrected the imbalance.25 The Web-based data collection 
system was modified to randomize in real time using the minimization method rather than 
the fixed list. Only after baseline measures were completed was the allocation available for 
access by the project coordinator (B.L.) who then communicated the assignment to the 
participant in person or by telephone. All outcome assessments were conducted by staff 
members blinded to intervention assignment.
Intervention
The intervention was modeled on the 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program. 
Four methods of mindful-ness meditation were taught. These techniques take regular 
activities such as sitting, walking, and lying down and transform them into a meditation

 through directed breathing and mindful awareness of thoughts and sensations. The methods 
used included the body scan, sitting practice, walking meditation, and mindful stretching. To 
encourage proficiency with the meditation method after completion of the intervention, 
monthly 60-minute booster sessions were held. Each session included time for a mindfulness 
meditation and time for discussion of the themes brought up during the 8-week program.
Control Program
The comparison group controlled for time, group size, attention, homework, and facilitator 
time. We based the 8-week health education program on a successful aging curriculum 
known as the 10 Keys to Healthy Aging.11 Pain information is not a component of the 10 
Keys to Healthy Aging program, and we did not add this information to avoid contamination 
of the control group. The 10 Keys to Healthy Aging teaches an interactive, dynamic program 
to older adults on key health topics relevant to healthy aging such as hypertension 
management. The same chair stretches taught in the intervention were taught in the control 
program. To ensure that the control group received an equal amount of attention and social 
support, they also received monthly booster classes, which met monthly for 1 hour. The 
classes were based on the topics presented in the 10 Keys to Healthy Aging and presented by 
local experts in the field.
Sample Size
With a sample size of 300, our study was powered (80%-90%) to detect a 2.5-point 
difference on the RMDQ between the 2 study arms at 8 weeks, assuming an SD of 5.9, 
intraclass correlation of 0.01 to 0.02, and 20% attrition.9 Our attrition rate at 8 weeks was 
much lower than expected (4.3%), therefore we stopped recruitment after 282 individuals 
had been randomized. We conservatively anticipated an approximate loss to or unavailability 
for follow-up of 28 participants (10%) at 8 weeks, which would have provided data on at 
least 254 participants and maintained our original power.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 1, 2015. The statistical analysis plan has been 
described previously.9 A brief summary of the analyses used for this presentation of the 
primary results follows. All analyses were conducted using intention to treat and with 2-
sided tests of a = .05. We compared baseline characteristics of the participants in the 
intervention and control programs using 2-sample t tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum tests) for 
continuous variables and χ2 tests (or Fisher exact tests) for categorical variables. As 
originally proposed, we used linear mixed models to compare the RMDQ scores at the 
baseline, 8-week, and 6-month assessments in the outcome vector. We controlled for 
repeated measures using autoregressive covariance structure and controlled for correlation 
among individuals within the same class cohort (intraclass correlation) using a random class 
effect. The fixed effects were group (intervention or control), time, the interaction of group 
by time, and sex (owing to randomization stratification). We used contrasts to estimate and 
test the adjusted difference between the intervention and control groups at each point. 
Secondary outcomes that were continuous were analyzed using the same approach. To 
compare the proportion of participants with a clinically meaningful response on the RMDQ, 
NRS, and a global impression of change, the outcomes were dichotomized and tested using

 χ2 analyses at each point. An interim analysis for the primary outcome was not conducted 
throughout the course of the trial. All analyses were conducted in SAS statistical software 
(version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc).
Results
Of the 1160 persons who underwent screening, 282 met all eligibility criteria and provided 
signed informed consent to participate (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.6] years). Of these, we 
randomized 140 to the intervention program and 142 to the control program (Figure 1). The 
intervention was not delivered to 4 participants because 2 were no longer interested in 
participating in the study, 1 developed a serious illness, and 1 had unexpected family 
obligations. Five participants did not receive the control program because 2 were no longer 
interested, 1 developed unexpected illness, 1 had an unexpected family illness, and 1 was not 
satisfied with the randomization assignment. However, 2 of these participants from the 
intervention group and 3 from the control group agreed to complete follow-up assessments. 
At program completion (8 weeks), 132 participants in the intervention group (94.3%) and 
138 in the control group (97.2%) completed assessments. Six months after program 
completion, 118 in the intervention group (84.3%) and 135 in the control group (95.1%) 
underwent assessment. Both groups were similar on all baseline variables (Table 1).
Participants attended a mean of 6.6 sessions for each group (range, 0-8 sessions). 
Participants attended a mean of 2.4 booster sessions in the intervention group and 2.5 in the 
control group (range, 0-6 booster sessions). No adverse events related to the intervention or 
control group were noted.
Outcomes
The baseline mean (SD) RMDQ scores for the intervention and control groups were 15.6 
(3.0) and 15.4 (3.0), respectively. Compared with the control group, participants in the 
intervention group improved an additional −1.1 points on the RMDQ at 8 weeks and −0.4 
points at 6 months (overall group × time interaction, P = .01) (Table 2). The intervention 
group had a mean change of −3.5 points on the RMDQ at 8 weeks and −3.4 points at 6 
months, whereas the control group a mean change of −2.3 points at 8 weeks and −2.8 points 
at 6 months. The corresponding effect sizes between groups at 8 weeks and 6 months were 
−0.23 and −0.08, respectively. The effect of the intervention on function was not 
significantly modified by age, race, educational level, or sex. Per protocol missing data 
methods were applied with no effect on the inference for the RMDQ. Participants in the 
intervention group significantly improved over time on the current and most severe NRS 
pain measures for the past week compared with those in the control group, with an 
additional −1.8- and −1.0-point improvement by 6 months, respectively. This improvement 
corresponded to effect sizes between groups at 8 weeks and 6 months of −0.33 and −0.19, 
respectively. Differences on the average NRS pain measure between groups did not reach 
statistical significance (P = .08).
Seventy-five of 132 intervention participants (56.8%) vs 62 of 138 control participants 
(44.9%) had at least a 2.5-point clinically significant improvement at 8 weeks, but this 
difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .051). At 6 months, 58 of 117

 intervention participants (49.2%) and 66 of 135 control participants (48.9%) hada 2.5-point 
improvement (P = .97) (Table 3). Seven participants in the intervention group (5.3%) and 6 
participants in the control group (4.3%) had at least a 2.5-point worsening on the RMDQ at 
8 weeks. Six participants in the intervention group (5.1%) and 6 participants in the control 
group (4.4%) had at least a 2.5 point worsening on the RMDQ at 6 months.
In addition to the mean change over time in the pain scores, we evaluated the proportion of 
participants with a clinically meaningful 30% improvement. We found that immediately 
after program completion, more participants in the intervention group compared with the 
control group achieved a 30% improvement on the current (54 of 132 [40.9%] vs 34 of 138 
[24.6%]; P = .004) and most severe (48 of 132 [36.4%] vs 30 of 138 [21.7%]; P = .008) NRS 
pain measures for the past week. Similar differences were found at 6 months for the current 
(52 of 117 [44.4%] vs 34 of 135 [25.2%]; P = .001) and most severe (42 of 117 [35.9%] vs 
30 of 135 [22.2%]; P = .02) (Table 3) NRS pain measures. We also evaluated a more 
stringent 50% improvement on the average (21 of 132 [15.9%] vs 14 of 138 [10.1%]; P = .
16), current (43 of 132 [32.6%] vs 22 of 138 [15.9%]; P = .001), and most severe (21 of 132 
[15.9%] vs 12 of 138 [8.7%]; P = .07) NRS pain measures and found a significant difference 
between groups for current pain only at program completion. The intervention group had a 
higher proportion achieving a 50% improvement at 6 months for the average (29 of 117 
[24.8%] vs 18 of 135 [13.3%]; P = .02) and current (41 of 117 [35.0%] vs 28 of 135 
[20.7%]; P = .01) but not most severe (25 of 117 [21.4%] vs 17 of 135 [12.6%]; P = .06) 
NRS pain measures.
We assessed the global impression of change scores at program completion (Figure 2). The 
intervention participants reported more improvement in their back pain symptoms compared 
with the control participants (P < .001). At 8 weeks, 106 of 132 participants (80.3%) in the 
intervention program had at least minimal improvement, compared with 51 of 138 (37.0 %) 
in the control program. In the control program, 84 participants (61.0 %) reported no change 
and 3 (2.2 %) reported worsened symptoms. Notably, 54 participants in the intervention 
group (40.9%) were much or very much improved compared with 9 (6.5%) in the control 
group. This difference persisted at 6 months in the intervention group, with a greater number 
of participants reporting worsening symptoms in the control group (eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement). Credibility and expectancy of the programs to reduce back pain was obtained 
at baseline, with no difference between groups (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Secondary outcome measures are also presented in Table 2. The Global Health Composite 
and Physical Health Composite scores of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory by 6 months 
improved an additional 0.2 (−1.9 to 2.4) points and −0.01 (−1.9 to 1.8) points, respectively, 
for the intervention group. The improvement in pain self-efficacy subscales at 8 weeks was 
not sustained at the 6-month assessment. Pain catastrophizing effect sizes were −0.19 and 
0.05 at 8 weeks and 6 months, respectively. The intervention showed no improvement in 
self-reported mindfulness or depressive symptoms.

 Discussion
We found that the intervention group significantly improved in short-term function at 8 
weeks, but the functional improvement was not sustained. The intervention group also 
showed significantly reduced current and most severe pain for the past week during the 
course of the 6-month follow-up. Although some secondary outcomes such as pain self-
efficacy showed improvement in the intervention compared with the control group 
immediately after program completion, these differences were not sustained. Self-reported 
mindfulness did not change between groups, and changes in quality of life and pain 
catastrophizing did not reach clinical significance.
Preserving physical function with aging is critical to maintaining independence, because loss 
of independence is arguably one of the most feared consequences of aging. Learning 
mindfulness resulted in a clinically meaningful mean RMDQ improvement of −3.4 points, 
but by 6 months, the comparison group had also improved by a mean of −2.8 points. This 
improvement corresponded to 49.2% and 48.9% of participants in the respective groups with 
a clinically meaningful improvement in function. Physical activity was not a part of either 
program, although both groups learned a 10-minute chair stretching exercise during class 3.
The mindfulness group also had a statistically and clinically significant 30% improvement in 
current and most severe (in the past week) pain intensity compared with the control group. 
These findings held up for current pain, when a 50% improvement was determined. This 
amount of improvement in pain is consistent with a patient-centered view of successful pain 
relief.26 However, many therapies do not achieve this level of pain reduction. A 2006 
Cochrane Review of acetaminophen vs placebo for hip or knee osteoarthritis pain27 found 
that patients experienced a statistically significant reduction with multiple methods used to 
evaluate pain compared with placebo, with the relative change from baseline of 5%. A 2005 
meta-analysis of exercise therapy for nonspecific LBP28 found that the therapy was effective 
relative to comparisons and that the pooled mean improvement for patients was 13.3 of 100 
points for pain and 6.9 of 100 points for function.
Participants also perceived improvement in pain as a result of the intervention. One hundred 
six participants (80.3%) described improvement in their back pain symptoms immediately 
after the 8-week intervention compared with 51 (37.0%) in the control group. At 6 months, 
89 (76.1%) stated at least minimal improvement compared with 57 (42.2%) in the control 
group.
The 8-week mind-body program resulted in an increase in pain self-efficacy immediately 
after program completion. A recent meta-analysis found that higher levels of self-efficacy 
were associated with decreased impairment, affective distress, and pain severity among 
patients with chronic pain.29 Improving self-efficacy is an important component of teaching 
patients how to cope with pain. Our intervention program successfully accomplished this 
coping, but self-efficacy improved in the control group by 6 months, so that the difference in 
improvement between groups was not sustained.
We measured the effect of the mind-body program on psychological measures, mood, and 
quality of life. By 6 months, we found small changes that were significant but not clinically

 meaningful. At baseline, the sample was psychologically robust, with low scores for 
depressive symptoms that may explain the lack of change in both groups’ scores over time. 
In addition, mindfulness scores indicated a high level of self-reported mindfulness at 
baseline. This level of mindfulness is likely the reason why we did not see a significant 
difference between groups at program completion, despite qualitative reports by participants 
of increased mindfulness after learning to meditate. The pilot work6 also found this change. 
Further refinement of mindfulness measures is needed to capture changes in mindfulness in 
the older population.
Our study was conducted in Western Pennsylvania and had a greater proportion of women, 
which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Intervention participants received 
information on a mind-body approach to pain reduction, whereas the comparison group did 
not receive education about pain, which may have biased responses to measures. Expectation 
of a positive treatment effect on pain was similar at baseline for both groups. Participation 
rates in the 8-week programs were high for each group (mean number of classes attended for 
each group was 6.6), but booster session attendance was low for both groups, which may 
have influenced responses over time. Our study also included 80 African American 
participants (28.4%), which is unusual for mind-body studies that do not specifically target 
racial or ethnic minorities. The participation of a diverse sample may be a reflection of the 
interest in older adults in effective treatments for pain relief regardless of race or ethnicity.
Conclusions
We found that an 8-week mind-body program that taught mind-fulness meditation methods 
resulted in significant improvements in short-term physical function and long-term current 
and most severe pain intensity in the past week. The functional improvement was not 
sustained. Our clinical trial suggests that mindful-ness has a role in the treatment of chronic 
LBP in the older adult. Refinement of the mindfulness program could focus on enhancing 
the durability of functional improvement.

 Key Points
Question: Does a mind-body program improve function and reduce pain in older adults 
with chronic low back pain?
Findings: This randomized clinical trial of older adults compared a mindfulness 
meditation program and an education program. At program completion, function 
improved in the intervention group; current and most severe pain in the past week also 
improved significantly. Only current and most severe pain showed significant 
improvement at 6 months.
Meaning: A mind-body program may improve short-term function and provide some 
long-term pain relief.

 Figure 2. Global Impression of Change Findings
Participants in both groups answered the question “How much have your back symptoms 
changed as a result of the treatment provided in this study?” Assessment was performed at 
the end of each program (8 weeks). Improvement in back pain symptoms among the 
intervention participants was significantly greater than among control participants (P < .
001).
