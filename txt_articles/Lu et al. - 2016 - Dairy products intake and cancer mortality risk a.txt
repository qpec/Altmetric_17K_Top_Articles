Abstract
Background: Dairy products are major components of daily diet and the association between consumption of
dairy products and public health issues has captured great attention. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis
to investigate the association between dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk.
Methods: After a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE, 11 population-based cohort studies involving 778,929
individuals were considered eligible and included in the analyses. Data were extracted and the association between
dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk was estimated by calculating pooled relative risks (RRs) and corresponding
95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses based on regions, genders and dairy types
were performed as well. Potential dose–response relationship was further explored by adopting the generalized least
squares (GLST) method.
Results: Total dairy products intake was not associated with all cancer mortality risk, with the pooled RR of 0.99 (95 %
CI 0.92–1.07, p = 0.893). Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled RRs were 0.97 (95 % CI 0.92–1.03, p = 0.314) for milk,
0.88 (95 % CI 0.71–1.10, p = 0.271) for yogurt, 1.23 (95 % CI 0.94–1.61, p = 0.127) for cheese and 1.13 (95 % CI 0.89–1.44,
p = 0.317) for butter in male and female, however the pooled RR was 1.50 (95 % CI 1.03–2.17, p = 0.032) for whole milk in
male, which was limited to prostate cancer. Further dose–response analyses were performed and we found
that increase of whole milk (serving/day) induced elevated prostate cancer mortality risk significantly, with the
RR of 1.43 (95 % CI 1.13–1.81, p = 0.003).
Conclusions: Total dairy products intake have no significant impact on increased all cancer mortality risk, while low
total dairy intake even reduced relative risk based on the non-linear model. However, whole milk intake in
men contributed to elevated prostate cancer mortality risk significantly. Furthermore, a linear dose–response
relationship existed between increase of whole milk intake and increase of prostate cancer mortality risk.

Background
Dairy products are major components of daily diet and
due to their abundant nutrient elements such as protein,
fat, minerals and vitamins, they are listed as core parts
of dietary recommendation worldwide [1]. The propor-
tion of dairy consumption was steadily increasing in sev-
eral countries such as Japan since the past few decades
[2]. Due to the large amount of dairy products intake in
our daily life and their complex composition, the
emerging role of dairy products has draw researchers’
attention extensively in public health.
It was universally acknowledged that dairy products
intake was closely related to certain health issues. On
the one hand, nutrients from dairy products were benefi-
cial for chronic diseases such as cancer. For instance,
casein was proved to have potential antimutagenic [3]
and anticarcinogenic properties [4], while whey protein
hydrolysate
was
demonstrated
to
protect
against
chemical-induced mammary tumor in rats [5]. On the
other hand, some studies drew opposite conclusions.

 Park et al. confirmed that the milk protein casein pro-
moted the proliferation of prostate cancer cells through
in vitro assay [6]. Kroenke et al. harbored the view that
high-fat dairy intake was associated with poor prognosis
after breast cancer diagnosis, however no significant ef-
fect was found with respect to low-fat dairy intake [7].
Yang et al. demonstrated that among men with non-
metastatic prostate cancer, post diagnostic dairy prod-
ucts intake increased prostate cancer-specific mortality
risk and all-cause mortality risk [8]. In the aspect of can-
cer incidence risk, Huncharek et al. stated that higher
consumption of milk or dairy products reduced colon
cancer incidence risk [9], while Faber et al. suggested
that dairy products increased risk of ovarian cancer
modestly [10].
A few studies have conducted meta-analyses to investi-
gate the correlation between dairy products intake and
cancer incidence risk in colorectal [11], prostate [12], pan-
creatic [13], gastric [14] and ovarian cancers [15], never-
theless the relationship between dairy products intake and
cancer mortality risk was diverse and inconsistent across
individual studies, which has not been discussed systemat-
ically yet. Therefore, we conducted the meta-analysis to
comprehensively explore this issue.
Materials and methods
Literature search
This meta-analysis was designed, conducted and reported
according to PRISMA statements [16]. Systematic litera-
ture search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE data-
base up to May 2016. The following searching strategy
was adopted in PubMed: “Dairy Products” [Mesh] AND
“Neoplasms” [Mesh] AND (“survival” OR “mortality” OR
“death” OR “HR” OR “RR” OR “OR” OR “hazard ratio”
OR “relative risk” OR “odds ratio”), and similar strategy
was adopted in EMBASE: ‘dairy’ AND (‘neoplasms’ OR
‘neoplasia’ OR ‘cancer’ OR ‘tumor‘OR ‘tumour’) AND
(‘survival’ OR ‘mortality’ OR ‘death’ OR ‘hr’ OR ‘rr’ OR ‘or’
OR ‘hazard ratio’ OR ‘relative risk’ OR ‘odds ratio’). Only
publications with full texts in English were taken into
consideration. To avoid potentially missing studies during
the primary search, the references of pertinent articles
and relevant reviews were also scanned manually. The
retrieved literatures were examined in detail to exclude
potential duplications or repetitive data.
Study selection
Duplicated studies were first excluded, then titles and
abstracts were carefully scanned. Next full texts of po-
tentially qualified studies were reviewed. We included
studies if they met all the following criteria: (1) the stud-
ies of interest were dairy products intake; (2) the studies
were population-based cohort studies and reported can-
cer mortality data; (3) relative risk (RR), hazard ratio
(HR) or odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95 % confidence
interval (CI) adjusted for multivariable factors were
available or could be calculated; (4) original articles with
full texts in English. Studies were excluded according to
the following criteria: (1) reviews, letters, unpublished
data or comments; (2) those published in languages
other than English; (3) not population-based cohort
studies; (4) RR, HR or OR estimates with 95 % CI were
not available or could not be calculated.
Data extraction
The study quality assessment was performed according
to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [17]. Two reviewers (Dr.
Yihua Wu and Dr. Wei Lu) extracted data using a stan-
dardized data extraction table independently. Any dis-
crepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. Information
extracted from each eligible study included the following
items: first author, country, original study design, num-
ber of participants, gender, age, follow-up duration, dairy
product types, group cut-off value, cancer types, end-
points, adjusted factors and study quality assessment.
RR, HR or OR estimates with 95 % CI with regard to dif-
ferent types of dairy products and doses were recorded
respectively. The most completely adjusted estimate was
extracted if several risk estimates were available.
Data synthesis and statistical analyses
The random-effect model was applied to calculate pooled
RRs, 95 % CI and p value for heterogeneity. RRs compar-
ing the highest intake category with the lowest intake
category were combined across studies to generate the
summary associations. The extent of heterogeneity across
studies was examined using the I2 test [18] and I2 > 50 %
together with p < 0.05 indicated significant heterogeneity.
In order to validate the stability of outcomes in the meta-
analysis, sensitivity analyses were performed by including
studies which only reported all cancer mortality. Sequen-
tial omission of each individual study was also performed,
while subgroup analyses were carried out to investigate
the impact of regions, dairy product types and genders on
cancer mortality. Funnel plots were constructed to assess
the publication bias, meanwhile the Begg’s rank correl-
ation test and Egger’s regression test was adopted to test
the asymmetry and p < 0.1 indicated statistically significant
publication bias [19].
We then looked for potential dose–response relation-
ship between dairy products intake and cancer mortality
risk using the generalized least squares(GLST) method
for trend estimation of summarized data [20]. The doses
reported in each study were first converted to servings/
day, respectively. Kelemen’s study was excluded from
dose–response analysis because dairy intakes were re-
ported in densities (servings/1000 kcal). Bonthuis’s
study was also excluded because dairy intakes were

 reported in g/day. The average of the lower and upper
limits in each category were calculated and recorded as
the mid-point dose. For open-ended intervals, we esti-
mated the mid-point dose equaled to 1.5 times the lower
limits. A potential curvilinear relationship was assessed
using restricted cubic splines with four knots at fixed per-
centiles (5, 35, 65 and 90 %) of the distribution [20]. For
model verification, we used χ2 test and a p value for a
non-linear relationship was calculated by testing the null
hypothesis that the coefficient of the second spline was
equal to zero. Non-linear model was applied in the first
place if model verification indicated significance (p < 0.05),
otherwise linear model was adopted. The dose–response
curves containing RRs with 95 % CI for each dairy product
type were constructed, respectively. Heterogeneity was
tested using I2 test and I2 > 50 % together with p < 0.05
indicated significant heterogeneity.
All analyses were conducted using Stata software (ver-
sion 13.0; StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and the
significance level was set to p < 0.05 unless specified.
Results
Literature search
We identified 1031 publications after searching PubMed
and 1625 publications in EMBASE. First of all 172 dupli-
cated studies were removed, followed by the exclusion of
2462 studies after reviewing abstracts and titles carefully.
After full-text review of the remaining 22 articles, an-
other 11 studies were excluded for the following reasons:
six articles provided insufficient data, four only reported
cancer incidence risk and one conference article. Refer-
ences of pertinent articles and relevant reviews were
also scanned manually. Finally, the remaining 11 studies
[21–31] with 778,929 participants were included in the
following analyses (Fig. 1).
Description of the included studies
Characteristics of the included studies were shown in
Table 1. In brief, 11 studies were all population-based co-
hort studies, five were from America, three from Japan,
one from Australia, one from Europe and one was multi-
ethnic. However, Wang’s study and Kojima’s study were all
from Japan Collaborative Cohort Study, and Wang fo-
cused on the correlation between milk consumption and
all cancer mortality, while Kojima focused on the relation-
ship between different types of dairy products consump-
tion and colorectal cancer mortality. In addition, cancer
types were various across studies. Dairy product types
included total dairy, milk, yogurt, cheese, butter, whole
milk and skim/low-fat milk. It was noteworthy that two
studies reported prostate cancer, which was further dis-
cussed in the subgroup analyses. The quality assessment
of each study was performed according to the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale, as shown in Table 2.
Association between total dairy products intake and
cancer mortality risk
In each individual study, RRs of the highest total dairy
products intake group versus the control group were in-
troduced. For the association between total dairy prod-
ucts intake and all cancer mortality, ten studies except
Kojima’ study were included and the pooled RR was 0.99
(95 % CI 0.92–1.07, p = 0.893), as shown in Fig. 2a.
No significant heterogeneity across studies was observed
(I2 = 39.8 %, p = 0.092). Begg’s funnel plot and the Egger’s

 publication bias. The shape of Begg’s funnel plot showed
no evident asymmetry (Fig. 2b), beyond that Egger’s test
also suggested no publication bias existed (p = 0.947).
Sensitivity analyses were performed by including stud-
ies which only reported all cancer mortality (Fig. 2c),
and the pooled RR was 0.99 (95 % CI 0.95–1.03, p = 0.679).
Sequential omission of each individual study was also
performed, as shown in Fig. 2d, the result pattern was not
changed by removing single study each time.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses were conducted according to different
regions, dairy product types and genders. Initially, regions
were categorized into America, countries other than Amer-
ica and Asia when we explored the association between
total dairy intake and cancer mortality risk. We found the
pooled RRs were 0.90 (95 % CI 0.67–1.21, p = 0.484) in
America, 1.00 (95 % CI 0.95–1.04, p = 0.834) in countries
other than America and 0.97 (95 % CI 0.92–1.02, p = 0.239)
in Asia, which was in consistent with the above results.
Dairy product types were then categorized into milk,
yogurt, cheese, butter, whole milk and skim/low-fat milk.
In both genders, the pooled RRs were 0.97 (95 % CI 0.92–
1.03, p = 0.314) for milk, 0.88 (95 % CI 0.71–1.10, p =
0.271) for yogurt, 1.23 (95 % CI 0.94–1.61, p = 0.127) for
cheese and 1.13 (95 % CI 0.89–1.44, p = 0.317) for butter,
proving that intake of these dairy products was not associ-
ated with cancer mortality risk significantly (Table 3).
However, it was interesting to find that whole milk intake

 contributed to elevated cancer mortality risk significantly,
with the pooled RR of 1.50 (95 % CI 1.03–2.17, p = 0.032),
which was only limited to prostate cancer. In accordance
with this finding, skim/low-fat milk intake was not associ-
ated with prostate mortality risk, with the pooled RR of
1.00 (95 % CI 0.75–1.33, p = 0.985).
Dose–response analyses
To begin with, the non-linear model between total dairy
products intake and cancer mortality risk was con-
structed and χ2 test was used for model significance veri-
fication, which revealed the existence of a non-linear
association between them (χ2 = 8.98, p = 0.030). The
dose–response curves containing RRs with 95 % CI and
doses were constructed (Fig. 3a), suggesting that low
total dairy products intake may be protective against
cancer related death, but high total dairy products intake
did not have the same effect.
For each dairy type, we adopted the linear model as
well to assess RR due to increase of dairy products,
which indicated that increase of total dairy, milk, yogurt,
cheese, butter or skim/low-fat milk (serving/day) was
not associated with elevated cancer mortality risk (Figs. 3b
and 4 and Table 4). Nevertheless increase of whole milk
(serving/day) contributed to elevated prostate cancer
mortality risk significantly, with the RR of 1.43 (95 % CI
1.13–1.81, p = 0.003), which was in consistent with the
previous subgroup analyses results.
Discussion
Since dairy products contain complex nutrient compos-
ition and the amount of dairy products consumption is
huge in our daily life, a number of studies have pointed
out that dairy products may have impact on health is-
sues such as obesity [32], diabetes [33, 34], cancers [10]
and coronary heart disease [35, 36]. However, whether
dairy products play a beneficial or detrimental role still
remained controversial, largely depending on the types
of dairy products and diseases. In view of this, we carried
out this meta-analysis to comprehensively explore the
association between dairy products intake and cancer
mortality risk.
The current analyses showed that higher total dairy,
milk, yogurt, butter and skim/low-fat milk intake was
not associated with increased cancer mortality risk,

 while exposure to highest dose of whole milk intake in-
creased about 50 % of prostate cancer mortality risk. By
constructing a non-linear dose–response model, we con-
cluded that low total dairy products intake may be pro-
tective against cancer related death, however high dose
of total dairy products did not have the protective effect.
Through a linear dose–response model, we found that
increase of whole milk (serving/day) contributed to
elevated prostate cancer mortality risk significantly,
while other dairy types did not show the same effect.
This might be explained by the hypothesis that luxuriant
calcium contained in whole milk would increase the risk
of prostate cancer by inhibiting the potential anti pros-
tate carcinogenic nutrient 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [37].
Besides, high animal fat intake also contributed to poor
prostate
cancer
mortality
after
diagnosis
[38,
39].

 However, although our meta-analysis shed new light on
this issue, more future work remained to be done due to
complex components of dairy products.
Our study had several crucial strengths. We conducted
this thorough systematic search and applied comprehen-
sive analytical approaches to assess the association be-
tween dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk. In
addition, the studies we included were all population-
based cohort studies of high quality. Furthermore, sensi-
tivity analyses and sufficient subgroup analyses were also
conducted to ensure the reliability of this study. Finally,
we used a non-linear or linear model to fit the dose–re-
sponse relationship between dairy products intake and
cancer mortality risk. The methods of this study were
rigorous and were based on guidelines for conducting
the present study.
However, the current study was restricted by several
limitations. First, the number of studies involved was
relatively small, partly because cancer incidence risk ra-
ther than mortality risk was much more widely reported,
thus the association between each type of dairy products
and every specific cancer mortality risk was not available
because of inadequate data. Second, most of the in-
cluded studies were performed in Asia or America, and
the studies conducted in America did not confine their
cohorts to certain ethnic groups, hence the conclusions
should be taken cautiously for other ethnic populations.
We suggested further population-based cohort studies
which investigate the association between dairy products
intake and cancer mortality in each individual ethnic
should be conducted. Finally a few studies reported dif-
ferent doses of highest dairy intake, which was further
discussed in the dose–response analysis.
Conclusions
On the basis of the results above, we confirmed that
total dairy products intake was not associated with in-
creased cancer mortality risk in both genders, yet low
total dairy products intake even reduced relative risk
based on the dose–response analyses. However, whole
milk intake in men contributed to elevated prostate can-
cer mortality risk. Furthermore, the linear dose–re-
sponse relationship existed between increase of whole
milk intake and prostate cancer mortality risk.
