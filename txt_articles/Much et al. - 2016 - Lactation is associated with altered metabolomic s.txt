Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Lactation for >3 months in women with ges-
tational diabetes is associated with a reduced risk of type 2
diabetes that persists for up to 15 years postpartum. However,
the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We examined wheth-
er in women with gestational diabetes lactation for >3 months is
associated with altered metabolomic signatures postpartum.
Methods We enrolled 197 women with gestational diabetes at
a median of 3.6 years (interquartile range 0.7–6.5 years) after
delivery. Targeted metabolomics profiles (including 156 me-
tabolites) were obtained during a glucose challenge test.
Comparisons of metabolite concentrations and ratios between
women who lactated for >3 months and women who lactated
for ≤3 months or not at all were performed using linear regres-
sion with adjustment for age and BMI at the postpartum visit,
time since delivery, and maternal education level, and correc-
tion for multiple testing. Gaussian graphical modelling was
used to generate metabolite networks.
Results Lactation for >3 months was associated with a higher
total lysophosphatidylcholine/total phosphatidylcholine ratio;
in women with short-term follow-up, it was also associated
with lower leucine concentrations and a lower total branched-
chain amino acid concentration. Gaussian graphical model-
ling identified subgroups of closely linked metabolites within
phosphatidylcholines and branched-chain amino acids that
were affected by lactation for >3 months and have been
linked to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in previous
studies.
Conclusions/interpretation Lactation for >3 months in wom-
en with gestational diabetes is associated with changes in the
metabolomics profile that have been linked to the early path-
ogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Postpartum Outcomes in Women with
Gestational Diabetes and their Offspring
Introduction
The beneficial effects of lactation are widely considered to be
positive health outcomes in the child [1, 2]. However, there is
increasing evidence to suggest that lactation also has long-
term health benefits for the mother. We recently reported that
lactation in women with gestational diabetes was associated
with a considerable long-term reduction in the risk of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes postpartum [3]. This risk reduction was
most pronounced in women who lactated for >3 months, and
the beneficial effect of lactation on the risk of diabetes was
apparent for up to 15 years postpartum [3]. However, the
mechanisms that may explain this protective association are
unclear [4].
A high pre-pregnancy BMI and extreme weight gain dur-
ing pregnancy were associated with both a shorter duration of
lactation and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum
[5, 6]. A lactating mother transfers 1674–2510 kJ (400–
600 kcal) per day to her infant, which may facilitate postpar-
tum weight loss compared with non-lactating mothers.
Consequently, it was hypothesised that the association be-
tween duration of lactation and maternal type 2 diabetes risk
may be confounded by maternal BMI [7, 8]. However, in our
previous analysis [3] and in studies of healthy women [9, 10],
adjusting for BMI had no impact or a very small impact on the
association between lactation and type 2 diabetes risk.
Moreover, a recent population-based study demonstrated that
healthy lifestyle behaviours, which may be more prevalent in
lactating mothers, did not confound the association between
lactation and type 2 diabetes risk [10].
Several studies conducted during or shortly after lactation
have revealed that fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood
glucose and insulin concentrations were lower [11, 12], ath-
erogenic blood lipid concentrations were lower [13] and insu-
lin sensitivity was improved [11] in healthy, middle-aged
lactating women compared with non-lactating women.
These short-term observations may be explained by metabolic
adaptions to lactogenesis, particularly the diversion of glucose
by insulin-independent pathways for uptake by the mammary
gland [14]. Furthermore, evidence from animal and human
studies supports the hypothesis that prolactin, a lactation-
related hormone, plays important regulatory roles in insulin
secretion and glucose homeostasis [15–18]. However, very
few studies have investigated the biochemical effects of lacta-
tion in mothers with gestational diabetes after cessation of
lactation [19].
In the present study, we used a targeted metabolomics ap-
proach to evaluate metabolomic signatures before and after a
glucose challenge in women with prior gestational diabetes.
Our objective was to investigate whether lactation for
>3 months is associated with changes in such signatures up
to several years after cessation of lactation.
Methods
Participants
We used a dataset of 209 women with a documented diagnosis
of gestational diabetes during their most recent pregnancy for
the present study. All women underwent an OGTT between
2008 and 2013, either to assess eligibility for the Postpartum
Intervention in Women with Gestational Diabetes Using
Insulin (PINGUIN) interventional trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01018602; n=88) or during the clinical study visit of
the observational Postpartum Outcomes in Women with
Gestational Diabetes and their Offspring (POGO) study
(n=121) [20]. The ongoing PINGUIN trial enrolled women
with insulin-treated gestational diabetes within 9 months of
pregnancy if they ceased lactation, had a non-diabetic glucose
tolerance at enrolment and were islet-autoantibody negative.
Blood samples obtained from women participating at the
PINGUIN screening visit were used to investigate ‘short-
term’ associations between lactation and metabolomics signa-
tures. The observational POGO study enrolled women with
gestational diabetes at 1–10 years postpartum to monitor the
development of type 2 diabetes in the women and obesity in
the offspring [20]. Blood samples obtained from these women
were used to investigate ‘long-term’ associations between lac-
tation and metabolomics signatures. Participants of the POGO
study who were already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
(n=11) or had not yet terminated lactation (n=1) were ex-
cluded from the present analyses.
Plasma samples for glucose and insulin assessment and
metabolomic profiling were collected at 0, 30 and 120 min
during the 75 g OGTT (Dextro O.G.T.; Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) from all women. The time from blood
collection to centrifugation was <40 min. Plasma was
2194

 transferred into pre-cooled collection tubes, placed on ice and
immediately stored at −80°C.
All women attended the clinical study centre of the Institute
of Diabetes Research, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich,
Germany. To ensure standardisation within and between stud-
ies, staff were trained to follow standardised procedures with
respect to data and sample collection. All participants provid-
ed written informed consent. This study was approved by the
Ethical Committee of the Technische Universität München,
Munich, Germany (PINGUIN study no. 1832/07 and POGO
study no. 2937).
Questionnaire and interview data
Information on lactation duration was collected by interview
during the study visits. Women were asked whether they had
ever breastfed their child (yes/no) and, if yes, whether the
duration of breastfeeding was >3 months. Breastfeeding was
defined as feeding the newborn either exclusively with breast
milk or in addition to other fluids or complementary food.
Information on the treatment of gestational diabetes (diet
and insulin treatment), BMI at the first antenatal visit and
maternal age at delivery were extracted from the participants’
obstetric records. The maternal education level was assessed
by a questionnaire during the study visit and classified as high
(i.e. university qualifications), middle (i.e. secondary school
qualifications) or low (i.e. no qualifications or only primary
school certificates).
Anthropometric measurements
During the postpartum study visit, anthropometric data were
collected by trained staff using standardised protocols.
Maternal weight and height measured in light clothes and
without shoes were used to calculate BMI.
Measurement of plasma metabolites
All plasma samples were measured in two batches comprising
four and five plates. Plasma metabolites were measured by
electrospray ionisation (ESI) flow injection analysis tandem
MS (FIA-MS/MS) and ESI liquid chromatography tandem
MS (LC-MS/MS) using AbsoluteIDQ p180 kits (Biocrates
Life Sciences, Innsbruck, Austria). This assay can simulta-
neously quantify 188 metabolites in 10 μl plasma, including
40 acylcarnitines (Cx:y, where x indicates the total number of
carbons and y the number of double bonds in the fatty acid
side chains), 21 amino acids (19 proteinogenic plus citrulline
and ornithine), 21 biogenic amines, total hexoses, 90
glycerophospholipids (14 lysophosphatidylcholines [lyso-
PCs] and 76 phosphatidylcholines [PCs]), and 15
sphingolipids. All analytical procedures were performed as
previously described [21, 22]. Briefly, 10 μl plasma was
pipetted onto a filter which is incorporated into a 96-well
sandwich plate and already contains internal standards stable
isotope labelled with stable isotope. Amino acids and biogenic
amines were derivatised with 5% phenylisothiocyanate re-
agent. Metabolites and internal standards were extracted with
5 mmol/l ammonium acetate in methanol and the solution
centrifuged through a filter membrane. For FIA-MS/MS mea-
surements, an aliquot of the resulting solution was diluted in
running solvent; for LC-MS/MS, another aliquot was diluted
in water.
Quantification of metabolite concentrations and quality as-
sessment were performed with Analyst 1.5 and 1.6 software
(for LC-MS/MS) or MetIDQ software (for FIA- and LC-MS/
MS), which is an integral part of the AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit.
The concentration of each metabolite is calculated with refer-
ence to appropriate internal standards set by the manufacturer
and are reported in μmol/l. The assays were performed at the
Genome Analysis Centre of the Helmholtz Zentrum München.
A total of 32 metabolites had a CVof >25% in 50 aliquots
of a reference plasma sample, which were measured along
with the study samples for quality control. These metabolites
were therefore excluded from further analyses, leaving a total
of 156 metabolites for analysis. In addition to these, we cal-
culated 39 derived traits as sums and ratios of metabolites
representing specific metabolite classes (e.g. branched-chain
amino acids [BCAAs]) or metabolic processes (e.g. carnitine
palmitoyltransferase I [CPT-I] activity via the [C16+C18]:C0
ratio; electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table 1) [23].
Measurement of insulin and plasma glucose
Plasma insulin was analysed by immunoassay using the AIA-
360 Analyzer (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma glu-
cose was measured routinely (Medizet, Munich, Germany)
using a photometer (Architect cSystem, Abbott Park, IL,
USA). The HOMA-IR index was calculated according to
Ekelund et al [24]. The Matsuda–Defronza estimation of in-
sulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated according to
Vukovic et al [25].
Statistical analysis
Data collected in the PINGUIN and POGO studies were
analysed both together and separately to assess short- and
long-term associations, respectively, between lactation and
the HOMA-IR, ISI and metabolic profiles. Comparisons be-
tween the PINGUIN and POGO studies were performed using
the Mann–Whitney U test or χ2 test. For metabolomics
analysis, samples were randomly distributed across plates (as
described above). If a sample taken at 30 or 120 min during an
OGTT was measured on a plate other than the one containing
the fasting sample from the same person, then each metabolite
in this sample was corrected by the ratio of the mean values for
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2193–2202
2195
 the metabolite in the fasting state in both plates to avoid possi-
ble batch effects. All metabolite concentrations, sums and ratios
were logarithmically transformed to base 10. Comparisons be-
tween women who lactated for >3 months and women who
lactated for ≤3 months or not at all were performed using pro-
files obtained at 0, 30 and 120 min during the OGTT to specif-
ically address the metabolomic response to a glucose challenge.
All comparisons were made using linear regression, with ad-
justment for age and BMI at the postpartum study visit, time
since delivery and maternal education level (high, middle,
low); a sensitivity analysis of insulin treatment and potential
batch effects was also performed. As ‘time since delivery’
completely separates participants from the two studies, we did
not additionally adjust for ‘study type’. Results were corrected
for multiple testing by dividing the 5% level of significance (α)
by the ‘effective number’ of independent tests, which was 67
for our data, according to the method of Li and Ji [26]. This
approach avoids using the overly conservative Bonferroni cor-
rection method for correlated data. Therefore, p values of
<0.00075 (i.e. α = 0.05/67) were considered statistically
significant.
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) [27] for single metab-
olites were calculated based on the full-order partial correlation
coefficient (r) values (i.e. pairwise correlations were corrected
for all remaining metabolites) for fasting metabolomic samples
from both studies combined. GGMs were corrected for age and
BMI at the study visit, time since delivery, educational level
and lactation by including the respective variables in the partial
correlation calculation. The GGM network was generated by
drawing a line between any two metabolites for which the
partial r value was significantly different from zero (at
α=0.05 with Bonferroni correction). Associations between
metabolite concentrations and lactation for >3 months were
visualised by colouring network nodes according to the
−log10 p value. To ensure a robust GGM with respect to
follow-up time, differences between the two subcohorts were
assessed using a permutation-based approach (see ESM Text).
Further, we used linear regression models to explore
whether HOMA-IR and ISI were associated with lactation
duration independently of BMI at the clinic visit, age, time
since delivery and educational level or with BCAA levels
independently of lactation duration.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS statistical
software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R
(version 3.0.0; http://cran.r-project.org) using the GeneNet
package [28]. Network colouring was done using Cytoscape
(version 2.8, http://chianti.ucsd.edu/Cyto-2_8_0/).
Results
Characteristics of the participants
Of the 197 women included in the analysis, 88 (45%) were
assessed shortly after delivery and cessation of lactation
(PINGUIN study) and 109 (55%) were assessed several years
postpartum (POGO study; Table 1). As a consequence of the
study designs, the time from delivery to postpartum assess-
ment of the metabolomic profiles was significantly shorter for
women from the PINGUIN study (median 0.7 years, inter-
quartile range [IQR] 0.4–0.7 years) than for those from the
POGO study (median 6.0 years, IQR 4.1–8.5 years).
Accordingly, women from the short-term follow-up cohort
were younger at the postpartum study visit compared with
women from the long-term follow-up cohort. The proportion
of women who reported that they lactated for >3 months was

 greater in the long-term than in the short-term follow-up co-
hort (81% vs 53%, p<0.0001). Postpartum BMI, the preva-
lence of obesity and educational level were similar for women
in both studies. Although women in the short-term follow-up
cohort were assessed nearer to delivery, their postpartum
change in BMI (ΔBMI=[BMI at follow-up visit] – [BMI in
early pregnancy]) was comparable with that observed in the
long-term follow-up cohort.
Metabolomic signatures of lactation for >3 months
Linear regression analysis of the total cohort revealed that
lactation for >3 months was significantly associated (all
p<0.00075) with higher total lyso-PC/total PC ratios at 30
and 120 min during the OGTT after adjusting for BMI,
age, time since delivery and educational level.
Additionally, in the subset with short-term follow-up, lac-
tation for >3 months was associated with a lower concen-
tration of leucine (a BCAA) and of total BCAAs (i.e. va-
line, leucine and isoleucine) at 30 min of the OGTT (all
p < 0.00075; Fig. 1 and ESM Table 2). These results were
very similar when the analyses were additionally adjusted
for insulin treatment and potential batch effects (data not
shown).
In the next step, we calculated a GGM based on
partial r values for fasting metabolomic samples of the

 total cohort to visualise networks between single metab-
olites and their association with lactation for >3 months
(Fig. 2). Within the network, we identified several clus-
ters of phospholipids, including lyso-PCs, diacyl-PCs
and acyl-alkyl-PCs that are affected by lactation for
>3 months. The network showed higher concentrations of
several lyso-PCs, lower concentrations of several diacyl-PCs
and, to a lesser extent, lower concentrations of acyl-alkyl-PCs
in women lactating for >3 months, although none of the differ-
ences in single metabolites had been significant at p<0.00075
in linear regression analyses. The diacyl-PCs and lyso-PCs that
differed between lactation for >3 months and lactation for
≤3 months were connected within smaller clusters of
glycerophospholipids. Lactation-associated differences in
glycerophospholipid concentrations were observed in the
fasting state (Fig. 2a) and at 30 and 120 min (Fig. 2b,c) during
the OGTT. These findings were similar with respect to follow-
up duration after delivery, although lactation for >3 months
seemed to be predominantly associated with lower concentra-
tions of several diacyl-PCs in the short-term follow-up group
and higher concentrations of lyso-PCs in the long-term follow-
up group. The network analysis further indicated strongly cor-
relations among levels of the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine and
valine, and these were lower in women lactating for >3 months.
Metabolite networks were not significantly different after cal-
culating separate GGMs for women lactating for ≤3 months
and women lactating for >3 months (ESM Text). Differences
in networks between the different follow-up groups were
negligible (ESM Text).
Associations of the ISI and HOMA-IR with BCAA levels
and lactation duration
The ISI was negatively associated (β = −1.96 [95% CI
−3.52, −0.40] per 100 μmol/l increase in BCAA) and the
HOMA-IR was positively associated (β = 0.68 [95% CI
0.37, 0.98] per 100 μmol/l increase in BCAA) with
BCAA levels after adjustment for lactation duration.
Lactation for >3 months was not associated with the ISI
and HOMA-IR after adjusting for BMI at the clinic visit,
age, time since delivery and educational level in the total
cohort nor in separate analyses of the short-term and long-
term follow-up cohorts (Table 2).
Discussion
In women with prior gestational diabetes, lactation for
>3 months was significantly associated with a higher total
lyso-PC/total PC ratio at 30 and 120 min during an OGTT
within 3.6 years postpartum, and also with lower leucine and
lower total BCAA (valine, leucine, isoleucine) concentrations
at 30 min within 0.7 years postpartum. Lactation for
>3 months was not associated with insulin sensitivity (ISI)
or insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
Glycerophospholipid and BCAA levels are reported to be
related to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity
[29–33]. Moreover, population-based studies of previously
healthy adults revealed that low lyso-PC C18:2 concentra-
tions were associated with an increased risk of pre-type 2
diabetes and type 2 diabetes [30, 34], while high concen-
trations of several diacyl-PCs (C32:1, C36:1, C38:3 and
C40:5) were associated with a risk of type 2 diabetes inde-
pendent of dietary, lifestyle and anthropometric factors. In
our study, the total lyso-PC/total PC ratio was significantly
increased in women who had lactated for >3 months as a
consequence of higher concentrations of several lyso-PCs
and lower concentrations of several diacyl-PCs in these
women. However, these associations were not statistically
significant at the single metabolite level after correction for
multiple testing.
In our study, lactation for >3 months was associated with
lower leucine concentrations and total BCAA concentrations
at 30 min of the OGTT up to 0.7 years postpartum. A decrease
in plasma leucine concentrations after a glucose challenge has
been reported in healthy adults [35]. In contrast, increased
concentrations of (iso)leucine have been reported after a glu-
cose challenge and standardised meal challenge in individuals
with insulin resistance and in patients with type 2 diabetes [33,
36]. Furthermore, it was recently reported that pregnant wom-
en with high fasting plasma glucose concentrations also had
high fasting concentrations of several amino acids, including
leucine [37]. Higher fasting concentrations of BCAAs were
also found in individuals with type 2 diabetes and insulin
resistance [34, 38–40]. These findings indicate that alterations
in BCAA metabolism are associated with gestational diabetes,
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Clinical intervention
studies have also reported that decreased BCAA concentra-
tions following an intervention (e.g. gastric bypass surgery or
medical therapy) correlated with improvements in glucose
homeostasis [41, 42].
One hypothesis to explain how increased BCAA concen-
trations influence the risk of type 2 diabetes is that increased

 circulating concentrations of BCAAs interfere with fatty acid
oxidation, and thus decrease insulin sensitivity [40]. Recent
studies propose that the intermediate metabolites of BCAA
catabolism are associated with insulin sensitivity and type 2
diabetes and not the BCAA concentrations themselves [38,
39]. Indeed, in our study BCAA concentrations were associ-
ated with ISI and HOMA-IR and lactation for ≤3 months was
associated with increased BCAA concentrations early after
cessation of lactation. However, lactation for ≤3 months was
not associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, suggesting
that the mechanism responsible for diabetes protection by
prolonged lactation may be independent of insulin sensitivity
and that other mechanisms, possibly involving BCAAs, may
be more relevant.
Metabolites identified in previous metabolomics studies as
being associated with a risk of type 2 diabetes serve as bio-
markers for disturbed metabolic pathways in the early patho-
genesis of type 2 diabetes [34]. We argue that lactation for
>3 months may protect women with gestational diabetes from
later developing type 2 diabetes by either ‘resetting’ these
disturbed pathways or preventing further disturbances in some
pathways, specifically the phospholipid and BCAA pathways.
Moreover, we hypothesise that lactation-associated changes in
metabolomic signatures, particularly associated with PC me-
tabolism, may persist for several years postweaning because
the observed associations were independent of the time from
delivery to the postpartum assessment. However, the mecha-
nisms through which lactation affects these metabolic path-
ways are still unclear. Data from animal and human studies
suggest that lactation helps to reset maternal metabolism after
pregnancy by mobilising accumulated fat stores and reducing
adiposity [8]. However, it is notable that changes in the
metabolomic signatures of women who lactated for >3 months
were not attenuated after adjusting for maternal BMI.
To our knowledge, this was the first study to use a targeted
metabolomics approach to quantify a broad spectrum of lipids
and amino acids and to identify lactation-associated biochem-
ical changes in plasma samples collected from women with
prior gestational diabetes. The primary strength of our study is
the analysis of metabolomic signatures during an OGTT in a
well-characterised population of 197 women who were diag-
nosed with gestational diabetes using a standardised OGTT. In
addition, we had the opportunity to evaluate the short- and
long-term effects of prolonged lactation by including women
who participated in this study either soon or several years after
delivery.
A potential limitation of the study is that the duration of
lactation was retrospectively determined by interviews done at
a median of 3.6 years postpartum. Some studies suggest that
recall bias of lactation behaviour tends to increase with the
time elapsed since weaning: women who lactated for a short
period are more likely to exaggerate the duration of lactation,
while the opposite was observed for women who lactated for a
long period [43–45]. Moreover, lactating women tended to be
more health conscious, with better physical activity or dietary
behaviours [45], so we cannot exclude the possibility that
different lifestyle factors may have affected our results.
Notably, however, lifestyle behaviours did not affect the asso-
ciation between lactation and long-term protection against
type 2 diabetes in a recent population-based study [10].
Since all women were white, our results may not be transfer-
able to other racial or ethnic groups. All members of the subset
of women with short-term follow-up had insulin-treated ges-
tational diabetes and were therefore at a very high risk of
developing type 2 diabetes; their risk profile differs markedly
from that of women in the long-term follow-up group. On the
other hand, associations between lactation for >3 months and
metabolite levels did not change after adjusting for insulin
treatment. Based on a significance level of 0.00075 and a
desired statistical power of 80%, our setting enabled us to
identify group differences of 0.66 SDs or more for each me-
tabolite. Thus, we cannot preclude the possibility that we
failed to detect smaller associations for other metabolites.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that lactation
for >3 months may alter the metabolomic signature previously
reported to be associated with a decreased risk of type 2 dia-
betes, and that these alterations persist for several years post-
weaning. Therefore, the lower risk of type 2 diabetes con-
ferred by lactation may be mediated by several metabolic
pathways involved in early disease pathogenesis.
