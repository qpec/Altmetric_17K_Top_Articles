Abstract
Background
Despite substantial financial contributions by the United States President’s Malaria Initiative
(PMI) since 2006, no studies have carefully assessed how this program may have affected
important population-level health outcomes. We utilized multiple publicly available data
sources to evaluate the association between introduction of PMI and child mortality rates in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Methods and findings
We used difference-in-differences analyses to compare trends in the primary outcome of
under-5 mortality rates and secondary outcomes reflecting population coverage of malaria
interventions in 19 PMI-recipient and 13 non-recipient countries between 1995 and 2014.
The analyses controlled for presence and intensity of other large funding sources, individual
and household characteristics, and country and year fixed effects.
PMI program implementation was associated with a significant reduction in the annual
risk of under-5 child mortality (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96). Each dollar
of per-capita PMI expenditures in a country, a measure of PMI intensity, was also associ-
ated with a reduction in child mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.93). We estimated that the
under-5 mortality rate in PMI countries was reduced from 28.9 to 24.3 per 1,000 person-
years. Population coverage of insecticide-treated nets increased by 8.34 percentage points
(95% CI 0.86–15.83) and coverage of indoor residual spraying increased by 6.63 percent-
age points (95% CI 0.79–12.47) after PMI implementation. Per-capita PMI spending was
also associated with a modest increase in artemisinin-based combination therapy coverage
(3.56 percentage point increase, 95% CI −0.07–7.19), though this association was only mar-
ginally significant (p = 0.054). Our results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions
PMI may have significantly contributed to reducing the burden of malaria in SSA and reduc-
ing the number of child deaths in the region. Introduction of PMI was associated with
increased coverage of malaria prevention technologies, which are important mechanisms
through which child mortality can be reduced. To our knowledge, this study is the first to
assess the association between PMI and all-cause child mortality in SSA with the use of
appropriate comparison groups and adjustments for regional trends in child mortality.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Despite the considerable investment the US government has made in the President’s
Malaria Initiative (PMI) since 2006, no studies to date have evaluated its association
with population health outcomes.
• Previous evaluations have documented decreasing child mortality and increasing use of
key malaria interventions in PMI-recipient countries. Our study sought to determine
whether the trends in health outcomes in PMI-recipient countries differed significantly
from the trends in these outcomes in PMI non-recipient countries in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) over the past 2 decades.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used a study design that leveraged multiple publicly available data sources from
countries throughout SSA, spanning the years before and after PMI introduction, in
order to estimate association between the introduction of PMI and child mortality rates.
• Our dataset included 7,752,071 child-year observations from 2,112,951 individual chil-
dren who lived in 32 sub-Saharan countries, including all 19 PMI countries.
• We found that after adjusting for baseline differences between countries, overall time
trends, other funding sources, and individual characteristics, PMI was associated with
16% annual risk reduction in child mortality and increased population coverage of key
malaria prevention and treatment technologies.
• We tested the robustness of our results with a series of sensitivity analyses.

 What do these findings mean?
• The study provides evidence that introduction of PMI was associated with significant
reductions in child mortality in SSA, primarily through increased access to malaria pre-
vention technologies.
• Evidence from this study can be used to inform policy decisions about future funding
levels for malaria interventions.
• The interpretation of our study results rests on the assumption that there were no
important unmeasured variables that differentially affected mortality rates in PMI and
comparison countries during the study period.
Introduction
At the turn of the millennium, malaria was the leading cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), claiming 694,000 child lives annually [1] and accounting for nearly a quarter of
all under-5 deaths [2]. Reducing child mortality and lowering the burden of malaria were cen-
tral components of the Millennium Development Goals and the key mission of the Roll Back
Malaria Partnership [3, 4]. Since then, under-5 mortality has declined substantially in SSA,
with all-cause child mortality rates declining from an estimated 158 deaths per 1,000 live births
in 2000 to 82 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015 in malaria-endemic countries, when malaria
fell to the fourth leading cause of child deaths in SSA [1]. Understanding the role global poli-
cies and funding played in reducing malaria mortality, including changes in heath behaviors,
can be valuable as countries and global donors work toward the Sustainable Development
Goals, including the goal of eradicating malaria by 2030. While external funding remains a sig-
nificant source of total health expenditures in low-income countries [5], health aid donations
have stagnated since 2010 and future funding is surrounded by uncertainty [6]. The increas-
ingly limited resources for healthcare delivery in developing countries demand strong evi-
dence on the most effective and efficient ways to provide life-saving, evidence-based
prevention and treatment interventions to vulnerable populations.
The US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), launched in 2005 by President George W.
Bush and expanded by President Barack Obama, has been among the main sources of funding
for malaria interventions in SSA [1, 6, 7]. With an annual budget of over $500 million since
2010 [8], PMI has primarily focused on provision of 4 recommended, evidence-based malaria
interventions: insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) [9–11], rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-
based combination therapy (ACTs) [10, 12], intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
(IPTp) [11, 13–15], and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [11, 16]. Despite this sizable invest-
ment, the association between PMI, child mortality rates, and population-level coverage of key
malaria interventions has not been previously examined.
While PMI program evaluations show that all-cause child mortality declined significantly
in recipient countries [8, 17, 18], comparison groups are needed to determine whether these
reductions were due to expansion in PMI funding or other interventions instead, including
programs supported by the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global
Fund henceforth), the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), or domestic
investments. Previous studies have documented higher access to ITNs, ACTs, and IRS cover-
age in PMI-recipient countries [19–22] but have not compared these trends to non-recipient

 countries. More rigorous analysis of the association between PMI and key outcomes is needed
to assess whether PMI was successful at curbing child mortality through implementation of
evidence-based malaria interventions. We used data from 32 sub-Saharan countries spanning
nearly 20 years to determine the association between PMI and all-cause child mortality rates as
well as malaria prevention and treatment behaviors.
Methods
PMI began as a small program in 2006 with funding initially going to 3 countries and an
annual budget of $30 million. Within 2 years, PMI scaled-up to 15 focus countries and had an
annual budget of $300 million. By 2011, PMI expanded to 19 countries in SSA (Angola, Benin,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zim-
babwe) and had an annual budget of $600 million. Approximately 40% of PMI’s budget has
been allocated to procurement of commodities to prevent, diagnose, and treat malaria [8].
Since its inception, PMI has also focused on building capacity through training of healthcare
workforce, providing technical support, and strengthening supply chain systems.
PMI country selection was based on several criteria, including high malaria burden, govern-
ment capacity, potential for impact, willingness to partner with US government, national
malaria control policies consistent with the World Health Organization standards, and other
donor involvement in malaria control. Yet these criteria do not fully explain country selection.
Some countries with relatively low malaria prevalence were selected (e.g., Ethiopia at 3.4%
Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in 2- to 10-year-olds [PfPr2-10] in 2005 and Zimbabwe at
2.5% PfPr2-10 in 2005) whereas others with high malaria burden were not selected (e.g., Camer-
oon at 47.0% PfPr2-10 in 2005 and Burkina Faso at 55.4% PfPr2-10 in 2005). Cameroon and Bur-
kina Faso also score higher on World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators than do
Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. Thus, while selection process of PMI-recipient countries was not ran-
dom, it does not appear to have been systematically associated with malaria burden, gover-
nance, or health system performance. The analyses carried out in this study, described below,
include comparisons of recipient and non-recipient countries as well as tests for differential
impacts based on initial country characteristics.
Measures
Child mortality data. Child mortality data were obtained from 77 Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS), 14 Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS), and 5 AIDS Indicator Surveys
(AIS) in 32 countries in SSA. DHS, MIS, and AIS are nationally representative, cross-sectional
surveys that include common questions about birth dates and survival status of all births to
women of reproductive age (15–49 years) [23]. From these data, we constructed a longitudinal
cohort with annual observations for each live birth between 1995 and 2014. We used informa-
tion about the year of child’s birth, whether each child was alive at the time of the survey, and
how old a child was if s/he died to define the primary outcome, which was a binary indicator
of mortality in each year. We also extracted data about the child’s age and gender, mother’s
age, mother’s education, mother’s parity, household wealth, whether the head of household
was female, and whether the household was in rural area. We excluded from the analysis
malaria non-endemic countries (Lesotho), small island countries (Comoros, Sao Tome, and
Principe) and South Africa, because only one DHS from 1998 was available there. Additional
details about data structure are described in S1 Appendix.
Malaria interventions coverage data.
Secondary outcomes were defined based on coun-
try-level annual data about population coverage of key malaria prevention and treatment

 interventions, which we obtained from the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) [24]. MAP estimates
of ITN, ACT, and IRS coverage are based on household-level data from DHS, MIS, Multiple
Indicator Cluster Surveys, AIS, Malaria and Anemia Prevalence Survey, and the World Health
Organization, combined with national malaria control program data from 43 countries
between 2000 and 2015 [10]. The ITN estimate represents the proportion of people who slept
under an insecticide-treated bednet on any given night each year; the ACT estimate represents
the proportion of fever cases in under-5-year-olds receiving ACTs; and the IRS estimate repre-
sents the proportion of the population protected by indoor spraying of insecticides. We did
not find reliable data on rapid diagnostic tests and IPTp.
Exposure to PMI and other health aid
We measured receipt of donor funding by individual countries with 2 measures: a binary indi-
cator of whether a program provided funding to a given country in a given year and a continu-
ous measure of program intensity using per-capita disbursements in a given country and year.
The binary indicators of program activity were extracted from reports to US Congress. The
per-capita aid measures address the possibility that program activities vary in scope between
countries and within countries over time. These country-year data were obtained from pub-
licly available Development Assistance for Health 1990–2014 dataset, compiled by the Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [25]. We excluded 2013–2014 disbursements from
the analysis, as these data were not complete due to reporting lags. The IHME dataset distin-
guished between the funding source (country of origin), the distribution channel (bilateral ver-
sus multilateral versus private foundations), health focus area, and the recipient country.
Using these characteristics, we divided total development assistance for health into 6 categories
(details in the S1 Appendix): PMI (US bilateral aid for malaria); Global Fund malaria aid;
other malaria aid; PEPFAR (US bilateral aid for HIV/AIDS); Global Fund HIV/tuberculosis
aid; and all other health disbursements. These 6 categories summed to 100% of development
assistance for health provided to SSA that were captured in IHME dataset. All health disburse-
ments in this study are reported in 2014 US dollars.
Statistical analyses
We performed difference-in-differences analysis by estimating regression models that com-
pared trends in outcomes in PMI recipient counties to trends in comparison countries while
adjusting for country fixed effects, which controlled for underlying differences between coun-
tries, and year fixed effects, which controlled for secular trends in outcomes. We evaluated the
primary outcome of annual child mortality risk using modified Poisson regression models
[26] with robust standard errors clustered at the country level to relax the assumption of inde-
pendently and identically distributed error terms [27, 28]. The proportion of population cov-
ered by ITN, IRS, and ACT outcomes were evaluated using ordinary least squares regression
models, with robust standard errors. Statistical significance threshold was set at alpha = 0.05
using two-tailed tests. We used child-year data from the DHS, MIS, and AIS to estimate how
binary indicators of program activity were associated with annual risk of mortality among chil-
dren aged <5 years. The first model included a binary indicator of PMI funding in a given
country and year (Model 1 in S1 Appendix). The second model added binary indicators for
whether countries received funding from other large-scale donors in each year, namely the
Global Fund and PEPFAR (Model 2). The third model also added individual and household
characteristics (Model 3); observations with missing data were dropped from analysis. We
then re-fitted these 3 models using our continuous measures of program intensity, or per-cap-
ita aid disbursements, instead of the binary funding indicators (Models 4–6). A similar

 analytical strategy was undertaken in a previous study that sought to estimate the effect of PEP-
FAR on adult mortality in SSA [29].
Country-level MAP data were then used to evaluate the association between binary indica-
tors of PMI, PEPFAR and Global Fund, and population-coverage of ITNs, ACTs, and IRS,
while controlling for total population size (Model 7). Next, we explored the associations
between per-capita measures of program intensity and malaria intervention coverage, again
controlling for population size (Model 8). Finally, we tested whether the associations between
PMI and health-related outcomes varied over time by including a series of binary indicators
for each year in which PMI, Global Fund, and PEPFAR funds were available in a country
(Models 9 and 10). These models were used to test the mechanism though which introduction
of PMI funding might have shifted trends in malaria incidence and under-5 mortality rates.
The difference-in-differences design is a quasi-experimental method that relies on the
assumption that, in the absence of any intervention, countries receiving PMI funding would
have identical trends in outcomes as non-recipient countries. We tested this “parallel trends”
assumption by using data from pre-PMI years and estimating models that included an interac-
tion term between an indicator of PMI country and a linear time trend (Model 11). In order to
assess whether countries were selectively chosen for PMI, we also compared the average base-
line performance on the available measures of governance and health systems between PMI
recipient and comparison countries [30].
We performed several sensitivity analyses to verify our results. First, we excluded deaths
that occurred in the first month of the child’s life to confirm that results were not driven by
reductions in neonatal mortality. Reductions in neonatal mortality could be attributed to bet-
ter prenatal and delivery care rather than malaria interventions. Second, we tested whether the
association between PMI and child mortality was stronger in rural areas where malaria burden
is generally higher. Third, we separately excluded each individual country from the analysis to
ensure that results were not driven by patterns in any single country. Fourth, we assessed
whether results were robust to excluding the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria
because PMI programs were implemented at subnational levels in these 2 countries and
under-5 mortality rates due to malaria were especially high there [31]. Fifth, we assessed
whether the results were robust to the type of model chosen by also estimating logit, probit,
and Cox regression models. Next, we confirmed that the parallel trends assumption held when
we interacted a nonlinear time trend with PMI program indicators using data from pre-PMI
years. Finally, we confirmed that we were able to detect the association between PMI and
malaria intervention coverage using alternative data sources.
Results
The child mortality sample from DHS, MIS, and AIS included 7,752,071 child-year observa-
tions, of which 5,837,998 (75%) were from 19 PMI-recipient countries and the remaining
1,914,073 (25%) were from 13 comparison countries (Table 1). Approximately 9.44% of the
2,112,951 children in our sample died before reaching age 5. In PMI countries, we observed
148,551 child deaths during the study period (under-5 mortality rate 25.4 per 1,000 person-
years) while in comparison countries we observed 50,930 child deaths (under-5 mortality rate
of 26.6 per 1,000 person-years). Detailed information about program start years, survey years,
and sample size by study country are provided in Table A of S1 Appendix. Characteristics of
children and mothers in the sample did not significantly differ between PMI recipient and
non-recipient countries, with 2 exceptions: fewer women in PMI countries disclosed having
no education and a larger share of children in PMI countries lived in rural areas (Table B in S1
Appendix). The data on coverage of malaria-related interventions included 512 country-year

 observations, of which 304 (59%) were from PMI countries and 208 (41%) from comparison
countries.
We found no major differences between PMI and comparison countries in baseline malaria
burden, child mortality rates, and indicators of health system performance or governance
(Table 2). While there was considerable variation across countries in baseline malaria burden,
the average rate of P. falciparum in 2- to 10-year-olds in 2005 was approximately 30% in both
study groups. The World Bank’s estimates of under-5 mortality rates [30] in 2005 were 121 per
1,000 live births in PMI countries and 128 per 1,000 live births in comparison countries
(Table 2 and Table C in S1 Appendix). PMI countries had lower baseline health expenditures
and fewer nurses and midwives than comparison countries, but these differences were not sta-
tistically significant. Both study groups had negative (i.e., unfavorable) scores on government
effectiveness, political stability, and corruption measures, and the differences between groups
in these scores were not statistically significant. PMI countries had larger (p = 0.03) and less
wealthy (p = 0.052) populations at baseline. Country-level baseline under-5 mortality rates,
PfPR2-10 transmission rates, and coverage of ITNs, ACTs, and IRS are listed in Table C in S1
Appendix. PMI recipient countries had higher ITN coverage at baseline, but ACT and IRS cov-
erage was approximately the same in 2005 between the study groups. Our study design adjusts
for baseline differences between countries.
The test of parallel trends showed that, after controlling for baseline country characteristics,
secular time trends, and individual characteristics, child mortality rates in PMI recipient and
non-recipient countries were identical before the start of the PMI program (risk ratio [RR]
1.00, 95% CI 0.98–1.01; Table 3). Mortality rates were declining in all of the study countries
during this time period (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.97), but there was no evidence of trends
being different between PMI and comparison countries.

 PMI countries received an average of US$0.98 per-capita from US bilateral aid for malaria
annually (Fig 1). The Global Fund provided about twice as much aid to the sub-Saharan region
as PMI, with about half of the disbursements sent to PMI-recipient countries (average of US
$0.89 per capita since 2006) and the other half to non-recipient countries (average of US$1.01
per capita since 2006). PMI countries received slightly more malaria funding from all other
sources than non-PMI countries (US$0.26 USD versus US$0.11, respectively, since 2006),
though all other malaria aid summed to less than $0.50 per-capita at its highest level. The
upward trend in ITN coverage was apparent during the study period, with larger increases
observed in PMI countries. ACT coverage remained fairly low in all countries and did not dif-
fer between PMI recipient versus non-recipient countries. While average IRS coverage
increased in PMI countries soon after the program was introduced, this trend was not sus-
tained, and by 2012 average coverage in the 2 study groups was again overlapping.
The average annual risk of mortality among children aged <5 years was 15% lower after the
introduction of PMI (Table 4, Panel A; risk ratio [RR], 0.85, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.74–
0.96). Result was slightly more pronounced, at 16% reduction in mortality, after adjusting for
the presence of other funding sources in a country (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.95) and in the
fully adjusted model that included individual characteristics (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96). The
main study finding of a 16% reduction in the annual risk of child mortality after adjustment
for covariates amounts to a change in the mortality rate from 28.9 per 1,000 person-years in
PMI countries before program implementation to 24.3 per 1,000 person-years after implemen-
tation. Per-capita measure of PMI intensity showed that each additional dollar disbursed
through PMI was associated with a reduction in the annual risk of under-5 mortality (Table 4,

 Panel B; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.90). After adjusting for other funding sources and individual-
level covariates, PMI was associated with 14% annual reduction in under-5 mortality (RR 0.86,
95% CI 0.79–0.93). Per-capita Global Fund disbursements were marginally associated with
lower risk of under-5 all-cause mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–1.00) in the fully adjusted
models. Mortality risk was lower for females, children with more educated mothers, and chil-
dren living in wealthier households and in urban areas (Tables D and E in S1 Appendix); chil-
dren between first and second birthdays faced the highest risk of mortality.

 PMI was also associated with 8.34 percentage point increase in ITN coverage (95% CI 0.86–
15.83) and 6.63 percentage point increase of IRS coverage (95% CI 0.79–12.47), as shown in
Panel A of Table 5. When we examined PMI on the basis of program intensity (Table 5, Panel
B), each additional per-capita dollar disbursed through PMI was associated with 4.29 percent-
age point annual increase in ITN coverage (95% CI 0.54–8.03) and 3.56% increase in ACTs
(−0.07–7.19), though this association was only marginally significant (p = 0.054). Despite the
relatively small amount of malaria funds disbursed through channels other than PMI and
Global Fund, we found that ITN coverage increased by 9.69 percentage points (95% CI 3.41–
15.97) in countries that received funding through these channels. When the study sample was
expanded beyond the 32 study countries that had DHS/MIS/AIS child mortality data (i.e., to
other countries in SSA that also had MAP data), we found that PMI was associated with even
larger increases in ITN, ACT, and IRS coverage (Table F in S1 Appendix).
We used estimates from prior studies to calculate the predicted reductions in all-cause child
mortality based on the PMI-associated increases in ITN, ACT, and IRS coverage reported in
Table 5. Our calculations incorporated evidence from Kenya, where Fegan et al. (2007) esti-
mated that increasing ITN coverage from 7% to 67% was associated with 44% reduction in all-

 cause child mortality [32]. Given the limited evidence about the impact of IRS on child mortal-
ity [16], we followed the example of Eisele et al. (2010) and assumed that IRS coverage had
approximately equal protective effect to ITNs [11]. Finally, we used evidence from Zanzibar,
where Bhattarai et al. (2007) found that reaching high coverage of ACTs (we used the conser-
vative assumption that this implied full coverage) was associated 52% reduction in child mor-
tality [33]. Applying these effect sizes to the estimates in Table 5, we determined that the
increased coverage of these 3 prevention and treatment modalities could account for a 12.5%
reduction in all-cause child mortality (additional details are in S1 Appendix).
Fig 2 displays the association between PMI and child mortality over time and the associa-
tion between PMI and coverage of malaria interventions over time. We found that as the num-
ber of years of PMI implementation rose, there were larger associated reductions in mortality
rates in PMI countries and larger associated increases in coverage of ITNs. In the first year of
PMI implementation, the association between the program and child mortality was small and
not statistically significant (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86–1.01) but in subsequent years the association

year 5), full set of results in Table G in S1 Appendix. The coefficients in year 7 and 8 have wide
confidence intervals because they are based on a much lower number of observations due to
fewer countries having been enrolled at the start of PMI in 2006 and fewer DHS surveys avail-
able from the later years. Similarly, the association between PMI and ITN coverage began as a
small increase, but by the fifth year of PMI, the association increased to 9.5 percentage points
(95% CI 2.8–16.2) and reached a peak of approximately 17 percentage point increase in years 7
and 8 (95% CI 7.5–25.6 and 5.6–29.2, respectively). IRS coverage was increasing in PMI-recipi-
ent countries up to the fourth year of program implementation, at which point it dropped off
considerably. ACT coverage increased at very moderate levels in PMI countries throughout
this program’s history.

 We tested the robustness of study results with a series of sensitivity analyses. When neonatal
deaths (i.e., those that took place within the first month of a child’s life) were excluded from
the analysis, the association between PMI and all-cause child mortality rate was magnified
from RR 0.84 to a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69–0.90) and each additional per-capita dollar spent
through PMI was associated with 0.83 lower risk of mortality (95% CI 0.75–0.92), results listed
in Table H in S1 Appendix. Reductions in child mortality were especially evident in rural
areas, where malaria burden is typically the highest and where access to malaria interventions
has the higher potential for impact. The annual risk reduction of child mortality was 0.83 (95%
CI 0.73–0.95) in rural areas compared to 0.87 (95% CI 0.76–1.00) in urban areas (results listed

 in Table I in S1 Appendix). Each additional per-capita dollar disbursed through PMI was asso-
ciated with 0.85 lower risk reduction of mortality in rural areas (95% CI 0.78–0.93) compared
to 0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.93) in urban areas. Results were also robust to excluding individual
countries, to excluding Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria from the model (Table J in
S1 Appendix), and to different model specifications (Table K in S1 Appendix). We confirmed
that the parallel trends assumption held when we interacted nonlinear time trend with PMI
indicators (Table L in S1 Appendix). Finally, we confirmed our study finding that PMI was
associated with increased utilization of ITNs using alternative data sources (Table M in S1
Appendix).
Discussion
This study evaluated the association between PMI and population health using methods that
controlled for various confounding factors. PMI was associated with large and statistically sig-
nificant reductions in all-cause mortality rates among children under 5 years of age. These
findings persisted in models that controlled for the presence and size of funding from other
important programs, time-invariant country characteristics, common time trends, and various
individual and household characteristics. Among other funders, disbursements through the
Global Fund were also modestly associated with all-cause child mortality rates. The results
suggest that PMI’s investment in key malaria interventions was associated with significant
increases in population coverage of malaria prevention and treatment technologies, which ulti-
mately may have contributed to the significant reductions in under-5 mortality in SSA.
The main findings indicate that PMI was associated with a 16% decline in annual risk of all-
cause under-5 mortality. Furthermore, the association between PMI and child mortality was
more pronounced over time. These reductions were above and beyond the declines in child
mortality that were observed in PMI and non-PMI countries prior to the introduction of PMI,
as well as trends in mortality that were observed in non-PMI countries in the years after intro-
duction of PMI. The 16% relative risk reduction translates to a decline in under-5 mortality
rate from 28.9 to 24.3 deaths per 1,000 person-years after PMI implementation. Because the
primary outcome in this study was all-cause child mortality rate, it is important to underscore
that not all of the under-5 deaths averted in PMI countries were due to malaria prevention and
treatment. Nonetheless, we believe that the findings that coverage of various malaria preven-
tion and treatment interventions—including ITNs, ACT, and IRS—increased in the years after
PMI introduction provide a plausible mechanism for the decline in child mortality that was
associated with PMI.
Possible mechanisms
We examined existing evidence on the effectiveness of malaria interventions to assess whether
the PMI-associated declines in child mortality were plausible. The widespread distribution of
ITNs has previously been described as the most important malaria intervention in Africa [1,
34], accounting for 68% of the decrease in P. falciparum transmission rates between 2000 and
2015 [10]. A systematic review of efficacy trials from SSA found that use of ITNs reduced
under-5 mortality by about a fifth [9]. An observational study in Kenya found that after mass
distribution and promotion of ITNs, increased bednet use was associated with a 44% reduction
in child mortality [32]. Consistent with other studies, we found that ITN coverage increased
considerably in SSA since the turn of millennium, and that coverage was above average trends
in PMI-recipient countries. Thus, our finding that PMI was associated with higher ITN cover-
age can partially explain the main finding regarding child mortality rates. We also found that
PMI was associated with higher IRS coverage, particularly in the first few years of PMI

 program activities. Existing evidence shows that ITN and IRS coverage implemented together
might have increased effectiveness, especially in high transmission areas with moderate ITN
coverage [11, 21, 35]. Together, the rising coverage of ITNs and IRS may have offered an even
greater protective effect on malaria burden and, ultimately, child mortality rates in PMI coun-
tries. Evidence also suggests that high coverage of ACTs may result in significant reductions in
child mortality [33]. While the association between PMI and ACT coverage in our study was
very modest, it is possible that higher access to malaria treatment might have made some,
albeit small, contribution to the reduction in all-cause mortality. Our calculations showed the
PMI-associated increases in ITN, IRS, and ACT coverage could account for a 12.5% reduction
in all-cause child mortality. However, this result should be interpreted with caution given that
we had to make several assumptions in our calculations and that we applied estimates from 2
specific settings to 32 different countries in SSA. Our calculations also did not account for
interactive effects between ITNs, IRS, and ACTs or the fact that the increases in coverage
detected in our study were considerably smaller in magnitude than those that were assumed or
estimated in the other studies.
Other malaria interventions supported with PMI funds that were not assessed in this study,
such as rapid diagnostic tests and IPTp, could have also contributed to reducing malaria bur-
den and lowering all-cause child mortality rates. Protecting pregnant women from malaria in
particular has been shown to lead to better birth outcomes and decreased risk of developing
malaria, acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea during childhood, the leading causes of child
deaths in SSA today [36, 37]. Finally, it is possible that introduction of PMI funds for malaria
freed up domestic resources for other health interventions that further contributed to the
reduction in all-cause child mortality. For instance, PMI invests in health systems strengthen-
ing and capacity building of laboratories and pharmaceutical chain systems. HIV programs
have been found to have positive spillover effects to the broader health systems [38, 39], and it
is possible that similar synergies exist between malaria-specific interventions and general
health system functioning.
Internal and external evaluations of PMI have documented declines in under-5 mortality in
PMI-recipient countries and concluded that the program was successful in making significant
progress towards reducing child mortality [8, 18]. Our study provides additional evidence in
support of this conclusion and extends the existing literature by using a quasi-experimental
design. Despite PMI’s achievements, population coverage of key malaria interventions
remained low throughout most of the African region [40]. As of 2015, most PMI countries
were under target for key populations sleeping under ITNs and timely access to diagnostic
tests and malaria medicines [8]. Furthermore, PMI has scaled down or even suspended IRS in
some countries after worrying reports of resistance to insecticides have emerged [41, 42] and
cost of other insecticides increased substantially [43]. The drop in IRS coverage in PMI recipi-
ent countries can be clearly seen in Figs 1 and 2. Bearing in mind that detecting population-
level changes in ACT and IRS coverage can be difficult due to more targeted implementation,
coverage of these interventions remained quite low throughout the study period, and increases
in coverage after PMI implementation were also modest. As further support for malaria inter-
ventions is considered, health systems strengthening will be necessary to deliver more compli-
cated interventions such as diagnostic tests and ACT, which require interacting with the
healthcare system and a well-functioning drug supply chain system.
Strengths and limitations
The reliance on 2 different measures of PMI activity and various robustness tests strengthened
our confidence in the main study findings. It is reassuring that an association between PMI

 and the primary and secondary outcomes was detected using both a time-varying binary
measure of receipt of PMI funding by a country (extracted from reports to Congress) and a
continuous measure of per-capita measure of PMI funding obtained by countries in each year
(obtained from IHME). Relying on disbursed dollars rather than committed dollars provided
greater confidence that the exposure measure was correlated with interventions that reached
populations in PMI countries. Confidence in the study findings was further strengthened by
the robustness of results to adjustments for expenditures from all other funding sources cap-
tured in the IHME dataset. We were also reassured that exclusion of neonatal deaths, which
could be attributed to better prenatal and delivery care rather than malaria interventions,
amplified the magnitude of the association between PMI and child mortality. In addition, the
data on coverage of malaria interventions were adjusted for geographic and temporal hetero-
geneity, which provides more robust malaria data [10, 40, 44]. Expanding the study sample to
include additional comparison countries magnified the association between PMI and coverage
of ITNs, ACTs, and IRS, suggesting that access to malaria interventions in the 9 additional
countries (Botswana, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau,
Mauritania, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan) was even more lacking than in the main study
sample. The use of data spanning nearly 20 years enabled us to isolate the association between
PMI and mortality from general shifts in child mortality trends in SSA and test the key
assumptions of the difference-in-differences model. The finding that PMI and non-PMI coun-
tries had similar trends in child mortality rates prior to PMI introduction therefore strength-
ens the main finding regarding the association between PMI and child mortality rates. Lastly,
PMI and comparison countries had similar governance characteristics when the program
began, suggesting that it is unlikely that the program was selectively implemented in countries
that were more favorable environments for malaria funding.
This study was subject to several limitations. First, difference-in-differences analysis relied
on the assumption that there were no important unmeasured variables that differentially
affected mortality rates in PMI and comparison countries during the study period. We used
country fixed effects to control for all time-invariant differences between countries and year
fixed effects to control for the underlying time trends in the region. Yet our study could still
suffer from omission of important time-varying characteristics, which could bias our study
results if the omitted variables affected PMI and comparison countries in different ways. For
example, we were not able to account for national government spending on malaria interven-
tions due to lack of reliable data. Countries have taken on more pronounced roles in funding
their health systems and the potential contributions of domestic spending to the improved
mortality rates should not be overlooked. Despite the increasing role of local governments
globally, domestic malaria funding in SSA was fairly flat throughout the study period and, as
of 2014, it still accounted for less than 10% of total malaria spending [1]. Nonetheless, PMI
works in concert with recipient governments, and including national government contribu-
tions to fighting malaria would provide a fuller picture of which models of delivering malaria
interventions have the highest value for money. Given the ongoing debate about how foreign
aid affects recipient governments’ investments in the health sector [45–47], it is difficult to
ascertain how governments might have adjusted their investment in malaria interventions
after PMI was launched. This complicates the assessment of whether reallocation of resources
was an important mechanism through which PMI was associated with all-cause mortality.
Second, the finding that Global Fund support was associated with only a modest reduction
in all-cause child mortality, while consistent with one other study [48], should be interpreted
with caution. The ability of our study to test hypotheses about the potential impact of this pro-
gram was limited by the fact that all countries in our sample received Global Fund support by
2005. Thus, we did not have a comparison group of countries that did not receive Global Fund

 support, as we did for the evaluation of PMI. We suspect that the null finding can be largely
explained by the lack of an appropriate comparison group that would have enabled us to test
whether steady reductions in child mortality rates over time were due to Global Fund support
or not. Our analysis of malaria interventions relied on the use of MAP data, which are modeled
estimates. It is possible that the algorithm used to model the MAP data incorporated some
inputs that were correlated with PMI. Finally, due to lack of suitable data, we were unable to
evaluate whether the increase of IPTp (2 doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) coverage
reported in PMI countries, from 14% at baseline to 38% in 2015 [8], are on par with or above
the average trends in the rest of SSA. Future research should explore the potential impact of
PMI on health behaviors in households with pregnant women.
Implications
Our findings provide important new evidence of an accelerated decline in child mortality rates
after the introduction of PMI. The investments that PMI funding enabled in key malaria inter-
ventions was associated with a large reduction in all-cause under-5 mortality, higher coverage
of ITNs and IRS, and modest increases in ACTs. Further investment in the interventions sup-
ported with PMI funds may translate to additional lives saved, reduced household financial
burdens associated with caring for ill household members and lost wages, and less strain on
health systems associated with treating malaria cases. In other words, the health gains from
PMI investment may have spillover effects beyond health, such as higher school attainment
and labor productivity, which might in turn lead to greater economic development. Future
research should explore whether investments made through programs such as PMI did in fact
improve education and economic outcomes in SSA. Improved capacity of health systems,
whether through health systems strengthening or recipient countries’ ability to shift their own
resources to other health needs, might be a crucial component of PMI’s success.
