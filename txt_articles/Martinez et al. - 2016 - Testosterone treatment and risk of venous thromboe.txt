ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine the risk of venous thromboembolism 
associated with use of testosterone treatment in men, 
focusing particularly on the timing of the risk.
Design
Population based case-control study.
setting
370 general practices in UK primary care with linked 
hospital discharge diagnoses and in-hospital 
procedures and information on all cause mortality.
PartiCiPants
19 215 patients with confirmed venous 
thromboembolism (comprising deep venous 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and 909 530 
age matched controls from source population 
including more than 2.22 million men between January 
2001 and May 2013.
exPOsure Of interest
Three mutually exclusive testosterone exposure groups 
were identified: current treatment, recent (but not 
current) treatment, and no treatment in the previous 
two years. Current treatment was subdivided into 
duration of more or less than six months.
Main OutCOMe Measure
Rate ratios of venous thromboembolism in association 
with current testosterone treatment compared with no 
treatment were estimated using conditional logistic 
regression and adjusted for comorbidities and all 
matching factors.
results
The adjusted rate ratio of venous thromboembolism 
was 1.25 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.66) for 
current versus no testosterone treatment. In the first 
six months of testosterone treatment, the rate ratio of 
venous thromboembolism was 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37), 
corresponding to 10.0 (1.9 to 21.6) additional venous 
thromboembolisms above the base rate of 15.8 per 
10 000 person years. The rate ratio after more than six 
months’ treatment was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47), and after 
treatment cessation it was 0.68 (0.43 to 1.07). 
Increased rate ratios within the first six months of 
treatment were observed in all strata: the rate ratio was 
1.52 (0.94 to 2.46) for patients with pathological 
hypogonadism and 1.88 (1.02 to 3.45) for those 
without it, and 1.41 (0.82 to 2.41) for those with a 
known risk factor for venous thromboembolism and 
1.91 (1.13 to 3.23) for those without one.
COnClusiOns
Starting testosterone treatment was associated with 
an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which 
peaked within six months and declined thereafter.
Introduction
A striking increase in prescribing of testosterone 
occurred over the first decade of this century, with a 
10-fold increase in testosterone prescriptions per capita 
in the United States (excluding compounding 
 
pharmacies).1  The 40-fold increase in Canada, which 
includes internet pharmacies providing additional tes-
tosterone sales, suggests that this may be an underesti-
mate. Yet pathological hypogonadism, defined as 
recognised pathological disorders of the male repro-
ductive system, remains the sole unequivocal indica-
tion for testosterone treatment.2  Hence this upsurge in 
medical testosterone use over the first decade of the 
century without new proven indications is for unclear 
and questionable indications, probably sexual dysfunc-
tion and/or decreased energy/vitality.3 4  Since then, a 
recent study has shown only a modest and poorly sus-
tained increase in sexual activity, but not in vitality or 
physical activity, in men without pathological hypogo-
nadism over the age of 65 years treated with testosterone.5
An important consequence of unjustified testoster-
one treatment in men with an increased underlying 
cardiovascular risk is the possibility of an excess of car-
diovascular events with testosterone treatment. One 
study reported an excess of cardiovascular events in 
older men without pathological hypogonadism,6  but 
subsequent meta-analyses of randomised placebo con-
trolled trials of adverse cardiovascular effects from tes-
tosterone treatment have provided discrepant 
interpretations.7 
-12  However, the overall risk ratios were 
1.0 or greater in each trial, suggesting that these rela-
tively short term analyses with wide confidence inter-
vals were still too under-powered to be decisive.13  On 
the basis of congruent considerations, in June 2014 the 
US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada 
required a new general label warning in the product 
information of all approved testosterone products

about risk of venous thromboembolism after testoster-
one treatment.14 
15  Since then, one small meta-analysis 
of randomised controlled trials of testosterone found it 
to be associated with a higher risk of venous thrombo-
embolism.16  A cohort study and a case-control study 
did not show evidence of an association between testos-
terone use and an increased risk of venous thromboem-
bolism.17 18  None of the previous studies, however, 
investigated the timing and duration of testosterone 
use, which could have masked a risk of venous throm-
boembolism soon after the start of treatment, as seen 
with oral contraceptives.19
In the absence of large randomised trials, we used a 
large UK database to investigate the association 
between testosterone use and the risk of venous throm-
boembolism in men, focusing particularly on the timing 
of exposure to testosterone and the presence of risk fac-
tors for venous thromboembolism.
Methods
study setting and design
The source population consisted of all patients in the 
UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) eligible 
for additional data from the Hospital Episodes Statistics 
and the Office for National Statistics. The CPRD is based 
on patients’ encounters with the general practices. Data 
are recorded electronically and include patients’ demo-
graphics; lifestyle information; medical history; symp-
toms, signs, and diagnoses recorded with Read medical 
codes; laboratory tests; immunisations; unstructured 
medical notes; letters to and from secondary care; and 
prescriptions issued by the general practitioner. The 
CPRD is broadly representative of the UK population in 
terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. More than 98% of the 
UK population are registered with primary care general 
practitioners, who act as gatekeepers to the health sys-
tem. The CPRD undertakes assessment of data quality 
at the patient level and at the practice level to assign 
patients and the latest date at which practices meet 
minimum quality criteria.20  It has been validated in 
venous thromboembolism research.21 22 Hospital Epi-
sodes Statistics include dates of hospital admission and 
discharge, primary and other main reasons for treat-
ment recorded with ICD-10 (international classification 
of diseases, 10th revision), and surgical operations and 
procedures performed during the hospital stay. Office 
for National Statistics data contain the date and cause 
of death as recorded with ICD-10 in death certificates.
We did a population based case-control study of all 
men aged 20 to 89 years in CPRD general practices sat-
isfying the quality standard for research between 1 Jan-
uary 2001 and 31 May 2013.
Case definition
We identified all cases with a diagnosis of a venous 
thromboembolism between January 2001 and May 2013 
from the study population. We applied a validated 
 
algorithm for venous thromboembolism to identify the 
first occurrence.22 Venous thromboembolism comprised 
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Deep 
vein thrombosis included thrombosis of the deep veins 
of lower and upper limbs and thrombosis of the pelvic 
veins and vena cava. We developed an algorithm for 
venous thromboembolism based on events identified 
from causes of death, hospital discharge diagnoses, 
general practitioner based medical records, anony-
mised clinical notes, and search of general practitioner 
recorded medical notes for word strings indicative of 
venous thromboembolism and use of oral and paren-
teral anticoagulants. We also used anonymised clinical 
notes, letters, and discharge summaries to validate the 
diagnosis. Venous thromboembolisms diagnosed by 
general practitioners required use of oral anticoagu-
lants or at least three international normalised ratio 
tests within seven days before to 60 days after the initial 
event or at least two prescriptions for low molecular 
weight heparin within seven to 60 days after the venous 
thromboembolism. We prioritised diagnoses of venous 
thromboembolism in one data source over those in 
another data source if the first event was recorded in 
more than one data source at the same time. In those 
cases, we prioritised venous thromboembolisms 
according to the following hierarchy: manual review of 
clinical notes, Office for National Statistics, Hospital 
Episodes Statistics, general practitioner, and word 
strings for venous thromboembolism. We assessed the 
validity of the venous thromboembolism algorithm by 
reviewing anonymised clinical and hospital discharge 
letters from the entire CPRD for those with a recording 
of venous thromboembolism.
The sensitivity for detecting venous thromboembo-
lism was 92.6%, and the specificity was 98.6%.22  The 
first occurrence of VTE during the study period defined 
the case, and we designated the date of this event as the 
index date. All cases had at least two years of 
up-to-standard history in the CPRD before the index 
date and no history of a previous venous thromboembo-
lism. We classified all venous thromboembolism events 
in the study cohort according to the presence or absence 
of each of the following risk factors: cancer, surgery, 
trauma, or a medical condition in the 90 days before the 
index event and history of cancer recorded more than 
90 days before the index day.23  Medical illness refers to 
acutely ill medical patients and comprised a primary 
hospital discharge diagnosis for any of the following 
conditions recorded in the 90 days before the index 
venous thromboembolism: acute stroke, heart failure, 
rheumatological conditions, inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, cellulitis of skin, gut infections, lower and upper 
urinary tract infections, osteoporosis, acute respiratory 
failure, asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, bronchi-
tis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, 
and pneumonia.24 Cancer was defined as an admission 
to hospital with a primary diagnosis of cancer (exclud-
ing non-melanoma skin cancer), radiation treatment, 
chemotherapy, or bone marrow transplantation.
selection of controls
Because exposure to testosterone is rare, for each 
venous thromboembolism case we randomly selected 
up to 50 matched controls among people in the source 
population on the case’s index date, which became the

index date for those matched controls. For each case, 
controls were matched on year of birth, all known risk 
factors for venous thromboembolism in the 90 days 
before the index day (that is, surgical procedures, med-
ical illness, trauma, active cancer), history of cancer 91 
or more days before the index date, and history of 
pathological hypogonadism. This last consisted of pri-
mary or secondary hypogonadism on the basis of the 
presence of testicular or hypothalamic-pituitary pathol-
ogies, respectively, recorded any time before the index 
date. The matching factors year of birth, history of pri-
mary or secondary hypogonadism, and known risk fac-
tors for venous thromboembolism in the 90 days before 
the index day are known or suspected confounding fac-
tors that are or may be causes of prescriptions for testos-
terone or of venous thromboembolism. Venous 
thromboembolism cases were eligible as potential con-
trols until they became cases, and all matches had to be 
at risk of an incident venous thromboembolism. Con-
trols also had to have two years of up-to-standard his-
tory in the CPRD and no history of a venous 
thromboembolism before the index date.
exposures
For all cases and their matched controls, we estimated 
exposure from all prescriptions for a testosterone prod-
uct issued before the index date. We considered a man 
to be exposed for the length of a prescription plus a 30 
day grace period. We considered men to be currently 
exposed if they had a prescription whereby the use (pre-
scription length+30 days) extended to or beyond the 
index date. Current treatment was stratified into the 
time since start of testosterone treatment up to six 
months or more than six months before the index day. 
Recent use was use that (including the 30 day grace 
period) ended at a point between two years before and 
one day before the index date. Not exposed was the ref-
erence category for all comparisons and comprised all 
patients with use that ended more than two years before 
the index date plus those who never received testoster-
one. We calculated the start and end of testosterone 
treatment for each case and control by using the pre-
scribed product to account for its dose (mg), formula-
tion (capsules, injectable, transdermal gel or patch, 
subcutaneous implants) and route of administration 
(oral, intramuscular, transdermal). We calculated prod-
uct specific duration of exposure to testosterone by its 
prescribed quantity and daily supply. We defined the 
date of a repeat prescription as the date of the next pre-
scription in the respective sequence, which must have 
occurred within the coverage days of the first prescrip-
tion, defined by the calculated duration of exposure 
plus a 30 day grace period. The grace period was to 
account for residual effects of testosterone or imperfect 
adherence to the prescribed testosterone regimen (for 
example, late make-up for missed doses and/or remain-
ing drug after apparent date of cessation).
The coverage days for all testosterone products were 
based on expert opinion, and the median time between 
product specific prescriptions was 14 or 84 days for 
shorter and longer acting testosterone injections, 150 
days for implants, and 30 days for products with 
another (oral, transdermal) route of administration.
In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the main analy-
sis using a 15 and 60 day grace period. No testosterone 
treatment (within the previous two years) was the refer-
ence category for all comparisons.
Covariates
Covariates included all matching factors used in the 
design as well as the following additional covariates: 
polycythaemia, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, periph-
eral vascular disease, stroke, and history of prothrom-
botic disease. For all cases and controls without 
pathological hypogonadism, the following comorbidi-
ties, which sometimes lead to empirical testosterone 
treatment, were assessed if recorded before the index 
date: sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, and infertility; 
and the following symptoms and complaints were 
assessed if recorded in the year before the index date: 
hot flushes, loss of appetite, and a group of symptoms 
comprising tiredness, lethargy, and depression. Other 
covariates were body mass index (using cut-offs of 18.5, 
25.0, 30.0, and 35.0), smoking and drinking status based 
on the last information before or on the index date, 
socioeconomic status, and prescriptions for the follow-
ing drugs within 90 days of the index date: megestrol, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic corti-
costeroids, and antiplatelets.
statistical analysis
We used conditional logistic regression to calculate 
crude and adjusted odds ratios that are estimates of the 
incidence rate ratios. The main analysis included current 
and recent testosterone treatment as of the index date 
compared with no testosterone treatment. In addition to 
the matching factors, all rate ratios were adjusted for 
residual imbalance of all specified covariates among 
cases and controls. We did stratified analyses for patients 
with a known risk factor within 90 days before the index 
day or with a history of cancer or pathological hypogo-
nadism, and for route of administration. To obtain an 
absolute measure of the excess incidence rate, we trans-
formed the adjusted rate ratio to a rate difference by 
using the proportion of controls exposed to testosterone, 
the adjusted rate ratio associated with testosterone use, 
and the incidence rate of venous thromboembolism in 
our study population.19 
25 We used quadratic splines to 
illustrate the rate ratio of venous thromboembolism as a 
function of duration of testosterone treatment among 
men currently treated with  
testosterone.
To assess the robustness of our results, we did sensi-
tivity analyses exploring the effect of potential misclas-
sification of current testosterone exposure on the 
estimated rate ratios by assigning grace periods of 15 
and 60 days rather than 30 days or by using the entire 
patient’s history in the CPRD for the definition of no tes-
tosterone treatment or for the stratification of current 
testosterone therapy according to the start of treatment 
using three or nine months rather than six months. We 
used Stata MP version 13.1 for all statistical procedures.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
The source population consisted of 2.92 million men. 
During a total of 12.1 million person years of follow-up, 
19 246 men had an incident confirmed diagnosis of 
venous thromboembolism (8394 deep venous thrombo-
ses, 10 787 pulmonary embolisms, and 65 unspecified 
venous thromboembolisms according to the case find-
ing algorithm detailed in fig 1), for an incidence rate of 
venous thromboembolism of 15.8 (95% confidence 
interval 15.6 to 16.0) per 10 000 person years.
A total of 909 530 controls were matched to 19 215 
venous thromboembolism cases on age and all 
 
predefined independent risk factors for venous throm-
boembolism. No matches were found for 31 cases. 
Table 1 confirms that the venous thromboembolism 
cases and their matched controls were identical in age 
and the predefined matching. Cases were more often 
obese (body mass index ≥30: 27
.0% v 20.6%) and had 
more comorbidities, notably polycythaemia, chronic 
pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, and peripheral vascular disease than did the 
controls. Additionally, corticosteroids, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiplatelets were used 
more frequently among cases than controls (table 1).
On the index date, 1251 (0.14%) of the controls were 
current testosterone users and 846 (0.09%) were recent 
users. Of the 19 215 cases, 69 venous thromboembolisms 
(0.36%; 28 deep vein thromboses and 41 pulmonary 
embolisms) occurred during current testosterone treat-
ment and 22 (0.11%; 7 deep vein thromboses and 15 pul-
monary embolisms) after recent treatment (table 2 ). Of 
the 1251 controls currently treated with testosterone, 
678 (54.2%) used intramuscular preparations,

453 (36.2%) transdermal preparations, 23 (1.8%) 
implants, and 97 (7
.8%) oral preparations (table 3). The 
median duration of the last prescription before the index 
date was 85 days for intramuscular administrations, 
31 days for patches, gel, or oral testosterone products, 
and 151 days for subcutaneous testosterone implants.
Overall crude rate ratios were greater than adjusted 
rate ratios, with secondary hypogonadism, corticoste-
roids, and body mass index contributing most to the 
adjustment. The adjusted rate ratio of venous thrombo-
embolism associated with current testosterone treat-
ment was 1.25 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.66) 
relative to no testosterone treatment (table 2 ), corre-
sponding to an adjusted excess incidence rate of 3.9 
(−0.9 to 10.4) additional venous thromboembolisms per 
10 000 person years of current testosterone use. The 
rate ratio of venous thromboembolism associated with 
starting a new course of testosterone treatment within 
six months was 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37), corresponding to an 
excess incidence rate of 10.0 (1.9 to 21.6) additional 
venous thromboembolisms per 10 000 person years, 
whereas the rate ratio for treatment started longer than 
six months before the index date was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47). 
The rate ratio for recent use was 0.68 (0.43 to 1.07) 
(table 2 ). Figure 2 shows the quadratic spline curve and 
95% confidence limits of the rate ratio as a function of 
time since starting the current testosterone treatment, 
showing that the risk of venous thromboembolism 
peaks at about three months after starting testosterone 
treatment and declines progressively thereafter towards 
the pre-treatment baseline.
Stratification according to the presence of pathologi-
cal hypogonadism yielded an adjusted rate ratio of 
venous thromboembolism of 1.69 (1.09 to 2.63) for cur-
rent testosterone users without pathological hypogo-
nadism and 1.88 (1.02 to 3.45) for those who started a 
new course of testosterone treatment within six months 
(table 2 ). In contrast, the rate ratio among patients with 
pathological hypogonadism was not significant for cur-
rent testosterone treatment 1.08 (0.75 to 1.55), and it was 
1.52 (0.94 to 2.46) for treatment started less than six 
months before (table 2). The increased rate ratio among 
patients without pathological hypogonadism and with 
current testosterone use corresponded to an adjusted 
rate difference of 10.9 (1.4 to 25.7) additional venous 
thromboembolisms per 10 000 person years of current 
testosterone use.
Among patients with at least one known risk factor 
for venous thromboembolism, the rate ratio was 0.99 
(0.65 to 1.49) for current testosterone users and 1.41 (0.82 
to 2.41) for those who had started a new course of testos-
terone treatment within the previous six months. 
Among those without known risk factors, the rate ratio 
was higher at 1.57 (1.06 to 2.32) for current testosterone 
users and 1.91 (1.13 to 3.23) for those who had started a 
new course of testosterone treatment within the previ-
ous six months (table 3 ; fig 2 ). Stratification by route of 
administration yielded similar rate ratios for current 
intramuscular, transdermal, and oral testosterone use, 
with estimates ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 for patients cur-
rently treated with testosterone (table 3).

Sensitivity analyses using three, six, and nine month 
cut-off periods for start of testosterone treatment among 
current users and applying a 15, 30, and 60 day grace 
period to define continuous exposure, compared with 
the six month cut-off and 30 day grace period used in 
the main analysis, showed similar findings (supple-
mentary table). We did another analysis by reallocating 
patients with use of testosterone two or more years 
before the index day from the unexposed group to the 
“recent testosterone” group. This sensitivity analysis 
did not alter the findings.
discussion
This study provides the first evidence for a differential in 
an adverse effect of testosterone treatment in men with 
and without pathological hypogonadism, which peaks 
in the first six months and declines thereafter. The 63% 
increase in risk in the first six months of testosterone use 
corresponds to 10.0 (1.9 to 21.6) additional venous 
thromboembolisms above the base rate of 15.8 per 
10 000 person years. Although at variance with another 
recent report,18 these findings support the addition of 
the general warning for risk of venous thromboembo-
lism with testosterone products required recently by the 
US Food and Drug Administration, although they high-
light the fact that that this increased risk is transient.
strengths and weaknesses of study
The strengths of this study include the use of a vali-
dated venous thromboembolism algorithm, a non-ve-
nous thromboembolism cohort matched on known and 
suspected confounding factors that are or may be 
causes of prescriptions for testosterone or of venous 
thromboembolism, and the availability of full prescrip-
tion data allowing investigation of risk of venous throm-
boembolism by time since starting or stopping 
testosterone treatment.22 In addition, we were able to 
adjust for other potential confounders known to be 
associated with the risk of future venous thromboembo-
lism and to reduce confounding by indication by 
matching on history of hypogonadism. Furthermore, we 
verified the findings by a variety of sensitivity analyses 
showing similar results.

The observed difference in risk of venous thrombo-
embolism in current users who started testosterone use 
more than six months before the index date between 
those with and those without pathological hypogonad-
ism may be a genuine finding or may be due to chance 
alone, but two other possible explanations exist. The 
first is depletion of susceptible patients,26  with a differ-
ent proportion of very long term testosterone users 
among those with and those without pathological 
hypogonadism (testosterone treatment is lifelong for 
pathological hypogonadism,2  whereas for men without 
pathological hypogonadism it is characteristically short 
term)27. The second is effect measure modification due 
to different baseline risks of venous thromboembolism 
among patients with and without pathological hypogo-
nadism,28 which could affect the rate ratio, although no 
independent evidence exists for a higher underlying 
risk in men with pathological hypogonadism.
The limitations of this study include those seen in all 
observational studies: unmeasured or residual con-
founding or hidden bias that might exist undetected. To 
minimise residual confounding, we also matched cases 
to controls on history of individual known risk factors for 
venous thromboembolism including a medical illness, 
surgery and trauma, and active cancer within 90 days of 
the index day. Stratification by presence and absence of 
known risk factors for venous thromboembolism showed 
non-significant differences between patients with and 
without the known risk factor. Although the rate ratios 
were not statistically different, the difference in magni-
tudes of effect may be clinically relevant (1.91 v 1.41).
Case-control studies are prone to time window bias if 
the cases and controls are not defined by the same risk 
sets and the time windows for measuring exposure in 
cases and controls are not equal. In this study, we 
avoided time window bias by handling cases and con-
trols in exactly the same way.
To mitigate the effect of polycythaemia as a potential 
mediator as well as of prostate cancer, a contraindica-
tion for testosterone use that could have altered the tes-
tosterone exposure status, we did sensitivity analysis 
without additional adjustment for polycythaemia and 
excluding all cases and controls with a history of pros-
tate cancer. The study results remained basically 
unchanged. Nevertheless, unmeasured confounding 
remains a limitation. Another limitation is the potential

for misclassification of exposure due to residual effects 
of the drug, remaining drug, and/or lack of adherence 
to treatment after apparent cessation. For this reason, 
we included a 30 day grace period in the original analy-
sis, and a further sensitivity analysis using a shorter (15 
day) and extended (60 day) grace period did not alter 
the findings.
The sensitivity of the algorithm for detecting venous 
thromboembolism was 92.6%, which implies that we 
may have failed to identify around 7
.4% of cases. This 
would be a problem only if differential identification 
occurred (identification of venous thromboembolism 
cases being more likely if they were treated with testos-
terone). However, this is unlikely to be the case and is 
unlikely to have altered the study findings.
Finally, despite the large number of more than 19 000 
venous thromboembolisms in the study population, 
only 69 cases were currently treated with testosterone, 
so subgroup analyses were based on even smaller num-
bers with decreased analytical power.
Comparison with other studies
The baseline (non-user) risk of venous thromboembo-
lism and that after testosterone treatment, although 
increased transiently, are still relatively low in absolute 
terms. On an absolute population risk basis, the base-
line and testosterone induced increases in risks of 
venous thromboembolism in this population of middle 
aged and older men are quantitatively comparable to 
the baseline (non-user) risks of venous thromboembo-
lism in women and the increase among users of oral 
oestrogens in combined oral contraceptives or oestro-
gen replacement therapy for menopause.29-32  The early 
increase in risk in the first six months is also similar to 
that seen with oral oestrogen therapy.19  An increased 
risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with 
underlying familial or acquired thrombophilia if treated 
with testosterone has also been hypothesised and could 
explain the increased risk within six months after start-
ing testosterone treatment.33
Meaning of study
The fact that the risk peaks rapidly in the first three 
months and declines gradually thereafter indicates that 
failure to investigate the timing and duration of testos-
terone use could result in underestimation of the asso-
ciation between testosterone use and venous 
thromboembolism if overall risk estimates are based on 
a high proportion of patients carrying a small risk, a 
phenomenon known as depletion of susceptibles.26 
 
This could explain the discrepancy between our find-
ings and the recent case-control study.18  The mecha-
nism for the transient increased risk due to testosterone 
treatment is uncertain but may involve effects on throm-
bosis via decreased fibrinolysis and an interaction with 
previously undiagnosed thrombophilia-hypofibrinoly-
sis and/or with the higher underlying cardiovascular 
risk associated with erectile dysfunction.6 
34 
35  The ini-
tial increased risk of venous clotting might provoke a 
secondary response with more fibrinolysis, which tends 
to dissolve clots and eventually neutralises the risk. 
The risk of venous thromboembolism adjusted for under-
lying risk factors in association with testosterone use was 
increased early after the start of treatment for men with-
out pathological hypogonadism, a group in which 
unproven empirical testosterone treatment has been 
increasingly used over the first decade of this century.1 
36
These risks of venous thromboembolism associated 
with testosterone treatment are distinct from risks of 
other adverse arterial cardiovascular events associated 
with testosterone treatment in middle aged and older 
men as reported and reviewed elsewhere.11 12  Further-
more, venous thromboembolism should not be 
 
confused with pulmonary oil microembolisation, an 
immediate and transient effect of depot injections of 
testosterone esters in an oil vehicle.37
unanswered questions and future research
Our study suggests a transient increase in the risk of 
venous thromboembolism that peaks during the first 
three to six months and declines gradually thereafter. 
Failure to investigate the timing of venous thromboem-
bolisms in relation to the duration of testosterone use 
could result in masking of an existing transient associ-
ation. Future research is needed to confirm this tempo-
ral increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism and 
to investigate the risk in first time testosterone users 
and confirm the absence of risk with long term use.
Conclusions
Starting testosterone treatment, whether first time or 
repeat use, is associated with an increased risk of 
venous thromboembolism that peaks rapidly in the first 
three months and declines gradually thereafter. This 
association is strengthened by a stronger association in 
the subgroup of patients without a known risk of 
venous thromboembolism. Overlooking the timing and 
duration of testosterone use in previous studies could 
have masked the association between testosterone use 
and cardiovascular events.

was required for the analysis of the data. The CPRD Group has 
obtained ethical approval from a multi-centre research ethics 
committee for all purely observational research using CPRD data; 
namely, studies that do not include patient involvement (the vast 
majority of CPRD studies). Data that could directly identify the patient 
were not collected in this study.
Data sharing: Clinical Practice Research Datalink data cannot be 
shared because of licensing restrictions.
Transparency: The lead author affirms that this manuscript is an 
honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported; 
that no important aspects of the study have been omitted; and that 
any discrepancies from the study as planned (and, if relevant) have 
been explained.
