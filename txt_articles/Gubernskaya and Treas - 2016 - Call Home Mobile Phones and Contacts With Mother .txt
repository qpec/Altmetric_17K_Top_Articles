Abstract
This paper explores how the diffusion of mobile phones is associated with communication 
between adult children and their mothers. The paper analyzes 2001 International Social Survey 
Program (ISSP) data from 24 countries (N = 12,313) combined with the country-level data on the 
prevalence of mobile phones. Net of individual-level predictors and country wealth, adult children 
who resided in countries with high prevalence of mobile phones contacted their mothers more 
frequently. High prevalence of mobile phones was also associated with larger differences in 
maternal contact by gender and smaller differences by education. These findings suggest that any 
impact of new communication technology on intergenerational relations is complex. Although 
mobile phones point to higher levels of at-a-distance contact with mothers and narrower socio-
economic disparities related to access and affordability of communication technology, they are 
also linked to wider contact disparities following gendered cultural expectations.

Parent-child relationships in adulthood are important for the well-being of both generations. 
The two-way exchange of money and informal services constitutes a valuable resource, 
which is often activated in time of need (Attias-Donfut, Ogg, & Wolff, 2005; McGarry & 
Schoeni, 1995; Suitor, Sechrist, Gilligan, & Pillemer, 2011). With rapid population aging 
and mounting concerns about possible declines in family support for older people in many 
countries, understanding the factors behind intergenerational contact and support is 
important.
Previous research has investigated how socio-demographic characteristics of parents and 
adult children are related to the scope and intensity of intergenerational contact (Crimmins 
& Ingegneri, 1990; Dewit, Wister, & Burch, 1988; Grundy & Shelton, 2001; Lawton, 
Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994). Fewer studies have explored how intergenerational contacts 
have changed over time. Surprisingly, despite predicted declines in intergenerational

 solidarity (Treas, 1977; Uhlenberg, 1993), research has found an increase in maternal 
contact over the past few decades in several countries (Kalmijn & De Vries, 2009; Treas & 
Gubernskaya, 2012). Running against prevailing theoretical considerations and unexplained 
by either demographic or ideational changes (Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012), the increase in 
contacts with mothers is puzzling.
This article emphasizes a factor that is largely missing from the discussion of 
intergenerational solidarity – the rapid development and diffusion of new communication 
technologies. Early on, theorists speculated that mobile phones had the potential to change 
the nature of family relations. By reducing the impediments to kin solidarity, they would 
permit greater interaction between family members, particularly those separated by 
geographic distance (DiMaggio, Hargittai, Neuman, & Robinson, 2001). However, in part 
because these technological developments were relatively recent, in part because the data 
were rarely available, the “mobile phone” thesis remained untested.
This paper fills this gap in the research on intergenerational contact by investigating whether 
diffusion of mobile phones at a country level is associated with 1) the frequency of adult 
children’s contacts with their mothers and 2) the socio-demographic disparities in maternal 
contact, particularly by gender, age and education. We combine detailed individual-level 
data from 24 countries that participated in the 2001 International Social Survey Program 
(ISSP) “Social Networks” module with country-level data on mobile phone use from the 
World Bank (2011). Random-intercept, maximum likelihood, linear models with the cross-
level interactions show that the links between the availability of new communication 
technology and the patterns of family communication are complex. On average, maternal 
contact was higher in countries that experienced greater proliferation of mobile phones. 
Because prior research has ruled out socio-demographic change as the factor behind 
historical increases in mother-adult child contact and because increases have been limited to 
“contact at a distance” such as phone calls (Kalmijn & De Vries, 2009; Treas & 
Gubernskaya, 2012), mobile phones emerge as a highly plausible explanation of increased 
contact. On whether mobile phones equalize disparities in contact by age, gender, and socio-
economic status, mobile phone prevalence is linked to narrower disparities in some cases 
and wider ones in others.
MOBILE PHONES AND INTERGENERATIONAL CONTACT
Each new technological advance gives rise to both utopian and dystopian views (e.g., 
Fischer, 1992; Marvin, 1988). On the impact of mobile phones on social life (DiMaggio et 
al., 2001; Katz, 2006), “time-space compression,” “time-space distanciation,” and “the end 
of geography” were invoked by theorists who argued that new technology would make 
geographic separation irrelevant (Giddens, 1981; Graham, 1998; Harvey, 1989). According 
to empirical research, however, new technologies do not revolutionize family 
communication so much as they supplement existing patterns (DiMaggio et al., 2001). Long 
distance phone calls and emails, for example, replaced letters as means of sharing 
information with relatives and close friends separated by long distances, but they did not 
make geographic separation irrelevant for family support and exchange (DiMaggio et al., 
2001).

 Mobile phones have received relatively little attention in research on intergenerational 
contact, but according to the limited research in the area, the use of new technology in 
family communication is extensive. Parents rely on mobile phones to monitor their teenage 
children’s whereabouts (Devitt & Roker, 2009). Teenagers count on mobile phones to reach 
parents in case of emergency and sometimes turn to text messages to communicate on 
sensitive issues (Devitt & Roker, 2009). Mobile phones, telephone calling cards, and email 
are used extensively by transnational families in order to keep in touch (Vertovec, 2004; 
Wilding, 2006). Although initially slower than young people to adopt these innovations, 
older adults have also learned to use the new technology (Sawchuk & Crow, 2012; Tee, 
Brush, & Inkpen, 2009).
Country-to-country differences in the diffusion of new communication technologies are an 
untested explanation for differences in kin contact, particularly those that do not involve 
face-to-face interaction. As Figure 1 shows, mobile phones did not appear in general 
consumer markets before the early 1990s. In 1990, their availability in Europe, Australia and 
the U.S. was essentially zero. From this zero baseline, the number of mobile phone 
subscriptions per 100 persons in any given year captures not only cross-sectional mobile 
phone saturation in a country, but also how much mobile phone access had grown. By the 
start of the 21st Century, there was already substantial variation between countries, because 
some countries were early adopters and others lagged behind in the move to mobile phones. 
The variation was reduced later in the period when virtually everyone everywhere had 
adopted the technology. In 2001, the year for which we have data on maternal contact, the 
number of mobile phone subscriptions ranged from about 5 per 100 persons in Russia to 
almost 90 per 100 in Italy. In short, the dawn of the 21st Century pinpoints a time of 
substantial cross-country variation in the use of mobile phones, which permits strategic tests 
of hypotheses regarding communication technology. Given previous research on the 
extensive use of mobile phones for family communication, we expect:
Hypothesis 1: Higher prevalence of mobile phones will be associated with 
more frequent contacts between adult children and their mothers.
MOBILE PHONES AND SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL 
CONTACT
Diffusion of new technology is likely to influence not only the frequency of maternal contact 
but also socio-demographic differences in the frequency of contact. Universal access to 
technology equalizes opportunities to contact mothers by reducing the structural barriers to 
interaction. For instance, mobile phone calls have replaced long distance land-line calls that 
were expensive and not universally available, especially in remote and rural regions. The 
better educated are among the early adopters of new technology (Rice & Katz, 2003), partly 
because they are exposed to innovations at work and partly because they can afford them. 
With greater diffusion of mobile phones, frequent calls become available to those with 
relatively low incomes and limited schooling. Thus, the disparities in contact due to socio-
economic constraints on communication should decrease if mobile phones are more readily 
available.

 Hypothesis 2: Higher prevalence of mobile phones will be associated with 
smaller disparities in maternal contact by education.
On the other hand, greater availability of mobile phones may widen gaps in contact 
frequency if they enable even higher levels of communications for those adult children who, 
according to the dominant cultural norms, are expected to provide practical care and 
emotional support to mothers. Given their responsibilities for caregiving and kinkeeping, 
women establish stronger bonds with relatives, especially their mothers, and daughters 
contact their mothers more frequently than sons (Dewit et al., 1988; Spitze & Logan, 1991; 
Treas, 1977; Treas & Cohen, 2006; Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012). Previous research, 
however, found no gender differences in overall mobile phone use at the turn of the 21st 
Century (Rice & Katz, 2003). If gender differences in maternal contact reflect cultural 
norms and gender roles, we expect daughters to use new communication technology more 
than sons to keep in touch with mothers.
Hypothesis 3: Higher prevalence of mobile phones will be associated with 
greater disparities in maternal contact by gender.
Since communication is a two-way process that reflects preferences and needs of both 
generations, mobile phones may also be linked to greater contact for those adult children 
who are more dependent on their mothers. Contacts are most frequent between parents and 
children in their late teens and early twenties (Grundy & Shelton, 2001; Treas & Cohen, 
2006; Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012). When young adults leave the parental home (e.g., for 
work or education) and start their own families, their contacts with parents drop off (Bucx, 
Van Wel, Knijn, & Hagendoorn, 2008). Later in the life course, parental contacts tend to 
increase, reflecting aging parents’ greater need for support, but interaction rarely matches 
the high levels seen in young adulthood (Bucx et al., 2008; Ward, Deane, & Spitze, 2013). 
Broad demographic shifts suggest that young adults may be more dependent on their parents 
than in the past due to a prolonged transition to adulthood, delayed family formation and 
high economic insecurity (Settersten, 2007). The diffusion of mobile phones may enable 
ever higher levels of communication between young adults and their mothers. Greater 
availability of mobile phones is unlikely to increase middle-aged children’s contact with 
aging mothers to the same degree, if only because older people are usually among the last to 
adopt technological innovations (Rogers, 2003).
Hypothesis 4: Higher prevalence of mobile phones will be associated with 
higher frequency in maternal contact among young adults compared to other 
age groups.
METHOD
The 2001 data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) “Social Networks” 
module provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of mobile phones on 
intergenerational contact in an historical period when personal use of this technology varied 
widely across and, most likely, within the countries. The ISSP collected information on the 
frequency of adult children’s contacts with mothers in 24 nations. Diverse in terms of 
geographic region, level of economic development, and welfare state regime, the countries 
are Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,

 Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, 
Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S. The analytical sample is limited to adult 
children, ages 18 and above, with a surviving mother who did not reside in the same 
household with the child. The country-specific sample sizes and descriptive statistics are 
presented in the Appendix Table A.
The dependent variable, the frequency of maternal contacts that do not involve face-to-face 
interaction, comes from the question: “How often do you have any contact with your mother, 
besides visiting, either by telephone, letter, fax or email?” The response categories were: 
“daily” (6), “at least several times a week” (5), “at least once a week” (4), “at least once a 
month” (3), “several times a year” (2), “less often” or “never” (1). The missing values on the 
dependent variable do not exceed 2%, and we exclude these cases from the analysis.
Individual-level control variables are suggested by prior research on kin contact. Gender is a 
dummy variable (female = 1, male = 0). Age is categorized into 10 year groups with middle 
aged adults, 35–44, as the omitted reference category. Due to low frequencies in some 
categories in some countries, marital status has only two categories: not married (reference, 
0), which includes never married, divorced/separated and widowed, and married/cohabiting 
(1). Education is recoded into three categories: “primary” (no education, primary or 
incomplete secondary), “secondary” (complete secondary) and “high” (some college, 
college or post-graduate). Different coding schemes for education, such as using years of 
education as a continuous variable or creating a 4-category variable, produced very similar 
results (results available on request). We opted for a three-category variable to better 
illustrate the interaction effects. Employment status is a dummy variable: employed full- or 
part-time (1) and other (0). Measured by frequency of attendance at religious services, 
religiosity is a categorical variable ranging from “never” (1) to “once a week” (6). Proximity 
to mother is measured as travel time to the place where she lives. This categorical variable is 
coded as “less than 15 minutes” (1), “15 to 30 minutes” (2), “30 minutes to 1 hour” (3), “1 
to 2 hours”(4), “2 to 3 hours” (5), “3 to 5 hours” (6), “5 to 12 hours” (7), and “over 12 
hours” (8). As an indicator of familistic values, attitudes toward intergenerational support are 
measured by agreement with the statement: “Adult children have a duty to look after their 
elderly parents.” Likert-scale responses range from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly 
agree” (5). We treat travel time to mother, religiosity, and family attitudes as continuous 
variables.
To gauge the prevalence of new communication technology in each country, we use 2001 
data from the World Bank’s online database on the number of mobile phone subscriptions 
per 100 persons. Logged country GNP per capita in 2001 (The World Bank, 2011) is a 
control variable to adjust for societal wealth, which is positively correlated with the 
availability of mobile phones.
Our analytical strategy is, first, to describe the variation in maternal contacts across 
countries. Then, we construct nested multilevel, random intercept models that predict the 
frequency of the respondents’ contacts with mother. The first model includes only 
individual-level predictors. The next model adds the country-level variables to test the 
hypothesis that the diffusion of mobile phones in a country is positively associated with the

 higher frequency of maternal contact. The final model includes cross-level interaction terms 
to test how the differences in maternal contact vary by age, gender, and educational 
depending on the availability of mobile phones.
RESULTS
Figure 2 presents the mean frequency of maternal contacts at a distance for 24 nations in 
2001. As it shows, cross-national variation in intergenerational contact is substantial. On 
average, adult children in Israel contacted their mothers more than several times a week. 
Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Great Britain and the U.S. were among the countries where children 
contacted their mother more than weekly. Japanese, Brazilians and Russians contacted their 
mother, on average, only several times a month. Other countries fell in between.
Table 1 presents the findings from the random intercept models predicting the frequency of 
contacts with mother. Model 1 includes only the individual-level characteristics. Overall, the 
results are consistent with previous research on maternal contact. Compared to men, women 
are significantly more likely to contact their mothers. All things considered, younger adults 
interact with their mothers more frequently than their older counterparts do. The child’s 
marital status has no effect on frequency of contact with mother, but having more siblings or 
more children decreases contacts. Our admittedly crude measure of employment status has 
no significant effect, but better educated individuals tend to contact their mothers more 
frequently. So do those who agree that children have a duty to support aging parents, as well 
as those who are more religious. Residential distance, as gauged by travel time, has a strong 
negative relationship with contact frequency: the longer it takes to get to the mother’s home, 
the fewer contracts at a distance occur between grown children and mothers.
Model 2 adds to Model 1 the country-level predictors – the number of mobile phone 
subscriptions per 100 persons and logged GNP per capita. Supporting Hypothesis 1, the 
number of mobile phones subscriptions is positively associated with the frequency of 
contacts with mother, net of the individual-level predictors and the nonsignificant GNP 
indicator of country wealth. All things considered, adult children residing in countries with 
higher prevalence of mobile phones contact their mother more frequently. Including these 
two country-level factors also improves the model fit by reducing unexplained variation at 
the country level.
Model 3 includes cross-level interaction terms to test whether the differences in maternal 
contact by age, gender, and education vary by country-level mobile phone availability. The 
interaction terms between mobile phone subscriptions and the education categories are 
negative and statistically significant. Supporting Hypothesis 2, less educated adult children 
who reside in countries with higher prevalence of mobile phones contact their mothers more 
often than do adults with comparably low levels of education who reside in countries with 
low mobile phone prevalence. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the gender interaction term is 
positive and statistically significant, suggesting that the higher prevalence of mobile phones 
is associated with a higher frequency of maternal contact for women than men. Similarly, the 
positive and significant interaction coefficient for the adults ages 18–24 means that the 
greater availability of mobile phones is associated with more frequent maternal contact for

 this group than for the middle-aged reference group (age 35–44). On the other hand, the 
negative and significant interaction coefficient for adults ages 55 and over indicates that the 
association between the availability of mobile phones and contacts with mother is weaker for 
this group than for the middle-aged. Interestingly, the main coefficient for age 18–24 is no 
longer statistically significant, and the main coefficient for gender is substantially reduced. 
In other words, net of the other predictors, the gender difference and at least some age 
differences in maternal contact are significant only in countries with higher levels of mobile 
phones availability. As Hypothesis 4 predicted, greater availability of mobile phones is 
associated with noticeably higher frequency of maternal contact among the youngest adults.
Illustrating the effects of the cross-level interactions, Figures 3, 4 and 5 plot predicted mean 
frequencies of maternal contact by education, gender and age. As evident from Figure 3, the 
disparities in maternal contact by education level were much smaller in countries where 
mobile phones were more readily available. Where there were only 10 subscriptions per 100 
residents, those with primary education were predicted to contact mothers less than once a 
month as opposed to several times a month for those with college education. At 90 
subscriptions per 100, the comparable frequencies were between once and several times a 
week for both groups. Consistent with the notion of technology as a socio-economic leveler 
for family interaction, the differences in maternal contact by education are small and 
nonsignificant in countries with high prevalence of mobile phones. According to Figure 4, 
however, the availability of mobile phones had remarkable implications for the maternal 
contacts of women. Predicted to have only slightly more contacts with mothers than men in 
countries where mobile phones were rare, women’s frequency of contact with mother is 
considerably larger in countries with high prevalence of mobile phones. As a result, the 
gender disparities in countries with high prevalence of mobile phones were greater than in 
countries with low prevalence. As Figure 5 demonstrates, the differences in contacts with 
mother between the youngest respondents (age 15–24) and other adult children is greater in 
countries with higher prevalence of mobile phones.
DISCUSSION
This paper relates the diffusion of mobile phones to the patterns of intergenerational 
communication between adult children and their mothers. We hypothesized that the greater 
prevalence of mobile phones is associated with higher levels of maternal contact for children 
in adulthood. The results support this hypothesis. In 2001, in countries with higher rates of 
mobile phone subscriptions, adults report more frequent at-a-distance contact with mothers. 
The positive association with the number of mobile phone subscriptions at a country level is 
robust to the inclusion of per capita GNP, arguably the biggest factor in the selection of 
countries into the ranks of the early adopters of new communication technology.
In addition, we address speculation on whether new communication technology is related to 
socio-demographic disparities in maternal contact. The findings argue against universal 
generalizations. Higher prevalence of mobile phones is associated with wider disparities by 
gender and age, but narrower disparities by education. Being kinkeepers, women are 
apparently more responsive than men to the availability of cheaper, more convenient means 
to call home. Being more dependent on parents, the youngest adults are more sensitive than

 their seniors to availability of new communication technology. On the other hand, the less 
frequent maternal contact for socio-economically disadvantaged adults with low education – 
which is clear in countries where mobile phones are less common – is not found where these 
phones are ubiquitous. Admittedly, lacking data on whether respondents actually have 
mobile phones, country level prevalence of mobile phones is, at best, an expedient measure 
for their use for family communication. However, to the best of our knowledge, no large 
scale, national data set around 2001 has information on either availability or frequency of 
use of mobile phones.
Although our evidence does not firmly establish causation, the relationship of mobile phones 
and maternal contact should be interpreted in the context of a long-running debate about the 
viability of the extended family. Since the 19th Century when LePlay (1982) pointed to the 
decline of French farm families in the face of urbanization, social scientists assumed that 
extended family ties were waning (Burgess, 1926; Parsons, 1949). More recently, however, 
demographic changes are said to prompt a resurgence of intergenerational solidarity 
(Bengtson, 2001). A study of 1986–2001 changes in maternal contact using ISSP data – 
arguably the best historical evidence on trends in intergenerational interaction – identified 
increases, not decreases, in adult child-mother contact at a distance over time in the seven 
Western nations surveyed (Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012). The 1986–2001 changes in the 
socio-demographic composition of the populations accounted for a trivial share of the 
increased frequency in maternal contact. Population shifts simply cancel one another out. 
For instance, although the religiosity promoting intergenerational cohesion declined, this 
development was offset by the declining married population, which interacted less with 
parents than unmarried children do (Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012). If increased contact was 
driven by changes in attitudes, adult children presumably would have also visited mothers 
more often, but the prior study found that increased contact was limited to interactions that 
did not require being personally present (e.g., phone calls). If neither changing preferences 
nor changing populations explain the increase in remote contacts, communication 
technology introduced between 1989 and 2001 offers an alternative account. For several 
countries, residential proximity between adult children and mothers became less 
consequential for contact at a distance over this period (Treas & Gubernskaya, 2012), 
consistent with theoretical arguments that new communication technology mitigated 
constraints on communication imposed by distance. However, our results do not fully 
support the “end of geography” (Graham, 1998) and “time-space distanciation” (Giddens, 
1981) claims. We tested for the significance of country-level phone subscription interacted 
with respondent proximity. These results were not statistically significant (not presented but 
available on request). That is, contrary to the “end of geography” thesis, geographic 
proximity was a strong predictor of intergenerational contact, regardless of the availability of 
mobile phones. Similarly, non-significant interactions between phone subscriptions and 
familistic attitudes demonstrated the importance of values and preferences to contact across 
all levels of technology. Of course, other technologies, specifically internet usage, also 
increased (albeit more slowly) over this period, but our analyses did not find a statistically 
significant association between the number of internet users per 100 persons and maternal 
contact in 2001.

 Inferring change from cross-sectional data on the mobile phone subscription rates for 24 
countries in 2001 runs the risk of “reading history sideways” (Thornton, 2001). This 
developmental fallacy arises when societies defined as “backward” are taken as the starting 
point to gauge the progress of other societies said to be more “advanced”. We make no such 
assumption because we know a critical fact. As recently as 1990, there were no “advanced” 
societies in terms of consumer markets for mobile telephones: In all 24 countries, people had 
virtually no access to mobile phones. Mobile phone subscription rates in 2001 are, in 
essence, change scores, providing direct evidence on how rapidly new technology diffused 
in each country beginning in the early 1990s. In interpreting mobile phones as consequential 
for contact, we cannot rule out that countries where people placed a higher value on kin 
contact before having access to mobile phones may also have been quicker to adopt the new 
technology. We show here, however, that the relation between mobile phones and maternal 
contact holds even with controls for two indicators of values (religiosity and belief in grown 
children’s responsibility for parents).
In short, across 24 countries, this paper demonstrates that the country-level prevalence of 
mobile phones is positively associated with the frequency of at-a-distance maternal contact. 
It also shows that this prevalence is linked to the differences in contact by gender, by age, 
and by education. Because other kin relations are no doubt subject to many of the same 
influences as mother-child interaction, future research should examine whether greater 
availability of new technology is associated with more contacts between other family 
members as well. Although a cross-sectional study falls short of a conclusive test of the 
thesis that mobile phones increased kin contact over time, it contributes to an accumulating 
body of evidence that is consistent with a consequential role for communication technology 
in facilitating more frequent interaction between parents and grown children. In an era of 
rapid innovation, this study points to the need for research that examines how family life is 
responding to the new ways to keep in touch.
