With the Provision of Low-Value Care in the United States
John N. Mafi, MD, MPH; Christina C. Wee, MD, MPH; Roger B. Davis, ScD; Bruce E. Landon, MD, MBA, MSc
IMPORTANCE Hospital-employed physicians provide primary care within the hospital or
within community-based office practices. Yet, little is understood regarding the influence of
hospital location and ownership on the delivery of low-value care.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of hospital location and hospital ownership with the
provision of low-value health services.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study compared low-value service use after
primary care visits at hospital-based outpatient practices from January 1, 1997, to December
31, 2011, vs community-based office practices and at hospital-owned vs physician-owned
community-based office practices from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2013. Logistic
regression models adjusted for patient and health care professional characteristics and year,
and weighted results were used to reflect population estimates. Results were also stratified
by symptom acuity and whether a generalist physician (eg, general internist or family
practitioner) was the patient’
s primary care provider. This study used nationally
representative data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (January 1, 1997, to
December 31, 2013) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (January 1,
1997, to December 31, 2011) on outpatient visits to generalist physicians. Participants were
patients seen with 3 common primary care conditions, namely, upper respiratory tract
infection, back pain, and headache.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The use of antibiotics (for upper respiratory tract infection),
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (for back pain and headache),
radiographs (for upper respiratory tract infection and back pain), and specialty referrals (for
all 3 conditions).
RESULTS This study identified 31 162 visits for upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, and
headache, representing an estimated 739 million US primary care visits from 1997 to 2013.
Compared with visits with community-based physicians, patients in visits to hospital-based
physicians were younger (mean age, 44.5 vs 49.1 years; P < .001) and less frequently saw
their primary care provider (52.7% vs 81.9%, P < .001). Although antibiotic use was similar in
both settings, hospital-based visits had more orders for computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging (8.3% vs 6.3%, P = .01), radiographs (12.8% vs 9.9%, P < .001), and
specialty referrals (19.0% vs 7.6%, P < .001) than community-based visits. Multivariable
adjustment and symptom acuity stratification revealed similar findings. Visits with a
generalist other than the patient’
s primary care provider were associated with greater
provision of low-value care but mainly within hospital-based settings. Practice patterns were
similar among hospital-owned vs physician-owned community-based practices with the
exception of specialty referrals, which were more frequent in hospital-owned
community-based practices.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Visits to US hospital-based practices are associated with
greater use of low-value computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,
radiographs, and specialty referrals than visits to community-based practices, and visits to
hospital-owned community-based practices had more specialty referrals than visits to
physician-owned community-based practices. These findings raise concerns about the
provision of low-value care at hospital-associated primary care practices.

L
ow-value care is defined as patient care that provides
minimal average benefit in specific clinical scenarios.1
Despite decades of widely publicized studies and na-
tional clinical guidelines, our health care system still pro-
vides large amounts of low-value care, such as advanced di-
agnostic imaging for low back pain or headache or antibiotics
for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).2-5 Evidence also
suggests that many of these unnecessary services are increas-
ingovertime.6,7Eliminatinglow-valuecarecouldnotonlysub-
stantially lower health care costs but also reduce preventable
patient harm, such as exposure to adverse reactions from un-
necessary antibiotics or excessive irradiation from diagnostic
imaging.3,6-9
Little is known about the correlates of low-value care in
the United States, and such an understanding is essential in
determining the most effective interventions to curb the use
ofsuchservices.Previousworksuggeststhatvariationinhealth
care delivery is in part influenced by structural factors,10 such
as practice location or practice ownership.11-14 For example,
hospital-based outpatient practices (outpatient practices
located on hospital campuses) typically have more readily ac-
cessible technologies, such as nearby advanced imaging scan-
ners and specialty services compared with community-
based office practices.15 In contrast, community-based office
practices that are owned by a hospital may have more sala-
ried physicians with less incentive to overuse health ser-
vices, compared with physician-owned community-based
practices, where compensation may be more related to the vol-
ume of services provided. Few studies have evaluated the ex-
tent to which practice location and ownership characteristics
influence the provision of low-value ambulatory care.
In this context, we used nationally representative data
on ambulatory visits to generalist physicians (eg, general
internists or family practitioners) to determine whether
ambulatory practice location and ownership are associated
with the provision of low-value health services for 3 com-
mon conditions (URTI, back pain, and headache) seen in the
primary care setting.
Methods
WeusedthemostrecentlyavailabledatafromtheNationalAm-
bulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hos-
pital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) on ambu-
latory visits to physicians from January 1, 1997, to December
31, 2013, for the NAMCS and from January 1, 1997, to Decem-
ber31,2011,fortheNHAMCS.TheNAMCSiscomposedofprob-
ability samples of outpatient visits to nonfederal office-
based physician practices, while the NHAMCS consists of data
on visits to nonfederal hospital outpatient departments and
emergency departments. Designed in parallel, the NAMCS and
NHAMCS share common design, variables, and patient visit
weights. They are also both structured to represent ambula-
tory visits to physicians across the United States.16,17 The Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board
determined that this study was exempt from review and from
participant informed consent.
Data Collection Procedures
The NAMCS and NHAMCS use standardized surveys com-
pleted soon after a visit. Both include chief symptom infor-
mation, symptom duration and context, and 2 other nonpri-
mary reasons for the visit. The NAMCS and NHAMCS also
contain up to 3 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes, and both in-
clude patient, health care professional, payer, and practice set-
ting characteristics as well as diagnostic tests, treatments, and
medications listed during the visit. From 2005 to 2013, the
NAMCS and NHAMCS also collected data on 14 common co-
morbidities (eg, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and cancer). Missing data are rare (eg, an-
swers to the survey question, “Have you or anyone in this prac-
tice seen this patient before?” are missing 2.9% of the time),
and multiple imputation techniques are used in these cases.1
Eligible Visits
We selected outpatient visits for common conditions seen in
the primary care setting, which we defined as patient visits to
an internist, general practitioner, or family practitioner physi-
cian in the NAMCS and as patient visits to physicians in gen-
eral medical clinics in the NHAMCS (we also included a small
number of visits to nurse practitioners and physician
assistants).1,15 Based on prior research, we chose the follow-
ing 3 episodic conditions that are frequently associated with
low-value care: (1) URTI (such as acute bronchitis and pharyn-
gitis),(2)backpain,and(3)headache.Theseconditionsarecom-
monly treated by generalists or in general medical clinics and
are based on prior research.1,6,7
We excluded visits with clinical red flags noted on the
symptoms or diagnoses addressed at the visit that would in-
dicate more serious or complex presentations. As described
previously,1,3,6,7,18 such visits include symptoms or diagnoses
of cancer for patients seen with back pain or symptoms or di-
agnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for pa-
tients seen with URTI.
Key Points
Question What is the influence of practice location and
ownership on the provision of low-value care?
Findings In this nationally representative sample of primary care
visits, hospital-based outpatient practices used more low-value
computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,
radiographs, and specialty referrals for common conditions than
community-based office practices, particularly during
hospital-based visits with someone other than the patient’
s
primary care provider. Hospital-owned community-based
practices made more specialty referrals than physician-owned
community-based practices but were otherwise similar.
Meaning Hospital-based practices provided more low-value care
than community-based practices, and hospital-owned
community-based practices made more specialty referrals than
physician-owned community-based practices. These findings raise
concerns about the provision of low-value care at
hospital-associated primary care practices.

Practice Location and Ownership of Community Practices
Hospital-basedpracticeswererepresentedbytheNHAMCSout-
patient department data, whereas community-based prac-
tices were derived from the NAMCS data, using the private solo
or group practice setting variable. We excluded other settings
included in the NAMCS, such as health maintenance organi-
zations, federally qualified health centers, mental health cen-
ters, non–federal government clinics, family planning clin-
ics, freestanding clinics and urgent centers, faculty practice
plans, and other settings because they fell outside of the scope
of our primary care–focused study or had insufficient num-
bers of visits.
The NAMCS also provided information on the owners of
the community practice, specifically, whether the practice set-
ting is owned by a physician group or owned by a hospital.12,19
We defined hospital-owned practices as community-based
practices owned by an academic medical center or other hos-
pital. Physician-owned practices were defined as community-
based practices owned by a physician or physician group.
Primary Outcome Measures
Ourprimaryoutcomeswerebroadlyacceptedmeasuresoflow-
valuecarethatwerealsoendorsedbytheChoosingWiselycam-
paign for the 3 common conditions of uncomplicated URTI,
back pain, and headache.20 We considered low-value care as
the use of antibiotics for patients with URTI, the use of com-
puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
for patients with back pain or headache, and the use of radio-
graphs for patients with URTI or back pain. As a secondary out-
come, we evaluated referrals to another physician for all 3 con-
ditions because they typically should be managed in primary
care settings, and specialty referrals could be indicative of fur-
ther unnecessary downstream use (the referral variable was
added to the survey instruments starting in 1999).
Potential Confounders
Our analyses adjusted for potential confounders. They in-
cluded age (measured as a continuous variable in years), sex,
race/ethnicity (defined as a single 4-level variable of white,
black,Hispanic,andother),modifiedCharlsoncomorbiditydis-
ease count,1,21 insurance status, urban vs rural location, geo-
graphic region (1 of 4 quadrants in the United States), and year.
We also specifically evaluated whether practice location
was confounded by symptom acuity, patient comorbidities,
and whether the generalist was the patient’s primary care
provider (PCP) (in this study, provider refers to physicians,
nurse practitioners, and physician assistants). For all chief
symptom items, the NAMCS and NHAMCS symptom
duration or context variable divides into the following 5 cat-
egories: (1) new-onset symptoms (<3 months’ duration),
(2) acute on chronic flare-up (acute exacerbation of a chronic
condition), (3) chronic routine, (4) routine or preventive
care, and (5) preoperative or postoperative visit. We defined
acute visits by combining the categories of new-onset symp-
toms with acute on chronic flare-up. For additional case-mix
assessment beyond the Charlson comorbidity disease count,
we also evaluated the 14 comorbidities (eg, congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer,
only available from 2005 onward) directly collected by the
survey (collected from the problem list or medical record)
from 2005 to 2011.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary analyses focused on examining the following 2
associations:(1)theassociationbetweenpracticelocation(hos-
pitalbasedvscommunitybased)andlow-valueserviceuseand
(2) the association between hospital ownership of community-
based practices and low-value service use. We used the com-
bined data from the NAMCS and NHAMCS through 2011 to ex-
amine the first association and used only the NAMCS data
through 2013 to test the second association.
We pooled all years in each outcome category and used bi-
variable logistic regression models to compare low-value ser-
vice use between hospital-based practices vs all community-
based practices (NHAMCS vs NAMCS, January 1, 1997, to
December 31, 2011) and between hospital-owned community-
based practices vs physician-owned community-based prac-
tices(NAMCSvsNAMCS,January1,1997toDecember31,2013).
Inourmultivariable-adjustedanalyses,weadjustedforthepre-
viously mentioned demographic, clinical, and health care pro-
fessional variables. We also controlled for year.
Because our first study question might be particularly
prone to patient selection bias (eg, patients seen at hospital-
based practices may be more complex than those seen at com-
munity-based practices), we performed 4 prespecified sensi-
tivity analyses in which we evaluated the following important
potentialeffectmodifiers:(1)stratificationofresultsbywhether
the patient saw his or her usual PCP or another generalist (and
interacting the PCP variable with the practice location vari-
able), (2) stratification by acute vs nonacute presentations,
(3) comparison of the proportion of patients who had any of
the 14 comorbidities between hospital-based vs community-
based visits (and a subanalysis of adding patient comorbidity
counts to the models from 2005 to 2011), and (4) evaluation
of trends in use over time among hospital-based practices vs
community-based practices.
In 2007, the NHAMCS survey changed the question,
“Are you the patient’s primary care physician/provider?” to
“Is this clinic the patient’s primary care provider?” This
alteration could affect the PCP vs non-PCP analysis. There-
fore, we performed an additional sensitivity analysis evalu-
ating this stratification before and after the survey wording
change (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), which
revealed consistent results. In addition, to assess whether
the PCP variable also was reflecting continuity of care, we
performed a sensitivity analysis of only established clinic
patient visits by using a second variable that asked, “Have
you or anyone in this practice seen this patient before?” The
rationale is that established patients seeing their PCP would
better reflect continuity of care.
We performed all of our analyses with a software pro-
gram (SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 11.0; RTI International)
usingSUDAANsubpopulationprocedures.Thesefunctionsuse
data from the entire NAMCS and NHAMCS sample to account
for the complex multistage survey design and population
weighting to produce national estimates.22

Results
This study identified 31 162 visits for URTI (n = 11 049), back
pain (n = 14 821), and headache (n = 5695), representing an es-
timated 739 million US primary care visits from 1997 to 2013
(during a small percentage of visits, more than one of the study
conditions was addressed). Compared with community-
based visits, patients seen at hospital-based practices gener-
ally were younger (mean age, 44.5 vs 49.1 years; P < .001), and
the hospital-based health care professionals were less likely
tobethepatient’susualPCP(52.7%vs81.9%,P < .001)(Table1).
Patients seen at hospital-owned and physician-owned com-
munity practices were more similar demographically, al-
though physician-owned community-based practices had a
greater proportion of visits of patients of nonwhite race/
ethnicity than hospital-owned community-based practices.
Practice Location
Antibiotic use was similar in visits to both locations. How-
ever, visits to hospital-based practices had higher use of CT or
MRI (8.3% vs 6.3%, P = .01), radiographs (12.8% vs 9.9%,
P < .001),andspecialtyreferrals(19.0%vs7.6%,P < .001)com-
paredwithcommunity-basedvisits(Table2).Multivariablead-
justment revealed findings similar to the unadjusted results.

Regarding our first study question of comparing low-value ser-
viceuseathospital-basedvsallcommunity-basedpractices,we
evaluatedwhetherimportanteffectmodifierscouldexplaindif-
ferences in practice patterns. Stratification by PCP vs non-PCP
visits revealed that non-PCP visits were associated with higher
use of imaging and specialty referrals but primarily within
hospital-basedpractices(Table3).Forinstance,athospital-based
practice visits with non-PCPs, radiographs were ordered 13.7%
of the time vs 8.5% of the time among community-based non-
PCP visits (adjusted odds ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.39; P = .08

In our sensitivity analysis of only established clinic pa-

to 2005 onward when these data were available (eTable 4 in
the Supplement), we found that patients seen at community-
basedpracticeshadmorecomorbiditiesthanthoseseenathos-
pital-based practices (mean, 1.25 vs 1.09 comorbidities per pa-
tient, respectively; P = .03). When we added comorbidity
counts to our adjusted models, results remained unchanged.
Finally, use trends revealed that hospital-based practices con-
sistentlyprovidedmorelow-valueCTorMRI,radiographs,and
specialty referrals than community-based practices over time
(eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Community Practice Ownership
We found no significant differences between visits to hospital-
ownedcommunity-basedpracticesandphysician-ownedcom-
munity-based practices in terms of the use of antibiotics, CT
and MRI, or radiographs. However, we observed that visits to
hospital-owned community-based practices were associated
with more specialty referrals, although the magnitude of the
odds ratio was much smaller than was seen for hospital-
based practices. These results are summarized in Table 5.
Discussion
In this large and nationally representative sample of ambula-
tory care, we find that visits to hospital-based practices are as-
sociated with higher use of 3 forms of low-value health care
services compared with visits to community-based practices,
specifically, greater use of low-value CT and MRI and radio-
graphs and more low-value referrals to specialists. Moreover,
inhospital-basedpractices,low-valuecarewasassociatedwith
visits in which the health care professional was not the
patient’s PCP. These findings suggest that practice location has
a larger role than ownership or incentive factors in low-value
care delivery and that the association of these structural at-
tributes also appears to be related to visits to physicians who
are not the patient’s PCP. We also found that hospital-owned
community-based practices were associated with more low-
value specialty referrals than physician-owned community-
based practices, although the magnitude of the difference was
much smaller than was seen in hospital-based practices. Over-
all, these findings raise concerns about the provision of low-
value care at hospital-associated primary care practices.
Few prior studies directly compare the quality and effi-
ciency of care between hospital-based practices and commu-
nity-based practices. A comprehensive analysis using Medi-
care data from the 1980s found no meaningful differences in
quality and costs of care when comparing the 2 settings.23 An-
other national analysis using the NAMCS and NHAMCS data
from the 1990s found that clinicians at hospital-based prac-
tices ordered more imaging, minor surgical procedures, and
specialty referrals compared with community-based
clinicians,15 which is generally consistent with our findings.
However, the data from the latter study are almost 20 years
old, and the use measures were not calibrated to determine
the quality and efficiency of care because the analysis did not
exclude important guideline-based clinical red flags or ac-
count for symptom acuity. Moreover, neither of these prior
studies specifically compared differences in the use of low-
value care services. Therefore, our work adds recent data to
theliteratureandspecificallyhighlightsthegreateruseofcostly
and low-value services at hospital-based practices compared
with community-based practices.
We found that community-based practices that are owned
by hospitals use similar amounts of low-value antibiotics, CT
and MRI, and radiographs but made more specialty referrals
compared with physician-owned community-based prac-
tices. It is possible that hospital ownership of a practice leads
to easier access to specialists or a broader network of spe-
cialty services than physician ownership. Prior studies have
determined that more integrated health care systems deliver
more costly care, without any benefit in quality or efficiency
of care (and by some measures worse quality of care).11,24,25
However, at least in part, these results might be related to
higher reimbursement for hospital-owned practices, which we
did not assess in this study. Some commentators have raised
concerns that such arrangements could result in higher prices
and higher rates of overuse. Nevertheless, our study findings
suggest that hospital location is more important than hospi-
tal ownership in terms of the delivery of low-value care, al-

though hospital-owned community-based practices also more
frequently used specialty referrals.
Higher use of low-value services within hospital-based
practices may be related to greater availability of diagnostic
imaging and specialty services within hospitals.14,15 This no-
tion is supported by the fact that our results revealed differ-
ences primarily with the use of CT and MRI, radiographs, and
specialty referrals but not antibiotics, which would not be in-
fluenced by hospital location. We also found that the health
careprofessionalwasidentifiedasthepatient’sPCPinonlyhalf
of the visits in hospital-based practices vs in more than 80%
of visits to community-based generalists. These non-PCP vis-
its are associated with greater use of low-value services but pri-
marily within hospital-based settings. Such findings suggest
that the combination of hospital-based settings and disconti-
nuity of care may be related to greater use of low-value health
services.Priorstudies26-30foundthatgreatercontinuityofcare
with a PCP is associated with higher-value care in terms of in-
creased use of preventive care, reduced costs, and lower rates
of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and all-
cause mortality.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. The measures used herein do
not represent all low-value care, and we cannot definitively
conclude that our outcomes are low value in every instance
because we lacked the detailed clinical data required to iden-
tify the rare instances when the service might have been of
higher value. However, the measures we studied have been
widely identified as being low value in most circumstances,
andweusedrigorousmethodstoexcludecaseswithanysymp-
tomsordiagnosesofclinicalredflags,whichwerecreatedfrom
evidence-basedguidelinesandpriorresearch.1,3,6,7,18,31-34More-
over, our analysis excluded patients with the most important
markers of complexity relevant to our outcomes, such as any
diagnosis or symptom of trauma or neurological deficit among
patients with back pain. We also cannot eliminate the possi-
bility of selection bias because patients seen at hospital-
based practices may be more complex or may have different
preferences than patients seen at community-based prac-
tices. However, neither adjustment nor stratification by symp-
tom acuity altered our findings. In addition, our analysis re-
vealedthatcommunity-basedpracticepatientswereolderthan
hospital-basedpatients,andourcomorbiditysensitivityanaly-
sis (using medical record–verified comorbidities) found that
community-based patients had more comorbidities than hos-
pital-based patients. Because the NAMCS and NHAMCS share
common survey designs, patient weights, and variables (in-
cluding clinical diagnoses, imaging studies, specialty refer-
rals, etc), measurement error would be unlikely to differ by
practicesetting.Finally,wecouldnotcontrolforphysicianage,
and it is possible that younger physicians were in part driving
the greater use of low-value services within hospital-based
practices.35,36
Conclusions
In this nationally representative sample, we found that hos-
pital-basedpracticeswereassociatedwithmorelow-valuecare
compared with community-based practices and that low-
value care is associated with hospital-based practice visits in
which the health care professional was not the patient's usual
PCP. In contrast, hospital-owned practices were not associ-
ated with greater use of some low-value services compared
with physician-owned practices in the community-based set-
ting, but they used more specialty referrals than physician-
ownedcommunity-basedpractices.Thesefindingssuggestthat
practice location plays a greater role than practice ownership
in the delivery of low-value care and that low-value care may
be related to greater discontinuity of care within hospital-
based settings. Ultimately, these results raise general con-
cerns about the provision of low-value care at hospital-
associated primary care practices. Because almost one-third
ofhealthspendingisconsideredpotentiallywasteful,2ourfind-
ings have important implications for policymakers, health care
practice leaders, and clinicians, who have an interest in pro-
viding the highest-quality care at the lowest per capita cost.
