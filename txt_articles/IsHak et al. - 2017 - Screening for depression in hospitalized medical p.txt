Depression among hospitalized patients is often unrecog-
nized, undiagnosed, and therefore untreated. Little is known 
about the feasibility of screening for depression during hos-
pitalization, or whether depression is associated with poor-
er outcomes, longer hospital stays, and higher readmission 
rates. We searched PubMed and PsycINFO for published, 
peer-reviewed articles in English (1990-2016) using search 
terms designed to capture studies that tested the perfor-
mance of depression screening tools in inpatient settings 
and studies that examined associations between depression 
detected during hospitalization and clinical or utilization out-
comes. Two investigators reviewed each full-text article and 
extracted data. The prevalence of depression ranged from 5% 
to 60%, with a median of 33%, among hospitalized patients. 
Several screening tools identified showed high sensitivity and 
specificity, even when self-administered by patients or when 
abbreviated versions were administered by individuals without 
formal training. With regard to outcomes, studies from several 
individual hospitals found depression to be associated with 
poorer functional outcomes, worse physical health, and re-
turns to the hospital after discharge. These findings suggest 
that depression screening may be feasible in the inpatient set-
ting, and that more research is warranted to determine wheth-
er screening for and treating depression during hospitalization 
can improve patient outcomes. Journal of Hospital Medicine

In our current healthcare system, pressure to provide cost- 
and time-efficient care is immense. Inpatient care often fo-
cuses on assessing the patient’s presenting illness or injury 
and treating that condition in a manner that gets the patient 
on their feet and out of the hospital quickly. Because depres-
sion is not an indication for hospitalization so long as active 
suicidality is absent, inpatient physicians may view it as a 
problem best managed in the outpatient setting. Yet both 
psychosocial and physical factors associated with depression 
put patients at risk for rehospitalization.1 Furthermore, hos-
pitalization represents an unrecognized opportunity to opti-
mize both mental and physical health outcomes.2
Indeed, poor physical and mental health often occur 
together. Depressed inpatients have poorer outcomes, in-
creased length of stay, and greater vulnerability to hospital 
readmission.3,4 Among elderly hospitalized patients, depres-
sion is particularly common, especially in those with poor 
physical health, alcoholism,5 hip fracture, and stroke.6 Yet 
little is known about how often depression goes unrecog-
nized, undiagnosed, and, therefore, untreated.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec-
ommends screening for depression in the general adult pop-
ulation, including pregnant and postpartum women, and 
further suggests that screening should be implemented “with 
adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effec-
tive treatment, and appropriate follow-up.”2 The USPSTF 
guidelines do not distinguish between inpatient and outpa-
tient settings. However, the preponderance of evidence for 
screening comes from outpatient care settings, and little is 
known about screening among inpatient populations.7
This study had 2 objectives. First, we sought to examine the 
performance of depression screening tools in inpatient set-
tings. If depression screening were to become routine in hos-
pital settings, screening tools would need to be sensitive and 
specific as well as brief and suitable for self-administration by 
patients or for administration by nurses, resident physicians, 
or hospitalists. It is also important to consider administration 
by mental health professionals, who may be best trained to 
administer such tests. We, therefore, examined 3 types of stud-
ies: (1) studies that tested a self-administered screening instru-
ment, (2) studies that tested screening by individuals with-
out formal training, and (3) studies that compared screening 
tools administered by mental health professionals. Second, we 
sought to describe associations between depression and clini-
cal or utilization outcomes among hospitalized patients.

the review. However, we did not post a protocol in an online 
registry, formally assess study quality, or perform a meta-analysis.
Data Sources and Searches
We searched PsycINFO and PubMed databases for articles 
published between 1990 and 2016 (as of July 31, 2016). In 
PubMed, 2 search term strings were used to capture studies 
of depression screening tools in inpatient settings. The first 
used the advanced search option to exclude studies related 
to primary care settings or children and adolescents, and the 
second used MeSH terms to ensure that a wide variety of 
studies were included. Specific search terms are included in 
the Appendix. A similar search was conducted in the Psy-
cINFO database and these search terms are also included in 
the Appendix.
Study Selection
Articles were eligible if they were published in English in 
peer-reviewed journals, included at least 20 adults hospitalized 
for nonpsychiatric reasons, and described the use of at least 1 
measure of depression. The studies must have either tested the 
validity of a depression screening tool or examined the associ-
ation between depression screening and clinical or utilization 
outcomes. Two investigators reviewed each title, abstract, and 
full-text article to determine eligibility, then reached a con-
sensus on which studies to include in this review.
Data Extraction
Two investigators reviewed each full-text article to extract in-
formation related to study design, population, and outcomes re-
garding screening tool analysis or clinical results. From articles 
that assessed the performance of depression screening tools, we 
extracted information related to the nature and application of 
the index test, the nature and application of the reference test, 
the prevalence of depression, and the sensitivity and specificity 
of the index test compared with the reference test. For articles 
that focused on the association between depression screening 
and clinical or utilization outcomes, the data on relevant clin-
ical outcomes included symptom severity, quality of life, and 
daily functioning, whereas the data on utilization outcomes in-
cluded length of stay, readmission, and the cost of care.
RESULTS
Altogether, the search identified 3226 records. After elim-
inating duplicates and abstracts not suitable for inclusion 
(Figure), 101 articles underwent full-text review and 32 were 
found to be eligible. Of these, 12 focused on the association 
between depression and clinical or utilization outcomes, while 
20 assessed the performance of depression screening tools.

and the sensitivity and specificity of the index instruments 
relative to the reference instruments. Across the 20 stud-
ies, the prevalence of depression ranged from 15% to 60%, 
with a median of 34%.10–29 This finding may reflect different 
methods of screening or variation among diverse hospital-
ized populations. Many of the studies excluded patients with 
cognitive impairment or communication barriers.
The included studies tested a wide range of unique instru-
ments, and compared them with diverse reference standards. 
Five studies examined instruments that were self-admin-
istered by patients10–14; 9 studies assessed instruments ad-
ministered by nurses, physicians, or research staff members

without formal psychiatric training15–23; and 6 studies eval-
uated instruments administered by mental health profes-
sionals.24–29 Four studies compared different instruments that 
were administered in the same manner (eg, both self-admin-
istered by patients).12–14,22 In the remaining studies, both in-
struments and methods of administration differed between 
the index and reference conditions.
Eight studies tested brief instruments with 5 or few-
er items, most of which exhibited good sensitivity (range 
38%–91%) and specificity (range 68%–86%) relative to 
longer instruments.12,14–19,22 In 2 of these studies, instruments 
were self-administered. In 1 case, a single self-administered 
item from the STOP-D instrument (“Over the past 2 weeks, 
how much have you been bothered by feeling sad, down, or 
uninterested in life?”) performed nearly as well as the 14-
item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.14 In the other 
6 studies testing brief instruments, the instruments were ad-
ministered by individuals without formal training.15–19,22 In 1 
such study, geriatricians asking 2 questions about depressed 
mood and anhedonia performed well compared with a for-
mal psychiatric interview.17
Four studies tested variations of the Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS).12,18,21,23 In 3 of these studies, abbreviated versions 
of the GDS exhibited relatively high sensitivity and specifici-
ty.12,18,21 However, a study comparing the 15-item GDS (GDS-
15) with the GDS-4 found that GDS-15 correctly classified 
10% more patients with suspected depression.12 Two studies 
examined variations of the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ). One study found that both the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 
obtained by staff nurses performed well relative to a compre-
hensive assessment by a trained advanced practice nurse.13,19
When reported, positive predictive value, negative pre-
dictive value, and area under the receiver-operator curve 
were generally high.

ting,4,30–40 3 measured rates of rehospitalization.4,31,39 The 
other 9 studies tested for associations between symptoms of 
depression and either health or treatment outcomes. Table 2 
provides a more detailed description of the study designs and 
results.
Other studies found that depression was associated with 
reduced functional abilities such as mobility and self-
care,30,32–34 and increased hospital readmission31 as well as 
physical and mental health deficits.37 Interestingly, although 
1 study did not find that depression and hospital readmis-
sion were closely linked (frequency at 19%), it found that 
comorbid illness and previous hospitalizations predicted re-
admission.4
We also evaluated the associations between depression 
diagnosed in the inpatient studies and 2 types of outcomes. 
The first type includes clinical outcomes including symptom 
severity, quality of life, and daily functioning. Most studies 
we identified assessed clinical outcomes, and all detected an 
association between depression and worse clinical outcomes. 
The second type includes healthcare utilization, which can 
be measured with the patients’ length of hospital stay, read-
mission and cost of care. In 1 such study, Mitchell aet al.31 
reported a 54% increase in readmission within 30 days of 
discharge among patients who screened positive for depres-
sion.31 Additionally, Cully et al.30 found that depression may 
impinge on the recovery process of acute rehabilitation pa-
tients.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to describe the feasibility 
and performance of depression screening tools in inpatient 
medical settings, as well as associations between depression 
diagnosed in the inpatient setting and clinical and utiliza-
tion outcomes. The median rate at which depression was 
detected among inpatients was 33%, ranging from 5% to 
60%. Studies from several individual hospitals indicated 
that depression can be associated with higher healthcare 
utilization, including return to the hospital after discharge, 
as well as worse clinical outcomes. To detect undiagnosed 
depression among inpatients, screening appears feasible. 
Depression screening instruments generally exhibited good 
sensitivity and specificity relative to comprehensive clini-

cal evaluations by mental health professionals. Furthermore, 
several self-administered and brief instruments had good 
performance. Prior authors have reported that screening for 
depression among inpatients may not be particularly bur-
densome to patients or staff members.41
The studies we reviewed used diverse screening instru-
ments. Further research is needed to determine which tools 
are preferable in which patient populations, and to confirm 
that brief instruments are adequate for screening. The GDS 
is widely used, and many patients hospitalized in the United 
States fall into the geriatric group. The PHQ has been vali-
dated for self-administration and is widely used among outpa-
tients42; it may be more suitable for younger populations. We 
found that several abbreviated versions of these and other 
screening instruments have exhibited good sensitivity and 
specificity among inpatients. However, many of the studies 
excluded patients with cognitive impairment or communica-
tion barriers. For individuals with auditory impairment, the 
Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards (BASDEC) 
might be an option. Used in 2 studies, the BASDEC involves 
showing patients a deck of 19 easy-to-read cards. The time 
required to administer the BASDEC is modest.15,23 Sets of 
smiley face diagrams might also be suitable for some patients 
with communication barriers or cognitive impairment. An 
ineligible study among stroke survivors found that selecting a 
sad face had a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 77% rela-
tive to a formal diagnostic evaluation for depression.43
In considering the instruments that may be most suitable 
for inpatients, the role of somatic symptoms is also import-
ant because these can overlap between depression and the 
medical conditions that lead to hospitalization.44–46 Prior in-
vestigators found, for example, that 47% of Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) scores were attributable to somatic symp-
toms among patients hospitalized after myocardial infarc-
tion, whereas 37% of BDI scores were attributable to somat-
ic symptoms among depressed outpatients.47 Future research 
is needed to determine the significance of somatic symptoms 
among inpatients, including whether they should be consid-
ered during screening, add prognostic value, or warrant spe-
cific treatment. In addition, although positive and negative 
predictive values were generally high among the screening 
instruments we evaluated, confirming the diagnosis of de-
pression with a thorough clinical assessment is likely to be 
necessary.44,45
Despite the high prevalence of depression, associations 
with suboptimal outcomes, and the good performance of 
screening tools to date, screening for depression in the inpa-
tient setting has received little attention. Prior authors have 
questioned whether hospital-based screening is an efficient 
and effective way to detect depression, and have raised val-
id concerns regarding false-positive diagnoses and unneces-
sary treatment, as well as a lack of randomized controlled 
trials.7,48,49 Whereas some studies suggest that depression is 
associated with greater healthcare utilization,3,4 little infor-
mation exists regarding whether screening during hospital-
ization and treating previously undiagnosed depression im-
proves clinical outcomes or reduces healthcare utilization.
Several important questions remain. What is the patho-
physiology of depressed mood during hospitalization? How 
often does depressed mood during hospitalization reflect long-
standing undiagnosed depression, longstanding undertreated 
depression, an acute stress disorder, or a normal if unpleasant 
short-term reaction to the stress of acute illnesses? Do the 
manifestations and effects of depressed mood differ among 
these situations? What is the prognosis of depressed mood 
occurring during hospitalization, and how many patients 
continue to have depression after recovery from acute illness; 
what factors affect prognosis? In a small sample of hospital-
ized patients, nearly 50% of those who had been depressed at 
intake remained depressed 1 month after discharge.50 Given 
that most antidepressant medications have to be taken for 
several weeks before effects can be detected, what, if any, ap-
proach to treatment should be taken? More research is need-
ed on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diagnosing 
and treating depression in the inpatient setting.
This work has several limitations. We found relatively few 
studies meeting eligibility criteria, particularly studies assess-
ing clinical and utilization outcomes among depressed inpa-
tients. Among the screening tools that were studied in the 
hospital setting, the highly diverse instruments and modes 
of administration precluded a quantitative synthesis such 
as meta-analysis. Prior meta-analyses on specific screening 
tools have focused on outpatient populations.51–53 Further-
more, we did not evaluate study quality or risk of bias.
In conclusion, screening for depression in the inpatient 
setting via patient self-assessment or assessment by hospi-
tal staff appears feasible. Several brief screening tools are 
available that have good sensitivity and specificity relative 
to diagnoses made by mental health professionals. Limited 
evidence suggests that screening tools for depression may be 
ready to integrate into inpatient care.41 Yet, although depres-
sion appears to be common and associated with worse clinical 
outcomes and higher healthcare utilization, more research is 
needed on the benefits, risks, and potential costs of adding 
depression screening in the inpatient healthcare setting.
