Abstract
BACKGROUND—Obesity causes frailty in older adults; however, weight loss might accelerate 
age-related loss of muscle and bone mass and resultant sarcopenia and osteopenia.
METHODS—In this clinical trial involving 160 obese older adults, we evaluated the effectiveness 
of several exercise modes in reversing frailty and preventing reduction in muscle and bone mass 
induced by weight loss. Participants were randomly assigned to a weight-management program 
plus one of three exercise programs — aerobic training, resistance training, or combined aerobic 
and resistance training — or to a control group (no weight-management or exercise program). The 
primary outcome was the change in Physical Performance Test score from baseline to 6 months 
(scores range from 0 to 36 points; higher scores indicate better performance). Secondary outcomes 
included changes in other frailty measures, body composition, bone mineral density, and physical 
functions.
RESULTS—A total of 141 participants completed the study. The Physical Performance Test 
score increased more in the combination group than in the aerobic and resistance groups (27.9 to 
33.4 points [21% increase] vs. 29.3 to 33.2 points [14% increase] and 28.8 to 32.7 points [14% 
increase], respectively; P=0.01 and P=0.02 after Bonferroni correction); the scores increased more 
in all exercise groups than in the control group (P<0.001 for between-group comparisons). Peak 
oxygen consumption (milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute) increased more in the 
combination and aerobic groups (17.2 to 20.3 [17% increase] and 17.6 to 20.9 [18% increase], 
respectively) than in the resistance group (17.0 to 18.3 [8% increase]) (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). Strength increased more in the combination and resistance groups (272 to 320 kg

 [18% increase] and 288 to 337 kg [19% increase], respectively) than in the aerobic group (265 to 
270 kg [4% increase]) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Body weight decreased by 9% in all 
exercise groups but did not change significantly in the control group. Lean mass decreased less in 
the combination and resistance groups than in the aerobic group (56.5 to 54.8 kg [3% decrease] 
and 58.1 to 57.1 kg [2% decrease], respectively, vs. 55.0 to 52.3 kg [5% decrease]), as did bone 
mineral density at the total hip (grams per square centimeter; 1.010 to 0.996 [1% decrease] and 
1.047 to 1.041 [0.5% decrease], respectively, vs. 1.018 to 0.991 [3% decrease]) (P<0.05 for all 
comparisons). Exercise-related adverse events included musculoskeletal injuries.
CONCLUSIONS—Of the methods tested, weight loss plus combined aerobic and resistance 
exercise was the most effective in improving functional status of obese older adults. (Funded by 
the National Institutes of Health; LITOE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01065636.)
More than a third of persons 65 years of age or older in the United States are obese,1 and 
this group constitutes a population vulnerable to adverse outcomes, because obesity 
exacerbates the age-related decline in physical function and causes frailty.2–5 However, 
appropriate management of obesity in older adults remains controversial, given the reported 
reduction in relative health risks associated with increasing body-mass index in this group.6 
Moreover, an important concern is that weight loss could worsen frailty by accelerating the 
age-related decline in muscle and bone mass and resultant sarcopenia and osteopenia.7,8
Given the positive effects of exercise on physical function, healthy aging in obese older 
adults might require an intervention that involves regular exercise.9 We reported previously 
that exercise (combined aerobic and resistance training) in combination with weight loss was 
associated with greater improvement in physical function than weight loss alone or exercise 
alone.10 However, exercise attenuated but did not prevent loss in muscle and bone mass 
induced by weight loss and ameliorated but did not reverse frailty. The physiologic 
adaptations to aerobic and resistance exercise are distinctly different: aerobic exercise 
improves cardiovascular adaptations that increase peak oxygen consumption without 
significantly changing strength, whereas resistance exercise improves neuromuscular 
adaptations that increase strength without significantly changing peak oxygen 
consumption.11 These physiologic adaptations may interfere with each other when the two 
types of training are performed together.12–14 In the current clinical trial, we compared the 
effectiveness of aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and combined exercise in reversing 
frailty and preserving muscle and bone mass during weight loss in obese older adults. We 
hypothesized that weight loss plus resistance exercise would improve physical function more 
than weight loss plus aerobic exercise or weight loss plus combined aerobic and resistance 
exercise.
METHODS
STUDY OVERSIGHT
We conducted the Lifestyle Intervention Trial in Obese Elderly (LITOE) from April 2010 
through June 2015 at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and New Mexico 
Veterans Affairs Health Care System. The study was approved by the institutional review 
board of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and was monitored by an

 independent data and safety monitoring board; all participants provided written informed 
consent. All the authors had access to the data and vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and 
completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The 
first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript; all the authors participated in subsequent 
drafts and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. No commercial 
support was received.
PARTICIPANTS
Participants were recruited through advertisements and underwent comprehensive medical 
screening. Persons were eligible for inclusion if they were 65 years of age or older, were 
obese (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters] ≥30), were sedentary (regular exercise <1 hour per week), and had had a stable body 
weight (loss or gain of no greater than 2 kg) and stable medication use for 6 months before 
enrollment. All participants had mild-to-moderate frailty, as defined by a score of 18 to 31 
on the modified Physical Performance Test (scores range from 0 to 36 points, with higher 
scores indicating better performance).15 Persons who had severe cardiopulmonary disease 
(e.g., recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina), musculoskeletal or neuromuscular 
impairments that precluded exercise training, or cognitive impairments or who used drugs 
that affect bone metabolism were excluded.
STUDY OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was the change in score on the Physical Performance Test from 
baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in other frailty measures, body 
composition, bone mineral density, specific physical functions, and quality of life.
INTERVENTION
In this 26-week study, participants were randomly assigned, with stratification according to 
sex, to one of four groups — a control protocol that included neither a weight-management 
nor an exercise intervention, an aerobic group that participated in a weight-management 
program and aerobic exercise training, a resistance group that participated in a weight-
management program and resistance exercise training, and a combination group that 
participated in a weight-management program and combined aerobic and resistance exercise 
training.
The control group was asked not to participate in external weight-loss or exercise programs. 
However, this group attended group educational sessions about a healthful diet during 
monthly visits.
The aerobic group participated in a weight-management program, in which the participants 
were prescribed a balanced diet that provided an energy deficit of 500 to 750 kcal per day 
and contained approximately 1 g of high-quality protein per kilogram of body weight per 
day.2 Participants met weekly with a dietitian for dietary adjustments and behavioral therapy 
(diet therapy). They were instructed to set weekly behavioral goals and attend weigh-in 
sessions. Food diaries were reviewed, and goals were set on the basis of diary reports. The 
goal was to achieve a weight loss of approximately 10% at 6 months. They also participated

 in aerobic exercise training sessions three times weekly. The sessions were approximately 60 
minutes long and included 10 minutes of flexibility exercises, followed by 40 minutes of 
aerobic exercises and 10 minutes of balance exercises. The aerobic exercises consisted of 
treadmill walking, stationary cycling, and stair climbing. Participants exercised at 
approximately 65% of their peak heart rate, which was gradually increased to 70 to 85%.
The resistance group participated in the same weight-management program as the aerobic 
group, as well as resistance exercise training sessions three times weekly; the sessions were 
approximately 60 minutes long and included 10 minutes of flexibility exercises, followed by 
40 minutes of resistance exercises and 10 minutes of balance exercises. The resistance 
training consisted of nine upper-body and lower-body exercises using weight-lifting 
machines. The initial sessions were 1 to 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions at 65% of the one-
repetition maximum. This was increased progressively to 2 to 3 sets at approximately 85% 
of the one-repetition maximum.
The combination group participated in the same weight-management program as the other 
exercise groups, as well as combined aerobic and resistance exercise training sessions three 
times weekly. The sessions were 75 to 90 minutes long and included 10 minutes of 
flexibility exercises, followed by 30 to 40 minutes of aerobic exercises, 30 to 40 minutes of 
resistance exercises, and 10 minutes of balance exercises. To test the interference effect,12–14 
aerobic and resistance training were balanced between groups: the longer duration of 
exercise in the combination group allowed the participants to perform an amount of aerobic 
exercise that was equivalent to that of the aerobic group and an amount of resistance exercise 
that was equivalent to that of the resistance group.
Exercise sessions were supervised by exercise trainers. Participants were advised to maintain 
their usual physical activity outside of exercise sessions. All participants received 
supplements to ensure an intake of approximately 1500 mg of calcium per day and 
approximately 1000 IU of vitamin D per day.2
BASELINE ASSESSMENTS
Physical Function—Frailty was assessed with the Physical Performance Test. The 
Physical Performance Test includes seven standardized tasks (walking 15.2 m [50 ft], 
putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, 
climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg test) plus two additional 
tasks (going up and down four flights of stairs and making a 360-degree turn). The score for 
each task ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better physical performance; a 
perfect score would be 36.15 Frailty was also assessed by measurement of peak oxygen 
consumption and by administration of the Functional Status Questionnaire. Peak oxygen 
consumption was assessed during graded treadmill walking, as described previously.3 
Ability to perform activities of daily living was assessed with the use of the Functional 
Status Questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating better 
functional status).16 We also assessed strength, balance, gait speed, and one-repetition 
maximum (the maximum weight a participant can lift, in one attempt, in the biceps curl, 
bench press, seated row, knee extension, knee flexion, and leg press). We assessed static 
balance by measuring the time a participant could stand on a single leg3 and dynamic

 balance by measuring the time needed to complete an obstacle course.15 Fast gait speed was 
assessed by measurement of the time needed to walk 7.6 m (25 ft).
Body Composition and Bone Mineral Density—Fat mass, lean mass, and bone 
mineral density of the whole body and at the lumbar spine and total hip were measured with 
the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPX [General Electric] or Discovery A 
[Hologic] scanner), as described previously.3,17 For each participant, baseline and follow-up 
scans were obtained with the use of the same instrument. Thigh muscle and fat volumes 
were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetom Avanto [Siemens]), as described 
previously.18
Quality of Life—We used the physical and mental component subscales of the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), version 2, to evaluate quality 
of life.19 Scores on the physical and mental component subscales of the SF-36 range from 0 
to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status; the minimal clinically important 
difference is 2 points.20
FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS
All baseline assessments were repeated at 6 months. The Physical Performance Test was 
also repeated at 3 months. Assessors were unaware of the study-group assignments.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We estimated that a sample size of 40 participants per group would provide 80% power to 
detect a mean (±SD) clinically important difference between groups of 1.8±2.5 in the change 
in score on the Physical Performance Test, at an alpha level of 0.05. Intention-to-treat 
analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Baseline 
characteristics were compared with the use of analysis of variance or Fisher’s exact test. 
Longitudinal changes between groups were tested with the use of mixed-model repeated-
measures analysis of variance, with adjustment for baseline values and sex. The primary 
focus of the analyses was the 6-month change in outcome in the four groups. When the 
overall P value for the interaction between group and time was less than 0.05, prespecified 
comparisons were used to test five hypotheses: that changes in the aerobic group would 
differ from those in the control group, that changes in the resistance group would differ from 
those in the control group, that changes in the aerobic group would differ from those in the 
resistance group, and that changes in the combination group would differ from those in the 
aerobic group and from those in the resistance group. For the Physical Performance Test 
score, Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for these comparisons. Within-group 
changes were analyzed with the use of repeated-measures analysis of variance. Secondary 
outcomes were grouped into five domains. In accordance with a gatekeeping strategy,21 a 
significant group-by-time interaction (P<0.01) and at least one significant difference 
between an exercise group and the control group and at least one significant difference 
among the exercise groups in the change in score on the Physical Performance Test were 
required to continue to testing of secondary outcomes; comparisons of the exercise groups 
with the control group were performed with Dunnett’s test and comparisons among the 
intervention groups were performed with the Fisher–Hayter test22 (Fig. S1 in the

 Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Sensitivity 
analyses that validated the statistical results included multiple imputation for missing fitness 
data. Data for change scores and percentage changes are presented as least-squares–adjusted 
means (±SE).
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION
A total of 160 participants underwent randomization, and 141 participants (88%) completed 
the study (Fig. 1). Nineteen participants discontinued the intervention and were included in 
the intention-to-treat analyses (follow-up data were obtained for all 19 participants at 3 
months but not at 6 months). There were no significant differences among the groups in 
baseline characteristics (Table 1).
Median attendance at the diet-therapy sessions was 96% (interquartile range, 87 to 100) in 
the aerobic group, 100% (interquartile range, 90 to 100) in the resistance group, and 97% 
(interquartile range, 89 to 100) in the combination group. Median attendance at exercise 
sessions was 96% (interquartile range, 84 to 100) in the aerobic group, 98% (interquartile 
range, 81 to 100) in the resistance group, and 93% (interquartile range, 83 to 100) in the 
combination group.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Exercise-related adverse events included falling, shoulder pain, and back pain in the aerobic 
group; atrial fibrillation, shoulder pain, and knee pain in the resistance group; and shoulder 
injury, knee pain, back pain, and hip pain in the combination group. There were no other 
differences in adverse events relative to the control group (Table S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TEST AND OTHER FRAILTY MEASURES
The scores on the Physical Performance Test increased more in the combination group than 
in aerobic or resistance groups: 27.9 to 33.4 points (a change of 5.5±0.4 points [21% 
increase from the least-squares adjusted mean at baseline]) versus 29.3 to 33.2 points (a 
change of 3.9±0.4 points [14% increase]) and 28.8 to 32.7 points (a change of 3.9±0.4 points 
[14% increase]), respectively; scores in all three exercise groups increased more than scores 
in the control group (4% increase) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). Peak oxygen consumption 
(measured as milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute) increased more in the 
combination and aerobic groups than in the resistance group: 17.2 to 20.3 (a change of 
3.1±0.3 [17% increase]) and 17.6 to 20.9 (a change of 3.3±0.3 [18% increase]), respectively, 
versus 17.0 to 18.3 (a change of 1.3±0.3 [8% increase]) (Table 2 and Fig. 2B). Functional 
Status Questionnaire scores increased more in the combination group than in the aerobic and 
resistance groups: 29.8 to 33.4 points (a change of 3.6±0.3 points [14% increase]) versus 
30.1 to 32.1 points (a change of 2.0±0.3 points [7% increase]) and 29.3 to 31.6 points (a 
change of 2.3±0.3 points [8% increase]), respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 2C).

 BODY COMPOSITION
Body weight decreased in the aerobic group (96.9 to 87.9 kg; a change of −9.0±0.6 kg, [9% 
decrease]), in the resistance group (101.8 to 93.3 kg; a change of −8.5±0.5 kg [9% 
decrease]), and in the combination group (99.0 to 90.5 kg; a change of −8.5±0.5 kg [9% 
decrease]), but there was no significant change in body weight in the control group (97.9 to 
97.0 kg; a change of −0.9±0.5 kg [<1% decrease]) (Table 2). The time course of weight loss 
is shown in Figure 3. Lean mass decreased less in the combination group (56.5 kg to 54.8 
kg; a change of −1.7±0.3 kg [3% decrease]) and in the resistance group (58.1 to 57.1 kg; a 
change of −1.0±0.3 kg [2% decrease]) than in the aerobic group (55.0 to 52.3 kg; a change 
of −2.7±0.3 kg [5% decrease]) (Table 2 and Fig. 2D). Fat mass decreased by −6.3±0.5 kg in 
the aerobic group (41.9 to 35.6 kg [16% decrease]), −7.3±0.4 kg in the resistance group 
(44.3 to 37.0 kg [17% decrease]), and −7.0±0.5 kg in the combination group (42.5 to 35.5 kg 
[17% decrease]). The changes in thigh muscle and thigh fat among the exercise groups were 
similar to those observed for lean mass and fat mass, respectively.
BONE MINERAL DENSITY
Bone mineral density at the total hip did not change significantly in the resistance group 
(1.047 to 1.041 g per square centimeter; a change of −0.006±0.004 g per square centimeter 
[<1% decrease]), whereas it decreased in the aerobic group (1.018 to 0.991 g per square 
centimeter; a change of −0.027±0.004 g per square centimeter [2.6% decrease]) and in the 
combination group (1.010 to 0.996 g per square centimeter; a change of −0.014±0.004 g per 
square centimeter [1.1% decrease]) (Table 2 and Fig. 2E). Bone mineral density of the whole 
body and at the lumbar spine did not change significantly in any of the study groups (Table 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
STRENGTH, BALANCE, GAIT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE
Total one-repetition maximum strength increased in the resistance group (288 to 337 kg; a 
change of 49±5 kg [19% increase]) and in the combination group (272 to 320 kg; a change 
of 48±5 kg [18% increase]), whereas it was maintained in the aerobic group (265 to 270 kg; 
a change of 5±5 kg [4% increase]) (Table 2 and Fig. 2F). Time needed to complete the 
obstacle course decreased more in the combination group (17.0 to 14.1 seconds; a change of 
−2.9±0.3 seconds [13% decrease]) than in the aerobic group (15.5 to 14.0 seconds; a change 
of −1.5±0.4 seconds [7% decrease]). Gait speed increased more in the combination group 
(68.8 to 80.9 m per minute; a change of 12.1±1.3 m per minute [14% increase]) than in the 
aerobic group (74.6 to 82.7 m per minute; a change of 8.1±1.3 m per minute [9% increase]). 
The SF-36 physical-component score increased more in the combination group (45.9 to 55.4 
points; a change of 9.5±0.7 points [24% increase]) than in the aerobic group (48.6 to 55.1 
points; a change of 6.5±0.7 points [14% increase]) and the resistance group (51.0 to 58.4 
points; a change of 7.4±0.8 points [17% increase]) (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
DISCUSSION
Our randomized, controlled trial involving obese adults 65 years of age or older indicated 
that weight loss plus a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise improved physical

 function and reduced frailty more than weight loss plus aerobic exercise or weight loss plus 
resistance exercise. Evidence-based data to guide treatment of older adults with obesity are 
limited5,23,24 and tend to rely on studies involving younger adults.2 Our study directly 
compared aerobic, resistance, and combined (aerobic and resistance) training during weight 
loss in obese older adults. The matched weight loss across groups facilitated the assessment 
of the independent and combined effects of aerobic and resistance training. Despite a 
negative energy balance, aerobic training improved cardiovascular fitness and resistance 
training improved strength. Contrary to our hypothesis, combined aerobic and resistance 
training improved cardiovascular fitness to the same extent as aerobic training alone and 
strength to the same extent as resistance training alone. Therefore, combined aerobic and 
resistance training resulted in additive effects that translated into the greatest improvement 
among the interventions in physical function and reduction of frailty. Both resistance 
training and combined resistance and aerobic training attenuated the loss of lean mass during 
aerobic training. Moreover, although only resistance training prevented the weight-loss–
induced reduction in bone mineral density at the total hip, combined aerobic and resistance 
training nonetheless attenuated the loss of bone mineral density at the total hip during 
aerobic training. Our data suggest that obese older adults can adapt and respond to exercise 
training during an energy deficit and that combined aerobic and resistance training provides 
the greatest benefits with respect to physical function, with relative preservation of lean 
mass.
Our findings in obese older adults expand observations of the positive effects of exercise 
training without weight loss in nonobese older adults25,26 and support the results of previous 
studies that showed that exercise training was most beneficial in frail older adults in the 
earlier stages of frailty.27 Given the exercise goals for our frail and obese participants,28 we 
designed the aerobic and resistance training to be moderate to vigorous in intensity to induce 
exercise adaptations29 while keeping exercise volumes moderate.27 Using these exercise 
strategies, we found additive effects of aerobic and resistance training without interference 
effect from concurrent training.12–14 Adherence to exercise was high despite frailty, and 
adverse events were relatively few and consistent with coexisting medical conditions. Our 
findings suggest that the recommendation by the American Heart Association and American 
College of Sports Medicine to combine aerobic exercise with resistance exercise for overall 
health30 extends to obese older adults undertaking weight loss.
The improvements in objective measures of frailty in our participants may have important 
implications for preserving independent living. The Physical Performance Test assesses 
multiple domains of physical function15 and predicts disability, loss of independence, and 
death.31,32 The peak oxygen consumption relative to body weight is the best indicator of 
cardiovascular endurance33 and is important for performing daily tasks with increased body 
weight.3,34 Improvements in the objective Physical Performance Test score and peak oxygen 
consumption were consistent with improvements in Functional Status Questionnaire and 
SF-36 scores, which indicate subjective improvements in functional ability.
Although combined aerobic and resistance training improved physical function the most 
among the interventions, the reductions in lean mass and bone mineral density that were 
attenuated but not prevented might represent an adverse effect in that these reductions

 further diminish tissue reserves superimposed on age-related losses. However, resistance 
training improved strength despite muscle loss induced by weight loss. Conversely, whether 
improved physical function lowers the risks of falls and fractures despite the decline in bone 
mineral density is currently unclear. In future studies, additional strategies to preserve lean 
mass might include improving the efficiency of vitamin D and protein intake, increasing 
weight-bearing exercises, and perhaps administering anabolic hormone therapy.35,36 Another 
adverse effect was exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries, which could be minimized 
through individualized exercises.
Strengths of our study include the randomized, controlled trial design, the comprehensive 
lifestyle programs, the high rate of adherence to the trial interventions, the similar weight-
loss management that allowed for unbiased group comparisons, and the use of objective and 
subjective measures of physical function. Because this was an efficacy study, the 6-month 
duration was appropriate to determine which exercise was most efficacious in improving 
physical function during weight loss. Data from long-term studies that show whether weight 
loss plus combined aerobic and resistance training prolongs physical independence in obese 
older adults are currently lacking. The findings from our study may have pragmatic 
implications, because Medicare currently covers behavioral therapy for weight loss,37 and a 
growing number of Medicare plans now offer gym memberships.38 Data from a previous 
trial show that older adults may be more successful in achieving long-term weight loss than 
younger adults.39
Our study has limitations. First, in accordance with the exclusion criteria, the participants in 
our study were physically able to participate in a lifestyle program and thus may not be fully 
representative of the general obese older adult population. Second, our sample was not large 
enough to analyze differences according to sex. Finally, most of the participants were 
women, white, and well educated, which limits broader generalization.
In conclusion, our study showed that weight loss plus resistance training or aerobic training 
improved physical function and ameliorated frailty; however, weight loss plus combined 
aerobic and resistance training provided greater improvement in physical function and 
reduction of frailty than either intervention alone and was associated with relative 
preservation of lean mass.

 Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, and Follow-up
The study groups included a control group that received neither a weight-management nor 
an exercise intervention and three exercise groups: a group that received aerobic exercise 
training (aerobic group), a group that received resistance exercise training (resistance group), 
and a group that received combined aerobic and resistance exercise training (combination 
group); all three exercise groups also participated in a weight-management program.

Measures of physical function included the Physical Performance Test (PPT; scores range 
from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating better functional status), peak oxygen 
consumption, Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ; scores range from 0 to 36, with higher 
scores indicating better functional status), and strength (measured as total one-repetition 
maximum [i.e., the total of the maximum weight a participant can lift, in one attempt, in the 
biceps curl, bench press, seated row, knee extension, knee flexion, and leg press]). Scores on 
the PPT were used as an objective measure of frailty (primary outcome), and scores on the

*Plus-minus values for the change scores are the least-squares adjusted means ±SE from the repeated-measures analyses of variance; plus-minus values for the baseline values are the observed means ±SE. 
Scores on the Physical Performance Test (PPT) (primary outcome) range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating better physical function; the minimal clinically important difference is 1.8. Peak oxygen 
consumption (VO2peak) was assessed during graded treadmill walking. Scores on the Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ) range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating better function. BMD denotes 
bone mineral density.
†P values for the changes from baseline to 6 months in between-group comparisons were calculated with the use of mixed-model repeated-measures analyses of variance (with baseline values and sex as 
covariates) and are reported when the overall P value was lower than 0.05 for the interaction among the four groups over time. In a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the multiple comparisons in the PPT 
score (in which the P values were multiplied by 5 for the comparison with an alpha level of 0.05), the corrected P values were 0.01 for the combination group versus the aerobic group and 0.02 for the 
combination group versus the resistance group. In accordance with a gatekeeping strategy, a significant group-by-time interaction (P<0.01) and at least one significant difference between an exercise group 
and the control group and at least one significant difference among the exercise groups in the change in PPT score were required to continue to testing of the secondary outcomes; comparisons of the

‡P<0.001 for the comparison of the value at the follow-up time with the baseline value within the group, as calculated with the use of mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance.
§The between-group differences were not significant in the last three columns because the group-by-time interaction for the three intervention groups (step 1 of the Fisher–Hayter test) was not significant; 
the family-wise error rate of 0.05 or less is maintained for the Fisher–Hayter multiple comparison procedure.
