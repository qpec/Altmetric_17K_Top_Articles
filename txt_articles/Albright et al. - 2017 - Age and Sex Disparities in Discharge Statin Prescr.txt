Background-—Stroke is a costly and debilitating disease that disproportionately affects blacks. Despite the efficacy of statins,
evidence suggests racial disparities may exist in statin prescribing.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed discharge medications for participants hospitalized for an ischemic stroke during follow-up of
the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study. Medications on admission and discharge were
abstracted from medical records. Among the 666 eligible incident strokes (2003–2013), analyses were restricted to 323
participants who were not statin users at the time of admission and had no history of atrial fibrillation. Overall, 48.7% were
prescribed a statin on discharge. In the Stroke Belt, participants aged 65 years and older were 47% less likely to be discharged on
a statin compared with those younger than 65 years (relative risk [RR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.74). This association was not
observed in non–Stroke Belt residents. Outside the Stroke Belt, blacks were more likely than whites to be discharged on a statin
(RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04–1.94), while no black:white association was present among Stroke Belt residents (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69–
1.26; P for interaction=0.228). Compared with women, men in the Stroke Belt were 31% less likely to be discharged on a statin
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.94) while men outside the Stroke Belt were more likely to be discharged on a statin (RR, 1.38; 95% CI,
0.99–1.92; P for interaction=0.004).
Conclusions-—Statin discharge prescribing may differ among Stroke Belt and non–Stroke Belt residents, particularly in older
Americans and men. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005523. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.005523.)

E
ach year, 795 000 people in the United States experi-
ence a new or recurrent stroke.1 Stroke is a leading
cause of serious, long-term adult disability, with estimated
direct and indirect costs of $71.6 billion in 2012.1 The
majority of strokes (85%) are ischemic, with an annual
recurrence rate of 5% to 15%.1–9 The importance of secondary
stroke
prevention
is
paramount,
since
the
estimated
6.6 million adult stroke survivors in the United States are at
increased risk for stroke recurrence.10 Recurrent strokes are
often more disabling and costly than incident stroke.11
The SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in
Cholesterol Levels) trial demonstrated the efficacy of HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors (statins) in preventing recurrent stroke in
patients without coronary heart disease.12,13 A Cochrane
review of randomized controlled trials suggests that patients
with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, with or
without a history of coronary heart disease, should receive
statins.14 Despite the demonstrated efficacy of statins in
preventing recurrent stroke, some studies suggest that lipid-
lowering agents are not being equally prescribed for all patients
with stroke at the time of hospital discharge.15,16
Most studies to date have focused only on patients from
hospitals participating in quality-improvement programs, thus
the overall proportion of the general population of patients
with ischemic stroke who receive a statin at discharge, and
the association of patient characteristics and discharge statin
prescribing remains unknown. The purpose of this analysis is
to estimate the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke

 who receive a statin at discharge and to document differences
in discharge statin prescribing by age, race, and sex, in and
out of the Stroke Belt17 using a national cohort of individuals
admitted to a variety of US hospitals. Given that patients
using a statin on hospital admission for stroke (prevalent
users) often differ from patients not actively using a statin by
age, risk factors, and comorbidities, this study focuses on
patients who were not using a statin at the time of stroke
admission.18
Methods
This report uses data from the REGARDS (Reasons for
Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study, a national,
prospective cohort trial of 30 239 US adults aged 45 years
and older, designed to investigate factors associated with the
excess stroke mortality observed among blacks compared
with whites and among residents of the Stroke Belt compared
with other geographic regions of the United States. The
Stroke Belt states include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.17,19 The methodol-
ogy of the REGARDS study has been previously described.20
Participant recruitment occurred from January 2003 through
October 2007. Baseline data were collected using a com-
puter-assisted telephone interview, self-administered ques-
tionnaires,
and
an
in-home
examination.
Demographic
information, medical history, and an array of other risk
factors were obtained at the baseline telephone interview. Of
relevance to the current analysis, the in-home examination
was conducted a median of 3 to 4 weeks after the computer-
assisted telephone interview and included blood pressure
measurements, collection of blood and urine samples,
anthropometry, and ECG. Participants were contacted every
6 months using the computer-assisted telephone interview
and asked whether they have been hospitalized, visited an
emergency department, or had a doctor’s visit that resulted in
an overnight stay in a hospital. If a participant or proxy
reported a potential stroke event (hospitalization or an
outpatient visit), his/her medical records were requested
and the case was adjudicated by an expert panel.21 Consent
was obtained verbally by phone and later in writing during the
in-person evaluation. The institutional review boards of the
participating institutions approved the study methods.
From the 1044 adjudicated ischemic strokes occurring
among REGARDS participants from January 2003 to October
2012, we excluded participants if they had inadequate medical
records available for review (n=32), were discharged from the
emergency department (n=37), were seen only in the outpa-
tient setting (n=93), died during stroke hospitalization or were
discharged to hospice (n=56), had incomplete medication
records (n=2), reported a history of stroke at the time of
REGARDS enrollment (n=158), had documented evidence
of statin use before admission (n=253), or had evidence of
atrial fibrillation (n=90), resulting in 323 adjudicated ischemic
strokes in the current analysis (Figure 1). Analyses were
restricted to individuals without atrial fibrillation, as individuals
with atrial fibrillation were excluded from SPARCL, the trial that
set the standard for statin use in secondary stroke preven-
tion.13 Because SPARCL was not published until 2006, we also
examined the proportion of statin prescribing by year.12
Outcomes of Interest
Medications on hospital admission and discharge associated
with the physician-adjudicated ischemic stroke events were
obtained from medical records by 2 data abstractors. A list of
each participant’s home medications (medications before
hospitalization) was obtained from the admission history and
physical examination and the medication reconciliation sheet.
Medications prescribed at the time of discharge were
obtained from the discharge summary and the inpatient
medication
reconciliation
sheet.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Among participants hospitalized for ischemic stroke who
were not already taking a statin, <49% were prescribed a
statin on discharge.
• Older Americans in the Stroke Belt were 47% less likely to
be discharged on a statin; this difference was not observed
in non–Stroke Belt residents.
• Blacks outside the Stroke Belt were 42% more likely to be
prescribed a statin on discharge; no black:white differences
were observed among Stroke Belt residents.
• In the Stroke Belt, men were 31% less likely to be
discharged on a statin; outside the Stroke Belt, men were
38% more likely to be discharged on a statin.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• In patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke, opportunities
exist to improve statin prescribing on discharge.
• Providers should remain cognizant that a meta-analysis of
placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials demon-
strated that statins reduce the risk of stroke in patients
with coronary heart disease and a randomized controlled
trial demonstrated that statin treatment reduces the risk for
recurrent stroke in patients with a history of stroke or
transient ischemic attack.
• All ischemic stroke survivors should be evaluated to
determine whether they could benefit from a statin,
regardless of the patient’s age, race, sex, or geographic
residence.

 adjudicated by 2 or more data abstractors. The primary
outcome of interest for this analysis was documented
evidence of statin prescribing at the time of discharge
(“prescribed”).
In an effort to reduce biases, such as confounding, we
restricted our analysis to participants who were not prevalent
users of statins (n=323) at the time of admission.18 An
individual was categorized as a prevalent user of statins if
there was documentation in the medical record of the
individual taking a medication from that class before admis-
sion. Participants who were not prevalent users of statins
before admission and were prescribed a statin at the time of
discharge were classified as incident statin users.
Exposures and Covariates
Age at the time of stroke, black race, and male sex were each
considered individually as exposures. Stroke Belt residence
was evaluated as an effect modifier by adding a Stroke Belt–
exposure interaction term to each exposure model. Given that
access to medical care has the potential to change with
Medicare eligibility, we examined age at the time of stroke as
a categorical variable (<65 years versus ≥65 years). All
participants self-reported race as either non-Hispanic black or
non-Hispanic white at the time of enrollment as described
above. Sex was also self-reported. Residence was self-
reported at the time of enrollment. Atrial fibrillation was
defined by self-report or ECG detection of atrial fibrillation.22
Hypertension was defined by self-report, self-reported use of
hypertension
medications,
or
systolic
blood
pressure
≥140 mm Hg
or
diastolic
blood
pressure
≥90 mm Hg
(average of 2 blood pressure measurements). Dyslipidemia
was defined as any of the following: self-reported high
cholesterol,
total
cholesterol
>200 mg/dL,
high-density
lipoprotein <40 mg/dL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
>100 mg/dL.23 Diabetes mellitus was defined by self-report

 or a fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL or a nonfasting
glucose level ≥200 mg/dL.24 Coronary heart disease was
defined by self-report of myocardial infarction, percutaneous
coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery
or ECG evidence of myocardial infarction. Chronic kidney
disease was defined as a glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/
min per 1.73 m2.25 Impaired cognition was defined as a
6-item screener score of ≤4 during the baseline computer-
assisted telephone interview.26,27 Variables related to smok-
ing, education, and income were dichotomized as current
smoking, obtaining at least a high school education, and
having an annual income <$20 000. US hospital character-
istics were obtained from the 2003 through 2013 American
Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals.28 The urban-
rural status of each hospital was defined according to a
modification of the rural-urban continuum classification
scheme using county-level data.29
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared between patients
prescribed statins and patients not prescribed statins, using t
tests for continuous variables and Pearson chi-square or
Fisher exact tests, where appropriate, for categorical vari-
ables. In an effort to prevent the potential interpretation of the
odds ratio as a relative risk, we evaluated the association
between statin prescribing at time of discharge and each
exposure of interest with crude and adjusted relative risk (ie,
risk ratio [RR]) using the modified Poisson regression
method.30 This method applies a robust error variance
procedure (ie, sandwich estimation) to account for overesti-
mation in the error term.30 RRs for statin prescribing were
calculated for age 65 years and older compared with age
younger than 65 years, blacks compared with whites, and
men compared with women, after adjustment for hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease,
chronic kidney disease, impaired cognition, current smoking,
high school education, and income. As we observed an
increasing trend in statin prescribing over time (Figure 2), we
included year of stroke in the multivariable models. Stroke
Belt residence was evaluated for effect modification by adding
a Stroke Belt–exposure interaction term (eg, male9Stroke
Belt residence) to each exposure model. In addition, sensi-
tivity analyses were performed including participants with
atrial fibrillation.
Results
Among the 323 participants with an incident stroke, the
median age was 74 years (interquartile range, 67–80), 48.9%
were black, 45.8% were men, and 55.7% were Stroke Belt

 residents. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of
eligible participants who were not taking statins (n=323) at
the time of admission by those who were and were not
discharged on statins. Overall, 48.7% of participants had
evidence of a statin prescribed at discharge. Participants who
were prescribed a statin at discharge were more likely to have
dyslipidemia compared with those who were not prescribed a
statin (92.1% versus 82.3%, P=0.008). There were no other
statistically significant differences between patients pre-
scribed and not prescribed a statin. Hospitals where partic-
ipants were prescribed a statin at discharge more frequently
reported resident training compared with the hospitals where
participants were not prescribed a statin at discharge (53.7%
versus 38.5%, P=0.006). There were no other statistically
significant differences between hospitals that did and did
not prescribe a statin at (Table 2). There was an increasing
trend in statin prescribing over time (P for trend <0.001)
(Table 3).
After multivariable adjustment, participants aged 65 years
and older were less likely to be prescribed a statin at
discharge (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57–0.99), while those with
dyslipidemia were more likely to be prescribed a statin at
discharge (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10–2.53) (Table 4). Partici-
pants were more likely to be prescribed a statin at discharge
over time (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08–1.18). There were no
statistically significant differences in statin prescribing by
race (black:white RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.91–1.41) or sex (male:
female RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78–1.21).
Interaction testing by Stroke Belt residence was statistically
significant at a 2-sided a≤0.1 for both age 65 years and older
(P=0.086) and male sex in the full models (P=0.004) (Table 5).
Within the Stroke Belt, participants aged 65 years and older
were 47% less likely to be discharged on a statin compared with
patients younger than 65 years (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.75).
This association was not observed in non–Stroke Belt residents
(RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.69–1.90; P for interaction=0.086). Among
non–Stroke Belt residents, blacks were more likely to be
discharged on a statin (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04–1.94). This
association was not present among black Stroke Belt residents
(RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69–1.26; P for interaction=0.228). Male
Stroke Belt residents were 31% less likely to be discharged on a
statin compared with their female counterparts (RR, 0.69; 95%
CI, 0.50–0.94). In non–Stroke Belt residents, men were more
likely to be discharged on a statin (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.99–1.92;
P for interaction=0.004). Results did not change significantly
when participants with atrial fibrillation were included in the
analyses (data not shown).
Discussion
Although statin prescribing increased over time in the current
study, statins were prescribed at discharge to only 49% of
patients with ischemic stroke. This represents a treatment gap
given current American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association (ACC/AHA) recommendations.10 Comparing the
estimate of statin discharge prescribing in the current study

 with prior reports is difficult because prior studies have used
broad definitions that include any lipid-lowering agent.10,12
Using these broad definitions, previous studies have reported
that 55% to 85% of patients with ischemic stroke receive lipid-
lowering therapy at discharge.15,16,31 Estimates from prior
studies were derived from clinical trials and hospitals dedicated
to improving the quality of inpatient stroke care. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the proportion of patients discharged on a
statin is lower in the current study that was derived from a
national cohort admitted to a variety of hospitals. While some
studies have reported muscle-related side effects in 10% to 25%
of patients receiving statin therapy,32,33 that proportion is not
large enough to account for our observation that only 49% of
ischemic stroke survivors were prescribed a statin at discharge.
Further, we did see an increase in statin prescribing over
time. The reasons for this are unclear. Since the Third Report
of
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
Expert
Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) was published
in 2001, it is unlikely that these guidelines influenced the
prescribing trends. Similarly, since the ACC/AHA Guideline on
the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic
Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was not published until 2013,
this could not have impacted statin prescribing in our study
since the strokes occurred from 2003 to 2013. Instead, the
increase may be partially attributed to the SPARCL trial, with
results published in 2006. Our data indicate that the first
increase in statin prescribing for patients without dyslipidemia
began in 2007. Further, results from SPARCL may have
focused more attention on statin prescribing for patients with
dyslipidemia, as the rates of prescribing for this group also
increased after 2006.
Past Get With The Guidelines-Stroke studies have shown that
patients admitted to hospitals in the South have lower odds of
having a statin prescribed at discharge.34 These lower odds in
discharge statin prescribing after stroke have also been
described in older individuals,34 women,34 and blacks,16 but
no study has specifically evaluated whether the magnitude of
these differences by age, sex, and race is the same inside and
outside of the Stroke Belt. By examining Stroke Belt residence
as an effect modifier, we were able to examine the direction and
magnitude of the age, sex, and race effect inside and outside of
the Stroke Belt. In contrast to previous studies that have
reported blacks as less likely to be prescribed statins,15,16 we
found no differences in discharge statin prescribing between
blacks and whites. There were, however, statistically significant
age and sex differences among Stroke Belt residents.
Reasons for older participants and men being discharged
on a statin less frequently among Stroke Belt residents are
likely multifactorial. Providers and family members of older
individuals and men may have had different goals of care

 influencing their decisions regarding secondary stroke pre-
vention. They may have had complicated hospital courses
resulting from uncontrolled vascular risk factors, inpatient
complications, or more severe strokes leading to less
aggressive inpatient stroke care.
Study Strengths and Limitations
The current study informs us on discharge statin prescribing
over time; the associations between age, race, sex, and
discharge statin prescribing; and the impact of Stroke Belt
residence on these associations. Unlike the samples used for
prior reports, the sampling of the REGARDS study allows for
detailed focus on geographic variations in discharge prescrib-
ing.20 Particular attention to Stroke Belt residence is essential
given that between 2% and 15% of the excess stroke mortality
traditionally attributed to race is actually attributable to
geography.35
The current study is not without limitations. Defining a
participant as a prevalent statin user relied on the available
medical documentation. Poor recall on the part of the patient
or family could have resulted in prevalent users being
misclassified as incident users (not taking a statin at the
time of admission). The proportion of participants who were

Disparities in Discharge Statin Prescribing
Albright et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 underestimated if incident users were not taking statins
because of previous statin side effects. Poor documentation
in the medical record at the time of discharge would result in
participants being misclassified as not prescribed a statin,
resulting in overestimates of the proportion not prescribed a
statin. We were unable to obtain reliable insurance informa-
tion, which may have impacted statin prescribing. However,
the majority of our sample was 65 years and older, ensuring
at least basic insurance coverage through Medicare.
Restricting our analysis to participants who reported not
taking a statin at the time of admission reduced our sample
size and may have impaired our ability to detect differences
in groups,18 but we employed an incident user design as an
attempt
to
that
ensure
prescribing
patterns
are
not
confounded by prior statin use. Thus, our findings may not
be generalizable to all individuals who experience a stroke,
most notably past or present statin users.18 Knowing that
individuals taking a statin may differ from those not taking a
statin in terms of the duration and severity of existing
comorbidities,18,36–38 we designed our study to focus on
individuals not taking a statin at the time of admission.36
Despite these limitations, this is one of few studies to report
on the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke dis-
charged on a statin, a secondary stroke prevention medica-
tion class proven effective in reducing recurrent stroke. One
strength of this study is its use of the REGARDS cohort data.
Using these data permits us to examine Stroke Belt
residence, factors related to stroke, and the discharge
prescribing of statins at a variety of hospitals nationwide,
avoiding the bias introduced by examining only patients
treated at hospitals participating in stroke quality-improve-
ment programs.
Conclusions
Although statins have been shown to lower the risk of
recurrent stroke, fewer than 50% of participants in a
nationwide cohort study were prescribed a statin at the time
of stroke hospital discharge. Among Stroke Belt residents,
individuals aged 65 years and older and men were less likely
to be discharged on a statin—not blacks—leaving the
reasons for higher rates of recurrent stroke in blacks
unresolved. A next step in our efforts to understand the
reasons for the higher rate of recurrent stroke in blacks is to
evaluate statin adherence in ischemic stroke survivors.
