Abstract 
Purpose: Supplementation with dietary forms of vitamin D is commonplace in clinical medicine, elite 
athletic cohorts and the general population, yet the response of all major vitamin D metabolites to high 
doses of vitamin D is poorly characterized. We aimed to identify the responses of all major vitamin D 
metabolites to moderate and high dose supplemental vitamin D3. 
Methods: A repeated measures design was implemented in which 46 elite professional European 
athletes were block randomized based on their basal 25[OH]D concentration into two treatment 
groups. Athletes received either 35,000 or 70,000 IU.week-1 vitamin D3 for 12 weeks and 42 athletes 
completed the trial. Blood samples were collected over 18 weeks to monitor the response to 
supplementation and withdrawal from supplementation. 
Results: Both doses led to significant increases in serum 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D3. 70,000 IU.week-
1 also resulted in a significant increase of the metabolite 24,25[OH]2D at weeks 6 and 12 that persisted 
following supplementation withdrawal at week 18, despite a marked decrease in 1,25[OH]2D3. Intact 
PTH was decreased in both groups by week 6 and remained suppressed throughout the trial. 
Conclusions: High dose vitamin D3 supplementation (70,000 IU.week-1) may be detrimental for its 
intended purposes due to increased 24,25[OH]2D production. Rapid withdrawal from high dose 
supplementation may inhibit the bioactivity of 1,25[OH]2D3 as a consequence of sustained increases in 
24,25[OH]2D that persist as 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D concentrations decrease. These data imply that 
lower doses of vitamin D3 ingested frequently may be most appropriate and gradual withdrawal from 
supplementation as opposed to rapid withdrawal may be favorable.

Introduction 
2 
Vitamin D and its metabolites can be described as a group of seco-steroid hormones derived primarily 
3 
from dermal synthesis following ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation exposure (sunlight) and also from the 
4 
diet. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), resulting from both skin exposure to UVB and in limited amounts 
5 
from dairy products, oily fish and meat, is considered to be the major contributor to vitamin D 
6 
concentration (14); whereas ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is exclusively derived from the diet of 
7 
irradiated plants and mushrooms, and appears to have less biological significance. Following the 
8 
photosynthetic conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 and subsequently vitamin D3 (or 
9 
cholecalciferol, 14) or following dietary intake, vitamin D is transported in the circulation to the liver 
10 
bound to the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), where it is hydroxylated at C-25 by the cytochrome 
11 
P450 enzyme CYP27A1 (25-hydroxylase) to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D or calcidiol). This 
12 
metabolite is then carried, again by DBP, to the kidney where at the proximal renal tubule it is 
13 
hydroxylated by CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase) at C-1α to form the biologically active metabolite, 1,25-
14 
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D or calcitriol)(1). The active compound, 1,25[OH]2D has long been 
15 
known as a potent modulator of mineral homeostasis via transactivation of genes related to the 
16 
maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. This biological activity is achieved through 
17 
interaction of 1,25[OH]2D3 with its receptor, the vitamin D Receptor (VDR), which heterodimerizes 
18 
with retinoid X receptor to form a transcriptional complex that can bind to vitamin D response 
19 
elements in the promoter of vitamin D regulated genes (12). 
20 
 
21 
In the past decade, understanding of the biological effects of vitamin D has grown exponentially due 
22 
to the development of the vitamin D knockout mouse (22) and high throughput gene microarray 
23 
techniques (2). Vitamin D is now understood to be not only an important regulator of mineral 
24 
homeostasis but may be influential in cell proliferation and differentiation (21), innate and acquired 
25 
immunity (13), muscle development and repair (26, 27) and in the prevention of psychological 
26 
diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This is particularly pertinent given the growing understanding that low 
27 
vitamin D concentrations (< 30 nmol.L-1) are highly prevalent worldwide in general (34) as well as 
28 
  
 
 
4 
athletic populations (4, 24). Despite a rich research base characterizing the biological importance of 
29 
vitamin D, the regulation of the vitamin D endocrine system is less well understood. Practically this is 
30 
an important consideration given that some authors advocate high doses of vitamin D, be administered 
31 
to individuals with osteomalacia/rickets caused by severe vitamin D deficiency (defined < 12.5 
32 
nmol/L), to ameliorate symptoms (15, 19). In the context of professional sport it is commonplace to 
33 
supplement entire teams with a blanket approach to vitamin D supplementation, often without basal 
34 
concentrations being assessed, and with a target concentration of >100 nmol/L the aim. Perhaps even 
35 
more concerning is that the sports teams have access to vitamin D in single capsule form at doses up to 
36 
50,000 IU (1,250 µg) making single dose weekly supplementation with mega doses practically very 
37 
simple and without definitive guidelines for supplementation this could result in more harm than 
38 
benefit. Such practice is in discord with recommendations set by the European Food Safety Authority, 
39 
whom advise a safe daily upper limit of 4,000 IU.day-1 (9), in line with advice portrayed by the US 
40 
Institute of Medicine (IoM) guidelines for vitamin D intake (33). Notably the US IoM also state a no 
41 
adverse effect limit (NOAEL) of 10,000 IU.day-1.  Evidence does not exist to appropriately define the 
42 
effect that high dose blanket supplementation protocols, commonly employed in elite sport, have upon 
43 
the negative regulators of the vitamin D endocrine system, notably 24,25-hydroxylase (CYP24A1 or 
44 
24-hydroxylase), which functions to inactivate both 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D3 (16) by hydroxylation 
45 
at C-24. It is important to characterize the response high dose blanket approaches in order to avoid 
46 
potentially detrimental effects of too much supplemental vitamin D and contribute toward the 
47 
establishment of the most safe and effective vitamin D supplementation schemes for elite athletes. 
48 
 
49 
The current study therefore aimed to characterize the serum responses of the major vitamin D 
50 
metabolites, 25[OH]D, 1,25[OH]2D3, 24,25[OH]2D and iPTH to high dose vitamin D supplementation 
51 
(35,000 and 70,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly) in an elite professional team sport cohort. It was 
52 
hypothesized that supplementation would dose dependently increase total serum 25[OH]D and the 
53 
active metabolite 1,25[OH]2D3 in a concomitant manner but would also increase the production of 
54 
24,25[OH]2D.

Methods 
57 
Participants 
58 
Forty-six elite male elite professional team sport athletes volunteered to participate in the current trial 
59 
(Age = 26 ± 3 years, height = 1.86 ± 0.6 m, weight 101.5 ± 11 kg, fat mass 11.4 ± 3 %). Participants 
60 
underwent a medical screening and provided full informed consent prior to inclusion into the study. 
61 
Participants were excluded if they were currently taking vitamin D supplements, using sun beds or 
62 
injured at the time of the study. Ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee of Liverpool 
63 
John Moores University (Ethics code 12/SPS/047). The recruitment for the study began in November 
64 
2012 and testing commenced in the same month. The study was concluded in April 2013. The study 
65 
was conducted at latitude 52oN during the winter months in order to limit sunlight exposure.  
66 
  
67 
Supplementation 
68 
Participants were randomly allocated to either 35,000 or 70,000 IU.week-1 supplemental vitamin D3 
69 
(Maxi Nutrition, UK), herein referred to as moderate and high, respectively. Randomisation was 
70 
achieved with blocking based on baseline serum 25[OH]D and the use of a random number table to 
71 
allocate participants into balanced groups. The random allocation sequence was allocated by a 
72 
member of the research team and known by the rest of the research team at the point of supplement 
73 
administration. The supplemental doses were chosen based on the fact that they represent widely 
74 
reported supplement strategies (PubMed literature based search), applied experience of the authors in 
75 
both clinical and elite sporting settings and also the NOAEL set by the US IoM. Supplements were 
76 
taken orally as a bolus in capsule form on a weekly basis to increase compliance with the protocol, 
77 
which was 100% as club staff were present during the weekly distribution of supplementation and 
78 
monitored the ingestion of capsules in order to track compliance. Supplementation continued for 12 
79 
weeks at which point supplementation was ceased to monitor the response of vitamin D metabolites to 
80 
withdrawal. Participants were blinded to the supplement they were receiving. Forty two players 
81 
completed the trial whilst four dropped out or were excluded for the following reasons; one player did 
82 
not tolerate venipuncture, one player would not comply with the supplementation protocol, two 
83 
players used sun beds during the trial. The vitamin D supplements were batch screened by 
84 
  
 
 
6 
chromatography and mass spectrometry for contaminants and confirmation of vitamin D content 
85 
stated on the label. Screening was performed in accordance with ISO standard 17025. Sunlight 
86 
exposure was minimal during the trial due to the latitude at which the players were based. Participants 
87 
travelled for a two-day match fixture to a foreign climate at latitude 43oN, in December during a 
88 
period of significant cloud cover. Thus, players were exposed to minimal amounts of sunlight during 
89 
the study period although no direct measurement of UV exposure was taken. 
90 
 
91 
Blood Sampling 
92 
Blood samples were drawn prior to supplementation (basal and then at 6, 12 and 18 (withdrawal) 
93 
weeks from the start of supplementation. Blood was obtained from the antecubital vein into two serum 
94 
separator tubes and two K2EDTA tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Co. Oxford, UK). Samples were then 
95 
separated to isolate serum/plasma via centrifugation at 1500 RCF for 15 minutes at 4 oC. 
96 
Serum/plasma was extracted and stored at -80 oC until required for analysis. All samples were 
97 
collected in the medical room of a professional sports club.

Analysis of Vitamin D Metabolites and Parathyroid Hormone 
100 
Liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of 25[OH]D3, 25[OH]D2, 
101 
24,25[OH]2D3 and 24,25[OH]2D2 was performed using a Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt mass 
102 
spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). NIST SRM972a traceable 25[OH]D3 and 25[OH]D2 
103 
calibration standards (Chromsystems, München, Germany) and quality controls (UTAK Laboratories, 
104 
CA, USA) were purchased commercially, ranged from 0-200 nmol/L. 24,25[OH]2D3 and 
105 
24,25[OH]2D2 calibration standards were prepared from certified standards (IsoSciences, King of 
106 
Prussia, PA, USA) spiked into human vitamin D depleted serum (BBI Solutions, Cardiff, UK), ranged 
107 
from 0-14.8 nmol/L. To 100 L of human serum samples, calibration standards and quality controls, 
108 
200 L of pretreatment solution consist of deuterated 25[OH]D3-[2H6] and 24R,25[OH]2D3-[2H6] in 
109 
isopropanol:water 50:50 (v/v) was added to displace binding proteins. After mixing, the samples were 
110 
loaded onto Supported Liquid Extraction (SLE+) plates (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden), which were 
111 
  
 
 
7 
eluted with 1.5 mL of n-heptane. The extraction procedure was performed by Extrahera positive 
112 
pressure automation system (Biotage). Eluents were dried under nitrogen, followed by reconstitution 
113 
with 50 L 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). After a 30 
114 
minute incubation period at room temperature, 50 L of water was added to stop the reaction. 20 L 
115 
of the derivatised extracts were injected into LC-MS/MS. Separation of vitamin D metabolites were 
116 
achieved using core-shell C18 2.7m 50  2.1mm (Restek, PA, USA) reversed-phase column. A 
117 
gradient elution profile was set up using mobile phase (A) LCMS grade water and (B) methanol 
118 
containing 0.2 mM methylamine in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient at the start was 50:50 (v/v) at 
119 
column flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, gradually increased to 99% B. 24,25[OH]2D3/D2 and 25[OH]D3/D2 
120 
peaks were eluted at 1.39, 1.42, 1.68 and 1.73 minutes respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). 
121 
Optimisation of MS/MS conditions were carried out by direct infusion of derivisated standards into 
122 
the ion source via a T-connector. The precursor to product ion transitions were based on the molecular 
123 
weight of the methylamine adduct of PTAD derived products (Supplementary Table 1). 
124 
 
125 
Measurements of total 1,25[OH]2D were carried out using a commercially available enzyme 
126 
immunoassay kit (IDS, Boldon, UK). Duplicate samples underwent immunoextraction with a 
127 
1,25[OH]2D specific solid phase monoclonal antibody and incubated overnight with sheep anti-
128 
1,25[OH]2D. 1,25[OH]2D linked biotin was added the next day, followed by horseradish peroxidase 
129 
labelled avidin to selectively bind to biotin complex. After a wash step, colour was developed using a 
130 
chromogenic substrate (TMB). The absorbance of the stopped reaction mixtures were read in a 
131 
microtiter plate spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go, Thermo Scientific, Finland) at wavelength of 450 
132 
nm. 
133 
 
134 
Intact parathyroid hormone in K2EDTA plasma samples were determined by 
135 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) performed using Roche e601 analyser (Mannheim, 
136 
Germany). Two labelled monoclonal antibodies were employed to react with the N-terminal fragment 
137 
(1-37) and C-terminal fragment (38-84) of PTH; forming a sandwich complex. The antibody complex 
138 
  
 
 
8 
was magnetically captured and washed to remove unbound substances. A voltage was applied to 
139 
induce chemiluminiescent emission which was measured by a photomultiplier. 
140 
 
141 
Assay validation 
142 
Summary of assay characteristics are described in Supplementary Table 2. Linearity of the methods 
143 
were evaluated by analysing stock standards made up from reference calibration solutions spiked into 
144 
human sera. Standard curve was constructed by plotting the analyte response against the concentration 
145 
of their respective standards. A calibration curves were accepted as linear if the weighted linear 
146 
regression produced a correlation coefficient (r2) value of >0.999. Intra and inter-assay imprecision of 
147 
the methods were assessed by running quality control (QC) materials 10 times within a single run and 
148 
separately over a three-month period. Assays were deemed acceptable when the QC results fall within 
149 
±2SD from the mean value. Lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) was determined by the lowest 
150 
concentration quantifiable with a precision CV of 20% over 12 replicates and minimum peak signal-
151 
to-noise ratio of 10:1 (17). Assay recovery was determined by analysing samples containing a fixed 
152 
amount of the analyte and calculate the percentage of the measured value against the sum of 
153 
endogenous value plus spiking concentration. 
154 
  
155 
Statistical Analyses 
156 
Comparisons of basal total serum 25[OH]D concentration for the two dose groups were made using an 
157 
independent t-test. The effects of vitamin D dose and time on all repeated measures variables was 
158 
determined using linear mixed modeling. Time (basal, weeks 6, 12 and 18) and dose (moderate and 
159 
high) were modeled as fixed effects and participants as a random effect, with time being modeled as a 
160 
continuous variable where linear or quadratic responses were observed. The covariance structure that 
161 
minimized the Hurvich and Tsai’s criterion (AICC) value was used for the final fitted model for each 
162 
metabolite. Where significant main or interaction effects were observed, post hoc pairwise 
163 
comparisons were made with Sidak adjusted p-values. All statistical procedures were conducted using 
164 
SPSS v22 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), and two-tailed statistical significance was 
165 
accepted at the p < 0.05 level. Descriptive statistics are displayed as means ± standard deviation (SD). 
166 
  
 
 
9 
For the calculation of sample size, Minitab software was used. Pilot work from our laboratories during 
167 
the winter months suggested that the standard deviation for test–retest serum 25[OH]D concentrations 
168 
(taken 6 weeks apart) in young athletes is ∼12 nmol.L-1. To enable the detection of a meaningful 50 
169 
nmol.L-1 increase in total serum 25[OH]D concentration  between pre-supplementation and post-
170 
supplementation with 80% power; n = 6 participants per group was required. Thus, the recruitment of 
171 
an entire squad of 42 players provided a large enough sample size to make valid conclusions from the 
172 
derived data. 
173 
 
174 
Results 
175 
Of the 42 participants that were enrolled onto the trial, 40 were tested for all primary outcome 
176 
measures. This was due to player commitment to international duty. However, no participants 
177 
presented with adverse side effects to supplementation during the trial and thus no participant was 
178 
withdrawn. Basal (pre-treatment) total serum 25[OH]D concentrations were 86 ± 20 and 85 ± 10 
179 
nmol.L-1 for high and moderate treatment groups, respectively (Figure 1). These concentrations were 
180 
not significantly different between groups (t = 0.20, P = 0.84). . 
181 
<Figure 1> 
182 
Total serum 25[OH]D, displayed a significant interaction effect (F = 4.30, P = 0.008) between dose 
183 
and time. Exploration of this interaction identified that both groups showed significantly elevated 
184 
25[OH]D concentrations at weeks 6 (moderate = 108 ± 22 and high = 122 ± 25 nmol.L-1) and 12 
185 
(moderate = 163 ± 47 and high = 188 ± 66 nmol.L-1). However, upon supplementation withdrawal the 
186 
moderate treatment group demonstrated a return to 25[OH]D concentrations comparable with basal by 
187 
week 18 (P = 0.178) whereas the high treatment did not (P = 0.007; Figure 2A).  
188 
Concentrations of the bioactive metabolite, 1α,25[OH]2D3 demonstrated a significant main effect for 
189 
time (F = 6.13, P = 0.001). In the moderate treatment group, peak concentrations occurred at week 6 
190 
(141 ± 58 pmol.L-1). However, a delayed response was observed in the high group with peak 
191 
1α,25[OH]2D3  levels occurring at week 12 (112 ± 66 pmol.L-1, Figure 2B). Following 
192 
supplementation withdrawal, the concentration of 1α,25[OH]2D3  declined significantly in both groups 
193 
at week 18 (moderate, 107 ± 32 and high = 104 ± 42 pmol.L-1, P =  0.042) compared with 
194 
  
 
 
10 
concentrations at week 12 and were comparable with basal by this time point (P = 0.332).  
195 
 
196 
The inactivated metabolite, 24,25[OH]D, showed comparable values between groups at basal 
197 
(moderate = 8.3 ± 2.5 and high = 7.1 ± 1.7  nmol.L-1). Both groups showed significant increases in this 
198 
metabolite by week 6 (moderate, P = 0.011 and high, P = 0.000) that continued to increase between 
199 
weeks 6 and 12. A significant interaction effect was also detected as the high treatment group 
200 
displayed markedly higher peak 24,25[OH]D concentrations (17.3 ± 4.5 nmol.L-1) versus moderate 
201 
treatment (11.8 ± 1.9 nmol.L-1).  Interestingly, whereas 1α,25[OH]2D3  declined following 
202 
supplementation withdrawal, 24,25[OH]D remained significantly elevated at week 18 when compared 
203 
with basal values in both treatment groups (moderate, 11.4 ± 2.2 and high, 15.7 ± 4.6 nmol.L-1; P = 
204 
0.000 for both groups). 
205 
  
206 
Intact parathyroid hormone was significantly suppressed in both groups by week 6 (moderate = 2.3 ± 
207 
0.8 and high = 1.9 ± 0.4 pmol.L-1 vs basal values in moderate = 3.2 ± 2.3 and high 2.8 ± 1 pmol.L-1) 
208 
and remained suppressed throughout the trial and following the withdrawal of supplementation 
209 
(moderate = 2.1 ± 0.8 and high 2 ± 0.6 pmol.L-1).  
210 
<Figure 2> 
211 
Several studies have also examined the ratios of 25[OH]D and 1α,25[OH]2D3 to 24,25[OH]D and it is 
212 
evident that additional information can be obtained that is not always obvious when measuring 
213 
absolute concentrations (18, 20, 23). In addition, it has been suggested that the ratio of 25[OH]D to 
214 
24,25[OH]D is predictive of the 25[OH]D response to supplementation (35) giving important 
215 
information that surpasses simply measuring the absolute values for these metabolites. Therefore we 
216 
also calculated ratio data for the relationships between 25[OH]D and 1α,25[OH]2D3 to 24,25[OH]D. 
217 
The ratio between 25[OH]D and 1α,25[OH]2D3  showed a significant main effect for time (F = 3.39, P 
218 
= 0.023) but no group main effect with ratio’s for both supplemental treatments decreasing over the 
219 
duration of the study, reaching significance by week 12 (P = 0.039) and increasing toward pre 
220 
treatment values at week 18 (Figure 3A). The ratio of 25[OH]D to the inactivated 24,25[OH]D also 
221 
showed a main effect for time (F = 14.94, P = 0.000) and the absence of a group main effect. Both 
222 
  
 
 
11 
groups demonstrated a significant lower ratio at week 18 compared to basal (P = 0.000; Figure 3B). 
223 
Finally, the ratio of the bioactive 1α,25[OH]2D3  against the inactivated 24,25[OH]D was assessed. A 
224 
significant interaction effect was observed as at week 6 the moderate treatment group showed an 
225 
increased ratio whilst the high treatment group showed an inverse relationship. However, by week 12 
226 
both treatment groups showed a significantly lower ratio of 1α,25[OH]2D3:24,25[OH]D (P = 0.005) 
227 
that was maintained at week 18 following supplementation withdrawal (P = 0.003; Figure 3C).

Discussion 
231 
The current investigation sought to define the serum responses of the major vitamin D metabolites in a 
232 
professional athletic cohort to establish the efficacy of a blanket supplementation approach using two 
233 
commonly employed and commercially available doses of vitamin D3.Our main findings demonstrate 
234 
that both 35,000 and 70,000 IU.week-1 oral vitamin D3 supplementation significantly elevated total 
235 
serum 25[OH]D concentrations. The highest dose led to an initial rapid increase in 1.25[OH]2D but 
236 
then a decrease in serum 1,25[OH]2D at week 12 when there was a significant increase of 
237 
24,25[OH]2D3 which had also been significantly increased at week 6. Resultantly, these responses led 
238 
to a significantly lower ratio of 1,25[OH]2 D to 24,25[OH]2D from week 6 with the higher, 70,000 IU 
239 
treatment. Following the withdrawal of supplementation, the concentrations of 25[OH]D and 
240 
1α,25[OH]2D return to basal values within 6 weeks. These data imply that high doses of supplemental 
241 
vitamin D3 are sufficient to markedly induce the expression of 24-hydroxylase leading to the negative 
242 
control of 1,25[OH]2D activity. Finally, we demonstrate that elevating serum 25[OH]D and 
243 
1α,25[OH]2D3 suppresses iPTH appearance in circulation. This finding is in agreement with previous 
244 
data published by our group (28) and is underpinned by the understanding that DNA binding 
245 
sequences exist in the PTH gene (7), permitting suppression of the gene when adequate ligand 
246 
(1,25[OH]2D) is available to induce transcriptional suppression by the VDR (31).  
247 
 
248 
The fact that the concentration of serum 24,25[OH]2D3 did not show a decline along with 1,25[OH]2D 
249 
following the withdrawal of supplementation has practical implications. The finding suggests that the 
250 
  
 
 
12 
activity of 24-hydroxylase is sustained following large increases in 1,25[OH]2D and may persist and 
251 
decrease both the concentration and subsequent biological activity of 1,25[OH]2D. Evidence is now 
252 
emerging that the 24,25[OH]2D metabolite may act at the VDR as a “blocking molecule” binding to 
253 
the VDR decreasing 1,25 [OH]2D activity (6). Since 24,25[OH]2D is present in the circulation in 
254 
nmol/L concentration compared to pmol/L for 1,25[OH]2D the significantly higher prevailing 
255 
24,25[OH]2D concentrations are liable to contribute to a significant decrease in the activity of the 
256 
biologically active 1,25[OH]2D. Thus a dual regulation would appear to be present in subjects 
257 
receiving high dose vitamin D supplementation preventing possible toxic effects, namely, 1) the 
258 
positive stimulation of 24-hydroxylase and 2) the negative control of the vitamin D receptor activity. 
259 
This notion is supported by previous mechanistic evidence that has determined the function of 
260 
1α,25[OH]2D in regulating 24-hydroxylase activity in vitro. Identification of two VDREs in the 5’ 
261 
region of the CYP24A1 promoter demonstrated that 1α,25[OH]2D3 could potently trans-activate the 
262 
CYP24A1 gene, inducing a 10 to 100 fold increase in CYP24A1 mRNA to limit the transcription of 
263 
1α,25[OH]2D3 responsive genes (25). Moreover, in vitro studies on primary human myoblasts indicate 
264 
that the induction of 24-hydroxylase is dose dependent (11), which is in agreement with the serum 
265 
response of 24,25[OH]D seen in vivo in the current study.  
266 
 
267 
These findings may explain reported observations of deterioration in skeletal muscle function, 
268 
increased risk of falls and increased fracture risk in individuals supplemented with extreme dose 
269 
vitamin D3 to correct for severe vitamin D deficiency. As an example, in a large-scale trial (n = 2256), 
270 
women ≥ 70 years old were randomized to either 500,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo. The women 
271 
randomized to the supplemental vitamin D3 experienced significantly more falls than the placebo 
272 
group in the year following dosing of which the falls ratio was greatest in the first month following the 
273 
one off 500,000 IU dose (30). Furthermore, in a retrospective observational cohort study, very low (< 
274 
10 nmol.L-1) and high (above 140 nmol.-1) concentrations of 25[OH]D showed an increased risk of all 
275 
cause mortality indicating not only a lower limit but also an upper limit for serum 25[OH]D (8). This 
276 
hypothesis also lends an explanation for the inconsistency in positive outcomes related to 
277 
supplemental vitamin D reported by large-scale meta-analyses (5). It is reasonable to suggest that 
278 
  
 
 
13 
mega dose vitamin D supplements are detrimental to vitamin D target tissues by increasing the 
279 
production of 24,25[OH]2D, which may act to block the activity of the VDR. It will be necessary to 
280 
now perform mechanistic studies that clarify the function of 24,25[OH]2D and to determine whether 
281 
high dose supplementation is detrimental to vitamin D signaling through the VDR. 
282 
 
283 
The current trial also had limitations that are important to consider for the design of future work. 
284 
Firstly, although one of our goals was to use a ‘real world’ blanket supplementation approach, we 
285 
acknowledge that the same protocol used in other athletic cohorts with different body composition, 
286 
genotype and lower basal serum 25[OH]D concentrations may yield different results. Determining the 
287 
response of the vitamin D metabolites to a similar protocol as we have used here across wider athletic 
288 
cohorts will allow more conclusive recommendations to be made on dosing concentration and 
289 
frequency. Indeed, we have previously shown that basal 25[OH]D concentrations vary across athletes 
290 
from different professional sports (3). This assumption is also true for female cohorts and as such we 
291 
appreciate that our findings cannot be conclusively extended to the female athletic population. 
292 
Regarding genotype, genotypic variation in the vitamin D binding protein influences the response to 
293 
exogenous vitamin D (10) and little is known of the variation in genes encoding other vitamin D 
294 
metabolizing enzymes such as CY24A1 and CYP24B1. We did not perform genotyping and in light of 
295 
recent evidence, we fully support genotype-phenotype studies in the context of vitamin D in future. 
296 
Combining a genotyping approach with vitamin D metabolite ratio data, the latter as we have 
297 
performed in this study, will offer a great advancement in the understanding of how genotype and 
298 
supplementation interact and how this can be managed. We also did not measure serum or urinary 
299 
calcium concentrations, which are markers of vitamin D toxicity and also regulate the PTH response. 
300 
Measuring Ca2+ excretion would add another aspect to our findings, however we do maintain that the 
301 
observed increases in 24,25[OH]D are indicative of too much exposure to exogenous vitamin D. 
302 
Finally, future work should aim to monitor FGF-23, a bone derived hormone that can function to 
303 
lower both 25[OH]D and 1α,25[OH]2D3 by inducing the CYP24 genes (29). FGF-23 may also be a 
304 
player in regulating the metabolite response to high dose supplementation and at present its role in 
305 
lowering 25[OH]D by promoting 24-hydroxylase expression is still disputed (32). Extending the 
306 
  
 
 
14 
current findings to a broader range of vitamin D concentrations, coupled with intracellular signaling 
307 
cascades related to the vitamin D axis will yield the most inferential data, moving towards safer and 
308 
more effective vitamin D supplementation practices in athletes. 
309 
 
310 
Summary and implications for practice 
311 
The data presented here are the first to characterize the response of two major metabolites of vitamin 
312 
D in response to two high-dose supplementation protocols in healthy professional athletes. The results 
313 
demonstrate that a blanket approach of high-dose supplementation with 70,000 IU.week-1 leads not 
314 
only to increased 25[OH]D3 and 1,25[OH]2D3 concentrations but also stimulates elevated 
315 
concentrations of the vitamin D metabolite 24,25[OH]2D3, which has been previously shown to limit 
316 
the transcriptional activity of 1,25[OH]2D3. We demonstrated that this negative regulatory effect 
317 
persists following cessation of vitamin D3 supplementation even as 1,25[OH]2D3 concentrations 
318 
decrease. There are a number of novel key implications for practice that arise from our current 
319 
observations. Firstly, we speculate that ‘high dose’ bolus supplementation with vitamin D3 is likely to 
320 
be detrimental to the intended targeted downstream biological functions due to significant increases in 
321 
the negative regulatory molecule, 24,25[OH]2D. Weekly doses amounting to more than 5,000 IU.day-1 
322 
may need to be reassessed in light of our data. Rapid withdrawal from high dose supplementation may 
323 
result in adverse outcomes as the concentration of 24,25[OH]2D3 remains elevated for several weeks 
324 
following withdrawal from supplementation despite declines in 1,25[OH]2D3. If moderate to high 
325 
doses of vitamin D3 have been administered, a gradual withdrawal from supplementation is advisable. 
326 
At present the optimal approach has not been established. Lower doses administered often (daily) may 
327 
offer the most potent beneficial biological effects and limit the transactivation of CYP24A1 and 
328 
subsequent production of the negative regulatory molecule, 24,25[OH]2D3. Future research must aim 
329 
to establish the appropriate dose and frequency of administration to achieve a positive increase in both 
330 
25[OH]D3 and 1,25[OH]2D3 whilst limiting the appearance of increased 24,25[OH]2D3 concentrations. 
331 
The generation of 24,25 [OH]2D may be an aspect of the body’s defense mechanism to prevent 
332 
“toxicity” when administered high doses of vitamin D. We postulate that single “super” doses of 
333 
vitamin D3 administered on a weekly basis as is common practice in many professional sporting 
334 
  
 
 
15 
teams, may result in similar rapid transient increases in 1,25[OH]2D3 leading to significant increases in 
335 
the negative regulatory metabolite, 24,25[OH]2D3. Further studies will be required to determine if the 
336 
relationship we have observed is seen with higher and lower doses of vitamin D.
