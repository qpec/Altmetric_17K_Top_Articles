SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted sexually between humans. However, it is unknown whether 
ZIKV replicates in the vagina and impacts the unborn fetus. Here, we establish a mouse model of 
vaginal ZIKV infection and demonstrate that, unlike other routes, ZIKV replicates within the 
genital mucosa even in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice lacking RNA sensors or transcription factors 
IRF3 and IRF7 resulted in higher levels of local viral replication. Furthermore, mice lacking the 
type I interferon (IFN) receptor became viremic and died of infection after a high-dose vaginal 
ZIKV challenge. Notably, vaginal infection of pregnant dams during early pregnancy led to fetal 
growth restriction and infection of the fetal brain in WT mice. This was exacerbated in mice 
deficient in IFN pathways, leading to abortion. Our study highlights the vaginal tract as a highly 
susceptible site of ZIKV replication and illustrates the dire disease consequences during 
pregnancy.

 INTRODUCTION
While Zika virus (ZIKV) is well known for its transmission through the Aedes mosquitoes, 
recent evidence highlights another important route of transmission: through sexual contact 
with an infected partner. There have been multiple confirmed and suspected cases of sexual 
transmission in humans. Most of these reports involve transmission from infected men to 
their female partners (Foy et al., 2011; Hills et al., 2016; Lazear and Diamond, 2016; 
Mansuy et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2016; Rowland et al., 2016; Venturi et al., 2016), but 
sexual transmission has also been reported from an infected man to a male partner (Deckard 
et al., 2016), and most recently from an infected woman to a male partner (Davidson et al., 
2016). In addition, ZIKV has been detected in semen of infected men for as long as 62 days 
after initial symptoms (Mansuy et al., 2016; Musso et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2016). ZIKV 
has also been detected in the cervical mucus and genital swab of a woman (Prisant et al., 
2016), supporting the possibility of female to male sexual transmission. Collectively, these 
studies indicate that in humans, sexual transmission of ZIKV is possible from male to 
female, male to male, and female to male.
Pregnant women are at a higher risk for more severe complications following a wide range 
of viral infections. These viruses include influenza virus, hepatitis viruses, herpes viruses, 
rubella virus, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Ebola virus and Lassa fever virus 
(Silasi et al., 2015). In addition, infants born to mothers infected with HIV-1, herpes simplex 
virus type 2, influenza virus, and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy have an 
increased risk for adverse outcomes. Infections of pregnant mothers with viruses such as 
rubella, CMV, and others have been shown to result in microcephaly of the fetus/ infant. 
Multiple cases of babies born with microcephaly to ZIKV-infected mothers have reported 
the presence of ZIKV in the fetal brains (Driggers et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar 
Yockey et al.

 et al., 2016). However, the disease consequences on the fetus after sexual exposure of 
pregnant mothers to ZIKV are unknown.
The innate immune system detects viral infections through the recognition of molecular 
patterns that are specifically present or generated during infection. The best-characterized 
viral sensors are the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect invariant molecular 
patterns found in most microorganisms of a given class, known as pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Janeway, 1989; Medzhitov, 2001). Distinct classes of viruses 
are recognized by distinct sets of PRRs (Takeuchi and Akira, 2007). Engagement of PRRs 
by viral PAMPs result in the transcriptional activation of cytokines downstream of the 
transcription factor NF-kB, and the type I interferon (IFN) genes downstream of IRF3 and 
IRF7 (Honda et al., 2006). Type I IFNs bind to their receptor IFNAR and induce hundreds of 
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that work in combination to block viral replication and induce 
adaptive immune responses to the virus (Schoggins and Rice, 2011). In addition, many ISGs 
can be induced by signaling downstream of PRRs through IRF3 and IRF7 (Honda and 
Taniguchi, 2006; Honda et al., 2005), independently of IFNAR signaling. The genome of 
flaviviruses (of which ZIKV is a member) is composed of positive-sense RNA. In 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a specialized sensor of viruses that secrete large 
amounts of type I IFNs, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal sensor of ssRNA, 
recognizes the genomic RNA of the incoming virions and mounts antiviral responses to 
flaviviruses (Bruni et al., 2015; Décembre et al., 2014; Nazmi et al., 2014; Town et al., 2009; 
Wang et al., 2006; Welte et al., 2009). In contrast, the infected cells sense RNA virus 
infections by RIG-I (which recognizes 50triphosphorylated dsRNA) and/or MDA5 (which 
recognizes long dsRNA), which are collectively known as the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). 
A subset of flaviviruses is recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (dengue, West Nile virus), 
while others are preferentially recognized by RIG-I (Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C 
virus) (Foy et al., 2005; Loo et al., 2008; Saito et al., 2008). Of note, in mice deficient in 
mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS), the signaling adaptor of RLRs, 
subcutaneous infection with ZIKV is well tolerated (Lazear et al., 2016), suggesting the 
presence of redundant sensors that trigger protective innate immune responses in mice. In 
addition, while cGAS is a cytosolic DNA sensor, it is required for innate defense against 
West Nile virus (Schoggins et al., 2014). However, which innate immune pathways are 
required to control vaginal transmission of ZIKV within the female host or within the fetus 
is unknown.
Recent studies using the mouse model of ZIKV have revealed that type I interferon (IFN) 
receptor (IFNAR) is critical in host resistance against ZIKV (Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear et 
al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016) and that there is a persistent replication of the virus within the 
testes of IFNAR-deficient (Ifnar1−/−) male mice (Lazear et al., 2016). Subcutaneous ZIKV 
infection of Ifnar1−/− dams mated with WT sires resulted in intrauterine growth restriction 
(IUGR) (Miner et al., 2016). While some have reported changes in fetal brain development 
after intraperitoneal infection of pregnant C57BL/6 mice (Wu et al., 2016), others found no 
apparent impact on either fetal brain size or fetal weight in this strain of mice injected 
intravenously (Cugola et al., 2016). One of the reasons why wild-type mice are resistant to 
ZIKV infection may be explained by the fact that ZIKV evolved to target human, but not 
mouse, STAT2 for degradation (Grant et al., 2016). Therefore, previous reports have used

 Ifnar1−/− mice or antibody treatment to block IFNAR to study ZIKV infection in mice 
(Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). However, virtually nothing is 
known about the pathogenesis of sexual ZIKV transmission and the defense mechanisms 
that prevent sexual transmission of ZIKV in women.
To this end, we developed a vaginal ZIKV transmission model in mice. We investigate viral 
replication in female mice that have genetic deletions in various innate sensors, adaptors, 
transcription factors, and the type I interferon receptor. Further, we examine the viral 
replication and disease consequences following vaginal infection of pregnant mice with 
ZIKV and examine viral transmission from infected dams to fetuses and its impact on fetal 
development.
RESULTS
ZIKV Replicates in the Vaginal Tract of Wild-Type Mice
It is unknown whether mice are susceptible to sexual transmission of ZIKV and, if so, what 
mechanisms are required to protect the host. To address this issue we established a mouse 
model of vaginal ZIKV infection. In other vaginal viral infection models, the diestrus phase 
of the estrus cycle renders the host susceptible to infection (Parr et al., 1994). To 
synchronize the estrus cycle of the female mice to the diestrus phase, mice were first 
injected with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) 5 days prior to ZIKV vaginal 
challenge. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 virgin female mice were inoculated intravaginally 
(ivag) with 2.5 × 104 PFU of Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS13025. This strain is an Asian 
lineage of ZIKV isolated in 2010 from a pediatric case and is phylogenetically closely 
related to the ZIKV strains involved in the ongoing epidemic in the Americas (Grant et al., 
2016; Haddow et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). Viral load in the vaginal wash was measured 
daily. Remarkably, viral RNA persisted in the majority of mice from days 1–4 post-infection 
and declined to undetectable levels in most mice by 7 days post-infection (dpi; Figure 1A). 
All of the ZIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice survived and showed no signs of weight loss 
(Figure 1B). To ensure that the viral RNA reflected infectious virus, we conducted viral 
plaque assays of the vaginal washes. Infectious viral particles were detected in the vaginal 
wash (Figure S1A) and correlated well (Spearman correlation of 0.85, p < 0.0001) with the 
viral RNA measured by RT-qPCR (Figure S1B). Based on the strong correlation between the 
viral RNA levels and the plaque forming units (Figure S1B), we decided to use viral RNA as 
a proxy for infectious virus throughout this study.
Our results indicated prolonged presence of ZIKV RNA (Figures 1A, S1C) and infectious 
virus (Figure S1A) in the vaginal mucosa following genital infection with ZIKV. To ensure 
that the persistent viral RNA and infectious particles do not reflect residual input virus, we 
examined an earlier time point of infection. We detected ZIKV RNA as early as 6 hr post-
infection (Figure 1C). Importantly, the titers of ZIKV RNA were significantly elevated by 24 
hr post-infection (Figure 1C). These results suggest that while only a small fraction of the 
input ZIKV successfully entered the host cells (6 hr), the virus has replicated in the 
subsequent 18 hr in the vaginal tissue.

 Thus far, studies of ZIKV infection in adult WT mice have reported only low and transient 
viral RNA presence, but no infectious virus following subcutaneous injections in vivo 
(Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016). However, the vaginal route of ZIKV infection 
supports productive replication in WT mice. To directly compare the levels of viral 
replication after vaginal versus systemic infection, we infected Depo-Provera-treated virgin 
WT mice either intravaginally (by using a pipette) or intraperitoneally (by using a needle). 
On 1 and 3 dpi, we collected spleens and vaginas to measure ZIKV RNA. These results 
indicated that intraperitoneal injection of ZIKV into WT mice resulted in extremely low 
levels of viral RNA found in the spleen 1 dpi and undetectable levels by 3 dpi (Figure 1D), 
consistent with previous studies (Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016). In contrast, ivag 
inoculation of ZIKV resulted in much higher levels of viral RNA detected in the vaginal 
mucosa on 1 and 3 dpi (Figure 1E). No viral RNA was detected within the vagina following 
intraperitoneal injection (Figure 1E). Our results show that the female reproductive tract 
supports productive ZIKV replication even in WT mice and this route of transmission 
supports persistent and higher levels of viral replication compared to after intraperitoneal 
infection.
RNA Sensors, Signaling and Type I Interferons Control Vaginal ZIKV Replication
Next, we examined the ability of innate and adaptive immune responses to control ZIKV 
replication in the vagina. Recombination activating gene-2-deficient (Rag2−/−) mice, which 
lack T and B cells, harbored similar levels of ZIKV in the vagina as WT mice (Figures 1A, 
S1C), indicating that early viral replication in the vagina is not controlled by adaptive 
immune responses. We thus focused on innate mechanisms of ZIKV control. First, we 
examined the role of IFNAR in ZIKV control. Virgin female Ifnar1−/− mice challenged with 
ZIKV vaginally all harbored high levels of local ZIKV replication starting on 2 dpi, and 
ZIKV continued to replicate in the vaginal tissue of these mice through 7 dpi (Figures 1A, 
S1C). These results indicate that type I IFNs play a critical role in blocking ZIKV 
replication in the vaginal mucosa. Given the importance of type I IFNs, we next examined 
the role of a well-known ISG, myxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1) in control of ZIKV in 
the vaginal mucosa. C57BL/6 mice carry nonfunctional alleles of the Mx1 gene, a dynamin-
like GTPase that blocks a wide range of RNA viruses (Haller et al., 2015). Yet, Mx1 
congenic mice on C56BL/6 background were no more capable of controlling ZIKV than the 
Mx1-deficient C57BL/6 mice (Figures 1A, S1C), indicating that Mx1 is not a relevant ISG 
that restricts ZIKV.
Next, we examined the role of RNA sensors that are known to trigger IFN induction in 
ZIKV control. We used mice deficient in Tlr7, Mavs, or both. Mx1 congenic mice with 
single deletion in Tlr7 harbored vaginal ZIKV titers comparable to the WT counterpart, 
whereas all Mavs-deficient mice had elevated viral titers at all time points compared to WT 
Mx1 mice (Figure S1D). In contrast, mice deficient in both Tlr7 and Mavs supported more 
than an order of magnitude higher titers of ZIKV in the vaginal mucosa than the WT mice 
(Figure 1A and Figure S1D), indicating redundancy between TLR7 and RLRs in ZIKV 
control. In contrast, mice deficient in cGAS had vaginal ZIKV titers comparable to WT mice 
(Figure S1C), indicating that this sensor is dispensable for ZIKV control in this tissue. TLR7 
and RLRs utilize IRF3 and IRF7 for signaling for type I IFN synthesis (Honda and 
Yockey et al.

 Taniguchi, 2006; Honda et al., 2005). Consistently, mice deficient in both IRF3 and IRF7 
harbored high titers of local ZIKV replication starting on 2 dpi, reaching peak titers on 4–5 
dpi, and continue to persist until 7 dpi (Figures 1A, S1C). All mice, except for one of seven 
Ifnar1−/− mice, survived after vaginal infection with 2.5 × 104 PFU of ZIKV with no signs of 
weight loss (Figure 1B). Of note, Ifnar1−/− mice had the highest levels of viremia 2 dpi 
(Figure 1F). Levels of viremia increased by 5 dpi in Ifnar1−/− mice and in Irf3−/− Irf7−/− 
mice (Figure 1G). These results indicated that IFNAR signaling is essential in preventing 
systemic ZIKV spread following vaginal replication.
High-Dose Vaginal ZIKV Challenges Is Lethal in IFNAR-Deficient Mice
Even at a higher dose (5.2 × 105 PFU) of vaginal ZIKV challenge, infected WT mice did not 
lose weight (Figure 2A) and all survived (Figure 2B). However, when Ifnar1−/− mice were 
challenged with a higher dose (5.2 × 105 PFU) of ZIKV, all mice began to lose weight by 6 
dpi and died by 9 dpi (Figures 2A and 2B). Similar to reports of subcutaneous or intravenous 
infection (Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016), all Ifnar1−/− mice 
developed hind limb paralysis. At the time of euthanasia, Ifnar1−/− mice had ZIKV RNA in 
the vagina, uterus, and ovaries as well as systemically in the spleen and brain (Figure 2C). In 
the absence of IFNAR, vaginal infection of ZIKV led to central nervous system (CNS) 
infection and death, demonstrating that vaginal infection by ZIKV spread systemically if the 
host innate immune response is compromised, leading to lethal disease.
Vaginal Infection of Dams Early During Pregnancy Results in Reduced Fetal Weight
Based on our finding that ZIKV replicates well in the vaginal mucosa of virgin mice 
(Figures 1 and S1), we hypothesized that ZIKV infection of pregnant mothers might have 
negative consequences on fetal development. To test this hypothesis, we infected pregnant 
WT dams at two early phases of pregnancy; at embryonic days 4.5 (E4.5) or E8.5. In mice, 
E4.5 corresponds to the initiation of embryonic development at the late blastocyst stage, 
whereas E8.5 corresponds to late gastrulation and the beginning of organogenesis (Ko, 
2001). ZIKV replicated substantially in the vaginal tract after vaginal exposure of WT 
pregnant dams at E4.5 and at E8.5 (Figure 3A). These data indicated that even in the absence 
of Depo-Provera injection, WT mice are susceptible to vaginal viral replication during 
pregnancy.
Next, we examined the ZIKV infection of the maternal and fetal tissues. In WT mice we did 
not detect any ZIKV RNA in the peripheral blood on 2 or 5 dpi (Figures 3B and 3C). Further 
at E18.5 (just prior to birth), we detected no virus in the placenta or fetal bodies in neither 
the E4.5 nor E8.5 infection time points (Figure 3D). However, these data do not rule out the 
possibility that ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetus occurred earlier, between days 1–10 
(E8.5) or days 1–14 (E4.5) of viral challenge. Despite our inability to detect ZIKV RNA by 
qPCR in the maternal blood, fetal body, or placenta, when pregnant WT dams were infected 
on E4.5, the developing embryo at E18.5 had mild but significant overall growth defect 
(Figure 4A). In contrast, when WT dams were infected on E8.5, the weight of the fetuses 
was comparable to those of uninfected controls when analyzed at E18.5 (Figure 4A). These 
data indicated that ZIKV replicates in the vagina of WT pregnant dams and has a negative 
impact on fetal growth when the viral exposure occurs during early pregnancy.

 Deficiencies in the Interferon Pathways Exacerbate Fetal Growth Restriction following 
Vaginal ZIKV Infection of Dams
Having established IUGR in WT mice following vaginal ZIKV exposure during early phases 
of pregnancy, we next investigated the role of PRR and IFNAR signaling in controlling 
ZIKV replication in the mother and fetus. To this end, Irf3−/− Irf7−/− dams mated with 
Irf3−/− Irf7−/− sires or Ifnar1−/− dams mated with WT sires (Miner et al., 2016), were 
challenged intravaginally with ZIKV on E4.5 or E8.5. Consistent with what was seen in 
virgin females, in Ifnar1−/− dams, ZIKV replicated in the vagina was increased compared to 
WT mice, and we detected significant levels of ZIKV in maternal blood at 2 dpi, which was 
elevated on 5 dpi (Figures 3A–3C). In Irf3−/− Irf7−/− dams, consistent with what was seen 
with virgin females, replication in the vagina was even higher than for Ifnar1−/− mice 
(Figure 3A). Infection at E8.5 but not E4.5 resulted in detectable viremia on 2 dpi, and 
viremia was elevated in both conditions by 5 dpi (Figures 3B and 3C). We detected high 
levels of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and fetal bodies of Irf3−/− Irf7−/− mice infected at E8.5 
(10 dpi) (Figure 3D). In addition, ZIKV RNA was detected in some of the placentas and the 
bodies of Irf3−/− Irf7−/− fetuses infected on E4.5 (14 dpi) (Figure 3D). There were also high 
levels of ZIKV RNA detected in the placenta and body of the fetuses of Ifnar1−/− dams 
infected on E8.5 (10 dpi) and of the resorbed fetuses of Ifnar1−/− dams infected at E4.5 (14 
dpi) (Figure 3D). Interestingly, ZIKV RNA levels were several orders of magnitude higher 
in the placentas of Irf3−/− Irf7−/− dams compared to those of the Ifnar1−/− dams (Figure 3D). 
These results indicate that vaginal exposure of ZIKV results in higher levels of viral 
replication in the vaginal mucosa in the absence of IRF3/IRF7 or IFNAR in pregnant mice. 
Subsequently, the virus enters the blood stream and infects the placenta and fetal bodies.
While no impact on fetal weight was observed after infection of Irf3−/− Irf7−/− dams on E8.5 
(Figure 4B), fetal weight was significantly reduced in Irf3−/− Irf7−/− dams infected on E4.5, 
albeit variable (Figure 4B). In Ifnar1−/− dams mated to WT sires, ivag infection on E4.5 led 
to resorption of all fetuses, which are all Ifnar1+/−, by 8 dpi (Figure 4C). After infection on 
E8.5, fetuses from Ifnar1−/− × WT parents survived until E18.5, but they showed 
significantly reduced fetal weight at E18.5 compared to the uninfected controls (Figure 4C). 
Therefore, IFNAR expression and autonomous fetal immune defense are insufficient to 
protect against ZIKV infection, akin to the results found after subcutaneous ZIKV challenge 
(Miner et al., 2016).
Vaginal Infection Results in Fetal Brain Infection in WT Mice
While we observed significant IUGR in fetuses of pregnant dams infected on E4.5, we did 
not detect ZIKV RNA in the fetal body (Figure 3D) or fetal brain (data not shown) at E18.5 
in infected WT mice. Although we were unable to detect ZIKV RNA in the brain at E18.5, 
previous studies suggest that fetal brain infection of WT mice occurs only in specific cell 
subsets and regions of the brain (Wu et al., 2016), likely limiting the sensitivity of RT-qPCR 
(Miner et al., 2016). Therefore, we decided to further examine the presence of ZIKV in fetal 
brains by immuno-electron microscopy (EM) using an antibody specific to flavivirus NS1.
Strikingly, a number of ZIKV-infected cells were detected in the E18.5 cortex (Figures 5A 
and 5D) and cerebellum (Figures 5B, 5C, 5E, and 5F) of brains isolated from WT fetuses

 whose mothers were vaginally infected on E4.5 or on E8.5. Virions were readily detected in 
these cells (see arrows). Further, the immuno-EM images show clear immunoreactivity for 
NS1, which was expressed abundantly in the ER of the infected cells found in the 
cerebellum and the cortex (Figures 5C and 5E, see arrowheads). The NS1 labeling is 
consistent with the fact that NS1 of flaviviruses is inserted into the lumen of the ER 
(Chambers et al., 1990). None of the uninfected mice contained virions or NS1 labeling in 
any regions of the brain tested (data not shown). Both neurons (Figures 5A-5D) and glial 
cells (Figure 5E) were infected with ZIKV. Further, we found evidence of virus within the 
endothelial cells, as well as NS1 staining on the luminal side of the endothelial cells (Figure 
5F). These results suggest production of ZIKV in nearby tissues, as it is known that 
flavivirus NS1 is also abundantly secreted by infected cells in a multimeric form (Crooks et 
al., 1994; Flamand et al., 1999). Therefore, these results demonstrate that despite grossly 
normal fetal size (Figure 4), vaginal infection of WT mothers with ZIKV results in viral 
invasion of the fetal brain tissue and causes significant levels of infection in the fetus of WT 
mice.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that vaginal ZIKV infection of female mice leads to productive 
replication of the virus within the vaginal mucosa even in WT animals. This was observed in 
both virgin female mice that were pretreated with Depo-Provera and in pregnant dams. 
Direct comparison of ZIKV RNA in the spleen after intraperitoneal injection and in the 
vagina after intra-vaginal inoculation revealed that the vaginal mucosa supports robust viral 
replication compared to other organs. In pregnant WT mice, ZIKV replication in the vaginal 
tissue was followed by the infection of fetal brain and IUGR, despite the absence of viremia. 
These results highlight the vaginal tract as a susceptible site for ZIKV replication, even in 
immunocompetent hosts. The consequences of vaginally-acquired ZIKV infection on the 
fetus appear to vary depending on the gestation stage at which the virus was introduced. 
Vaginal ZIKV exposure at early pregnancy (E4.5) resulted in IUGR of the fetus, while 
exposure at E8.5 resulted in normal fetal weight. Nevertheless, ZIKV-infected cells were 
found within the cerebellum and the cortex of the fetal brain after infection at both time 
points. Therefore, the female genital tract represents a productive site of viral replication. 
Our studies also indicate that ZIKV brain infection can occur in fetuses without causing 
gross growth defects or malformations. It will be important to further investigate how fetal 
brain infection with ZIKV impacts the postnatal brain development and the cognitive 
functions of the offspring.
By using the vaginal ZIKV infection model, we also interrogated the components of the 
protective immune responses. Deficiencies in Tlr7 led to no increase in viral titers over WT 
counterpart, while deletion of the Mavs gene resulted in slightly elevated ZIKV titers, 
indicating a more essential role of RLR signaling in ZIKV control. However, deficiencies in 
both Tlr7 and Mavs resulted in more than an order of magnitude higher titers of ZIKV in the 
vaginal mucosa, placing TLR7 and RLRs as redundant key upstream sensors that control 
ZIKV replication. While cGAS is important in controlling West Nile virus infection 
(Schoggins et al., 2014), we found no differences in ZIKV replication following vaginal 
exposure. In addition, our studies showed that transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 are

 required to block local ZIKV replication. Further, IFNAR is critical for preventing both local 
viral replication and systemic spread of the virus. In contrast, adaptive immunity plays a 
minimal role in controlling vaginal ZIKV infection during the early phase of infection.
PRR signaling stimulates the activation of IRF3 and IRF7, which bind to their respective 
IRF binding element (IRFE) to turn on both type I IFN genes as well as ISGs. Once 
secreted, type I IFNs bind to the cell-surface receptor, IFNAR, inducing activation of 
receptor-associated Jak kinases, followed by recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT1 and 
STAT2. STAT1, STAT2, and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) form a trimeric transcription 
factor complex, known as IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which binds to IFN-
stimulated response elements (ISREs) in ISG promoters. Due to the high degree of 
homology between the ISRE and IRFE consensus sequences, the transcription of many ISGs 
can be directly induced by either ISGF3, IRF3 or IRF7 (Schmid et al., 2010). Comparing our 
results from Irf3−/− Irf7−/− mice (which lack IRFE-inducible ISGs downstream of PRR 
signaling) and Ifnar1−/− mice (which lack ISRE-inducible ISGs) inform us that PRR-signal-
induced ISGs are more critical in controlling ZIKV replication in the vagina and placenta, 
while IFNAR-induced ISGs are more important in blocking systemic spread of the virus 
from the vagina to the blood stream. Our data suggest that there must be some levels of type 
I IFN secreted to limit systemic viral spread in the infected Irf3−/− Irf7−/− mice. This is 
consistent with previous studies showing that mice lacking IRF3 and IRF7 have an intact 
IFN-β responses to West Nile virus (Daffis et al., 2009; Lazear et al., 2013). Further, our 
data suggest the presence of additional PRRs in conferring resistance, as Tlr7−/− Mavs−/− 
mice harbored less ZIKV in the vaginal mucosa compared to the Irf3−/− Irf7−/− mice (Figure 
1A). Conversely, given the higher levels of viral burden in the Irf3−/− Irf7−/− mice compared 
to the Ifnar1−/− mice, we conclude that type I IFN-independent, PRR-dependent ISGs in the 
vagina and placenta are able to further block local viral replication. We ruled out Mx1 as 
such an ISG. Furthermore, our studies illustrate that different components of the innate 
immune response are responsible for controlling the degree of local viral replication in the 
exposed tissue and systemic spread of viruses and provide a model to further dissect these 
components. Future studies are needed to dissect the exact cell types and genes involved in 
controlling sexually transmitted ZIKV in the female reproductive tract.
Vaginal exposure of ZIKV in pregnant mice resulted in IUGR and fetal brain infection in the 
absence of viremia in WT mice. These data suggest a possible direct transmission route from 
the vaginal tract through the cervix to the intrauterine space. From there, the virus may enter 
the decidua and infect the placenta, thereby entering the fetus through the umbilical cord. 
Alternatively, the virus may spread from the decidua to invade the chorion and amnion and 
enter the amniotic cavity to directly infect the fetus. Because of the absence of viremia in 
infected WT dams, we hypothesize that the vaginal transmission of ZIKV might give the 
virus a direct access to the placenta or the fetus via an ascending route. Our studies also 
highlight that, even though WT mice are able to control ZIKV well compared to mice 
lacking IFNAR signaling, the virus still has a high predilection for the developing fetal 
brain. Consistent with a previous study (Wu et al., 2016), our study shows that infection of 
the fetal brain of WT C57BL/6 does occur when pregnant dams are infected with ZIKV.

 Vaginal ZIKV exposure of dams deficient in IRF3 and IRF7 resulted in very high levels of 
viral replication in the vaginal tissue. In contrast to WT mice, some of these Irf3−/− Irf7−/− 
mice also supported ZIKV replication in the placenta and fetal bodies. Further, IFNAR-
deficient dams infected with ZIKV early during pregnancy led to fetal loss and later during 
pregnancy led to severe IUGR. Because both of these genotypes support viremia, ZIKV may 
infect the placenta through blood-placental transmission and bypass the placental barrier to 
infect the fetus. These results are consistent with the hematogenous transplacental route of 
infection described by Miner et al. (Miner et al., 2016), who showed viremia and IUGR 
following subcutaneous infection of Ifnar1−/− dams at E6.5 or E7.5.
How might our findings apply to humans? A recent study demonstrated that ZIKV NS5 
protein antagonizes human STAT2 but not mouse STAT2 (Grant et al., 2016). Therefore, 
humans are naturally more susceptible to ZIKV infection than mice because infected cells 
can no longer respond to IFNs. Consequently, we speculate that ZIKV introduced into the 
human vagina is likely to replicate more robustly than in the vaginal cavity of WT mice. Our 
findings that ZIKV replicates in the vagina of mice is consistent with the report of sexual 
transmission from an infected female to her uninfected male partner. Currently, we do not 
know if sexual transmission of ZIKV poses a different risk of birth defects than 
mosquitoborne transmission in pregnant women. However, our results from the mouse 
model would predict negative consequences on fetal development following vaginal ZIKV 
exposure of the mothers during early pregnancy. Finally, while mosquitoborne transmission 
is blamed for the increased incidence of microcephaly, it is possible that sexual transmission 
of ZIKV might account for some of the fetal diseases even within the Aedes ZIKV endemic 
regions. Given the fact that human placental trophoblasts provide protective type III IFNs 
(Bayer et al., 2016), ascending infection from the vagina to the fetus in humans may provide 
the ZIKV direct access. Our findings in mice indicate that sexual transmission of ZIKV is 
harmful to the fetus and provide a model to study the impact of interventional and 
therapeutic treatment of vaginal ZIKV viral infection during pregnancy.

pPCR. ZIKV RNA was normalized to Hprt. Resorbed fetuses from Ifnar1−/− dams infected 
E4.5 were harvested on E12.5.
For (A–C) results shown are the mean ± SEM involving uninfected (n = 4), WT E4.5 (n = 
6), WT E8.5 (n = 5), Irf3−/− Irf7−/− E4.5 (n = 3), Irf3−/−Irf7−/− E8.5 (n = 3), Ifnar1−/− E4.5 (n 
= 3), and Ifnar1−/− E8.5 (n = 3) pregnant dams. For (D), 2–4 pregnant dams per group were 
infected, and n = 3–8 placentas or fetuses were analyzed. The gray dashed line represents 
limit of detection.

 Figure 4. Vaginal Infection of Pregnant Female Mice Leads to Fetal Growth Impairment and 
Fetal Resorption
(A–C) Mice of indicated genotypes were infected intravaginally on E4.5 or E8.5 with 1.5 × 
105 PFU of Cambodian ZIKV intravaginally. On E18.5, fetal weight was measured. 
Representative pictures of fetuses from each indicated genotype and day of infection are 
shown. All were harvested at E18.5 unless otherwise indicated. (**p = < 0.001, *p = < 0.05, 
scale bar, 1cm). For the Ifnar1−/− dams mated with WT sire infected on E4.5, the upper 
panel shows the dissected aborted fetus, and the lower panel shows the entire fetal sac. 
Upper panel bars indicate the mean ± SEM of the weights of 7–34 pups from 1–4 pregnant 
dams per genotype for uninfected mice and 16–48 pups from 2–6 pregnant dams per 
genotype per time point infected.

 Figure 5. Vaginal Infection of Pregnant Female WT Mice Leads to Fetal Brain Infection
(A–F) Immuno-EM depicting ZIKV infected cells (anti-flavivirus NS1 antibody) in the 
cortex and cerebellum of WT fetal brain from WT dams infected at E4.5 (A–C) and E8.5 
(D–F) sacrificed on E18.5. Arrows indicate the ZIKV virions within the infected cells. 
Arrowheads indicate immunolabeling of NS1. The cells depicted in are neurons (A–D), glial 
cell (E), and endothelial cells (F). These figures are representative of 2–4 brains examined 
for each group.
