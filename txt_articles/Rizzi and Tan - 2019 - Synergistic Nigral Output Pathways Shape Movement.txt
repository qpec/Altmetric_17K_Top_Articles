SUMMARY
Locomotion relies on the activity of basal ganglia net-
works, where, as the output, the substantia nigra pars
reticulata (SNr) integrates incoming signals and relays
them to downstream areas. The cellular and circuit
substrates of such a complex function remain un-
clear. We hypothesized that the SNr controls different
aspects of locomotion through coordinated cell-type-
specific sub-circuits. Using anatomical mapping,
single-cell qPCR, and electrophysiological tech-
niques, we identified two SNr sub-populations: the
centromedial-thalamo projectors (CMps) and the SN
compacta projectors (SNcps), which are genetically
targeted based on vesicular transporter for gamma-
aminobutyric
acid
(VGAT)
or
parvalbumin
(PV)
expression, respectively. Optogenetic manipulation
of these two sub-types across a series of motor tests
provided evidence that they govern different aspects
of motor behavior. While CMp activity supports the
continuity of motor patterns, SNcp modulates the
immediate motor drive behind them. Collectively,
our data suggest that at least two different sub-
circuits arise from the SNr, engage different behav-
ioral motor components, and collaborate to produce
correct locomotion.
INTRODUCTION
Locomotion stands at the core of every mammalian organism’s
survival within its environment. Efficient movement generation
is regulated by a complex network of subcortical brain nuclei,
the basal ganglia (BG) (Albin et al., 1989; Alexander et al., 1986;
DeLong, 1990). The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is one
of the output structures (Deniau et al., 1996); it acts as a control
station necessary for motor information processing and encod-
ing, relaying adequate signals to the appropriate downstream tar-
gets (Deniau et al., 2007). The cellular and circuit bases of how the
SNr orchestrates movement execution are, however, still unclear.
The SNr receives GABAergic inputs from the striatal direct
pathway medium-size spiny neurons (dMSNs) and excitatory in-
puts from the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN), which is disinhibited
by the striatal indirect pathway MSNs (iMSNs) via the globus pal-
lidus external segment (DeLong, 1990; Smith et al., 1998). Opto-
genetic activation of the dMSNs or iMSNs was shown to produce
diverse effects in the spontaneous firing rate of SNr cells, causing
both excitation and inhibition (Freeze et al., 2013; Tecuapetla
et al., 2014). Despite such heterogeneity, at the behavioral level,
photo-activation of the dMSNs triggers increased locomotion
whereas light stimulation of iMSNs leads to motor arrest (Kravitz
et al., 2010). SNr neurons have been shown to send projections to
numerous brain areas (Gerfen et al., 1982), including the superior
colliculus (Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983), the pedunculo-pontine
nucleus (Nakamura et al., 1989), the thalamus (Franc
¸ ois et al.,
2002), and, locally, to the compacta region (Lee and Tepper
2007). Collectively, this suggests that the SNr holds some degree
of heterogeneity with specific SNr neurons embedded in distinct
sub-circuits to produce correct movement. In this study, we
provide original evidence of functional specialization within the
SNr, identifying two sub-populations and revealing distinct
downstream functional innervation patterns as well as differential
contributions to locomotion.
RESULTS
Non-specific Optogenetic SNr Activation Strongly
Impairs Spontaneous Locomotion
The original rate model (Albin et al., 1989; DeLong, 1990) states
that selective activation of dMSNs promotes movement, whereas
the stimulation of the iMSNs prevents it (Kravitz et al., 2010).
Accordingly, it would be expected to observe corresponding
movementbiases whenmanipulatingthe downstream SNr region.
We sought to first verify the role of the SNr in a behavioral loss of
function design where an optogenetic approach would allow us
to disrupt locomotion. We tested the motor-preventive properties
of SNr activity by expressing a mutant variant of channel
rhodopsin 2 (ChR2(H134R); Berndt et al., 2011) conjugated to an
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein bilaterally in the SNr of
wild-type (WT) mice. This was achieved by stereotaxic injection
of adeno-associated viral constructs AAV5-hSyn-ChR2(H134R)-
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) or AAV5-hSyn-GFP
and implantation of optic fibers (Sparta et al., 2011) above each
SNr to achieve local soma photo-stimulation (Figures S1A and
S1B). Fourweekspost-surgery,miceweretestedforspontaneous
locomotion impairments induced by light stimulation of the SNr.
Bilateral SNr photo-activation induced a robust decrease in
spontaneous locomotion as shown by the example track plots
(Figures S1C and S1D). We observed significant reductions in all
locomotion-related parameters analyzed, namely the number of
locomotor bouts (Figure S1E), the bout speed (Figure S1F), length
(Figure S1G), duration (Figure S1H), and total distance traveled
(Figure S1I). As expected, the immobility time significantly
increased (Figure S1J). The performance of control mice was not
affected upon light stimulation of the SNr (Figures S1D–S1J).

 These data are in line with the classical view of the BG functionand
confirms the crucial role of the SNr in motor behavior.
Centromedial-Thalamo and Substantia Nigra Compacta
Projectors Exhibit Distinct Genetic and
Electrophysiological Profiles
We next investigated the cellular heterogeneity of the SNr by per-
forming fluorescent in situ hybridization in brain slices containing
the SNr and tested several well-described and recognized
markers of GABAergic neuronal cells. In this study, we focused
on the two most abundant markers: the vesicular transporter
for gamma-aminobutyric acid (VGAT) and the calcium-binding
protein parvalbumin (PV). Single-particle mRNA quantitative anal-
ysis revealed the presence of three populations with 38% of cells
expressing only VGAT, 19% of cells with only PV, and 43% of
neurons co-expressing both VGAT and PV mRNA (Figure 1A).
Before assessing the role of these SNr cell populations in
locomotion, we first performed a characterization study evalu-
ating their input-output connectivity, biochemical identity, and
electrophysiological signature. To examine the output targets,
an AAV5-phSyn1-Flex-tdTomato-T2A-SypEGFP construct was
injected into the SNr of VGAT-CRE (Vong et al., 2011) or
PV-CRE (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005) mice (Figure 1B). A major
innervation pattern was evident at the level of the centromedial
thalamic region (CM; Figure 1C). Fluorescence quantification of
both synaptophysin-EGFP and TdTomato confirmed a dense
projection arising from VGAT-expressing neurons to the CM
but not from PV-expressing cells (Figures 1D and 1E).
Using a retrograde approach, we confirmed the identity of CM
projectors (CMps) by injecting of red latex retrobeads in the CM of
WT mice and counterstained SNr-containing brain slices against
PV (Figure 1F). We observed that the large majority (80%) of CM
retrogradely labeled cells were PV negative (Figure 1G).
Previous literature has reported that GABAergic neurons of the
SNr represent a substantial inhibitory input to SNc dopamine
(DA) neurons (Grace and Bunney, 1979; Tepper et al., 1995;
Mailly et al., 2003) and that PV-positive cells have at least one
axon collateral ramifying into the SNc (Lee and Tepper, 2007).
We hypothesized that while CMp cells would have high levels
of VGAT, SNcp cells would present a stronger PV expression.
To test this hypothesis, we quantified the relative expression
of VGAT and PV in CMp versus SNcp SNr neurons (Figures
1H–1P). WT mice were injected either in the CM or in the SNc
with retrobeads (Figure S2) and 2 weeks later, the cytoplasm
of retrogradely labeled SNr neurons was extracted via in vitro
patch clamp recordings (Figure 1H) and genetically screened
using quantitative PCR (Figures 1H and 1I). CMp cells contained
either no detectable levels of PV (39%) or a lower amount of PV
compared to VGAT (61%) (Figures 1J, 1K, and 1L). Conversely,
SNcp cells had either undetectable levels of VGAT (19%) or a
lower VGAT expression (81%) (Figures 1J, 1M, and 1N). Fold
expression comparison of the two genes in CMp versus SNcp
neurons indicated a mirrored gene expression pattern and while
VGAT is enriched in CMp cells (Figure 1O), PV is downregulated
in CMp and upregulated in SNcp cells (Figure 1P).
We next evaluated the electrophysiological profile of the two
SNr pathways (Figure 2). In this case, red retrobeads were in-
jected into the CM of VGAT-GFP mice and green retrobeads in
the SNc of PV-TdTomato mice. Two weeks post-injection, whole
cell patch current clamp recordings of double-positive SNr cells
were performed (Figures 2A and 2B). Through the injection of
increasing amounts of current, input-output curves were deter-
mined and revealed that PV-SNcp can sustain much higher firing
rates than VGAT-CMp (Figures 2C and 2D). In line with this result,
PV-SNcp exhibited narrower action potentials (Figure 2E), a more
depolarized membrane resting potential (Figure 2F), similar input
resistance and capacitance (Figures 2G and 2H), a lower rheo-
base (Figure 2I), and saturation at higher current injection steps
(Figure 2J), hence being able to fire at much higher frequencies
(Figure 2K).

 Taken together, these experiments provide evidence of two
genetically and electrophysiologically distinct neuronal popula-
tions in the SNr that send robust projections to different down-
stream targets.
To confirm the functional connectivity of the VGAT-CM and
PV-SNc pathways, we performed in vitro whole-cell patch clamp
experiments in CM- and SNc-containing brain slices from VGAT-
or PV-CRE mice injected in the SNr with the CRE-dependent viral

currents in 87% of the recorded cells (Fig-
ures 3B and 3F). This light-evoked synaptic
transmission was GABAergic, fully abol-
ished by bath-application of picrotoxin
(PTX), and monosynaptic as confirmed
by
the
reappearance
of
the
light-
induced current after addition of 4AP,
when previously blocked by tetrodotoxin
(TTX) (Figures S3A and S3B) (Petreanu
et al., 2007). No inhibitory post-synaptic
currents (IPSCs) were observed in CM con-
taining slices from PV-CRE-infected mice
(Figures 3C and 3G). In the SNc, light
stimulation of VGAT::DIO-ChR2(H134R)-
EYFP-SNr-infected slices induced small
PTX-sensitive currents in only 37% (Fig-
ures 3D and 3F) of the putative DA re-
corded cells (as identified by the presence
of a hyperpolarizing current hyperpolarization-activated current
[IH]; Lacey et al., 1989). The synaptic connectivity onto SNc DA
cells was much stronger when PV::DIO-ChR2-H134R-EYFP-
SNr neurons were activated (73%) (Figures 3E and 3G). In this
case, the identity of a subset of successfully reconstructed cells
was confirmed by post hoc co-staining against biocytin added
to the patch pipet and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of
DA neurons (50% of the cells were successfully reconstructed
and all of the IH-positive cells were TH positive; Figure S3C). No
current was elicited in IH-TH-negative SNc neurons upon stimula-
tion of VGAT or PV terminals (Figures 3D–3G).

or PV mice, we only validated cells from animals in which we were
able toperform successful recordings inboththe CMand the SNc,
hence comparing IPSCs originating from the same viral infection
within the same animal. VGAT and PV SNr cells display opposing
connectivity patterns with specialized control over the CM and
SNc DA neurons, respectively (Figures 3H and 3I).
Intriguingly, a subset of SNcp cells were VGAT negative (Fig-
ures 1A, 1J, and 1M) yet all postsynaptic currents measured
were GABAergic (Figure 3E). We hypothesized that some SNr
cells are able to sustain inhibitory transmission using non-canon-
ical processes. SNr slices obtained from GAD67-GFP mice were
stained against PV and 44.8% of PV immuno-positive cells co-
expressed GAD67 (Figures S4A and S4B). In addition, midbrain
neurons have been reported to release GABA in the absence of
VGAT using the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2 (Tritsch
et al., 2012). We also verified this possibility and stained SNr
tissue against PV and VMAT2 and detected 72.1% of neurons

 co-expressing both markers (Figures S4C and S4D). These data
provide experimental evidence that PV SNr neurons possess
the elements necessary to release GABA in the absence of VGAT.
As a final characterization step, we evaluated the afferents of
the two cell populations using a transsynaptic rabies tracing
approach (Wickersham et al., 2007). An adeno-associated virus
(AAV2/1-DIO-Ef1a-TVA-T2A-CVS11G) was injected into the SNr
of VGAT- or PV-CRE mice to express the TVA receptor in VGAT
and PV cells. Three days later, monosynaptic rabies tracing was
initiated with the injection of an EnvA-coated SADDG rabies virus
in the SNr (Figure 4A). Five days after the viral rabies injection,
mice were sacrificed and their brains were sectioned and immu-
nohistologically processed (Leinweber et al., 2017). We focused
our quantitative analysis on the main direct and indirect pathway
inputs, namely the dorsal striatum and STN, respectively, and
locally within the SNr. All three regions provided equivalent input
to both VGAT and PV SNr cells. Although some marginal local
connectivity was detected, its contribution was much lower in
terms of the relative number of presynaptic inputs (Figures
4B–4D), suggesting that local connectivity within the SNr be-
tween VGAT and PV cells is rather limited.
Collectively, our anatomical, genetic, and functional profiling
data strongly suggest that the SNr holds at least two distinct
inhibitory pathways: the CMp expressing either VGAT with no
or low levels of PV and the SNcp with either no or low levels of
VGAT. These two pathways exhibit different firing properties
and although their input connectivity seems equivalent, their
output targets are distinct. Altogether, these multi-level experi-
mental correlates validate the use of VGAT and PV as modest
markers for investigating the role of CMp and SNcp respectively,
in a behavioral domain.
Optogenetic Activation of VGAT and PV Neurons
Differentially Impairs Movement
To dissect the role of CMp and SNcp in movement, we stereo-
taxically injected VGAT- or PV-CRE mice with a CRE-dependent
viral construct to bilaterally express DIO-ChR2 in the SNr and im-
planted optic fibers above each hemisphere. CRE-negative WT
littermate mice were also injected and served as a control group
(Figure 5A). Considering the high baseline firing rate of SNr
neurons, we used a 50-Hz light protocol aimed at increasing
the neurons’ activity relative to their baseline firing.

 We first validated such a protocol by performing juxta-cellular
recordings in vivo under anesthesia. After a 5-min light stimula-
tion, both VGAT and PV neurons came back to their basal activ-
ity and showed no depolarization block or lasting effects
(Figure S5).
We next tested the effects of light stimulation of either VGAT or
PV SNr cells on the spontaneous locomotion in an open field
arena. This led to a significant and similar decrease in the
bout number (Figure 5B) and bout speed (Figure 5C) for both
VGAT- and PV-CRE mice as compared to the control group.
Interestingly, the light stimulation induced an increase in bout
length (Figure 5D) and duration (Figure 5E) in VGAT- but not in
PV-CRE mice. Due to less but longer bouts during light stimula-
tion, VGAT-CRE mice showed no overall change in total distance
traveled as opposed to PV-CRE animals, which covered a
shorter distance (Figure S6A). Similarly, only PV-CRE mice had
an increased immobility time (Figure S6B). As with the data ob-
tained in Figure S1, the control mice showed no change in
response to light illumination, in any of the parameters analyzed.
We then tested the effect of general or cell-type-specific SNr
stimulation in a more challenging motor task: the elevated static
rod test (Figures 5F–5L) (Deacon, 2013). In brief, mice were
placed on elevated rods that had to be traversed in order to
reach a safety platform. The decreasing diameter of the rods
increases the difficulty (Figure 5G). We compared the perfor-
mance without and with light stimulation of either all, VGAT, or
PV SNr cells. At baseline, all mice showed a similar performance
judged by the number of rods completed (Figure 5H), the orien-
tation time (Figure 5I), and the transit time (Figure 5J). Upon light
stimulation, non-specific SNr activation dramatically impaired
performance, decreasing the number of rods successfully
completed (Figure 5H) and significantly increasing the orienta-
tion (Figures 5I and 5K) and transit times (Figures 5J and 5L).
Upon VGAT cell stimulation, mice were also impaired, showing
a decreased number of completed rods (Figure 5H), as well
as increased orientation and transit times (Figures 5I–5L).
Comparatively, light stimulation of PV neurons left performance
unaffected (Figures 5H–5L). When comparing the overall effect
across the three groups, we observed that the control and
VGAT-CRE mice were similarly impaired by SNr light illumina-
tion, whereas PV-CRE animals remained unaffected.
To better understand these behavioral divergences, we next
considered the nature of the two output targets. VGAT cells
inhibit a sub-nucleus of the thalamus, already identified by pio-
neering studies (Alexander et al., 1986; DeLong, 1990) whereas
PV neurons inhibit a neuro-modulatory system of the BG,
SNc DA cells, whose role in movement initiation is critical as
evidenced by the motor impairments observed in Parkinson’s
disease where they severely degenerate (Braak et al., 2004;
Hornykiewicz, 1975; Tanner and Aston, 2000). So, we investi-
gated whether the selective manipulation of PV cell activity
would be sufficient to drive the classical reward-related behavior
linked to midbrain DA neuro-modulation. We conducted the real-
time place preference task (Tan et al., 2012; Stamatakis et al.,
2013) with VGAT-CRE and PV-CRE positive and negative
littermate mice expressing DIO-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP in the SNr
(Figure 6A). Similarly, to the control group, VGAT-CRE mice
spent an equal amount of time in each chamber. In stark
contrast, PV-CRE mice showed a strong aversion to the light-
paired chamber (Figures 6B and 6C). The entries to the stimu-
lated chamber remained homogeneous throughout the test for
all mice (Figures S7A–S7C) with a similar total number of entries
to the light-paired chamber (Figure S7D), notably PV-CRE mice
had a shorter average visit to the light-paired chamber (Fig-
ure S7E) and spent more time moving away from it (Figure S7F).
In addition, when further analyzing the locomotor bouts, while
VGAT-CRE and PV-CRE mice showed a lower number of
bouts in the light-paired chamber, there were no significant
differences in terms of numbers of bouts normalized to the
time spent in the light-paired chamber (Figure S7G), inter-bout
interval (Figure S7H), or speed (Figure S7I). The VGAT-CRE
group exhibited an increased bout length and duration as
compared to control mice (Figures S7J and S7K). Again,
PV-CRE mice showed no impairment in these latter two param-
eters (Figures S7J and S7K) but, interestingly, showed a reduc-
tion in immobility time (Figure S7L). This last result would suggest
that an increase in SNr PV activity can have a bidirectional net
effect on locomotion that is context dependent. In an open field
arena, PV activation led to increased immobility (Figure S6B), but
in a real-time place preference (RTPP) context, this effect was
overridden
and
PV
activation
produced
rapid
movement
aimed at escaping the light-paired chamber, ultimately reducing
immobility (Figure S7L).
We further investigated this PV-inhibitory control over DA SNc
cells in vivo and assessed this connectivity. Again, PV-CRE mice
were injected with DIO-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP in the SNr, and
nigral single-unit extracellular recordings were performed under
anesthesia. An optic fiber was placed in the recording pipet to
provide blue light stimulation to the recorded neurons (Figures
6D and 6E). PV neurons were photo-tagged, identified based

 on their increased firing upon 1-s blue light stimulation (Figures
6F–6K) with a latency of 9.6 ± 2.6 ms. A subset of recorded
neurons exhibited a significant decrease in firing rate in response
to the light stimulation (Figures 6F–6K). These cells were
characterized by a wider action potential (Figures 6G and 6H),
corresponding to the identity of DA neurons as proposed by
Lacey et al. (1989); Ungless and Grace (2012), and Ungless
et al. (2004). These data further validate our previous in vitro
functional observations and confirm that the SNcp pathway
was made of the SNr PV-expressing cells exerting an inhibitory
control over DA SNc cells.
Together our data suggest that the SNr PV cells efficiently con-
trol the activity of DA SNc neurons known to exert a feed-forward
striatal modulation crucial during movement onset (Dodson
et al., 2016; Howe and Dombeck, 2016).
CMp and SNcp Pathways Work Collaboratively to Shape
Locomotion
CMp (VGAT) and SNcp (PV) have different effects on motor
behavior and they receive similar BG inputs. We next wanted to
understand whether these two pathways work in sintony or in
opposition. To test this, we first performed unilateral cell-type-
specific optogenetic manipulations and compared the behavioral
phenotype to the one induced by contralateral non-specific SNr
stimulation (providing an internal control). The CRE-dependent
AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-EYF viral construct was injected
unilaterally in the SNr of VGAT-CRE or PV-CRE mice, while the
contralateral hemisphere was infected with a non-selective viral
construct AAV5-hSyn-ChR2(H134R)-EYP. Optic fibers were bilat-
erally implanted locally (Figure 7A). This allowed us to photo-
activate only the VGAT or PV neurons and compare the effect
against the non-selective SNr activation within the same subject.
In all baseline conditions (light off), mice did not significantly rotate
as quantified by 360� full turns. Upon non-selective SNr stimula-
tion, mice performed robust turning in the ipsiversive direction
to the stimulation side. Selective light stimulation of VGAT or PV
cells also triggered ipsiversive rotation, although significantly
weaker than that due to non-specific activation (Figures 7B–7D).
These data are consistent with a study where a 40-Hz optogenetic
stimulation of VGAT neurons produced ipsiversive movement
bias measured by head angle (Hormigo et al., 2016).
VGAT neuron manipulation recapitulates only partially the
motor phenotype observed with non-specific SNr activation;
comparatively, PV cell manipulation leads to an active place
avoidance phenotype. This highlights how a specific coordina-
tion in activity between the two pathways might be necessary
to efficiently generate proper locomotion. To evaluate this possi-
bility, we first cross-bred VGAT-ChR2 with PV-CRE mice and ex-
pressed in a CRE-dependent manner either DIO-Arch3.0-EYFP
or DIO-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP in PV cells. This allowed us to either
silence or activate the PV population during VGAT activation. We
then tested both experimental designs in the unilateral stimula-
tion rotation test (Figures 7E–7H). Activation of VGAT cells
together with inhibition of PV neurons triggered an increase in
the number of unilateral rotations (Figure 7F) similar to VGAT
activation alone (Figure 7B), whereas simultaneous light activa-
tion of both VGAT and PV cells was necessary and sufficient to
induce a robust enough rotation phenotype similar to non-selec-
tive SNr neuron activation (Figures 7B, 7C, and 7H).
To further confirm the pathway specificity and collaborative
character of both sub-circuits, we manipulated directly the SNr
output targets. In order to mimic VGAT and PV cell activation,
we sought to induce inhibition of CM and DA SNc cells both
independently and simultaneously. We therefore expressed
DIO-Arch3.0-EYFP in a CRE-dependent way, injecting viral con-
structs unilaterally in the SNc of DAT-CRE mice (Turiault et al.,
2007) and in the same hemisphere targeted the CM to express
Arch3.0-EYFP in a non CRE-dependent manner. Mice were
then implanted with one optic fiber above the SNc and another
one above the CM (Figures 7I and 7J). While direct inhibition of
either the CM or DA SNc cells alone induced ipsiversive rotation,
albeit moderate and not significant, a strong rotation phenotype
was recapitulated only upon simultaneous inhibition of both
post-synaptic targets (Figure 7K). These data provide evidence
that the SNr sub-circuits arising from CMp (VGAT) and SNcp
(PV) cells, respectively, have a much more efficient effect on mo-
tor execution when active in sintony.
DISCUSSION
The findings presented here suggest that the SNr contains cells
embedded in distinct pathways that play a role in specific

 aspects of locomotion and cooperate to sculpt motor behavior.
We identified the CMps that arise from VGAT-expressing
neurons and send long-range projections to mono-synaptically
and
preferentially
inhibit
the
CM
thalamic
neurons
and
conversely the SNcp that arise from PV-expressing fast spiking
cells that locally inhibit DA cells of the SNc. Although both path-
ways receive similar inputs from the striatum and the STN, they
are differentially implicated in locomotion. Photo-stimulation of
the CMp (VGAT) was sufficient to disrupt spontaneous locomo-
tion, impair motor coordination, and induce ipsiversive rotation
but had no effect on the real-time place preference task. In
contrast, photo-activation of the SNcp (PV) only partially
impaired spontaneous locomotion, and also induced ipsiversive
rotation, but left motor coordination unaffected and triggered a
strong avoidance. Here, we provide a further resolved view of
the SNr where CMp (VGAT) and SNcp (PV) sub-circuits are
responsible for distinct but complementary components of BG
motor functions. We confirmed this hypothesis by manipulating
both pathways in opposition or in collaboration.
Cellular heterogeneity of the SNr has been suggested in the
past (Beckstead and Frankfurter, 1982; Deniau et al., 1996,
2007). Golgi staining in rodents (Juraska et al., 1977) and pri-
mates (Yelnik et al., 1987) has revealed diversity in morpholog-
ical features such as soma shape or dendritic arborization
(Danner and Pfister, 1982). In vitro and in vivo electrophysiolog-
ical studies have also suggested heterogeneity in terms of firing
properties in vitro (Deniau et al., 1978; Wilson et al., 1977) and in
freely moving rats (Gulley et al., 1999). However, biochemically
identified SNr cells do not always present distinct morphological
and electrophysiological properties (Lee and Tepper, 2007),
highlighting the complexity of nigral sub-circuits and the need
for comprehensive studies. Our study represents a forward
step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the SNr
anatomy and function. Specifically, our single-cell qPCR data
reveal that although only partially exclusive VGAT and PV
markers are clearly differentially expressed and strongly corre-
late with output target and behavioral specificity; it is likely that
further genetic profiling (Tasic et al., 2016) of SNr cells will pro-
vide better markers that better correspond to fully segregated
defined sub-circuits and functions.
Our in vitro functional data report a lack of connectivity from
PV-positive neurons to the CM; however, our retrograde tracing
results suggest that about 20% of CM projecting neurons
express PV. In light of our single-cell qPCR data, very low levels
of PV could translate into low and inefficient recombination and
ChR2 expression, leading to the limited release of neurotrans-
mitters driven by light stimulation and resulting in the lack of
detectable IPSCs from putative PV-positive axons at the level
of the CM.
Our monosynaptic afferent tracing data confirm inputs from
the dorsal striatum and the STN but also locally. No significant
difference was found between VGAT and PV-expressing cells,
which does not exclude a possible difference from other brain
areas.
Our data show that activation of VGAT and PV SNr cells induce
behavioral alterations at a motor level. The effects that we
observe are presumably the product of changes in brain activity
in a larger network and at multiple brain regions that are part of
the well-established BG network (i.e., thalamus, motor cortex,
striatum, and globus pallidus internal segment). However,
mimicking the effect of the activation of these two cell popula-
tions in synchrony or by directly inhibiting one of each of their
post-synaptic partners proved sufficient to recapitulate the
motor effects previously observed. This suggests that while
changes in activity at other sites likely participate in the produc-
tion of correct motor patterns, the CM and the SNc DA are major
contributors to BG-mediated function.
Sub-circuit cooperation in the BG is an emerging concept.
Since the rate model was proposed (DeLong, 1990), it was
widely accepted that the direct and indirect pathways emerging
from the dorsal striatum work in opposition (Hikida et al., 2010;
Kravitz et al., 2012; Tai et al., 2012). In recent years, due to tech-
nological advances, the use of in vivo calcium imaging in freely
moving rodents challenged this opposing dynamic hypothesis
(Isomura et al., 2013). Indeed, both MSN types were shown to
be co-activated while mice were spontaneously turning (Cui
et al., 2013) or performing an action initiation-execution task
(Tecuapetla et al., 2016). In the latter study, optogenetic manip-
ulation of one or both striatal cellular populations confirmed a
cooperative rather than opposing regulation of movement. Our
experimental observations are in line with such findings with
the proof of principle of the collaborative properties of CMp
(VGAT) and SNcp (PV). Activation of CMp (VGAT) induced robust
motor impairments. Notably it increased the bout length and
duration during spontaneous locomotion. Jin et al. (2014) have
previously shown that complex motor actions are heteroge-
neously represented in striatal, nigral, and pallidal neuronal
activity. Taking this into consideration, we hypothesize that a
sustained level of CMp (VGAT) activity prevents the interruption
of a motor program, in our case prolonging the average locomo-
tor bout duration and length observed both in the open field test
(Figure 5) and the real-time place avoidance test (Figure 6).

 Increased midbrain DA activity correlates with increased loco-
motion (Kalivas and Stewart, 1991; Kelly and Moore, 1976). As
expected, when activating PV neurons, we observed a mild
decrease in locomotor bout number and speed. Furthermore,
manipulating PV cell activity was sufficient to induce place avoid-
ance, leaving motor coordination unaffected. Taken together, our
results suggest that while PV SNr neurons participate in a network
able to provide immediate locomotor drive via the modulation of
SNc DA activity that ultimately feeds back to the striatum, VGAT
SNr cells provide modulation of thalamo-cortical activity that sup-
ports the continuity of motor patterns. Future work may clarify the
unique and overlapping and/or complementary behavioral contri-
bution of other SNr subpopulations.
Overall, our data provide information that needs to be placed in
the context of BG-related pathologies such as Parkinson’s dis-
ease (PD) where DA is lacking and locomotion is deficient. Indeed,
the ratio between tonic to bursting discharge patterns in the SNr
has been shown to be modified after pharmacological lesion of
DA SNc neurons (Burbaud et al., 1995) toward less cells exhibiting
tonic firing. Considering that the tonically active neurons have
been proposed to express PV (Rajakumar et al., 1994), it is
tempting to question whether a specific SNr sub-population is
more susceptible in PD, and how this affects motor outputs and
motivational states, both known to be affected by this pathology.
This is one example of how an in-depth characterization of all sub-
classes and sub-circuits would provide crucial information of BG
function and organization, creating opportunities to tackle cen-
turies of neurodegenerative conditions that severely affect the
ever-growing aging population worldwide.

 METHOD DETAILS
Surgical Procedures
Red and green retrograde latex beads (100-300ml, Lumafluor), adeno-associated viruses to express the opsins (300ml, AAV5-hSyn-
GFP, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-Arch3.0-GFP, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-GFP, UNC vector core) or synapto-
physin (300ml, AAV5-phSyn1(S)-FLEX-tdTomato-T2A-SypEGFP-WPRE, UNC vector core) were used. All injections were performed
under isoflurane anesthesia (5% induction and 1.5% from maintenance). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and craniotomies
were performed bilaterally over the SNr (AP �3.8, ML ± 1.45, DV �4.4 to bregma), the CM (AP �1.7, ML �0.1, DV �3.3 to bregma) or
SNc (AP �3.8, ML ± 1.45, DV �3.9 to bregma). Using the stereotaxic frame, a thin glass capillary was carefully lowered to the region
of interest and beads or viruses were infused at a rate of 100nl/min. After the intended volume was injected 3-5 minutes were given to
allow the diffusion of the injection in the tissue. The glass capillary was then carefully retracted to prevent backflow of the
injected medium. Optic Fibers were constructed as described in Sparta et al. (2011) and implanted 0.2mm above the injection
site. Experiments were performed after 10 to 15 days post beads injections and 4 to 6 weeks post-viral injections. Only data
originating from animals with a correct injection placement and restricted spread was included in the study. The anatomical validation
of the injections was performed after the culmination of the experimental procedures and data analysis.
Monosynaptic Input Mapping
Mice were first injected in the SNr of VGAT- and PV-CRE mice with 300ml of AAV2/1-DIO-Ef1a-TVA950-T2A-CVS11G and three days
later with 500ml of EnvA-SADDG-GFP (courtesy from G. Keller). Five days after the rabies virus injection, mice were given a lethal dose
of anesthesia (pentobarbital 300mg/kg) and transcardially perfused first with PBS and then with 4% PFA. Brains were extracted
and kept in 4% PFA overnight, then transferred to 30% sucrose to induce partial dehydration and cryoprotection. 60mm slices
were then prepared using a cryostat (Leica). The peptide linker 2A expression was amplified with a rabbit anti peptide 2A antibody
(1/1000, Millipore) followed by an Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti rabbit antibody (1/500, Thermofisher). Stained slices were then
mounted and images were prepared with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM700) for quantification of starter cells and rabies labeled
presynaptic cells throughout the brain.
Behavioral Assays
Optogenetic Stimulation
The light power for optogenetic stimulation (473nm or 532nm) was titrated using a power-meter (Thorlabs) and set to 10-12mW at the
end of the patch cable. The optic fibers had an efficiency of 70%–75% therefore the light illumination at the tip of the optic fibers is
estimated at 7-9mW.
For ChR2 activation, a 5msec pulse at 50Hz light protocol was used taking into consideration the high basal firing rate of SNr
neurons. Arch3.0 activation was achieved with constant light.
Open Field Spontaneous Locomotion
Animals were placed in a rectangular (30x45cm) arena and were free to explore. Optogenetic light stimulation was counterbalanced
and alternated during one-minute epochs at 50Hz, 10-12mW, 473nm for a total of 6min. Automated tracking software (ANY-maze,
Stoelting) was used to track all movements of the animals. Data from light ON and light OFF periods was pooled together and post
hoc analyzed using MATLAB (Mathworks) according to the criteria described by Ruder et al. (2016).
Real-Time Place Preference
Animals were placed in a rectangular arena (20x60cm) with two identical compartments separated by a 5mm thin wall with a center
opening allowing free transit between compartments. One of the chambers was paired with blue light stimulation (10-12mW, 50Hz,
473nm). ANY-maze (Stoelting) was used to track the position of the animals and trigger the laser stimulation upon entrance to the light
paired chamber. Each reported parameter was automatically calculated by software and additional post hoc analysis was performed
on the raw tracked data using MATLAB (Mathworks).
Elevated Static Rod Test
Animals were tested in the elevated static rod test as described before (Deacon, 2013), during two consecutive days, one of which
was performed without any optogenetic stimulation. During the test day the light (10-12mW, 50Hz, 473nm) was delivered from the
moment the mice were placed on the rod, until they reached the platform or fell off the rods. Videos were recorded at 30fps and post
hoc analyzed to time the orientation and transit of all mice on each rod.
Unilateral Rotation
Rotation experiments were performed in a rectangular arena (30x45cm). Blue (473nm) or green (532nm) light (10-12mW) was
delivered through implanted optic fibers at 50Hz (blue) or constant light (green) for optogenetic activation or inhibition respectively.
The number of conditions tested determined the total duration of the tests. Experiments consisted of unilateral light stimulation during
5min, always preceded by a 5min light OFF baseline. The first hemisphere stimulated was counterbalanced among all positive and
control animals. The rotation phenotype was assessed quantifying the number of complete 360-degree turns executed by the
animals both in the ipsi- and contralateral directions in relation to the hemisphere being stimulated.

 Electrophysiology in Acute Brain Slices
Acute coronal slices (200mm) containing either the SN or the CM were prepared using a vibrotome (Leica) in iced-cold cutting solution
(in mM: kynureic acid 3, NaHCO3 26.2, MgCl2 4.9, CaCl2 1.22, Glucose 1.25 and sucrose 225). Slices were incubated in ACSF
solution (in mM: NaCl 119, NaHCO3 26.2, KCl 2.5, MgCl2 (6H2O) 1.3, NaHPO4 1, CaCl2 2.5, Glucose 11, pH 7.3) at 31�C for
30 minutes before resting at RT. Slices were then transferred to the recording chamber, super-fused with ringer at 2ml/min bubbled
with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Neurons were visualized with an IR camera on an Olympus scope U-TV1X-2 and whole cell patch
clamp recordings (multiclamp 700B amplifier) were made. The internal solution contained for voltage clamp recordings (in mM:
KGluconate 30, KCl 100, Creatine Phosphate 10, MgCl2 4, Na2ATP 3.4, Na3GTP 0.1, EGTA 1.1 and HEPES 5, pH 7.3, osmolarity
290). Cells were clamped at �60mV or �50mV in case of DA SNc cells. ChR2 stimulation was done with 1 or 2 pulses of 5msec
473nm blue light, 50msec apart with a Cool-LED pE-100 mounted on the microscope. PTX was used at 100mm, TTX at 500nM
and 4AP at 300mm.
For current clamp recording the solution contained (in mM: KGluconate 130, Creatine Phosphate 10, MgCl2 4, Na2ATP 3.4,
Na3GTP 0.1, EGTA 1.1 and HEPES 5, pH 7.3, osmolarity 290). Increasing amount of current was injected to trigger cell firing.
For cell reconstructions, biocytin (5mg/ml, #B1758 from Sigma) was added to the internal patch solution. At the end of the
recording (at least 20min to allow the biocytin to fill the cell), the recording pipet was slowly retracted and the slice placed in 4%
PFA overnight to then be processed through immunohistochemistry to reveal both the biocytin and the presence or absence of TH.
For all recordings the experimenter was initially blind concerning the identity of the preparation. However, the presence/absence of
beads or ChR2-EYFP fibers was instantaneously revealed as the slices observed under the scope to locate the region of interest.
Single Cell Quantitative PCR
The single cell qPCR procedure was done following Jennings et al. (2013). Specifically, cytosol extraction was performed through the
patch clamp technique with glass capillaries backfilled with a KCL-internal solution containing (in mM):135 KCL, 0.5 EGTA,
10 HEPES, 1.5 MgCl2 in nucleotide free water. 5ml of RNASe inhibitor was added per 1ml of internal solution. Once the cell membrane
was opened, the cytoplasm was aspirated, the pipette tip was removed from the tissue and broken into an RNase-free PCR tube.
About 5ml of internal solution containing cytoplasmic material was then injected using positive pressure. The silver wire of the
recording pipette was wiped with alcohol in between each recording to minimize cross sample contamination. In addition, a contam-
ination control was added, after every 5th recording, a pipette was lowered into the tissue and also processed for qPCR.
The extracts were processed following the Single Cell-to-Ct Kit protocol (Life technologies). In short, the extract was lysed
with DNase (volume adapted to the initial cytoplasmic extract volume). Reverse transcription followed by a preamplification of
VGAT, PV and GAPDH was performed. Finally, a qPCR assay was run to obtain CT values for each target using TaqMan assays
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Technical duplicates from each cell as well as the control tissue was done on the same 96 well-plate.
Last, a SNr tissue punch (200mm) was obtained and ran through the same procedure as for single cell gene profiling.
Only CT values that were consistent between duplicates were validated and included in the analysis. The contamination control did
not generate any detectable gene expression levels. VGAT and PV expression was normalized to that of GAPDH. Fold expression
values were calculated as the difference between the normalized VGAT or PV expression of each sample and the normalized
expression of the same gene in the SNr tissue punch.
In Vivo Extracellular Recordings
The single cell-extracellular recordings were performed as described in Tan et al. (2012). Briefly mice were isoflurane-anesthetized
(induction, 5%; maintenance, 0.5 to 1.5%) and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (WPI). Body temperature was maintained at 36�C
using a heating pad. A cranial window was drilled above the SN (AP �3.4 to 3.8, ML 1.0 to 1.3, DV 3.9 to 4.2), and the dura was care-
fully retracted. The glass recording capillaries were back filled with oxygenated ringer and contained an optic fiber coupled to a blue
laser which power intensity was set to reach 10-20mW at the tip. The capillary was lowered to the level of the skull at which point the Z
coordinate was zeroed on the micro-manipulator controlling the descent of the capillary. Once the zero was set, the capillary was
lowered slowly and recordings were performed between 3900 mm below the zero point and until no more units were audible (roughly
5100 mm below zero). The spontaneous firing rate was recorded and acquired continuously while a 1sec blue light pulse at 20Hz was
applied every 10sec.
For the validation of the 50Hz light stimulation applied during some of the behavioral tests, 5ms pulse 50Hz 473nm stimulation was
provided to the recorded cells for a duration of 5 minutes. Pre- and post- stimulation data was acquired to compare the change in
firing rate during the stimulation epoch. All electrophysiological recordings (in vivo and in vitro) were analyzed using MATLAB
(Mathworks).
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization
Fresh brains were quickly dissected and frozen in dry ice then stored at �80�C overnight. 15mm slices containing the region of interest
were prepared on a cryostat (Leica) and mounted on super frost plus charged slides (Thermofisher). Slices were then fixed,
dehydrated, digested, hybridized and developed following the standard procedures from Advanced Cell Diagnostics for a multiplex
fluorescent in situ hybridization protocol.
Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM700 microscope, processed with FIJI (imageJ).

 Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital (300mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with PBS and 4% PFA in
phosphate buffer. Brains were extracted and post-fixed overnight at 4�C and sliced at 60mm with a vibratome (Leica) or placed in
30% sucrose until saturated then sliced at 60mm with a cryostat (Leica). Slices were washed 3min three times in TBST, then incubated
for 20min RT in a permeabilization solution (10% triton in TBST) washed again 3min three times and incubated for 2hrs in a blocking
solution (5% bovine serum albumin in TBST). Immunohistochemistry staining was done using a rabbit anti-TH (1/500, #T8700 from
Sigma) or a rabbit anti-PV (1/500, #PV27 from Swant), goat anti-VMAT2 (1/50, #SC-7721 from Santa Cruz) primary antibodies
overnight at 4�C, then revealed with donkey anti rabbit or anti goat secondary antibodies (1/500, #A21206, #A21432 from
Thermofisher) or streptavidin-Alexa 350 to reveal the biocytin (1/500, #S11249 from Life Technologies) for 2hrs at RT. Slices were
finally washed in TBST and then mounted for imaging and quantification.
Data Exclusion Criteria
The only exclusion criterion was based on post hoc validation of viral injections and fiber placement where applicable.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All graphs show mean values and SEM. Unpaired Student t test was used for comparisons between two data groups. One way
or mixed ANOVA tests followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were applied in experiments with more than two groups.
All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism.
Additional mixed ANOVA analysis information are provided in Tables S1–S6.
