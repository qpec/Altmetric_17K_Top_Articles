Global integration of information in the brain results from complex interactions of segregated
brain networks. Identifying the most influential neuronal populations that efficiently bind
these networks is a fundamental problem of systems neuroscience. Here, we apply optimal
percolation theory and pharmacogenetic interventions in vivo to predict and subsequently
target nodes that are essential for global integration of a memory network in rodents. The
theory predicts that integration in the memory network is mediated by a set of low-degree
nodes located in the nucleus accumbens. This result is confirmed with pharmacogenetic
inactivation of the nucleus accumbens, which eliminates the formation of the memory net-
work, while inactivations of other brain areas leave the network intact. Thus, optimal per-
colation theory predicts essential nodes in brain networks. This could be used to identify
targets of interventions to modulate brain function.

 A
fundamental question in systems neuroscience is how the
brain integrates distributed and specialized networks into
a coherent information processing system1,2. Brain net-
works are considered integrated when they exhibit long-range
correlated activity over distributed areas in the brain2–6. Corre-
lation of brain activity is typically measured using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the correlation structure
is often referred to as “functional connectivity”2–6.
Current network theory applied to such brain networks
suggests that integration of specialized modules in the brain
is facilitated by a set of essential nodes2–4,7,8. Perturbations
in such essential nodes are therefore expected to lead to
large disturbances in functional connectivity affecting global
integration2,5,8. A number of neurological and psychiatric dis-
orders have been attributed to disruption in the functional con-
nectivity in the brain5,9 and many of the alterations associated
with
brain
disorders
are
likely
concentrated
on
essential
nodes10–13. Thus, identifying these essential nodes is a key step
toward understanding information processing in brain circuits,
and may help in the design of targeted interventions to restore or
compensate dysfunctional correlation patterns in disease states of
the brain9.
There are several studies that have used network centrality mea-
sures to identify the essential nodes in brain networks3–6,8,9,14–17.
These measures include the hubs (nodes with many connections),
betweenness centrality (BC)18, closeness centrality (CC)19, eigen-
vector centrality (EC)20,21, the k-core22,23, and collective influence
(CI) centrality which uses optimal percolation theory24 to identify
essential nodes8 (see 16,25 for a review).
These centrality measures can be used as a ranking to deter-
mine the most influential nodes in brain networks, and nodes
with the highest ranking are considered to be the “essential”
nodes for integration. While each centrality provides a different
aspect of influence16, a common prediction of all measures is that
when the essential nodes are inactivated in a targeted interven-
tion, integration in the overall network is largely prevented2,5,8.
That is, when inactivated, nodes with the highest rank lead to the
largest damage to the long-range correlations. Thus, the optimal
centrality measure would be the one which prevents integration
of the network by inactivating the fewest number of nodes24,26.
The minimal set of nodes that upon inactivation destroy the
integration of the network is obtained by mapping the problem to
optimal percolation24. Finding this minimal set of essential nodes
is an NP-hard problem in general26. Yet, it can be approximately
solved with an efficient algorithm called Collective Influence (CI)
assuming sparse network connectivity8,24.
Some of the centrality measures have been studied using
analytical and numerical methods, and have been associated with
different clinical phenotypes5,9,16. However, their importance for
brain integration has not been directly tested experimentally with
prospective interventions. The effects of removing a node from a
network has been studied with simulations, both for human and
animal brain networks11,27,28, but direct in vivo validations are
rare. Thus, there is no well-grounded approach to predict which
nodes are essential for brain integration.
Here, we address this problem empirically in an in vivo rodent
preparation. We experimentally generate a network of long-range
functional connections between diverse brain areas. Specifically,
we induce synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat
dentate gyrus29, which results in correlated evoked fMRI activity
in brain areas that are involved during memory encoding and
consolidation. These include the hippocampus (HC), the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAc)30. The
key question is this: Which are the essential nodes in this memory
network that are necessary for these long-range functional
interactions to form. We first identify the nodes that maximally
disrupt the integrated memory network by systematic inactiva-
tion of essential nodes identified following the different centrality
criteria. We find that centralities fall into two classes: hub-
centralities (degree, k-core, EC) which only identify the hubs at
the stimulation site (the HC), and integrative centralities (CI and
BC) which identify “weak nodes”, i.e., low-degree yet highly
influential nodes for brain integration, notably, in the NAc. Using
pharmacogenetic inactivation31, we validate in vivo the theore-
tical prediction, namely, that weak nodes in the shell of the NAc
are essential for the integration into a larger memory network.
These experimental results confirm the importance of going
beyond the direct connection of hubs and instead considering the
CI of nodes on network integration24.
Results
Overall approach. Our combined experimental and modeling
approach takes the following steps: First, induce a functional
network in vivo using synaptic LTP in the rat HC. Second, model
this functional brain network as the result of pairwise interactions
in a sparse brain network. Third, identify and compare the
essential integrators using various centrality criteria based on the
topology of the brain network. Finally, inhibit the predicted
essential and non-essential nodes in the in vivo preparation and
test whether network integration is prevented only for essential
nodes, as predicted by the theory. In the following, we elaborate
on each of these steps.
Experimentally coupling functional networks in vivo. LTP of
synaptic connections is considered the cellular basis of learning
and
memory29.
Combined
fMRI
and
electrophysiological
experiments have demonstrated that LTP induction in the per-
forant pathway, the major entorhinal cortex input to the dentate
gyrus, causes a lasting increase of fMRI activity in distant brain
areas such as neocortical and mesolimbic sites (PFC and NAc)30.
This result suggests that the impact of local synaptic plasticity is
not restricted to the synaptic relay at which it is induced, as it is
so usually studied, but can facilitate long-range propagation of
activity more broadly into a network formed by the different
activated areas in the brain. While this network formation is
known to depend on the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors30, the precise mechanisms and relative
importance of the different structures to its formation are not
known32. Thus, this LTP paradigm represents an ideal system to
investigate the essential nodes for long-range integration.
We follow a well-characterized protocol to induce LTP (details
of experiments in Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Note 2) and apply
high-frequency pulsed stimulation (250 Hz) of the perforant
pathway of the HC in six rats. We apply low-frequency
stimulation (10 Hz) before (PRE) and 3 h after (POST) LTP
induction, to evoke activity in the hippocampal formation while
concurrently performing fMRI. Low-frequency stimulation does
not affect synaptic efficacy but does allow us to measure activated
brain areas with fMRI (e.g., Fig. 1c shows response to stimulation
relative to baseline at p < 0.001, corrected). We verify that
synaptic potentiation is induced by the high-frequency stimula-
tion by measuring the concomitant electrophysiological record-
ings from the dentate gyrus as shown in Fig. 1b, e, f.
LTP induction results in the propagation of evoked fMRI
activity to a long-range functional network beyond the site of
low-frequency stimulation (ipsilateral HC). Activations after LTP
induction (POST) are reported in Fig. 1g for a single animal, and
in Supplementary Fig. 1a for the average over six animals.
Compared to the baseline activation (PRE), we see enhanced
bilateral fMRI activation of the HC, and activation in frontal and
prefrontal neocortical regions (PFC), as well as the NAc (see

Note 2). Conversely, low-frequency stimulation of the perforant
pathway before LTP induction produces no fMRI activity in the
PFC nor in the NAc (Fig. 1i).
Generate a brain network model. The voxels with significant
fMRI activation (due to the low-frequency probe after LTP
induction) form the nodes of the network model (see Supple-
mentary Note 3 for details). We focus on evoked activity as we are
interested in propagating functional activity in the memory net-
work, rather than spontaneous resting state activity, which will be
discussed further below (Section 2). The fMRI signal of the
activated voxels is used to compute a functional connectivity
matrix, i.e., pairwise correlations between voxels, separately for
each animal. To build the computational model of the functional
network, we proceed in two steps. First, we identify the clusters of
nodes associated with different brain areas, and then we deter-
mine the “connectivity” between nodes.
It is well established that the functional connectivity matrix
exhibits a modular structure, with modules (or clusters of nodes)
typically associated with different anatomical brain areas33. To
identify
these
modules,
we
follow

procedures4,

 matrix7,34–36. We also register each brain to a standard
anatomical atlas (Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas37). With
this approach, we identified in each of the six animals three
dominant clusters of nodes (voxels), which overlap well with the
anatomical
location
of
the
HC,
the
PFC,
or
the
NAc
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
The conventional approach to generating a “connectivity”
matrix in brain networks models is to directly threshold the fMRI
correlation matrix4. However, correlations do not only arise
because two nodes exchange information or are directly linked,
but may arise due to common covariates. Furthermore, “spurious
connections” may result from a small sample size of the time
series used to compute correlations. To minimize the effects of
indirect covariation and sampling noise, we use a well-established
statistical inference method38. This method models the observed
correlations as the result of direct pairwise interactions, and
imposes a penalty to avoid negligible interactions. By varying a
penalization parameter, this widely used approach tunes the
sparsity of the network. As with the direct thresholding of the
correlation matrix4,7,39, there are various ways to select this
penalization parameter. We are interested in the formation of a
connected brain network, where the different brain areas are
linked with each other. Mathematically, this corresponds to the
emergence of the “giant connected component” covering the
entire network, i.e., all the nodes are connected through a path7,8.
We selected the penalization parameter that results in the sparsest
network which still exhibits a giant connected component (see
also Supplementary Note 3 for details).
In the following, the connections within each cluster are
referred to as intra-links, descriptive of short-range interactions
within nodes in the same sub-network40. Connections between
nodes belonging to different clusters are named inter-links, or
weak-links7,
reflecting
the
long-range
interactions
between
different sub-networks. Inter-links between the HC, NAc, and
PFC bind these networks into a unified brain network as seen in
Fig. 1j for a typical rat (inter- and intra-links shown in orange and
black, respectively)7,8,41. Once the network model has been
constructed, we proceed to identify the essential nodes for
integration.
Identifying essential integrators in the brain network model.
We define global integration as the formation of the largest
connected component of nodes in the network—the “giant con-
nected component” G. This is the graph that connects the largest
numbers of nodes through a path (highlighted in yellow in
Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Note 3). The emergence of such a
giant component is an important concept in percolation theory,
which studies the behavior of clusters in networks as a function of
a thresholding parameter of the graph42,43. The essential inte-
grators of the brain network are then the optimal set (minimal
number) of nodes that, upon inactivation, lead to a disintegration
of the giant component into smaller disconnected clusters. This is
the problem of optimal percolation, which attempt to find such a
minimal set of essential nodes or influencers8,24. Therefore, we
search for the essential nodes by systematic, numerical inactiva-
tion of nodes predicted by optimal percolation theory, while we
monitor the size of the giant component.
Inactivation proceeds in rank-order according to different
centralities. We first apply the hub centrality and thus sort the
nodes by their degree. While the hub-centrality is not optimal, it
is interesting to see how the hubs rank in terms of network
integration, since they have been identified as central to
integration in previous studies. As it is customary in network
theory8,14,24,42,43, we quantify the damage made to the integration
of the brain network by measuring the size of the largest
connected component G(q) after we remove a fraction q of nodes,
whereby nodes are removed in the order of degree from high to
low. Figure 2c shows G(q) under inactivation of a fraction of q
hubs (mostly HC nodes in red). The curve indicates that the
inactivation of hubs does not propagate the damage to the rest of
the network. That is, removal of 20% of hubs reduces the size of G
by the same amount to 80% of its original value for this
representative animal. Further, almost all the hubs are located in
the dentate gyrus of the HC. The hub map averaged over six
animals which plots the density of essential hubs in the brain, that
is, those hubs that create the largest damage upon inactivation
(calculated in Supplementary Note 4), is shown in Fig. 2g and
confirms that most of the essential hubs are located at the site of
LTP induction in the dentate gyrus. This is not surprising since
we stimulate its major input (the perforant pathway) to induce
the functional brain network. Inactivating the largest hubs in the
dentate gyrus experimentally would trivially disrupt the network
formation by directly preventing its local activation, rather than
by breaking the integration of the network. Thus, these top hubs
are trivial influencers.
To find essential nodes beyond the hubs at the HC, we follow
optimal percolation to estimate the minimal set of essential
nodes8,24 by ranking the nodes according to the CI algorithm8.
We find that the ranking following the CI centrality requires the
smallest number of inactivated nodes to break up the giant
component since CI arises from a maximization of the damage
done to the giant component8,24. The CI centrality is defined by
Eq. (2) in Supplementary Note 1 and quantifies the influence of a
node not only by its degree, but also by the degree of nodes
located in spheres of influence of size ‘—we refer to this as the
sphere of influence Ball(i, ‘) of radius ‘. Thus, CI can identify also

 low-degree nodes as influential as long as they are surrounded by
high-degree nodes in their spheres of influence.
As shown in the particular animal in Fig. 2c, the giant
component G(q) quickly disintegrates when removing the top CI
nodes (mostly NAc nodes in green). This result is consistent across
all six animals (Supplementary Fig. 3). In clear contrast to the
results obtained for hub-nodes, Fig. 2c shows that the removal of a
very small fraction of top CI nodes (~7% of the total) is sufficient
to reduce the giant component to 5% of its original size. Crucially,
most of the nodes in this influential set are located in the NAc as
shown in the sequence of network inactivation for this particular
animal in Fig. 2d–f. Figure 2h shows the CI-map averaged over six
animals, indicating that nodes essential to brain integration are
located in the NAc according to the CI algorithm. This anatomical
location is not predicted by conventional hub centrality since nodes
in the NAc do not appear among the top hubs (Fig. 2g).
To illustrate the different network properties captured by hubs
and CI centralities, consider Fig. 2b. Removing the node with the
largest CI (depicted in black) results in large damage to the giant
connected component (shaded in blue). Removing the largest hub
(depicted in white) causes relatively less damage (shaded in red).
Thus, the different nodes predicted by the hub and CI maps are
the result of long-range influence encoded in the CI measure,
which is not captured by the local measure of degree. We note
that the CI centrality includes the hub centrality as the zero-order
approximation when we take a sphere of influence of zero radius,
‘ = 0 in Supplementary Eq. (2). In this case, the influence
centrality of Eq. (2) measures the number of connections of each
node. When ‘ ≥ 1, CI captures effects emerging from the long-
range structure.
The anatomical localization of essential nodes predicted by the
other centrality measures is shown in Fig. 3. A detailed definition
of these centrality measures is provided in the Supplementary
Note 1. BC (BC-map, Fig. 3a) shares with the CI centrality (CI-
map, Fig. 2h) a similar location of essential nodes in the brain,
showing that the most influential nodes are located in the NAc
shell. This indicates that the influential nodes are also bridge
nodes captured by the BC.

 In contrast, the NAc does not appear with high k-core
centrality22 (KC-map, Fig. 3b), which shows a distribution of
essential nodes comparable to the hub map. This indicates that
the nodes at the inner k-core of the network are correlated with
their degree as expected by its definition. The EC (EC-map,
Fig. 3c) also shows essential nodes mainly located in the HC, as
expected since the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix are highly
localized by the hubs as shown in44. Finally, the CC (CC-map,
Fig. 3d) shows essential nodes for integration in the HC and in
the NAc to a lesser extent.
These results unveil a pattern in which centrality measures
dominated by local degree (hubs, k-core, EC) tend to identify
essential nodes in the hubs of the HC, since nodes with high
degree are mostly located in the HC region. These nodes, in the
present experiment, are trivially associated to the primary location
of stimulation, while centrality measurements that capture long-
range influence provide a non-trivial result highlighting the
strength of the low-degree nodes at the NAc. The role of the NAc,
thus, is analogous to a fundamental notion of sociology termed by
Granovetter as “the strength of weak ties”7,45, according to which
a weak tie (in our case a weak node, i.e., low degree, in the NAc)
becomes a crucial bridge (a shortcut) between the densely knit
clumps of close friends (the HC, NAc, and PFC). The average map
of these two categories is shown in Fig. 3e (hub centric: hub-KC-
EC-CC-map) and Fig. 3f (weak-node centric: CI-BC-map). In the
Supplementary Note 7, we present the degree distribution of the
CI nodes, across animals, and compare it with the distribution of
the hubs. Supplementary Fig. 6 illustrates that most of the top CI
nodes are low-degree nodes.
Overall, this comprehensive network analysis indicates that the
integration among HC, NAc, and PFC triggered by LTP
induction critically depends on the NAc, and not only on the
largest network hubs at the activation site (HC), a fact that had
not previously been recognized. The theory based on weak-node
centralities predicts that the NAc is strategically located in the
memory network, so that inactivating a small number of its nodes
is sufficient to have the largest impact on the global connectivity;
a falsifiable prediction that we test next.

 Targeted inactivation in-vivo in the real brain network. In
order to test these predictions, we repeat the LTP experiment in
an additional five animals, while inhibiting the activity in the NAc
region. The network module identified by the anatomic region in
the NAc contains 33 nodes in a typical rat, corresponding to a
33 mm3 volume. This activated module includes the NAc core
and shell (which occupies approximately 10 mm3 in the adult rat)
as well as other areas surrounding the NAc. The theoretical
prediction of CI identifies the top influencer around coordinate
2.5 anterior and 1.3 mm lateral from bregma and 7.0 mm ventral
from the cortex surface, in Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas
space37. This location corresponds to a single node in the anterior
half of the NAc shell. The pharmacogenetic intervention infects
an approximate volume of 1 mm3, thus silencing a volume cor-
responding approximately to one to two nodes (voxel volume) in
the brain network structure, which allows specific testing of the
analytical prediction.
We use adenoassociated viruses (AAV) to direct the expression
of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs
(DREADDs)31 into the particular targeted area of the NAc shell
predicted as the top CI node. More specifically, we use the
inhibitory version Gi-DREADD (hM4Di) which, under intra-
peritoneal administration of the otherwise inert ligand clozapine-
N-oxide
(CNO),
activates
the
receptor
inducing
neuronal
silencing and blocking the targeted high-CI node in the NAc
shell. With this experimental design, we acquire fMRI data before
and after administration of CNO, that is, in presence or absence,
respectively, of a functional high-CI node located in the NAc shell
of the network.
We favor the pharmacogenetic approach in this experiment
over an optogenetic strategy because it avoids implanting bilateral
cannula and optic fibers across frontal and/or prefrontal cortical
regions from which we collect and analyze fMRI signals. We
microinject the viruses bilaterally into the NAc and wait for 4 to
6 weeks to allow strong expression of the construct (see Fig. 4a, b
and Supplementary Note 8). Two animals presented infection at
neocortical regions due to leak of viral particles during the
injection procedure and are not considered in further fMRI
analysis. Histological verification demonstrates that viral expres-
sion is restricted to approximately a voxel in the shell part of the
NAc (Fig. 4b). This subregional specificity is most likely produced
by the virus serotype used (AAV5) and gives us the opportunity
to selectively silence nodes in the NAc region receiving most HC
input46.
Before LTP induction, we perform a control experiment to
inactivate the NAc shell. Comparing before and after CNO
administration, (+) and (−) respectively, we find a comparable
fMRI response to low-frequency stimulation in the HC: Both the
fMRI activation maps (Fig. 4e, g) and the amplitude of the fMRI
signals averaged across animals (Fig. 4f, h) are unchanged,
demonstrating that the baseline fMRI response in the HC is not
altered by NAc shell inactivation. Therefore, the input necessary
to drive the formation of the memory network is preserved and
can be used to experimentally test the theoretical predictions.
Using the same animals, we induce LTP in the perforant
pathway as before but, this time, under inactivation of the NAc
shell ((+) CNO). Figure 4i, j shows that, as predicted by the
theory, the formation of the long-range network involving HC,
PFC, and NAc is completely prevented, yet LTP induction still
produces the expected potentiation of the intra-hippocampal
bilateral activation (compare Figs. 4g, h and 4i, j). Remarkably,
long-range inter-network links from the HC to the PFC are not
formed (Fig. 4i, j), even though these sub-networks are not
directly inactivated.
For comparison, the result of LTP induction in animals with a
fully active NAc (animals without DREADD expression, (−)
AAV) is shown in Fig. 4c (fMRI activation map) demonstrating
ipsilateral
and
contralateral
HC
activation
together
with
PFC and NAc in response to the perforant pathway stimulation
(averaged fMRI signal in Fig. 4d). These results demonstrate that
inactivation
of
the
highest
CI
node
in
the
NAc
shell
disrupts the formation of the memory network by selectively
blocking
the
formation
of
LTP-dependent
connections
to
neocortical structures, but not the local potentiation of hippo-
campal synapses.
Control experiments: in-vivo inactivation of brain regions
predicted to have no effect. To further validate these results, we
perform a series of in vivo inactivation experiments targeting
nodes which, based on our model predictions, should have no
major effect on the long-range functional network.
We start with the inactivation of a node in the primary
somatosensory cortex (S1), a brain region outside of HC-PFC-
NAc functional network. Inactivation is first performed using
DREADDs as before, with virus injection targeting the S1 region
(Fig. 5a, see Supplementary Note 8 for details). As shown by the
activation maps and fMRI signals in Fig. 5b, c, S1 inactivation
does not prevent the LTP-induced activation of the HC-PFC-NAc
network. Furthermore, in an additional group of animals we
increased the strength of inactivation in S1 cortex by infusing
0.5 μL of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 100 μM) at the same stereotaxic
coordinates (Fig. 5d). TTX is a sodium channel blocker that
completely blocks neuronal firing at these concentrations (see
Supplementary Note 9 for further details). Still, Fig. 5e, f
demonstrates
HC-PFC-NAc
network
formation
upon
LTP
induction in these conditions.
Inactivation of the HC ipsilateral to the stimulation site would
trivially eliminate the long-range network preventing its initial
activation. We therefore tested whether inactivation of the
contralateral HC nodes, identified by our model as non-
essential nodes for global integration, would preserve network
formation. As for S1 cortex, we used DREADDs (Fig. 5g) and
TTX (Fig. 5j) in separate experiments to assure strong and wide
inactivation of the contralateral HC (see Supplementary Notes 8
and 9, for details). The results with both manipulations verify our
model prediction by showing successful LTP-induced formation
of a long-range HC-PFC-NAc network under contralateral HC
inactivation (Fig. 5h, i, k, l). Note that TTX injection prevents the
activation of the complete contralateral HC, involving a large
number of network nodes but nonetheless, the long-range
network is preserved.
In our final control experiment, we targeted the DREADD
inactivation to the anterior part of the PFC (Fig. 5m), a central
part of the long-range network for which our model predicts low
impact on global integration. TTX is not used for this target
because the close proximity of the NAc and the diffusion of the
TTX solution after injection cannot exclude direct inactivation of
the NAc (and vice versa). However, the pharmacogenetic
manipulation was enough to inactivate the PFC as demonstrated
in the fMRI activation map and corresponding BOLD signals
(Fig. 5n, o). Most importantly, under PFC inactivation, LTP
successfully recruits the long-range HC-NAc network.
Between-groups statistical comparison (Fig. 6, see caption for
statistics) demonstrates that only NAc inactivation promotes the
complete disintegration of the LTP-induced HC-PFC-NAc net-
work, while PFC targeting only produces the expected inactiva-
tion
of
the
PFC
and
control
S1,
and
contralateral
HC
inactivations preserve the complete long-range integrated net-
work. Overall, these results lend strong support to the predictive
validity of the model and the key role of the NAc in the LTP-
induced long-range functional network.

 Network analysis of the resting-state dynamics. As already
indicated, the formation of the HC-PFC-NAc network is
contingent on LTP induction. Accordingly, prior to LTP
induction, the low-frequency stimulus that probes network
function exclusively activates the HC, but neither PFC nor NAc
are activated and, therefore, the relevance of these structures in
the PRE-LTP condition cannot be studied during hippocampal
stimulation.
To shed light on the role of these brain areas before LTP
induction, we analyze resting-state fMRI data. From the fMRI
signal prior to LTP, and in the absence of the low-frequency
probing stimulus, we build a resting-state brain network for each
of the six animals, by using the same network construction
procedures as before. We then use CI centrality to rank the nodes
according to their importance for brain integration, as we did for
the LTP-induced functional network. Further details on the
procedure are discussed in Supplementary Note 5 and an
averaged CI-map over the six rats is shown in Supplementary
Fig. 4. These findings should be compared with Fig. 2h which
presents the same type of results for the functional network
induced by LTP.
The outcomes illustrate that, the NAc does not always play an
essential integrative role. On the contrary, the importance of the
NAc arises here as a result of LTP induction. In contrast, during
resting state dynamics, nodes with high CI are distributed among
different brain areas (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, the
integrative role of the NAc is specifically related to synaptic
plasticity in the memory network.
Caveat on the methodology: from undirected to directed brain
networks. Key to our reasoning is that integrating information of
specialized local modules into a global network is crucial for brain
function. So far, this integration was modeled and measured as

 long-range correlated fMRI activity. However, these correlations
do not necessarily measure direct interactions between neural
populations through fibers, the so-called structural network.
Some correlations may result from indirect covariations that do
not reflect direct communication between nodes. To minimize
effects due to this indirect covariations (i.e., high correlations
between two nodes that are indirect since they do not come from
a direct fiber structural connection between the nodes), we use a
statistical approach (glasso)38 which attempts to explain the
observed correlations as result of pairwise interactions. However,
this model assumes undirected (symmetric) interactions. Mea-
suring information exchange, on the other hand, needs a poten-

excludes
some

correlation, e.g., Granger Causality47, which result in directed

our results are robust when directed

 voxels in the HC-PFC-NAc network, we determined connectivity
as before (Sec. 2) and, in addition, we measured Granger causality
to determine the direction of the link. The final wiring of this
directed network graph for each animal is different from the
wiring of the undirected network (see Sec. 2). Remarkably, by
computing the CI centrality on these directed networks (see Sec. 2
and Supplementary Note 6 for details), the main results regarding
the location of the influential nodes is preserved: most influential
nodes are located in the NAc and they are low-degree nodes, see
Supplementary Fig. 5 in Supplementary Note 6. These results
further strengthen our previous findings on the role of the NAc in
the HC-PFC-NAc integration.
Discussion
While a fundamental role of the NAc in the meso-cortico-limbic
system has long been recognized, including for memory48–50, our
results suggest a new role for the NAc function in this system.
The NAc receives major excitatory inputs from PFC and HC and
dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
among others46,50. These anatomical, but also neurophysiological
and behavioral, evidences49,50 have favored the view of the NAc
as a downstream station in this circuit, working as a limbic-motor
interface with a role in selecting behaviorally relevant actions51.
Human and animal studies further indicate that in addition to
performing on-line processing for action selection, the NAc
encodes the output of the selected action (positive or negative
relative to expectation) into memory, which in turn will condition
future selections49,50. In this context, however, our network
analysis locates the NAc upstream in the circuit, showing that
interactions between the HC and PFC induced by LTP are already
under the control of the NAc. Being the interaction between these
two structures key for memory formation, we interpret our results
as indicative of a NAc-operated gating mechanism that couples
HC-PFC networks for the storage of new information, providing
a mechanism for updating memories to guide future behaviors.
This mechanism would fundamentally differ from, but being
compatible with, previous ideas on information flow between HC,
PFC, and NAc networks52 in that the control here is exerted
bottom-up from the NAc. While the precise mechanism for this
control switch has not been investigated in the present work, an
appealing possibility is the regulation of neuronal excitability in
the VTA by projections of the NAc shell through the ventral
pallidum48. In turn, dopamine release from VTA terminals in the
HC and neocortex would promote synaptic plasticity and facil-
itate integration in a consolidated memory brain network.
Regardless of the specific microcircuit, in this network-driven
theory, NAc computations seem to be a necessary part of
hippocampal-dependent memories.
The experimental model used in this work leverages the
induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus, which leads to a large-scale
network that we could perturb prospectively. The experimental
finding highlights the importance of considering the entire net-
work associated with each node. Network hubs, defined solely by
the number of direct connections, are not necessarily the most
effective at channeling information through the entire network.
This role may be reserved for essential nodes that connect dif-
ferent communities to each other53. The CI centrality used here
accounts for the role of nodes in connecting different brain areas
to one another24. Thus, this approach extends beyond the direct
effects of hubs at integrating brain networks.
This result has important implications for the numerous
investigations on brain pathology searching for critical alterations
in functional connectivity as disease diagnostic and/or prognostic
biomarkers. A combination of optimal percolation theory and
experimental test presented here can be potentially adapted to
networks that do not depend on LTP induction for their for-
mation, thus providing a recipe to design intervention protocols
to manipulate a wider range of brain states. These may include9:
(i) transcranial magnetic stimulation that can stimulate or deac-
tivate focal brain activity, (ii) assist in targeting deep brain sti-
mulation devices, in particular, for disorders that are thought to
be the result of network dysfunctions, and (iii) guiding brain
tumor surgery by identifying essential areas to be avoided during
the resection. The basic hypothesis is that activation/deactivation
patterns applied to the influential nodes will propagate through
the brain to impact global network dynamics. The proposed
theoretical analysis provides a possible road map on how to
establish and test such basic network hypotheses.
To conclude, we mention that our analysis was based only on
correlation structure of evoked fMRI. Future work could study the

Fig. 6 Group analysis of network inactivation. The number of nodes in the relevant networks is quantified after LTP induction with or without targeted
inactivation and normalized relative to the control, fully active, condition. a Proportion of nodes recruited by perforant pathway stimulation in the ipsilateral
HC under control conditions (100%) and after inactivation of the NAc, PFC, contralateral HC (cHC), and S1, as indicated in the x-axis. Analysis of variance
across groups demonstrates no statistical differences (ANOVA, F4,24 = 0.3641, p = 0.8317). b Proportion of nodes recruited in the NAc following targeted
inactivation in the structures indicated in the x-axis. ANOVA demonstrates statistically significant differences between groups (F4,24 = 4.841, p = 0.0053)
and post-hoc Bonferroni test finds the only significant difference in NAc recruitment when the NAc is directly inactivated (p < 0.01), as expected from the
experimental manipulation, but no effect under PFC, cHC, or S1 inactivation. c Proportion of nodes recruited in the PFC following targeted inactivation in the
structures indicated in the x-axis. ANOVA demonstrates statistically significant differences between groups (F4,24 = 6.416, p = 0.0012) and post-hoc
Bonferroni test identifies strong reductions in both PFC (p < 0.01), expected from the experimental manipulation, but also NAc (p < 0.05), indicating the
disintegration of the long-range HC-PFC-NAc network under NAc inactivation

 network structure and the role of node’s degree in connectome
data54,55. It would be important to compare the role of hubs, weak
nodes, and nodes connecting different modules in structural brain
networks with their role in functional networks. Such investiga-
tions, together with those presented in this work, are of crucial
importance for diagnostic and clinical intervention in the brain.
