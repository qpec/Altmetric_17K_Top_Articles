Abstract
Background—Previous studies noted associations between birth defects and some antibiotics 
(e.g., nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides) but not others (e.g., penicillins). It is unclear if previous 
findings were due to antibiotic use, infections, or chance. To control for potential confounding by 
indication, we examined associations between antibiotic use and birth defects, among women 
reporting urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Methods—The National Birth Defects Prevention Study is a multi-site, population-based case-
control study. Case infants/fetuses have any of over 30 major birth defects and controls are live-
born infants without major birth defects. We analyzed pregnancies from 1997 to 2011 to estimate 
the association between maternally reported periconceptional (month before conception through 
the third month of pregnancy) use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or 
cephalosporins and specific birth defects, among women with periconceptional UTIs. Women with 
periconceptional UTIs who reported penicillin use served as the comparator.
Results—Periconceptional UTIs were reported by 7.8% (2029/26,068) of case and 6.7% 
(686/10,198) of control mothers. Most (68.2% of case, 66.6% of control mothers) also reported 
antibiotic use. Among 608 case and 231 control mothers reporting at least one periconceptional 
UTI and certain antibiotic use, compared with penicillin, nitrofurantoin use was associated with 
oral clefts in the offspring (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97 [95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.53]), 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use with esophageal atresia (5.31 [1.39–20.24]) and diaphragmatic

 hernia (5.09 [1.20–21.69]), and cephalosporin use with anorectal atresia/stenosis (5.01 [1.34–
18.76]).
Conclusion—Periconceptional exposure to some antibiotics might increase the risk for certain 
birth defects. However, because individual birth defects are rare, absolute risks should drive 
treatment decisions.

Introduction
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections in pregnancy; 1 to 4% of 
pregnant women experience acute cystitis and 4 to 10% have asymptomatic bacteriuria 
(Foxman, 2002). If left untreated, UTIs can progress to pyelonephritis, which has been 
associated with preterm labor and low birth weight (Delzell and Lefevre, 2000). Even 
uncomplicated UTIs have been associated with intrauterine growth restriction and preterm 
labor, and maternal UTIs have been associated with early onset sepsis and UTIs in the 
neonate (Schieve et al., 1994; Bhutta and Yusuf, 1997; Delzell and Lefevre, 2000; 
Emamghorashi et al., 2012). To prevent these adverse pregnancy outcomes, pregnant women 
are screened for UTIs during early pregnancy while in prenatal care (U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force, 2008).
According to Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, nonpregnant women with 
uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(Gupta et al., 2011). However, Crider and colleagues’ analysis of 1997 to 2003 National 
Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) data raised concern that these commonly 
prescribed antibiotic treatments for UTIs might be associated with specific birth defects 
(Crider et al., 2009). In 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
(ACOG) issued a Committee Opinion stating that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin can be 
prescribed in the first trimester of pregnancy if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed 
inappropriate (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on 
Obstetric Practice, 2011).
More recent epidemiologic studies have found trimethoprim to be associated with both 
miscarriage and birth defects, but trimethoprim-sulfonamides not to be associated with birth 
defects (Andersen et al., 2013a, 2013b; Hansen et al., 2016). Subsequent studies of 
nitrofurantoin use in pregnancy have not found it to be associated with birth defects, 
although these studies may have been underpowered to detect associations with specific 
birth defect types (Goldberg et al., 2013; Nordeng et al., 2013). Despite rising rates of 
antibiotic resistance in some geographic areas (Mazzulli, 2012), penicillins are still 
frequently used to treat UTIs in pregnant women (Car, 2006; Petersen et al., 2010), likely 
because of their purported relative safety (Crider et al., 2009).

 Previous studies have typically examined the association of antibiotic classes with specific 
birth defects regardless of indication (Crider et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2013b; Goldberg 
et al., 2013; Nordeng et al., 2013). However, a potential confounding factor in these studies 
is the indication for antibiotic use, as maternal urinary tract, genital, and sexually transmitted 
infections have been associated with birth defects in previous studies (Cleves et al., 2008; 
Feldkamp et al., 2008). To minimize confounding by indication, we examined the 
association between maternally reported periconceptional antibiotic use and birth defects, 
among women with UTIs, using 1997 to 2011 NBDPS data, by comparing the odds of birth 
defects among women reporting periconceptional nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, or cephalosporin use to women reporting periconceptional penicillin use.
Materials and Methods
NBDPS
The NBDPS is a population-based, multi-site, case–control study of risk factors for select 
major birth defects (Reefhuis et al., 2015). Our analysis included case and control infants or 
fetuses born on or after October 1, 1997, with estimated dates of delivery (EDD) on or 
before December 31, 2011. Cases included infants/fetuses with 1 of more than 30 major 
birth defects identified through birth defects surveillance systems in the states of Arkansas 
(1998–2011), Iowa, New Jersey (1998–2002), and Utah (2003–2011), or select counties in 
California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina (2003–2011), New York, and Texas. 
Cases were live-born infants (all sites), stillbirths of ≥20 weeks gestation (nine sites), and 
elective terminations (eight sites). Infants/fetuses with major chromosomal abnormalities, 
single-gene disorders, and birth defects with known etiology were excluded. Controls were 
live-born infants without major birth defects selected annually from vital or hospital 
discharge records from the same catchment areas as case infants/fetuses.
Case and control mothers were interviewed by telephone in English or Spanish using a 
computer-based questionnaire 6 weeks to 24 months after the EDD. Information was 
obtained on maternal demographics; nutritional, behavioral, and occupational exposures; 
maternal disease including infections; and over-the-counter and prescription medications, 
vitamins, and supplements. Clinical data regarding the birth defects were abstracted from 
medical records, and birth defects were classified by clinicians and clinical geneticists using 
previously described NBDPS classification criteria (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Botto et al., 
2007). During 1997 to 2011, the participation rate was 67% for case mothers and 64% for 
control mothers. All subjects consented to participation and the NBDPS was approved by 
the Institutional Review Boards at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and all 
participating institutions.
EXPOSURE DEFINITION
During the structured interview, women were asked whether they experienced any of the 
following: a kidney, bladder, or UTI from 3 months before conception through the end of 
pregnancy. Subsequent questions ascertained whether the infection was diagnosed by a 
doctor, when the infection occurred (pregnancy month[s] or trimester[s]), any over-the-
counter and prescription medication(s) taken for the infection, and the name, dates taken,

 duration, and frequency of medication(s) used. Later in the questionnaire, women were 
asked if they took any medications not already discussed and to provide the name, dates 
taken, duration, and frequency of use, although not the specific indication for use.
Exposure was defined as maternal report of any antibiotic use in the periconceptional period 
(defined as the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy). Medications 
were coded using the Slone Drug Dictionary (Boston University), collapsing specific 
antibiotics into their respective antibiotic classes (Werler et al., 2011). We created mutually 
exclusive categories of antibiotics: penicillin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, or cephalosporins, as well as other, unknown or use of multiple 
antibiotics. Women reporting a periconceptional doctor-diagnosed UTI but no 
periconceptional use of oral antibiotics, including those using only topical antibiotics or 
another type of oral anti-infective medication (e.g., antivirals, antifungals), were excluded.
ANALYSES
We excluded women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, multiple or missing number of 
gestations, pelvic inflammatory disease, fever during the month before conception through 
the third month of pregnancy, missing UTI information, UTIs not diagnosed by a doctor, and 
missing antibiotic exposure dates (Fig. 1). We restricted our analysis of the association 
between specific antibiotics and birth defects to defect types with at least 100 total or at least 
four exposed and four unexposed cases to the four specific antibiotic classes under 
investigation (penicillins, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 
cephalosporins). Due to limited sample sizes or interpretability, we did not assess other 
antibiotics, multiple antibiotics or unknown types of antibiotics and birth defects 
associations. We selected potential covariates because of their association with birth defects 
in previous studies. These included: maternal age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white vs. 
other), education (<high school vs. ≥high school), prepregnancy body mass index (body 
mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 vs. < 30 kg/m2), use of any folic acid supplements in the month 
before through the first month of pregnancy, periconceptional smoking, periconceptional 
alcohol use, EDD year (1997–2003, 2004–2011), time from EDD to interview (≤ 6 months, 
7–12 months, 13–24 months), and NBDPS study site.
We constructed multivariable conditional logistic regression models to estimate adjusted 
odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We matched on NBDPS study 
site, and among the covariates of interest noted above, adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity 
and body mass index because these factors varied across antibiotic exposures among control 
mothers (Table 1). Given the potentially serious consequences of untreated UTIs in 
pregnancy, a comparison population of women with UTIs unexposed to antibiotics would be 
inappropriate. Thus, to have a disease-matched comparison group, our comparator was 
women with penicillin-treated periconceptional UTIs, given the relative lack of associations 
between penicillin and birth defects (Crider et al., 2009). This approach has been used in 
other studies (Berkovitch et al., 2000; Hansen et al., 2016). We performed one post hoc 
sensitivity analysis: we removed any cases or controls with a first degree family member 
(i.e., mother, father, full sibling, or previous pregnancy) with a type of birth defect 
ascertained in NBDPS.

 Results
Periconceptional UTIs were common: 7.8% (2029/26,068) of case and 6.7% (686/10,198) of 
control mothers reported having at least one doctor-diagnosed, fever-free UTI in the month 
before conception through the third month of pregnancy. The majority (68.2% of case, 
66.6% of control mothers) also reported taking an antibiotic (Fig. 1). The most commonly 
reported antibiotics used periconceptionally were penicillins and nitrofurantoin; however, 
more than one-quarter of women could not recall the specific antibiotic taken (Fig. 2). 
Comparing the early (1997–2003) and later (2004–2011) eras of the NBDPS, “other” 
antibiotics accounted for a greater proportion of use in the latter period of the study among 
both case and control mothers.
To determine which potential confounders were associated with exposure, we compared 
potential confounders between control mothers with and without the relevant exposure (i.e., 
compared women with UTIs and use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or 
cephalosporin antibiotics periconceptionally to women with UTIs and penicillin antibiotic 
use periconceptionally). Factors significantly associated with periconceptional 
nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or cephalosporin use rather than penicillin 
use among control mothers with UTIs included maternal race/ethnicity and body mass index 
(Table 1).
After restricting to phenotypes with at least 100 total, or 4 exposed and 4 “unexposed” (i.e., 
penicillin-exposed) cases, 608 cases and 231 control mothers with periconceptional UTIs 
and penicillin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or cephalosporin antibiotic 
use were eligible for analysis (Fig. 1). Compared with women with UTIs and penicillin use 
periconceptionally, women with periconceptional UTIs and nitrofurantoin use had 
significantly greater odds of having offspring with oral clefts (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97 [95% 
confidence interval, 1.10– 3.53]) and borderline significant for the subtype of cleft lip with 
or without cleft palate (1.90 [1.00–3.63]), in particular (Table 2). Those reporting UTIs and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use periconceptionally had significantly greater odds of 
having offspring with esophageal atresia (5.31 [1.39–20.24]) and diaphragmatic hernia (5.09 
[1.20–21.69]; and those reporting cephalosporin use had significantly greater odds of having 
offspring with anorectal atresia/stenosis (5.01 [1.34–18.76]). Results from the posthoc 
analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis. Exclusion of the 23 cases and 7 
controls with a first degree family member with a birth defect type ascertained in NBDPS 
tended to strengthen the associations observed in the primary analysis and the association 
between cephalosporins and cleft lip with or without cleft palate became significant (5.67 
[1.67–18.76]; other data not shown).
Discussion
Reports of UTIs in early pregnancy were common; 8% of case and 7% of control mothers 
reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of 
pregnancy. To minimize potential confounding by indication, we restricted our analysis to 
women reporting fever-free, doctor-diagnosed UTIs, and antibiotic use periconceptionally. 
Overall, compared with women reporting penicillin use, we found significant associations

 between periconceptional use of nitrofurantoin and cleft lip with or without cleft palate; 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and esophageal atresia and diaphragmatic hernia; and 
cephalosporins and anorectal atresia. These associations persisted in a sensitivity analysis 
excluding cases and controls with a family history of birth defects.
Among women with UTIs, periconceptional nitrofurantoin exposure was more commonly 
reported than penicillin use by mothers of infants/fetuses with cleft lip with or without cleft 
palate. Previous studies have noted associations for nitrofurantoin with cleft palate, rectal/
anal atresia/stenosis, NTDs, nonchromosomal heart defects, and a borderline significant 
association with hypospadias (Czeizel et al., 2001a; Kallen and Otterblad Olausson, 2003). 
Two previous retrospective cohort studies did not find associations between nitrofurantoin 
and major malformations, cardiac defects, or cleft lip or palate, although their samples sizes 
may have limited their ability to detect significant associations (Goldberg et al., 2013; 
Nordeng et al., 2013).
Among women with a UTI, periconceptional trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exposure was 
more commonly reported than penicillin use by mothers of infants/ fetuses with esophageal 
atresia and with diaphragmatic hernia. Trimethoprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor 
that interferes with DNA synthesis (Schweitzer et al., 1990). A randomized clinical trial 
found significantly lower levels of serum folate among a sample of healthy men taking a 
seven day course of trimethoprim compared with those taking placebo (Meidahl Petersen et 
al., 2016). Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor use in early pregnancy has also been associated 
with a variety of reproductive outcomes, including miscarriage and selected birth defects 
(Andersen et al., 2013a, 2013b; Hernandez-Diaz et al., 2000, 2001). Using data from 1976 to 
1998, Hernandez-Diaz et al. (2001) showed that the association between dihydrofolate 
reductase inhibitors and NTDs diminished with increasing folic acid supplement use 
(Hernandez-Diaz et al., 2001).
In our study, when compared with women reporting periconceptional penicillin use, women 
reporting cephalosporin use periconceptionally had significantly elevated odds for anorectal 
atresia/stenosis. Few published studies describe the associations between cephalosporins and 
birth defects. An unpublished analysis of Michigan Medicaid data from 1985 to 1992 
showed higher than expected numbers of congenital defects, including heart defects, among 
approximately 4000 women taking cephalosporins during their first trimester (Briggs et al., 
2011). A larger Hungarian case–control study again found no association with major 
malformations overall but did find a significantly elevated association with cardiac defects 
(Czeizel et al., 2001b).
It is worth noting that we saw several additional elevated but nonsignificant associations. Of 
the 18 birth defects with calculable odds ratios for nitrofurantoin, there were an additional 
four elevated (adjusted odds ratio > 1.50) associations: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, cleft 
palate, esophageal atresia, and craniosynostosis. For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, of the 
16 birth defects with calculable odds ratios, there were an additional eight nonsignificantly 
elevated odds ratios for coarctation of the aorta, neural tube defects, oral clefts overall as 
well as the specific subtypes of cleft palate and cleft lip with and without cleft palate, 
anorectal atresia/stenosis, and limb deficiency, including the subtype of transverse limb

 deficiency. For cephalosporins, there were nine calculable odds ratio; nonsignificantly 
elevated odds ratios were observed for pulmonary valve stenosis, perimembranous 
ventricular septal defects, neural tube defects overall, and the subtype of spina bifida, and 
oral clefts overall, as well as the subtype of cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Only three 
“protective” odds ratios (adjusted odds ratio < 0.66) were observed: two for nitrofurantoin 
(with coarctation of the aorta and gastroschisis) and one for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(with gastroschisis).
A major limitation of our analysis is the potential for exposure misclassification because of 
maternal self-report of both UTIs and antibiotic exposure, ascertained 6 weeks to 2 years 
after the EDD, with no verification from other sources (e.g., medical or pharmacy records). 
To minimize misclassification of UTI status, we restricted our analysis to women reporting 
doctor-diagnosed infections. Antibiotic information was more problematic; close to one-
quarter of women could not recall the name of the antibiotic taken. We included medication 
exposures reported in the month before conception in addition to those in the first trimester 
of pregnancy to allow for the potential misclassification of timing of antibiotic use. Recall of 
medication timing is often better for short-term use, the circumstance for most of our 
antibiotic exposures, and is also improved when women are prompted with specific 
medication names, a feature of our study as well (Mitchell et al., 1986; Radin et al., 2013). 
Finally, while indication for antibiotic use was not available for all women in our study, 96% 
of case and 97% of control mothers with periconceptional UTIs indicated that their UTI was 
the indication for their antibiotic use.
There are several considerations in the interpretation of our findings. First, because some 
birth defects had elevated odds ratios for multiple antibiotic classes, it remains possible that 
confounding by indication still impacted our results due to lack of additional information on 
UTI severity, the specific type of infection (as women could have had either a kidney, 
bladder, or UTI), and the bacterial etiology of the UTI. Second, given the large number (n = 
43) of associations examined, multiple comparisons might have impacted our results 
because approximately two statistically significant associations would be expected by 
chance alone; however, we do not know which of the four associations we observed are 
more likely to be due to chance alone. Third, although using conditional logistic regression 
allowed us to account for differences by NBDPS study site, this modeling method has been 
shown to potentially lead to biased estimates (Greenland et al., 2000). Fourth, by only 
including information from women for whom information was available, we assumed the 
missing information was missing completely at random and, therefore, the impact of 
informative missingness on our results is unknown.
Strengths of this study include the use of multi-site, population-based data with stringent 
birth defect classification criteria. Clinical geneticists or pediatric cardiology specialists 
familiar with the diagnosis of birth defects reviewed all potential NBDPS cases and 
confirmed that they met study eligibility requirements (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Botto et al., 
2007). The study’s large size also allowed for the assessment of associations between 
specific antibiotic exposures and more refined categories of birth defects. Furthermore, our 
study size and design allowed us to minimize potential confounding by indication, by 
Ailes et al.

 restricting our primary analysis to case and control mothers reporting UTIs 
periconceptionally.
Our findings support continued caution with periconceptional use of trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and nitrofurantoin. However, the body of literature on the 
topic of maternal antibiotic use and birth defects is limited and has not produced consistent 
findings. Furthermore, the birth defects found to be associated with antibiotics in this study 
(cleft lip with or without cleft palate, esophageal atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, and anorectal 
atresia/stenosis) are rare, with a birth prevalence of approximately 0.99%, 0.22%, 0.27%, 
and 0.41%, respectively, reported by active birth defects surveillance programs during the 
period 2008 to 2012 (Mai et al., 2015). By comparison, nearly 1 in 10 women experience a 
UTI during early pregnancy and as the maternal and fetal complications associated with 
untreated UTIs are common and serious, women should seek treatment if they suspect they 
might have a UTI. Therefore, although some of the associations observed in this study were 
relatively strong, it is important to note that individual birth defects are rare, and potential 
absolute risks of birth defects associated with antibiotic use remain small (~ 1%) compared 
with the risks of complications due to untreated UTIs in pregnancy.

cAs pulmonary valve stenosis, and oral cleft cases were only ascertained by a subset of study sites in certain years, and hypospadias cases were only male fetus/infants, controls for these analyses were 
similarly restricted. For pulmonary valve stenosis, there were a total of 222 controls, of which 115 reported penicillin exposure in the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, 59 
nitrofurantoin, 28 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 20 cephalosporins. For oral clefts, there were a total of 229 controls, of which 120 reported penicillin exposure in the month before conception 
through the third month of pregnancy, 59 nitrofurantoin, 29 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 21 cephalosporins. For hypospadias, there were a total of 131 controls, of which 65 reported penicillin 
exposure in the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, 39 nitrofurantoin, 16 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 11 cephalosporins.
