BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation-based therapies are standard management options for men with clinically localized
high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Contemporary patterns of care are unknown. We hypothesize the use of surgery has steadily
increased in more recent years.
METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base for 2004–2013, all men diagnosed with high-risk localized PCa were identified
using National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Temporal trends in initial management were assessed. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).
RESULTS: In total, 127 391 men were identified. Use of RP increased from 26% in 2004 to 42% in 2013 (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.51,
95% CI 1.42–1.60, Po0.001), while external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) decreased from 49% to 42% (Po0.001). African
American men had lower odds of undergoing RP (unadjusted rate of 28%, adjusted RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66–0.72, o0.001) compared
to White men (37%). Age was inversely associated with likelihood of receiving RP. Having private insurance was significantly
associated with the increased use of RP (vs Medicare, adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.08, P = 0.015). Biopsy Gleason scores
8–10 with and without any primary Gleason 5 pattern were associated with decreased odds of RP (vs Gleason score ⩽ 6, both
Po0.001). Academic and comprehensive cancer centers were more likely to perform RP compared to community hospitals
(both Po0.001).
CONCLUSION: The likelihood of receiving RP for high-risk PCa dramatically increased from 2004 to 2013. By 2013, the use
of RP and EBRT were similar. African American men, elderly men and those without private insurance were less likely to
receive RP.

INTRODUCTION
Over 180 000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) in
the United States in 2016.1 Approximately one-third with localized
PCa are ‘high-risk’ based on National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) criteria.2 As the population ages and use of
screening declines following the 2011 United States Preventive
Services Task Force recommendation,3,4 it is possible that high-risk
cancers will comprise a greater proportion of the future PCa
diagnoses.5
Practice guidelines recommend either radiation with androgen
deprivation or radical prostatectomy (RP) as the initial treatment
strategy for men with high-risk cancers.2,6 For men with a
reasonable estimated life expectancy, local therapy is favored
over a systemic approach or observation.7–9
Recently, findings from multiple non-randomized comparative
studies have suggested a survival benefit for men with high-risk
PCa who received RP compared to external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT).10–13 We hypothesized the use of surgery has
increased in recent years. As such, the objectives of our study were
to: (1) evaluate temporal trends in the initial treatment of clinically
localized high-risk PCa and (2) determine demographic and
clinical factors associated with RP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and patient population
Our cohort was derived from a hospital-based cancer registry, the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB) from 2004–2013. The NCDB captures data on
70% of cancer diagnoses in the United States from 41400 hospitals with
cancer programs accredited by the American College of Surgeons’
Commission on Cancer (CoC) and American Cancer Society.14
All men diagnosed with localized PCa from 2004 to 2013 (n = 1 065 906;
Supplementary Figure S1) were identified. The NCDB collects data from
reporting institutions based on CoC-accreditation status, which may
change on a yearly basis. Only facilities that contributed at least one
patient during each study year were included, hence, temporal changes in
the management were not biased by institutional participation.
We excluded men with incomplete data for NCCN risk stratification
(Gleason grade, clinical T stage and pre-treatment PSA) (n = 278 089). Prior
to 2010, the NCDB recorded Gleason score solely from the largest
histologic specimen available. For example, if a patient received RP, this
would supplant the previously documented prostate needle biopsy
Gleason score. For consistency, from 2010–2013 we included Gleason
score as a variable in a similar manner. We performed our sensitivity
analysis with RP usage on patients diagnosed in 2010 through 2013
using biopsy Gleason score to determine high-risk status (n = 46 518;
Supplementary Figure S1) and biopsy Gleason score as an indep-
endent variable.

 Clinical T stage was available for the entire study period. The NCDB uses
the most updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer
Staging Manual edition during each year of diagnosis. Thus, prior to 2009,
the 6th and 7th edition was used in the following years. There were no
changes between the two that affected our clinical staging.15
We defined high-risk PCa using the 2016 NCCN risk stratification criteria:
pre-treatment PSA 420 ng ml–1, Gleason 8–10 or cT3-4.2 We excluded
men with low- or intermediate-risk PCa (n = 626 758), PSA 450 ng ml–1
(n = 25 607), missing treatment data (n = 3 986) or missing demographic
information (n = 4 075; Supplementary Figure S1). Men with a PSA
450 ng ml–1 were excluded due to a high clinical suspicion of metastatic
disease and their exclusion from previous RP clinical trials.7,16
Variables definition
Covariates included facility type, facility geographic location, patient
comorbidities (Deyo–Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)17) and insurance
type. Facility type is based on CoC accreditation and is determined by the
annual number of cancer patients a facility encounters and graduate
medical education participation.18
Income was categorized into quartiles according to median household
income for each patient’s zip code. Education attainment was categorized
as the proportion of adults in a patient’s zip code who did not obtain at
least a high school education. Income and education were derived from
the 2012 American Community Survey data spanning 2008–2012 and
divided into quartiles. Race and ethnicity were used to create a composite
variable
categorized
as
non-Hispanic
White,
non-Hispanic
African
American, Hispanic and other/unknown.
Distance between a patient and their treating facility was estimated
based on the distance between the zip code of the patient’s residence and
the facility and was categorized as o60, 60–120 and 4120 miles. Each
patient’s county of residence was defined based on a 2013 population as
metropolitan (4249 999) or urban/rural (o250 000). Age and the log of
pre-treatment PSA were analyzed as continuous variables.
Outcomes definition
Our primary outcome was initial treatment: RP, radiation or primary ADT.
Primary RP was defined as RP performed within 1 year of diagnosis with or
without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Radiation-based therapies
were divided into four categories: EBRT without ADT, EBRT with ADT, EBRT
and brachytherapy with or without ADT, and brachytherapy with or
without ADT. If RP and a radiation-based therapy were both used within 1
year of diagnosis, the initial treatment was defined as the treatment
performed first. Primary ADT was defined as ADT initiated within 1 year of
diagnosis and no RP or radiation-based therapy. No treatment was defined
as no treatment was performed within 1 year of diagnosis.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s χ2 tests including
changes in initial treatment between the years 2004 and 2013. The Mann–
Whitney U-test was used to compare non-parametric continuous data.
Modified Poisson regressions19 were used to evaluate the association of
covariates with RP use among men with high-risk PCa. To account for
variability
between
treatment
facilities
(n = 1087),
we
adjusted
for
clustering of patients within treatment facilities.20 Adjusted risk ratio (RR)
was calculated in this manner. Using Kaplan–Meier analyses, log rank tests
and Cox proportional hazards, we assessed the effect of treatment on
overall survival. For all analyses, tests were two-tailed, o0.05 was
considered significant and Stata 13.0 (College Station, TX) was used.
Institutional review board deemed our study exempt from approval due to
use of de-identified, retrospective patient data.
RESULTS
Temporal trends in initial management of high-risk localized
prostate cancer
Our final cohort included 127 391 men with high-risk localized PCa

Among all patients, use of EBRT with any combination of
additional treatment was 44% overall (Supplementary Table S2).
EBRT usage decreased from 49% (11% EBRT alone, 29% with ADT
and 9% with brachytherapy) in 2004 to 41% (8% EBRT alone, 29%

 with ADT and 4% with brachytherapy) in 2013 (Po0.001;
Figure 2). Brachytherapy use fell from 16% in 2004 (9% with EBRT
and 7% without EBRT) to 6% (4% with EBRT and 2% without EBRT)
in 2013 (Po0.001).
Demographic and clinical factors associated with radical
prostatectomy use
The odds of receiving RP increased greatly from 2004 to 2013
(26–42%: RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42–1.60 Po0.001; Tables 1 and 2).
Each category of PSA 44.0 ng ml–1 was associated with decreased
likelihood of RP. In total, 42% of men with PSA 0.1–4.0 ng ml–1
received RP whereas only 29% of men with PSA420 ng ml–1
received RP (Continuous as log of PSA RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.83–0.85,
Po0.001).
Patients with Gleason score 3+4 (43%) and 4+3 (39%) had
higher likelihood of RP compared to men with Gleason score ⩽ 6
(29%; RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.29–1.41, Po0.001 and RR 1.29, 95% CI
1.22–1.36, Po0.001). Clinical stages cT2 and cT3 were associated
with decreased likelihood of RP compared to cT1 (both Po0.001).
Other covariates associated with increased likelihood of RP
included private insurance (vs Medicare, RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.08,
P = 0.015)
and
receiving treatment
at a comprehensive
or
academic facility (vs community, RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21–1.50,
Po0.001 and RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.38–1.74, Po0.001, respectively).
Overall, 88% of RP’s occurred at comprehensive or academic
facilities (Table 1). In addition, living 460 miles from the
treatment center greatly increased the odds of RP (60–120 miles,
RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.28–1.43, Po0.001; 4120 miles, RR 1.29 95% CI,
1.13–1.48 Po0.001).
Covariates associated with decreased odds of RP included
African American race compared to White race (28 and 37%,
respectively; RR 0.69 95%, CI 0.66–0.72, Po0.001; Table 2), older
age, and Medicaid or no insurance compared to having Medicare.
To assess the connection between African American race and
type of treatment facility, we ran our regression again limiting our
analyses to patients treated at academic, and comprehensive
cancer centers. We found the RR were similar to the results of our
main regression (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65–0.74, Po0.001 and 0.68,
95% CI 0.63–0.73, Po0.001, respectively).
Sensitivity analysis
Compared to patients who were excluded based on missing risk
stratification data (n = 278 089), patients with information on
Gleason score, PSA and clinical stage (n = 787 817) were com-
prised of more White patients (73.0 vs 71.5%, Po0.001), were
older (Median (interquartile range): 65 (59–72) vs 65 (59–71),

 Po0.001) and were comprised of more men with a Charlson
comorbidity index of zero (85.2 vs 83.4%, Po0.001).
For the years 2010–2013, 50 288 men in our final cohort had
information available on biopsy Gleason score. Of these, 46 518
(93%) were still considered high-risk by NCCN criteria when using
biopsy Gleason score to risk stratify (Supplementary Figure S1).
Further, we replicated our regression analysis of initial treatment
on these men using biopsy Gleason score as an independent
variable. This analysis (Supplementary Table S3) demonstrated few
qualitative differences to the initial analyses (Table 2). However,
higher clinical stage was no longer associated with decreased RP
usage and Gleason scores 3+4 and 4+3 were no longer associated
with higher RP usage (all P40.05; Supplementary Table S2).
Patients with biopsy Gleason 8–10 with and without any primary
Gleason 5 pattern had significantly lower odds of RP usage (vs
Gleason score ⩽ 6 RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.85, Po0.001 and RR
0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.87, Po0.001, respectively). As an additional
analysis, we assessed patients diagnosed with biopsy Gleason
8–10 disease from 2010–2013 (n = 33 847). There were no
qualitative differences between the multivariable regression
restricted to this cohort and that in Supplementary Table S3.
The odds of RP increased from 2010 to 2013 (RR 1.29, 95% CI
1.19–1.41, Po0.001).
Survival based on treatment
Median (interquartile range) for follow-up was 4.4 (2.6–6.5) years.
Based on Kaplan–Meier analysis, the median overall survival for
men who received no treatment was 8.3 years, EBRT with ADT was
9.9 years and ADT alone was 5.7 years (log rank Po0.001,
Supplementary Figure S2). Median survival was not reached for
men who received RP. The 10-year overall survival for no
treatment was 41%, EBRT with ADT was 49%, ADT alone was
24% and RP was 77%. Using Cox proportional hazards to adjust for
multiple covariates, we assessed the hazards ratio for each
treatment. Compared to RP, no treatment (HR 2.98, 95% CI
2.83–3.15, Po0.001), EBRT with ADT (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53–1.68,
Po0.001) and ADT alone (HR 3.36, 95% CI 3.17–3.56, Po0.001)
were each associated with worse overall survival (Supplementary
Table S4).

term cancer-specific survival in men with high-risk PCa who

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; RP, radical prostatectomy; RR,
risk ratio. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate
the association of covariates with primary radical prostatectomy use
among men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The model was
adjusted for clustering based on treatment facility. In total, 127 391
patients were analyzed.

 receive RP.21,22 Using the NCDB, we demonstrated surgery for men
with high-risk cancer increased significantly from 2004 to 2013,
and by 2013 RP rates were similar to those of EBRT.
The possible reasons for an increase in the use of RP are many.
In the years leading up to our study period, population-based
studies suggested improved cancer-specific survival benefit with
RP compared to radiation.23,24 Although these studies were
limited by their retrospective design and unmeasured variables,
they were likely influential on patients and physicians.25 Early in
the study period, more population-based data continued to
suggest a survival benefit for RP over radiation for men with high-
risk
disease,
although
all
studies
had
varying
degrees
of
methodological limitations.26–28 Our analysis of overall survival
in the NCDB also demonstrated a survival benefit with RP,
although our retrospective analysis was subject to selection bias.
The decision of optimal management depends on the maturation
of prospective randomized data.29
An analysis of a registry of 45 urology practices in the United
States showed a similar increase in RP for men with high-risk PCa
from ~ 25% during 2005–2009 to ~ 50% during 2010–2013.30 This
study likely demonstrated higher rates of RP due to its registry
being composed of several types of urology practices while the
NCDB is composed of CoC hospitals. Greater than 80% of our
cohort were treated at either an academic or comprehensive
cancer center and we found patients treated at these facilities
were more likely to receive RP compared to men treated at
community hospitals.
Declines were seen in rates of brachytherapy with and without
EBRT. This finding is consistent with a prior NCDB report31 which
included men with all risk categories of prostate cancer, and could
be due to changes in referral patterns related to reimbursement,
advances with alternative therapies or lack of adequate training
experience for brachytherapy. However, early trial results show an
advantage in disease control with brachytherapy boost compared
to EBRT alone for intermediate- and high-risk PCa.32
Use of primary ADT remained relatively low over the study
period. This is encouraging given evidence demonstrating the
superior efficacy of RT with ADT and lack of survival benefit for
primary ADT, especially among high-risk patients in previous
studies.33,34 Although our survival analysis is limited to overall
survival and may be subject to selection bias, data from the NCDB
confirmed worse survival associated with primary ADT.
African American men with high-risk PCa were less likely to
receive RP and instead had higher rates of non-treatment and
radiation therapy. This was observed even after adjusting for
multiple demographic and clinical factors. In addition, even
though use of RP among African American men has increased
over time, the gap of RP usage between African American men
and all patients has also increased. Although these results has
been previously demonstrated in the Surveillance, Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) database,35 there has been very little
evidence to explain why. Interestingly, this treatment disparity was
seen even when we limited our analysis to patients treated at
academic and comprehensive cancer treatment center suggesting
access to high volume centers does not explain the difference in
RP receipt. It is possible these disparities in primary treatment may
be secondary to racial differences in socioeconomics.36 While we
were able to adjust for regional levels of education and income in
our multivariable analysis, we could not account for individual
levels of socioeconomic status which may further account for the
racial disparities in treatment selection.
Previous data from the SEER has shown men with Medicaid or
no insurance received definitive treatment less often compared to
men with private insurance, especially among high-risk patients.37
In the NCDB, even after adjusting for age and other covariates,
having private insurance was associated with higher odds of RP
while having Medicaid or no insurance was associated with lower
odds of RP compared to Medicare. These findings may be
attributable to previous associations drawn between aggressive
cancer treatment and the extent of insurance coverage,38 even
within a Medicare population.39
The strengths of our study include the large and diverse patient
population collected in the NCDB. Unlike other data sets such as
the SEER database, NCDB provides valuable information on the
use of ADT and the order in which treatments were received to
accurately discern initial treatments. The NCDB also captures
information on comorbidities and more complete information on
patient insurance compared to SEER.
Our study is not without its limitations. The NCDB is a hospital-
based cancer registry and not population-based. The data from
the NCDB should be interpreted as generalizable to hospitals
similar to those included in its registry. Nearly three quarters of
patients in the current study were treated at a comprehensive or
academic facility, thus treatment data from community and office-
based health centers may be under-represented. Finally, a large
number of patients were excluded due to missing data regarding
risk stratification. However, although comparison of patients with
and without missing risk data revealed statistically significant
differences in age, race composition and comorbidities, the
differences were relatively modest.
CONCLUSION
In the United States between 2004 and 2013, the likelihood of
receiving RP increased for high-risk PCa. In 2013, the use of RP and
EBRT, were similar. African American men, older men and those
without private insurance were less likely to receive RP.
