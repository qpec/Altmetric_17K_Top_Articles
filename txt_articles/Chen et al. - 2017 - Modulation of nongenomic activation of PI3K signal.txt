Retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRa) binds to DNA either as homodimers or heterodimers, but it
also forms homotetramers whose function is poorly defined. We previously discovered that
an N-terminally-cleaved form of RXRa (tRXRa), produced in tumour cells, activates phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling by binding to the p85a subunit of PI3K and that
K-80003, an anti-cancer agent, inhibits this process. Here, we report through crystallographic
and biochemical studies that K-80003 binds to and stabilizes tRXRa tetramers via a ‘three-
pronged’ combination of canonical and non-canonical mechanisms. K-80003 binding has no
effect on tetramerization of RXRa, owing to the head–tail interaction that is absent in tRXRa.
We also identify an LxxLL motif in p85a, which binds to the coactivator-binding groove on
tRXRa and dissociates from tRXRa upon tRXRa tetramerization. These results identify con-
formational selection as the mechanism for inhibiting the nongenomic action of tRXRa and
provide molecular insights into the development of RXRa cancer therapeutics.

any

target
proteins
including
nuclear
receptors exist in equilibrium between different oligo-
meric states that control their biological functions1–3.
Retinoid X receptor a (RXRa), a member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily and a validated drug target, exists in different
oligomeric forms that regulate a broad spectrum of cellular
processes
under
both
physiological
and
pathophysiological
conditions4–11. Like other nuclear receptors, RXRa comprises
an intrinsically disordered N-terminal A/B domain with poorly
defined functions, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a
ligand-binding domain (LBD) in which a-helices are arranged
around a central hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket (LBP)4–11.
Helix 12 (H12), at the C terminus of RXRa, undergoes large
movements in response to ligand binding12. For example, agonist
binding induces H12 to adopt an active conformation that,
together with elements of helices H3 and H4, create a groove for
binding coactivators that leads to transactivation10,13–16. In
contrast, in the absence of agonist or in the presence of
antagonist, H12 adopts an inactive conformation that favors the
binding of corepressors, which serve to inhibit target gene
transcription. Coactivators contain interaction domains with an
LxxLL motif (NR box), while corepressors utilize a variant of this
motif, L/IxxI/VI (co-repressor NR box, CoRNR)10,13–16.
In addition to acting as heterodimeric partners of some nuclear
receptors4–11,17, RXRa can form homodimers18 that trigger
specific signalling pathways19–21. A unique property of RXRa is
an auto-repressive mechanism involving homotetramerization, in
which a ‘dimer-of-dimers’ pack in a bottom-to-bottom manner,
with H12 from each monomer invading (and invaded by) a
neighbouring domain across the tetramer interface22. This
pairwise ‘exchange of arms’ enables each monomer to bind to
and occlude the coregulator-binding groove of its neighbour22.
Some molecules have been shown to promote the auto-repressed
state and repress gene transcription23. The equilibrium between
inactive
homotetramers
and
active
homodimers
is
tightly
regulated by ligand binding18,22,24. Thus, binding of agonists
such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) results in dissociation of
homotetramers into homodimers, which has been proposed as a
regulatory mechanism for RXRa transactivation22,25. However,
compounds that act to promote RXRa homotetramerization
remain to be identified and characterized.
Recent advances have revealed important nongenomic func-
tions of RXRa and its non-canonical modulators7,26–28. We
previously found that RXRa is abnormally cleaved in many
cancer cells, resulting in a truncated RXRa (tRXRa) that lacks a
portion of its N-terminal A/B domain29. Unlike the wild-type
RXRa, which normally resides in the nucleus, tRXRa is
cytoplasmic, and we showed that it interacts with the p85a
regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a
critical player in a wide range of cellular processes including cell
growth, proliferation, survival, motility, metabolism, protein
synthesis
and
migration30,31.
The
interaction
with
p85a
promotes PI3K/AKT activation and enhances tumour cell
growth, revealing an oncogenic effect of tRXRa in tumour cells.
We also reported that K-80003, a promising anti-cancer agent
derived from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Sulindac, binds to tRXRa and inhibits its interaction with p85a
and activation of PI3K signalling29. However, the molecular
mechanism of this potent inhibition remained to be determined.
Here, we report the crystal structure of RXRa-LBD in complex
with K-80003, and the characterization of the role of K-80003-
mediated tRXRa tetramerization in regulating its interaction with
p85a and the nongenomic activation of PI3K signalling. Our
results reveal a previously unrecognized role of RXRa tetramers
in modulating subcellular localization and nongenomic interac-
tion with cytoplasmic signalling proteins. Moreover, we show that
K-80003 inhibits tRXRa interaction with p85a by stabilizing a
tetrameric form of tRXRa through a ‘three-pronged’ mechanism
involving both canonical and non-canonical binding. This work
opens up new avenues for developing novel RXRa-based
therapeutics, by selectively stabilizing a particular oligomeric
state.
Results
Crystal structure of K-80003-bound RXRa-LBD. To under-
stand how K-80003 (Supplementary Fig. 1a) modulates the bio-
logical activity of tRXRa, we determined the crystal structure of
RXRa-LBD in complex with K-80003 to a resolution of 2.6 Å
(Table 1). We found that the RXRa-LBD/K-80003 complex
adopts a tetrameric structure, similar to those observed in
crystals of apo-RXRa or RXRa-LBD/tRA-isomer complex22
(Supplementary Fig. 1b), in which two RXRa-LBD canonical
homodimers (labelled A1/B1 and A2/B2) pack in a bottom-to-
bottom manner (Fig. 1a) with point group symmetry D2. Besides
the canonical dimer interface32, there are two symmetry-related
interfaces involving subunits A1/B2 and B1/A2. These ‘tetramer’
interfaces comprise three sub-regions: parallel packing between
symmetry-related H3 helices; ‘end-to-end’ packing between H11
that reduces their length by two helical turns (compared with the
agonist-bound structure); and the invasion of each H12 helix into
its apposing domain, where it binds to the coregulator-binding
groove, consisting of elements of H3 and H4 (Fig. 1a). The
apposing domain reciprocates the process in a pairwise ‘exchange
of C-terminal arms’. An LMEML motif near the C terminus of
H12 binds to the coregulator groove by mimicking the LxxLL/
LxxIL motif of coregulators (Supplementary Fig. 2). The tetramer
interfaces create two substantial symmetry-related interfacial
cavities that are readily accessible to solvent and small molecules.
Refinement of the structure and careful inspection of difference
Fourier maps revealed six molecules of K-80003-bound per
tetramer, with three molecules per A1/B2 or A2/B1 interfacial
cavity (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 3). This stoichiometry is

 consistent with values derived by isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The 2 A1/B2 and A2/B1
interfacial cavities are symmetry-related and the three bound
molecules in each cavity (K-80003A, K-80003B and K-80003C,
respectively, Fig. 1b) appear to play distinct but complementary
roles in stabilizing the tetramer. Thus, K-80003A and K-80003B
are arranged about the A1/B2 pseudo-dyad, making similar but
distinct interactions (Figs 1b and 2b). They bind in a region
where the H12 is located in the agonist-bound RXRa-LBD
structure (Fig. 2a) and thus distinct from the canonical ligand-
binding region. The indene ring of K-80003A makes many
interactions with monomer B2, including parallel aromatic
stacking with W305, and hydrophobic binding with L276 and
L309, and R302. Its isopropylphenyl ring contacts K-80003C. On
the other face of K-80003A, there are several hydrophobic/
aromatic interactions, including with the side-chains of F439,
I447 and L451 from the A1 monomer (Fig. 2b). On the fourth
side, to complete the ‘cage’ around K-80003C, there are numbers
of polar and ionic interactions. Notably, the carboxylate of
K-80003A makes a bifurcated salt-bridge with K440 from A1 and
R302 from B2, as well as an H-bond with the indole N-H of
W305 (B2) (Fig. 2b). Thus, K-80003A is firmly encased on all
sides at a unique location: by side-chains from A1 and B2 at the
top and bottom, by molecule K-80003C on one side, and by
elements of the invading H11–H12 turn and H12 helix on the
other.
For K-80003B, the symmetry-related packing is similar but
distinct with fewer interactions. The ionic interactions with R302
of A1 and K440 of B2 are much weaker, which may explain why
K-80003B is less ordered than K-80003A, and with less well-
defined electron density. Nevertheless, it makes similar aromatic
stacking interactions—in this case, parallel with F439, but a less-
optimal (45� stacking angle) with W305 (Fig. 2), as well as
hydrophobic interactions with L433 of A1 and L436 of B2.
K-80003C binds in the pocket of monomer B2, in a mode that
resembles a canonical ligand (Fig. 2a). Unlike K-80003A and
K-80003B, it makes strong contacts only with the B2 subunit
(Fig. 2b). Its carboxyl motif makes a salt-bridge with R316, while
the indene ring sits in a broad hydrophobic cavity, and both are
well-defined
in
the
electron
density
map.
However,
the
isopropylbenzene moiety sticks out of the pocket and into the
cavity, making only weak contacts with other residues; it
presumably adopts multiple conformations, consistent with the
weak electron density (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Taken together, the interactions between the three bound
K-80003 molecules and the protein suggest that K-80003
stabilizes RXRa-LBD tetramer by a unique combination of
distinct
and
canonical-binding
mechanisms
acting
like
a
‘3-pronged’ binding mode: K-80003A is tightly packed in a
hydrophobic, aromatic and polar cage that strengthens the
tetramer and provides additional glue to hold H12 in its place to
prevent coregulator binding. K-80003B also contributes to
tetramer stabilization, but appears less tightly packed; signifi-
cantly, however, it blocks the entrance to the unoccupied pocket
in monomer A1, which might be otherwise favored by ligands
such as 9-cis-RA. K-80003C binds in the pocket in monomer B2
interacting with K-80003A and B2.

 To understand why K-80003 binds asymmetrically to the
tetramer, we closely examined the shape of the tetramer’s
interfacial cavity. Superposition of A1/B2 subunit on to itself
reveals that A1/B2 is asymmetric (Supplementary Fig. 4a) with a
smaller pocket in monomer A1 than in the B2 monomer
(Supplementary Fig. 4b). This asymmetry seems to be resulted
from the shifts of H3 and H11 into the pocket in A1
(Supplementary Fig. 4c) and provides an explanation for why
small molecules bind asymmetrically to the tetramer22,33. In the
previously reported RXRa-LBD/tRA-isomer tetramer structure22,
tRA-isomer binds to the narrower pocket in monomer A1 where
K-80003 molecule is too big to fit in (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In
our
structure,
the
large
size
of
the
K-80003C
molecule
presumably selects the wider LBP pocket of the A1/B2 dimer.
Despite these differences in ligand binding, the two tetramers
have similar overall structures (r.m.s. deviation for Ca atoms is
1.20 Å), and the largest changes are observed at the tetramer
interface (Supplementary Fig. 1b), presumably induced by the
non-canonical binders, K-80003A and K-80003B.
K-80003 promotes tetramerization of tRXRa but not RXRa.
The unique binding of K-80003 observed in the tetrameric form
of K-80003-bound RXRa-LBD crystal structure prompted us to
determine whether K-80003 binding could promote RXRa-LBD
tetramerization. In non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis, purified RXRa-LBD protein existed as two distinct
bands corresponding to homodimer and homotetramer, respec-
tively (Fig. 3a). As expected, incubation of RXRa with 9-cis-RA
known to induce homodimerization18 resulted in a shift of
RXRa-LBD from tetramers to dimers. In contrast, incubation
with K-80003 induced an accumulation of tetramers. L433 near
the C terminus of H10 packs directly against the indene ring
of
K-80003B,
and
its
mutation
to
D
would
destabilize
key
interactions

due
to
loss
of

Indeed,
K-80003
failed
to
bind
to
RXRa-LBD/L433D
(Supplementary
Fig.
5a)
and
promote
its
tetramerization
(Fig. 3a). Substitution of Q275 in H3 with E, or F439 in H11
with A, which are involved in the binding of K-80003 (Fig. 2),
impaired the tetramerization of respective mutants by K-80003,
confirming the role of H3 and H11 in the K-80003-induced
stabilization of RXRa-LBD tetramers. Interestingly, mutating
R316 in LBP, which is essential for 9-cis-RA binding12 and
involved in K-80003C binding (Fig. 2b), with E, resulted in a
mutant (RXRa-LBD/R316E) that exhibited mainly as a tetramer
independent of the presence of either 9-cis-RA or K-80003, in
agreement with a previous report25. The effect of K-80003 on
stabilizing RXRa-LBD tetramers appeared overpower the 9-cis-
RA-induced homodimerization as RXRa-LBD was mainly found
as a tetramer in the presence of both K-80003 and 9-cis-RA
(Fig. 3a).
The ability of K-80003 to stabilize RXRa-LBD tetramer was
also illustrated by gel filtration chromatography showing that
purified RXRa-LBD protein mainly existed as a tetramer in the
presence of K-80003, while it displayed predominantly as a
homodimeric complex in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3b).
Evaluation
of
a
panel
of
chemical
crosslinkers
identified
homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccimide-based chemical cross-
linker BS3 as the most efficient one to crosslink the RXRa-LBD
tetramer (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Thus, BS3 was subsequently
used to study the effect of K-80003 on RXRa tetramerization.
Extracts from cells transfected with RXRa-LBD and treated with
either K-80003 or 9-cis-RA were prepared and subsequently
incubated with BS3. Figure 3c showed that the treatment of cells
with K-80003 produced crosslinked species on SDS-PAGE gels of
25, 50 and 100 kDa, corresponding to monomer, dimer and
tetramer of RXRa-LBD, respectively. For comparison, treatment
with 9-cis-RA resulted in only monomer and homodimer.
Interestingly, RXRa or mutants expressed in cells mainly existed
as a monomer even after crosslinking, which is different from
purified RXRa proteins. Examination of the effect of K-80003 on
tetramerization of tRXRa and RXRa revealed that K-80003
effectively promoted the formation of tRXRa tetramers. Unex-
pectedly, K-80003 failed to promote the tetramerization of the
full-length RXRa, indicating that the N-terminal A/B domain
interferes with its tetramerization.
The RXRa N/C interaction inhibits its tetramerization. The
above observation prompted us to determine how the N-terminal
A/B domain of RXRa inhibited its tetramerization (Fig. 1). Thus,
the interaction between RXRa-A/B domain and RXRa-LBD
(Fig. 3d) was studied by cell-based coimmunoprecipitation (coIP)
assays. Immunoprecipitation of the RXRa-A/B protein resulted in
a strong coIP of the RXRa-LBD protein, demonstrating their
interaction. The interaction was inhibited by 9-cis-RA in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 3e), and was confirmed by immunos-
taining showing extensive colocalization of transfected RXRa-A/B
with RXRa-LBD but not RXRa in the cytoplasm of cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). Cotransfection of the RXRa A/B domain
completely suppressed the effect of K-80003 on promoting tRXRa
tetramerization (Fig. 3f). These data reveal an extensive intramo-
lecular interaction between the N terminus and the C terminus
(N/C) in RXRa and its critical role in regulating RXRa tetra-
merization, and also provides a molecular explanation for the
differential effect of K-80003 on the tetramerization of tRXRa and
RXRa.
To further study the N/C interaction, we first conducted
deletion analysis of the N-terminal A/B region to narrow down
the region required for the interaction. Deletion of either the
N-terminal 40 or 60 amino acids could not confer the ability of
the resulting mutants to interact with the A/B domain (Fig. 3g).
Deletion of additional 20 amino acids resulted in a mutant
(tRXRa), which strongly interacted with the RXRa-A/B protein.
RXRa-D60,
like
tRXRa,
interacted
strongly
with
RARg
(Supplementary Fig. 6b), demonstrating that RXRa-D60 is still
active in heterodimerization with RARg. These results suggested
that amino acids from 60 to 80 are critical for the N/C
interaction. We next determined region in RXRa-LBD required
for binding A/B domain. RXRa-A/B could interact with RXRa
mutants lacking N-terminal sequences (tRXRa, RXRa-D100 and
RXRa-LBD) but not with mutant lacking C-terminal LBD
(RXRa-1-235) or mutants lacking AF2/H12 region (RXRa-
DAF2 and RXRa-DA/BDAF2) (Fig. 3h). tRXRa without AF2/
H12 also failed to interact with RXRa-A/B (Supplementary
Fig. 6c). Thus, the N/C intramolecular interaction involves the
N-terminal A/B domain and the C-terminal AF2/H12. The
conclusion was supported by data showing the inability of
the A/B domain to bind to the full-length RXRa, likely due to the
unavailability of the C-terminal binding site masked by its own
N-terminal A/B domain. The AF2/H12 is involved in the
formation of the hydrophobic coactivator-binding groove that
was shown to mediate the N/C interaction of some nuclear
receptors34,35. To determine whether the N/C interaction involves
the coactivator-binding groove, we tested whether W305, which is
located in H5 and was shown to play a critical role in the
formation of the coactivator-binding groove12, was involved in
the N/C interaction. Our results showed that RXRa-LBD/W305Q
with W305 mutated to Q, which failed to bind to an LxxLL-
containing protein (see below), could still bind to the RXRa-A/B

 protein in a 9-cis-RA sensitive manner similar to the wild-type
RXRa-LBD (Fig. 3i). These results preclude the involvement of
the coactivator-binding groove in the N/C interaction.
An LxxLL motif in p85a mediates p85a interaction with RXRa.
tRXRa differs from RXRa in its ability to reside in the cytoplasm
and interact with cytoplasmic p85a protein, an event that is
inhibited
by
K-80003
(ref.
29).
To
address
the
role
of
tetramerization in modulating tRXRa interaction with p85a, we
first determined how p85a binds to tRXRa. Thus, several p85a
mutants (Fig. 4a) were constructed and analysed for their inter-
action with tRXRa. CoIP experiments showed that the N-term-
inal region of p85a, including the N-terminal SH3 and BCR
domains, is sufficient for interacting with tRXRa, whereas the
C-terminal region including NSH2, iSH2 and CSH2 domains was
dispensable (Fig. 4b). We further observed that a p85a mutant
encompassing only the BCR domain could interact with tRXRa
and RXRa-LBD but not RXRa-A/B (Fig. 4c).
In an effort to understand the molecular basis for BCR
interaction with tRXRa, we noticed the presence of two LxxLL
motifs,
161LRQLL165 and
240LQYLL244, in BCR, which are

 commonly found in coactivators that mediates the transactivation
of nuclear receptors10,13–16. Inspection of both motifs in the
published BCR structure36 revealed that the 240LQYLL244 motif is
buried in the central core of the BCR domain, while the
161LRQLL165 motif is located in a separate helix within a loop
region. The 161LRQLL165 motif docks well to the coactivator-
binding groove of RXRa (Fig. 4d), suggesting that the motif might
be critical for RXRa binding. A peptide (BCR peptide) that
encompasses the 161LRQLL165 motif (Fig. 4a) was therefore
synthesized and examined for its binding to RXRa-LBD by
Biacore assay. The peptide binds strongly to RXRa-LBD in the
presence of 9-cis-RA with a Kd of 320 nM (Fig. 4e), which is in
the range of coregulator peptide binding to nuclear receptor37.
The role of the 161LRQLL165 motif was also illustrated by the
enhancing effect of 9-cis-RA on p85a-BCR interaction with either
RXRa-LBD or tRXRa (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, 9-cis-RA-induced
RXRa-LBD interaction with p85a-BCR was inhibited by the
LxxLL-containing
BCR
peptide
conjugated
with
the
cell-
penetrating
peptide
derived
from
trans-activator
of
transcription (TAT), similar to the effect of K-80003, but not
by the corresponding mutant peptide (Fig. 4g). Substitution of
L164 and L165 in 161LRQLL165 motif with A also abolished the
interaction of BCR with RXRa-LBD (Fig. 4h). Mutating W305
critical for the formation of the coactivator-binding groove12 to Q
impaired the binding of RXRa-LBD with p85a-BCR either in the
presence or absence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 4i), even though the same
mutation had no effect on RXRa-LBD interaction with RXRa-A/
B (Fig. 3i). The interaction of the LxxLL-like motif in p85a
with the coactivator-binding groove of tRXRa is biologically
relevant as TNFa-induced activation of AKT in cells transfected
with tRXRa and p85a was inhibited by cotransfection of
BCR but not BCR mutant, similar to the inhibitory effect
of K-80003 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Exposure of cells to
BCR
peptide
also
resulted
in
a
similar
inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. 7b). Altogether, these results demonstrate
that the LxxLL motif in p85a can bind to the coactivator-binding
groove of RXRa in analogy to the binding of transcriptional
coactivators.
Tetramerization prevents tRXRa from interacting with p85a.
To further characterize the ‘coactivator-like’ binding of p85a, we
studied the requirement of AF2/H12 in tRXRa, which is essential
for the formation of the coactivator-binding groove12,38, for
tRXRa interaction with p85a. As previously reported29, tRXRa
interacted with the full-length p85a in the presence of TNFa.
Removing AF2/H12 from tRXRa (tRXRa/DAF2) abolished its
interaction with p85a (Fig. 5a). Interfering AF2/H12 activity by
transfecting
RXRa-A/B
capable
of
binding
AF2/H12
also
inhibited 9-cis-RA-induced interaction of tRXRa with p85a-
DiSH2 (Fig. 5b). These results further support the ‘coactivator-
like’ binding of p85a.
Because the coactivator-binding groove of RXRa was shielded
in the tetrameric form of RXRa-LBD (Fig. 1), our observation
that the LxxLL-like motif in p85a interacted with the coactivator-
binding groove of RXRa implied that the p85a-binding activity of
tRXRa is impaired in its tetrameric form. To address this, we
evaluated the binding of p85a by two tRXRa mutants, tRXRa/
F313A and tRXRa/R316E, which exist in different oligomeric
forms25. RXRa/F313A is a transcriptionally constitutively active
mutant receptor with H12 adopting an active conformation to
form the coactivator-binding groove39. The mutant does not exist
as a tetramer as its H12 is not available to contribute to the
formation
of
tetramers25.
In
contrast,
tRXRa/R316E,
a
transcriptionally inactive mutant, exhibited predominantly as a
tetramer25. In agreement with previous observations25, our cross-
link experiments detected a strong tetrameric species of tRXRa/
R316E but not tRXRa/F313A independent of the presence of
9-cis-RA or K-80003 (Fig. 5c). When both mutants were analysed
for their interaction with p85a by coIP experiments, we found
that tRXRa/R316E could not bind to p85a either in the absence
or presence of TNFa or 9-cis-RA, whereas tRXRa/F313A showed
a
constitutive
and
9-cis-RA-independent
interaction
with
p85a compared to tRXRa (Fig. 5d). K-80003 also failed to
modulate the interaction of both mutants with p85a (Fig. 5e).
Immunostaining revealed lack of colocalization of the tRXRa/
R316E mutant with p85a in the absence or presence of TNFa
(Fig. 5f). To further determine the inhibitory effect of tRXRa
tetramerization, we examined the interaction of p85a-DiSH2 with
tRXRa tetramers crosslinked by BS3. Cells transfected with
HA-p85a-DiSH2 and Myc-tRXRa were treated with 9-cis-RA
and/or K-80003, and subsequently exposed to BS3. 9-cis-RA-
induced tRXRa interaction with p85a-DiSH2 was potently
inhibited by BS3 that stabilized tRXRa tetramers (Fig. 5g).
Furthermore, the monomeric form but not the tetrameric form of
RXRa-LBD interacted with p85a-BCR (Fig. 5h). These results
together with our structural information demonstrate that
K-80003 inhibits tRXRa interaction with p85a by promoting
tRXRa tetramerization that masks the p85a-binding region on
tRXRa.
Tetramerization regulates tRXRa subcellular localization. The
interaction of tRXRa with p85a occurs in the cytoplasm29. We
next
determined
whether
K-80003-induced
stabilization
of
tRXRa tetramers could modulate its subcellular localization.
When transfected into cells, both tRXRa and RXRa resided
mainly (480%) in the nucleus. However, upon TNFa treatment
Figure 3 | Induction of RXRa tetramerization by K-80003 and its regulation by the N-C intramolecular interaction. (a) Equal amounts of purified
RXRa-LBD or mutant protein were incubated with DMSO, 9-cis-RA, and/or K-80003, and separated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
followed by Coomassie Bright Blue staining. The percentage of tetramer and dimer of RXRa-LBD or mutants was quantitated by densitometric analysis of
the corresponding blots. One of four similar experiments is shown. (b) RXRa-LBD incubated with K-80003 or 9-cis-RA was subject to gel filtration
chromatogram assay. Results showed that 9-cis-RA-induced RXRa-LBD was mostly in dimer (D), while K-80003-induced RXRa-LBD was mostly in
tetramer (T). One of three similar experiments is shown. (c) HepG2 cells transfected with RXRa, tRXRa or RXRa-LBD were treated with 9-cis-RA or

 tRXRa was found in the cytoplasm of cells (465%), colocalizing
extensively with p85a. In contrast, TNFa had no effect on the
nuclear localization of RXRa. When cells were cotreated with
K-80003, TNFa-induced colocalization of tRXRa with p85a in
the
cytoplasm
was
inhibited,
resulting
in
tRXRa
nuclear
localization (Fig. 6a). The effect of K-80003 was likely due to its
binding to tRXRa as the cytoplasmic colocalization of p85a with
tRXRa/L433D mutant defective in K-80003 binding was not
affected
by
K-80003.
Thus,
TNFa-induced
cytoplasmic
localization
of
tRXRa
was
likely
due
to
its
cytoplasmic
retention by TNFa-activated p85a through protein/protein
interaction,
suggesting
that
tRXRa
tetramers
incapable
of
binding p85a might reside in the nucleus. To address this,
extracts prepared from cells transfected with tRXRa were
subjected to crosslinking by BS3. Nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions were then prepared and analysed. Western blotting
showed that K-80003-stabilized tetrameric form of tRXRa was
found exclusively in the nuclear fraction, while tRXRa monomer
was distributed both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
(Fig. 6b). Thus, K-80003-stabilized tRXRa tetramer is mainly

 nuclear, likely resulted from tRXRa dissociation from p85a or
other cytoplasmic proteins.
To study whether the anti-tumour effect of K-80003 could be
attributed to its effect on the subcellular localization of tRXRa
in vivo, we stably transfected tRXRa or RXRa into MCF-7 cells,
and the resulting stable clones (Supplementary Fig. 8a) were
inoculated into nude mice. Overexpression of tRXRa but not
RXRa in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhanced AKT activation
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8b) and promoted the growth of
MCF-7 tumour in animals, which was suppressed when animal
were treated with K-80003 (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 8c).
Inhibition of the growth of MCF-7/tRXRa tumour by K-80003 was
accompanied with reduced AKT activation and enhanced PARP
cleavage (Fig. 6d). To determine whether the anti-cancer activity of
K-80003 was associated with its modulation of tRXRa subcellular
localization, tumour specimens from nude mice were analysed by
RXRa immunostaining (Fig. 6e). While RXRa was nuclear, tRXRa
was predominantly cytoplasmic. However, a significant amount of
tRXRa was found in the nucleus when animals were administered
with K-80003. We also used polyomavirus middle T antigen
(PyMT)
transgenic
mice40
to
study
the
anti-cancer
effect
of K-80003 and its modulation of the subcellular localization of
tRXRa, which was highly expressed in PyMT mammary tumour
developed in these mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a). K-80003
potently inhibited the growth of PyMT mammary tumour in
this animal model (Fig. 6f), accompanied with induction of PARP
cleavage and inhibition of cyclin D expression (Fig. 6g) as well as
inhibition of tumour cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 9b).
Immunostaining of PyMT tumour specimens using D197 anti-
RXRa antibody that recognizes both RXRa and tRXRa revealed a
predominant cytoplasmic RXRa staining (Fig. 6h). In contrast,
RXRa staining was mainly found in the nucleus when mice were
dosed with K-80003. Thus, K-80003 induction of tRXRa nuclear
localization through its modulation of tRXRa tetramerization
likely represents a major mechanism by which the compound
exerts its potent therapeutic effect.
Discussion
RXRa is unique in that it can form not only homodimers and
heterodimers but also homotetramers4–11,17,25,33,38, suggesting that
the equilibrium between these different oligomeric states plays a
role in regulating RXRa functions. While the function and
mechanism of RXRa homodimer and heterodimers are well
documented, the role of RXRa homotetramers and its regulation
remains poorly defined. We report here that K-80003 represents a
unique RXRa ligand capable of shifting the oligomeric equilibrium
by
selectively
binding
to
and
stabilizing
the
tetrameric
conformation. Our crystal structure of RXRa-LBD in complex
with K-80003 shows that six molecules of K-80003 bind in a
tetramer by a unique combination of distinct and canonical binding
mechanisms
acting
like
a
‘3-pronged’
binding
mode.
The
comprehensive
interactions
between
the
bound
K-80003
molecules and the protein provide a plausible explanation for
how K-80003 binding can stabilize the tRXRa tetrameric state.
Biochemical studies confirmed that K-80003 binding could
promote tetramerization of tRXRa but not full-length RXRa.
K-80003-induced stabilization of tRXRa tetramer was associated
with inhibition of its interaction with p85a and activation of
tRXRa-dependent PI3K/AKT signalling. The tetramerization also
represents a crucial event in determining the subcellular localization
of tRXRa. Collectively, these results unravel a critical role of tRXRa
tetramerization in regulating its subcellular localization and
nongenomic interaction with cytoplasmic signalling proteins.
Although how tRXRa binds to p85a remains to be precisely
defined, our data demonstrated that an LxxLL motif in p85a and
the amino acid residues at the coregulator-binding groove of
RXRa are critical for their interaction (Fig. 4). These data in
combination with information from comparing the RXRa-LBD
dimer
and
RXRa-LBD/K-80003
tetramer
crystal
structures
demonstrate that the potential p85a-binding site on tRXRa
resides in the coregulator-binding groove. In the K-80003-
stabilized
RXRa-LBD
tetramer,
H12
protrudes
into
the coregulator-binding groove of the neighbouring monomer
(Fig. 1), making the groove inaccessible for p85a binding
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Modulation of gene transcription by
nuclear receptors is mediated through their interaction with
coactivators or corepressors via the LxxLL motif and the L/IxxI/
VI motif, respectively10,13–16. Thus, our identification of a
functional LxxLL motif in p85a suggests that p85a may serve
as a nongenomic coregulator of tRXRa in analogy with the
regulation of nuclear receptor transactivation by coregulators in
the nucleus10,13–16. The genomic and nongenomic coregulators of
RXRa may act coordinately to mediate the crosstalk between
RXRa nuclear and cytoplasmic signallings. It is noteworthy that
several
nuclear
receptors,
including
oestrogen
receptor,
glucocorticoid
receptor,
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors, thyroid receptor and retinoic acid receptor could
interact with p85a41–49. Whether p85a serves as a common
coregulator for different nuclear receptors to modulate PI3K
signalling remains to be seen. The concept of cytoplasmic nuclear
receptor coregulators will expand our conventional view of
coregulators and may lead to the identification of a class of
cytoplasmic signalling proteins that mediate the nongenomic
action of RXRa and perhaps other nuclear receptors.
Interaction between the N- and the C-terminal segments of a
protein appears to be evolutionarily selected for some functional

 advantages50. Although the N-terminal A/B domains of nuclear
receptors are intrinsically disordered, studies have now shown
that they are capable of undergoing a disorder-to-order transition
upon binding specific target molecules3. Thus far, the N/C
intramolecular interaction has been described for several nuclear
receptors,
including
oestrogen
receptor51,
progesterone
receptor52, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors53 and
androgen receptor34. We report here that N/C interaction also
occurs in RXRa and acts to mediate RXRa interaction with p85a,
defining a regulatory paradigm for RXRa action. Although how
the N/C interaction in RXRa is mediated remains unclear, our
inspection of the sequences (61mgppfsvisspmgphsmsvp80) at the
N-terminal A/B domain of RXRa (Fig. 3g) revealed the existence
of potential polyproline II (PPII) domain characterized by a PxxP
core motif known to bind to SH3, WW and EVH1 domain54.
This is reminiscent of previous reports that proline-rich nuclear
receptor co-regulatory protein 2 (PNRC2) uses a SH3 domain-
binding motif (SEPPSPS) to interact with the LBDs of different

 nuclear receptors including oestrogen receptor, glucocorticoid
receptor, progesterone receptor, thyroid receptor, retinoic acid
receptor and RXR55, and that a unique interaction motif exists in
the ligand-binding domain of oestrogen receptor for binding
PPII-like motif56. Although AF2/H12 at the C-terminal end of
RXRa is required for the N/C interaction (Fig. 3h), the
coactivator-binding groove involving the AF2/H12 was not
required (Fig. 3i). This is supported by the result that the N/C
interaction was inhibited by 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3e). How the AF2/H12
engages the N/C interaction remains to be determined. The
N-terminal A/B domain through intramolecular interaction with
the C-terminal domain may allosterically affect the function of
distant domains to ensure that RXRa activity is appropriately
achieved. As the disruption of the N/C interaction has been

the N/C interaction in RXRa plays a role in mediating the
crosstalk between RXRa and signal transduction pathways under
both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
In conclusion, our results elucidate a previously unrecognized
role of RXRa tetramers and demonstrate that conformational
selection plays a critical role in the regulation of the nongenomic
function of RXRa. We showed that the tetramerization of RXRa
could be regulated by several mechanisms including ligand
binding, intra domain–domain interaction and nongenomic
interaction with cytoplasmic signalling proteins. This study opens
an opportunity to develop novel RXRa-based therapeutics by
selectively stabilizing a particular oligomeric state. The selective
induction by K-80003 of the tetramerization of tRXRa but not
RXRa suggests that this class of compounds may preferentially
affect tRXRa activity, which is therapeutically desirable since
tRXRa is often overproduced in cancer cells29.
Methods
Protein expression and purification. The human RXRa LBD (residues Thr223 to
Thr462) cloned as an N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein in pET15b
expression vector was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain (Stratagene). After
sonication, cell extract was incubated with the His60 Ni Superflow resin, and His-
tagged RXRa-LBD-resin complexes were washed, eluted and concentrated to
5 mg ml � 1 for subsequent trails73,74. For crystallization experiment, bovine
thrombin (Sigma) was used to cleave the His tag from the purified His-tagged
RXRa-LBD. The resulting His tag was removed on the Resource-Q column (GE)
using 0.1–1 M NaCl gradient and the Tris-Cl pH 8 buffer. RXRa-LDB was further
purified using gel filtration on a Superdex 200 2660 column (GE) pre-equilibrated
with the 75 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8).
Crystallization and structure solution. Crystallization conditions were initially
determined using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method and the crystallization
screens Index and PEG-Ion solutions from Hampton Research. Final crystals were
obtained by cocrystallizing the protein and the ligand. The protein-ligand complex
contained 0.35 mM of RXRa-LBD, 0.5–0.7 mM of a ligand, 1% DMSO, 100 mM
NaCl and 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6). 0.2 ml of the protein-ligand complex
was mixed with 0.2 ml of the well solution (20% PEG3330 and 0.2 M Na Acetate)
and incubated at 20 �C. Crystals appeared in 5–10 days and grew into
0.2 � 0.1 � 0.1 mm prisms. The crystals were flash-cooled in mother liquor
containing 1.5 mM of K-80003 and 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction
data was collected from the cryo-cooled crystal (100 K) on an in-house
diffractometer (Rigaku X-ray generator with a rotating anode, VariMax optic and
R-AXIS HTC detector). Data was processed using the programme iMOSFLM,
part of the CCP4 suite75. The b-factor of the data set according to the Wilson plot
was 60 Å2.
The crystal structures were determined using the molecular replacement
program Phaser76 with pdb entry 4N8R as an initial model. Coot77 and the
program suite Phenix78 were used for the model rebuilding and refinement.
Parameter files and initial models for the ligands were prepared by eLBOW of
Phenix. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Overall, 96.5% of residues in the refined structure are in favored regions of the
Ramachandran plot, and no residues fall into disallowed regions. Coordinate
errors, as estimated by Phenix, is 0.37 (Å).

Peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized on MBHA resin using Fmoc
synthesis and DIC/HOBt coupling with an Advanced Chem Tech 350 and 396
multiple peptide synthesizer79. Cell-penetrating peptide derived from TAT
(GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) was conjugated with p85a-peptide79. All peptides were
acetylated on their N termini, and all were amidated on their C termini. Standard
deprotection conditions were used for all peptides. Peptides were purified by HPLC
on C18 columns and confirmed by MALDI mass analysis.

 then subject to gel filtration chromatogram assay. Elutes of RXRa-LBD protein
were separated by 8% non-denaturing PAGE followed by silver staining.
Chemical crosslinking. Cells were transfected with RXRa or mutant expression
vectors for 24 h and then exposed to 9-cis-RA (10 � 7 M) or K-80003 (5 � 10 � 6 M)
for 6 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and incubated with bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]
suberate (BS3, Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of
1 mM. The reactions were stopped with protein gel loading buffer. Samples were
resolved by SDS/PAGE in 8% acrylamide gels and protein bands were visualized by
western blotting.
Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Purified RXRa-LBD protein (0.2 mg ml � 1)
was incubated with DMSO, 9-cis-RA (0.5 mM), and/or K-80003 (20 mM) for 3 h at
4 �C in a total volume of 20 ml, and proteins were separated by 8% non-denaturing
PAGE followed by Coomassie Bright Blue staining.
Cell culture and transfection. MCF-7 breast cancer cells, HepG2 liver cancer
cells, A549 lung cancer cells, and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells (from
ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum. The cells were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 �C. Subconfluent cells
with exponential growth were used throughout the experiments. Cell transfections
were carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer.
Compound binding. Binding of compounds to RXRa-LBD or mutant was studied
in phosphate buffer at 25 �C using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay that
measures the heat either released or absorbed during binding. The purified
His-tagged RXRa-LBD or mutant protein (50 mM in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 0.1% DMSO) was placed in the sample cell of MicroCal VP-ITC
titration calorimeter. The compounds to be studied were diluted to a
concentration of 1 mM in the same buffer. All solutions were degassed before the
titrations. Titration was carried out using a 2-ml compound with injection time 4 s
and a 120 s delay between each injection. The heat of dilution was obtained by
injecting compounds into the same buffer and subtracted from the reaction before
the fitting process. Calorimetric data were analysed using MicroCal Origin software
(version 7.0).
Peptide binding. Binding of BCR peptide to His-tagged RXRa-LBD was analysed
at 25 �C by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a BIAcore T200 machine with
CM5 chips (GE Healthcare). The purified His-tagged RXRa-LBD protein
(20 mg ml � 1 in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5) in the presence of 9-cis-RA was
immobilized on the CM5 chip via amine coupling of RXRa-LBD’s –NH2 groups
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BCR peptide with different con-
centrations was injected into the chip. The sensor surface was regenerated with
Glycine–HCl (10 mM, pH 2.5) when the data collection was finished in each cycle.
Sensorgrams were fit globally with BIAcore T200 analysis using 1:1 Langmuir
binding mode. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was determined using
BIAcore’s evaluation software provided by the manufacturer.
Western blotting. Proteins or cell lysates were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes
were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM
NaCl and 0.1% Tween20) for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibodies and
secondary antibodies and detected using ECL system (Thermo). The dilutions of
the primary antibodies were anti-RXRa (DN197, Santa Cruz) in 1:1,000, anti-
PARP (H-250, Santa Cruz) in 1:3,000, anti-p85a (Millipore) in 1:1,000, anti-p-AKT
(D9E, Cell Signaling Technology) in 1:1000, anti-AKT1/2/3 (H-136, Santa Cruz) in

of all uncropped western blots can be found in Supplementary Figs 10–14.
Coimmunoprecipitation assay. For coIP assay29, HEK293T cells grown in 10 cm
dishes were transfected with various plasmids. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM NaF,
2 mM sodium pyrophosphate) with a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors (Roche). Lysates
were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 12 h at 4 �C and subsequently
incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were
collected and washed three times with lysis buffer. The protein–antibody complexes
recovered on beads were subjected to immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies
after separation by SDS-PAGE. Input represents 5% of cell lysates used for coIP assays.
Confocal microscopy. Cells mounted on glass slides or tumour tissue frozen
sections (5-mm-thick) were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 15 min and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for
15 min. Fixed cells or tumour tissues were blocked with 5 mg ml � 1 BSA in PBS
for 30 min at room temperature, followed with incubation with primary antibodies
for 3 h and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and co-stained with
4060-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei. The images were taken
under an LSM-510 confocal laser scanning microscope system (Carl Zeiss).
Animal studies. For nude mice xenograft study, Myc-RXRa and Myc-tRXRa
cloned into pcdna3.0 vector were stably transfected into MCF-7 cells, and the
resulting stable clones and control clone (2 � 106 cells in 100 ml) were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice (BALB/c, SPF grade, 16–18 g, 4–5-week old). For
drug treatment, mice were intraperitoneally injected (i.p.) daily with K-80003
(20 mg kg � 1) diluted in Tween-80 or vehicle (tween-80). Body weight and tumour
size were measured every 2 days. Mice were killed after 12-day drug treatment and
the tumours removed for various assessments. For MMTV-PyMT transgenic
mouse study, 4-week old female mice of a transgenic mouse on the FVB/N genetic
background expressing the PyMT oncogene under the control of MMTV LTR
promoter40 were fed with diet containing with or without K-80003 (100 mg kg � 1)
for 4 weeks. Estimation of tumour appearance was performed by palpation once
every day. Tumour tissues of left thoracic mammary glands were excised after the
treatment. Portion of tissues was used to prepare extracts for western blotting,
while the rest was fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, and used for
immunohistochemical staining using anti-Ki67 antibody and immunostaining
using D197 anti-RXRa antibody. All experimentations and animal usage were
performed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Xiamen
University.
Data analyses. Data were expressed as means±s.d. from three or more experi-
ments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. Differences were
considered statistically significant with Po0.05.
Data availability. Coordinates and structure factors for the complex of RXRa-
LBD/K-80003 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code
PDB 5TBP. The rest of the data that support the conclusions of this study are
available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.
