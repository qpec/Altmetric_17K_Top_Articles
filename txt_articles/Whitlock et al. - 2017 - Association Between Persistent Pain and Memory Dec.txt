IMPORTANCE Chronic pain is common among the elderly and is associated with cognitive
deficits in cross-sectional studies; the population-level association between chronic pain and
longitudinal cognition is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine the population-level association between persistent pain, which
may reflect chronic pain, and subsequent cognitive decline.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study with biennial interviews of 10 065
community-dwelling older adults in the nationally representative Health and Retirement
Study who were 62 years or older in 2000 and answered pain and cognition questions in
both 1998 and 2000. Data analysis was conducted between June 24 and October 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES “Persistent pain,”defined as a participant reporting that he or she was often
troubled with moderate or severe pain in both the 1998 and 2000 interviews.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes were composite memory score and
dementia probability, estimated by combining neuropsychological test results and informant
and proxy interviews, which were tracked from 2000 through 2012. Linear mixed-effects
models, with random slope and intercept for each participant, were used to estimate the
association of persistent pain with slope of the subsequent cognitive trajectory, adjusting for
demographic characteristics and comorbidities measures in 2000 and applying sampling
weights to represent the 2000 US population. We hypothesized that persistent pain would
predict accelerated memory decline and increased probability of dementia. To quantify the
impact of persistent pain on functional independence, we combined our primary results with
information on the association between memory and ability to manage medications and
finances independently.
RESULTS Of the 10 065 eligible HRS sample members, 60% were female, and median
baseline age was 73 years (interquartile range, 67-78 years). At baseline, persistent pain
affected 10.9% of participants and was associated with worse depressive symptoms and
more limitations in activities of daily living. After covariate adjustment, persistent pain was
associated with 9.2% (95% CI, 2.8%-15.0%) more rapid memory decline compared with
those without persistent pain. After 10 years, this accelerated memory decline implied a
15.9% higher relative risk of inability to manage medications and an 11.8% higher relative risk
of inability to manage finances independently. Adjusted dementia probability increased 7.7%
faster (95% CI, 0.55%-14.2%); after 10 years, this translates to an absolute 2.2% increase in
dementia probability for those with persistent pain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persistent pain was associated with accelerated memory
decline and increased probability of dementia.

hronic pain affects 25% to 33% of older adults, and its
prevalence increases with age.1,2 The elderly are less
likely to recover from chronic pain, compared with
youngerpatients.1,3Evenafteradjustmentforcomorbidities,pa-
tients with pain—including the elderly—are more than twice as
likely to report poor subjective health status.1,4 More recently,
population-basedstudieshavedemonstratedanassociationbe-
tween pain and geriatric syndromes such as falls,5 functional
impairment,6 and cognitive decline and dementia.7,8
Because of the implications for functional independence
and quality of life, the association between chronic pain and
cognitive impairment deserves further attention. Cross-
sectional studies using detailed neuropsychological testing
have revealed significant deficits in attention, memory, infor-
mation processing, and executive function9 in patients with
chronic pain. In particular, memory and executive function—
withwhichfunctionalindependenceistightlycorrelated10—are
significantly poorer in elders with chronic pain.8
There remain important gaps in our understanding of the
longitudinal impact of chronic pain on cognition in the elderly,
however.Studieswithprospectiveassessmentsofpainandcog-
nitive follow-up are essential to establish temporal order, and
existing cross-sectional studies cannot evaluate for the pres-
ence of accelerated cognitive decline. Accordingly, we under-
took the present analysis of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), a longitudinal population-based cohort of elder Ameri-
cans, to evaluate the impact of reported pain on longitudinal
changesinmemoryperformanceanddementiaprobability.Be-
causecognitivedeficitsoftenresultindifficultymanagingdaily
functional tasks, we also investigated potential impact of any
pain-associated memory decrement on the cognitively inten-
sive tasks of medication and financial management.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The HRS is a population-based cohort of community-
dwelling older Americans who undergo detailed in-person or
telephone interviews approximately every 2 years from co-
hort entry until death or dropout. All participants in the HRS
give verbal informed consent for their participation in the
study; HRS data collection is approved by the Health Sci-
encesandBehavioralSciencesinstitutionalreviewboardatthe
University of Michigan. The present study of HRS data was ap-
proved by the University of California, San Francisco, Com-
mittee on Human Research. Participants for this analysis an-
swered questions about pain and cognition without proxy in
the 1998 and 2000 evaluation waves and were at least 60 years
old at the 1998 wave. Participants were followed until death,
dropout, or the 2012 evaluation wave (see eFigure 1 in the
Supplement for data flow). The HRS is sponsored by the Na-
tional Institute on Aging and is conducted by the University
of Michigan.
Coprimary Outcome Definitions
The 2 primary outcomes were memory score and dementia
probabilityscore,assessedaccordingtothemethodsofWuand
colleagues.11Thememoryscoreisaquantitativesummarymet-
ric that combines results from several cognitive tests, includ-
ing those completed by a proxy respondent for severely im-
paired HRS participants, into a single scale, with lower scores
reflecting worse cognition. Dementia probability incorpo-
rates direct and proxy cognitive test responses to estimate the
chance that an individual would meet Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) or
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth
Edition) diagnostic criteria for dementia. Both scores are
continuous, which improves statistical power and therefore
sensitivity to small cognitive changes, and may reduce
misclassification.11
Briefly, the memory score and dementia probability score
were developed using core HRS questionnaire items cali-
brated against the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study
(ADAMS) sample, a subset of HRS participants who under-
went detailed in-person neuropsychological batteries; this or
similar dementia assessments have been used frequently in
priorworkonpopulationpatternsofdementia.12-16ADAMSpar-
ticipants underwent direct memory assessments17,18 and for-
mal evaluation of clinical dementia ratings.19 These were com-
pared against participants’prior-wave HRS core interview
performance, incorporating direct20 and proxy21 responses.
Using the models derived from the ADAMS cohort, memory
score and dementia probability were estimated for all HRS
participants based on the HRS core component measures.
Primary Predictor and Adjustment Variables
The HRS does not evaluate presence of chronic pain directly.
Rather, at each interview, participants respond to pain-
related questions: “Are you often troubled with pain?” and
“How bad is the pain most of the time: mild, moderate or se-
vere?”Participantsreportingthattheywereoftentroubledwith
moderate or severe pain at both the 1998 and 2000 inter-
views were considered to have persistent pain. Participants re-
porting no or mild pain at both interviews, and those report-
ing pain at 1 interview but not both, provided the comparison
group. Analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in
modeled results between those reporting pain at a single wave
and those who denied pain. Accordingly, the primary com-
parison is between a group of respondents reporting pain in
both the 1998 and 2000 interviews (persistent pain) and all
Key Points
Question Is persistent pain associated with accelerated cognitive
decline in the elderly?
Findings In this longitudinal, population-based cohort study,
reporting pain in 2 successive interviews 2 years apart was
associated with a statistically significant increase in the rate of
memory decline and the probability of dementia over the
subsequent 12 years, compared with controls who did not report
persistent pain.
Meaning Persistent pain, which may reflect chronic pain, may
help identify elders at risk of accelerated cognitive decline.

 other respondents. To aid in interpretation of the respon-
dents’pain report, prevalence of “arthritis or rheumatism,
” as
the HRS question is phrased, is reported in the Results.
Model adjustment variables included demographic
measures (baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity [white, black, His-
panic, other]), education (less than high school, high school,
some/completed college, Masters’or professional degree),
tobacco use (current, former, never smoker), and medical
comorbidities (self-report of a physician’
s diagnosis of hyper-
tension, diabetes, cancer [excluding minor skin cancers],
chronic lung disease, heart disease, and stroke). An addi-
tional group of covariates were considered likely to be
affected by pain (and therefore may be mediators): total
household financial assets, marital status, current alcohol
use (none, low-risk, or binge22), depressive symptoms
assessed with a modified 8-item Centers for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale, and report of any limitation in
activities of daily living. The hypothesized relationships
among model covariates, including those identified as poten-
tial mediators vs those considered confounders, are dia-
grammed in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. All covariates
were assessed at the 2000 interview according to participant
report. When available, cleaned and processed variables pre-
pared by the RAND Center for the Study of Aging were
used.23
The eligible sample included 104 participants (1.0%) who
were missing a value for at least 1 covariate. We found no sys-
tematic differences of importance to the research question
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Given the small number of
incomplete cases, complete case analysis was used.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate associations between categorical predictors and pain
group were obtained using Pearson χ2 statistics corrected for
survey design with the second-order correction of Rao and
Scott.24Forcontinuousvariables,ttestswithsamplingweights
were used to generate P values, and median and interquartile
range, or mean and standard deviation, are reported accord-
ing to degree of normality. A P value of .05 was considered
the threshold for statistical significance; all reported P values
reflect 2-sided significance tests.
Multivariable linear mixed-effects models were devel-
oped for the coprimary outcomes of memory score and de-
mentia probability. Adjustment covariates were selected
without regard to statistical significance in bivariate tests of
association and were entered sequentially according to an a
priori modeling plan. Results were qualitatively similar when
adjusting for a minimal vs a comprehensive set of covariates.
The primary coefficient of interest was the interaction be-
tweenelapsedtimesincetheyear2000andthepersistentpain
classification to describe differences in the slope of the cog-
nitivetrajectoryforparticipantswithvswithoutpersistentpain
at baseline. Individual participants’slopes and intercepts for
the cognitive trajectory were allowed to vary as random ef-
fects. Memory score was modeled without transformation; de-
mentia probability was modeled on the log-odds scale and
back-transformed using the smearing method of Duan.25 We
computed estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for the lin-
ear predictor from the mixed-effects model at different time
points using the mean values of the other covariates in the
model. To back-transform to the original scale for dementia
probability, we computed the first 2 moments and associated
95% CI of the logit-normal distribution by numerical integra-
tion.Complexsurveydesignwastakenintoaccountwithprob-
ability weights specified at the respondent level using a clus-
tered sandwich variance estimator.
The unadjusted model incorporated terms for slope and
intercept associated with persistent pain, and slope associ-
ated with advancing years in the study (ie, mean cognitive de-
cline over time). The final multivariable model (“fully-
adjusted model”) incorporated main effects and interactions
with time elapsed for those covariates not hypothesized to be
potential mediators. We included only main effects terms for
covariates identified as potential mediators.
We explored the unequal follow-up duration between the
pain and comparison groups with univariate Cox propor-
tional hazards modeling of time to death. Given evidence that
memory score and/or dementia probability may be corre-
lated with survival or study dropout, a post hoc joint model
forlongitudinalandsurvivaldatawasusedtoevaluatewhether
results were sensitive to selective survival or dropout.26
To assist with interpretation of the modeled memory score
results, we investigated the correspondence between the
acceleratedmemorylossinthosewithpersistentpainandlimi-
tations in 2 instrumental activities of daily living: indepen-
dent management of medications and of finances. To do this,
we calculated the absolute decrement in memory score at the
end of a 10-year period for a 73-year-old white woman with less
than a high school education and no health comorbidities as-
sociated with persistent pain. A hierarchical logistic regres-
sion model was used to estimate the absolute and relative in-
creased probability of self-reported inability to manage money
and inability to manage finances associated with that magni-
tude of memory score decrement, based on observed rates in
thestudycohort.Estimateswereadjustedbyagebecausethere
was a significant interaction between memory score and age
at evaluation in the prediction of financial or medication in-
dependence.
Analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS In-
stituteInc),Stata,version14.1(StataCorpLP),orR,version3.3.2
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing) statistical packages.
Results
Of the 10 065 eligible HRS sample members, 60% were fe-
male, and median baseline age was 73 years (interquartile
range, 67-78 years). Among these, 1120 (10.9% of the weighted
sample) reported persistent pain (Table 1). Baseline preva-
lence of participant-reported arthritis was 91.4% in the per-
sistent pain group and 60.0% in the comparison group. Par-
ticipants with persistent pain reported more depressive
symptoms, a greater prevalence of limitations in activities of
daily living, and more comorbid medical conditions. Pain phe-
notypes were relatively stable over time: participants with per-
sistent pain reported pain at 69% of subsequent interviews

 whereas the comparison group reported pain at only 20% of
subsequent interviews. Median follow-up included 4 subse-

view, but the persistent pain group had significantly shorter
follow-up due to an increased rate of death (Cox proportional

 cept, 0.24 memory units) but the variability in memory score
decline over time was largely unchanged (SD of random slope,
0.05 memory units per year). Participants with persistent pain
had a mean 9.2% (95% CI, 2.8%-15.0%) more rapid decline in
memory score than participants without persistent pain
(Table 2 and Figure 1; full model coefficients presented in
eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Adjusted dementia probability also increased 7.7% (95%
CI,0.55%-14.2%)fasterinthepersistentpaingroupvsthecom-
parison group (Figure 2). The absolute predicted probability
of dementia after 10 years of follow-up is 9.0 percentage points
higher for patients with persistent pain prior to covariate ad-
justment(26.7%;95%CI,22.8%-30.9%vs17.7%;95%CI,16.4%-
19.1%), and 2.2 percentage points higher in the fully-adjusted
model (22.1%; 95% CI, 18.8%-25.7% vs 19.9%; 95% CI, 18.1%-
21.8%).
After 10 years, the population-level decrement in memory
score associated with persistent pain corresponds to an abso-
lute 2.3 percentage point higher risk (95% CI, 0.8%-3.7%) of
being unable to manage finances independently and a 1.4 per-
centage point increased risk (95% CI, 0.3%-2.5%) of being un-
able to manage medications independently, relative to age-
adjusted peers. Age-adjusted population prevalence of
difficulty with financial and medication management was, re-
spectively, 19.5% and 9.0%; the absolute increased risk there-
fore reflects a relative risk increase of 11.8% for financial, and
15.9% for medication, difficulties.
Discussion
This study uses population-level cognitive data to estimate the
prognostic effect of persistent reports of pain on longitudinal
cognitive trajectory in the elderly. Over time, participants with
persistent pain experienced a 9.2% more rapid decline in
memory score. This translated to a relative 11.8% to 15.9% in-
creased risk of inability to manage medications or finances in-
dependently at the end of 10 years, compared with age-
adjusted HRS peers. The accelerated memory decline is also
compatible with the finding that population-level dementia

 probability increased 7.7% faster in those with persistent pain
compared with those without.
Elderly participants who reported persistent pain in 1998
and 2000 also reported pain in 69% of subsequent HRS inter-
views, suggesting that this approximates a chronic pain phe-
notype. Chronic pain is variably defined as pain lasting be-
yond the usual course of acute illness or injury, or more than
3 to 6 months.27 Whereas it is known that chronic pain is
associated with poorer cognitive performance in cross-
sectional studies, this study newly demonstrates accelerated
memory decline and increased probability of developing de-
mentia year-on-year at a population level. Not merely a cross-
sectional effect, the presence of persistent pain has long-
term implications for memory performance and dementia in
the elderly.
Fortheelderly,maintenanceofcognitioniscrucialforqual-
ity of life and functional independence. As many as 1 in 3 el-
ders experience chronic pain, and the social and medical bur-
den of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population
is enormous. Elucidating the nature of the relationship be-
tween pain and cognitive decline is the first step toward de-
veloping strategies to mitigate it. We consider 3 non–
mutually exclusive possibilities: first, that the association is
mediated by another factor in the causal pathway (eg, opioid
consumption); second, that pain directly compromises cog-
nitive functioning; and third, that the association is an arti-
fact of residual confounding.
Severe chronic pain is commonly treated with opioid an-
algesics. Central nervous system depression from opioid use
may be implicated in attentional and memory deficits seen in
patients with chronic pain.28 In the context of the present opi-
oid abuse epidemic, it is tempting to declare that opioid wean-
ingandliberationcouldmitigatethecognitiveimpactofchronic
pain. However, the direct effect of opioid use on cognition is
potentially confounded by the coexistence of chronic pain, de-
pression, disability, and other factors; most studies lack an ad-
equate control group.29 A recent epidemiologic study refutes
the role of opioids as a direct cause of cognitive decline:
whereas patients with chronic pain receiving opioid treat-
ment had an elevated rate of progression to dementia com-
pared with controls, patients treating their chronic pain with
onlynonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrugsexperiencednearly
identical increased dementia risk.7 This opioid-independent
association prompts consideration of potential direct effects
of chronic pain on cognition.
Although our study was not designed to demonstrate
causality,manyhypotheseshavebeenadvancedtoexplainpo-
tential mechanisms by which chronic pain may directly im-
pair cognition. The hallmarks of cognitive dysfunction asso-
ciatedwithchronicpainare(1)diminishedattentionalcapacity
and (2) impaired memory function, particularly short-term
memory.30 Pain may directly compete for cognitive process-
ing resources, diverting attention, especially when pain is
severe8andinpatientswithatendencytoruminateabouttheir
pain.8,31 Attentional impairment correlates with degree of
memory impairment, suggesting that as attention is diverted
elsewhere, memory encoding may be incomplete.8,30 Further-
more, the affective stress of chronic pain may be, as other
stressful exposures are,32,33 implicated in faster cognitive de-
cline via putative cortisol-based pathways.34,35 If these mecha-
nisms fully explain the accelerated cognitive decline that we
demonstrate here, resolution of pain would mitigate the det-
rimental cognitive effects. Classic studies do describe cogni-
tive improvement after initiation of opioid treatment, al-
though these studies were not performed in an elderly
population.36,37

 The potential role of epiphenomena, such as confound-
ing, in the relationship between chronic pain and cognitive de-
cline is plausible, given the major baseline differences be-
tween those who reported persistent pain and those who did
not. Participants with persistent pain had more depressive
symptoms, and more frequently experienced limitations in ac-
tivitiesofdailyliving.Thissuggeststhatsimplequestionsabout
pain, such as the HRS uses, may provide important insight for
clinicians into high-prevalence coexisting issues—such as de-
pression and activities of daily living limitations—and poten-
tially, subsequent problems such as accelerated cognitive de-
cline in this population. This remains a clinically relevant issue
even if the association between chronic pain and accelerated
cognitive decline is epiphenomenal. Asking about chronic pain
as part of a care visit opens discussion not only on potential
pain management topics, but also opportunities to introduce
mitigation strategies—such as assistive devices or other physi-
cal or occupational therapy interventions to address pain-
related functional limitations,38 or self-efficacy and mindful-
ness strategies to reduce the affective impact of chronic pain.39
Limitations
This study has important limitations. First, patients with
chronic pain underwent significantly fewer evaluations due
to death or dropout in comparison with the control group; al-
though our conclusions were not sensitive to this feature, the
confidence bounds for the pain group toward the end of the
follow-up period are wide and long-term conclusions are nec-
essarily limited. Second, HRS provides little information about
the source, nature, or treatment of pain. We were thus unable
to stratify participants according to common criteria (eg, opi-
oid use; joint vs back vs cancer-related pain) that would oth-
erwise have been of interest. Finally, the relationship be-
tween pain and cognitive decline is likely multifactorial and
involves many potential mediators and moderators that were
not measured in the HRS or not used in modeling, for ex-
ample, opiate, psychotropic, or anticholinergic medication
use, physical activity, and social participation. A formal me-
diation analysis, incorporating time-varying assessments of
pain, disability, and cognition, is an important topic for fu-
ture research. Due to the observational nature of these data,
we cannot draw any causal conclusions about the impact of
pain on subsequent cognition, or whether strategies to re-
duce the functional and affective impact of pain might also
improve long-term cognition.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that a persistent report of mod-
erate to severe pain, which may reflect chronic pain, is asso-
ciated with accelerated cognitive decline and increased de-
mentia probability in a large population-representative data
set of elders. Clinicians should be aware of this association,
which persisted after extensive statistical adjustment for con-
founding health and demographic factors. Patients reporting
