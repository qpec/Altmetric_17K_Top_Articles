ABSTRACT 
 
Aim 
 
Our aim was to address the clinical efficacy of open-label placebos compared with no 
treatment by systematic review, and meta-analysis where possible. 
 
Methods 
 
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-
Indexed Citations (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and clinical trials registers and screened 
reference lists. We ran the most recent search on April 27 2015. All randomised controlled 
trials of any medical condition, which had both open-label placebo and no-treatment or 
treatment as usual groups were included. Two authors independently applied the selection 
criteria and extracted data. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the 
Cochrane criteria. We used random-effects model for meta-analysis. 
 
Results 
 
After removing duplicates we screened 348 publications, assessed 24 articles for eligibility 
and identified 5 trials (260 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The clinical conditions 
were: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, allergic rhinitis, back pain and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The overall risk of bias was moderate. All 5 trials 
were eligible for meta-analysis. We found a positive effect for non-deceptive placebos 
(standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.14, P<0.00001, I2= 1%). 
 
Conclusions 
 
Open-label placebos appear to have favorable clinical outcomes, compared to no treatment or 
no additional treatment. Caution is warranted when interpreting the results due to the 
limitations including the small number of trials and lack of blinding. Larger definitive trials 
are now warranted to explore the potential patient benefit of open-label placebos.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Rationale 
 
Surveys from around the world estimate that 17%-97% of doctors have prescribed placebos—
such as dummy pills—in routine practice.(1, 2) While early estimates of placebo effects were 
exaggerated,(3, 4) it is widely acknowledged that placebos are able to offer some benefit to 
patients suffering from conditions such as pain and depression.(5-7) However, prescribing 
placebos is considered unethical because it has been presumed that it was necessary to 
deceive the patient by asserting the presence, or potential presence, of an active ingredient in 
order to achieve clinical efficacy.(8, 9) Yet several studies suggest that non-deceptive or 
‘open-label’ placebos are effective, which could remove the ethical objection to placebo use 
in clinical practice.(10-14) For example, a large study of 80 participants with irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) by Kaptchuk and colleagues randomized participants to either open-label 
placebo pills or no-treatment controls. (12) The study demonstrated significant global 
improvement for IBS symptoms at both 11 and 21 days (study endpoint) amongst the placebo 
group compared to no treatment. Yet despite a growing literature, a systematic review of 
open-label placebos has not been conducted, which makes it problematic to draw definitive 
conclusions about the effects of non-deceptive placebos.(15) A 2010 Cochrane Review of 
placebo treatments (both deceptive and open label) for all clinical conditions included some 
open label placebo studies(5) but did not assess the efficacy of non-deceptive placebos alone. 
Furthermore, studies of non-deceptive placebos compared with a no treatment arm have since 
been published, (12, 16) which highlights the need for this systematic review. 
 
How open-label placebos might work 
 
The mechanisms of action for open-label placebos are currently speculative,(17) with 
classical conditioning being the most likely candidate. A recent study of open-label placebos 
for treating pain showed that patients who had been conditioned for longer (four days) 
experienced benefits compared with patients conditions for shorter (one day) durations.(18) If 
patients have been conditioned by previous visits to the doctor—or by having taken a pill—to 
recover, then the act of receiving an open-label placebo pill could generate a positive 
response. One clinical study even suggests that the immune system can be conditioned.(19)  
Conscious expectancy may also play a role since open-label placebos are usually 
accompanied by a suggestion that the placebo is effective. Trials suggest that positive 
expectation can relieve pain, lower anxiety and reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.17 
The expectation of pain relief has been found to activate neurological systems involved in 
regulating pain, such as the dopamine reward system and the endogenous opioid system.(20) 
Daily consumption of open-label placebos may act as a daily positive autosuggestion that 
generates positive expectations. Related to classical conditioning, ‘embodied cognition’ is a 
theory that human cognition can be shaped by aspects of the body (such as the motor and 
perceptual systems, and the body’s interactions with the environment) that are beyond the 
brain alone. (21) Embodied cognition is different from conditioning in that it focuses on how 
bodily experiences can unconsciously influence a person's cognition, resulting in changes in 
thinking, behavior, and even physiology even without previous conditioning. Hence sensory 
signals could evoke different reactions including those involved in positive and negative 
healing experiences.(22, 23) For instance, the sound of the dentist's drill might trigger a 
specific bodily sensation.(22) If open-label placebos are delivered in the context of a 
healthcare setting that usually delivers a relevant stimulus, this could enhance the bodily 
reaction that influences healing. There are also ‘indirect’ mechanisms of open-label placebos, 
such as the effects of contact with therapist.(24, 25)  These mechanisms are likely to operate 
together, producing variable effects depending on the individual and the condition. 
 
Aims 
 
  
6 
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of placebos delivered non-deceptively compared 
to no treatment. 
 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Eligibility criteria 
 
We included only randomised controlled studies of placebo interventions (such as sugar pills, 
saline injections, and sham procedures) delivered ‘openly’ where there was also a ‘no 
treatment’ condition. Participants given open-label placebos must have been told they are 
receiving a placebo whereas ‘no treatment’ could include people on a waiting list, treatment 
as usual, or those simply left untreated. We included only studies of participants with a 
particular medical condition (such as pain, depression or irritable bowel syndrome). We 
excluded non-clinical studies, for example those involving healthy volunteers. We did not 
have any age, time or language restrictions. 
 
Information sources and search 
 
Searches, using the strategy listed in Appendix 1, commenced from the start date of the 
database through to 27th April 2015. We searched using, EMBASE [OvidSP] (1974 to 2015 
April 24), Medline & Medline In-process [OvidSP] (1946-present), The Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Wiley] (Issue 3 of 12, 
March 2015). In addition, we searched for proceedings of placebo-specific conferences and 
contacted experts in the field and authors of included studies for advice about other studies. 
We also searched the online clinical trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and International 
Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN). All returned records were 
combined into a Reference Manager (Endnote) database, with duplicate records removed. 
 
Study selection 
 
 
Study selection and data extraction 
 
Two authors independently screened all titles, abstracts, and full records for inclusion, with 
discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third author. Two authors extracted data 
independently from the included studies with discrepancies resolved by discussion or by 
consultation with third author. Data extraction was carried out by adapting the Cochrane 
Consumers and Communication Review Group Data Extraction Template (available at: 
http://cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources). The following items were extracted: study 
design; types of participants; description of intervention and intervention components; 
description of comparison group; completeness of outcome data; outcome measures; country; 
and funding source. 
 
Reporting of outcomes 
 
Primary outcomes, as specified by study authors, were reported (Table 1). When not stated, 
the most clinically relevant outcome was selected and a rationale provided. All other 
outcomes for the studies are presented (Table 2). A separated table detailing instructions 
given to inform participants that they received a placebo is included (Table 3).  
 
Risk of bias in individual studies 
 
  
7 
We have assessed and reported on the methodological risk of bias of included studies in 
accordance with the Cochrane Handbook,(26) which recommended explicit reporting of the 
following individual elements for randomized control trials: random sequence generation; 
allocation sequence concealment; blinding (participants, personnel, outcome assessment); 
completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. We 
judged each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria provided 
by the Cochrane Collaboration,(26) and provide a quote from the study report and a 
justification for our judgment for each item in the risk of bias table (supplementary Table 1). 
 
Studies were deemed to be at the highest risk of bias if they scored as high or unclear risk of 
bias for either of the random sequence generation or allocation concealment domains, based 
on growing empirical evidence that these factors are particularly important potential sources 
of bias.(26) Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies, with any 
disagreements resolved by discussion to reach consensus, again involving a third author 
where required. We contacted study authors for additional information about included studies, 
or to clarify study methods where required. 
 
We have also reported details of the interventions and verbal instructions that accompanied 
the open-label placebos (Table 3). 
 
Missing data 
 
We contacted study authors to obtain missing and incomplete data. Studies with missing 
outcome or summary data were identified, and we have reported this in the narrative 
description of the results. 
 
Meta-analysis 
 
Meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.3. (Copenhagen: 
The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Only studies with 
continuous measures were identified. The standardized mean difference (SMD), standard 
deviation (SD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.  
 
Assessment of heterogeneity 
 
We anticipated heterogeneity in terms of intervention modalities, conditions, outcome 
measures, patients, and effect sizes. For this reason a random effects model was used for the 
meta-analysis. 
 
The degree of heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and using the 
chi-square test for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was further quantified by using the I2 
statistic. We considered an I2 value of 50% or more as representing a substantial level of 
heterogeneity.(26) 
 
Risk of bias across studies 
 
We commented on reporting bias qualitatively based on the characteristics of the included 
studies, but have not identified sufficient studies to produce a reliable funnel plot to identify 
and quantify publication bias. 
 
Subgroup & Sensitivity Analysis 
 
There was an insufficient number of trials included to conduct the planned subgroup analyses. 
 
‘Summary of findings’ table 
  
8 
 
Our 'Summary of findings' table (Table 2) presents the results of the meta-analysis for the 
major comparisons of the review, for each of the major primary outcomes.(26) 
 
Protocol amendments 
 
We deviated from the protocol by including only clinical studies, for three reasons. Firstly, 
the clinical and non-clinical studies were qualitatively different, undermining the rationale for 
inclusion within the same systematic review. The latter mostly investigated the effects of 
decaffeinated coffee on healthy volunteers. (27-30) Secondly, the non-clinical studies lack 
clinical relevance by definition and are therefore not pertinent for a general medical audience. 
Finally, only the included studies are relevant to the question of how open-label placebos 
might be relevant to clinical practice.(31) 
 
The protocol was also amended such that ‘no additional treatment’ control groups were 
considered equivalent to ‘no treatment’ controls. This was justified as it may be unethical to 
withhold known beneficial treatment in a trial where the only intervention is a placebo. The 
effect of open label placebos can still be fairly assessed so long as the addition of placebo is 
the only difference between the control and intervention groups. Furthermore, identifying a 
strict ‘no treatment’ group is particularly difficult in a clinical trial, where enrolling and 
observing participants may result in the well-documented Hawthorne effects and hence could 
be considered an intervention themselves (explored in further in the discussion). Worthy of 
note is that this definition of a ‘no treatment’ control group is consistent with the 2010 
Cochrane Review which examined placebos against no treatment. (5) 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Summary of evidence 
 
After removing duplicates we screened 348 trials, assessed 24 articles for eligibility, and 
identified 5 trials (260 patients) that met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1).(12, 14, 16, 32, 33) 
The overall risk of bias was moderate (Figure 2). All of these were eligible for meta-analysis 
(Figure 3). We found a positive effect of non-deceptive placebos SMD) 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 
1.14, P<0.00001, I2= 1%). The conditions treated in these trials were: depression,(16) 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),(14) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (12)  
allergic rhinitis, (32) and chronic lower back pain. (33) One study reported harms,(14) and 
found a non-significant reduction in side-effects within the open-label placebo group 
compared with the treatment and control groups. 
 
Narrative summary of results 
 
Kaptchuk 2010.(12) This parallel two-group trial randomized 80 patients (70% female, mean 
age 47±18) to receive either open-label placebo pills presented as “placebo pills made of an 
inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant 
improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes” or no treatment. 
Investigators then measured the effect of the treatment on the IBS Global Improvement Scale 
(IBS-GIS, stated primary outcome). Open label placebo produced significantly higher mean 
(±SD) global improvement scores (IBS-GIS) at both 11-day midpoint (5.2±1.0 vs. 4.0±1.1) 
and at 21-day endpoint (5.0±1.5 vs. 3.9±1.3). At the 21 day endpoint the SMD was 0.78 (95% 
CI 0.32 to 1.24, P=0.0008). 
 
Kelley 2012.(16) This pilot two-group parallel trial randomized 20 patients (70% female, 
mean age 38.8±4.9) diagnosed with non-psychotic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to 
either open-label placebo (2 pills/day) or waitlist control. At baseline and after 2 weeks 
  
9 
investigators used the 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17, explicit primary 
outcome) to measure depressive symptoms. There was a positive but not statistically 
significant difference between the open-label placebo and waitlist control groups (SMD 0.51, 
95% CI -0.38 to 1.41, P=0.26). 
 
Sandler 2008.(14) This pilot parallel crossover trial of 26 children (27% female, 7-15 years 
old) randomized participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were 
receiving stimulant therapy to one of two arms: (1) 100% dose for the first week, 50% dose 
for the second week, then 50% dose + open-label placebo for the third week, or (2) 100% 
dose for the first week, 50% dose + open-label placebo for the second week, then 50% dose 
for the third week. For this review the 50% dose arm is considered the ‘no treatment’ group, 
with the 50% dose + open-label placebo arm serving as the ‘non-deceptive placebo’ group. 
Both groups therefore receive identical medication, with addition of placebo ‘treatment’ in 
the intervention group. This was deemed an appropriate amendment to the protocol,(31) as it 
would have been ethically unjustifiable to withhold treatment in the control group. The 
authors reported four primary outcomes: the IOWA Conners rating scale (separately for 
parents and teachers), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and the Pittsburgh side 
effects rating scale (PSERS), all after three weeks. Data were not reported for the teacher-
rated IOWA Conners rating scale, and we failed to obtain these data even after contacting the 
authors via email three times. We deemed CGI to be the most clinically relevant because it 
included the other measures and was therefore the most comprehensive. Physicians completed 
the CGI after interviewing parent and child, and reviewing parent and teacher IOWA and 
PSERS scales. There was an important and statistically significant benefit of open-label 
placebos 1.37 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.98, P<0.0001). 
 
Carvalho 2016. (33) This 2-group parallel trial of 83 patients with at least 3 months of 
chronic lower back pain, unprecipitated by a number of chronic health conditions as per the 
exclusion criteria. A 15 minute discussion including news clips describing advantages of 
placebos preceded treatment. Participants were randomized to receive 2 placebo tablets, taken 
twice daily, or treatment as usual, for 3 weeks. All participants were again primed towards 
placebo for 10-15 minutes at the mid-point review. All participants remained on their usual 
analgesia. Primary outcomes were mean weekly retrospective pain assessments (0-10) and the 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) assessed at 3 weeks, which addresses more 
functional consequences of pain. Mean ‘bothersomeness’ was a secondary outcome. We took 
RMDQ to be the most relevant clinical outcome for the meta-analysis. In isolation, RMDQ 
showed a significantly greater effect by open-label placebo compared to treatment as usual 
(SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.18, P<0.001). 
 
Schaefer 2016. (32) This 2-group randomised controlled trial of 25 participants with 
physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis compared open-label placebo pills against treatment as 
usual for two weeks. Participants were recruited via flyers and social media, and were all on 
usual medication (unspecified). Once recruited, participants completed a symptom severity 
questionnaire (scoring 1-7) and a subjective wellbeing checklist (SF-12). At randomisation 
open-label placebo patients (n=11) had a non-significantly greater symptom severity than the 
treatment as usual (n=14) group (mean and SD 3.55 ± 0.73, compared to 3.11 ± 0.66, 
respectively, P>0.1). Following the two-week trial no significant reduction was observed in 
any single symptom severity or wellbeing. The reduction in overall symptom severity was 
significantly greater amongst the open-label placebo group, compared with the treatment as 
usual group (SMD 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.01, P=0.009). 
 
Risk of bias 
 
As shown in Figure 2, overall, the studies had a moderate risk of bias. Participants in the 
studies were, by definition, unblinded, and all but one of the studies used unblinded outcome 
assessors.(16) None of the studies were at a high risk of bias for incomplete outcome 
  
10 
reporting or selective reporting. Three of the studies were at an unclear risk of bias for 
incomplete outcome data.(12, 16, 33)Two of the studies was at a high risk of ‘other’ bias. 
These were because data in Sandler et al., were not presented for the teacher-reported 
outcome measure, although this was commented on in the text,(14) and Schaefer et al., had a 
trend toward higher symptom severity within the placebo-treated group and did not describe 
participants at baseline with respect to their allergic triggers (see Supplementary Table 1). 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Summary of evidence 
 
We found that open-label placebos have a statistically significant, medium-sized effect across 
the 3 randomised trials that were included. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic 
review to evaluate the effect of open-label placebos. However, the results of this meta-
analysis should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies, the small 
sample sizes of the included studies, the moderate risk of bias identified and the heterogeneity 
of sample populations (children and adults), clinical conditions, and reporting methods.  
 
Comparison with existing evidence 
 
Systematic reviews of placebos in general show a small but statistically significant benefit of 
placebos. (5, 34) The effect size estimate for open-label placebos in the current systematic 
review and meta-analysis is larger than previous estimates for deceptively delivered placebos, 
suggesting the possibility that open-label placebos may have effects that are equal to, or 
perhaps even larger than, deceptive placebos.  
 
However, the evidence for the efficacy of placebos delivered in blinded conditions is much 
more robust. Moreover, given that conscious expectancy is presumably less powerful when 
placebos are delivered openly, it is often suggested that open-label placebos are likely to be 
less effective than placebos delivered deceptively. Despite this, we are aware of only four 
studies that compare the physiological outcomes of open-label and deceptively delivered 
placebos,(27-30) and none reported a significant difference between the open-label.  
 
Strengths and weaknesses [STATISTICAL HETEROGENEITY LOW] 
 
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of open-label 
placebos. It provides evidence to suggest that open-label placebos provide symptom relief to 
patients suffering from IBS, depression, allergic rhinitis, chronic lower back pain and ADHD. 
The key limitation was size: there were 5 studies (260 patients) eligible for inclusion. This 
made it difficult to assess the risk of publication bias. Two of the five included studies were 
carried out by the same author, suggesting the need for additional independent replication 
within this field.  
 
Furthermore, some of the interventions included explicit positive suggestions alongside the 
open-label placebo,(12, 14, 33) making the effects of non-deceptive placebos difficult to 
distinguish from benefits of positive framing.(35) Reporting bias in the individual studies 
might have arisen due to inherent lack of blinding for the participants and caregivers within 
the included studies. However, in one of the included studies outcomes were assessed by 
blinded observers,(16) and non-deceptive placebos were statistically significant in this study 
alone. Another limitation is that in some cases the authors had to judge the most clinically 
relevant outcome of a study, we address this by providing a rationale in table 1 and have 
reported on all outcomes separately (Table 2). Finally, while statistical heterogeneity was low 
(due to the consistently positive effect), the studies varied in terms of participants 
(children/adults), conditions (IBS, depression, allergic rhinitis, back pain and ADHD), control 
  
11 
interventions (no treatment versus waiting list versus treatment as usual) and outcome 
measures. 
 
Conclusions and implications 
 
Open-label placebos may have a medium sized effect that may help reduce symptoms in 
patients with some medical outcomes. Our results also point towards a way to overcome the 
ethical barrier to using placebos in clinical practice,(36) although replacement of known 
effective treatment with placebos (open label or not) would remain unethical. Moreover the 
limited number of studies and moderate risk of bias suggest caution in drawing any definitive 
clinical conclusions. Independent replication with a large high quality randomized trial is now 
warranted, together with evaluation of clinician and patient attitudes towards open label 
placebo use.

Study 
Open label placebo 
Verbal instructions (if included) 
Kaptchuk 2010 
“Placebo pills were blue and 
maroon gelatin capsules filled 
with Avicel, a common inert 
excipient for pharmaceuticals” 
“The provider clearly explained that the placebo pill was an 
inactive (i.e., ‘‘inert’’) substance like a sugar pill that contained 
no medication and then explained in an approximately fifteen 
minute a priori script the following ‘‘four discussion points:’’ 1) 
the placebo effect is powerful, 2) the body can automatically 
respond to taking placebo pills like Pavlov’s dogs who salivated 
when they heard a bell, 3) a positive attitude helps but is not  
necessary, and 4) taking the pills faithfully is critical.” 
Kelley 2012 
“Blue capsules containing 
microcrystalline cellulose.” 
“Patients were instructed to take two placebo pills, twice daily.“ 
Sandler 2008 
“a visually distinctive placebo 
capsule” 
“This little capsule is a placebo. Placebos have been used a lot in 
treating people. It is called ‘Dose Extender’. As you can see, it’s 
different from Adderall. (Describe its features). Dose Extender is 
something new. It has no drug in it. I can promise you that it 
won’t hurt you at all. It has no real side effects. But it may help 
you to help yourself. It may work well with your Adderall, kind 
of like a booster to the dose of Adderall. That’s why it’s called a 
Dose Extender. I won’t be surprised when I hear from you and 
your parents and your teachers that you’re able to control your 
ADHD better. For the next 4 weeks, every time you take your 
Adderall, you will also take your Dose Extender. This will really 
give them a chance to work well together. Okay? Do you have 
any questions about Dose Extender?” 
Carvalho 2016 
“A typical prescribed medicine 
bottle of placebo pills with a 
label clearly marked “placebo 
pills” and “take 2 pills twice a 
day.” The placebo pills were 
Swedish Orange gelatin capsules 
filled with microcrystalline 
cellulose, a common inert 
excipient for pharmaceuticals” 
“The PI explained that the placebo pill was an inactive substance, 
like a flour pill, that contained no active medication in it. After 
informed consent, all participants were asked if they had heard of 
the “placebo effect” and explained in an approximately 15-
minute a priori script, adopted from an earlier OLP study,18 the 
following “4 discussion points”: (1) the placebo effect can be 
powerful, (2) the body automatically can respond to taking 
placebo pills like Pavlov dogs who salivated when they heard a 
bell, (3) a positive attitude can be helpful but is not necessary, 
and (4) taking the pills faithfully for the 21 days is critical. All 
participants were also shown a video clip (1 minute 25 seconds) 
of a television news report, in which participants in an OLP trial 
of irritable bowel syndrome were interviewed (excerpted from: 
http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-
news/40787382#40787382)” 
Schaefer 2016 
“The placebo group received a 
white tube containing 28 placebo 
pills. The tube was labeled with 
the logo of the local university 
and the following information: 
‘placebo pills (28), take one in 
the morning and one before night 
for 14 days’.” 
“We explained that placebos are inactive substances and that they 
contain no medications. Participants were further told that 
although placebos contain no medication, placebo effects may 
still be powerful. The effect was explained to them by pointing 
out that the body may automatically respond to taking placebo 
pills, like Pavlov’s dogs that salivated when they heard the bell. 
In addition, they were told that a positive attitude may be helpful 
for the placebo effect, but is not necessary. Last, they were told 
  
15 
that those participants who were in the placebo group needed to 
take the placebos faithfully.”
