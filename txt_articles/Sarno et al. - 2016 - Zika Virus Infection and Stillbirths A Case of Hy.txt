Abstract
Background
The rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas and current outbreak of microcephaly in Bra-
zil has raised attention to the possible deleterious effects that the virus may have on
fetuses.
Methodology/Principal Findings
We report a case of a 20-year-old pregnant woman who was referred to our service after a
large Zika virus outbreak in the city of Salvador, Brazil with an ultrasound examination that
showed intrauterine growth retardation of the fetus at the 18th gestational week. Ultrasound
examinations in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters demonstrated severe microcephaly, hydranence-
phaly, intracranial calcifications and destructive lesions of posterior fossa, in addition to
hydrothorax, ascites and subcutaneous edema. An induced labor was performed at the
32nd gestational week due to fetal demise and delivered a female fetus. ZIKV-specific real-
time polymerase chain reaction amplification products were obtained from extracts of cere-
bral cortex, medulla oblongata and cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid, while extracts of heart,
lung, liver, vitreous body of the eye and placenta did not yield detectable products.
Conclusions/Significance
This case report provides evidence that in addition to microcephaly, there may be a link
between Zika virus infection and hydrops fetalis and fetal demise. Given the recent spread
of the virus, systematic investigation of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths may be war-
ranted to evaluate the risk that ZIKV infection imparts on these outcomes.

 Author Summary
The rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas and outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil has
raised attention to the possible deleterious effects that the virus may have on fetuses. We
report a case of a 20-year-old pregnant woman from Salvador, Brazil whose fetus had
developed hydrops fetalis, a condition where there is abnormal accumulation of fluid in
the fetus, as well as severe central nervous system defects such as microcephaly and hydra-
nencephaly. After fetal demise, ZIKV RNA was detected in central nervous system tissues
and amniotic fluid. The case report provides evidence that in addition to microcephaly,
there may be a link between Zika virus infection and hydrops fetalis and fetal demise.
Given the recent spread of the virus, systematic investigation of spontaneous abortions
and stillbirths may be warranted to evaluate the risk that ZIKV infection imparts on these
outcomes.
Introduction
The current outbreak of microcephaly has raised speculations that Zika virus (ZIKV) causes a
congenital syndrome. ZIKV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was detected in Brazil in early 2015
[1,2] and has rapidly spread throughout the Americas [3]. A large increase in the number of
newborns with microcephaly was subsequently identified in Brazil in November 2015. At pres-
ent, more than 4,500 microcephaly cases have been reported [4]. ZIKV has been detected in
few cases, seven in total to date, of fetuses and newborns who died shortly after birth, all of
whom had ultrasound abnormalities or pathological lesions which were restricted to the central
nervous system [5–7]. Herein, we report a case of a fetus that in addition to hydranencephaly,
developed hydrops fetalis and fetal demise in association with congenital ZIKV infection.
Methods
While conducting an outbreak investigation in Salvador, Brazil, we identified a patient who
was referred to Hospital Geral Roberto Santos with an abnormal fetal ultrasound examination
and followed during outpatient evaluations. After fetal demise and induced labor, tissues aspi-
rates and fragments were collected by needle aspiration and thoraco-abdominal viscerotomy,
respectively, since an autopsy could not be performed. RNA was extracted and tested by a
ZIKV-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase transcriptase assay (RT-PCR) [8].
Results
We assumed the care for a 20-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 1) in the 18th week of gestation
whose ultrasound examination showed low fetal weight. The patient procured prenatal care
during the 4th gestational week in July, 2015 at which time she was found to have a negative
serology for HIV, HTLV and hepatitis C viruses and positive IgG and negative IgM ELISA
results for toxoplasmosis, rubella virus and cytomegalovirus. She had an uneventful course of
pregnancy with a normal ultrasound evaluation at the 14th gestational week. In the 18th week,
ultrasound examination found that the fetus had a weight three standard deviations below the
mean value for gestational age.
On referral, the patient did not report an episode of rash, fever, or body pain or receiving a
diagnosis for zika, chikungunya or dengue virus infection during the pregnancy. She denied a
family history of an illness suggestive of a Zika virus infection or congenital disorders. Her clin-
ical evaluation was unremarkable. Ultrasound examinations performed at the 26th and 30th

 gestational weeks showed microcephaly, hydranencephaly with minimal residual cortical
parenchyma (Fig 1, Panel A), intracranial calcifications and destructive lesions of posterior
fossa (Fig 1, Panel B). The examinations were also significant for the findings of hydrothorax,
ascites and subcutaneous edema (Fig 1, Panels C and D).
An induced labor was performed when ultrasound examination in the 32nd gestational week
showed fetal demise and delivered a female fetus with a weight of 930g and signs of microceph-
aly and arthrogryposis. We obtained ZIKV-specific RT-PCR amplification products from
extracts of cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata and cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid. Analysis
of extracts of heart, lung, liver, vitreous body of the eye and placenta did not yield detectable
products. Amplification products mapped within the NS5 gene of ZIKV strains belonging to
the Asian lineage, with closest relationship to sequences from French Polynesian and Surinam-
ese strains. The patient gave consent to have her case details published.
Discussion
Attention has focused on the deleterious effects that the ZIKV may have on fetuses due to the
rapid global spread of virus and the current outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil. ZIKV has been
detected in a small number of cases of fetuses and newborns with microcephaly who have been
identified during the outbreak [5–7]. This case report of a fetus provides additional evidence
for the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly. Furthermore, it serves as an alert to cli-
nicians that in addition to central nervous system and ophthalmological manifestations [6,7,9],
congenital ZIKV infection may cause hydrops fetalis and fetal demise.
Since the majority (73%) of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic [10], it is likely that expo-
sures in pregnant women, such as in the case of our patient, often go unnoticed. We could not

 document acute infection in the mother and discard the possibility, albeit unlikely, that the
severe manifestations, observed in this case, was caused by another process and intrauterine
ZIKV infection occurred afterwards. The first indication of an abnormal pregnancy was the
ultrasound finding of intrauterine growth retardation in the 18th gestational week. The more
plausible explanation is that asymptomatic exposure of the mother, prior to this date and likely
in the 1st trimester, caused an intrauterine infection which in turn, resulted in hydranencephaly
and hydrops fetalis in the fetus.
The finding of an association between ZIKV infection and hydrops fetalis suggests that the
virus may cause damage to tissues in addition to the fetal central nervous system. Recent
autopsy studies found that histopathologic findings and detection of ZIKV in newborns and
fetuses with microcephaly were limited to the brain and in some cases, placenta [6,7], indicat-
ing that the virus, unlike common congenital viral infections, exhibits tropism to a limited
range of tissues. We detected ZIKV RNA in the central nervous system and amniotic fluid and
not in heart, lung, liver or placenta, yet our findings were limited by the sampling procedure
and lack of histopathological analysis of tissues. The mechanism by which ZIKV may cause
hydrops fetalis therefore remains speculative.
We cannot extrapolate from this single case the overall risk for developing hydrops fetalis
and fetal demise among pregnant women exposed to the virus. The strain detected in this case
of fetal demise appears to be the same as the epidemic strain that has spread across the Ameri-
cas and Caribbean [6,11]. Given that large numbers of pregnant women in the region have
been or will be exposed to this strain, systematic investigation of spontaneous abortions and
stillbirths may be warranted to evaluate the risk that ZIKV infection imparts on these
outcomes.
