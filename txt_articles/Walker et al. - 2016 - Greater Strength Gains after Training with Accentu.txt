As training experience increases it becomes more challenging to induce further
neuromuscular adaptation. Consequently, strength trainers seek alternative training
methods in order to further increase strength and muscle mass. One method is to utilize
accentuated eccentric loading, which applies a greater external load during the eccentric
phase of the lift as compared to the concentric phase. Based upon this practice,
the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 10 weeks of accentuated
eccentric loading vs. traditional isoinertial resistance training in strength-trained men.
Young (22 ± 3 years, 177 ± 6 cm, 76 ± 10 kg, n = 28) strength-trained men (2.6 ± 2.2
years experience) were allocated to concentric-eccentric resistance training in the form
of accentuated eccentric load (eccentric load = concentric load + 40%) or traditional
resistance training, while the control group continued their normal unsupervised training
program. Both intervention groups performed three sets of 6-RM (session 1) and three
sets of 10-RM (session 2) bilateral leg press and unilateral knee extension exercises
per week. Maximum force production was measured by unilateral isometric (110◦ knee
angle) and isokinetic (concentric and eccentric 30◦.s−1) knee extension tests, and work
capacity was measured by a knee extension repetition-to-failure test. Muscle mass
was assessed using panoramic ultrasonography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.
Surface electromyogram amplitude normalized to maximum M-wave and the twitch
interpolation technique were used to examine maximal muscle activation. After training,
maximum isometric torque increased significantly more in the accentuated eccentric
load group than control (18 ± 10 vs. 1 ± 5%, p < 0.01), which was accompanied
by an increase in voluntary activation (3.5 ± 5%, p < 0.05). Isokinetic eccentric torque
increased significantly after accentuated eccentric load training only (10 ± 9%, p < 0.05),
whereas concentric torque increased equally in both the accentuated eccentric load (10
± 9%, p < 0.01) and traditional (9 ± 6%, p < 0.01) resistance training groups; however,
the increase in the accentuated eccentric load group was significantly greater (p < 0.05)
than control (1 ± 7%). Knee extension repetition-to-failure improved in the accentuated
eccentric load group only (28%, p < 0.05). Similar increases in muscle mass occurred in

increases in maximum force production, work capacity and muscle activation, but not

INTRODUCTION
Both the maintenance and improvement of strength and muscle
mass are important goals of physical training interventions in a
variety of populations (Voet et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2014), with
resistance training being the most popular method for achieving
these outcomes. While it should be acknowledged that distinctly
different training programs have led to similar increases in
strength and muscle mass during short-term training (Burd et al.,
2012; Cadore et al., 2014), training intensity has been observed
in some studies to be a key factor mediating adaptive responses
(Anderson and Kearney, 1982; Campos et al., 2002; Wernbom
et al., 2007). In a review of the literature (Fry, 2004), training
intensity could explain ∼18–35% of the variance in hypertrophy,
and was also an important factor in maximum strength gain.
Training
using
mechanically
driven
isokinetic
devices
allows the individuals to perform (near)maximal contractions
during both concentric and eccentric actions. Studies utilizing
these devises have shown that performing concentric-only or
eccentric-only actions in previously untrained subjects has led
to similar gains in maximum isometric and/or concentric force
production (Seger and Thorstensson, 2005; Franchi et al., 2015)
and that training with fast eccentric-only actions can lead to
increased torque during fast concentric actions (Paddon-Jones
et al., 2001). Nonetheless, training with eccentric-only actions
is thought to be particularly beneficial for muscle hypertrophy
compared to concentric-only actions (Higbie et al., 1996; Vikne
et al., 2006). Furthermore, studies have shown that the addition
of eccentric actions to concentric training has resulted in
significant improvements in force production capacity when
compared to training with concentric actions alone (Häkkinen
and Komi, 1981; Colliander and Tesch, 1990; Dudley et al.,
1991). On the other hand, some studies have shown a reduced
efficacy for eccentric-only training to elicit improvements in
concentric force production (Komi and Buskirk, 1972; Higbie
et al., 1996; Hortobágyi et al., 1996; Reeves et al., 2009; Roig et al.,
2009), which has led to suggestions of action-specific adaptations
due to training with eccentric-only actions.
In contrast to the above mentioned studies, where the subjects
can produce a (near)maximal contraction, traditional isoinertial
resistance training consists of lifting (concentric), and lowering
(eccentric) an identical externally-imposed load. For example,
traditional isoinertial resistance training methods, where the
same absolute load is lifted and then lowered, may not provide an
optimal stimulus in the eccentric phase of the lift. Conceptually,
the potential sub-optimal loading during the eccentric phase
with traditional isoinertial resistance training is based upon
data showing that peak force production capacity is greater
during eccentric muscle actions (Katz, 1939). Hence, the relative
load used during the eccentric phase in traditional isoinertial
resistance training is less than during the concentric phase. This
submaximal loading results in lower motor unit recruitment
and firing rates during the eccentric phase (Søgaard et al.,
1996), which would trigger less sarcoplasmic calcium release and
possibly a lesser stimulus for myocellular adaptation (Gehlert
et al., 2015). This may be one reason why experienced strength
trainers seek alternative training methods in order to further
increase strength and muscle mass. Thus, the development of
other training strategies to overcome the limitations of traditional
resistance training is warranted.
One such strategy may be the use of “accentuated eccentric
loading” resistance training, where traditional concentric-
eccentric resistance training is performed but an additional
external load is imposed during the eccentric phase. Over
seven consecutive days, Hortobagyi and colleagues observed
greater improvements in both eccentric and isometric, but
not concentric, knee extension force production in young
(Hortobágyi et al., 2001), and older women (Hortobágyi and
DeVita, 2000) following accentuated eccentric load training,
which were accompanied by increased vastus lateralis muscle
activity (i.e., EMG amplitude). Subsequently, 5 weeks of training
using a flywheel system resulted in two-fold increases in
quadriceps muscle volume in the accentuated eccentric load
group compared to traditional isoinertial resistance training
(+6.2 vs. +3.0%), although no statistically significant differences
between groups were observed (Norrbrand et al., 2008). More
recently, Friedmann-Bette et al. (2010) reported increases in
squat jump performance and type IIx fiber cross-sectional area
after 6 weeks of accentuated eccentric load in concurrently-
training male athletes. In high level volleyball players, using
accentuated eccentric loading prior to vertical jumping led to
improved countermovement jump performance whereas no
change occurred in the group using body weight only (Sheppard
et al., 2008). Longer term studies (e.g., 12–16 weeks) in elderly
subjects investigating elongated eccentric phase (Dias et al.,
2015) and unilateral eccentric following bilateral concentric
actions (Raj et al., 2012) showed similar improvements
to traditional resistance training in various functional capacity
tests. Furthermore, greater increases in strength were observed in
some resistance exercises but not others compared to traditional
resistance training, and any potential benefit of accentuated
eccentric loading did not appear to influence functional capacity
test results (Nichols et al., 1995). Nonetheless, no studies have
explicitly examined the effects of accentuated eccentric load
resistance training aiming to improve maximum strength and
muscle mass.
The above studies indicate a potential for accentuated
eccentric loading to improve strength and muscle mass,

Improvements during Accentuated Eccentric Load Training
particularly during short-term interventions in experienced
strength trainers, but they do not allow strong conclusions to be
drawn about the efficacy of training with accentuated eccentric
loads. An additional issue is that little information detailing
the neuromuscular adaptations associated with such training
has been presented, hence it is unclear which neuromuscular
adaptations might be enhanced in comparison to those elicited
by traditional forms of resistance training. It is currently
unclear, therefore, how this training strategy might augment
force production in strength-trained individuals. Consequently,
the aim of the present study was to examine the effects
of 10 weeks (i.e., 2 × 5-weeks mesocycles) of lower-limb
accentuated eccentric load resistance training on maximum
force production, muscle activation, and muscle hypertrophy
in subjects accustomed to resistance training. We hypothesized
that greater increases in muscle strength, activation and size
would result from accentuated eccentric loading than traditional
isoinertial training in strength-trained men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study utilized a twin-control group design. A standard
control group (CON) continued their normal training without
supervision but completed the same testing as the accentuated
eccentric load-training group (AEL). The subjects in this group
all reported using a split-routine training program without
specific focus (i.e., all body parts targeted equally) and their aim
was to improve overall strength and muscle mass. A second
group performed a traditional concentric-eccentric isoinertial
training program (TRAD) under the same supervision and
dietary conditions as the AEL group. This type of training
group may be considered a true control because subjects are
exposed to the same study conditions as the experimental group
(Newton et al., 1999). The AEL group performed the same
training as TRAD but used greater loading during the eccentric
phase, as described in detail below. Subjects in TRAD and AEL
were instructed to continue with their normal exercise program
for the upper limbs while resistance training of the legs was
restricted to the present study’s training program during the
10-week period.
Before entering the intervention phase of the study, subjects
underwent background screening and then attended four
laboratory-based sessions, each separated by 3–4 days. During the
first visit, the subjects were familiarized with the test procedures
and practiced the strength tests. During the following visits, the
subjects; (1) completed body composition assessment using dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) after an overnight fast, (2)
had their quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) measured using
ultrasound imaging, and (3) performed unilateral isometric and
isokinetic knee extension tests.
These three test sessions were repeated by the intervention
groups (TRAD and AEL) after 5 and 10 weeks of training
and by the standard control group (CON) after 10 weeks
(Figure 1). After 5 and 10 weeks of training, session 1 (DXA) was
completed 3–4 days after the last training session with sessions 2
(ultrasound) and 3 (strength tests) being completed in 1–3 days
intervals so that the strength tests always took place 7 days after
the last training session.
Subjects
Thirty-three healthy, young men agreed to participate in the
study after being informed of all the risks and providing signed
informed consent. The subjects had previous experience of
resistance training (2.6 ± 2.2 years, range: 0.5–6 years). Five
subjects (2 TRAD and 3 AEL) withdrew from the study during
the 10-week training period (1 exercise-induced headache, 2
muscle soreness, 1 other commitments, 1 gave no reason).
Therefore, 28 subjects (age 21 ± 3 years, height 177 ± 7 cm,
body mass 75 ± 11 kg) completed all study requirements. The
study methods were approved by the Human Research Ethics
committee at Edith Cowan University and conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki.
The subjects were matched (into groups of three subjects) pre-
intervention by body mass and neuromuscular strength, and then
randomly assigned to AEL (age 21 ± 2 years, height 179 ± 8 cm,
body mass 76 ± 11 kg; n = 10), TRAD (age 21 ± 2 years, height
178 ± 7 cm, body mass 78 ± 12 kg; n = 10), or CON (age 24 ± 4
years, height 176 ± 3 cm, body mass 75 ± 7 kg; n = 8). Subjects
completed training diaries throughout the study to document all
exercise performed outside of the study.
Training Intervention
TRAD and AEL engaged in two 5-week training periods where
training was performed twice a week (Monday and Thursday
or Tuesday and Friday, to allow at least 48 h recovery between
training sessions). Training consisted of three sets of 6-RM
(session 1) and 10-RM (session 2) bilateral leg press and unilateral
knee extension and flexion exercises. Since the aim of training
was to increase maximum strength and muscle size, the repetition
ranges chosen for each session utilized the stimulating effect of
high force and high volume training, respectively. Each subject
had their training and testing time standardized throughout
the study (±1 h). TRAD performed the exercises with the
same load for both concentric and eccentric phases, while
AEL performed the exercises with 40% greater load during the
eccentric phase compared to the concentric phase (i.e., eccentric
load = concentric load + 40%), which was a similar loading
protocol to those used by Brandenburg and Docherty (2002) and
Ojasto and Häkkinen (2009). In order for each training session
to include a true RM, both TRAD and AEL used loads that
elicited concentric failure in at least 1 out of 3 sets with the
investigator assisting the subject to complete the set. Custom
weight-releasers were used to add the additional eccentric load
to the leg press exercise (Figure 2A) while weight plates were
manually added and removed by the training supervisor(s) with
the use of a custom-built pin for the knee extension exercise
(Figure 2B). Both groups performed the concentric and eccentric
phases of the lift with a 2:2 s tempo (i.e., 4 s in total), which was
monitored by the investigator. Immediately after each training
session TRAD and AEL subjects were given a standardized
recovery drink containing 23 g of whey protein (8.47 g leucine
and 5.08 g isoleucine per 100 g), 3 g of carbohydrate, and 1.6 g
of fat (Total+, Vital Strength, PowerFoods International Pty.

initial protein synthesis response to training and standardize
post-exercise nutrition between groups.
Familiarization Session
All subjects completed a familiarization session 1 week prior
to performance testing (Figure 1). Strength tests (isokinetic
followed by isometric) were performed with the right leg until
peak torque values in three consecutive attempts were within
5%. Subjects were positioned in an isokinetic dynamometer
(Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, USA) so
that their knee joint was in-line with the axis of rotation and
inelastic straps were placed across the shoulders, hips, thigh, and
ankle to minimize extraneous movement. The limits of motion
were set so that each subject performed concentric followed
by eccentric knee extensions from a 90◦ knee angle to a 150◦
knee angle (straight leg and full knee extension = 180◦). Three
concentric-eccentric warm-up repetitions were performed at an
estimated 50% and then 75% of perceived maximum exertion at
30◦.s−1 before performing two sets of three maximal repetitions
separated by 1 min. Thereafter, the subjects were positioned into
a custom-built isometric dynamometer (Edith Cowan University,
Joondalup, Australia). The knee angle was set to 110◦ with a hip
angle of 100◦ and subjects were secured firmly by inelastic straps
across the shoulders, hips, and ankle. Each subject was allowed 3–
5 practice trials following the commands “push as fast and as hard
as you can.” Real-time visual feedback was provided to instruct
the subject to rapidly achieve maximum torque and maintain the
contraction for 3–4 s.
Surface Electromyography
Bipolar surface electromyogram (EMG) electrodes (2 cm center-
to-center inter-electrode distance, MediTrace 200, Kendall,
Mansfield USA) were placed on the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus
medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF)
muscle bellies according to SENIAM guidelines after shaving and
lightly abrading the skin. Raw EMG signals were pre-amplified
(ZeroWire, Aurion Ltd., Milan, Italy), passed via WiFi to a
receiving box, relayed to a 16-bit A/D converter (PowerLab
system, AD Instruments Ltd., Bella Vista, Australia) and sampled
at an analog-to-digital conversion rate of 2000 Hz at a band width
of 10–1000 Hz (common-mode rejection ratio = 100 dB). EMG
signals were further filtered using a band width of 10–350 Hz
offline then assessed by root mean square (RMS) analysis over
the 60◦ range of motion during isokinetic trials. For isometric
trials, average EMGRMS amplitude was measured over 500 ms
in the torque plateau (including the point of instantaneous peak

torque). During analysis, EMGRMS data were averaged for the VL
and VM (i.e., VL + VM/2) and superficial quadriceps muscles
(i.e., VL + VM + RF/3) for both isokinetic and isometric actions.
Electrical Stimulation Procedures (M-Wave
Measurement)
To
obtain
the
maximal
M-wave
amplitude
for
EMG
normalization (i.e., calculation of EMG:M-wave ratio), single
square-pulse (400 V, 200 µs duration) electrical stimulations
were given by a constant current stimulator (Model DS7AH,
Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK) to the femoral
nerve through 5 cm2 self-adhesive electrodes (Hollywog LLC,
Chattanooga, USA) placed in the femoral triangle either side
of the nerve (identified by palpating and locating the femoral
artery). The electrodes were moved slightly until the greatest
knee extension twitch torque was achieved with a low stimulation
intensity. The intensity was then increased until there were no
further increases in peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude of VL,
VM, or RF or the torque response (typically 300–500 mA). To
ensure maximal activation, an additional 20% current was used
to induce three maximum single-pulse twitches. The highest
value was used to normalize voluntary EMG data during the
knee extension tests.
Maximum Isokinetic Knee Extension Tests
Following a 5-min warm-up using a cycle ergometer at a
cadence of 70 rpm with 1 kg of resistance (Monark 818E,
Monark Ergomedic, Sweden), the subjects were positioned in
the isokinetic dynamometer and firmly secured as described
above. One warm-up set of three concentric-eccentric repetitions
was performed at 80% of perceived maximum exertion.
Thereafter, two sets of three repetitions were performed with
maximum voluntary exertion at 30◦s−1. The velocity of the
isokinetic actions was chosen to closely resemble the tempo
performed during training. Torque and displacement data
were synchronously recorded at a rate of 2000 Hz using
LabChart software (version 6.1.3, AD Instruments, Dunedin,
New Zealand) for offline analysis. During analysis, torque,
and displacement signals were low-pass filtered (20 Hz cut-
off frequency; Butterworth 4th order). The concentric and
eccentric phases were identified from the displacement data and
the highest torque values for each action were obtained for
further analysis. Test-retest reliabilities [intra-class correlation
coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV%)] for
concentric and eccentric peak torques were 0.903 and 4.7% and
0.947 and 5.6%, respectively.
Maximum Isometric Knee Extension Tests
Subjects
were
positioned
into
a
custom-built
isometric
dynamometer and performed unilateral isometric knee extension
trials as described above. Three trials were performed, with a
fourth trial being required if the third trial yielded more than
5% greater torque compared to the previous trials. Loud, verbal
encouragement was given throughout each trial and real-time
feedback was provided to the subjects. Torque data were sampled
and filtered as described for the isokinetic trials. Analysis was
performed offline and assessed for maximum torque. Test-retest
reliability for isometric torque was 0.949 (ICC) and 4.1% (CV%).
Maximum isometric actions with superimposed femoral
nerve stimulation were subsequently performed with the torque
increasing to a maximum over ∼2 s and then being maintained
for ∼4 s. To determine the stimulation intensity, double-pulse
(10 ms inter-pulse interval) stimulations were delivered until
a plateau in the torque response was observed (typically 400–
700 mA) and then an additional 20% current was given to
ensure maximal activation. Three trials were performed with
two double-pulse stimulations given at the torque plateau and
a double-pulse stimulation given two seconds after relaxation.
Only trials that achieved an MVC >95% of the non-stimulation
trials were included in further analyses. Prior to data filtering, the
torque deflection due to electrical stimulation during contraction
and at rest following the contraction was determined. Voluntary
activation level (VA%) was estimated by the following formula;
VA% = [1 −
(superimposed twitch torque
−maximum voluntary torque)
(resting twitch torque)
] × 100
Test-retest reliabilities (ICC and CV%) for voluntary activation
level were 0.69 and 4.4%.
One-Repetition Maximum Knee Extension
Tests
Intervention
group
subjects
performed
a
unilateral
knee
extension one-repetition maximum (1-RM) test with the right
leg during the first and last week of training (VR3 leg
extension, Cybex International Inc., Medway, USA). Each subject
performed 5 min cycling (1 kg load at 70 rpm) as warm-up
followed by a series of submaximal warm-up sets (6 reps at an
estimated 10-RM load, 3 reps at an estimated 6-RM load, 1 rep
at an estimated 3-RM load). Thereafter, single repetitions were
performed until the subject could no longer lift the load from the
beginning knee angle of ∼85◦ to the required knee angle (∼170◦
knee angle), which was set by a rubber stopper fitted to the device.
The last successfully lifted load was recorded as the subject’s 1-
RM. Test-retest reliabilities (ICC and CV%) for 1-RM were 0.99
and 2.4%.
Repetition-To-Failure Tests
Three days after the unilateral 1-RM test, the subjects in
the intervention group performed a unilateral knee extension
repetition-to-failure test with 75% of their 1-RM load using the
right leg. Thus, the same relative load, but different absolute
load, was lifted before vs. after the training period. Subjects
were instructed to maintain a cadence of 2 s concentric and 2 s
eccentric phases, which was monitored by the investigator, and to
perform as many repetitions as possible. The test was terminated
when the subject was unable to lift the load to the rubber stopper
for two successive repetitions and only successful repetitions were
used in further analysis. Test-retest reliabilities (ICC and CV%)
for 1-RM were 0.872 and 8.7%.

Muscle Cross-Sectional Area
VL, VM, RF, and vastus intermedius (VI) cross-sectional area
(CSA) were assessed using B-mode axial-plane ultrasound
(model SSD-α10, Aloka Co Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a 10
MHz linear-array probe (60 mm width) in extended-field-of-view
mode (23 Hz sampling frequency). The validity and reliability of
this method, as well as the general scanning technique have been
reported previously (Ahtiainen et al., 2010; Noorkoiv et al., 2010).
In the present study, three axial-plane panoramic CSA images
were taken each at 33, 50, and 67% femur length measured from
the lateral aspect of the distal diaphysis to the greater trochanter.
CSA was determined by manually tracing along the border of
the each muscle using Image-J software (version 1.37, National
Institute of Health, USA). As there is no observable aponeurosis
between VL and VI at 67% femur length, these muscles were
analyzed by tracing the borders of both muscles combined. The
mean of the two closest values was taken as the CSA result for
each muscle at each site and used in further analysis. Test-retest
reliabilities (ICC and CV%) were 0.94 and 4.2% for VL CSA at
50% femur length, 0.93 and 5.1% for VL + VI CSA at 67% femur
length, and 0.77 and 10.2% for VM at 33% femur length.
Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)
Body Composition Measurements
Whole-body and lower limb composition of the intervention
groups were assessed using DXA (Hologic Discovery A,
Waltham, WA) using previously established, standardized and
reliable body positioning procedures (Peiffer et al., 2010). The
subjects were positioned supine and the DXA operator manually
assisted subjects to straighten their head, torso and pelvis,
internally rotate and fixate their legs and feet at 45◦. This has
been shown to produce a scan/re-scan coefficient of variation
below 1% in our laboratory (Peiffer et al., 2010). Inbuilt analysis
software (Version 12.4; QDR for Windows, Hologic, Waltham,
WA) was used to separate the body into axial and appendicular
sections to determine whole body composition and segmental
composition of the legs.
Statistical Analyses
Traditional methods were used to calculate means, standard
deviations and standard error estimations (IBM SPSS version 20).
After tests of normality, significant main effects were assessed
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (3
group × 2 times) with Bonferroni adjustments used as post-
hoc tests. The exception being EMG data where the gross
amplitude cannot be compared between individuals/groups- for
this variable, paired T-tests determined changes over time. One-
way ANOVA was used to determine between-group differences
for relative changes over the study period. The alpha level was set
at 0.05 and effect sizes (g) were calculated according to Hedges’
methods (Hedges, 1982), where small (<0.3), medium (0.3–0.8),
and large (>0.8) effect sizes are identified.
RESULTS
Maximum Concentric and Eccentric Torque
There was a significant main effect for time (F = 13.4, p = 0.001,
g = 1.64) and a trend toward a group × time interaction (F = 2.5,
p = 0.099, g = 0.18) in peak unilateral concentric torque. Post-
hoc analyses revealed that peak concentric torque significantly
increased in both TRAD (PRE: 274 ± 57 Nm, POST: 296 ± 58
Nm, +9 ± 6%, p < 0.001, g = 0.37) and AEL (PRE: 286 ± 41
Nm, POST: 313 ± 46 Nm, +10 ± 9%, p = 0.006, g = 0.61) after 10
weeks of training, with no changes in CON (PRE: 251 ± 35 Nm,
POST: 252 ± 39 Nm, +1 ± 7%, p = 0.81). The relative changes
over the study were significantly greater in AEL (p = 0.038, 95%
confidence interval = 0.4–18.3%) and close to significance in
TRAD (p = 0.082, 95% confidence interval = −0.8–16.7%) than
CON (Figure 3A).
A significant main effect for time (F = 7.9, p = 0.01, g =
1.41), but not group × time interaction (F = 1.6, p = 0.22, g =
0.11), was observed for peak unilateral eccentric torque. Only
AEL significantly increased peak eccentric torque after training
(PRE: 331 ± 50 Nm, POST: 361 ± 49Nm, +10 ± 9%, p = 0.016,
g = 0.62). However, the relative increase over the study period
was not significantly different greater than CON (+1 ± 8%, p =
0.17, 95% confidence interval = −2.5–19.7, Figure 3B).
Maximum Isometric Torque

improvements from week 5 to week 10 (MID: 308 ± 51 Nm,
POST: 326 ± 56 Nm, +7 ± 7%, p = 0.03, g = 0.33), while TRAD
did not (MID: 294 ± 54 Nm, POST: 291 ± 53 Nm, –0.8 ± 8%,

repetition-to-failure test, there was a significant main effect for
time (F = 11.8, p = 0.003, g = 0.86) but not group × time

Improvements during Accentuated Eccentric Load Training
Isokinetic and Isometric Muscle Activation
Paired T-tests revealed that absolute eccentric EMGRMS was
significantly increased in AEL over 10 weeks of training for VL
and VM (+30 ± 34%, p = 0.017, g = 0.83) and the superficial
quadriceps (+24 ± 34%, p = 0.02, g = 0.66, Table 1). Similarly,
only AEL demonstrated increased absolute EMGRMS after 10
weeks of training for the VL and VM muscles (+49 ± 37%, p =
0.007, g = 0.99) and the superficial quadriceps (+25 ± 24%,
p = 0.041, g = 0.64, Table 1) during maximum isometric knee
extension. Maximum M-wave peak-to-peak amplitude increased
significantly in the VL (week 0: 3.1 ± 1.5 mV; week 10: 4.8 ± 1.7
mV, p = 0.006) and VM (week 0: 5.0 ± 1.5 mV; week 10: 6.3 ±
0.4 mV, p = 0.038) in AEL only. Consequently, once the EMGRMS
data was normalized to maximum M-wave, no significant main
effects or changes were observed in AEL (Table 1).
A significant main effect for time (F = 23.7, p < 0.001, g =
0.5), but not group × time interaction (F = 0.8, p = 0.48, g =
0.01), was observed in voluntary activation level measured during
isometric action. Increases occurred over 10 weeks of training in
AEL only, which was largely observed from week 5 to week 10
(PRE: 91.7 ± 6%, MID: 92.1 ± 8%, POST: 95.2 ± 4%, +3.5 ± 5%,
p = 0.039, g = 0.67). However, between-group differences were
not statistically significant (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
accentuated eccentric load resistance training on lower-limb
maximum and repeated force production, muscle activation, and
muscle hypertrophy in already strength-trained men. Systematic
heavy resistance training led to distinct improvements in
neuromuscular performance and knee extensor muscle mass in
both TRAD and AEL intervention groups when compared to a
continuing, unsupervised (training) control group (CON) within
the first 5-week mesocycle. Subsequently, however, accentuated
eccentric loading tended to provide a greater training stimulus
for strength (isokinetic and isometric), fatigue resistance
(repetition-to-failure test) and muscle activation particularly in
the second 5-week mesocycle when TRAD elicited no further
improvements. These changes resulted in more notable strength
and neuromuscular adaptations in AEL compared to CON over
the 10-week program.
Maximum force production increased significantly in both
AEL and TRAD, with increases of ∼30% in 1-RM and ∼10%
in concentric and ∼8% in eccentric strength, as well as ∼11%
(TRAD) and ∼18% (AEL) in isometric torque. These increases
in force production are slightly less than those observed in
previously untrained individuals (Narici et al., 1989; Häkkinen
et al., 1998) but they are larger than improvements reported in
other studies in long-term strength athletes (e.g., Ahtiainen et al.,
2003). Strength and muscle mass gains are difficult to achieve in
experienced strength trainers, even when programming strategies
are changed frequently (Häkkinen et al., 1987). The successful
effect of training in the present subjects might have been elicited
by factors such as the; (1) high intensity loading used (e.g., 6-RM),
(2) in-session supervision (including spotting of lifts, encouraged
increments in load and assistance provided at concentric failure)

Improvements during Accentuated Eccentric Load Training
and motivation (Mazzetti et al., 2000), and (3) immediate post-
training protein consumption, all of which were not provided to
the control group. Through the inclusion of CON we were able to
establish between-day test reliability and assess potential changes
in a representative cohort with continued (i.e., unchanged)
training, while the inclusion of traditional isoinertial loading
allowed quantification of changes related to training supervision
(i.e., the Hawthorne effect), modification of the subjects’ current
training intensities and volumes, and post-exercise nutrition.
Subsequently, we were able to identify the specific, small-to-
moderate improvements relating specifically to the use of the
accentuated eccentric loading used by AEL.
Accentuated eccentric loading was advantageous compared
to traditional isoinertial loading for improving maximum
isometric and eccentric force production. Greater increases in
isometric force production were evidenced by the statistically
greater improvements in isometric knee extension torque
compared to CON and greater effect size (g = 0.95 vs. 0.49)
compared to TRAD over 10 weeks (Figure 3), as well as the
improvements in force production specifically during the last
5 weeks of training (AEL = ∼7%, p = 0.03, g = 0.33;
TRAD = ∼−1%, p = 0.58, g = −0.06). In this regard,
the first 5 weeks of training likely provided a more optimal
training environment for both TRAD and AEL subjects to
improve their performance level, whilst the additional benefit
for AEL was visible in the second 5-week mesocycle. These
data indicate that benefits of accentuated eccentric loading in
already-trained individuals may take some time to manifest
and, therefore, that short periods of training (e.g., several
sessions) may be insufficient to elicit meaningful improvements.
It would be of interest to examine adaptations to even longer
training periods in future to determine whether continued
improvements can be elicited by accentuated eccentric loading
or whether the continuous high intensity may lead to over-
reaching.
Importantly,
a
significantly
greater
improvement
in
maximum isokinetic concentric torque was observed in AEL
than CON (Figure 3A), which is consistent with the findings
of Hortobágyi and DeVita (2000) and Hortobágyi et al. (2001).
While some studies have shown improvements in concentric
performance following eccentric-only training (Paddon-Jones
et al., 2001; Seger and Thorstensson, 2005; Franchi et al., 2015),
some previous studies have shown little adaptation of concentric
force production (e.g., Komi and Buskirk, 1972; Hortobágyi
et al., 1996; Higbie et al., 1996), which may not be an ideal
outcome for certain populations where (functionally important)
concentric force production is imperative. Consequently, it may
be considered that training with accentuated eccentric loads
is efficacious for the improvement of all contraction modes in
previously strength-trained men.
Also, it is important to note that accentuated eccentric load
training elicited an improvement in the ability to perform
consecutive muscular contractions against a load of 75% 1-RM
(i.e., fatigue resistance). This was evidenced by the statistically
significant improvement in the unilateral knee extension
repetition-to-failure test (∼28%, p = 0.022, g = 0.73), whereas
the change was at the level of a trend in TRAD (∼24%, p = 0.076,
g = 0.71). These data suggest that accentuated eccentric load
training led to more systematic improvements in repeated force
production whereas there was likely greater variability in TRAD,
which resulted in a lack of statistical significance. As the present
study did not aim to match workload in the training sessions,
in contrast to other studies where no difference in performance
improvement was observed (e.g., Brandenburg and Docherty,
2002), this finding could reflect the greater overall work required
when using accentuated eccentric loading protocols. Increased
repetition-to-failure performance was also observed in a group
performing greater workload due to the use of variable external
resistance vs. constant external resistance in a recent study
(Walker et al., 2013). An increase in the ability to complete
a high volume of work prior to failure might be important
in that a greater workload can be completed in each training
session, which may provide a greater ongoing stimulus for
increasing strength and muscle mass. It may also indicate that
the training offers a method to improve fatigue resistance that
may benefit performance in activities of daily living or sporting
activities.
It should be noted that the final sample size in the present
study (n = 10+10+8) was likely statistically underpowered to
detect differences, particularly between the intervention groups.
Results of our priori suggested that sample sizes of 11–12 per
group would be sufficient for a power of 0.8. Consequently, due to
difficulties in recruiting trained subjects to perform the study in
addition to the number of drop-outs and magnitude of strength
improvements during the intervention (+10–30% rather than
our expected +5–15%) probably increased the likelihood of type
II errors. Nevertheless, the observed differences between AEL
and CON, as well as the greater effect sizes in AEL compared
to ISO give confidence in our interpretation that training with
accentuated eccentric loads induced greater strength gains in
trained individuals despite the potential under powering of
the present study. Furthermore, the small differences between
training with traditional isoinertial and accentuated eccentric
loads combined with limited sample sizes may have led to other
studies being unable to determine differences between groups
(Nichols et al., 1995; Norrbrand et al., 2008; Raj et al., 2012; Dias
et al., 2015).
There are several potential mechanisms that may have
contributed to the observed improvements in maximum force
production in AEL in the present study. VL and VM CSA
was significantly increased in both AEL and TRAD (∼11–
16%) over the 10-week training period, and these increases
were statistically greater than CON (in which no change was
observed). The increases observed in AEL and TRAD were
within the typical range reported previously (Wernbom et al.,
2007). These increases are notable given that the subjects were
accustomed to resistance training and the exact values may
have been influenced to some extent by variance inherent in
the measurements (CV%; 4–10%). Nevertheless, at least in
the short-term, accentuated eccentric load training does not
provide a greater benefit than that provided by the imposition
of a supervised, high intensity training program with post-
exercise protein ingestion. Furthermore, the increases in lean
leg mass (assessed by DXA) strengthen the interpretation that

Improvements during Accentuated Eccentric Load Training
both training protocols were equally effective in eliciting muscle
hypertrophy in the intervention groups. These findings are
consistent with those of Friedmann-Bette et al. (2010) who
observed similar increases in quadriceps CSA after 6 weeks of
traditional isoinertial loading (∼8%, according to their Figure 3)
and accentuated eccentric loading (∼6%) in power athletes under
supervision. This is also consistent with the proposal that, as long
as sets are performed to concentric failure, small differences in
loading intensity of the two intervention groups in the present
study may not impact protein synthesis (Burd et al., 2012).
Previous data that did show a slight advantage from training with
accentuated eccentric loads over traditional isoinertial training
for muscle hypertrophy (Friedmann et al., 2004; Norrbrand et al.,
2008) were conducted in previously untrained individuals. It
may be that training status is the cause of this disparity between
studies, rather than training intensity, as Friedmann et al. (2004)
used low loads (∼30% 1-RM) while Norrbrand et al. (2008) used
7-RM loads. Collectively, such results indicate that additional
hypertrophy may not be elicited by accentuated eccentric loading
in well-trained individuals over a 10-week training period (at
least using training volumes of ≤60 repetitions per session per
muscle group) and highlights the importance of studying the
effect of resistance training protocols in well-trained subjects.
Another potential adaptation that may have underpinned
the increase in strength elicited by training with accentuated
eccentric loads is an improvement in muscle activation. Related
to this, absolute surface EMGRMS measured during maximum
eccentric (isokinetic) and isometric knee extension increased
significantly in the AEL group only. Interestingly, previous
studies (Komi and Buskirk, 1972; Hortobágyi et al., 1996)
have observed greater increases in EMG amplitude following
eccentric-only vs. concentric-only resistance training. It has been
suggested that, due to the muscle damaging nature of eccentric
actions, motor unit recruitment and synchronization are altered
during recovery from high intensity eccentric exercise (Dartnall
et al., 2011) and this may affect EMG amplitude. We have
examined this possibility post-hoc with quantification of mean
and median spectral frequencies but observed no changes (e.g.,
AEL median power frequency = 85.3 ± 7.7 to 88.8 ± 9.4, p =
0.15), indicating that any residual effects of the final training bout
had subsided prior to testing.
It is well accepted that there are several factors that affect
surface EMG signals (i.e., affecting both maximum peak-to-peak
M-wave and voluntary EMG amplitude) that are independent
of motor unit activity (Farina et al., 2004). In the present study,
significant increases were observed in both voluntary EMG and
M-wave amplitudes in AEL (consequently no changes occurred
in EMG:M-wave ratio). Therefore, one explanation for the
increased EMG activity in AEL is that peripheral (i.e., muscular)
factors had a greater effect on the EMG signal than neural (i.e.,
central) factors (Arabadziev et al., 2014), and that these affected
both M-wave and voluntary EMG amplitudes. As there were no
changes in spectral frequencies it would appear that there were
no systematic changes in the EMG electrode placement relative to
the innervation zone or tendon but, for example, lesser amplitude
cancelation of the EMG signal and/or changes in the propagation
of action potentials may have led to an increased EMGRMS of
similar magnitude to the increase in the maximum M-wave
amplitude. There is some experimental evidence to suggest that
this can occur during relatively slow, submaximal-load training
(Maffiuletti and Martin, 2001). Another possibility is there were
changes in alignment between muscle fascicles or subcutaneous
fat and the EMG electrodes. We assessed these possibilities post-
hoc through the acquired ultrasound images and observed some
indication that changes in fascicle angle relative to the electrode
could have partly influenced EMG signals in AEL (change in
VL fascicle-to-electrode angle to M-wave; r = 0.33, p = 0.39,
n = 9 and change in VL fascicle-to-electrode angle to VL EMG
amplitude; r = 0.72, p = 0.043, n = 8). Nevertheless, a more
detailed assessment of motor unit discharges and conduction
velocities, as well as potential peripheral causes of altered EMG
signals could be considered in future studies.
Despite the difficulty in interpreting the changes in surface
EMG signals, a significant increase in quadriceps’ voluntary
activation level (VA%) was observed exclusively in AEL, as
measured by the twitch interpolation technique during maximal
isometric actions. This change was particularly evident in the
second 5-week mesocycle and is considered to indicate an
improved volitional drive to the muscle (Knight and Kamen,
2001), which may be due to increased firing frequency. This
method may have allowed more specific assessment of muscle
activation than that provided by surface EMG, and the findings
are in-line with the greater improvements in force production
during this period in AEL. While there were no between-group
differences, the twitch interpolation technique has been reported
to be insensitive to detect changes and a mean increase of
3.5% could be considered meaningful (Herbert and Gandevia,
1999). Unfortunately, measurements were not made during
concentric and eccentric actions in the present study because
of the likelihood of fatigue associated with numerous maximal
contractions; it could, therefore, be considered in future studies.
One hypothesis explaining the increase in neural drive after
accentuated eccentric loading is that neural inhibition may have
been reduced during maximum eccentric (Aagaard et al., 2000)
and isometric actions. However, it cannot be fully discounted
that peripheral factors (e.g., altered calcium concentrations),
which have not currently been determined in the literature, may
have also influenced the increase in VA% (Gandevia, 2009).
Nevertheless, the increased EMGRMS and VA% was uniform in
those muscle actions where AEL demonstrated greater strength
gains than TRAD (i.e., eccentric and isometric) and in which
there were no changes in TRAD for EMGRMS and VA%. Hence,
it remains possible that the mechanism(s) responsible for these
neurophysiological findings may also have contributed to the
larger strength improvements in AEL.
In conclusion, accentuated eccentric loading seems to
provide an additional training stimulus to increase maximum
force production, as well as increasing work capacity/reducing
fatigue during lifting in previously trained subjects. That the
improvements in AEL were greater than TRAD in the second
5-week mesocycle indicates that these changes may take several
weeks to manifest in subjects accustomed to resistance training
when the addition of supervision/motivation, greater loading
intensities, and assistance at concentric failure are made.

Improvements during Accentuated Eccentric Load Training
Nevertheless, both the traditional isoinertial and accentuated
eccentric loading training programs were equally effective in
eliciting increases in muscle CSA in subjects accustomed to
resistance training. Therefore, mechanisms other than muscular
hypertrophy, including increases in muscle activation, appear
to underpin the greater improvements following training with
accentuated eccentric loads.
