SUMMARY
The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine seeks
methods for deciphering and modulating electro-
physiological activity in the body to attain therapeu-
tic effects at target organs. Current approaches to
interfacing with peripheral nerves and muscles rely
heavily on wires, creating problems for chronic use,
while emerging wireless approaches lack the size
scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter
nerves. Furthermore, conventional electrode-based
technologies lack the capability to record from
nerves with high spatial resolution or to record inde-
pendently from many discrete sites within a nerve
bundle. Here, we demonstrate neural dust, a wire-
less and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system
for powering and communicating with implanted
bioelectronics. We show that ultrasound is effec-
tive at delivering power to mm-scale devices in tis-
sue; likewise, passive, battery-less communication
using backscatter enables high-fidelity transmission
of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram
(ENG) signals from anesthetized rats. These results
highlight the potential for an ultrasound-based neural
interface system for advancing future bioelectronics-
based therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Recent technological advances (Boretius et al., 2010; Delivo-
poulos et al., 2012) and fundamental discoveries (Bhadra and
Kilgore, 2005; Pavlov and Tracey, 2012; Rosas-Ballina et al.,
2011) have renewed interest in implantable systems for inter-
facing with the peripheral nervous system. Early clinical suc-
cesses with peripheral neurostimulation devices, such as those
used to treat sleep apnea (Strollo et al., 2014) or control bladder
function in paraplegics (Creasey et al., 2001) have led clinicians
and researchers to propose new disease targets ranging from
diabetes to rheumatoid arthritis (Famm et al., 2013). A recently
proposed roadmap for the field of bioelectronic medicines high-
lights the need for new electrode-based recording technologies
that can detect abnormalities in physiological signals and be
used to update stimulation parameters in real time. Key features
of such technologies include high-density, stable recordings of
up to 100 channels in single nerves, wireless and implantable
modules to enable characterization of functionally specific neu-
ral and electromyographic signals, and scalable device plat-
forms that can interface with small nerves of 100 mm diameter
or less (Birmingham et al., 2014) as well as specific muscle fibers.
Current approaches to recording peripheral nerve activity fall
short of this goal; for example, cuff electrodes provide stable
chronic performance but are limited to recording compound ac-
tivity from the entire nerve. Single-lead intrafascicular electrodes
can record from multiple sites within a single fascicle but do not
enable high-density recording from discrete sites in multiple fas-
cicles (Lefurge et al., 1991). Similarly, surface EMG arrays allow
for very-high-density recording (Lapatki et al., 2004; Martinez-
Valdes et al., 2016) but do not capture fine details of deep or
small muscles. Recently, wireless devices to enable untethered
recording in rodents (Lee et al., 2013; Szuts et al., 2011) and
nonhuman primates (Foster et al., 2014; Schwarz et al., 2014;
Yin et al., 2014), as well as mm-scale integrated circuits for neu-
rosensing applications have been developed (Biederman et al.,
2015; Denison et al., 2007; Muller et al., 2015). However, most
wireless systems use electromagnetic (EM) energy coupling
and communication, which becomes extremely inefficient in sys-
tems smaller than �5 mm due to the inefficiency of coupling ra-
dio waves at these scales within tissue (Rabaey et al., 2011; Seo
et al., 2013; see also Size Scaling and Electromagnetics in the
Supplemental Information). Further miniaturization of wireless
electronics platforms that can effectively interface with small-
diameter nerves will require new approaches.
In contrast to EM, ultrasound offers an attractive alternative for
wirelessly powering and communicating with sub-mm implant-
able devices (Charthad et al., 2015; Larson and Towe, 2011;
Meng and Sahin 2013; Ozeri and Shmilovitz, 2010; Seo et al.,
2014). Ultrasound has two advantages. First, the speed of sound
is 105 3 lower than the speed of light in water, leading to much
smaller wavelengths at similar frequencies; this yields excellent

529
 spatial resolution at these lower frequencies as compared to
radio waves. Second, ultrasonic energy attenuates far less in
tissue than EM radiation; this not only results in much higher
penetration depths for a given power, but also significantly de-
creases the amount of unwanted power introduced into tissue
due to scattering or absorption. In fact, for most frequencies
and power levels, ultrasound is safe in the human body. These
limits are well defined, and ultrasound technologies have
long been used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. As a
rough guide, about 723 more power is allowable into the human
body when using ultrasound as compared to radio waves (Food
and Drug Administration, 2008; International Committee on Elec-
tromagnetic Safety, 2006).
We previously introduced the neural dust ultrasonic backscat-
tering concept to harness the potential advantages of ultrasound
and showed that, theoretically, such a system could be scaled
well below the mm-scale when used for wireless electrophysio-
logical neural recording (Seo et al., 2013, 2014). Here, we present
the first experimental validation of a neural dust system in vivo
in the rat peripheral nervous system (PNS) and skeletal muscle,
reporting both electroneurogram (ENG) recordings from the
sciatic nerve and electromyographic (EMG) recordings from
the gastrocnemius muscle. The neural dust system consists of
an external ultrasonic transceiver board which powers and com-

Figure 1. Neural Dust System Overview
(A) An external transducer powers and communi-
cates with a neural dust mote placed remotely in
the body. Driven by a custom transceiver board,
the transducer alternates between transmitting a
series of pulses that power the device and listening
for reflected pulses that are modulated by elec-
trophysiological signals.
(B) A neural dust mote anchored to the sciatic
nerve in an anesthetized rat. Inset shows neural
dust mote with optional testing leads.
(C) Components of a neural dust mote. The devices
were assembled on a flexible PCB and consist of a
piezoelectric crystal, a single custom transistor,
and a pair of recording electrodes.

cuit (ASIC) board (Seo et al., 2015; Tang et al.,

municates with a millimeter-scale sensor
implanted into either a nerve or muscle
(Figure 1A). The implanted mote consists
of a piezoelectric crystal, a single custom
transistor, and a pair of recording elec-
trodes (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1).
During operation, the external trans-
ducer alternates between (1) emitting a
series of six 540-ns pulses every 100 ms
and (2) listening for any reflected pulses.
The entire sequence of transmit, receive,
and reconstruction events are detailed
in Figure 2; this sequence (steps A–H)
is repeated every 100 ms during opera-
tion. Briefly, pulses of ultrasonic energy
emitted by the external transducer impinge on the piezocrystal
and are, in part, reflected back toward the external transducer.
In addition, some of the ultrasonic energy causes the piezocrys-
tal to vibrate; as this occurs, the piezocrystal converts the me-
chanical power of the ultrasound wave into electrical power,
which is supplied to the transistor. Any extracellular voltage
change across the two recording electrodes modulates the tran-
sistor’s gate, changing the amount of current flowing between
the terminals of the crystal. These changes in current, in turn,
alter the vibration of the crystal and the intensity of the reflected
ultrasonic energy. Thus, the shape of the reflected ultrasonic
pulses encodes the electrophysiological voltage signal seen by
the implanted electrodes and this electrophysiological signal
can be reconstructed externally. The performance specifications
of neural dust in comparison to other state-of-the-art systems
are summarized in Table 1.
RESULTS
Commercially Available Components Can Be Assembled
into mm-Scale Recording Implants
The assembly process (Figure S1A) shows a neural dust implant
mote integrated on a 50-mm-thick polyimide flexible printed cir-
cuit board (PCB) where both the piezocrystal (0.75 3 0.75 3
530
Neuron 91, 529–539, August 3, 2016
 0.75 mm) and the custom transistor (0.5 3 0.45 mm) are attached
to the topside of the board with a conductive silver paste.
Electrical connections between the components are made using
aluminum wirebonds and conductive gold traces. Exposed gold
recording pads on the bottom of the board (0.2 3 0.2 mm) are
separated by 1.8 mm and make contact on the nerve or muscle
to record electrophysiological signals (Figure 1C). Recorded
signals are sent to the transistor’s input through micro-vias.
Additionally, some implants were equipped with 0.35-mm-
wide, 25-mm-long, flexible, compliant leads (Figure S1B) with
test points for simultaneous measurement of both the voltage
across the piezocrystal and direct wired measurement of the
extracellular potential across the electrode pair used by the
mote (we refer to this direct, wired recording of extracellular po-
tential as the ground truth measurement below, which is used as
a control for the ultrasonically reconstructed data). The entire
implant is encapsulated in a medical grade UV-curable epoxy
to protect wirebonds and provide insulation. A single neural
dust mote implant measures roughly 0.8 3 3 3 1 mm (Figures

1C and S1). The size of the implants pre-
sented here is limited only by our use of
commercial polyimide backplane tech-
nology, which is commercially accessible
to anyone; relying on more aggressive
assembly techniques with in-house polymer patterning would
produce implants not much larger than the piezocrystal dimen-
sions (yielding an �1-mm3 implant).
A Custom Integrated Circuit Operates the External
Transceiver Board and Enables Low-Noise Interrogation
An external, ultrasonic transceiver board (Figure 1D) interfaces
with neural dust motes by both supplying power (transmit [TX]
mode) and receiving reflected signals (receive [RX] mode). This
system is a low-power, programmable, and portable transceiver
board that drives a commercially available external ultrasonic
transducer (V323-SU, Olympus). Details of the custom inte-
grated circuit (IC) that drove the external ultrasonic transducer
with high-energy efficiency were presented elsewhere (Seo
et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015). The transceiver board exhibited
a de-rated focus at �8.9 mm (Figure 3A). The XY cross-sectional
beam pattern clearly demonstrated the transition from the near-
field to far-field propagation of the beam, with the narrowest
beam at the Rayleigh distance (Figure 3B). The transducer was
Neuron 91, 529–539, August 3, 2016

 driven with a 5-V peak-to-peak voltage signal at 1.85 MHz. The
measured de-rated peak rarefaction pressure was 14 kPa,
resulting in a mechanical index (MI) of 0.01. De-rated spatial
pulse peak average (ISPPA) and spatial peak time average (ISPTA)
of 6.37 mW/cm2 and 0.21 mW/cm2 at 10-kHz pulse repetition
were 0.0034% and 0.03% of the FDA regulatory limit, respec-
tively (Food and Drug Administration, 2008). The transceiver
board was capable of outputting up to 32 V peak to peak, and
the output pressure increased linearly with the input voltage
(Figure 3C).
Reflections from Non-piezocrystal Interfaces Provide a
Built-in Reference for Movement Artifacts and
Temperature Drift
The entire system was submerged and characterized in a
custom-built water tank with manual 6-degrees of freedom
(DOF) linear translational and rotational stages (Thorlabs).
Distilled water was used as a propagation medium, which ex-
hibits similar acoustic impedance as tissue, at 1.5 MRayls
(Kino, 1987). For initial calibration of the system, a current source
(2400-LV, Keithley) was used to mimic extracellular signals by
forcing electrical current at varying current densities through
0.127-mm-thick
platinum
wires
(773000,

Systems)
immersed in the tank. The neural dust mote was submerged in
the current path between the electrodes. As current was applied
between the wires, a potential difference arose across the
implant electrodes. This potential difference was used to mimic
extracellular electrophysiological signals during tank testing.
To interrogate the neural dust mote, six 540-ns pulses every
100 ms were emitted by the external transducer (Figure 2). These
emitted pulses reflect off the neural dust mote and produce
backscatter pulses back toward the external transducer. Re-
flected backscatter pulses were recorded by the same trans-
ceiver board (Figures 1A and 1D). The received backscatter
waveform exhibits four regions of interest; these are pulses re-
flecting from four distinct interfaces (Figures 3D and 3E): (1) the
water-polymer encapsulation boundary, (2) the top surface of
the piezoelectric crystal, (3) the piezo-PCB boundary, and (4)
the back of the PCB. As expected, the backscatter amplitude
of the signals reflected from the piezoelectric crystal (second
region) changed as a function of changes in potential at the
recording electrodes. Reflected pulses from other interfaces
did not respond to changes in potential at the recording elec-
trodes. Importantly, pulses from the other non-responsive re-
gions were used as a signal level reference, making the system
robust to motion or heat-induced artifacts (snce pulses reflected
from all interfaces change with physical or thermal disturbances
of the neural dust mote but only pulses from the second region
change as a function of electrophysiological signals). In a water
tank, the system showed a linear response to changes in
recording electrode potential and a noise floor of �0.18 mVrms
(Figure 3F). The overall dynamic range of the system is
limited by the input range of the transistor and is greater
than >500 mV (i.e., there is only an incremental change in the cur-
rent once the transistor is fully on [input exceeds its threshold
voltage] or fully off). The noise floor increased with the measured
power drop-off of the beam; 0.7 mm of misalignment degraded it
by a factor of two (n = 5 devices, Figure 3H). This lateral misalign-
ment-induced increase in the noise floor constitutes the most
significant challenge to neural recordings without a beam-steer-
ing system (that is, without the use of an external transducer
array that can keep the ultrasonic beam focused on the im-
planted dust mote and, thus, on axis). On axis, the neural dust
mote converted incident acoustic power to electrical power
across the load resistance of the piezo with �25% efficiency.
Figure 3G plots the off-axis drop-off of voltage and power at
one Rayleigh distance for the transducer used in this manuscript.
Likewise, Figure 3I plots the change in effective noise floor as a
function of angular misalignment.
EMG and ENG Can Be Recorded Tetherlessly In Vivo in
Rodents
We recorded evoked EMG responses from the gastrocnemius
muscle of adult Long-Evans rats under anesthesia using the neu-
ral dust system. The mote was placed on the exposed muscle
surface, the skin and surrounding connective tissue were then

 replaced, and the wound was closed with surgical suture
(Figure 4A). The ultrasonic transducer was positioned 8.9 mm
away from the implant (one Rayleigh distance of the external
transducer) and commercial ultrasound gel (Aquasonic 100,
Parker Labs) was used to enhance coupling. The system was
aligned using a manual manipulator by maximizing the harvested
voltage on the piezocrystal measured from the flexible leads.
Ag/AgCl wire hook electrodes were placed approximately 2 cm
distally on the trunk of the sciatic nerve for the bulk stimulation
of muscle fiber responses. Stimulation pulses of 200 ms duration
were applied every 6 s, and data were recorded for 20 ms around
the stimulation window (Figure 4B). The power spectral density
(PSD) of the reconstructed data with several harmonics due to
edges in the waveform is shown in Figure 4C. This process could
be continued indefinitely, within the limit of the anesthesia pro-
tocol; a comparison of data taken after 30 min of continuous
recording showed no appreciable degradation in recording qual-
ity (Figure 4D).
We obtained EMG recruitment curves with both ground truth
and wireless dust backscatter by varying stimulation amplitude
(Figures 5A and 5B). Reconstruction of the EMG signal from
the wireless backscatter data was sampled at 10 kHz, while

reflections arising from non-responsive regions; these correspond to reflected pulses from other device components shown in (D). The measurement from the
non-responsive regions, which do not encode biological data, can be used as a reference. As a result of taking this differential measurement, any movements of
the entire structure relative to the external transducer during the experiment can be subtracted out.

(H) The effect of noise floor as a function of lateral misalignment followed the beam pattern power fall-off.
(I) Plot of drop in the effective noise floor as a function of angular misalignment. Angular misalignment results in a skewed beam pattern: ellipsoidal as opposed to
circular. This increases the radius of focal spot (spreading energy out over a larger area); the distortion of the focal spot relaxes the constraint on misalignment.

 the wired, ground truth measurement was sampled at 100 kHz
with a noise floor of 0.02 mV. The two signals at response-satu-
rating stimulation amplitude (100%) matched with R = 0.795
(Figure 5C). The difference between the wireless and wired
data was within ± 0.4 mV (Figure 5D). The salient feature of
the neural dust mote EMG response was approximately 1 ms
narrower than the ground truth, which caused the largest error
in the difference plot (Figures 5C and 5D). The responses from
skeletal muscle fibers occurred 5 ms post-stimulation and per-
sisted for 5 ms. The peak-to-peak voltage of the EMG shows a
sigmoidal response as a function of stimulation intensity (Fig-
ure 5E) as expected (Gruner and Mason, 1989). The error bars
indicate the measurement uncertainties from two rats and ten
samples each per stimulation amplitude. The minimum signal
detected by the neural dust mote is approximately 0.25 mV,
which is in good agreement with the noise floor measurement
made in a water tank.
A similar setup was prepared to measure the electroneuro-
gram (ENG) response from the main branch of the sciatic nerve
in anesthetized rats. The sciatic nerve was exposed by sepa-

the recording electrodes making contact
with the epineurium (Figure 1B). We
measured a similar graded response on
both ground truth and wireless dust
backscatter by varying stimulation cur-
rent amplitude delivered to bipolar stain-
less steel electrodes placed in the foot
(Figures 6A and 6B). The two signals
at response-saturating stimulation ampli-
tude (100%) matched with R = 0.886
(Figure

was
within ±0.2 mV (Figure 6D). The peak-to-
peak ENG voltage showed a sigmoidal
response with the error bars indicating
uncertainties from two rats and ten sam-
ples each per stimulation amplitude. The
minimum signal detected by the neural dust mote was again at
0.25 mV (Figure 6E).
DISCUSSION
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of neu-
ral recording technologies to improve neurostimulation-based
treatments as well as to develop new closed-loop neuromodula-
tion therapies for disorders in the central (Krook-Magnuson et al.,
2015) and peripheral (Famm et al., 2013) nervous systems.
Because nerves carry both efferent and afferent signals to a va-
riety of target organs, effective recording technologies will need
high spatiotemporal resolution to record from multiple discrete
sites within a single nerve. In order for these technologies to
become clinically viable they will need to be tether-less to avoid
potential infections and adverse biological responses due to mi-
cro-motion of the implant within the tissue.
To address this looming issue, we designed, built, and im-
planted a wireless, ultrasonic neural sensor and communication
system that enables neural recordings in the peripheral nervous
system. In vivo, acute recordings in a stationary, anesthetized rat

 model were used to collect compound action potentials from the
main branch of the sciatic nerve as well as evoked EMG from the
gastrocnemius muscle. The performance of the neural dust sys-
tem was equivalent to conventional electrophysiological record-
ings employing microelectrodes and cabled electronics.
One of the principal strengths of the demonstrated technology
is that, unlike conventional radio frequency technology, ultra-
sound-based systems appear scalable down to <100 mm sizes
(see Size Scaling and Electromagnetics in the Supplemental
Information), opening the door to a new technological path in
implantable electronics. A complete analysis of this scaling can
be found in (Seo et al., 2013, 2014). In brief, physics limits how
small a good radio frequency receiver can be due to the long
wavelengths of radio frequency energy (millimeters to centime-
ters) and the high degree of absorption of radio frequency energy
into tissue (which heats up the tissue and limits the total power
than can be sent to an implant). Ultrasonic systems fare much
better in both areas, allowing for the design of extremely small
receiver devices. In addition, the extreme miniaturization of
lower power electronics allows for useful recording electronics
to be incorporated into such small packages.
A number of technical challenges remain open. The power
levels used in this study were limited by the specifications of
commercially available transducers; custom transducers will

 reduce the overall external device footprint, lower the noise floor
(by producing higher power densities at the focal spot), and allow
for selection of the focal depth to suit specific applications. For
example, a flat, low-profile piezo transducer with proper imped-
ance matching would enable a wearable neural dust transceiver
board small enough for awake, behaving rodent neurophysi-
ology. Additionally, the development of wearable, battery-pow-
ered multi-element arrays would allow for beam steering of the
ultrasonic beam, with several advantages: (1) motes could be
maintained on axis even in the face of relative motion between
mote and external transducer, which is the most significant chal-
lenge of the present work; (2) multiple motes could potentially be
interrogated by sweeping the focused beam electronically; (3)
post-surgical tuning of mote location would be made easier.
Additional de-noising of the transceiver drive electronics should
also help decrease the noise floor (see Experimental Proce-
dures). The modifications above are all well-within current state
of the art; with others, we have recently shown theoretical and

 experimental advantages to using beam-forming systems (Ber-
trand et al., 2014; Seo et al., 2015).
In addition, the calculated scaling predictions suggest that
<500-mm scale motes are feasible. To do this, a number of
material and microfabrication challenges exist, including the
use of microfabricated backplanes, solder microbumping as-
sembly of components (instead of the conventional wirebonding
approach used here), and the use of thin film encapsulants
(instead of medical grade epoxy) such as parylene. Transitioning
away from PZT piezocrystals to biocompatible BaTiO3 single
crystal transducers is also under way; taken together, these de-
velopments would open the way for chronic studies of neural
dust recording.
Last, as this platform presents a generalized power delivery
system, the design and fabrication of neural stimulation systems
based on charge delivery through electrodes on the dust motes
is also under way.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Neural Dust Mote Assembly
Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sheets (841, APC International) with �12 mm
of fired on silver were diced to desired dimensions using a dicing saw
(DAD3240, Disco) with a ceramic blade (PN CX-010-270-080-H). The diced
PZT coupon, along with the custom transistor, was attached to a 50-mm-thick
polyimide flexible PCB with immersion gold (Altaflex) using a thin layer of
two-part silver epoxy with 1:1 mix ratio (H20E, Epotek). The board was cured
at 150�C, which is far below the melting temperature of polyimide and the
Curie temperature of the PZT, for 10 min. The custom transistor was wire-
bonded using an aluminum ultrasonic wirebonder (7400B, West Bond) to
pre-patterned targets. In order to prevent charge build-up on the PZT from
the wedge contact, top and bottom contacts of the PZT were discharged to
a thin metal sheet prior to wirebonding the top contact of the PZT to close
the circuits. Medical-grade, UV-curable epoxy (OG116-31, Epotek) was
used to protect the wirebond and provide insulation. The platform was then
cured in UV chamber (Flash, Asiga) with 92 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 3 min.
Electrical and Ultrasonic Characterization of the Assembly in Water
The custom transistor was electrically tested with a precision current meter
(2400-LV, Keithley) and a DC power supply (3631A, Agilent). To characterize
the piezocrystal prior to assembly, an impedance plot was obtained with
an impedance analyzer (4285A, Agilent) using two-terminal measurements
with open/short/load calibration scheme. The impedance of exposed gold
recording pads (0.2 3 0.2 mm), separated by 1.8 mm on the bottom of the
PCB, was measured in Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS 13) with an electro-
chemical impedance spectroscope (nanoZ, White Matter). The device formed
the active electrode and a silver wire formed the reference electrode.
Ultrasonic characterization of the transducer was performed in a custom-
built water tank. A capsule hydrophone (HGL-0400, Onda) with 20 dB pre-
amplification (AH-2020, Onda) was mounted on a computer-controlled 2D
translating stage (XSlide, VelMex) and was used to calibrate the output pres-
sure and characterize beam patterns of a 2.25 MHz single-element transducer
(V323-SU, Olympus). Verification of ultrasonic power transfer and communica-
tion sensitivity was performed in a smaller water tank with the transducer
mounted on manual translational and rotational stages (Thorlabs). The outline
of the neural dust mote was patterned on an extruded acrylic piece with UV
laser, and the mote was clamped to the acrylic stage with nylon screws. The
position and angle of the transducer with relative to the mote were manually
adjusted until the maximum voltage was measured across the piezocrystal.
Cable capacitances and parasitics were carefully calibrated by adjusting the
series capacitance in the high-impedance probes (N2863B, Agilent). An elec-
tric field in the water tank was generated with a current source (2400-LV,
Keithley) forcing electrical current at varying current densities through two
0.127-mm-thick platinum wires (773000, A-M systems) immersed in the tank.
The transceiver board consisted of a custom integrated circuit (IC) in a QFN-
64 package that achieved an on-chip 1.8- to 32-V charge pump efficiency of
33% and system latency of 20 ns and consumed 16.5 mJ per each transmit cycle
(Tangetal.,2015). Duringthereceivemode, thehigh-voltageswitch wasclosed,
and the signal was amplified by 28 dB; both operations were performed on chip.
The output signal from the chip was digitized by an off-chip 10-bit, 100 MHz
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (LTC2261-12, Linear Technology). The out-
puts of the ADC were fed back into the field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
and USB 3.0 integration module (XEM6310-LX45, Opal Kelly) and transferred
to the laptop. The FPGA-USB module was also used to serially program the IC.
Experiment Setup and Surgical Procedures
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with University of
California Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee regulations. Adult male
Long-Evans rats were used for all experiments. Prior to the start of surgery, an-
imals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine
(5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.). The fur surrounding the surgical site was
shaved and cleaned. For EMG recordings, a patch of gastrocnemius muscle
roughly 10 3 5 mm in size was exposed by removing the overlying skin and
fascia. The neural dust mote was then placed on the exposed muscle, the
skin and fascia were replaced, and the wound was closed with 5/0 surgical su-
ture. For ENG recordings, the sciatic nerve was exposed by making an incision
from the sciatic notch to the knee, and separating the hamstring muscles. The
mote was then placed in contact with the epineurium of the main branch of the
sciatic nerve bundle and sutured to the nerve using 10/0 microsurgical suture.
Animals were euthanized at the conclusion of the experiments.
Constant-current stimulation was delivered using an isolated pulse stimu-
lator (2100, A-M Systems). Single biphasic pulses with a 2-ms pulse width
were used to deliver stimulation at various current amplitudes. For each exper-
iment, electrophysiological responses from ten stimulations (i.e., samples)
were recorded. The FPGA-USB module generated a trigger for the stimulator
every 6 s. For EMG experiments, bipolar Ag-AgCl hook electrodes placed
around the trunk of the sciatic nerve were used for stimulation. To evoke
ENG activity, 28G stainless steel needle electrodes were placed in the foot
with an inter-electrode distance of approximately 5 mm.
The wired signals were amplified (1003) by a battery-powered differential
amplifier with a built-in band-pass filter (DAM50, WPI) set at 10 Hz to 1 kHz.
The ground reference for the amplifier was a 28G stainless steel needle
electrode placed in the contralateral foot relative to the recording setup. The
output of the amplifier was connected to a multi-channel digitizer, sampled
at 100 kHz, and recorded on computer.
Transmit Pulse Waveforms and Data Acquisition
The neural dust mote was placed one Rayleigh distance from the transducer
(8.9 mm), which corresponded to 5.9 ms transit time, assuming an acoustic ve-
locity of �1,500 m/s in water. Six cycles of square waves at 1.85 MHz with
peak voltage of 5 V were launched every 100 ms (pulse repetition frequency
[PRF] of 10 kHz). The total transmit pulse width was approximately, 3.3 ms,
which was sufficiently small to prevent any overlaps with the first harvested
voltage measurement at 5.9 ms. Given that the first reflection back to the trans-
ducer (e.g., backscatter) occurred at approximately 11.8 ms (twice the transit
time) and persisted until for 3.3 ms, the maximum PRF (e.g., in this context,
the sampling rate) was �66 kHz. Given that the bulk peripheral nerve re-
sponses occurred below 1 kHz (Mezzarane et al., 2013), a PRF of 10 kHz
was chosen to sufficiently capture the dynamics.
In order to sample the backscatter waveform at 1.85 MHz without losing
signal fidelity, the off-chip ADC on the transceiver board was heavily over-
sampled at 50 MHz. This resulted in �8 Mbits of data in a 10-ms neural
recording, which was stored in a 128 MByte, 16-bit wide, synchronous
DDR2 DRAM (MT47H64M16HR-3, Micron Technology). The raw waveforms
were transferred to the laptop via the USB interface post-recording. The raw
waveforms were simultaneously recorded using an 8-bit digitizer (USB-5133,
National Instruments) for comparison.
Backscatter Data Processing
Raw backscatter waveforms, sampled at 50 MHz, from each experiment were
sliced and time aligned to be averaged over eight samples. The averaged
Neuron 91, 529–539, August 3, 2016
537
 signals were band-pass filtered with a symmetric fourth order Butterworth filter
from 10 Hz to 1 kHz. The distinct characteristics of the backscatter waveform
(Figure 3E) were used as a template to locate the region of interest. The signals
were then rectified, and the integral of the region was computed to estimate
the input voltage signal, which exhibited a linear response (Figure 3F). Multipli-
cation factor for the signal was extracted from the ground truth measurement.
