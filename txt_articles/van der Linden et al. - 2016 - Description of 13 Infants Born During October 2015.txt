On November 22, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
Congenital Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly and 
severe brain abnormalities (1). Congenital Zika syndrome 
comprises a spectrum of clinical features (2); however, as is the 
case with most newly recognized teratogens, the earliest docu-
mented clinical presentation is expected to be the most severe. 
Initial descriptions of the effects of in utero Zika virus infection 
centered prominently on the finding of congenital microcephaly 
(3). To assess the possibility of clinical presentations that do not 
include congenital microcephaly, a retrospective assessment of 
13 infants from the Brazilian states of Pernambuco and Ceará 
with normal head size at birth and laboratory evidence of con-
genital Zika virus infection was conducted. All infants had brain 
abnormalities on neuroimaging consistent with congenital Zika 
syndrome, including decreased brain volume, ventriculomegaly, 
subcortical calcifications, and cortical malformations. The 
earliest evaluation occurred on the second day of life. Among 
all infants, head growth was documented to have decelerated 
as early as 5 months of age, and 11 infants had microcephaly. 
These findings provide evidence that among infants with prena-
tal exposure to Zika virus, the absence of microcephaly at birth 
does not exclude congenital Zika virus infection or the presence 
of Zika-related brain and other abnormalities. These findings 
support the recommendation for comprehensive medical and 
developmental follow-up of infants exposed to Zika virus pre-
natally. Early neuroimaging might identify brain abnormalities 
related to congenital Zika infection even among infants with a 
normal head circumference (4).
Thirteen infants with laboratory evidence of congenital 
Zika virus infection and normal head size (less than or equal 
to 2 standard deviations [SD] below the mean for sex and 
gestational age) at birth (during October 2015–January 2016) 
are included in this report. The infants were evaluated by 
multidisciplinary teams at two referral centers in Brazil: the 
Rehabilitation Center of Association for Assistance of Disabled 
Children of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco State, and the 
Infantil Albert Sabin Hospital, Fortaleza, Ceará State during 
the months of October 2015–October 2016.
Eleven of the infants came to clinical attention because their 
birth head circumference was below the level established by the 
Brazilian Ministry of Health as requiring further evaluation for 
possible congenital Zika virus infection (http://combateaedes.
saude.gov.br/images/sala-de-situacao/Microcefalia-Protocolo-
de-vigilancia-e-resposta-10mar2016-18h.pdf). This level was 
33 cm before December 2, 2015, and 32 cm for gestational 
age ≥37 weeks after that date; however, all of these infants 
had head circumferences at birth that did not exceed 2 SD 
below the mean for gestational age, and therefore did not meet 
the definition for microcephaly (more than 2 SD below the 
mean). These 11 infants were referred for neurologic evalua-
tion and neuroimaging. The remaining two infants who had 
head circumferences in the normal range at birth were referred 
for neurologic evaluation at ages 5 and 7 months because of 
developmental concerns.
A standard form was used to collect demographic and clinical 
information, including whether the mothers recalled having 
had a rash during pregnancy. All information was obtained as 
part of the clinical protocol or as the result of clinical indica-
tion. Informed consent was obtained for the collection, use, 
and publication of clinical photographs of the infants.
Laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection was 
defined as negative laboratory test results for five infectious 
causes of congenital microcephaly (toxoplasmosis, cytomega-
lovirus, rubella, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus) 
and serologic evidence of Zika virus infection (a positive Zika 
virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme–
linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) result on infant 
cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] or serum). Conventional reverse 
transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was per-
formed for the detection of Zika virus and dengue virus RNA, 
and real-time RT-PCR was performed for chikungunya virus 
in the Recife location. Monoplex real-time RT-PCR for Zika 
virus was performed in the Fortaleza location (5,6). Maternal 
testing for evidence of Zika virus infection was not available 
during the time of the 13 pregnancies.
For this report, microcephaly was defined as head circumfer-
ence (HC) (also known as occipitofrontal circumference) more 
than 2 SD below the mean for gestational age and sex, according 
to the Fetal International and Newborn Growth Consortium

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
for the 21st Century (INTERGROWTH-21st) for fetal and 
newborn growth (https://intergrowth21.tghn.org/) and the 
World Health Organization Child Growth Standards for infants 
(www.who.int/childgrowth/en/). Birth weight was evaluated and 
classified as appropriate, small, or large for gestational age and 
sex, also using INTERGROWTH-21st standards.
All infants had clinical neurologic and orthopedic evalu-
ations, and brain imaging with computerized tomography 
(CT) scan without contrast, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) without contrast, or both, and radiographs of the hips 
to identify congenital dislocation. In addition, all infants had 
clinical noninstrumental evaluation of dysphagia by a speech 
therapist, ophthalmologic examination with ophthalmoscopy 
assessment, and 11 of 13 infants had auditory evaluation by 
screening (auditory short latency brainstem evoked response 
[ABR] to click stimuli) and diagnostic tests (confirmatory 
frequency-specific ABR with tone burst stimuli) using the 
routine recommended by Brazilian Heath Ministry and the 
American Academy of Pediatrics Joint Committee on Infant 
Hearing (7). Infants clinically suspected of having seizure 
activity had an electroencephalogram to confirm.
The case series included nine male infants and four 
female infants (Table 1). Eleven patients were born at term 
(37–41 weeks’ gestation) and two were preterm (35 and 
36 weeks’ gestation). Six of 13 mothers described a cutaneous 
rash between the second and fifth months of pregnancy. All 
infants had birth weights that were appropriate for gestational 
age (i.e., within 2 SD of the mean for sex and gestational age). 
Craniofacial disproportion was noted in six infants; three had 
redundant skin on the scalp at birth. Three infants had hip 
dysplasia, including one infant with arthrogryposis who had 
bilateral dislocated hips.
All infants had positive tests for Zika virus–specific IgM 
in either CSF only (nine infants), serum only (two infants) 
or CSF and serum (two infants). Seven CSF specimens were 
tested for Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR and all were nega-
tive; two of these infants also had negative RT-PCR testing 
in serum collected at the same time as CSF. RT-PCR testing 
results on the two serum-only specimens are pending. No Zika 
virus testing was performed on urine. Most infants (eight of 
13) were tested within the first month of life; however, the 
date of testing of CSF for two infants is not known. Three 
infants were tested for Zika virus outside the neonatal period. 
Although identified at birth because of head size, one infant 
was not tested until age 4 months; two infants were tested at 
ages 5 months and 7 months when they were first evaluated 
because of developmental delay. One infant with both CSF and 
serum IgM testing positive at birth tested negative on serum 
re-testing at 6 months of age; another remained positive on 
re-testing at age 5 months.
HCs at birth ranged from 0.30 to -2.00 SD from the mean for 
gestational age and sex (Table 1). All infants showed a decrease 
in the rate of HC growth between birth and the time of the last 
examination. In 11 of 13 infants, postnatal microcephaly was 
diagnosed because of an HC measurement more than 2 SD 
below the mean for age and sex. Neuroimaging (CT scan in 
13 infants and MRI in 10 infants) showed malformations of 
cortical development, which were most predominant anteriorly, 
and calcifications, predominantly in the subcortical region (espe-
cially in the transition area between the cortex and white matter). 
All neuroimaging showed evidence of decreased brain volume, 
with ventriculomegaly in all infants, and increased extra-axial 
CSF space in two of 13 infants (Table 2) (Figure).
Dysphagia was found on clinical evaluation in 10 of 13 
infants. Seven infants had a diagnosis of epilepsy. Five infants 
had some degree of irritability, which improved by age 4 months. 
Most infants (12 of 13) had good visual interaction; one infant 
exhibited no eye contact. Three of 13 infants had chorioretinal 
abnormalities. All 11 infants tested had normal hearing evalua-
tions. All infants had some degree of hypertonia; 12 of 13 had 
pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs with dystonic movement. 
One infant had spastic hemiparesis and another had bilateral 
hemiparesis, more severe on the left side. One infant with 
arthrogryposis was difficult to assess because of increased tone in 
some muscles and decreased in others. Nine of 13 infants had no 
voluntary movement of the hands and had a grasp reflex. Good 
head control was present in eight of 13 infants (supplemental 
material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42517).
Discussion
Congenital microcephaly has been a hallmark of intrauterine 
infection with Zika virus. However, despite the absence of 
microcephaly at birth, the 13 infants in this report with labora-
tory evidence of Zika virus infection had brain abnormalities 
associated with congenital Zika syndrome, including ventricu-
lomegaly and decreased brain volume, cortical malformations 
and subcortical calcifications, underscoring the importance of 
neuroimaging in evaluating these infants. In addition some 
infants had other structural or functional abnormalities that 
might have brought them to medical attention regardless of 
their head size; however, these findings did not occur more fre-
quently in infants with the smallest HCs. Congenital Zika virus 
infection without microcephaly at birth previously has been 
reported (8), as has postnatal development of microcephaly 
in infants presumed to be infected congenitally (9). However, 
this is the first series of infants with laboratory evidence of 
congenital Zika virus infection documented to have poor head 
growth with microcephaly developing after birth.
Decreases in the rate of head growth postnatally in these 
infants was accompanied by significant neurologic dysfunction,

including hypertonia and hemiparesis, dyskinesia/dystonia, dys-
phagia, epilepsy, and persistence of primitive reflexes. Although 
these neurologic findings are consistent with previous reports of 
infants with congenital microcephaly who had prenatal exposure 
to Zika virus (2), infants who did not have microcephaly at 
birth showed better social interaction (i.e., they made and held 
eye contact and had a social smile). However, more than 60% 
of infants in this series had epilepsy (likely related to the corti-
cal malformations), and all had significant motor disabilities 
consistent with mixed cerebral palsy (10). The infants were too 
young to be adequately assessed for cognitive deficits.
Among the six mothers who reported a rash, four reported rash 
in the first trimester and two in the second trimester. Therefore, 
among these mothers, early occurrence of the presumed infection 
during pregnancy did not result in the most severe congenital 
Zika phenotype (i.e., microcephaly at birth). Only three infants 
were reported to have a history of prenatal ultrasound abnormali-
ties consistent with congenital Zika virus infection.
The pathogenesis of postnatal microcephaly from congenital 
Zika virus infections is not known. The decrease in head growth 
might be the consequence of earlier in utero destruction of 
neuroprogenitor or other neural cells, persistent inflammatory 
response-associated molecules, or continued infection of neural 
cells. The last seems less likely given the negative Zika virus 
RT-PCR results in all seven tested CSF samples.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, birth HC measurements were recorded with a 
resolution of 0.5 cm (in contrast to the customary 0.1 cm), 
which likely resulted in either overestimate or underestimate 
of the measure in some infants. Two infants had a birth HC 
that was at or slightly less than 2 SD below the mean, and 
their HCs could have been misclassified as falling within the 
normal range. In addition, calculations of SD can vary among 
the published growth standards for HC. Second, Zika IgM 
testing was not confirmed by plaque reduction neutraliza-
tion testing; therefore, infants could have been misclassified 
because of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses or nonspe-
cific reactivity within the ELISA. Third, based on this clinical 
series alone, the birth prevalence of congenital Zika syndrome 
without microcephaly in the population cannot be estimated. 
Finally, because serial neuroimaging in an infant is not clini-
cally indicated, progressive changes such as the rate of brain 
volume loss cannot be assessed.
Additional information is needed to fully describe the clini-
cal spectrum of findings associated with congenital Zika virus 
infection. This report documents that microcephaly at birth is 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Congenital Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly and 
severe brain abnormalities. As more information about the 
associated clinical syndrome becomes available, the phenotype 
is expanding to include other, sometimes less severe features, 
such as brain abnormalities without congenital microcephaly.
What is added by this report?
Although infants with congenital Zika virus infection who have 
a normal head size have been described in large series, 
sufficient description of the features of congenital Zika 
syndrome in these infants has not been available. This report of 
a series of 13 infants with laboratory evidence of congenital 
Zika virus infection with normal head size at birth includes the 
findings from extensive imaging, neurologic, ophthalmologic, 
auditory, and orthopedic examinations. Follow-up of these 
infants has shown that for most, head growth deceleration 
occurs to the point of microcephaly after birth and significant 
neurologic sequelae are evident.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Additional information is needed to fully describe the spectrum 
of findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection; 
however, microcephaly might not be evident at birth but can 
develop after birth in infants with underlying brain abnormali-
ties. These findings underscore the importance of early 
neuroimaging for infants exposed to Zika virus prenatally.
