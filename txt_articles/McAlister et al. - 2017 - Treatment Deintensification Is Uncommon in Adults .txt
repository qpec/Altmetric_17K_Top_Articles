he benefits of intensive glucose control beyond slow-
ing of diabetic retinopathy progression are uncertain 
for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and are offset by 
increased risks of hypoglycemic events (and, in at least 1 ran-
domized trial, of mortality), especially in individuals who are 
elderly or have comorbidities.1–3 Recent analyses suggest that 
many individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be poten-
tially overtreated.4–6 A recent study7 from the Veterans Health 
Administration found that less than one quarter of patients 
with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) <6.5% had their gly-
cemic therapy reduced, and a survey8 of primary care provid-
ers found that many were more concerned about medicolegal 
risks from deintensifying therapy than the potential harms of 
tight control.

The purpose of this study is to examine the frequency of 
treatment deintensification in American adults with diabetes 
mellitus outside of the VA system and to explore whether pat-
terns vary by glycemic control and health status.
Methods
As previously described,5 we conducted a population-based retro-
spective cohort study using the deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart 
Database (Optum Insight, Eden Prairie, MN) which includes clinical 
encounter (inpatient and outpatient) data, pharmacy, and laboratory 
results for employed, commercially insured patients, and their depen-
dents from all 50 States.
All data were deidentified and accessed with protocols compli-
ant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The 
study was approved by the ethics review board of the University of 
Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and the New England Ethics 
Institutional Review Board, MA.
Cohort Selection
We identified all patients aged 20 years or older with at least 1 hos-
pitalization or 2 physician claims within 2 years for International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition 250.x (diabetes mellitus), 
or a first claim for an oral glycemic medication or insulin, between 
January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009 without any diabetes mel-
litus visits or glycemic therapy in the preceding 2 years. This case 
definition (using both physician-assigned diagnoses and medication 
data) has a specificity of 92% to 97% for identifying new onset dia-
betes mellitus.9 To be eligible for this study, patients had to have an 
Background—Whether treatment deintensification in Americans with diabetes mellitus varies by glycemic control, health 
status, and calendar year (before/after February 2008 when safety concerns about intensive glucose control were reported 
in the ACCORD trial [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes]) is unclear.
Methods and Results—We defined deintensification as discontinuation or dosage decrease of at least 1 glycemic medication 
without addition of, or uptitration of, another agent in the 120 days after the index glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) 
measurement. Of 99 694 individuals (mean age 54 years) in this retrospective cohort study being actively treated for 
new diabetes mellitus (50% 1 drug, 33% 2 drugs, and 17% ≥3 drugs), 12 921 (13.0%) had HbA1C <6% after 1 year, 
19 670 (19.7%) had HbA1C 6.0% to 6.4%, 35 012 (35.1%) had HbA1C 6.5% to 7.5%, and 32 091 (32.2%) had HbA1C 
>7.5%. Glycemic therapy was deintensified in 18.3% of patients (21.2% of frail patients, 19.4% of those with multiple 
comorbidities, and 17.7% of otherwise healthy patients) with no gradient across glycemia levels (20.6% of those with 
HbA1C<6%, 17.3% of those with HbA1C 6.0%–6.4%, 17.7% of those with HbA1C 6.5%–7.5%, and 18.6% of those 
with HbA1C>7.5%). Similar proportions were seen even after exclusion of 26 985 patients being treated with metformin 
monotherapy: 23.3%, 20.4%, 20.3%, and 20% across the HbA1C strata. Therapy was deintensified in 22.5% of patients 
with index HbA1C <6.0% before February 2008 compared with 19.5% after (P<0.001).
Conclusions—Among frail patients or those with multiple comorbidities, over three quarters with low HbA1C did not have 
their glycemic therapy deintensified, even after safety concerns were raised in the ACCORD trial.  (Circ Cardiovasc

HbA1C measurement after at least 1 year of coverage (to ensure that 
we had sufficient data to accurately classify patients’ health status 
at the time of the HbA1C), to have been taking at least 1 glycemic 
medication in the 120 days before the index HbA1C measurement 
(ie, the last recorded HbA1C for each patient), and to be followed for 
at least 120 days after the index measurement (to ensure detection of 
any therapy changes in response to the HbA1C value). All patients 
were followed prospectively until death, termination of medical in-
surance, or December 31, 2010, providing a maximum follow-up of 
6 years.
Definition of Health Status
Using previously published definitions,5 we classified patients as be-
ing relatively healthy (≤2 chronic conditions), having multiple co-
morbidities (≥3 chronic conditions), or frail (clinical notations of 
malnutrition, abnormal weight loss, difficulty walking, fecal/urinary 
incontinence, morbid obesity, dementia, falls, decubitus ulcer, or 
if they had end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, heart failure 
with a most responsible HF hospitalization in the past year, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease with a most responsible chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease hospitalization in the past year, or meta-
static cancer). We used all visits up to and including the date that 
the index HbA1C was drawn to define each patient’s health and the 
chronic conditions we searched for included arthritis, coronary heart 
disease (previous myocardial infarction or angina), stroke, urinary 
incontinence, depression, or hypertension, and less severe stages 
of 4 conditions included in the frailty definition: heart failure but 
without hospitalization in the past year, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease but without hospitalization in the past year, cancer but 
without metastases, and chronic kidney disease but not requiring 
dialysis).
Definition of Diabetic Control
We defined the last recorded HbA1C for each patient as their index 
HbA1C, and to mirror previous publications,4–7 we grouped HbA1C 
into <6%, 6.0% to 6.4%, 6.5% to 7.5%, and >7.5%.
Covariates, Including Medications
Health status and clinical covariates were all drawn from the database 
up to, and including, the date of the index HbA1C measurement. We 
used all prescriptions in the 120 days before the index date to es-
tablish pre-HbA1C therapy. For patients with multiple prescriptions 
within the same drug class, only the latest prescription and dose was 
used. We grouped glycemic therapies into 6 drug classes (Table), and 
combination pills were considered as belonging to both classes.
Primary Outcome (Deintensification)
We defined deintensification as discontinuation (no refill) or dosage 
decrease of at least 1 glycemic medication in the 120 days after the in-
dex HbA1C measurement without addition of, or an increase in dose 
of, another glycemic medication. Only the first prescription after the 
index HbA1C measurement but within the 120-day period was con-
sidered for each drug. For insulin, as prescription records cannot de-
fine daily dose of subcutaneous insulin, deintensification was defined 
as switching from short- and long-acting insulins to long-acting alone 
or discontinuing insulin. In a sensitivity analysis, we extended the 
post-HbA1C period for medication changes out to 180 days. In anoth-
er sensitivity analysis, we excluded patients being treated with met-
formin monotherapy only in the 120 days before the index HbA1C.
We compared deintensification rates for patients with index 
HbA1C <6.0% before February 2008 (when the National Heart Lung 
and Blood Institute stopped the intensive glycemic control arm of the 
ACCORD trial [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes]10 
and the American Diabetes Association issued a practice advisory 
highlighting the mortality increase in the intensive glucose control 
arm) with those having an index HbA1C <6.0% after February 2008. 
We also compared deintensification rates for patients who were on 
≥3 glycemic agents versus those on only 1 or 2 glucose-lowering 
therapies.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were reported as means and SDs for continuous 
variables and proportions for categorical variables. ANOVA and χ2 
tests were used to compare characteristics between HbA1C tiers. The 
proportion of patients with medication deintensification was summa-
rized by HbA1C tiers and health status (relatively healthy, multiple 
comorbidities, or frail) and compared using χ2 tests. Possible interac-
tion between health status and HbA1C was tested using a logistic 
regression model with medication deintensification as the dependent 
variable and including an interaction term in addition to health status 
and HbA1C main effects. All statistical analyses were conducted us-
ing SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC).
Results
Of 191 590 individuals with diabetes mellitus and HbA1C drawn 
after at least 12 months of follow-up, 81 113 were excluded 
because they were not being actively treated with medication 
at the time of the HbA1C assessment, and 10 783 did not have 
post-HbA1C pharmacy data out to 120 days (Figure 1).
Of 99 694 individuals receiving drug treatment for diabe-
tes mellitus (median time to the index HbA1C measurement 
823 [interquartile range, 513–1260] days), 12 921 (13.0%) 
had HbA1C <6%, 19 670 (19.7%) had HbA1C 6.0% to 
6.4%, 35 012 (35.1%) had HbA1C 6.5% to 7.5%, and 32 091 
(32.2%) had HbA1C >7.5%. Of note, as a result of using 
the last recorded HbA1C for each patient, the distribution of 
index dates was skewed toward more recent years with 58.2% 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• The benefits of intensive glucose control are uncer-
tain for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
are offset by increased risks of hypoglycemic events 
(and, in at least 1 randomized trial, of mortality), 
especially in individuals who are elderly or have 
comorbidities.
• Recent audits suggest that many individuals with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus may be potentially over-
treated in the United States, but how often treatment 
deintensification is undertaken by their physicians 
and whether this varies by glycemic control, health 
status, and calendar year is unknown.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Glycemic therapy was deintensified in less than one 
fifth of patients.
• Disintensification rates varied only slightly by 
health status (21% of frail patients, 19% of those 
with multiple comorbidities, and 18% of otherwise 
healthy patients) or glycemic levels (21% of those 
with HbA1C<6%, 17% of those with HbA1C 6.0%–
6.4%, 18% of those with HbA1C 6.5%–7.5%, and 
19% of those with HbA1C>7.5%).
• Therapy was deintensified less often in more recent 
years, even after a randomized trial reported excess 
mortality with very intensive glycemic control in type 
2 diabetes mellitus (23% of patients with index HbA1C 
<6.0% before compared with 20% after, P<0.001).

occurring in years 2009 to 2010, 22.3% in 2007 to 2008, and 
only 19.5% in 2004 to 2006. Most patients were on a single 
(50.2%) or 2 (32.7%) glucose-lowering medications (Table). 
Women, older patients, and those with lower comorbidity 
scores were more likely to have low HbA1C levels while 
patients taking multiple glycemic agents were less likely to 
have low HbA1C levels (Table). Most patients were relatively 
healthy (77.3%), but 10.6% had multiple comorbidities, and 
12.0% met our definition for frailty.
Overall, 18.3% of patients had their glycemic therapy 
deintensified after their index HbA1C with statistically sig-
nificant but small magnitude differences across HbA1C lev-
els (20.6% of those with HbA1C <6%, 17.3% of those with 
HbA1C 6.0%–6.4%, 17.7% of those with HbA1C 6.5%–
7.5%, and 18.6% of those with HbA1C >7.5%)—Figure 2. 
Deintensification was more common in patients with frailty 
(21.2%) or multiple comorbidities (19.4%) than those who 
were relatively healthy (17.7%)—both P<0.0001. There was 
no interaction between health status and measured HbA1C 
in the proportion of patients who had their therapy deintensi-
fied (P=0.6). When therapy was deintensified, the drugs most 
commonly discontinued or decreased in dose were gliptins, 
sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones (data available on 
request).
Our sensitivity analysis extending the deintensification 
window out to 180 days post-HbA1C found identical patterns 
to our primary analysis but with slightly lower proportions 
because some patients were started on another agent or had 
doses increased during the extra 60 days of follow-up: 16.0% 
of all patients had their therapy deintensified (15.5% of rela-
tively healthy patients, 16.9% of those with multiple comor-
bidities, and 18.5% of frail patients), and 18.0% of those with 
HbA1C <6.0%, 15.0% of those with HbA1C 6.0% to 6.4%, 
15.4% of those with HbA1C 6.5% to 7.5%, and 16.5% of 
those with HbA1C >7.5% had glycemic therapy deintensified.
Our sensitivity analysis excluding the 26 985 patients 
being treated with metformin monotherapy also found simi-
lar results (Figure 3): 20.5% of all patients being treated with 
agents other than metformin monotherapy had their therapy 
deintensified (19.8% of relatively healthy patients, 21.8% of 
those with multiple comorbidities, and 23.5% of frail patients; 
23.3% of those with HbA1C <6.0%, 20.4% of those with

HbA1C 6.0%–6.4%, 20.3% of those with HbA1C 6.5%–
7.5%, and 20.0% of those with HbA1C >7.5%).
Before February 2008 (and the safety signal arising from 
the ACCORD trial), 22.5% of patients with index HbA1C 
<6.0% had their therapy deintensified compared with 19.5% 
of patients with index HbA1C <6.0% after February 2008 
(P<0.001). Deintensification rates for patients with index 
HbA1C <6.0% did differ by number of diabetes mellitus med-
ications: 39.0% for patients who were on ≥3 glycemic agents 
at the time the HbA1C was measured versus 19.1% in those 
taking only 1 or 2 glucose-lowering therapies (P<0.001).
Discussion
We have shown that even in frail patients or those with mul-
tiple comorbidities, clinicians infrequently reduced their 
glucose-lowering therapies: over three quarters did not have 
any downtitration of their diabetic medications despite having 
HbA1C levels <6.5%. This confirms the findings from previous 
studies conducted in elderly patients in the Veterans’ Admin-
istration (average ages 66 and 78)6,7 or in a highly selected 
sample from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (median age 58, 
consisting of <0.6% of all diabetic individuals in the database 
as only those with at least 2 consecutive HbA1C <7% who 
survived at least 24 months after the second HbA1C were eli-
gible).11 We have not only confirmed the earlier studies’ find-
ings in a younger and less highly selected population, but we 
have also extended the evidence base by demonstrating that 
deintensification rates did not increase after the excess mortal-
ity risks with intensive glycemic control were reported from 
the ACCORD trial.10
Overtreatment of glycemia is not harmless: it markedly 
increases the risk of hypoglycemia,11 and treatment to achieve 
target HbA1C levels around 6% increased all-cause mortality 
in the ACCORD Study.10 In the United States, hypoglycemia 
is one of the most common causes for emergency department 
visits,12 and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia are now more 
frequent and have a poorer prognosis than hospitalizations for 
hyperglycemia among older adults.13 The polypharmacy usu-
ally required to achieve intensive glycemic control also places 
the patient at higher risk of other adverse drug events or drug–
drug interactions, poorer adherence with all therapies, and 
poorer quality of life.14
Why was treatment not deintensified more often in our 
cohort? A recent survey of primary care providers in the VA 
system found that many overestimated the benefits of inten-
sive glycemic control in older adults and were more concerned 
about negative repercussions from deintensifying therapy (not 
meeting performance targets and medicolegal ramifications) 
than the potential harms of tight control.8 These mispercep-
tions are not surprising given the focus in guidelines, jour-
nal publications, continuing medical education events, and

performance measures on mitigating undertreatment of dia-
betes mellitus2—in fact, only 2 of 23 performance measure 
initiatives in diabetes mellitus addressed hypoglycemia in 
a recent environmental scan.15 This situation is not unique 
to diabetes mellitus: 92% of 521 American national clinical 
performance measures for outpatient care focus on underuse, 
thereby fostering a culture of more is better and inadvertently 
encouraging overuse.16 Moreover, although pay for perfor-
mance programs provide incentives for meeting treatment 
targets, these tend to be unidirectional, and we are not aware 
of any such programs that currently reward treating some 
patients to less stringent targets.17 Although increased atten-
tion to the potential hazards of overtreatment through initia-
tives such as the Choosing Wisely movement and the Veterans 
Affairs Hypoglycemia Safety Initiative will improve physi-
cian awareness of this issue, educational interventions alone 
will be insufficient to bring about practice change.18 Clinical 
inertia is one of the main barriers to the uptake of new inter-
ventions or treatment targets in health care19 and will also be 
a barrier to deimplementation of practices proven to be inef-
ficient or harmful. For example, we found that patients with 
low HbA1C levels were not more likely to have their therapy 
deintensified after the excess mortality in the intensive glyce-
mic control arm of ACCORD was reported, and others have 
reported that stringent glycemic control in intensive care units 
declined little despite publication of a randomized trial dem-
onstrating potential harm from overtreatment).20
Although our study has several strengths because of the 
availability of detailed clinical data in a relatively large popu-
lation-based sample of patients with new diagnoses of diabetes 
mellitus, there are some limitations to our work. First, as the 
clinical records may have undercaptured some comorbidities 
(such as dementia, chronic pain, or depression), we may have 
underestimated the proportion of individuals with multiple 
comorbidities and thus underestimated the proportion who are 
potentially overtreated. Second, it should be acknowledged 
that there may be valid clinical reasons (including patient pref-
erences) for treating particular patients to an intensive HbA1C 
goal even if they have comorbidities—thus, intensive control 
does not necessarily mean overtreatment in all cases. Third, 
although we examined deintensification rates after a single 
HbA1C value, the VA investigators6 reported that rates of 
deintensification were similar whether they analyzed patients 
with ≥2 low values or just a single low HbA1C measurement. 
Fourth, it should be a acknowledged that rates of deintensifi-
cation may be higher for patients who have been treated for 
longer—however, this is a testable hypothesis that has not 
yet, to our knowledge, been explored in the literature and 
the literature on clinical inertia19 suggests that in fact therapy 
changes are most likely early in treatment courses. Finally, we 
may have underestimated rates of deintensification because 
we did not know whether insulin doses had been decreased or 
whether patients were given the same prescriptions but told to 
split pills or take pills less frequently.
In conclusion, deintensification of glycemic therapy did 
not differ appreciably across HbA1C strata, and less than one 
quarter of treated adults with HbA1C levels <6.5% had their 
glycemic medications reduced even in the presence of frailty 
or multiple comorbidities. This proportion did not increase 
even after the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute advi-
sory issued on February 6, 2008 about excess mortality with 
intensive glycemic control in the ACCORD trial. Increased 
attention to the potential hazards of overtreatment will improve 
physician awareness of this issue, but deintensification of long-
term therapy is the next frontier for improving care quality.18
