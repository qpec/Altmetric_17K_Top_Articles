The hippocampus is critical for the acquisition and retrieval of episodic and contextual
memories. Lesions of the dentate gyrus, a principal input of the hippocampus, block memory
acquisition, but it remains unclear whether this region also plays a role in memory retrieval.
Here we combine cell-type specific neural inhibition with electrophysiological measurements
of learning-associated plasticity in behaving mice to demonstrate that dentate gyrus granule
cells are not required for memory retrieval, but instead have an unexpected role in memory
maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the translational potential of our findings by
showing that pharmacological activation of an endogenous inhibitory receptor expressed
selectively in dentate gyrus granule cells can induce a rapid loss of hippocampal memory.
These findings open a new avenue for the targeted erasure of episodic and contextual
memories.

he hippocampus is an evolutionarily ancient part of the
cortex that makes reciprocal excitatory connections with
neocortical association areas and is critical for the
acquisition and retrieval of episodic and contextual memories.
The hippocampus has been the subject of extensive investigation
over the last 50 years as the site of plasticity thought to be critical
for memory encoding. Models of hippocampal function propose
that sensory information reaching the hippocampus from the
entorhinal cortex via dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells is encoded
in CA3 auto-association circuits and can in turn be retrieved
via Schaffer collateral (SC) projections linking CA3 and CA1
(refs 1–4; Fig. 1a). Learning-associated plasticity in CA3–CA3
auto-associative
networks encodes the memory trace,
and
plasticity in SC connections is necessary for the efficient retrieval
of this trace2,5–10. In addition, both CA3 and CA1 regions receive
direct, monosynaptic inputs from entorhinal cortex that are
thought to convey information about ongoing sensory inputs that
could modulate CA3 memory trace acquisition and/or retrieval
via SC (refs 11–13; Fig. 1a). In DG granule cells, sensory
information is thought to undergo pattern separation into
orthogonal cell ensembles before encoding (or reactivating, in
the case of retrieval) memories in CA3 (ref. 14). However, how
the hippocampus executes both the acquisition and recall of
memories stored in CA3 remains a question of debate with some
models attributing a role for DG inputs in memory acquisition,
but not retrieval2,15–17.
Here we combined a pharmacogenetic approach for the rapid
and transient suppression of neural activity with in vivo
electrophysiology during trace eye-blink conditioning to examine
the contribution of DG to hippocampal learning and plasticity.
Our studies demonstrate that activity in DG granule cells is not
necessary for the retrieval of hippocampal memory. Unexpect-
edly, inhibition of DG is associated with a rapid and persistent
loss of memory, as revealed by the suppression of both
conditioned responding and learning-associated plasticity. Phar-
macogenetic inhibition of entorhinal cortex or local delivery of
adenosine A1 receptor antagonist into the hippocampus reverse
the suppression of learning-associated plasticity, suggesting a role
for direct entorhinal-CA1 inputs in promoting memory loss.
Similar memory impairment can be induced by DG inhibition
during trace fear conditioning, demonstrating its generalization
across hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Finally, we show
that activation of an endogenous inhibitory receptor (neuropep-
tide Y1 receptor) selectively expressed in DG granule cells can
similarly induce rapid and persistent memory loss, opening the
possibility of the targeted erasure of hippocampal memories.
Results
Rapid pharmacogenetic inhibition of DG granule cells. Until
recently, a major limitation in resolving the mechanism of
hippocampal function has been the lack of tools that allow for
the rapid, transient, efficient and specific inhibition of selected
hippocampal cell-types to directly assess their contribution to
memory. Here we applied a pharmacogenetic neuronal inhibition
strategy that we had previously used to rapidly suppress the firing
of DG granule cells in living mice18,19 to dissect the role of this
hippocampal input structure in memory. This pharmacogenetic
neural inhibition system depends on the systemic administration
of
the
selective
serotonin
1A
receptor
(Htr1a)
agonist,
8-OH-DPAT, to transgenic mice expressing Htr1a exclusively
in DG granule cells (Htr1aKO/Htr1aKO;Nrip2::Htr1a/ þ , called
Htr1aDG). Consistent with previous experiments in brain slices18
neurotransmission
via
DG
mossy
fibres
was
rapidly
and
significantly
suppressed
in
Htr1aDG
mice
treated
with
8-OH-DPAT as revealed by an B80% reduction of field
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in CA3 by
electrical stimulation of perforant path (PP) inputs (Fig. 1b–d).
Importantly, the short latency fEPSP component that reflects
direct entorhinal inputs to CA3 was unaffected by 8-OH-DPAT
treatment20,21 (Supplementary Fig. 1; n ¼ 10, P ¼ 0.477, two-way
analysis of variance followed by Holm–Sidak post hoc test).
Neither agonist treatment of Htr1aKO control littermates nor
vehicle
treatment
of
wild-type
mice
affected
synaptic
transmission (Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate that the
8-OH-DPAT/Htr1a pharmacogenetic inhibition system is able
to rapidly and selectively suppress neurotransmission via DG
granule cells in vivo.
DG inhibition induces loss of plasticity and memory. To define
the contribution of DG to the retrieval of hippocampal memory,
we
combined
our
pharmacogenetic
strategy
with
in

electrophysiology during trace eye-blink conditioning (Fig. 2a–c).

 To determine whether the persistent loss of memory on
transient
DG
inhibition
was
associated
with
a
loss
of
learning-associated plasticity, we monitored synaptic changes in
SC during eye-blink conditioning (Fig. 2a–e and Supplementary
Fig. 2). SC synaptic plasticity increased in parallel with eye-blink
conditioning and reached an asymptotic mean value of 130% on
day 8 of conditioning (Fig. 2e). Surprisingly, 8-OH-DPAT
treatment of Htr1aDG, but not Htr1aKO littermates on day 8
was associated with a significant depotentiation of SC (Fig. 2e)
demonstrating that maintenance of SC synaptic plasticity was
dependent on inputs from upstream DG granule cells. Moreover,
SC plasticity continued to be significantly reduced in Htr1aDG,
but not Htr1aKO mice on the day following agonist treatment
(day 9, Fig. 2e) and did not reach control levels before day 12.
Similar results were found in an independent experimental group,
demonstrating the robust nature of DG inhibition-induced loss
of memory and plasticity (Supplementary Fig. 3). No change
in conditioned responding or SC plasticity were observed in
Htr1aKO mice receiving 8-OH-DPAT or wild-type, Htr1aDG, or
Htr1aKO mice receiving saline on day 8 (Supplementary Fig. 3)
confirming that the transgene does not interfere with the
measured behaviour or plasticity. These observations suggest
that the rapid and persistent loss of conditioned responding
seen following DG inhibition is caused by a parallel loss of
SC plasticity.
Finally, we examined whether the loss of memory and plasticity
induced by DG inhibition was persistent. Mice were exposed
from day 1 to 8 to tone–shock (conditioned stimulus-uncondi-
tioned stimulus, CS-US) pairs and pretreated on day 8 with 8-
OH-DPAT to induce DG inhibition. As before, Htr1aDG, but not
Htr1aKO mice showed a significant deficit in conditioned
responding (Fig. 2f) and SC plasticity (Fig. 2g) on day 8. To
test the persistence of these deficits, mice were left in their home
cages on days 9–13 and then exposed to paired CS–US
presentations from day 14 to 18. Remarkably, both conditioned
responding and SC plasticity remained suppressed in Htr1aDG
mice when compared with Htr1aKO littermates on day 14 in a
manner indistinguishable from day 8 (Fig. 2f,g). From day 14 to
18 conditioned responding and SC plasticity in Htr1aDG mice
rose gradually to control levels as a result of learning associated
with paired CS–US presentation. These data demonstrate that the
rapid loss of memory and plasticity induced by DG inhibition is
persistent
and
that
subsequent
relearning
of
the
CS–US
association follows the same time course as initial learning.
Memory loss depends on paired CS–US exposure. To determine
whether DG inhibition was sufficient to induce loss of plasticity
and memory, we tested mice exposed from day 1 to 7 to
tone–shock pairs, but left in the home cage on day 8. Under these
conditions DG inhibition on day 8 was not associated with a
significant alteration in conditioned responding or SC plasticity
(Fig. 3a,b) demonstrating that DG inhibition by itself does not
induce synaptic depotentiation or memory loss and is not
associated with a general deficit in performance or SC plasticity.
Next, we tested whether DG inhibition coupled to tone only
exposure on day 8 would induce memory loss. Under these
conditions DG inhibition was not associated with a significant
alteration in conditioned responding or SC plasticity (Fig. 3c,d).
This finding suggests that presentation of both CS and US are
necessary during DG inhibition to induce synaptic depotentiation
and memory loss. It also shows that DG inhibition does not
induce memory loss by enhancing extinction, a form of memory
loss and synaptic depotentiation induced by exposure to tone
presentation5 (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Finally, we examined whether associative pairing of CS and US
during DG inhibition was necessary for memory loss. DG
inhibition on day 8 was coupled with exposure to explicitly
unpaired
CS
and
US
presentations,
a
pseudoconditioning
protocol that we have previously shown does not support
associative learning5. Under these conditions DG inhibition was
not able to induce loss of memory or plasticity (Fig. 3e,f)
demonstrating
a
requirement
for
the
associative,
paired
presentation of CS and US in the memory loss mechanism.
Importantly, spectral power of CA1 recordings were unaffected
by DG inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 4) ruling out an indirect
effect of altered rhythmic activity on SC plasticity. Together, these
findings argue that blockade of neural activity in DG unmasks a
depotentiation mechanism that rapidly reverses SC plasticity
during associative presentation of tone and shock and that causes
a persistent impairment in hippocampal memory retrieval.
Loss of plasticity depends on entorhinal cortex inputs. In vitro
electrophysiological experiments with hippocampal slices have
shown that stimulation of PP inputs to CA1 is able to reverse
long-term potentiation induced at SC synapses11–13,23 suggesting
that learning-associated activity in PP inputs to CA1 might be
involved in the DG inhibition-induced SC depotentiation. To test
this hypothesis we repeated our trace eye-blink conditioning
experiments in mice in which activity in entorhinal cortex neurons
could be selectively inhibited. Htr1aDG mice were bilaterally
infected in the entorhinal cortex with adeno-associated virus
(AAV) expressing Venus fluorescent protein and the inhibitory
hM4D DREADD receptor24 under a neuron-specific promoter25
(AAV-hSyn::Venus-2A-hM4D; Fig. 4a). Selective expression of
Venus reporter in entorhinal cortex neurons and their efferents to
DG, CA3 and CA1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence
(Fig. 4b). Control electrophysiology experiments in anaesthetized
wild-type mice similarly infected with AAV-hSyn::Venus-2A-
hM4D and systemically injected with the selective hM4D agonist
clozapine-N-oxide (CNO (ref. 24)) demonstrated a significant
suppression of PP-CA1 neurotransmission, as revealed by a B50%
reduction of fEPSPs evoked in CA1 by electrical stimulation
of the olfactory bulb-entorhinal cortex pathway26 (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Fig. 5), although we cannot exclude a contribution
of volume conduction from PP–DG inputs to the measured evoked
responses. SC synaptic plasticity was monitored in infected
Htr1aDG mice during trace eye-blink conditioning (Fig. 4d). On
day 8 of training, mice were pretreated with either vehicle or CNO
to suppress PP-CA1 inputs and administered 8-OH-DPAT to
induce SC depotentiation (Fig. 4d). As expected, learning-induced
SC plasticity was strongly depotentiated in vehicle-pretreated
animals receiving 8-OH-DPAT (Fig. 4e). However, depotentiation
was significantly attenuated in CNO-pretreated mice (Fig. 4e).
These data support a role for entorhinal cortex inputs to the
hippocampus in promoting the depotentiation of SC synaptic
plasticity induced by DG inhibition.
Loss of plasticity involves local adenosine signalling. Hippo-
campal slice experiments demonstrated that PP stimulation-
induced SC depotentiation could be blocked by treatment with an
antagonist of adenosine A1 receptors, suggesting that local release
of adenosine in response to PP-CA1 stimulation was necessary to
induce long-term depression at SC synapses22,27. To test whether a
similar mechanism might underlie the depotentiation of SC
synapses seen during DG inhibition in vivo, we repeated our
earlier experiment with local, bilateral administration of the
adenosine
A1
receptor
antagonist
1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclo-
pentylxanthine (DPCPX) into dorsal CA1 on day 8 (Fig. 4f,g
and Supplementary Fig. 6). As expected, Htr1aDG mice treated
with vehicle showed a marked depotentiation of SC plasticity
following DG inhibition on day 8 and this effect was significantly

 attenuated in mice pretreated with DPCPX (Fig. 4g). Importantly,
DPCPX treatment on day 8 was associated with a long-term
blockade of SC plasticity deficits on the following days (Fig. 4g).
The administration of DPCPX in Htr1aKO mice either alone or
together with 8-OH-DPAT had no significant effect on plasticity,
although there was a trend for DPCPX to increase SC plasticity on
the treatment day (Supplementary Fig. 6) suggesting a role for
adenosine-dependent depotentiation during undisturbed learning.
These data demonstrate that the persistent depotentiation of SC
synapses induced by DG inhibition is the result of an adenosine A1
receptor-dependent, long-term depression-like phenomenon in
region CA1 and further implicate direct entorhinal inputs to CA1
in SC depotentiation.
Generalization of memory loss phenomenon. To examine
whether DG inhibition-induced memory loss is a general feature
of hippocampal learning, we examined the role of DG granule
cells in trace fear conditioning, a widely used hippocampus-
dependent
memory
task.
Htr1aDG
and
control
Htr1aKO
littermate mice were subjected to trace fear conditioning by
placing them into a chamber (context A) and exposing them to a
series of paired tone and foot shock stimuli separated by 20 s
(Fig. 5a; six tone–shock pairs; tone: 20 s, 3 kHz; shock: 2 s,
0.4 mA). One day later the mice were placed into a novel context
(context B) and freezing behaviour during the presentation of the
tone was assessed as a measure of fear conditioning recall
(recall 1; Fig. 5a). Immediately thereafter, mice were removed
from context B and placed back into the same context with an
exposed grid floor and subjected to either a second training
session (six tone–shock pairs; tone: 20 s, 3 kHz; shock: 2 s,
0.4 mA) or to a series of identical tones without shock (tone only).
Mice were pretreated on the second day with 8-OH-DPAT to
induce DG inhibition during both recall and subsequent learning.
Finally, 1 day later, mice were placed into a third context (context
C) to test their recall in the absence of DG inhibition (recall 2;
Fig. 5a). Although treatment of Htr1aDG mice with 8-OH-DPAT
did not affect trace fear conditioning recall (recall 1), it was
associated with a significant impairment of recall on the day
following treatment (recall 2, Fig. 5b). Importantly, similar
treatment of Htr1aDG mice exposed only to tones on the second
day (Fig. 5c) was not associated with deficient recall, consistent
with tone–shock association being required for memory loss.
Htr1aKO littermates treated with 8-OH-DPAT did not show
impaired recall on either day (Fig. 5b,c) confirming a requirement
for DG inhibition in the fear conditioning deficit.

 Memory loss can be induced by Npy1r activation. Finally, we
asked whether we could induce memory loss by manipulating
neural activity in DG granule cells without the need for transgenic
pharmacogenetic inhibition technology. Such an approach might
offer a promising method for the targeted reversal of unwanted
memories in other species, including humans. A search of the
Allen Brain Atlas gene expression database28 identified a somato-

Npy1r (ref. 29). Control experiments in anaesthetized wild-type

whether the Npy1r agonist could induce memory loss. Similar to

 freezing on the second recall session (recall 2; Fig. 5d). No deficit
in conditioned responding was observed on the first recall day
(recall 1) during drug treatment, nor on either day in mice
exposed to only tones on the first recall day (tone only; Fig. 5e).
These data show that activation of an endogenous inhibitory
receptor expressed selectively in DG granule cells can be used to
induce learning-associated memory loss, and suggest an avenue
for the translation of these findings to other organisms.
Discussion
In the present study we examined the contribution of DG granule
cells to learning and recall and its associated synaptic plasticity in
animals that had previously acquired a hippocampal memory.
We found that transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of DG
granule cells did not impair conditioned responding to CS
presentation nor alter SC synaptic plasticity demonstrating that
DG is not required for memory recall (Fig. 3c,d). However, when
DG inhibition occurred during paired presentation of CS and US,
we observed a rapid loss of SC synaptic plasticity and conditioned
responding to CS (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Strikingly,
the synaptic plasticity and behavioural impairment persisted in
the absence of further stimulus presentation and later relearning
occurred at a rate indistinguishable from initial learning,
suggesting a loss of the memory trace (Fig. 2f,g).
One possible explanation for the memory loss seen on DG
inhibition is that presentation of paired CS–US has a dual effect
on CA1 plasticity, on the one hand strengthening SC synapses via
a DG-dependent mechanism (indirect inputs to CA1 via the tri-
synaptic circuit) and on the other hand weakening SC synapses in
a non-DG-dependent manner (direct PP-CA1 inputs). This
explanation is consistent with several studies in the literature
reporting mechanistic and functional differences between the
direct and the indirect inputs to CA1 (refs 12,13,30–32). Further-
more, earlier in vitro12,23 and in vivo33 electrophysiology studies
found that stimulation of PP-CA1 inputs to the hippocampus
could depotentiate synaptic plasticity that had been previously
acquired at SC synapses suggesting that the direct PP pathway
might promote depotentiation during hippocampal learning. To
test this possibility, we used dual, orthogonal pharmacogenetic
inhibition of DG and entorhinal cortex to show that the memory
loss phenomenon we observed depended on PP inputs (Fig. 4e).
Furthermore, one of the earlier studies23 had shown that PP
stimulation-induced SC depotentiation could be inhibited by
blockade of adenosine A1 receptors, but not several other
receptors, and we found that bilateral administration of DPCPX
to the CA1 region of the hippocampus blocked synaptic
depotentiation in our model (Fig. 4g).
Our data lead us to propose a novel function for PP-CA1
inputs to the hippocampus. During CS–US presentation, but not
during presentation of unpaired CS–US or CS alone, information
arriving via this pathway actively promotes depotentiation of SC
synapses, while information arriving via the DG pathway opposes
this depotentiation. Thus, in an animal that has successfully
acquired a hippocampal-dependent memory, and in which the
direct and indirect pathways are intact, SC synaptic strength is
stable and memories can be retrieved. However, when the DG
pathway is blocked, as we have done artificially in our study,
depotentiation is favoured and memory is lost (see scheme,
Fig. 6). The precise function of PP-dependent SC depotentiation
remains unclear at this point, but we speculate that it may play a
role in weakening previously acquired associations to facilitate
the encoding of new memories. Existing data show that
selective blockade of synaptic activity in entorhinal cortex
neurons projecting to CA1 impairs the acquisition of trace
fear conditioning34 and support our hypothesis of a positive
role for this pathway in learning13,30,32,33. Moreover, our DPCPX
experiments
suggest
that
blockade
of
the
depotentiation
mechanism promotes SC synaptic plasticity during CS–US
presentation in otherwise intact animals (Fig. 4g). However,

 further loss and gain-of-function manipulations of this pathway
coupled with in vivo electrophysiology and learning behaviour are
needed to directly test a role of PP-CA1 inputs in memory
clearing.
Our finding that DG granule cells are not required for retrieval
of hippocampal memory is consistent with previous data arguing
that retrieval of associative information encoded in CA3–CA3
and SC plasticity is achieved via direct PP projections to CA3
(refs 1–4,35–38). However, our data appear to contradict at least
one recent study demonstrating a role for DG granule cells in
retrieval during contextual fear conditioning39. We believe this
discrepancy is due to a requirement for DG granule cells in the
processing of the contextual CS (ref. 40). However, to rule out
the possibility that other methodological differences between
the studies underlie the discrepancy, it would be important
to
determine
whether
the
cell-type
specific
optogenetic
inhibition method used in their study left intact the recall of
hippocampal-dependent memories for discrete cues.
Our study raises several questions. First, while we show SC
depotentiation is adenosine receptor dependent, the location of
adenosine signalling is not clear. Adenosine A1 receptors are
expressed highly in CA3 pyramidal cells as well as more modestly
in CA1 (ref. 28), and a study in which this receptor was selectively
knocked out in one or the other of these structures demonstrated
a role for presynaptic CA3, but not postsynaptic CA1 receptors in
dampening SC neurotransmission41 suggesting a presynaptic
mechanism for our effect. The source of adenosine, on the other
hand, could involve pre- and/or postsynaptic release as well as
release from non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes27,42. Second,
although our DPCPX experiment pointed to a role for PP-CA1
projections
in
SC
depotentiation,
our
entorhinal
cortex
pharmacogenetic inhibition experiment did not allow us to
distinguish between contributions of PP-CA1 and PP-CA3
inputs. Although we cannot rule out a contribution of PP-CA3
projections to SC depotentiation, earlier in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiology studies clearly demonstrate a role for PP-CA1
in SC depotentiation12,22,33. Third, the method we used to assess
SC postsynaptic strength, namely electrical stimulation evoked
field potentials does not allow us to rule out that changes in
synaptic plasticity at non-SC inputs underlie our plasticity effects.
Experiments using targeted optogenetic stimulation of CA3
efferents could be used to more selectively measure SC synaptic
strength.
Fourth,
our
observation
that
SC
depotentiation
and
memory
loss
occurred
only
during
paired,
but
not
unpaired CS–US presentation (Fig. 2d,e) suggests that the
memory loss phenomenon we describe is distinct from other
well-described
avenues
for
memory
degradation,
including
enhancement of extinction43 and blockade of reconsolidation44.
Finally,
our
findings
demonstrating
generalization
of
DG
inhibition-induced memory loss across tasks coupled with our
identification of an endogenous pharmacological target that can
induce similar memory loss raise the possibility that the novel
memory mechanism we have uncovered may be useful for erasing
unwanted memories in a clinical setting.
Methods
Animals. Transgenic mice (genetic background: B6J;CBA;129S6/SvEvTac) were
littermates derived from breeding Htr1aKO/Htr1aKO;Nrip2-Htr1a/ þ and Htr1aKO/
Htr1aKO; þ / þ mice18 (called Htr1aDG and Htr1aKO, respectively) following
protocols approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and shipped to Pablo Olavide
University for experimental testing following experimental protocols approved by
the University Ethics Committee and the Spanish Ministry of Health and in
accordance with the guidelines of the European Union (2010/276:33–79/EU) and
Spanish regulations (BOE 34:11370-421, 2013). Wild-type animals used for trace fear
conditioning (genetic background: C57BL/6J) were derived from an internal EMBL
breeding colony and tested following an experimental protocol approved by the
Italian Ministry of Health. Experiments were carried out with male and female
littermates that were 3–5 months old. Animals were group housed, switched to
individual cages following surgery, and kept on a 12h light/dark cycle (lights on at
8:00) with constant ambient temperature (21.5±1 �C) and humidity (55±8%). Food
and water were available ad libitum. All mice that completed experimental protocols
in the absence of deteriorated fEPSPs, electroencephalogram and/or
electromyographic recordings were included. Additional animals were used in
preliminary studies to select the appropriate drug doses and test the stability of
recording and stimulating systems.
Surgery. Mice were anaesthetized with 0.8–1.5% isoflurane, supplied from a
calibrated Fluotec 5 vaporizer (Fluotec-Ohmeda, Tewksbury, MA) at a flow rate of
1–2 l min � 1 oxygen (AstraZeneca, Madrid, Spain) and delivered by a mouse
anaesthesia mask (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). For trace eye-blink
conditioning animals were implanted with bipolar recording electrodes in the left
orbicularis oculi muscle and stimulating electrodes on the ipsilateral supraorbital
nerve (Fig. 2a). These electrodes were made from 50 mm, Teflon-coated, annealed
stainless steel wire (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA). For measurement of SC
synaptic efficacy animals were implanted with stimulating electrodes in the right
SC/commissural pathway of the dorsal hippocampus45 (1.5 mm posterior to
bregma, 2 mm lateral, and 1–1.5 mm from the brain surface) and with a recording
electrode in the right CA1 stratum radiatum (2.2 mm posterior to bregma, 1.2 mm
lateral and 1–1.5 mm from the brain surface; Figs 2a,c and 4d,f and Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Hippocampal electrodes were made from 50 mm, Teflon-coated, tungsten
wire (Advent Research, Eynsham, UK). All the implanted wires were soldered to
two four-pin sockets (RS Amidata, Madrid, Spain) and fixed to the skull with
dental cement5. Recording electrodes were aimed at the apical dendrites of
pyramidal CA1 cells5,46 and their final location was adjusted by the profile of
fEPSPs evoked by SC stimulation during surgery. For experiments to determine the
activity of DG granule cells, animals were implanted with stimulating electrodes in
the perforant pathway (2.2 mm posterior to bregma, 2 mm lateral and 1 mm from
the brain surface) and recording electrodes in the pyramidal CA3 area (1.5 mm
posterior to bregma, 1.7 mm lateral and 1.3 mm from the brain surface; Fig. 1b).
For experiments to inhibit entorhinal-hippocampal neurons, four bilateral
injections of AAV aimed at the entorhinal cortex (posterior: � 4.8 mm, lateral:
±3 mm to bregma, depth: � 3.25 mm and � 2.75 mm from Bregma; posterior:
� 4.6 mm, lateral: ±2.88 mm to bregma, depth: � 3.25 mm and � 2.75 mm from
Bregma; Fig. 4b,d) were performed using a glass pipette (intraMARK, 10–20 mm tip
diameter, Blaubrand, Wertheim, Germany) connected to a syringe and a
stereotaxic micromanipulator (0.4 ml of AAV-containing solution per hemisphere).
Behavioural experiments were performed 2–3 weeks after surgery. To determine
the extent of inhibition of entorhinal cortex-CA1 synaptic transmission in AAV
infected mice, stimulating electrodes in the olfactory bulb (4.0 mm anterior to
bregma, 1.0 mm lateral and 2.2 mm from the brain surface) and recording
electrodes in CA1 (2.2 posterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral and 1.3 from the brain
surface; Fig. 4c) were implanted in a second surgical procedure. For local drug
administration animals were bilaterally implanted with a 26-gauge stainless steel
guide cannula in dorsal CA1 (Plastics One; 1.94 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.6 mm

CA1 of the hippocampus receives information directly from the entorhinal
cortex (direct PP-CA1 pathway) and also indirectly via the tri-synaptic
circuit. (a) Presentation of paired CS–US promotes potentiation of SC
synapses ( þ ) via the indirect pathway depotentiation of SC synapses (–)

learning, potentiation and depotentiation are balanced, SC synaptic strength
is stable and memories can be retrieved. (b) Inhibition of DG during CS–US

Fig. 4f) or unilaterally implanted in the right lateral ventricle (1 mm lateral and
0.46 mm posterior to Bregma, and 1.4 mm from the brain surface). Guide cannulae
were anchored to the skull by dental cement. After completing surgery stainless
steel stylets were inserted into the guide cannula and left in place until injections
were made.
Recording and stimulating procedures. Recording sessions were carried out with
three animals at a time. Animals were placed in separate small (5 � 5 � 10 cm3)
plastic chambers located inside a larger Faraday box (30 � 30 � 20 cm3). The
electromyographic activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle and the hippocampal
field activity were recorded with Grass P511 differential amplifiers
(Grass-Telefactor, West Warwick, RI) at a bandwidth of 0.1 Hz–10 kHz. Field EPSP
recordings were also made with Grass P511 differential amplifiers through a
high-impedance (2 � 1012 O, 10 pF) probe. Animals were presented with single
square-wave current pulses of different intensities (0.02–0.3 mA). Unless otherwise
indicated, single pulses were presented at intensities corresponding to 30–40% of
the amount necessary to evoke a saturating response5. At the range of intensities
used here, no population spikes were observed in the collected recordings. For
baseline recordings and to determine the stability of fEPSPs evoked by the electrical
stimulation of SCs, single pulses were presented at a rate of 1/20 s. To avoid
possible interference with the animal’s state of alertness47 training sessions lasted
for 30 min and were carried out at the same time each day for the same animal. No
particular change in the behavioural state of experimental animals was observed
across the successive sessions.
Classical eye-blink conditioning. Classical conditioning was achieved using a
trace paradigm (Fig. 2b). A tone (20 ms, 2.4 kHz and 85 dB) was presented as
conditioned stimulus, while a 500 ms, 3 � threshold, square and cathodal pulse
applied to the supraorbital nerve served as unconditioned stimulus. The shock
started 500 ms after the end of the tone. A total of two habituation, 10–12 con-
ditioning, and five extinction sessions were carried out. A conditioning session
consisted of 60 tone–shock presentations, and lasted E30 min. For a proper
analysis of conditioned responses, the tone was presented alone in 10% of the cases.
Tone–shock presentations were separated at random by 30±5 s. Animals received
one training session per day. For habituation (and extinction) sessions the tone was
presented alone 60 times per session, at intervals of 30±5 s. As criteria, we con-
sidered a successful conditioned response the presence, during the tone–shock
interval, of electromyographic activity lasting 410 ms and initiated 450 ms after
tone onset. In addition, the integrated electromyographic activity recorded during
the tone–shock interval had to be at least 2.5 times greater than the averaged
activity recorded immediately before tone presentation48. Field EPSPs were evoked
in CA1 during conditioning by presentations of pulses (100 ms, square) applied to
SC 300 ms after tone presentation.
Fear conditioning. Trace fear conditioning experiments took place in chambers
(14 � 15 � 12 cm3, MED Associates, Georgia, VT) housed in sound-attenuating
cubicles. Different visual, olfactory and tactile cues were used to configure different
contexts (contexts A, B and C). Animals were placed in individual chambers in a
novel context (context A) for 100 s before receiving six tone–foot shock pairings
(tone: 20 s, 85 dB, 3 kHz; shock: 2 s, 0.4 mA) with the stimuli separated by a 20-s
trace interval. A 100-s inter-trial interval was used. Twenty-four hours after
conditioning in context A the animals were placed in the chamber configured as a
novel context (context B) and were allowed 100 s to habituate to the context before
a 60-s tone (85 dB, 3 kHz) was presented (recall 1). Immediately after recall 1 the
animals were removed from the chamber, the plastic floor covering was removed to
reveal the shock grid, and the mice were replaced. The mice then received another
six tone–foot shock pairings (tone þ shock) or only six tones (tone only). A second
recall session (recall 2, context C) took place 24 h after recall 1. Freezing, defined as
the complete absence of movement except for respiration, was scored manually for
each recall session from video recordings and the difference between percentage of
time freezing during the tone and percentage of time freezing during the pre-tone
period was used as a measure of conditioned response to tone (Dfreezing (%)).
Viral production. The Venus-P2A-HA-hM4D cassette25 was cloned so as to
replace the open reading frame of pAAV-Syn-NpHR3.0-EYFP-WPRE (gift of
K. Deisseroth, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). Production and purification of
recombinant AAV (chimeric capsid serotype 1/2) were as described49. Viral titres
(41010 genomic copies per ml) were determined with QuickTiter AAV
Quantitation Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA) and RT-PCR50.
Drug administration. The Htr1a selective agonist 8-hydroxy-N-[di-n-propyl]-
aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT; Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA) was dissolved in saline
(0.9% NaCl) and injected (subcutaneously in a volume of 5 ml kg � 1) 15 min before
behavioural testing into the scruff of the neck. The non-selective adenosine A1
receptor antagonist, DPCPX (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 mM dimethyl
sulfoxide and delivered via bilateral guide cannulae to the dorsal hippocampus
(82 nmol per mouse; injection volume: 1.5 ml per hippocampus; flow rate:
0.3 ml min � 1) 10 min before testing. The selective Npy1r agonist [Pro30, Nle31,
Bpa32, Leu34]NPY(28–36) was synthesized (ref. 29), dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl)
and delivered via unilateral guide cannula to the right lateral ventricle (20 nmol per
mouse; injection volume: 2 ml; flow rate: 1 ml min � 1) 20 min before testing. The
selective hM4D agonist CNO (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) was dissolved
in saline (0.9% NaCl) and systemically injected (3 mg kg � 1, intraperitoneal) 60 min
before testing.
Histology. At the end of the recording sessions mice were deeply anaesthetized
(sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg kg � 1) and perfused transcardially with saline and
4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected, postfixed
overnight at 4 �C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Sections were obtained
on a microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 50 mm. Selected sections including
the dorsal hippocampus were mounted on gelatinized glass slides and stained using
the Nissl technique with 0.1% toluidine blue to determine the location of stimu-
lating and recording electrodes and cannulae bilaterally implanted in dorsal CA1.
To determine the location of cannulae implanted into the lateral ventricle mice
were infused with 2 ml of 2% cresyl violet dye. Following euthanasia, intact whole
brains were rapidly removed from the skull and flash frozen in isopentane. Brain
slices were prepared at 30 mm and mounted on glass slides. Correct guide cannula
placement was judged by dye staining of the ventricular border. To determine the
location of viral infection animals were transcardially perfused (4% paraf-
ormaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer and pH 7.4) and brains removed and left
overnight in fixative. Coronal sections (40 mm) were cut on a vibratome
(Leica Microsystems). All sections were imaged for Venus and 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole fluorescence with a motorized wide-field microscope (Leica Micro-
systems). No entorhinal cortex-infected animals were excluded from the analysis.
Data collection and analysis. Electromyographic, extracellular hippocampal
activity and 1-volt rectangular pulses corresponding to tone and shock presenta-
tions were stored digitally on a computer via an analogue/digital converter (CED
1401 Plus, Cambridge, England) at a sampling frequency of 11–22 kHz and with an
amplitude resolution of 12 bits. Data were analysed off-line for quantification of
conditioned responses and fEPSP slopes with the help of commercial (Spike 2 and
SIGAVG from CED) and custom5,48 programs. The slope of evoked fEPSPs was
computed as the first derivative (V s � 1) of fEPSP recordings (V). For this, five
successive fEPSPs were averaged, and the mean value of the slope during the rise
time period (that is, between the initial and final 10% of the fEPSP) was
determined. Computed results were processed for statistical analysis using the
Sigma Stat software package (SSI, San Jose, CA). Power spectra of hippocampal
field activity were computed using fast Fourier transform with a Hanning window
expressed as relative power and averaged for each session and/or group. Average
power spectra were analysed and compared using the wide-band model,
considering theta, beta and gamma bands described previously51. Acquired data
were analysed using two-way analysis of variance, with days as repeated measure
followed by Holm–Sidak post hoc testing, or t-test.
