A shared genetic pre-disposition, chronic inflammation, and treatment with similar
biologics between Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn’s disease (CD) have intrigued
us to investigate whether the two disorders share trigger association or possible
causation. We hypothesized earlier that Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the negative regulators Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-receptor type 2 and 22
(PTPN2/22) lead to a dysregulated immune response, susceptibility to environmental
triggers, and continued apoptosis as seen in chronic inflammation in RA and CD.
To test the hypothesis, peripheral leukocytes samples from 132 consented subjects
were genotyped for 9 SNPs in PTPN2/22 using TaqManTM genotyping. The effect
of the SNPs on PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ expression was determined using real time
PCR. T-cell proliferation and response to phytohematoagglutonin (PHA) mitogen and
mycobacterial antigens were determined by BrdU proliferation assay. Blood samples
were also analyzed for the Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP)
IS900 gene by nPCR. Out of 9 SNPs examined, heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC)
alleles of PTPN2:rs478582 occurred in 79% RA compared to 60% healthy controls
(p-values ≤ 0.05; OR = 2.28). Similarly, heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles of
PTPN22:rs2476601 occurred in 29% RA compared to 6% healthy controls (p-values
≤ 0.05; OR = 5.90). PTPN2/22 expression in RA was decreased by 1.2-fold
compared to healthy controls. PTPN2:rs478582 upregulated IFN-γ in RA by 1.5-fold.
Combined PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 increased T-cell proliferation by
2.7-fold when treated with PHA. Surprisingly, MAP DNA was detected in 34% of
RA samples compared to 8% healthy controls, (p-values ≤ 0.05, OR = 5.74). RA
samples with PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601 were more positive for MAP
than samples without polymorphisms. Combined occurrence of PTPN2:rs478582 and
PTPN22:rs2476601 in association with the presence of MAP has significantly increased

PTPN2/22 SNPs Linked to RA
T-cell response and elevated IFN-γ expression in RA samples. The data suggest
that genetic polymorphisms may play vital role in T-cell regulation, susceptibility to
mycobacteria and ultimately response to treatment. This is the first study to report the
detection of MAP DNA in the blood of RA patients; further studies are needed using
larger number of samples.

INTRODUCTION
Most inflammatory diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis
(RA) have always been classified as autoimmune diseases
due to genetic disorders and association with environmental
triggers. Genetic predispositions include single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect the alleles of different genes
(McInnes and Schett, 2011; Yarwood et al., 2014; Smolen et al.,
2016). In RA, several SNPs have been reported in HLA class
2 histocompatibility antigen, DRB1 beta chain (HLA-DRB1),
protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22),
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), and cluster
of differentiation 40 (CD40) (McInnes and Schett, 2011; Yarwood
et al., 2014; Smolen et al., 2016). SNPs in these genes alter or
stimulate the activation and regulation of major components
of the immune system (T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, etc.) and
osteoclasts which could lead to immune-dysregulation (Brennan
and McInnes, 2008; McInnes and Schett, 2011; Smolen et al.,
2016). Consequently, this leads to accumulation of immune
cells in and around synovial joints and excessive production of
anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor autoantibodies (RF) and various
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1, and
IL-6 (Brennan and McInnes, 2008; McInnes and Schett, 2011;
Smolen et al., 2016). Specifically, SNPs in immune regulatory
genes such as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type
2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 (PTPN2/22) could potentially cause
these problems in RA. PTPN2/22 encode proteins that act as
phosphatases that negatively regulate the immune response and
some regulatory cellular functions (Gurzov et al., 2015; Sharp
et al., 2015). Both PTPN2/22 proteins are found in T-cells to
remove phosphates from LCK and ZAP-70 of the T-cell receptor
(TCR), which in turn stops activation of the TCR (Gurzov et al.,
2015; Sharp et al., 2015). PTPN2 protein is also active in epithelial
cells around the joints and intestinal tissues, which negatively
regulates chemokine production by removing phosphates from
STAT1 dimers and reduces apoptosis by removing phosphates
from BIM proteins (Gurzov et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2015). We
agree that the prevalence of SNPs in PTPN2/22 may vary and we
support the possibility that the effect on gene expression may be
significant which ultimately may void their functions as negative
regulators (Figure 1). Consequently, T-cells remain constantly
active, leading to hypersecretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and inflammation along with tissue damage (Gurzov et al., 2015;
Sharp et al., 2015).
RA is an idiopathic autoimmune disease with suspected
genetic predisposition and environmental triggers association.
Due to intense inflammation, hyperplasia of the joints occurs
along with cartilage and bone destruction, which leads to extreme
pain and deformity of the extremities (Smolen et al., 2007;
Aletaha et al., 2010; McInnes and Schett, 2011). RA symptoms
include joint swelling and pain of three or more joints, morning
stiffness lasting 30 min and subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules
(Majithia and Geraci, 2007). Anti-CCP along with RF have
also been useful to diagnose RA, more so than erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein serum levels
(Nishimura et al., 2007; Egerer et al., 2009; Pincus and Sokka,
2009; Aletaha et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2011). Although, anti-
CCP seems to be more specific, but less sensitive than RF in
RA diagnosis. Overall, ∼30% of patients with RA are negative
for anti-CCP (Nishimura et al., 2007; Egerer et al., 2009;
Pincus and Sokka, 2009). RF, on the other hand, seems to have
lower specificity but higher sensitivity compared to anti-CCP
test. Overall, ∼30–40% of patients with RA are negative for
rheumatoid factor (Nishimura et al., 2007; Egerer et al., 2009;
Pincus and Sokka, 2009). The limitation in early and accurate
diagnosis of RA affects many patients who are left with continued
pain and debilitating suffering. It is imperative that new and
improved methods of testing for RA (i.e., genetic testing or
identification of potential environmental antigens) is discovered
to not only better diagnose RA, but to also find better treatments
for the disease as well.
Treatment of inflammatory diseases such as RA and
Crohn’s disease (CD) includes non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Majithia and Geraci, 2007; Smolen
et al., 2007, 2016). NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are used
for RA patients to help reduce overall pain and stiffness
(Majithia and Geraci, 2007; Smolen et al., 2016). However,
these medications have a wide-variety of long-term side effects
such as ulceration, osteoporosis, hypertension, weight gain,
etc., thus NSAIDs and glucocorticoids need to be paired with
other medications to reduce the side effects (Majithia and
Geraci, 2007; Fakhrudin et al., 2015; Smolen et al., 2016).
DMARDs includes synthetic products such as methotrexate,
sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine and includes biologics
such as adalimumab/infliximab (anti-TNF-α), tocilizumab (anti-
IL-6 receptor), abatacept (T-cell co-stimulator), and rituximab
(B-cell deactivator) (Majithia and Geraci, 2007; Smolen et al.,
2016). Using multi-therapy or mono-therapy of different
DMARDs is controversial and is continued to be argued among
clinicians due to conflicting side effects of each medication.
Problems with both synthetic and biological DMARDs continue
to be the high risk of developing sides effects including GI
intolerance, hypersensitivity to the medication, production of
antibodies against the medication, and increasing the risk
of developing opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium

tuberculosis infection (Bartelds et al., 2007; Dixon et al., 2010;
Smolen et al., 2016). DMARDs and synthetic DMARDs are
re-classified as DMAIDs when used in inflammatory bowel
treatment such as CD (Allen et al., 2017). Infliximab is most
commonly prescribed medication for both RA and CD (Kuek
et al., 2007; Allen et al., 2017). RA and CD patients share
the same treatments, thus it is possible that both RA and
CD pathogenesis share common factors involved in disease
pathogenesis (Georgiadis et al., 2003; Kuek et al., 2007;
Zhernakova et al., 2009; Voight and Cotsapas, 2012; Allen et al.,
2017).
Environmental triggers involved in RA include cigarette
smoking, air pollutants, and bacteria including Porphyromonas
ginivalis (P. gingivalis) and Proteus mirablis (P. mirablis)
(Klareskog et al., 2011; Fisher et al., 2015; Smolen et al., 2016).
Molecular mimicry between a haemolysin protein sequence
(ESRRAL) produced by P. mirablis and a RA susceptibility
sequence (EQRRAA) was reported, thus showing possible
connections to genetic pre-disposition and an environmental
trigger synergistic threat (Ebringer and Wilson, 2000). Most
recently, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
(MAP) has been associated with other autoimmune diseases
including CD, T1D, and possibly in RA (Naser et al., 2009a,
2013; Masala et al., 2011; Sharp et al., 2015). The association
of MAP with these inflammatory diseases was based on
shared genetic predisposition and molecular mimicry with
environmental antigens (Naser et al., 2009a, 2013; Masala et al.,
2011; Sharp et al., 2015). MAP infection in a genetically
predisposition patient should trigger, exacerbate and possibly
dysregulate the immune system by stimulating the production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, through molecular mimicry,
production of autoantibodies (Naser et al., 2009a, 2013; Masala
et al., 2011; Sharp et al., 2015). This is the first study designed
to explore the effect of an environmental trigger, such as MAP,
and SNPs in PTPN2/22 on gene expression and the consequent
effect on T-cells reactivity and inflammation. We hypothesize
that SNPs in PTPN2/22 and, along with MAP infection, causes
hyper-proliferative T-cells and overexpression of IFN-γ leading
to possible inflammation in RA patients.
METHODS
Clinical Samples
Three 4.0-mL K2-EDTA coded blood tubes were obtained
from 132 consented RA and healthy control subjects that
were acquired from the University of Central Florida Health
Center. The study was approved by the University of Central
Florida Institutional Review Board #IRB00001138. Each subject
completed and signed a written consent form before samples
were collected. The average age of healthy controls was
30.7 ± 13.4 with a gender ratio of 41.9% male and 58.1%
female subjects. The average age of RA patients was 49.9 ± 13.7
with a gender ratio of 11.4% male and 88.6% female subjects.
Many factors including the higher prevalence of RA in older
females than in males (3:1 ratio) found in other studies, the
preference of a female rheumatologists by female RA patients,
and the selection of rheumatologists around the area has
been noted and considered in this study (Kvien et al., 2006;
van Vollenhoven, 2009). Table 1 lists age, gender and other
demographic information and current medications for all RA
subjects participating in this study. One tube of blood sample
was processed for detection of MAP IS900 DNA. Another tube of
blood sample was processed for PTPN2/22 genotyping and gene
expression experiments, whereas the third tube of blood sample
was utilized in T-cell proliferation study.

Detection of MAP IS900 DNA in Peripheral
Leukocytes
Blood sample tubes designated for MAP IS900 detection were
centrifuged at 3,000 RPMs for 10 min at room temperature.
A 1.0 mL sample of plasma was transferred to sterile 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube and was stored at −20◦C for further
analysis. Buffy coat layer containing peripheral leukocytes were
also transferred into new sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
containing double volume of red cell lysis buffer (ammonium
chloride solution, G-Biosciences R
�). Tubes were then incubated
by rocking on a gentle shaker for 10 min, which then were
centrifuged at 5,000 RPMs for 5 min at room temperature. The
supernatant was removed and purified buffy coat pellets were
stored in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer and subjected to genomic
DNA extraction using a modified DNAzol R
� extraction protocol
as follows. Fresh or thawed buffy coat pellets suspended in
1.0 mL DNAzol R
� reagent was mixed with 400 µL of 100%
isopropanol. Tubes were then incubated for 15 min at room
temperature followed by centrifugation at 8,000 RPMs for 6 min.
The supernatant was discarded and DNA pellets were washed
once with 500 µL DNAzol R
� reagent and centrifuged at 8,000
RPMs for 5 min. Genomic DNA pellets were washed again with
1.0 mL of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 8,000 RPMs for 5 min.
DNA pellets were then dried in a speedvac for 5 min. Dried
DNA pellets were dissolved in 20 µL molecular biological grade
sterile H2O and stored at −20◦C for analysis by nPCR. Detection
of MAP IS900 DNA was done following our nPCR protocol
and nucleotide primers as described previously (Naser et al.,
2004). The presence of a 298 bp band on a 2% agarose gel was
indicative of presence of MAP in patient sample. Positive MAP
DNA control originated from our UCF4, a culture of clinical
strain isolated from CD patient. Negative control tube for each
PCR step contained all PCR ingredients except DNA template
was used.
PTPN2/22 Genotyping
Genotyping of PTPN2/22 for 9 SNPs were performed on
DNA from peripheral blood. Genotyping was done at the
University of Florida
Pharmacotherapy and Translational
Research Department (Gainesville, FL) using the TaqManTM SNP
Genotyping Assays (Applied BiosystemsTM). We investigated
4 SNPs specific to PTPN2 including rs1893217, rs2542151,
rs7234029, and rs478582 along with 5 SNPs specific for PTPN22
including rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, and
rs2476599. Table 2 summarizes SNPs allele mutations and amino
acid mutations used in this study. Briefly, 1 mL blood was stored
at −20◦C until all samples were collected. DNA extractions were
performed on whole blood samples using QIAamp R
� DNA Blood
Mini Kit (QiagenTM) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Similarly, TaqManTM genotyping assays for PTPN2/22 were
performed on DNA samples following manufacturer protocol
(Applied BiosystemsTM). Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of
2x TaqManTM Master Mix and 20x Assay Working Stock (primers
with VIC and FAM fluorophore attachment) were transferred
into a 384-well microtiter plate. DNA samples and controls were
then added to the plate which then was subjected to RT-PCR
using Applied BiosystemsTM QuantStudioTM RT-PCR System.
The protocol consisted of 95◦C for 10 min for 1 cycle, 92◦C for
15 s and 58◦C for 1 min for 50 cycles. The plate was read for
VIC and FAM fluorophores for each sample at 551 and 517 nm,

PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ Gene Expression
A total of 1 mL of fresh whole blood was transferred into
2.0 mL RNA-ase free microcentrifuge tube and was immediately
processed for RNA extraction. RNA was isolated from peripheral
leukocytes and then used to synthesis cDNA for determining
gene expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ via RT-PCR. RNA
extraction was performed following the TRIzol R
� Reagent
(Invitrogen) manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly,1.0 mL of whole
blood was transferred into 2.0 mL RNase free microcentrifuge
tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 RPMs for 15 min. Plasma was
discarded and buffy coat layer containing peripheral leukocytes
were transferred to new RNA-ase free microcentrifuge tubes
with double volume of red cell lysis buffer (ammonium chloride
solution, G-Biosciences R
�). Tubes were incubated by rocking on
gentle shaker for 10 min which then was centrifuged at 5,000
RPMs for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatant was then
removed and peripheral leukocyte pellets were suspended in
1.0 mL of TRIzol R
�. Tubes were then incubated by rocking on a
gentle shaker for 15 min. A volume of 0.2 mL of chloroform was
then added to each tube. The mixture was then incubated at room
temperature for 3 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 11,400
RPMs for 15 min at 4◦C. The colorless, upper aqueous phase
containing RNA was transferred into new 2.0 mL RNA-ase free
microcentrifuge tubes. A volume of 0.5 mL of 100% isopropanol
was added followed by incubation at room temperature for
10 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 11,400 RPMs for 10 min
at 4◦C. RNA pellets were washed in 1 mL of 75% ethanol and then
centrifuged at 8,700 RPMs for 5 min at 4◦C. RNA pellets were air-
dried for 15–30 min and then suspended in 20 µL of RNase free
H2O and heated at 60◦C for 10 min.
cDNA synthesis was performed following the iScriptTM
Reverse Transcription (Bio-Rad R
�) manufacturer’s instruction.
Briefly, 600 ng of RNA from each sample was added to PCR
reaction tubes containing 0.2 mL PCR reaction, 4 µL of iScriptTM
Reverse Transcription (Bio-Rad R
�), and up to 20 uL RNase free
H2O. Tubes were then placed in a thermal cycler (MyGeneTM
Series Pelteir Thermal Cycler) and ran for 5 min at 25◦C, 20 min
at 46◦C, and 1 min at 95◦C. Final concentration of cDNA for each
sample was 30 ng/µL.
RT-PCR reactions in a 96-well microamp plate consisted of
1 µL of cDNA (30 ng), 10 µL of Fast SYBR Green Mastermix
(Thermofisher Scientific R
�), 1 µL of either PTPN2, PTPN22, or
IFN-γ PrimePCR SYBER Green Assay mix (Bio-Rad R
�). and
8 µL of molecular biological grade sterile H2O. Oligonucleotide
primers for 18s RNA gene (forward primer: 5′-GTA ACC CGT
TGA ACC CCA TT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CCA TCC AAT CGG
TAG TAG CG-3′) were used as a control and to obtain baseline
CT readings. RT-PCR reaction was performed using the 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems R
�). Relative
mRNA expression levels were calculated using �CT (Sample
RT-PCR CT reading–18s CT baseline) and using the equation
(2−�CT × 1,000).
Isolation of Peripheral Lymphocytes and
Proliferation Assay
Isolation of peripheral lymphocytes was performed using
LymphoprepTM reagent (Axis-Shield R
�) as described previously
(Naser et al., 2009b). A stock of 2X freezing media containing
10.0 mL of 25% human serum albumin (Gemini R
�), 10.0 mL
of sterile RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich R
�), and 5.0 mL DMSO
was made for the use of preserving lymphocytes for storage
at −80◦C. Isolated lymphocytes were transferred into 1.0 mL
cryogenic vials (Nalgene R
�) with double the amount of 2x
freezing media added to samples and stored at −80◦C for future
use. Lymphocytes were thawed and washed with cRPMI, which
contained 10% sterile heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich R
�)
and 1% sterile antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich R
�)
added to RPMI-1640 before T-cell isolation. T-cell isolation from
lymphocyte samples were done using EasySepTM Human T-cell
Isolation Kit (StemcellTM) following manufacturer’s instruction.
Briefly, isolated lymphocytes were transferred into a 2.0 mL
round-bottom microcentrifuge tubes. The Isolation Cocktail
mixture was added at 50 µL/mL to sample tubes and was
incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The RapidSpheresTM
mixture was added to the tubes at 40 µL/mL and were placed in
the EasySepTM magnet for 3 min. Isolated T-cells were poured
from the tubes in the magnet to new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge
tubes. T-cells were then counted using trypan blue solution (0.4%,

PTPN2/22 SNPs Linked to RA
T-cell proliferation assay was done using bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) labeling proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals R
�) as described previously (Naser et al., 2009b).
Phytohematoagglutunin (PHA) was used to evaluate T-cell
response. Purified Protein Derivative-like (PPD-like) from MAP
was prepared by purification of supernatant from sonicates of
protein extract obtained from clinical strain UCF4 culture pellet.
It was used to determine T-cell response and prior exposure to
MAP antigens. Briefly, 1 × 105 of isolated T-cells were transferred
in triplicates onto a 96-well culture plate and were incubated in
either RPMI only, PHA (10 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich R
�) or PPD-
like (5 µg/mL) along with respected patients’ plasma for 72 h
at 37◦C and 5% CO2. T-cells were then labeled with BrdU
and incubated for 24 h at 37◦C and 5% CO2. Cell proliferation
was measured through Roche BrdU proliferation ELISA kit
as described previously (Naser et al., 2009b). Relative T-cell
proliferation levels of samples were compared to blanks (RPMI
only) and controls (isolated T-cells in RPMI only) by examining
fold change in absorbance reading of each well at 450 nm.
Statistical Analysis
Samples were analyzed for significance using unpaired, two-
tailed t-tests; unpaired, two-tailed z-score; and odds ratio.
GraphPad Prism 7 was used for statistical analysis and creation
of graphs. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Relative
mRNA gene expression was determined by the use of �CT of the
gene of interest found in each sample and the equation 2−�CT ×
1,000 (Sullivan et al., 2013).
RESULTS
Mycobacterium avium Subspecies
Paratuberculosis-IS900 DNA Detected in
RA
Purified DNA from peripheral leukocytes of 118 subjects (70
RA and 48 healthy controls) was analyzed by nPCR using
oligonucleotide primers specific to MAP IS900. MAP DNA was
detected in blood samples from RA subject as illustrated in
Figure 2A. The 298 bp PCR product purified from representative
gels was sequenced and BLAST analysis confirmed the identity
of MAP, which has previously been used to confirm if patient
samples are considered having the MAP infection (Naser
et al., 2004, 2009a, 2013). As shown in Figure 2B, out of 70
blood samples from RA subjects, 24 (34.3%) were positive for
MAPbacteremia compared to only 4 out 48 (8.3%) healthy
controls (p-value ≤ 0.05). The odds ratio (OR) value was
determined to be 5.74 (95% CI: 1.84–17.9; p-value ≤ 0.05), where
the presence of MAP DNA is most likely to occur in RA patients.
MAP bacteria has been successfully re-cultured from at least one
RA buffy coat sample (MAP-1015, see Table 1) via BD BactecTM
MGITTM Para-TB medium (Becton, Dickinson and Company©).
The cultured sample was confirmed to be MAP positive by way of
nPCR as previously mentioned. Culturing of MAP bacteria from
other RA patient samples is still ongoing.
Frequency of SNP Alleles in PTPN2/22 in
RA
TaqManTM genotyping was done on purified DNA from 132
subjects (70 RA and 62 healthy controls). DNA from each
subject was analyzed for 4 SNPs specific to PTPN2 (rs1893217,
rs2542151, rs7234029, rs478582) and 5 SNPs specific to PTPN22
(rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, rs2476599). Data
referred to as homozygous major allele is considered normal/no
SNP, while heterozygous allele and homozygous minor allele
were considered abnormal and designated as SNP positive. As
shown in Figure 3, Out of 4 SNPs specific to PTPN2, rs478582
was significant in RA since heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC)
alleles were detected in 55/70 (78.6%) RA samples compared
to 36/60 (60.0%) healthy controls (p-value ≤ 0.05, Figure 3A).
Specifically, 22/70 (31.4%) minor (CC) alleles were detected in
RA compared to 9/60 (15.0%) healthy controls (p-value ≤ 0.05),
whereas heterozygous (TC) alleles were detected in 33/70 (47.1%)
RA compared to 28/60 (46.7%) healthy controls. Out of 5
SNPs specific to PTPN22, rs2476601 was significant in RA since
heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles were detected in 20/70
(28.6%) RA samples compared to only 4/62 (6.45%) healthy
controls (p-values ≤ 0.05, Figure 3B). Specifically, heterozygous
alleles (GA) were detected in 19/70 (27.1%) RA compared to
4/62 (6.45%) healthy controls (p-value ≤ 0.05). There was rare
minor (AA) alleles detected in all samples. The OR value for the
significance of PTPN2:rs478582 was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.05–4.93; p-
value ≤ 0.05) whereas OR value for PTPN22:rs2476601 was 5.90
(95% CI: 1.89–18.4; p-value ≤ 0.05).
For determination of haplotype combinations, we examined
the significant SNPs PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601
allele combinations to confirm the allele distribution among
samples (Figure 3C). Examination of the following haplotype

types
were
combined respectively: T-G, C-G, T-A, and C-A. T-G haplotype
(major/major) was found more significantly in healthy controls
(21/59 = 35.6%) than in RA samples (10/70 = 14.3%, p-
value ≤ 0.05). C-G haplotype (heterozygous or minor/major)
was found in 40/70 (57.1%) RA samples compared to healthy
34/59 (57.6%). T-A haplotype (major/heterozygous or minor)
was found more in RA samples (5/70 = 7.14%), compared
to healthy controls (2/59 = 3.39%), while C-A (heterozygous
or minor/heterozygous or minor) was found significantly
more in RA samples (15/70 = 21.4%) than in healthy controls
(2/59 = 2.39%, p-value ≤ 0.05). When examining the haplotypes
in more detail, CC-GA haplotype was found more significantly
(p-value ≤ 0.05) in RA patients (8/70 = 11.4%) than in healthy
controls (1/59 = 1.69%).

PTPN2/22 SNPs Linked to RA
and/or homozygous minor alleles for PTPN2:rs478582 and/or
PTPN22:rs2476601.
Effect of PTPN2:rs478582 on T-Cell Response
Unlike T-cells from RA subjects, there was an increase in
T-cell proliferation response between healthy controls with
heterozygous (TC) allele (2.1± 0.3-fold increase, N = 5) and
those without SNP (TT) (1.7 ± 0.5-fold increase, N = 5) when
induced with PHA (Figure 4A). On the contrary, there was
2.0 ± 0.4-fold increase (N = 5) in T-cells response in RA samples
with minor (CC) allele compared to a 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase
(N = 5) in RA normal (TT) T-cells. There was no difference in
T-cell response in healthy controls with (N = 3) and without
(N = 5) minor allele. The effect of heterozygous (TC) allele on
T-cell proliferation response from healthy controls treated with
MAP PPD-like (Figure 4D) resulted in a 1.9 ± 0.3-fold increase
(N = 5) compared to only 1.4 ± 0.2-fold increase (N = 5) in
normal (TT) T-cells from healthy control (p-value ≤ 0.05). T-
cells from healthy controls with minor (CC) allele responded to
MAP PPD-like with 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase (N = 3) compared
to 1.4 ± 0.2 (N = 5) in normal T-cells from healthy controls.
RA samples with heterozygous (TC) allele had a significantly
higher T-cell proliferation response fold increase to MAP PPD-
like (1.9 ± 0.2, N = 5) compared to healthy controls with normal
(TT) (1.4 ± 0.2, N = 5, p-value ≤ 0.05).
Effect of PTPN22:rs2476601 on T-Cell Response
The effect of heterozygous (GA) allele on T-cell proliferation
response from healthy controls treated with PHA (Figure 4B)
resulted in a 2.0-fold increase (N = 1) compared to only
1.7 ± 0.5-fold increase (N = 5) in normal (GG) T-cells
from healthy controls. Similarly, T-cells from RA subjects with
heterozygous (GA) allele responded with a 2.2 ± 0.1 (N = 5)
fold increase compared to a 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase (N = 5) in
normal (GG) T-cells from RA subjects (p-value ≤ 0.05). There
were no patient samples with just the minor (AA) allele to do
T-cell proliferation. The effect of heterozygous (GA) allele on
T-cell proliferation response from healthy controls treated with
MAP PPD-like (Figure 4E) resulted in a 2.2 (N = 1) fold increase
compared to only 1.4 ± 0.2 (N = 5) fold increase in normal
(GG) T-cells from healthy controls. T-cells from RA samples
with heterozygous (GA) allele responded lower (2.3 ± 0.2-fold
increase, N = 5) to MAP PPD-like than normal T-cells (3.4 ± 1.8-
fold increase, N = 5). RA samples with normal (GG) T-cells had a
significantly higher response to MAP PPD-like (3.4 ± 1.8, N = 5)
compared to healthy controls with normal (GG) (1.4 ± 0.2,
N = 5, p-value ≤ 0.05). RA samples with heterozygous (GA) allele
had a significantly higher T-cell proliferation response to MAP
PPD-like (2.3 ± 0.2, N = 5) compared to healthy controls with
normal (GG) (1.4 ± 0.2, N = 5, p-value ≤ 0.05).
Effect of Combined PTPN2:rs478582 and
PTPN22:rs2476601 on T-cell Response
Response of T-cells from RA samples with both SNPs treated
with PHA was 2.7 ± 2.2-fold increase (N = 5) compared to
a 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase (N = 5) in T-cells from RA samples
without SNP (Figure 4C). There was no difference in T-cells
response against PHA in samples from healthy controls with
(N = 1) and without combined SNPs (N = 5). T-cells from
RA samples with both SNPs responded to MAP PPD-like with
a 7.4 ± 6.7-fold increase (N = 5) compared to a 3.4 ± 1.8-fold
increase (N = 5) in normal RA samples (Figure 4F). Similarly,
T-cells from healthy controls with combined SNPs resulted in
1.7-fold increase (N = 1) when treated with MAP PPD-like
compared to only 1.4 ± 0.2-fold increase (N = 5) in T-cells from
healthy control without SNPs.
Effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and
PTPN22:rs2476601 on IFN-γ Expression
The effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on IFN-
γ expression was determined on 35 RA and 24 healthy controls
(Figure 5). The average relative mRNA expression of IFN-γ in all
samples with PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC)
allele, regardless of disease, was 0.39 ± 0.31 (N = 38) compared
to 0.28 ± 0.16 (N = 21) in normal (TT) samples. Specifically, the
average relative mRNA expression of IFN-γ in all samples with
PTPN2:rs478582 minor (CC) allele was 0.48 ± 0.39 (N = 12). In
RA samples, the average relative mRNA expression of IFN-γ in
samples with PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC)
allele was 0.33 ± 0.32 (N = 22), compared to 0.22 ± 0.16 in 13
normal (TT) RA samples (Figure 5A). Surprisingly, the effect of
the PTPN2:rs478582 minor (CC) allele on IFN-γ expression in
RA samples was more significant (0.43 ± 0.41; N = 8). However,
the average relative mRNA expression of IFN-γ in healthy
control samples with and without PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous
(TC) or minor (CC) allele was similar [0.47 ± 0.28 (N = 16),
0.39 ± 0.12 (N = 8), respectively (Figure 5A)]. As observed in
RA samples, the effect of PTPN2:rs478582 minor (CC) allele on
IFN-γ expression in healthy controls was elevated (0.58 ± 0.39;
N = 4). Correlation analyses were also performed to determine
if PTPN22:rs2476601 alters IFN-γ expression (Figure 5B). In
healthy controls, the average relative mRNA expression of IFN-γ
in samples with the heterozygous (GA) or minor allele (AA) for
PTPN22:rs2476601 was 0.67 ± 0.28 compared to 0.40 ± 0.21 in
normal (GG) samples (p-value ≤ 0.05). There was no significant
effect for PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) or minor allele
(AA) on IFN-γ expression in RA samples.

infection (Figure 6B). Out of 20 RA samples with either the
heterozygous or minor allele for PTPN22:rs2476601, 7/20 (35.0%)
had MAPbacteremia compared to none in healthy controls. OR
value of significance was 5.00 (95% CI: 0.23–106.1). Specifically,
MAP presence in RA samples with heterozygous allele was 7/19
(36.8%) compared to none in healthy controls. MAP was absent
in all samples with minor allele.
We also investigated the PTPN2/22 expression in MAP
positive samples. Overall, samples with MAPbacteremia had
an average relative PTPN2 mRNA expression of 10.0 ± 6.31
(N = 15) compared to 9.00 ± 6.16 (N = 52) in MAP-free
samples, regardless of disease. In RA samples with MAP, the
average relative mRNA expression of PTPN2 was 9.53 ± 5.42
(N = 12) compared to 7.59 ± 5.28 (N = 25) in MAP-free
samples. Only three healthy controls samples were positive for
MAP and they had average relative mRNA expression of PTPN2
11.9 ± 10.57 compared to 10.3 ± 6.71 (N = 27) in MAP-free
samples. There was no change in PTPN22 expression in samples
with or without MAP.
Effect of Combined PTPN2:rs478582,
PTPN22:rs2476601, and MAP on PTPN2/22
Expression
The correlation of PTPN2/22 expression in samples with either
PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 that had MAP presence
was examined as seen in Tables 4, 5. The overall relative mRNA
expression of PTPN2 was lower in RA compared to healthy
controls (8.22 ± 5.33 and 10.3 ± 6.95, respectively). The effect
of PTPN2:rs478582 on PTPN2 gene expression in RA with
heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) allele was 8.67 ± 5.59 (N = 24)
compared to 10.6 ± 7.47 (N = 23) in healthy controls with
similar SNPs and lower than healthy controls without SNPs
(TT) (9.49 ± 5.13; N = 8). In MAP positive RA samples
with PTPN2:rs478582, the average relative mRNA expression of
PTPN2 was 9.49 ± 6.15 compared to 6.01 ± 4.70 (N = 8) in
normal (TT) MAP-free samples. Only one healthy control sample
was positive for MAP and had heterozygous (TC) allele had an
average relative mRNA expression in PTPN2 of 24.1 compared to
8.36 ± 4.42 (N = 4) in healthy controls without MAP presence
and without the SNP.
Similarly, relative mRNA expression of PTPN22 was also
lower in RA compared to healthy controls (2.55 ± 1.74, and
3.24 ± 1.84, respectively). The average relative mRNA expression
in RA with heterozygous (GA) or minor allele (AA) was
2.79 ± 1.23 (N = 13) compared to 3.40 ± 1.19 (N = 4) in healthy
controls with similar SNP and normal (GG) healthy control
(3.24 ± 1.91, N = 27). Overall, samples with MAP presence
and the PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA)
allele had an average relative mRNA expression of 3.12 ± 0.70
(N = 5) compared to 2.85 ± 1.89 (N = 41) in normal MAP free
samples. In MAP positive RA samples with PTPN22:rs2476601,
the average relative mRNA expression of PTPN22 was 3.12 ± 0.70
(N = 5) compared to normal MAP-free (2.24 ± 1.67; N = 17).
None of healthy control samples has both MAP presence and
PTPN22:rs2476601.
Only 3 RA samples had PTPN2:rs478582, PTPN22:rs2476601
and were positive for MAP. PTPN2/22 expression and T-cell
response were not significantly different from early observation.
Effect of Combined PTPN2:rs478582,
PTPN22:rs2476601, and MAP on IFN-γ
Expression
Overall, there was no significant difference in IFN-γ mRNA
expression in 59 samples with or without MAP presence. The
average relative mRNA expression in IFN-γ was 0.35 ± 0.26 in
samples with MAP present, while samples without MAP presence
(N = 45) was 0.35 ± 0.28. Similar data was observed when gene
expression was evaluated in RA and healthy control samples.
Correlation analyses were performed to determine if MAP
presence with PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC)
allele changes gene expression of IFN-γ (Figure 7). Overall,
samples with MAP presence and PTPN2:rs478582 (N = 7) had
an average relative mRNA expression in IFN-γ of 0.43 ± 0.32,
while samples without MAP presence and the SNP (N = 14)
was 0.29 ± 0.17. In RA samples, the average relative mRNA
expression in IFN-γ
in samples with MAP presence and
PTPN2:rs478582 (N = 6) was 0.39 ± 0.33 compared to 0.21 ±0.18

while samples without MAP presence and the SNP (N = 34) was

MAP presence and PTPN22:rs2476601 together. In RA patients,
the average relative mRNA expression in IFN-γ in samples with
MAP presence and the PTPN22:rs2476601 SNP (N = 5) was
0.15 ± 0.07 compared to 0.27 ± 0.24 in RA patients without MAP

Only 3 RA samples had PTPN2:rs478582, PTPN22:rs2476601
and were positive for MAP. IFN-γ expression and T-cell response
were not significantly different from early observation.
Effect of Medication to Susceptibility to
MAPbacteremia
The effect of the medications taken by RA participants,
as shown in Table 1, were evaluated for the susceptibility
of MAP. Four different medication groups were studied
for MAP susceptibility: hydroxychloroquine (TLR repressor),
methotrexate (anti-folate), prednisone (steroid), and anti-TNF-
α medications (Humira R
�, Enbrel R
�, Simponi R
�, and Cimzia R
�).
Out of 14 RA patients on hydroxychloroquine, 6 (42.9%) were
positive for MAPbacteremia, while 12 out of 37 (32.4%) of RA
patients on methotrexate also were positive for MAPbacteremia.
For RA patients on prednisone, 4 out of 16 (25.0%) of RA patients
were positive for MAPbacteremia, while 6 out of 23 (26.1%)

DISCUSSION
Extensive efforts are ongoing to investigate pathogenesis
and effective treatment for inflammatory diseases. Current
medications are expensive and the side effects are lengthy.
For example, RA etiology remains unknown, but there are
established protocols for diagnosis of and management of
symptoms. However, the side effects of all RA medications are
serious and undesirable (Majithia and Geraci, 2007; Dixon et al.,
2010; Smolen et al., 2016). Therefore, it is imperative that the
pathogenesis of RA is deciphered in order to develop protocols
for accurate and early detection and treatment of the disease.
RA patients suffer from elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as IFN-γ and TNF-α and their impact on apoptosis and
development of chronic inflammation (Majithia and Geraci,
2007; McInnes and Schett, 2011; Smolen et al., 2016). Only
environmental factors and genetic predisposition mutations have
been linked to RA (Klareskog et al., 2011; Yarwood et al., 2014;
Fisher et al., 2015; Smolen et al., 2016). This study is focused on
investigating the effect of SNPs on key negative regulators genes
such as PTPN2/22 expression and their impact on upregulation
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis and inflammation. We
hypothesized that heterozygous and/or homozygous minor allele
mutation(s) in health-keeping genes such as PTPN2/22 in RA
lead to elevated IFN-γ, TNF-α, apoptosis, and development of
inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first study designed
to elucidate the molecular cause of inflammation in RA in
association with environmental triggers such as MAP. The latter
has been associated with similar inflammation in CD, T1D,
multiple sclerosis, and others (Naser et al., 2009a,b, 2013; Masala
et al., 2011; Sharp et al., 2015). This study is first to report the
detection of MAP DNA in more than of one third of RA patients
(Figure 2B). The data is significant, intriguing, and should be a
motive to expand future investigations to include a larger pool
of samples. As well-advertised, the incidence of M. tuberculosis
infection in RA, is among the most accepted side effect of the
treatment (Dixon et al., 2010; McInnes and Schett, 2011; Smolen
et al., 2016). Therefore, detection of MAP infection in RA patients
should be investigated further as to whether it is a complication
of the treatment or a possible culprit of the disease. Although
MAP IS900 DNA is good in detecting MAP presence in patient
samples, it does not provide information about the MAP bacteria
viability. This in turn does not show accurate status of either
active or previous infection in the patient sample. Thus, culturing
of the blood from RA patients is necessary to determine if an
active MAP infection is present in the patients.
Genetic predisposing is key for susceptibility to disease,
severity of inflammation and possible ability to respond to
treatment. Due to the large number of published SNPs in
PTPN2/22, we selected 9 SNPs in this study based on shared
occurrence in other diseases with similar approved treatment
protocol (McInnes and Schett, 2011; Yarwood et al., 2014; Sharp
et al., 2015; Smolen et al., 2016). Specifically, we focused on
SNPs in PTPN2/22, which increase susceptibility to RA and CD.
The latter is well-investigated in our laboratory in association
with MAP (Naser et al., 2004, 2009b; Sharp et al., 2015).
This study identified PTPN2:rs478582 to be significant in RA
(p-values ≤ 0.05, OR = 2.28) compared to healthy controls
(Figure 3A). Similarly, PTPN22:rs2476601 was significant in RA
(p-values ≤ 0.05, OR = 5.90) compared to healthy controls
(Figure 3B). The data specifically linked PTPN2:rs478582 minor
(CC) allele to be more significantly associated with RA (p-
values ≤ 0.05). In short, our data suggest to clinicians that minor
(CC) allele in PTPN2 increases the risk of acquiring RA by a fold
of 2.1. Moreover, PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) allele in
PTPN22 was more significant in RA (p-values ≤ 0.05), indicating
that patients with this SNP are at risk of acquiring RA by a fold of
4.3. Further examination of RA genotyping showed that patient
samples with both PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601
alleles (regardless of heterozygous or minor alleles) showed to be
more significant (p-values ≤ 0.05) compared to healthy controls,
showing a 6.5-fold increased risk of developing RA. Some of the
limitations of looking into SNPs in a diverse population, such as
from this study, is that it is difficult to determine the alterations
of allelic distribution between different population groups. Thus,
it is important that further population studies that focus on
examining PTPN2/22 SNPs from other subpopulation groups,
such as race, country of origin, and age/gender in RA patients
should be done.
The effect of SNPs on PTPN2/22 gene expression and
function have been debated heavily in the literature (Vang
et al., 2005; Serrano et al., 2013; Spalinger et al., 2013;
Sharp et al., 2015). This study demonstrated that RA samples
with either PTPN2:rs478582/PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous
or minor alleles could potentially alter the PTPN2/22 gene
or the protein activity of PTPN2/22 in T-cells, thus could
possibly void the negative regulatory function of PTPN2/22. The
effects of PTPN2:rs478582/PTPN22:rs2476601 in PTPN2/22 were
also examined further to determine the effect on T-cell and
production of IFN-γ.

PTPN2/22 SNPs Linked to RA
Since PTPN2/22 is found in all T-cell types, we decided not
to segregate the T-cell subpopulations and instead look into total
T-cell activity. However, further studies need to be done on the
effects of SNPs in PTPN2/22 in different subpopulations of T-
cells. Stimulation of T-cells from RA samples associated with
PTPN2:rs478582 and induced with PHA led marked increase
in T-cell proliferation. T-cells from RA patients associated
PTPN22:rs2476601 had even more significant increase in T-
cell proliferation (p-values ≤ 0.05). Moreover, it was shockingly
surprising to see T-cell reactivity response treatment with
MAP PPD-like. Specifically, T-cells, isolated from the blood of
RA patients associated with PTPN2:rs478582/PTPN22:rs2476601
combined SNPs, proliferated by several folds more than those
cells from health controls. Thus, T-cells from RA samples
associated with SNPs in PTPN2/22 seem to demonstrate three
characteristics: first, they are hyperactive, second they seem to
lack a negative feedback control, and third they reacted to
MAP PPD-like significantly indicating prior exposure to MAP
antigens. Hyperactive T-cells with lack of negative feedback
control may explain the marked increase in pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ in RA. The examination
of T-cells in this study has been an exploratory study, thus
it is necessary to examine bigger populations of RA and
health control subjects in the future. Along with this, further
investigation on the outcome of the other immune cells, such
as B-cells, NK cells, and macrophages, need to be examined
in RA patients with SNPs in PTPN2/22 to conclude how the
hyper-proliferative T-cells react to other immune cells.
The hyperactivity to MAP PPD-like in the RA T-cells may
be correlated to presence of MAP in RA samples and possibly
activation of M. tuberculosis in some RA patients with biologic
drugs treatments. The study provided more evidence that SNPs
in PTPN2/22 may have increased susceptibility to MAP infection
as shown in Figure 6. Specifically, PTPN2:rs478582 correlated
with MAP infection in 32.7% (OR = 7.05) RA patients. Similarly,
PTPN22:rs2476601 correlated with MAP infection in 35.0%
(OR= 5.00) RA patients (p-values ≤ 0.05). The data also
demonstrated that presence of MAP did not alter PTPN2/22
expression.
To elucidate whether medications may have any effect on
the outcome of this study, we examined the effect of current
medications taken by the RA participants on the risk of
susceptibility to MAP infection. As shown in Table 1, out of all
the DMARDs (hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, prednisone,
Humira R
�, Enbrel R
�, etc.) that the RA patients were on,
hydroxychloroquine was found to increase MAP susceptibility
the most in RA patients by a 1.3-fold change compared to RA
patients not on hydroxychloroquine and had MAPbacteremia.
These findings suggest that more investigation is needed by
testing larger number of patients with RA. We also discovered
that IFN-γ expression was lower in RA patients who are on
DMARDs treatment compared to RA patients who are on
different treatments (Table 1). Specifically, blood samples from
RA patients treated with Humira R
� expressed lower IFN-γ
(0.15 ± 0.10, N = 11) compared to blood samples from other RA
patients (0.29 ± 0.27; p-values ≤ 0.05) or even healthy controls
(0.44 ± 0.24; p-values ≤ 0.05). Moreover, RA samples associated
with PTPN2:rs478582/PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous or minor
alleles had higher IFN-γ expression than RA group without
(Figure 5). These finding demonstrates that SNPs in PTPN2/22
may led to elevated IFN-γ levels and inflammation in RA
patients. However, since we focused only on PTPN2/22 on the
control of IFN-γ expression in this study, we did not examine
the other cytokines that control IFN-γ production. Further
investigation is needed to examine the effects of both pro-
inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-6, in subjects with SNPs in PTPN2/22.
Overall, the data supports our hypothesis that SNPs in
PTPN2/22 leads to loss functions of these genes resulting
in hyper-proliferative T-cells and increase susceptibility to
Mycobacteria including MAP. Along with genetic testing for
SNPs and proper treatment, personalized treatment for RA is
plausible. More studies are encouraged to explore the incidence
and impact of these SNPs on health keeping genes and
susceptibility to infection in RA.
