ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular (CV) screening in young athletes remains
challenging and a topic of considerable debate. Recent
criticisms of ECG screening have perpetuated arguments
that ECG screening is neither indicated nor effective by
applying outdated incidence data and flawed
methodology. In response, this article provides a critical
review of the arguments in favour of ECG screening in
athletes and the early detection of CV disorders at
elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Importantly,
no study to date has demonstrated that screening by
history and physical examination alone is effective in
detecting athletes at risk or in preventing SCD. ECG
screening using current athlete-specific interpretation
standards provides a low false-positive rate and improves
detection of potentially lethal CV conditions. Further, risk
reduction in athletes identified with CV disorders can be
effectively achieved through modern strategies for risk
stratification and disease-specific management. By every
definition of the purpose of CV screening, ECG-inclusive
programmes will better meet the stated objective of early
detection when proper ECG interpretation and adequate
cardiology resources are available. Less debate on
screening protocols and more emphasis on advancing
physician skills and infrastructure in sports cardiology
is needed to more effectively screen targeted
athlete populations.
INTRODUCTION
In a recent BMJ report, Van Brabandt et al1 assessed
cardiovascular (CV) screening in athletes to prevent
sudden cardiac death (SCD) from the perspective
of a health economist. The authors make several
points with which we agree: (1) the diagnostic
yield of CV screening by history and physical
examination alone is extremely low and has little
supporting evidence; (2) national, universal screen-
ing should not be mandated, especially without
appropriate physician infrastructure; (3) CV screen-
ing will detect disorders associated with SCD but
with an unclear absolute risk of CV events and (4)
the potential benefits and harms of different CV
screening programmes are not fully understood.
However, we firmly disagree with their conclusion,
‘As long as those at high risk of sudden death
cannot reliably be identified and appropriately
managed, young athletes should not be submitted
to pre-participation screening’. W
e argue that ath-
letes with conditions at risk of SCD can be success-
fully identified and appropriately managed. Thus,
we share our perspective on why early detection
of CV disorders in athletes is justified and can
save lives.
REFRAMING THE DEBATE
Once again ECG screening is presented as a binary
‘all
or
none’
response—either
mandated
as
a
national programme and provided to athletes at all
levels or not recommended at all. These polarised
options
provide
little
assistance
to
physicians
responsible for preparticipation screening and lack
considerations that drive sound medical practice,
specifically an assessment of individualised risk and
physician skills and resources.
Few preventive services are performed in medi-
cine without accounting for individual patient risk.
Robust data from independent data sets prove that
some athlete groups have a substantially higher risk
than others.2 3 In the USA, black male college ath-
letes have an annual SCD risk of 1 in 16 000, male
basketball athletes 1 in 9000 and male black basket-
ball athletes 1 in 4400.2 These rates are not
‘extremely rare’ but alarmingly high.
PURPOSE AND ASSUMPTIONS
The premise of CV screening in athletes is that
early detection of cardiac disorders associated with
SCD can reduce morbidity and mortality through
individualised and evidence-driven disease-specific
management. Without believing in the benefit of
early detection, then screening by any strategy is
called into question. If one believes in early detec-
tion, screening by history and physical examination
alone is inadequate. The addition of ECG, while
still imperfect, will increase detection of disorders
at elevated risk of SCD and can be achieved with a
low false-positive rate and with high quality when
proper infrastructure and skilled cardiology re-
sources are available. In two independent studies of
CV screening in college athletes (total N=1664),
the ECG abnormal rate in both studies using the
Seattle criteria was only 2.8% (with false-positive
rates <2.5%), and all potentially lethal CV disor-
ders—hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3), long QT
syndrome (1) and ventricular pre-excitation (4)—
were found only because of ECG abnormalities and
would have been missed by an evaluation using
history and physical examination alone.4 5
A CALL FOR COMPARABLE SCRUTINY
Van Brabandt et al question the incidence rates in a
25-year Italian study while overlooking serious
methodological limitations in the studies cited in
opposition.6 Incidence data depend greatly on the
method used to identify cases, and we provide
three clarifications. First, the high incidence at the
beginning of the Italian study is consistent with
that of other studies using a mandatory reporting
system, specifically data from the US military,7 and
is unlikely to be ‘simple random variation’. If the

 high initial incidence was an anomaly, why did it last nearly
8 years before decreasing? Second, because the data from Israel
relied on a retrospective review of newspaper clippings for case
identification, the study is fatally flawed.8 9 This approach must
have misestimated SCD cases over the 24-year period making
any comparison of screening strategies unreliable as other
studies demonstrate that case capture methods by media reports
identify only 18–56% of SCD cases in athletes.10–12 Third, Van
Brabandt references incidence estimates from Minnesota to
suggest that the incidence rate of SCD in the USA (without
ECG screening) is no different from the incidence rate of SCD
in Italy.13 However, the low incidence reported in Minnesota
does not represent current estimates in the USA. This number is
again an underestimate and derived largely from catastrophic
insurance claims in high school athletes—a mechanism for case
identification revealed to be inadequate in a detailed ana-
lysis.14
15 W
e argue that Van Brabandt’s failure to critically
examine the methodology in each study explains their conclu-
sion—one that is therefore misleading. Applying recent inci-
dence data leads to a different conclusion when choosing an
appropriate CV screening strategy, especially in athletes deemed
high risk (figure 1).
DISEASE-ORIENTED OUTCOMES EVIDENCE
Is a randomised trial the only evidence that will support early
detection through ECG screening? Van Brabandt et al make no
reference to the mounting disease-specific data that early detec-
tion of pathological cardiac disorders followed by individualised
risk stratification and management lowers mortality for some
cardiac conditions. For example, large cohort studies using
current therapeutic measures have demonstrated improved sur-
vival and low mortality rates in children and young adults with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.16 17 For children diagnosed with
long QT syndrome, individualised management and in-depth
counselling were associated with low cardiac event rates and no
deaths in two independent cohorts of young athletes.18 19 For
asymptomatic athletes identified with ventricular pre-excitation
(W
olff-Parkinson-White pattern), expert consensus guidelines
define risk stratification and management strategies to reduce
risk.20 21 Lastly, updated eligibility recommendations from the
American College of Cardiology also affirm that early detection
of conditions at risk has the potential for individual benefit.22
MOVING FORWARD
The primary goal of CV screening in competitive athletes is to
detect cardiac disorders early in their natural history to mitigate
the risk of SCD through risk stratification, individualised
management and evidence-driven activity recommendations.
Successful ECG screening programmes require accurate ECG
interpretation using modern athlete-specific standards, as well as
skilled cardiology resources for the secondary evaluation of
ECG abnormalities.23 When CV screening programmes that
include ECG are performed with quality, approximately one in
six abnormal ECGs will represent a relevant cardiac disorder at
elevated risk of SCD.4 5 CV screening remains ethically com-
pelling in high-risk athletes until a proper study demonstrates
otherwise. W
e agree with Van Brabandt that national mandates
are not appropriate. That is not the question. W
e argue (and
present data) that to provide safe sports participation, the focus
of preventing SCD in athletes should be on the development of
a trained physician infrastructure to conduct more effective
screening for targeted athlete populations.
What are the findings?
▸ Cardiovascular screening in athletes is not effectively
accomplished using history and physical examination alone.
▸ ECG screening should not be a choice between mandated,
national programmes or not being conducted at all. The
differential risk of targeted athlete populations and an
assessment of physician skills and resources should be used
to guide screening practices.
▸ Current incidence studies provide robust evidence from
independent data sets that some athlete groups have a
substantially higher risk of SCD than that of others.
▸ Early detection of cardiac disorders associated with SCD can
reduce morbidity and mortality through individualised and
evidence-driven disease-specific management.

 How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
When cardiovascular screening in young athletes is
recommended, ECG-inclusive strategies represent best practice
when proper ECG interpretation and adequate cardiology
resources are available. A greater emphasis on physician
training and infrastructure is needed to conduct more effective
screening in high-risk athlete populations.
