Summary
Background Rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are rising globally and there is concern that increased migration 
is contributing to the burden of antibiotic resistance in Europe. However, the effect of migration on the burden of 
AMR in Europe has not yet been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis 
to identify and synthesise data for AMR carriage or infection in migrants to Europe to examine differences in patterns 
of AMR across migrant groups and in different settings. 
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus with 
no language restrictions from Jan 1, 2000, to Jan 18, 2017, for primary data from observational studies reporting 
antibacterial resistance in common bacterial pathogens among migrants to 21 European Union-15 and European 
Economic Area countries. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to report data on carriage or infection with 
laboratory-confirmed antibiotic-resistant organisms in migrant populations. We extracted data from eligible studies 
and assessed quality using piloted, standardised forms. We did not examine drug resistance in tuberculosis and 
excluded articles solely reporting on this parameter. We also excluded articles in which migrant status was determined 
by ethnicity, country of birth of participants’ parents, or was not defined, and articles in which data were not 
disaggregated by migrant status. Outcomes were carriage of or infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms. We used 
random-effects models to calculate the pooled prevalence of each outcome. The study protocol is registered with 
PROSPERO, number CRD42016043681.
Findings We identified 2274 articles, of which 23 observational studies reporting on antibiotic resistance in 2319 migrants 
were included. The pooled prevalence of any AMR carriage or AMR infection in migrants was 25·4% (95% CI 
19·1–31·8; I²=98%), including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7·8%, 4·8–10·7; I²=92%) and antibiotic-
resistant Gram-negative bacteria (27·2%, 17·6–36·8; I²=94%). The pooled prevalence of any AMR carriage or infection 
was higher in refugees and asylum seekers (33·0%, 18·3–47·6; I²=98%) than in other migrant groups (6·6%, 1·8–11·3; 
I²=92%). The pooled prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms was slightly higher in high-migrant community 
settings (33·1%, 11·1–55·1; I²=96%) than in migrants in hospitals (24·3%, 16·1–32·6; I²=98%). We did not find 
evidence of high rates of transmission of AMR from migrant to host populations.
Interpretation Migrants are exposed to conditions favouring the emergence of drug resistance during transit and in 
host countries in Europe. Increased antibiotic resistance among refugees and asylum seekers and in high-migrant 
community settings (such as refugee camps and detention facilities) highlights the need for improved living 
conditions, access to health care, and initiatives to facilitate detection of and appropriate high-quality treatment for 
antibiotic-resistant infections during transit and in host countries. Protocols for the prevention and control of 
infection and for antibiotic surveillance need to be integrated in all aspects of health care, which should be accessible 
for all migrant groups, and should target determinants of AMR before, during, and after migration.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing worldwide, 
presenting substantial challenges to the prevention and 
treatment of common bacterial infections.1,2 This 
resistance results in worse and more costly health 
outcomes3,4 and an increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality.5–7 In Europe, resistance has been reported for 
every major class of antibiotic in both community 
and health-care settings.8 Various factors might be 
contributing toward onward transmission of resistance, 
including travel, migration, and socioeconomic factors.9–13
In Europe, combined resistance to fluoroquinolones, 
third-generation cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides 
increased between 2011 and 2014 in isolates for

Gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae 
(from 16·7% to 19·6%) and Escherichia coli  (from 3·8% to 
4·8%).6 In England, bloodstream infections caused by 
E coli resistant to the most frequently used antibiotics for 
sepsis (eg, piperacillin–tazobactam) increased from 8·5% 
to 11·7% between 2011 and 2015; resistant K pneumoniae 
increased from 12·6% to 18·5% in the same period.14 
These changes will result in an increased reliance on 
carbapenems, which are considered as antibiotics of last 
resort, and there are concerns about rising rates of 
carbapenem-resistant bacteria worldwide. Although the 
prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) in tested isolates decreased slightly in Europe 
during this period (from 18·6% to 17·4%), it remains 
high in some parts of Europe and worldwide. For 
example, the prevalence of MRSA is 0·3–60% in Europe, 
12–89% in Africa, and 10–53% in eastern Mediterranean 
countries, from which many migrants to Europe 
originate.6
More than 30 million European Union (EU) residents 
are born outside the EU,15 and more than 2 million 
migrants have entered Europe since 2015 during the 
recent refugee crisis.16 Whether migrants—and refugees 
and asylum seekers in particular—have high rates of 
AMR carriage or infection, or where bacterial resistance 
could be acquired, remains unknown. Some migrant 
groups might have an increased risk of antibiotic 
resistance because of poor sanitation or overcrowded 
living conditions, barriers to accessing health services, or 
disruptions in treatment during migration and on arrival 
in host countries.17 Additionally, high prevalence rates of 
AMR in countries of origin or transit associated with 
insufficient health infrastructure, antibiotic stewardship, 
infection prevention and control, vaccine coverage, or 
surveillance—particularly in the context of conflict—
could increase the risk of bacterial resistance, as could 
return travel to their countries of origin and contact with 
health services in these settings.10,18,19 Alternatively, the risk 
of antibiotic resistance in migrant communities might be 
lower than it is in locally born populations in Europe 
because of reduced access and exposure to antibiotics or 
health-care facilities. Thus, rather than importing 
antibiotic resistance, migrants could instead be vulnerable 
to exposure to AMR pathogens in host countries.
The absence of data on AMR carriage or infection in 
migrants to Europe might be partly attributable to 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are rising in Europe, 
and there is concern that increased migration, especially among 
refugees and asylum seekers, might be contributing to the 
burden of antibiotic resistance. Following PRISMA guidelines, 
we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus, using 
terms pertaining to migration, antibiotic resistance, common 
bacterial infections, and European Union (EU)-15 and European 
Economic Area (EEA) countries, for articles published between 
Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 18, 2017. Search terms are given in the 
appendix. Articles reporting primary research on antibiotic 
resistance in key common bacteria in migrants were included 
with no language restrictions. There is insufficient evidence 
regarding patterns of AMR in migrants to Europe. As a result, 
the size of the burden of AMR is in these populations, or where 
drug-resistant organisms are acquired, remain unknown. 
Infection prevention and control responses require a robust and 
comprehensive understanding of the scientific literature, and 
therefore systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed in 
this area to develop robust evidence-based strategies to 
counter AMR. We did this systematic review and meta-analysis 
to identify and synthesise data on antibiotic resistance carriage 
or infection in migrants to countries in the EU, EEA, and 
Switzerland to examine differences in patterns of AMR across 
migrant groups and in high-migrant community settings.
Added value of this study
The relationship between AMR and migration to Europe has 
not previously been systematically examined. Given that 
migration and antibiotic resistance are increasing in Europe, 
robust evidence is needed to inform policy and practice to 
improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of AMR. 
This systematic review and meta-analysis examines data on 
antibiotic resistance among 2319 migrants to EU-15 and EEA 
countries reported in 23 articles. Our findings show that the 
pooled prevalence of any antibiotic resistance carriage or 
infection was increased in refugees and asylum seekers 
compared with other migrants, and in high-migrant 
community settings rather than in hospitals. There was also 
evidence that antibiotic-resistant organisms are being acquired 
during and following migration, with little evidence of onward 
transmission to host populations.
Implications of all the available evidence
Migrants—refugees and asylum seekers in particular—are 
exposed to conditions (eg, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and 
poor access to health services) in transit and host countries in 
Europe that favour the emergence of AMR. The evidence 
suggests that migrants acquire drug-resistant bacteria in 
high-migrant community settings, such as refugee camps, 
transit centres, or detention facilities in host countries, with 
little evidence that there is substantial onward transmission to 
local European host populations. These findings highlight that 
migrant communities are vulnerable to exposure to AMR in 
Europe and that initiatives aiming for improved prevention, 
detection, and treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in 
high-migrant community settings, supported by better social 
conditions and access to health services, are urgently needed 
for these migrant communities.

insufficient surveillance in migrants’ countries of origin 
and within migrant populations in host countries.6 For 
example, 70% of migrants arriving in Europe during the 
recent refugee crisis originated from Afghanistan, 
Eritrea, Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria.20 Surveillance data for 
priority antibiotic-resistant organisms in these countries 
are unavailable, athough incidence is high in neigh- 
bouring countries for which data are available.21 For 
example, for E coli, reported resistance to third-generation 
cephalosporins is 19–33% in Lebanon, 23–31% in Jordan, 
and 10–94% in Pakistan.6 Data on AMR carriage or 
infection are also insufficient because of variations in 
approaches to surveillance and screening across 
EU countries, which are mostly done in secondary and 
tertiary health-care settings (eg, hospitals) rather than in 
community settings, such as primary care. This approach 
further restricts the availability of data about AMR in 
migrant populations in view of the barriers they 
experience in accessing health services22 and fails to 
capture risk factors favouring the emergence of drug 
resistance in settings like refugee camps, transit centres, 
or detention facilities.23,24 Consequently, the epidemiology 
of AMR in migants, and extent to which high rates of 
migration might contribute to the burden of antibiotic 
resistance in Europe, remain unclear.11,25,26 Although 
infection prevention and control strategies rely on 
published scientific literature, to our knowledge, peer-
reviewed primary research reporting AMR in migrant 
populations has not been comprehensively examined. 
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential for 
transparently and systematically summarising available 
evidence,27,28 and are needed in this field to develop robust 
and evidence-based responses in policy and practice.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis 
was to identify and synthesise data on AMR, including 
carriage 
of 
or 
infection 
with 
antibiotic-resistant 
organisms, in migrants to countries in the EU, European 
Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland to examine 
differences in patterns of antibiotic resistance across 
migrant groups, such as refugees and asylum seekers, 
and in high-migrant community settings, such as 
refugee camps and hospitals.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we did a 
literature search to identify peer-reviewed articles 
reporting primary research from observational studies in 
EU-15 and EEA countries and Switzerland to capture 
21st Century patterns of migration and antibiotic-resistant 
organisms. The study conforms to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.29
Two reviewers (LBN and HT) searched MEDLINE, 
Embase, PubMed, and Scopus for peer-reviewed articles 
reporting primary research from observational studies 
done between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 18, 2017
. We used a 
Boolean search strategy with search terms pertaining to 
migration, antibiotic resistance, the common bacterial 
infections of interest, EU-15 and EEA countries, and the 
appropriate MeSH headings for each database. Search 
terms were identified from relevant research, systematic 
reviews, reports, experts in migrant health and AMR, and 
the 2014 WHO report on the surveillance of antimicrobial 
resistance.6,30–33 A detailed summary of all search terms is 
provided in the appendix. 
To be eligible for inclusion, articles had to report carriage 
or infection with laboratory-confirmed antibiotic-resistant 
organisms in migrants. In our analysis, AMR carriage or 
infection includes MRSA and Gram-nega 
tive bacteria, 
including 
extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase 
(ESBL)-
producing bacteria or multidrug-resistant bacteria, with 
combined resistance defined as resistance to three or 
more antimicrobial groups. Migrants were defined as 
individuals born outside the country in which the study 
was conducted, including refugees, asylum seekers, and 
other migrant groups. An individual was categorised as a 
refugee or asylum seeker where these terms were used to 
classify them in the relevant article. Refugees and asylum 
seekers were defined as individuals who have been 
granted asylum or are seeking or have previously sought 
asylum under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of 
Refugees. Other migrants were all other foreign-born 
individuals who were not categorised as refugees or 
asylum seekers. Other reasons for migration included 
family, work, or education.
This systematic review and meta-analysis focuses on 
antibiotic resistance in common bacterial pathogens6 and 
the evidence gap around its magnitude in migrant 
populations. We did not examine drug resistance in 
tuberculosis and excluded articles solely reporting on this 
factor. We also excluded articles in which migrant status 
was determined by ethnicity, country of birth of 
participants’ parents, or was not defined, and articles in 
which data were not disaggregated or reported by migrant 
status. Comments, editorials, reviews, letters, case 
reports, and duplicate studies were also excluded. No 
language restrictions were placed on the searches or 
search results. Non-English articles were included and 
translated before full-text screening.
Two reviewers (LBN and HT) manually screened the 
bibliographies of included articles to identify additional 
eligible studies. In cases where articles could not be 
accessed, authors were contacted to retrieve the full texts. 
Title and abstract screening, full text screening, data 
extraction, and quality assessment were also done 
independently by LBN and HT. Any discrepancies were 
discussed until a consensus was reached. EndNote X7 and 
Rayyan programmes were used for screening. Piloted 
forms were used for data extraction and quality 
assessment. Summary data were extracted on study 
design, 
country, 
screening 
setting, 
recruitment, 
population, sample size, sample demographics, period of 
study, and reported AMR carriage or infection. The quality

assessment form comprised relevant components of 
validated quality assessment and risk of bias frameworks 
including the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools, 
GRADE,34 the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale,35 and the Cochrane 
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group.36 
Articles were given a quality score percentage to reflect 
methodological rigour (for relevant study design) and 
clarity and transparency in reporting. We did not exclude 
articles based on quality scoring; however, sensitivity 
analyses were conducted. The quality assessment is 
available on request.
Data analysis
Articles that met the inclusion criteria and reported 
prevalence data for AMR in migrant (foreign-born) 
populations were included in the meta-analysis. Articles 
identified through the literature search that reported on 
AMR in migrants but that did not report prevalence data 
were not included in the meta-analysis. To adjust for 
heterogeneity across the studies (eg, across settings or 
migrant populations), we used random-effects models for 
the analyses. Pooled estimates of the prevalence of any 
detected AMR carriage or infection were calculated for all 
migrants across the included articles; by migrant status for 
refugees and asylum seekers and other migrant groups; 
and by setting for high-migrant community settings 
(eg, camps, transit centres, detention centres, or reception 
centres) and hospital settings. We did subanalyses for 
MRSA and drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We also 
calculated pooled estimates of the prevalence of AMR 
carriage and AMR infection in migrants across the 
included articles. We used sensitivity analyses to examine 
the effect of quality across the articles. Heterogeneity was 
explored graphically in forest plots to determine whether 
characteristics such as sex, study country, date of data 
collection, country of origin, or screening approach across 
the studies might explain sources of heterogeneity, and in 
stratified analyses in relation to migrant status, setting, 
and infection versus carriage.
Data were analysed using Stata 14. Metaprop, a Stata 
command, was used to calculate pooled estimates for 
prevalence and 95% CIs.37 In the meta-analyses, a 
continuity correction of 0·5 was added to zero cells. 
Heterogeneity was assessed through the use of the 
I² statistic.38 This systematic review and meta-analysis is 
registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016043681.

Results
4275 reports were identified in the database search. After 
removal of duplicates, 2274 articles were screened for 
eligibility, of which 376 were included in the full-text 
screening (figure 1). 23 articles39–61 reporting on antibiotic 
resistance in 2319 migrants met the inclusion criteria 
and were included in the systematic review; 15 articles 
reporting prevalence data on AMR in migrants were 
included in the main meta-analysis (table 1).
Seven studies43,48–50,57,58,60 were done in Germany, six in 
Spain,40–42,44,52,61 one in Greece,45 two in the Netherlands,47,56 
one in Austria,51 two in Sweden,46,59 two in Switzerland,53,55 
and two in Italy.39,54 Four articles were published in 
Spanish and translated before full-text screening.40–42,44 
The migrants’ countries of origin across the studies are 
shown in figure 2. Of the 2319 migrants included across 
the studies, 1795 (77%) were asylum seekers or refugees 
(defined as those who have applied for or been granted 
asylum).48–51,55–58,60 Other migrants across the studies

dividuals (eg, those migrating for economic or family 
reasons),40–42,52,54,59,61 including child migrants or adopted 
children.44,46,47 However, reason for migration was often 
not reported for individuals classified as other migrants, 
for whom only data on foreign-born status were available.
17 studies40–42,44,46,47,49,50,52–54,56–60 were done in hospitals, six 
studies39,43,45,48,51,55 were done in high-migrant com 
munity 
settings (eg, refugee camps or transit centres), and all but 
four47,49,55,59 of the included studies were completed at a 
single site (table 1). The articles identified in the 
systematic review included studies reporting cohort data 
on AMR carriage or infection in migrants (not included 
in the meta-analysis),40–42,44,52,59 or prevalence data on AMR 
carriage or infection in migrants identified through 
screenings targeted by specific population (eg, refugee or 
asylum seeker) or setting (eg, arrival at refugee centre or 
admission to hospital).
Antibiotic susceptibility testing methods for clinical 
and screening specimens across the studies and 
guidelines used to interpret antimicrobial sensitivity and 
minimum inhibitory concentrations are shown in the 
panel. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed for 
fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and 
cephalosporins. 19 studies reported on MRSA,39–44,46,47,49,50,52–60 
seven of which reported on community-associated MRSA 
or Panton-Valentine leucocidin expression, which is used 
as a surrogate for community-associated MRSA in the 
scientific literature.40–44,52,55 12 studies reported on antibiotic 
resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.39,45,48–51,55–58,60,61 Clinical 
manifestations, when reported, were predominantly skin 
and soft tissue infections or diarrhoea (table 1). Reporting 
was good for all key quality indicators and overall study 
quality was high (table 1).
Overall, the pooled prevalence of any detected AMR 
carriage or infection across all migrants was 25·4% 
(95% CI 19·1–31·8; I²=98%; figure 3), including MRSA 
(7·8%, 4·8–10·7; I²=93%) and drug-resistant Gram-
negative bacteria (27·2%, 17·6–36·8; I²=94%; table 2), 
with variation in reported rates of AMR carriage or 
infection by country of origin (figure 2). The pooled 
prevalence of AMR infection across migrants in the 
included 
studies 
was 
3·0% 
(0·0–5·9; 
I²=87%), 
and the pooled prevalence of AMR carriage was 
23·0% (16·5–29·4; I²=98%; appendix). Reporting of 
AMR infection versus carriage across the articles was a 
source of heterogeneity, for which the I² value reduced 
to 
87% 
(appendix). 
Graphical 
explorations 
of 
heterogeneity did not suggest that other characteristics 
were significant sources of heterogeneity (data not 
shown).
We did a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of 
article quality on estimated prevalence of AMR carriage 
or infection across the included articles. When we 
excluded articles with a quality score of 75% or lower 
(25·9%, 95% CI 16·6–35·2), the pooled prevalence of 
AMR did not differ substantially from when we included 
all studies (25·4%, 19·1–31·8).
The pooled prevalence of any detected AMR carriage 
or infection among refugees and asylum seekers 
(33·0%, 95% CI 18·3–47·6; I²=98%) was higher than it 
was in other migrants (6·6%, 1·8–11·3; I²=92%; 
figure 4; table 2). In subanalyses by drug-resistant 
organism, the pooled prevalence of MRSA in refugees 
and asylum seekers (8·2%, 5·0–11·3; I²=84%) was 
slightly higher than in other migrants (6·0%, 1·3–10·7; 
I²=94%). The pooled prevalence of detected drug-
resistant Gram-negative bacteria was similar in refugees 
and asylum seekers (27·2%, 17·2–37·1; I²=95%) and 
other migrants (27·3%, 6·0–6·1; table 2), although this 
was only reported in one study.
The pooled prevalence of detected AMR carriage or 
infection in high-migrant community settings (33·1%, 
95% CI 11·1–55·1; I²=96%) was slightly increased 
compared with hospital settings (24·3%, 16·1–32·6; 
I²=98%; figure 5; table 2). In subanalyses by drug-
resistant organism, pooled prevalence of drug-resistant 
Gram-negative bacteria in high-migrant community

settings (32·1%, 19·9–44·4; I²=84%) was slightly higher 
than it was in hospital settings (24·6%, 9·5–39·8; 
I²=97%; table 2). This was also true for MRSA in 
high-migrant community settings (9·8%, 0·0–20·3; 
I²=94%) compared with in hospital settings (7·4%, 
4·2–10·6; I²=93%; table 2).
Migrants were also over-represented among individuals 
with community-associated MRSA, accounting for 
62·7% (95% CI 50·2–75·3; I²=12%) of Panton-Valen 
tine 
leucocidin-positive MRSA isolates (a marker for 
community-associated MRSA40–42,44,52,62,63) reported among 
migrants and non-migrants in the included studies.40–42,44,52 
Additionally, evidence from the included studies suggests 
that antibiotic-resistant organisms were being acquired 
during the migration trajectory in transit or host 
countries. In three articles, migrants with similar 
migration trajectories were colonised with the same 
micro- 
organisms,39,45,51 and in one cross-sectional study in 
four refugee centres in Switzerland,55 MRSA clusters 
with recent transmission events and no relatedness in 
relation to regions of origin or travel routes were 
identified. Across the included articles, we did not find 
evidence of high rates of onward transmission to host 
populations.
Discussion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis shows that the 
prevalence of AMR carriage and infection is elevated in 
refugees and asylum seekers and in high-migrant 
community settings in the included studies. Furthermore, 
evidence indicates that antibiotic-resistant organisms are 
being acquired by migrants during the migration 
trajectory in transit or host countries, suggesting that 
transmission of AMR is occurring during or following 
migration, either from local populations to migrants or 
between migrants. We did not find evidence of onward 
transmission by migrants to host populations, which 
might be partly attributable to social segregation.
Migrants’ risk of exposure to antibiotic-resistant 
organisms in transit or host areas can be considered in the 
context of increased prevalence of AMR in high-migrant 
receiving countries, such as Greece (MRSA in 39·2% of 
tested clinical isolates and combined resistance for E coli 
and K pneumoniae in 10·7% of tested isolates), Italy

Prevalence among refugees and asylum seekers (A) and among other migrants (B). AMR=antimicrobial resistance. 
(MRSA 34·1%, combined resistance 18·6%), and Spain 
(MRSA 25·3%, combined resistance 5·5%); compared 
with countries with a lower migrant intake, such as 
Sweden (MRSA 0·8%, combined resistance 2·4%).64 The 
effect that acquisition of AMR has in these countries—
which might then be imported to northern European 
countries along the migration trajectory—should also be 
considered in the context of ongoing migration of 
EU migrants from southern to northern Europe and the 
implications that this situation could have for European 
countries with a low incidence of AMR.
In particular, our findings highlight the important role 
that high-migrant settings, including refugee camps, 
reception centres, transit centres, or detention centres, in 
transit and in host countries might have for the 
dissemination of drug resistance. Poor social conditions 
in these settings, such as inadequate sanitation, 
overcrowding, and restricted access to health services 
(including antibiotics or vaccinations), favour the spread 
of antibiotic-resistant infections.13,65,66 Such factors might 
be more influential determinants of AMR in migrants to 
Europe—especially refugees and asylum seekers—than 
the importation of these infections from countries of 
origin. In the case of MRSA, for example, colonisation 
with the same microorganisms has been seen in migrants 
with similar trajectories39,45,51 and clusters with recent 
transmission events.55 Migrants were also over-represented 
among 
Panton-Valentine 
leucocidin-positive 
MRSA 
cases, which are correlated with community-acquired 
infection.40–42,44,52,62,63 In view of concerns about the rising 
incidence of community-associated MRSA in Europe67,68 
and the increased virulence and severity of infection 
associated with Panton-Valentine leucocidin,55,63 these 
findings highlight the need to improve screening and 
treatment of MRSA among refugees and asylum seekers 
in high-migrant community settings.
The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative 
bacteria is also increasing in community settings. For 
example, carriage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria has 
increased worldwide, including in community populations 
in Europe.65 Although carriage of community ESBL-
producing entero 
bacteria is typically below 5% in Europe, 
elevated rates have been reported, including in Belgium 
(11·6%) and Spain (7·4%).65 Rising rates of carriage of 
antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria 
in 
healthy 
community 
populations have resulted in calls for improved antibiotic 
stewardship and prevention and control measures for 
infection in community settings. The elevated prevalence 
of AMR carriage in refugees and asylum seekers (33·0%), 
and in high-migrant community settings (33·1%), 
reinforce the need for such strategies.
The importance of high-migrant community settings 
(eg, camps, transit centres, or detention facilities) for the 
spread of infection has been highlighted in previous 
research,40,65,66 and whole-genome sequencing of drug-
resistant strains of bacteria in refugees to Europe has 
shown that such organisms are being acquired in transit 
or host countries.69 Evidence that such settings contribute 
to the emergence of AMR has resulted in a call for 
improved prevention efforts in community settings,7 
including by the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control,70,71 who have highlighted high rates of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in high-migrant settings (such 
as camps) and called for improved hygiene and targeted 
interventions to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance 
in such locations.71
Routine testing for the carriage of antibiotic resistance is 
mainly done in hospitals, with a particular emphasis on 
targeted screening of high-risk patients at hospital 
admission (eg, recent antibiotic usage, recent contact with 
high-incidence countries, or having been admitted to 
hospital where AMR is endemic),72 although measures for 
the prevention and control of infection in these settings 
across Europe have been shown to vary substantially 
between and within countries.73 In many cases, protocols 
for screening and control of infectious disease 
transmission in these settings focus on patients who have 
come from or have been admitted to hospitals in countries 
with a high prevalence of drug-resistant organisms.49,57,72 
However, migrants across the included articles had 
infrequently been admitted to hospital or had exposure to 
antibiotics, with evidence that AMR might have been 
acquired during or following migration. Furthermore, key

emerging bacteria of concern in health-care settings, such 
as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, might be 
more prevalent among travellers who have had contact 
with health care in high prevalence countries (including 
European travellers or settled migrants in Europe making 
return visits to their countries of origin) than in those 
migrating to Europe.74 This hypothesis is consistent with 
literature demonstrating the particular risk of AMR 
acquisition and subsequent carriage in travellers to high 
prevalence countries.9
Such findings raise questions about the effectiveness or 
appropriateness of the current focus on screening in 
secondary care settings, and the targeting of migrants and 
refugees in particular. This uncertainty is reflected in 
recent calls for more robust evidence to guide policies 
regarding microbiological screening. Further research is 
needed to identify where and when migrants are acquiring 
AMR and, in terms of screening, what role it should play, 
who should be targeted, and where and how frequently it 
should be done.60,73,75,76 The gap in evidence regarding the 
association between migration and AMR and effective 
infection prevention and control also aligns with a demand 
for more harmonised and evidence-based measures for 
the prevention and control of infection across Europe that 
are tailored to the local context and characteristics of at-risk 
groups.73 The increased rates of antibiotic resistance in 
high-migrant community settings shown in this systematic 
review highlight the potential benefit of screening in 
community settings rather than only in hospitals, 
especially in view of the substantial barriers that migrants 
can experience in accessing secondary health care.39,47,57
In addition to improved detection of AMR, for example 
through screening for colonisation, and improved 
antibiotic susceptibility testing of infections in high-
migrant community settings, interventions should focus 
on better sanitation (for staff in migrant centres and the 
migrant population), increased quality of living conditions 
and less overcrowding, and better access to health services. 
These improvements will enable timely detection and 
treatment of infections when they do occur, thus reducing 
transmission and poorer and more costly health outcomes. 
Such initiatives could also be accompanied by health 
education and advocacy for migrants and relevant staff to 
increase awareness and improve standards of practice.
The findings provide compelling evidence for basic 
infection prevention and control, antibiotic surveillance 
principles in all aspects of health care,73 and targeted 
initiatives to improve detection and treatment of drug-
resistant organisms in migrants in community settings. 
These changes should be accompanied by increased 
provider awareness and comprehensive risk assessments 
when engaging with migrant patients in relation to 
contact with health services, antibiotic use, or pre-
migration risk factors, travel and immigration history, 
and exposure to poor social conditions.75,77 Such strategies 
also need to be supported by improved access to health 
services and social conditions in these communities to 
reduce the risk of infection and transmission. This 
approach aligns with global frameworks, including the 
WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance 
System,78 the WHO draft framework of priorities and 
guiding principles to promote the health of refugees and 
migrants,79 and calls for explicit migrant health policies 
to address inequalities.80
In addition to improvements in the prevention, 
detection, and treatment of AMR in migrants, it is also 
important to reduce the stigma associated with these 
communities in view of the findings that migrants might 
acquire antibiotic-resistant organisms in host countries, 
and that the risk of onward transmission to host 
populations is low. This view is consistent with literature 
highlighting the continued vulnerability of migrants to 
infection in host countries, which is also seen for other 
infectious diseases like tuberculosis,81–84 as opposed to the 
potential threat they present for transmission to host 
populations.85
Although our systematic review and meta-analysis 
addresses a key gap in the evidence base by identifying 
and synthesising data about patterns of antibiotic 
resistance in migrants to Europe, we acknowledge that 
the evidence has some key limitations. It is unclear how 
representative the migrants included in the studies are of 
the wider migrant population across Europe. Refugees 
and asylum seekers are over-represented and more data

are needed from diverse migrant groups, including 
family reunion migrants, economic migrants, seasonal 
migrants, undocumented migrants, or settled migrants 
visiting their countries of origin. This over-representation 
might also have resulted in inflated prevalence estimates. 
A further limitation is that, in some studies, details about 
the reason for migration (eg, refugee or asylum seeker 
status) were not collected or reported, and thus could not 
be disaggregated in subanalyses. Data were heterogeneous, 
which contributed to variations in findings. Study 
outcomes, in particular, varied widely because of 
differences in definitions used, organisms and types of 
drug resistance reported, and measures (eg, carriage vs 
infection, sample prevalence or incidence, or proportion 
of drug-resistant isolates). Small sample sizes also 
contributed to wide confidence intervals in some 
subanalyses. To achieve a robust evidence base on AMR in 
migrant populations worldwide, efforts should be made to 
strengthen global surveillance systems, consistency in 
reporting, and data collection on migrant patients.
This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights 
the risk of AMR carriage and infection faced by migrants, 
particularly refugees, asylum seekers, and those residing 
in high-migrant community settings. The elevated 
prevalence of AMR in these groups could be attributed to 
the conditions they are exposed to in transit and host 
countries in Europe, which encourage the emergence 
and spread of drug resistance. The findings highlight a 
need for targeted strategies to improve the detection, 
treatment, and prevention of antibiotic resistance in 
high-migrant community settings, with little evidence to 
suggest that migrants significantly contribute to the 
burden of antibacterial resistance in Europe. Such 
strategies could include the development of Europe-wide 
screening guidelines, antimicrobial stewardship pro-
grammes in high-migrant community settings, and 
innovative 
approaches, 
such 
as 
technology-based 
surveillance or patient-held electronic records.68,86 These 
approaches should be accompanied by integration of 
robust infection prevention and control as core practices 
throughout health services to prevent transmission of 
infection and development of antibiotic resistance. Such 
approaches are prioritised in the WHO global action plan 
on antimicrobial resistance2 and are particularly salient 
because of the barriers to accessing health care faced by 
migrants,87,88 which are exacerbated by increasingly 
restrictive health services across Europe.22,89 Our findings 
highlight that these initiatives need to be supported by 
strategies to minimise social deprivation, improve living 
conditions in high-migrant settings (such as refugee 
camps, transit centres, and detention facilities) in host 
countries in Europe, and improve—rather than restrict—
access to high-quality health services for migrant 
communities regardless of legal resident status.90
