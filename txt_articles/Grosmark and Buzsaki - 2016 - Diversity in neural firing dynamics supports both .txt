 MEMORY FORMATION
Diversity in neural firing dynamics
supports both rigid and learned
hippocampal sequences
Andres D. Grosmark1,2 and György Buzsáki2,3*
Cell assembly sequences during learning are “replayed” during hippocampal ripples and
contribute to the consolidation of episodic memories. However, neuronal sequences
may also reflect preexisting dynamics. We report that sequences of place-cell firing in a
novel environment are formed from a combination of the contributions of a rigid,
predominantly fast-firing subset of pyramidal neurons with low spatial specificity and
limited change across sleep-experience-sleep and a slow-firing plastic subset. Slow-firing
cells, rather than fast-firing cells, gained high place specificity during exploration, elevated
their association with ripples, and showed increased bursting and temporal coactivation
during postexperience sleep. Thus, slow- and fast-firing neurons, although forming a
continuous distribution, have different coding and plastic properties.
T
he restructuring of hippocampal networks
through synaptic plasticity is necessary for
the formation of new episodic memories.
Replay of hippocampal place-cell (1) se-
quences during sharp wave ripples (SPW-
Rs) of waking immobility (2–5) and non–rapid eye
movement sleep (6–13) after learning has been
proposedtosupportmemory consolidation(10–13).
Replay is conceptualized and typically studied as
a phenomenon with higher-order interactions
within populations of neurons taken to have sim-
ilar properties (10, 14). However, networks built
from similar neurons are unstable (15), and recent
findings demonstrate that biophysical properties
of cortical pyramidal neurons are highly diverse
and characterized by lognormal distributions of
synaptic weights, long-term firing rates, and spike
bursts (16). Furthermore, temporal correlations of
hippocampal neurons are largely preserved across
brain states and environmental situations, sug-
gesting that learning-induced changes are con-
strained within a dynamically stable network
(16, 17). An example of a preexisting bias between
place-cell sequences in a novel environment and
sleep before the novel experience (preplay) has
been described (18–20), although its computation-
al relevance has been questioned recently (14). To
clarify the relationship between preexisting bio-
physical properties of neurons and their contri-
bution to learning, characterization of individual
neurons is necessary. We performed such analy-
ses during sleep in rats before and after they ex-
plored a novel environment.
Simultaneous recordings of well-isolated CA1
pyramidal single units were performed in four
rats. Several methods were used to assess the
relationship between firing patterns during explo-
ration of one of two linear or a circular track
(MAZE) in rooms B, C and D, respectively, and
candidate SPW-R sequences during preexperience
sleep (PRE) and postexperience sleep (POST) in
the home cage in room A (fig. S1) (21). First, a
spatial Bayesian decoder (2), constructed from
the firing-rate vectors of place cells (n = 491 cells)
during track running (eight novel exploration ses-
sions), was applied to all candidate ripple events
(21) (figs. S2 to S4) of PRE, MAZE, and POST im-
mobility epochs to estimate the posterior proba-
bilities of position in forward (2, 5, 9) or reverse
virtual traversals of the track (3, 4) (Fig. 1, A and B).
Thesevirtualtraversalsweremeasuredasweighted
correlations over the Bayesian derived posteriors
for place across all 20-ms bins in each ripple event
(21) and normalized as Z scores [rZ (sequence
score) (21)] (figs. S5 to S8).
To determine each place cell’s contribution to
PRE and POST sequences [per cell contribution
(PCC)], a PCC score was defined as the neuron’s
mean contribution across all PRE and POST pu-
tative events as determined by a cell-specific
shuffling technique (21). Neurons that showed
significant PCC scores in either PRE or POST
were considered to be strongly contributing to se-
quence formation (n = 216 neurons (Fig. 2B) (21).
Importantly, the majority of neurons strongly con-
tributing to PRE (73%) also contributed to POST
sequences (Fig. 2C and fig. S19), suggesting that
these neurons represent rigid network elements.
Strongly contributing neurons < 50 percentile of
that session’s PRE to POST sleep PCC change
(DPCC) were classified as rigid cells (blue x’s in
Fig. 2B), whereas those > 50 percentile as plastic
cells (red x’s in Fig. 2A and figs. S9 to 11). Rigid
and plastic neurons were similarly distributed
along the track (fig. S2). The contribution of in-
dividual neurons to the overall population DPOST-
PRE score (POST rZ – PRE rZ) was assessed by
either shuffling or excluding neurons with increas-
ing or decreasing DPCC scores from the analysis
(Fig. 2C and fig. S12) (21). Replay (POST > PRE)
was eliminated after shuffling or removal of the
top 10 to 20% of cells with the highest DPCC scores,
whereas it remained after shuffling or removal of
the bottom 75% (Figs. 2, C and D, and fig. S12).
These results suggest that from the PRE to the
POST sleep, plastic neurons are added to a pre-
existing backbone structure, leading to an increase
in maze-related sequential activity (replay) asso-
ciated with learning (Fig. 2C)
Although both rigid and plastic neurons con-
tributed to replay sequences, the nature of their
representation was different. Plastic neurons had
higher place-specific indices and fewer place fields
compared with rigid cells (Fig. 3A), and plastic but
not rigid neurons increased their spatial specific-
ity steadily during learning (Fig. 3B and fig. S13).
Neither overall firing-rate changes (figs. S14 and
S15) nor potential errors in neuronal clustering or
neuron classification (figs. S2 and S11) could ac-
count for the above differences. These findings
suggest that precision in spatial coding is a prop-
erty developed during maze running by a small
plastic subset of cells.
Next, we asked whether rigid and plastic neu-
rons have different biophysical and network prop-
erties. Session-wide firing rates of rigid neurons
were significantly higher compared with plastic
neurons (Fig. 4, A and B, and figs. S14 and S15).
Ripple-related spiking, bursting, and pair-wise
coactivation were higher in plastic versus rigid
neurons (Fig. 4A and figs. S14 to S16). In PRE
sleep, coactivity was dominated by fast-firing neu-
rons, and these correlations remained unchanged
into POST sleep. In contrast, slow-firing neurons
showed the strongest increases in coactivation
from PRE to POST sleep (Fig. 4B). Pair-wise co-
activity and temporal bias patterns were stable
from PRE to POST for pairs of rigid cells, whereas
plastic cell pair interactions were modified by ex-
perience on the novel maze (10) (figs. S16 and S17).
Because the above analyses indicated that over-
all firing rates and ripple-related activity of neu-
rons predicted their coding and plastic features, in
our final analysis we divided place cells into equal
subgroups by either “off-line” sleep-firing rate or
ripple-rate gain and repeated the Bayesian place
decoding analysis for each group. Low-rate neu-
rons (median, 0.39 Hz) contributed more spatial
information per spike on the maze and displayed
increased within-ripple firing-rate gains from PRE
toPOST sleep than high-rate cells (median, 1.12 Hz)
(fig. S16). Slow-firing, but not fast-firing, neurons
increased theircontributiontoneuronal sequences
from PRE to POST sleep (Fig. 4D). Conversely, PRE
to POST increases in sequence content were lim-
ited to cells that showed a high degree of ripple-
specific recruitment (gain) (Fig. 4E and figs. S20
to S22), suggesting that ripples are privileged
windowsforlearning-relatedchangesinexcitability.
SimilarresultswereobtainedusingseveralBayesian
and non-Bayesian replay methods (figs. S19 to S22).
Using several established and newly developed
methods, we demonstrate that sequences of place
cells in a novel environment are formed from a
combination of relatively fast-firing group of py-
ramidal neurons with relatively unchanging tem-
poral dynamics and a slow-firing plastic subset of

 neurons (22). Firing properties of neurons pre-
dicted their rigid (18, 19) and plastic (10) features.
Slow-firing neurons gained high place specificity
during maze exploration (23, 24) and showed in-
creased ripple-related recruitment during POST-
experience sleep. In contrast, fast-firing neurons
had low selectivity (16, 25), have been shown pre-
viously to project to multiple targets (26) and to
form an interactive subnetwork responsible for
global stability, thus allowing plasticity to take
place in the remaining majority of slow-firing cells
(16, 17). Fast-firing neurons may generalize across
situations, whereasslow-firingneurons maydiffer-
entiate among them (27). Because replay sequence-
forming neurons are drawn from the wide span of
a continuous log-rate distribution (16) with vary-
ing coding, biophysical, circuit, andplasticity prop-
erties, these events can forward a synthesis of
preexisting and new information to downstream
observer neurons.

neurons in the mouse neocortex

During corticogenesis, excitatory neurons are born from progenitors located in the
ventricular zone (VZ), from where they migrate to assemble into circuits. How neuronal
identity is dynamically specified upon progenitor division is unknown. Here, we study
this process using a high-temporal-resolution technology allowing fluorescent tagging
of isochronic cohorts of newborn VZ cells. By combining this in vivo approach with
single-cell transcriptomics in mice, we identify and functionally characterize neuron-
specific primordial transcriptional programs as they dynamically unfold. Our results
reveal early transcriptional waves that instruct the sequence and pace of neuronal
differentiation events, guiding newborn neurons toward their final fate, and contribute
to a road map for the reverse engineering of specific classes of cortical neurons from
undifferentiated cells.
D
uring neocortical development, distinct clas-
ses of neurons assemble to form local and
long-range circuits. Although class-specific
genes and features identify cortical neuron
types relatively late in differentiation (1–5),
early postmitotic fate specification programs
have been inaccessible. Here, we describe the
dynamic transcriptional activity controlling layer
4 (L4) excitatory neuron birth and differentia-
tion in the mouse neocortex.
Mammalian cortical progenitor cells in the
ventricular zone (VZ) undergo DNA synthesis [S-
phase, susceptible to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
labeling] at the basal border of the VZ and mito-
sis (M-phase, lasting about an hour at midcorti-
cogenesis in mice) when their soma is apically
located, adjacent to the ventricular space (6, 7).
At this location, mitotic cells are susceptible to
labeling by intraventricular injection of carboxy-
fluorescein esters [“FlashTag” (FT)], which bind
to and fluorescently label intracellular proteins
(8). The short extracellular half-life of FT in
the mouse ventricular space ensures effective
pulse-labeling of juxtaventricular dividing cells
(Fig. 1A and fig. S1). Intracellularly, FT is lin-
early diluted at each mitosis, such that fluores-
cence reflects the number of cell divisions that
have occurred since the time of labeling (fig. S1,
D and E, and movie S1) (8). FT+ newborn cells
synchronously moved away from the ventricular
wall within 3 hours of labeling (Fig. 1A, bottom),
reached the subventricular zone (SVZ) within
12 hours, and entered the cortical plate (CP) 24
to 48 hours after mitosis (Fig. 1B). Isochronic
cohorts of VZ cells born at the time of injection
can thus be specifically identified and tracked
during their initial differentiation.
The laminar fate of FT+ neurons was linked to
the day of FT injection at all ages examined [em-
bryonic day (E) 11.5 to 17.5] (fig. S2 and Fig. 1C).
At postnatal day (P) 7, when neuronal migration
is complete, E14.5-labeled FT+ neurons were re-
stricted to a sublamina of L4 (Fig. 1C). These
neurons were born at the time of the FT pulse,
not later, because they mostly remained un-
labeled after continuous BrdU administration be-
ginning at the time of the FT pulse (fig. S1, B to
D). Injection of FT at E14 and E14.5 using two
dye colors in the same embryo showed two dis-
tinct populations of labeled neurons within L4
at P7, revealing a tight relationship between time
of birth and final radial location, even within a
single layer (Fig. 1D). Thus, we used E14.5 FT in-
jections to label L4 neurons in vivo from the
time of mitosis in the VZ and track their early
molecular differentiation.
We observed that newborn cells sequential-
ly expressed PAX6, a VZ marker, TBR2 a SVZ
marker, and the early neuronal protein TBR1
(9, 10) within the first 48 hours after mitosis
(fig. S3). This reveals a highly dynamic cellular
process characterized by overlapping signa-
ture shifts in protein expression. For an unbiased
account of the transcriptional programs active
just after cell birth in single cells, we isolated
E14.5-born FT+ cells 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours
after mitosis by using cortical microdissection
followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
