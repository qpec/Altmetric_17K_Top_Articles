IMPORTANCE Some cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors lower low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels without reducing cardiovascular events, suggesting that
the clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C may depend on how LDL-C is lowered.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between changes in levels of LDL-C (and other
lipoproteins) and the risk of cardiovascular events related to variants in the CETP gene, both
alone and in combination with variants in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase
(HMGCR) gene.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Mendelian randomization analyses evaluating the
association between CETP and HMGCR scores, changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels, and the
risk of cardiovascular events involving 102 837 participants from 14 cohort or case-control
studies conducted in North America or the United Kingdom between 1948 and 2012. The
associations with cardiovascular events were externally validated in 189 539 participants
from 48 studies conducted between 2011 and 2015.
EXPOSURES Differences in mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and
apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels in participants with CETP scores at or above vs below the median.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratio (OR) for major cardiovascular events.
RESULTS The primary analysis included 102 837 participants (mean age, 59.9 years; 58%
women) who experienced 13 821 major cardiovascular events. The validation analyses
included 189 539 participants (mean age, 58.5 years; 39% women) with 62 240 cases of
coronary heart disease (CHD). Considered alone, the CETP score was associated with higher
levels of HDL-C, lower LDL-C, concordantly lower apoB, and a corresponding lower risk of
major vascular events (OR, 0.946 [95% CI, 0.921-0.972]) that was similar in magnitude to the
association between the HMGCR score and risk of major cardiovascular events per unit
change in levels of LDL-C (and apoB). When combined with the HMGCR score, the CETP score
was associated with the same reduction in LDL-C levels but an attenuated reduction in apoB
levels and a corresponding attenuated nonsignificant risk of major cardiovascular events
(OR, 0.985 [95% CI, 0.955-1.015]). In external validation analyses, a genetic score consisting
of variants with naturally occurring discordance between levels of LDL-C and apoB was
associated with a similar risk of CHD per unit change in apoB level (OR, 0.782 [95% CI,
0.720-0.845] vs 0.793 [95% CI, 0.774-0.812]; P = .79 for difference), but a significantly
attenuated risk of CHD per unit change in LDL-C level (OR, 0.916 [95% CI, 0.890-0.943] vs
0.831 [95% CI, 0.816-0.847]; P < .001) compared with a genetic score associated with
concordant changes in levels of LDL-C and apoB.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Combined exposure to variants in the genes that encode the
targets of CETP inhibitors and statins was associated with discordant reductions in LDL-C and
apoB levels and a corresponding risk of cardiovascular events that was proportional to the
attenuated reduction in apoB but significantly less than expected per unit change in LDL-C.
The clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C levels may therefore depend on the corresponding
reduction in apoB-containing lipoprotein particles.

endelianrandomizationstudiesandrandomizedtrials
of various lipid-lowering therapies have consis-
tently demonstrated that lower levels of low-density
lipoproteincholesterol(LDL-C)maybecausallyassociatedwith
a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.1-4 Together, these stud-
ies suggest that lowering LDL-C levels should reduce the risk
of cardiovascular events proportional to the absolute reduc-
tion in LDL-C, largely independent of the mechanism by which
LDL-C is lowered.5
The notable exception to this observation is the class of
drugs known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)
inhibitors.4 Although CETP inhibitors were originally de-
signed to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-C),6 the more potent CETP inhibitors also robustly
lower levels of LDL-C.7-11 However, in the ACCELERATE trial,
treatment with the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib reduced LDL-C
levels by 29 mg/dL (0.75 mmol/L) but did not reduce the risk
of cardiovascular events.11 This result has created uncer-
tainty about the causal effect of LDL-C on the risk of cardio-
vascular disease and raises the possibility that the clinical ben-
efit of lowering LDL-C may depend on how LDL-C is lowered.
Inthisstudy,amendelianrandomizationanalysiswascon-
ductedtoevaluatetheassociationbetweenlowerlevelsofLDL-C
(and other measures of lipoprotein concentration) and the risk
of cardiovascular events due to variants in the gene that en-
codes the target of CETP inhibitors and compare it to the asso-
ciation between lower LDL-C levels and the risk of cardiovas-
culareventsduetovariantsinthegenesthatencodethetargets
of statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors to make inferences about
whether the clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C might depend
on how LDL-C is lowered. Because the cardiovascular out-
come trials have evaluated the effect of treatment with a CETP
inhibitor on the background of statin therapy, the associations
of the CETP variants were evaluated both alone and in combi-
nation with variants of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
reductase (HMGCR) gene, which encodes the target of statins.
Methods
Study Design
The study consisted of 3 sequential parts as summarized in
Figure 1. First, a mendelian randomization study was con-
ducted to measure the association between lipid changes due
to a genetic score consisting of variants in the CETP gene and
the risk of cardiovascular events. The magnitude of the asso-
ciation between the CETP genetic score and the risk of cardio-
vascular events was then compared with magnitude of the as-
sociationbetweentheriskofcardiovasculareventsandgenetic
scores consisting of variants in the HMGCR gene (NCBI Entrez
Gene 3156, which encodes for the target of statins), the
Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 intracellular cholesterol transporter
1(NPC1L1) gene (NCBI Entrez Gene 29881, which encodes for
thetargetofezetimibe),andthePCSK9gene(NCBIEntrezGene
255738, which encodes for the target of PCSK9 inhibitors), re-
spectively. The objective of this analysis was to make infer-
ences about whether lower LDL-C levels due to CETP inhibi-
tion has the same causal effect on the risk of cardiovascular
events as other methods of lowering LDL-C levels.12
Second, a 2 × 2 factorial mendelian randomization study
was conducted to measure the association between lipid
changes due to combined exposure to the CETP and HMGCR
genetic scores and the risk of cardiovascular events. The mag-
nitude of these associations were then compared with the
magnitude of the associations with the CETP score alone.
The objective of this analysis was to make inferences about
whether the effect of CETP inhibition on lipid changes and the
risk of cardiovascular events is modified by inhibition of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.
Third, a mendelian randomization study was conducted
to measure the association between the risk of coronary heart
disease and a score consisting of genetic variants associated
with discordant changes in levels of LDL-C and apolipopro-
tein B (apoB). The magnitude of the association between this
discordant variant genetic score and the risk of cardiovascu-
lar events was then compared with the magnitude of the as-
sociation between a genetic score consisting of variants asso-
ciated with concordant changes in levels of LDL-C and apoB
and the risk of cardiovascular events, measured both per unit
change in LDL-C and per unit change in apoB, respectively. The
objectiveofthisanalysiswastomakeinferencesaboutwhether
the causal effect of LDL on the risk of cardiovascular events is
determined by the cholesterol mass carried by LDL particles
(as measured by LDL-C level) or by the concentration of cir-
culating LDL particles (as estimated by apoB level) and there-
fore to make further inferences about whether the clinical ben-
efit of lowering LDL-C level may depend on how it is lowered.
Study Population
Theprimaryanalysesincludedindividual-participantdatafrom
all studies in the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion database of Genotypes and Phenotypes program that re-
ported data on cardiovascular outcomes.13 These 14 cohort or
case-control studies included a total of 112 772 participants. Of
these, 102 837 participants had adequate genetic information
for all variants included in the various genetic scores investi-
gated in this study and were included in the analysis without
Key Points
Question Does the clinical benefit of lowering low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels depend on how LDL-C
is lowered?
Findings In a mendelian randomization analysis of an
individual-participant data meta-analysis that included 102 837
participants, combined exposure to variants related to the action
of CETP inhibitors and statins was significantly associated with
discordant reductions in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels;
the corresponding association with cardiovascular events was
proportional to the attenuated reduction in apolipoprotein B
but less than expected per unit change in LDL-C.
Meaning The clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C may be related
to the corresponding absolute reduction in apolipoprotein
B-containing lipoprotein particles and therefore may depend
on how LDL-C is lowered.

hort or case-control study, race/ethnicity was self-identified

tion of the included studies and the genotyping platforms used
in each study is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.

mary-level data from a total of up to 189 539 participants from

Contributing studies received ethical approval from their re-
spectiveinstitutionalreviewboards,andwritteninformedcon-
sent was obtained from all participants. Analysis of the indi-
vidual-participant data was approved by the Wayne State
University institutional review board.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome for the individual participant data analy-
ses was major cardiovascular events, defined as a composite
of the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, coronary re-
vascularization, stroke, or coronary death. The primary out-
come for analyses using summary-level data was coronary
heart disease (CHD), as defined by the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D
Consortium.14,15
Genetic Instruments
The CETP genetic score was constructed by combining all vari-
ants within 100kb on either side of the CETP gene that were
conditionally associated with HDL-C levels (the major lipid ef-
fect of CETP inhibition) at a genome-wide level of signifi-
cance (P < 5 × 10−8) and that were in low linkage disequilib-
rium(r2<0.4)withallothervariantsincludedinthescore,using
a forward stepwise conditional regression procedure among
participantsfreefromcardiovasculardiseaseatbaselineineach
study (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The exposure allele for
each variant was defined as the allele associated with higher
HDL-C levels.16
For each participant with individual data, a weighted CETP
genetic score was calculated by summing the number of
HDL-C–raising alleles that each participant inherited at each
variant included in the score, weighted by each variant’
s con-
ditional effect on HDL-C levels measured in mg/dL. For analy-
ses involving summary-level data, genetic scores were calcu-
lated using the usual ratio of effect estimates method. Genetic
scores for HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 were constructed using
a similar procedure, as previously described.17,18
Allocation of Exposures
In individual-participant analyses, the CETP genetic score was
dichotomized and used as an instrument to allocate partici-
pants into 2 approximately equal-sized groups based on
whether their CETP score was either equal to or above the me-
dian or below the median (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). To
evaluatedoseresponse,participantsweredividedinto4groups
based on the quartile value of their CETP score.
To conduct the 2 × 2 factorial mendelian randomization
analysis, participants were first allocated into 2 groups based
on whether their HMGCR genetic score was equal to or above
the median or below the median; participants in either of these
2 groups were then allocated into 2 further groups based on
whethertheirCETPgeneticscorewasequaltoorabovetheme-
dian or below the median (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).17,18
To conduct the stratified analysis, participants were first di-
vided into 2 groups based on whether their HMGCR score was
equal to or above the median or below the median, and the as-
sociations of the CETP score with cardiovascular events was
then evaluated as a continuous variable (without dichotomi-
zation to increase statistical power to detect effect modifica-
tion) in each of these 2 groups separately.

 Statistical Analysis
For analyses involving individual-participant data, the abso-
lute difference in mean levels of various biomarkers between
groups was measured using linear regression, and the associa-
tion with the risk of cardiovascular events was measured using
logistic regression. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and
thefirst5principalcomponentsofancestry.Analyseswereper-
formed separately in each included study. Mendelian random-
ization estimates were then obtained by combining these sum-
marized associations using a previously reported method that
accounts for correlation between variants.19

Results
The weighted mean age of the 102 837 study participants was
59.9 years. The weighted mean level of high-density lipopro-
teincholesterol(HDL-C)was52.0mg/dL;ofLDL-C,129.7mg/dL
(to convert lipid values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259); and
of apoB, 101.4 mg/dL (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Study par-
ticipants experienced a total of 13 821 first major cardiovascu-
lar events. The stepwise selection procedure identified 8 ge-
netic variants conditionally associated with HDL-C level that
were included in the CETP genetic score; 6 variants were in-
cluded in the HMGCR genetic score as previously reported
(eTables 4-7 in the Supplement).17,18 There were no differ-
ences in any nonlipid baseline characteristics between the
groups being compared, thus demonstrating that allocation to
each group appeared to be random (Table 1). The distribution
of genetic scores for each group being compared in all analy-
ses is presented in eTable 8 in the Supplement.

 Overall, as compared with participants with CETP scores
below the median, participants with CETP scores equal to or
above the median had lower mean CETP activity resulting in
4.62 mg/dL higher mean HDL-C level, 2.15 mg/dL lower mean
LDL-C, 1.39 mg/dL lower mean apoB, and a corresponding
lower risk of major cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR],
0.964[95%CI,0.955-0.983];P < .001).Indoseresponseanaly-
ses,increasingquartilesoftheCETPscorewereassociatedwith
a step-wise increase in mean HDL-C, step-wise decreases in
mean LDL-C and apoB, and a corresponding step-wise de-
crease in the risk of major cardiovascular events (Figure 2A).
Instandardizedanalyses,theCETPscorewasassociatedwith
a very similar risk of major cardiovascular events per 10-mg/dL
lower LDL-C level (and per 10-mg/dL lower apoB) as compared
with the HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 genetic scores (Figure 2B
and C).
Inexternalreplicationanalysesinvolvingupto62 240par-
ticipants with CHD and 127 299 control participants from the
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, the CETP score was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of CHD (OR, 0.968 [95% CI, 0.956-

tude compared with the association between the HMGCR,
NPC1L1, and PCSK9 genetic scores and the risk of CHD per unit
change in LDL-C level (and per unit change in apoB) (eFigure
3 in the Supplement).
In the 2 × 2 factorial analysis, compared with participants
with both CETP and HMGCR scores below the median, partici-
pants in the group with both CETP and HMGCR scores equal to

All information derived from the individual-participant data. A total of 102 837
participants who experienced a total of 13 821 first major cardiovascular events
were included in the analysis. Among all participants, median cholesteryl ester
transfer protein (CETP) genetic score was 34.8 (interquartile range [IQR],
28.3-41.1; range, 0-54.3). For participants in the group with CETP scores below
the median, median CETP score was 28.2 (IQR, 23.3-32.0; range, 0-34.7).
For participants in the group with CETP scores equal to or above the median,
median CETP score was 41.1 (IQR, 37.9-44.8; range, 34.8-54.3). Higher scores
indicate a greater number of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C)–raising alleles (weighted by the effect of each allele on HDL-C level)
and is analogous to treatment with increasingly potent CETP inhibitors. Lipid
and lipoprotein values are presented in mg/dL (to convert HDL-C and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] values to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0259) as the difference in mean value for each group compared with the
reference group, with 95% confidence intervals. Associations with major
cardiovascular events were calculated using an inverse variance–weighted
fixed-effects meta-analysis of the study-specific estimates of effect. In panels B
and C, the association between the CETP score and risk of major cardiovascular
events is compared with the association between the risk of major
cardiovascular events and genetic scores consisting of variants in the
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) gene (encodes the target
of statins), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene
(encodes target of PCSK9 inhibitors), and Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 intracellular
cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1L1) gene (encodes target of ezetimibe). All
associations between the genetic scores and risk of major cardiovascular events
are standardized per 10-mg/dL lower level of LDL-C (panel B) or 10-mg/dL
lower level of apolipoprotein B (apoB) (panel C) and measured in the overall
sample of studies that contributed individual-participant data. Data markers
indicate point estimates of effect and are of equal size because the analysis
compared approximately equal-sized groups divided by the median CETP score
value or quartiles of the CETP score (panel A). OR indicates odds ratio.

 the risk of major cardiovascular events compared with partici-
pants in the group with higher HMGCR scores alone (Table 2
and Figure 3A). A synthesis of the evidence from all published
CETP inhibitor randomized trials demonstrated a similar at-
tenuation in apoB reduction resulting in a discordance be-
tween the observed reduction in LDL-C and apoB levels when
any CETP inhibitor was added to treatment with a statin, re-
gardless of whether LDL-C was measured using the Friedewald
equation or the β-quantification method (eTable 9 in the
Supplement).7-11,23,24 The observed attenuation in apoB reduc-
tion with combination therapy in these randomized trials re-
capitulates the genetic association with combined exposure to
CETP and HMGCR variants observed in this study.
To further clarify the association of combined exposure to
CETP and HMGCR variants with both lipoprotein changes and
the risk of cardiovascular events, a stratified analysis was per-
formed. Among participants with HMGCR scores below the
median (analogous to CETP inhibitor monotherapy), the CETP
score was associated with 4.81-mg/dL higher mean HDL-C
level,2.21-mg/dLlowermeanLDL-C,aconcordant2.06-mg/dL
lower mean apoB, and a corresponding lower risk of cardio-
vascular events (OR, 0.946 [95% CI, 0.921-0.972]; P < .001).
By contrast, among participants with HMGCR scores equal to
or above the median (analogous to combination therapy with
a CETP inhibitor added to a statin), the CETP score was asso-
ciated with a similar 4.42-mg/dL higher mean HDL-C level and
2.08-mg/dL lower mean LDL-C but with an attenuated
0.59-mg/dL lower mean apoB and no significant reduction in
cardiovascularevents(OR,0.985[95%CI,0.959-1.012];P = .26)
(Figure 3B). The association with major cardiovascular events
in this group was less than expected for the observed change
in LDL-C level (P = .04) and instead was proportional to the at-
tenuated change in apoB.
The genome-wide association study identified 21 indepen-
dentlyinheritedvariantsassociatedwithdiscordantchangesbe-
tween levels of LDL-C and apoB similar in magnitude to that
seen when CETP variants are combined with HMGCR variants
(eTable10intheSupplement).Inanalysesinvolvingupto60801

Discussion
Genetic variants in the target of CETP inhibitors were associ-
ated with higher HDL-C levels and concordant reductions in
levels of LDL-C and apoB and a corresponding lower risk of car-
diovascular events that was similar in magnitude to the asso-
ciation between genetic variants in the target of other LDL-
lowering therapies and the risk of cardiovascular events per

 unit change in level of LDL-C (and apoB). However, when com-
bined with variants in the target of statins, variants in the tar-
get of CETP inhibitors were associated with discordant reduc-
tions in LDL-C and apoB level and a corresponding reduction
in cardiovascular events that was proportional to the attenu-
ated reduction in apoB but significantly less than expected per
unit change in LDL-C.
These mendelian randomization analyses suggest that the
causal effect of CETP inhibition on the risk of cardiovascular
events appears to be determined by changes in the concen-
tration of apoB-containing lipoproteins rather than changes in
LDL-C or HDL-C level. In external validation analyses, a ge-
netic score consisting of 21 variants with similar naturally oc-
curring discordance between changes in levels of LDL-C and
apoB also was associated with the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease proportional to change in level of apoB rather than LDL-C.
Together,thesefindingssuggestmoregenerallythatthecausal
effect of LDL on the risk of cardiovascular disease appears to
be determined by the concentration of circulating apoB-
containing lipoprotein particles rather than by the total cho-
lesterol mass carried by those particles (as estimated by the
plasma LDL-C level).
Thesemendelianrandomizationresultsareconsistentwith
the results of several previous discordant effects analyses of
LDL-C and apoB, suggesting that the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease is more closely related to apoB level than to LDL-C level.
Under most circumstances, LDL-C and apoB levels are highly
correlated and therefore provide similar information about
cardiovascular risk. It is only when they become discordant
that the differential effects of LDL-C and apoB on the risk of

All information derived from the individual-participant data. A total of
102 837 participants who experienced a total of 13 821 first major cardiovascular
events were included in the analysis. Among all participants, the median
cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) genetic score was 34.8
(interquartile range [IQR], 28.3-41.1; range, 0-54.3). The median CETP and
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) score, IQR, and range of
values for each group is presented in Table 2. Lipid and lipoprotein values are
presented in mg/dL (to convert high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] values to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0259) as the difference in mean value for each group compared with the
reference group, with 95% confidence intervals. Associations with major
cardiovascular events were calculated using an inverse variance–weighted
fixed-effects meta-analysis of the study-specific estimates of effect. In panel B,
the study population was first divided into 2 groups based on whether the
HMGCR score was below or equal to or greater than the median value. The
association between the CETP score and the risk of major cardiovascular events
was then estimated modeling the CETP score as a continuous variable scaled to
the lipid effects in the dichotomous score analysis. There was evidence for
effect modification of the HMGCR score on the association between the CETP
genetic score and the risk of major cardiovascular events (P = .04). Data
markers indicate point estimates of effect and are of equal size because the
analysis compared approximately equal-sized groups divided into a factorial
analysis (panel A) or the median HMGCR score value (panel B). Error bars
represent 95% confidence intervals. apoB indicates apolipoprotein B;

 atherosclerosis can be evaluated. The results of these mende-
lian randomization analyses provide naturally randomized ge-
neticevidencetosupportthepreviousdiscordantanalysisfind-
ings that the likelihood of an apoB-containing lipoprotein
particle entering into and being trapped within the subinti-
mal space of the arterial wall is more closely related to the con-
centration of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins than to
the variable mass of cholesterol within them.25-27
The results of the current mendelian randomization analy-
sessuggestthattheclinicalbenefitofloweringLDL-Clevelmay
bedeterminedbythecorrespondingabsolutereductionincon-

thatlowerLDL-ClevelbyreducingcirculatingLDLparticlecon-
centration through up-regulation of LDL receptors should re-
duce the risk of cardiovascular events proportionally to the ab-
solute reduction in either LDL-C level or the concordant
absolute reduction in apoB. By contrast, therapies that lower
LDL-ClevelwithoutproportionallyreducingapoBlevel,forex-
ample by altering the lipid content of apoB-containing lipo-
proteins without necessarily decreasing the concentration of
those particles, may have an attenuated benefit on cardiovas-
cular disease risk reduction that is proportional to the change
in apoB level but less than expected per unit change in LDL-C.
This finding may help to reconcile the causal effect
of LDL on cardiovascular disease with the results of the
ACCELERATE trial by providing a possible explanation for
how treatment with evacetrapib can lower LDL-C level with-
out reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Adding a
CETP inhibitor to a statin leads to an attenuated reduction in
apoB-containing lipoproteins compared with treatment with
a CETP inhibitor alone, thus resulting in a discordance
between the observed changes in levels of LDL-C and apoB.
In the ACCELERATE trial, treatment with evacetrapib plus a
statin reduced LDL-C level by 37% compared with treatment
with a statin plus placebo, but only reduced plasma apoB
level by 15%, less than half the expected apoB reduction
with evacetrapib monotherapy.11 After 2 years of treatment,
the corresponding 29-mg/dL absolute reduction in LDL-C
would be expected to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular
events by approximately 13% to 19%, which is much greater
than the 5% to 8% reduction in risk that would be expected
from the attenuated 12-mg/dL absolute reduction in
apoB.4,28 This attenuated expected effect size based on the
attenuated change in apoB falls well within the confidence
bounds of the effect reported in the ACCELERATE trial (haz-
ard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.85-1.10] for the composite outcome
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke).11
Similarly, the recently completed and much larger 30 000
person REVEAL (Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of
Anacetrapib Through Lipid Modification) trial reported that
treatment with anacetrapib plus a statin significantly re-
ducedtheriskofcardiovascularevents,butfurtherdetailshave
not yet been reported.29 This trial had a median follow-up of
4 years, which should be long enough to observe the full ef-
fect of the CETP inhibitor–induced lipoprotein changes on the
risk of cardiovascular events.28 The results of the current men-
delian randomization analyses would suggest that treatment
with anacetrapib plus a statin should reduce the risk of car-
diovasculareventsproportionaltotheabsolutechangeinapoB
level, which may be less than the expected risk reduction per
unit lower LDL-C level depending on the level of discordance
between the change in LDL-C and apoB that occurs when an-
acetrapib is added to treatment with atorvastatin.
Furthermore, the results of these mendelian randomiza-
tion analyses also suggest that treatment with a CETP inhibi-
tor as monotherapy may have the potential to effectively re-
duce the risk of cardiovascular events. Both genetic and
therapeutic inhibition of CETP leads to quantitatively concor-
dant changes in LDL-C and apoB levels when considered in the
absence of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Therefore, treat-
ment with a potent CETP inhibitor without a statin could lead
to large concordant absolute reductions in both LDL-C and
apoB, which could in turn lead to large relative reductions in
cardiovascular events. Future cardiovascular outcomes trials
evaluating CETP inhibitor therapy in statin-intolerant pa-
tients could test this hypothesis directly.

 The current mendelian randomization analyses recon-
cile the conflicting results between previous mendelian
randomization studies and the CETP inhibitor randomized
trials. Prior mendelian randomization studies have reported
that some CETP variants are weakly associated with lower
CETP activity, higher HDL-C level, slightly lower LDL-C, and
a marginally lower risk of cardiovascular disease.30,31 These
studies helped to establish CETP as a “genetically validated”
drug target. The failure of CETP inhibitors to reduce the risk
of cardiovascular events in 3 large randomized outcome
trials therefore challenges the utility of using mendelian
randomization studies to inform drug discovery and devel-
opment programs. However, the prior mendelian random-
ization studies did not evaluate the combined effect of
CETP and HMGCR variants and therefore could not have
detected the attenuation in apoB reduction that occurs
when CETP inhibition is combined with HMG-CoA inhibi-
tion. To provide relevant information to inform drug discov-
ery and development, future mendelian randomization
studies should be designed to explicitly evaluate the effect
of variants in therapeutic targets the way therapies directed
against those targets are likely to be used in clinical practice,
including in combination with relevant required back-
ground therapy.17,18
This study has several limitations. First, the results of
a mendelian randomization study do not establish causality.
Second, mendelian randomization studies cannot evaluate
the impact of acutely raising HDL-C to very high, supra-
physiologic levels with a CETP inhibitor. It is possible that very
high levels of HDL-C, reflected by a predominance of large,
cholesterol-richparticles,maybedeleteriousandthereforemay
offset the potential clinical benefit of lowering levels of apoB-
containing lipoprotein particles with a CETP inhibitor.
Third, treatment with the combination of a CETP inhibi-
tor and a statin has resulted in a small increase in systolic blood
pressure in each of the 3 large cardiovascular outcome trials
completedtodate.7,11,23Thisincreasedbloodpressuremayhave
offset some of the potential benefit of the already attenuated
apoB-lowering effect of combination therapy on the risk of car-
diovascular events. Fourth, CETP inhibition might increase
cardiovascular risk through some other as-yet unknown
mechanism that counterbalances any benefit from LDL low-
ering. Fifth, the mechanism by which changes in LDL-C and
apoB levels become discordant when CETP inhibition is com-
binedwithHMG-CoAreductaseinhibitionisunclear,butcould
berelatedtotheredistributionofcholesterolbetweenHDLand
LDL particles.32 Regardless of the mechanism, this effect has
been observed in all randomized trials evaluating combined
treatment with a CETP inhibitor and a statin and recapitu-
lates the genetic effect observed in this study.
Conclusions
Combined exposure to variants in the genes that encode the
targets of CETP inhibitors and statins was associated with dis-
cordantreductionsinLDL-CandapoBlevelsandacorrespond-
ing risk of cardiovascular events that was proportional to the
attenuated reduction in apoB but significantly less than ex-
pected per unit change in LDL-C. The clinical benefit of low-
ering LDL-C levels may therefore depend on the correspond-
ingabsolutereductioninapoB-containinglipoproteinparticles.
