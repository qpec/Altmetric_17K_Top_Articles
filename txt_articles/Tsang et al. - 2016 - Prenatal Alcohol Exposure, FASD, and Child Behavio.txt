abstract
CONTEXT: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are 
associated with behavioral difficulties, although there are no published systematic reviews 
that summarize and critique the literature.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the behavioral characteristics of children with PAE and/or FASD, 
assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments (ASEBA) for school-
aged children with parent, teacher, and youth (self-report) forms.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic literature databases, reference lists, hand-searches.
STUDY SELECTION: peer-reviewed observational studies. 
DATA EXTRACTION: Study appraisal and data extraction were undertaken by 2 independent 
assessors. Meta-analyses were performed for parent-rated Internalizing, Externalizing, and 
Total problems scales. All other ASEBA scales were summarized qualitatively.
RESULTS: Included were 23 articles; 16 were used in meta-analyses. Pooled results showed 
higher Total (mean difference 12.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 7.7–16.5), Internalizing 
(6.3, 95% CI 3.1–9.5), and Externalizing problems scores (12.5, 95% CI 7.9–17.0) in FASD 
than No FASD; and greater odds of scoring in the “Clinical” range in FASD. Pooled results 
demonstrated higher problem scores in children with PAE (P > .05). Qualitative summaries 
of other scales from parents, teachers, and self-report show poorer behavior ratings in 
children with FASD and PAE on composite Problem and Competence scores and many 
Syndrome subscales.
LIMITATIONS: Findings were restricted to behaviors assessed using the ASEBA. The published 
literature was limited, often with only 1 study reporting on a particular scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis reveals that FASD and PAE are associated with problematic 
behavior in many, but not all domains. This clearly affects families, and should be considered 
in clinical practice by providers.

Behavior impairments 
(predominantly in attention, 
disruptive behavior and conduct 
disorders, academic performance, 
and social judgment) have been 
documented in children with fetal 
alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) 
and significant prenatal alcohol 
exposure (PAE).1,2 Secondary 
conditions found with high frequency 
among individuals with FASD and 
PAE include mental health problems, 
psychiatric illness,3,4 school 
difficulties, trouble with the law, 
placement in confined settings (eg, 
psychiatric hospitals), inappropriate 
sexual behavior, and substance 
abuse.5
The importance of screening for and 
assessing behavior problems in the 
field of FASD is well-recognized6,7 
and used to guide clinical practice. 
The psychometrically sound 
Achenbach System of Empirically 
Based Assessment (ASEBA)8 has 
been the most commonly used 
system of behavior assessment in 
children and adolescents with FASD 
since the mid-1990s. ASEBA School-
Age Forms include the parent/
caregiver-rated Child Behavior 
Checklist (CBCL), the Teacher Report 
Form (TRF), and the Youth Self-
Report (YSR).8 The School-Age forms 
assess a broad range of behaviors, 
including competencies, problems, 
and adaptive function. They also 
provide raw and, for clinical 
interpretation, standardized scores. 
We aimed to conduct a systematic 
review of the literature, with meta-
analysis if appropriate, on behavioral 
ratings from multiple informants 
(parents/caregivers, teachers, self-
report) in children with FASD and/
or PAE, who were assessed by using 
the ASEBA School-Age Forms. To our 
knowledge, this is the first review 
of this type. We hypothesized that 
behavior ratings would be poorer in 
children with PAE and/or FASD than 
without.

to Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses recommendations.9
Eligibility Criteria
Selection criteria are summarized in 
Table 1. If a research team reported 
the same outcomes from the same 
cohort in multiple articles, only the 
article with the larger sample size 
was included to prevent duplicate 
inclusion of results.
Key Outcomes
The primary variables of interest 
were the scores for Internalizing 
problems (comprising the 
syndrome subscales: Anxious/
depressed, Withdrawn/depressed, 
and Somatic complaints), 
Externalizing problems 
(comprising Rule-breaking and 
Aggressive behavior syndrome 
subscales), Total problems (sum

subscales: Social, Thought, 
Attention, and Other problems), 
and Total competence (sum of 
Activities, Social, and School 
competence subscales).8 All other 
scale scores and Critical items were 
considered secondary outcomes. 
Data extracted were restricted 
to T scores, raw scores, and/or 
proportions scoring within defined 
clinical ranges (Table 1).
Information Sources
The search was conducted by 
using electronic databases, and 
reference lists from eligible 
articles were inspected and hand-
searched. Electronic databases 
used were Medline (Ovid; 1946 to 
February week 3, 2015), PsycINFO 
(1806 to February week 3, 2015), 
Maternity and Infant Care (1971 
to January 2015), Embase (1974 
to March 10, 2014), AMED (1985 
to February 2015), CINAHL Plus 
(EBSCO Host), and EBM Reviews—
Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews (2005 to January 2015). 
The electronic literature search 
was conducted on March 11, 2014 
(updated on February 17, 2015) and 
manual searches concluded in March 
2015.
Search Strategy
Our search strategy was formulated 
with the assistance of a medical 
librarian. Search terms used for 
all databases were “fetal alcohol,” 
“prenatal alcohol exposure,” “prenatal 
alcohol,” “ASEBA,” “child behavior 
checklist,” “Achenbach,” “teacher 
report form,” “youth self-report,” 
“child behavior,” and “psychosocial.” 
Due to changes in FASD diagnostic 
criteria over time, we selected broad 
search terms to maximize our yield. 
No limits were assigned for the 
electronic searches. As an example, 
our Medline (OVID) search strategy is 
provided in Supplemental Appendix 
1.
Study Selection
Screening and study selection was a 
2-stage process. Inspection of article 
titles, abstracts, and article type was 
conducted during the first stage (by 
TWT). The second stage involved 
review of full-text articles identified 
as potentially eligible (Table 1) by 
2 independent reviewers (TWT and 
BRL), with disagreements resolved 
with EJE.
Data Extraction Process
Data extraction/interpretation was 
undertaken by TWT, independently 
checked by BRL, and disagreements 
resolved by EJE and RZP. Data were 
collated into an electronic database. 
Corresponding authors were 
contacted via e-mail for additional 
information when necessary.
Risk of Bias in Individual Studies
A 7-point critical appraisal tool was 
created for use in this systematic 
review, based on Sanderson et al.10 
Eligible articles were rated according 
to criteria described in Table 2.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Types of data extracted included 
T scores, raw scores, proportions

TABLE 2  
Critical Appraisal Criteria
Criteria
Description
1. Having a defi
 ned sample
Defi
 ned eligibility and exclusion criteria for their sample; and time period (dates) and 
location(s) of recruitment and assessment. If details were reported in a previous article, 
those articles were retrieved and inspected for this information.
2. Having a representative sample
Articles were considered representative and given a score of 1 (“Yes”) if they included cohorts 
recruited from the general population, or from multisite studies and/or large databases of 
consecutively recruited samples. Single-site clinical studies were given a score of 0 (“No”).
3. Outcome rater blinding
Study staff were considered blinded if they were unaware of a FASD diagnosis, previous ASEBA 
scores, and/or presence/absence of PAE during administration of the ASEBA (whichever was 
applicable). Articles were scored as 0 if blinding was not mentioned and if it was unclear 
whether the ASEBA was self-administered.
4. Reporting of relevant ASEBA data
T scores, raw scores, and/or proportion (n, %, or OR) within defi
 ned clinical ranges reported 
for the primary outcome measures (Total competence, Total problems, Internalizing, and/or 
Externalizing scores); and/or for the narrowband measures, DSM-oriented scales, and 2007 
scales.
5. Adequate sample size
Power calculation provided.
6. Statistical adjustment for prenatal exposure to other 
substances
Statistical adjustment for prenatal exposure to other substances in the analyses used to 
generate the ASEBA results extracted for this review. Articles were also scored 1 if they 
excluded participants with prenatal exposure to other substances of abuse (in their 
eligibility/exclusion criteria).
7. Statistical adjustment for other behavioral diagnoses
Statistical adjustment for presence of other psychiatric/behavioral diagnoses (in the child) in 
analyses used to generate ASEBA results extracted for this review, including by comparison 
with contrast groups with no teratogenic causes. Articles were also scored 1 if they 
excluded participants with other psychiatric/behavioral diagnoses (in eligibility/exclusion 
criteria).
Each of the above criteria were given a score of 0 (“no” or “unsure”) or 1 (“yes”), and the scores for each of the 7 domains summed to give a total score out of 7 for each article.

(%), or odds ratios (OR) for scoring 
within defined clinical ranges. 
These different types of data could 
not be combined in subsequent 
meta-analyses or forest plots, so 
separate analyses were undertaken 
for each data type (for primary 
outcomes) if reported by at least 2 
separate studies.11 T or raw score 
data were used to calculate the 
difference in means between “cases” 
and controls and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CIs). Proportions 
within clinical ranges were used 
to calculate the OR and 95% CI 
where applicable. Because this 
review only included the School-
Age Forms, no standardization of 
age and gender-normed T-score 
data were undertaken. T scores 
are more directly related to scores 
obtained from ASEBA forms than 
other standardized scores (eg, z 
scores). Also, T scores are typically 
used in clinical practice. Scores in 
the “Clinical” or “Borderline” range 
on ASEBA scales, defined by T 
scores, generally indicate need for 
therapeutic intervention.
Separate analyses were conducted 
based on the presence or absence 
of (1) an FASD diagnosis (including 
“mixed” groups containing children 
with PAE in which 100% of them 
had an FASD diagnosis), and (2) 
PAE; according to how results were 
reported in the articles. Data were 
grouped according to age category 
(mean age: <5 years, 5–10 years, and 
>10 years), outcome (ASEBA score), 
and PAE level where applicable. 
Effects of different PAE levels on 
primary outcomes were explored 
after attempted categorization 
of PAE levels, using definitions 
suggested by O’Leary et al,12 and 
also using the classification of 
PAE specified in each study (low/
moderate/high).
Where data were stratified and 
presented in multiple groups, 
data from PAE/FASD and control 
groups were extracted according 
to (1) consistency with groups of 
interest for this review, (2) largest 
total sample size, and (3) longest 
duration of PAE. If individual group 
sample sizes were not reported or 
could not be calculated from results 
provided, information was sought 
from corresponding author(s). 
In accordance with Cochrane 
guidelines, if a study had no control/
comparison group, data from another 
study’s comparison group (with 
comparable sample characteristics) 
was borrowed and the comparison 
group sample size divided by the 
number of studies by using the same 
comparison group.11
Comprehensive Meta Analysis 
(version 2.2.064; Biostat, Inc, 
Englewood, NJ) software was used 
for meta-analyses and forest plots, 
by using random effects models. A P 
< .05 denoted statistical significance. 
Heterogeneity of studies in meta-
analyses was assessed by using the 
I2 statistic, where I2 <40% suggested 
homogeneity within pooled data.11 
Funnel plot asymmetry was 
examined if at least 10 studies were 
included in the meta-analysis.11 
Data not included in meta-analyses 
are presented descriptively in the 
Supplemental Appendices.
RESULTS
Literature Search
Database and manual searches 
yielded 491 articles (Fig 1). After 
screening and review, 23 articles 
were included in qualitative or 
quantitative analysis, with between 2 
and 8 articles (total: 16) included in 
various meta-analyses.

were from North America (n = 15; 
65.2%), followed by Australia (n = 
4) and Canada (n = 2), with 1 study 
each from Finland and Taiwan. Four 
North American studies assessed 
predominantly African American 
(83%–94%)24,30 or exclusively 
African American cohorts.32,33 In 
addition to PAE/FASD groups, 3 
studies included subgroups with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD),15,26,34 and 1 study 
included a subgroup with prenatal 
cocaine exposure (Supplemental 
Appendix 2).33
Additional data (eg, individual group 
sample size data) were requested 
for 3 articles,17,23,29 but authors were 
unable to access archives (n = 2) or 
did not respond (n = 1). Sample sizes 
for Robinson et al31 were estimated 
based on number and corresponding 
percentage of children scoring within 
“Clinical” ranges for the primary 
ASEBA outcomes.
Of 23 studies included, 12 (52.2%) 
were retrospective cohort studies. 
Other study types included 
prospective cohort studies (n = 
5), cross-sectional studies (n = 2), 
follow-up analysis studies (n = 2), 
and historical prospective cohort 
studies (n = 2; Tables 3 and 4) . 
In 13 studies, participants were 
accessed from common sources/
databases: 5 sources/databases 
provided cases for 2 studies each 
and a sixth provided cases for 3 
studies, although there was no 
individual subject overlap for 2 of 
these 3 studies. All but 1 study used 
the CBCL form (95.7%), 4 studies 
reported TRF data, and 2 used the 
YSR. One reported both CBCL and 
YSR results and 4 reported both 
CBCL and TRF results. Tables 3 and 4 
detail the ASEBA version(s) used in 
each study. Due to the small number 
of studies reporting consistent 
TRF and YSR results, meta-analysis 
was restricted to studies that 
used the CBCL and reported our 
primary outcomes of interest: Total 
problems, Internalizing problems, 
and Externalizing problems scores. 
The Total competence score from 
the CBCL was not used in meta-
analysis, as it was reported in only 
3 studies (2 FASD studies, 1 PAE 
study). Detailed data are reported in 
the Supplemental Appendices.
Results for a total of 21 different 
ASEBA scales were reported in 
studies of FASD and 44 in studies of 
PAE. The number of FASD studies 
reporting data for any 1 scale ranged 
from 1 to 8 (median of 3 studies per 
scale). In PAE studies, between 1 
and 9 studies provided data for any 
1 scale but 28 scales (63.6% of all 
scales reported in PAE studies) were 
each reported by only 1 study. Data 
on children with FASD or PAE were 
reported for 24 CBCL scales, 19 TRF 
scales, and 3 YSR scales (total of 46 
scales).

FASD diagnostic criteria used in each 
study are included in Table 5. For all 
FASD studies, diagnostic assessments 
were made by experienced 
dysmorphologists, specially trained 
professional interdisciplinary teams, 
or trained clinicians. In FASD studies, 
very few CBCLs were completed by 
the biological parent (3.0%–22.7%).
Ten studies reported T scores for 
Total problems, or Internalizing or 
Externalizing problems in children 
with FASD (Fig 2). One study was 
excluded from the Total problems 
component of this meta-analysis, 
as control group sample size was 
not available.17 Figure 2 indicates 
significantly higher Total problems 
scores (pooled mean difference 
[95% CI]: 12.1 [7.7–16.5]; P < 
.0001), Internalizing problems 
scores (pooled mean difference 
[95% CI]: 6.3 [3.1–9.5]; P < .0001), 
and Externalizing problems scores 
(pooled difference [95% CI]: 12.5 
[7.9–17.0]; P < .0001) in children 
with a FASD diagnosis compared 
with those without.
Four FASD studies reported 
the number of children scoring 
within “Clinical” ranges for Total, 
Internalizing, or Externalizing 
problems,13,14,17,20 2 of these 
reporting data from a comparison 
group.13,20 Compared with children 
without FASD, those with FASD were 
more likely to have Total (OR 34.0, 
95% CI 2.6–450.8]), Internalizing 
(OR 10.0, 95% CI 1.3–77.6), or 
Externalizing problems scores (OR 
18.2, 1.8–186.6) within the “Clinical” 
range, and less likely to have scores 
within the “Normal” range (Fig 3). 
They were also more likely to score 
in the “Borderline” range on the 
Total problems scale. There were 
no significant differences between 
groups in the ORs for scoring 
within the “Borderline” range for 
Internalizing and Externalizing 
problems (P > .05). Critical items 
important to clinical intervention (eg, 
Talks suicide, Attacks others), were 
not reported in any studies. There 
were insufficient studies to compare 
age groups.
Only 2 studies reported Total 
competence outcomes according to 
FASD diagnoses.17,19 Both studies 
reported poorer (lower) parent-
rated Total competence scores in 
children with a FASD diagnosis 
compared with those without, 
regardless of FASD diagnostic 
subgroup. Compared with children 
with similar IQs, mean Total 
competence scores among children 
with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) 
appeared lower in boys (FAS 31.3 
[7.4]; No FAS IQ comparison 45.4 
[9.6]) but not in girls (FAS 40.5 
[12.5]; No FAS IQ comparison 
42.7 [7.3]; P not calculated).17 
Olson et al17 reported that 5 of 9 
children with FAS scored within the 
“Clinical” range, but did not report 
the finding in children without FAS 
(Table 5).

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: T Scores
Seven studies reported raw (n = 
2), percentile (n = 1), or T scores 
(n = 4) for primary outcomes. 
In these studies, the CBCL was 
usually completed by a biological 
parent (range 82.8%–100%). Of 4 
studies reporting T scores, 1 did not 
report or provide subject numbers 
for PAE groups and could not be 
included in the forest plot.23 Of 3 
studies reporting raw or percentile 
scores,30,32,33 only 2 provided SDs30,33 
and only 1 had control group data.33 
Therefore, there were inadequate 
raw score data for meta-analysis, so 
a forest plot was generated for the 
3 studies reporting both T scores 
and subject numbers. Due to limited 
data available for this analysis, PAE 
was stratified as either present (for 
any duration) or absent, rather than 
indicated by low/moderate/high 
levels. There was a trend for higher 
problems scores (poorer outcomes) 
among children with PAE than 
without, although the forest plot 
reveals heterogeneity in results of 
the 3 studies included (Fig 4). The 
largest difference in problem scores 
between PAE and control groups 
was observed in 2 studies in which 
children in the PAE group were 
selected based on high levels of PAE 
(>4 alcoholic drinks at least once 
per week, or ≥13 drinks per week 
throughout pregnancy).26,34 Levels of 
PAE were not defined or reported in 
Brown et al.24 Pooled effects for the 
3 summary problem scales showed 
no statistically significant differences 
between groups (P > .05; Fig 4). 
Age group comparisons were not 
possible.

studies. Only 3 studies reported OR 
for our primary outcomes.29,31,32 
Exploratory forest plots were 
created, incorporating the 3 
primary “problems” scores (Total, 
Externalizing, and Internalizing 
problems) to examine whether odds 
of having problematic behavior 
ratings were higher after PAE. These 
primary outcomes, grouped by 
standardized PAE categories based 
on O’Leary et al,12 indicated no 
increased odds for poorer behavior 
ratings with higher PAE levels (data 
not shown). However, when data 
were grouped by PAE categories 
designated by study authors, the 
odds of poorer behavior ratings 
tended to fall in favor of moderate/
high PAE compared with no PAE 
(Fig 5), although results were not 
statistically significant (P > .05). 
There was no significant increase in 
odds of behavioral problems with 
low/light/occasional PAE compared 
with no PAE (Fig 5). All studies 
included children aged between 5 
and 10 years.
CBCL Total competence score 
according to PAE was reported in 
only 1 study.24 Children with no PAE 
had significantly higher (favorable) 
Total competence ratings than 
children with PAE, even if drinking 
had stopped during the second 
trimester (T scores: No PAE 16.6 
[2.8]; Stopped drinking 13.8 [2.7]; 
Continued drinking: 13.5 [3.4]; P < 
.008).
A detailed table displaying the 
primary outcomes for all subgroups 
in included studies is provided in 
Supplemental Appendix 3.
Secondary Outcomes: Other Forms: 
Other CBCL Scores, TRF, YSR
Secondary outcomes included (1) 
other ASEBA School-Age Form 
scales and Critical items reported in 
eligible studies (rated by parents/
caregivers, teachers, and/or youth), 
and (2) primary outcome scales 
rated by teachers and youth. Data 
were summarized qualitatively and 
highlights reported below. Detailed 
summaries of secondary outcomes 
based on presence of FASD diagnosis 
or PAE can be found in Supplemental 
Appendices 4 (summary) and 5 (table 
of results).
Presence of an FASD Diagnosis
Parent and teacher ratings of Total, 
Externalizing, and Internalizing 
problems were higher among 
children with FASD than without, 
even when compared with children 
with PAE but not FASD. CBCL scales 
showed the most common problems 
among children with FASD were the 
following: Thought problems, Rule-
breaking behavior/Delinquency, 
Aggressive behavior, Attention 
problems, and Social problems. 
Children with FASD generally 
received higher Externalizing 
behavior scores than children 
with ADHD. However, parent and 
teacher ratings were inconsistent 
for Internalizing and Externalizing 
problems when comparing groups 
with FASD with ADHD (Supplemental 
Appendices 3, 4, and 5).
Total competence (and School 
competence subscale) scores were 
poorer among children with FASD 
than without (only parent ratings 
available).17,19 Scores on other 
competence subscales were mixed: 
in 1 study, children with FASD had 
better Social competence scores than 
those with PAE (without FASD),35 
although scores in both groups were 
generally in the “Clinical” range. The 
Activities competence score in FASD 
was similar to comparison peers and 
within the “Normal” range in most 
studies. Somatic complaints,14,19,35 
Anxiety/depression,14,19,35 
Withdrawn/depressed,14,19,35 
Academic performance (1 study),18 
and Adaptive functioning (1 study)18 
subscale scores were similar in 
FASD and comparison groups, and 
usually within the “Normal” range 
(Supplemental Appendices 4 and 5).
In 1 large study, CBCL ratings showed 
no differences in Total, Externalizing,

diagnostic subgroups (FAS/partial 
FAS; static encephalopathy, alcohol-
exposed; neurobehavioral disorder, 
alcohol-exposed) using the 4-digit 
diagnostic code.19 Critical items were 
not reported in any of the studies in 
our review.
Presence of PAE
The literature on PAE was less 
consistent than that on FASD in terms 
of behavior ratings among groups 
with different exposure levels, and 
ratings from different informant 
types. Generally, children with PAE 
had poorer parent and teacher 
ratings for Total competence and 
Total problems than nonexposed 
children. Most scales and subscales 
in the PAE literature were reported 
in only 1 study (Supplemental 
Appendices 4 and 5), and no study 
reported Critical items.
Risk of Bias
According to our methodological 
appraisal criteria (Table 2), scores 
for the 23 included studies ranged 
from 1 to 5 (mean: 2.7 [1.1]; Table 6). 
As per eligibility criteria, all studies 
reported ASEBA scores of interest. 
Only 1 study met criterion on sample 
size calculation/justification19 (which 
is not standard practice in reporting 
of observational studies). Most (9) 
studies received a score of 3. In 
relation to statistical adjustment 
for other prenatal exposures or 
psychiatric/behavior diagnoses, 
studies were scored “No” (ie, 0) if 
adjustments were not applied to 
ASEBA results, even if adjustments 
were applied to other variables (given 
the current study focus on FASD/
PAE effects on ASEBA scores). We 
were unable to examine funnel plot 
asymmetry, as fewer than 10 studies 
were included in the meta-analyses.

FASD and PAE (as assessed using 
the popular ASEBA School-Age 
Forms) yields several important 
findings. First, of clinical concern, 
children with FASD had much 
poorer parent ratings on a range of 
behavioral outcomes than children 
without FASD. Second, there 
were no significant differences in 
behavior ratings in children with and 
without PAE when data for the most 
commonly reported parent-rated 
problem scales were pooled. Third, 
the published body of literature lacks 
quality and consistency of reporting. 
Over time, diagnostic systems have 
become more systematized and study 
quality has improved.
Our meta-analysis confirms 
that children with FASD have 
significantly higher scores for Total 
problems, Internalizing problems, 
and Externalizing problems than 
children without FASD. Pooled mean 
group differences in T scores ranged 
from 6 for Internalizing problems 
to 12 for Total and Externalizing 
problems. Children with FASD 
were more likely to have scores 
within the “Clinical” range for these 
primary measures with pooled ORs 
ranging from 10 (95% CI 1.3–77.6) 
to 34 (95% CI 2.6–450.8). Children 
with “Clinical” scores usually 
require therapeutic intervention. 
Although a limited number of scales 
were reported by both parents 
and teachers, there was general 
agreement between informants 
that children with FASD had poorer 
behavior than children without, with 
some inconsistencies when FASD 
and ADHD (without PAE) groups 
were compared.
Few informants for FASD groups 
were biological parents, whereas 
most informants in PAE studies 
were biological parents. The effect 
of different informants and home 
placements on CBCL ratings is 
unclear. Fagerlund et al13 was 
the only author to compare CBCL 
ratings in different living situations: 
children in residential care had 
more Total and Internalizing 
problems than those in foster/
adoptive homes or biological homes, 
and more Externalizing problems 
than children in foster/adoptive

homes (P < .05). This may reflect 
the informants’ viewpoint or the 
impact of institutional care. Paley et 
al18 used the Parenting Stress Index 
and reported higher stress levels in 
foster/adoptive parents (77%) than 
biological parents (23%), but did 
not compare CBCL scores between 
these informants. Only 1 PAE study 
incorporated home placement as a 
covariate in their CBCL analyses and 
found no significant effect of place of 
residence on behavior.34
In our qualitative assessment, 
children with FASD had poorer 
scores on the following scales: 
Total competence, Total problems, 
Internalizing problems, Externalizing 
problems, School competence, Rule 
breaking behavior/delinquency, 
Aggressive behavior, Attention 
problems, Social problems, and Social 
competence. These findings are in 
agreement with previous research 
reporting that items from the Rule

breaking, Attention problems, and 
Aggressive CBCL scales discriminated 
children with FASD from children 
with ADHD but no PAE, oppositional 
defiant/conduct disorder, and 
typically developing healthy control 
children, although competence 
items were not examined in those 
studies.7 These findings concur with 
studies that use different behavioral 
assessments.36,37 Congruent with 
our review findings, a major focus 
in FASD intervention research is to 
develop and validate interventions 
for challenging behaviors, social 
skills deficits, and problems with 
self-regulation.38
No significant problems were 
observed in children with FASD 
in Activities competence, Somatic 
complaints, Withdrawn/depressed, 
Anxiety/depression, Academic 
performance (1 TRF study), Adaptive 
functioning (1 TRF study), or 
Hyperactive scales. These findings 
do not concur with studies that 
use other assessment tools, which 
report impairments in most of these 
areas,37,39 although few studies in 
this review reported each of these 
outcomes. It is possible that ASEBA 
items assessing these constructs 
are insufficiently sensitive to these 
deficits in the FASD population.
We found no group differences in 
behavior among children with and 
without PAE. The number of studies 
included was limited and PAE levels 
were inconsistently defined, so it was 
difficult to establish a dose-response 
pattern by standardized definitions. 
However, when using classifications 
for PAE levels provided by authors, 
there was a tendency toward 
increasing behavior problems with 
higher levels of PAE. Most articles 
reported only a few of the possible 
78 scales from the CBCL, TRF, and 
YSR inclusive, and 28 scales were 
reported in only 1 study, precluding 
generalization of results.
A potential limitation of this review 
was the focus on assessments using 
the ASEBA. However, in many 
included studies, other measures 
used concurrently identified similar 
behavior problems. The review 
unveiled limitations within the 
available literature. Study quality 
was generally low, perhaps due to 
inclusion of any observational study 
that reported outcomes of interest, 
regardless of whether ASEBA scores 
reported were of primary interest 
in that study (hence many studies 
did not calculate sample sizes or 
statistical adjustments for ASEBA 
results). Our focus on the ASEBA 
scales should be set in context for 
clinicians. We have documented 
significant behavior problems 
in FASD; however, challenging 
behavior is only 1 aspect of central 
nervous system dysfunction in FASD. 
Neurocognitive and communication 
deficits, for example, are also 
common.
Several studies drew data from the 
same databases, so some children 
may have been included more than 
once. Thus, subjects in different 
studies may not be independent.

were used in included studies, as 
several different criteria are used 
internationally. However, the 
consistency of behavioral outcomes 
within our FASD meta-analyses 
suggests little effect of diagnostic 
criteria on behavior ratings assessed 
by using the ASEBA School-Age 
Forms.
The paucity of data made it difficult 
to assess several ASEBA scales or 
to stratify by age. Inconsistencies 
in reporting of results precluded 
assessment of publication bias 
because <10 studies could be 
included in any meta-analysis. 
Although risk of bias could not be 
addressed quantitatively in this 
review, it is worth mentioning that 
data from 2 different kinds of studies 
were included: Longitudinal cohort 
studies (based on PAE), and case-
control studies (based on FASD 
diagnosis). Findings from separate 
PAE and FASD meta-analyses are 
intuitive, and possibly reflect a 
detection bias favoring greater effects 
in children with FASD than PAE. This 
is because women drinking alcohol 
during pregnancy do not necessarily 
give birth to a child with behavioral 
impairments or FASD, whereas 
children with an FASD diagnosis are 
more likely to show greater severity 
of impairments.
There are strengths in the current 
study, including the meta-analysis 
of results derived from the most 
commonly reported behavior 
assessment tool used to study 
FASD and PAE. Additionally, we 
summarized all scales and subscales 
reported in the literature using the 
ASEBA School-Age Forms in this 
systematic review.
Research and Clinical Implications
Overall, this review unveiled 
behaviors apparently less 
problematic in FASD, behaviors 
in need of additional study due 
to inconsistent findings, or an 
insufficient number of studies on 
particular scales. It also revealed 
consistency in behavior ratings 
between different studies and by 
different informants in studies of 
FASD, but not PAE.
Findings provide direction for 
future research on FASD and PAE. 
Descriptive data comprehensively 
detailing behavioral deficits 
are crucial to guide research on 
interventions for the surprisingly 
prevalent FASD. To improve quality 
of the knowledge base, there is 
clear need for consistency in (1) 
reporting of and stratification 
according to PAE levels and timing, 
(2) selection of ASEBA scales, and 
(3) reporting of ASEBA scores. 
When feasible, methodology 
changes are needed. For instance, in 
ASEBA research, it would be useful 
to use multiple informants, to blind 
assessors to PAE/FASD status, and 
to control for other psychiatric/
behavior diagnoses with similar 
symptoms by using contrast groups 
(eg, ADHD or IQ comparison groups 
with no teratogenic exposure). 
More complete investigation and 
reporting of the often overlooked 
ASEBA subscales and Critical 
items are warranted, especially 
given their significance for clinical 
practice.
Behavior problems are almost 
universal in children with FASD 
and significantly affect family life 
and schooling. From a clinical 
perspective, a clear understanding 
of behaviors in children with 
FASD and after PAE is important 
to families and providers seeking 
to improve outcomes for affected 
individuals. This review makes 
clear that providers should 
ask about PAE, and refer for 
assessment/diagnosis of FASD 
when appropriate. Indeed, 
FASD should be included in the 
differential diagnosis of any 
child with behavioral difficulties. 
Children with FASD and clinically 
concerning behavior problems may 
benefit considerably from early 
intervention, and knowledge of 
behaviors associated with FASD will 
inform diagnosis and management.
