In Brief
Acute high-fat feeding suppresses brain
glucose uptake. To preserve cognitive
function after prolonged feeding on a
high-fat diet and to forestall
neurodegeneration in obesity, there is a
compensatory upregulation of glucose
transporters at the blood-brain barrier as
a result of inflammatory signals from
perivascular macrophages.

SUMMARY
High-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces rapid reprogram-
ming of systemic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate
that HFD feeding of mice downregulates glucose
transporter (GLUT)-1 expression in blood-brain bar-
rier (BBB) vascular endothelial cells (BECs) and
reduces brain glucose uptake. Upon prolonged
HFD feeding, GLUT1 expression is restored, which
is paralleled by increased expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in macrophages
at the BBB. In turn, inducible reduction of GLUT1
expression
specifically
in
BECs
reduces
brain
glucose uptake and increases VEGF serum con-
centrations in lean mice. Conversely, myeloid-
cell-specific deletion of VEGF in VEGFDmyel mice
impairs
BBB-GLUT1
expression,
brain
glucose
uptake, and memory formation in obese, but not
in lean mice. Moreover, obese VEGFDmyel mice
exhibit
exaggerated
progression
of
cognitive
decline and neuroinflammation on an Alzheimer’s
disease background. These experiments reveal
that
transient,
HFD-elicited
reduction
of
brain
glucose uptake initiates a compensatory increase
of
VEGF
production
and
assign
obesity-asso-
ciated macrophage activation a homeostatic role
to restore cerebral glucose metabolism, preserve
cognitive function, and limit neurodegeneration in
obesity.
INTRODUCTION
Over the last years, it has become evident that homeostatic
signals, as exemplified by leptin (Zhang et al., 1994), commu-
nicate energy storage of the organism to the brain to adapt
behavioral and autonomic responses in control of energy ho-
meostasis (Gautron et al., 2015; Kleinridders et al., 2009a).
Importantly, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding can cause a state of
neuronal leptin and insulin resistance to promote positive en-
ergy balance (Vogt and Bru
¨ ning, 2013; Williams and Elmquist,
2012). Here, the manifestation of neuronal insulin and leptin
resistance has been linked to the activation of inflammatory
signaling cascades, similar to what is observed in peripheral
metabolic tissues, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose
tissue of obese animal models and humans (Gregor and Hota-
misligil, 2011; Kleinridders et al., 2009b; Tsaousidou et al.,
2014). However, the exact mechanism(s) of how inflammatory
signaling cascades are activated in obesity remain only partly
defined. In this respect, it is remarkable how rapidly shifting
animals to high-fat-containing, energy-dense food reprograms
metabolism and concomitantly regulates inflammation. Within
only 3 days of HFD feeding, expression of proinflammatory
cytokines increases in the hypothalamus of rodents as the
key regulatory center in energy and glucose homeostasis
(Thaler et al., 2012). These acute changes are later accompa-
nied by a whole array of cellular responses, including gliosis,

 alterations in brain vasculature, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)
integrity (Ka
¨ lin et al., 2015; Thaler et al., 2012; Yi et al.,
2012a, 2012b). Despite all this knowledge on the acute effects
of altered nutrition and acutely shifting systemic metabolism
to fat utilization, the consequences of this intervention for
the brain as an organ critically depending on sustained energy
supply, covered primarily by glucose metabolism, remain
largely undefined.
Glucose uptake—also in the CNS—occurs primarily by facili-
tated diffusion through a family of specific glucose transporters.
Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), encoded by SLC2A1, is the pre-
dominant glucose transporter expressed on vascular endothelial
cells of the BBB (Takata et al., 1990). Alterations of GLUT1
expression have severe consequences, underlining the critical
importance of this transporter to ensure glucose uptake in the
brain in addition to further roles in other tissues (Freemerman
et al., 2014; Heilig et al., 2003; Macintyre et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2006). Thus, homozygous inactivation of the Slc2a1 gene
in mice leads to embryonic lethality (Wang et al., 2006). Already,
heterozygous Slc2a1 knockout mice exhibit impaired motor
function as well as spontaneous seizures, therefore mimicking
the major features of the human GLUT1-deficiency syndrome
(GLUT1-DS), where haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 gene
is the cause of a rare form of encephalopathy (Wang et al.,
2006). Here, the functional deficiency of the GLUT1 protein
limits brain glucose availability and is characterized by infan-
tile seizures, developmental delay, and acquired microcephaly
(De Vivo et al., 1991; Seidner et al., 1998). Recently, it was shown
that GLUT1 is of paramount importance for maintenance of
capillary networks, blood flow, and BBB integrity, and reduc-
tions in GLUT1 levels contribute to neuronal dysfunction and
neurodegeneration in mice (Winkler et al., 2015). In individuals
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), GLUT1 expression at the
BBB has been reported to decrease (Horwood and Davies,
1994; Kalaria and Harik, 1989; Mooradian et al., 1997; Vannucci
et al., 1994). However, the GLUT1-dependent regulation of
brain glucose uptake in obesity has so far not been directly
addressed.
In order to define the potential acute HFD feeding-elicited
changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, we examined the
regulation of brain glucose transporters in response to HFD
feeding. We find that GLUT1 expression decreases in response
to HFD feeding, leading to transiently decreased brain glucose
uptake. Upon prolonged HFD feeding, GLUT1 expression is
restored in brain endothelial cells (BECs), which is paralleled
by increased recruitment and VEGF expression of perivascular
macrophages and increased circulating VEGF concentrations.
In turn, short-term treatment of mice with recombinant vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can prevent the acute brain
glucose uptake-inhibitory effect of HFD feeding. Genetically
mimicking partial, acute reduction of GLUT1-BBB expression
similarly reduces brain glucose uptake and evokes a compen-
satory increase in circulating VEGF concentrations. More-
over, myeloid-cell-specific ablation of VEGF in mice reduces
BBB-GLUT1 expression, brain glucose uptake, memory forma-
tion, and aggravates AD progression in obese but not in lean
mice. Collectively, our experiments reveal a critical role for
VEGF and HFD-elicited activation of inflammation to ensure
cerebral glucose metabolism and to limit progression of neuro-
degeneration in obesity.
RESULTS
Acute HFD Feeding Impairs Brain Glucose Uptake
Acute HFD feeding rapidly reprograms systemic metabolism and
fuel usage (Lee et al., 2011; Thaler et al., 2012). This notion was
further substantiated when we assessed systemic substrate
usage via indirect calorimetry in mice upon acutely switching
feeding from normal chow diet (NCD) to high-fat diet (HFD).
Metabolism under these conditions acutely shifts from circadian,
alternating carbohydrate and fat usage to a permanent predom-
inance of fat utilization, a phenomenon that is accompanied
by rapid weight gain and increased glycemia (Figures 1A, S1A,
and S1B). We next aimed to investigate how cerebral glucose
metabolism acutely adapts to HFD feeding and its accompa-
nying alterations in systemic substrate usage. To this end, we
first compared the mRNA expression of critical glucose trans-
porters in the CNS of mice, which had either remained on NCD
feeding or had been switched to HFD feeding for 3 days. This
analysis revealed a dramatic 50% downregulation of Slc2a1
expression, while expression of Slc2a3 and Slc2a5 remained
unaltered (Figure 1B). When we further assessed the dynamics
of brain Slc2a1 expression upon acute HFD feeding, we found
that brain Slc2a1 mRNA expression was transiently reduced as
early as 3 days of HFD feeding and remained suppressed until
1 week of HFD feeding, while it slowly recovered 2 weeks after
HFD feeding initiation and was restored to comparable extend
to that observed in constantly NCD fed animals after 4 weeks
of HFD feeding (Figure 1C).
Next, we directly assessed GLUT1 protein expression in BECs
via immunofluorescent staining for endothelial-cell-specific lec-
tin and GLUT1. GLUT1 immunoreactivity was significantly
reduced in BECs between 3 and 7 days after HFD feeding initia-
tion (Figures 1D and S1C). Taken together, these experiments
clearly indicate that acute HFD feeding transiently reduces the
expression of the critical glucose transporter for brain glucose
uptake, i.e., GLUT1 at the BBB.
In order to investigate potential compensatory mechanisms,
which could account for restoration of GLUT1 expression upon
prolonged HFD feeding, we monitored circulating VEGF concen-
trations, as VEGF is able to upregulate GLUT1 expression at the
blood-brain barrier (Lee et al., 2007; Mani et al., 2003; Pekala
et al., 1990; Sone et al., 2000; Yeh et al., 2008). Assessment of
circulating VEGF concentrations revealed significantly increased
serum VEGF concentrations 4 weeks after initiation of HFD
feeding, concomitant with full restoration of BBB-GLUT1 expres-
sion at this time (Figure 1E). To investigate the origin of increased
VEGF production upon HFD feeding, we monitored Vegfa mRNA
expression in spleen, liver, and adipose tissue at different times
of HFD feeding. This analysis revealed that Vegfa mRNA expres-
sion only transiently increased in the spleen 7 days after initiation
of HFD feeding (Figures S1D–S1F). However, this transient
upregulation clearly cannot account for the prolonged increase
in circulating VEGF concentrations and potentially the pro-
longed restoration of BBB-GLUT1 expression upon chronic
HFD feeding.

 Since CD206-positive macrophages are a rich source of VEGF
production (He et al., 2012), we next assessed the abundance
of these cells at the BBB and their VEGF immunoreactivity at
different times following initiation of HFD feeding. Both the num-
ber and VEGF immunoreactivity of perivascular, CD206-positive
macrophages increased as early as 5 days after HFD feeding,
increased constantly until 14 days after HFD feeding initiation,
and was persistently elevated up to 28 days into HFD feeding
(Figures 1F, 1G, and S1G).
Next, we aimed to directly investigate whether acute HFD
feeding indeed reduced brain glucose uptake as suggested by
reduced BBB-GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression. To this
end, we employed
18F-FDG positron emission tomography
(PET) scans to quantitatively assess brain glucose uptake.
Therefore, wild-type animals were subjected to 18F-FDG PET
scans and thereafter either remained on NCD or switched to
HFD for 3 days. After 3 days, the 18F-FDG PET scan was
repeated and brain glucose uptake was compared to the base-
line scan of the same animals. While repeated 18F-FDG PET
scans in animals, which remained on NCD, expectedly revealed
no decrease in brain glucose uptake (Figures S2A–S2D), animals
that were placed on HFD for 3 days exhibited significantly

 reduced glucose uptake in motor and sensory cortex, hypothal-
amus, and nucleus accumbens compared to their baseline scan
(Figures 2A–2E), revealing that diet-induced reduction of GLUT1
expression also functionally translated in reduced brain glucose
uptake.
To investigate whether the restored GLUT1 expression
observed upon prolonged HFD feeding also translated into a
functional restoration of brain glucose uptake in these mice,
we investigated another cohort of mice, in which serial 18F-FDG
PET scans were performed before onset of HFD feeding, as
well as 3 and 21 days after HFD feeding. This analysis confirmed
the robust suppression of brain glucose uptake in mice fed HFD
for 3 days, but failed to detect a significant reduction of brain
glucose uptake in mice fed a HFD for 21 days compared to the
baseline scan under NCD feeding (Figures S2E–S2H).

To test whether VEGF can indeed
counteract
the
HFD
feeding-induced
suppression of brain glucose uptake,
we
performed
a
rescue
experiment,
where mice were injected twice daily
either with saline or recombinant VEGF
during an acute 3-day exposure to HFD
feeding, followed by 18F-FDG PET scans.
This treatment increased serum VEGF
concentrations
comparable
to
those
observed in wild-type mice fed HFD for
4 weeks (Figures 1E and S2I). Glucose up-
take in the VEGF-treated mice returned
back to baseline levels in the cortex and
even increased in the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens
(Figures 2F–2J) compared to saline-injected control mice.
Saturated Fatty Acids Suppress BBB-GLUT1 Activity
In order to identify potential mediators of HFD-induced down-
regulation of BBB-GLUT1 expression, we first investigated
whether serum of animals, which were exposed to HFD for
3 days, contained factors capable of decreasing GLUT1 expres-
sion in BECs. To this end, we incubated immortalized BECs for
24 hr with serum of mice, which were kept on NCD or fed an
HFD for 3 days. qPCR analysis revealed a robust 90% reduction
of Slc2a1 mRNA expression upon incubation with HFD serum
(Figure 3A). Similarly, GLUT1 protein expression was robustly
repressed by incubating BECs with serum of short-term HFD
fed mice (Figure 3B).
Cell 165, 882–895, May 5, 2016
885
 Next, we hypothesized that altered lipid composition of serum
of HFD-fed mice might contribute to its ability to decrease
glucose uptake in BECs. We analyzed the serum content of
non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) of mice kept on either NCD
or fed an HFD for 3 days. This analysis revealed an increase of
NEFA serum concentrations in HFD-fed mice (Figure 3C). There-
fore, we assessed whether saturated fatty acids might function-
ally impair glucose uptake and subsequent glycolysis in BECs.
Indeed, incubating these cells with palmitic acid resulted in
decrease of glucose uptake (Figure 3D) and glycolytic flux (Fig-
ures 3E–3G). Furthermore, we found that recombinant VEGF
could prevent palmitic acid-induced suppression of glucose up-
take and glycolysis in these cells (Figures 3D–3G).
Inducible GLUT1 Deletion in BECs Reduces Brain
Glucose Uptake and Increases Circulating VEGF
Concentrations
In order to investigate whether reducing GLUT1 expression to
similar extend as observed upon acute HFD feeding reduces
brain glucose uptake and potentially elicits a compensatory in-
crease in circulating VEGF concentrations, we aimed to geneti-
cally reduce expression of GLUT1 specifically in BECs of adult
mice. To this end, we crossed mice that carry a loxP-flanked
Slc2a1 allele (Wei et al., 2015) with those expressing a
CreERT2-fusion protein under control of the thyroxine trans-
porter Slco1c1-promoter specifically in BECs (Ridder et al.,
2011), thus allowing for BEC-specific, tamoxifen-inducible dele-
tion of GLUT1. To investigate the consequences of acute, dose-
dependent reduction of GLUT1 expression in BECs, we used
both mice heterozygous for the floxed Slc2a1 allele (Slc2a1lox/+
Slco1c1-CreERT2+/�, i.e., GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice) as well as those
homozygous for the Slc2a1 floxed allele (Slc2a1lox/lox Slco1c1-
CreERT2+/�, i.e., GLUT-1iDBBB mice). After tamoxifen treatment
for 3 days, brain cortices of control, GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice, and
GLUT-1iDBBB mice were analyzed for Slc2a1 expression via
qPCR and by co-immunohistochemistry for GLUT1 and lectin
(Figures 4A, 4B, and S3B). This analysis revealed successful
reduction of BEC GLUT1 protein expression by 40% in
GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice and 67% in GLUT-1iDBBB mice (Figure 4B).
Acutely, partially reducing BEC GLUT1 expression resulted in a
profound mortality of GLUT-1iDBBB mice, which all died of sei-
zures within 4 days of tamoxifen-treatment initiation (Figure 4C).
On the other hand, reducing BEC GLUT1 expression acutely by
40% in GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice resulted in significant mortality of
50% over a 28-day period following initiation of tamoxifen treat-
ment (Figure 4C). These experiments revealed the profound con-
sequences of even partial, acute downregulation of BEC-GLUT1
expression in adult mice.

 GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice and GLUT-1iDBBB mice exhibited a dose-
dependent reduction of brain glucose uptake (Figures 4D, 4E,
S3A, and S3C–S3F). Strikingly, the reduction of brain glucose
uptake in GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice was quantitatively comparable
to that observed in key glucose sensing regions of mice fed an
HFD for 3 days (Figures 2A–2E).
Moreover, longitudinal assessment of serum VEGF concentra-
tions in these animals revealed that in GLUT-1iDBBB mice, after
3 days of tamoxifen treatment, serum VEGF concentrations
had increased more than 2-fold compared to tamoxifen-treated
control mice (Figure 4F). In GLUT-1iD/+BBB mice, VEGF concen-
trations significantly increased between 5 and 14 days after initi-
ation of tamoxifen treatment (Figure 4F).
Myeloid-Cell-Derived VEGF Is Required to Maintain
BBB-GLUT1 Expression in Obesity
To test whether VEGF upregulation in macrophages is indeed
causally required for restoration of BBB-GLUT1 expression and
brain glucose metabolism upon prolonged HFD feeding, we
decided to investigate the consequence of ablating VEGF expres-
sion from myeloid lineage cells on BBB-GLUT1 expression and
brain glucose metabolism in obesity. Here, we crossed mice car-
rying a loxP-flanked Vegfa allele (Gerber et al., 1999) with those
expressing the Cre-recombinase in myeloid lineage cells under
controlofthelysozyme(Lys)M-promoter(Clausenetal.,1999).Re-
sulting Vegfalox/lox LysMCre+/�, i.e., VEGFDmyel mice were then
analyzed exposing the animals to either NCD or HFD after

 weaning. Analysis of serum VEGF levels confirmed the increase in
circulating VEGF concentrations in control HFD-fed mice
compared to NCD-fed controls and revealed a profound reduc-
tion in circulating VEGF concentrations in VEGFDmyel mice, both
on NCD and HFD (Figure 5A). Comparing body weights revealed
no significant differences between genotypes, while animals of
both genotypes also gained indistinguishably body weight or fat
mass upon exposure to HFD, consistent with unaltered steady-
state food intake of these animals (Figures S4A–S4C). Similarly,
systemic glucose homeostasis remained unaltered in NCD-fed
control and VEGFDmyel mice as assessed by glucose tolerance
testing (Figure 5B). In contrast, HFD-fed VEGFDmyel mice ex-
hibited an impaired glucose tolerance compared to control
mice, when the animals were exposed to HFD feeding (Figure 5B).
There was no significant difference in Slc2a1 mRNA expres-
sion between control and VEGFDmyel mice fed an NCD (Fig-
ure 5C), indicating that myeloid-derived VEGF is not required
to control BBB-GLUT1 expression in lean mice. However,
VEGFDmyel mice exhibited significantly reduced Slc2a1 mRNA
expression compared to controls under HFD feeding (Figure 5C).
The notion that myeloid-cell-derived VEGF is required for main-
tenance of BEC-GLUT1 expression under HFD conditions was

 further substantiated through co-immunohistochemical staining
of GLUT1 in lectin-positive BECs. Here, GLUT1 immunoreac-
tivity remained unaltered in control and VEGFDmyel mice under
NCD, while VEGFDmyel mice exhibited significantly reduced
GLUT1 immunoreactivity compared to controls under HFD (Fig-
ures 5D, 5E, S4D, and S4E). Consistent with the restoration of
BEC GLUT1 expression 4 weeks after HFD feeding, in control
animals prolonged HFD feeding did not result in reduced
GLUT1 immunoreactivity in BECs, indicating that indeed upregu-
lated VEGF can restore normal BBB-GLUT1 expression upon
chronic HFD feeding even in long-term (Figures 5D and 5E).
To directly investigate the consequences of reduced BBB-
GLUT1 expression in HFD-fed VEGFDmyel mice, we quantified
brain glucose uptake in these animals compared to controls
exposed to HFD feeding during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
clamps. This analysis revealed a significant reduction of brain
glucose uptake in these animals (Figures S4F–S4H). While insu-
lin-stimulated suppression of hepatic glucose production and in-
sulin-stimulated glucose uptake into WAT remained unaltered in
these mice, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal mus-
cle tended to be increased in VEGFDmyel mice, although not
reaching statistical significance (Figures S4F–S4H).
Interestingly, we found increased deposits of extravascular
immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the cortex of VEGFDmyel mice on
HFD, but not upon NCD feeding, indicating increased vascular
leakage as evidence for altered BBB-permeability in these ani-
mals (Figures 5F and 5G).
Given that brain glucose availability is critical for neuronal
function, including cognitive performance, we next compared
the ability of the different groups of mice at the age of
16 months to properly establish spatial memory in a Morris
water maze task. While in lean and obese control mice, as
well as in lean VEGFDmyel mice, the time required to locate
the hidden platform similarly decreased during the training ses-
sions, obese VEGFDmyel mice tended to require more time to
locate the platform (Figure 5H). Upon removal of the platform,
VEGFDmyel mice exposed to HFD performed significantly worse
to retain spatial memory compared to the NCD-fed groups of
mice (Figure 5I).
Myeloid-Cell-Derived VEGF Limits Neurodegeneration
in Obesity
In light of the discovery that VEGF is required to maintain brain
glucose uptake and cognitive function in obesity, and brain
glucose uptake is a critical determinant of the progression of
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
(Gong et al., 2006; Winkler et al., 2015), we decided to address
whether myeloid-cell-derived VEGF is also required to limit
neurodegeneration in obesity in a murine AD model. To this
end, we crossed VEGFDmyel mice with APP.PS1-transgenic
mice, expressing the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor
protein (APP) and also expressing a variant of presenilin (PS)-1
(Jankowsky et al., 2004). Further intercrossing of these animals
resulted in four different experimental groups of mice, (1) control
animals, (2) APP.PS1-transgenic mice, (3) VEGFDmyel mice, and
(4) VEGFDmyel mice, which express the APP.PS1-transgenes.
First, we compared GLUT1 expression in BECs in the different
lines of animals both in cortex and hippocampus. Consistent
with what we observed in VEGFDmyel mice compared to controls
on NCD, lean VEGFDmyel mice generated from these intercrosses
exhibited unaltered GLUT1 expression in BECs (Figures S5A–
S5D). APP.PS1-transgenic mice exhibited unaltered BBB-
GLUT1 expression under NCD and this remained unchanged in
the additional absence of myeloid-cell-derived VEGF in lean
VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice (Figures S5A–S5D).
Upon HFD feeding, however, mRNA and protein expression
of BBB-GLUT1 expression decreased to similar extent in both
VEGFDmyel and VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice in cortex (Figures 6A,
6B, and 6D) as well as BBB-GLUT1 protein expression decreased
in hippocampus (Figures 6C and 6E).
Since cognitive deficits have been reported to manifest at
the age of 9 months in APP.PS1-transgenic mice (Jankowsky
et al., 2004), we aimed to test, whether impairment of brain
glucose uptake in HFD-fed VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice could
aggravate this phenotype and therefore assessed spatial mem-
ory learning in 6-month-old mice. Indeed, already at this young
age only VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice, when exposed to HFD,
performed significantly worse compared to all other tested
genotypes (Figures 6F and 6G). These data indicate that HFD
feeding in the presence of reduced circulating VEGF concen-
trations aggravates cognitive defects in APP.PS1-transgenic
mice.
Next, we aimed to investigate the molecular basis for aggra-
vated memory impairment of VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice and
therefore quantified amyloid plaque burden in the different
groups of mice. While plaque burden was significantly increased
in the presence of the APP.PS1-transgene, Ab-plaque formation
was not further aggravated in the absence of myeloid-cell-
derived VEGF both in NCD- and HFD-fed animals (Figures 7A,
7B, S6A, and S6B). Similarly, brain levels of Ab1–42 as assessed
by ELISA detection remained unaltered in the absence of
myeloid-derived VEGF in APP.PS1-transgenic mice (Figure S6C).
Thus, impairing brain glucose metabolism on an AD background
does not aggravate plaque formation.
To study the underlying mechanism by which the absence of
myeloid-derived VEGF impaired cognitive function in APP.PS1-
transgenic mice, vascular leakage was assessed by quantif-
ication of extravascular accumulation of IgG. This analysis
confirmed a significant increase in IgG deposits in the absence
of myeloid-derived VEGF as an additional evidence of altered
BBB functionality in these obese mice (Figures 7C and 7D).
Another hallmark in AD progression is the activation of neuro-
inflammation. Thus, we determined the distribution of GFAP
immunoreactivity as readout for astrocyte activation in the brains
of the different animals. This analysis revealed that in APP.PS1-
transgenic animals, the number of GFAP-immunoreactive cells
clearly increased both in cortex and hippocampus (Figures 7E,
7F, S7A, and S7B). However, under HFD feeding conditions,
the additional absence of myeloid-derived VEGF and thus sub-
sequently reduced brain glucose uptake caused a further signif-
icant increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in HFD-fed VEGFDmyel/
APP.PS1 mice (Figures 7E, 7F, S7A, and S7B). In addition, immu-
noreactivity of phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) as readout for in-
flammatory JNK-activation was further substantially increased
under these conditions in HFD-fed VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice
(Figures 7G, 7H, S7C, and S7D).

 Taken together, reducing brain glucose uptake through HFD
feeding and simultaneously preventing the compensatory in-
crease in circulating VEGF cooperates with APP.PS1-driven neu-
rodegenerationthroughaggravationofneuroinflammationwithout
increasing Ab1–42 processing or plaque burden. Thus, circulating
VEGF is also critically required to limit AD-associated cognitive
impairment and progression of neuroinflammation in obesity.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate that acute HFD feeding in mice transiently
reduces GLUT1 expression in vascular endothelial cells of the
BBB (BECs) and functionally reduces brain glucose uptake.
This finding is further substantiated by the notion that incubation
of BECs with serum derived from mice exposed to high-fat diet

 feeding for 3 days significantly reduces GLUT1 mRNA and pro-
tein expression. This clearly indicates the presence of soluble
factor(s) in serum of these animals, which are responsible for
reducing GLUT1 expression in BECs. We also demonstrate
that palmitic acid as a saturated fatty acid, which is increased
in circulation of obese mice (Benoit et al., 2009; Boden, 1997),
acutely inhibits glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism in
cultured BECs. Thus, saturated fatty acids may provide an inter-
esting candidate to mediate BBB-GLUT1 downregulation in
obesity. However, the exact nature of these signal(s) and the mo-
lecular mechanisms activated to decrease GLUT1 expression in
BECs remains to be identified in further studies.
Another important question is how transiently lowered brain
glucose uptake leads to increased circulating VEGF concentra-
tions and ultimately to restored BBB-GLUT1 expression. Our ex-
periments reveal that the primary source of compensatory VEGF
production in obesity is myeloid lineage cells, likely CD206-pos-
itive perivascular macrophages. Although a minor component of
the CNS, perivascular macrophages are important immunoregu-
latory cells (Galea et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2001). These cells
appear to account for the majority of increased VEGF during the
first 4 weeks of HFD feeding, when no persistent increases of
VEGF expression in spleen, liver, and adipose tissue are detect-
able. It appears likely that during the further course of obesity
development, macrophages recruited to adipose tissue may
also contribute to the compensatory increase in circulating
VEGF concentrations. This notion is consistent with the previous
reports of elevated VEGF release from visceral adipose tissue of
obese subjects (Schlich et al., 2013).
Future experiments will have to delineate how reduced brain
glucose uptake couples to activation of perivascular macro-
phages to increase VEGF production and ultimately re-instate
GLUT1 expression at the neurovascular unit. One possibility is
that glucose-sensitive neurons, which respond to changes in
extracellular glucose concentration (Steinbusch et al., 2015),
can regulate parasympathetic outflow, which in turn activates
inflammation. The reduction of brain glucose uptake reported
here on acute HFD feeding is particularly predominant in areas
that are enriched in glucose-sensing neurons such as the hypo-
thalamus (Karschin et al., 1997; Levin et al., 1999; Peters et al.,
2004). Reduction of parasympathetic tone is well documented
in obesity and has been demonstrated to contribute to the activa-
tion of inflammation of obesity (Andersson and Tracey, 2012; Ro-
sas-Ballina and Tracey, 2009). In fact, specific activation of para-
sympathetic a7-nicotinergic receptors can limit obesity-induced
inflammation and improve obesity-associated systemic insulin
resistance (Bencherif et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). Clearly,
further studies have to define the neurocircuitry, which couples
reduced neuronal glucose availability to the activation of VEGF
production in macrophages, both in the BBB and in other tissues.
Given the critical role of tight control of brain glucose availabil-
ity for organismal survival, activation of VEGF expression and
inflammation upon transient reduction of brain glucose meta-
bolism provides a prime mechanism to reinstate glucose avail-
ability to the CNS. First, increased VEGF concentrations can
restore glucose uptake in BECs, as shown here in vitro and
in vivo. Second, activation of systemic inflammation causes in-
sulin resistance in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (Sabio
et al., 2008), thereby reducing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
in these tissues and impairing insulin-stimulated suppression of
hepatic glucose production (Arkan et al., 2005; Sabio et al., 2008;
Wunderlich et al., 2008). Thus, blood glucose concentrations in-
crease and thereby provide increased substrate availability for
the CNS. This concept would define obesity-associated inflam-
mation as a homeostatic regulatory principle to restore tran-
siently decreased brain glucose uptake in obesity through multi-
ple mechanisms.
The notion that activation of inflammatory signaling represents
a key step in the development of obesity-associated insulin resis-
tance has fueled a whole research area to identify anti-inflamma-
tory strategies as novel drug targets for this disease (Gregor and
Hotamisligil, 2011; Hotamisligil, 2006). However, currently the ef-
ficiency of anti-inflammatory strategies is solely assessed based
ontheirabilityto improve peripheralinsulin sensitivity andglucose
metabolism. Thus, when inflammatory signaling pathways are
targeted in metabolic diseases, attention will have to be paid to
the potential side effects of the intervention on compensatory
VEGF production and its potential detrimental effects on brain
glucose metabolism, cognition, and neurodegeneration.
Finally, our results may have clear implications for further
strategies targeting neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.
Recent studies have revealed a critical role for brain glucose
metabolism in AD progression. On the one hand, glucose avail-
ability has been implicated in the activity-dependent co-secre-
tion of Ab-peptides and thus contributes to activity-dependent
progression of neurodegeneration (Macauley et al., 2015).
On the other hand, it was demonstrated that partially reducing
BBB-GLUT1 expression leads to massive progression of AD
pathology in mouse models (Winkler et al., 2015). Interestingly,
the latter phenomenon occurred in the absence of alterations
in Ab-processing and accumulation, similar to what is observed
in our VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice under high-fat diet conditions.

 Collectively, our study assigns VEGF a critical compensatory
role to reinstate brain glucose metabolism in obesity, a notion
of far-reaching therapeutic implications not only for obesity,
but also cancer treatment and that of neurodegenerative disor-
ders in obese subjects, setting the ground for more personalized
therapeutic decisions in obese patients in the future.

PET imaging was performed using an Inveon preclinical PET/CT system
(Siemens) as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Culture of Cerebral Endothelial Cells
The immortalized mouse brain capillary EC line cerebral endothelial cells
(cEND) were used as described (Fo
¨ rster et al., 2005) and outlined in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Glucose Uptake Assay
Cellular glucose uptake was measured in cEND cells using a fluorescent
2-NBDG assay. For details, refer to the Supplemental ExperimentalProcedures.
Measurement of Glycolytic Flux
Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured using the XF96 Flux
Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For details, see Supplemental Experimental

mental Procedures.
Morris Water Maze
The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning and to evaluate
the working and reference memory functions. Lean or obese VEGFDmyel
mice and control mice were tested at 16 months of age. Obese HFD-fed
APP.PS1-transgenic mice, VEGFDmyel mice, VEGFDmyel/APP.PS1 mice, and
corresponding controls were tested at 6 months of age. For details see the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analyses
All data, unless otherwise indicated, are shown as mean values ± SEM. In
boxplots, the upper and lower whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum
values of the data, center lines indicate the median, and the mean values
are represented by plus signs. Datasets with only two independent groups
were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed Student’s
t test. Datasets with more than two groups were analyzed using either one-
way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or two-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s post hoc test. For statistical analyses of GTTs, we performed
two-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. All figures and sta-
tistical analyses were generated using GraphPad Prism 6. p < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
