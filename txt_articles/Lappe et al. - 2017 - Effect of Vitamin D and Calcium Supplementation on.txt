IMPORTANCE Evidence suggests that low vitamin D status may increase the risk of cancer.
OBJECTIVE To determine if dietary supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium reduces
the risk of cancer among older women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 4-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
population-based randomized clinical trial in 31 rural counties (June 24, 2009, to August 26,
2015—the final date of follow-up). A total of 2303 healthy postmenopausal women 55 years
or older were randomized, 1156 to the treatment group and 1147 to the placebo group.
Duration of treatment was 4 years.
INTERVENTIONS The treatment group (vitamin D3 + calcium group) received 2000 IU/d
of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg/d of calcium; the placebo group received identical placebos.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the incidence of all-type cancer
(excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis and proportional hazards modeling.
RESULTS Among 2303 randomized women (mean age, 65.2 years [SD, 7.0]; mean baseline
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 32.8 ng/mL [SD, 10.5]), 2064 (90%) completed the study.
At year 1, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 43.9 ng/mL in the vitamin D3 + calcium
group and 31.6 ng/mL in the placebo group. A new diagnosis of cancer was confirmed
in 109 participants, 45 (3.89%) in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 64 (5.58%) in the
placebo group (difference, 1.69% [95% CI, −0.06% to 3.46%]; P = .06). Kaplan-Meier
incidence over 4 years was 0.042 (95% CI, 0.032 to 0.056) in the vitamin D3 + calcium
group and 0.060 (95% CI, 0.048 to 0.076) in the placebo group; P = .06. In unadjusted
Cox proportional hazards regression, the hazard ratio was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.02).
Adverse events potentially related to the study included renal calculi (16 participants in the
vitamin D3 + calcium group and 10 in the placebo group), and elevated serum calcium levels
(6 in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 2 in the placebo group).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among healthy postmenopausal older women with a mean
baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 32.8 ng/mL, supplementation with vitamin D3
and calcium compared with placebo did not result in a significantly lower risk of all-type
cancer at 4 years. Further research is necessary to assess the possible role of vitamin D
in cancer prevention.

C
ancer is a major public health burden in the United
States.1 About 40% of the population will have a can-
cer diagnosis at some point during their lives along with
the associated morbidity, effects on quality of life, and health
care costs. The cost of cancer care in the United States is esti-
mated to increase from $125 billion in 2010 to $156 billion in
2020.1 Worldwide, it is estimated that during the next 20 years
the annual number of cancer diagnoses will increase from
14 million (in 2012) to 22 million by 2032.1 Thus, a strategy that
would help prevent cancer is highly desirable.
Considerable interest exists in the potential role of vita-
min D for prevention of cancer. Garland and Garland first pro-
posed “the Vitamin D Hypothesis” (ie, that vitamin D protects
against cancer)2 in 1980 when they observed that colon cancer
mortality rates in the United States were highest in places with
the least sunlight. They hypothesized the “sunlight effect” was
due to vitamin D. Since then, numerous studies have shown an
inverse relationship between risk of cancer and sunlight expo-
sure or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level, the func-
tional indicator of vitamin D status.3-7 Although not all clinical
studies show this association,8,9 numerous cell culture and in
vivostudiessupportthepossibilityofaroleofvitaminDinpre-
venting cancer development and progression.10-15
The objective of this randomized clinical trial (RCT)
was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with vitamin D3
and calcium on risk of incident all-type cancer in healthy
older women.
Methods
Trial Design and Enrollment Criteria
This study was approved by the Creighton University institu-
tional review board. The trial protocol and statistical analysis
are available in Supplement 1. A data and safety monitoring
board (DSMB) of investigators outside the university pro-
videdoversight.Thiswasarandomized,double-blindplacebo-
controlled, population-based study. Postmenopausal women
55 years and older were recruited from the population of in-
dependently living rural women in 31 of 93 counties in
Nebraska. Recruitment mailings were sent to the target popu-
lation using lists containing addresses of about 99% of the oc-
cupied housing units in the 31 counties. Health care clini-
cians and directors of public health departments were asked
to advertise the study. Advertisements also were placed and
talks given in the 31-county area. Potential participants were
directed to provide call-back information on a toll-free voice-
mail. Study staff returned calls and did telephone screening.
Eligible patients were scheduled for visit 1 screening; eligible
patients were randomized at visit 1. Prior to randomization,
nurses gave eligible patients time to read the consent form and
to ask questions. Then they asked the volunteers to describe
their understanding of the study. All participants signed in-
formed consent.
Intervention
Participants were randomized by a statistician (P.W.) to 1 of 2
groups by computerized block randomization, using a block
size of 8. The treatment group (vitamin D3 + calcium group)
received vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol; 2000-IU capsule, once
daily)andcalciumcarbonate(500-mgtablet,3timesdaily)and
the placebo group received identical placebos. Only the stat-
istician and a research assistant who had no contact with par-
ticipants were unblinded to group assignment. Supplements
and placebos were made by Tishcon. Participants were asked
to limit vitamin D supplementation, outside of the interven-
tion, to 800 IU per day, in keeping with the National Acad-
emy of Medicine (NAM; formerly Institute of Medicine) rec-
ommendedintakelevel.16Participantsalsowereaskedbystudy
nurses to limit additional calcium to 1500 mg per day as di-
rected by the investigators and DSMB to be consistent with the
previous Creighton cancer and vitamin D study.17 Study
follow-up visits were every 6 months.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was first diagnosis of any type of can-
cer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), and each partici-
pant with a new cancer was counted only once. Prespecified
secondary analyses were planned for common specific types
of cancer including cancers of the breast, lung, and colon, and
lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma. Other secondary out-
comes included hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteo-
arthritis, colonic adenomas and diabetes, upper respiratory
tract infections, and falls.
At each visit, participants were asked about new diagno-
ses. If they had been diagnosed with cancer or any tumor or
colonic adenoma, medical records were retrieved to verify and
date the diagnosis and to validate by pathology reports. Cause
of death for participants who died during the study was ob-
tained so that deaths due to cancer were captured. Only the
planned secondary analyses for cancer outcomes are re-
ported; the other secondary outcomes will be reported else-
where.
Assessments
Baseline serum 25(OH)D level and annual 25(OH)D level re-
sponse to vitamin D3 were analyzed with the Liaison Analyzer
(Diasorin). The Creighton laboratory participates in the Vita-
min D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS) quality
assurance system for 25(OH)D assays,18 and Creighton test
samples were consistently close to the international mean.
Key Points
Question Does dietary supplementation with vitamin D3
and calcium reduce the risk of cancer among older women?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 2303 healthy
postmenopausal women with a mean baseline serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 32.8 ng/mL, supplementation with
vitamin D3 and calcium compared with placebo did not significantly
reduce the incidence of all-type cancer over 4 years of follow-up.
Meaning Supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium
did not result in a significantly lower risk of cancer among healthy
older women.

Supplements were distributed at each visit, and all bottles
and unused supplements were returned at the next visit. Ad-
herence was determined by weighing returned bottles and cal-
culating number of pills taken. Adherence was reported for
those who discontinued supplements. Annually, serum cal-
cium levels were measured to monitor for hypercalcemia and
creatinine levels for changes in renal function.
Height and weight were measured at baseline and annu-
ally. The Block 2005 Food Frequency Questionnaire (Block
Dietary Data Systems)19 was administered at baseline and
final visit. Nurses asked participants to self-identify race
and ethnicity for purposes of describing the cohort in dis-
semination of findings. Participants selected their race from
the list of US Census Bureau categories: (1) American Indian
or Alaska Native, (2) Asian, (3) black or African American,
(4) Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, (5) white or Cauca-
sian, or (6) do not wish to provide. Participants self-identified
their ethnicity by selecting: (1) Hispanic or Latino or (2) not
Hispanic or Latino.
Sample Size Calculations
The planned sample size was based on data from a previous
study,17 in which the overall cancer incidence was 6.9% (20 of
288 participants) over 4 years (or 1 − [1 − 20 / 288]¼ = 1.78%
per year) in the placebo group and 2.9% (13 of 446 partici-
pants) overall (0.74% per year) in the vitamin D3 + calcium
group. The relative risk (RR) (2.9% / 6.9%) was about 40%.
A conservative assumption was made that the reduction
in cancer incidence in the proposed study might be less than
the 60% reduction seen in the previous study; thus, this
study was powered to detect a 50% reduction in cancer inci-
dence. With 1000 patients per group, the power for the cur-
rent study was 94.4% (per equation 4.17 of Fleiss et al20) if
the annual incidence rates were 2% for the control group and
1% for the treatment group; 86.2% power if the rates were 1.5%
for the control group and 0.75% for the treatment group; and
68.5%poweriftherateswere1%forthecontrolgroupand0.5%
for the treatment group.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive data of demographic and other variables in-
cluded means and SDs, medians and interquartile ranges
(IQRs), or percentages. Comparisons between the treatment
groups at baseline, for supplement compliance and for with-
drawals used the Fisher exact test, the χ2 test of indepen-
dence, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (for continuous variables
with highly skewed distributions), and the pooled variance es-
timate t test. Time in the study was calculated as time from
enrollment until the outcome of interest, death, last visit
(for participants who withdrew during the study), or final visit
(ninth visit). Time in the study was truncated to 4 years for any
study participant with a final visit more than 4 years after base-
line. Cancers diagnosed more than 4 years after baseline
were excluded.
Intention-to-Treat Analysis
Prespecified intention-to-treat analyses according to treat-
ment group was performed for cancer of any site and for
cancer of the breast. There were too few other specific can-
cers to have sufficient power to compare the treatment
groups. The effect of treatment on cancer diagnosis during
the 4 years of the study was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis, in which time to first cancer diagnosis
was modeled as a function of treatment group. All partici-
pants were included in this analysis, except those who with-
drew from the study prior to visit 2 without providing any
follow-up information. Because this analysis excluded some
randomized participants, a post hoc χ2 test was also per-
formed comparing the proportion affected by cancer in the 2
treatment groups. This analysis included all randomized
study participants, and each participant was scored as hav-
ing a positive or negative result for known cancer. Those
with no follow-up were all scored as having a negative result
for cancer. In addition, time to first cancer diagnosis was
modeled as a function of treatment group using proportional
hazards modeling, so that hazard ratios (HRs) could be cal-
culated and so that factors considered to affect cancer risk
could be considered for inclusion in the model. Study vari-
ables other than treatment group were each evaluated for
significant differences between treatment groups and
between cancer-affected and unaffected participants. When
significant differences were observed, proportional hazards
modeling of treatment group association with cancer out-
comes was performed with and without adjustment for the
other variables. All participants were included in this analy-
sis, except those who withdrew from the study prior to visit
2 without providing any follow-up information were
excluded. The primary analysis of prespecified cancer of all
sites was the event of interest.
Post Hoc Analyses
Given the expected time for vitamin D supplementation to
increase serum 25(OH)D level and to exert a potential effect
on cancer development or progression, a post hoc analysis
was performed of cancer diagnosis during years 2 through 4
of the study, which excluded participants who developed
cancer or withdrew from the study prior to completing a
year of the study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was per-
formed, in which time to first cancer diagnosis was modeled
as a function of treatment group and time to first cancer
diagnosis was also modeled as a function of treatment group
using proportional hazards modeling, so that HRs could
be calculated.
The study protocol prespecified a secondary nested case-
control analysis to test for an association between serum
25(OH)D levels achieved at 1 year and cancer incidence. How-
ever, this was changed to a post hoc analysis using Cox pro-
portional hazards models to examine cancer incidence as a
function of 25(OH)D while adjusting for potentially impor-
tant covariates including age, smoking, body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared), hormone use, and family history (for addi-
tional details, see Supplement 2).

P value of less than .05 for statistical significance, using SAS

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Recruitment occurred from June 2009 to August 2011 with
5146 telephone and visit screens (Figure 1). Of 2303 partici-
pants randomized, 1156 (50.2%) were allocated to the vita-
min D3 + calcium group and 1147 to the placebo group. Of
2303 participants enrolled, 2064 (89.6%; 89.0% of the vita-
min D3 + calcium group, 90.2% of the placebo group) com-
pleted 4 years of study. Of those not completing the study, 16
participants (7 in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 9 in the
placebo group) died during the study. There were 1102 par-
ticipants in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 1095 partici-
pants in the placebo group that provided some follow-up.
There was no significant difference between groups in the
proportion completing the study (difference in proportion,
0.012 [95% CI, −0.013 to 0.037]) or dying while participating
in the study (difference in proportion, 0.002 [95% CI, −0.006
to 0.037]).

(Table 2). For example, at 36 months the 25(OH)D level was
45.1 ng/mL in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 32.4 ng/mL
in the placebo group.
Baseline median for vitamin D3 dose was 734 IU/d (IQR,
100-1200) in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 700 IU/d
(IQR, 0-1000) in the placebo group. Mean outside-of-study
vitamin D3 and calcium supplement dose for visits 2 through
9 in each group are reported in Table 2, as are dietary in-
takes for each nutrient. No differences were observed,
except in vitamin D supplementation: women in the placebo
group took higher amounts of vitamin D supplementation
in addition to the study supplements than those in the vita-
min D3 + calcium group.
Intention-to-Treat Analysis
Among the 1156 participants assigned to the vitamin D3 + cal-
cium group, 45 cancers (3.89%) were diagnosed; among the
1147 participants assigned to the placebo group, 64 cancers
(5.58%) were diagnosed (between-group difference, 1.69%
[95% CI, −0.06% to 3.46%], P = .06). After excluding 54 par-
ticipants in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 52 partici-
pants in the placebo group who withdrew after randomiza-
tion with no follow-up, there was no significant difference in
cancer incidence between the 2 groups using Kaplan-Meier
analysis (log-rank test of equality over strata, P = .06). Kaplan-
Meier incidence over 4 years was 0.042 (95% CI, 0.032 to
0.056) in the vitamin D3 + calcium group and 0.060 (95% CI,
0.048 to 0.076) in the placebo group, P = .06; Figure 2). In pro-
portional hazards modeling (which included the same events
as the Kaplan-Meier analysis, excluded the same participants
with no follow-up, and was not adjusted for other covari-
ates), the HR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.02).

were invasive and 10 were in situ. Table 3 indicates the groups
in which the invasive and in situ cancers occurred. Of 194
colonic adenomas identified in 181 participants, 2 cancers were
identified as in situ cancers of the colorectum.

study participants with no follow-up, age at baseline was sig-
nificantly associated with cancer incidence (HR, 1.05 (95% CI,

ing the study was significantly more common in the placebo
group. With age adjustment, the HR associated with treat-

There were no serious supplement-related adverse events.
Renal calculi were reported by 26 participants, 16 (1.4%) in the
vitamin D3 + calcium group and 10 (0.9%) in the placebo group
(difference in proportion, 0.005 [95% CI, −0.004 to 0.015]).
Eight participants had 1 serum calcium value above normal
(6inthevitaminD3 + calciumgroupand2intheplacebogroup;

Post Hoc Analyses
In post hoc analysis, in which participants who withdrew,
died, or developed cancer prior to being in the study for 12
months were excluded (excluding 84 participants in the vita-
min D3 + calcium group and 78 in the placebo group), a total
of34participantsinthevitaminD3 + calciumgroupand52par-
ticipants in the placebo group developed cancer during years
2 through 4 (χ2, 3.17% vs 4.86%, P = .046); difference in pro-
portions, 1.7% (95% CI, 0.1% to 3.4%). In Kaplan-Meier analy-
sis,thedifferencewassignificant(log-ranktestofequalityover
strata, P = .047), and in proportional hazards modeling, the HR
was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.99) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
In another post hoc analysis, the achieved serum
25(OH)D level was significantly inversely associated with can-
cer incidence (P = .03, coefficient, −0.017). Compared with
25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL as baseline, the estimated HR
for cancer incidence for 25(OH)D levels between 30 ng/mL
and 55 ng/mL was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.97) (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this RCT involving healthy postmenopausal older women
with mean serum 25(OH)D levels of 32.8 ng/mL, supplemen-
tation with vitamin D3 and calcium compared with placebo did
not result in a significantly lower risk of all-type cancer at
4 years. There was no statistically significant difference be-
tween the treatment groups in incidence of breast cancer.
One explanation for lack of statistically significant dif-
ferences between the treatment groups in all-type can-
cer incidence is that the study cohort had higher baseline
serum 25(OH)D levels compared with the US population. In
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) from 2001 through 2006, an estimated 75% to
80% of the adult population had serum 25(OH)D level values
less than 30 ng/mL, and approximately 30% had 25(OH)D
level values below 20 ng/mL,21 the 2 most commonly recom-
mended levels for vitamin D adequacy from the NAM and the
Endocrine Society, respectively. In this cohort, the mean
baseline serum 25(OH)D level was approximately 33 ng/mL;
only 9.6% of baseline 25(OH)D level values were less than
20 ng/mL, and 38.6% were less than 30 ng/mL. Response
to change in vitamin D intake, similar to other nutrients, is
dependent on an individual’
s initial nutritional status.22
Thus, if vitamin D does have any potential effect on cancer
prevention, persons with higher levels of serum 25(OH)D
(ie, better nutrient status) would be expected to have a lesser
effect from supplementation than those with lower baseline
levels, at least up to some cut-off level.
Studies of vitamin D supplementation have an advantage
over studies of most other nutrients because serum 25(OH)D
is available as an intermediate measure (biomarker) of
supplement efficacy. Serum 25(OH)D takes into account the
known variation in absorption efficiency of vitamin D3 and in

its enzymatic 25-hydroxylation, and also accounts for total
vitamin D intake, including outside-of-study supplements,
diet, and sunlight exposure. The higher intake of outside
vitamin D3 supplementation in the placebo group in this
study cohort (the majority of individuals would be consid-
ered to be vitamin D sufficient23) might obscure any treat-
ment effect in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The association observed in the post hoc analysis exclud-
ing cancers that were diagnosed during year 1 may be related
to the possibility that cancers diagnosed early in the study
may have been present upon enrollment and that time is
needed for vitamin D supplementation to increase serum
25(OH)D level and to exert a potential effect on cancer devel-
opment or progression. However, this finding, as well as the
post hoc observation suggesting an inverse association
between serum 25(OH)D levels and cancer, should be consid-
ered only exploratory and hypothesis generating, and require
assessment in further studies.
Other studies have evaluated the relationship between vi-
tamin D supplementation and cancer. In an RCT of vitamin D3
and calcium supplementation with cancer incidence as a pri-
mary outcome from the Women’
s Health Initiative (WHI),20
postmenopausal women randomly assigned to daily 1000-mg
calcium and 400-IU vitamin D or placebo pills showed no dif-
ference in colorectal cancer incidence. However, the interven-
tion dose was only 400 IU per day, and the supplement ad-
herence was only about 50%. The NAM-recommended dietary
allowance for vitamin D is 600 IU per day for persons aged 50
to 70 years and 800 IU per day for those 70 years or older. In a
nested case-control study of the WHI, there was a statisti-
cally significant inverse relationship between baseline serum
25(OH)D level and incidence of colorectal cancer risk (RR, 2.53
[95% CI, 1.49 to 4.32]).20
In a previous study by Lappe et al,17 in which cancer
was a secondary outcome, vitamin D3 and calcium supple-
mentation were significantly associated with decreased can-
cer incidence. In the entire cohort (vitamin D3 and calcium
supplementation and placebo groups), which had a mean
baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 28.7 ng/mL (SD, 8.1), the RR
of developing cancer for the vitamin D3 and calcium group
compared with placebo was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.82;
P = .01); for the calcium-only group, the RR was 0.53 (95% CI,
0.27 to 1.03, P = .06). Excluding cancers that developed dur-
ing year 1, the RR for the vitamin D3 and calcium supplemen-
tation group was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .005),
whereas for the calcium-only group, the RR was 0.59 (95%
CI, 0.29 to 1.21, P = .15).
In a secondary analysis of a fracture prevention RCT in
the United Kingdom, a single dose of 100 000 IU of vitamin D
every 4 months had no significant effect on cancer incidence
(age-adjusted RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.42]).24 The Rosiglita-
zone Evaluated for Cardiovascular Outcomes in Oral Agent
Combination Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (RECORD) trial, an
RCT of vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) and calcium (1000 mg per
day) to prevent fragility fractures, also showed no effect on
cancer incidence. Both of these latter studies used vitamin D
doses of about 800 IU per day, which is less than the vita-
min D3 dose of 2000 IU per day used in this study.
Observational studies showed an inverse association
between sunlight and cancer incidence.4 Meta-analyses
showed an association with lower risk of colon cancer in per-
sons with higher 25(OH)D levels,5,6 and prospective studies
found a significant nonlinear inverse association between
25(OH)D level and breast cancer.7 Other studies, such as
the 25(OH)D pooling project,25 showed no relationship
between 25(OH)D level and cancer.26,27
In this trial, calcium supplements were included in the in-
tervention to ensure maintenance of adequate calcium in-
take, primarily because the combination of vitamin D and cal-
cium reduced the incidence of cancer in the previous RCT,17
whereas the calcium-only group showed no significant effect
on cancer incidence. Calcium is important for vitamin D sig-
naling, and it has been shown that antiproliferative effects of
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in colorectal cancer cell lines de-
pend on expression of the calcium-sensing receptor.28 In ani-
mal studies, dietary calcium was significantly inversely asso-
ciated with carcinogenesis of the large bowel.29 In humans,
high calcium intakes have been associated with lower risk of
colon cancer30 and adenomas,31 and RCTs of calcium have
shown decreased risk of adenomas.32,33 However, a more re-
cent RCT35 found no effect of calcium, vitamin D, or both on
incidence of recurrent adenomas. Whether calcium supple-
mentationaffectedcancerincidenceinthisstudyisnotknown.
In the vitamin D3 + calcium group supplemented with
2000 IU per day of vitamin D3 along with 1500 mg per day of
calcium, neither hypercalcemia nor renal calculi (both con-
firmed by medical records) occurred more often than would
be expected in a population of older women. Renal calculi
were reported by 1.4% of the treatment group and 0.9% of
the placebo group, which compares with incidence of 0.3%
over 4 years among older women in Rochester, Minnesota.36
The occurrence of hypercalcemia and renal calculi did not
differ between treatment groups. In contrast, in the WHI,37
the incidence of self-reported clinically diagnosed urinary
tract stones was higher in the calcium and vitamin D group
than in the placebo group (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.34]).
When participants with adherence of less than 80% for their
assigned treatment were censored, findings were similar.
This study has several strengths. This study was a popu-
lation-based RCT that used an intervention with a relatively
high dose of vitamin D3 that increased mean serum 25(OH)D
level, had low participant drop out, measured 25(OH)D level
at baseline and annually on all participants, had on-site moni-
toring every 6 months, and validated cancer outcomes with
pathology reports.
This study also has several limitations. The cohort in-
cluded older women, primarily non-Hispanic white, and no
men, which limits generalizability. Allowing members of the
placebo group to take their own vitamin D and calcium, not
to exceed NAM recommendations, may have biased the analy-
ses by treatment group toward null. The NAM recommenda-
tions for minimum vitamin D intake and of 25(OH)D level for
skeletal health, and the high prevalence of low vitamin D sta-
tus and osteoporosis rendered it unethical to ask participants
to avoid any supplemental vitamin D and calcium. Further-
more, due to widespread information about the potential

importance of vitamin D, it would be unfeasible to recruit for
a large study in which no participants were permitted to take
vitamin D. Sample-size calculations were based on a study co-
hort with lower baseline 25(OH)D levels than the current co-
hort and limited the power to find an effect of vitamin D3
supplementation. Another limitation was the post hoc na-
ture of the analysis that excluded cancers diagnosed during
year 1 and the analysis that examined the relationship be-
tween 25(OH)D levels and cancer.
Conclusions
Among healthy postmenopausal older women with a mean
baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 32.8 ng/mL,
supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium compared with
placebo did not result in a significantly lower risk of all-type
cancer at 4 years. Further research is necessary to assess the
possible role of vitamin D in cancer prevention.
