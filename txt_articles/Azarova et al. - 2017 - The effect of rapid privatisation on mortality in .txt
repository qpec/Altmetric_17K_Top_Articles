Summary
Background Population-level data suggest that economic disruptions in the early 1990s increased working-age male 
mortality in post-Soviet countries. This study uses individual-level data, using an indirect estimation method, to test 
the hypothesis that fast privatisation increased mortality in Russia.
Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we surveyed surviving relatives of individuals who lived through the 
post-communist transition to retrieve demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of their parents, siblings, and 
male partners. The survey was done within the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) project PrivMort 
(The Impact of Privatization on the Mortality Crisis in Eastern Europe). We surveyed relatives in 20 mono-industrial 
towns in the European part of Russia (ie, the landmass to the west of the Urals). We compared ten fast-privatised and 
ten slow-privatised towns selected using propensity score matching. In the selected towns, population surveys were 
done in which respondents provided information about vital status, sociodemographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics and health-related behaviours of their parents, two eldest siblings (if eligible), and first husbands or 
long-term partners. We calculated indirect age-standardised mortality rates in fast and slow privatised towns and 
then, in multivariate analyses, calculated Poisson proportional incidence rate ratios to estimate the effect of rapid 
privatisation on all-cause mortality risk.
Findings Between November, 2014, and March, 2015, 21 494 households were identified in 20 towns. Overall, 
13 932 valid interviews were done (with information collected for 38 339 relatives [21 634 men and 16 705 women]). 
Fast privatisation was strongly associated with higher working-age male mortality rates both between 1992 and 1998 
(age-standardised mortality ratio in men aged 20–69 years in fast vs slow privatised towns: 1·13, SMR 0·83, 95% CI 
0·77–0·88 vs 0·73, 0·69–0·77, respectively) and from 1999 to 2006 (1·15, 0·91, 0·86–0·97 vs 0·79, 0·75–0·84). After 
adjusting for age, marital status, material deprivation history, smoking, drinking and socioeconomic status, working-
age men in fast-privatised towns experienced 13% higher mortality than in slow-privatised towns (95% CI 1–26).
Interpretation The rapid pace of privatisation was a significant factor in the marked increase in working-age male 
mortality in post-Soviet Russia. By providing compelling evidence in support of the health benefits of a slower pace of 
privatisation, this study can assist policy makers in making informed decisions about the speed and scope of 
government interventions.

Introduction
The period from 1990 to 1995 in the newly independent 
post-Soviet states was marked by an estimated extra 
7 million premature deaths, 4 million in Russia alone.1 
Many of these deaths were due to external causes and 
cardiovascular diseases.2 The group most affected by this 
rapidly increasing mortality was working-age men.3 
There is extensive work documenting the importance of 
alcohol, unstable employment, and stress4–7 as proximal 
determinants. However, the upstream determinants are 
less well understood, yet crucially important to inform 
policy makers in future periods of rapid political and 
economic transition.8 One of the central pillars of the 
post-communist transition has been privatisation.9
Stuckler and colleagues10 reported a cross-national 
association between extremely fast and extensive 
privatisation 
(so-called 
mass 
privatisation) 
with 
higher working-age male mortality, suggesting that 
unemployment was a primary mechanism linking 
privatisation and premature deaths. While it is well known 
that state enterprises hoarded an excessive and often 
ineffective labour force during the Soviet era, resisting 
massive layoffs during the post-communist crisis probably 
indirectly affected public health. Being employed, at least 
part-time, or even nominally, provided people with 
minimal security and gave them the feeling of being in 
control of their lives. Unemployment and related stress 
led to a hitherto unseen drop in life expectancy.11

Another possible explanation for the effects of 
privatisation on health could be the fact that before 
reforms, large state enterprises offered a wide range of 
social benefits to employees and their families. This was 
especially the case for city-forming enterprises that bore 
substantial responsibilities for the day-to-day wellbeing 
of their employees by providing company housing, 
health care, catering, day care, and holiday recreation.12–14 
When these enterprises were privatised, such provisions 
ceased. 
Usually, 
in 
transition 
economies 
these 
responsibilities were taken over by municipal and local 
administrative divisions, but due to serious budget 
deficits, these organisations were unable to provide 
adequate quality and scope of social services.15 The loss of 
health services can affect directly population health. 
However, the loss of social services, as well as the 
uncertainty created by privatisation, could increase levels 
of stress and associated risky behaviours like excessive 
drinking, which is a well documented cause of increased 
post-communist male mortality.16 It is estimated that as 
much as 30% of overall male mortality in Russia is 
accounted for by excessive drinking, and even more in 
working ages.4,17 King and colleagues18 recorded a cross-
national association between mass privatisation, reduced 
health-care resources, unemployment and stress-related 
outcomes like alcohol consumption, suicides, ischaemic 
heart disease, and homicide.
Finally, extremely fast and extensive privatisation 
could be linked to poor health outcomes by damaging 
firm performance and state capacity. Findings of cross-
national time-series analysis, cross-sectional firm-level 
regressions, and case studies15,19 show that at the 
micro-level, 
mass 
privatisated 
firms 
experienced 
reduced 
innovation, 
employed 
fewer 
employees, 
lowered economic output, and paid fewer taxes. At the 
macro-level, mass privatisation was associated with 
substantially lower economic growth and poorer state 
performance.20,21
While national-level studies can plausibly test macro-
mechanisms, critics have noted potential limitations 
such as omitted variable bias and ecological fallacy (ie, 
when the factors associated with group-level mortality 
rates fail to be associated with individual-level 
mortality).22 The aim of this study was to assess the effect 
of rapid privatisation at the individual level with data 
collected via survey within the framework of the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We undertook an extensive analysis of the scientific literature 
on the effect of economic reforms on public health, morbidity, 
and mortality in post-communist Russia, and relevant 
electronic databases. We searched PubMed and Embase for 
reports published between 1990 and 2013, published in any 
language, with the following search terms: “mortality in Russia”, 
“working age mortality”, “male mortality”, “mortality and 
transition”, “privatization”, “alcohol”. We also searched our own 
extensive library of literature on mortality in the former 
communist countries of Europe. These data were highly 
heterogeneous and had limited utility as they were not suitable 
for linking the speed of privatisation in various settlements to 
individuals’ mortality. Meta-analysis of the effects of 
privatisation on the health of employees and populations does 
not permit drawing a pooled estimate, as most of the estimates 
apply to countries outside our focus. Evidence from 
post-communist countries on health outcomes of 
politico-economic transitions remains inconclusive, although 
available data suggest that adverse health outcomes could 
result from rising unemployment and stress levels associated 
with mass privatisation.
Added value of this study
Employing an innovative design, we were able to quantify and 
compare inequalities in all-cause mortality, caused by policy 
intervention, during the 1990s in the urban population of 
Russian mono-industrial towns. We clarify the uncertainty 
associated with the link between the pace of privatisation in the 
former Soviet Union and the increasing mortality. This study is 
unique in using individual-level data collected specifically to 
study the health effects of privatisation and thus fills gaps in the 
scientific literature. Methodological contribution includes the 
use of the propensity score matching method to isolate the 
effect of privatisation by closely matching the settlements for a 
prospective survey prior to collecting the data via survey. 
Indirect demographic techniques were used to show how 
mortality levels in Russia changed over time. We used the 
method of establishing a convenience cohort study, based on 
the Brass indirect method that surveys random population 
samples to collect data on deaths of respondents’ relatives, so 
as to estimate key population mortality parameters. Most 
studies focusing on this period examined macro data, while 
high-quality data on the level of individuals remain scarce. Even 
though the design of the study was dictated by the need to test 
the privatisation thesis, a large new empirical base provides rich 
data for individual-level health risk analysis.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings contribute to an emerging specialty at the 
intersection of comparative political economy and public 
health, and provide an evidence base for the public and 
scholarly debate on the effect of privatisation on public health. 
Our multi-level work contributes to the methodological 
literature, offering a concrete example of how to study the 
effects of structural socioeconomic changes and individual-level 
factors on population health. This new research tradition 
extends the social determinants of morbidity and mortality 
research programme by linking it to specific political and 
economic policies and processes. Findings are also relevant for 
policy makers considering similar interventions in post-
communist societies and beyond.

Methods
Study design
The PrivMort project23 was designed to retrieve 
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 
individuals indirectly via surviving relatives. The 
method, developed by William Brass, was originally 
designed to estimate rates of vital events (births and 
deaths in countries with low literacy and numeracy). 
Because the information about relatives was not 
collected directly, it is often referred to as indirect 
estimation or the Brass technique after its developer. 
This information provides estimates of mortality rates 
that are acceptably representative of the underlying 
population.24,25 This approach is recommended by the 
UN for inclusion in censuses in such situations in which 
alternative official sources are not available26 and has 
been used successfully for analysing adult mortality 
differentials in Russia.27 There were no changes made to 
the previously published protocol.23 The full protocol 
describes the data collected in all towns that participated 
in the survey, while this study analyses the data from a 
smaller survey sample of towns. The remainder are 
five multi-industrial towns matched with five mono-
industrial towns. They are not well matched with the 
other towns and were selected to test a different set of 
hypotheses that will be reported elsewhere. These are 
therefore not studied in this article.
Study populations
Here we report analysis of data from 20 Russian towns 
whose economy is dominated by a single company. We 
selected mono-towns or towns of city-forming enterprise 
(monogoroda) because such settlements allow us to 
better isolate the effects of privatisation. Whereas some 
city-forming enterprises were fully privatised within 1 or 
2 years, in others more gradual privatisation strategies 
were adopted.
Following convention, we defined mono-industrial 
towns as settlements in which a single major enterprise 
employed more than 7·5% of total population, and the 
second largest enterprise had to be at least three times 
smaller in terms of its share in total employment in 1991. 
Every town had a population of between 5000 and 100 000 
in 1991. An extensive review of sources was undertaken 
to compile enterprise-level data.23 We then classified 
mono-towns into three groups: towns where the major 
enterprise had been privatised rapidly, transferring 90% 
or more of its shares in any 2 consecutive years between 
1992 and 1998; towns that adopted a more gradual 
approach in which less than 50% of shares were 
privatised in 2 consecutive years between 1992 and 1998, 
a period that provides sufficient time to account for any 
lagged effects of privatisation on mortality; and towns 
with a medium rate of privatisation (defined by 
privatisation of state shares of between 50% and 90%). 
We excluded towns with medium-pace privatisation to 
maximise the contrast in the speed of privatisation 
between the groups of firms. Future analysis using 
official gross mortality data and a larger sample of towns 
will allow us to perform an ecological analysis to assess 
whether there is a dose–response relationship between 
privatisation and mortality.
We chose a set of 20 mono-towns in west Russia, closely 
matched by initial conditions, so that ten towns that 
experienced fast privatisation (treatment group) were 
matched to ten that experienced gradual privatisation 
(control group). Interviews were performed between 
November, 2014, and March, 2015, by the Russian Agency 
for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM). The appendix 
lists the matched mono-industrial towns (appendix p 3). 
We used standard propensity score matching, logistic 
regression with no replacement, using the nearest 
neighbour approach. Every town in the treatment group 
was matched to a town in the control group with the 
closest score, so that a unit was selected only once, 
identifying the top ten pairs with closest propensity 
scores. We estimated conditional probabilities based on 
eight potential predictors of mortality, all measured for 
the pre-transition year, 1991, with the exception of wages, 
which were not available before 1992. We also used other 
matching algorithms such as trying alternative measures 
of the covariates (eg, number of hospital beds rather than 
number of physicians) and different distance measures 
(eg, Mahalanobis). The alternative methods explored 
produced 
town 
lists 
only 
marginally 
differing 
(ie, 1–2 towns changing), leading to the conclusion that 
the selected matching method is robust. The appendix 
shows these eight covariates across the matched towns 
(appendix p 4).
Study participants
In every settlement, 20 to 45 starting points were 
identified using a grid. Interviewers were instructed to 
launch the random walk procedure at a randomly 
assigned address within each cell selected, inviting 
face-to-face interviews at every fourth household. The 
respondents were asked to provide information about 
vital status, sociodemographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics and health-related behaviours of their 
parents, two eldest siblings (if eligible), and first 
husbands or long-term partners. Ethics approval was 
obtained from the University of Cambridge Department 
of Sociology ethics committee and ERC ethics advisers. 
The data were anonymised to prevent any potential 
identification of individual respondents.
Statistical analysis
We calculated indirect age-standardised mortality rates 
(SMR) in rapidly and slowly privatised towns and then, 
in multivariate analyses, calculated Poisson proportional

incidence rate ratios for men and women separately, with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and robust 
standard errors that control for heteroscedasticity, to 
estimate associations of relatives’ characteristics and 
speed of privatisation with the risk of death from all 
causes. Regression models were estimated with Stata 
(version 12.0).
The multivariate analysis focuses on the effect of the 
speed of privatisation on mortality of those of working age, 
who experienced the greatest increase in mortality during 
the post-communist transition.28 Relatives younger than 
20 years or older than 69 years in 1992, those who died 
before the beginning of the reforms (in 1991 or earlier) or 
did not have full information on education, marital status, 
professional occupation, material deprivation, alcohol 
drinking and smoking habits were excluded from the 
analysis. We also excluded those who were not residing in 
the 20 matched towns during privatisation, that is, for 
most of the 1990s. Work-related data were collected only on 
relatives who had not retired by 1992.

Results
Between 
November, 
2014, 
and 
March, 
2015, 
21 494 households were identified in 20 towns. In 
647 households, nobody could be contacted (after 
five visits), a further 5473 declined to be interviewed, and 
732 were unable to participate due to physical or mental 
impairment. Overall, 14 642 interviews were completed. 
After data cleaning, a sample was reduced to 13 932 valid 
interviews, with a 65% response rate. Information about 
38 339 relatives (21 634 men and 16 705 women) was 
collected. After exclusion criteria were applied, 19 167 were 
eligible for inclusion (12 086 men and 7081 women). 
Table 1 presents the availability of data for individuals in 
towns of each type and by sex. The distribution of 
people by vital status, education, occupation, and other 
characteristics in both types of town was similar.
Fast privatisation was strongly associated with higher 
working-age male mortality rates both between 1992 and 
1998 (age-standardised mortality ratio in men aged 
20–69 years in fast vs slow privatised towns: 1·13, 
SMR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77–0·88] vs 0·73 [0·69–0·77], 
respectively) and from 1999 to 2006 (1·15, 0·91, 
0·86–0·97 vs 0·79, 0·75–0·84). These preliminary results 
suggest that mortality rates were significantly higher in 
fast-privatised mono-industrial towns than in slow-
privatised mono-industrial towns both in 1992–1998 and 
1998–2006.
All towns except one in the sample initiated 
privatisation between 1992 and 1998, thus enabling us to 
test the privatisation hypothesis. Models 1 in table 2 and 
table 3 report age-adjusted incidence rate ratios, while 
models 2 and 3 include controls for sociodemographic 
and socioeconomic characteristics and health-related 
behaviours. As the towns were closely matched with 
respect to population size, dependency ratio, level of 
health provision, housing provision, pollution, initial

mortality rate, alcohol poisoning, and level of income, 
these town-level variables were not included in the 
models. We controlled for individual-level education, 
occupation, material deprivation in the 1990s, marital 
status, and frequency of drinking and smoking.
The incidence rate ratio for fast privatisation in the basic 
(age-adjusted) model 1 was 1·15 (95% CI 1·03–1·29) times 
higher than for the slow group for male relatives (table 2). 
In model 2 (main model), with controls for education and 
occupation, the incidence rate ratio was 1·17 (95% CI 
1·05–1·31) times higher for men. In the fully adjusted 
models 3, which additionally include variables measuring 
material deprivation, alcohol consumption, smoking 
and marital status, the association with privatisation is 
attenuated but remains important with mortality 
1·13 times higher (95% CI 1·01–1·26) in fast-privatised 
settlements, a similar estimate to that obtained in the 
comparison of SMRs. The model-predicted estimates 
of the mortality rates in fast privatisation and slow 
privatisation towns are 0·014 and 0·016, respectively. All 
control variables showed effects that were in the expected 
directions. We re-fitted the models 1–3 for both sexes on a 
dataset with imputed missing values using multivariable 
imputation via chained equations and the resulting 
coefficients were in line with those presented in table 4.
The findings in men changed little when we fitted our 
model with different, more conservative specifications. 
While the short-to-medium term effect of the rapid 
privatisation was captured in the main model, we 
explored long-term effect of privatisation on health and 
mortality in models based on the data for longer 
(1992–2006) and later (1999–2006) periods. In these 
models the effect of privatisation was significant in all 
specifications for men, and significant for women in a 
model covering the longer period (table 4). The 
magnitude of the privatisation effect was slightly larger 
than for 1992 to 1998 and significance levels were not 
changed. When we restricted the sample to cohorts of 
40 years and older, point estimates and significance levels 
were unaffected (table 4).
We also fitted a Poisson model in which we took into 
account the actual year of privatisation. Although most 
towns 
experienced 
privatisation 
in 
1993, 
some 
privatisation started in 1992. In this model we specified 
the start of exposure as the year of privatisation, and the 
end of exposure 5 years after the start of privatisation 
(table 4). Taking into account individuals’ occupation and 
educational level, the incidence rate ratio of living in a 
town with rapid privatisation in this specification for 
men was 1·21 (95% CI 1·08–1·37).
The findings were also robust when we used multi-
level regressions with town-level random effects. 
Incidence rate ratios for males from this model (1·17, 
95% CI 1·01–1·36) were very similar to the findings of 
the default models for men (table 4). The next two models 
analysed the mortality during the pre-intervention 
period: from 1985 to 1991. In these placebo analysis 
models (appendix p 10) mortality differentials between 
towns where the city-forming enterprise underwent slow 
or fast privatisation disappeared. As a final placebo 
analysis, we compared the relatives from fast and gradual 
privatised towns who did not live in those towns for a 
large part of the 1990s. There was no difference in the 
mortality rate between those groups (appendix p 10).
Results for women showed weaker effects, with sizes 
varying from 13 to 24 in most models but rarely reaching 
significance. Only in the model accounting for the actual 
year of privatisation was the female incidence rate ratio

The PrivMort project, to our knowledge, is the largest 
multi-level indirect retrospective cohort study to date 
done in the post-communist countries. We found clear 
differences in mortality in working-age men between 
towns where the city-forming enterprise underwent slow 
rather than fast privatisation. Working-age men in 
fast-privatised towns experienced 13% to 21% higher 
mortality than working-age men in slow-privatised

towns, depending on the specification or sample 
restrictions applied. Findings in women were broadly 
consistent but not significant, mainly due to the smaller 
number of deaths in women.
Our results are consistent with a previous cross-national 
study by Stuckler and colleagues,10 which noted that rapid 
privatisation was associated with a rise in male death rates. 
The magnitude of association in their findings,10 a 12·8% 
(95% CI 7·9–17·7) rise linked with introduction of mass 
privatisation was lower than in the present study (17%, 
95% CI 5–31). This finding is unsurprising in view of the 
different operationalisation of privatisation used in the 
study by Stuckler and colleagues.10 The greater estimate in 
this study is to be expected because the national-level 
finding estimates mortality in all towns and cities, both 
gradual and fast privatisers. Additionally, we were better 
able to isolate the effect of privatisation. Whereas in the 
previous study10 the percentage change in mortality ratio 
was adjusted for the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (EBRD) price liberalisation index, EBRD 
trade liberalisation index, the democratisation index, 
dummy for military or ethnic conflict, the percentage of 
urban population, dependency ratio, per capita log gross 
domestic product, and education level, here we adjusted 
for all of these characteristics and a wider set of variables. 
The first five covariates were accounted for by restricting 
the analysis to the urban population of a single country. 
The next two covariates were accounted for by matching 
towns on dependency ratio and average wage; additionally, 
we matched on other socioeconomic and demographic 
variables. Unlike the previous work,10 we were able to 
adjust for education on the level of individuals, not country 
level, which makes our estimates more precise.
Previous researchers have suggested that women have 
been able to cope with the post-Soviet transitions better 
than men.29 Although Russian women faced a double 
burden from participating in the labour market and 
taking care of their families,30,31 paradoxically this greater 
responsibility seems to have given their lives more 
meaning. It has also been suggested that, faced with 
unemployment, Russian men turned to cheap and easily 
available alcohol to seek compensation for their lost 
provider’s status,32 while heavy alcohol consumption was 
stigmatised among women.33
The indirect estimation technique we used adequately 
assesses overall mortality levels and differences in 
mortality between different socioeconomic subgroups, as 
findings of several large-scale studies in Russia have 
previously shown.16,34–36 In fact, the present study has 
several advantages common to indirect techniques of 
estimating mortality, mainly in terms of cost and time 
efficiency and ability to retrieve information about people 
usually unreachable by direct techniques. Additionally, the 
PrivMort study retrieved a broad range of socioeconomic 
and demographic information not otherwise available.
However, our study has limitations. First, the sample 
was not representative of the entire population of Russia

Data are incidence rate ratio (95% CI) or n. The coefficients give the hazard ratio of death in relation to an absolute change 
in the independent variable (privatisation speed). Relative hazard ratios are presented with 95% CIs based on robust 
(heteroscedasticity-corrected) standard errors. We report age-adjusted hazard ratios of death from Poisson models 
among cohorts aged 20–69 years, with covariates: individuals’ occupation, educational level. *Aged 40–69 years.

because we focused only on the urban population of 
industrial mono-enterprise towns in the European part 
of the country. Moreover, the fact that national statistics 
average across the whole population of Russia—
including the Muslim population with lower reported 
alcohol consumption37—makes it difficult to compare 
these figures with the sample of 20 towns that have a 
mainly Russian population. The total number of Muslims 
is estimated to be lower than 2·8 million, or less than 2% 
of Russia’s total population.38 Second, potential selection 
bias might have arisen from differentials in family-wise 
mortality levels: representatives from high-mortality 
families were less likely to have participated in the survey 
because a higher proportion would not survive until the 
interview date, making such families less likely to be 
captured by the sampling, and pass the screening criteria 
for the interviews, which require respondents’ relatives 
to reside in the settlements in question. However, 
research by Murphy and colleagues27 suggests that this is 
not likely to bias the mortality estimates. Third, as those 
who emigrated away from the 20 settlements were 
excluded from the study, future investigations should 
look into the migrant differentials at settlement level. 
Possible bias might arise from out-migration from fast 
privatisation towns; however, this could both overestimate 
and underestimate the effect of the speed of privatisation. 
If healthy people left a fast privatisation town, this could 
introduce an upward bias, if families who lost their 
fathers (ie, the main earners) left the town, this would 
contribute to underestimation of the effect of privatisation 
on mortality.
The fourth concern relates to temporal inconsistency 
of the recorded individual characteristics and mortality 
outcomes. While individual characteristics such as 
education, marital status, alcohol consumption, and 
smoking were recoded at the time of death for decedents 
(between 1992 and 1998), for surviving relatives these 
characteristics were collected at time of the interview and 
at the time of death for those who died after 1998, which 
might be as late as 2015. However, because we were only 
studying relatives aged 20 years and older, and, in view of 
low transition rates to higher education for adults in 
Russia, education status is unlikely to change. Marital 
status and alcohol and tobacco use might have changed 
between the exposure period and the date of interview, 
hence the result of the full models 3 must be treated with 
caution. Finally, there were potential problems in 
accurately recalling events that happened 20–25 years 
ago; this can potentially bias the estimates of frequency 
of drinking and smoking, education, and frequency of 
communication 
for 
relatives. 
Anticipating 
this, 
interviewers were instructed to introduce auxiliary 
sentences and memory cards to facilitate accurate recall 
and obtain accurate estimates of characteristics and 
behaviours of their relatives. However, for all five of these 
biases, there was no reason to think they would vary with 
the speed of privatisation in the settlements.
The method of isolating the effect of privatisation by 
closely matching the settlements before collecting the 
data also entails certain limitations. We deployed 
propensity score matching on baseline covariates that are 
most important to health outcomes, but one could argue 
that fast-privatised towns are systematically different 
from slow-privatised towns in some other ways. A 
systematic literature review of the causes of privatisation15 
showed that the main determinants of privatisation were 
political, not underlying economic weakness or social 
conditions. The political choice of the speed of 
privatisation was made on the level of enterprises or local 
and regional authorities, thus it can be claimed that it 
was probably orthogonal to mortality outcomes.
Clearly, there are several factors contributing to excess 
mortality in Russia, acting at different points along 
several causal pathways, with alcohol playing a key role 
in several, including that related to speed of privatisation. 
In a study by Walberg and colleagues5 that reported an 
association between labour turnover in Russian regions, 
itself linked with privatisation, researchers noted that 
much of the excess mortality was alcohol-related. 
Treisman39 invoked the fall in alcohol prices from 
1990 to 1994 as the primary determinant of increased 
mortality during the 1990s. Treisman’s measure of price 
was based on the cost of vodka in the capital city of each 
of Russia’s regions. There were no data available for 
alcohol prices at the settlement level that would allow us 
to directly test this hypothesis. Another possible 
component of several causal pathways involves social 
protection. Increased mortality could be related to 
variations in the provision of social benefits at the 
settlement level. However, local expenditures are strongly 
dependent on the health of city-forming enterprises.15 
Similarly, mortality could be related to sector or 
firm-specific characteristics, possibly operating through 
lower wages. However, without data for these variables, 
we cannot test all possible causal pathways.
It is essential to recognise that the health effects of 
transition 
were 
complex 
and 
defy 
mono-causal 
explanation. We do not claim that mass privatisation was 
the only cause of increased mortality. In fact, it would be 
remarkable if one single policy or factor explained all the 
variation in the post-communist mortality crisis. We 
believe our findings provide strong evidence for the 
hypothesis that rapid privatisation contributed to raised 
working-age male mortality. Importantly, the findings of 
this study complement the epidemiological and public 
health explanations linking alcohol consumption and 
psychological stress to the Russian mortality crisis of 
1992 to 1998,40 identifying rapid privatisation as an 
important underlying cause. Regression coefficients for 
fast privatisation were consistently positive and significant 
for men, but usually not significant for women. 
Robustness checks did not significantly change the 
magnitude or the direction of the covariates of mortality. 
This study adds to previous, less conclusive findings on
