Abstract
The timing, intensity, and duration of exposure to both artificial and natural light have acute
metabolic and physiological effects in mammals. Recent research in human adults sug-
gests exposure to moderate intensity light later in the day is concurrently associated with
increased body mass; however, no studies have investigated the effect of light exposure on
body mass in young children. We examined objectively measured light exposure and body
mass of 48 preschool-aged children at baseline, and measured their body mass again 12
months later. At baseline, moderate intensity light exposure earlier in the day was associ-
ated with increased body mass index (BMI). Increased duration of light exposure at baseline
predicted increased BMI 12-months later, even after controlling for baseline sleep duration,
sleep timing, BMI, and activity. The findings identify that light exposure may be a contributor
to the obesogenic environment during early childhood.
Introduction
The contemporary child is exposed to greater daily duration and increased variation in inten-
sity, temporal distribution, and spectra of environmental light, than children of any previous
generation [1]. This is attributable to the use of artificial lighting, and has paralleled global
increases in the incidence of obesity [1, 2]. Coupled with the known physiological impacts of
light on human physiology, this raises a question; is light a factor in pediatric obesity?
It is estimated that 42 million children under the age of 5-years are classified as overweight
or obese globally [3], including 23% of children in developed countries [4]. This is a significant
clinical, public, and population health concern, as pediatric obesity is associated with a multi-
tude of negative psychosocial and health sequela. Potential mechanisms that might be driving
the global increase in obesity include increased calorie intake, decreased physical activity, and
more recently, short sleep duration [5, 6], variable sleep timing [7], and gut flora [8]. However,
attempts to address these factors have not, as yet, led to effective and sustained change in the
prevalence and incidence of obesity [4]. Therefore, significant efforts are being made to identify

 modifiable factors that contribute to weight gain and that constitute the obesogenic environ-
ment. Recent evidence suggests that environmental light exposure may be one such factor.
Light is the principal cue for circadian entrainment in all species [9]. Circadian processes
drive physiological and behavioral mechanisms including sleep-wake cycles [10], regulation of
metabolism [11–13], emotion [14], and body mass [15–17]. Through the adoption and use of
artificial lighting, humans have constructed a photoperiod that is malleable, creating an envi-
ronment of relatively dim days and bright nights [1, 18]. Manipulation of the timing, intensity,
and duration of light exposure to suit contemporary lifestyles has occurred with limited consid-
eration of its effects on health, behavioral, and environmental outcomes. An understanding of
these effects is only now beginning to emerge [1, 14, 18, 19].
Animal studies indicate that the timing and intensity of light exposure is critical for meta-
bolic functioning and weight status. Rodents exposed to continuous white light, even at low
levels, exhibited symptoms of metabolic syndrome, increased adiposity, glucose intolerance
[20, 21], and reduced sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue [22], independent of their
caloric intake and locomotor activity. Many of these symptoms are abolished when regular
light-dark cycles are reinstated [23]. Furthermore, studies of the natural environment indicate
that increased artificial light at night, both through direct illumination (e.g. structural, security,
street, and advertising lighting) and skyglow, affect the reproductive, migrative, and daily
movement behaviors of multiple plant and animal populations [18, 24–26]. The cost of these
changes are not yet fully understood. In adult humans, morning bright light treatment has
been shown to reduce body fat and appetite [27, 28], improve mood [27], and modulate con-
centrations of the appetite regulating hormones; leptin and ghrelin [29]. Commensurately,
recent evidence shows that exposure to light of moderate intensity (~500 lux) earlier in the
day is associated with lower body mass, independent of sleep timing, total sleep duration, and
activity in adults [17]. Taken together, these data indicate that the timing, duration and inten-
sity of light exposure has a potent role in metabolic and physiological functioning. Early child-
hood is a pivotal time in the establishment of lifelong growth and adiposity trajectories [30].
However, to date, no studies have examined the effect of habitual light exposure on body mass
in children.
The present study investigated the relationship between timing, duration, and intensity of
light exposure and weight status of healthy, free-living children aged 3 to 5 years, both concur-
rently and longitudinally. Standardized independent measurements of body mass index (BMI;
kg/cm2) were taken for all participating children at both time points. BMI measurements were
transformed into age- and sex-specific BMI z scores for each child [31]. It was hypothesized
that, independent of sleep midpoint (used as a proxy for sleep timing and circadian phase;
[32]), sleep duration and activity, timing and intensity of light exposure (earlier in the day)
would be associated with lower concurrent BMI z score. Further, it was hypothesized that tim-
ing of light exposure at baseline, would be associated with BMI z score 12-months later.

Study Design
Initially, 62 healthy pre-school children (32 Males (51.6%); M = 56.51 months, SD = 5.94, and
Age Range: 39.0–74.0 months) were recruited for the 12 month study, from six long-day child

 care services in Brisbane, a capital city in subtropical Australia. Participating child care services
were recruited from a pool of 118 services participating in a pre-existing study [33]. All services
were located in high socio-economic status (SES) areas according to postcode (SEIFA [34])
and were randomly selected to be approached to take part in the study. Lower SES is associated
with a range of sociodemographic factors which may impact upon child health and develop-
ment [35–37], as such services in high SES areas were specifically targeted in the study design
to control for some of these variations. Within each childcare service, one room catering for
children within the preschool age range (3–5 years) was targeted for recruitment. All children
attending the target rooms were invited to participate in the study. To avoid school holiday
periods, the 14th of December, 2012 (final date of the school term in Queensland, Australia)
was the predefined study endpoint.
At baseline participating families were sent a 14-day sleep diary, parent survey and Acti-
watch 2 (MiniMitter Phillips) device. Actigraphs were worn by the study child on the non-
dominant wrist for 14 days. The sleep diary was completed concurrently by parents who were
asked to record their child’s sleep and wake times, napping behaviour and any instances which
the actigraph was removed from the child’s wrist. The parent survey included demographic
information and an 8-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which asked parents to indi-
cate, “In the last 24 hours, how often has the study child had the following foods?” with the
following trichotomous responses available “Not at all,” “Once,” or “More than once” [38].
Within the 14-day testing period, researchers visited each participating pre-school classrooms
on the same designated testing day each week (i.e. Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday).
Researchers observed the childcare routine and environment, including sleep practices and
behaviours, and on one visit measured each participant’s height and weight. The baseline mea-
surements were conducted in the Australian spring/summer between October and December,
2012. During this period, in Brisbane, Queensland (study location) the average sunrise
occurred at 4:55am and sunset occurred at 6:17pm.
Participating families were then contacted to participate again 12 months later (follow-up).
Accordingly, the follow-up period was between October and December, 2013. All participating
families were sent a parent survey and a researcher visited the family to collect the child’s
height and weight measurements.
At baseline, complete data was obtained for 49 (79.03%) children. One participant was
excluded due to insufficient actigraphy data (< 2 days), giving a final sample of 48 children at
baseline. Of the 48 children who completed the baseline measurements, 9 children did not
complete the follow-up BMI measurements, giving an attrition rate of 18.75%. No differences
were found between those participants who did and did not complete the study at either time
point, for gender, age or BMI.
Measurement of light, activity and sleep
The Actiwatch devices measured children’s motor activity (range: 0.5–2G) and white light
luminance exposure (range: 5–100,000 lux) in 1 minute epochs for 14 days. The Actiwatch 2
has been calibrated to the international standard ISO-10526 (CIE-S-005) and has been shown
to measure illuminance of multiple white light sources in agreement with a National Institute
of Standards in Technology (NIST)-traceable photometer [39]. Rest/sleep intervals were
assessed by parent reported sleep diaries and wrist actigraphy, using Actiware 5.2 software
(Phillips Respironics, Bend, Oregon 97701 USA). Sleep onset, offset and duration were deter-
mined using the parent-reported sleep diary in conjunction with the actigraphy data. Sleep
onset was determined by using the exact diary time indicated by the parent; unless the time
indicated fell on an epoch determined as “sleep” (S) by actigraphy then, sleep onset was

 operationalized as the last “wake” (W) epoch before the first 3 consecutive S epochs. Sleep off-
set was determined by using the exact diary time indicated by the parent; unless the time indi-
cated fell on an epoch determined as S then, the time was extended until the first W epoch,
after the last 5 consecutive S epochs. Data were cleaned using the Actiware 5.2 software which
involved excluding periods in which the parent indicated that the actigraph was removed from
the child’s wrist. Total sleep duration was calculated based on the mean duration of all sleep
periods (day and night) over the 14-day period. Sleep midpoint was calculated based on the
average of sleep onset and offset for the 14-day period. Sleep midpoint was used as a proxy for
circadian phase [32]. For a conservative estimate of children’s motor activity and light expo-
sure, any extended inactive periods (>5mins), not recorded by the parents in the sleep diary,
were excluded.
Light and activity analysis
Intensity, duration and timing of exposure to light were determined by using a similar method-
ology to that described by Reid and colleagues [17]. Light and activity data were collected and
exported from Actiware 5.2 software in .csv format at a 1-minute (epoch) resolution. Data was
imported into RProject 2.11.1. and smoothed using a 5-minute rolling average (to account for
the finer measurement window used compared to Reid and colleagues) [17], and then aggre-
gated over 24-hours for each participant. Any 24-hour periods with greater than 4 hours of
excluded data were considered invalid and subsequently excluded from further analyses. These
aggregate data allowed the calculation of time above threshold (TAT), and mean light timing
above threshold (MLiT) [17]. TAT is the average daily number of minutes (epochs) spent
above a given lux threshold. This captures both, intensity and duration of light exposure. TAT
intensity thresholds ranged from 10 to 3000 lux. MLiT [17] describes the daily distribution of
light exposure. Calculation of MLiT incorporates intensity (lux threshold), duration (number
of minutes above a threshold), and timing of exposure (clock time of each minute above the
threshold; 10 to 3000 lux). The formula used to calculate MLIT was produced by Reid and col-
leagues [17], however in this study j (minute of day) = 1, . . ., 1440, as light exposure (lux) was
measured at a resolution of 1 minute epochs for 24 hours (24 x 60 = 1440mins). Also, k (day) =
1, . . ., 14, as the children in this study wore the Actiwatch for 14 days. To illustrate, throughout
24-hours across a 14 day period, a MLiT200 of 721minutes indicates that the child’s light expo-
sure above 200 lux was, on average, centred around 12pm (or the 721st minute in the 1440 min-
ute day from 12am). Representative examples of individual light profiles of participating
children are illustrated in Fig 1. The measure of activity used in this analysis was the mean of
each epoch of activity over 24 hours, across the 14 days of recording.
BMI analysis
At both baseline and follow-up, height and weight were measured by trained researchers using
calibrated stadiometers (SECA Leicester Portable Height Measure) and floor scales (HD-316,
Wedderburn Scales; Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with subjects dressed in light clothing,
and without shoes. Children were measured twice and if measurements differed (weight
>0.1kg; height >0.5cm) a third measurement was taken by the researcher. The mean of the
measurements were used. Due to the high proportion of this sample being breast-fed at some
point during infancy (88.4%) and no significant developmental delays identified, the WHO
growth charts were utilised to calculate BMI and growth trajectories of the children [31]. BMI
measurements were transformed into sex- and age-specific z scores using the WHO Anthro
version 3.2.2 and AnthroPlus version 1.0.4.

 Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 22.0.0.0. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to
examine if any light variables were associated with BMI z score, both at baseline and follow-up.
Consistent with the procedures used by Reid et al. [17], the light exposure variables with the
highest correlation with BMI z score were then used in all subsequent analyses. Bivariate corre-
lations (Tables A and B in S1 File) were run to examine the association between BMI z score at
baseline and at follow-up with sleep midpoint, sleep duration, activity, diet variables, and the
24hr light variables identified in sensitivity analysis: TAT and MLiT. Sleep midpoint was not
normally distributed so a log-linear transformation was conducted. Subsequently, all analyses
shown include the log transformed sleep midpoint variable. Nutrition variables were available
for a subset of children (n = 42). There was limited variability in parent reporting of nutritional
intake. Furthermore, none of the nutritional intake items correlated with either BMI z score
(baseline/follow-up) or the light variables. As such the nutritional items were not included
within the final regression analyses. Multivariable linear regression models were then used to
assess the relationships between BMI z score at baseline with activity, sleep midpoint, and sleep
duration and the TAT and MLiT thresholds identified through bivariate correlations. To assess
the relationship between light at baseline and BMI z score at follow-up another multivariable
linear regression was conducted, adjusting for baseline measures of BMI z score, activity, sleep
midpoint and sleep duration. Significance levels are indicated with asterisks: �p < 0.05;
��p < 0.01; ���p < 0.001.
Results
Participant demographics
Participant demographic, BMI, BMI z score, sleep, activity and light characteristics for both
baseline and follow-up are described in Table 1. At baseline, the average age of participating
children was 4.76 years (SD = 4.94 months), with 52.1% of the sample being female. According
to WHO percentiles 97.9% of participants were classified as within the healthy weight range,
with one participant being classified as overweight/obese [31]. None of the participating chil-
dren were classified as underweight, at either time point, in this study. Parents of the participat-
ing children predominantly identified themselves as Australian (67%). Please refer to Table C
in S1 File for further information regarding identified ethnic group. Valid actigraphy recording
ranged from 3–13 days (M = 10.7 days). The average sleep onset time was 20:37 (SD = 00:39),
sleep offset was 06:03 (SD = 00:36), sleep midpoint was 01:19 (SD = 00:34), and total sleep
duration was 9.64 hours (SD = 31.19 minutes). MLiT200 centered on 12:37 (SD = 00:36) with a
range from 11:10 to 14:28. The average duration of time that participating children spent in

 light above the 200 lux threshold was 3.43 hours (SD = 7.06 minutes). In comparison, children
spent 64 minutes (SD = 25.22 mins) above the 2500 lux threshold. At follow-up, the mean age
of participants was 5.74 years (SD = 5.12 months) and 51.3% of the sample were female. The
majority of children (92.3%) were classified as normal weight, two children (5.1%) classified as
overweight and one child (2.6%) classified as obese [31].
Light exposure profiles and baseline BMI z score
To determine which 24-hour light variables (MLiT/TAT), across the thresholds of 10–3000 lux
had the strongest association with baseline BMI z score, sensitivity analyses were conducted
(Fig 2A and 2B). TAT2500 was identified as having the strongest association with baseline BMI
z score. This association was positive, indicating that longer daily duration of light exposure
above a threshold of 2500 lux was associated with higher BMI. This illuminance level would be
equivalent to outdoor lighting on an overcast day [40, 41]. MLiT was also significantly associ-
ated with baseline BMI z score, with the strongest association occurring at MLiT200. Earlier
light exposure above a threshold of 200 lux (MLiT200) was associated with higher BMI.

 Representations of early and later MLiT200 are illustrated in Fig 3. Illumination of 200 lux is
approximate to a typical home living room or kitchen [42].
To determine the effect of duration and timing of light exposure on BMI z score, a hierar-
chical multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. Specifically, we examined the
effect of TAT2500 and MLiT200 on BMI z score, after adjusting for activity, total sleep duration,
and sleep midpoint (Table 2). The full model accounted for 27.3% of the variance in baseline
BMI z-score (F5,42 = 3.153, p = .017, r2 = 0.273). In this model, later sleep midpoint was associ-
ated with increased BMI z score (β = .363, p = .020). Although TAT2500 was correlated with

association at TAT10 (N = 39).

 BMI z score, it was not a significant independent predictor when entered into the model. How-
ever, MLiT200 did have a significant, independent effect on BMI z score (β = -.419, p = .01).
This result indicates that earlier exposure to moderate intensity light is associated with
increased concurrent BMI z score in preschool children, independent of activity, total sleep
duration, and sleep midpoint.
Light exposure at baseline predicts 12-month follow-up BMI z score
After examining the association between light exposure and BMI z score at baseline, we wanted
to determine if baseline light exposure would predict BMI z score 12-months later. We con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis to establish if any of the light variables at baseline had an associa-
tion with BMI z score at follow-up, across each threshold (10–3000 lux). No baseline MLiT
variables were associated with BMI z scores at follow-up. However, both TAT10 and TAT25
had a positive association with BMI z score at follow-up (Fig 2C), with the strongest association
found for TAT10. Illumination of 10 lux is approximate to a candlelit room.

 To test the hypothesis that baseline light exposure predicts BMI z score at follow-up (N = 39
children), a hierarchical multivariable regression analysis was conducted. This model was
adjusted for baseline measurements of BMI z score, activity, sleep midpoint and total sleep
duration (Table 2). The model significantly predicted a striking 59% of the variance in BMI z
score at follow-up (F5,34 = 9.501, p < .001). Even after adjusting for baseline BMI z-score (β =
.621, p < .001), TAT10 remained a significant and independent predictor (β = .400, p = .002) of
BMI z score 12-months later. This result indicates that longer daily duration of light exposure
greater than 10 lux at baseline is associated with increased BMI 12-months later, independent
of baseline BMI, activity, sleep midpoint and total sleep duration.
Discussion
This study is the first to investigate the relationship between the timing, duration, and intensity
of light exposure and the body mass of young children. We found that daily environmental
light exposure had a significant association with the children’s body mass, both concurrently
and longitudinally. Our findings are consistent with those from studies conducted with animal
models, and in adult humans, which indicate that variations in light exposure may influence
body mass [17, 20–22, 27]. In the current study, earlier exposure to moderate levels of light was
associated with higher concurrent BMI. In clinical terms, for every hour earlier that MLiT200
occurred during the day, there was a .6 unit increase in BMI. While this degree of body mass
gain may seem modest, it could indicate an early deviation in a lifelong body mass trajectory.
The direction of this relationship contrasts with those reported for adults, where earlier light
exposure was found to be associated with decreased body mass [17]. The difference in the
direction of these findings may reflect variations in biological timing and threshold of exposure
at which light exerts an influence on physiological processes in young children. Consistent
with this interpretation, a recent study indicated that adolescents have a heightened sensitivity

baseline was not predictive of BMI 12-months later, the duration of light exposure was. Specifi-
cally, longer duration of total light exposure at baseline was predictive of higher BMI at follow-
up. The increased use of electronic equipment such as night lights, tablets, mobile phones, and
televisions has been well-documented for children 3–5 years [44, 45]. The current result may
help us to better understand findings of an association between this increased duration of
screen use and light in the bedroom and body mass in children.
Our findings provide evidence consistent with profound metabolic and physiological effects
of light on the human body [18, 19, 46–49]. These results are especially striking when we con-
sider that BMI in the first five years of life is predictive of life-long body mass trajectories [30].
Unlike activity, dietary intake, and sleep duration, light exposure is easily and directly manipu-
lated; literally through the flick of the switch. The current ubiquitous social, industrial, and cul-
turally driven manipulation of our environmental light may impact on body mass through
three very broad mechanisms that warrant exploration. Firstly, increased light duration may
provide insufficient dark, and insufficient metabolic ‘down time’, for normal recuperative pro-
cesses to occur. Indeed, depending on geographical location, skyglow and other artificial light
at night sources are increasing at rates of up to 20% per year [50]. Children are increasingly
exposed to broader spectral signatures and more diverse intensity profiles of light [51]. Sec-
ondly, chronically increased daily light duration may provide a biological signal analogous to
endless summer days, with the potential to amplify any seasonally-driven metabolic processes,
such as body mass acquisition [52, 53]. Alternatively, a child’s initial light state may promote
some mediating phenomena such as problematic behavior, physiological or metabolic changes,
which in turn, promote changes in BMI. One example of light states interacting with physio-
logical behavior is in the case of sleep. Multiple studies document an association between short
sleep duration and variability in sleep timing with increased body mass in pediatric populations
[5–7]. Thus, a confounding relationship between sleep and light exposure is expected as sleep
timing and duration likely to influence the timing and duration of light exposure. In this study
sleep duration was not associated with either BMI or light exposure variables at either time
point. Although surprising, this finding is consistent with some research conducted in the early
childhood period [54, 55]. Furthermore, the null findings may also be explained by our use of
ambulatory recording versus parent report methods used commonly in research reporting an
association between sleep and body mass in children (see review [56]). However, it is noted
that sleep midpoint was associated with timing of light exposure in this study. Further, in our
model, later sleep midpoint was a significant independent predictor of increased BMI z-score.
This indicates that timing of sleep and light exposure may be interacting to influence body
mass of children.
There are limitations to our study. We have not measured the spectral signatures to which
children are exposed, instead measuring light objectively in ambient lux (lumens/m2, weighted
to human perception of brightness) [57]. Throughout the day, wavelength composition varies
and studies have shown that spectral variations have very distinct impacts on different circa-
dian, behavioral and physiological responses [58]. As such, it is recommended that future stud-
ies use devices that measure spectral power distribution, such as spectroradiometers [59].
Direct measurements of circadian phase and metabolic hormones were not determined in this
study. Future work should include measurement of circadian phase and metabolic hormone
variation of children to provide tests of the direct or indirect path of associations found
between light and body mass. For example, timing of light exposure has been shown to affect
expression of melatonin and shift circadian phase [59, 60], which in turn impacts on hormones
such as insulin [12, 61]. Additionally, the light intensities shown to be significantly associated
with body mass in this study need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of children. It is noted

 that in this study, body mass was treated as a continuum, with only a small number of children
classified in the clinical range for overweight and obesity. As such future research could investi-
gate this association using children in the clinical range for overweight and obesity. Although
BMI has been shown to have good agreement with body composition in children [62], future
studies could consider the use of other estimates of adiposity including; skin fold thickness,
waist circumference, or dual energy x-ray. Further research is needed to address these issues as
well as the mechanisms responsible for the association between light exposure and body mass
in children.
We live in a society of relatively dim days and bright nights [1, 16]. The findings of this
study suggest biologically inappropriately timed light exposure and ‘longer’ light periods, may
be problematic for body mass of children. If light is in fact a meaningful and distinct contribu-
tor to body mass and weight gain, then quantification of light exposure could be included in
clinical assessment protocols, and even used routinely in pediatric assessments concerned with
incipient obesity. Furthermore, clinical prescription of ‘dark time', analogous to current light
therapies, could restitute a state of shorter, brighter days and longer dark nights, with resultant
increases in the amplitude of a child’s natural circadian rhythm. Indeed, inexpensive con-
sumer-grade wearables already collect similar data to that provided by actigraphy, and individ-
ual tracking of habitual activity, sleep-wake patterns, and light exposure, is already possible.
The rapid acceptance and uptake of these devices increases the potential for future effective
and well-evaluated public health interventions around light exposure. Likewise, ‘smart house’
applications already allow control of artificial lighting in the home, school, and childcare
environments, and provide another potential point for intervention with public health implica-
tions. By customizing our light environment, we have launched a global naturalistic experi-
ment, the effects of which are only just beginning to emerge. Our data provides an impetus to
investigate environmental light as a factor in the obesogenic environment during human devel-
opment. This may reveal new targets for pediatric obesity intervention and prevention.
