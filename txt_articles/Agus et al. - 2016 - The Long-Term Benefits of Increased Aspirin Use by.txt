Abstract
Background
The usefulness of aspirin to defend against cardiovascular disease in both primary and sec-
ondary settings is well recognized by the medical profession. Multiple studies also have
found that daily aspirin significantly reduces cancer incidence and mortality. Despite these
proven health benefits, aspirin use remains low among populations targeted by cardiovas-
cular prevention guidelines. This article seeks to determine the long-term economic and
population-health impact of broader use of aspirin by older Americans at higher risk for car-
diovascular disease.
Methods and Findings
We employ the Future Elderly Model, a dynamic microsimulation that follows Americans
aged 50 and older, to project their lifetime health and spending under the status quo and in
various scenarios of expanded aspirin use. The model is based primarily on data from the
Health and Retirement Study, a large, representative, national survey that has been ongoing
for more than two decades. Outcomes are chosen to provide a broad perspective of the indi-
vidual and societal impacts of the interventions and include: heart disease, stroke, cancer,
life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and medical
costs. Eligibility for increased aspirin use in simulations is based on the 2011–2012 ques-
tionnaire on preventive aspirin use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
These data reveal a large unmet need for daily aspirin, with over 40% of men and 10% of
women aged 50 to 79 presenting high cardiovascular risk but not taking aspirin. We estimate
that increased use by high-risk older Americans would improve national life expectancy at
age 50 by 0.28 years (95% CI 0.08–0.50) and would add 900,000 people (95% CI 300,000–
1,400,000) to the American population by 2036. After valuing the quality-adjusted life-years
appropriately, Americans could expect $692 billion (95% CI 345–975) in net health benefits
over that period.

 Conclusions
Expanded use of aspirin by older Americans with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease
could generate substantial population health benefits over the next twenty years and do so
very cost-effectively.
1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, is the leading cause of death in the
United States and a significant driver of health-care spending [1, 2]. The usefulness of aspirin
to prevent cardiovascular disease is well recognized. Since the early 2000s, the US Preventive
Services Task Force and the American Heart Association (AHA) have recommended aspirin
for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [3–8]. Despite these long-
standing guidelines, aspirin use remains low. A survey on preventive low-dose aspirin use was
conducted by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2011–2012 [9]. Using
these data, we estimate that less than half the men and women eligible for daily aspirin actually
use the medication.
The role of aspirin in primary cancer prevention is less settled but becoming clearer. Grow-
ing evidence suggests that daily long-term aspirin use plays a significant preventive role for
colorectal [5, 10] and other cancers [11].
Daily aspirin appears to have tremendous potential to hit the triple aim of better care, better
health, and smarter spending. To quantify that potential, this article seeks to determine the
long-term economic and population-health impact of full guideline adherence, though simula-
tions using the Future Elderly Model (FEM), an established, dynamic microsimulation that
follows Americans aged 50 and older.
2. Methods
2.1 The Future Elderly Model
We conduct simulations using the FEM, a dynamic microsimulation developed by Goldman
et al. to forecast the implications of different medical-technology scenarios on long-term
health and health-care spending [12]. FEM follows Americans aged 50 and older and projects
their health and medical spending over time. Its unique feature is to follow the evolution of
individual-level health trajectories rather than average or aggregate characteristics of a cohort.
In the recent past, researchers have used FEM for a variety of purposes, including forecasting
the changing health status of the elderly Medicare population in the decades 2010–2030 [13];
estimating the impact of the introduction of statin medication on the costs of obesity [14]; and
estimating the value of medical interventions to reduce obesity prevalence [15], delay Alzhei-
mer’s disease [16], and delay the biology of aging [17, 18].
FEM simulates the lives of older Americans using the biennial Health and Retirement
Study of Americans aged 51 and over; the large-scale Medical Expenditure Panel Survey of the
noninstitutionalized US population; and the nationally representative Medicare Current Bene-
ficiary Survey. These sources are used to compute the health-transition models at the core of
FEM, project health-care spending, and assess quality of life during the simulations. We
describe the model and methods briefly here; complete technical information is available in S1
File online.

 FEM has three core modules. The first, Health Transitions, calculates transition probabili-
ties across various health states based on the individual’s current characteristics. Health transi-
tions include chronic disease incidence, functional status, body mass index, and mortality.
These transition probabilities are modeled using first-order Markov processes that depend on
a battery of predictors, such as age, sex, education, race, and health conditions.
Health conditions are derived from Health and Retirement Study survey questions. We
treat chronic conditions as absorbing—once individuals receive a diagnosis, they are hence-
forth considered to have that condition. This interpretation is consistent with the Health and
Retirement Study questionnaire, which asks respondents whether they were ever diagnosed
with a condition. The body mass index variable is based on the self-reported height and weight
of Health and Retirement Study respondents, projected with estimates of a log-linear model.
Functional status is measured by daily living limitations and residence in a nursing home. We
consider individuals disabled if they reported at least one limitation or lived in a nursing
home, and we allow for transitions in and out of functional states.
To evaluate quality of life, we predict quality-adjusted life-years using the EQ-5D, a quality-
of-life index based on five health-related variables addressing mobility, daily activities, self-
care, anxiety, depression, and pain. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, we
apply an ordinary least squares regression to fit derived EQ-5D quality-adjustment scores as a
function of the chronic conditions and functional states included in FEM simulations.
Based on two complementary medical-spending data sources, the Policy Outcomes module
predicts an individual’s health spending with regard to health status, demographics, nursing
home status, and mortality. Our estimates are based on spending data from the 2007–2010
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for individuals younger than 65 and the 2007–2010 Medi-
care Current Beneficiary Survey for individuals aged 65 and older. The estimates are based on
pooled least squares regressions of spending on risk factors, self-reported conditions, and
functional status, with spending inflated to current dollars.
Finally, the Replenishing Cohorts module predicts economic and health outcomes of new
cohorts of 51-year-olds, using data from the Health and Retirement Study, the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Health Interview Survey, and the
American Community Survey.
2.2 Simulations
We conduct two types of simulations. In cohort simulations, we follow a cohort of individuals
aged 50–51 in 2009, and track their outcomes from 2010 until death. In these simulations,
individuals composing the cohort ‘age’ each period. In population simulations, we model out-
comes for all Americans aged 51 and older until 2050, taking into account those Americans
who ‘age into’ the model (using our Replenishing Cohorts). In these simulations, we can
observe a representative cross-section of the older US population in each period. Since the
Health and Retirement Study is biennial, we simulate health and costs over two-year periods
in both simulation types.
2.2.1 Scenarios.
We consider two main scenarios:
• The Guideline Adherence scenario provides the health benefits and side effects of aspirin to
all individuals for whom aspirin is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force
and AHA guidelines for primary and secondary prevention. We consider the aspirin-use
guidelines that were effective for the 2011–2012 NHANES. With regard to primary preven-
tion therapy, these guidelines specify a series of ten-year thresholds for coronary heart dis-
ease and stroke risk over which men and women are eligible [4]. With regard to secondary
prevention therapy, this scenario considers individuals with prior stroke or cardiovascular

 disease as eligible, as specified by AHA and ACCF guidelines [8]. Comparisons between
baseline FEM projections (Status Quo scenario) and this scenario illustrate the guidelines’
full potential and the benefits lost because of low aspirin use.
• The Universal Eligibility scenario provides the health effects of aspirin to all Americans aged
51 and older, while aiming to provide an upper bound of the impact of additional aspirin use
for US elderly rather than a realistic assessment of the impact that would occur if everyone
aged 51 and older used aspirin daily.
2.2.2 Eligibility.
Since a subset of the population eligible for aspirin already takes it, we
identify in FEM simulations individuals admissible for aspirin use under each scenario but not
using aspirin. NHANES data contain detailed information about clinical biomarkers, disease
risk factors, and aspirin use. In Fig 1, we compare the population eligible for aspirin in a pri-
mary or secondary prevention setting against reported aspirin use. Primary prevention eligibil-
ity, which corresponds to ten-year risks of coronary heart disease and stroke above the
guideline thresholds, is shown in yellow; secondary prevention eligibility, which corresponds
to prior stroke or heart disease, is shown in blue. The darker section shows the proportion of
the eligible population that reported using daily aspirin.
These data reveal a large unmet need for daily aspirin. Most men aged 50–69 presented cor-
onary heart disease risks above which aspirin use was recommended, but less than 20% were
following the guidelines (pale yellow). Fewer women presented a risk of stroke above the
thresholds recommended for aspirin use, but over 10% of women over 55 were eligible for
aspirin but not taking it (see details in technical documentation provided online).
2.2.3 Health impact and costs of aspirin.
Table A in S2 File summarizes the most impor-
tant findings from recent meta-analyses of health transitions and outcomes of eligible individ-
uals to reflect the health impacts of aspirin in clinical trials. For eligible individuals, we
decrease the probabilities of contracting heart disease, experiencing stroke, and mortality, and
increase gastrointestinal bleeding risks. Table 1 shows how we incorporate differential effects
by sex and context.
We also take into account the direct purchasing cost of aspirin. As of this writing, the esti-
mated cost of daily low-dose aspirin would range from less than $5 to about $20 per person
per year, depending on seller and brand. In our simulation, we opt for a measure of $7.29,
based on a unit cost of $0.019 per 81 mg tablet—which corresponds to the 500-count package
for Walgreens brand aspirin on drugstore.com (accessed Mar. 2, 2015). The direct cost of aspi-
rin is minimal in comparison with its health impact and health-care spending consequences.
2.2.4 Uncertainty.
To account for documented uncertainty in aspirin’s health impact, we
sampled estimates of its clinical effect from the confidence intervals for relative risks reported
in the literature. This random sampling excludes cancer factors, for which Cuzick et al. did not
produce confidence intervals. We drew 200 sets of risk-ratio estimates from a log-normal dis-
tribution and conducted separate simulations for each. We then computed and sorted the 200
simulation results for all variables of interest. The point estimates of our results correspond to
the mean of each variable of interest across the 200. The bounds of the 95% confidence inter-
vals correspond to the fifth lowest and highest results for each variable of interest. These inter-
vals can be interpreted as simulated 95% confidence intervals regarding clinical uncertainty of
aspirin’s effectiveness.

 3. Results
3.1 Effects of increased aspirin use on life expectancy, quality of life, and
functional status
Our cohort simulations revealed that increased aspirin use would significantly impact disease
incidence, life expectancy, and quality of life. Table 2 summarizes how the Guideline Adher-
ence and Universal Eligibility scenarios would affect key health indicators of the life course of
nationally representative 51-year-olds in comparison to current aspirin use (Status Quo
scenario).
We estimated that guideline adherence would significantly reduce cardiovascular disease.
However, because of the differential effect of aspirin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke,
adherence would not produce significant reductions in incident strokes. Because some indi-
viduals with extended life will develop cancer, we also did not find significant reduction in
incident cancers despite imposing a modest cancer risk reduction. We predicted a 25%
increase in gastrointestinal bleeds relative to Status Quo, which means that one additional
American in 63 could expect to suffer a bleeding between ages 51 and 79.
Fig 2 shows how the health impact of increased aspirin use would gradually alter the mor-
tality profile of a nationally representative cohort from age 51 until death. Out of 1,000 people,

presents a more detailed overview of findings from recent meta-analyses. S3 File—Technical Documentation includes a discussion of each parameter and
its implementation in the microsimulation.
*: While no comprehensive meta-analysis of the impact of aspirin on cancer exists yet, strong evidence suggests a causal reduction of the incidence of
several cancers due to aspirin therapy. Table B in S2 File weights best and conservative estimates of risk ratios for several cancers’ incidence published in a
recent review of existing clinical trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies (Cuzick et al., 2014) against the relative incidence of these cancers in the
Health and Retirement Study. The factor shown in the table corresponds to the conservative estimates.

 we found that increased aspirin use would mean that eight more Americans would reach age
80, and three would reach 100. As shown in Table 2, this mortality decline would translate into
gains of 0.28 years in life expectancy, of which a third would be lived free of disability. When
valuing both the health benefits and additional gastrointestinal-bleeding risks, FEM indicated
that observing guidelines would increase expected quality-adjusted life expectancy by a fifth of
a year. Effects vary across individuals. Younger men who are at high risk of heart disease and
younger women at high risk of stroke stood to benefit the most from adherence with the guide-
lines, as shown in Table C in S2 File.
We presented the results of Universal Eligibility to serve as the upper bound of gains that
could be obtained with preventive daily aspirin. This optimistic scenario assumes that the ben-
efits of aspirin stemming from randomized clinical trials could be extended to all older Ameri-
cans. This scenario produced slightly larger health gains than Guideline Adherence. Life-
expectancy gains, for instance, were 0.1 year higher. This suggests that meeting the guidelines
would capture most of aspirin’s potential health benefits.
3.2 Cost-effectiveness of increased aspirin use
In Table 3, we used FEM projections and reasonable cost estimates of gastrointestinal bleeding
and aspirin to value the health benefits of Table 2. Both benefits and costs are discounted at a
3% rate applied from age 51. Following the example of a World Bank report, we assigned a
value to health benefits of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, roughly three times the US
GDP per capita[23]. We estimated that the overall health effects of guideline compliance from
age 51 onward—taking additional gastrointestinal bleeds into account—would be worth, on
average, $14,200.

**: All individuals over age 50 are assigned to use aspirin daily.
Panel A shows cumulative incident cases predicted by FEM for 1,000 individuals without prior cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cancer, ages 51–79. Age
79 is relevant because it is the last age individuals were eligible to use aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 2011–2012. After age 79,
aspirin use drops in the Guideline Adherence scenario and disease prevalence and mortality catch up relative to Status Quo. Results at age 79 thus reveal
the maximum impact of aspirin on disease prevention.
Panel B shows expected outcomes calculated from age 51 until death. Disability-free life expectancy refers to reporting no instrumental activity of daily living
or activity of daily living limitations and not living in a nursing home. Quality-adjusted life-years adjust length of life for quality based on a person’s chronic
conditions and functional status. 95% confidence intervals with regard to the uncertainty of the effectiveness of aspirin are presented in brackets.

 Expected costs associated with these gains were estimated at $5,500. The majority of addi-
tional costs resulted from life-expectancy gains of aspirin, especially additional time lived with

 a disability or in a nursing home. Thus, the main cost of increasing aspirin use would likely be
its very success at preventing disease and extending life. The resulting incremental cost-effec-
tiveness ratio indicates that observing the guidelines would on average cost $64,200 per addi-
tional discounted quality-adjusted life-year gained. Despite higher medical costs, the net value
of the scenario was positive and significant, with a point estimate of $8,500 at age 51.
The Universal Eligibility scenario produced an upper-bound value of increasing aspirin use
of $13,000 per American. As with health gains, this suggests that guideline adherence would
provide Americans with most of the possible net gains of aspirin. Table D in S2 File indicated
that high-risk Americans, who stand to accrue the most health benefits, would also spend
more on health care.
3.3 Long-term population implications
Population-wide simulations help grasp the long-run aggregate implications of the US scenar-
ios. We applied our two extended aspirin use scenarios to the American population for 2016–
2050. Notably, these simulations revealed how full guideline implementation would gradually
impact population size. In Fig 3, this is shown graphically for the nondisabled American popu-
lation, which would not see the full effect of adherence until 2036. By that date, we estimated
that guideline adherence would result in 460,000 more nondisabled older Americans alive
(95% CI 200,000–700,000). Including the disabled population, we estimated that 900,000 lives
would be saved because of increased aspirin use (95% CI 300,000–1,400,000) relative to Status
Quo.

 This additional population would translate into additional annual health-care spending,
but not significantly so in the medium term. Annual spending was projected to increase $29.0
billion by 2036 (95% CI –3.0–62.7). By 2050, $63.9 billion in additional total expenditures
(95% CI 5.4–123.3) were projected.
Taking into account the quality-adjusted life-years gained, medical spending and gastroin-
testinal bleeds, we estimated that increased aspirin use would generate $692 billion (95% CI
345–975) in net benefits for the US population over the 2016–2036 period.
3.4 Sensitivity analysis
To investigate the sensitivity of our results, we implemented a “worst-case” version of the
Guideline Adherence and Universal Eligibility scenarios, in which we consider alternative
assumptions likely to lessen the value of implementing the guidelines, departing from the pre-
vious scenarios in four ways: 1) Aspirin is assumed to have no impact on cancer incidence; 2)
Aspirin is assumed to have no impact on all-cause mortality in primary prevention; 3) Individ-
uals need to take a higher-dose daily aspirin tablet to obtain health benefits, and thus face
higher costs and bleed risks; and 4) Direct costs of aspirin tablets are those of brand-name
drugs rather than generics (see S3 File). We found that guideline adherence would produce a
positive level net value per capita despite the more pessimistic parameters, albeit significant at
the 10% confidence level.
4. Discussion
As the US works to advance the triple aim of better care, better health, and smarter spending,
ensuring patients receive effective preventive care will be critical. Given aspirin’s remarkable
preventive effectiveness, it is a rare example of a technology that may produce less disease and
better long-term health outcomes for Americans at a low price.
Based on randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of aspirin for cardiovascular disease
prevention and new evidence on cancer, we estimated that observing the guidelines would pre-
vent 11 cases of heart disease and four cancers for every 1,000 Americans aged 51–79 and
improve life expectancy by 0.3 years. By 2036, an estimated 900,000 more Americans would be
alive if aspirin guidelines were observed. However, according to FEM simulations, about two-
thirds of the life-expectancy gains would be lived with a disability, and aspirin’s success in
extending life would ultimately increase lifetime medical spending. Despite these higher medi-
cal costs, observing the guidelines would yield positive and significant net value.
This study has several potential limitations. Simulations are based on the premise that aspi-
rin’s health effects, as reported by randomized clinical trials literature, can be generalized to all
users, though real-world effects are bound to differ. Also, like other effective treatments [24],
aspirin may reduce the incentive for other preventive behavior.
More generally, this article provides an illustration of a key challenge of preventive medi-
cine. A New York Times blog post recently warned that 2,000 people need to take daily aspirin
to prevent a single heart attack over a two-year period, while stressing that “for 1,999 of the
2,000 people, aspirin doesn’t make any difference at all”[25]. Such framing, especially over the
near term, is unfavorable to preventive care and favorable to curative care. Indeed, a high
number of people must receive preventive care to save one life, while the associated risks may
be understandably worrisome. Over the long term, however, preventive care can save millions
of lives. The present study, while demonstrating the marked positive impact of aspirin compli-
ance, also emphasizes the need for definitive studies to validate outcomes, as well as the need
to develop improved and safer therapeutic alternatives for risk prevention.

 Risk prevention for the elderly is critical to achieving the health benefits required for opti-
mal long-term economic and population health. Expanded use of aspirin by older Americans
with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease could generate substantial population health bene-
fits over the next twenty years and do so very cost-effectively.
