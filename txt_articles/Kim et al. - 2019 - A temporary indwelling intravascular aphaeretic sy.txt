Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have become an established biomarker for prognosis in
patients with various carcinomas. However, current ex vivo CTC isolation technologies rely
on small blood volumes from a single venipuncture limiting the number of captured CTCs.
This produces statistical variability and inaccurate reflection of tumor cell heterogeneity.
Here, we describe an in vivo indwelling intravascular aphaeretic CTC isolation system to
continuously collect CTCs directly from a peripheral vein. The system returns the remaining
blood products after CTC enrichment, permitting interrogation of larger blood volumes than
classic phlebotomy specimens over a prolonged period of time. The system is validated in
canine models showing capability to screen 1–2% of the entire blood over 2 h. Our result
shows substantial increase in CTC capture, compared with serial blood draws. This tech-
nology could potentially be used to analyze large number of CTCs to facilitate translation of
analytical information into future clinical decisions.

ancer metastases arise from circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
that are shed from the primary tumor and circulate
through lymphatic channels and blood1. Although iden-
tified more than 150 years ago2, until recently, CTCs were diffi-
cult to detect, enumerate, and characterize. Using modern
technologies, several studies have now demonstrated that elevated
levels of CTC isolated from a single blood draw are prognostic in
patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung
cancers, as well as early stage breast and prostate cancers3–8.
Furthermore, CTC analysis holds promise for predicting benefit
from targeted therapies, pharmacodynamic monitoring during
treatment, and insight into the biology of metastases9,10. Indeed,
CTC evaluation might be used for early detection of malignancy,
if an assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity could be
developed.
CTCs are extremely rare events. For example, in a single
7.5 mL tube of whole blood drawn from an average patient with
metastatic breast cancer, it is unusual to identify more than 10
CTCs within the context of billions of erythrocytes and millions
of leukocytes normally present. More than a hundred ex vivo
CTC capture devices have been developed to enrich and isolate
CTC from whole blood10–12. However, CTC isolation using these
technologies is limited to small blood volumes (usually 1–50 mL)
due to patient safety concerns, and therefore the absolute number
of CTC is small. Moreover, a single blood draw interrogates only
those CTC present at the time of venipuncture, and does not take
into account temporal differences in CTC release into the cir-
culation. The ability to interrogate larger blood volumes over
extended periods of time might enhance the number of CTC
available for enumeration, which would therefore increase sta-
tistical confidence of sampling for comparison of serial levels13,14.
This approach would also provide more CTCs for molecular
phenotyping, genotyping, and further biological characterization.
Attempts to increase the volume of blood evaluated for CTC
isolation have included using alternative sites of blood collection,
including the vessels draining primary cancers accessed at the
time of surgery15. However, the accessibility to these sources is
limited according to the location of the tumor, and this approach
is not practical for routine diagnostic use. Furthermore, despite
the considerable number of CTCs detected in samples from the
tumor draining vessels, many cells that are disrupted during
surgery rapidly undergo apoptosis16, and their biological and
clinical impact is unknown.
Other investigators have reported isolating CTC in cytopher-
esis products, either from whole blood or bone marrow, often
collected in anticipation of hematopoeitic stem cell transplanta-
tion therapy17–19. Although this strategy enables a substantial
increase in detecting CTCs compared with a single blood draw,
standard cytopheresis is cumbersome and inconvenient for the
patient. Furthermore, cytopheresis products mainly consist of
concentrated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which require
an additional high throughput screening step for CTC identifi-
cation. As with cannulating tumor-draining vasculature, the
logistics required for standard leukapheresis/cytopheresis render
this approach impractical as a standard diagnostic test, especially
for application in a serial fashion.
Investigators have also reported use of an intravenous gold-
coated stainless steel medical wire with a hydrogel layer cova-
lently coupled with antibodies against epithelial cellular adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) protein (GILUPI CellCollector)20–25. How-
ever, physiologic variations between patients affecting blood flow
and affinity make it difficult to standardize quantitative inter-
pretation of CTCs by time of insertion. Similarly, a recent study
has demonstrated in vivo capture of non-small cell lung cancer
cells injected into a porcine model, using a flexible magnetic wire
(MagWIRE)26. However, the approach requires pre-injection of
EpCAM coated magnetic particles to label CTCs which limits its
long-term application due to possible systemic exposure of iron
overload.
To address the shortcomings of current approaches, we
developed a temporary indwelling, intravascular aphaeretic CTC
isolation system that can potentially be worn by a patient for
several hours and through which a relatively large volume of
blood can be interrogated. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
device in ex vivo experiments, and we have performed proof-of-
principle investigations of its potential clinical application for
in vivo CTC capture in a canine model.

 injector, and a CTC capture module that contains a microfluidic
CTC capture chip. The system is designed to accommodate any
type of CTC isolation device, as long as it is configured to fit into
the system manifold.
Whole blood is routed into the system from a subject’s
peripheral vein with a single cannulation using a dual-lumen
catheter (Fig. 1c) via the efflux lumen (designated as in-flow in
Fig. 1a) then through the CTC capture module, exiting back into
the subject’s circulatory system via the influx lumen of the
catheter (labeled as out-flow in Fig. 1a). Each end of the catheter
is connected to a silicone tube, treated with anticoagulation
reagents, with luer lock adaptors that thread into a peristaltic
pump and CTC capture module forming a closed loop structure.
The blood flow is driven by the peristaltic pump with a pre-
programmed flow rate and total processing volume. In between, a
flow rate sensor is implemented to monitor and maintain a
constant flow through a feedback loop. To prevent blood clot
formation during operation, heparin is continuously infused
through an injection pump. Every unit in direct contact to the
blood during sampling and re-transfusion, is sterilized and
individually inspected before use and disposed afterwards.
HBGO chip design and function. The microfluidic herringbone
graphene oxide CTC chip (HBGO chip) is designed using func-
tional graphene oxide sheets for sensitive capture and chaotic
mixing via herringbone structures for enhanced throughput. It
consists of a 24.5 × 60 mm silicon dioxide substrate with pat-
terned gold thin film layer bonded to a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) structure containing four bifurcating microchannels with
herringbone grooves embedded on their top surface (Fig. 2a).
Functional graphene oxide nano sheets are assembled onto the
gold layer presenting high-density anti-EpCAM antibodies on the
substrate surface through chemical cross-linkers27,28. The geo-
metry of the herringbone structure has been determined based
upon previous designs used for chaotic mixing at low Re
number29,30. However, unlike earlier devices in which the inter-
action mainly takes place near the grooves31, the geometry of the
herringbone structure has been modified to maximize the contact
frequency of cells to the substrate where the antibodies are
tethered (Fig. 2b).
Twenty-four chevrons, a set of twelve staggered asymmetri-
cally, was defined as a single mixing unit and periodically shifted
along the channel axis to place each vertex points with a spacing
of 25 μm. The distribution of these points, where a vertical drag
force is induced by adjacent micro vortexes, increased the
probability of cells to be directed toward the antibody coated
substrate. The dimension of the groove height, width, and pitch
was also adjusted to decrease the hydraulic resistance past that of
the main fluidic channel. This unbalanced resistance between the
channel and grooves increased the overall fluidic circulation by
deflecting a significant portion of fluid and cells into the
herringbone structure (Supplementary Fig. 1). Cells immersed
and guided through the herringbone moved in a zigzag trajectory
until captured, which increased its traveling time and distance
within the chip (Supplementary Fig. 2). The final dimension of
the PDMS structure was as followed: overall height of the main
fluidic channel was 40 μm, with a groove height set to 60 μm; the
groove pitch and width was 200 and 160 μm, respectively, and the
angle between the chevrons was 45° (Fig. 2b).

 rates, a flat channel graphene oxide chip (FCGO chip)27,28 pre-
viously reported was used for comparison (Fig. 2c, Supplementary
Fig. 3). Cultured human breast cancer MCF7 cells were labeled
with a fluorescent cell-tracker dye and spiked into 5 mL of PBS
buffer solution with a concentration of 50–200 cells/mL. Both
cells captured on-chip and non-captured cells collected into a
waste well were counted after processing the samples to calculate
the capture efficiency based on the total number of cells. At a flow
rate of 1 mL/h (≈16.67 μL/min), a range in which most affinity-
based microfluidic devices operate, both chips showed high
capture efficiency with a mean yield above 90%. However, with
increasing flow rates, the average cell capture efficiency for the
FCGO chip dramatically dropped below 80% at flow rates of 50
and 100 μL/min, and further decreased below 50% at 200 μL/min
and higher. In contrast, the HBGO chip maintained a target yield
of >80% up to 200 μL/min with no significant decrease in overall
capture efficiency, indicating the effect of the herringbone mixer
for improved cell surface interaction.
In addition, cell viability was assessed at different flow rates to
determine the effect of shear force induced by increasing flow
rates during the isolation process (Fig. 2d). This was one of the
critical readouts as the viability could adversely affect further
downstream analysis of the isolated cells. Up to a flow rate of
200 μL/min, >90% of cells were found to be viable with no
significant reduction compared with the viability at lower flow
rates. The cell viability significantly decreased (<70%) when
higher flow rates were applied, therefore becoming the rate
limiting factor of the HBGO chip.
Finally, to examine the effect of UV on chemical cross linkers
and antibodies during the final sterilization process, chips were
exposed to varying doses of UV and subsequently tested for cell
immobilization
(Supplementary
Fig.
4).
Compared
to
no
exposure, no adverse effect was observed in the cell capture
performance. In addition, the endotoxin levels of fluids obtained
from the chips after sterilization were less than the 0.5 EU/mL
detection limit, with no bacterial growth observed after plated and
cultured on sheep blood agar.
Ex vivo capture of intravenously infused CTCs in canine. To
translate the concept of in vivo CTC capture into human clinical
trials using the system, the feasibility of this approach was
validated in canine models. Dogs were chosen over murine
models, since their relatively larger vascular size and blood
volume allowed easy and reliable venous access, and dogs may
represent a much more faithful model of human cancer32,33. A
total of 2 × 107 non-labeled MCF7 cells were injected intrave-
nously to mimic the occurrence of natural CTCs in blood. To
estimate the cell distribution during circulation and determine the
optimal time interval for isolation, peripheral blood collected by
venipuncture was sampled before and after 1 (end of infusion), 5,
15, 30, 60, and 120 min following injection. The sampled whole
blood was then processed through the HBGO chip ex vivo at a
flow rate of 100 μL/min. Captured MCF7 cells were quantified by
positive CK staining with the absence of canine CD45 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). To take into account for false positive CK
staining from canine leukocytes, counting results were subtracted
from that of the blood sampled before cell infusion and nor-
malized to the maximum cell counts from each test. Figure 3a
illustrates cellular removal kinetics of MCF7 cells after intrave-
nous infusion, averaged from three separate investigational ani-
mals on different days (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary
Table 1), as determined by serial blood draws. The distribution
time for cells to appear in circulation after injection was less than
a minute. MCF7 cell counts rose to a maximum at 30 min from
inoculation and declined over the succeeding 90 min due to their
clearance during circulation. Most MCF7 cells were identified as
single cells but clusters were also detected (Fig. 3b). Importantly,
although the expression level of CK decreased as the time of
blood sampling increased, MCF7 cells were detectable throughout
the duration of the pre-planned experimental duration of 2 h. No
short-term or long-term adverse effects from the MCF7 injection
and venipuncture were observed.
In vivo capture of intravenously infused CTC. Following
establishment of appropriate time frames for both efficacy and
safety and demonstration of cell capture ex vivo, the entire system
was tested for direct cell harvesting from in vivo circulation. Here,
the flow rate sensor was excluded from the system since it was not
disposable after use. After placement of a double-lumen catheter
into the jugular vein, the system was attached to the HBGO chip
and heparin pump via pre-sterilized extension sets. All fluid paths
were primed with 1% heparin and connected to the catheter
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Prior to cell injection, the system was

 activated for 30 mins to inspect for any blood clotting or clogging
activity in the device, tube, and connector junctions. By varying
the heparin concentration during operation, a 10% concentration
of heparin with a 1:5 volume ratio to the blood induced no
detectable blood clogs or clots. The peristaltic motion of the
pump, as well as the micro vortices generated within the chip
enabled heparin to be gently mixed with blood efficiently.
Next, 2 × 107 red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing MCF7
cells were injected into the cephalic vein of the canine subject, and
the system was turned on after 1 min. Blood was then permitted
to circulate through the device for up to 120 min. To compare
and evaluate the system performance, 1 mL of blood was also
concurrently drawn through the same jugular catheter every
20 min and analyzed for MCF7 presence by ex vivo CTC capture
(Fig. 4a). A micrograph of a captured CTC and a contaminating
leukocyte, demonstrating the clear distinction between the two, is
illustrated in Fig. 4b. The average number of cells captured
ex vivo for each draw of blood was 35.33 ± 8.46 cells/mL with a
maximum concentration of 45 cells/mL after 60 min (Fig. 4c). In
total, 212 MCF7 cells were isolated and enumerated in the 6 mL
of whole blood collected in 1 mL increments over the 2 h
experiment. The slightly lower concentration and shift of time at
which maximum concentration occurred, when compared with
the cell injection study described above, was most likely due to the
different physiological kinetics (differences in body size (7 kg),
cardiac output, volumes of distribution, etc.) among the tested
subjects.
In contrast to the ex vivo CTC capture, a total of 762 MCF7
cells were isolated in vivo over 2 h within the indwelling
intravascular CTC capture system (Fig. 4d). The total capture of
CTC in vivo by the indwelling system was approximately 3.5 times
compared with the periodic blood draw approach (Figs. 4c and
4d). Importantly, the recovery rate measured as total number of
cells per mL from in vivo circulation was also substantially greater
compared with the ex vivo capture experiment (P = 0.02, Fig. 4e).
This difference was attributed to the varying concentration of
MCF7 cells undergoing natural elimination with the observed
blood half-life of 2 h in the immunocompetent host. As such,
more discrete blood sampling at later times after the predicted
maximum cell concentration resulted in a lower recovery rate than
the continuous intravenous isolation done in vivo. No RFP
positive cells were identified in the blood obtained before cell
infusion, confirming the specificity of our counts.
In case the surface of the HBGO chip became saturated with
CTCs when applied for an extended period of time, we designed the
system to be capable of instantly replacing the CTC capture module
by swapping the chips, while maintaining sterility. This strategy
permitted longer interrogation of increased blood volume without
having to discontinue the intravenous access. In this regard, no
visible interruption in blood flow was observed after swapping the
chip every 20 min. As expected from the cellular kinetic data
(Fig. 3a), CTC harvest was greatest in the second chip, which ran
between the 20 to 40 min time period (Fig. 4d). There were no
changes in clinical observations (temperature, pulse, respiration,
body weight, food intake) or clinical pathology measurements
(complete blood count, chemistry profile, coagulation) in any of the
dogs at any time during or up to 7 days following the procedure.
Discussion
Despite the promising clinical implications of monitoring CTCs
as a liquid biopsy, current CTC assays are hampered by the
requirement that only a limited amount of blood can be collected
at a single time-point. The indwelling intravascular aphaeretic
CTC collection system we describe interrogates a larger blood
volume in vivo over an extended period of time for capture and
subsequent analysis of CTC. We liken this device to a Holter
monitor commonly used by cardiologists to monitor cardiac
arrhythmias over a prolonged period of time vs. at a single time-
point provided by a rhythm strip.

 The system incorporates a CTC chip module which takes
advantage of the functional graphene oxide immobilized with
anti-EpCAM antibody and herringbone micro-channels. This
chip has substantially increased sensitivity and throughput
compared with previous immuno-affinity based CTC isolation
platforms11.
We have validated our approach in a canine model by suc-
cessfully interrogating 1–2% of the entire canine blood volume
over 2 h to isolate cancer cells in vivo. Major concerns regarding
sterility, intra-device clotting, as well as intravascular thrombosis
have been resolved by several strategies, including rigorous ster-
ilization procedures and incorporation of a continuous heparin
infusion injector. Furthermore, device clogging anticipated by
saturating the CTC capture module with CTCs has been solved
by the design of interchangeable CTC chips. This feature suggests
that the system could be left in place for longer periods of time,
potentially permitting even higher blood volume interrogation at
little or no harm and minimal patient inconvenience. Further,
previous in vivo CTC isolation strategies using standard cyto-
phoresis necessitate bedside peripheral blood collection and are
encumbered with potential blood cell loss. Our system is wear-
able, thereby allowing full patient mobility during operation with
minimal cell loss.
It is not clear whether CTC dissemination from existing tissue
metastases occurs at a continuous rate or, alternatively, in peri-
odic, discrete segments. Likewise, it is not known whether CTCs
can gain access to circulation equally from all metastases or in a
non-uniform site-specific distribution. Current methods of CTC
enumeration require assumption of homogeneous CTC dis-
tribution at the time of venipuncture. Our system permits peri-
odic CTC assessment by swapping the CTC-collection chips
while at the same time continuously monitoring blood flow.
Similar to our results, previous studies have shown that the CTC
counts per mL from diagnostic leukapheresis products were sig-
nificantly higher than their matched peripheral blood samples
when both are processed using the CellSearch® system17. Of note,
the time-dependent variation of CTC concentration observed in
our case was clearly due to infusion of trans-species cultured cells,
and does not resemble the anticipated situation in patients.
However, our observation does demonstrate that our system can
identify differential CTC concentrations over time. Therefore, the
methodology incorporated into our system, which permits
patient-convenient CTC enrichment of a large volume of blood
over a long time, and into which periodic sampling can be per-
formed without multiple venipunctures, may provide insight into
these biologically, and perhaps clinically, important questions.
Tumor biomarker assays may have clinical utility in one of
several use contexts, including risk categorization, screening for
undetected
cancers
at
early
stage,
differential
diagnosis,
prognosis-independent of therapy, prediction of benefit of ther-
apy, and serial monitoring to determine the state of the
cancer34,35. Currently, CTC have been shown to have clinical
validity as a prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer36,37 and
in the metastatic setting in several epithelial malignancies38–41.
The reliability and higher recovery rate from long-term, large
blood volume scans might broaden the clinical applicability of
CTCs for many of the other use contexts, particularly through
further downstream genotyping and molecular characteriza-
tion42–44 without the need for sophisticated CTC culture
techniques45.
Our first validation study of the aphaeretic CTC isolation
system has produced promising results. However, several chal-
lenges remain before the methodology can be implemented into
clinical settings. In theory, the system could potentially be
exposed to several liters of blood in human circulation during the
2 h time of intravenous access. The CTC collection module, as
presently designed, permitted interrogation of approximately
10–20 mL of blood in the dogs over 2 h, representing approxi-
mately 1–2% of the entire canine blood volume. Scaling up, this
amount would translate to only 50–100 mL in an adult human.
We are now working on improving the maximum flow rate
through the system, conceivably by 3D stacking of the chips or by
applying the system for a longer period of time with replaceable
chips. In addition, the module used in our current system was
designed to target the epithelial antigen for CTC immobilization,
since we previously observed that many canine epithelial cancers
express
EpCAM46.
However,
since
CTCs
are
highly
heterogeneous42,43,47, it is likely that we are missing subpopula-
tions with reduced or loss of epithelial markers during epithelial-
to-mesenchymal transition48. Applying a combination of various
antibodies to coat the surface of the current capture module could
potentially expand the capability to isolate a wider range of CTCs
subtypes. In addition, since the system can fit any CTC isolation
platforms with interchangeability, it will be of interest to test
marker-agnostic devices49 to elucidate whether CTC subgroups
differ in their clinical implications in future studies.
In summary, we show that a temporary indwelling intravas-
cular aphaeretic system can enable long-term operation in vivo to
continuously harvest large quantities of CTCs, by re-transfusing
the remaining blood products after the isolation procedure with
minimal cell loss nor patient burden. Successful demonstration in
canine models confirms the feasibility of our approach for future
interventional clinical studies. The flexibility of the current system
design can also be combined and adapted with various CTC
enrichment methodologies or biochemical sensors that requires
real-time analytical information from the blood. Finally, high
numbers of CTCs obtained from large volume of blood screening
will significantly reduce errors in determining the disease status
and allow multiple characterization of CTCs to gain insight into
their molecular and functional role realizing the full potential of a
true liquid biopsy.

Fabrication of system manifold and HBGO chip. The overall schematics of the
entire system are illustrated in Fig. 1. The design of the system manifold was
created by CAD software (Solidworks) and fabricated using a high-resolution 3D
printer (Projet 3500 Max). An acrylic based resin, M3 crystal, was used for the
printing process for its mechanical integrity and biocompatibility. Each component
including the pump, heparin injector, power source, and micro controller were
placed in the designated compartment and enclosed (Fig. 1b)
The production of the HBGO chip involved two separate processes. First, to
fabricate the chip substrate, Cr and Au were evaporated onto a 4 inch silicon
dioxide wafer and patterned. The wafer was then diced into individual pieces. Next,
to fabricate the PDMS structure, a silicon master mold was created by standard
photolithography. Negative photoresist (SU-8 2050, MicroChem) was patterned on
a 4 inch silicon wafer using two separate masks: one for the main fluidic channel
(40 µm height) and the other for the herringbone grooves (60 µm). The height of
each layer was measured after each process with a surface profilometer (Veeco
Dektak 6 M). PDMS pre-polymer mixed with cross linker at a 10:1 weight ratio was
poured onto the mold, degassed, and baked in an oven at 65 °C for 24 h. The cured
PDMS structure was then carefully peeled off and cut. Finally, two through-holes
were punched with a biopsy punch at both ends of the channel to feed and connect
the tubing.
HBGO chip assembly and surface functionalization. To chemically modify the
chip surface, tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide intercalated graphene oxide nano
sheets grafted with phospholipid-polyethylene glycol-amine were prepared and
assembled on the gold patterned silicone dioxide substrate by electrostatic

 attraction27. The substrates and PDMS replicas were subjected to oxygen plasma
treatment and bonded to form the final device. N-γ-maleimidobutyryl-
oxysuccinimide ester (GMBS) was flowed through the chip using a syringe pump
(Harvard apparatus) and incubated for 30 min. The chip was then flushed with
70% ethanol to pre-sterilize the inner chamber wall. Subsequently, neutravidin and
biotinylated anti-EpCAM antibody (BAF960, R&D Systems) was introduced fol-
lowed by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block the remaining binding surface.
Sterilization process. To prevent microbial contamination, all disposable units
within direct contact to the blood including the tubes, luer connectors, and syringes
were sterilized using heat or ethylene oxide gas sterilization and packaged sepa-
rately. For the CTC capture chip, the substrate was exposed to UV and the PDMS
was autoclaved before assembly. All surface modification steps were performed in a
germ poor environment. Each reagent was sterilized and tested for endotoxin level
using limulus-amebocyte-lysate (LAL) gel clot assay (0.5 EU/mL sensitivity, Lonza)
before use. After complete functionalization, the device was exposed to UV and the
fluid within a subset of chips were sampled, plated on sheep blood agar, and
cultured for 2 weeks to detect any bacterial growth.
Cell culture and labeling. The cultured human epithelial breast cancer cell lines,
MCF7 (estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative) and BT474, were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, LGC Standards) and were
authenticated by the vendor. Both cell lines were tested for mycoplasma con-
tamination using MycoAlertTM (Lonza) and Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit
(ATCC) and were found to be negative. MCF7 and BT474 cells were cultured at
37 °C with 5% CO2 and maintained by regular passage in complete media con-
sisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (GIBCO®, Life Technology).
When cells reached a confluency of 70–80%, they were collected and fluorescently
labeled with CellTrackerTM Green CMFDA dye (Invitrogen, C7025) or Cell-
MaskTM Orange plasma membrane stain (Invitrogen, C10045) for cell capture
experiments. For in vivo cell capture, MCF7 cells purchased from ATCC were
transfected with NucLight RedTM (Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI) according to
manufacturer instructions (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Cell viability assay. To measure cell viability after processing samples through the
HBGO chip, a live/dead viability/cytotoxicity assay kit (GIBCO®, Life Technology)
was used. The chip was washed with 1× PBS (phosphate buffered saline, GIBCO®,
Life Technology) after capturing the cells. Subsequently, a live/dead reagent con-
sisting of calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 was prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instruction and applied. Following 30 min incubation, cells were
imaged and manually counted under a fluorescent microscope for quantification.
Human blood specimen collection. Whole blood was drawn from healthy
volunteers after obtaining informed consent for research testing that complied with
the ethical regulations under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved pro-
tocol at the University of Michigan. All samples were collected into CellSave tubes
(Menarini Silicon BioSystems) and processed within 4 h.
Canine model. All canine experiments were performed with approval from the
Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC,
16–6490 A) for animal testing and research that complied with ethical regulations.
Young adult male beagles (12–18-months-old) were purchased from a commercial
vendor and housed individually in an IACUC-approved facility at the Colorado
State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with standard day/light, watering
and feeding schedules. Baseline hematology, clinical chemistry, and coagulation
profile were obtained. Animals were randomly chosen for each experiment.
For the ex vivo cell capture experiments, cultured MCF7 cells were heparinized,
suspended in 5 mL of sterile pyrogen free NaCl and injected intravenously via the
cephalic vein. Following injection, peripheral blood was serially collected via
jugular venipuncture into CellSave tubes at multiple time points and evaluated for
capture efficacy. A minimum of 3 independent experiments were carried out for all
ex vivo studies.
For the in vivo cell capture experiments, the dog was sedated with butorphanol
and acepromazine. The ventral cervical region was clipped and aseptically scrubbed
followed by placing a 14-gauge dual lumen central venous catheter (Arrow/
Teleflex, Morrisville, NC) in the jugular vein. The system was connected to the
catheter with extension sets and primed. One minute after injection of MCF7 cells
via the cephalic vein, the system was activated to allow blood to circulate through
the CTC capture module for up to 120 min. Following completion, the central
catheter was removed and the dogs were allowed to recover. The following day and
7 days later, blood was submitted for hematology, clinical chemistry, and
coagulation profile. The dogs were not screened for the development of cancer
since human MCF7 breast cancer cells are xenogeneic to dogs and not expected to
colonize in an immunologically intact animal. Each dog was continuously
monitored with daily examinations of temperature, pulse, respiration, food and
water intake, and the catheter site for one week after the experiment. Then, the dog
was off-protocol and eligible for adoption or transfer to other protocols as
appropriate.
Immunofluorescent staining. After capturing on the HBGO chip, unlabeled MCF7
cells spiked into blood or injected into dogs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). Before staining, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X followed
by blocking with a blocking buffer containing 2% normal goat serum and 3% BSA.
A cocktail of primary antibodies including anti-cytokeratin 7/8 (349205, BD
Biosciences) and two types of anti-canine CD45 (MCA1042GA and MCA2035S,
Bio-Rad) were diluted in 1% BSA and flowed through the chip. After a quick wash,
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 and 488 (A-21133, A-21121,
and A-11006, Invitrogen) were prepared in 1% BSA and applied for probing. The
cell nuclei were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen) as
the final step before microscopic imaging. Cells were observed under ×10 magni-
fication using the inverted epifluorescence microscope (Ti Eclipse, Nikon) with an
automated motor stage. Images were reviewed blinded and analyzed manually
(Image J and NIS-elements, Nikon).
