IMPORTANCE Rectal resection with mesorectal excision is the mainstay treatment for rectal
cancer.
OBJECTIVE To review and analyze the evidence concerning the pathologic outcomes of
laparoscopic (LRR) vs open (ORR) rectal resection for rectal cancer.
DATA SOURCES The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (through
PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) comparing LRR vs ORR.
STUDY SELECTION Only RCTs published in English from January 1, 1995, to June 30, 2016, that
compared LRR with ORR for histologically proven rectal cancer in adult patients and reported
pathologic outcomes (eg, positive circumferential resection margin, and complete mesorectal
excision) were eligible for inclusion. Of 369 records screened, 14 RCTs were selected for the
qualitative and quantitative analyses.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers performed the study
selection and quality assessment. Random-effects models were used to summarize the risk
ratio (RR) and mean differences.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The rate of positive circumferential resection margin
(CRM), defined as 1 mm or less from the closest tumor to the cut edge of the tissue, and the
quality of mesorectal excision (complete, nearly complete, or incomplete).
RESULTS The meta-analysis included 14 unique RCTs with 4034 unique patients. Of 2989
patients undergoing rectal resection, a positive CRM was found in 135 (7.9%) of 1697 patients
undergoing LRR and 79 (6.1%) of 1292 patients undergoing ORR (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89-1.53;
P = .26; I2 = 0%) in 9 studies. A noncomplete (nearly complete and incomplete) mesorectal
excision was reported in 179 (13.2%) of 1354 patients undergoing LRR and 104 (10.4%) of 998
patients undergoing ORR (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; P = .02; I2 = 0%) in 5 studies. The distal
resection margin involvement (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.34-3.67; P = .86), the mean number of
lymph nodes retrieved (mean difference, 0.05; 95% CI, −0.77 to 0.86; P = .91), the mean
distance to the distal margin (mean difference, 0.01 cm; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.15 cm; P = .87),
and the mean distance to radial margins (mean difference, −0.67 mm; 95% CI, −2.16 to 0.83
mm; P = .38) were not significantly different between LRR and ORR. The risk for bias was
assessed as low in 10 studies, high in 3, and unknown in 1. The overall quality of the evidence
emerging from the literature was rated as high.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on the available evidence, the risk for achieving a
noncomplete mesorectal excision is significantly higher in patients undergoing LRR compared
with ORR. These findings question the oncologic safety of laparoscopy for the treatment of
rectal cancer. However, long-term results of the ongoing RCTs are awaited to assess whether
these pathologic results have an effect on disease-free and overall patient survival.

C
olorectal cancers are the third most common malig-
nant tumors worldwide.1-3 In particular, rectal cancers
constitute one-third of these tumors and account for
nearly 40 000 new cases per year in the United States.4
The mainstay treatment for rectal cancer remains surgical
resection,forwhichoutcomeshavemarkedlyimprovedduring
the last 20 years, mostly owing to the introduction of total me-
sorectal excision (TME). This surgical technique demonstrated
reductionsintumorrecurrencebecausetheradialspreadofcan-
cercellsisresectedentirelywiththecompleteremovaloftheme-
sorectaltissues.Radiotherapyandchemotherapyalsohavema-
jor roles in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer.5
In the era of TME, the accuracy and safety of mesorectal
dissection and the achievement of free resection margins are
considered the most important pathologic outcomes used to
measure the quality of surgery. Indeed, negative circumfer-
ential resection margin (CRM) and complete TME are associ-
ated with lower local and distal recurrence rates and better
long-term survival.6-10 A recent study of a cohort of 563 pa-
tients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated
with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery found that
the 5-year local recurrence-free survival was 66% in patients
with a CRM of 1 mm or less and 98% in patients with a CRM of
greaterthan1mm.11Inanotherrecentstudyevaluatingachieve-
ment of complete mesorectal excision, the estimated 3-year
local recurrence rate was 4% for complete, 7% for nearly com-
plete, and 13% for incomplete mesorectal excision.6
Although minimally invasive rectal excision has been re-
garded as one of the most complex operations in the field of
colorectal surgery, laparoscopy is a widespread technique per-
formed by more than 70% of experienced colorectal sur-
geons worldwide and more than 80% in the United States.12
Large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed that laparo-
scopic TME is associated with less blood loss, earlier return of
bowel movement, and shorter length of hospital stay com-
paredwithopensurgery.13-15Theseshort-termbenefitsoflapa-
roscopy were confirmed in previous meta-analyses,16-19 which
found no difference in terms of overall survival, disease-free
survival, and pathologic outcomes between the laparoscopic
and open approaches.19 Thus, evidence appears to support
laparoscopic TME as a valuable, safe, and feasible alternative
to open TME, but the 2 most recent RCTs20,21 (not included in
the previously published meta-analyses) found contradic-
tory results and opened the existing conclusions to debate.
In this study, we conducted a new systematic review and
meta-analysis of RCTs comparing laparoscopic rectal resection
(LRR) vs open rectal resection (ORR) to evaluate the pathologic
outcomes of surgery in light of the most recent evidence on the
topic.Weinvestigatedwhetheranydifferencesarefoundinterms
of CRM involvement (≤1 mm) and achievement of a complete
mesorectal excision between LRR and ORR for rectal cancer.
Methods
Study Design and Inclusion Criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analysis(PRISMA)statementschecklist.22Theeligibilityandse-
lection criteria were defined before initiating the data search to
ensuretheproperidentificationofalleligiblestudies.OnlyRCTs
on rectal cancer that compared LRR and ORR and reported at
least 1 of the outcomes of interest were retrieved and ana-
lyzed.Notrialdurationlimitationwasapplied.Prospectivenon-
randomized studies, retrospective studies, case reports, re-
views, commentaries, and conference abstracts were not
considered. Moreover, articles reporting the results of surgical
teams during their learning curve for LRR were also discarded.
The study methods and analyses were reviewed to ensure the
respect of the ethical principles for biomedical research.
By applying the PICO (Problem/Population, Intervention,
Comparison,andOutcome)framework,wedefinedstudyselec-
tioncriteria.Participantsincludedadultpatientswithhistologi-
callyprovenrectalcancerrequiringsurgicalresection.Interven-
tionsconsistedofLRR(includinglaparoscopic-assisted)andORR
(ie, TME or partial mesorectal excision). Studies were included
independentlyofthesurgicaltechnique(eg,abdominoperineal
resectionoranteriorresection)andtheperformanceofaprimary
anastomosis. In all included studies, LRR was compared with
ORR. Primary outcome measures consisted of the rate of posi-
tiveCRM(definedas≤1mmfromtheclosesttumortothecutedge

Literature Search Strategy
AliteraturesearchwasperformedoftheCochraneCentralReg-
ister of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (through PubMed),
EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Specific research equations
were formulated for each database using the following
keywords and/or MeSH terms: rectal/colorectal cancer/
carcinoma, treatment, therapy, management, surgery, laparos-
copy/laparoscopic surgery, open surgery/laparotomy, and ran-
domized trial/trial. Moreover, the reference lists of the eligible
studiesandrelevantreviewarticleswerecross-checkedtoiden-
tify additional pertinent studies. The clinicaltrials.gov regis-
try was also searched to look for any possible ongoing RCT for
Key Points
Question What are the pathologic outcomes of laparoscopic
rectal resection compared with open rectal resection for rectal
cancer?
Finding Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of
14 randomized clinical trials, the risk of achieving a noncomplete
(incomplete or nearly complete) mesorectal excision is
significantly higher in patients undergoing laparoscopic compared
with open rectal resections.
Meaning These pathologic findings challenge the oncologic safety
of laparoscopy for the treatment of rectal cancer.

which results might be published in the near future. We re-
trieved articles published in English from January 1, 1995, to
June 30, 2016, that met the selection criteria.
Study Selection and Quality Assessment
The title and abstract of the retrieved studies were indepen-
dently and blindly screened for relevance according to the
CONSORT Statement 2010 for RCTs (http://www.consort-
statement.org)by2reviewers(A.M.-P.andN.de’
A.).Toenhance
sensitivity, records were removed only if both reviewers
excluded the record at the title and abstract screening level.
Subsequently, both reviewers performed a full-text analysis
oftheselectedarticles.Bothreviewersindependentlyassessed
the risk for bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk for
bias, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions.24 In addition, the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) system was used to grade the body of evidence
emerging from this study.25 All disagreements between the
2 reviewers in the selection and evaluation processes were
resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (F.B.).
Data Extraction and Analysis
Data from the included studies were processed for the qualita-
tiveandquantitativeanalyses.Forbinaryoutcomedata,therisk

robustness of the results and the potential sources of heteroge-
neity were explored by performing sensitivity analyses. The
pooled effect was considered significant if P < .05. The meta-
analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3;
Cochrane Collaboration).
Results
Literature Search and Selection
Overall, the combined search identified 6205 articles, of which
5836 were rejected based on the title and abstract evaluation.
Theremaining369articlesunderwentfull-textevaluation,and
355 were excluded. No additional study was identified through
manual search, cross-check of reference lists, or search of clini-
caltrials.gov. Fourteen unique RCTs were found eligible and
were evaluated for the qualitative and quantitative analyses.
The PRISMA diagram of the literature search and the study
selection process is shown in Figure 1.
Study Characteristics
The14selectedstudieswerepublishedfromMay2003through
October 2015. They included patients who underwent sur-
gery from September 1993 through November 2014. Overall,
these studies analyzed a total of 4034 unique patients under-
going LRR or ORR (Table). The LRR group included 2265 pa-
tientswithamean(SD)ageof63.3(4.6)years,and1272(56.2%)
were male; 293 of 2230 patients (13.1%) required conversion
from an LRR to ORR. The ORR group included 1769 patients
with a mean (SD) age of 62.5 (3.9) years, and 1033 (58.4%) were
male.
Primary Outcomes
Nine studies reported the rate of CRM involvement by consid-
ering CRM as positive when 1 mm or less.13-15,20,21,30,33-35 Data
from Braga et al37 were not included in the meta-analysis ow-
ing to the lack of a precise definition of CRM involvement. The
pooled data from the RCTs found positive CRM in 135 (7.9%)
of 1697 patients who underwent LRR and in 79 (6.1%) of 1292
patients who underwent ORR; the RR was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.89-
1.53; P = .26) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) (Figure 2A).
Five studies13,14,20,21,30 reported the rate of complete me-
sorectal excision. A noncomplete mesorectal excision (nearly
complete or incomplete) was observed in 179 (13.2%) of 1354
patients who underwent LRR and in 104 (10.4%) of 998 pa-
tients who underwent ORR; the RR was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.05-
1.64; P = .02) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) (Figure 2B). The
sensitivityanalysisshowednodifferencebetweenrandom-and
fixed-effects models. Moreover, confirmatory results were ob-
served when performing a subgroup analysis by including only
the 4 major multicentric RCTs.13,14,20,21

Secondary Outcomes
The rate of positive distal margins was reported in 4 studies
only.20,21,34,37 Two of these studies reported no involvement
in the LRR and ORR groups.34,37 Positivity of distal margins
was reported in 6 (0.9%) of 662 patients who underwent
LRR and in 5 (0.8%) of 645 patients who underwent ORR
(P = .86) (Figure 3A). Similarly, no significant difference
was observed between LRR and ORR for the distance to
the distal margin,13,14,20,21 the distance to the radial
margin,13,14,20,21,31,32 or the number of lymph nodes
harvested13,14,20,30-38 (Figure 3B-D). The distal resection mar-
gin involvement (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.34-3.67; P = .86) was
not different between LRR and ORR (Figure 3A). Similarly,
the mean difference in the distance to the radial margin was
−0.67 mm (95% CI, −2.16 to 0.83 mm; P = .38; heterogeneity,
I2 = 74%) (Figure 3B); the mean difference in the distance to
the distal margin was 0.01 cm (95% CI, −0.12 to 0.15 cm;
P = .87; heterogeneity, I2 = 36%) (Figure 3C); and the mean
difference in the number of lymph nodes harvested was
0.05 (95% CI, −0.77 to 0.86; P = .91; heterogeneity, I2 = 60%)
(Figure 3D) without significant differences between LRR and
ORR.The sensitivity analyses performed confirmed the
results of the main analysis.
Study Quality Assessment
The assessment of study quality and the risk for bias is shown
in the eFigure in the Supplement. Overall, 10 studies were clas-
sifiedatalowrisk,13-15,20,21,30,33-35,371atanunknownrisk,31and
3 at a high risk for bias.32,36,38 By applying the GRADE system,
the quality of the evidence was rated as high for 10
studies13-15,20,21,30,33-35,37 and as moderate for the remaining
4 studies.31,32,36,38
Discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on
the pathologic outcomes of laparoscopic resections for rectal
cancer demonstrates that the rate of noncomplete mesorec-
tal excision is significantly higher in patients undergoing LRR
than for patients undergoing ORR. Moreover, no benefit com-
pared with open surgery has been observed in terms of CRM
involvement rates and all other pathologic variables investi-
gated after LRR.
The completeness of the mesorectal resection is a valu-
able item to assess the oncologic safety of rectal surgery and a
predictor of tumor recurrence in the pelvis.6,10,39 Indeed, the

focused on the surgical and pathologic outcomes of LRR
(ie, the COLOR II [Colorectal Cancer Laparoscopic or Open Re-
section II],13 COREAN [Comparison of Open vs Laparoscopic
Surgery for Mid and Low Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant
Chemoradiotherapy],14 ALACART [Australasian Laparo-
scopic Cancer of the Rectum],21 and ACOSOG Z6051 [Laparo-
scopic-Assisted Resection or Open Resection in Treating Pa-
tients With Rectal Cancer]20 studies). Conversely, the rate of
positive CRM (defined as ≤1 mm) was found to be similar be-
tween LRR and ORR based on 9 RCTs.13-15,20,21,30,33-35 Among
these studies, only the COLOR II and COREAN trials show a
slight, although statistically nonsignificant, benefit in terms
of CRM involvement for the laparoscopic approach. How-
ever, the COLOR II trial,13 which reported rates of CRM in-
volvementof7.3%intheLRRgroupand8.7%intheORRgroup,
had a remarkably high proportion of missing CRM data (12%
in the laparoscopic group and 8% in the open group). The
COREAN study14 showed a lower rate of positive CRM in pa-
tients undergoing LRR (2.9%) compared with ORR (4.1%), but
thistrialincludedonlypatientswhoreceivedpreoperativeche-
moradiotherapy; a careful reading of the article discloses that
major pathologic responses (grades 3 and 4)40 and the rate of
T0 to T1 findings in the final pathologic report were higher in
the LRR group than in the ORR group (43.7% vs 27.0% and
31.7% vs 18.2%, respectively). Thus, the LRR group included
more patients with better responses to neoadjuvant thera-
pies and less viable tumors, which can drastically affect CRM
involvement.41
Achieving negative CRM is challenging in clinical prac-
tice, with a rate of CRM positivity reaching 15% of TME de-
spiteoptimalcylindricalorextralevatorresections42,43;achiev-
ing this might be even harder with laparoscopy. However, the
cutoffvaluefordefiningpositiveCRMisstillunderdebate,with
the threshold of 1 mm or less as the most frequently used in
theliterature.Nevertheless,someinvestigatorsproposed2mm
or less rather than 1 mm or less to define a positive CRM—a
potential source of confusion and heterogeneity in the
literature.44,45
The 2 most recent multicenter RCTs that specifically fo-
cused on the pathologic outcomes of surgery20,21 used a com-
posite variable, including complete mesorectal excision23 and
negative radial and distal margins (both >1 mm) to assess the
oncologic efficacy of LRR and ORR. The proposed composite
outcome represents a stricter and more precise variable to as-
sess the pathologic adequacy of the surgical resection com-
pared with the CRM or TME quality taken separately, al-
though the validity and usefulness of the composite outcome
as a prognostic factor must be confirmed with the long-term
results. The ACOSOG Z6501 and ALACART trials had a nonin-
feriority design for the LRR vs ORR approaches and reached
the same conclusion. Compared with open surgery, the non-
inferiority of laparoscopic surgery for successful resection was
not established; thus, the authors did not support the routine
use of laparoscopy in patients with rectal cancer.20,21 The pres-
ent meta-analysis is in accordance with these recent findings
and in contrast with previous ones.17-19 Indeed, a meta-
analysis based on 8 RCTs and 19 prospective and retrospec-
tivestudiespublishedin201519showednodifferencesinterms
of oncologic safety between the LRR and ORR approaches,
but as previously mentioned, the 3 most recent RCTs
published20,21,30 were not included. What remains to be as-
sessed are the outcomes of surgery according to the tumor lo-
cation (eg, low, middle, and high rectal cancer), tumor stage,
and type of surgical procedure (eg, low anterior resection, ab-
dominoperineal resection). Based on the available literature,
we could not ascertain reliable data about the effect of these
factors on the pathologic outcomes of the surgical approach.
However, reading future studies focused on particular sub-
sets of tumor or surgical settings would be of interest to ex-
plore all applications of laparoscopy in the broad spectrum of
rectal cancers.
In the past, the improvement of pelvic visualization pro-
vided by laparoscopy was expected to result in better patho-
logic outcomes. However, as can be observed in the present
meta-analysis,therateofcompletemesorectalexcisionforLRR
was lower than that for ORR. A possible explanation would be
thatconventionallaparoscopicinstrumentscanbehighlychal-
lengingtouseandjeopardizetheachievementofthebestplane
of dissection for complete mesorectal removal, especially in
the narrow or irradiated pelvis. From this perspective, meso-
rectal excision might be one of the interventions in which ro-
botic methods could have an important role in contemporary
digestivesurgery.46-49Theremotecontrol,alongwiththeplace-
ment of wristed instruments in line with pelvic walls, allows
the surgeon to perform the rectal resection much more ergo-
nomically. A recent systematic review including 1776 pa-
tients who underwent robotic surgery for rectal cancer50
showedarateofCRMpositivityrangingfrom0%to7.5%.How-
ever, evidence is lacking; only a small-sized RCT has been pub-
lished comparing the outcomes of robotic vs laparoscopic
surgery, and that RCT shows a significantly shorter length
of hospital stay in the robotic group.51 The results of the
ROLARR (Robotic vs Laparoscopic Resection for Rectal Can-
cer)trial,52awaitedinthenearfuture,willprobablyhelptoelu-
cidate the role of robotic surgery for rectal cancer treatment.
Alternatively, rectal cancer can be approached by trans-
anal TME.53 The COLOR III study54 was designed to compare
transanal TME and laparoscopic TME for middle and low rec-
tal cancers. This trial is just at the recruitment phase, al-
though the investigators expect that transanal TME would be
superiortolaparoscopicTMEintermsofoncologicoutcomes.54
Limitations
The present meta-analysis relies solely on RCTs; this type of
study is considered to provide the best level of evidence.
However, potential bias cannot be completely ruled out. For
instance, the protocols of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
were not standardized among all of the included studies;
various surgical procedures (eg, anterior resections, abdomi-
noperineal amputations, hand-assisted minimally invasive
surgery) were performed in different proportions in the
included RCTs; missing data about positive distal margins
and missing definitions of resection margin involvement
were observed.20,21 Despite these limitations, the robustness
and consistency of the results were supported by the sensi-
tivity analyses and the low heterogeneity observed. More-

Conclusions
Based on the available data pooled from the most recent RCTs,
the complete mesorectal excision rate is significantly higher in
