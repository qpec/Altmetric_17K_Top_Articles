Female rats are not more variable than
male rats: a meta-analysis of neuroscience
studies

Abstract
Background: Not including female rats or mice in neuroscience research has been justified due to the variable nature
of female data caused by hormonal fluctuations associated with the female reproductive cycle. In this study, we
investigated whether female rats are more variable than male rats in scientific reports of neuroscience-related traits.
Methods: PubMed and Web of Science were searched for the period from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2014, for articles
that included both male and female rats and that measured diverse aspects of brain function. Only empirical articles
using both male and female gonad-intact adult rats, written in English, and including the number of subjects (or a
range) were included. This resulted in 311 articles for analysis. Data were extracted from digital images from article
PDFs and from manuscript tables and text. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined for each data
point and their quotient provided a coefficient of variation (CV) as a measure of trait-specific variability for each sex.
Additionally, the results were coded for the type of research being measured (behavior, electrophysiology, histology,
neurochemistry, and non-brain measures) and for the strain of rat. Over 6000 data points were extracted for both
males and females. Subsets of the data were coded for whether male and female mean values differed significantly
and whether animals were grouped or individually housed.
Results: Across all traits, there were no sex differences in trait variability, as indicated by the CV, and there were no sex
differences in any of the four neuroscience categories, even in instances in which mean values for males and females
were significantly different. Female rats were not more variable at any stage of the estrous cycle than male rats. There
were no sex differences in the effect of housing conditions on CV. On one of four measures of non-brain function,
females were more variable than males.
Conclusions: We conclude that even when female rats are used in neuroscience experiments without regard to the
estrous cycle stage, their data are not more variable than those of male rats. This is true for behavioral,
electrophysiological, neurochemical, and histological measures. Thus, when designing neuroscience experiments to
include both male and female rats, power analyses based on variance in male measures are sufficient to yield accurate
numbers for females as well, even when the estrous cycle is not taken into consideration.

 Background
Twenty years ago, the NIH began requiring all clinical
research to include both women and men in research
and to report research findings for both sexes. While
women are now included in research, fewer women than
men are used as subjects, and findings are still not being
reported by sex [1]. As a result, any chances for achiev-
ing personalized medicine for women in the near future
seem remote, as the scientific basis upon which medical
decisions are being based are still on data primarily de-
rived from men.
Accounting for sex as a biological variable in all
biomedical research is considered fundamental for en-
hancing rigor and reproducibility in preclinical research
[2, 3]. Yet there is considerable concern among preclin-
ical scientists that including female animals will increase
costs and variability in data collected [4]. This bias re-
mains entrenched in spite of evidence demonstrating
that there are important fundamental biological differ-
ences between the sexes, and failure to elucidate these
differences is impeding progress in both basic and clin-
ical research [2, 3]. As summarized by Clayton [3, p.
522], “A continual growth in knowledge of the influence
of sex at molecular, cellular, and biochemical levels and
the various ways that sex exerts influence will inform
the design and conduct of additional biomedical re-
search, which is imperative to the NIH mission of turn-
ing
discovery
into
health.
Understanding
scientific
findings in the context of sex—be they similarities, dif-
ferences, and/or complex nuances—is crucial for cor-
rectly
applying
research-derived
knowledge
toward
achieving our ultimate objectives”.
Nevertheless, there is substantial bias in biomedical re-
search to not study female rats or mice and/or to not re-
port the sex of the subjects at all [5–7]. Not including
female rats or mice in neuroscience research has been
justified due to the variable nature of female data caused
by hormonal fluctuations associated with the female’s
reproductive cycle, in spite of lack of data in support of
this position. A recent meta-analysis reported that
female mice are not inherently more variable than male
mice across diverse physiological traits [8]. Similar re-
sults have been obtained for measures of gene expres-
sion in mice and humans [9].
In this study, we investigated whether female and male
rats differ in their variability in studies that focused on
neuroscience outcomes. We chose to focus on one field
for this study in order to examine a dataset that is rela-
tively homogenous, so that failure to find a sex differ-
ence in variability would not be due to heterogeneity of
the measures being examined. We examined studies that
included intact adult male and female rats. The majority
of the studies used female rats without regard to the
stage of the estrous cycle, but we also examined 26
studies that included male and female rats at specific
stages of the estrous cycle. We now report that female
rats are not more variable than male rats on studies of
neuroscience-related traits. This is true when females
are used without regard to the estrous cycle or when
studied at specific days of the estrous cycle.
Methods
Search strategy
PubMed and Web of Science were searched for the
period from August 1, 2010 to July 31, 2014. The
PubMed search terms used were as follows: (1) (rat
AND gender differences) AND (brain OR neuroscience
OR neuron) = 411 articles and (2) (rat AND sex differ-
ences) AND (brain OR neuroscience OR neuron) = 525
articles. When these lists were manually combined, this
yielded 543 unique articles. On Web of Science, the
search terms were TS = (male and female) AND TS =
(neuro* AND rat) NOT TS = (adolescent) NOT TS =
(mice). These articles were then filtered by neuroscience,
behavior, article (not review) and 2010–2014. The Web
of Science search generated 743 references; these were
manually curated to identify 151 unique additional rele-
vant references using the titles and abstracts (manually
eliminated January 1, 2010–July 31, 2010, and any in Au-
gust 2014). When combined with the PubMed search
there were a total of 562 articles. These articles were
manually reviewed to determine appropriateness for in-
clusion. Only empirical articles using both male and
female gonad-intact adult rats, written in English, and
describing the number of subjects (or a range) were
included—resulting in 311 articles for analysis. A list
of the articles used is included in the supplemental
information for this article (see Additional file 1).
Data extraction
Data were extracted from digital image files generated
from high-resolution screenshots of article PDFs and
from manuscript tables and text. Vector graphics soft-
ware (Adobe Illustrator) was used to quantify the mean
and standard deviation (STDEV) or standard error of
the mean (SEM) values directly from figure images (in
mm), which provided a relative measure of the mean
and STDEV/SEM for each data point as described in [8].
Briefly, figures were imported into Adobe Illustrator, and
for each data point used, rectangles were positioned on
the graphs over the SEM/SD bar from the middle of the
data point or bar to the end of the error bar. A rectangle
was also positioned from the X-axis to the middle of the
data point or bar (with corrections if the scale was dis-
continuous), and the length of each of these rectangles
in millimeters (determined by the graphics software) was
used as a relative measure of the mean and error re-
ported. Data were only used if the mean and STDEV or
Becker et al. Biology of Sex Differences  (2016) 7:34

 SEM could be extracted from the article. Data presented
in tables were transcribed directly from the table. For
line graphs with more than three time points, values
were obtained from the beginning, middle, and end of
the time course, so that no one study contributed a dis-
proportionate number of data points to the overall ana-
lysis. When a range for the number of subjects was
given, the lowest number in the range was used. Data
were collected by 10 undergraduate students with an
inter-rater reliability coefficient >0.96.
Results were coded for the type of research (behavior,
electrophysiology, histology, neurochemistry, and non-
brain measures). Behavior was any behavioral measure
(N = 2245
data
points).
Electrophysiology
included
measures of electrical neural activity (LTP, unit activity,
cell clamp electrophysiology, etc.; N = 364 data points).
Neurochemistry was any measure of neurotransmitter or
neurotransmitter receptor amount, protein amount, syn-
thesis, second messengers, or neurotransmitter release
(N = 1809 data points). Most of the molecular studies
were included this category. Histology was measures of
cellular location, dendritic/axonal branching, brain re-
gions,
and
brain
region
activity,
including
c-fos;
measures that quantify physical structure in the brain
(N = 1233 data points). Non-brain measures (N = 601
data points) were any measures of non-central nervous
system biology including body weight (N = 127 data
points), blood/serum hormone measures (N = 214 data
points), cardio measures (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.;
N = 54 data points), and blood or organ measurement
of exogenous compounds or organ weights (“organ”
N = 207 data points).
For histology and neurochemistry measures, each pair
of data points was also coded for whether male and
female values were significantly different from each
other. For the histology data, the number of data points
each for males and females was as follows: no sex
difference = 648 data points; sex difference = 585 data
points. For the neurochemistry data, the number of
data points each for males and females was as follows: no
sex difference = 1177 data points; sex difference = 451 data
points; not measured = 181 data points.
In a subset of manuscripts, one or more estrous cycle
stages were recorded (n = 26 manuscripts). Analysis was
without respect to subject category. Not all studies ex-
amined all phases of the estrous cycle. We obtained the
following number of values: males = 343 data points; di-
estrus = 330 data points; proestrus = 151 data points; es-
trus = 241 data points.
For neurochemistry and behavior measures (n = 4137
data points, in total), we also evaluated whether the ani-
mals were housed individually (N = 872 data points; 29
studies), in pairs or two to three/cage (N = 1311 data
points; 57 studies), three or more per cage (N = 1062
data points; 47 studies), or not reported (N = 892 data
points; 39 studies or 22.6 % of the studies). Housing
conditions were the same for males and females in all
studies. Thus, the number of data points is the same for
both males and females.
The strain of rat was coded when it was indicated in
the
article
(Sprague-Dawley:
N = 2871
data
points;
Long-Evans: N = 1053 data points; Wistar: N = 2221
data points; Norway Brown: N = 50 data points).
Statistical analyses
The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as the
standard deviation divided by the mean (STDEV/mean)
for each data point. Male-female differences were ana-
lyzed by paired t tests (pairing by data points for male
and female collected in an individual study) or analysis
of variance (ANOVA; depending on whether individual
traits or multiple traits were being compared, respect-
ively). The ANOVAs were followed by pairwise compari-
sons with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
Female to male ratios of CV were calculated to deter-
mine if the distribution of variation differed by sex. To
calculate, the female to male ratio = [CV female/(CV fe-
male + CV male)]. The theoretical mean for the ratios
would be 0.5 if males and females did not differ in the
coefficient of variability. The CV ratios for each trait
were tested for each sex against the theoretical mean by
t test to examine whether each differed from 0.5.
Inter-rater reliability was determined by Pearson r cor-
relation to be 0.960–0.997.
Results
Female and male trait variability
There were no sex differences in the coefficient of trait
variability (CV = STDEV/mean) for any of the neurosci-
ence measures when the CVs for data points obtained
from males and females for a given measure from each
study were compared with paired t tests (Table 1). For
behavior, electrophysiology, histology, and neurochem-
istry data, we found that females were not more variable
than males (Fig. 1).

 There were, however, differences among the traits in
the extent of variability. On a two-way ANOVA (sex X
trait), there was no main effect of sex (F(1, 12,500) =
1.927; p = 0.1651) and no significant sex by trait inter-
action (F(4, 12,500) = 1.574; p = 0.1787). There was a
main effect of trait (F(4, 12,500) = 18.98; p < 0.0001) indi-
cating that the CVs for some traits were more variable
than other traits. Using Tukey’s multiple comparisons
test, the CV for behavior for males was greater than that
of histology or neurochemistry (p < 0.001), and the CV
for histology was lower than that for neurochemistry or
non-brain measures (p < 0.01). For females, the CV for
behavior was also was greater than that of histology or
neurochemistry (p < 0.001), the CV for histology was
lower than the CV for neurochemistry (p < 0.01), and the
CV for non-brain measures was greater than that for
electrophysiology (p < 0.05), histology (p < 0.001), and
neurochemistry
(p < 0.01).
This
indicates
that
even
though males and females do not differ from each other,
behavioral measures were more variable for both males
and females than were neurochemistry and histology
measures. On the other hand, histology CV data were
less variable for both males and females than neuro-
chemistry or the non-brain measures.
For “non-brain measures,” there was a significant dif-
ference when females and males were compared with a
paired t test (Table 1). The non-brain measures included
measures where the mean would be expected to vary
with the estrous cycle (body weight, heart rate, blood
pressure, organ weights, serum gonadal and adrenal
hormones, etc.). To further investigate the source of the
variance, we further assigned these measures to sub-
categories. These categories were as follows: (1) body
weight—body weight/fat weight (N = 127); (2) endo—
hormone measures (N = 214); (3) cardio—blood pres-
sure, heart rate, and other cardiac measures (N = 54);
and (4) blood/organ—measures of organ weight, organ
or blood proteins or exogenous substances, and other
organ-specific measures (N = 207). As illustrated in Fig. 2,
the measures of blood/organ were the primary source of

 the sex difference in the non-brain measures (t = 1.952;
DF = 412; p = 0.0516; Mann-Whitney U test p = 0.036).
Distribution of CV ratios
There was a trend for the distribution of CV ratios (fe-
male CV/(female CV + male CV)) to vary by trait on
ANOVA (F = 2.594, DF = 3, 5650; p = 0.0509). As the
variance was not normally distributed, the Brown-
Forsythe test was considered appropriate to apply and
there the analysis indicated that the distribution of CV
ratios varied by trait (F = 11.91, DF = 3, 5650, p < 0.0001;
Fig. 3).
We then went on to examine whether there were
sex differences in the CV ratios for the different
traits. The theoretical mean for the ratios would be
0.5 if males and females did not differ in the CV ra-
tio. When the CV ratios for each trait are tested for
each sex against this theoretical mean by t test, there
was no sex difference in the CV ratio on the behavior
(mean = 0.4943 ± 0.0057; t = 1.893, DF = 2243) or histology
(mean = 0.5050 ± 0.005; t = 1.130, DF = 1232) trait categor-
ies, and males were more variable than females on the
electrophysiology (mean = 0.4863 ± 0.014; t = 2.092, DF =
363, p = 0.037) and the neurochemistry (mean = 0.4916 ±
0.0084; t = 2.336, DF = 1824, p = 0.0196) trait categories.
Females were more variable than males on the non-brain
measures (mean = 0.5308 ± 0.0308, t = 4.316, DF = 600,
p < 0.0001).
CV values when there is a sex difference in the value
We went on to examine whether there were sex differ-
ences in CV values if the data points being compared
differed significantly between males and females. This
analysis examined two trait categories: the histology
measures (where the CV ratio distribution did not differ
between females and males) and the neurochemistry
measures (where CV ratios indicated greater variability
in males). As illustrated in Fig. 4, there was no effect of
whether a given data point was significantly different
between the sexes on the CV values for either histology
or neurochemistry. However, in the neurochemistry cat-
egory, CVs were greater in females when the mean did
not differ significantly from those of males as compared
to females whose means differed from those of males
(Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, p < 0.05).
Impact of estrous cycle on trait variability
There was no significant effect of sex/estrous cycle stage
on CV with a one-way ANOVA (F(3, 1061) = 2.199,
p = 0.0865; Fig. 5). Females did not differ from males
on any day of the estrous cycle nor did any of the
female groups differ from each other.
Impact of housing on trait variability
For the neurochemistry and behavior values, we also ex-
amined whether the housing conditions contributed to
the variability in trait data. As can be seen in Fig. 6,
there was no sex difference in the effect of housing con-
ditions on trait (F(1, 8266) = 0.4282, p = 0.5139). Overall,
Fig. 3 Histogram of distribution of CV ratios (female CV/(female
CV + male CV)). To examine whether the variance from the mean
was normally distributed for the different traits, we examined the
CV ratios. A value of 0.5 (indicated by the vertical black line)
would indicate that males and females are the same. Values to
the right of the vertical black line for each trait are values where
females are more variable than males. Values to the left of the
line indicate males are variable than females. **Males were more
variable on the E-Phys trait (p = 0.037) and the neurochemistry
trait (p = 0.0196). *Females were more variable than males on the
non-brain measures (p < 0.0001)
Fig. 4 CV values (STDEV/MEAN) for neurochemistry (top) and
histology (bottom) examined based on whether there was a sex
difference found for the paired male and female values. CV
values did not vary based on whether or not there was a sex
difference found. There were only 20 values from the histology
articles where a comparison between males and females was
not made, so those were excluded. SEM indicated by the lines
above the bars. NM not measured

 there was a main effect of housing conditions on trait
(F(3, 8266) = 6.175; p = 0.0003), but no sex by trait
interaction (F(3, 8266) = 0.4282; p = 0.5129). These ef-
fects do not change if the data from studies where hous-
ing conditions were not reported re excluded.
Impact of rat strain on trait variability
Lastly, we examined whether the strain of rat contrib-
uted to variability in data and whether there were effects
of sex on the CV; however, there was no effect of strain
on sex differences in CV (F(1, 12,382) = 0.0889, p =
0.765). Overall, male Sprague-Dawley rats were more
variable than male Wistar rats (two-way ANOVA; main
effect of strain: F(3, 12,382) = 3.941; p = 0.008; subse-

(see Fig. 7). There were no other effects of strain.
Discussion
These results indicate that among diverse traits relevant
to neuroscience, female rats are no more variable than
male rats. When the data are categorized by type of
information reported, some types of data have greater
intrinsic variability than others: behavioral data are more
variable than histology or neurochemistry data, for ex-
ample; but females and males did not differ in this regard.
Thus some types of neuroscience tests may yield more
precise, or less variable, data values, but this does not dif-
fer by sex. An important and novel aspect of this analysis
is that, there were no sex differences evident when males
were compared with (1) either randomly cycling females
or (2) females at specific, defined stages of the estrous
cycle. Moreover, females did not exhibit greater variability
at any stage of the estrous cycle, compared with males or
with females at other estrous cycle stages.
It is important to note that trait variability was not
greater for females or males even when there was a
significant sex difference in the mean value reported in
the studies analyzed. A significant difference between
the sexes on a given measure does not mean that fe-
males are more variable than males. What our findings
mean is that it is possible to see sex differences in
neuroscience studies when equal numbers of male and
female rats are used.
There was greater variability among females in the
“non-brain” category. Upon further analysis, three of the
four defined sub-categories of “non-brain” exhibited no
difference whatsoever between males and females. For
one indistinct sub-category with a relatively small sam-
ple size, there was greater variability in females. Thus,
there will be instances where females are more variable
than males.

 Recently, Itoh and Arnold [9] conducted a meta-
analysis of 103 human microarray datasets and 190
mouse microarray datasets to examine gene expression
variability in males and females. The results indicated
that variability was similar for females and males in
humans and in mice and no evidence that female gene
expression was more variable than male gene expression
in either species. The present report extends the study
of sex differences in variability to a species that is widely
used in neuroscience and documents the overall absence
of sex differences in variability across diverse traits of
interest to neuroscientists.
Conclusions
In conclusion, female rats are not more variable than
male rats in neuroscience research. Across a substan-
tially large sampling of research, the data indicate that
on average, females exhibit the same (or less) variability
on a given trait that male rats do. One implication of
these data is that for those investigators initiating re-
search on female rats, power calculations based on data
from males would likely be sufficient to determine the
number of female subjects needed in order to see a sex
difference. There will be particular topics where well-
documented effects of the estrous cycle should be con-
sidered by investigators in the experimental design in
order to get meaningful results. In all datasets, there ex-
ists a distribution of CV ratios; thus one single trait may
be more variable in males than females (or vice versa).
On the other hand, for topics where females have not
been studied, these data suggest that inclusion of intact
females, without regard to estrous cycle, and intact
males is a valid approach to learn about females in
neuroscience research.
