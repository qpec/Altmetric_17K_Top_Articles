Abstract
Introduction—X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a devastating pediatric disease 
caused by the absence of the protein myotubularin, results from mutations in the MTM1 gene. 
While there is no cure for XLMTM, we previously reported effects of MTM1 gene therapy using 
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector on muscle weakness and pathology in MTM1-mutant dogs. 
Here, we followed 2 AAV-infused dogs over 4 years.
Methods—We evaluated gait, strength, respiration, neurological function, muscle pathology, 
AAV vector copy number (VCN), and transgene expression.

 Results—Four years following AAV-mediated gene therapy, gait, respiratory performance, 
neurological function and pathology in AAV-infused XLMTM dogs remained comparable to their 
healthy littermate controls despite a decline in VCN and muscle strength.
Discussion—AAV-mediated gene transfer of MTM1 in young XLMTM dogs results in long-
term expression of myotubularin transgene with normal muscular performance and neurological 
function in the absence of muscle pathology. These findings support a clinical trial in patients.
INTRODUCTION
X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is the most common of the centronuclear 
myopathies; it is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 male births.1–3 The disease is caused by 
mutation of the MTM1 gene,4,5 and affected boys develop severe weakness of skeletal 
muscles due to a deficiency of the protein myotubularin.4,6 XLMTM presents at birth as 
marked hypotonia and respiratory impairment and is often fatal in the first year of life.7,8 
This myopathy affects primarily males, except in cases where there is skewed X-
inactivation.9,10 While there are instances of spontaneous occurrence, MTM1 mutations are 
often inherited from asymptomatic carrier mothers.11 The most severely affected boys 
become wheelchair dependent, however, a subset of patients with a milder form of the 
disease have been reported.12,13 These patients can survive until adulthood and have been 
known to remain ambulatory for a longer period of time.8,14 In Labrador retriever and mixed 
breed dogs, a p.N155K missense mutation in canine MTM1 results in profound skeletal 
muscle weakness in affected puppies analogous to the phenotype seen in boys with 
XLMTM.15,16 XLMTM dogs experience weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles, causing 
difficulty with standing, eating, and respiratory function.17–20 The average lifespan of 
affected animals is 18–20 weeks of age.15,21,18 Analogous to human patients, carrier female 
dogs are phenotypically normal.16
As XLMTM is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene, AAV-mediated gene replacement 
therapy is under intense investigation. We previously found that a direct intramuscular 
injection of AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) carrying a normal copy of the canine MTM1 gene to 
the cranial tibialis muscle of MTM1-mutant dogs restored strength of the injected limb 
muscle to near-normal, but contiguous non-injected limb muscles remained weakened 
without a commensurate improvement in overall walking gait.22 Compared to normal dogs, 
XLMTM dogs averaged a 46% reduction in gait speed and a 68% decrease in stride length 
near the end of their lifespan at 18 weeks.23 We concluded from these findings that 
intramuscular AAV resulted in marked strength improvement of a single paw flexor, the 
cranial tibialis, but targeted improvement in a single limb muscle alone is not sufficient to 
result in overall gait improvement.24 In contrast, transvenous limb perfusion, where the limb 
is isolated before administration of high-pressure perfusion, allows for AAV infusion of the 
entire lower limb musculature.25 Dogs treated this way demonstrated improved hind limb 
strength in the infused limb after treatment, but probably due to leak of AAV into the 
systemic circulation, effects were seen well beyond the isolated hindlimb muscles.22 This 
quasi-systemic delivery resulted in improved strength in contralateral untreated hindlimbs, 
improved respiratory function, and increased lifespan. These previous data suggested that, 
unlike a single targeted intramuscular injection, whole body transduction by AAV leads to

 overall improvement in walking gait in MTM1 mutant dogs. To address the question of 
long-term duration of systemic AAV delivery, we performed a battery of physiological, 
clinical, and biochemical analysis over a period of 4 years in AAV-treated XLMTM dogs.
Spatiotemporal measures of gait using two-dimensional video-based analysis are sensitive to 
changes caused by disease, as we published in XLMTM dogs.23 Quantitative gait analysis 
established the effects of limb muscle impairment due to neuromuscular disease26 in studies 
of canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).27,28 Video-based kinematic 
analysis detects changes in range of motion (ROM) due to disease in canine models of 
neuromuscular disease.27 However, kinematic analysis can be time intensive and requires 
extensive training for appropriate accuracy. Equipment set-up, including camera placement 
and frame rate, can also affect accuracy and precision.29,30 Given that measures of ROM are 
not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between XLMTM dogs and normal controls,23 an 
instrumented carpet provides an alternate method for assessing gait function. The system has 
been validated for use in dogs, is relatively easy to use in a reproducible fashion, and allows 
for quantification of some spatiotemporal measures unavailable with two-dimensional 
analysis, such as step width.31,30
In this study, our technical aim was to compare spatiotemporal measures from a video-based 
motion analysis with data collected using an instrumented carpet. We anticipated good 
agreement between methods, as both are validated approaches to quantify gait. Support of 
this idea would further justify the use of the more efficient instrumented walkway to 
quantify meaningful gait changes in the canine model of XLMTM. Our clinical aim was to 
compare gait between XLMTM dogs treated with a single intravenous infusion of AAV8-
MTM1 to control dogs over a two-year time period to test the hypothesis that treatment of 
XLMTM dogs preserves gait function over time. This longitudinal assessment of function in 
the preclinical model of XLMTM is particularly informative, as gait function may indicate 
the overall duration of gene replacement therapy. This could inform expected patient 
outcomes and future treatment strategies upon translation to the clinic.
We report here the long-term follow-up of two dogs initially treated by loco-regional (quasi-
systemic) perfusion with AAV8-MTM1.22 In addition to gait assessment using the 
instrumented carpet, we used assessment methods from previously published experiments to 
monitor the dogs’ health 4 years post-infusion with AAV8-MTM1.32 These assessments 
included muscle strength, neurological function, respiratory effort, and histological and 
molecular examination of muscle biopsies.19,20
METHODS
Dogs
Care and use of all laboratory animals was in keeping with the National Research Council 
guidelines and as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 
XLMTM dogs (N=2) were identified after birth by Taqman genotyping assay.15 Two groups 
were evaluated. For short-term assessment, XLMTM dogs (N=2) named, “Pavlov” and 
“Turing”, were measured prior to treatment at 8 weeks of age (T8w) and then every 4 weeks 
post-treatment (T12w and T16w) until 21 weeks of age (T21w) alongside wildtype male

 controls (N=2). For the long-term assessment, XLMTM dogs were measured 1 (T1y), 2 
(T2y), 3 (T3y), and 4 (T4y) years after treatment as compared to normal carrier females (N=3 
at 1 and 2 years) (N=2 at 3 and 4 years). All dogs used in the study were true littermates. 
Hindlimb length was recorded in anesthetized dogs with the limb against a flat surface at all 
time points excluding the last at 2 years after treatment, where measures were taken in 
awake, recumbent animals with the aid of a handler.
Treatment
XLMTM dogs were treated at 9 weeks of age via isolated limb perfusion as previously 
described.22 Briefly, a tourniquet was applied to the left hindlimb, and a single dose of 
AAV8-MTM1 (2.5 × 1013 vg/kg) was injected into the saphenous vein under high pressure.
Gait assessment
Dogs walked on a 0.9m × 7m instrumented carpet (GAITRite Electronic Walkway, CIR 
Systems Inc.) at 6 time points, 8-, 12- 16-, and 21 weeks of age (comparison with wild type 
male controls), as well as at 1 and 2 years after treatment (comparison with carrier female 
controls). A trained handler walked alongside leashed dogs in alternating directions parallel 
to the instrumented carpet at the dog’s self-selected pace. Food reward, praise, or squeaker 
toys were used as encouragement. Walks were selected based on consistency of gait pattern 
and speed and were analyzed using proprietary software (GAITFour version 4.1, CIR 
Systems Inc). Gait analysis with the instrumented carpet provided measures of gait speed, 
stride length, stride time, step length, step time, and stance time. These parameters were 
evaluated as outcome measures likely to display changes over time due to disease 
progression or subsequent recovery as a result of treatment.23
Video motion capture data were simultaneously recorded in the middle 2.4 meters of the 
instrumented carpet in front of a dark cloth backdrop at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. As 
previously described,23 retro-reflective tape was placed on the greater trochanter of the 
femur, a point equidistant between the lateral epicondyle of the femur and the fibular head, 
the lateral malleolus of the distal tibia, and the distolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsus. A 
spotlight was used during video capture for maximal marker brightness. Video was filmed 
with a single camera (DCR-SX63, Sony, Japan) at 30 Hz. The quality of videos was assessed 
based on consistency of the gait pattern and straightness of the head, body, and the walking 
path trajectory. Videos were digitized with MaxTRAQ software (Standard version 2.2.4.2) 
and exported to Visual 3D (C-Motion, Inc., Germantown, USA). Markers were filtered with 
a second-order bidirectional lowpass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 4 Hz, and 
heel-strike and toe-off events were identified for calculation of spatiotemporal measures 
across strides. Gait analysis with video motion capture provided measures of gait speed, 
stride length, and stride time.
Analysis
To compare spatiotemporal measures by the different gait analysis methods, the correlation 
between stride length and stride time using video motion capture and the instrumented 
carpet was calculated at the 16-week time point. This time point was selected due to the 
larger number of useful walks. At earlier time points, the young age of dogs, less experience

 with leash training, and smaller size of the dogs reduced the quality of video digitization. To 
compare gait data between XLMTM and control dogs, spatiotemporal parameters collected 
from the instrumented carpet were evaluated longitudinally and reported as means and 
standard deviations. Where relevant, measures outside of the 95% confidence intervals are 
indicated as deviations from control values in lieu of statistical comparisons with P-
values.33,34
Strength Assessment
We followed our published protocols for dogs.35 Briefly, hindlimb torque values were 
measured in anesthetized dogs by placing the foot of the dog on a pedal that was attached to 
a motor that provides resistance to the extending or flexing muscle while also measuring the 
amount of torque produced by said muscle. The muscle was then stimulated using 
percutaneously inserted electrodes over a range of stimulation frequencies to determine 
torque-frequency relationships. Year 3 assessments were performed on the left limbs, and 
year 4 assessments were performed on the right.
Pulmonary Function
Respiratory assessment was carried out in anesthetized dogs before and after stimulation by 
a centrally acting stimulant, doxapram hydrochloride (1 mg/kg), as described. 36–38 Briefly, 
data were collected in intubated dogs using a calibrated pneumotachometer, where changes 
in pressure across the device determined airflow. Flow-volume loops were created by 
replaying experimental data through the appropriate analyzer (iox 2.8.0.13, EMKA 
Technologies) and capturing 10 consecutive breaths during doxapram stimulation. Software 
(EMKA Technologies) calculated peak inspiratory flow (PIF), peak expiratory flow (PEF), 
inspired volume (IV), expired volume (EV), inspiratory time (TI), and expiratory time (TE).
Neurological Function
A neurological assessment score (NAS) was assigned to each dog by a board-certified 
veterinary neurologist (JMS) as described39. Parameters assessed included: cranial nerve 
function, postural reactions, segmental spinal reflexes, gait stride length, ability to run and 
jump, and muscle atrophy. Dogs were observed for exercise intolerance or increased 
respiratory rate and effort following activity. The presence or absence of a dropped jaw 
(inability to hold the jaw in a closed position) was also noted. Following each examination, a 
neurological severity score was assigned on a scale of 10 to 1, with 10 indicating a normal 
examination and 1 indicating inability to maintain sternal recumbency. However, 
predetermined humane euthanasia criteria were usually met by an NAS score of 3. Results 
of neurological scoring for normal controls and for some untreated XLMTM dogs have been 
reported 39.
Histology
Muscle samples were collected and processed as described previously.40 Tissues from the 
vastus lateralis, cranialis tibilialis, and biceps brachii were collected from both wild-type 
control dogs and AAV8-MTM1 infused dogs. Muscle histology was performed based on 
staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide

 (NADH), and ATPase stain performed at pH 9.4. Slides were evaluated by a board-certified 
anatomic pathologist and neuropathologist (M.W.L.) with respect to the full range of 
possible pathologies. Muscle tissue (vastus lateralis) was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 
processed at the Medical College of Wisconsin electron microscopy (EM) Core Facility and 
evaluated at each time point using a standard approach previously described.22,41 
Comprehensive reports of pathological findings at the light and EM level were prepared 
using an adaptation of the NINDS Common Data Elements muscle biopsy reporting form. 42
Vector copy number and transgene expression
The number of vector genomes per diploid genome (VCN) was quantified from 32 ng of 
total DNA by Taqman real-time PCR using a Light Cycler 480 (Roche). The canine β-
glucuronidase gene was used for standardization. Primers used for vector genome 
amplification were: 5′-GCCTCGCCCGGACTCTA-3′ (forward), 5′-
CTCAGGATCGGTGACCAGAGA-3′ (reverse) and 5′-AGGATCCAGATCTAAGC-3′ 
(probe). Primers and probe used for β-glucuronidase amplification were: 5′-
ACGCTGATTGCTCACACCAA-3′ (forward), 5′-CCCCAGGTCTGCTTCATAGTTG-3′ 
(reverse) and 5′-CCCGGCCCGTGACCTTTGTGA-3′ (probe) (Applied Biosystems).
Immunoblotting
Proteins were extracted from tissues using a lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 4 mM 
sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL, and a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail 
(Roche Applied Science), and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (NuPage Novex 4–12% BisTris gels, Invitrogen) and western blotting as 
previously described (6). Membranes were probed with a polyclonal antibody against the C-
terminus of canine myotubularin (R1040, Genethon) and a mouse monoclonal antibody 
against GAPDH (MAB374, Millipore) as internal control. Detection was performed with a 
secondary antibody coupled to IRDye 680 (LI-COR) and the Odyssey infrared imaging 
system (LI-COR Biotechnology Inc.).
RESULTS
Dog demographics
XLMTM dogs had lower average body weights prior to treatment at 8 weeks of age (4.7 kg) 
as compared to their wildtype littermates (6.4 kg) despite being close in size as measured by 
hindlimb length (XLMTM, 12.6 cm; wildtype controls, 13.5 cm; Table 1). By 16 weeks of 
age, XLMTM and wildtype control dogs were of similar mass and sizes, with mean weight 
of 10.9 kg and limb length of 16.6 cm for XLMTM dogs, and mean weight of 10.4 kg and 
limb length of 17.3 cm for wildtype control animals. XLMTM and carrier control dogs also 
demonstrated comparable weights and hindlimb lengths at 1 and 2 years of age (Table 1). At 
1 year, mean weight was 13.6 kg for XLMTM dogs and 14.1 (1.2) kg for carrier controls, 
and mean hindlimb length was 17.9 cm for XLMTM dogs and 17.3 (1.1) cm for carrier 
controls. At 2 years, mean weight was 21.0 kg for XLMTM dogs and 22.0 (2.5) kg for 
carrier controls, and mean hindlimb lengths were 18.5 cm for XLMTM dogs and 17.5 (0.4) 
cm for carrier controls. At 3 years, the mean weight was 18 kg for XLMTM dogs and 15 kg

 for carrier controls, and mean hindlimb lengths were 18 cm for XLMTM dogs and 15 cm for 
carrier controls. By 4 years, XLMTM dogs demonstrated greater body weight (22 vs. 18 kg) 
with longer hindlimb lengths (18.4 vs. 17 cm) compared to their age-matched carrier 
controls (Table 1).
Comparison of longitudinal gait changes in AAV-infused XLMTM and control dogs over 4 
years
To evaluate effects of AAV on limb function and mobility, gait was evaluated while dogs 
walked over an instrumented carpet to capture spatiotemporal data. Four years after infusion 
with AAV8-MTM1, XLMTM dogs demonstrated walking gait speed and stride lengths 
comparable to age-matched control dogs (Figure 1). Prior to infusion, gait speed in XLMTM 
dogs was slightly reduced at 8 weeks of age, where XLMTM dogs walked 7% more slowly 
than control dogs (Table 2). However, following AAV infusion XLMTM dogs walked at 
speeds comparable to controls at 12, 16, and 21 weeks of age. Gait speed was maintained in 
XLMTM dogs over 4 years after treatment. In normal carriers, gait speed was 20% faster 
than XLMTM dogs at 1 year, but XLMTM gait speed was comparable to controls at 2, 3, 
and 4 years after treatment (Figure 1A, Table 2). After 3 years post-infusion, XLMTM dogs 
exhibited 10% and 0.03% slower gait speeds, respectively compared to age-matched 
controls. Four years post-infusion, both XLMTM dogs demonstrated 4% faster gait speeds 
when compared to their age-matched controls.
Stride lengths in XLMTM dogs were 16% shorter than controls at 10 weeks of age but were 
comparable to controls at all other time points as measured by the instrumented carpet 
(Table 2). Two years after treatment, XLMTM dogs demonstrated 10% longer strides than 
control dogs (Table 2). At 3 years after treatment, XLMTM dogs had 3% and 1% longer 
strides, respectively, than control dogs. At 4 years after treatment, 1 XLMTM dog had 2% 
shorter strides, while the other demonstrated 10% longer strides compared to controls (Table 
2).
Respiratory function in AAV-infused XLMTM dogs compared to controls
To test for effects of AAV on respiratory function, we evaluated airflow exchange in 
anesthetized dogs. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) velocity appears comparable between AAV-
treated XLMTM and normal controls over time (Figure 2). PIF velocity for the AAV-infused 
dog, Pavlov, remained lower than both the controls and the AAV-infused dog, Turing. Year 1 
assessments show that Pavlov’s PIF value was approximately 35% less than the average PIF 
for the normal controls; this difference decreased to 22% at the 3-year assessment. During 
the 4-year assessment, Pavlov’s PIF was 133% greater than the controls and increased 286% 
when compared to his year 3 average PIF. Turing’s PIF values at the 1-year assessment were 
approximately 3% less than the controls, however his values surpassed the controls at years 
3 and 4.
Neurological function in AAV-infused XLMTM dogs remain at near-normal levels after 4 
years
To measure changes in neurological function, we used a validated clinical scoring instrument 
developed for dogs, the Neurological Assessment Score (NAS). Results indicate that 2 and 3

 years post-infusion, both XLMTM treated dogs achieved scores identical to controls; at 4 
years one of the AAV-infused dogs (Turing) declined by 1 point (Figure 3).
Limb Strength in AAV-infused XLMTM dogs approaches normal function 4 years post-
infusion
To measure strength, in vivo isometric flexion torque was repeatedly measured in the hind 
limbs of anesthetized dogs (Figure 4). Hindlimb flexion torque values for AAV-treated 
XLMTM dogs were greater than saline-infused dogs at 9- and 17 weeks, and generally 
comparable with WT controls at most time points up to 3 years. At the 4 year assessment, 
torque values of AAV-treated XLMTM dogs dropped to about half values of WT controls. 
Overall, hindlimb flexion torque data indicate that following AAV infusion, strength in 
XLMTM dogs was maintained comparable to normal age-matched controls for 3 years then 
began to decline.
Muscle pathology in AAV-infused XLMTM dogs is absent 4 years following treatment
To examine effects of AAV on muscle pathology, a blinded neuropathologist examined 
biopsies from the vastus lateralis, cranial tibialis, and biceps brachii muscles. H&E staining 
of XLMTM dogs treated with AAV could not be distinguished from normal controls in 
almost all sampled muscles (Figure 5), with the exception of the 4 year, biceps brachii 
muscle of Turing. This specimen displayed myofiber smallness, internal nucleation, and 
organelle mislocalization consistent with XLMTM in a subset of fibers, and these changes 
were not apparent in the 3-year biopsy from the same muscle.43 In other sampled muscles 
from WT and XLMTM dogs, there was no evidence of organelle mislocalization or 
pathological myofiber smallness or internal nucleation. There were also occasional small 
fibers present in all dogs, consistent with our observation of the skeletal muscle histology of 
non-diseased dogs in this colony in prior studies.43,22 There was no evidence of 
inflammation, myonecrosis, myophagocytosis, myofiber regeneration, endomysial fibrosis, 
or fatty infiltration. Electron microscopy of sampled muscles revealed easily identifiable 
triad structures in both WT and XLMTM dog muscles, and animal genotype could not be 
distinguished on the basis of EM findings (not shown). Overall, the findings are consistent 
with a near-total reversal of XLMTM pathology at 3 and 4 years post-treatment, with a 
possible waning of pathological recovery in the biceps brachii from Turing at 4 years post-
treatment.
AAV vector and transgene expression
We analyzed VCN from muscle biopsies taken in anesthetized XLMTM dogs. Data over 4 
years show an overall consistent decrease of VCN (Figure 6). The control group remained 
below the limit of detection at all time points. Myotubularin transgene expression 
(Supplemental Figure S1, available online) generally reflected VCN in immunoblot images. 
Whereas no detectable myotubularin expression bands could be seen in any XLMTM dog 
infused with saline, clearly defined bands could be seen in muscle lysates taken from biceps, 
cranial tibialis, and vastus muscles 4 years post-infusion with AAV.

 DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that a single infusion of recombinant AAV serotype 8 carrying a 
canine MTM1 gene driven by a desmin promoter can preserve and maintain limb function 
over 4 years in a large animal model of a congenital myopathy. Our findings in the p.N155K 
canine XLMTM model further suggest that MTM1 gene replacement using AAV8 in young 
patients might similarly lead to sustained preservation of muscle strength and neurologic 
function. Our recent report of AAV8 experiments in this canine model should inform future 
clinical trials with respect to dosing and timing of AAV infusion.32
The technical aim of our study addressed the comparison of spatiotemporal measures with 
the more time-intensive video-based motion capture analysis. Our results indicate a high 
correlation between measures of stride length from both video-based motion analysis 
simultaneous assessment with an instrumented carpet. Correlations were lower for stride 
time, despite similar values. This may be due to the small sample size as well as technical 
aspects of the video motion capture. The video motion capture in this case had relatively low 
temporal resolution, with a low frame rate for video capture. As stride time values are 
relatively small, even slight differences will reduce correlation. Both the instrumented carpet 
and 2-dimensional video motion capture are validated methods of quantifying 
spatiotemporal parameters of gait in canines.44,45,30 Unlike the instrumented carpet, video 
motion capture can also be used to assess kinematic or angular joint movements. With 
modification, video motion capture can be expanded to assess bilateral movements in 3-
dimensional space to provide additional information on spatiotemporal and kinematic 
aspects of gait. However, video capture requires a large space to accommodate and correctly 
position the multiple cameras needed for appropriate capture volumes. Set up and analysis of 
the carpet is simpler, requires less training, and is largely automated, which allows rapid and 
reliable assessment of several animals with fewer resources. In contrast, multiple types of 
software may be necessary to convert, digitize, and analyze video capture data, resulting in 
more time-intensive data processing and increase potential for loss of data integrity. As there 
is limited additional value of hindlimb angular kinematic measurements in the XLMTM 
dog,23 the instrumented carpet is our preferred method. However, for canine models where 
changes in joint angles are observed due to disease, such as the golden retriever muscular 
dystrophy model,27 kinematic analysis at a higher resolution using motion capture methods 
may be preferable.
We previously reported that XLMTM dogs walk more slowly that their normal control 
littermates. They experienced a 13% decrease in speed at 10 weeks of age, and a decrease of 
46% of normal by the time of humane euthanasia at 17 weeks of age.23 Strides were also 
reduced to 86% of normal at 10 weeks of age and 68% of normal by the terminal endpoint.23 
However, normal gait involves the concerted effort of several limb muscles to maintain 
stability and support as the disease advances. In this study, we found that, while XLMTM 
dogs walk more slowly and with shorter strides prior to receiving AAV8-MTM1, whole 
body gene replacement therapy is associated with improved and maintained speed and stride 
length over 2 years, indicating preserved ambulation and limb function. This is in keeping 
with increased limb muscle strength and improvements in myofiber size, myotubularin 
expression, and in histology, particularly the sarcotubular organization in hindlimb muscles,

 such as the quadriceps and biceps.22 As upper limb function is of particular concern to 
patients, similar changes in the forelimbs are also encouraging,22 and strength and functional 
assessment separate from the hindlimb in the future may be useful.
In summary, our findings indicate that AAV-mediated gene replacement can preserve normal 
muscle and neurological function in a large animal model of XLMTM, a congenital 
myopathy for which there is currently no effective clinical therapy. An instrumented carpet 
can be useful to monitor effectiveness of investigational gene replacement on limb function 
in this model.

 Figure 5. Pathological features of XLMTM muscle
Pathological features of XLMTM muscle remain dramatically improved in AAV8-MTM1 
treated canines at 1, 3, and 4 years post-treatment. Features of XLMTM muscle pathology in 
untreated XLMTM canines at 22 weeks are shown (XLMTM, top left). The Wild Type 
condition illustrates normal histopathological features, including appropriate fiber size and 
peripherally located nuclei on H&E staining and an even distribution of organelles on 
NADH staining. The XLMTM Untreated condition illustrates histopathological findings 
typical for canine XLMTM, including myofiber hypertrophy, internally nucleated myofibers, 
and organelle mislocalization (clustering of organelles at the center and periphery of 
myofibers on NADH staining). A single infusion of AAV8-MTM1 resulted in correction of 
fiber size, nuclear placement, and organelle localization at 1, 3, and 4 years post-treatment.

 Figure 6. AAV vector copy number over time
XLMTM dogs show steady decreases in vector genome (VG)/diploid genome values over 4 
years after a single infusion of AAV8-MTM1 vector. Normal indicates wildtype (non-
infused) control samples. The dashed horizontal line indicates the lowest standard recorded 
(0.0176VG/diploid genome); Values beneath the dashed line are below the lowest standard.
