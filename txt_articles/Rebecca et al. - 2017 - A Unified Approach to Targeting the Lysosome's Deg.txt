ABSTRACT 
 
Lysosomes serve dual roles in cancer metabolism, executing catabolic programs 
(i.e., autophagy and macropinocytosis) while promoting mTORC1-dependent 
anabolism. Antimalarial compounds such as chloroquine or quinacrine have been used as lysosomal 
inhibitors, but fail to inhibit mTOR signaling. Further, the molecular target of these agents has not 
been identifi
 ed. We report a screen of novel dimeric antimalarials that identifi
 es dimeric quinacrines 
(DQ) as potent anticancer compounds, which concurrently inhibit mTOR and autophagy. Central nitro-
gen methylation of the DQ linker enhances lysosomal localization and potency. An  
in situ photoaffi
 n-
ity pulldown identifi
 ed palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) as the molecular target of DQ661. 
PPT1 inhibition concurrently impairs mTOR and lysosomal catabolism through the rapid accumulation 
of palmitoylated proteins. DQ661 inhibits the  
in vivo 
 tumor growth of melanoma, pancreatic cancer, 
and colorectal cancer mouse models and can be safely combined with chemotherapy. Thus, lysosome-
directed PPT1 inhibitors represent a new approach to concurrently targeting mTORC1 and lysosomal 
catabolism in cancer. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifi
 es chemical features of dimeric compounds that increase their 
lysosomal specifi
 city, and a new molecular target for these compounds, reclassifying these compounds 
as targeted therapies. Targeting PPT1 blocks mTOR signaling in a manner distinct from catalytic 
inhibitors, while concurrently inhibiting autophagy, thereby providing a new strategy for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The lysosome is the only organelle that can degrade 
other organelles and proteins due to its acid-dependent 
degradative enzymes. Because of this specialized function, 
lysosomes receive cargo via multiple pathways, including 
macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter) and macropino-
cytosis, which allow for scavenging of intracellular and 
extracellular nutrients, respectively ( 
1 
). Autophagy and 
macropinocytosis are both regulated by mTORC1 ( 
2 
). In 
turn, the lysosome membrane directly regulates mTORC1 
by housing key mTOR regulators. The pentameric Ragula-
tor protein complex resides on the lysosomal surface and 
serves as a docking site for RAG GTPases. When amino acids 
(AA) are present, RAG GTPases directly recruit mTORC1 to 
the lysosomal surface ( 
3, 4 
), where it can be fully activated 
by RHEB ( 
5 
). Therefore, the lysosome serves critical cata-
bolic and growth-signaling roles. 
 
Aberrant autophagic–lysosomal activity ( 
6 
) and dysregu-
lated mTORC1 signaling ( 
7 
) allow tumor cells to resist the 
stresses of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. However, 
attempts to address these intertwined protumorigenic mech-
anisms independently have produced few durable responses 
in the clinic ( 
8, 9 
). The combination of a rapamycin deriva-
tive with the lysosome inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 
has been tested clinically with an encouraging safety profi
 le. 
However, response rates were low, and pharmacokinetic (PK)–
pharmacodynamic (PD) studies performed in patients receiv-
ing the highest FDA-allowed dosage of HCQ demonstrated 
only modest autophagy inhibition ( 
10 
). Furthermore, the 
mechanism underlying how chloroquine (CQ) derivatives 
inhibit autophagy–lysosome function remains unclear. These 
results underscore the need to develop more potent lysoso-
mal inhibitors and to defi
 ne the molecular target responsible 
for lysosomal inhibition. 
 
We previously reported Lys05, a dimeric CQ that is 
10-fold more potent than monomeric CQ derivatives ( 
11 
). 
Given the recent appreciation of the lysosomal regulation 
of mTORC1, we hypothesized that more potent and spe-
cifi
 c inhibitors of the lysosome could concurrently inhibit 
lysosomal catabolism and mTORC1 signaling. Toward this

goal, we modified the Lys05 structure, ultimately yielding 
a series of potent dimeric quinacrines (DQ). We find that 
methylation of the central nitrogen of the linker affects DQ 
subcellular localization and enhances DQ function against 
autophagy. This approach has led to the identification of a 
class of compounds that can be targeted specifically to the 
lysosome. Using these more potent and lysosome-specific 
inhibitors, we have identified the molecular target of DQ 
as palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), resulting in the 
impairment of mTOR signaling via disruption of the inter-
action between mTORC1 and its master activator RHEB, 
even in the setting of AA-replete medium. The concurrent 
inhibition of mTORC1 and lysosomal catabolism, one of 
the key resistance mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors, 
leads to a more complete abrogation of protein transla-
tion and anticancer activity relative to what is achievable 
with allosteric or catalytic mTORC1 inhibitors. Our find-
ings reveal an unanticipated role of PPT1 in regulating 
both autophagy and mTORC1 localization and activity 
 
in cancer.
RESULTS
DQ Has Superior Anticancer Efficacy among 
Dimeric Antimalarials
In an effort to improve the activity of Lys05, we extended 
the triamine linker of Lys05 using the naturally occurring 
triamine spermidine. The anticancer activity of the result-
ing compound, DC340, the name of which was derived as 
described below, was assessed in BRAF-mutant melanoma 
and KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines, as cancers 
driven by these oncogenes depend on autophagy/lysosome 
function (12, 13). DC340 inhibited the growth of a panel of 
melanoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines significantly bet-
ter than Lys05 (Fig. 1A and B). We next developed a series of 
dimeric compounds linked by the spermidine linker, whereby 
the 7-chloroquinoline heterocycles of CQ were replaced with 
the heterocyclic rings present in other antimalarials, such as 
primaquine (PQ), mefloquine (MQ), and quinacrine (QN; 
 
Fig. 1A). We describe these resulting novel structures as 
dimeric CQ (DC), dimeric MQ (DM), dimeric PQ (DP), or 
dimeric QN (DQ), followed by three digits (m, n, R), where 
m and n signify the number of carbons to the left and right 
of the central nitrogen of the triamine linker, respectively, 
and the R signifies whether the central nitrogen of the linker 
is methylated (1) or not (0; Fig. 1A). Antiproliferative activ-
ity was improved between 3- and 10-fold for each dimeric 
compound that contained CQ, MQ, or PQ, relative to its 
monomeric parent. In contrast, dimerization of QN resulted 
in ≥60-fold improvement in antiproliferative activity relative 
to monomeric QN (Fig. 1C).
We next generated a focused library of DQs with triamine 
linkers of increasing length, ranging from 2 to 11 carbons 
between the 9-aminoacridine and the central nitrogen of the 
triamine linker. Both unmethylated (R = 0) and methylated 
 
(R = 1) derivatives of each analogue were prepared to determine 
the role of central nitrogen methylation on biological activity. 
Treatment of A375P and PANC1 cells with this DQ library fur-
ther established the superior antiproliferative potency of DQs 
compared with their monomeric counterpart (QN; Fig. 1D; 
 
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although DQ221, the acridine 
dimer with the same linker as Lys05 (DC221 using this 
nomenclature system), showed the same potency as its cor-
responding monomer with no benefit from dimerization, a 
clear relationship between linker length and potency emerged 
among the DQs with increasing linker length, whereby DQs 
with 3 to 6 carbons between linker nitrogens possessed sig-
nificant antiproliferative potency. Further extension of the 
distance between the two QN heterocycles resulted in incre-
mentally decreased antiproliferative activity (Fig. 1D; Sup-
plementary Fig. S1A). Pharmacologic agents that specifically 
inhibit autophagy, such as Spautin-1, which promotes deg-
radation of Beclin (14), and SBI-0206965 (SBI), an unc-like 
kinase 1 (ULK1) inhibitor (14, 15), exhibited significantly less 
potency relative to DQs (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1A). 
The compounds in the series DQ330–DQ661 produce sig-
nificantly greater long-term growth suppression than mono-
meric QN and DQ221 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Unlike 
Spautin-1 and SBI, which did not induce appreciable levels 
of apoptosis, the majority of DQs trigger significantly greater 
levels of apoptosis, which directly correlates with increasing 
linker length, relative to monomeric QN (Fig. 1E).
Central Nitrogen Methylation Directs  
Subcellular Localization of DQs
We next interrogated the specificity of DQs as lysosomal 
inhibitors, as the parent monomer, QN, both binds to DNA 
in the nucleus and accumulates in the lysosome (16). The 
inherent fluorescence of DQs was exploited to study their 
subcellular localization. The most potent longer-linked DQs 
(DQ550, DQ551, DQ660, and DQ661) fluoresce in both the 
red and green channels, under both neutral (pH = 7) and 
acidic (pH = 4) conditions (Fig. 2A). Under neutral conditions, 
methylated DQs demonstrated increased green fluorescence 
compared with unmethylated DQs. However, there were no 
significant differences in red fluorescence observed between 
unmethylated and methylated DQs. Acidic conditions led 
to partial quenching of green fluorescence, but had minimal 
effects on red fluorescence in both methylated (DQ551 and 
DQ661) and unmethylated (DQ550 and DQ660) DQs. These 
findings indicate that red fluorescence is more effective to 
assess lysosomal localization of these compounds. Surpris-
ingly, each unmethylated DQ (DQ550 and DQ660) displayed 
no detectable red fluorescence, whereas each methylated DQ 
(DQ551 and DQ661) possessed strong red fluorescence in 
the lysosomal compartment (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. 
S2A). No colocalization with mitochondria was observed for 
DQ551 or DQ661 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). To rule out the 
possibility that the addition of a methyl group to the central 
nitrogen was simply increasing the basicity of the DQ, thereby 
trapping the methylated derivatives in the acidic lysosome, the 
pKa values of each DQ were calculated (Supplementary Table 
S1). This analysis demonstrated that the pKa of each pair of 
methylated and unmethylated DQ did not differ significantly, 
and therefore differential basicity could not account for the 
difference in subcellular localization. Having established 
the role of central nitrogen methylation as a determinant 
of lysosomal localization, we next characterized how DQs 
 
affect autophagy. Changes in autophagic vesicle (AV) levels 
were interrogated by measuring ATG8/LC3B (LC3I, LC3II

hereafter) protein levels, as LC3II is the most reliable protein 
marker of completed autophagosomes (17). Increasing DQ 
linker length was associated with increasing LC3II/LC3I ratios 
(Fig. 2C), reflecting an accumulation of AVs. Interestingly, 
there was also a relationship between central nitrogen meth-
ylation and LC3II/LC3I ratios, in which compounds with cen-
tral nitrogen methylation (DQXX1) had a significantly higher 
LC3II/LC3I ratio relative to their unmethylated (DQXX0) 
counterparts. Due to the inherent fluorescence of QN, spec-
tral overlap with mCherry-eGFP-LC3 expressing cells (18) 
prevented the use of this approach to characterize autophagic 
flux. The effects of these compounds on autophagic flux were 
therefore determined by a bafilomycin (baf) clamp experi-
ment (19). Treatment with DQs lacking central nitrogen 
methylation (DQXX0) resulted in a further increase in the 
LC3II/LC3I ratio in baf-treated cells compared with control

cells, confirming that all DQs lacking a centrally methyl-
ated nitrogen (DQXX0) significantly increase autophagic flux 
(Fig. 2D). In contrast, every DQ with central nitrogen methyla-
tion (DQXX1) did not demonstrate an increase in LC3II/LC3I 
ratio in baf-treated cells compared to control (Fig. 2D). This 
difference in autophagy modulation between unmethylated 
and methylated DQs was also evidenced by unmethylated 
DQs producing striking degradation of the autophagy sub-
strates p62 and NBR1, whereas treatment with methylated 
DQs did not (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data indicate 
that DQs without central nitrogen methylation function as 
autophagy inducers, whereas DQs with central nitrogen meth-
ylation modulate autophagy in a more pronounced fashion, 
acting as autophagy inhibitors. To further confirm that cen-
tral nitrogen methylation dictates subcellular localization of 
DQs, lysosomal fractionation was performed in cells treated 
with either DQ660 or DQ661. Quantification of DQ660 
and DQ661 concentrations in subcellular compartments 
revealed a 3.5-fold difference in the concentration of DQ661 
compared with DQ660 in lysosomal fractions (Fig. 2F).
DQs Cause Either Significant DNA Damage or 
Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization Depending 
on the Central Nitrogen Methylation Status
We next determined whether DQs cause DNA damage, 
because QN is known to intercalate DNA (20). A striking 
relationship between nitrogen methylation and DNA damage 
emerged, whereby unmethylated DQs induced significantly 
greater levels of DNA damage relative to their methylated 
counterparts (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the difference in DNA 
damage induced by unmethylated DQs versus the correspond-
ing methylated analogues increased with increasing linker 
length for each pair of compounds. The integrity of the lysoso-
mal membrane was interrogated by detection of lectin galacto-
side binding soluble 3 (LGALS3)/galectin-3 localization, which 
was recently demonstrated to rapidly translocate to dam-
aged lysosomes (21). When lysosomes are healthy, galectin-3 
is uniformly dispersed throughout the cell. However, when 
the lysosome is damaged, galectin-3 rapidly localizes to the 
site of damaged lysosomes, appearing as puncta. Only methyl-
ated DQs (DQXX1) caused lysosomal membrane permeabili-
zation (LMP), as seen by the formation of galectin-3+ puncta 
(Fig. 3B). The differential ability to induce LMP was further 
demonstrated by the observation of mature cathepsin D in the 
extralysosomal fraction of cells treated with DQ661 (Fig. 3C).
DQ661 emerged as the lead lysosomal inhibitor in this series 
of compounds, capable of most potently inducing DNA dam-
age–independent apoptosis, blocking autophagic flux, and 
triggering LMP. To determine the underlying mechanism of 
action of DQ661, treated cells were assayed for >290 proteins 
or phosphoproteins spanning key signaling programs com-
monly perturbed in cancer cells using reverse phase protein 
arrays (RPPA). The proteins most significantly and repro-
ducibly inhibited by DQ661 were downstream of mTORC1 
signaling (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S3A). These included 
reduced phosphorylation of PRAS40, p70S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1. 
Immunoblotting confirmed the RPPA results, i.e., the ability 
of DQ661 to inhibit autophagy and mTORC1 activity and 
to induce apoptosis in BRAFV600E, NRASQ61R, and BRAF WT/
NRASWT melanoma cell lines (Fig. 3E). To understand the 
kinetics of pathway inhibition, immunoblotting revealed that 
mTORC1 activity was inhibited within 30 minutes of treat-
ment with DQ661, before appreciable accumulation of AVs 
was observed, as seen by LC3 lipidation (Fig. 3F). Autophagy 
modulation and dephosphorylation of a number of mTOR 
target substrates was sustained even at the 24-hour time 
point. Cleavage of caspase-7 did not occur until mTORC1 and 
autophagy were both significantly inhibited. A kinetic analysis 
of LMP induction was also performed, revealing LMP does not 
occur until 2 to 4 hours after treatment with DQ661, suggest-
ing the rapid mTORC1 inhibition associated with DQ661 is 
independent of LMP (Fig. 3G). Further, Leu-Leu methyl ester 
hydrobromide (LloMe), a prototypical lysosomal membrane 
permeabilizing agent, did not inhibit mTORC1 activity at the 
30-minute time point when LloMe-induced LMP was clearly 
evident, demonstrating that DQ661-induced LMP is not 
responsible for mTOR inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
To determine whether the anti-mTORC1 activity of DQ661 
could be observed with other agents that impair lysosomal 
deacidification, produce LMP, or inhibit lysosomal enzymes, 
A375P cells were treated with either AA/serum starvation, 
aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, cysteine protease inhibi-
tor E64, Pepstatin A + E64, acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor 
siramesine (22), HSP70 inhibitors PES or PET (23), baf, or 
baf + DQ661 (Fig. 3H). Immunoblotting confirmed DQ661 
inhibits mTORC1 activity to a similar level as serum starvation 
and to a greater extent than any other lysosomal agent tested. 
PET inhibited S6K phosphorylation, but both PES and PET 
treatment led to the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Baf had 
minimal effects on phospho-S6K and produced hyperphospho-
rylation of 4E-BP1. DQ661 had the greatest ability to inhibit 
autophagy among the entire panel of lysosomal inhibitors, as 
seen by the greatest accumulation of the LC3II/LC3I ratio. At 
the doses and time points tested, DQ661 appears to be unique 
in its ability to inhibit both mTORC1 signaling and autophagy 
(Fig. 3H). In contrast to these effects observed with DQ661, 
RPPA data and Western blot analysis demonstrated that neither 
QC nor DQ660 had a significant impact on mTORC1 signaling 
at equimolar doses (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3C).
mTORC1 inhibition upregulates not only autophagy, but 
also macropinocytosis, a process by which nutrient-limited, 
Ras-driven cancer cells endocytose, envelop extracellular pro-
tein, and release AAs through lysosome-mediated degrada-
tion, paradoxically fueling growth of cancer cells (24). We next 
asked whether or not DQ661 would increase lysosomal catab-
olism of extracellular proteins because it inhibits mTORC1. 
We confirmed that DQ661 blocked autophagy and mTOR in 
G43 mouse pancreatic cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3D) 
derived from the LSL-KrasLSL-G12D/+, LSL-Trp53LSL-R172H/+, Pdx1-
Cre (KPC) mouse model (25). Neither torin-1 nor DQ661 
significantly changed the level of macropinocytic uptake of 
albumin in glutamine-limited G43 cells (Supplementary Fig. 
S3E). Torin-1 treatment significantly increased lysosomal 
degradation of externally supplied protein, as displayed by 
the unquenched fluorescence of DQ-BSA. In contrast, treat-
ment with DQ661 did not produce increased lysosomal deg-
radation of external proteins when G43 cells were grown in 
similar conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3E). Further, torin-1 
significantly increased the proliferation of glutamine-limited

G43 cells supplemented with 2% albumin, relative to cells 
grown in low glutamine with 2% albumin treated with vehicle 
control (Supplementary Fig. S3F). DQ661 decreased the pro-
liferation of G43 cells to the levels observed by cells cultured 
in low glutamine in the absence of 2% albumin.
To directly measure the effect of DQ661 on catabolism of 
extracellular protein by pancreatic cells, we devised an isotope 
tracer–based method to monitor protein scavenging. This 
method enables the separate quantification of (i) AAs added 
to the medium as monomers and (ii) AAs derived from degra-
dation of extracellular protein taken up by macropinocytosis. 
Another cell line derived from a KPC mouse tumor, KRPC-A, 
which is capable of robust proliferation despite AA deficiency 
in BSA-supplemented medium, was cultured in the medium 
containing fully 13C-labeled essential AAs for 5 doublings, such 
that intracellular protein and AAs in these cells were isotopically 
labeled. These cells were then switched to AA-free medium con-
taining 50 g/L BSA. Under these conditions, cells can substitute 
AA monomers with scavenged extracellular protein, but because 
BSA contains unequal levels of AAs relative to their cellular 
requirements, serum protein catabolism produces some of these 
AAs in excess of these requirements and secretes them into the 
medium, providing a quantitative readout for protein scaveng-
ing rate. Using this assay, we observe that DQ661 significantly 
inhibits protein scavenging in a dose-dependent fashion (Sup-
plementary Fig. S3G). Altogether, these results demonstrate that 
DQ661 is capable of blocking not only autophagy but also other 
lysosomal catabolic programs such as macropinocytosis.
PPT1 Is a Molecular Target of DQ661
Given that LMP did not explain the mTOR inhibition 
observed with DQ661, we leveraged the increased potency 
and lysosomal localization of DQ661 to perform an in situ 
chemical pulldown experiment, in order to find the putative 
molecular target of DQ661 within the lysosome (Fig. 4A). A 
photoprobe consisting of the DQ661 warhead attached to 
benzophenone (as a photoaffinity label), which was in turn 
covalently linked to desthiobiotin, was synthesized (Fig. 4B; 
see Methods for chemical strategy). Treatment of A375P 
cells with the DQ661 photoprobe produced accumulation of 
LC3II and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates 
in A375P cells, demonstrating that the photoprobe was cell-
permeable, localized to the lysosome, and retained activity 
(Fig. 4C). Next, A375P cells were treated with the DQ661 
photoprobe with or without UV irradiation and with or 
without competition with an excess of free DQ661 ligand 
immediately prior to UV irradiation. Cell lysis was followed 
by pulldown with neutravidin beads and elution with biotin. 
Eluents were subjected to proteomic analysis (see Methods). 
Candidate protein targets were identified using the criteria 
of proteins that had >10-fold intensity ratios of +UV/−UV 
and –competition/+competition samples (Fig. 4D). Of these 
15 proteins, cathepsin D and PPT1 had the highest signal 
intensity for the +UV sample. Unlike cathepsin D, however, 
treatment with DQ661 competition completely abrogated 
the ability of the photolabel probe to pulldown PPT1 as 
detected by MS. Immunoblotting against PPT1 in a separate 
experiment using the DQ661 photoprobe and 10× concentra-
tion of free DQ661 ligand as competition confirmed that the 
DQ661 photoprobe specifically bound to and could be UV 
conjugated to PPT1 in cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cath-
epsin D enzymatic activity was not significantly impaired in 
cell lysates from A375P cells treated with vehicle, DQ660, and 
DQ661 (Fig. 4E). In contrast DQ661, but not DQ660, signifi-
cantly impaired PPT1 enzymatic activity in cells (Fig. 4F). The 
inability to inhibit cathepsin D enzymatic activity demon-
strates the selectivity of DQ661 for PPT1, further supporting 
a specific rather than generic mechanism of action for DQ661 
in the lysosome. Finally, differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) of recombinant PPT1 protein in the absence or pres-
ence of a 4-fold molar excess of DQ661 revealed protein 
melting temperatures of 67.16°C and 64.60°C, respectively 
(Fig. 4G). This statistically significant difference of >2.5°C in 
protein melting temperature, as a function of added DQ661, 
is consistent with direct DQ661 binding to PPT1.
PPT1 is the only lysosomal enzyme that cleaves thioester 
bonds from palmitoylated proteins, liberating these proteins 
from membranes to facilitate proteolysis. An acyl-biotinyl 
exchange (ABE) assay to measure protein palmitoylation 
demonstrated that accumulation of palmitoylated proteins 
occurred as early as 30 minutes and was sustained after 2 hours 
of treatment with DQ661 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). As proof 
of principle, the palmitoylated form of the prototypically 
palmitoylated protein CD44 accumulated after 30 minutes of 
DQ661 treatment (Fig. 4H). siRNA knockdown of PPT1 phe-
nocopied DQ661 effects, as evidenced by accumulation of lipi-
dated LC3 and p62, the abrogation of S6 phosphorylation, the 
inhibition of cellular proliferation, the cleavage of caspase-7, 
and induction of cancer cell death (Fig. 4I; Supplementary 
Fig. S4C and S4D). The palmitate mimetic hexadecylsulfonyl 
fluoride (HDSF; Supplementary Fig. S4E), a low-potency tool 
compound that serves as an irreversible inhibitor of PPT1 
(26), also concurrently inhibited mTOR and autophagy (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4F). Importantly, cotreatment of melanoma 
cells with DQ661 and the thioesterase mimetic N-(tert-butyl) 
hydroxylamine (NtBuHA) partially rescued mTORC1 signal-
ing and autophagy levels (Fig. 4J). siRNA knockdown of 
 
PPT1 also partially blunted the ability of DQ661 to inhibit 
mTORC1 and autophagy (Supplementary Fig. S4G). These 
results further demonstrate that the biological activity of 
DQ661 is mediated through inhibition of PPT1-dependent 
depalmitoylation of palmitoylated proteins.
DQ661 Ejects mTOR from the Lysosome Membrane, 
Disrupting mTORC1–RHEB Interactions
We hypothesized that PPT1 inhibition by DQ661 could 
lead to mTOR inhibition through an “inside-out” signaling 
pathway connecting vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase 
(v-ATPase) and Ragulator interactions. Recently, the regulation 
of v-ATPase localization by PPT1 was described in neurons 
(27). The AA-dependent physical interaction between v-ATPase 
and the Ragulator complex facilitates the lysosomal recruit-
ment of mTORC1 by RAG GTPases (28). This recruitment to 
the lysosome surface is critical for the mTOR–RHEB interac-
tion, allowing RHEB to phosphorylate and activate mTOR 
(Fig. 5A). Membrane fractionation of cells treated with DQ661 
revealed a significant displacement of multiple components of 
the v-ATPase from the membrane fraction to the cytoplasmic 
fraction (Fig. 5B). The physical interaction between subunit 
V1A (ATP6V1A) and the Ragulator component p18 was also

disrupted by DQ661, as seen by proximity ligation assay (PLA; 
Fig. 5C). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that p18 
colocalization with lysosomes was not affected by DQ661 
 
(Fig. 5D). In contrast, DQ661 treatment significantly displaced 
RAGC (Fig. 5E) and mTORC1 (Fig. 5F) from the lysosomal sur-
face. Immunoblotting of lysosome fractions taken from A375P 
cells treated with vehicle or DQ661 further corroborated the 
DQ661-induced displacement of RAGC and mTOR from the 
lysosome and into the extralysosome fraction (Fig. 5G). In 
addition to displacement, DQ661 also breaks the physical 
interaction between RAG GTPases and mTOR, as seen by PLA 
(Fig. 5H) and immunoprecipitation of RAGB in cells express-
ing FLAG-RAGB, followed by immunoblotting for mTOR (Fig. 
5I). In contrast, neither rapamycin nor torin-1 could displace 
mTOR from the lysosome (Supplementary Fig. S5A). As RHEB 
 
is the master activator of mTORC1, we next interrogated 
whether DQ661, existing lysosome-targeting agents, or exist-
ing mTORC1 inhibitors could affect the physical interaction 
between mTORC1 and RHEB. Neither rapamycin nor torin-1 
was able to disrupt the physical interaction of mTOR and 
RHEB, as seen by PLA (Fig. 5J). Similarly, although neither baf 
nor the LMP inducer siramesine disrupted the mTOR–RHEB 
interaction, which is critical for mTORC1 growth signaling, this 
interaction was completely disrupted by DQ661 (Fig. 5J). The 
unique ability of DQ661 to disrupt the mTOR–RHEB interac-
tion is therefore not shared by allosteric or catalytic inhibitors 
of mTORC1 nor by other prototypical lysosomally directed cat-
ionic amphiphilic drugs (CAD). Next, incubation of cells with 
O-propargyl-puromycin followed by click chemistry–enabled 
attachment of a fluorophore was used to compare the effects of 
mTOR and lysosomal inhibitors on de novo protein translation 
(29). Catalytic inhibition of mTORC1 decreased protein trans-
lation to a significantly greater degree than allosteric inhibition 
of mTORC1. Meanwhile, lysosomal inhibition alone with baf 
had no effect on protein translation. In contrast, concurrent 
inhibition of mTORC1 and lysosomal catabolism with DQ661 
was the only approach that produced near-complete inhibition 
of protein translation (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
We observed striking differences in the antiproliferative 
activity of catalytic/allosteric mTOR inhibitors compared 
with DQ661. Although torin-1 displays significantly greater 
antiproliferative activity relative to rapamycin, the growth 
impairment reaches a plateau at 1 μmol/L whereby a residual 
population of cancer cells persists despite increasing dosages

(Supplementary Fig. S5C). In contrast, DQ661 (≥1 μmol/L) 
treatment completely inhibited viability of cancer cells with a 
variety of genotypes and therapy resistance profiles (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5C). Importantly, HDSF treatment phenocop-
ied DQ661-mediated displacement of V0A1, V1A, and mTOR 
from membranes (Fig. 5K). Further, siPPT1 also displaced 
V0A1, V1A, and mTOR (Fig. 5L), corroborating the necessity 
of PPT1 for the proper lysosomal localization of v-ATPase 
components and mTOR.
In Vivo Lysosomal Inhibition and Antitumor 
Activity of DQ661 in a Melanoma Xenograft Model
To determine whether DQ661 possesses in vivo activity, 
1205Lu (BRAFV600E-mutant, HCQ-resistant; ref. 11) mela-
noma xenografts were established on the flanks of NOD.
Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. After 1 to 2 weeks, 
tumors were palpable and mice were treated intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) with vehicle control (water), QN, DQ660, or DQ661 
 
(8 mg/kg; Fig. 6A). QN had no significant effect on tumor 
growth compared with vehicle control. In contrast, DQ660 
treatment resulted in a modest growth impairment of tumors 
compared with control or QN-treated tumors. DQ661 inhib-
ited tumor growth to a significantly greater extent than 
DQ660, despite differing in structure by only one methyl 
group. Further, DQ661 was the only compound to produce 
a nearly 0% growth rate (Fig. 6B). Immunohistochemistry 
of tumor slides revealed the presence of γH2AX only in the 
DQ660-treated mice (Fig. 6C). Electron microscopy dem-
onstrated DQ661 alone produced visible accumulation of 
AVs in tumor cells (Fig. 6D). At the 8 mg/kg dose, however, 
DQ661 caused weight loss greater than 10%, and by day 
7 all mice were euthanized due to lethargy and bowel dis-
tension (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Histologic analysis of 
the intestines demonstrated Paneth cell dysfunction only in 
DQ661-treated mice, similar to that observed in mice treated 
with the highest doses of Lys05 (ref. 11; Supplementary Fig. 
S6B). Therefore, another 1205Lu xenograft experiment was 
performed in which mice were treated with vehicle control 
(water) or DQ661 4 mg/kg i.p. daily for a period of 14 days. 
Treatment with DQ661 resulted in a significant reduction 
in tumor volume compared with control mice without sig-
nificantly affecting mouse weight (Fig. 6E; Supplementary 
Fig. S6C). Mice treated with 4 mg/kg DQ661 showed sig-
nificantly slower rates of tumor growth (Fig. 6F). Evidence 
of in vivo mTORC1 and autophagy inhibition was observed 
through immunoblotting of lysate from treated tumors (Fig. 
6G). To ensure the effects of DQ661 were not due to a pre-
disposition of 1205Lu cells to mTOR or autophagy inhibi-
tion, genetic knockdown with siRNA against ATG5 or mTOR 
was performed and no significant impact on viability was

of DQ661-induced disruption of the mTOR–RHEB interac-
tion was demonstrated by PLA (Fig. 6H).
DQ661 Improves Survival in a Colon Cancer Model 
and Has Antitumor Activity in an Immunotherapy-
Resistant Pancreatic Syngeneic Model
Autophagy serves a critical role in the survival of colorectal 
cancer cells under hypoxic conditions as well as a resistance 
mechanism to antiangiogenic therapy (30). A recent phase I 
clinical trial of FOLFOX, bevacizumab, and HCQ in colon 
cancer showed significant activity (Dr. Mark O’Hara, personal 
communication), leading to additional clinical trials in colon 
cancer involving lysosomal autophagy inhibition. To determine 
whether DQ661 possessed activity in a colorectal mouse model, 
HT-29 cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of 
NSG mice. DQ661 treatment significantly decreased tumor vol-
umes compared with control (Fig. 7A). Treatment with DQ661 
was well tolerated and significantly increased the survival of 
mice (Supplementary Fig. S7A and Fig. 7B). Tumor growth rate 
was significantly impaired with DQ661 treatment (Fig. 7C).
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) requires high 
levels of autophagy–lysosome function to maintain metabo-
lism and resist therapy (12, 31). The combination of gem-
citabine and HCQ has been shown to be synergistic in an 
orthotopic model of KPC pancreas cancer. Further, clinical 
translation of this finding was performed in a neoadjuvant 
trial of gemcitabine and HCQ in locally advanced pancreas 
cancer with encouraging results (32). We next determined 
whether DQ661 has activity against treatment-naïve, as well 
as immunotherapy/ 
radiation-resistant, pancreas cancer cells. 
Two mouse cancer cell lines were derived from the KPC 
genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM): the PDA.4662 
cell line (parental) and the G43 cell line. The latter was 
generated from a PDA.4662 tumor that grew in the face of 
CTLA4 blockade combined with radiation therapy (25). The 
immunotherapy-resistant G43 cells were found to be resist-
ant to gemcitabine, relative to the parental treatment-naïve 
PDA.4662 cells (Fig. 7D). Gemcitabine was found to concur-
rently increase mTORC1 activity and autophagy as resist-
ance mechanisms (Fig. 7E). To determine whether DQ661 
would potentiate the effects of gemcitabine, G43 cells were 
treated with gemcitabine in the presence or absence of DQ661 
in long-term colony formation assays. DQ661 significantly 
enhanced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine against G43 
cells (Fig. 7F). To determine whether DQ661 would sig-
nificantly enhance the in vivo activity of gemcitabine, G43 
cells were implanted in the flanks of syngeneic mice treated 
with vehicle control or with a single dose of gemcitabine 
(120 mg/kg), combined with repeated doses of either addi-
tional vehicle or DQ661 (4 mg/kg; Fig. 7G). Both gemcit-
abine alone and DQ661 alone significantly impaired tumor 
growth. However, compared with DQ661 alone, or gemcit-
abine alone, the combination of DQ661 and gemcitabine 
produced a significantly lower tumor growth rate and was 
well tolerated (Fig. 7H; Supplementary Fig. S7B). These 
results demonstrate DQ661 has activity in colorectal xeno-
grafts and immunocompetent mouse models of pancreatic 
cancer and has activity in cancers that have developed resist-
ance to immunotherapy/radiation therapy.
DISCUSSION
Here, we perform the first-ever anticancer screen of novel 
dimers of antimalarial compounds. We have discovered an 
unprecedented correlation between chemical structure and sub-
cellular localization. This provides a chemical strategy to more 
specifically target compounds to the lysosome. The potency of 
the optimized compound was leveraged to identify the protein 
target of this compound, PPT1. PPT1 inhibition results not 
only in autophagy inhibition but also in mTOR inhibition, 
through the disruption of mTOR recruitment to the lysosome 
under both nutrient-limiting and nutrient-replete conditions.
DQ661 was developed by systematic modification of linker 
length, aromatic heterocycle, and central nitrogen methylation 
of our previously described compound Lys05. Extending the tri-
amine linker of Lys05 with the spermidine linker led to DC340, 
which demonstrated significantly increased anticancer activity. 
Replacing the CQ rings of DC340 with MQ, PQ, or QN revealed 
that the strategy of dimerization significantly improved the 
anticancer efficacy with all antimalarial heterocycles tested. Our 
results show that the historically oldest antimalarial substance 
(QN) has the greatest anticancer activity on dimerization. The 
effectiveness of these dimeric compounds in cancer models sug-
gests that they should be investigated in other disorders where 
CQ has shown efficacy, including rheumatoid arthritis (33), 
malaria (34), prion disease (35), and viral disorders (36).
Extension of our DQ library using longer linkers established 
an optimal distance between the two QN moieties of 9 to 15 
atoms. Furthermore, linker length correlated directly with the 
ability of DQs to induce apoptosis and modulate autophagy. 
The limited potency of DQ221, which has the same linker 
length as Lys05, could be attributed to the increased steric 
demands of the tricyclic acridine heterocycle in QN compared 
with the bicyclic quinoline moiety of CQ. QN possesses both 
lysosomal and extralysosomal functions in the cell (37). Meth-
ylation of the central nitrogen plays a critical steering role in 
localizing the DQs to the lysosome in a pH-dependent man-
ner, triggering striking levels of LMP. In contrast, DQs lacking 
central nitrogen methylation do not induce LMP and instead 
produce DNA damage. Linker length correlated directly with 
the level of induced DNA damage, as well as with the induc-
tion of autophagic flux among the unmethylated DQs. With 
the methylated DQs, linker length directly correlated with the 
induction of LMP and with autophagy inhibition. The clear 
dependence of biological activity on linker length strongly 
supported a specific interaction of DQ661 with a protein 
target, and not with a general deacidification mechanism, as 
suggested for the monomeric compounds and other previ-
ously described CADs. Furthermore, the remarkable selectivity 
in localization as a function of nitrogen methylation cannot 
be attributed to a simple difference in pKa. The differences 
observed between the unmethylated and methylated amines 
could be attributed to Schiff base formation, which is available 
only to the unmethylated secondary amines.
The DQs are CADs, which have been reported to possess 
anticancer activity, neutralize lysosomal pH, induce lysoso-
mal leakage, inhibit autophagy, and blunt drug resistance 
(38). However, CADs often have multiple effects within the 
cell and can, in some cases, induce or inhibit autophagy. 
CADs such as amiodarone, fluoxetine, imipramine, and

tral nitrogen methylation of a triamine linker) in a dimeric 
compound can enhance lysosomal localization and increase 
the specificity of CADs as antilysosomal agents. Because the 
unmethylated compounds tested (DQ330, DQ440, DQ550, 
and DQ660) are all CADs, this was the most stringent dem-
onstration that not all CADs share these biological proper-
ties, and that lysosomal localization and specificity with 
respect to mechanism of action can be optimized through 
chemical modification.
DQ661 is the first example of a lysosome-targeted agent 
that can mechanistically inhibit mTORC1 in the context of

nutrient-rich conditions via disruption of mTOR. One previous 
study demonstrated that CADs as well as lysosome deacidifying 
agents possess anti-mTORC1 activity specifically due to lyso-
some impairment (43). The compounds interrogated in that 
study included siramesine, concanamycin A, bafilomycin A, and 
ammonium chloride. Siramesine inhibits lysosome function 
by inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; ref. 22). However, 
no connection between mTORC1 signaling and ASM inhibi-
tion was made in this previous report, and our data indicate 
that siramesine in nutrient-replete conditions cannot break the 
mTOR–RHEB interaction in the same manner as DQ661.
Deacidification of the lysosome with concanamycin A, baf, 
and NH4Cl results in robust inhibition of mTORC1 only in the 
context of limited nutrients when cells are heavily reliant on 
lysosomal recycling for survival. Studies from the laboratories 
of Thompson and Sabatini have confirmed that, in the setting 
of AA-replete media, agents that target lysosomal acidification 
and/or the vacuolar ATPase fail to inhibit mTORC1 (24, 28, 
44). DQ661 is the first example of a lysosomally targeted agent 
that can impair mTORC1 signaling in the presence of AAs.
The v-ATPase, known to be responsible for the acidifica-
tion of the lysosomal lumen, also aids in the lysosomal 
recruitment of mTORC1 through AA-dependent physical 
interactions with the Ragulator complex (28). Our mechanis-
tic studies demonstrate that the inhibition of PPT1 initiates 
a cascade, beginning with the lysosomal displacement of 
v-ATPase subunits, which disrupts the function of Ragulator 
and RAG GTPase machinery, impairing lysosomal recruit-
ment of mTORC1 and preventing RHEB-dependent activa-
tion of mTOR. Further study is warranted to determine the 
roles of the mTOR recruitment machinery (regulator–RAG 
complex), the vacuolar ATPase, and the TFE3/TFEB family of 
transcriptional regulators of lysosomal biogenesis in DQ661 
activity and resistance.
Targeting mTORC1, which is constitutively activated in 
>70% of all cancers, with small-molecule inhibitors remains 
a challenge due to limited efficacy and the onset of resist-
ance and toxicity (7, 45). Acquired resistance mechanisms 
to existing mTOR inhibitors include mTOR mutations. A 
third-generation mTOR inhibitor, RapaLink-1, can overcome 
these acquired resistance mechanisms (46). However, lyso-
some-dependent catabolic programs such as autophagy and 
macropinocytosis represent mutation-independent adaptive 
resistance mechanisms to mTOR inhibition (12, 24). By tar-
geting PPT1, DQ661 concurrently inactivates mTORC1 func-
tion and overcomes these adaptive resistance mechanisms.
Finally, this work has identified PPT1 as an important 
new target in cancer. Germline mutations in PPT1 can result 
in infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL or CLN1), 
a fatal disease in which children develop normally in utero, 
but develop neuronal degeneration in early childhood. 
Although lipofuscinosis has many of the hallmarks of defective 
autophagy, to date the characterization of autophagic flux and 
mTOR signaling in INCL cells has not been reported. The fact 
that PPT1 modulates protein palmitoylation, and DQ661 has 
now been shown to impair this enzymatic function, is impor-
tant, because many of the critical regulators of autophagy and 
mTOR signaling are predicted to be palmitoylated proteins 
(47). Studies investigating the link between protein palmitoyla-
tion and lysosomally controlled signaling are ongoing.

Cell Culture and Reagents
Melanoma cell lines A375P, 451Lu 1205Lu, C8161, WM1361A, 
and WM3918 were obtained from Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Insti-
tute) between 2008 and 2015. HT-29 (ATCC HTB-38) was purchased 
from the ATCC in 2015 and authenticated by the ATCC utilizing 
short-tandem repeat profiling. CAPAN1 and PANC-1 were obtained 
from Tetralogics Pharmaceuticals in 2012. These cell lines are bian-
nually tested for Mycoplasma and authenticated using short-tandem 
repeat fingerprinting. The majority of cell lines are maintained in 
RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, 11875) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, F6178) and 25 mmol/L HEPES in the 
presence of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The KRPC, PDA.4662, and G43 pancre-
atic cancer cell lines were established from KPC mice as previously 
described (25). PDA.4662 and G43 cells were cultured in DMEM 
+ GlutaMAX (Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% 
FBS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% gentamycin. Commercially purchased 
compounds included Rapamycin, Torin-1, Spautin-1, SBI-0206965, 
NTBHA, gemcitabine, and Bafilomycin-A1 (Sigma-Aldrich); HDSF 
and LLoMe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); HCQ, CQ, and QN (Spec-
trum Chemicals). Knockdown of RHEB, mTOR, and ATG5 expres-
sion was performed using Cell Signaling Technology SignalSilence 
RHEB siRNA I (#14267) and siRNA II (#14284), mTOR siRNA 
(#6381S), and ATG5 siRNA (#6345), along with control siRNA 
(#6568) per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Macropinocytosis Experiments
KPC pancreatic cancer cells were plated (100,000 cells/well) upon glass 
cover slips and cultured in DMEM media containing 10% dialyzed FBS 
(Gemini Bio-Products), 0.2 mmol/L glutamine (0.2Q), and 2% albumin 
(0.2Q + Alb). To measure macropinocytic uptake and lysosomal catab-
olism of ingested protein, cells were either fed BSA-647 (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific A34785) or DQ-BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific D12051) for 
3 hours. Cells were subsequently washed 4 times with cold PBS, fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde. KRPC cells were cultured for 5 doublings 
in DMEM containing fully 13C-labeled essential histidine, lysine, phe-
nylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, and valine, such that intracellular 
protein and AAs in the resulting cells were mostly labeled. After one 
PBS wash, these cells were switched to AA-free medium supplemented 
with 5% unlabeled BSA. Excretion of unlabeled AAs into the medium 
was monitored after 8 hours. AAs were extracted from the medium and 
subjected to LC/MS analysis as described previously (51).
Fluorimetry
Small-molecule fluorescent properties were observed on a Tecan 
M1000 fluorescent plate reader. UV–Vis spectroscopy was collected in 
triplicate, and 420 nm was found to be the average most redshifted 
absorption across the library of DQs. Emission spectra were col-
lected at 1 μmol/L, which was confirmed to be in the linear range of 
fluorescence. Emission data were processed with a five-point floating 
average to reduce instrument noise. The data were then normalized 
to the fluorescence maximum of the library, DQ661.
Measurement of Drug Concentration in Subcellular Fractions
The fluorescence emission intensity (ex. 424, em. 495) of each 
inhibitor, DQ660 or DQ661, was measured at multiple concentra-
tions in PBS. From these data, a separate linear calibration curve was 
made for each drug. Lysosomal and whole-cell fractions were diluted 
1:100 in PBS, and nuclear and cytosolic fractions were diluted 1:10 in 
PBS. The fluorescence emission intensity (ex. 424, em. 495) of each 
of these diluted samples was measured and converted into a concen-
tration by utilizing each inhibitor’s respective calibration curve and 
corrected for dilution. The resulting drug concentration values of 
each cellular extract were then normalized for protein content and 
compared. Error is reported as the standard deviation of each fluo-
rescence measurement.
Protein Translation
Cells were treated as described, and nascent protein synthesis was 
detected utilizing immunofluorescence microscopy according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Click-iT Plus OPP Protein Synthesis 
Assay Kit C10458).
Membrane Fractionation
Membranes were fractioned out according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit, Thermo, #78840).
Proteomics
DQ661 (DQ) pulldowns from cell lysates were separated for 0.5 cm 
on 10% NuPage gels (Life Technologies, NP0303), stained using col-
loidal Coomassie (Life Technologies, LC6025), and the entire stained 
region was digested with trypsin, prior to LC/MS-MS analysis using 
nanoACQUITY UPLC (Waters) in line with a QExactive Plus mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using conditions similar to 
those previously described (52). Proteins were identified using Max-
Quant version 1.5.2.8 (http://www.maxquant.org; ref. 53) with the Uni-
Prot human sequence database (August 29, 2016; 176,545 sequences; 
61,529,373 residues) and an appended expected contaminants data-
base. Protein and peptide false discovery rates were set at 1%, and other 
critical MaxQuant parameters were as described recently (52). Proteins 
identified by at least two unique peptides were further analyzed using 
label-free quantitation values to determine the ratios of protein inten-
sities in DQ + UV relative to the two  
controls (DQ No UV and DQ 
+ Competitor + UV) for each protein. If DQ + UV protein intensity 
was zero, the ratio was reported as not detected (N.D.), whereas if the 
protein intensity in a control was zero, the ratio was reported as an 
arbitrary value of 1,000 to avoid division by zero. Proteins showing 
a ratio of greater than 10-fold were reported as potential interactors.
Purification of PPT1
Full-length PPT1 plasmid was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid 
#25205). Sf9 cells grown at a density of 3 × 106 cells per milliliter 
of media were infected with 10 mL/L of P2 viral stock. Cell culture 
medium was collected following 96 hours of incubation at 27°C. Final 
cell viability was 48%. The cultured medium was centrifuged at 4,000 
× g for 30 minutes. Secreted PPT1 protein was collected using ammo-
nium sulfate precipitation at 60% saturation. Media were stirred with 
ammonium sulfate for 1 hour at 4°C, and precipitated protein was 
collected by filtration. The precipitate was resuspended in resuspen-
sion buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7, 150 mmol/L NaCl) and puri-
fied on Ni-NTA resin. Following washing (resuspension buffer plus 
20 mmol/L imidazole) and elution (resuspension buffer plus 300 
mmol/L imidazole), the protein was further purified on an s200 gel 
filtration column (20 mmol/L Bis–Tris pH 6, 150 mmol/L NaCl).
DSC
Protein was concentrated to 1 mg/mL (29.4 μmol/L) and dialyzed 
for 18 hours into 20 mmol/L NaOAc pH 5, 50 mmol/L NaCl. DSC 
experiments used a MicroCal VP-Capillary DSC with and without 
the addition of 100 μmol/L DQ661. Scans were run from 10°C to 
90°C using a scan rate of 60°C/hour and a filter period of 10 seconds.
PPT1 and Cathepsin D Enzyme Assays
PPT1 enzymatic activity was measured as previously described (54). 
Cathepsin D enzyme assay was performed according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions (Abcam ab65302).
ABE Assay
The protocol is adapted from ref. 55. Cells were harvested in lysis 
buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L 
NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM), 1 μg/
mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin, 2 μg/mL pepstatin A. Lysates were 
clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 RPM for 10 minutes. The lysate 
was methanol/chloroform (m/c) precipitated, and the dried pellet was 
resuspended in 40 μL 4% SDS buffer + 50 mmol/L NEM and incubated 
at room temperature for 1 hour. The samples were m/c precipitated 
twice and then resuspended in 80 μL 4% SDS buffer. The samples 
were split in half, and 160 μL of hydroxylamine buffer (0.7 mol/L 
hydroxylamine pH 7.4, 50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mol/L EDTA) was added to one half of the sam-
ple, and control 0.2% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 
0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA) was added to 
the remaining sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. 
The samples were m/c precipitated and resuspended in 40 μL 4% SDS 
buffer containing 10 μmol/L Biotin–HPDP. Then, 160 μL of 0.2% Tri-
ton X-100 buffer + 10 μmol/L Biotin–HPDP was added and incubated 
at room temperature for 1 hour. The samples were m/c precipitated 
and resuspended in 20 μL of 4% SDS buffer followed by addition 
of 180 μL of 1% Triton X-100 buffer (20 μL removed for analysis as 
“input”). The sample was further diluted with 600 μL of 1% Triton 
X-100 buffer, and 30 μL of streptavidin agarose beads were added to 
the samples and incubated overnight at 4°C rotating. The samples 
were washed in 1% Triton-X100 buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

In Vivo Mouse Studies
NSG mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used for xenograft stud-
ies. Tumor generation, tumor measurement, and tumor harvesting 
were performed as previously described (48). For the pancreatic 
cancer model, 2 × 106 G43 cells were subcutaneously injected with an 
equal volume of Matrigel (BD) over the right flank of C57BL/6 mice 
(The Jackson Laboratory) and tumors were treated when they became 
palpable. Tumors were measured using electronic calipers, and vol-
ume was calculated as L x W2 × 0.5. Tumor harvesting procedure 
and immunohistochemistry and EM were performed as previously 
described (48). All animal experiments were performed in accordance 
with the protocols approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use 
Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined by using Student unpaired, 
two-tailed t test. For in vivo longitudinal growth data, linear mixed-
effect models were used to test the difference of the tumor growth 
trends among treatment groups. A P value less than 0.05 was consid-
ered as significantly different from the null hypothesis.
