Abstract
Introduction—This study estimated the per-victim U.S. lifetime cost of rape.
Methods—Data from previous studies was combined with current administrative data and 2011 
U.S. National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey data in a mathematical model. Rape 
was defined as any lifetime completed or attempted forced penetration or alcohol- or drug-
facilitated penetration, measured among adults not currently institutionalized. Costs included 
attributable impaired health, lost productivity, and criminal justice costs from the societal 
perspective. Average age at first rape was assumed to be 18 years. Future costs were discounted by 
3%. The main outcome measures were the average per-victim (female and male) and total 
population discounted lifetime cost of rape. Secondary outcome measures were marginal outcome 
probabilities among victims (e.g., suicide attempt) and perpetrators (e.g., incarceration) and 
associated costs. Analysis was conducted in 2016.
Results—The estimated lifetime cost of rape was $122,461 per victim, or a population economic 
burden of nearly $3.1 trillion (2014 U.S. dollars) over victims’ lifetimes, based on data indicating 
>25 million U.S. adults have been raped. This estimate included $1.2 trillion (39% of total) in 
medical costs; $1.6 trillion (52%) in lost work productivity among victims and perpetrators; $234 
billion (8%) in criminal justice activities; and $36 billion (1%) in other costs, including victim 
property loss or damage. Government sources pay an estimated $1 trillion (32%) of the lifetime 
economic burden.
Conclusions—Preventing sexual violence could avoid substantial costs for victims, perpetrators, 
healthcare payers, employers, and government payers. These findings can inform evaluations of 
interventions to reduce sexual violence.

 INTRODUCTION
An estimated 19.3% of U.S. women and 1.7% of men have been raped during their lifetime.1 
Sexual violence victimization is associated with poor short- and long-term physical and 
mental health outcomes.2,3
Few studies have quantified the per-victim lifetime economic cost of sexual violence, which 
at a minimum includes victims’ impaired health, as well as lost productivity and criminal 
justice activities. A per-victim cost here refers to the value of a person entirely avoiding a 
particular exposure. Previous studies have estimated related cost dimensions—such as cost 
per sexual assault incident4–8—but largely have not accounted for victims’ long-term health. 
The aim of this study was to use data from previous studies with current administrative and 
sexual violence surveillance data to estimate the per-victim U.S. lifetime cost and total 
population economic burden of rape among adults not currently institutionalized.
METHODS
Study information reported according to Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards.9 Model inputs included the number of U.S. adult (aged ≥18 years) 
women and men with any lifetime (including childhood) and past 12–month incidence of 
rape; selected attributable—or marginal—health and other outcomes associated with rape 
from administrative data and previous studies (hereafter, reference studies); and the marginal 
cost of those outcomes. Marginal outcome refers to the proportion of victims with an 
outcome beyond the proportion among non-victims, and is used to calculate the attributable 
cost of rape. Medical, lost work productivity, and criminal justice costs were included. The 
main outcome measures were:
1.
lifetime cost of rape per victim; and
2.
lifetime cost of rape in the U.S. population (or economic burden) of currently 
non-institutionalized adults (hereafter, U.S. population), calculated as the 
lifetime cost per victim multiplied by the population number of victims.
This analysis used a lifetime time horizon from the societal perspective. Previous studies of 
lifetime per-person health costs have identified a meaningful age of inception—for example, 
age 6 years for nonfatal child maltreatment10 (estimated cost: $210,012 as 2010 U.S. dollars 
[USD], or $225,408 as 2014 USD11) and age 24 years for smoking12 (estimated cost: 
$220,000 for men and $106,000 for women as 2000 USD, or $292,010 and $139,119 as 
2014 USD11). The authors did not find a robust estimated average age of first rape among 
victims, although it is known that the age of first completed rape was <18 years for 42% of 
female victims (and <25 years for 80% of female victims) and <10 years for 25% of male 
victims.13 The present model assessed lifetime unit costs assuming an average age of first 
rape victimization of 18 years. Costs incurred after the first year were discounted by 3%14 
and presented as 2014 USD, inflated using selected indices.11,15 The analysis was conducted 
in 2016 and used publicly available data.

 Definition and Prevalence of Rape
The economic burden estimate is based on the estimated number of currently non-
institutionalized men and women who reported having been raped at some point during their 
lives in the 2011 U.S. National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS)1 (data 
collection, January–December 2011) where rape was defined as completed or attempted 
penetration of the victim through the use or threats of physical force or when the victim was 
drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent (Table 1).
Outcomes and Unit Costs
Rape outcomes, identified through a targeted literature search, were included based on 
reference studies’ representativeness (Appendix Table 1, available online). National studies 
and meta-analyses addressing both male and female victims were prioritized. Outcomes had 
to be reported in a way that facilitated calculation of victims’ marginal probability of the 
outcome; for example, the outcome prevalence among non-victims and an AOR of the 
relationship between the outcome and respondents’ experience of rape.44 Studies that 
assessed outcomes among adult (i.e., aged ≥18 years) respondents and aligned with the 
NISVS rape definition were prioritized. Unit costs represented the attributable cost of 
analyzed outcomes, based on direct comparison of affected and unaffected individuals 
(Appendix Table 2, available online). Comprehensive lifetime unit costs that included both 
medical care and lost work productivity were prioritized. Where only annual unit costs were 
available, lifetime costs were estimated by multiplying the annual cost over the age range of 
respondents in the cost reference study (Appendix Table 3, available online), bounded by the 
average assumed age at first rape victimization (i.e., 18 years) and current life expectancy 
(i.e., 79 years).45 The cost of prevention efforts was excluded.
Average annual data from the 2010–2014 U.S. National Crime Victimization Survey 
indicated 10.9% (n = 18,012/165,034 survey weighted) of attempted or completed rape 
victimizations (including male and female victims) involved victim property loss or damage, 
valued at an average $219 per affected victim (Table 1) (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau 
of Justice Statistics, personal communication, 2015).
Among attempted or completed rape victimizations (N=216,570 surveyed weighted) from 
annual average 1995–2014 National Crime Victimization Survey data, 5.3% of victims were 
treated for nonfatal injuries in a doctor’s office, 12.1% in an emergency department, and 
1.0% as inpatients (Table 1) (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 
personal communication, 2015). Unit costs were estimated payment for a doctor’s visit16 
and the discounted lifetime medical cost associated with an emergency department visit or 
hospital admission for sexual assault (Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, personal 
communication, 2016) (Table 1). In 2011, there were an estimated 18 murders associated 
with rape crimes (Appendix Table 1, available online).17 Unit costs were based on an 
estimated lifetime cost of medical care and lost productivity due to homicide.18
Data from a national sample of women (N=3,031 respondents) indicated that 4.8% of 
completed penetration rape victims experienced rape-related pregnancy (Table 1).19 Among 
a small sample of rape-related pregnancies (N=34), 11.3% resulted in spontaneous abortion,

 50.0% in medically assisted abortion, 32.3% of women kept the baby, and 5.9% of women 
gave the baby up for adoption.19 Unit costs were estimated payments for medical treatment 
for spontaneous abortion,23 medically assisted abortion,22 pregnancy and delivery,20 and the 
public payer cost of adoption from age 0 to 18 years (i.e., social services)21 applied to the 
estimated proportion of women with rape-related pregnancy by outcome among those with 
lifetime experience of completed penetration rape among all women victims of attempted 
and completed rape in 2011 NISVS (n=13,826,000/23,305,000, or 59%) (Table 1).1
Female victims of intimate partner rape aged ≥18 years (N=322,230 victimizations, survey 
weighted) documented in the National Violence Against Women Survey was calculated as 
an average 3.6 productive days missed per victim (Appendix Table 2 [available online] 
provides calculations).46 This number of days was multiplied by an estimated U.S. 
population (aged ≥15 years) daily production value24 to estimate the value of short-term lost 
productivity due to rape ($516 in 2014 USD) (Table 1).
Funding for victims’ services through the criminal justice system at the federal, state, and 
local levels—including U.S. Department of Justice grants and Violence Against Women Act 
(Title IV, P.L. 103-322)47 funding—are comprehensively included in the criminal justice 
estimates through a top-down accounting approach (Appendix reports calculation details, 
available online). This approach was deemed the best use of available data, but means the 
authors could not identify the cost of individual victim services (e.g., rape kit processing). 
Although previous studies have estimated the cost of annual victim services for two state 
governments,5,8 it was determined infeasible to comprehensively and accurately assess the 
proportion of victims accessing services and the cost of response (as opposed to prevention) 
services per victim using a bottom-up accounting approach.
A meta-analysis of studies published in 1980–2008 indicated significantly higher observed 
prevalence of mental health outcomes—anxiety, depression, eating disorder, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, and suicide attempt—among adolescent and adult respondents with lifetime 
(primarily childhood) experience of sexual abuse (Table 1).2 The proportion of nonfatal 
suicide attempts requiring medical care was estimated using data for men (59.0% of 
attempts) and women (31.1% of attempts) in a separate national sample study of adolescent 
rape victims.29 Unit costs were estimated lost work productivity and medical costs for 
anxiety disorder,25 major depressive disorder,26 eating disorders,27 post-traumatic stress 
disorder,25,28 and medically serious nonfatal suicide attempts18,30 (Table 1).
The 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey indicated significantly higher 
observed prevalence of excess alcohol and tobacco use among adults (aged ≥18 years, 
N=115,030 respondents) with lifetime experience of unwanted attempted or completed sex 
(Table 1).3 Unit costs were attributable estimated lost work productivity and medical costs 
for excess alcohol use31,32 and smoking12 (Table 1). The 1990–1992 National Comorbidity 
Survey documented significantly higher prevalence of drug problems among adults (aged 
≥15 years, N=5,877 respondents) who were raped or molested during childhood or 
adolescence (Table 1),33 supporting other research among a national sample of women.48,49 
Unit costs were estimated lost productivity and medical costs34,35 (Table 1).

 The 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data indicated significantly higher 
observed prevalence of asthma and joint conditions among sexual violence victims (Table 
1).3 Unit costs were estimated lost work productivity and medical payments for asthma36 
and joint pain39 (Table 1). Kentucky Women’s Health Registry data indicated significantly 
higher observed prevalence of cervical cancer among women (aged ≥15 years, N=4,732 
respondents) with lifetime forced sexual experiences (Table 1).37 Unit costs were estimated 
medical payments38 and lost productivity38 attributable to cancer, assigned among the 
estimated number of women with lifetime completed penetration rape in 2011 U.S. NISVS 
(n=13,826,000) (Table 1). A U.S. health plan study indicated a higher observed prevalence 
of sexually transmitted infections among adults (aged ≥19 years, N=9,323 respondents) who 
experienced attempted or completed rape during childhood or adolescence (age ≤ 18 
years)40 (Table 1). Unit cost were estimated medical costs41,42 and lost work productivity43 
(Table 1).
An attribution method was used to estimate the per-victim discounted lifetime average 
criminal justice cost associated with sexual violence among total annual U.S. government 
criminal justice spending (Table 2 and Appendix [available online]).50 Lost productivity due 
to incarceration is the annual production value of the U.S. non-institutional population 
multiplied by the average estimated number of years sexual violence perpetrators are 
incarcerated (Tables 1 and 2, Appendix [available online]).
Analysis
The marginal probability of selected outcomes was multiplied by associated unit costs to 
estimate the per-person lifetime cost of rape, separately for men and women. The sex-
specific, per-person estimated cost of rape was multiplied by the estimated number of men 
and women with lifetime experience of rape to estimate the total U.S. lifetime burden of 
rape. Government costs were assessed as the sum of criminal justice and adoption costs, plus 
the estimated government share of all medical spending (i.e., 59.8%).63
RESULTS
The present-value, per-victim estimated lifetime cost of rape was $122,461, or $3.1 trillion 
for all victims, based given new information about victim outcomes or unit on 23 million 
U.S. women and 2 million men with costs. Barring substantial changes to the per-victim cost 
lifetime experience of rape (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
The per-victim lifetime cost of rape ($122,461) can be interpreted as the cost averted for 
each potential victim who avoids rape. The per-victim estimate could change given new 
information about victim outcomes or unit costs. Barring substantial changes to the per-
victim cost estimate, the lifetime economic burden of rape estimate ($3.1 trillion) will 
remain relatively stable; this estimate reflects the per-victim cost multiplied by the number 
of U.S. adults with lifetime experience of rape, and such a large population experiences 
modest incremental demographic changes. The estimated number of victims with rape 
experience in the past 12 months had a minor impact on the economic burden through the

 criminal justice and fatalities estimates. The economic burden represents costs over victims’ 
lifetimes. Though the authors do not know what proportion of victims in the previous 12 
months (an estimated 1,929,000 women1 and 219,000 men [unpublished data]) were first-
time victimizations, applying this study’s per-victim cost estimate to that annual number of 
victims yields an approximate annual economic burden of $263 billion.
The per-victim estimate is the minimal identifiable cost of rape. This study did not include 
non-monetary elements, sometimes presented as intangible costs—a monetized version of 
victims’ pain and suffering.4,8 Previous studies have estimated the per-offense cost of rape 
and sexual assault to be $87,000 (1993 USD) to $240,776 (2008 USD) (or approximately 
$130,775 to $263,772 as 2014 USD11), of which 80% to 95% were intangible costs.4–6,8 
Recognizing victims’ pain and suffering is unquestionably important, but must be weighed 
against the conceptual and computational challenges of monetizing pain and suffering.64 
Costs to victims’ and perpetrators’ friends and families, and costs of other forms of sexual 
violence (e.g., being made to penetrate or sexual coercion) were not included. NISVS 
estimates do not include the currently institutionalized population, though would capture 
experiences among the previously institutionalized. Health outcomes that could be linked to 
specific attributable costs were included, though activity limitations, gastrointestinal 
symptoms, high cholesterol, HIV risk factors, non-specific pain, overweight, and urinary 
problems have higher prevalence among sexual violence victims.3,65,66 Many lost 
productivity unit estimates included only employed respondents, and valued respondents’ 
productivity using the human capital approach (i.e., lost wages). This approach, though 
commonly used, undervalues lost productivity overall and undervalues female losses, in 
particular, because women are often paid less than men. Many lost productivity estimates 
did not include mortality. Long-term lost productivity among rape victims not diagnosed 
with any of the analyzed outcomes was not included.
Discounting assumed victims’ age at first rape was 18 years, which underestimates/
overestimates costs among victims with first rape at age <18 years/> 18 years. If one instead 
applies the average age of rape victimizations among adolescents and adults—27 years67—
the estimated cost per victim decreases modestly to $119,277, with a population economic 
burden still exceeding $3 trillion. Too few reference study estimates included measures of 
dispersion for a meaningful probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Appendix Tables 1 and 2, 
available online). Based on available data, the authors have not included the medical cost of 
follow-up visits for sexually transmitted infection testing that takes place after an initial 
medical visit for rape treatment. Identifiable double counting of costs includes the following: 
HIV costs appear in both sexually transmitted infection and illicit drug use unit costs, and 
some costs for anxiety and drug and alcohol dependence are included in the depression unit 
cost (Appendix Tables 1 and 2, available online). Substance use constitutes approximately a 
quarter of the per-victim cost; crime costs are a major component of contributing unit costs 
for substance abuse, and a small portion (<1%) of those unit costs included research and 
prevention activities related to alcohol and drugs.12,31,32,34,35 Some reference studies 
focused on outcomes exclusively among adults who experienced childhood rape (Appendix 
Table 1, available online). The cost of some lifetime experiences was inferred from available 
annual cost data (Appendix Table 3, available online), which implicitly assumes an accurate

 distribution of patients at all stages of a particular outcome (i.e., acute, recurring, remission) 
in reference studies’ annual estimates.
Limitations
This study is notably limited by inexact timelines related to rape occurrence during victims’ 
lifetimes, number of rape incidents per victim, number of victims per perpetrator, onset of 
attributable health outcomes, and treatment of those outcomes. This study’s estimates are per 
victim, rather than per victimization, which certainly underestimates consequences among 
some victims and the acute costs associated with victimization.68 Another major limitation 
is that this study assumed that rape is the cause of victims’ higher observed prevalence of 
health-related conditions, although the status of these conditions as risk factors for, 
correlates with, or outcomes of sexual violence is complex.69 Future analysis of longitudinal 
data identifying sexual violence and health outcomes might address these issues, along with 
issues related to timing of rape exposure and the effects of multiple victimizations.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite limitations, this study’s economic burden estimate included more comprehensive 
information on victims’ lifetime mental and physical health than previous estimates. This 
study incorporated new national surveillance data from NISVS indicating rape affects many 
times more individuals than other sources have suggested previously. These findings can 
inform evaluations of interventions to prevent sexual violence, identifying cost-effective 
approaches to eliminate rape and its substantial impact on public health.

Note: Cited references were the basis for marginal probabilities and costs demonstrated in this table. Appendix and Appendix Tables 1–3 (available online) demonstrate how data as reported in reference 
studies were used to calculate data as presented in this table. Costs are 2014 USD.
aCombined marginal outcomes for men and women reflect estimates from studies that controlled for victim sex but did not report final results by sex (Appendix Table 1 has details, available online).
bMarginal costs without references are calculated from other data in the table, for example, category sums.
cPer victim cost is marginal probability multiplied by marginal cost. Population cost by outcome is the number of victims by sex multiplied by the per-victim cost. Total per-victim by sex and total 
population costs are the sum of all per-victim by sex and population costs by outcome.
dDetails of reference studies reported in Appendix Table 1 (outcomes); Appendix Table 2 (costs); Appendix Table 3 (discounted cost calculations) (available online).

hMarginal probability represents the estimated probability of each rape-related pregnancy outcome among all female victims with lifetime experience of attempted and completed rape, calculated using the 
proportion of female attempted and completed rape victims that experienced completed penetration rape from 2011 U.S. NISVS (survey-weighted 13,826,000/23,305,000 female victims, or 59%).1 
Marginal outcome presented in this way for consistency with other measures in this table. Supporting calculations demonstrated in Appendix Table 1 (available online).

aUnit cost refers to per offense or person in the corrections population.
bCalculated from data elsewhere in the table.
cUnpublished NISVS 2010–2012 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
dAnnual cost of corrections spending attributable to sexual violence refers to the lifetime discounted cost of convicted perpetrators that annually enter the corrections system, calculated as the discounted 
lifetime cost of corrections per perpetrator ($78,603) multiplied by the estimated number of sexual violence perpetrators that are convicted (1.4% of 1,929,000 + 219,000).
eTotal corrections population refers to individuals in prison, jail, probation, parole.
fCorrections spending per sexual violence perpetrator calculated as average annual spending per person in the corrections population (i.e., $11,641) multiplied by the total estimated corrections duration per 
sexual violence perpetrator (i.e., 7.4 years), with annual costs after the first year discounted to present value by 3%.
gTotal estimated corrections duration per sexual violence perpetrator calculated as the sum of parole, prison, and probation terms.
hSentence type does not sum to 100% (excludes 3% of convicted perpetrators not sentenced to incarceration or probation; no further disposition data available).
iCombined state and federal prison term served calculated as the average term served in state and federal prison weighted by the number of prisoners at the state and federal level.
jParole defined in source as a period of conditional supervised release in the community following a prison term.
kAssumed.
lProportion of rape perpetrators that are convicted calculated as the estimated proportion of total rape offenses known to law enforcement annually (i.e., 5.4%) multiplied by the number of cleared forcible 
rape offenses annually (i.e., 41%), multiplied by the proportion of forcible rape offenses resulting in a conviction annually (i.e., 68%).
