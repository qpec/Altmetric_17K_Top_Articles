IMPORTANCE The use of evidence-based medication therapy in patients after acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) improves long-term prognosis, yet the current rates of adherence
are poor.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether earlier outpatient follow-up after AMI is associated with
higher rates of medication adherence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis was conducted of 20 976
Medicare patients older than 65 years discharged alive after an AMI between January 2,
2007, and October 1, 2010, from 461 Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes
Network Registry–Get With the Guidelines hospitals in the United States. Patients were
grouped based on the timing of first follow-up clinic visit within 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 6
weeks, or more than 6 weeks after hospital discharge. Data analysis was conducted from
September 26, 2014, to April 22, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Medication adherence was defined as the proportion of
days with more than 80% coverage using Medicare Part D prescription fill records and was
examined at 90 days and 1 year after discharge for β-blockers, platelet P2Y12 receptor
inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers.
RESULTS Among 20 976 Medicare-insured patients discharged alive after acute MI, 10 381
(49.5%) were men; mean (SD) age was 75.8 (7.5) years. The median time to the first
outpatient follow-up visit after hospital discharge was 14 days (interquartile range, 7-28
days). Overall, the first follow-up clinic visit occurred 1 week or less after discharge in 5542
(26.4%) patients, 1 to 2 weeks in 5246 (25.0%), 2 to 6 weeks in 6830 (32.6%), and more than
6 weeks in 3358 (16.0%) individuals. Rates of medication adherence for secondary
prevention therapies ranged from 63.4% to 68.7% at 90 days and 54.4% to 63.5% at 1 year.
Compared with patients with follow-up visits within 1 week, those with follow-up in 1 to 2
weeks and 2 to 6 weeks had no significant difference in medication adherence; however,
patients with follow-up more than 6 weeks after discharge had lower adherence at both 90
days (56.8%-61.3% vs 64.7%-69.3%; P < .001) and 1 year (49.5%-57.7% vs 55.4%-64.1%;
P < .001). Patients with delayed follow-up more than 6 weeks were more likely to reside in
communities with lower household incomes and educational levels (both P < .001); however,
their clinical characteristics were similar to those of patients with earlier follow-up. After
adjusting for these differences, delayed follow-up of more than 6 weeks remained associated
with lower medication adherence at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.70-0.78]) and
1 year (OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.73-0.85]) compared with follow-up of 6 weeks or less.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Delayed outpatient follow-up beyond the first 6 weeks after
AMI is associated with worse short-term and long-term patient medication adherence. These
data support the concept that medication adherence is modifiable via improved care
transitions.

A
pproximately 1 million Americans are hospitalized for
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) annually; of these,
470 000 are expected to have a recurrent major ad-
verse cardiovascular event.1 Current guidelines recommend
secondary prevention with aspirin, β-blockers, statins, plate-
let P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), all of which have demonstrated long-term survival
benefits for post-AMI patients.2 However, nonadherence to
these medications following AMI occurs frequently and is
associated with increased risks of mortality and hospital
readmission.3,4
Readmission risk is a current challenge in health care
among patients after an AMI; approximately 1 in 5 Medicare
beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days after AMI
discharge.5 Hospitals, policymakers, and payers have placed
greater focus on strategies such as early outpatient follow-up
for hospitalized patients to prevent adverse events. Up to 50%
of patients readmitted to the hospital have not had an outpa-
tient physician visit prior to their readmission and patients
without timely follow-up may be up to 10 times more likely
to be rehospitalized.6-8 For these reasons, early follow-up is
now incorporated into provider payment models and na-
tional quality improvement guidelines.9 To our knowledge,
whethertimingofoutpatientfollow-upisassociatedwithmedi-
cation adherence among patients after AMI has not been pre-
viously studied.
Methods
Study Objective and Hypothesis
Using the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Out-
comesNetworkRegistry–GetWiththeGuidelines(ACTIONReg-
istry–GWTG)linkedwithlongitudinalMedicarePartDprescrip-
tion fill data, we sought to examine the association between
timing of the first outpatient follow-up visit after AMI hospi-
talization and downstream medication adherence. We hypoth-
esizedthatearlierfollow-upwithahealthcareprofessionalmay
increase adherence owing to more timely clinical assessment,
medication review, adverse effect monitoring, dose adjust-
ment, patient education, and refilling of prescriptions.
Data Source
ACTION Registry–GWTG is a US quality improvement regis-
try that includes patients at participating hospitals with a pri-
mary diagnosis of either ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI)
or non–ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI).10 Data are ab-
stracted from the medical record and include demographics,
medical history, in-hospital procedures and therapies, clini-
cal events before discharge, and medications prescribed at dis-
charge (https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/action/home
/datacollection). Because information was collected without
unique patient identifiers in ACTION Registry–GWTG, we used
5indirectidentifiersincombination(dateofbirth,sex,hospital
identifier, date of admission, and date of discharge) to link
patients older than 65 years with Medicare claims data
(methodspreviouslydescribed).11TheDukeUniversityMedical
Center institutional review board granted a waiver of informed
consent and authorization for this study.
Study Population
Our study cohort was drawn from all patients in the linked da-
tabase who were discharged between January 2, 2007, and Oc-
tober 1, 2010 (n = 72 587). A previous study12 showed that ap-
proximatelyhalfofMedicare-insuredpatientswhoexperienced
AMIwereenrolledinthePartDprescriptioncoverageplandur-
ing this study period. To examine medication adherence, we
included only patients enrolled in Medicare Part D at least 90
days before discharge (n = 23 475) so that we could accu-
ratelyclassifypatientswhocontinuedtotakemedicationsfilled
prior to the index AMI as adherent. We excluded 16 patients
who died in the hospital or 37 who were transferred to an-
other acute care facility, a skilled nursing facility or hospice,
and 273 patients who were not discharged with a prescrip-
tion for at least 1 evidence-based post-AMI medication includ-
ing a β-blocker, statin, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, or ACEI
or ARB. We also excluded 136 patients whose first follow-up
visit was the same day as discharge, 1283 patients who died
or lost Medicare coverage within 90 days of discharge, and 754
nonindex AMI hospitalizations for patients with multiple AMI
presentations. Our final study population included 20 976 AMI
patients discharged from 461 US hospitals.
Data Definitions
The first outpatient clinic visit was defined as the first appoint-
ment after hospital discharge with either a cardiology, pri-
marycare,internalmedicine,orfamilypracticehealthcarepro-
fessional, including those in advanced practice settings. This
information was determined from Medicare data using car-
rier claim line items. Our primary outcomes of interest were
medication adherence at 90 days and 1 year from discharge.
Using Medicare Part D prescription filling data, which in-
cludes drug name, dosage, date dispensed, and days sup-
plied, we assessed adherence to the following guideline-
recommended secondary prevention medication classes
among those prescribed at index AMI discharge: β-blocker,
statin, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and ACEI or ARB. Ad-
herence to aspirin was not assessed owing to its over-the-
counteravailabilityandlackofthoroughmonitoringwithavail-
ableprescriptiondata.Medicationadherencewasdefinedusing
Key Points
Question Does the time to a follow-up appointment after acute
myocardial infarction affect medication adherence?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 20 976 Medicare
patients older than 65 years with acute myocardial infarction,
patients with follow-up more than 6 weeks after hospital
discharge had significantly lower medication adherence at 90 days
and 1 year compared with patients with follow-up of 6 weeks or
less.
Meaning Delayed outpatient follow-up after acute myocardial
infarction may result in worse short- and long-term medication
adherence.

Part D prescription fill data as the proportion of days covered
of at least 80% for each medication, similar to previous
studies.13,14 Adherence at 1 year was assessed among patients
who were alive and enrolled in Medicare Part D at that time.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were categorized into 1 of 4 prespecified groups based
on timing of the first outpatient clinic visit from discharge: 1
week or less, 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 6 weeks, and more than 6 weeks.
Patient characteristics, including medical history, risk fac-
tors,andin-hospitaltreatment,werecomparedamonggroups.
Categorical variables are presented as frequencies (percent-
ages) and differences between groups were assessed using χ2
rank-based group means score statistics (Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test). Continuous variables are presented as me-
dian values (interquartile range) and were compared using χ2
tests 1-df rank correlation.
We presented the proportion of patients adherent to each
medicationbycategoriesoffirstoutpatientfollow-uptimeover-
all, then stratified by first visit with a cardiologist or a noncar-
diologist. We then compared medication adherence of each
group referenced to the earliest follow-up group (≤1 week). To
assess the adjusted association, we fitted mixed-effects logis-
tic regression models for composite adherence, treating each
medicationasanopportunityforadherence.Thus,eachpatient

ber of medications prescribed at discharge. Clustering owing
to the hospital was accounted for by a hospital random effect,
and correlation between repeated opportunities on the same
patients was modeled by a compound symmetric residual co-
variancestructure.Covariatesforadjustmentincludedage,race,

tion, whether the patient received percutaneous coronary in-
tervention(PCI)withadrug-elutingstent,PCIwithabaremetal
stent, CABG surgery, or medical management was added to the
model covariate list. We repeated these analyses comparing

Prespecified secondary analyses examined medication ad-
herence stratified by the following categories: sex (women vs
men), age (≥75 vs <75 years), revascularization therapy during
theindexhospitalization(CABG,PCI,ormedicalmanagement),
and estimated mortality risk (ACTION Registry–GWTG mortal-
ity risk score tertiles). A test for interaction between timing of

Results
Among 20 976 Medicare-insured patients discharged alive af-
ter AMI, 10 381 (49.5%) were men and the mean (SD) age was
75.8 (7.5) years. The median time to the first outpatient fol-
low-up visit was 14 days (interquartile range, 7-28 days). Over-
all, 5542 (26.4%) patients had their follow-up visit within the
first week after discharge, 5246 (25.0%) had their first fol-
low-up visit between 1 and 2 weeks after discharge, and 6830
(32.6%) had their first follow-up visit between 2 and 6 weeks
after discharge. By 6 weeks after discharge, 3358 (16.0%) of the
patients had not yet had a follow-up visit. Among the 20 332
first follow-up visits, 9693 (47.7%) were with a cardiologist.
A description of patient characteristics stratified by time
to first follow-up visit is reported in Table 1. Patients with lon-
ger times to their first follow-up appointment were more likely
to be men, black, and live in communities with lower median
household income, lower median home value, and lower rates
of high school and college educational levels compared with
patients with earlier follow-up visits. Overall morbidity, as de-
fined by a Charlson Comorbidity Index15 score of 4 or higher,
did not differ significantly between follow-up groups. Pa-
tients with later follow-up times were less likely to have un-
dergone PCI and more likely to have undergone CABG sur-
gery during their index AMI hospitalization. There were no
majordifferencesintheratesofin-hospitalcomplications,such
as cardiogenic shock, heart failure, or major bleeding among
the different follow-up groups. At discharge, we observed high
rates of evidence-based medication prescription among all fol-
low-up groups for aspirin, β-blockers, and statins (Table 2).
As shown in Figure 1, even when the medications were
prescribed at discharge, adherence to each of the evidence-
based medications was low. Adherence rates at 90 days and 1
year after discharge were 68.7% and 61.1%, respectively, for
β-blockers, 63.8% and 54.4% for ACEIs or ARBs, 63.4% and
55.8% for statins, and 64.2% and 63.5% for platelet P2Y12
inhibitors. Table 3 reports medication adherence at 90 days
and 1 year after discharge stratified by timing of the first
follow-up visit. Observed adherence rates were not substan-
tially different between patients with follow-up visits within
1 week, 1 to 2 weeks, and 2 to 6 weeks but were lowest
among those with follow-up times longer than 6 weeks
across all medications. This association persisted among
patients who were directly admitted to the hospital and
those who were transferred from another hospital (eTable 1
in the Supplement).
The proportion of patients with the first follow-up visit
morethan6weeksafterdischargeassociatedwithpatientswho
were adherent compared with those who were not adherent
to each medication at 90 days and 1 year is presented in the
eFigure in the Supplement. Among patients whose first fol-
low-up appointment was more than 6 weeks after discharge,
medication adherence rates were slightly higher for those
whose first visit was with a cardiologist than a noncardiolo-
gist. Among all patients whose first visit was with a cardiolo-
gist, there was no significant difference in medication adher-
ence between follow-up groups (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

After multivariable adjustment, there remained no sig-
nificant differences in medication adherence for patients seen
between 1 to 2 weeks and 2 to 6 weeks after discharge com-
pared with those seen 1 week or less after discharge. How-
ever, patients whose first visit was more than 6 weeks after dis-
charge had significantly lower rates of medication adherence
at both 90 days and 1 year. We repeated this analysis dichoto-
mizing at 6 weeks, and found similarly lower medication ad-
herence in patients with follow-up at more than 6 weeks after
discharge compared with those with follow-up at 6 weeks or
less (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.74 [0.70-0.78] for medication ad-
herence at 90 days and 0.79 [0.73-0.85] at 1 year). Adjusted
odds ratios for adherence to individual medications are re-
ported in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
In prespecified subgroup analyses, we found that fol-
low-up more than 6 weeks after discharge was associated with
lower medication adherence at 90 days and 1 year after strati-
fying by age, sex, in-hospital revascularization therapy, and
predicted mortality risk (Figure 2). The only subgroup that did
not show an association between delayed follow-up and lower
medication adherence was the group of patients who under-
went CABG surgery during their index hospital stay.

between the 1990s and 2003,21 our study suggests that rates of
long-term medication adherence have not improved recently.
Among patients who experienced AMI, medication non-
adherence has been associated3,22-24 with adverse clinical out-
comes and increased health care costs. For these reasons, na-
tional organizations, including the National Committee for
QualityInsuranceandtheCentersforMedicare&MedicaidSer-
vices, are placing greater focus on medication adherence as an
outcome measure.25 Many current quality improvement ini-
tiatives have focused on early follow-up as a means of improv-
ing transition of care. The benefit of early follow-up has been
noted in studies26,27 documenting lower rates of 30-day read-
mission in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic
lung disease; however, this association was not seen among
elderly patients with NSTEMI.28 Extending this concept, we
investigated how timing of postdischarge follow-up is associ-
atedwithmedicationadherenceinpatientswithAMI.Ourdata
indicated that adherence to evidence-based medications for
AMI in patients with follow-up longer than 6 weeks from dis-
charge was significantly lower at 90 days and 1 year com-
paredwithadherenceinpatientswithfollow-upwithin1week.
Nosignificantdifferencesinmedicationadherencewerenoted
between patients with follow-up between 1 and 6 weeks com-
pared with those with follow-up within 1 week.
Lower adherence for patients with follow-up more than 6
weeks after discharge was observed for all medication classes
includedinourstudy.Apriorstudy29showedthatpatientswith
AMIwhosefollow-upvisitswerewithin30daysofhospitaldis-
charge had higher usage rates of β-blockers at 6 months com-
pared with those who did not have a follow-up visit within this
period, but usage rates of statins, aspirin, and ACEIs or ARBs
were similar. In our study, Medicare Part D prescription-
filling data provided a more objective quantification of post-
AMI medication adherence—more than just patient self-
reported use.
Despite robust multivariable analyses, we cannot ex-
clude the possibility of residual confounding. The greatest dif-
ferences between patients with follow-up 6 weeks after hos-
pital discharge and those with earlier follow-up were observed
in measures of socioeconomic status. Compared with pa-
tients whose first discharge visit was earlier, those with fol-
low-up more than 6 weeks after hospital discharge resided in
communitieswithlowerhouseholdincomes,homevalues,and
educational levels. Previous studies30,31 have shown that low-
income patients are at an increased risk of medication nonad-
herence owing to cost, despite having prescription drug cov-
erage, and are more likely to stop taking medications owing
to a lack of perceived benefit than are patients with higher in-
comes. Many patients of lower socioeconomic status are also
likelytohavesignificantbarrierstohealthcare(eg,lackoftrans-
portation, poor medical literacy, and inadequate social sup-
port) that were not fully captured in the socioeconomic vari-
ables we adjusted for, and these barriers likely contribute to
the association between timing of follow-up and medication
adherence. The latest follow-up group also had higher pro-
portions of patients who were black, and race was included in
our list of adjusted covariates. Significantly lower medica-
tion adherence was consistently observed in the later fol-
low-up group, despite stratifying by age, sex, and predicted
mortality risk score.
Patients who had later follow-up times were more likely
tobetransferredfromanotherhospitalthanwerepatientswho
had earlier follow-up times. However, in both directly admit-
ted and transferred patients, we found consistent results be-
tweenthetimingoffollow-upanddownstreammedicationad-
herence. Patients with follow-up more than 6 weeks after
discharge had no significant difference in medication adher-
ence when their first visit was with a cardiologist compared
with those with an earlier follow-up time. Cardiologists may
be more likely to switch medication formulation or dose in

likely to have late follow-up and could be expected to exhibit
behaviors that would result in lower medication adherence.
Administrative data do not capture the rationale for medica-
tion discontinuation; therefore, we cannot distinguish be-
tween appropriate medication discontinuation (eg, acute kid-
neyinjuryinthesettingofACEIorARBuse)andnonadherence.
Finally, our data source measures medication adherence based
on prescriptions filled; it is not possible to determine whether
patients used the medications.
Our study has several implications for the clinical care of
patients with AMI. The data show that adherence to evidence-
basedtherapiesamongpatientsafterAMIremainslowandsug-
gest that greater focus on medication adherence is needed to
improve patient outcomes. Scheduling follow-up within 6
weeksofhospitaldischarge,especiallywithacardiologist,may
also be a strategy to help improve medication adherence. Pa-
tients who do not attend a clinic visit within the first 6 weeks
after discharge may benefit from other interventions de-
signed to enhance medication adherence. Strategies that have
been demonstrated29,32-34 to improve outcomes in patients af-
ter AMI include patient involvement with transitions of care,
discharge contracts, inclusion of inpatient and outpatient care,
and care that involves primary care physicians and cardiolo-
gists. Because patients with lower socioeconomic status seem
to be at higher risk for delayed follow-up and low medication
adherence after an AMI, increased attention should be placed
on this group before and after hospital discharge.
Conclusions
In older patients hospitalized for AMI, our study demon-
strates that long-term adherence to medications indicated for
secondary risk prevention after AMI remains low in all pa-
tient groups despite their established benefit. However, we
found that medication adherence may be modifiable through
improved care transitions following hospital discharge. Spe-
cifically, attending the first follow-up appointment within 6
weeks of discharge was associated with greater 90-day and
1-year medication adherence.
