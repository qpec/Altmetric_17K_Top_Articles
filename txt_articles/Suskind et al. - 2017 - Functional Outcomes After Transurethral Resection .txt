Abstract
Background/Objectives—Bladder outlet obstruction, a common problem in older men, is 
often treated by transurethral resection or laser incision of the prostate (TURP/TULIP). The goal 
of surgery is to improve urination; however, outcomes of surgery in men with high levels of 
functional dependence are poorly understood.
Design—Retrospective cohort study.
Setting—Nursing homes in the United States.
Participants—Two thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine male nursing home residents age 65 
and older who underwent TURP/TULIP in the United States between 2005 and 2008.
Measurements—We examined changes in activities of daily living (ADL), foley status and 
survival up to 12 months after surgery. Multivariate regression was used to determine risk of 
having a foley 1 year after surgery.
Results—Over half (61%) of the cohort had a foley before the procedure. Among men with a 
foley at baseline, 64% had a foley, 4% had no foley, and 32% had died 1-year post procedure. The 
presence of a foley at baseline (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.29-1.50) and poor baseline functional status 
(RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18-1.52 for individuals with the worst quartile of function) were associated 
with increased risk of a foley at 1-year.
Conclusion—Poor baseline functional status and the presence of a foley preoperatively were 
associated with an increased risk of TURP/TULIP failure, as measured by the presence of a foley

Introduction
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) are 
exceedingly common in the older population, affecting up to one-third of men in their 60’s 
and half of men in their 80’s.1 Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and 
transurethral laser incision of the prostate (TULIP) are elective procedures performed on 
such individuals with the intent of improving urination, obviating the need for a foley, and 
functional independence.2
Despite demonstration that TURP/TULIP are safe and effective in healthy older patients,3,4 
outcomes of these procedures among frail older individuals remain unknown. Our previous 
work demonstrated that frail older men undergoing TURP procedures have higher rates of 
complications compared to their non-frail counterparts,5 a finding that is echoed in outcomes 
of frail older patients undergoing other urologic and non-urologic procedures throughout the 
surgical literature.6-10 Furthermore, whether or not the growing number of older patients 
with LUTS and BPH who are functionally dependent, or frail, benefit at all from elective 
TURP/TULIP is poorly understood.
Using data from national Medicare inpatient claims linked to the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 
for Nursing Homes, we examined important outcomes of TURP and TULIP procedures 
among male nursing home residents from 2005 to 2008 in the United States. More 
specifically, we looked at the presence of a foley, functional status and survival up to 1 year 
after surgery. Findings from this study will help elucidate whether or not this elective 
procedure aimed at improving functionality is indeed effective in this growing frail older 
population.
Methods
Patients and Databases
We linked data from the Medicare Inpatient File with the MDS to identify male nursing 
home residents who underwent TURP and TULIP procedures between 2005 and 2008. The 
Medicare Inpatient File contains information for all fee-for-service inpatient hospital 
encounters for Medicare beneficiaries. The MDS is a mandatory assessment of all nursing 
home residents who reside in Medicare and Medicaid programs. These assessments are 
performed at admission, readmission, quarterly and when a resident experiences a change in 
clinical status. This study was approved by the University of California, San Francisco’s 
(UCSF) Human Research Program.
We identified male nursing home residents undergoing the procedures of interest using ICD9 
codes in the Medicare Inpatient File: 60.29 for other transurethral prostatectomy [includes

 excision of median bar by transurethral approach, transurethral electrovaporization of 
prostate (TEVAP), transurethral enucleative procedure, transurethral prostatectomy NOS, 
and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)] and 60.21 for transurethral (ultrasound) 
guided laser induced prostatectomy (TULIP). We classified nursing home residents as long-
term and included them in our study if they completed 2 or more consecutive full or 
quarterly assessments performed over 90 days apart during the 6 months prior to their 
procedure and had a nursing home length of stay of at least 90 days after the procedure.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes of this study were functional status, foley status, and survival and 
each outcome was assessed at baseline (the time of the surgery), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after 
surgery. Death was determined using information from the Medicare Denominator File. 
Foley status was ascertained from the MDS.
Functional status was measured in the MDS by using the MDS Activities of Daily Living 
Score (MDS-ADL score).11 This validated measure of function is calculated by summing 
scores (ranging from independent [0] to total dependence [4]) on 7 items/domains of 
function: dressing, personal hygiene, toilet use, transfer, locomotion, bed mobility, and 
eating. The score can range from 0 to 28, with 0 representing total independence on all 7 
ADLs and 28 representing total dependence on all of the 7 ADLs. Residents were classified 
as having a decline in functional status if they experienced at least a 2 point increase in their 
MDS-ADL score, as previously used in the literature.12,13 Likewise, residents were 
classified as having an improvement in functional status if they experienced at least a 2 point 
decrease in their MDS-ADL score.
Covariates
Demographic data on age, race and information on the number of hospitalizations in the year 
prior to surgery were collected from the Medicare Inpatient Files. Comorbidities were 
obtained from both the Medicare Inpatient File and the MDS and were used to calculate the 
Charlson score.14 Functional decline before surgery was measured by a 2-point or greater 
increase in the MDS-ADL in the 6 months prior to surgery. We used the MDS to calculate 
the MDS Cognitive performance scale score (MDS-CPS) using established methods.15 The 
MDS-CPS is scored from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (severe impairment) on 5 cognition-
focused domains: comatose status, decision-making, short-term memory, making self 
understood, and eating. A CPS score of 3 indicates moderate cognitive impairment and a 
score of greater than or equal to 3 has been used to define dementia in the literature.16 The 
MDS-CPS has been validated and corresponds closely with the Mini-Mental State Exam 
(MMSE).17,18
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive variables were compared using Chi square analysis for dichotomous categorical 
variables and analysis of variance for categorical and continuous variables. Multivariate 
logistic regression models predicting the presence of a foley at 1-year post procedure were 
adjusted for the following variables: presence of a foley at baseline, age, race, decline of 
functional status (MDS-ADL) in the 6 months prior to baseline, baseline MDS-ADL score

 quartile, cognitive status (MDS-CPS score), number of hospitalizations in the year prior to 
surgery, and Charlson score. We then used mixed-effects spline models to incorporate the 
multiple measurements for individual subjects to allow us to assess functional trajectories 
before and after surgery. Specifically, these were restricted cubic spline models with knots at 
each of our time points. Models included fixed and random effects for the coefficients of the 
spline, where each subject’s measurements were scattered around a subject-specific smooth 
curve. Fixed affects included whether or not the patient had a foley, allowing for the 
population trajectory to shift based on the baseline characteristics. For all analyses, P=0.05 
on 2-sided significance test was considered statistically significant.
Results
Between 2005 and 2008, 2,869 long-term male nursing home residents underwent TURP/
TULIP. The average age of these residents was 80.9 years and 80.5% were white (Table 1). 
Mean baseline MDS-ADL score was 13.8 (scale 0 to 28, higher scores represent worse 
functional status) and 28.6% experienced functional decline in the 6 months prior to surgery. 
Almost half, 44.3%, of residents had an MDS-CPS score of >/= 3, classifying them as 
cognitively impaired or having dementia. The average number of hospitalizations in the year 
preceding surgery was 4 and 26.7% had a Charlson score of >/=3. Compared to residents 
without a foley, residents who had a foley preoperatively (41%) were more likely to be white 
(85.5% compared to 77.1%; p<0.0001), have more functional impairment at baseline (MDS-
ADL score 15.8 compared to 12.4; p<0.0001), have functional decline prior to surgery 
(36.7% compared to 23.0%; p<0.0001), have more hospitalizations in the year prior to 
surgery (4.8 compared to 3.4; p<0.0001) and have a higher Charlson score (28.2% compared 
to 25.7% for Charlson score >/=3; p=0.005).
One year after surgery, 32% and 30% of residents who did and did not have a foley at 
baseline, respectively, were dead (Figure 1). Among residents who had a foley at baseline, 
94% of 1-year survivors had a foley at 1 year follow up. Among residents who did not have 
a foley at baseline, 11% of 1-year survivors had a foley at 1-year follow-up.
Significant predictors of having a foley 1 year after surgery among survivors include having 
a foley at baseline (adjusted RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.29-1.50), baseline functional decline as 
measured by the MDS-ADL (adjusted RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19), most impaired quartile 
of MDS-ADL function (adjusted RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18-1.52), and higher number of 
hospitalizations in the year preceding surgery (adjusted RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.07-1.41) (Table 
2). Of note, age, cognitive status, and Charlson score were not associated with having a foley 
at 1 year after surgery. In order to address the competing risk of death as an outcome, we ran 
an additional similar model with a composite outcome of having a foley or dying within 1 
year after surgery. The only differences in this model compared to the original model was 
that there were additional statistically significant associations between ages >/=80 and 
impaired cognition measured as a MDS-CPS score of >/=3 and the presence of a foley or 
death within 1 year after surgery (data not shown).
Functional status, measured by MDS-ADL score at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after TURP/
TULIP is shown in figure 2. Over time, a higher percentage of residents had died, a lower

 percentage of residents maintained their ADL status, while the percentage of residents who 
either improved or declined in their functional status stayed fairly equivalent, compared to 
their baseline function. Figure 3 shows that men with a foley at 1 year after surgery had 
consistently worse functional trajectories compared to men with no foley at 1 year 
(p<0.0001).
Discussion
In our study of 2,869 long-term male nursing home residents undergoing TURP/TULIP 
procedures, we found that the majority of residents gained little, if any, improvement in 
functional status and the overwhelming majority (94%) of patients who had a foley 
preoperatively continued to have a foley 1 year later. Poor baseline functional status, decline 
of function prior to surgery, higher number of hospitalizations in the year prior to surgery 
and the presence of a foley preoperatively were all associated with increased the risk of 
having a foley 1 year after surgery. Age, cognitive status, and comorbidity score were not 
significantly associated with increased risk of this outcome.
In general, surgical outcomes are poor and 12-month mortality is high among nursing home 
residents.12,19-21 This raises important questions as to whether or not functionally impaired 
nursing home residents should undergo surgery, particularly if it is elective and if 
alternatives exist. Our study found that over 30% of individuals died by 12 months after 
surgery, and few, if any had improvement or even maintenance of their ADLs during this 
time period. These findings compare to those in nursing home residents undergoing other 
larger procedures such as lower extremity revascularization procedures (51% mortality and 
32% functional decline at 1-year)19and colon cancer surgery (53% mortality and 24% 
functional decline at 1-year).12
This study demonstrates that poor preoperative functional status, both baseline MDS-ADL 
score and decline of MDS-ADL in the 6 months prior to surgery, are significant predictors of 
treatment failure, as measured by the presence of a foley at 1-year. This finding, while 
intuitive, is important and can be a helpful factor in preoperative counseling and decision-
making among frail patients.
The presence of a foley preoperatively had a profound impact on whether or not patients had 
a foley 1-year postoperatively. Among male residents with a foley at baseline, 94% who 
were alive at 1-year still had a foley. Alternatively, most residents who did not have a foley 
at baseline and survived 1 year after surgery did not have a foley. Presence of a foley at 
baseline was also a significant predictor of having a foley at 1-year in our regression model, 
with an adjusted RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.29-1.50). Patients who had a foley at baseline tended to 
be less healthy than those without a foley at baseline, as they had a higher degree of 
functional dependence at baseline, a higher frequency of functional decline prior to surgery, 
more hospitalizations in the year prior to surgery and had a higher Charlson score at 
baseline. Taken together, these findings suggest that TURP/TULIP procedures among male 
nursing home residents with foley should be performed with low expectations of success or 
perhaps not at all.

 While the reason behind our findings is outside the scope of this study, it is important to 
remember that normal voiding requires both an open bladder outlet (the prostate) and an 
adequate detrusor contraction (the bladder), but that TURP/TULIP procedures only address 
the outlet and not the bladder. Furthermore, patients with impaired bladder contractility who 
undergo TURP/TULIP would have an open bladder outlet but would still be unable to mount 
a detrusor contraction sufficient for voiding. Our study suggests that individuals with 
preoperative functional decline and foley use may represent patients with bladder 
impairment, making them poor candidates for bladder outlet procedures. Bladder function 
testing with urodynamics in such individuals would be helpful to further confirm the 
relationship between functional impairment and the presence of a foley with impaired 
detrusor function versus bladder outlet obstruction, versus a combination of the two.
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to evaluate TURP/TULIP among male nursing 
home residents or among men with functional dependence in the United States. Our findings 
raise important questions about the appropriateness of this procedure among functionally 
dependent populations and raises the broader question about whether relatively minor 
procedures performed to improve quality of life, such as TURP/TULIP, are successful in this 
population.
Our study should be considered with certain limitations in mind. First, we lacked detailed 
information about the residents’ indications for surgery and the bother or severity of their 
condition. We were, however, able to use information on the presence of a foley as a 
measure of urinary status, which gives us a good indication of whether or not an individual 
is able to volitionally void. Second, were unable to identify residents who chose not to have 
surgery for their LUTS/BPH to compare their outcomes to men who underwent these 
procedures. Furthermore, there may be a positive selection bias among individuals who 
chose to have surgery. However, such a bias would only serve to underestimate the negative 
effect of surgery that was demonstrated in this study.
Treatment decisions among nursing home residents are often complex, necessitating 
balancing risk, benefit, and quality and longevity of life. These treatment decisions are even 
more difficult when the procedure under consideration is elective or aimed to improve the 
patient’s quality of life by helping with urination or by improving functional status. Among 
male nursing home residents undergoing TURP/TULIP procedures, we found that functional 
dependence and the presence of a foley at baseline were strong predictors of TURP/TULIP 
failure and we argue that these procedures should not be performed in these subsets of 
nursing home residents. These findings are important to consider when making decisions 
about surgery in this vulnerable and growing population.
