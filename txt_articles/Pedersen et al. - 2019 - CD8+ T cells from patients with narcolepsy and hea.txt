Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1) is a neurological sleep disorder, characterized by the loss of
hypocretin/orexin signaling in the brain. Genetic, epidemiological and experimental data
support the hypothesis that NT1 is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease targeting the
hypocretin producing neurons. While autoreactive CD4+ T cells have been detected in
patients, CD8+ T cells have only been examined to a minor extent. Here we detect CD8+
T cells specific toward narcolepsy-relevant peptides presented primarily by NT1-associated
HLA types in the blood of 20 patients with NT1 as well as in 52 healthy controls,
using peptide-MHC-I multimers labeled with DNA barcodes. In healthy controls carrying
the disease-predisposing HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele, the frequency of autoreactive CD8+ T cells
was lower as compared with both NT1 patients and HLA-DQB1*06:02-negative healthy
individuals. These findings suggest that a certain level of CD8+ T-cell reactivity combined
with HLA-DQB1*06:02 expression is important for NT1 development.

 N
arcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic neurological sleep
disorder characterized by dysregulation of the sleep–wake
cycle, leading to early occurring rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and disrupted night
time sleep. Another characteristic of NT1 is muscle tonus dys-
regulation during wakefulness, resulting in sudden loss of muscle
tone (cataplexy). Furthermore, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hal-
lucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder/REM sleep without
atonia are often seen1–3. NT1 is caused by disrupted signaling of
the sleep-regulating neuropeptide hypocretin in the brain4 and it
has been shown that this is owing to the loss of specific neurons
in the hypothalamus that produce hypocretin5,6.
An autoimmune basis for NT1 has long been suspected based
on a strong association with the common HLA-DQ haplotype,
DQA1*01:02/DQB1*06:02, which encodes the MHC class II
DQ0602 heterodimer7,8. This HLA association is one of the
highest known: up to 98% of NT1 patients with demonstrated
hypocretin deficiency carry DQ0602 versus ~25% of the healthy
population7,9.
Associations between several MHC class I molecules and
narcolepsy have also been suggested by two independent
studies10,11. HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*51:01, and HLA-C*04:01 were
found in both studies, whereas HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*35:03
were found in the study by Tafti et al.10 and Ollila et al.11,
respectively; the discrepancy between the two subtypes is likely
owing to ethnicity differences in the two cohorts. Ollila et al.11
further reported that HLA-B*18:01 is associated with narcolepsy,
whereas HLA-B*07:02 had a weak protective effect.
Following the 2009/2010 H1N1 influenza vaccination cam-
paigns with Pandemrix, as well as after the H1N1 epidemic itself,
narcolepsy incidence dramatically increased in several coun-
tries12–14, further substantiating the role of the immune system in
NT1 disease development.
Remarkably, even after the discovery of hypocretin-producing
neurons as the putative autoimmune target, attempts to demon-
strate narcolepsy-associated autoimmune responses have largely
been unsuccessful (reviewed in ref. 15), until recently where
autoreactive CD4+ T cells targeting hypocretin were detected in
blood samples from narcolepsy patients16 and CD4+ T cells
recognizing hypocretin were demonstrated to cross-react to the
hemagglutinin protein from the 2009/2010 H1N1 influenza A
virus17. As neurons express only MHC class I and not class II
molecules under normal physiological conditions18, cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells are the most likely effector cells in the autoimmune
destruction of hypocretin neurons19. This is supported by the
finding of post mortem hypothalamic CD8+ T-cell infiltration in
a case of NT1 secondary to anti-Ma-associated diencephalitis20.
The CD8+ T-cell infiltration was associated with a complete loss
of hypocretinergic neurons. Importantly, it has also been
demonstrated in a mouse model that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with
reactivity toward hemagglutinin can specifically kill hypocretin
neurons if these transgenically express hemagglutinin. This was
not the case for CD4+ T cells targeting hemagglutinin. Even
though these cells infiltrated the brain and caused local inflam-
mation, this did not lead to loss of hemagglutinin-expressing
hypocretin neurons21. Thus, even though autoreactive CD4+
T cells might initiate the disease process, we hypothesize that the
presence of autoreactive CD8+ T cells could be necessary for the
development of genuine NT1. In the recent study by Latorre
et al.16 describing autoreactive CD4+ T cells, the researchers also
searched for autoreactive CD8+ T cells. This was limited to
reactivity toward hypocretin, and only 10 NT1 patients and 9
healthy controls were tested. Three of these patients, and two
controls harbored CD8+ T cells responsive toward hypocretin
epitopes. Even though hypocretin is the best-known marker of
hypocretin neurons, other proteins specific to these neurons
could also be the target of an autoimmune process. Testing for
CD8+ reactivity toward other targets in NT1 blood samples is
therefore an important next step for understanding NT1
pathogenesis.
We use a recently developed technique for detection of antigen
specific CD8+ T cells that is especially valuable in identifying
CD8+ T-cell populations of low frequency and affinity, as it does
not rely exclusively on fluorescence separation like conventional
tetramer methods22. Instead, it utilizes DNA barcode-labeled
peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes to identify CD8+ T cells
specific for the peptide presented. Using this method, we were
able to screen for CD8+ T-cell recognition of 1183 peptides
expressed in hypocretin neurons and detect such cells in both
NT1 patients and healthy controls. We observe a number of
differences in the CD8+ T-cell recognition profile between NT1
patients and healthy controls expressing HLA-DQB1*06:02 and
hypothesize that the combination of a certain level of CD8+ T-
cell reactivity and HLA-DQB1*06:02 expression is necessary for
NT1 development.
Results
Experimental strategy and peptide selection. To test the
hypothesis that NT1 is mediated by CD8+ T cells, we screened
blood samples from 20 NT1 patients and 52 healthy controls for
the presence of autoreactive CD8+ T cells targeting epitopes
present in hypocretin neurons. NT1 was diagnosed according to
the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Edition 3
(ICSD-3)23. An overview of the experimental strategy is given in
Fig. 1a and the core demographical, clinical, and sleep investi-
gation parameters for the narcolepsy cohort are shown in Table 1.
As nearby neurons in the hypothalamus are not affected in
NT1, the epitopes should derive from proteins unique to
hypocretin neurons, at least locally but preferably globally.
Several studies have aimed to characterize the signature of
hypocretin neurons24–29. By combining data from these studies
and also taking into account the peripheral tissue expression of
each target30, we selected the following seven, potentially NT1-
related proteins for our screening: the precursor protein for the
hypocretin
peptides
(HCRT),
the
hypocretin
receptor
2
(HCRTR2), Lim homeobox 9 (LHX9), prodynorphin (PDYN),
the precursor protein for the pyroglutamylated RFamide peptides
(QRFP), regulatory factor x4 (RFX4), and tribbles homolog 2
(TRIB2) (details listed in Table 2).
Using the NetMHCcons 1.1 in silico prediction algorithm for
peptide-MHC class I binding (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services)31, we
predicted 9- to 11-mer peptides from these seven selected
proteins with the ability to bind to eight different HLA-I
molecules. The HLA-I molecules were chosen based on reported
associations with narcolepsy in two independent studies10,11, i.e.,
HLA-A*11:01,
HLA-B*18:01,
B*35:01,
B*51:01,
and
HLA-
C*04:01.
Furthermore,
HLA-A*02:01,
-A*03:01,
and
HLA-
B*07:02 were also included owing to their high prevalence in
the available samples. Peptides with %Rank scores of two or
below were defined as binders and included in the study, giving a
total of 1183 peptides across the seven different proteins and eight
different HLAs.
The distribution of peptides was not equal between the
different proteins (Fig. 1b). The number of predicted HLA-
binding peptides ranged from 36 in HCRT to 379 in RFX4. This
is mostly an effect of the size differences between the proteins,
ranging from 131 amino acids (aa) to 735 aa (Fig. 1c). Within
each different protein, the number of predicted peptides with
high affinity for each HLA also varied (Fig. 1d). For some
proteins (RFX4, HCRTR2, and TRIB2), the distribution of
peptides was fairly even between the eight different HLA types

 included, whereas for others (LHX9, PDYN, HCRT, and QRFP)
some HLA alleles were over- or underrepresented.
Screening for T-cell recognition of NT1-related peptides. The
1183 predicted HLA-binding peptides were synthesized and used
to generate individual pMHC monomers using UV-mediated
peptide exchange32. We then multimerized the pMHC monomers
onto a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled polysaccharide backbone
coupled to a DNA barcode that was unique to each specific
pMHC (as described in ref. 22). This yielded 1183 different
pMHC multimers that were mixed according to donor HLA type
(Supplementary Table 1) and used to stain the relevant
NT1 samples and healthy controls. CD8+ T cells with the ability
to bind the pMHC multimers were sorted based on a positive PE
signal, the associated DNA barcodes were amplified and the
specificity of the CD8+ T cells could next be revealed by
sequencing of the DNA barcodes. This strategy is depicted in
Fig. 2a along with an example of a sorting plot from a healthy
donor (#138) and the subsequent analysis of the peptide-specific
CD8+ T-cell populations present in this sample. Gating strategy
and control sorting of CD8− T cells with a PE-positive signal is
shown in Supplementary figure 1 and 2, respectively.
The 1183 peptides included in this study are ligands of eight
different HLA molecules. The eight HLA molecules cover the
HLA haplotypes of the donor cohort for at least one and up to
four HLA molecules per donor. All donors were screened only
with the fraction of the library that matched their HLA type. For
each protein and HLA type, Fig. 2b shows whether a given sample
was screened (gray) or not (white) and whether CD8+ T cells
specific toward peptides from the given protein in the given HLA-
I molecule were detected (green/blue color gradient). We
estimated the frequency of all multimer-positive CD8+ T-cell
populations (as previously done in ref. 22) as the fraction of
sequencing reads specific for a given pMHC out of total reads,
multiplied by the percentage of sorted multimer-binding CD8+

 T cells out of total CD8+ T cells. The color gradient in Fig. 2b
indicates the estimated frequency of the given multimer-positive
population, if only one, or the sum of frequencies if more than
one peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell population was detected in a
sample. A full overview of all the multimer-positive populations
found in each sample and the peptide sequences that they each
recognize is given in Supplementary Figure 3. As can be seen
from Fig. 2b, we observed CD8+ T-cell recognition of NT1-
related peptides in both NT1 patients and healthy controls. All
but one patient carried the NT1-associated HLA class II allele
DQB1*06:02, whereas only 23 healthy controls out of 52 carried
this allele. For this reason, the healthy controls were divided into
two groups depending on their expression of this HLA molecule
(Fig. 2b).
Enhanced T-cell recognition in NT1 patients. As some indivi-
duals had several CD8+ T-cell populations that recognized dif-
ferent peptides within the same protein in the context of more
than one HLA type, we summed up the frequencies of all NT1-
related CD8+ T-cell populations per protein in each individual
donor (Fig. 3a, color gradient). As the library size used for T-cell
screening depended on the HLA expression of the donor, we
determined the proportional CD8+ T-cell recognition to correct
for any potential biases based on differences in the pMHC library
size. The proportional CD8+ T-cell recognition was determined
as the fraction of peptides recognized by CD8+ T cells out of the
total number of pMHCs used for screening the individual sam-
ples (Fig. 3a, circle size). In addition to the 1183 peptides
potentially associated with NT1, all the samples were screened
with a panel of known virus epitopes as positive controls. Similar
to the NT1-relevant peptides, these were also selected to match
the donor’s HLA type. For two healthy donors (#109 and #131),
there was no overlap with the viral epitope-HLA complexes
available and the HLA haplotype of the donors, and these
samples were consequently not analyzed for T-cell recognition of
viral antigens. The majority of patients (18/20; 90%) and healthy
controls (42/50; 84%) displayed T-cell recognition of virus-
derived epitopes (Fig. 3a lower panel). Furthermore, these virus-
specific CD8+ T-cell populations were generally more frequent
than those recognizing NT1-related peptides (Supplementary
Figure 4). The virus epitopes were selected from a pool of

virus epitopes served merely as a positive control and to test for
an overall similar immunological recognition capacity between
the different cohorts. Consequently, for these highly selected

higher than seen for the predicted NT1-derived epitopes (Fig. 3a

patient and healthy control PBMC samples. CD8+, multimer-binding T cells are sorted and associated DNA barcodes are amplified, sequenced, and
analyzed. This process is depicted with a sort plot from donor 138 and the CD8+ T-cell recognition detected in the given sample. Recognition is defined
based on the log2fold change of the number of reads compared with triplicate baseline samples with p < 0.001 (egdeR). The axis is transformed to –log10(p)
for visualization. –log10 (0.001) = 3 (dotted line). b Overview of proteins and HLA types included in the screen. Each column represents one donor. Donors
are grouped in three cohorts: NT1 patients and HLA-DQB1:06.02-positive and negative healthy controls. Rows show the seven proteins for each of the
eight different HLA types. Blue–green color grading determines the detection of CD8+ T-cell populations specific for one or more peptides from the protein
in the specific HLA context, at levels according to scale. The estimated frequency represents the sum of frequencies for all NT1-related CD8+ T-cell
populations, in each donor. Gray color coding indicates that the donor carries the given HLA type and was screened for recognition of the given protein in
the specific HLA context, but no recognition was detected. White color coding indicates that the donor does not carry the given HLA type and was
consequently not screened with peptides in that HLA context. Star denotes the one patient that was HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative. NT1-associated,
protective, and neutral HLA types are indicated in red, gray, and black, respectively. pMHC: Peptide-MHC complex. PE: phycoerythrin. BV480: Brilliant

 Although T-cell recognition was observed in all three cohorts
both toward NT-relevant and virus-derived epitopes, comparison
between the three different groups did reveal some interesting
immunological characteristics for the NT1-related CD8+ T-cell
recognition. When counting the number of different peptide-
specific CD8+ T-cell populations found in each donor in the
different
cohorts,
NT1
patients,
HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
controls, and HLA-DQB1*06:02-negative controls, no significant
difference was observed based on the average number of CD8+ T-
cell populations detected (Fig. 3b). However, when evaluating the
estimated frequency for each multimer-positive CD8+ T-cell
population, we observed that the HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
controls had a significantly lower frequency of such T cells
compared with both NT1 patients and DQB1*06:02-negative

 controls. NT1-related CD8+ T-cell populations in the latter two
groups had estimated frequencies of similar levels (Fig. 3c). When
summing-up the frequencies for all different multimer-positive
CD8+ T-cell populations present in a given donor, there was no
difference between the groups (Fig. 3d). We did not observe any
differences in the number of protein targets subjected to CD8 T-
cell recognition in the three different cohorts. There was no
correlation between the duration of disease at the time of T-cell
analyses and the number or frequency of NT1-related CD8+ T-
cell populations detected in the NT1 patients (Supplementary
Figure 5).
We analyzed the number and estimated frequency of the virus-
specific CD8+ T-cell populations to test if the differences
observed between the donor cohorts for NT1-related CD8+ T-
cell recognition also applied to virus-specific CD8+ T-cell
recognition. For the virus-specific CD8+ T-cell populations no
differences were observed, neither in terms of number (Fig. 3e)
nor
estimated
frequencies
(Fig.
3f,
g).
For
the
summed
frequencies, there was a tendency toward a higher frequency of
virus-epitope recognition in the NT1 patient group, but this was
not statistically significant (Fig. 3g).
The observed difference in the estimated frequency of NT1-
related CD8+ T-cell populations between NT1 patients and HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive controls was more pronounced within
certain types of proteins. As is evident from Fig. 3h–j, a
significant difference was detected only for transcription factors
(LHX9 and RFX4), whereas no difference in CD8+ T-cell
recognition frequency was observed for the peptide precursor
proteins (HCRT, PDYN, and QRFP) or the proteins that have
previously been identified as targets for autoreactive antibodies
(HCRTR2 and TRIB2).
T-cell recognition relates to predisposing HLA-I alleles. We
determined the fraction of the individuals in the three different
cohorts carrying CD8+ T cells specific toward a given NT1-
related protein for a given HLA type. Interestingly, the highest
percentages of donors harboring NT1-related CD8+ T-cell
populations were found within the groups of donors expressing
NT1-associated HLA-I molecules (Fig. 4a, NT1-associated HLA-I
molecules are given in red). The same pattern emerged when
counting the number of different CD8+ T-cell populations
recognizing each protein-HLA combination, normalized to the
total number of possible peptide-HLA specific populations. The
total number of possible peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell popula-
tions that could be detected was calculated as the number of
samples with a given HLA type times the number of peptides
from a given protein predicted for this HLA molecule (Supple-
mentary Figure 6). Here again, the highest frequency of recog-
nition was found with the NT1-associated HLA alleles.
Of the 20 patients included in this study, 9 were positive for an
NT1-associated HLA allele and this was the case for 10/23 HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive controls and 15/29 HLA-DQB1*06:02-
negative
controls.
Interestingly,
NT1-related
CD8+
T-cell
recognition was detected in 9/9 NT1 patients carrying an NT1-
associated HLA-I allele, whereas this was only true for 4/11
(36%) of the patients that did not (p = 0.005, fisher exact test).
This was also observed for HLA-DQB1*06:02-negative controls
where recognition was detected in 13/15 (87%) and 3/14 (21%)
donors with and without an NT1-associated HLA-I allele,
respectively
(p = 0.0007,
fisher
exact
test).
No
significant
difference was observed for the HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
controls. It should be noted, however, that donors carrying an
NT1-associated HLA allele generally matched more of the HLA
class I alleles that we included in our study, than donors not
carrying an NT1-associated HLA allele. Consequently, more
peptides were evaluated for T-cell recognition in the individuals
having an NT1-associated HLA-I allele, on average 399 versus
246 peptides. To account for this difference, the number of
peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell populations in each donor was
normalized to the total amount of peptides used to screen a given
donor. The recognition percentage for patients (Fig. 4b) and
HLA-DQB1*06:02-negative controls (Fig. 4d) was significantly
different
when
stratifying
the
donors
according
to
their
expression of NT1-associated HLA class I alleles, whereas this
was
not
the
case
for
HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
controls
(Fig. 4c).
Looking closer at only the CD8+ T-cell recognition of peptides
that were restricted toward an NT1-associated HLA allele, we
observed that the number of detected NT1-related CD8+ T-cell
populations differed between the three different donor groups,
with HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive controls having significantly
fewer of such T-cell populations than NT1 patients and HLA-
DQB1*06:02-negative controls (Fig. 4e). As such, 7/9 NT1
patients with NT1-related CD8+ T-cell recognition, recognized
more than one peptide restricted to an NT1-associated HLA
allele, whereas this was only the case for 1/6 of the HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive healthy controls. Thus, in this control
group 5/6 donors harbored only one NT1-related CD8+ T-cell
population restricted to NT1-associated HLA types.
Ex vivo and in vitro verification of CD8+ T-cell specificity. The
detected CD8+ T-cell populations with specificity toward NT1-
related peptides were, in general, of very low frequency and
therefore challenging to detect using conventional fluorescently-
labeled MHC multimers, in part owing to limited amounts of
sample material. However, an NT1-related CD8+ T-cell popula-
tion recognizing a peptide from LHX9 was detected and con-
firmed with MHC multimer staining (Supplementary Figure 7a).

Discussion
Here we present a comprehensive screening for CD8+ T-cell
recognition of NT1-relevant proteins in peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) from well-characterized hypocretin-defi-
cient NT1 patients and healthy controls.
We used DNA barcode-labeled MHC multimers to screen for
CD8+ T-cell recognition of a large library of 1183 NT1-relevant
peptides. These peptides were restricted to a range of HLA
molecules (HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*18:01, B*35:01, B*51:01, and
HLA-C*04:01) based on their previously described association
with NT1 and three other HLA alleles (HLA-A*02:01, -A*03:01,
and HLA-B*07:02) based on their high prevalence in the available
samples. The samples were divided into three cohorts: NT1
patients (all but one being HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive), HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive healthy controls, and HLA-DQB1*06:02-
negative healthy controls. We observed the expected levels of
CD8+ T-cell recognition of virus-derived epitopes in all three
cohorts; no differences were observed in virus recognition fre-
quency or magnitude. In all three cohorts, recognition of possible
NT1-associated peptide epitopes was observed, although at a
significantly lower level than for virus-derived epitopes. Inter-
estingly, a number of differences in the CD8+ recognition profile
were observed between NT1 patients and the cohort of healthy
controls also expressing HLA-DQB1*06:02. We found the esti-
mated frequency of individual NT1-related CD8+ T-cell popu-
lations to be significantly higher in NT1 patients compared with
HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive healthy controls. Subgrouping the
protein targets revealed that this difference was evident only for
the transcription factors LHX9 and RFX4, indicating that these
may be important targets for disease development. Furthermore,
within the patient cohort, CD8+ T-cell recognition was observed
to a significantly higher fraction of the tested NT1-related pep-
tides (recognition percentage) in the patients carrying NT1-
associated HLA class I alleles (HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*18:01,
B*35:01, B*51:01, and HLA-C*04:01) compared with the patients
that did not. Importantly, such a difference was not observed for
HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive healthy controls. Finally, the NT1
patients carried a higher number of CD8+ T-cell populations
restricted toward NT1-associated HLA types than the HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive controls. This finding supports the role of
such HLA-I restriction in disease development and indicates that
the presence of these risk-associated HLA class I alleles may
enhance the level of CD8+ T-cell recognition of NT1-related
peptides, even affecting those presented by non-risk HLA
molecules.
Strikingly, the enhanced level of T-cell recognition observed in
NT1 patients compared with healthy controls expressing HLA-
DQB1*06:02 was not evident when compared with HLA-
DQB1*06:02-negative healthy controls. In fact, for most of the
analyses, this cohort resembled the patient cohort. This finding
indicates a role for the level of autoreactive CD8+ T cells, both in
terms of the number and estimated frequency of individual
peptide-specific populations, combined with HLA-DQB1*06:02
expression as important parameters for development of NT1. It
could be speculated that the lack of HLA-DQB1*06:02 expression
allows the existence of NT1-associated CD8+ T-cell recognition
without disease development, and that the lower level of CD8+ T-
cell recognition in the presence of HLA-DQB1*06:02 expression
prevents disease development. Thus, the role of HLA-DQB1*06:02
in disease initiation should be further elucidated. It is possible, that
autoreactive CD4+ T cells, which have so far almost exclusively
been detected in NT1 patients and not healthy controls, are
necessary for the function of the autoreactive CD8+ T cells.
In the recent study by Latorre et al.16, detecting NT1-relevant
autoreactive CD4+ T cells, only controls expressing HLA-
DQB1*06:02 were included. Thus, whether the same differences
between HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive and negative controls are
evident for autoreactive CD4+ T cells can only be speculated.
Latorre et al.16 detect very limited CD8+ T-cell reactivity in
both patient and healthy donor cohorts, when screening for T-cell
reactivity toward HCRT. Here, we included a broader spectrum of
seven proteins with preferential expression in hypocretin-
producing neurons. Although we also observe limited CD8+ T-
cell recognition toward HCRT (in one patient and three HLA-
DQB1*06:02-negative controls), the CD8+ T-cell recognition was
substantially larger for the total pool of proteins. The methods
used in the two studies differ with regards to the type of T cells
that can be detected. Whereas Latorre et al.16 detected only
memory T cells with the ability to proliferate in response to
HCRT peptides, we detect all CD8+ T cells with the ability to
recognize and bind to NT1-relevant peptides. We did not include
phenotype markers or functional analyses to our screening and
can therefore not determine whether the autoreactive CD8+
T cells found in patients and healthy controls will differ in terms
of phenotype or functionality.
Another challenge for the present study was the low level of
CD8+ T-cell recognition, which compromised our ability to
further study these autoreactive T cells by tracking and expanding
them, e.g., using fluorescently labeled MHC multimers. Conse-
quently, functional analysis of the autoreactive CD8+ T cells that
we detected was not possible in our study, although it would have
been very interesting to investigate whether any differences
between NT1 patients and healthy controls would have been
detected. Furthermore, autoreactive T cells are likely to have
lower affinity for their target pMHC than virus-specific T cells,
consequently making MHC multimer-based detection difficult.
As mentioned earlier, we have previously demonstrated that the
DNA barcoding-based strategy is especially valuable for detecting
low-affinity T cells22, and hence the preferable choice in this case.
Despite these limitations, in one case we were able to detect NT1-
relevant CD8+ T cells by a direct MHC multimer staining,
demonstrating the presence of such T cells.
A potential limitation in the present study is the fact that
patient samples were collected from 1 to 9 years after disease
onset. It is possible, that the autoimmune response in NT1 is not
strong enough to establish a long-lasting memory response in all
patients. We did not observe a correlation between the time from
NT1 diagnosis and the number or frequency of detected NT1-
related CD8+ T-cell populations, but it is possible that most
CD8+ T-cell recognition toward hypocretin neurons, will fade
over time and be undetectable after 1 year. Hence, screening
samples from patients very close to disease onset would be a very
interesting next step.
In addition to the finding of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in NT1
patients, the present study suggests that low levels of autoreactive
CD8+ T cells of relevance for NT1 can be detected in most
individuals, independent of their disease status and HLA types.
Similar observations have been made in several studies of other
autoimmune diseases. Disease relevant autoreactive CD8+ T cells
are found to be present in both multiple sclerosis (MS) patients
and healthy controls in several studies of MS33,34 and the same is
true for type 1 diabetes35–37. This points to the presence of an
external trigger for the activation of autoreactive CD8+ T cells as
necessary for disease development. In NT1, external triggers, e.g.,
H1N1 infection or vaccination, could be hypothesized to boost
preexisting autoreactive CD8+ T cells.

 In a recent study of autoreactive CD8+ T cells relevant for type
1 diabetes, the frequency and functional capacity of these cells
was found to be equal between diabetes patients and healthy
controls. What did, however, distinguish these two donor cohorts
was the presence of autoreactive CD8+ T cells inside the target
organ, which was found mainly in the diabetes patients36. In the
present study we only investigated the presence of NT1-relevant
autoreactive CD8+ T cells in blood samples from patients and
controls, but this may not reflect the true level and distribution of
CD8+ T-cell recognition relevant for NT1. Detection of such
T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be interesting and
potentially more relevant as a measure of disease-initiating
T cells. In the study by Latorre et al.16, detection of autoreactive
T-cell clones in the CSF was attempted for a few NT1 and NT2
patients, but no such CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell clones were detected
in NT1 patients or controls. Two HCRT reactive CD8+ T-cell
clones were, however, detected in the CSF from an NT2 patient
who was recently diagnosed, again underlining the potential
importance of screening for T-cell recognition closer to disease
onset.
Some HLA class II DQB1 alleles have been suggested to be
protective in NT1. These are 05:01, 06:01, 06:03, and less strong
all DQB1*02 alleles. We speculated whether the presence
of these alleles differed between controls with or without CD8+
T-cell recognition. Only 7 of the 23 HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
controls carried a putatively protective HLA class II type. Three
of these showed multimer-positive CD8+ T cells. Among the
remaining HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive controls that were not
protected by their HLA class II type, nine individuals still had
multimer-positive CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, six of the 20 NT1
patients in this cohort carried a protective HLA class II type,
indicating that the protective effect of these HLA types is most
likely only minor.
In this study, we find that NT1 patients have enhanced CD8+
T-cell recognition of NT1-related proteins compared with HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive healthy controls, both in terms of the
frequency and the breadth of their CD8+ T-cell recognition.
Although the observation of a higher level of autoreactive
CD8+ T cells in patients, compared with HLA-DQB1*06:02-
positive healthy controls, points to some involvement of CD8+
T cells in disease development, the autoimmune nature of
NT1 is still not indisputably proven. CD8+ T cells reside in a
complex interplay between many different cells of the immune
system, and further studies are needed to fully elucidate the
etiology of NT1.
Methods
Patient and healthy control material. Twenty ICSD-323 diagnosed Type 1 nar-
colepsy patients (age range: 7–62 y, mean age: 25.6 y; 9 male) were selected for
blood donation from the known patient cohort at the Danish Centre for Sleep
Medicine. Inclusion criteria were hypocretin deficiency (CSF hcrt-1 < 110 pg ml−1)
and disease duration ≤ 10 years (Table 1). Of this patient cohort, 19/20 were HLA-
DQB1*06:02-positive. Patients were excluded in cases of: secondary narcolepsy;
pregnancy; neurological, or autoimmune co-morbidity (hay fever and asthma were
accepted); severe medical or psychiatric co-morbidity; medical contraindications to
blood donation; treatment with immunosuppressing drugs at any point in the past
3 months (asthma medication was accepted); or signs/history of infection in the
2 weeks prior to the blood donation.
Two patients were drug naive, 18/20 were using stimulants (methylphenidate,
modafinil) and/or anticataplectic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs),
Venlafaxin (SSRI), or Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate)). Three out of 20 patients were
using asthma medication (antihistamines and/or mild inhalator/oral steroids or
Montelukast (leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist)). All patients had normal white
and red blood cell counts.
Fifty-two healthy controls were selected from participants in the Danish Blood
Donor Study based on age and gender; 23 of them were HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive
(age range: 28–60 y, mean age: 42 y; nine male), and 29 of them were HLA-
DQB1*06:02-negative (age range: 19–65 y, mean age: 40 y; 14 male). Inclusion
criteria were age ≥ 18 years and fulfilling the blood bank’s general criteria for
health.
PBMC extraction. To collect PBMCs, a blood donation (450 ml) was obtained via
the blood bank of Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The blood donations from the Danish
blood bank were transported to the laboratory the same day and PBMCs were
fractionated into plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cells. PBMCs from the buffy
coat were next extracted using Ficoll gradient reagent, frozen in 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) in fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and cryopreserved at
−140 °C until use.
Peptide prediction analysis. The online available prediction algorithm
NetMHCcons 1.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCcons/), was used to
predict 9–11-mer MHC class I T-cell epitopes within seven different proteins
associated with hypocretin neurons. Peptides were predicted from the following
proteins: HCRT (O43612–1), TRIB2 (3 variants Q92519–1, F8WA18, B5MCX4),
RFX4 (10 variants Q33E94–1, Q33E94–2, Q33E94–3, Q33E94–4, R4GMS3,
F8VRD4, F8VZC4, B4DZB7, F8W1T9, F8VX50), PDYN (P01213–1), LHX9 (8
variants Q9NQ69–1, Q9NQ69–2, Q9NQ69–3, Q9NQ69–4, H0YL54, H0Y330,
A0A087X083, A0A0C4DGY4), QRFP (P83859–1), and HCRTR2 (O43614–1).
Eight different HLA molecules were included in the analysis: HLA-A*02:01, HLA-
A*03:01, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*18:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01,
and HLA-C*04:01. This yielded a total of 1183 predicted T-cell epitopes spread on
the eight different HLA molecules and seven different proteins. The peptides were
synthesized and purchased from Pepscan (Pepscan Presto, The Netherlands) and
dissolved to 10 mM in DMSO.
HLA analysis across the cohort. All donors included in the study were HLA
typed by next-generation sequencing of the full exome of MHC class I HLA-A, -B,
and -C. The full exome of MHC class II DQA was also sequenced, but only exon 2
and 3 of HLA-DQB1 were sequenced (GenDx, Netherlands). MiSeq from Illumina
was used for all sequence analyses. The full HLA type of each donor is presented in
Supplementary Table 1. The highlighted HLA subtypes are associated with an
increased risk of NT110,11.
Generation of DNA barcodes and dextran conjugation. Oligonucleotides con-
taining distinct 25mer nucleotide sequences (from Xu et al. 200938) were purchased
from LGC Biosearch Technologies (Denmark). All oligos carried a 6-nt unique
molecular identifier39. Oligonucleotides modified with a 5′ biotin tag (oligo A) were
joined to unmodified, partially complementary oligonucleotides (oligo B) to gen-
erate > 1000 unique double-stranded AxBy DNA barcodes. Combinations of A and
B oligos (one of each) were mixed with 5 × Sequenase Reaction Buffer mix (PN
70702, Affymetrix) to final concentrations of 26 μM (Oligo A) and 52 μM (Oligo B),
respectively; heated to 65 °C for 2 min; and allowed to anneal by cooling slowly to
< 35 °C over 15–30 min. The annealed oligo As and Bs were elongated to create
double-stranded AxBy DNA barcodes by adding Sequenase polymerase (70775Y,
Affymetrix), 20 μM DTT and 800 μM or 72 μM dNTPs, followed by incubation for
5–10 min at RT. Elongated AxBy barcodes were diluted in nuclease-free
water + 0.1% Tween to 2.17 μM (with respect to the A oligo) and stored at
−20 °C.
Attachment of 5′ biotinylated AxBy DNA barcodes to PE- and streptavidin-
conjugated dextran (provided by Immudex, Denmark) was performed by mixing
the two components at final concentrations of 14 × 10–8 M dextran backbone and
2.8 × 10−5 M barcode in order to obtain ~ 2 barcodes for each dextran backbone
and subsequent incubation for 30 min at 4 °C22.
Generation of pMHC-I multimers labeled with DNA barcode. A total of 1183
pMHC complexes were generated through UV-mediated conditional ligand
exchange32. In short, MHC monomers carrying UV-sensitive ligands were mixed
with matching peptides at a final concentration of 50 μg ml−1 monomer and
100 mM peptide and exposed to UV light for 60 min. The pMHC complexes were
then coupled to DNA barcode- and PE-labeled dextran backbones to a final
concentration of 35 μg ml−1 monomer and 4.2 × 10−8 M barcode- and PE-labeled
dextran backbone and incubated for 20 min on ice. Finally a 15× freeze buffer was
added to reach phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.5% bovine serum albuin
(BSA) + 100 μg mL−1 herring DNA + 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) + 5% glycerol and 909 nM D-biotin and after 20 min on ice, the pMHC
multimers were stored at −20 °C until use.
T-cell staining with barcode-labeled MHC multimers. Cryopreserved cells were
thawed, washed twice in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) + 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) and then washed in barcode-cytometry buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA +
100 μg mL−1 herring DNA + 2 mM EDTA). On the day of staining, barcode-
labeled MHC multimers were thawed on ice, centrifuged for 5 min at 3300×g, and
1.5 μl (corresponding to 0.043 μg) of each distinct pMHC was carefully taken from
the top of each well, to avoid any potential aggregates, and pooled according to the
HLA type of the donors. The volume of the reagent pool was reduced by ultra-
filtration to obtain a final volume of ~ 80 μL of MHC multimers. Centrifugal
concentrators (Vivaspin 6, 100,000 Dalton, Sartorius) were saturated with BSA
before use. Following ultrafiltration, the pool of multimers was spun at 10,000×g
for 2 min to sediment potential aggregates. An aliquot of ~5 μl of the MHC
multimer reagent pool was stored at −20 °C for baseline analysis. Prior to staining

 with the MHC multimers, 50 nM dasatinib was added to up to 10 × 106 cells. The
MHC multimer pool was then added to the cells and these were incubated for 15
min at 37 °C in a total volume of 80 μl. Following incubation, the cells were stained
with an antibody mix containing CD8-BV480 (BD 566121, clone RPA-T8) (final
dilution 1/50), dump channel antibodies (CD4-FITC (BD 345768) (final dilution
1/80), CD14-FITC (BD 345784) (final dilution 1/32), CD19-FITC (BD 345776)
(final dilution 1/16), CD40-FITC (Serotech MCA1590F) (final dilution 1/40),
and CD16-FITC (BD 335035) (final dilution 1/64)), and a dead cell marker
(LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR; Invitrogen L10119) (final dilution 1/1000) and
incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in barcode-cytometry
buffer and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 0.5–24 h before they were
washed twice and resuspended in barcode-cytometry buffer. Cells were acquired
within a week after multimer staining.
Sorting of MHC multimer-positive T cells. Multimer-binding CD8 T cells were
sorted on a FACSAriaFusion (BD) into BSA saturated tubes containing 100 μl of
barcode-cytometry buffer. Using FACSDiva software, we gated on single, live,
CD8-positive, and dump channel (CD4, 14, 16, 19, and 40)-negative lymphocytes
and sorted all multimer-positive PE cells within this population. The gating
strategy is exemplified in Supplementary Figure 1. As tested and described in
Bentzen et al.22, inclusion of CD8-positive, multimer negative cells in the sorting
gate does not have an impact on the final results because the fluorescence signal is
used only for sorting out the relevant cells. Determination of antigen specificity is
done solely based on the DNA barcode. The sorted cells were centrifuged for
10 min at 5000×g and the buffer was removed. The cell pellet was stored at −80 °C
in a minimal amount of residual buffer (< 20 μL).
DNA barcode amplification. DNA barcode amplification was performed using
Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, 201443) and 3 μM of forward and reverse
primers (LGC Biosearch Technologies)22. PCR amplification was conducted on
sorted multimer-binding T cells (in < 20 μL of buffer) and on the stored aliquot
of the MHC multimer reagent pool (diluted 50,000 × in the final PCR) under the
following conditions: 95 °C 10 min; 36 cycles: 95 °C 30 s, 60 °C 45 s, 72 °C 30 s, and
72 °C 4 min. The multimer reagent pool was used as the baseline to determine the
number of DNA barcode reads within a non-processed MHC multimer reagent
library. PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen,
28104) and the amplified DNA barcodes were sequenced at Sequetech (USA) using
an Ion Torrent PGM 316 or 318 chip (Life Technologies).
Processing of sequencing data from DNA barcodes. Sequencing data were
processed by the software package “Barracoda”, available online at (http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/barracoda)22. This tool identifies the barcodes used in a given
experiment, assigns sampleID and pMHC specificity to each barcode, and counts
the total number of reads and clonally reduced reads for each pMHC-associated
DNA barcode. Furthermore, it accounts for barcode enrichment based on methods
designed for the analysis of RNA-seq data, implemented in the R package edgeR:
specifically, log2 fold changes in read counts mapped to a given sample relative to
the mean read counts mapped to triplicate baseline samples are estimated using
normalization factors determined by the trimmed mean of M-values method22,40.
Barcodes with a log2 fold change with a p < 0.001, which equals a false discovery
rate < 0.1 (estimated using the Benjamini–Hechberg method), and with clonal read
counts above 100 were considered to represent true CD8+ T-cell recognition. The
cutoff of 100 reads was chosen based on evaluation of this particular data set, in
order to ensure that background events were not included in the analysis. We have
previously tested sorting and sequencing of the CD8 negative, dump channel
positive cells and did not detect any CD8+ T-cell recognition in this population
(Supplementary Figure 2a). Also, the inclusion of high-levels of MHC complexes
that were generated with non-matching peptides under UV-induced peptide
exchange, hence producing unstable, partly defolded complexes, did not sub-
stantially impact the background of the MHC multimer staining (Supplementary
Figure 2b)
Verification of specificity with flow cytometry. A small cohort of 40 selected
peptides, to which specific T cells had been detected either in several donors or with
a high number of reads in single donors, were used to generate fluorescently-labeled
MHC multimers. Again, UV-mediated peptide exchange was used and pMHC
complexes were multimerized using streptavidin-conjugated PE (405204, BioLe-
gend), APC (405207, BioLegend), PE-Cy7 (405206, BioLegend), PECF594 (562284,
BD), BV421 (563259, BD), BV605 (563260, BD), BV650 (563855, BD), BUV395
(564176, BD), and BUV737 (564293, BD). The final concentrations of monomer
and peptide were 100 μg ml−1 and 200 nM, respectively. Each pMHC was made in
two different colors and mixed before the MHC multimers were stored at −20 °C
with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) and 5% glycerol (Fluka). For
ex vivo T-cell staining, samples from cells were thawed as described above and 2 ×
106 cells were stained with 1 μl of each pMHC, according to HLA type, for 15 min at
37 °C. Cells were then stained with a 5× antibody mix as described for staining with
DNA barcode-labeled MHC multimers. Following two washing steps and fixation in
PFA, cells were acquired on an LSR Fortessa (BD). The gating strategy is identical to
the one described above and presented in Supplementary Figure 1.
Enrichment of specific T cells. Six donors (three patients and three healthy
controls) with detected NT1-relevant CD8+ T-cell recognition were selected for
enrichment of specific T cells. PE-labeled MHC multimers were generated in the
same fashion as described for the verification. Cells were thawed and washed twice
in RPMI + 10% FCS and 1 × 106 cells were taken to a new tube and irradiated at ~
20 Gy for 6 min and 15 sec. These cells were washed twice and kept for later use as
feeder cells. From the remaining cells, 20 × 106 cells were stained with 1 μl per
pMHC of the PE-labeled MHC multimers for 60 min at 4 °C. Following staining,
the cells were washed twice and stained with α-PE beads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15
min at 4 °C. The cells where then washed twice again and loaded onto a magnetic
column placed in the magnetic field of a MACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec), which
captured the cells with a PE label through the α-PE beads. After washing the
column twice, the column was removed from the separator and the specific cells
were washed into a new tube containing X-vivo media (Lonza) + 5% human serum
(HS; Sigma Aldrich). The specific cells were counted, washed, and cultured in X-
vivo + 5% HS supplemented with 23.8 U mL−1 IL-15 (PeproTech, #200–15–10UG)
and 100 U mL−1 IL-2 (PeproTech, #200–02–50UG). Approximately 5000 specific
cells were cultured with 50,000 feeder cells/well as well as 11,000 CD3/CD28
Dynabeads (Gibco). After 1.5 weeks of culturing, 2 × 106 cells were stained with the
above-described fluorescently labeled MHC multimers and acquired on an LSR
Fortessa (BD).
Graph generation and statistical data analysis. Graphs were generated using
either GraphPad Prism 7.0d for mac or ggplot2 in R and edited using OmniGraffle
version 7.8.1. Statistical analysis of DNA barcoding data was performed using the
software package “Barracoda” as described above. Significant differences between
the number and frequency of detected NT1-related CD8+ T-cell populations in
Figs. 3, 4, and Supplementary Figure 4 were calculated in GraphPad Prism 7.0b.
For Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure 4, log transformation of data was performed,
and parametric tests used to determine significant differences, whereas for Fig. 4
non-parametric tests were used. Normal distribution was tested with D’Agostino
normality test. Fisher exact tests were used for contingency analysis of over- or
underrepresentation of detected recognition within the subgroups of donors. The
single patient (14) which is HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative is removed from com-
parisons between patients and HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive controls. For all figures,
*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001.
Ethical approval. All donor material was collected with the approval of the
Scientific Ethics Committee of the Capital Region, Denmark (Protocol
H-3–2013–054) and written informed consent was obtained according to the
Declaration of Helsinki.
