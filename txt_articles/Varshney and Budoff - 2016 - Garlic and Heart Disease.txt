Abstract
Background: Thousands of studies have been published based on animal and human studies evaluating garlic’s effects
and safety.
Objective: We reviewed the available literature investigating the effects of garlic supplements on hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, C-reactive protein (CRP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and coronary artery calcium (CAC), as
well as available data on side effects.
Methods: We searched PubMed for all human studies using medical subject heading words through 30 May 2013 and
assessed relevant review articles and original studies. Only double-blind, randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses
of double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were included. The review of articles and data extraction were performed by
2 independent authors, with any disagreements resolved by consensus.
Results: Garlic supplementation reduced blood pressure by 7–16 mm Hg (systolic) and 5–9 mm Hg (diastolic) (4 meta-
analyses and 2 original studies). It reduced total cholesterol by 7.4–29.8 mg/dL (8 meta-analyses). The most consistent
benefits were shown in studies that used aged garlic extract (AGE). A few small studies that used AGE also showed
favorable effects on CAC, CRP, and PWV. Although garlic is generally safe, rare adverse reactions have been documented
with limited causality established.
Conclusion: We conclude that garlic supplementation has the potential for cardiovascular protection based on risk factor
reduction (hypertension and total cholesterol) and surrogate markers (CRP, PWV, and CAC) of atherosclerosis. Larger
studies are warranted to evaluate these effects further.

Introduction
Despite significant improvements over the last several decades in
lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic management of well-
established risk factors, atherosclerosis-related diseases (ARDs)6
such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and peripheral
vascular disease remain the leading cause of mortality in developed
nations (1). Thus, ongoing preventative strategies, especially for
primary prevention, are an area of utmost importance (2).
Although garlic (Allium sativum L.) has been used for medicinal
purposes for thousands of years (3) across the globe for various
indications (4), speculation about the cardio-protective effects
appears in ancient Indian texts (5). The earliest scientific studies
exploring this possibility, to our knowledge, began in the 1950s
(6). Since then, thousands of studies have been published based on
animal and human studies in vitro and in vivo to isolate the active
ingredients and to evaluate garlic�s effects and safety. In fact, garlic
is one of the most heavily researched present day herbal medicines
(4) and the second most used complementary therapy (7).
There have been concerns and criticism about the use of
garlic. It has been shown that the variability and the non-
standardization of preparations can make comparing studies
very difficult and results sometimes uninterpretable (8, 9). Even
studies that have used the same preparation sometimes report
different outcomes. There have also been concerns about the size
and duration of many of the trials (10, 11). Lastly, many of the
studies that have shown favorable effects are in vitro or animal
studies, which may not translate to human benefit.
Nonetheless, as a society, we must focus on developing safe,
affordable, and accessible strategies for preventing ARDs. Thus,
if supported by thousands of years of clinical use and multiple
small-scale studies showing favorable effects, without significant
side effects or cost, it is worthwhile to pursue this therapy further.
This literature review is an effort to consolidate current
knowledge in this area to better understand the effect of garlic
on ARDs from a clinician�s point of view. To our knowledge,
there is no study investigating the effect of garlic on endpoints
such as infarction, stroke, percutaneous interventions, or death
(7). Thus, we summarize the evidence for the use of garlic in
treating traditional clinical risk factors based on the Framing-
ham risk score, namely, hypertension and total cholesterol (TC).
We also summarize current knowledge of the effect of
garlic on emerging tools currently mentioned in guidelines for
a clinician in predicting ARDs in addition to the traditional
risk factors correlated to IHD, namely, coronary artery
calcium (CAC), inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein

The safety profile will also be discussed.
Methods
Human review articles in PubMed were searched up until 31 March
2013 by using the medical subject heading word ‘‘garlic,’’ along with
one or more of the terms ‘‘hypertension,’’ ‘‘hypercholesterolemia,’’
‘‘C-reactive protein,’’ and ‘‘arterial occlusive diseases.’’ Only double-
blind, randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of double-
blind, randomized, controlled trials were included. The review of
articles and data extraction was performed by 2 independent authors,
with any disagreements resolved by consensus. We prespecified the
following inclusion criteria: 1) the study had to be a cohort or double-
blind design; 2) the garlic dose had to be specified; and 3) the study
had to provide relevant data, including blood pressure, blood
cholesterol, aortic stiffness, or atherosclerosis measures. The quality
of the trial was analyzed by each author independently and only trials
that were assessed to be appropriate by both authors were included.
Results
Hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy has been associated
with a 20–25% relative risk reduction in the incidence of IHD,
and a 30–40% reduction in stroke (12). It is thought that up to
50% of hypertensive patients may be using garlic as an adjunct
or solely for treatment (7). Furthermore, in developing nations
such as Nigeria, where complementary therapies are more
affordable and accessible, garlic is heavily used for hypertension
(13). The first meta-analysis of the antihypertensive effects of
garlic, to our knowledge, was published in 1994 and showed
favorable effects (14). However, we will focus on 4 meta-
analyses and 2 original studies published since then.
Two of the 4 meta-analyses were published in 2008. In the
first study, Reinhart et al. (15) found 26 randomized, controlled
studies reporting blood pressure endpoints. Sixteen of these
studies were excluded for poor quality (e.g., 5 were not placebo
controlled, 2 were not double-blinded, and 1 had no baseline
blood pressures). Of the remaining 10 studies, only 3 enrolled hy-
pertensive patients (n = 132) at baseline, whereas the other
7 enrolled normotensive patients (n = 262). All 3 studies enrolling
hypertensive patients were treated with Kwai brand garlic
powder (KB GP). These patients were found to have a significant
decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 16.3 mm Hg (95%
CI: 6.2, 26.5) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 9.3 mm Hg
(95% CI: 5.3, 13.3) compared with placebo. In the remaining 7
trials enrolling normotensive patients, treatment with KB GP,
Kyolic brand aged garlic extract (KB AGE), and Cardiomax
brand garlic oil did not significantly lower blood pressure.
Reinhart et al. concluded that garlic lowers SBP and DBP in
hypertensive patients, but not in normotensive patients.
In the second study, Ried et al. (16) found 25 relevant studies
and included 11 in their meta-analysis with 503 patients in an
SBP arm and 565 in an DBP arm. This included 6 of the 10
studies from the meta-analysis by Reinhart et al. (15) mentioned
above and only 2 of 3 studies that had hypertensive patients at
baseline. In this meta-analysis, 9 studies used KB GP, 1 used KB
AGE, and 1 used distilled garlic oil. Ried et al. concluded that
SBP decreased by 4.6 6 2.8 mm Hg overall. Furthermore, in
patients who were hypertensive at baseline, SBP decreased by
8.4 6 2.8 mm Hg and DBP by 7.3 6 1.5 mm Hg. The regression
analysis done by Ried et al. showed a significant association
between blood pressure at the start of the intervention and the
amount of blood pressure reduction as well.
In the third study, Simons et al. (11) performed a review of trials
related to the effects of garlic on hypertension. They analyzed
32 trials and evaluated the quality, finding that most were of
borderline quality. They scored each trial on a 9-point quality
scale and awarded only 4–6 points for most individual studies.
Simons et al. concluded that garlic could not be recommended
for hypertension given the ‘‘low methodological quality.’’
Regardless, in a Cochrane Review, Stabler et al. (7) screened
72 publications and included only 2 trials in their study. They
concluded that treatment with garlic decreases SBP by 10–12 mm Hg
and DBP by 6–9 mm Hg.
Since the publication of the Cochrane Review by Stabler et al.
(7), we identified 2 more randomized, controlled trials. First,
Ried et al. (17) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial meeting all quality criteria. They enrolled
84 hypertensive patients taking conventional antihypertensive
medications. With the use of KB AGE at 3 different doses
compared with placebo, they found a reduction in SBP of 11.8 6
5.4 mm Hg at a dose of 2 capsules. This dose was ‘‘well tolerated
and highly acceptable.’’ Tolerability, compliance and acceptabil-
ity were high (93%) in all garlic groups and highest in the
groups taking 1 or 2 capsules daily.
Second, Nakasone et al. (18) evaluated prehypertensive
patients (SBP: 130–139 mm Hg) to mildly hypertensive patients
(SBP: 140–159 mm Hg) taking no medications and administered
Dentou-ninniku-ranwo brand Japanese garlic preparation in
a 12 wk randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
meeting most of the quality criteria. Nakasone et al. showed a

 reduction in SBP of 6.6–7.5 mm Hg and DBP of 4.6–5.2 mm Hg
with no reported side effects.
Based on our literature review, we identified a few small
studies having rigorous methodologic quality according to
several authors that showed a favorable effect on blood pressure
from the use of garlic preparations in the range of 7–16 mm Hg
for SBP and 5–9 mm Hg for DBP compared with placebo. This
effect was seen only in patients with hypertension at baseline.
This effect may be in addition to other antihypertensive
therapies (18), and it has been demonstrated with the use
of KB GP, KB AGE, and Dentou-ninniku-ranwo preparations.
Most studies have been performed with KB AGE. No studies
have shown effects on endpoints such as mortality or myocardial
infarction or stroke, but, of note, an amount of blood pressure
reduction with other interventions has been shown to reduce
IHD events by up to 40% (12).
Hypercholesterolemia. Many large-scale randomized trials
have demonstrated a graded effect between degree of hypercho-
lesterolemia and IHD (19, 20). In a meta-analysis of 61 trials
with over 900,000 asymptomatic patients over 12 million patient-
years and 55,000 vascular deaths, it was shown that lowering
TC by 38.7 mg/dL was associated with approximately 56% [HR
0.44 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.48)], 34% [0.66 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.68)],
and 17% [0.83 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.85)] lower IHD mortality in
both sexes at ages 40–49, 50–69, and 70–89 y, respectively,
throughout the main range of cholesterol in most developed
countries, with no apparent threshold (21).
Although in vitro and animal studies have repeatedly and
almost unanimously shown favorable effects from garlic
consumption on hypercholesterolemia and its consequences,
clinical trials have had conflicting results (3). In total, we
identified 8 meta-analyses between 1993 and 2011 analyzing
the effect of garlic consumption on TC. Each had different
inclusion and exclusion criteria and have thus produced
variable results.
The most recent meta-analysis published (22) evaluated 26
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1295
subjects. It excluded 9 additional studies that met inclusion
criteria but had data not amenable to pooling. In addition, 6
trials were excluded because of the inclusion of diabetic patients,
2 because they concurrently used lipid-lowering agents, 2
because they coadministered garlic with other interventions,
and 1 because of a significant gender difference between the
garlic and placebo groups. Only 4 of the 26 analyzed studies
included normo-lipidemic patients. Garlic powder was the
most used product, as were KB AGE and garlic oil. Overall,
this meta-analysis concluded that garlic was superior to
placebo in reducing serum TC by 10.8 mg/dL (95% CI:
17.4, 4.3, P = 0.001). KB AGE and KB GP were more effective
in lowering TC concentrations. The authors concluded that
the reduction, although significant, was unimpressive com-
pared with reductions from the use of prescription drugs such
as statins, but that it was comparable to diet modification
alone.
Of the other 7 meta-analyses identified, 2 were published in
2009 and had conflicting results. Reinhart et al. (23) screened
2958 publications—until November 2007—and analyzed 29
trials. They found a similar reduction in TC of 7.35 mg/dL
(95% CI: 12.8, 2.3). In contrast, in the same year, Khoo and
Aziz (24) screened only 1230 studies published until March 2008,
included 12 trials until March 2008 with 1056 subjects, and
found no difference in TC with garlic consumption compared
with placebo.
All 5 older meta-analyses published before 2008, by Alder
et al. (10), Ackerman et al. (25), Stevinson et al. (26), Silagy
and Neil (27), and Warshafsky et al. (28), showed favorable
effects from garlic on TC of 24.7, 17.0, 15.9, 29.8, and
22.8 mg/dL, respectively. Since the publication of the most recent
meta-analysis, we identified 3 randomized, controlled trials
which are not applicable because they involved the coadmin-
istration of interventions besides garlic (29, 30) and open
labeling (31).
Overall, various garlic preparations have shown a reduction
in TC of 7.4–29.8 mg/dL. The trial showing no effect (24) was
published at the same time as that by Reinhart et al. (23), but it
screened and included only half as many publications. This may
perhaps indicate a bias. This mild to moderate reduction in TC
should be beneficial to lower cholesterol concentrations when
added to statins or for patients who cannot tolerate statins.
CAC and epicardial adipose tissue. CAC is an adjusted score
that is based on the amount of calcification discovered in
coronary vessels by a noncontrast computed tomography (CT)
scan. According to the 2010 American College of Cardiology
Foundation/AHA guideline for assessment of cardiovascular
disease risk in asymptomatic adults (32), not only is CAC a well-
validated prognostic marker of IHD, but also, in patients who
are at intermediate risk based on the Framingham risk factors
(10–20% 10 y risk), CAC can additively help risk-stratify
patients into low or high risk, thus influencing treatment
decisions. Furthermore, serial measurements of CAC can help
prognosticate patients further, and it is becoming an acceptable
surrogate endpoint instead of myocardial infarction or cardiac
disease mortality in studies assessing the effectiveness of inter-
ventions (33). Moreover, treatment with statins has been
shown to reduce the rate of CAC progression (34, 35). It has
been shown that a CAC score progression of >15% per year
significantly increases mortality (36, 37).
There are 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
small studies demonstrating the favorable effects of garlic
on CAC progression (38, 39, 40) as a surrogate marker for
clinical endpoints. All 3 studies used the standardized KB
AGE formulation at standard doses.
Budoff et al. (38) showed that in 23 patients with known
coronary artery disease (CAD) or high risk patients (Framing-
ham risk >20% over 10 y), over 1 y, KB AGE reduced the
progression of CAC compared with placebo (7.5 6 9.4%
compared with 22.2 6 18.5%, respectively). Similarly, Budoff
et al. (39) showed significant results in 65 intermediate risk
patients (age 60 6 9 y) with a Framingham risk of 10–20% and
baseline CAC >30. In that study, KB AGE was administered with
vitamin B-12, folic acid, vitamin B-6, and L-arginine. In a 1 y
follow-up, the CAC progression was significantly lower in the
treatment group than in the placebo group (6.8% compared
with 26.5%, P = 0.005). Lastly, Zeb et al. (40) enrolled 65
asymptomatic, intermediate risk (baseline CAC >10) men aged
55 6 6 y, and treated them with KB AGE plus coenzyme Q10
compared with placebo. At 1 y, mean CAC progression was
significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo
group (32 6 6 compared with 58 6 8, P = 0.01).
Because CAC progression is associated with a greater risk of
IHD and, based on these 3 small scale studies, treatment with
garlic shows a decrease in the rate of progression of CAC, it can
be hypothesized that garlic may decrease rates of IHD. It should
be noted that, although all 3 studies used KB AGE, 2 studies used
additional treatments along with KB AGE, which may have
influenced the results.

 In addition to CAC, CT scans can characterize the quality of
the adipose tissue surrounding the coronary arteries into white
or brown epicardial adipose tissue (EAT). The composition of
EAT is important, because EAT is biologically active tissue that
influences rates of inflammation and atherosclerosis progres-
sion and overall stability of plaque via a host of hormones and
cytokines (41, 42). Although the biochemical process is complex
and not fully elucidated, overall, it has been shown that a higher
brown-to-white EAT ratio is favorable and is implicated with a
lower risk of IHD (43, 44).
With the advent of accurate methods of measuring brown-to-
white EAT ratios via CT scan technology, favorable changes in
the brown-to-white EAT ratio can be demonstrated over time.
KB AGE plus supplements significantly increased the brown-to-
white EAT ratio compared with placebo (125 6 38% compared
with 211 6 20%) (45).
PWV (arterial stiffness). Although not currently widely employed
clinically in North America, PWV is an easy to measure
noninvasive, operator independent, and highly reproducible
test of aortic stiffness that is a strong predictor of IHD (46).
This test, somewhat similar to the ankle-brachial index, can be
useful for the clinician for risk stratification. PVW quantifies
aortic stiffness by assessing the speed of blood flow in the aorta
by measuring the time elapsed between the carotid and a distal
pulse (e.g., radial or femoral). A meta-analysis of 17 studies in
over 15,000 patients showed that a high PWV is correlated to
an increased RR of an IHD event (2.26), cardiovascular disease
mortality (2.02), and all-cause mortality (1.90). Thus, in the
2007 European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology Guide-
line for the Management of Hypertension, PWV is incorporated
as a risk assessment tool for hypertensive patients not already at
high risk (47).
The Firefighter Aged Garlic Extract Investigation as a
Treatment for Heart Disease (FAITH) trial evaluated the effect
of garlic on PWV (48) in a randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled study of 65 intermediate-risk men. The study dem-
onstrated that after 1 y, the mean decrease in PWV was 1.21 m/s
in the intervention group (KB AGE plus coenzyme Q10)
compared with placebo (P = 0.005). Although a low PWV is
more favorable than a high PWV, it has yet to be shown that
lowering PWV is associated with better outcomes. Nonethe-
less, PWV is a promising clinical tool for risk stratification for
primary prevention and an easy target to follow if shown that
improvement correlates to better outcomes.
Biomarkers of inflammation. Several biomarkers are show-
ing promising results in terms of prediction of IHD events and
risk stratification regardless of specified mechanisms. Of these,
CRP is the most studied biomarker as a clinical predictor of
IHD and it is incorporated into the 2009 Canadian Cardio-
vascular Society guidelines for dyslipidemia and prevention
of cardiovascular disease (49). These guidelines recommend
the screening of men >50 y and women >60 who are at
moderate risk of IHD (determined by the Framingham risk)
and whose LDL cholesterol is <3.5 mmol/L. If these patients
have elevated CRP concentrations, it is recommended that
statin therapy be initiated, because statins lower CRP and
prevent IHD.
To our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis investigating the
effects of garlic on CRP. We identified 6 studies evaluating the
effects of garlic on CRP (31, 39, 40, 50–52). The only quality
trial that showed a correlation between treatment with garlic and
a lowered CRP concentration was by Zeb et al. (40). In that trial,
KB AGE plus coenzyme Q 10 were administered to 65
intermediate-risk patients for 1 y. CRP was reduced significantly
(20.12 6 0.24 mg/L) compared with placebo (0.91 6 0.56 mg/L).
The other 5 trials either had a poor design or showed no
effect.
Adverse events and drug interactions. Garlic is very safe
(53). However, there are some common side effects and rare
case reports. Not all trials and meta-analyses discuss side
effects, but the only statistically significant side effects of
garlic treatment are body odor and halitosis (25, 26, 53).
These side effects are most prominent with raw garlic and are
ameliorated in some odor-free garlic preparations, such as KB
AGE (53).
Some other common self-reported mild side effects are
gastrointestinal intolerabilities such as abdominal pain, bloat-
ing, and flatulence (25). However, dysphagia and garlic-induced
esophagitis with hematemesis or hematochezia have also been
reported, along with small-bowel obstruction without causality
established (53, 54).
Case reports of serious side effects include allergic reactions,
including anaphylaxis. Certain patients also exhibit allergic
symptoms such as dermatitis, rhinitis, asthma, urticaria, photo-
allergy, angioedema, and pemphigus (25, 53, 55).
There have been rare case reports of coagulation dysfunc-
tion with bleeding from excessive intake of garlic prepara-
tions (53). This includes spinal epidural hematoma, increased
clotting time, postoperative bleeding, and retrobulbar hem-
orrhage without proven causality. There have been 2 cases of
interaction with warfarin. However, Macan et al. (56) demon-
strated that aged garlic extract may be safe with warfarin
therapy.
Discussion
Based on the current available literature, garlic has shown
favorable effects on several clinically relevant risk factors that
not only help prognosticate but can alter management strategies
for patients in the primary prevention of IHD. One of the
challenges of studying the effects of garlic is the standardization
of the preparation or active ingredient. KB AGE has shown the
most consistent results, because the product is standardized to a
certain level of N-acetylcysteine before packaging. Nonetheless,
numerous trials and meta-analyses have shown favorable effects
from garlic on well-accepted risk factors such as hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia. SBP and DBP have been shown to
be reduced by 7–16 mm Hg and 5–9 mm Hg, respectively,
compared with placebo. TC has been shown to be reduced by
7.4–29.8 mg/dL. Although larger studies for clinical endpoints
of morbidity and mortality have not been assessed, in a few
small studies, garlic has shown favorable effects for surrogate
endpoints such as CAC progression rates. Small studies have
also shown garlic to improve practical clinical prognosticators
such as PWV and CRP. Garlic is generally safe with mild
gastrointestinal discomfort as the most common intolerability,
which can be abated if an odor-free preparation such as KB AGE
is used. As one of the oldest medicinal remedies ever applied,
it deserves closer evaluation for its possible cardiovascular
disease risk benefits.
