ABSTRACT
Aims: To compare economic and clinical outcomes between patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-
en-Y gastric bypass (LRY) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with use of powered vs manual
endoscopic surgical staplers.
Materials and methods: Patients (aged �21 years) who underwent LRY or LSG during a hospital
admission (January 1, 2012–September 30, 2015) were identified from the Premier Perspective Hospital
Database. Use of powered vs manual staplers was identified from hospital administrative billing
records. Multivariable analyses were used to compare the following outcomes between the powered
and manual stapler groups, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and hospital-level cluster-
ing: hospital length of stay (LOS), total hospital costs, medical/surgical supply costs, room and board
costs, operating room costs, operating room time, discharge status, bleeding/transfusion during the
hospital admission, and 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmissions.
Results: The powered and manual stapler groups comprised 9,851 patients (mean age¼ 44.6 years;
79.3% female) and 21,558 patients (mean age¼ 45.0 years; 78.0% female), respectively. In the multivari-
able analyses, adjusted mean hospital LOS was 2.1 days for both the powered and manual stapler
groups (p ¼ .981). Adjusted mean total hospital costs ($12,415 vs $13,547, p ¼ .003), adjusted mean
supply costs ($4,629 vs $5,217, p ¼ .011), and adjusted mean operating room costs ($4,126 vs $4,413,
p ¼ .009) were significantly lower in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rate of bleed-
ing and/or transfusion during the hospital admission (2.46% vs 3.22%, p ¼ .025) was significantly lower
in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rates of 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmis-
sions were similar between the groups (all p > .05). Sub-analysis by manufacturer showed similar
results.
Limitations: This observational study cannot establish causal linkages.
Conclusions: In this analysis of patients who underwent LRY or LSG, the use of powered staplers was
associated with better economic outcomes, and a lower rate of bleeding/transfusion vs manual staplers
in the real-world setting.

Introduction
According to the data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, 37.7% of adults in the US were obese
(body mass index [BMI]: �30 kg/m2) and 7.7% had severe
obesity (BMI: �40 kg/m2) in the 2013 to 2014 timeframe1.
The association between severe obesity and adverse health
risks, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension,
cardiovascular
and
cerebrovascular
disease,
and
cancer,
among others, has been well documented2. In the US, the
medical costs associated with obesity have been estimated at
$209.7 billion annually in 2008 dollars, with the majority of
the costs attributed to treating cardiovascular disease and
type 2 diabetes3–5.
Bariatric surgery is considered an effective procedure
for stimulating significant weight loss and improving obesi-
ty-related comorbidities among severely obese persons2,6,7.
According to an analysis based on the Nationwide Inpatient
Sample database, the number of bariatric surgeries per-
formed in the US from 2008–2012 was estimated at 598,5768.
Bariatric surgery techniques have evolved over the last dec-
ade, and nearly all surgeries are currently performed using
the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach, which is asso-
ciated with shorter hospital stays and lower complication
rates than the open approach8–10. Of the laparoscopic bariat-
ric surgeries that are currently performed, the two most com-
mon
are
laparoscopic
sleeve
gastrectomy
(LSG)
and
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRY), which together

 accounted for 97.7% of bariatric procedures performed at
academic medical centers in 201411. LSG is a relatively newer
procedure than LRY, and its use has grown rapidly over the
past several years, from less than one quarter of bariatric pro-
cedures at academic medical centers in the 4th quarter of
2011, to over 60% in the second quarter of 201411.
Endoscopic surgical stapling devices (henceforth, staplers)
were introduced to facilitate tissue approximation and tran-
section during endoscopic surgery12. Staplers simplify the
procedure and require less skill of the surgeon, but have
been associated with complications, including leakage from
staple lines, bleeding, and fistula formation13–15. The first
powered stapler (i.e. those for which the staples and the
knife blade are driven not by manual force but instead by a
power source) was approved for launch by the US FDA in
2010 for Covidien (now Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) under
the
brand
name
“iDriveTM
powered
stapling
system”16.
Subsequently, Ethicon (Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ)
received approval to launch their ECHELON FLEXTM Powered
ENDOPATH Stapler in the US in 201112. Both manufacturers
have since introduced subsequent versions of their powered
endoscopic stapling devices, namely the ‘iDriveTM Ultra pow-
ered stapling system’ from Covidien/Medtronic, and the
‘ECHELON FLEXTM Powered Plus Stapler’ with the ‘ECHELON
FLEXTM GST System’ from Ethicon/Johnson & Johnson.
These powered staplers were developed to increase stabil-
ity and enable more precise stapling relative to non-powered
(manual) staplers. It is currently unclear, however, the extent
to which such potential differences between the operation
and performance of powered vs manual staplers translate
into any differences in economic and clinical outcomes in the
real-world setting. Thus, we conducted a large, retrospective,
observational study in which we compared economic and
clinical outcomes of US patients who underwent LRY or LSG
with use of powered vs manual staplers.
Methods
Data and patient selection
This study’s data source was the Premier Perspective Hospital
Database, which comprises administrative and hospital billing
information for all hospital discharges occurring within more
than 600 hospitals throughout the US. The database contains
discharge-level information on all International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
diagnoses and procedures recorded during each admission, a
date-stamped log and cost of all billed items by cost-
accounting department, administrative records on length of
stay and discharge status, and selected information on
patient,
provider,
hospital,
and
insurance
characteristics.
Although the database excludes federally funded hospitals
(e.g. Veterans Affairs), the hospitals included therein are
nationally representative based on bed size, geographic
region, location (urban/rural), and teaching status.
Figure 1 shows the study’s patient selection process.
Patients selected for study underwent elective LRY or LSG, as
evidenced by ICD-9-CM procedure coding (See Supplemental
Appendix 1 for a listing of all codes used in the study) during
a
hospital
admission
between
January
1,
2012
and
September 30, 2015. The first hospital admission for LRY or
LSG during this period was defined as the index admission,
and patients were required to be at least 21 years of age at
the time of the index admission. Patients were also required
to have an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code indicative of BMI
�30 kg/m2. Patients were excluded from the study if they
had missing data on hospital supply, room and board, or
total hospital costs, if they were transferred from another
institution, or if they had other bariatric procedures during
the index admission.
Use of either powered or manual staplers during the index
admission was identified from hospital administrative records
by searching for various combinations of device names
(e.g. iDriveTM powered stapling system), model numbers (e.g.
PCE45A), and/or descriptors of devices being “powered”.
Staplers
were
also
further
classified
by
manufacturer
(Medtronic powered, Medtronic manual; Ethicon powered;
Ethicon manual) to support sensitivity analyses, as described
below. Only patients for whom a stapler used during the
index admission could be identified as either powered or
manual were retained for study; patients with evidence of
both powered and manual staplers were excluded from the
study, due to the inability to assign them to one of the two
study groups.

 Measurement of patient and hospital/provider
characteristics
Patient demographics and hospital/provider characteristics
measured during the index admission included age, sex,
marital status, race, payer type, urban vs rural hospital, hos-
pital teaching status, hospital geographic region, hospital
bed size, operating physician specialty, year of surgery/index
admission, annual hospital surgical volume for LRY and LSG,
and an indicator for whether hospital costs are derived from
a cost-to-charge ratio vs procedural costing. Patient clinical
characteristics measured during the index admission included
BMI, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)17, the day on
which the LRY or LSG surgery was performed after hospital
admission,
and
several
individual
comorbidities
(alcohol
abuse, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart fail-
ure, depression, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, liver
disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease,
pulmonary circulation disorders, renal failure, rheumatoid
arthritis, valvular disease). Comorbidities and the CCI were
measured through the presence of ICD-9-CM codes, exclud-
ing those for which there was an indication that the comor-
bidity was not present on admission.
Measurement of economic and clinical outcomes
Economic and clinical outcomes evaluated during the index
admission included hospital length of stay (LOS), total hos-
pital costs, medical/surgical supply costs, room and board
costs, operating room costs, operating room time (informa-
tion on operating room time was available for most [93.6%]
of the patients, and this outcome was analyzed only among
patients with such information available), discharge to a
home or home health organization vs other setting (e.g.
skilled nursing facility), the composite complication of bleed-
ing and/or transfusion based on ICD-9-CM codes and hospital
billing records for transfusion supplies, and all-cause readmis-
sions within 30, 60, and 90 days post-discharge. All costs
were inflation adjusted to 2015 US dollars using the Medical
Care
component
of
the
US
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics
Consumer Price Index. Within the study protocol, the bleed-
ing and/or transfusion and all-cause readmission outcomes
were designated as exploratory, while other outcomes were
designated as primary. The exploratory outcomes were desig-
nated as such due to uncertainty regarding the validity of
clinical coding (in the case of bleeding and/or transfusion)
and because readmissions to the hospital within the Premier
Perspective Hospital Database are captured only when the
patient returns to the hospital in which the index admission
took place, thereby introducing the potential for incomplete
outcome data capture.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted for the overall population
and were repeated separating the overall population into
surgery type sub-groups (LRY or LSG). Bivariate analyses,
stratified by the powered vs manual stapler groups, were
utilized to describe patient and hospital/provider characteris-
tics and unadjusted outcomes.
Multivariable regression models were used to compare
outcomes between the powered vs manual stapler group,
adjusting for all of the above-mentioned patient and hos-
pital/provider characteristics. All models used link functions
and error distributions which were tailored to the empirical
distribution of the outcome variable based on the Modified
Park test18,19, specifically: log link and negative binomial or
Poisson error distribution for length of stay; log link and
gamma error distribution for costs; log link and Poisson error
distribution for operating room time; and logit link and bino-
mial error distribution for the remaining dichotomous out-
comes (discharge to a home or home health organization vs
other setting, the composite complication of bleeding and/or
transfusion, and all-cause readmissions within 30, 60, and 90
days post-discharge). To account for the hospital-level clus-
tered nature of the data, Generalized Estimating Equations
(GEE) models were initially tested using an exchangeable
working correlation structure—chosen based on a qualitative
understanding of the potential nature of clustering within
hospitals. For the model of room and board costs in the
overall sample and all models of operating room time, an
independent working correlation structure was substituted,
because the models initially failed to converge. When neither
an exchangeable nor independent working correlation struc-
ture resulted in model convergence, which was the case for
all models of all-cause readmissions, Mixed Models were
used in order to account for hospital-level clustering.
Adjusted outcomes were generated for each of the com-
parator groups using the least squares means approach
based on observed margins. In the GEE models, inference
was based on empirical (robust) standard error estimates. A
two-sided critical value of 0.05 was used to determine statis-
tical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.3.
Sub-group and sensitivity analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to address poten-
tial issues of confounding or effect modification. First, in
order to test whether the powered vs manual findings were
driven by manufacturer-level phenomena, a sensitivity ana-
lysis was conducted in which the multivariable models were
repeated comparing patients undergoing bariatric surgery
with use of an Ethicon-manufactured powered stapler (which
account for the majority of powered staplers) to those with
use of a Medtronic-manufactured manual stapler. This ana-
lysis was also of interest, owing to the fact that these two
categories of staplers formed the majority in the powered
and manual platforms.
Next, the concomitant use of a buttress during the sur-
gery was explored. According to the 2012 International Sleeve
Gastrectomy Expert Panel Consensus Statement, the use of sta-
ple line reinforcement, such as a buttress or over-sewing the
staple line, is thought to reduce bleeding along the staple
line20–23. However, staple line reinforcement has been shown
to
be
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
leaks
in

425
 observational studies21–23. Although the Premier Perspective
Hospital Database does not contain information to support
identification of over-sewing the staple line, buttress materi-
als can be identified from hospital administrative records by
searching for billing records of buttress materials. Thus, to
address buttress as a potential confounding factor, a sensitiv-
ity analysis was conducted, using the overall population, in
which unadjusted outcome data were compared between
the sub-set of the powered and manual stapler groups,
which had evidence of buttress, to examine whether these
outcome data differed meaningfully from the primary ana-
lysis. A separate sensitivity analysis was conducted in which
buttress was included as a covariate in the multivariable
models—a variable which was not included in the primary
analysis due to the likely low sensitivity of search algorithms
to identify buttress materials (i.e. the absence of identified
buttress materials does not necessarily indicate that it was
not actually used).
Finally, circular staplers may be used to create the gastro-
jejunostomy anastomosis as an alternative to the staplers of
interest under study, which introduces potential for use of
another device in an important step of the LRY. There are
presently mixed data on whether circular staplers increase
the risk of complications in in LRY24,25; however, if this tech-
nique correlates with use of powered vs manual staplers, it is
possible that it could be a confounding factor for a number
of the study outcomes—particularly costs arising from use of
a second device. Thus, another sensitivity analysis was per-
formed in which circular stapler use was included as a covari-
ate in the multivariable models for the sub-group of patients
undergoing LRY. This variable was not included in the pri-
mary analyses for the same reason noted for buttress above;
bivariate analysis in the sub-group of LRY patients who had
evidence of circular stapler use was not undertaken due to a
small number of patients for whom there was such evidence.
Results
Patient and hospital/provider characteristics
Patient demographics, patient clinical characteristics, and
hospital/provider characteristics are shown in in Tables 1–3,
respectively. Of the overall study population (n ¼ 31,409),
9,851 patients (mean age ¼ 44.6 years; 79.3% female) were in
the powered stapler group, and 21,558 patients (mean
age ¼ 45.0 years; 78.0% female) were in the manual stapler
group. Among patients in the overall study population’s
powered stapler group, 91.8% underwent bariatric surgery
with use of an Ethicon-manufactured powered stapler, while
8.2% underwent bariatric surgery with use of a Medtronic-
manufactured powered stapler. Among patients in the overall
study population’s manual stapler group, 44.6% underwent
bariatric surgery with use of an Ethicon-manufactured man-
ual stapler, while 57.6% underwent bariatric surgery with use

 of a Medtronic-manufactured manual stapler; a small propor-
tion of patients had evidence of both manufacturers’ brands
of manual staplers being used. These proportions were rela-
tively similar in the LRY and LSG sub-groups.
The majority of patients in the overall study population
were
between
the
ages
of
35
and
54
years
(power-
ed ¼ 55.9%; manual ¼ 55.6%), white (powered ¼ 68.2%; man-
ual ¼ 60.9%),
and
had
commercial
insurance
coverage
(powered ¼ 58.6%; manual ¼ 61.1%). Most were admitted for
laparoscopic bariatric surgery at large (bed size ¼ 300 to
>500: powered ¼ 67.3%; manual ¼ 71.0%), teaching (power-
ed ¼ 62.2%;
manual ¼ 52.1%),
urban
hospitals
(power-
ed ¼ 93.4%; manual ¼ 87.2%). The hospitals to which the
patients were admitted were primarily located in the South
and Northeast regions of the US, reflecting the regional dis-
tribution
of
the
hospitals
contained
in
the
Premier
Perspective Hospital Database.
Of the overall study population, 54.5% of patients in the
powered stapler group and 51.7% of patients in the manual
stapler group had a BMI between 40.0–49.9 kg/m2. Most
patients had CCI scores of 2 and below (powered ¼ 90.3%;
manual ¼ 89.9%).
The
most
prevalent
of
the
examined
comorbidities were hypertension (powered ¼ 57.2%; man-
ual ¼ 60.1%), diabetes (powered ¼ 30.2%; manual ¼ 33.5%),
and depression (powered ¼ 27.0%; manual ¼ 25.5%).
Of the sub-group of patients who underwent LRY, 4,057
patients (mean age ¼ 44.9 years; 81.0% female) were in the
powered stapler group, and 9,613 patients (mean age ¼ 45.8
years; 77.7% female) were in the manual stapler group. Of
the
sub-group
of
patients
who
underwent
LSG,
5,794
patients (mean age ¼ 44.5 years; 78.1% female) were in the
powered stapler group, and 11,945 patients (mean age ¼ 44.4
years; 78.3% female) were in the manual stapler group.
Unadjusted outcomes
Unadjusted outcomes are shown in Table 4. Statistical hypoth-
esis testing was not performed for the unadjusted outcomes.

S. ROY ET AL.
 Mean hospital LOS was 2.0 days for both the powered and
manual stapler groups in the overall population (standard
deviation ¼ 1.5 for the powered stapler group and 1.8 for the
manual stapler group). Among patients in the powered stapler
group, mean total hospital costs, supply costs, and room and
board costs were $11,478, $4,758, and $1,870, respectively;
mean operating room time was 136.6 min, and operating
room costs were $3,532. Among patients in the manual stap-
ler group, mean total hospital costs, supply costs, and room
and board costs were $13,388, $5,257, and $2,025, respect-
ively; mean operating room time was 160.5 min, and operating
room costs were $4,425.
Most patients in the powered (99.6%) or manual (98.6%)
stapler groups were discharged to home or a home health
organization. Among patients in the powered stapler group,
2.4% had a diagnosis or hospital billing record indicative of
bleeding or a transfusion during the index admission. Among
patients in the manual stapler group, 3.6% had a diagnosis
or hospital billing record indicative of bleeding or a transfu-
sion during the index admission. In the powered stapler
group, 2.0% had records indicative of bleeding, and 1.6% of
patients had records indicative of transfusion (1.1% had
both). In the manual stapler group, 2.1% had records
indicative of bleeding and 2.7% of patients had records indi-
cative of transfusion (1.1% had both). Thirty-, 60-, and 90-day
all-cause
readmission
rates
among
patients
in
the
powered stapler group were 4.4%, 5.0%, and 5.5%, respect-
ively. Thirty-, 60-, and 90-day all-cause readmission rates
among patients in the manual stapler group were 4.7%,
5.5%, and 6.0%, respectively.
Multivariable regression-adjusted outcomes
Multivariable regression-adjusted outcomes are shown in
Table 5. Among patients in the overall study population, after
adjusting for differences in patient and hospital/provider
characteristics, adjusted mean hospital LOS was 2.05 days
(p ¼ .981) for both the powered and the manual stapler
groups. Adjusted mean total hospital costs ($12,415 vs
$13,547,
p ¼ .003)
and
supply
costs
($4,629
vs
$5,217,
p ¼ .011) were statistically significantly lower in the powered
vs manual stapler group. Adjusted mean operating room
time, on which information was available for 92.7% of the
powered staple group and 94.0% of the manual stapler
group, was numerically lower in the powered vs manual
stapler group, but this difference did not reach the statistical

Sensitivity analyses
Multivariable-regression adjusted outcomes for the sensitiv-
ity analyses comparing the Ethicon-manufactured power
staplers
to
Medtronic-manufactured
manual
staplers
are
shown in Table 6. The results were largely consistent with
the
primary
analyses,
although
the
magnitude
of
the
adjusted mean cost differences generally increased relative
to the primary analyses. For example, in the primary analy-
ses involving the overall study population, adjusted mean
total hospital costs were $1,132 lower for the powered vs
manual stapler group; this cost difference grew to be
$1,777 lower
for
the
Ethicon-manufactured powered
vs
Medtronic-manufactured manual stapler group. A few other
differences were also evident, including: the loss of statis-
tical significance on differences for operating room cost for
all analyses; the loss of statistical significance on differences
for bleeding/transfusion in the sub-group of patients under-
going LSG (to p ¼ .0577); the introduction of statistical sig-
nificance on differences for room and board costs for the
overall study population and the sub-group of patients
undergoing LSG; the introduction of statistical significance
on differences for operating room time for the overall
study population and the sub-group of patients undergoing
LRY; and the introduction of statistical significance on dif-
ferences for bleeding/transfusion and supply costs in the
sub-group of patients undergoing LRY.
In the powered staple group, 22.9% (overall) and 14.0%
(LRY sub-group) of patients had evidence of staple line but-
tress use and circular stapler use, respectively; in the man-
ual stapler group, these proportions were 14.8% and 10.3%.
The sensitivity analyses examining the potential role of sta-
ple line reinforcement through buttress in the overall study
population and the use of circular staplers in the sub-group
of patients who underwent LRY yielded results that were
highly consistent with the primary analyses in terms of
both magnitude and statistical significance. The detailed
results
of
these

analyses

Discussion
To our knowledge, based on a review of the literature, the
present study is the first to compare economic and clinical
outcomes between patients undergoing laparoscopic bariat-
ric surgery with powered vs manual staplers. We found that,
among the overall population of patients who underwent
either LRY or LSG, total hospital costs, supply costs, and oper-
ating room costs were lower for the powered stapler group
vs the manual stapler group. Furthermore, we found that the
rate of bleeding and/or transfusions during the index hospi-
talization was lower for the powered stapler group vs the
manual stapler group. The relative incremental clinical and
economic benefits of powered staplers were more prominent
among patients who had undergone LSG than among
patients who had undergone LRY; although they were gener-
ally directionally consistent across the two surgical sub-
groups.
Owing to the unique nature of the present study’s find-
ings, there are currently no studies to which the findings
regarding the primary objective of comparing powered vs
manual endocutters can be compared. However, other prior
studies examining selected outcomes that were examined in
the present study have reported relatively similar overall
findings. For example, in three prior longitudinal cohort
studies of patients undergoing bariatric surgeries (separately
representing 19,651, 28,616, and 57,918 patients) including
LRYGB, LSG, and other types of bariatric surgeries, the aver-
age hospital length of stay was reported to be 2.5 days26,
which is relatively similar to the 2.0 days reported in the
present study. The half-day difference between the prior
studies and the present study may be driven by the fact
that there has been a secular trend of decreasing hospital
lengths of stay over time27 and that the present study’s
430

 time period spanned 2012–2015, whereas the aforemen-
tioned studies’ time periods spanned 2004–May 31, 2013,
2007–2010, and 2007–2009. The present study’s rate of
bleeding (overall, 3.2%) is also similar to what was reported
in a prior meta-analysis, which reported bleeding rates
between
1.2–3.5%22.
Furthermore,
the
present
study’s
readmission rate at 30 days (4.4%) is similar to that of prior
studies (3.5–5%26). Finally, in one prior single-center study
examining
patients
undergoing
LRYGB
at
the
Stanford
University Medical Center between May 2008 and November
2013,
the
mean
operating
room
time
ranged
from
202–235 min,
which
is
relatively
similar
to
the
present
study’s mean operating room time of �183 min in the sub-
group of patients undergoing LRYGB28.
Despite the present lack of data that are directly compar-
able to those of the present study, the underlying hypothesis
for why differences may be expected between powered and
manual staplers is somewhat intuitive and may help to con-
textualize the present study’s findings.
Part of the benefit of the powered device (which in the
present study was represented mostly by Ethicon staplers)
may be derived from the combination of increased stability,
along
with
superior
control
of
tissue
movement
with
advanced reloads that are available on these devices that
potentially cause less damage to tissue, and help with forma-
tion of a more integrated staple-line. In benchtop testing on
porcine stomach tissue, Ethicon’s powered staplers were
found to reduce movement at the distal tip by 88% com-
pared to manually-fired devices, thus potentially causing less
trauma
to
adjacent
tissue
during
thick
transections29.
Specifically, surgeons (n ¼ 19) fired each instrument/reload
once
(PSE60A/ECR60G,
030449/030459,
and
EGIAUSTND/
EGIA60AMT); median reduction of distal tip motion was 88%,
with a range of reduction of 71–95%29. In pre-clinical analy-
ses, fewer staple malformations were reported with the
Ethicon’s powered stapling device compared to its non-pow-
ered version when fired on porcine small bowel specimens30.
Clinical studies in the US, Europe, and Asia have also

and

combinations31,32.
The other, more surgeon-related benefit may be derived
from the speed and the procedural economy of effort which
powered staplers allow in effectively executing 6–8 firings in
a bariatric procedure. This may be offering the surgeon, who
is required to make several decisions in each steps of the
procedure, the psychological freedom to focus on the patient
and to plan ahead for the next steps. Surgeons agree that
improved endoscopic linear stapling device stability is a crit-
ical component of surgery and is likely to result in more fre-
quent positive surgical outcomes33. This could potentially
reduce surgery stress based on the interesting theoretical
framework of the biopsychosocial model (BPSM) of challenge
and threat34 that has been applied to explain differences in
stress reaction to surgical device use35. The framework is pre-
dicated upon the surgeon’s evaluation of the demands of a
procedure compared against the possession or availability of
necessary resources to cope effectively with such demands34.
When resources are perceived to be sufficient, a “challenge”
state occurs, resulting in a surgeon experiencing more favor-
able cognitive, affective, physiological, and behavioral out-
comes. In contrast, if a surgeon perceives that she/he does
not possess the resources required to meet the demands of
the situation, a “threat” state emerges. It has also been
shown that poor surgical performance may arise when sur-
geons evaluate a stressful event as a “threat” instead of a
“challenge”36. Differences in bleeding complication/transfu-
sion rates could potentially be driven by this combination of
device- and surgeon-driven factors that favor the use of pow-
ered endoscopic staplers.
Although we were unable to precisely pinpoint the drivers
of the lower total hospital costs in the powered stapler
group, the largest cost sub-category differences between the
powered and manual stapler groups were observed in supply
costs and operating room costs. Future analyses should
attempt to understand what changes in supply requirements
drive the observed lower supply costs. We observed a direc-
tionally lower, although not reaching statistical significance,
operating room time for the powered stapler group, which
may in part explain the lower operating room costs for the
powered stapler group.
Limitations
This study was subject to limitations. First, large administra-
tive databases containing real-world healthcare data are, in
general, currently limited with respect to detailed information
on medical devices. Although the development and dissem-
ination of Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) into such databases
will substantially improve the ability to study medical devices
in a real-world setting, the present-day reality is that devices
used within the hospital setting must primarily be identified
through
search
of
non-standardized
text
fields
which
describe the device in an electronic medical record or hos-
pital billing system. Such search strategies may theoretically
have relatively high positive predictive value for the identifi-
cation of target devices; however, they may lack sensitivity to
identify all instances of the use of a given device or technol-
ogy. Second, as is the case with any coded healthcare data-
base,
there
is
a
potential
for
measurement
error
or
misclassification arising from codes being recorded incor-
rectly or incorrect recording of a given device’s usage. Third,
although we used multivariable regression models to control
for multiple potential confounders, as well as hospital-level
clustering, laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures are com-
plex, and their outcomes are driven by factors which we
could not measure well, including but not limited to surgeon
experience, surgeon technique when utilizing
a stapler,
patient tissue quality and thickness, and its interplay with
staple height selection, prior surgeries, and the utilization of
other
devices
that
might
facilitate
the
procedure
(e.g.
advanced energy dissectors); thus, our findings cannot be
interpreted as causal. When considering the measured covari-
ates, however, magnitudes of differences between the pow-
ered and manual stapler cohorts were generally small,
despite some statistically significant differences driven by the
large study sample sizes. Finally, the Premier Perspective
Hospital Database is a non-probability sample which may not
necessarily reflect the mix of institutional and surgeon experi-
ence of all hospitals in the US or populations residing in
other countries.
Conclusions
In this large-scale analysis of patients who underwent LRY or
LSG, the use of powered staplers was associated with better
economic outcomes and a lower rate of bleeding complica-
tion/transfusion compared to manual staplers in the real-
world setting.
