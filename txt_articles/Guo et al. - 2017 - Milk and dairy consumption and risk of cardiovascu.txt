Abstract
With a growing number of prospective cohort
studies, an updated dose–response meta-analysis of milk
and dairy products with all-cause mortality, coronary heart
disease (CHD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been
conducted. PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for
articles published up to September 2016. Random-effect
meta-analyses with summarised dose–response data were
performed
for
total
(high-fat/low-fat)
dairy,
milk,
fermented dairy, cheese and yogurt. Non-linear associa-
tions were investigated using the spine models and
heterogeneity by subgroup analyses. A total of 29 cohort
studies were available for meta-analysis, with 938,465
participants and 93,158 mortality, 28,419 CHD and 25,416
CVD cases. No associations were found for total (high-fat/
low-fat) dairy, and milk with the health outcomes of
mortality, CHD or CVD. Inverse associations were found
between total fermented dairy (included sour milk prod-
ucts, cheese or yogurt; per 20 g/day) with mortality (RR
0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99; I2 = 94.4%) and CVD risk (RR
0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99; I2 = 87.5%). Further analyses of
individual fermented dairy of cheese and yogurt showed
cheese to have a 2% lower risk of CVD (RR 0.98, 95% CI
0.95–1.00; I2 = 82.6%) per 10 g/day, but not yogurt. All of
these marginally inverse associations of totally fermented
dairy and cheese were attenuated in sensitivity analyses by
removing one large Swedish study. This meta-analysis
combining
data
from
29
prospective
cohort
studies
demonstrated neutral associations between dairy products
and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. For future
studies it is important to investigate in more detail how
dairy products can be replaced by other foods.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
mortality and disability worldwide [1]. Together with
smoking, obesity and inactivity, diet is considered to be
one of the most important prevention strategies for CVD

 [2]. Milk and dairy foods have been recommended in most
dietary guidelines around the world, but the association of
milk or dairy food consumption with CVD is still contro-
versial [3, 4]. An earlier meta-analysis [5] which included
17 prospective cohort studies showed that milk intake was
not associated with total mortality or CHD mortality, but
there was a borderline significant inverse association with
CVD mortality based on limited studies. There were not
enough data to examine the effects of other dairy products
or milk fat content. Since then, further prospective cohort
studies have been published. For example, one recent
Swedish publication with two large Swedish cohorts [6]
reported that higher milk consumption was associated with
a doubling of mortality risk including CVD mortality in the
cohort of women. Since this paper was published in 2014,
there has been mounting debate from different researchers
regarding its seemingly contradictory results [7, 8]. This
has caused new uncertainty about the effects of milk and
dairy intake on human health. Recently, new meta-analyses
of dairy consumption and risk of stroke [9], butter and risk
of CVD, diabetes and mortality [10] have been published,
showing predominantly neutral or marginally beneficial
associations for all dairy products. Therefore, we con-
ducted a comprehensive dose–response meta-analysis to
examine linear and non-linear associations between milk
and dairy products with all-cause mortality, CHD and CVD
events using existing prospective cohort studies of ade-
quate quality.
Methods
Literature search and study selection
This review was conducted based on guidelines of Meta-
analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology [11].
Prospective cohort studies published up to Sep 2016
(without
language
restriction)
were
searched
using
PubMed, Embase, and Scopus database, the query syntax
of searching is shown in the Supplemental Methods (see
search strategy). After excluding duplicates and based on
titles and abstracts, we excluded studies on animals,
baseline age B18 years, or populations with prior CVD,
diabetes, or any other chronic diseases. Eligible studies
were selected by using predefined inclusion criteria of
prospective cohort studies, healthy populations and original
articles on the association of milk and dairy intake and all-
cause mortality, CHD or CVD. In addition, supplementary
hand searching of reference lists of previous reviews or
meta-analyses was conducted. Of 59 eligible full articles,
29 articles [6, 12–39] met the inclusion criteria (see Fig. 1).
Several authors or coworkers provided additional data for
this meta-analysis [14, 16, 19, 23, 27, 28, 32, 34, 37, 40].
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted from published articles by using a
structured extraction form, which included descriptive
characteristics of the study, range of intake, median intake,
number of participants, number of mortalities, CHD or
CVD cases, person-years at risk, and relative risk (RR)
with 95% CI for each unit of dairy intake. For studies that
reported
results
from
different
multivariable-adjusted
models, the model with the most confounding factors was
extracted for the meta-analysis. If dairy intake was pre-
sented
in
servings
or
times
per
period
of
time
[12–20, 22, 23, 34–36, 39], we converted the portion size
into grams per day by using standard units of 244 g for
milk (585 g for 1 pint of milk); 244 g for yoghurt and 40 g
for cheese [41, 42]. One serving of total dairy, high-fat
dairy and low-fat dairy was taken to be 200 g, similar to
our previous meta-analysis [5]. When studies reported
country specific conversion factors, these were used to
calculate intake as g/day [26, 29, 30].
In some studies the mean intakes of dairy categories
were not reported, in which case we calculated the mean
value by using the lower and upper limit. For open-ended
upper limits of intake, the same range as the lower category
was applied. The categories of dairy types were defined in
accordance with the definition in the original articles
(Supplemental Table 2).
Two independent reviewers determined the quality of
the 29 studies based on the Newcastle–Ottawa quality
assessment scale (NOS, Supplemental Methods) [43]. By
evaluation of selection, comparability and outcome, the
rating system scores studies from 0 (highest degree of bias)
to 9 (lowest degree of bias). Additionally we investigated
the funding sources of all of the eligible studies. The four
categories of funding were recorded as industry, partial
funded by industry, research institution and unknown.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analyses of each dairy type were performed if the
number of studies was three or more. Splined variables
were generated by MKSPLINE in STATA version 13.0 to
determine the most appropriate knot points of nonlinear
associations from goodness-of-fit tests and Chi square
statistics. Spine analysis and dose–response generalised
least-square trend (GLST) meta-analysis were applied for
the further analysis of linear or nonlinear associations.
Incremental dose–response RRs were derived from the
random-effects meta-regression trend estimation of sum-
marised dose–response data. Ding’s spaghetti plot was
used to present the shapes of the association within indi-
vidual studies, as described previously [44]. Forest plots
were created to assess the linear dose–response slopes and

 corresponding 95% CI across relative studies with incre-
ments of 200 g/day for total, high-fat, and low-fat dairy;
244 g/day for milk; 20 g/day for total fermented dairy
(includes cheese, yogurt and soured milk products);
10 g/day for cheese; 50 g/day for yogurt. Sensitivity
analysis was based on linear dose–response slopes by
excluding one study population at a time.
To explore heterogeneity between studies, I-squared was
calculated from Cochrane Q test [45]. In addition, sub-
group analyses were performed providing that at least 6
study populations were available by age (B50 years,
[
50 years), follow-up duration (B10 years, [
10 years),
gender (men, women, both men and women), continent,
confounding factors (whether analyses were or were not
adjusted for the following 7 confounders age, sex, smok-
ing, alcohol, body mass index (BMI), physical activity,
food energy intake), BMI (B25 kg/m2, [
25 kg/m2) and
Newcastle–Ottawa quality score\or C7. When number of
the examined studies C10, potential publication bias was
assessed by means of the Eggers test [46] and symmetry of
the funnel plot. All of the statistical analyses were per-
formed in STATA version 13.0 (StataCorp. College Sta-
tion, Texas, USA). Two-sided P values \
0.05 were
considered as statistically significant.
Results
Overviews of key characteristics of the 29 prospective
cohort studies are shown in Table 1. The included partic-
ipants of each dairy exposure data on all-cause mortality,
CHD or CVD are presented in Table 2. A total of 783,989
participants, 93,158 mortality cases, 28,419 CHD and
25,416 CVD were included in the analysis. There were 3
studies conducted in Asia (Japan and Taiwan) [28, 35, 39],
2 studies in Australia [24, 29], 7 in the United States
[12, 14–16, 19, 22, 34] and the remaining 17 studies in
Europe. A total of 6 studies presented sex-specific results, 3
studies were in men [18–20] and 3 in women [15, 16, 30].
There was one study [12] with missing data on age and 4
studies with missing BMI data [12, 21, 33, 36]. The esti-
mated mean age was 57 years (range 34–80 years) and
mean value of BMI was 25.4 kg/m2 (range 22.3–27.1 kg/
m2). The duration of follow-up ranged from 5 to 25 years,
with a mean follow-up of 13 years. Study characteristics of
each dairy intake category by outcomes are shown in
Table 2. Results of quality assessment are shown in the
Supplemental Table 1, with 18 studies scoring C7. All of
the studies were funded by a research institute except one
study [13] without funding information, thus sub-group
analysis was not conducted by funding source. There was
no evidence of publication bias in the meta-analyses of
milk or dairy consumption with different health outcomes
(Supplemental Figs. 19–27).
Total, high-fat, and low-fat dairy
Total dairy intake (per 200 g/day) was not associated with
the risk of all-cause mortality (Supplemental Figure 1; RR
0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.03, 10 populations), CHD (Supple-
mental Figure 2; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.02, 12 popu-
lations) or CVD (Supplemental Figure 3; RR 0.97, 95%
CI 0.91–1.02). Considerable heterogeneity was observed

 P = 0.005) and CVD (I2 = 59.9%, P = 0.015) but not
CHD (I2 = 38.9%, P = 0.081). In sensitivity analyses,
heterogeneity among studies of the mortality could be
reduced to 50% (P = 0.042) with a RR of 1.00 (95% CI
0.97–1.04) by excluding the study of Soedamah-Muthu
et al. [31]; the heterogeneity among studies of CVD was
reduced (I2 = 11.2, P = 0.338) after removing the study
of Hu et al. [16] with a resulting RR of 0.98 (95% CI
0.96–1.00). Sub-group analyses of CHD (Supplemental
Table 4) indicated inverse associations for study popula-
tions with a mean age [
50 years (RR 0.97, 95% CI
0.94–1.00, 8 populations) and also for studies which did
not adjust for 7 major confounders defined in methods as
age, sex, smoking, alcohol, BMI, physical activity, food
energy
intake
(RR
0.94,
95%
CI
0.88–1.00,
3
populations).
High-fat dairy intake (per 200 g/day) showed no asso-
ciation with mortality (Supplemental Figure 4; RR 0.96,
95% CI 0.88–1.05, 5 populations), CHD (Supplemental
Figure 5; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93–1.05, 9 populations) or
CVD (Supplemental Figure 6; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84–1.03,
7 populations), and there was no significant heterogeneity.
In sensitivity analyses of the association between high-fat
dairy and CHD, I-squared was reduced from 22.9%
(P = 0.240) to 0% (P = 0.464) with results of RR 1.01,
95% CI 0.96–1.06) after removing the study of Dalmeijer
et al. [27]. Also, sensitivity analyses of the association
between high-fat dairy and CVD showed I-squared reduced
to 0% (P = 0.143) with results of RR 0.98 (95% CI
0.93–1.03) after excluding study Bonthuis et al. [24]. Sub-
group analysis of CVD by age showed a stronger inverse
association between high-fat dairy intake and CVD risk in
the subjects B50 years (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59–0.97, 3
populations), although the sample size was small. There
was no heterogeneity (I2 = 31.5%, P = 0.232).
Low-fat dairy intake (per 200 g/day) was not signifi-
cantly associated with mortality (Supplemental Figure 7;
RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99–1.03, 7 populations), CHD (Sup-
plemental Figure 8; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97–1.03) or CVD
(Supplemental Figure 9; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.01). No
heterogeneity was found in the meta-analysis on low-fat
dairy. In the sub-group analysis for CVD (Supplemental
Table 5) on subjects whose BMI [ 25 kg/m2, low-fat dairy
intake was inversely associated with the risk of CVD (RR
0.97, 95% CI 0.94–1.00, 6 populations).

mental Figure 11; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.06) or CVD
(Supplemental Figure 12; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93–1.10).
Significant heterogeneity was present for all-cause mor-
tality (I2 = 97.4, P \ 0.001), CHD (I2 = 45.5, P = 0.043)
and CVD (I2 = 92.4, P \ 0.001). In sensitivity analyses
for the association between milk and all-cause mortality by
excluding data of Michaelsson et al. [6] for women, I2
reduced to 70.1% (P \ 0.001) with RR 0.99 (95% CI
0.96–1.01). By removing Kondo et al. [28] from the meta-
analysis of CHD, heterogeneity reduced (I2 = 35.10,
P = 0.118) with a RR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.97–1.05). Results
of high-fat milk or low-fat milk were not reported, as only
one study [30] was available for the effect of high-fat milk
or low-fat milk in relation to CHD. Sub-group analyses
showed an inverse association between milk consumption
and mortality (Supplemental Table 3) in the subgroup of
studies with a mean age B50 years (3 populations without
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.479). Also, inverse asso-
ciations were found between milk intake and CVD
(Supplemental Table 5) for the studies which did not adjust
for 7 confounders (age, sex, smoking, alcohol, BMI,
physical activity, food energy intake) (RR 0.94, 95% CI
0.89–0.99; I2 = 28.6, P = 0.210) or for the NOS score\
7
(RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–1.00; I2 = 22.1, P = 0.278).
Total fermented dairy, cheese and yogurt
Total fermented dairy intake (weighted median intake
77 g/day, 19 populations, 11 studies) was non-linearly and
marginally associated with lower mortality risk, with a RR
of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97–0.99) per 20 g/day but with high
heterogeneity (I2 = 94.4%, P \ 0.001; Fig. 2). In sensi-
tivity analysis, by excluding the Swedish study [6] of
women’s results for cheese, I2 was reduced to 45.2%
(P = 0.02), with RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99–1.00). Simi-
larly, total fermented dairy intake (17 populations, 9
studies) was non-linearly and modestly associated with a
2% lower CVD risk per 20 g/day (RR 0.98, 95% CI
0.97–0.99) (Fig. 3). Significant heterogeneity was present

 (I2 = 87.5%, P \ 0.001). Again, in a sensitivity test,
excluding the Swedish study [6] of women’s results for
cheese, showed a marked decrease in heterogeneity to
23.8% (P = 0.19), with a 1% lower CVD risk (RR 0.99,
95% CI 0.99–1.00). Total fermented dairy intake (14
populations, 9 studies) showed no association with CHD
risk, with a RR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1.01) per 20 g/day
increment with no indications of a nonlinear association
(Supplementary Figure 13). The heterogeneity in the CHD
and total fermented dairy data was significant (I2 = 44.6%,
P = 0.037). In sensitivity analyses, after excluding the
study of Patterson et al. [30], the heterogeneity for cheese
was reduced (I2 = 32.5%; P = 0.122), but with results
remaining similar with a RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99–1.01).
Cheese (per 10 g/day) was marginally non-linearly
inversely related to CVD (Fig. 4; RR 0.98, 95% CI
0.95–1.00; 11 populations), but not to risk of mortality
(Supplementary Figure 14; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.01; 13
populations) or CHD (Supplementary Figure 15; RR 0.99,
95% CI 0.97–1.02). Significant heterogeneity was seen for
mortality (I2 = 93.3%, P \ 0.001) or CVD (I2 = 82.6%,
P \ 0.001). In sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity was
reduced after removal of the large Swedish study [6]
(I2 = 11%, P = 0.337 for mortality; I2 = 0%, P = 0.835
for CVD), with no association for mortality and CVD
(RR = 1 for both).
Yogurt (3 populations) was not associated with all-cause
mortality (I2 = 65.8%, P = 0.054, RR 0.97, 95% CI
0.85–1.11), CHD (I2 = 0%, P = 0.685, RR 1.03, 95% CI
0.97–1.09) or CVD (I2 = 0%, P = 0.499, RR 1.03, 95%
CI 0.97–1.09) (Supplementary Figure 16–18).
Discussion
This meta-analysis combining data from 29 prospective
cohort studies showed there were no associations between
total dairy, high- and low-fat dairy, milk and the health
outcomes including all-cause mortality, CHD or CVD. The
modest inverse associations of total fermented dairy were
found with all-cause mortality and CVD, but not CHD. By
examining different types of fermented food in relation to

 CVD, we found marginally inverse association with cheese
but not yogurt. However, further sensitivity tests showed
the inverse associations of fermented dairy and cheese with
all-cause mortality or CVD disappeared after removing the
study of Michaelsson et al. [6].
No associations were found between total dairy and milk
consumption with all-cause mortality, CHD or CVD in the
current study, which is in agreement with several meta-
analyses [47, 48]. Larsson et al. [47] reported neutral
associations of dairy and milk consumption with mortality
or CVD mortality. Mullie et al. [48] reported neutral
associations of milk consumption with all-cause mortality
or CHD. In addition, the current study is in agreement with
a recently published review [49] which indicated neutral
associations between the consumption of total dairy and
risk of CHD or CVD. Results of sub-group analyses
showed the inverse associations were observed between
total dairy intake and CHD, or the association between
milk consumption and CVD when studies did not adjust for
major confounders. Thus, confounders included in statis-
tical analyses in prospective studies have substantial effects
on the final findings and conclusions. Furthermore, inverse
associations were also found in sub-groups of studies
defined by mean age (B50, [
50 years) or BMI (
[
25 kg/
m2) of the associations between total, high-fat, low-fat
dairy and milk with risk of all-cause mortality, CHD or
CVD, which indicated the findings and conclusions were
also affected by characteristics of the study populations
within different studies.
Three US prospective cohort studies described by Chen
et al. [50] showed a substantially lower risk of CVD when
animal fats, including dairy fat, were replaced by unsatu-
rated fats. Recently, UK National Health Service (NHS)
has recommended low-fat milk and dairy products as
healthy choices [51]. However, in the current study, high-
fat and low-fat dairy consumption were investigated sep-
arately and no substitution models replacing high by low-
fat dairy products were carried out. We found no significant
associations between high-and low-fat dairy and all-cause
mortality, CHD or CVD. This supports two previous meta-
analyses [5, 52] which also reported no association of high
or low-fat dairy and CHD. Furthermore, beneficial effects
of high-fat dairy foods on human health were reported by a
cross-sectional study [53], which showed an inverse asso-
ciation of full-fat dairy food and the metabolic syndrome.
In addition, another US study [54], which reviewed cross-

 sectional and prospective cohort studies, showed that 11 of
the 16 studies identified that population with higher full-fat
dairy intake had less adiposity. It is also noteworthy that
butter as a high fat dairy food containing 80% fat [55], a
recent meta-analysis on the effects of butter [10] showed
that whilst consumption was weakly associated with all-
cause
mortality
(per
14 g/day:
RR
1.01,

CI
1.00–1.03), there was no significant association with CHD,
CVD or stroke and there was an inverse association with
incidence of diabetes (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–0.99).
Therefore, the effect of dairy fat on CVD is complex and
may be influenced by the nature of the fat containing food
vehicle, which needs confirmation in further studies.
Despite their fat content and composition, milk and
dairy products are naturally rich in various minerals (e.g.
calcium, potassium), protein and vitamins (e.g. vitamin A
and vitamin B12) [56]. Nutrients including calcium,
potassium and magnesium have been suggested to be
associated with lower risk of stroke [57, 58]. Short-term
human intervention studies [59, 60] also indicated that
subjects who have high-fat diets enriched with dairy min-
erals or calcium have significantly lower total cholesterol
and LDL-cholesterol levels than those on a control diet.
This may explain in part why total dairy consumption has a
neutral role in terms of the effect on health outcomes.
The current study also showed total fermented dairy and
cheese intake to be marginally inversely associated with
mortality and CVD risk, respectively, and large hetero-
geneity was present. However, by removing the study of
Michaelsson et al. [6], heterogeneity of the associations of
total fermented dairy and mortality or CVD, cheese and
mortality or CVD were markedly reduced. Also, the mar-
ginally inversely associations were disappeared. To our
knowledge, the present study is the first dairy meta-analysis
to include the large Swedish cohort results [6]. The
markedly reduced heterogeneity after removing the results
of the Swedish female cohort [6] indicated the heteroge-
neous nature of the Swedish study, which may be related to
the diet and lifestyle characteristics of the study partici-
pants, as they had a relatively low education level (80 and
70% for women and men were educated for B9 years,
respectively), also the highest milk drinkers had highest
percentage of smokers and those living alone.
Cheese consumption based on 11 populations was found
to be modestly and inversely associated with CVD risk,
with a 2% lower risk of CVD per 10 g/day of cheese,
however, the significant association disappeared after
removing the study of Michaelsson et al. [6]. Compared
with other meta-analyses on cheese, Alexander et al. [4]
has reported 11% lower risk of CVD per 35 g/day (95% CI
0.78–1.01), while Chen et al. [61] presented 10% lower
risk of CHD per 50 g/day (95% CI 0.84–0.95). However,
the analysis of the associations between cheese and CVD in
studies of Alexander et al. [4] and Chen et al. [61] were
based on 3 and 8 populations, respectively, which was less
than our current study of 11 populations.
Furthermore, total fermented dairy and cheese were
modestly inversely associated with risk of CVD but not
CHD in the current meta-analysis, so perhaps both dairy
types play a role in reducing the risk of stroke. This is
supported by the evidence of another recent meta-analysis
[9], which found a 9% lower risk of stroke (RR 0.91, 95%
CI 0.82–1.01) associated with higher total fermented dairy
intake and a 3% lower risk of stroke (RR 0.97, 95% CI
0.94–1.01) with higher cheese consumption, although none
of these associations were statistically significant. As there
was limited information of the different sub-types of the
CVD events, the understanding of the association of fer-
mented dairy products with varied CVD types remains
unclear. In addition, unlike the result for cheese, the
association of yogurt with disease outcomes was neutral.
However, a previous review of randomised trials suggested
that yogurt is associated with lower risk of CVD [62]. Our
null results for yogurt intake and CVD may be due to the
limited number of participants from only 3 populations. In
addition, a very recent meta-analysis showed a 14% lower
risk of type 2 diabetes for 80 g/day yogurt intake (RR 0.86,
95% CI 0.83–0.90) based on 11 prospective cohort studies
[63].
The mechanism of the beneficial association of fer-
mented dairy products and reduced CVD risk and mortality
is uncertain. Evidence from randomised controlled trials
suggests that the reason, at least in part, may be an effect of
the food matrix reducing lipid absorption and short chain
fatty acids produced by the bacteria in the large intestine
[64]. Moreover, omics-techniques have suggested that
some of the beneficial effects of cheese can be accounted
for by microbial fermentation producing short chain fatty
acids such as butyrate [65].
Strengths of our study include the use of dose–response
meta-analysis, the inclusion of more studies than in pre-
vious meta-analyses and the consideration of examination
the individual dairy products separately such as dairy
products in terms of fat content (high-fat, low-fat) or pro-
cessing method (fermented or non-fermented). However,
investigation of total dairy or total fermented dairy con-
sumption with disease outcomes by combining dairy foods,
high and low-fat dairy foods, solids and liquids, simply
adding these up is a limitation which should be addressed
in future studies by collecting and analyzing more detailed
data. In addition, limitations of the study include sub-group
analyses that lack statistical power, such as for Asian
studies and effects of gender. We have 9 studies with
scores of 7 or less by using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale
(NOS) [43]. Study quality could explain some hetero-
geneity but not all. For example, NOS scores of all studies
284

 containing high-fat dairy or low-fat dairy were C7, which
could have resulted in lower heterogeneity for those anal-
yses. Furthermore, residual confounding is a limitation of
prospective cohort studies. The background diet should be
taken into account in the statistical analyses as major
confounders, which was done in 15 out of 29 cohort
studies. Comparisons of dairy products with other foods in
replacement models were not possible from the available
data. The neutral risks of dairy products with mortality and
CVD risk could be because of replacement by other foods,
for example, those with high intake of dairy products may
consume less sugar sweetened beverages which could lead
to lower CVD mortality [66] or consume more processed
meat which could lead to higher CVD risks [67, 68]. For
future studies it is important to investigate in more detail
how dairy products can be replaced by other foods.
Conclusions
The current meta-analysis of 29 prospective cohort studies
suggested neutral associations of total, high and low-fat
dairy, milk and yogurt with risk of all-cause mortality,
CHD and CVD. In addition, a possible role of fermented
dairy was found in CVD prevention, but the result was
driven by a single study.
