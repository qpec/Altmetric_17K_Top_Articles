OBJECTIVES: To inform the shared decision-making pro-
cess between clinicians and older adults and their surro-
gates regarding emergency intubation.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Multicenter, emergency department (ED)-based
cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 and older intubated in
the ED from 2008 to 2015 from 262 hospitals across the
United States (>95% of U.S. nonprofit academic medical
centers).
MEASUREMENTS:
Our
primary
outcome
was
age-
specific in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were
age-specific odds of death after adjusting for race, comor-
bid conditions, admission diagnosis, hospital disposition,
and geographic region.
RESULTS: We identified 41,463 ED intubation encoun-
ters and included 35,036 in the final analysis. Sixty-four
percent were in non-Hispanic whites and 54% in women.
Overall in-hospital mortality was 33% (95% confidence
interval
(CI)534–35%).
Twenty-four
percent
(95%
CI524–25%) of subjects were discharged to home, and
41% (95% CI540–42%) were discharged to a location
other than home. Mortality was 29% (95% CI528–29%)
for individuals aged 65 to 74, 34% (95% CI533–35%)
for those aged 75 to 79, 40% (95% CI539–41%) for
those aged 80 to 84, 43% (95% CI541–44%) for those
aged 85 to 89, and 50% (95% CI548–51%) for those
aged 90 and older.
CONCLUSION: After emergency intubation, 33% percent
of older adults die during the index hospitalization. Only
24% of survivors are discharged to home. Simple, graphic
representations of this information, in combination with
an experienced clinician’s overall clinical assessment, will
support shared decision-making regarding unplanned intu-
bation. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:1377–1381, 2018.

or older adults, whether to undergo intubation and
mechanical ventilation is a momentous decision for
which they need expert guidance. Because intubation in
older adults is a high-risk intervention with uncertain or
variable efficacy, shared decision-making may be appropri-
ate.1 Shared decision-making rests upon a foundation of
data on the consequences of available actions. Lack of
data on the prognosis of older adults intubated urgently
limits clinicians’ ability to help them decide what to do at
this critical moment.
Emergency intubation of older adults is becoming
more frequent and is expected to double between 2001
and 2020.2,3 Older adults who are intubated may not sur-
vive, and when surviving, may have very poor quality of
life.4 More than 70% of older adults with serious illness
prioritize quality of life and quality of dying over longev-
ity and consider some health states worse than death,5 yet
56% to 99% of older adults do not have advance direc-
tives available at the time of emergency department (ED)
presentation.6

 In 2016, the Society of Academic Emergency Medi-
cine Consensus Conference released a consensus statement
on the state of shared decision-making in the ED,7 empha-
sizing that improving shared decision-making in palliative
and end-of-life care is paramount to improving emergency
care, but data available to guide shared decision-making
in this setting are limited. Small sample size,8–10 lack of

focus

specific
disease
groups,12,13 and lack of inclusion of individuals who died
in the ED15 have been limited prior studies of prognosis
after emergency intubation. Data specific to older adults
in the ED setting are needed to inform shared decision-
making discussions. We analyzed a large national dataset
to ascertain in-hospital mortality and discharge disposi-
tions for older adults intubated in the ED.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of older adults,
using individuals-level administrative data from Vizient, a
consortium of more than 117 academic medical centers
and more than 300 affiliated hospitals across the United
States representing more than 95% of U.S. nonprofit aca-
demic medical centers.16 Two hundred sixty-two hospitals
contributed data, which included demographic characteris-
tics (age, sex, race, ethnicity); procedure codes; Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis
codes; length of stay; and in-hospital mortality. Participat-
ing institutions submitted all data monthly, and Vizient
reviewed each submission for quality. Partners Healthcare
institutional review board approved the study. We fol-
lowed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology guidelines to ensure clear and
complete reporting of our study design, conduct, and
findings.17
Cohort Selection
We included all encounters with intubations in the ED for
adults aged 65 and older from January 1, 2008, to Decem-
ber 31, 2015, using the same procedure codes used in
prior studies.2,11 We excluded encounters with evidence of
trauma in the admission diagnosis and those with out-of-
hospital intubation or cardiac arrest.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Second-
ary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit length
of stay, hospital disposition, and predictors of in-hospital
mortality.
Predictors of Interest
Based on prior research, we determined a priori that
age,18
sex,
race,19
comorbidity
present
on
admission
(quantified according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI)),15 origin (home, nursing home, hospice, another
hospital),20 admission diagnosis,13,21 and insurance status
were potential predictors of mortality.
Statistical Analysis
In-hospital mortality was our primary outcome. We ana-
lyzed the bivariate association between each candidate pre-
dictor
and
this
outcome
using
chi-square
analysis.
Variables
significantly
associated
with
our
outcome
(p<.05) were included in the multivariable logistic regres-
sion model: age, race, comorbidity present on admission,
origin, admission diagnosis, and geographic region. We
categorized admission diagnosis according to a diagnostic
grouping approach described previously.22 We used the 7
most frequent diagnostic categories: sepsis (038*, 995.9*,
785.52), gastrointestinal bleeding (578*), congestive heart
failure (428*), pneumonia (507*, 481*, 482*, 483*,
485*,
486*),
respiratory
failure
(518*,
786*,
491*),
altered mental status or seizure (780*), and cerebrovascu-
lar accident (430*, 431*, 432*, 433*, 434*, 436*, 437*).
We excluded variables that were collinear, defined as
variables with the Variance Inflation Factor of greater
than 10, in our multivariable model. We tested goodness
of fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. We excluded
observations with missing variables in the multivariable
model but performed a sensitivity analysis in which we
included those observations. Stata version 14.1 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX) was used to perform all
analyses.
RESULTS
Of 41,463 adults who were intubated in the ED (54%
female, 64% non-Hispanic white), 6,427 were excluded
because of missing variables, leaving 35,036 for the final
analysis (Figure 1). The CCI was 3 or greater for 51%.
Seventy-five percent came to the ED from home, of whom
27% were discharged to home after the index hospitaliza-
tion. Twenty-four percent of our cohort were discharged
to home. Overall in-hospital mortality was 33%, ranging
from 29% (95% confidence interval (CI)528–29%) in
those aged 65 to 74 to 50% (95% CI548–51%) in those
aged 90 and older. Sixty-three percent of survivors were
discharged to locations other than home. Median length
of stay was 9 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5–15) for
survivors, and median time to death was 3 days (IQR
1–8) for decedents. Eighty-four percent of decedents died

 within 10 days of intubation. Figure 2 is a graphical repre-
sentation of these data, which will be useful for shared
decision-making discussions.
In our multivariable model, no variables were collin-
ear (mean Variance Inflation Factor51.01), and model fit-
ness was appropriate (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p5.22).
The odds of death were 2.6 times as high for those aged
90 and older as for those aged 65 to 74, controlling for
race, admission source, comorbid conditions, admission
diagnosis, and geographical region (95% CI52.4–2.9).
The odds of dying in the hospital were 70% higher when
arriving from another hospital than when arriving from
home (95% CI51.5–1.9). The odds of death were 1.5
times as high (95% CI51.4–1.6) for those with a CCI
greater than 4 as for those with a CCI of 0, controlling
for previously mentioned confounders. Admission diagno-
ses of cerebrovascular accident (OR52.4, 95% CI52.2–
2.6) and sepsis (OR51.5, 95% CI51.4–1.6) were associ-
ated with greater in-hospital mortality than all other
admission diagnoses. Black subjects had 20% lower odds
of dying in-hospital than white subjects. People from the
Midwest had 10% lower odds of dying than those from
the Mid-Atlantic. Admission diagnoses of congestive heart
failure (OR50.5, 95% CI50.4–0.7), respiratory failure
(OR50.5, 95% CI50.5–0.6), and altered mental status or
seizure (OR50.7, 95% CI50.7–0.8) were associated with
lower odds of dying in the hospital (Table 1.)
Observations missing key variables were excluded from
the multivariable analysis: in-hospital mortality (n58), geo-
graphical region (n593), and admission diagnosis category
(n56,334). Our sensitivity analysis including the missing
variables did not change the distribution of independent var-
iables, and p-values and odds ratios did not change in the
multivariable analysis, indicating that the missing variables
were missing at random and did not influence our analysis.
DISCUSSION
Shared decision-making between clinicians and patients or
surrogates
depends
upon
availability
of
information
regarding predicted outcomes. This study demonstrates
that 33% of older adults intubated in the ED die in the
hospital, with mortality increasing markedly with age,
reaching 50% in those aged 90 and older.
Prior studies of postintubation mortality have not
focused specifically on older adults,11 analyzed people
with specific diagnosis (e.g., acute respiratory distress syn-
drome),13 and used older data.15 Our study investigated
mortality for older adults with various diagnoses who
were intubated using a large, recent, nationally representa-
tive dataset (2008–15). Our results are confirmatory of
findings demonstrated in several previous studies, showing
that high in-hospital mortality is common in older adults
requiring intubation (20–60%).13 We focused on how to
communicate this baseline risk of mortality to older adults
graphically to facilitate shared decision-making.
One-quarter of subjects survived hospitalization and
were discharged home. More than half of survivors were dis-
charged to a location other than home. The proportions of
survivors discharged to locations other than home ranged
from 35% to 43% across age groups. A prior study showed
that as many as 13% of survivors would require prolonged
mechanical ventilation.23 Of older adults requiring prolonged
mechanical ventilation, 35% will never meet the criteria for
weaning from the ventilator and have 65% probability of
dying in a long-term care facility, with median survival rang-
ing from 2.1 to 4.4 months.14 Even if successfully weaned
from the ventilator, 40% will have a severe functional disabil-
ity after hospital discharge unless their baseline functional sta-
tus was completely normal.24 Seventy-four percent of older
adults would not choose treatment if anticipated survival
included severe functional impairment, and many would

 consider a state of serious functional debility worse than
death.25 Our graphical representation of baseline mortality
data combined with clinical information synthesized by an
experienced clinician may improve shared decision-making.
Limitations
Use of administrative data is subject to inaccuracy in the cod-
ing of diagnoses and procedures. We used the same method as
prior similar studies to identify our cohort,15 yet there may
have been nondifferential misclassification if intubations were
not coded accurately in the medical records. Our dataset pro-
vided information only on discharge location; important post-
hospitalization
outcomes,
including
functional
status,
mortality, and readmission, are unknown. No information
was available for individuals in whom intubation was consid-
ered but not performed. Several additional clinical parame-
ters, such as pre-ED frailty, acute illness severity, precise
admission diagnoses, and ED-based treatment variables, can
be strong predictors of mortality after critical illness; the lack
of such information in our database was a limitation. It is
likely that future studies with these clinical parameters would
improve the predictability of our study but would not have its
generalizability. Furthermore, we developed our tool to pro-
vide a simple, graphical representation of the baseline risk of
mortality. Using our tool, experienced clinicians can incorpo-
rate acute clinical parameters into their overall clinical assess-
ments during shared decision-making conversations. Our data
had a significant number of observations with missing admis-
sion diagnoses (n56,334), but our sensitivity analysis did not
reveal any bias attributable to missingness.
CONCLUSION
Clinicians in the fields of primary care, oncology, pallia-
tive care, and emergency medicine may find themselves

 discussing goals of care with patients and their caregivers;
whether to undergo intubation should it become indicated
is an important consideration. During shared decision-
making, individuals aged 65 and older and their surrogates
can be informed that, after intubation, the overall chance
of survival and discharge to home after the index hospital-
ization is 24%. There is a 33% chance of in-hospital
death and a 67% chance of survival to hospital discharge.
The chance of in-hospital death is especially high in indi-
viduals aged 90 and older and in those with an admission
diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident. Sixty-seven percent
of survivors will be discharged to a location other than
home. Data presented graphically, combined with experi-
enced
clinicians’
overall
clinical
assessment,
will
be
informative during shared decision-making.
