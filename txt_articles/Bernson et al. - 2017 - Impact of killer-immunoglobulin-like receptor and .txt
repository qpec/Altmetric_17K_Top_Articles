Interactions between killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I ligands are instrumental in natural killer (NK)
cell regulation and protect normal tissue from NK cell attack. Human KIR haplotypes comprise genes encoding mainly inhibitory
receptors (KIR A) or activating and inhibitory receptors (KIR B). A substantial fraction of humans lack ligands for inhibitory KIRs
(iKIRs), that is, a ‘missing ligand’ genotype. KIR B/x and missing ligand genotypes may thus give rise to potentially autoreactive,
unlicensed NK cells. Little is known regarding the impact of such genotypes in untransplanted acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For
this study, NK cell phenotypes and KIR/HLA genotypes were determined in 81 AML patients who received immunotherapy with
histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose IL-2 for relapse prevention (NCT01347996). We observed that presence of unlicensed NK
cells impacted favorably on clinical outcome, in particular among patients harboring functional NK cells reflected by high
expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp46. Genotype analyses suggested that the clinical benefit of high NCR
expression was restricted to patients with a missing ligand genotype and/or a KIR B/x genotype. These data imply that functional
NK cells are significant anti-leukemic effector cells in patients with KIR/HLA genotypes that favor NK cell autoreactivity.

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically and morphologi-
cally heterogeneous disease characterized by the expansion and
accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and
peripheral blood. The prognosis is determined by risk factors such
as chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations and age, and
based on these and other factors AML can be classified into high-,
intermediate- or low-risk disease. Depending on the risk category,
between 65 to as low as 5% of patients experience long-term
survival.1 Despite achieving complete remission (CR) in response
to chemotherapy, alone or combined with autologous stem cell
transplantation, the vast majority of intermediate and high-risk
AML patients are not cured as a small residual clone of leukemic
cells may expand to cause relapse with poor prospects of long-
term survival.2 To prevent relapse, younger patients may receive
an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), but not all patients
are eligible for transplantation and additional strategies to avoid
relapse in non-transplanted patients are highly warranted.3
Numerous studies of allo-transplanted and non-transplanted
patients have highlighted the importance of cellular immunity,
including aspects of natural killer (NK) cell function, for the
outcome of AML.4–6 In order to identify aberrant cells, NK cells rely
on the surface expression of a set of activating receptors such as
natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), including NKp46 and NKp30.
The activating signals conveyed by these receptors can be
prevented by inhibitory NK cell receptors, mainly inhibitory KIRs
(iKIRs) and CD94-NKG2A that target class I HLA antigens.7,8 The KIR
ligands are divided into three major groups based on the amino
acid in positions 77 and 80 in the KIR-binding domain. Thus, HLA-C
alleles belong either to the C1 group (recognized by KIR2DL2 or
KIR2DL3) or the C2 group (recognized by KIR2DL1), while HLA-B or
HLA-A alleles may contain a Bw4 motif that is recognized by
KIR3DL1.9 The KIRs are encoded by genes in the
highly
polymorphic KIR locus. There are two main KIR haplotypes; the
A haplotype that comprises genes for iKIRs and KIR2DS4, and the B
haplotype that in addition to iKIR genes also carries genes for a
variable set of up to 6 activating KIRs (aKIRs).10–12 The ligands for
aKIRs are not completely characterized, but KIR2DS1 recognizes
HLA-C2, and KIR2DS2 recognizes HLA-A11 and HLA-C1.13–17
Under
normal
conditions,
the
functional
competence
of
individual NK cells is set by their steady-state input of inhibitory
and
activating
signals
in
a
process
known
as
NK
cell
education.18–20 As KIR genes and HLA genes are located on
different chromosomes, they are inherited independently and
many individuals thus have a genotypic discordance between HLA
alleles and KIR genes with a lack of inhibitory ligands (‘missing
ligand genotype’).9,21 As KIR expression is stochastic in NK cells, a
missing ligand genotype entails substantial numbers of NK cells
that only express inhibitory receptors for non-self HLA (hereafter
referred to as NS-iKIR NK cells).18 These potentially autoreactive
NS-iKIR NK cells, or unlicensed NK cells, do not receive inhibitory
input and will remain hyporesponsive to target cells under steady-
state conditions.19,20 Conversely, NK cells that engage in interac-
tions between activating KIRs (S-aKIRs) and corresponding HLA
ligands will constantly receive activating signals and become
disarmed/hyporesponsive to avoid autoreactivity.14,22

 Recent studies suggest that perturbations of the immune
homeostasis, such as autologous transplantation, treatment with
monoclonal antibodies and viral infections, may activate other-
wise hyporesponsive NK cells to contribute to eradication of
aberrant cells.21,23–26 In addition, in vitro studies imply that
proinflammatory cytokine stimulation may render unlicensed NK
cells responsive.27,28 In a phase III trial, relapse-preventive
immunotherapy combining low-dose IL-2 and histamine dihy-
drochloride
(HDC/IL-2)
was
shown
to
significantly
improve
leukemia-free survival (LFS) for AML patients.29 The rationale for
this immunotherapy is to enhance the cytotoxic function of the
lymphocytic population using the synergistic effect of IL-2
stimulation along with histamine dihydrochloride, which targets
the secretion of immunosuppressive reactive oxygen species
(ROS) from myeloid cells.3,30,31 In a recent phase IV trial in AML,
where patients were given HDC/IL-2, this strategy was found to
strongly upregulate the expression of NCRs on NK cells and induce
NK cell expansion, and a high expression of NKp46 was associated
with significantly superior LFS and overall survival (OS).32,33
For the present study, we aimed to clarify whether KIR/HLA
genotypes impact on relapse risk of AML patients receiving HDC/
IL-2. Our results suggest that HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy may
induce break of tolerance in patients, and that the reported
benefit from intact NCR expression is restricted to patients with
either a KIR B/x genotype or a missing inhibitory ligand genotype.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
The single-armed multicenter phase IV study (Re:Mission, NCT01347996)
enrolled 84 patients (age 18–79) with AML in first CR who received ten 21-
day cycles of HDC/IL-2 for 18 months or until relapse/death. Sample size
was chosen in collaboration with regulatory authorities to meet the
primary endpoints, which included the assessment of the pharmacody-
namic effects of HDC/IL-2 by monitoring T and NK cell phenotypes before
and after treatment cycles. Results from the trial have been published
previously.32–35 The herein reported aspects of NK cell biology vs clinical
outcome (LFS) were not specified in the protocol and were performed post
hoc. A detailed account for patient characteristics, such as age, mutation
status and European Leukemia Net risk class,36 is found in previous study
reports.32,33 The study of pharmacodynamic effects on different effector
NK cell subsets in the clinical trial were approved by the Ethics Committees
of each participating institution, and all patients gave written informed
consent before enrollment. Untreated patients, newly diagnosed with
AML, at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital were asked to donate blood
for a phenotypic and functional characterization of normal and malignant
leukocytes. All patients gave written informed consent to participation in
the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients were
isolated and cryopreserved.
Sampling of peripheral blood and flow cytometry of Re:Mission
study samples
Peripheral blood was collected before and after the first and third
treatment cycles, referred to as C1D1 (Cycle1, Day1), C1D21, C3D1 and
C3D21). Patients relapsing and failure of samples to meet viability criteria
resulted in varying numbers of observations at different time points (NCR
panel n = 62, 62 and 53; KIR panel n = 60, 64 and 49 for C1D1, C1D21 and
C3D1, respectively). Forty-four paired observations (C1D1–C1D21) were
available for the CD8 T-cell panel. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
isolated and cryopreserved at local sites and shipped to the central
laboratory at University of Gothenburg for analysis by flow cytometry.
Samples with o25% viability were excluded. Differential counts of whole
blood were utilized to calculate absolute counts of blood NK cell
phenotypes. A full list of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies is found in
the Supplementary Material. High and low NKp46 expression was defined
as above or below median NKp46 expression, as measured by the median
fluorescence intensity of NKp46 on CD16+ NK cells.32 Amongst CD8+
T cells, effector memory T cells (TEM) were defined as CD45RO+CCR7− cells,
and effector T cells (Teff) were defined as CD45RA+CCR7− cells.34
DNA extraction and KIR/HLA genotyping
DNA was extracted from whole blood using a Roche MagNAPure 96
(Pleasanton, CA, USA) instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. KIR typing was performed using the One Lambda KIR SSO
Genotyping Test. When the analysis generated conflicting results for
certain KIR alleles, the Olerup SSP KIR genotyping kit was used to
determine the KIR genotype. KIR ligands were determined using the
Olerup SSP KIR HLA Ligand kit.
Patients were dichotomized based on the concordance/discordance
between their KIR and HLA genotypes. Patients lacking an HLA ligand for
one self-expressed inhibitory KIR (2DL1—HLA-C2; DL2/3—HLA-C1; 3DL1—
HLA Bw4) were considered to have a ‘missing ligand’ genotype.
IL-2 stimulation of PBMC and degranulation assay
Healthy donor PBMCs were thawed and stimulated overnight in 500 U/ml
IL-2 (Proleukin, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Surrey, UK). AML samples were
thawed, stained for CD34+, and the CD34+ blasts were sorted on a 3-laser
FACSARIA III flow cytometer (405, 488 and 640 nm; BD Biosciences, San
Diego, CA, USA). K562 cells or sorted CD34+ AML cells were added to the
cultured PBMCs at a ratio 4:1 (PBMC:target cells) and incubated for 4 h in
presence of CD107a antibody. After incubation, cells were washed and
stained with antibodies directed against CD3, CD56, CD107a, NKG2A,
KIR2DL1/S1, KIR2DL2/L3 and KIR3DL1 followed by analysis using a BD LSR
Fortessa SORP instrument.
Statistical analyses
In accordance with the statistical plan, paired two-sided t-tests were used for
single comparisons of NK cell phenotypes. For multiple comparisons within a
dataset, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test,
were used. The analyses of NK or T-cell phenotype vs outcome are based on
the data for LFS as described previously.32 The impact on LFS was analyzed
using the log-rank test. To optimize cutoff points for high and low
frequencies of NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells, receiver-operating characteristics
(ROC) curves and Youden index were used,37 determining a cutoff value
optimal for the specific analysis instead of using a median value. The area
under
the
receiver-operating characteristic
curve (AUROC)
and 95%
confidence interval (CI) are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Parameters
that significantly predicted LFS using the log-rank test were further analyzed
by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Covariates, including
age, risk group classification, number of induction courses required to
achieve CR (1 or 41) and number of consolidation courses (0–2 or 42) were
tested in univariable analyses. Covariates with P-values below 0.1 in
univariable analyses (age and number of induction courses) were included
in the multivariable analysis (Table 1).

 RESULTS
Impact of KIR/HLA genotypes on clinical outcome
To assess the potential impact of KIR/HLA genotypes on relapse
risk in patients receiving HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy, we deter-
mined the HLA and KIR genotypes in 81 AML patients in the Re:
Mission trial. Thirty-one patients (38%) had a perfect match
between HLA molecules and KIRs (all ligands present) and 50
patients (62%) lacked an HLA class I molecule with the cognate KIR
present (missing ligand; Figure 1a). The KIR genotypes of patients
were divided into A/A or B/x based on the absence or presence of
haplotype B-specific genes.10,12,38 Twenty-five and 56 patients
were found to be KIR A/A and KIR B/x, respectively (Figure 1b). The
distribution of KIR A/A and B/x genotypes was similar between the
group of patients with all ligands present and those missing one
or more ligands (Figure 1c). Neither a KIR B/x genotype nor a
missing ligand genotype per se had a significant impact on clinical
outcome in terms of LFS (Figures 1d and e).
NK cell NCR expression is clinically relevant only in patients lacking
inhibitory KIR ligands or in patients with a KIR B/x genotype
Previous reports from the Re:Mission trial have shown that HDC/
IL-2 immunotherapy significantly activates the NK cell compart-
ment. NK cell killing of AML blasts in vitro is to a large extent
dependent on intact expression of NKp46 and other NCRs.6 We
and others have shown that expression levels of NCRs impact on
relapse risk, suggesting NK cell function to be relevant to clinical
outcome in AML.5,32,33 We thus sought to clarify whether the
benefit of NCR expression was influenced by KIR and HLA
genotypes. As shown in Figure 2, the clinical benefit of high
NKp46 expression was only observed in patients with a missing
ligand genotype and not in patients with all ligands present
(Figures 2b and c; Table 1). The selective benefit of high NKp46
expression for patients lacking a ligand was consistently observed
during therapy, that is, before treatment start (P = 0.06 vs 0.62), at
the end of the first treatment cycle (P = 0.0002 vs 0.33), and before
start of the third cycle (P = 0.06 vs 0.41; Figure 2; Supplementary
Figure 2). No differences were found regarding NCR upregulation
or magnitude of NK cell expansion in blood during the first 3-week
cycle of immunotherapy when comparing patients with all ligands
with
those
with
a
missing
ligand
genotype
(Figure
2;
Supplementary Figure 1). In accordance with the selective benefit
of NKp46 in patients with a missing ligand genotype, the benefit
for older patients with above-median expression of NKp30 before
treatment start33 was predominantly observed in patients lacking
an inhibitory KIR ligand (Supplementary Figure 3). These results
imply that a missing ligand genotype is needed to benefit from
high NCR expression, suggesting that potentially autoreactive NS-
iKIR NK cells act as effector cells in AML immunotherapy.
A KIR B/x genotype may also generate NK cell subsets that are
more prone to autoreactivity. In analogy with the findings for the
missing ligand genotype, the benefit of above median expression
of NKp46 or NKp30 was only observed in patients with a KIR B/x
genotype (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.003, respectively), while KIR A/A
genotype patients did not benefit from high NCR expression
(NKp46, P = 0.31; Figures 3b and c, Table 1; NKp30, P = 0.18). No
differences regarding NCR upregulation or NK cell expansion were
observed between patients with KIR A/A or B/x genotypes
(Figure 3; Supplementary Figure 1).
KIR/HLA genotypes prognosticate outcome independently of
CD8+ T-cell dynamics
A recent report found that a substantial proportion of non-
relapsing patients displayed a transition from CD8+ T effector
memory cells (TEM) to effector cells (Teff) during the first 3-week-
cycle of HDC/IL-2 therapy, as reflected by an increase in the
frequency of Teff cells along with a decrease in TEM cells.34 We
therefore determined whether the occurrence of such a CD8+
T-cell transition from TEM to Teff cells was affected by the KIR/HLA
genotypes. A treatment-induced CD8+ T-cell transition was equally
common in patients with all ligands present as compared to
patients lacking a ligand, or in patients with a KIR A/A or B/x

 genotype (P = 1 and 0.74; Fisher’s exact test). In contrast to NCR
expression, CD8+ T-cell transition was associated with superior
survival in patients with all ligands present and in patients lacking
an inhibitory ligand (Figures 2d and e; Table 1) as well as in both
KIR A/A and KIR B/x patients (Supplementary Figure 1).
Impact of specific KIR B genes on outcome
The size of this trial prevented a thorough analysis of the
individual contributions of specific activating KIR genes and their
HLA ligands to the survival benefit of the KIR B/x genotype.
However, among patients with above median expression of
NKp46, positivity for either KIR2DS1 or KIR3DS1 was associated
with improved LFS (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively; Supplementary
Figure 4), while KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS3 did not impact on LFS. Since
the benefit of high NKp46 expression was restricted to KIR B/x and
missing ligand genotypes, we next investigated the impact of
having neither, one or both of these genotypes. No clear additive
effect of having both KIR B/x and a missing ligand genotype was
observed; however, the poor survival of KIR A/A patients with all
inhibitory ligands present was evident (Supplementary Figure 4).
Presence of NCR+ unlicensed NK cells in blood heralds favorable
outcome
Analyses of KIR/HLA genes do not provide information about the
actual presence of unlicensed NK cell subsets in blood. We
therefore performed KIR and CD94-NKG2A phenotyping of NK
cells from patients in the Re:Mission trial. On the basis of the
individual KIR/HLA genotype, the frequency and absolute counts
of NK cell subsets expressing only inhibitory KIRs for non-self HLA
(NS-iKIR) were determined and monitored during treatment. The
frequency of NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells varied considerably
between individuals, ranging from 0.04 to 31% of all NK cells.
The absolute counts of NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells in blood followed
the same pattern as previously reported for the overall population
of NK cells32 with a strong induction of preferentially immature NK
cells during a treatment cycle (Figure 4a), followed by a
contraction/differentiation
phase
between
treatment
cycles.
Notably, in accordance with previous results for CD56dim NK
cells,32 the number of unlicensed NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells was
significantly higher before the third treatment cycle as compared
to treatment start (Figure 4b) implying that the immunotherapy
may yield a sustained induction of unlicensed NK cells in blood.
Next, we determined whether high frequencies of unlicensed,
NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells impacted on clinical outcome. Patients
were dichotomized to high- and low-frequency groups based on
an optimal cutoff calculated using ROC curves and Youden index
(cutoff 0.16 and 0.41 for C1D1 and C3D1, respectively; AUROC and
CI reported in Supplementary Table 1).37,39 As shown in Figures 4c
and d, a high frequency of NKG2A− NS-KIR NK cells before
treatment start and before the third treatment cycle were
associated with improved LFS (P = 0.06 and 0.05, respectively;
Table 1).
In analogy with the results achieved by comparing the outcome
of patients with a missing ligand genotype or with all ligands
present, the clinical benefit of high NKp46 expression was
predominantly observed in patients with high frequencies of
NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells (Figures 4e and f). Notably, when
segregating the patients with a missing ligand genotype into four

additive clinical benefit of NKp46 expression and frequency of
unlicensed NK cells (Figure 4g; P = 0.0001).
IL-2-activated NS-iKIR NK cells are reactive with primary AML blasts
The results above collectively point towards a role for unlicensed,
NS-iKIR NK cells during HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy and imply that
the immunotherapy may relieve the steady-state hyporesponsive-
ness of this NK cell subset. Previous studies have suggested that
in vitro stimulation with inflammatory cytokines may induce
responsiveness in unlicensed NK cells towards HLA-deficient
target cells,18,28 but few studies have compared degranulation
responses of licensed vs unlicensed NK cells to primary HLA-
matched leukemic cells. In a first series of experiments, we
stimulated HLA-typed PBMCs from healthy donors with IL-2 and
determined
the
degranulation
responses
of
unlicensed
or
licensed, single KIR+ NKG2A− NK cells when exposed to target
cells (gating strategy in Supplementary Figure 5). In line with
previous reports,18,25 unstimulated NKG2A− NS-iKIR+ NK cells
responded poorly to K562 cells, while the addition of IL-2 largely
abolished the difference in response to HLA-deficient target cells
between NK cells expressing only NS-iKIR and NK cells expressing
a single KIR specific for self-HLA (Figure 5c). As shown in Figures 5a
and b, primary AML blasts generally show robust expression of
HLA class I, and the relevance of HLA-deficient target cells, such as
K562, to determine the anti-leukemic potential of NK cells may
thus be limited. We, therefore, isolated primary CD34+ leukemic
blasts from newly diagnosed AML patients who were homozygous
for C1, and matched them with C1/C1 healthy donor NK cells in a
degranulation assay. As shown in Figure 5d, while unstimulated
NK cells responded poorly towards AML blasts, IL-2 stimulation
significantly enhanced the response of NKG2A− NS-iKIR (P = 0.001).
Notably, stimulation with IL-2 abolished the superior reactivity of
licensed S-iKIR NK cells towards AML blasts, thus underscoring that
unlicensed NS-iKIR NK cells may constitute an important anti-
leukemic effector cell population.
DISCUSSION
The frequent occurrence of a genetic discordance between the set
of KIR genes and the corresponding HLA genes in humans gives
rise to a substantial portion of circulating NK cells that either
cannot be inhibited by host HLA molecules or constantly are fed
with activating signals through activating KIRs.14,20,40 Thus, to
avoid attack against healthy cells, the effector function of
individual NK cells is continuously adjusted, or tuned, by the
input of inhibitory and activating signals from receptors binding
ligands on adjacent cells.41 Unlicensed NK cells, which do not
express inhibitory receptors for self-HLA, do not receive any
inhibitory signals at steady-state and are thus hyporesponsive and
display little cytotoxicity against HLA-deficient target cells.18,19,42
In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the relapse risk of
AML patients receiving HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy was affected by
their KIR/HLA genotypes. There was no general clinical benefit for
patients with a missing ligand genotype or a KIR B/x genotype.
However, it seems reasonable to assume that the NK cell
population needs to be functionally intact in order to benefit
from unlicensed NK cells. Previous reports from the Re:Mission trial
and other studies have identified a population of patients with
intact NCR expression with superior prognosis over patients with
NCR expression deficiency.5,32,33,43 A main finding in the present
report was that the clinical benefit of NCR expression was
strikingly restricted to patients with either a missing ligand
genotype or a KIR B/x genotype. This finding suggests that HDC/
IL-2 immunotherapy activates a pool of otherwise hyporesponsive,
unlicensed NK cells to exert anti-leukemic activity. However, as a
genetic lack of a ligand does not directly translate into a large pool
of unlicensed NK cells, we used multi-color flow cytometry to
monitor the presence of unlicensed NK cells during immunother-
apy. In line with the observations above, we found that high
frequencies
of
unlicensed,
NKG2A−
NS-iKIR
NK
cells
were
associated with improved LFS. Further analyses revealed that
high NKp46 expression and a high frequency of unlicensed
NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells additively improved outcome. Thus,
patients with high NCR expression along with a high frequency of
unlicensed NKG2A− NS-iKIR NK cells displayed superior LFS. These
findings
suggest
that
functional,
unlicensed
NK
cells
may
constitute an anti-leukemic effector population of relevance to
the clinical outcome of HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy in AML. This
hypothesis was further supported by in vitro experiments showing

Impact of KIR and HLA in AML immunotherapy

 that stimulation with IL-2 triggered degranulation of unlicensed
NK cells against primary AML blasts.
Naive CD8+ T cells differentiate via central memory and TEM
subsets to Teff cells.44 We have previously reported a striking
clinical benefit for patients displaying a transition from CD8+ TEM
cells to Teff cells during the first cycle of immunotherapy.34
Multivariable analyses suggested that CD8+ TEM to Teff cell
transition and high NKp46 expression independently predicted
outcome (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast to the results
observed for NKp46, the clinical impact of CD8+ T-cell transition
was noted irrespective of KIR/HLA genotype, supporting that
cytotoxic T cells and NK cells constitute independent effector arms
that are active during immunotherapy.
The relevance of a mismatch between KIRs on NK cells and the
HLA molecules present on leukemic cells for clinical outcome was
first demonstrated in haploidentical allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation (allo-SCT), where a donor-to-recipient KIR/HLA mis-
match was associated with a significant survival benefit.45 This
finding suggests a pivotal role for alloreactive NK cells, that is,
allogeneic NK cells that are licensed with respect to the donor’s
set of HLA molecules but not inhibited by the recipient’s set of
HLA. There is controversy regarding how long these alloreactive
cells remain active: some studies support that alloreactivity will be
lost as the cells adapt to the new HLA environment, while other
studies imply that donor-derived hematopoietic cells may be
sufficient to preserve alloreactivity, at least towards malignant
cells.46 Moreover, even though there is no univocal conclusion
concerning the role of aKIRs in leukemia, it was reported that
patients receiving grafts from KIR2DS1+ HLA-C1/x donors had
lower probability of relapse in allo-SCT of AML.24,47 Our results
demonstrate
that
the
presence
of
unlicensed,
‘KIR/HLA
mismatched’ NK cells, or the presence of aKIRs, can be clinically
relevant also in non-transplanted AML patients undergoing
immunotherapy. In a few other malignancies, where unlicensed
NK cells have been suggested to be beneficial, immune home-
ostasis
was
disturbed
by
some
intervention,
for
example,
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, cytokines or autologous
transplantation.21,24,25,48 Collectively, these studies indicate that
the clinical benefit of a missing ligand genotype is related to the
capacity of the therapeutic intervention to activate the unlicensed
NK cell population and thereby break their tolerance to self. As
these cells are more prone to mount an autoreactive response,
either due to lack of inhibitory ligands or to presence of activating
KIRs that are triggered by self-HLA class I, they may function as
even more effective killers than licensed NK cells.26,48,49 We
hypothesize that the current combination treatment, with IL-2
activating the NK cell subset and HDC targeting ROS secretion and
thereby protecting the NK cells, results in an activation of
otherwise hyporesponsive NK cells. The treatment is given to
patients in post-consolidation phase when the leukemic burden is
small. Still, it remains to be investigated if immunotherapy
predominantly enables an immediate eradication of the remaining
leukemic cells or if it leads to a long-lasting immune-mediated
control of the malignant clone.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the impact of NK
cells, and the predictive value of NK cell markers, during HDC/IL-2
immunotherapy
is
largely
restricted
to
individuals
with
a
missing ligand genotype and/or a KIR B/x genotype. Our results
support that unlicensed, functional NK cells are relevant to
prognosis in AML and that strategies to unleash the cytotoxicity of
unlicensed NK cells should be considered in anti-leukemic
immunotherapy.
