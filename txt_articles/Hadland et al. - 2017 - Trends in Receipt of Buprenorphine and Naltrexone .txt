IMPORTANCE Opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently begins in adolescence and young
adulthood. Intervening early with pharmacotherapy is recommended by major professional
organizations. No prior national studies have examined the extent to which adolescents and
young adults (collectively termed youth) with OUD receive pharmacotherapy.
OBJECTIVE To identify time trends and disparities in receipt of buprenorphine and naltrexone
among youth with OUD in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using
deidentified data from a national commercial insurance database. Enrollment and complete
health insurance claims of 9.7 million youth, aged 13 to 25 years were analyzed, identifying
individuals who received a diagnosis of OUD between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2014,
with final follow-up date December 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from April 25 to
December 31, 2016. Time trends were identified and multivariable logistic regression was
used to determine sociodemographic factors associated with medication receipt.
EXPOSURES Sex, age, race/ethnicity, neighborhood education and poverty levels, geographic
region, census region, and year of diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dispensing of a medication (buprenorphine or naltrexone)
within 6 months of first receiving an OUD diagnosis.
RESULTS Among 20 822 youth diagnosed with OUD (0.2% of the 9.7 million sample), 13 698
(65.8%) were male and 17 119 (82.2%) were non-Hispanic white. Mean (SD) age was 21.0
(2.5) years at the first observed diagnosis. The diagnosis rate of OUD increased nearly 6-fold
from 2001 to 2014 (from 0.26 per 100 000 person-years to 1.51 per 100 000 person-years).
Overall, 5580 (26.8%) youth were dispensed a medication within 6 months of diagnosis, with
4976 (89.2%) of medication-treated youth receiving buprenorphine and 604 (10.8%)
receiving naltrexone. Medication receipt increased more than 10-fold, from 3.0% in 2002
(when buprenorphine was introduced) to 31.8% in 2009, but declined in subsequent years
(27.5% in 2014). In multivariable analyses, younger individuals were less likely to receive
medications, with adjusted probability for age 13 to 15 years, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.3%); 16 to
17 years, 9.7% (95% CI, 8.4%-11.1%); 18 to 20 years, 22.0% (95% CI, 21.0%-23.0%); and 21 to
25 years, 30.5% (95% CI, 30.0%-31.5%) (P < .001 for difference). Females (7124 [20.3%])
were less likely than males (13 698 [24.4%]) to receive medications (P < .001), as were
non-Hispanic black (105 [14.8%]) and Hispanic (1165 [20.0%]) youth compared with
non-Hispanic white (17 119 [23.1%]) youth (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this first national study of buprenorphine and naltrexone
receipt among youth, dispensing increased over time. Nonetheless, only 1 in 4 commercially
insured youth with OUD received pharmacotherapy, and disparities based on sex, age, and
race/ethnicity were observed.

ined what percentage of youth with OUD receive pharmaco-
therapy.Understandingwhichyouthreceivemedications,which

Sample Selection
The primary analytic sample included all youth aged 13 to 25
yearswhoreceivedadiagnosisofOUDbetweenJanuary1,2001,
and June 30, 2014, with 6 months or more of continuous en-
rollment following the date of diagnosis (allowing a final date
of follow-up of December 31, 2014). We included young adults
up to age 25 years, since they often still receive care from pe-

Variables of Interest
Our primary outcome of interest was receipt of buprenor-
phine (formulated as buprenorphine or buprenorphine-
naloxone combination) or naltrexone (in its oral short-acting
or intramuscular extended-release formulation) within 6
months of the first observed OUD diagnosis. Although clini-
cal practice guidelines recommend considering pharmaco-
therapy as soon as possible after OUD diagnosis,23,25 we ex-
amined a 6-month timeframe to allow for any delay in linking
youth to treatment services. We identified pharmacy claims
that included a National Drug Code for buprenorphine (ex-
cluding the transdermal buprenorphine patch marketed
exclusively for pain control) or naltrexone (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Since intramuscular extended-release naltrex-
one is often administered in health care settings (rather than
being prescribed), an individual was also considered to have
received naltrexone if a claim contained Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System code J2315 (naltrexone, depot form).

 Each individual was labeled with a unique identifier and was
included in the analytic sample only once at the time of the
first observed diagnosis.
Covariates of interest included sex, age at OUD diagnosis,
race/ethnicity, geographic region (ie, metropolitan vs
nonmetropolitan),neighborhoodeducationallevel,andneigh-
borhood poverty level, using previously established cutoff
levels.29-31 To identify race/ethnicity, we used a combination
of 2000 US Census31 neighborhood characteristics and
surname analysis, which is a validated approach with high
positive predictive value.32
Statistical Analysis
Using the entire sample of 13- to 25-year-old youth with 6 or
more months of continuous enrollment, we calculated an-
nual diagnosis rates (ie, number of first observed diagnoses of
OUD in a year divided by total person-years contributed)
according to age group (13-15, 16-17, 18-20, and 21-25 years).
Forallsubsequentanalyses,welimitedthesampletoyouth
whohadreceivedanOUDdiagnosis.Wethenidentifiedthepro-
portion of youth who received buprenorphine or naltrexone
within 6 months of the diagnosis. Among youth who received
pharmacotherapy,weexaminedlineartimetrendsinreceiptof
buprenorphinecomparedwithnaltrexone,introducingsplines
with 2 knots defined a priori corresponding to the FDA ap-
proval of buprenorphine and buprenorphine-naltrexone in
October 2002, and of intramuscular extended-release naltrex-
one in October 2010. We then identified differences between
youth who received buprenorphine compared with naltrex-
one. Where cell counts were less than 10, categories were
excluded or collapsed together to protect confidentiality.
To compare characteristics of youth who did and did not
receive pharmacotherapy, we used logistic regression to iden-
tify associations between study covariates and medication re-
ceipt. We subsequently generated a multivariable model in-
cluding all study covariates, given the known association of
each covariate with access to addiction treatment33-35; we
additionally adjusted for year as an indicator variable to ac-
count for secular trends. Using this multivariable model and
the margins command in Stata, we then calculated the
adjusted probability of receiving pharmacotherapy.
To understand the effect of considering a different time-
frame for receipt of pharmacotherapy after OUD diagnosis, we
conducted sensitivity analyses in which the outcome of inter-
est was receipt of a medication within 3 and 12 months (com-
paredwith6months)ofOUDdiagnosisandrequiring3ormore
and 12 or more months of continuous enrollment, respec-
tively. We repeated the multivariable model for both time-
frames. Analyses were conducted from April 25 to December
31, 2016, using Stata, version 13.1 (StataCorp LP). All statisti-
cal tests were 2-sided and considered significant at P < .05.
Results
Between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2014, there were
9 710 131 youth aged 13 to 25 years in the Optum database with
6 or more months of continuous enrollment and, of these
youth, 20 822 (0.2%) met the criteria for an OUD diagnosis.
Median time observed prior to first OUD diagnosis was 20
monthsperindividual(interquartilerange[IQR],7-45months).
Figure 1 shows the diagnosis rate by calendar year according
to age. The overall diagnosis rate increased with each subse-
quent study year, rising nearly 6-fold, from 0.26 per 100 000
person-years in 2001 to 1.51 per 100 000 person-years in 2014.
This rise was driven primarily by increases in diagnoses among
young adults (≥18 years), although diagnosis rates for all age
categories increased over the study period.
Table 1 displays the characteristics of the sample. Among
youth with OUD, 65.8% were male and mean age (SD) was 21.0
(2.5) years at the time of diagnosis; most youth with OUD came
from a predominantly non-Hispanic white neighborhood
(82.2%). Compared with the overall sample, youth with OUD
were more likely to be male or from a non-Hispanic white
neighborhood,metropolitanarea,higheducationallevelneigh-
borhood, low poverty level neighborhood, or the Northeast.
Overall, 5580 (26.8%) youth with OUD received either
buprenorphine or naltrexone within 6 months of their first

 observed diagnosis. Figure 2 shows the percentage of youth
who received medications by year. Medication receipt in-
creased more than 10-fold from 2002, the year with the low-
est percentage of youth receiving pharmacotherapy (3.0%), to
2009, the year with the highest percentage (31.8%). For the
mostrecentstudyyear(2014),thepercentagewas27.5%.Medi-
cation receipt increased overall during the study period (odds
ratio [OR], 1.11 per year; 95% CI, 1.10-1.12). In analyses han-
dling year as a continuous predictor with splines correspond-
ing to FDA approval of buprenorphine in 2002 and of intra-
muscular extended-release naltrexone in 2010, the odds of
receiving buprenorphine relative to naltrexone increased from
2002 to 2010 (OR, 1.31 per year; 95% CI, 1.22-1.39), but the odds
of receiving naltrexone relative to buprenorphine increased
from 2010 to 2014 (OR, 1.17 per year; 95% CI, 1.09-1.25).
Table 2 displays the percentage of youth who received a
medication according to sociodemographic characteristics. In
the multivariable model, factors significantly associated with
decreased odds of medication receipt included younger age,
female sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and
low-middle neighborhood poverty level. Figure 3 shows time
trends in the adjusted probability of receiving a medication ac-
cording to age group. Increases were greatest between 2003
and 2007, with larger increases observed among older youth
compared with younger individuals.
Table 3 compares the characteristics of youth who re-
ceived buprenorphine compared with those who received nal-
trexone. Youth were less likely to receive buprenorphine than
naltrexone if they were younger or female. They were more
likely to receive buprenorphine if they were from a nonmet-
ropolitan area; low-middle or low educational level neighbor-
hood; low-middle, high-middle, or high poverty level neigh-
borhood; or from the Midwest.
Sensitivity analyses examining medication receipt within
3 and 12 months are reported in eTables 2 and 3 in the Supple-
ment, respectively. Although effect sizes across age, sex, and
race/ethnicity strata using 3- and 12-month timeframes were
similar to those for a 6-month timeframe, adjusted ORs were
not significant for non-Hispanic black youth, using a 3-month
timeframe, or for non-Hispanic black youth and Hispanic
youth, using a 12-month timeframe.
Discussion
In this large national study of buprenorphine and naltrexone
dispensing among commercially insured youth with OUD, we
found that only 1 in 4 youth received pharmacotherapy within
6monthsofdiagnosisduringthe2001-2014studyperiod.From
2002 (when buprenorphine was introduced) to 2009, the per-
centageofyouthreceivingmedicationincreasedmorethan10-
fold, but subsequently declined amidst escalating OUD diag-
nosisrates.Theoddsofreceivingpharmacotherapywerelower
with younger age and among females compared with males,
and non-Hispanic black and Hispanic youth compared with
white youth. Overall, buprenorphine was dispensed 8 times
more often than naltrexone. Naltrexone was more commonly
dispensed to younger individuals and females and to youth in
metropolitan areas, higher educational level neighborhoods,
and lower poverty level neighborhoods.
Only a minority of youth with OUD received pharmaco-
therapy,thusrevealingapotentiallycriticaltreatmentgap.This
finding reconfirms the 2016 surgeon general’
s report that high-
lighted the large number of youth with untreated addiction27
and also supports the recent policy statement from the Ameri-
canAcademyofPediatricscallingforexpandedaccesstomedi-

 cations for youth with OUD.25 Notably, we observed a de-
crease in the percentage of youth receiving pharmacotherapy
from 2009 onward after a preceding rise. This decrease oc-
curred amidst an escalating OUD diagnosis rate, as well as an
increasingnumberofyoungadultsnationwidereceivinghealth
insuranceunderanAffordableCareActprovisionallowingcov-
erage under a parent’
s plan.36 Both of these forces likely re-
sulted in an expansion in the number of youth in OUD care,
which may not have been accompanied by improved access
to medications. National data preceding the Affordable Care
Actsuggestthatyouthwithcommercialinsurancearelesslikely
to receive addiction treatment (with or without pharmaco-
therapy) than are youth with public insurance.37 In the face of
changingnationalhealthinsurancepolicies,furtherstudiesare
needed to understand differences in diagnosis and treatment
between commercially and publicly insured youth with OUD.
Wefoundthatadolescentsyoungerthan16yearswereleast
likelytoreceivemedications,afindinglikelyreflectingthatbu-
prenorphine, the most common medication dispensed, is FDA
approved only for individuals 16 years or older.16,20,21 We also
observed that few adolescents received naltrexone, even af-
ter the introduction of its long-acting injectable formulation
in 2010. Although trials comparing the efficacy of buprenor-
phine and naltrexone are pending,38 our results suggest that
buprenorphine is much more commonly used; further stud-
ies should characterize patient, caregiver, and clinician pref-
erences regarding these medications in addition to treatment
outcomes.
Despite the demonstrated efficacy and FDA approval of
buprenorphine for adolescents 16 years or older,16,19,20 we
found that those aged 16 and 17 years were less likely than
young adults 18 years or older to receive pharmacotherapy. It
is well established that adolescents experience difficulty ac-
cessingaddictiontreatment.25,27Availabilityofservicesforado-
lescents is limited; fewer than 1 in 3 specialty drug treatment
programs in the United States offers care to adolescents.39
Nationwide, there is a shortage of physicians outside metro-
politan areas with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine and,
compounding this, pediatricians who prescribe buprenor-
phinearerare.33,40Nonetheless,wedidnotobservelowerodds
of receiving medication outside metropolitan areas.22 In one
recent national study, access to buprenorphine significantly
improved in rural areas from 2002 to 2011.40 Our results build
on these prior findings by highlighting that, even though ac-
cess to medications may be improving in many locations, use
of pharmacotherapy among youth remains low overall.
Ensuring access to medications among youth should remain
a critical focus to ensure timely and equitable care regardless
of location.
Our results suggest that the treatment gap for youth is
greater for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic youth as well as
for females. Underlying reasons are unclear and may relate to
access to care, denial of care, or clinician bias.14,15 Prior stud-
ies have shown that poorer access to substance use treatment
among minorities is in part explained by disparities in health
insurance coverage.34,41 However, our results indicate that,
even with coverage, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic youth
are less likely than non-Hispanic white youth to receive medi-
cations for OUD. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use
and Health highlight that, although receipt of past-year treat-
ment between 2001 and 2008 among non-Hispanic white
adolescents with any type of substance use disorder was low
(10.7%),itwassignificantlylowerfornon-Hispanicblack(6.9%)
and Hispanic adolescents (8.5%).14 Even once they are in treat-
ment, only half of non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adoles-
cents complete treatment—a significantly lower proportion
than non-Hispanic white adolescents.15 Similarly, data sug-
gest that females may experience greater barriers to addic-
tion treatment and demonstrate poorer outcomes compared
with males.42 It is critical that clinicians and policymakers

 working to expand access to pharmacotherapy for youth en-
sure that services are disseminated in a way that addresses,
rather than worsens, racial/ethnic and sex disparities.
Since most youth with OUD do not receive medications in
a timely manner, strategies to improve access to evidence-
based treatment for adolescents are needed. One strategy is
to increase the number of pediatric addiction subspecialists.43
With the recent recognition of addiction medicine by the
American Board of Medical Specialties, pediatricians and fam-
ily physicians have new opportunities to pursue board certi-
fication and are well poised to disseminate developmentally
appropriate services for youth.44 However, since there are
unlikely to be sufficient pediatric addiction subspecialists to
address the large number of youth with OUD, an additional
strategy is to implement pharmacotherapy in pediatric pri-
mary care.25,44 This approach is increasingly used to treat
adults with OUD45,46 and is recommended by the American
Academy of Pediatrics.25
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. First, we could not
assess the severity of individuals’addiction. It is possible that
olderyouthorotherdemographicgroupshadmoresevereOUD
for which pharmacotherapy was more strongly indicated.
Second, our approach likely underestimated the number of
youth with OUD since we relied on billing diagnoses. The ac-
tual proportion of youth with OUD who receive pharmaco-
therapymaybeevenlowerthanreportedhereinbecausemany
youth go undiagnosed or clinicians may be reluctant to code
this sensitive diagnosis.47 Third, we were unable to assess
receipt of methadone. Since provision of methadone to ado-
lescents younger than 18 years is highly restricted,48 we do not
anticipate that many underage youth received methadone;
some youth 18 years or older may have received methadone
from publicly funded programs.15,49 Fourth, our sample in-
cluded only commercially insured youth; thus, generalizabil-
ity to populations without private health insurance is
unclear. Recent data suggest that adults without health insur-
anceareunlikelytoreceivepharmacotherapyforOUD,whereas
adults with public health insurance may be as likely to
receive pharmacotherapy as those with private insurance.50
Conclusions
We observed improvements in the percentage of youth receiv-
ing pharmacotherapy for OUD between 2001 and 2014, but
noted an apparent decrease after 2009 amidst an escalating
diagnosis rate and despite the FDA approval of long-acting
injectable naltrexone in 2010. There remains substantial room
forimprovementintheprovisionofpharmacotherapytoyouth
with OUD. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
2016 surgeon general’
s report highlight that intervention early
in the life course of youth addiction is critical for preventing
progression to more severe disease,25,27 yet our data indicate
that medications are underutilized for youth. Adolescents
might especially be underserved in the current treatment en-
vironment, and female, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic

 youth appear less likely than their age-matched peers to re-
ceive medications. In the face of a worsening opioid crisis in
the United States, strategies to expand the use of pharmaco-
therapy for adolescents and young adults are greatly needed,
and special care is warranted to ensure equitable access for all
affected youth to avoid exacerbating health disparities.
