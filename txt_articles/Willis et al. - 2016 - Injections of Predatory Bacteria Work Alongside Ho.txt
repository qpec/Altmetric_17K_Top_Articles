SUMMARY
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus are predatory bacteria
that invade and kill a range of Gram-negative bacte-
rial pathogens in natural environments and in vitro
[1, 2]. In this study, we investigated Bdellovibrio as
an injected, antibacterial treatment in vivo, using
zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae infected with an anti-
biotic-resistant strain of the human pathogen Shigella
flexneri. When injected alone, Bdellovibrio can persist
for more than 24 hr in vivo yet exert no pathogenic ef-
fects on zebrafish larvae. Bdellovibrio injection of ze-
brafish containing a lethal dose of Shigella promotes
pathogen killing, leading to increased zebrafish sur-
vival. Live-cell imaging of infected zebrafish reveals
that Shigella undergo rounding induced by the inva-
sive predation from Bdellovibrio in vivo. Furthermore,
Shigella-dependent replication of Bdellovibrio was
captured inside the zebrafish larvae, indicating active
predation in vivo. Bdellovibrio can be engulfed and
ultimately eliminated by host neutrophils and macro-
phages, yet have a sufficient dwell time to prey on
pathogens. Experiments in immune-compromised
zebrafish reveal that maximal therapeutic benefits
of Bdellovibrio result from the synergy of both bacte-
rial predation and host immunity, but that in vivo
predation contributes significantly to the survival
outcome. Our results demonstrate that successful
antibacterial therapy can be achieved via the host
immune system working together with bacterial
predation by Bdellovibrio. Such cooperation may
be important to consider in the fight against anti-
biotic-resistant infections in vivo.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Injected Predatory Bdellovibrio Persist in Zebrafish
Larvae without Ill Effects and Treat Shigella Infection
In Vivo
The rise in antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Gram-negative bacte-
rial infections in hospital patients has prompted an urgent search
for novel antibacterial agents [3]. One candidate group is the
naturally predatory bacteria Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which
invade and kill a wide range of Gram-negative bacterial patho-
gens [1]. Invasion is followed by pathogen rounding, after which
the prey pathogen dies [2]. Bdellovibrio replicate within the dead
pathogen, which persists as a stable ‘‘bdelloplast’’ structure until
being lysed 3–4 hr after invasion [4]. Prey lysis releases mature
Bdellovibrio progeny that can seek further bacterial victims
(Figure 1A).
Given that Bdellovibrio are ubiquitous in nature, it is likely that
these bacteria are already being harmlessly ingested in food
or water. Indeed, low levels of Bdellovibrio 16S rRNA have
been detected in gut samples from healthy children [5]. Although
no equivalent studies have been conducted in adults, there is
no known association of Bdellovibrio with disease. Previously,
non-injected administrations of Bdellovibrio have been shown
to reduce pathogen numbers by oral administration versus
Salmonella enteritidis in the gut of chickens [6] and by external
application against eye infection in cattle [7–9]. Emerging global
antibiotic resistance calls for new injected therapies to target
infected wounds and body compartments. The capability of
injected Bdellovibrio to treat bacterial infections has not been
tested, nor has the interaction of predatory bacteria with
leukocytes, and successes here could dramatically expand the
therapeutic scope of predatory bacteria against life-threatening
infections. It is, therefore, important to consider the extent to
which injected Bdellovibrio survive in the presence of a verte-
brate immune system and whether leukocyte interactions aid
or prevent pathogen killing in vivo. Measuring these parameters
is crucial to develop the therapeutic potential of Bdellovibrio.
The transparent zebrafish larva provides a unique opportunity
to quantify and visualize in vivo both the spread or restriction
of bacterial infection as well as bacterial interactions with im-
mune cells [10]. In particular, the zebrafish hindbrain ventricle
is highly amenable to imaging, enabling us to follow injected
Bdellovibrio ± pathogenic bacteria over time (Figure S1A). To first
test for any pathogenic effects of Bdellovibrio inside a vertebrate
host, we injected the hindbrain ventricle of zebrafish larvae
at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) with 1–10 3 104 plaque-form-
ing units (PFUs) of mCherry B. bacteriovorus HD100 alone.
This assessment was also essential to determine whether in-
jected Bdellovibrio alone would survive in the zebrafish long
enough to successfully prey on pathogen infections. Live-cell
imaging showed a gradual reduction in fluorescence from

 mCherry-Bdellovibrio following injection, although some bacte-
ria were clearly observed in vivo after 24 hr post-infection (hpi)
(Figure 1B). For quantification of the survival of Bdellovibrio
in vivo, injected larvae were homogenized and predatory bacte-
ria enumerated over time post-infection (Figure 1C). Consistent
with observations from live-cell imaging, we detected a steady
decline in Bdellovibrio numbers from 2 hpi, and by 48 hpi the
bacteria were largely eliminated. Similar results were obtained
using a 10-fold higher dose of Bdellovibrio or in larvae injected
2 dpf when the immune system is less developed (Figures
S1B–S1D). These results reflect the obligatory prey-dependent
lifestyle of Bdellovibrio. They are able to survive within zebrafish
for extended periods of time but are unable to replicate in
the absence of prey bacteria, giving an opportunity for Bdellovi-
brio to act therapeutically before ultimately being cleared. More-
over, Bdellovibrio-injected zebrafish larvae displayed normal
morphology and locomotive activity, with no signs of develop-
mental toxicity or reduced viability (Figures 1D and S1E). These
results raise no concern for the use of Bdellovibrio as a thera-
peutic agent in vivo, and its natural clearance could be viewed
as a beneficial property of a limited treatment.
Given that Bdellovibrio have no adverse effects on zebrafish,
we tested their efficacy as an antibacterial agent against a strep-
tomycin- and carbenicillin-resistant strain of Shigella flexneri
M90T. Shigella is a Gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen
that is responsible for 163 million illness episodes and over 1
million deaths annually [11]. Similar to many other Gram-nega-
tive pathogens in hospital patients, cases of antibiotic-resistant
Shigella are rising [12]. Bdellovibrio invade Gram-negative path-
ogens without a simple receptor-based recognition system,
making Bdellovibrio resistance genetically complex for prey to
acquire. Previous studies have used the zebrafish as a model or-
ganism to study the infection biology of S. flexneri M90T infection
in vivo [13, 14]. We developed this model of Shigella infection to
incorporate the additional injection of B. bacteriovorus and test
its therapeutic potential. Here, 30–90 min after an otherwise le-
thal (at 48–72 hpi) hindbrain inoculation of GFP-Shigella M90T
(>5 3 103 colony-forming units [CFUs]), we injected 1–2 3 105
PFUs of mCherry-Bdellovibrio into the hindbrain ventricle of ze-
brafish larvae. In the absence of Bdellovibrio injection, zebrafish
larvae showed increasing fluorescence of GFP-Shigella (Fig-
ure 1E; Movie S1). Strikingly, larvae injected with Bdellovibrio
showed diminishing fluorescence of GFP-Shigella in regions
contacting mCherry-Bdellovibrio (Figure 1E; Movie S1). Consis-
tent with this, Shigella enumeration demonstrated that zebrafish
larvae injected with Bdellovibrio were able to control Shigella
replication significantly better than those infected with Shigella
alone (Figure 1F). Moreover, Bdellovibrio could rescue zebrafish
from lethal Shigella infection, increasing survival by �35% at
72 hpi (Figure 1G).
Bdellovibrio Prey on Shigella In Vitro and In Vivo inside
Living Zebrafish
To confirm susceptibility of Shigella to Bdellovibrio predation,
we performed co-incubation assays in vitro, and we observed
mCherry-Bdellovibrio invade GFP-Shigella and, subsequently,
induce prey rounding to form bdelloplasts (Figure 2A). In live-
cell counting assays of viability in buffer, Shigella numbers
were reduced >4,000-fold by Bdellovibrio treatment (Figure 2B).
Plate reader assays measuring optical density of Shigella and
fluorescence of mCherry-Bdellovibrio confirmed that reduction
in Shigella numbers was followed by a rise in Bdellovibrio
numbers after an �3 hr predatory cycle, during which they
invade and grow within Shigella and then emerge (Figures 2C
and 2D).
To investigate Bdellovibrio predation of Shigella in vivo,
we imaged the zebrafish tail muscle after sequential GFP-
Shigella and mCherry-Bdellovibrio co-injections. Shigella are
rod-shaped bacteria (�0.5 3 2.0 mm); however, Shigella in
the presence of Bdellovibrio were mostly rounded (�1.0 3
1.0 mm), suggesting their invasion by Bdellovibrio inside zebra-
fish (Figure 2E). To investigate this further, we followed in vivo
predator-prey interactions at the level of single cells (Fig-
ure 2F). Remarkably, confocal microscopy inside live zebra-
fish confirmed that mCherry-Bdellovibrio invade individual
GFP-Shigella to form green rounded bdelloplasts containing
red Bdellovibrio over a similar time frame to that seen in vitro
(Movie S2). To test for Bdellovibrio predation of Shigella at
the whole-animal level, we quantified Bdellovibrio over time af-
ter sequential GFP-Shigella and mCherry-Bdellovibrio co-injec-
tions (Figure 2G). As expected from experiments performed
both in vitro (Figure 2D) and in vivo (Figure 1C), in the absence
of Shigella, prey zebrafish larvae showed decreasing numbers
of Bdellovibrio over the 24 hr following infection (Figure 2G).
In contrast, zebrafish larvae infected with Shigella and Bdellovi-
brio showed significantly increased numbers of Bdellovibrio at
5 hpi, indicating predatory replication inside Shigella in vivo.
Thus, live bacterial predation is occurring within zebrafish. To
dissect the efficacy of Bdellovibrio therapy in the context of
innate immunity, we next tested how leukocytes can affect
the efficacy of Bdellovibrio predation in our zebrafish infection
model.
(E) WT AB zebrafish larvae were injected in the hindbrain ventricle at 3 dpf with >5 3 103 CFUs of GFP-S. flexneri (green), followed by a hindbrain injection of either
PBS or 1–2 3 105 PFUs of mCherry-Bdellovibrio (red), 30–90 min after the initial Shigella infection. Representative images of the hindbrain ventricle in PBS- or
Bdellovibrio-treated zebrafish larvae infected with Shigella are shown. Dotted square shows region of interaction between fluorescent Shigella and Bdellovibrio.

 Bdellovibrio Is Recognized and Engulfed by Zebrafish
Leukocytes In Vivo
Time-lapse microscopy in the hindbrain showed that, by 6 hr
following injection, the initially dispersed mass of mCherry-
Bdellovibrio
clustered
and
formed
dynamic
punctae
of
�10 mm. Similar observations were made after caudal vein
injection of Bdellovibrio into the bloodstream of zebrafish larvae
(Figure S2A). These observations suggest that Bdellovibrio can
reside within leukocytes. Although little studied, some features
of Bdellovibrio have been predicted to allow a degree of ‘‘silent
running’’ in the immune system of a vertebrate. Bdellovibrio are
characteristically small, 0.25 3 1.0 mm, comprise a single-mem-
brane-sheathed flagellum, and have a modified mannosylated
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane [15]. Furthermore,
Bdellovibrio gene expression and surface protein production
are significantly lower outside of bacterial prey hosts than inside
[16, 17]. To test for innate immune detection of Bdellovibrio
in vivo, we injected larvae with mCherry-Bdellovibrio, and
quantified the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
interleukin 1 b (il1b) and tumor necrosis factor a (tnf-a) by qRT-
PCR. Increased expression of both il1b and tnf-a was detected
4 hr after larval inoculation of Shigella, Bdellovibrio, or Shigella +
Bdellovibrio combined (Figure S2B). Importantly, the cytokine
response from Shigella + Bdellovibrio together is not additive
beyond Shigella alone, demonstrating that Bdellovibrio is not
solely stimulating a further immune response to help clear path-
ogenic bacteria.
Cytokine signaling during zebrafish infection is typically
accompanied by an active immune cell response [18, 19].
The innate immune system of zebrafish is highly homolo-
gous to that of humans, and responses are mediated by
neutrophils and macrophages [19]. Leukocytes do not typically
reside in the hindbrain during steady-state conditions, making
this
site

to

leukocyte
migration
in
response to injected bacteria. To test Bdellovibrio interactions
with leukocytes, we used Tg(mpx:GFP)i114 transgenic larvae
with
GFP-neutrophils
and
Tg(mpeg1:Gal4-FF)gl25/Tg(UAS-
E1b:nfsB.mCherry)c26 transgenic larvae with mCherry-macro-
phages.
Consistent
with
a

response
(Figure S2B), imaging of Bdellovibrio hindbrain injections in ze-
brafish with these fluorescent leukocytes revealed that both
neutrophils and macrophages localize to the site of injection
(Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S3). Despite detection of Bdellovi-
brio by innate immune cells in vivo, quantification of leukocyte
recruitment to the larval head, via image analysis, revealed only
a slight increase over PBS controls in neutrophils (1.5-fold ±
0.1) and macrophages (1.2-fold ± 0.1) in the hindbrain at
6 hpi (Figures 3C and 3D).
Analysis by confocal microscopy of Bdellovibrio-leukocyte in-
teractions within live zebrafish confirmed that these bacteria are
engulfed by both neutrophils and macrophages (Figures S2C
and S2D; Movie S4). To assess the role of leukocytes in
Bdellovibrio clearance, we performed experiments in immuno-
compromised zebrafish larvae using an antisense morpholino
oligonucleotide targeting Pu.1, a zebrafish transcription factor
driving myeloid gene expression [20]. Larvae depleted of leuko-
cytes, via prior injection of Pu.1-targeting morpholino into the
one- to eight-cell-stage embryo, were injected at 3 dpf in the
hindbrain with 1–2 3 105 PFUs of Bdellovibrio. In agreement
with a role for leukocytes in the clearance of Bdellovibrio in vivo,
significantly more predatory bacteria were recovered from
larval homogenates of Pu.1 morphants as compared to controls
(Figures 3E and S2E). Survival of control or Pu.1 morphants
injected with Bdellovibrio was not significantly different from
each other (Figure S2F), highlighting that prolonged exposure
to Bdellovibrio is not detrimental to the health of an immune-
compromised animal.
Bdellovibrio Work alongside Innate Immune Cells to
Protect Against Shigella Infection In Vivo
To understand better the relative contributions of Bdellovibrio
and the host immune system to Shigella clearance, we per-
formed infection studies in zebrafish larvae in which leukocytes
were depleted by Pu.1 morpholino. Control and Pu.1 morphants
were injected with lethal hindbrain doses of Shigella as before
and treated with PBS or Bdellovibrio (Figure S3A). Enumerations
of Shigella from larval homogenates showed that treatment with
Bdellovibrio reduced Shigella numbers in both immune-compro-
mised and immune-competent zebrafish larvae (Figure 4A), but
survival was significantly greater in immune-competent larvae
(Figure 4B). Remarkably, these results show that maximal thera-
peutic benefit of Bdellovibrio against a Gram-negative bacterial
infection is ultimately the product of eukaryotic leukocytes
working cooperatively with prokaryotic predators.

 The Bdellovibrio predatory process, which we have shown to
be effective in vivo, could possibly allow treatment of infection
sites in humans [21]. We propose that, following Bdellovibrio
application, an early predatory-killing phase can reduce path-
ogen burden to a level manageable for clearance by the verte-
brate innate immune system (Figure 4C). Predation will release
small pathogen-derived fragments into the vertebrate, albeit
in a digested state, after predator enzyme action. The limited
immune stimulation by the injected Bdellovibrio (and possibly
these pathogen fragments) is not detrimental to the well-
being of zebrafish larvae. This limited immune stimulation may
contribute to the clearance of Shigella, but active predation
with predator-prey encounters in vivo occurs as early as
30 min post-injection (Figure 2F; Movie S1), time points before
extensive leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, Bdellovibrio have
replicated extensively in vivo at 5 hr, in a process dependent
on Shigella killing (Figure 2G).
Predator-prey interactions in our experiments occurred early,
when a significant percentage of pathogens would be outside of
leukocytes. Bdellovibrio engulfed by leukocytes inside zebrafish
were detectable by their mCherry fluorescence within the vacu-
oles of those leukocytes for up to 6 hr (Movie S4). This suggests
that predatory bacteria may persist intracellularly within immune
cells. Future studies beyond this work will be testing whether
intracellular Bdellovibrio are able to access, invade, and kill
Gram-negative pathogens, which themselves invade leuko-
cytes, such as Shigella [22].
In conclusion, these results highlight the first successful use
of Bdellovibrio in vivo as an injected antibacterial therapy,
improving survival in live infected animals. The zebrafish infec-
tion model reveals host recognition and clearance of Bdellovibrio
within days following treatment, a feature that provides a useful
limitation to an applied therapy. Most importantly, we show that
injected Bdellovibrio persist in vivo sufficiently long enough with
predatory capacity to reduce numbers of pathogenic bacteria,
before themselves being removed by immune action of the host.
In our study, the prokaryotic predator Bdellovibrio works
together with the host immune system, which would otherwise
be overwhelmed by a Gram-negative infection. These biological
experiments suggest that when tackling pathogenic AMR bacte-
rial infections in a human medical setting, active predation and
any associated/limited immune-stimulatory side effects can be
beneficial as long as patient physiology and well-being can be
supported. Future experiments will allow us to characterize the
host immune response in more detail, determine how predators
can be prepared with modified immune-stimulatory properties,
and examine how multiple doses of predators can be applied
in more long-lived infections. The data in this study represent
key milestones in future use of Bdellovibrio as a ‘‘living antibiotic’’
in vivo, and they warrant further research into the development of
predatory bacteria as an antibacterial agent for infected sites
or wounds in higher vertebrates and, ultimately, humans. The
strength of such prokaryotic-predator: eukaryotic-leukocyte
combinations is an important therapeutic consideration as we
move forward in responding to new Gram-negative bacterial
threats.

(C) Model for the therapeutic benefit of Bdellovibrio as an antibacterial agent against S. flexneri in vivo. The zebrafish immune system alone is unable to control
high doses of Shigella (green) injected into the hindbrain; without treatment, bacterial replication results in death of the larva. Injection of live predatory Bdellovibrio
(red) 30–90 min after Shigella infection is therapeutically beneficial to the host. Here, live invasive predation of Shigella by Bdellovibrio rounds and then kills the
Shigella, significantly reducing host bacterial burden. Remaining Shigella and Bdellovibrio themselves are ultimately cleared by host processes, including
leukocyte action. Together, the immune system cooperates with predation to clear bacterial infection and promote survival.
