 Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes devastating congenital birth defects. We 
isolated a human monoclonal antibody (mAb), ZKA190, that potently cross-neutralizes multi-
lineage ZIKV strains. ZKA190 is highly effective in vivo in preventing morbidity and mortality of 
ZIKV-infected mice. NMR and cryo-electron microscopy show its binding to an exposed epitope 
on DIII of the E protein. ZKA190 Fab binds all 180 E protein copies, altering the virus quaternary 
arrangement and surface curvature. However, ZIKV escape mutants emerged in vitro and in vivo 
in the presence of ZKA190, as well as of other neutralizing mAbs. To counter this problem, we 
developed a bispecific antibody (FIT-1) comprising ZKA190 and a second mAb specific for DII of 
E protein. In addition to retaining high in vitro and in vivo potencies, FIT-1 robustly prevented 
viral escape, warranting its development as a ZIKV immunotherapy.
Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Effective therapeutics and vaccines against Zika virus (ZIKV) are urgently needed. Although 
ZIKV generally causes asymptomatic or mild disease, it can lead to neurological 
complications both in adulthood and during fetal development (Honein et al., 2017), likely 
due to infection of neural progenitor cells (Frontera and da Silva, 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016). 
Further, infection of the testes has been shown to cause infertility in mice (Govero et al., 
2016).
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of ZIKV revealed high structural similarity to other 
flaviviruses (Kostyuchenko et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016). The smooth-surfaced mature 
ZIKV particle comprises 180 copies of E protein organized in icosahedral symmetry, each 
asymmetric unit containing three E proteins. Three E protein dimers lie parallel to each other 
building a raft, and thirty rafts form a herringbone pattern. The E protein consists of three 
domains – DI, DII, and DIII (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Kostyuchenko et al., 2016; Rey et 
al., 1995; Zhao et al., 2016). DIII contains the receptor-binding site and mediates virus

 attachment (Crill and Roehrig, 2001), whereas the fusion loop in DII facilitates virus-
endosomal membrane fusion (Allison et al., 2001). After cell entry, the low endosomal pH 
triggers dramatic structural rearrangement of E protein dimers into trimers, leading to 
membrane fusion (Bressanelli et al., 2004; Modis et al., 2004; Stiasny et al., 1996). The 
post-fusion structure shows DIII rotated ~70° relative to DI, which requires movement of the 
DI-DIII linker (Bressanelli et al., 2004; Modis et al., 2004).
We recently isolated a panel of anti-ZIKV neutralizing human mAbs and identified a DIII-
binding mAb, ZKA190, that showed strong neutralizing activity across ZIKV strains 
(Stettler et al., 2016). Here, we further characterized ZKA190 in vitro and in vivo. Using a 
combination of NMR, cryoEM and molecular simulations, we mapped the ZKA190 epitope 
to an exposed region consisting of the DI-DIII linker and the lateral ridge (LR) region of 
DIII. Different from other DIII antibodies, ZKA190 Fab binds to all 180 E proteins on the 
virus surface, altering the E protein quaternary interactions, causing separation of the rafts 
and flattening their curvature. In vivo studies of ZIKV infection in lethal mouse models 
demonstrated strong protection of ZKA190 from multiple strains. To minimize the risks of 
viral escape and antibody-mediated disease enhancement, we engineered a bispecific 
antibody, which combines ZKA190 with the DII-binding mAb ZKA185 and also includes a 
mutation in the Fc region (LALA) abolishing binding to Fcγ receptor and complement 
(Hessell et al., 2017). FIT-1 retains the breadth and potencies of both parental antibodies and 
was not observed to generate escape mutants, encouraging FIT-1 development as a ZIKV 
therapeutic.
RESULTS
In vitro characterization of the DIII-specific mAb ZKA190
Recombinant ZKA190 synthesized in the IgG1 wild-type (wt) and IgG Fc-LALA format 
potently neutralized African, Asian and American ZIKV strains, with IC50 ranging from 
0.004 to 0.05 nM (Figure 1A; 0.6 to 8 ng/ml). Although both the ZKA190 IgG and its Fab 
bound to E protein with similar affinities (Figure 1C; KD values of 0.3 and 0.2 nM, 
respectively), the Fab neutralized ZIKV infection less potently with a 300-fold higher IC50 
(Figure 1B). Since ZIKV has been shown to infect human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) 
(Garcez et al., 2016; Nowakowski et al., 2016; Onorati et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016), we 
tested ZKA190 wt and LALA, and both fully abolished infection and replication of ZIKV in 
hNPCs (Figure 1D).
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection may contribute to disease severity in 
heterologous secondary DENV infections (Halstead, 2014), caused by the binding of non-
neutralizing or sub-neutralizing concentrations of E- and prM-specific antibodies to mature, 
partially mature and fully immature viruses. ZKA190 supports ADE in K562 cells from 
0.0001 to 1 nM, while ZKA190-LALA did not show any ADE activity (Figure 1E) and 
completely inhibited ADE induced by plasma antibodies from four ZIKV-immune donors 
(Figure 1F).
Anti-prM antibodies are elicited during the human immune response against flaviviruses, 
and they enhance in vitro infection of immature or partially immature virions (Dejnirattisai 
Wang et al.

 et al., 2010). ZKA190-LALA can fully block ADE of ZIKV infection induced by a 
flavivirus cross-reactive anti-prM mAb, DV62, isolated from a dengue patient (Beltramello 
et al., 2010) (Figure 1G). Finally, we compared the ability of ZKA190 wt, LALA and Fab to 
cause or block ADE of ZIKV by human anti-DENV2 plasma or DV62 mAb (Figure 1H). 
Low concentrations of ZKA190 increased DV62-mediated ADE of ZIKV infection, 
consistent with its ability to promote the entry of both immature and mature virions, while at 
concentrations above 1.3 nM (i.e., 200 ng/ml), ZKA190 blocked ADE induced by both anti-
DENV plasma and DV62. At concentrations above 0.06 nM, ZKA190 Fab was equally 
effective as ZKA190-LALA in reducing ADE induced by DV62, indicating that inhibition 
occurs at a post-attachment step, likely fusion.
ZKA190 binds to a conserved and highly accessible region of DIII
The ZKA190 epitope was determined by solution NMR spectroscopy (Bardelli et al., 2015; 
Simonelli et al., 2010; 2013). Differences in the NMR spectra of free and mAb-bound DIII 
identified DIII residues affected by ZKA190 binding, either directly or through allosteric 
effects (Figure S1A). The ZKA190 epitope consists of the LR of DIII (the BC, DE and FG 
loops), as well as part of the DI-DIII linker (Figure 2A). These residues are conserved 
among 217 known ZIKV strains, with the exception of V341I and E393D substitutions in 
the Uganda 1947 MR766 strains (Figure S1D), which ZKA190 was shown to neutralize 
(Figure 1A). The ZKA190 epitope is highly accessible on the ZIKV surface, except for the 
FG loop in the 5-fold vertex (Figure 2B and S1C, molecule A).
Computational docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation, guided and validated 
by both NMR- and cryoEM-derived epitope information as well as DIII mutagenesis, 
showed that ZKA190 binds through an interface characterized by shape and charge 
complementarity (Figures 2B and S1E). The computational model fits well to the cryoEM 
density map of ZIKV-ZKA190 Fab complex (Figure 2C and 3D). Docking suggests that 
there are no direct contacts between ZKA190 and the FG loop on DIII, thus changes in 
NMR signals likely derive from allosteric effects. Consistently, mutations of FG loop 
residues, but not of other NMR-affected residues in the recombinant DIII, did not affect the 
binding affinity of ZKA190 (Figure 2B and S2).
CryoEM structure of ZKA190 complexed with ZIKV
CryoEM micrographs showed that ZKA190 binds to the virus at 4°C, 37°C and 40°C 
(Figure S3A). Structures of ZIKV complexed with ZKA190 Fab at 4°C and 37°C were 
determined to ~22 Å resolution and found to be similar (Figures 2D, S3B and S3C). At this 
resolution, the Fabs and E protein rafts can only be roughly fitted into the density; the 
footprint on DIII cannot be accurately evaluated using cryoEM results alone. In contrast to 
other mAbs against DIII LR of other flaviviruses, Fab ZKA190 bound to all 180 copies of E 
protein on the viral surface (Figure 2D and S3), achieving full occupancy.
Superposition of the structure of the ZKA190 Fab:E protein complex onto the uncomplexed 
ZIKV structure showed that Fabs bound to the E protein molecule around the 5-fold vertex 
clashed with each other (Figure 2G). On the contrary, cryoEM data showed equally strong 
densities of the variable region of the Fabs at all three individual E proteins in the

 asymmetric unit (Figures 2F and S4). To accommodate binding of all five Fabs without 
clashes, the E proteins have to separate from each other in the 5-fold vertex (Figure 2G). 
Comparison of the cryoEM structures of uncomplexed and ZKA190-bound ZIKV showed 
that in the latter, the E protein rafts move to a higher radius (Figure 2E) and are separated 
from each other (Figure 2I); the curvature of the rafts is also flattened (Figure 2H). In the 
uncomplexed ZIKV cryoEM structure, the E protein ectodomain interacts with the 
membrane-associated stem regions of E and M proteins on the virus, and this interaction 
might be disrupted by ZKA190 Fab binding, as suggested by the spatial gap observed 
between the E protein and the lipid bilayer (Figure 2E). The dissociation may increase the 
motion of the rafts, explaining the inability to obtain a higher resolution cryoEM map.
Mechanisms of ZKA190 neutralization
The ability of ZKA190 to efficiently neutralize the virus may involve inhibition of either cell 
attachment or membrane fusion. Another mechanism might involve virus inactivation 
through aggregation. Virus aggregation due to simultaneously engaging epitopes on different 
particles by ZKA190 was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Particles with size 
similar to single virus particle were detected at low mAb concentration, whereas large viral 
aggregates appeared at higher concentration (≥ 33 antibodies per virus) and correlated with 
neutralizing activity (Figure 3A). One caveat is that the contribution of aggregation to 
neutralization may be different in vivo, as the amount of virus could differ.
IgG ZKA190 may also engage neighboring E proteins on the viral surface. As shown by 
cryo-EM, the distance between the Fabs’ CH1 regions bound on the viral surface is 
compatible with that of a full IgG (Figure 3B). However, bivalent binding of a full IgG 
depends not only on the distance between two Fab molecules, but also on their relative 
orientation. Full atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a homology model of 
ZKA190 IgG showed that a single ZKA190 molecule can bridge adjacent E proteins around 
the 5- and 3-fold vertices, but not the 2-fold vertex (Figures 3C and 3D). The Fab regions of 
the modelled ZKA190 IgG correlated well with the cryo-EM structure (Figure 3D). This 
suggests that ZKA190 cross-linking of neighboring E proteins might prevent the E dimers 
from rearrangement into trimers that is required for membrane fusion. Both proposed 
mechanisms imply bivalent binding of ZKA190 IgG. Since ZKA190 Fab also neutralizes 
ZIKV, albeit less efficiently than the full IgG, additional mechanisms may be involved. 
ZKA190 might prevent the attachment of ZIKV to target cells or viral fusion to the 
endosomal membrane.
Neutralization at a post-attachment step is supported by data showing that ZKA190 inhibits 
in vitro ZIKV infection with similar potency regardless of whether the mAb was added to 
the virus pre- or post- attachment to cells (Figure 3E). This result is further supported by the 
qRT-PCR experiments that detect the amount of virus on the cell surface, which does not 
decrease at increasing antibody concentrations (Figure 3F), but rather increased compared to 
the virus-only control, likely due to antibody-mediated virus aggregation (Figure 3A). 
Moreover, confocal microscopy analysis showed that ZIKV-complexed ZKA190 Fab can 
enter cells at neutralizing concentrations exceeding the IC50 by 10,000-fold (Figure 3G).

 In vivo characterization of the DIII-specific mAb ZKA190
ZKA190 and ZKA190-LALA were tested in A129 mice challenged with a lethal dose of 
ZIKV strain MP1751 (African lineage). Prophylaxis with ZKA190 and ZKA190-LALA one 
day before virus challenge protected mice from mortality and morbidity at mAb 
concentrations of 5, 1 or 0.2 mg/kg (Figures 4A–4B). ZKA190-LALA, and to a lesser extent 
ZKA190, delayed morbidity and mortality as compared to the control at 0.04 mg/kg. Viral 
titers in blood and organs were reduced significantly, even in the presence of serum antibody 
levels below 1 μg/ml (Figures S5A–S5A). To determine if low doses of ZKA190 could 
potentially enhance ZIKV infection, we administered 1 mg/kg, 0.04 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg, and 
0.01 mg/kg of ZKA190 to AG129 mice and challenged them with a recently isolated ZIKV 
strain from Nicaragua (Nica 2–16, American lineage). Mice receiving 1 mg/kg of ZKA190 
or ZKA190-LALA were completely protected from ZIKV disease (Figures 4C–4D). 
ZKA190 or ZKA190-LALA at 0.04 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg of partially protected mice from 
mortality and morbidity, and none of the lower antibody doses resulted in enhanced disease 
or infection. Blood viral titers on day 3 post-infection were reduced compared to control 
antibody-treated animals in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure S5E).
To evaluate therapeutic potential, we administered ZKA190 and ZKA190-LALA to A129 
mice at different time-points following ZIKV infection. At a dose of 15 mg/kg, survival rates 
of 80%–100% were achieved, and morbidity was greatly reduced even when treatment was 
given four days post-infection (Figure 4E–G). ZKA190 and ZKA190-LALA treatment at all 
post-infection time-points resulted in significantly reduced viral titers with a clear trend for 
greater reduction with earlier treatment (Figure S6A–S5C). Of note, ZKA190-LALA 
showed a reduced antiviral activity on day 5 as compared to ZKA190 when mAbs were 
given four days post-infection, a result that might relate to the impaired ability of the LALA 
mAb to facilitate rapid clearance of coated virions.
Of the 16 treated mice, one in vivo escape mutant (Monoclonal Antibody Resistant Mutant 
1, MARM1) was isolated containing the amino acid substitution T335R in DIII, which was 
shown to abrogate ZKA190 binding (Figure S2). Viruses from the other treated mice did not 
contain any E mutations (Figures S6D–S5E).
In vitro selection of ZIKV escape mutants
To assess the ability of ZKA190 to select for resistant mutants (MARMs) in vitro, ZIKV 
(H/PF/2013) was passaged in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of ZKA190. 
MARM2, carrying the DIII E370K mutation, was isolated after three rounds of selection. 
The mutation abolished neutralization by ZKA190, but not its binding to DIII (Figure S2). 
The mutations in the in vivo (T335R) and in vitro (E370K) MARMs are located on the BC 
and DE loops of DIII, respectively, and are consistent with the epitope identified by NMR.
Development of the bispecific FIT-1 antibody—Generation of viral escape mutants 
can render antibodies useless for treatment. This may be prevented by making a bispecific 
antibody combining two highly neutralizing mAbs, each specific for a distinct epitope. We 
selected ZKA185 and ZKA230, which potently neutralize African, Asian, and American 
strains with IC50 ranging from 0.02 to 0.62 nM (Figure 5A). ZKA185 binds with high

 affinity to recombinant ZIKV E protein and to Zika virus-like particles (VLP) but not to the 
isolated DIII (Figure 5B). ZKA230 bound to ZIKV VLPs, but not to recombinant E or DIII, 
suggesting that it recognizes a quaternary epitope displayed only on the viral surface (Figure 
5B). ZKA185 IgG and Fab were shown to bind to E and VLP antigens with similar high 
affinity by ELISA. Conversely, ZKA230 Fab bound to VLPs with markedly reduced affinity 
compared to its IgG.
We isolated MARMs of ZKA185 (MARM3) and ZKA230 (MARM4) by passaging virus in 
the presence of sub-neutralizing mAb concentrations. MARM3 contained substitutions at 
K84E and D67H on DII (Figure 5D). MARM4 showed a mixture of different amino acid 
substitutions at position 84 (from K to G, E or R). ZKA190 neutralized ZKA185 and 
ZKA230 MARMs as well as the parental virus (Figure 5C). ZKA185 neutralized both 
ZKA190 and ZKA230 MARMs. In contrast, ZKA230 neutralized only ZKA190 MARM2.
To gain insight into the development of MARMs capable of escaping from the pressure of 
multiple mAbs, we serially passaged ZKA190 MARM2 (E370K) in the presence of 
ZKA185 or ZK230 and found that double MARMs emerged after three to four passages. 
ZKA230 introduced the K84E mutation while ZKA185 selected for the D76G mutation. 
These findings indicate that ZIKV can escape multiple mAbs targeting distinct sites when 
the selection is performed in a stepwise fashion.
MAb ZKA185 was selected to combine with ZKA190 for the development of a bispecific 
antibody since it potently cross-neutralizes ZIKV strains and does not compete with 
ZKA190. We produced a bispecific antibody in the tetravalent symmetric format Fabs-in-
tandem-Ig (FIT-Ig) (Gong et al., 2017). ZKA190 was placed in the outer and ZKA185 in the 
inner Fab position (Figure 5E), using the backbone IgG1 antibody in LALA format (here 
designated FIT-1). FIT-1 bound DIII, E and VLPs in ELISA (Figure 5F) and retained high 
neutralizing potency against ZIKV strains, with IC50 values largely similar to those of the 
parental mAbs (Figure 5G). FIT-1 bound to E protein with higher affinity than either of the 
parental mAbs (KD values: ZKA185 1.8 nM, ZKA190 9.3 nM and FIT-1 KD <1 pM due to 
slower dissociation rate, presumably through avidity effects) and effectively neutralized all 
the ZKA190, ZKA185 and ZKA230 MARMs (Figure 5H). In addition, the neutralizing 
activity of the Fab fragment of FIT-1 (comprising one ZKA190 and one ZKA185) was 
reduced only by about 6-fold (Figure 5I, right panel), whereas those of the individual 
ZKA190 and ZKA185 Fabs were reduced by about 100-fold compared to their full-length 
IgG1 (Figure 1B and Figure 5I). Taken together, these findings suggest the ZKA190 and 
ZKA185 moieties in FIT-1 are both active.
No MARMs were isolated despite 8 rounds of serial passages in the presence of FIT-1. In 
contrast, MARMs appeared after 3 to 4 passages with individual mAbs. Simultaneous 
mutations in both DIII and DII are thus unlikely to occur, suggesting that FIT-1 is a safer 
therapeutic. Confocal microscopy studies showed that FIT-1, like ZKA190, inhibits virus 
infection at a post-attachment step, likely fusion (Figure 5J). Finally, FIT-1and its Fab 
blocked ADE of human anti-DENV2 plasma or DV62 at concentrations above 0.1 and 10 
nM, respectively (Figure 5K)

 We evaluated the therapeutic potential of FIT-1 by administering three different doses (15, 5 
and 1 mg/kg) at three different time-points to mice following ZIKV infection. At a dose of 
15 mg/kg, survival rates were 100% without signs of morbidity even when treatment was 
given three days post-infection (Figure 6); viral titers were abrogated and no escape mutants 
were detected, indicating high in vivo efficacy. Administration of 5 mg/kg resulted in 
survival rates of 70–100%; again, no escape mutants were detected on day 5 after infection. 
The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg) protected when administered on day 1 or 2, but not day 3, 
after infection.
DISCUSSION
The highly potent ZKA190 mAb binds to to the lateral ridge in DIII of the E protein in a 
unique orientation compared to other flavivirus-neutralizing LR-binding mAbs (Edeling et 
al., 2014; Nybakken et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2016) (Figure 7A), resulting in full occupancy 
of all 180 E proteins. Unlike ZKA190, the cryoEM structures of E16:WNV (Kaufmann et 
al., 2006) and ZV23:ZIKV (Wang et al., 2016) showed that their Fabs are unable to bind to 
DIII around the 5-fold vertex. Superposition of the E106:DIII (Edeling et al., 2014), 
ZV23:DIII and ZV67:DIII (Zhao et al., 2016) structures onto an uncomplexed ZIKV 
cryoEM structure showed clashes with the neighboring E proteins around the 5-fold vertex 
(Figure 7B).
Our previous structure of uncomplexed ZIKV revealed that the E protein shell is more 
compact than that of DENV (Kostyuchenko et al., 2016). Binding of ZKA190 disrupts the 
tight interactions between E proteins in the 5-fold vertices at both 4°C and 37°C, thus 
allowing full occupancy. ZKA190 may either select a transient viral conformation where the 
5-fold vertex is “open” (conformational selection) or cause surface structural changes 
(allosteric effects). The latter appears more likely since binding occurs even at 4°C, where 
the thermal motions required for E protein conformational changes are limited. NMR studies 
and DIII mutants indicated that binding of ZKA190 causes an allosteric effect on the DIII 
FG loop, which points towards the center of the 5-fold vertex. ZKA190 binding to one DIII 
near the 5-fold vertex may alter the FG loop conformation, opening the vertex and exposing 
additional ZKA190 binding sites. Alternatively, the antibody could first bind to the 3- and/or 
2-fold vertices, causing allosteric effects throughout the viral surface resulting in opening of 
the 5-fold vertex, to which other antibodies could then bind; however, experimental evidence 
for this is lacking.
Multiple mechanisms may contribute to ZKA190 activity. We showed here that high 
concentrations of ZKA190 induced aggregation of virus particles by crosslinking different 
particles with the two Fab arms. This correlated with increased neutralization activity, 
suggesting a role for aggregation in viral neutralization. Molecular dynamics showed that the 
two Fab arms of ZKA190 can bind within a viral particle, possibly preventing the dramatic 
rearrangement of the E proteins on the virus surface required for fusion.
RT-PCR and confocal microscopy data indicate that the virus remains attached to cells in the 
presence of ZKA190 and is able to enter cells in the presence of neutralizing concentrations 
of ZKA190. Furthermore, similar neutralization profiles of ZKA190 (and FIT-1) in the post-

 and pre-attachment assays, as well as inhibition by the ZKA190 Fab fragment of DENV 
plasma and anti-prM antibody-mediated ADE, support the notion that ZKA190 inhibits a 
post-attachment step, likely fusion. The epitope of ZKA190 encompasses the LR of DIII and 
the DI-DIII linker region. In a normal infection, the low-pH endosomal environment 
provokes the E proteins to rearrange from a dimeric structure to a trimeric post-fusion 
structure. Binding of ZKA190 to the DI–DIII linker and DIII may hinder the movement of 
DIII, preventing rearrangement and thus membrane fusion, as previously suggested in 
structural studies of E16:WNV (Kaufmann et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015).
Although antibody effector functions can enhance the efficacy of anti-flavivirus antibodies 
(Chung et al., 2006), comparison of ZKA190 and ZKA190-LALA in vivo efficacy indicates 
that Fc-dependent mechanisms, such as ADCC or CDC, likely do not play a major role in 
prophylaxis or therapy. Despite clear evidence of in vitro ADE by ZKA190, and in contrast 
to a recent report (Bardina et al., 2017), our in vivo results indicate that ZKA190-mediated 
disease enhancement does not occur even when the mAb is administered at doses expected 
to provide only partial neutralization.
Numerous flavivirus MARMs are readily isolated in in vitro systems (de Alwis et al., 2012; 
Zou et al., 2012), similarly to what we observed with ZKA190, ZKA185 and ZKA230 
mAbs. However, only a few studies described isolation of MARMs in vivo (Lai et al., 2007). 
Here, we isolated a ZKA190 MARM from one animal treated therapeutically, although no 
MARMs were detected in animals treated prophylactically. To reduce the risk of emergence 
of escape mutants, we produced a bispecific antibody coupling ZKA190 to the anti-DII 
ZKA185 mAb. The FIT-1 bispecific antibody is highly potent in vitro and in vivo and did 
not generate escape mutants even after 8 passages.
Flavivirus particles in in vitro preparations represent different maturation states (mature, 
partially immature, and fully immature) (Lok, 2016). Only partially and fully immature 
virions have prM on their surfaces, and anti-prM antibodies can confer infectivity to the 
otherwise non-infectious immature virions (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010). Since anti-prM 
antibodies are elicited in anti-flavivirus immune responses (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010), they 
can contribute significantly to pathogenesis (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010). We showed here that 
ZKA190 and FIT-1 can block in vitro ADE mediated by the cross-reactive prM mAb DV62, 
indicating that ZKA190 can effectively block prM antibody-mediated infection by at least 
partially immature ZIKV particles.
Our current studies in vitro and in lethal adult mouse models showed that the FIT-1 
bispecific antibody is a good candidate for development of antibody-based therapy for ZIKV 
infection. Further studies in pregnant rhesus macaques (Dudley et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 
2017) would enable testing FIT-1 efficacy in blocking fetal infection. The in vivo protective 
activity of FIT-1 indicates that alternative delivery mechanisms, such as DNA or RNA 
vectors, or half-life-extending modification of the Fc, might be achievable to make it cost-
effective for the prevention of congenital ZIKV disease.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Reagents—Cell lines were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. Vero and 
K562 cells were cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 
10% FCS (Hyclone), 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin and L-glutamine (complete DMEM or 
RPMI; all from Invitrogen)). The ZIKV H/PF/2013, MR766 and 
MRS_OPY_Martinique_PaRi_2015 (MRS_OPY) strains used in this work were obtained 
from European-Virus-Archive. The PV10552 strain was isolated in 2016 from the semen of 
an international traveler in Italy and was kindly provided by Fausto Baldanti from the

 Policlinico San Matteo, Italy (accession number KY003154). The Puerto Rican 2013 
PRVABC59 strain was obtained from the CDC (GenBank Accession #KU501215). The 
virus had been passaged three times in Vero cells prior to our acquisition. Vero cells were 
maintained in Eagle Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The virus was passaged two more times in 
Vero cells to establish a viral stock. Viral stocks were titered by limiting dilution plaque 
assay on Vero cells. Infections with ZIKV were performed at 37°C for 4 hr (h) before cells 
were overlaid with methylcellulose. After 6 days, plaques were visualized by crystal violet 
staining. The murine cross-reactive mAb used to detect ZIKV and DENV infection was 
produced from the 4G2 hybridoma purchased from ATCC and purified using protein G 
affinity chromatography (Thermo Scientific). The antigens used in ELISA were: 
recombinant E protein from ZIKV (Meridian LifeScience, R01635), recombinant DIII 
synthesized using the sequence from ZIKV Brazil 2015 strain (SPH2015). The DIII of 
ZIKV was expressed in E. coli Rosetta and Rosetta pLysS cells respectively, with a pET21 
vector (Novagen) either in LB or M9 minimal media with aptly labelled ingredients as 
required for NMR (15N NH4Cl, 13C Glucose, 70% D2O). The cells were induced at OD600 
= 0.6 with 0.5 mM of IPTG and harvested after 4 hr post-induction. After sonication and 
centrifugation, the pellet was washed and centrifuged two times in sodium phosphate buffer 
pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 M urea and 1% Triton-X100. The pellet was resuspended in 
phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and 8 M urea (buffer A). Following addition of 0.2% of PEI and 
centrifugation to remove DNA contamination, ammonium sulphate to 60% was added to the 
supernatant to remove traces of PEI. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 
buffer A, and denaturated protein was diluted in refolding buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer 
pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 200 mM arginine) in order to reach a final protein concentration of 
0.2 mg/mL. DIIIs of DENV and ZIKV were purified on a Superdex-75 size exclusion 
column (GE) in PBS buffer. The elution and dynamic light scattering profiles of DIII were 
consistent with monomeric species.
METHOD DETAILS
Production of recombinant IgG and LALA variant—Briefly, the VH and VL 
sequences were cloned into human Igγ1, Igκ and Igλ expression vectors (kindly provided 
by Michel Nussenzweig, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA), essentially as 
described (47). Recombinant mAbs were produced by transient transfection of EXPI293 
cells (Invitrogen), purified by Protein A chromatography (GE Healthcare) and desalted 
against PBS.
Production of recombinant FIT bispecific antibodies—The three genes encoding 
for FIT were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned as follow: i) the VL 
of the outer Fab, followed by the full constant region (lambda or kappa), is fused with the 
VH of the inner and cloned into the Igγ1 expression vector (modified to encode for the 
LALA mutation). The resulting polypeptide 1 is formed by VL and CL of the outer Fab, VH 
of the inner Fab fused to IgG1 CH1-hinge-CH2-CH3 domains; ii) the VH gene of the outer 
Fab (encoding for polypeptide 2 formed by VH and CH1 of the outer Fab) was cloned into 
the Fab expression vector (Igγ1 expression vector in which a stop codon is introduced after 
the codon encoding for the CH1 cysteine residue 220); iii) the VL gene of the inner Fab is

 cloned into the Igκ or Igλ expression vectors (encoding for polypeptide 3 formed by VL and 
CL of the inner Fab). Recombinant FIT-Ig mAbs were produced by transient transfection of 
EXPI293 cells (Invitrogen) using a molar ratio of 1:3:3 of the three constructs described 
above (as described in PCT/US2014/072336), purified by Protein A chromatography (GE 
Healthcare) and desalted against PBS. The proteins were analyzed by by SDS-PAGE in both 
reduced and non-reduced conditions and their concentrations determined by BCA (Pierce, 
Rockford, IL). In non-reduced conditions, FIT-Ig migrated as a major single band of 
approximately 250 KDa. In reducing conditions, each of the FIT-Ig proteins yielded two 
bands, one higher MW band is polypeptide 1 of approximately 75 KDa, and one lower MW 
band corresponds to both polypeptide 2 and 3 overlapped at approximately 25 KDa. To 
further study the physical properties of FIT-Ig in solution, size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) was used to analyze each protein. Purified FIT-Ig, in PBS, was applied on a Superdex 
200 Increase 5/150 GL. All proteins were determined using UV detection at 280 nm and 214 
nm. FIT-Ig proteins exhibited a single major peak, demonstrating physical homogeneity as 
monomeric proteins.
Infection of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)—Adult male fibroblasts 
obtained from the Movement Disorders Bio-Bank (Neurogenetics Unit of the Neurological 
Institute ‘Carlo Besta’, Milan) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai kit 
(Life Technologies). hiPSCs were maintained in feeder-free conditions in mTeSR1 (Stem 
Cell Technologies). To generate embryoid bodies (EBs), dissociated hiPSCs were plated into 
low-adhesion plates in mTeSR1 supplemented with N2 (0.5×) (ThermoFisher Scientific), 
human Noggin (0.5 μg/ml, R&D System), SB431542 (5 μM, Sigma), Y27632 (10 μM, 
Miltenyi Biotec) and penicillin/streptomycin (1%, Sigma) (Marchetto et al., 2010). To obtain 
rosettes, EBs were plated after 10 days onto matrigel-coated plates (1:100, matrigel growth 
factor reduced, Corning) in DMEM/F12 (Sigma) with N2 (1×), non-essential amino acids 
(1%, ThermoFisher Scientific) and penicillin/streptomycin. After 10 days, cells were 
passaged with Accutase (Sigma) and seeded onto matrigel coated-flasks in NPC media 
containing DMEM/F12, N2 (0.5%), B27 (0.5%, ThermoFisher Scientific), penicillin/
streptomycin and FGF2 (20 ng/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific). hNPCs (3×104) were plated on 
coverslips in 24-well plates 3 days prior to infection with PRVABC59 strain. Virus stock was 
incubated with the mAbs 1h prior to addition to hNPCs to obtain an MOI of 0.5. After 4h of 
virus adsorption, culture supernatant was removed and fresh medium containing the mAbs 
was re-added. Supernatant was collected 96h post-infection to measure virus titers by plaque 
assay on Vero cells. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) solution in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Euroclone) for 30 min for indirect immunofluorescence. 
Fixed cells were permeabilized for 30 min in blocking solution, containing 0.2% Triton 
X-100 (Sigma) and 10% donkey serum (Sigma), and incubated overnight at 4°C with the 
primary antibodies in blocking solution. The following antibody was used for detection: 
anti-envelope (1:200, Millipore, MAB10216). Then, cells were washed with PBS and 
incubated for 1h with Hoechst and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 secondary antibodies 
(1:1,000 in blocking solution, ThermoFisher Scientific). After PBS washes, cells were 
washed again and mounted.

 Virus neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement—Neutralization of 
ZIKV infection by mAbs was measured using a micro-neutralization flow cytometry-based 
assay. Different dilutions of mAbs were mixed with ZIKV (MOI of 0.35) for 1 hr at 37°C 
and added to 5000 Vero cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates. After four days for ZIKV, 
the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS containing 1% fetal claf 
serum (Hyclone) and 0.5% saponin, and stained with the mouse mAb 4G2. The cells were 
incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor488 (Jackson Immuno- 
Research, 115485164) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The neutralization titer (50% 
inhibitory concentration [IC50]) is expressed as the antibody concentration that reduced the 
infection by 50% compared to virus-only control wells. ADE was measured by a flow 
cytometry-based assay using K562 cells. mAbs and ZIKV (MOI 0.175) were mixed for 1 hr 
at 37°C and added to 5000 K562 cells/well. After four days, cells were fixed, permeabilized, 
and stained with mAb m4G2 The number of infected cells was determined by flow 
cytometry, as described above.
Size measurement of ZKA190 IgG — ZIKV complex by dynamic light 
scattering—ZIKV was purified as described above and diluted in NTE buffer 
(corresponding to ~0.2 mg/ml E protein). Immune complexes were formed by mixing ZIKV 
with serial dilutions of ZKA190 IgG in IgG/virion molar ratios ranging from 900:1 to 1:1 
(concentration of virion was determined using SDS-PAGE gel by comparing the virus E 
proteins with BSA standards). After one hour incubation at 4°C, the diameter of the immune 
complexes were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the infectivity was 
determined using standard plaque assay in BHK-21 cells. Neutralization is represented as 
the fold reduction of the remaining virus infectivity in each condition compared to the virus 
only control (log10 (virus titer (PFU/ml) in the absence of mAb)/(virus titer (PFU/ml) in the 
presence of mAb). For the size measurement, 15 μl of the sample was loaded into a quartz 
cuvette and measured at 25°C by the Zetasizer Nano S machine (Malvern). Data were 
analyzed using Zetasizer Nano software version 6.01. The deconvolution of the measured 
correlation curve was done using a non-negative least-squares algorithm. Each sample is 
measured 10 times and each data point is a repeat of two independent experiments. Size of 
the immune complex is shown as intensity weighted mean hydrodynamic size of the 
ensemble collection of particles in diameter. Our purified virus alone sample has a 
polydispersity index of 0.2, indicating that the sample is monodisperse and acceptable for 
DLS size measurement. Aggregation of immune complex has very broad size distribution, 
resulting in a polydispersity index higher than 0.6. Therefore, the measured size is not very 
accurate for the aggregations. However, DLS was only used to probe the formation of 
aggregation in this experiment and the exact size of the aggregation is less important.
Pre- and postattachment neutralization assays—The pre- and post-attachment 
neutralization assays were conducted as previously described (Fibriansah et al., 2015). For 
the pre-attachment neutralization assay, BHK-21 cells were grown in 24-well plates. 
Different dilutions of ZKA190 IgG were incubated with 100 plaque forming units (PFU) of 
ZIKV for 1 hr at 4°C and subsequently added to the cells and further incubated for 1 hr at 
4°C. For the post-attachment neutralization assays, the cell monolayer was pre-chilled at 
4°C for 15 min before 100 PFU of ZIKV was added. The cells was co-incubated with the

 virus for 1 hr at 4°C and then washed twice with ice-cold serum-free medium to get rid of 
the unbound virus. Subsequently, different dilutions of ZKA190 IgG were added to the cells 
and further incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. The cells were finally washed twice with ice-cold 
serum-free medium and overlaid with 1% aquacide in RPMI medium supplemented with 2% 
fetal bovine serum. The cell monolayer was fixed and stained after 5-days incubation at 
37°C in order to visualize the plaque formed by un-neutralized ZIKV.
RT–PCR to quantitate virus on cell surface—The number of ZIKV remaining on the 
surface of BHK-21 cells after ZKA190 treatment was measured by quantitative RT–PCR as 
previously described (Fibriansah et al., 2015). The experiment procedure is similar to the 
pre- and post-attachment neutralization assay described above but the quantification of the 
amount of virus particles attached on the cell surface were conducted immediately after the 
final wash of the cells. In pre-attachment condition, 105 PFU of ZIKV was incubated with 
neutralizing concentrations of ZKA190 IgG for 1 hr at 4°C and then added to the cells pre-
chilled at 4°C. After one hour of incubation at 4°C, the cells were washed twice and total 
RNA was purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). In post-attachment condition, the cells 
were first incubated with the same amount of ZIKV at 4°C for 1 hr and then washed twice to 
get rid of the unbound virus. Neutralizing concentrations of ZKA190 IgG were then added 
to the cell and incubated at 4°C for 1 hr. Finally, the cells were washed twice and total RNA 
was purified. Complementary DNA was synthesized using qScript cDNA SuperMix 
(Quantabio). Realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using iQ™ SYBR Green 
supermix kit (Bio-Rad) in a CFX 96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the housekeeping gene to normalize samples. The 
analysis of relative levels of ZIKV RNA in different samples was performed by comparative 
2-ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Gene specific primers (ZIKV-NS1-Forward: 
5′-TGGAGTTCAACTGACGGTCG-3′; ZIKV-NS1-Reverse: 5′-
TACCCCGAACCCATGATCCT-3′; Gapdh- Forward: 5′-
GGCAAGTTCAAAGGCACAGTC-3′; Gapdh-Reverse: 5′-
CACCAGCATCACCCCATTT-3′) were used for the real-time qPCR experiment.
Effect of LALA antibodies on ADE—ZIKV (MOI 0.175) was mixed with plasma from 
primary ZIKV-infected donors for 30 min at 37°C. ZKA190-LALA was added at 50 μg/ml, 
mixed with 5000 K562 cells/well and incubated for three days. Cells were then stained with 
4G2 and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described above.
ELISA—A standard ELISA was used to determine binding of mAbs to ZIKV DIII or E 
proteins. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4°C with 3 μg/ml of antigens. Plates were 
blocked with a 1% w/v solution of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS, incubated 
with serial dilutions of mAbs for 1.5 hr at room temperature. After washing, antibody 
binding was revealed using goat antihuman IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson 
Immunoresearch). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates 
were read at 405 nm. Serum levels of human IgG in blood samples of infected mice was 
determined using a sandwhich ELISA specific for human IgG antibodies. ELISA plates 
were coated overnight at 4°C 5 μg/ml of goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific, mouse-adsorbed, 
antibodies (Southern Biotech). A standard based on the spiked-in mAb used in the challenge

 study diluted in mouse serum was used to interpolate the concentration of human mAbs in 
mouse sera samples. Plates were blocked with a 1% w/v solution of Bovine Serum Albumin 
(BSA; Sigma) in PBS, incubated with serial dilutions of sera samples for 1.5 hr at room 
temperature. After washing, human IgG levels were revealed using goat anti-human IgG Fc-
specific (mouse-adsorbed) antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech). 
Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 
nm.
Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding properties of the complexes between mAbs 
IgG or Fab and DIII (wild-type and mutants) or E protein were determined at 25°C with a 
ProteOn XPR-36 instrument (Bio-Rad). The antibodies were immobilized on the surface of 
a GLM sensor chip through standard amine coupling. Serial dilution of DIII and E-protein in 
the nanomolar range were injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min (contact time 4 minutes); 
dissociation was followed for 10 min. Analyte responses were corrected for responses from 
buffer-only injection both on a channel with antibody immobilized and on a channel with no 
antibody immobilized. Curve fitting and data analysis were performed with Bio-Rad 
ProteOn Manager software (version 3.1.0.6).
NMR spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz NMR 
spectrometer at 300 K. For assignments of backbone resonances standard triple resonance 
experiments (HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CACB, HNCACB were used, while sidechains 
were annotated using HCCH-TOCSY and HBHA(CO)NH experiments. All NMR 
experiments were processed using Topspin 2.1 (Bruker Biospin) and analysed with CARA. 
NOESY cross peaks were automatically assigned using the CYANA “noeassign” macro 
based on the manually assigned chemical shifts. Upper-distance restraints used for the 
structure calculations in CYANA using the standard simulated annealing protocol were 
derived from 70 ms 15N- and 13C-resolved NOESY spectra.
Backbone dynamics of ZIKV DIII were derived from 15N relaxation measurements recorded 
on 600 and 700 MHz spectrometers. Proton-detected versions of the CPMG (R2), inversion-
recovery (R1) and 15N{1H}-steady-state NOE were utilized.
Delay settings for the T2 series were in the range of 0 to 0.25 sec and for the T1 series 
between 0.02 to 2 sec. The 15N{1H}-NOE experiment used a relaxation delay of 5 s. The R1 
and R2 relaxation rates were derived from least-squares fits of corresponding exponential 
functions to the measured data using home-written scripts. The relaxation data were 
analyzed in a model-free approach using the software package DYNAMICS. The program 
ROTDIF was used to calculate the overall correlation time from the relaxation data (8.5 ns). 
NMR epitope mapping was performed as previously described (Bardelli et al., 2015; 
Simonelli et al., 2010; 2013). Briefly, overlay of N-HSQC spectra of labelled DIII free or 
bound to ZKA190 Fab allowed identification of DIII residues whose NMR signal changed 
upon complex formation, indicating that they were affected by ZKA190 binding. Changes 
were identified by manual inspection and by the Chemical Shift Perturbation (CSP), 
CSP=((ΔδH)2 +(ΔδN/10)2)1/2. NMR samples were typically 800μM of [15N, 13C]-labeled 
DIII in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.0. Perdeuterated (nominally

 70%) 2H, 15N DIII samples were used for NMR epitope mapping with a DIII:ZKA190 Fab 
ratio of 1:1.1; DIII concentration was typically 0.4 mM.
Antibody modelling, computational docking and Molecular Dynamics 
simulations—The ZKA190, ZKA185 and ZKA230 variable fragments were modeled 
according to the canonical structure method with the program RosettaAntibody (Sircar et al., 
2009) as previously described (Pedotti et al., 2011). Ten models, mainly differing in the H3 
loop conformation, were generated and independently used for docking. For ZKA190, either 
the NMR calculated or X-ray derived structure of DIII (PDB 5JHM) was used for docking. 
Docking was performed using RosettaDock 2.3 as previously described (Simonelli et al., 
2010). In summary, each antibody model was independently docked to DIII. Among the 
thousands of computationally generated complexes, those in better agreement with NMR 
and cryoEM experimental data were selected and further refined by computational docking. 
Models were selected to maximize fit to the cryoEM density map and presence of NMR-
defined epitope residues at the computational interface in an iterative process. For ZKA185 
and ZKA230, four adjacent E protein monomers extract from the CryoEM structure of 
ZIKV were used for docking. The best solutions according to the algorithm were evaluated 
in terms of their agreement with the experimental data (MARMs) After refinement, selected 
models of all the three antibodies were subjected to a 100ns molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation to adjust the local geometry and verify that the structure was energetically stable. 
MD was performed with the AMBER package proteins were centered in a cubic box filled 
with TIP3P water model and 0.15M Na+Cl− ions using the ff14SB force field. After energy 
minimization and temperature and pressure equilibration of 100ps, 100ns MD simulations 
were performed. The trajectory files generated were analyzed after removal of periodic 
boundary conditions.
Modelling of ZKA190 full IgG bound to the viral surface—A homology model of 
ZKA190 full IgG was generated using the x-ray structure of a full IgG1 (PDB 1HZH) as 
template. Analysis of the cryo-EM, NMR and docking data showed that adjacent ZKA190 
Fab binding sites on the viral surface are likely compatible with distances and orientation of 
the two arms of a full IgG; a pair on the 3-fold (~60 Å) and one on the 5-fold vertex (~56Å) 
(Figure 3B). Models of the full IgG were aligned with the Fabs on these binding sites and 
restrained molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate atomistic models of the 
full antibody bridging across two E proteins on the viral surface. A 1ns simulation with 
restraints on the distance between the two Fabs of the full IgG was first performed to allow 
movement of the two arms into an appropriate orientation. Another 1 ns simulation of 16641 
Cα distance restraints moved the arms in their final position. Finally, 10’000 steps of energy 
minimizations were performed. The final result shows good agreement to both cryo-EM and 
NMR data.
Confocal Microscopy—Vero cells were plated at 7,500 cells/well on 12 mm-diameter 
coverslips in 24-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were infected with ZIKV H/PF/
2013 (MOI of 100) in the presence or absence of neutralizing concentrations of Alexa 488 
conjugated mAbs (0.7 μM) at 37°C for 3 h, washed with PBS, and fixed with 2% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Acidified endosome were

 identified with Lysotracker red (Invitrogen) by adding the dye (50 nM) to the cells for the 
last 30 min of the incubation prior to fixation. Fixation was followed by extensive washes in 
PBS and 50 mM glycine and finally the coverslips were prepared for microscopy analysis 
using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). 
Samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope with a 
63×/1.4 N.A. objective. Image analysis and processing was performed with FIJI software.
Sequence analysis from ex vivo ZIKV samples—Envelop protein (E) sequences 
were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Zika Virus 
Variation Resource (Brister et al., 2014) as of November 24th, 2016. After aligning the 
protein sequences with Clustal Ω (Sievers et al., 2011) and purging the sequences that did 
not cover the DIII domain, 217 sequences were obtained. An amino acid distribution 
analysis was performed for each residue of the DIII protein sequences. The related 217 
nucleotide sequences of the E protein were retrieved and aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and 
Standley, 2013). The identical nucleotide sequences were collapsed into unique sequences 
(138 in total) and a phylogenic tree was derived by maximum-likelihood method 
(bootstrapped 1,000 times) using MEGA 7 software (Kumar et al., 2016).
MARMs selection—Two-thousands TCID50 of H/PF/2013 ZIKV in 500 μl were 
incubated with 250 μl containing varying concentrations of mAb (8 different concentrations, 
starting with a final concentration of 200 μg/ml and performing serial 1:4 dilutions). The 
mixture was incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C, followed by the addition of 250 μl of a Vero 
cells suspension (3.2 × 106 cells) and an incubation in a 24 well plate for three-four days at 
37°C to allow virus propagation to occur. After each step of selection, 500 μl of supernatants 
from three conditions were selected: the lowest concentration of mAb at which full 
protection of the monolayer was observed, one concentration at which we observed a partial 
cytophatic effect (CPE) effect on the cell monolayer and one concentration at which 100% 
of the cell monolayer was destroyed by the ZIKV CPE. The tube was spun down for 5 min 
at 1000 × g, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Half of the volume was again pre-mixed with 
varying concentrations of mAb to repeat the selection and propagation process. The 
remaining supernatant was used for micro-neutralization assays and subsequent sequencing 
of the virus.
Sequencing of MARMs virus—To identify the escape mutations of the selected 
MARMs virus, a genomic RNA extraction was done followed by a one-step-PCR to amplify 
and sequence the ZIKV E protein amplicon. Cell supernatant (140 μl) from the MARMs 
selection was used for RNA extraction with the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). 
cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed together using the SuperScript III 
One-Step RT-PCR with Platinium Taq (Invitrogen). For one reaction 25 μl reaction mix, 8 μl 
sterile water, 2 μM of each primer, 1 μl RNAse out (Life Technologies), 2 μl Superscript III 
RT/Platinum TaqMix and 12 μl RNA were used giving a final reaction volume of 50 μl. For 
the E protein N-terminal part, the primer pair Zika-E-F1 5′-
TGCAAACGCGGTCGCAAACCTGGTTG-3′ and ZIKV-E-R1 5′-
CGTGCCAAGGTAATGGAATGTCGTG-3′ and for the C-terminal part the primer pair 
ZIKV-E- f1530 5′-AGCCTAGGACTTGATTGTGAACCGA-3′ and ZIKV-E-R2769 5′-

 TTACAGATCCCACAACGACCGTCAG-3′ were used. The cycling conditions were 54°C 
for 40 min, 94°C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 45 s and 68°C 
for 1.5 min with a final elongation step at 68°C for 5 min and a final cooling step at 4°C. 
The PCR products were analyzed and extracted from a 1.5 % agarose gel and further 
purified with the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (GE Healthcare). For the 
sequencing reaction 8 μl of purified PCR product was mixed with 2 μM primer in a final 
volume of 10 μl and sent for sequencing (Microsynth). E protein N-terminal products were 
sequenced with ZIKV-E-F2 5′-ACTTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC-3′ and ZIKV-E-R2 
5′-TCGGTTCACAATCAAGTCCTAGGCT-3′, C-terminal PCR products with ZIKV-E-
f2058 5′-GCTAACCCCGTAATCACTGAAAGCA-3′ and ZIKV-E-r2248 5′-
AAGACTGCCATTCTCTTGGCACCTC-3′. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using 
CLC Main Workbench software (CLC Bio, version 5).
ZIKV infection of A129 mice—ZIKV infection studies were conducted in the 
laboratories of Public Health England (PHE), UK. Female A129 mice (IFN-alpha/beta 
receptor −/−) aged 5–8 weeks were supplied from a UK approved breeding colony (B&K 
Universal Ltd, UK). All procedures with animals were undertaken according to the United 
Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. These studies were approved by the 
ethical review process of Public Health England, Porton Down, UK and the Home Office, 
UK via an Establishment Licence (PEL PCD 70/1707) and project Licence (30/2906). PHE 
has Animal Welfare Assurance that has been reviewed and approved by the Office of 
Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) — ref #A5560-01. Humane endpoints were defined as 
20% weight loss, neurological signs or immobility. When any of these endpoints were 
reached, animals were culled to prevent unnecessary suffering.
Assessment of prophylactic and therapeutic activity of ZKA190 and FIT-1 in 
A129 mice—Mice were administered mAbs (ZKA190, ZKA190-LALA and MPE8) 
diluted in PBS at different doses via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route in a volume of 500 μl. 
MAbs were administered either 1 day before or 1, 2, 3 or 4 days after virus challenge. 
Animals were challenged subcutaneously with 10 pfu ZIKV (strain MP 1751) and followed 
for 14 days. Weights and temperatures were monitored daily and clinical observations were 
recorded at least twice per day. On day 5 post-challenge, 50 μl of blood was collected from 
each animal into a RNAprotect tube (QIAGEN,UK) and frozen at −80°C. At the end of the 
study (14 days post-challenge) or when animals met human endpoints, necropsies were 
undertaken, and blood and sections of brain, spleen, liver, kidney and ovary were collected 
for virological analysis.
Assessment of prophylactic activity of ZKA190 in AG129 mice—To test whether 
ZKA190 was capable of inducing ADE of ZIKV infection in vivo, 4- to 6-week-old AG129 
mice lacking the interferon α/β and γ receptors (van den Broek et al., 1995) were used to 
test low doses of mAb prior to challenge. Animals were bred at the University of California, 
Berkeley, and all experimental procedures involving the use of AG129 mice were pre-
approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of University of California, Berkeley. Mice were injected intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) with antibodies or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a total volume of 100 μl and then

 infected 20–24 hr later with 103 focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV strain Nica 2–16 
(Tabata et al., 2016) in a 50-μl volume by subcutaneous (s.c.) foot pad injection. Mice were 
monitored over a 15-day period post-infection; body weight was recorded daily, and 
morbidity was scored using a standardized 5-point system (Orozco et al., 2012). Mice were 
euthanized if they lost more than 20% of their initial weight and/or if they progressed to 
stage 5 on the morbidity scale (moribund, consistent with partial paralysis and neurological 
symptoms).
Viral load quantification from AG129 ZIKV infected mice—Blood samples from 
ZIKV-infected mice or controls were collected from the facial (submandibular) vein of 
anesthetized mice on days 3 and 6 post-infection. Blood specimens were allowed to clot at 
room temperature, and serum was separated by centrifugation. ZIKV RNA was extracted 
from serum samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), and RNA levels were 
determined by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) using a 
standard curve with 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV Nica 2–16 RNA. Primer sets used for this 
assay: ZIKV_1086_Fwd, 5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′, ZIKV_1162c_Rev, 5′- 
CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′; Probe ZIKV_1107-FAM_UG&Nica 5′- 
AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAATCAGACACTCAA-3′ (Lanciotti et al., 2008).
Viral load quantification from A129 ZIKV infected mice—Tissue samples from 
A129 mice were weighed and homogenized into PBS using ceramic beads and an automated 
homogenizer (Precellys, UK) using six 5 s cycles of 6500 rpm with a 30 s gap. Two hundred 
μl of tissue homogenate or blood solution was transferred into 600 μL RLT buffer (Qiagen, 
UK) for RNA extraction using the RNeasy Mini extraction kit (Qiagen, UK); samples were 
passed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen, UK) as an initial step. A ZIKV specific realtime RT-
PCR assay was utilized for the detection of viral RNA from subject animals. The primer and 
probe sequences were adopted from a published method (52) with in-house optimization and 
validation performed to provide optimal mastermix and cycling conditions. Real-time RT-
PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit (Life 
Technologies, UK). The final mastermix (15 μl) was comprised of 10 μl of 2× Reaction Mix, 
1.2 μl of PCR-grade water, 0.2 μl of 50 mM MgSO4, 1 μl of each primer (ZIKV 1086 and 
ZIKV 1162c both at 18 μM working concentration), 0.8 μl of probe (ZIKV 1107-FAM at 25 
μM working concentration) and 0.8 μl of SSIII enzyme mix. Five μl of template RNA was 
added to the mastermix, yielding a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The cycling conditions 
used were 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 
60°C for 40 s, plus a final cooling step of 40°C for 30 s. Quantification analysis using 
fluorescence was performed at the end of each 60°C step. Reactions were run and analyzed 
on the 7500 Fast platform (Life Technologies, UK) using 7500 software version 2.0.6. 
Quantification of viral load in samples was performed using a dilution series of quantified 
RNA oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies). The oligonucleotide comprised the 77 
bases of ZIKV RNA targeted by the assay, based on GenBank accession AY632535.2 and 
was synthesized to a scale of 250 nmole with HPLC purification.
DIII coding region sequencing from biological samples—For each sample, an 
attempt was made to reverse-transcribe and amplify the whole genome using the v2

 amplicon sequencing protocol kindly supplied by J. Quick and N. Loman of the Zibra 
project (Faria et al., 2016) (www.zibraproject.org/data/
amplicon_sequencing_protocol_v2.pdf). The two amplicon pools produced for each sample 
were quantified using the dsDNA HS assay (Life Technologies) and combined, before 1 ug 
of DNA was used as input to the EXP-NBD002 barcoding kit with barcodes NB01–NB09. 
Samples 1–9 and 10–18 were pooled separately and two sequencing libraries produced using 
the SQK-NSK007 kit. Each library was sequenced using a FLO-MIN105 Flow cell on a 
MinION Mk1B device and base calling was performed using the Metrichor workflow “2D 
Basecalling plus Barcoding for FLO-MIN105 250bps” (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 
Between 3989 and 12801 2D reads were generated per sample. FastQ data from 2D reads 
was extracted using poretools (Loman and Quinlan, 2014) and mapped using BWA-MEM 
(Li and Durbin, 2009) to the sequence of the original MP1741 stock used in this study 
(Genbank KY288905). Coverage across the genome varied due to differences in 
amplification efficiency between amplicons, but mean coverage of the DIII coding region 
was greater than 60-fold (range 64-fold to 410-fold) for all samples other than 14 and 16, 
which were not included for further analysis. The align_trim.py script from the 
Zibraproject.org pipeline (https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline, branch master, 
commit ID a4364fa8901b06d6d8bd058c19acd2c5e780179e) was used with an MP1741 
adapted BED file of primer binding sites to trim primer sequences from the mapped reads. 
Samtools (Li et al., 2009) was used to covert the trimmed SAM file to a sorted and indexed 
BAM which was used as input along with FAST5 files for nanopolish v0.5 variants module 
(Loman et al., 2015) (Quick et al., 2016) (https://github.com/jts/nanopolish, branch master, 
commit ID 6406f78c01d05f968bc841c03e4ccb4ea208677a) to identify SNPs that met 
minimum criteria of read depth 20, support fraction 0.75 and minimum quality value of 200.
Virus sample preparation for cryoEM studies—Aedes albopitus C6/36 cells (ATCC) 
were propagated in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 29°C. 
The cells were inoculated with ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (Baronti et al., 2014) at a MOI of 0.5 
and incubated at 29°C with 2% of fetal bovine serum. The virus containing media were 
harvested 4 days post-infection and clarified from cell debris by centrifugation. The 
supernatant was then precipitated by 8% of polyethylene glycol 8000 in NTE buffer (12mM 
Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) overnight at 4°C and pelleted by centrifugation at 
14,000 g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in NTE buffer and further 
purified through a 24% (w/v) sucrose cushion followed by a 10–30% (w/v) potassium 
tartrate density gradient. The virus band in the gradient was then extracted and buffer 
exchanged into NTE buffer and concentrated using a concentrator with 100-kDa molecular 
weight cut-off filter. The concentration of the virus was estimated by comparing the viral E 
protein band with bovine serum albumin at known concentrations as standard in a 
Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE.
CryoEM sample preparation—For preparation of the antibody-virus complex for 
cryoEM imaging, an excessive amount of recombinant Fab fragment of ZKA190 was added 
to the purified ZIKV to achieve a molar ratio of three Fab molecules for two E proteins. The 
complexes were incubated at 4, 37 and 40°C for 30 min, respectively. To prepare the 
cryoEM grids, 2.3 μl of sample was applied to a lacey copper grid with a thin carbon film,

 blotted for 1 s with an FEI Vitrobot in 100% humidity and then plunged into liquid ethane. 
The frozen grids were kept in liquid nitrogen before imaging.
CryoEM data collection and image processing—CryoEM images of the frozen 
ZKA190 Fab:ZIKV complexes were collected on a Titan Krios (FEI) microscope equipped 
with 300 kV field emission gun. Leginon was used for automated data collection (Carragher 
et al., 2000). The magnification was 81,871, giving a pixel size of 1.71 Å. The images were 
recorded in single image mode on Falcon II direct electron detector (FEI) with a total dose 
of 20 e−Å−2. The images were taken at underfocus range between 1.0 and 3.5 μm. A total of 
902 and 738 micrographs were collected for ZKA190 Fab:ZIKV complexes at 4°C and 
37°C, respectively. The astigmatic defocus parameters were estimated using ctffind3 
(Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003) and used in orientation search and 3D reconstruction in 
Relion (Scheres, 2012). Particles were picked using Relion template-based autopicking 
program, visually examined to discard nonviral particles, and subsequently subjected to 
Relion 2D classification to produce 2D class averages. Classes containing junks and broken 
particles were excluded from further processing. In total, 10,641 and 6,728 particles in the 
ZKA190Fab:ZIKV complex samples that were incubated at 4°C and 37°C were selected for 
further processing. The 3D orientation search and reconstruction was done with icosahedral 
symmetry using Relion auto-refine procedure, where two models are refined independently 
for two random halves of the data to prevent over-fitting (Scheres, 2012). The mature ZIKV 
map (EMDB: EMD-8139) was filtered to 60 Å and used as the starting model. The 3D 
refinement produced structures with resolutions of 22 Å for both complexes at Fourier shell 
correlation (FSC) cut-off of 0.5.
Model fitting—As the E protein raft was intact (Figure S4A), the cryoEM map was first 
interpreted by fitting in the E protein dimers using the “fit-in-map” in Chimera (Pettersen et 
al., 2004). We tried fitting the E protein densities of both ZKA190 Fab:ZIKV complex 
cryoEM maps at 4°C and 37°C by using either the uncomplexed ZIKV (PDB 5IZ7) or the 
crystal structure of the ZIKV E protein dimers (PDB 5JHM). The crystal structure of the 
ZIKV E protein dimer fits better to the raft density than that of the cryoEM uncomplexed 
ZIKV. The difference between the cryoEM ZIKV E protein dimer structure and the crystal 
structure of ZIKV E ectodomain is in the DI–DII hinge angle. In the uncomplexed ZIKV 
cryoEM structure, the DI–DII hinge is fixed at a certain angle because its ectodomain 
interacts with the membrane associated stem regions of E and M proteins on the virus. 
However, in the ZKA190 Fab:ZIKV structure, the E protein raft is lifted up, as observed by 
the separation of the E protein shell density from the viral lipid bilayer membrane (Figure 
2E). This may explain why the crystal structure of recombinant E protein fits better to the 
cryoEM density map of the complex. We then fitted the variable and constant domains of the 
Fab ZKA190 homology model into their corresponding densities above the DIII of E protein 
molecule C around the 3-fold vertex, as this density shows the best shape for the Fab (Figure 
S4A). The fitted molecule C and ZKA190 Fab were then locked and this E protein-ZKA190 
Fab complex was superimposed as a rigid body to E molecules A and B, respectively. These 
Fab molecules correlated well with their corresponding densities. Slight adjustment of the 
positions of the Fab above molecules A and B was done to further optimize the fit (Figure 
S4A). No crashes between the symmetry related molecules were detected.

highest protrusion at the 5-fold vertex. (F) CryoEM structure of ZIKV:ZKA190 Fab 
complex. The DIIIs of all E proteins are bound by Fabs (green). E proteins in an asymmetric 
unit are labelled A, B and C, and the neighboring asymmetric unit within a raft A′, B′ and 
C′. DI, DII and DIII are colored in red, yellow and blue, respectively. (G) E proteins at the 
5-fold vertices move apart upon Fab ZKA190 binding. (Left) Superposition of the Fab 
ZKA190:E complex onto the uncomplexed ZIKV shows clashes between the Fabs. (Right) 
In contrast, no clashes are observed in the cryoEM complex structure. E proteins are in gray 
and Fabs are colored. (H) Superposition of the E protein raft in the free (gray) and ZKA190-
complexed (colors) ZIKV; the curvature flattens in the complex structure. E proteins of one 
asymmetric unit (A, B and C) are in red, yellow and blue; those from another unit are in 
pink. (I) The rafts separate from each other in the complex (right) compared to the 
uncomplexed ZIKV structure (left). The inter-raft interface is indicated with a green dotted 
line, and the gap between rafts is indicated with an arrow.

 Figure 3. ZKA190 Aggregates Virus at High Antibody:Virus Molar Ratios and Inhibits a Post-
Attachment Stage of Virus Infection
(A) Dynamic light scattering experiments measuring the hydrodynamic size of the virus 
complexes shows ZKA190 IgG aggregates ZIKV at IgG:virion molar ratio of ≥33:1. The 
neutralization activity of antibody correlates with the formation of virus-antibody 
aggregates. The neutralization is expressed as the log10-transformed fold-reduction of the 
virus titer compared to the virus-only control.
(B) ZKA190 Fab (green) is shown on the viral surface (gray). The close proximity (<86Å)

 indicates possible bivalent binding of IgG on the same virus particle. However, due to the 
orientation of the Fabs, only the sites (cyan dotted circles) around the 5-fold and the 3-fold 
vertices can accommodate bivalent binding of a full IgG.
(C) Molecular Dynamics (MD)-based atomic model of the full ZKA190 IgG (green) 
bridging across two neighboring E proteins on the viral surface (gray). For clarity, only one 
IgG binding is shown. Bivalent binding to other sites within these vertices is possible.
(D) Superposition of the MD-based full IgG model (green cartoon) on the cryoEM map 
(blue mesh) near the 3-fold vertex shows good fitting of the modelled Fabs to the cryoEM 
density.
(E) Neutralization test of ZIKV when ZKA190 is added pre- or post-attachment of virus to 
cells that were incubated at 4°C. Results show no difference in the neutralization profile.
(F) RT-PCR detecting the amount of virus remaining on cells when ZKA190 was added pre- 
and post- virus attachment to cells. When increasing concentrations of mAb were mixed 
with virus before attaching to cells (“pre-attach.”), there is a gradual increase in the amount 
of virus on cell surface, likely due to aggregation of virus. Addition of the mAb to virus that 
had already bound to cells (“post-attach.”) showed that the mAb is unable to strip the virus 
off the cell surface. Therefore, the mAb can also inhibit a post-attachment stage of the 
infection cycle.
(G) Confocal microscopy experiments. ZIKV incubated with a concentration exceeding 
10,000-fold the IC50 value of either ZKA190 Fab or full IgG were added to Vero cells. The 
ZIKV:antibody complex is detected inside the cells (green) and co-localizes with endosomes

 Figure 4. Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy of ZKA190
(A to D) ZKA190 is strongly protective against ZIKV infection when administered 
prophylactically to mice (A129 in (A) and AG129 in (C, D)) challenged with a lethal dose of 
ZIKV strain MP1745 (A, B) or Nica 2–16 (C, D). Experiments used N=4–8 mice per group. 
(A, C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown. Significance was determined using the 
Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Panel A: ZKA190 at 5, 1 and 0.2 mg/kg versus Ctr mAb, P = 
0.0031; ZKA190 at 0.04 mg/kg versus Ctr mAb, P = 0.0116; ZKA190-LALA at 5, 1, 0.2 
and 0.04 mg/kg versus Ctr mAb, P = 0.0031. Panels C: ZKA190 and ZKA190 LALA at 1

ZKA190-LALA at 0.04 mg/kg versus Ctr mAb, P = 0.0142. (B, D) Morbidity score of mice 
monitored over a 14–15 day period (two different scoring methods were used; see (Dowall et 
al., 2016) for (B) and (Orozco et al., 2012) for panel D). Control mAb is MPE8 mAb (A, 
specific for RSV F protein (Corti et al., 2013)) and a human IgG polyclonal isotype control 
(C).
(E – G) ZKA190 or ZKA190-LALA were administered at 15 mg/kg at different time-points 
after ZIKV infection to A129 mice challenged with a lethal dose of ZIKV strain MP1745. 
(E) A Kaplan-Meier survival curve is shown. Experiments used N=5 mice per group. 
Significance was determined by using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. ZKA190 and ZKA190-
LALA administered on day 1, 2, 3 or 4 versus Ctr., P = 0.0016. (F) Morbidity score of mice 
monitored over a 14-day period according to (Dowall et al., 2016). (G) Mice were monitored 
over a 14-day period for body weight loss. Control mAb is MPE8 specific for RSV F protein 
(Corti et al., 2013).
Data in (B), (D) and (F) are represented as mean ± SEM for each determination. Data in (G) 
are represented as mean ±SD for each determination. See also Figures S5 and S6.

 Figure 6. Therapeutic efficacy of FIT-1
FIT-1 is strongly effective against ZIKV infection when administered therapeutically at 
different time-points to mice (A129) challenged with a lethal dose of ZIKV strain MP17451. 
Experiments used N=5–6 mice per group.
(A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown. Significance was determined by using the 
Mantel-Cox log-rank test. FIT-1 at 15, 5 and 1 mg/kg given either on day 1 or 2 versus Ctr 
mAb, P = 0.0012; ZKA190 at 15 and 5 mg/kg given on day 3 versus Ctr mAb, P = 0.0012; 
ZKA190 at 1 mg/kg given on day 3 versus Ctr mAb, P = 0.0170.
(B) Morbidity score of mice monitored over a 21-day period (Dowall et al., 2016).
(C) Viral load was measured as PFUs on day 5 in blood of all animals.
(D) Mice were monitored over a 21-day period for body weight loss. Control mAb in (A) is 
MPE8 mAb (specific for RSV F protein (Corti et al., 2013)).
(E) Viral load was measured as genomic copies by qPCR on day 5 in blood of all animals 
and in blood and indicated tissues when animals were culled at the end of the study or when 
the humane endpoints were met. Significance was determined compared to control antibody 
treatment by nonparametric unpaired Mann-Whitney U test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.

 Figure 7. Comparison of ZKA190 to other DIII lateral ridge antibodies
(A) Superposition of the structures of the Fabs E16 (orange, PDB 1ZTX), E106 (cyan, PDB 
4L5F), ZV23 (blue, PDB 5GZR) and ZK67 (purple, PDB 5KVG) onto DIII of ZKA190-E 
protein cryoEM structure.
(B) Fv regions of ZKA190, E106, ZV23 and ZV67 (colors as indicated) over the ZIKV 
surface, obtained by superimposing their structural complex with DIII to E protein on the 
viral surface (white surface, the 5-fold vertex is shown). All mAbs, but not ZKA190, clashes 
with adjacent E proteins when superimposed onto molecule A near the 5-fold vertex.
