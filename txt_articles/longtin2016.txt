IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of health care–associated
infection worldwide, and new preventive strategies are urgently needed. Current control
measures do not target asymptomatic carriers, despite evidence that they can contaminate
the hospital environment and health care workers’hands and potentially transmit C difficile
to other patients.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of detecting and isolating C difficile asymptomatic
carriers at hospital admission on the incidence of health care–associated CDI (HA-CDI).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a controlled quasi-experimental study
between November 19, 2013, and March 7, 2015, in a Canadian acute care facility. Admission
screening was conducted by detecting the tcdB gene by polymerase chain reaction on a rectal
swab. Carriers were placed under contact isolation precautions during their hospitalization.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in HA-CDI incidence level and trend during the
intervention period (17 periods of 4 weeks each) were compared with the preintervention
control period (120 periods of 4 weeks each) by segmented regression analysis and
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling. Concomitant changes in the
aggregated HA-CDI incidence at other institutions in Québec City, Québec (n = 6) and the
province of Québec (n = 94) were also examined.
RESULTS Overall, 7599 of 8218 (92.5%) eligible patients were screened, among whom
368 (4.8%) were identified as C difficile carriers. During the intervention, 38 patients
(3.0 per 10 000 patient-days) developed an HA-CDI compared with 416 patients (6.9 per
10 000 patient-days) during the preintervention control period (P < .001). There was no
immediate change in the level of HA-CDIs on implementation (P = .92), but there was a
significant decrease in trend over time of 7% per 4-week period (rate ratio, 0.93; 95% CI,
0.87-0.99 per period; P = .02). ARIMA modeling also detected a significant effect of the
intervention, represented by a gradual progressive decrease in the HA-CDI time series by
an overall magnitude of 7.2 HA-CDIs per 10 000 patient-days. We estimated that the
intervention had prevented 63 of the 101 (62.4%) expected cases. By contrast, no significant
decrease in HA-CDI rates occurred in the control groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Detecting and isolating C difficile carriers was associated with
a significant decrease in the incidence of HA-CDI. If confirmed in subsequent studies, this
strategy could help prevent HA-CDI.

C
lostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause symp-
tomsrangingfrommilddiarrheatolife-threateningtoxic
megacolon and has become the leading cause of health
care–associated infection in the United States.1-3 Approxi-
mately half a million cases occur each year in the United States,
causing 29 000 deaths and generating $4.8 billion in excess
medical costs.2 An increase in CDI incidence occurred in the
early 2000s owing to the emergence of the North American
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type 1 (NAP1) strain.4-7
Infection control measures were intensified in response to the
epidemic, with partial success.8
Current infection control recommendations focus mainly
onpatientswithCDI.9,10However,Cdifficileasymptomaticcar-
riers may also have a role in spore dissemination11 for several
reasons: they outnumber patients with CDI,12-14 they can con-
taminate the environment and caregivers’hands,12,15 and they
are not detected and thus are not placed under isolation
precautions.16 Still, present guidelines do not recommend
screening and isolating asymptomatic carriers, mainly be-
cause, to our knowledge, there has been no published study
to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy and because there
is a shortage of private rooms in many hospitals.9,10
The Québec Heart and Lung Institute (QHLI) is a 354-bed
Canadian tertiary institution in Québec City, Québec. Despite
significant efforts to control CDI, the institution has remained
endemic for CDI, with health care–associated CDI (HA-CDI)
rates frequently exceeding the government-imposed target of
9.0 per 10 000 patient-days. Many cases of HA-CDI were
thoughttobeattributabletocross-contaminationfromasymp-
tomatic carriers.12,14,17 Consequently, the executive commit-
tee of the QHLI endorsed a policy to detect and isolate asymp-
tomatic carriers in October 2013. The present study reports the
effect of this strategy on the incidence of HA-CDI.
Methods
Setting and Population
We used a quasi-experimental design and conducted a time
series analysis to evaluate the effect of the intervention.18 The
study population included all patients admitted between Au-
gust 22, 2004, and March 7, 2015. Incidence rates were com-
puted as the number of HA-CDI cases divided by the number
of patient-days per 4-week period, as recommended by the
mandatory Québec CDI surveillance program.19-21
Ethical and Methodological Considerations
TheinstitutionalresearchethicscommitteeoftheQHLIapproved
theextractionofdataforanalysis.Onlyaggregated,anonymized
data collected as per Accreditation Canada requirements were
extracted. This report follows the Outbreak Reports and Inter-
ventionStudiesofNosocomialInfection(ORION)statementfor

Definitions
Clostridiumdifficileinfectionwasdefinedas(1)diarrhea(≥3un-
formedorliquidstoolsin<24hours)lastingatleast24hourswith-
out any other known etiology, combined with a positive assay
for toxigenic C difficile; (2) visualization of pseudomembranes

categorized as health care-associated if symptoms appeared at
least72hoursafteradmissionandupto4weeksafterdischarge.
Cases in which the patient had consulted an ambulatory clinic
intheprevious4weekswereconsideredambulatorycareasso-
ciated. Cases in which the patient developed symptoms within
72 hours of admission, but with no history of a hospitalization
or ambulatory care visit in the previous 4 weeks, were consid-
ered community acquired. Asymptomatic patients with a posi-
tive C difficile admission screening test result were defined as
asymptomaticcarriers.Surveillancewasconductedprospectively
by infection control practitioners.
CDI Infection Control Measures
Patients with CDI were placed under contact isolation precau-
tions (eBox in the Supplement).9 Patients with diarrhea were
isolated empirically, pending confirmation of the diagnosis.
Since April 2011, isolation precautions are maintained until
discharge.23 Before this date, precautions were lifted 72 hours
after resolution of symptoms.
Intervention
Starting November 19, 2013, patients admitted through the
emergency department were screened for C difficile carriage.
Short-staypatients(<24hours)wereexcludedbecausetheywere
oftendischargedbeforethescreeningresultswereavailable.Pa-
tients admitted directly to the wards were also excluded be-
cause of logistical constraints. Identified carriers were placed
under infection control measures resembling those for CDI but
tailored to have minimal effect on bed management and work
flow (eBox in the Supplement). For example, health care work-
erswerenotrequiredtowearisolationgowns,andcarrierscould

There were no other planned changes in infection control mea-
sures during the intervention. No weekly or discharge screen-
ings of hospitalized patients were performed.

Key Points
Question Could the identification and isolation of Clostridium
difficile carriers on hospital admission help decrease the incidence
of health care–associated C difficile infections?
Findings In this quasi-experimental study that included
7599 patients over 15 months, the identification and isolation of
C difficile carriers was followed by a significant progressive
decrease in the incidence of hospital-associated C difficile
infections from 6.9 per 10 000 patient-days before the
intervention to 3.0 per 10 000 patient-days during the
intervention.
Meaning The identification and isolation of C difficile
asymptomatic carriers could help decrease the incidence of
C difficile infections in acute care hospitals.

Strain Typing of CDI Cases
The Québec Public Health Laboratory conducts a province-
wide surveillance of strains isolated from patients with HA-
CDI. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing is performed on
10 to 20 consecutive strains per hospital every year or every
other year, as described previously.20 Briefly, genomic DNA is
digested with SmaI restriction enzyme, and a PFGE system
(CHEF-DR III PFGE Systems; Bio-Rad) is used for
electrophoresis.26 The relatedness of the various isolates is de-
termined according to the criteria by Tenover et al27 and using
a software program (BioNumerics, version 6.5; Applied Maths
NV) by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
mean (UPGMA) clustering methodology using the Dice coef-
ficient with both position tolerance and optimization of 1.1%.
Outcomes
Change in the HA-CDI incidence rate per 10 000 patient-days
after implementation of the intervention at the QHLI was se-
lected as the main outcome. Changes in the HA-CDI inci-
denceratesfromotherinstitutionsthatparticipatedinCDIsur-
veillance during the same period were used as controls. Two
non–mutually exclusive control groups were created: (1) other
institutions in the Québec City area (n = 6) and (2) all other in-
stitutions in the province of Québec (n = 94). Changes in the
proportion of HA-CDI cases with complications and in strain
types causing CDI constituted secondary outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
First, aggregated data were analyzed for the entire study pe-
riod. The preintervention period was divided into an epi-
demic period (38 periods of 4 weeks each) and a postepi-
demic period (82 periods of 4 weeks each) to take into account
the NAP1 epidemic.21 The rates and proportions during the in-
tervention period were compared with the postepidemic pe-
riod by χ2 test and Fisher exact test, with normal approxima-
tion and square root transformation, as appropriate.
In a second step, we used 2 different methods to estimate
the effect of the intervention on the HA-CDI incidence time se-
ries at the QHLI and to estimate concomitant trends among the
control groups. Segmented regression of interrupted time se-
ries data was used to assess the effect of the intervention on
HA-CDIincidence,bothimmediately(changeinlevel)andover
time (change in trend) by creating indicator variables, as de-
scribed elsewhere.28 A trend and periodic seasonal terms were
appliedtotheentirestudyperiod(August2004toMarch2015),
in addition to indicator variables (see the Supplementary Sta-
tistical Analysis Methods in the Supplement for details). Also,
an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model
using the Box-Jenkins approach was fitted for the HA-CDI in-
cidence time series by using the standard approach of identi-
fication, estimation, and checking.29,30 An intervention analy-
sis was performed to assess the effect of the intervention on
the HA-CDI incidence time series (see the Supplementary Sta-
tistical Analysis Methods in the Supplement for details).29 The
introduction of the C difficile PCR assay to diagnose CDI was
taken into account in both statistical methods.
Finally, a separate ARIMA model built for the preinterven-
tion period was used to forecast the HA-CDI time series dur-
ing the intervention period. The number of HA-CDI cases pre-
vented by the intervention was estimated by calculating the
difference between the predicted number and the observed
number of cases.
To assess the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analy-
sis was performed that excluded the 2004 to 2007 epidemic
period. To analyze the effect of the intervention on C difficile
strains, the strains were grouped into NAP1 and non-NAP1
strains. Changes in the proportion of NAP1 strains during the
intervention were assessed by Fisher exact test.
Toaccountforpotentialconfounders,changesinlevelsand
trends in antimicrobial and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use
in defined daily dose31 per 1000 patient-days during the in-
tervention period were compared with the preceding 2 years
using segmented regression analysis. Hand hygiene compli-
ance rates before vs during the intervention were also com-
pared by χ2 test.
Statistical software (SAS, version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc)
was used for all analyses. P < .05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Before the intervention, 722 cases of HA-CDI were diagnosed
(Table 1). Preintervention HA-CDI incidence rates per 4-week
period at the QHLI ranged from 1.3 to 28.6 per 10 000 patient-
days, for an average of 8.2 per 10 000 patient-days (Figure 1).
Incidence rates during the epidemic and postepidemic peri-
ods preceding the intervention were 11.1 and 6.9 per 10 000
patient-days, respectively.
The intervention was implemented on November 19, 2013.
Over the following 17 periods of 4 weeks each, 7599 of 8218
(92.5%) eligible patients were screened. Of these patients, 368
(4.8%) were identified as asymptomatic carriers. Thirty-eight
cases of HA-CDI were diagnosed, for an incidence of 3.0 per
10 000 patient-days (P < .001 compared with the postepi-
demic period). There was a significant decrease in the propor-
tion of 4-week periods above target compared with the con-
trol period (0% vs 24.4%, P = .02). There was no significant
change in the incidence of community-acquired and ambula-
torycare–associatedCDIorintheproportionofcaseswithcom-
plications (P > .05 for all).

Segmented Regression Analysis
Before the intervention, HA-CDI incidence was slightly but sig-
nificantly decreasing at the QHLI by 0.4% per 4-week period
(rate ratio [RR], 0.996; P < .001), similar to other institutions
inQuébecCity(RR,0.996;P < .001).However,rateswerestable
in the province as a whole (P > .05) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The
intervention had no immediate effect on the HA-CDI level at
the QHLI (P = .92) but led to a significant decrease in trend by
7% per 4-week period (RR, 0.93 per period; P = .02). By con-
trast, an immediate increase in HA-CDI levels was observed in
theQuébecCitycontrolgroupatthetimeofinterventionimple-
mentation (RR, 1.44; P = .04). During the intervention pe-
riod, no significant changes in HA-CDI trends were observed
in the control groups.
ARIMA Modeling
Interventionanalysisdetectednoimmediateeffectoftheinter-
ventiononHA-CDIincidence.However,asignificanteffect,rep-
resented by a gradual progressive decrease in the HA-CDI time
seriesbyanoverallmagnitudeof7.2HA-CDIsper10000patient-
days, was detected by the end of the study period. The effect of
the intervention was represented by a gradual progressive de-
crease in HA-CDI incidence, taking the form ω0 / (1 − δ), where
ω0 = −0.0001044 (SE = 0.0001424) (P = .46) and δ = 0.86394
(SE = 0.30038)(P = .004).Mostofthedecrease(approximately
6.0 HA-CDIs per 10 000 patient-days) occurred during the first
half of the intervention. Using forecast modeling, the interven-
tion was estimated to have prevented 63 of the 101 (62.4%) ex-
pectedcasesofHA-CDI(Figure1).Bycontrast,nosignificantim-
mediate or gradual change in HA-CDI incidence was detected
among the control groups.
Sensitivity Analyses
The results of the sensitivity analyses that excluded the epi-
demic period were similar to those of the primary analyses.
There was no significant change in level, but a significant
change in trend (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .048) was de-
tected during the intervention by the segmented regression.
Also, a significant gradual decrease in rates was detected by
ARIMA modeling (ω0 = −0.0000676 [SE = 0.0000935]
[P = .47] and δ = 0.90693 [SE = 0.26453] [P < .001]).
Strain Analysis
Four hundred sixty-six strains were typed from 6 institu-
tions in Québec City between 2005 and 2014 (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). The proportion of HA-CDI due to NAP1 at
the QHLI was higher than that in other hospitals in 2005,
indicating that the institution was the first in the region to
be affected by the epidemic. The proportion of HA-CDI due
to NAP1 at the QHLI was comparable to the proportion found
in other hospitals between 2007 and 2013 (P > .05). How-
ever, a significant decrease in the proportion of NAP1 from
59.2% (45 of 76) before the intervention to 20.0% (2 of 10)
during the intervention was observed (P = .049). No con-
comitant decrease was observed at the other institutions in
Québec City (80% NAP1 in 2014).
Other Control Measures
A carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak oc-
curred on 2 wards between December 2014 and January 2015.
Contained single-ward outbreaks of influenza and viral gas-
troenteritis occurred in December 2014 and January 2015, re-
spectively. An increase in hand hygiene compliance was seen
during the intervention, from 36.6% (943 of 2580 opportuni-
ties) in 2013 to 49.7% (1465 of 2945 opportunities) in 2014
(P < .001).
Antibiotic and PPI Use
After implementation of the intervention, there was a signifi-
cant decrease in the use of anti–C difficile antibiotics (ie, oral
or intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin), fol-
lowed by a significant decrease in trend (RR, 0.97; P < .001)

Discussion
Clostridiumdifficileinfectionisaseriousproblem,andnewpre-
ventive strategies are urgently needed. In our study, detect-
ing and isolating asymptomatic carriers was associated with
a significant decrease in the HA-CDI incidence rate. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to assess the benefit of such
an intervention. In total, 121 patients needed to be screened
and 6 asymptomatic carriers needed to be isolated to prevent
oneHA-CDI.Theinterventionmaybeeffectivenotonlybypre-
venting direct patient-to-patient transmission but also by lim-
iting contamination of the hospital environment.12,15 The
gradual rather than immediate decrease in HA-CDI incidence
on implementation of the intervention may be due to the pres-
ence of spores lingering in the environment, combined with
their capacity to survive for extended periods.1 By contrast,
no decrease in trend was observed in the control groups, sug-
gesting that the decrease is not due to other regional or pro-
vincial phenomena. In fact, an increase in HA-CDI was ob-
served in both control groups in November 2013 (ie, on
implementation of the intervention at the QHLI) owing to
seasonality.19
The decrease in the proportion of CDI due to the NAP1
strain is surprising and should be considered exploratory. The
fact that the decrease occurred only at the QHLI suggests that
it is not a coincidence but rather a consequence of the inter-
vention. This observation was reported previously in an in-
terventiontocontrolanoutbreakintheUnitedKingdom,where
improving infection control measures had a greater effect on
NAP1 than on other strains.32 Other results also suggest that
C difficile strains may differ in their epidemiology and
transmissibility.17,33
The study has limitations. The intervention was con-
ducted in a single center. Further investigations (ultimately
cluster randomized trials) will be required to confirm our find-
ings. Still, our study was essential to justify the realization of
these more costly studies. To date, no commercial test is ap-
proved in Canada or the United States to detect asymptom-
atic carriers, and the optimal detection method is unknown.
Compliance with isolation precautions was not assessed, and
it was impossible to mask patients, caregivers, and investiga-
tors to the intervention. Despite standardized definitions,
knowledge of carrier status could have influenced the ascer-
tainment of HA-CDI cases. However, the gradual decrease in
HA-CDI over 15 months argues in favor of a true change in
C difficile hospital ecology rather than a change in case ascer-
tainment. Although global antimicrobial and PPI consump-
tion remained stable during the intervention, improvements
in the appropriateness of antimicrobial use could not be in-
vestigated and may have positively affected HA-CDI inci-
dence.Applicabilityofourfindingstosettingswithalowerpro-
portion of NAP1 is uncertain. Institutional hand hygiene
compliance increased during the intervention. Direct obser-
vation tends to overestimate compliance; hence, the magni-
tude of the increase may have been overestimated as well.
Many hospitals have reported similar increases, but, to our
knowledge, none have ever reported such an important con-
comitant reduction in CDI.34 Also, because 93% of hand hy-
giene at the QHLI is performed with an alcohol-based solu-
tion to which C difficile spores are resistant, it is unlikely that
such an improvement could have greatly interrupted
cross-transmission.34
It is possible that knowledge of carriage status may have
influenced antibiotic management among asymptomatic car-
riers and hence influenced the potential development of CDI.
Patient-level data were not available for analysis, and the pro-
portion of asymptomatic carriers who progressed to CDI is
unknown.35 Nevertheless, because the ultimate goal is to pre-
vent HA-CDI, this possibility would still support our main find-
ing, which is that identifying and isolating asymptomatic car-
riers is associated with a decrease in HA-CDI incidence.
Thestudyhasnumerousstrengths.Thestudyperiodspans
a decade. Prevalence of carriage on admission was similar to
thatinotherinvestigations,suggestingthatourscreeningstrat-
egy was adequate to identify carriers.17 Intrahospital and in-
terhospital comparisons were conducted to account for po-
tential confounders.24,36 The effect of the intervention was
measured using different statistical approaches that yielded
similarresults,indicativeoftheirrobustness.Althoughthepri-
mary outcome was unmasked, the significant decrease in anti-
CDI antibiotic use suggests that the decrease in HA-CDI is real.
The cost-benefit of this strategy is unknown, but prelimi-
nary estimates suggest that the intervention may be
cost-effective.37 The intervention cost US $130 000 over 17
periods and prevented approximately 63 cases. Because each
case costs US $3427 to $9960, the savings in averted CDI
(US $216 000 to $627 000) are greater than the costs of the
intervention.38
The effect of our findings is significant in many ways. The
magnitude of the decrease in HA-CDI incidence is substan-
tial. To put our results into perspective, the QHLI now has the
lowest HA-CDI incidence rates among 22 academic institu-
tions in the province of Québec. The intervention is simple and
could be easily implemented in other institutions. If con-
firmed in subsequent studies, isolating asymptomatic carri-
ers could potentially prevent thousands of cases of HA-CDI
every year in North America.
Conclusions
Implementing a protocol to identify and isolate C difficile
asymptomatic carriers was associated with a significant
decrease in the incidence of HA-CDI. Additional studies are
warranted to further investigate this promising strategy.
