Key points
r Fish oil (FO), rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, has beneficial effects on changes
induced by obesity and partially prevents associated comorbidities.
r The effects of FO on adipocytes from different adipose tissue depots in high-fat (HF) diet
induced obese mice have not been uninvestigated.
r This is the first study to examine the effects of FO on changes in metabolism and adipokine
production in adipocytes from S.C. (inguinal; ING) or visceral (retroperitoneal; RP) white
adipose depots in a HF diet-induced obese mice.
r Unlike most studies performed previously, FO supplementation was initiated 4 weeks before
the induction of obesity.
r HF diet caused marked changes in ING (glucose uptake and secretion of adiponectin, tumour
necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in ING) and RP (lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis and secretion
of pro-inflammatory cytokines) adipose depots.
r Previous and concomitant FO administration prevented the changes in ING and RP adipocytes
induced by the HF diet.
Abstract In the present study, we investigated the effect of fish oil (FO) on metabolism and
adipokine production by adipocytes from S.C. (inguinal; ING) and visceral (retroperitoneal; RP)
white adipose depots in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice. Mice were divided into CO
(control diet), CO+FO, HF and HF+FO groups. The HF group presented higher body weight,
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, higher plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels, and greater weights of ING and RP adipose depots accompanied by hypertrophy of the
adipocytes. FO exerted anti-obesogenic effects associated with beneficial effects on dyslipidaemia
and insulin resistance in mice fed a HF diet (HF+FO group). HF raised RP adipocyte lipolysis
and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced de novo synthesis of fatty acids,
whereas, in ING adipocytes, it decreased glucose uptake and adiponectin secretion but did not
change lipolysis. Therefore, the adipose depots play different roles in HF diet-induced insulin
resistance according to their location in the body. Concerning cytokine secretion, adipocytes per
se in addition to white adopise tissue infiltrated leukocytes have to be considered in the aetiology
of the comorbidities associated with obesity. Evidence is presented showing that previous and
concomitant administration of FO can prevent changes in metabolism and the secretion of
hormones and cytokines in ING and RP adipocytes induced by HF.

Introduction
Obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic
syndrome are associated with changes in metabolism
and the secretion of hormones and adipokines, such
as adiponectin, resistin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
and interleukin (IL)-6 in white adipose tissue (WAT)
(Smith & Minson, 2012; Bluher, 2013; Omatsu-Kanbe &
Matsuura, 2014). WAT plays a central role in control of
metabolism, either as endocrine organ or in increasing
and decreasing triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation (Flier,
2004; Girousse & Langin, 2012). There is variation in
metabolic and secretory activities, as well as in the pre-
disposition to certain diseases, according to the WAT
depot. Central/abdominal lipid accumulation has been
associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and
metabolic disorder. Adipocytes from the visceral adipose
depots show high lipolytic activity and fatty acid release
into the portal circulation, resulting in lipid accumulation
in the liver and metabolic syndrome (Dodson et al. 2014;
Kranendonk et al. 2015). The accumulation of lipids in the
S.C. adipose tissue depot does not lead to the same diseased
condition (Wajchenberg, 2000; Tran et al. 2008; Tchernof
& Despres, 2013; Kranendonk et al. 2015). This latter
adipose tissue depot shows lower metabolic activity with
lower macrophage infiltration and adipokine secretion
compared to visceral WAT (Harman-Boehm et al. 2007).
Two linked WAT processes play a key role for the
development of metabolic diseases: inflammation and
hypertrophy (Bjorndal et al. 2011). Changes in the activity
oflipogenesisandlipolysisdeterminethesizeofadipocytes
that vary according to the adipose tissue depots (Jensen,
1997). Expansion of WAT by enlargement of existing fat
cells leads to intense M1 macrophage infiltration. This has
been associated with restricted blood vessel development,
massive fibrosis (arising from hypoxia) (Sun et al.
2011), increased production of pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines and lower secretion of adiponectin, an important
anti-inflammatory and endogenous insulin sensitizer
adipokine (Weyer et al. 2001). The imbalance in the
production of some adipokines by WAT in obesity plays
an important role in triggering insulin resistance and the
development of associated disorders (Hotamisligil, 2006;
Rosen & Spiegelman, 2006; Bluher, 2013).
Administration of a high-fat (HF) diet in rodents is
a well-known experimental model for raising body mass
gainandpromotingfataccumulation(Yamadaetal.2013),
whereas fish oil (FO) supplementation reduces body fat in
these animals (Rokling-Andersen et al. 2009). FO is rich
in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC
n-3 PUFAs). LC n-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6),
have long been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and
to have potent anti-inflammatory, hypolipidaemic and
body weight (BW) reducing effects (Storlien et al. 1997;
Flachs et al. 2009; Serhan, 2014; Sundaram et al. 2015).
The most important source of EPA and DHA is marine
fish, such as salmon, sardines, tuna and mullet (Rustan
et al. 1993). Despite this information, there is no study
comparing the effects of FO on metabolism and adipokine
production by adipocytes from S.C. (inguinal; ING) and
visceral (retroperitoneal; RP) white adipose depots in HF
diet-induced obese mice. Unlike most studies performed
previously, in the present study, FO supplementation was
initiated 4 weeks before the induction of obesity. The
results obtained suggest that FO prevents the changes
in adipocyte metabolism and adipokine secretion (in a
depot-specific manner) induced by the HF diet.
Methods
Ethical approval
The present study was performed according to protocols
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal
University of S˜

control (low-fat) diet (CO); (ii) HF; (iii) control diet
supplemented with fish oil (CO+FO); and (iv) HF diet
supplemented with fish oil (HF+FO). During the first
4 weeks preceding the induction of obesity, the four
experimental groups were fed ad libitum with a control
diet (Table 1). At the same time, CO+FO and HF+FO
mice were supplemented with fish oil (n-3 PUFA source,
5:1 EPA/DHA ratio; HiOmega-3, Naturalis Nutric
¸˜
ao and
Farma Ltda, Sao Paulo, Brazil) by oral gavage at 2 g kg−1
BW, three times per week. FO was administered directly
into the stomach of mice using a gavage needle attached
to a syringe to deliver the oil (�40 ul, according to BW)
into the stomach. The CO and HF groups received water
by gavage at the same volume. The FO dosage was chosen
basedonpreviousstudiesfromourgroupandothersusing
differentoils(Foladoretal.2009;Masietal.2012;Hirabara
et al. 2013; Amaral et al. 2014). Considering the body
surface area for extrapolating the dose used in the present
studytohumans(Reagan-Shawetal.2008),fishoil2gkg−1
BW in mice is �162 mg kg−1 BW in humans (i.e. �11 g
for an individual weighing 70 kg, every 2 days). Human
studies reported a dose of 6 g of fish oil every day (Couet
et al. 1997; Amaral et al. 2014). Therefore, the dosage used
in the present study may be equivalent to human studies.
Experimental procedures
After the first 4 weeks, mice from the HF and HF+FO
groups received HF diet for 8 weeks. The CO and CO+FO
groups remained on the control diet. Supplementation
with FO was maintained until the end of 12 weeks. A
detailed composition of the diet and energy distribution
is provided in Table 1. BW and food intake were measured
three times a week from the fourth week onward. After
12 weeks of the experimental protocol, 6 h fasted mice
were anaesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cervical
dislocation after blood collection through puncturing
the orbital plexus. Blood samples were centrifuged at
1500 g for 20 min at 4°C and serum was stored
at–80°C.Adiposefatdepots(INGandRP)wereharvested,
weighed and processed as described below.
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests
Tolerance to glucose (GTT) or to insulin (ITT) was
evaluated after 6 h of fasting. For GTT, mice were I.P.
injected with glucose (2 g kg–1 BW). Blood glucose
measurements were performed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 or
90 min after glucose injection. Glucose concentration
vs. time was plotted and the area under the curve was
calculated for each animal. For ITT, animals were I.P.
injected with insulin (Humulin R; Lilly, Indianapolis,
IN, USA; 0.75 UI kg–1 BW) and glucose measurements
were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 min after
injection. Glucose concentration vs. time was plotted
and the glucose level lowering rate was calculated. In
both tests, blood samples were collected from the tail
vein. Sadler & Bailey (2013) validated a refined method
for repeated blood sampling (up to three times at 24 h
intervals) in juvenile and adult mice using the tail incision
to sample from the lateral tail vein. This method is not
stressful, as indicated by the low basal levels of the stress
hormone corticosterone. For GTT, the serum glucose
level was measured using a colorimetric assay (St. Lorant,
1957) available commercially (PAP Liquiform Glucose;
Diagnostics, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) as a result of the high
glycaemia levels reached during the test, whereas, for ITT,
glucose was determined using a glucometer (One Touch
Ultra; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA)
(Dean et al. 1981). The assays were always performed in
all groups concomitantly to avoid any interference in the
results obtained.
Adipocyte isolation
Adipocyteisolationwasperformedasdescribedpreviously
(Rodbel, 1964) with slight modifications (Bolsoni-Lopes
et al. 2013). A small number of adipocytes were
photographed under an optical microscope (100×
magnification) using a microscope camera (Moticam
1000; Motic, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada)
and the mean adipocyte diameter was determined by
measuring 50 cells using Motic-Images Plus, version 2.0
(Motic, Xiamen, China).

et al. 1982) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-
cholesterol levels (Grillo et al. 1981) were determined by
colorimetric assays (Labtest Diagnostics). Non-esterified
fatty acids (NEFA) were measured (Mackenzie et al.
1967)
using
the
HR
NEFA
series
kit
(Wako
Diagnostics, Richmond, VA, USA) in accordance with
the
manufacturer’s
instructions.
An
enzyme-linked
immmunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify
insulin (Lidofsky et al. 1981) (Millipore, St Charles,
MO, USA). The homeostatic model assessment- insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) index was calculated using the
formula: HOMA-IR = [glucose (nmol L–1) × insulin
(μU mL–1)/22.5], employing fasting values (Matthews
et al. 1985).
Lipolysis determination
Lipolysis was estimated as the rate of glycerol (Free
Glycerol Determination Kit; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
(Garland & Randle, 1962) released from ING and RP
adipocytes (1 × 106 cells mL–1) during 30 min of
incubation. A similar procedure was used in our previous
studies (Bolsoni-Lopes, 2013). The results are expressed
as nmol glycerol per 1 × 106 adipocytes.
Incorporation of [3H]-oleate into triacylglycerol
ING and RP adipocytes (106 cells mL–1) were incubated
in Krebs/Ringer/phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
BSA (1%), glucose (2 mM) and [3H]-oleate (100 μM,
1850 Bq per tube or well) for 2 h at 37°C in a water
bath. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture
was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube containing 400 μl of
silicone oil and centrifuged for 30 s. The cell pellet
on the top of the oil layer was transferred to poly-
propylene tubes containing 2.5 ml of Dole’s reagent for
lipid extraction. After addition of n-heptane (1.5 ml)
and distilled water (1.5 ml), tubes were vortexed and the
mixture decanted for 5 min. An aliquot of the upper phase
was collected into a scintillation vial for determination of
radioactivity trapped into TAG (1450 LSC, Couter Micro-
Beta, Trilux; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Results
are expressed as nmol of oleate incorporated into TAG per
1 × 106 cells h–1. A similar procedure was used in our
previous studies (Bolsoni-Lopes et al. 2013).
Incorporation of [1-14C]-acetate into fatty acids
ING and RP adipocytes (106 cells mL–1) were incubated in
Krebs/Ringer/phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing BSA
(1%), glucose (2 mM) and [1-14C]-acetate (1 mM, 1850
Bq per tube or well) for 2 h at 37°C in a water bath
and processed as described previously (Bolsoni-Lopes
et al. 2014). The results are expressed as nmol acetate
incorporated into TAG per 1 × 106 cells h–1. A
similar procedure was used in our previous studies
(Bolsoni-Lopes et al. 2014).
2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake
ING and RP adipocytes (1 × 106 cells mL–1) were
incubated with or without insulin (10 nmol l−1) in buffer
composedof(mM):140NaCl,20Hepes,5KCl,2.5MgSO4,
1 CaCl2 and BSA 1% (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 37°C.
Subsequently, 2-deoxy-D-[3H]-glucose (0.4 mmol l−1,
1850 Bq per tube or well) was added and the reaction
was allowed to occur for exactly 3 min. The reaction
was interrupted by adding 250 μl of ice-cold phloretin
(0.3 mmol l−1 in Earle’s salts, Hepes 10 mm, BSA 1%
and DMSO 0.05%). Two hundred microlitres of this final
mixture was layered in 200 μl of silicone oil (density
of 0.963 mg ml−1) in microfuge tubes and centrifuged
for 10 s at 11,000 g. The cell pellet on the top of the
oil layer was collected, transferred to vials containing
scintillation cocktail for radioactivity measurement (1450
LSC, Counter MicroBeta, Trilux; Perkin Elmer). The
results are expressed as pmol per 1 × 105 adipocytes.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA from ING and RP isolated adipocytes was
extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carslbad, CA, USA), analysed for quality on agarose gel
and absorbance ratios of 260/280 and 260/230 nm, and
reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript III
cDNA kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Gene expression
was evaluated by real-time qRT-PCR using a Rotor Gene
(Qiagen, Roermond, The Netherlands) and SYBR Green
as fluorescent dye (Qiagen). The reaction conditions were:
95°C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and
60°C for 10 s. PCR products were run on agarose gel
to confirm the size of the fragment and the specificity
of amplification. The primers used are: adiponectin
(5�- to 3� sense: GCAGAGATGGCACTCCTGGA; 5�- to
3� anti-sense: CCCTTCAGCTCCTGTCATTCC), TNF-α
(5�- to 3� sense: CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT; 5�-
to 3� anti-sense: GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG), IL-6
(5�- to 3� sense: TTCTCTGGGAAATCGTGGAAA; 5�- to
3� anti-sense: TCAGAATTGCCATTGCACAAC), Resistin
(5�- to 3� sense: AGACTGCTGTGCCTTCTGGG; 5�- to
3� anti-sense: CCCTCCTTTTCCTTTTCTTCCTTG) and
36B4 (5�- to 3� sense: TAAAGACTGGAGACAAGGTG; 5�-
to 3� anti-sense: GTGTACTCAGTCTCCACAGA). 36B4
was used as housekeeping. The results were obtained
as Ct values (Ct = cycle number at which logarithmic
PCR plots cross a calculated threshold line) and used
to determine �Ct values [�Ct = (Ct of the target
gene) – (Ct of the housekeeping gene). The results are
expressed as arbitrary units using the transformation:
Expression = 1000 × (2–�ct) arbitrary units.

Oral supplementation with FO (2 g kg–1 BW, three times a week, by oral gavage) or water was initiated 4 weeks before animals
received (or not) the HF diet and this was maintained until the end of the experiment. Animals were fed with either HF or CO for an
additional 8 weeks. Mean ± SEM (n = 9). Results were analysed by two-way ANOVA and a Bonferroni post hoc test. ∗P < 0.05 vs. CO
diet. †P < 0.05 vs. CO+FO diet.
Adipokine measurements
Isolated adipocytes (�8 × 105cells mL–1) were incubated
in a six-well culture plate in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s
medium
containing
10%
calf
serum
and
1% penicillin/streptozotocin at 37°C under a humid
atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 30 h. The final concentrations
of the adipokines IL-6, resistin, adiponectin and TNF-α
from the culture supernatant were determined using
specific commercially available DuoSet ELISA kits in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; catalogue numbers
DY406, DY1069, DY1119 and DY410, respectively). The
concentrations of the cytokines are expressed in ng or pg
(for TNF-α) per 106 cells as indicated.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA
and a Bonferroni post hoc test were used for comparisons
between groups. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was
used to calculate the correlation between adipocyte sizes
(ING and RP) and/or secretion of adipokines and/or
metabolic activity. Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software,
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for analysis. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Compared to the CO diet, mice fed with the HF diet pre-
sented a reduction (by 44%; P < 0.05) in food intake
but an increase (by 4-fold; P < 0.05) in fat intake,
whereas a slight reduction was observed in protein (by
9%)andcalorie(by10%)intake(datanotshown).Feeding
efficiency (ratio of BW gain and food consumption) and
energy efficiency (ratio of body mass gain and energy
consumption) were significantly increased (by 11- and
8-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) in the HF group. FO
softened the effects of the HF diet on these parameters
(Table 2).
BW gain during the 12 week period is shown in
Fig. 1A and B. In the first period (0–4 weeks), treatment
with FO did not affect BW gain. In the second period
(4–12 weeks), the HF group presented an increase (by
12-fold; P < 0.05) in BW gain compared to the CO diet
group. The supplementation with FO reduced, by 30%
(P < 0.05), the weight gain induced by HF diet, although
there was a greater BW gain (8-fold; P < 0.05) compared
to CO mice (Fig. 1B). There was a significant increase in
the mass of both ING and RP fat depots (by 77% and
133%, respectively; P < 0.05) in the HF group compared
to CO mice. The supplementation with FO partially pre-
vented this increase. Indeed, a reduction in the weights
of ING and RP tissues (by 20% and 31%, respectively;
P < 0.05) was found when FO+HF mice were compared
with HF (Fig. 1C and D). Despite this, however, the
weights of ING and RP fat depots remained higher in the
FO+HF group compared to CO mice. Mice consuming
the HF diet presented a significant hypertrophy of the
fat cells in both ING and RP fat depots (by 57% and
87%, respectively; P < 0.05) compared to the CO group.
Supplementation with FO attenuated this effect in ING
and completely prevented it in RP adipocytes (Fig. 1E
and F).
An increase in plasma total cholesterol (by 23%;
P < 0.05) and LDL cholesterol (by 33%; P < 0.05)
levels was observed in the HF group. FO prevented
these effects, leading to values even lower than those
of the CO group (by 23% and by 21%, respectively;
P < 0.05). FO per se also reduced these parameters (by
33% and by 40%, respectively; P < 0.05) in mice fed with
the CO diet (CO+FO group). Serum concentrations of
triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and free fatty acids (FFA)
were not changed by the HF diet or FO supplementation
(Table 3).
After glucose load, both groups receiving the HF diet
(HF and HF+FO) presented higher blood glucose levels
with an increase in the area under the curve (by 60%;
P < 0.05) (Fig. 2A and B). The HF group showed
a lower responsiveness to insulin and a lower glucose
disappearance rate (by 82%; P < 0.05) than the other
groups (Fig. 2C and D). FO prevented the development
of insulin intolerance but it did not change the response
to oral glucose loading. Obese mice (HF group) showed
an increase in fasted blood glucose and insulin levels (by
38% and 75%, respectively; P < 0.05). An increase in

HOMA-IR (by 169%; P < 0.05), which is indication of
insulin resistant state, was found in the HF group. FO
supplementation partially prevented the insulin resistance
induced by the HF diet because it reduced fasting blood
glucose and insulin levels, as well as the HOMA-IR
(Table 3).
Both ING and RP adipocytes isolated from animals
fed a HF diet showed increased incorporation of oleate
into TAG compared to the CO diet (by 201% and 89%,
respectively; P < 0.05) (Fig. 3A and B). The de novo
synthesis of FA from acetate in the ING depot was not
different between the groups but a significant reduction

Oral supplementation with FO (2 g kg–1 BW, three times a week, by oral gavage) or water was initiated 4 weeks before animals
received (or not) the HF diet and this was maintained until the end of the experiment. Animals were fed with either HF or CO for an
additional 8 weeks. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM of nine animals. Results were analysed by two-way ANOVA and a

(by30%;P<0.05)wasobservedinRPadipocytesfromthe
HF group. Supplementation with FO partially prevented
this decrease (Fig. 3C and D).
The lipolysis rate was not significantly different among
the groups (CO, CO+FO, HF, HF+FO) in ING adipocytes
(Fig. 3E and G). RP adipocytes showed a higher rate
of lipolysis compared to ING fat cells (by 5.5-fold;
P < 0.05). The HF group presented a significant increase
in lipolysis compared to CO mice (by 4-fold; P < 0.05).
FO supplementation abolished the effect of the HF diet on
this parameter in basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 3F
and H).
Glucose uptake by ING fat cells maximally stimulated
by insulin was significantly reduced in the HF group (by
64%; P < 0.05) compared to CO mice. FO prevented the
drop in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in HF fed mice
(Fig. 4A and C). There was no significant difference on
glucose uptake among the groups in RP cells (Fig. 4B
and D).
A significant reduction in mRNA expression of glucose
transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) in ING cells of the HF group
(by 61%; P < 0.05) was observed and FO supplementation
abolished this effect (Fig. 4E). In RP adipocytes, there were
no statistical differences between the groups, except for a
slight reduction of GLUT-4 expression in the HF+FO
compared to the FO group (Fig. 4F).
In RP adipocytes, TNF-α mRNA was significantly
increased (by 3-fold; P < 0.05) in the HF compared
to the CO group. This effect was prevented by FO
supplementation (Fig. 5B). The mRNA expression of
TNF-α in ING adipocytes and of IL-6, resistin and
adiponectin in both ING and RP fat cells was not changed
(Fig. 5A and C–H).
Mice fed the HF diet showed an increase (by 159%;
P < 0.05) in TNF-α secretion by ING cells compared
to the CO group. This increase was partially prevented
(by 48%; P < 0.05) by FO supplementation (Fig. 6A).
The secretion of IL-6 and resistin was higher in RP
compared to ING adipocytes (Fig. 6B–E). The HF diet
increased the secretion of IL-6 in RP adipocytes that was
prevented by FO (Fig. 6C). Changes were not observed
among the groups with respect to the secretion of IL-6
by ING adipocytes (Fig. 6B). Resistin secretion was also
not statistically different among the groups; however, a
slight reduction was observed in RP adipocytes in the FO
supplemented group (Fig. 6E). In relation to adiponectin
secretion, although not statistically significant, a tendency
to decrease (by 39%) was found in the HF group but not in
HF mice supplemented with FO, an effect observed only
in ING adipocytes (Fig. 6F).
The correlation between the lipogenic activity (oleate
incorporation into TAG) and the size of adipocytes was
calculated (Fig. 7A and B). A positive correlation (r = 0.67,
P = 0.0004) between these parameters was observed in RP
but not in ING adipose depots. When the analysis was
performed between adipocyte size and de novo synthesis
of fatty acid from acetate (de novo lipogenesis), an opposite
result was found ( i.e. a strong negative correlation
between de novo lipogenesis and the size of RP adipocytes)
(r = –0.76, P = 0.001) and a positive correlation with
ING adipocytes (r = 0.61, P = 0.001) was found (Fig. 7C
and D).
The correlation between adipocytes size and lipolytic
activity of fat cells isolated from ING and RP tissues is
shown in Fig. 7E and F. A positive correlation between
lipolytic activity and the size of RP adipocytes (r = 0.8,
P < 0.0001) was found. This correlation was not observed
in ING S.C. depots.
The size of ING adipocytes and their ability to take up
glucose was negatively correlated (r = –0.32, P = 0.02)
(Fig. 7G and H). No significant difference was observed in
the visceral depot.
Increasing the fat cell size, the IL-6 production is also
increased in both adipose tissue depots (ING and RP)
(Fig. 7I and J). A positive correlation for resistin and fat
cellsizewasfoundinRPadipocytes(Fig.7L).Bycontrast,a

strong inverse correlation (r = –0.57, P = 0.0009) between
adiponectin production and adipocyte size was observed
in ING adipose depots. Thus, IL-6 production decreases
with the hypertrophy of ING but not with that of RP
adipocytes(Fig.7MandN).Apositivecorrelationbetween
adiponectin production and the ability to take up glucose
was found again only in ING adipose depots (Fig. 7O
and P).
Discussion
The HF diet fed mice exhibited a metabolic syndrome-like
state, as indicated by a greater BW gain (more adipose
tissue), glucose and insulin intolerance, increased fasting
blood glucose and insulin levels, elevated HOMA-IR,
and augmented blood cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations.
These
changes
were
prevented
by
supplementationwithFO.Dyslipidaemiaisoftenobserved
in obese and/or diabetic patients and high plasma
concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
diseases (Graham et al. 2012).
Other studies have reported similar effects of FO
supplementation on the parameters evaluated in the pre-
sent study. Several studies have shown that n-3 FAs
reduce adiposity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in
animals fed with a HF diet (Storlien et al. 1987; Belzung
et al. 1993; Rokling-Andersen et al. 2009). FO intake
reduced the plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol and
very low-density lipoprotein (Klimes et al. 1993). A diet
containing FO reverted hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia
and adipocyte hypertrophy caused by a diet rich in sucrose
in rats (Soria et al. 2002). In the present study, we
confirmed the reduction in adiposity as indicated by the
lower weight of ING and RP fat depots in the HF+FO
group compared to HF animals. This effect of FO has
been attributed to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and
β-oxidation activity concomitant with reduced de novo
fatty acid synthesis in WAT (Couet et al. 1997; Flachs
et al. 2005). Lipogenesis occurs either as a consequence of

During de novo lipogenesis, acetyl CoA is carboxylated to
malonyl-CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is sub-
sequently converted by multistep reactions to palmitate
through fatty acid synthase complex (Ruderman et al.

In the present study, obesity induced by the HF diet was

and lipogenesis activity was found in RP adipocytes. The
de novo synthesis of FA correlated negatively with the
size of adipocytes in the RP depot, such that, the more
hypertrophied the adipocytes (RP), the less the ability to
convert substrates such as acetate and glucose into FA.
Thus, the excess of plasma glucose level generated by
insulin resistance in HF animals would not be directed
to de novo lipogenesis in the adipose depot, contributing
over the long term to the exacerbation of hyperglycaemia.
The de novo lipogenesis measurement revealed a reduction
in the conversion of acetate into FA in the HF group that
was partially prevented by FO supplementation. The de
novo lipogenesis activity was positively correlated with the
size of ING adipocytes and this was not different between
the groups, suggesting that this fat depot was affected less
(at least for this parameter) by the effects of the HF diet
and FO.
RP adipocytes showed 5– to 6-fold higher lipolysis
activity than the ING cells in CO mice, confirming that
visceral fat cells are more sensitive to lipolysis and more
resistant to insulin than the S.C. tissue, also presenting
a greater number of β-adrenergic receptors (Ibrahim,
2010). Mice fed with the HF diet showed a still higher
lipolysis activity in the RP fat depot. We also found that
the hypertrophy of fat cells induced by the HF diet showed
a positive correlation with lipolysis activity, leading to an
increase in plasma FFA levels and lipotoxicity in tissues
over the long term. Elevated levels of FFAs also lead to

an increased deposition of lipids in peripheral organs
such as muscle and liver. In obesity, an increase of FFA
uptake by muscle and liver occurs in the absence of
a concomitant elevation in FFA oxidation (Horowitz &
Klein, 2000). The excess non-oxidized FAs are deviated to
other metabolic pathways inside the cells associated with
lipotoxicity, causing insulin resistance and/or apoptosis
(Virtue & Vidal-Puig, 2010).
HF diets have been shown to lower insulin sensitivity
in the liver, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and adipose
tissue in rodents (Duplain et al. 2008; Silveira et al.
2008). Among the metabolic disorders induced by an

HF diet led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, as well as
an increase of BW gain, food ingestion, food efficiency, energetic
efficiency, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, fasted plasma glucose
levels, fasted plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Additionally, HF
diet increased ING and RP depots weight. In ING adipocytes, HF diet
caused hypertrophy, increased oleate incorporation into TAG,
decreased stimulated 2DG-glucose uptake and GLUT-4 mRNA levels,
and increased TNF-α mRNA levels. In RP adipocytes, HF diet caused
hypertrophy, increased oleate incorporation into TAG, decreased
acetate incorporation into TAG, and increased basal and stimulated
lipolysis, TNF-α mRNA levels and IL-6 cytokine. Fish oil prevented or
reversed all these effects.
excessive accumulation of fat, insulin resistance appears to
be the most important, leading, in most cases, to T2DM
(Capurso & Capurso, 2012). High blood concentrations
of FFAs as a result of enhanced lipolysis activity in hyper-
trophied adipocytes lowered glucose uptake by peripheral
tissues and hyperinsulinaemia (Zhai et al. 2010). Indeed,
visceral obesity has been associated with insulin resistance
and reduced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, liver and
WAT (Bergman & Mittelman, 1998).
The HF diet was associated with lower insulin
stimulated glucose uptake in ING fat cells. Thus, although
the ING tissue is not as lipolytic as the RP depot, it
effectively contributes to a worsening hyperglycaemic state
and insulin resistance. An inverse correlation between the
size of ING adipocytes and its ability to take up glucose
was found. RP adipocytes did not show the same features.
RP depots indirectly affect glucose uptake by other tissues,
leading to hyperglycaemia and an imbalance of glucose
homeostasis in the HF group. Indeed, FFA released from
this fat depot impairs the expression of glucose trans-
porterGLUT-4anditsrecruitmenttothecellmembranein
insulin sensitive tissues (Boden, 2011). A lower expression
ofGLUT-4wasobservedinINGadipocytes(butnotinRP)
in the HF group. FO administration prevented this change
in accordance with the results concerning glucose uptake
measured in the same adipose depot. Other studies have
shown that FO reduces the deleterious effects of a HF diet
on the ability of epididymal and RP isolated adipocytes to
utilize glucose by enhancing its transport and metabolism
(Ezaki et al. 1992).
Hypertrophied
adipocytes
exhibit
augmented
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF,
IL-6, IL-1β, resistin, monocyte chemotactic protein
1) and reduced the production of adiponectin (an
anti-inflammatory molecule and the main endogenous
insulin sensitizer), associating obesity with a chronic
low-grade inflammatory state that predisposes to insulin
resistance and the development of T2DM (O’Connell
et al. 2010). Inflammatory cytokines are produced mainly
by WAT-infiltrated leukocytes (particularly macrophages)
and are released into the extracellular space, binding to
receptors on the surface of hypertrophied adipocytes. The
secretion of cytokines by adipocytes cultured for 30 min
(and extracted from different adipose depots) with the
no ‘noise’ of macrophages was evaluated. A significant
increase in mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α was
found in RP and ING adipocytes from HF mice. This
increase was prevented by supplementation with FO.
We also observed an increase in IL-6 secretion by RP
adipocytes (but not ING) in the HF group, as well as a
tendency towards preventing this increment by the FO.
Compared to large adipocytes, small cells are more
sensitive to insulin and less lipolytic, and so release
less FFA and less inflammatory cytokines into plasma
(Yang & Smith, 2007), and also secrete more adiponectin

(Danforth, 2000). Thus, FO decreases adipocyte hyper-
trophy and contributes to attenuating the insulin
resistance caused by the HF diet, which is in accordance
with
the
inverse
correlation
between
adiponectin
production and adipocyte size observed (only) in ING
adipose depots, as well the size of these adipocytes and
their ability to take up glucose. Finally, we did observe any
positive correlation between adiponectin production and
the ability to take up glucose by ING adipocytes.
Althoughdifferencesbetween S.C.andvisceralfatdepots
have been shown, studies on inflammatory features in
S.C. and visceral isolated adipocytes and their association
with their metabolism are scarce. A positive correlation
was found not only between the size of adipocytes and
lipolytic activity in RP adipocytes, but also between
the size of adipocytes and the secretion of resistin (in
RP adipocytes) and IL-6 (in RP and ING adipocytes).
Therefore, the adipose depots play different roles in the HF
diet-induced insulin resistance according to their location
in the body. The results reported in the present study
show that adipocytes per se, in addition to WAT-infiltrated
immune cells, have to be considered in the aetiology of
the comorbidities associated with obesity (Weisberg et al.
2003). In addition, the present study shows that previous
and concomitant administration of FO can prevent the
changes in metabolism and adipokine secretion in RP and
ING adipocytes induced by HF.
The results of the present study demonstrate that HF
diet-induced obesity causes different effects on RP and
ING adipose deposits (Fig. 8). HF changed lipolysis, de
novo lipogenesis and the secretion of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in RP, as well as glucose uptake and the secretion
of adiponectin, TNF-α and IL-6 in ING. Previous and
concomitant FO administration prevented the changes
induced by the HF in both adipose tissue depots (Fig. 8).
