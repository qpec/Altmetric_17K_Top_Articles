copy number alterations associated with
cancer patient prognosis

Abstract Successful treatment decisions in cancer depend on the accurate assessment of
patient risk. To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly
malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known
outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little
information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant
prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and
CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, TP53 status, and
total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify
robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these
alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a
comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of
gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.

Introduction
Cancers that arise from the same tissue can exhibit vast differences in clinical behavior. For instance,
among individuals diagnosed with early-stage colorectal cancer, about 60% of patients will be cured
by surgery alone, while the remaining 40% will experience a recurrence that is frequently fatal
(Ma
¨kela
¨ et al., 1995). Various pathological and molecular biomarkers are typically analyzed in order
to assess patient risk and aid clinical decision-making. In general, these biomarkers are divided into
two classes: predictive and prognostic (Nalejska et al., 2014). Predictive biomarkers identify
patients who are likely to respond to specific therapies, like the EGFR mutations that sensitize lung
tumors to EGFR inhibition (Paez et al., 2004). In contrast, prognostic biomarkers provide informa-
tion on cancer aggressiveness and the likelihood of patient death. Tumor de-differentiation and
lymph-node infiltration serve as prototypical prognostic biomarkers due to their strong association
with poor outcomes (Connolly et al., 2003). Yet, these pathology-based biomarkers can suffer from
low levels of inter-observer concordance (Allsbrook et al., 2001; Coons et al., 1997; Elmore et al.,
2015; Gilks et al., 2013), and even perfect pathological assessment yields incomplete information
on a patient’s most likely clinical course (Bijker et al., 2013; Nofech-Mozes et al., 2005;
Young, 2003; Zaniboni et al., 2004). New methods to identify aggressive tumors could lead to
improvements in the stratification of patient risk, better clinical management, and a decrease in dan-
gerous and unnecessary over-treatment (Esserman et al., 2013).
Advances in high-throughput technologies have yielded unprecedented insight into the diverse
array of genomic changes found within every cancer cell. Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have characterized methylation,
mutation, copy number, and gene expression patterns across cancer types. As a result of these

 studies, many of the genomic differences between normal and transformed cells have been identi-
fied and characterized. However, we lack a similar understanding of the genomic differences
between indolent tumors and aggressive malignancies. As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to
drop, it has become increasingly feasible for hospitals to implement routine targeted and/or
genome-wide analyses of patient tumors (Gagan and Van Allen, 2015; Sholl et al., 2016;
Zehir et al., 2017). But, while several DNA-based, therapy-specific predictive biomarkers have been
discovered, the prognostic information contained within tumor genomes is much less clear.
Previous genome-wide efforts to discover novel prognostic biomarkers have largely focused on
the gene expression changes associated with patient mortality (Anaya, 2016; Anaya et al., 2015;
Gentles et al., 2015; Uhlen et al., 2017). These studies have identified a set of transcripts that
encode proteins involved in cell cycle progression that correlate with recurrence and death in several
cancer types (Cuzick et al., 2011; Dancik and Theodorescu, 2015; Gentles et al., 2015;
Mosley and Keri, 2008; Venet et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Wistuba et al., 2013). Compara-
tively less is known about how changes at the DNA level affect patient survival. Outcome-associated
analyses of genetic mutations have predominantly been conducted on a limited number of known
oncogenes from single cancer types and have come to divergent conclusions. Reports in the litera-
ture commonly suggest that mutations in driver oncogenes are associated with poor outcomes,
including, for instance, KRAS mutations in lung cancer (Guan et al., 2013; Marabese et al., 2015;
Sun et al., 2013), PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer (Li et al., 2006; Oshiro et al., 2015), and
BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer (Richman et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2010; Tol et al., 2009).
Other studies of the same genes in the same cancer types have failed to observe any significant
associations with outcome (Bozhanov et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Angulo et al., 2009; Hutchins et al.,
2011; Pang et al., 2014; Scoccianti et al., 2012). In general, mutation-based biomarker studies may
be confounded by small samples sizes, post-hoc hypothesis testing, imprecise clinical endpoints, and
the so-called ‘file drawer’ problem, in which negative findings are less likely to be published (Aron-
son, 2005; Ensor, 2014; Goossens et al., 2015; Rosenthal, 1979; Scargle, 1999). The prognostic
eLife digest Cancers are not created equal: even when the disease affects the same organ, it
can run different courses between individuals. For example, amongst people with early-stage bowel
cancer who undergo surgery, 60% will go on to live cancer-free but the remaining patients will see
the illness come back within a few years. These differences in outcome are still poorly understood,
but they may find their roots in the genetic changes present in tumor cells.
Comparing the genomes of healthy and cancerous cells can help to understand which genetic
modifications makes a cell go ‘rogue’ and start to multiply uncontrollably. Often, this happens
because of a mutation, a change in the letters that compose our genetic code. However, looking at
genetic differences between cancerous cells from different patients, or different tumors, can shed
light on how certain genetic changes make the disease deadlier or more likely to reoccur.
Smith and Sheltzer looked into the genomes of 17,879 tumors from patients whose clinical
information was also available. The analysis revealed that specific genetic alterations were more
common in either deadly or treatable cancers. Most of these changes were not mutations that
affected a few DNA letters; instead, they were copy number alterations, whereby large portions of
the genetic code are being repeated or deleted. These results suggest that while mutations
certainly drive the development of the disease, other changes such as copy number alterations can
tell us which cancers will be deadlier. Through this approach, Smith and Sheltzer were also able to
identify copy number alterations that were associated with patients responding well to certain
drugs.
These findings now need to be confirmed on a different set of data. If they hold, new
technologies may be developed so that the approach can be used cheaply and easily in the clinic.
Ultimately, being able to examine copy number alterations in tumors may help physicians to tailor
treatment for a particular cancer, or even a specific tumor.

 information captured by sequencing driver oncogenes remains unknown, and a pan-cancer, exome-
wide analysis of outcome-associated mutations has not been conducted.
Previous investigations into the prognostic importance of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs)
have indicated that highly-aneuploid tumors tend to have worse outcomes than diploid tumors
(Friedlander et al., 1984; Kallioniemi et al., 1987; Kokal et al., 1986; Merkel and McGuire, 1990;
Zimmerman et al., 1987). However, these analyses have largely focused either on arm-length
changes (Davoli et al., 2017; Roy et al., 2016) or on alterations that affect single oncogenes or
tumor suppressors (Deming et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2012; Srividya et al., 2011). The functional
importance of copy number changes in most genes at the single-gene level is unknown, and a pan-
cancer, gene-by-gene analysis of prognostic copy number alterations has not been conducted. In
order to gain a global understanding of the genomic features in a primary tumor that influence can-
cer prognosis, we collected and analyzed molecular profiles from a ‘discovery’ set of 9442 patients
and a ‘validation’ set of 8618 patients with solid tumors. Our comprehensive, gene-centric analysis
sheds light on the genomic changes that drive aggressive disease and will provide a useful resource
for the development of strategies to improve clinical risk assessment. Additionally, we provide a
web portal to facilitate community access to this rich biomarker dataset at http://survival.cshl.edu.
A cross-platform, pan-cancer analysis of cancer survival data
To determine the differences between benign and fatal tumors, we first analyzed multiple classes of
genomic data from 9442 patients with 16 types of cancer from the TCGA (outlined in Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 1A; abbreviations are defined in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). For every
tumor type and every dataset, we generated Cox univariate proportional hazards models linking the
presence or expression of a particular feature with clinical outcome (described in Supplemental Text
1). We report the Z score for each model, which encodes both the directionality and significance of
a particular association. If the presence of a mutation or copy number amplification is significantly
associated with patient death, then a Z score >1.96 corresponds to a P value < 0.05 (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 2A–C). In contrast, a Z score less than �1.96 indicates that the presence of a muta-
tion is associated with survival or that a gene deletion is significantly associated with patient death.
We extracted mutation, copy number, gene expression, and clinical information from 16 TCGA
cohorts (summarized in Supplementary file 1 and discussed in additional detail in Supplemental
Text 2). To assess the validity of our data analysis pipeline, as well as the accuracy of the reported
patient annotations, we first examined the overall survival curves for the 16 tumor types that we pro-
filed. As expected, we observed significant differences in clinical outcome according to a cancer’s
tissue-of-origin (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). Prostate cancer had the least aggressive clinical
course, with a median survival time that was not reached in this dataset (>4600 days), while pancre-
atic cancer conferred the worst prognosis (median survival time: 444 days). Overall, the 5 year sur-
vival frequencies of patients in the TCGA were highly similar to the national averages reported by
NCI-SEER (R = 0.83, p < 0.0001), suggesting that the patients included in this analysis are broadly
representative of the general population (Figure 1—figure supplement 2E). Next, we inferred
patient sex on the basis of chromosome-specific gene expression patterns (Gentles et al., 2015;
van den Berge and Sijen, 2017). Our analysis exhibited >99% concordance with patients’ self-
reported sex, further verifying the overall accuracy of the clinical annotations and our data process-
ing pipeline (Figure 1—figure supplement 2F).
Cancer mutations convey limited prognostic information
We first set out to discover whether coding mutations in cancer genomes were associated with
patient outcome. We extracted non-silent mutations in each tumor, and then we identified all genes
that were mutated in �2% of patients in each of the 16 cohorts (discussed in Supplemental Text 1).
We next performed Cox proportional hazards analysis to compare the survival times for patients har-
boring mutant or wild-type copies of each gene. This analysis uncovered very few mutations that
were significantly associated with patient outcome (Figure 1 and Supplementary file 2A-B). We first
focused on known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and found that among the 30 most-frequently
mutated cancer driver genes, only two (EGFR and TP53) were associated with prognosis in more
than two tumor types (Figure 1C). TP53 mutations were linked to outcome in five of 16 cancer types,
though the differences in patient survival were generally small (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B).

 In contrast, many other cancer driver genes were not associated with survival time in any tumor
type. While mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, CDKN2A, BRAF, KMT2D, ATM, SMAD4, and many other
genes were frequently observed, they were never significantly linked with patient outcome
(Figure 1C).
We next considered the possibility that mutations in specific codons could have prognostic signif-
icance not captured when all mutations in a gene are pooled together. To test this, we identified the

 30 most-frequently mutated amino acid positions in the TCGA cohorts, and then asked whether
patients harboring these alterations had different outcomes than those who did not. IDH1c132 muta-
tions were significantly associated with a favorable prognosis in glioma, but other recurrently-
mutated codons (KRASc12, PIK3CAc1047, TP53c273, etc.) were largely uninformative (Figure 1—figure
supplement 4A–D). Then, we identified ‘hotspot’ residues that were mutated in at least five differ-
ent patients across all cohorts. Considering only these ‘hotspot’ mutations in each gene also failed
to uncover robust survival associations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4E). Finally, we identified can-
cer type-specific recurrent mutations, but these alterations (FGFR3c249 in BLCA, CTNNB1c37 in
UCEC, etc.) were similarly uninformative (Figure 1—figure supplement 4F).
Next, we sought to test whether the use of targeted therapies had blunted the deleterious effects
of certain driver mutations (e.g., in BRAF or EGFR). However, due to the time-frame of sample col-
lection, very few patients were treated with BRAF or EGFR inhibitors, and removing those patients
who had received these therapies failed to significantly affect Z scores (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 5A). Hyper-mutation within a subset of cancers could increase mutational ‘noise’ and decrease
our ability to identify prognostic signatures, but excluding patients with hyper-mutated tumors had
minimal effect on the prognostic significance of driver gene mutations (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 5B and Supplementary file 2C). We then asked whether the presence of mutations in multiple
cancer driver genes might cooperate to confer a worse clinical outcome. We found that, in general,
patients harboring mutations in two cancer driver genes that were not prognostic alone had the
same risk of death as patients with wild-type copies of one or both genes (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 5C). Lastly, we considered the possibility that the clonality of a mutation might affect its prog-
nostic significance. We calculated the variant allele frequency (VAF) for each cancer mutation and
tested whether mutations present at clonal levels in single tumors were more likely to be associated
with outcome. We found that restricting our analysis to mutations with high VAFs failed to identify
more prognostic genes, indicating that patient stratification is unlikely to be improved by assessing
only clonal mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).
These analyses suggested that, in general, cancer driver gene mutations lacked significant patient
stratification power. This led us to investigate whether mutations in genes other than recurrently-
mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressors could affect prognosis. We therefore expanded our
analysis to include all genes mutated in �2% of patients with a particular tumor type. To account for
greatly expanding the number of genes tested, we applied a Benjamini-Hochberg correction with a
5% false-discovery rate to the individual Z scores that we obtained. We uncovered several genes
that were linked with prognosis in glioma, but found very few genes significantly associated with
death or survival in the other 15 cancer types (Figure 1D and Supplementary file 2A). For instance,
in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, 128 and 3996 genes were mutated in �2% of patients,
respectively, but none of these mutations were significantly correlated with patient outcome at a 5%
FDR. In total, these results indicate that most mutations in cancer genomes lack significant prognos-
tic power.
Subtype-independent and subtype-dependent prognostic mutations in
gliomas
In our above analysis, we noted that the five genes with the strongest survival associations were all
observed in the GBMLGG (pan-glioma) cohort. As glioma appeared to be an exception to our over-
all finding that mutations are seldom prognostic, we investigated this cohort further. Among the
top-scoring genes, we found that PTEN and EGFR mutations conferred dismal prognosis, while
mutations in IDH1, TP53, and ATRX were associated with favorable prognosis (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 7A). Mutations in these genes have previously been linked to distinct glioma subtypes
(Ceccarelli et al., 2016; Kannan et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2015), and we verified that mutations in
IDH1, TP53, and ATRX were most frequently observed in low-grade gliomas, while mutations in
PTEN and EGFR were most frequently observed in high-grade glioblastomas (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 7B). However, when we analyzed low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas separately, several
of these alterations remained prognostic (Supplementary file 2D). For instance, while IDH1 muta-
tions were more common in low-grade gliomas, they were occasionally observed in high-grade
tumors as well, and they were independently associated with prolonged survival in both cohorts (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 7C). In contrast, when EGFR mutations were observed in low-grade glio-
mas, they were associated poor outcomes, but EGFR mutations were non-prognostic in high-grade

 glioblastomas (Figure 1—figure supplement 7D). Thus, in gliomas, mutations contain both sub-
type-dependent and subtype-independent prognostic information. However, outside of this cancer
type and the tumor suppressor TP53, mutations in most cancer driver genes are non-prognostic.
Driver gene CNAs are commonly associated with cancer patient
mortality
As mutations were largely uninformative, we next set out to determine whether gene copy number
conveyed prognostic information. We determined the copy number of each gene at its transcrip-
tional start site and regressed this value against patient outcome in each tumor cohort. We then
examined the clinical impact of CNAs affecting the same 30 cancer driver genes that we previously
investigated. Surprisingly, we found that the copy number of these oncogenes and tumor suppres-
sors was frequently linked with patient outcome (Figure 2 and Supplementary file 3A-B). Amplifica-
tion of EGFR, PIK3CA, and BRAF, and deletion of CDKN2A, RB1 and EP300 were strongly
associated with shorter patient survival times in four or more cancer types each. Copy number was
prognostic even for genes in which mutations were not linked with outcome: for instance, while
mutations in PIK3CA were never informative, the copy number of PIK3CA was associated with out-
come in breast, colorectal, glioma, lung-squamous, pancreas, and prostate cancers (Figure 2B and
D). Overall, among the 30 most frequently-mutated cancer driver genes, we detected 108 significant
associations between gene copy number and outcome, compared to 23 associations between muta-
tion and outcome. For 28 out of 30 driver genes, DNA copy number was prognostic in more cancer
types than mutational status was. We conclude that determining the copy number of oncogenes and
tumor suppressors in a primary tumor can better stratify patient risk than assessing single base-pair
mutations.
In our analysis thus far, we have treated mutations as a binary variable (‘mutant’ vs. ‘not mutant’),
while copy number alterations are treated as continuous values. Thus, the greater prognostic signifi-
cance of tumor CNAs could reflect the fact that individual CNA measurements inherently harbor
more information. To test this possibility, we trichotomized CNA values into ‘deletions’ (<�0.3),
‘amplifications’ (>0.3), and ‘copy-neutral’ (��0.3 and�0.3). We then calculated Cox regressions at
the same 30 loci using the discretized copy number values. This analysis resulted in 94 significant sur-
vival associations, more than four times as many significant features as when mutations were ana-
lyzed, and comparable to the number of significant features that resulted using continuous CNA
values (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This analysis suggests that the greater prognostic signifi-
cance of CNAs is not simply a consequence of the continuous nature of copy number data.
We next investigated whether these oncogene and tumor suppressor CNAs were likely to drive
patient mortality, or whether they were passenger genes that changed in copy number along with
other, unknown drivers. To assess this question, we combined Z scores from different cancer types
using Stouffer’s method (Stouffer, 1949), and then plotted the pan-cancer meta-Z scores along
every chromosome (Figure 2C). This analysis revealed multiple sharp peaks and valleys in the data
that overlapped with known driver mutations. The most significant survival-associated copy number
changes genome-wide were found on chromosome 9p in a valley that precisely included the tumor
suppressor CDKN2A. Z score peaks were found at loci that include oncogenes PIK3CA, EGFR, MYC,
CCNE1, and others. This overlap suggests that, in many instances, the copy number of these onco-
genes and tumor suppressors directly influence the risk of cancer patient death.
The prognostic significance of CNAs is independent of tumor sample
purity and immune infiltration
Whole-chromosome aneuploidy has previously been linked to a decreased infiltration of immune
cells (Davoli et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018). We therefore considered the possibility that CNAs
are prognostic via an indirect mechanism; namely that they are found in tumors that lack robust
immune infiltration, and this deficient immune response was itself driving patient mortality. However,
multiple lines of evidence argue against this interpretation. First, we assessed the association
between patient survival and three different measures of tumor sample purity: pathologist-assessed
tumor cell fraction, sample purity as judged by ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2018),
and leukocyte infiltration, as judged by methylation analysis (Taylor et al., 2018). We found that
sample purity was inconsistently-associated with patient outcome (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).

 For instance, higher tumor purity determined by either pathological analysis or ABSOLUTE was asso-
ciated with worse outcome in only one of 16 cohorts, each (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B).
The lack of a strong correlation between infiltrating cell populations and clinical prognosis suggests
that analyte purity is insufficient to explain the relationship between CNAs and patient survival. Sec-
ondly, we generated multivariate Cox models that included gene copy number and these three

Figure 2. Oncogene and tumor suppressor CNAs drive cancer patient mortality. (A) Examples of driver gene CNAs associated with patient outcome.
The copy number of CDKN2A, EGFR, and BRCA2 in the indicated patient cohorts are displayed, as well as Kaplan-Meier curves of patient survival
according to gene copy number. Amplifications and deletions correspond to CNAs > |0.3|, while deep-deletions and high-copy gains correspond to
CNAs > |1|. (B) A heatmap of significant survival associations among the 30 most frequently-mutated cancer driver genes in 16 tumor types from the
TCGA are displayed. Z scores were calculated by regressing gene copy number against patient outcome within each tumor type. The complete list of Z
scores is presented in Supplementary file 3A. (C) Z scores from 16 cancer types from the TCGA were combined using Stouffer’s method, and then the
resulting meta-Z scores were plotted against the chromosomal location. Genes were binned by average Z score into groups of 5 for visualization. Gene
names indicate candidate driver genes found within survival-associated peaks and valleys. (D) Kaplan-Meier curves are plotted for two oncogenes,
PIK3CA (left) and KRAS (right), comparing the prognostic relevance of mutations in those genes versus copy number alterations in these genes.
Amplifications correspond to CNAs > 0.3, while high-copy gains correspond to CNAs > 1.

 measurements of tumor purity, and we found that driver gene CNAs remain broadly prognostic in
these bivariate models (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and Supplementary file 3C-E). For
instance, we discovered that amplification of Cyclin E1 is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian
cancer, and this remained true even when our analysis was restricted to high-purity tumor samples
and samples that lacked significant leukocyte presence (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D). Thus,
while the interrelationship between aneuploidy and immunological tolerance likely plays an impor-
tant role in tumor development, this analysis suggests that it is not the primary driver of CNA-associ-
ated patient mortality.
Copy number analysis improves on patient stratification conferred by
common clinical parameters
Pathological assessment of tumor stage and grade are important sources of prognostic information,
though blinded assessments reveal significant inter-observer discordance (Allsbrook et al., 2001;
Coons et al., 1997; Elmore et al., 2015; Gilks et al., 2013). We therefore tested whether the CNA
biomarkers that we uncovered could affect the stratification conferred by these parameters. We
found that Z scores generated from either univariate models or multivariate models that included
stage or grade were highly correlated (R = 0.91 and R = 0.96 respectively; Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 3A and Supplementary file 4). Overall, 71% of prognostic CNAs in individual cancer types
remained prognostic in these multivariate models (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). Thus, includ-
ing gene-level copy-number assessment can significantly improve the stratification of patient risk
beyond standard clinical parameters (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–D). Certain mutations were
similarly able to yield prognostic information in a stage- and grade-independent manner. However,
due to the lower overall significance of most mutations that we identified, the improvements in
patient
stratification
were
generally
more
modest
(Figure
2—figure
supplement
3E
and
Supplementary file 4E).
Gene-level copy number values also remained prognostic when separating TCGA cohorts by can-
cer subtype (Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 4F-G). For instance, CNA Z
scores values were highly correlated between the bulk GBMLGG cohort and the individual GBM and
LGG subtypes (R = 0.68 and R = 0.86, respectively; Figure 2—figure supplement 4A). While analyz-
ing the GBM cohort separately abolished the prognostic significance of EGFR mutations (Figure 2—
figure supplement 4D), EGFR amplifications remained associated with outcome in both the LGG
and GBM cohorts (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B–C). Amplifications in MYC and PIK3CA were
similarly
prognostic
in
multiple
tumor
subtypes
(Figure
2—figure
supplement
4D–E
and
Supplementary file 4G). At other loci, low patient numbers from certain subtypes may obscure the
detection of specific biomarkers. For instance, within the KIPAN cohort, 67% of tumors are clear cell
carcinomas, 23% of tumors are papillary cell carcinomas, and 10% of tumors are chromophobe carci-
nomas. CDKN2A deletion is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in the pan-kidney cohort, in clear
cell carcinomas, and in papillary cell carcinomas, but did not reach statistical significance when kid-
ney chromophobe carcinomas were analyzed independently (Figure 2—figure supplement 4F–G).
In total, these results underscore the ability of driver gene CNAs to improve patient stratification
when controlling for tumor identity, though larger cohort numbers may be needed to identify the
strongest biomarkers in rare cancer subtypes.
Driver gene CNAs contain prognostic information not captured by
TP53 mutation status or total aneuploidy
Highly-aneuploid tumors tend to harbor mutations in TP53, and both TP53 mutations and arm-
length aneuploidy have previously been associated with poor clinical outcomes (Davoli et al., 2017;
Petitjean et al., 2007). Using an ‘aneuploidy score’ for each tumor based on the total number of
arm-length alterations (Taylor et al., 2018), we verified that TP53-mutant tumors exhibit more aneu-
ploidy than TP53-wild-type tumors (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), and that total aneuploidy is a
poor prognosis factor in several cancer types (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). To investigate the
relationship between gene-level prognostic CNAs, TP53 status, and arm-length aneuploidy, we
selected a set of 40 prognostic amplifications and deletions for additional analysis (Figure 3—figure
supplement 2A). In multivariate models that included TP53 mutation status, 33 of 40 (83%) gene-
level CNAs remained prognostic, demonstrating that these CNAs are not linked with death due to

Cancer Biology
 an indirect association with TP53 status (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B). Similarly, in multivari-
ate models that included total tumor aneuploidy, 80% of these CNAs were still associated with out-
come (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–D). Finally, as a proxy for the total structural alteration
burden, we summed the number of breakpoints (as indicated by discrete copy number values along
a chromosome) in each tumor (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This metric was associated with
outcome in multiple tumor types (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), but 75% of driver gene CNAs
remained prognostic in multivariate models that included this score (Figure 3—figure supplement
2E–F). These results indicate that assessing gene-level tumor CNAs can yield more prognostic infor-
mation than simply screening for TP53 mutations or measuring bulk levels of tumor aneuploidy
(Supplementary file 5).
Focal CNAs typically portend worse prognosis than broad CNAs
We next set out to determine whether focal copy number alterations and broad copy number altera-
tions could have distinct effects on patient outcome. To investigate this possibility, we compared
the prognostic power of focal CNAs (defined as an alteration �3 Mb in length; Krijgsman et al.,
2014) and broad CNAs (defined as all alterations >3 Mb in length). Among loci at which both broad
and focal alterations were observed, we frequently found that broad CNAs were associated with
moderately worse outcomes, while focal CNAs were associated with sharp declines in survival
(Figure 3A–B). At some loci, broad CNAs had outcomes that were indistinguishable from copy-neu-
tral tumors, while only focal CNAs were associated with death (Figure 3C). We rarely detected
instances in which broad CNAs indicated a worse prognosis than a focal alteration (Figure 3A). We
interpret these results as a reflection of aneuploidy-induced fitness penalties (Sheltzer et al., 2017;
Sheltzer and Amon, 2011): large copy number alterations change the dosage of multiple genes at
once and can impair tumor growth, while targeted alterations that specifically affect driver gene
copy number maximize malignant potential.
Focal CNAs affect patient outcome by changing the expression levels
of wild-type genes
Gene copy number alterations typically result in a proportional change in the expression of the
affected loci (Pollack et al., 2002; Stingele et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2008), though instances of
dosage compensation have been reported (Gonc
¸alves et al., 2017). To test the effects of prognos-
tic CNAs on gene expression, we compared transcript levels and gene copy number changes at 40
prognostic loci and found a significant correlation between the two at 98% of the analyzed genes
(Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Next, we sought to uncover whether these copy number altera-
tions were deadly because they increased or decreased the expression of mutant gene products.
That is, we could observe that the amplification of a driver gene is prognostic only in tumors in which
that driver gene is also mutated. Interestingly, this is not the case: at 95% of our test loci, gene copy
number remained prognostic in multivariate models that also included gene mutation status
(Figure 3D). For instance, in colorectal cancer, amplification of EGFR was associated with death
even in tumors that lacked EGFR mutations (Figure 3E). In total, these results indicate that even at
recurrently-mutated loci, changes in the expression of the wild-type gene can have a profound effect
on cancer cell behavior. Together with our observation that focal changes tend to confer a worse
prognosis than broad changes, these results support the recently-proposed ‘cancer gene island’
model of tumor genome evolution (discussed in more detail below; Solimini et al., 2012).
Independent patient cohorts verify the prognostic significance of driver
gene CNAs
To determine the generality of our findings, we collected independent patient cohorts harboring
mutation or copy number data linked to survival outcome (Supplementary file 1). We then per-
formed univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis on these ‘validation’ cohorts and compared the
results to the Z scores obtained from our ‘discovery’ set of TCGA data. First, we identified prognos-
tic mutations within a set of 16 patient cohorts from the International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC), comprising 3054 patients analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Overall,
the mutation frequencies and the Z scores of recurrent mutations were highly similar between the
ICGC and TCGA cohorts (R = 0.67, p < 0.0001, and R = 0.56, p < 0.0001, respectively; Figure 4A–

Figure 3. Effects of amplicon size and gene mutation status on prognostic CNAs. (A) 20 prognostic amplifications and 20 prognostic deletions were
selected for further analysis (see also Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Of those 40, 14 had at least five patients who had focal CNAs (�3 Mb) and at
least five patients who had broad CNAs (>3 Mb). Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed comparing the presence or absence of
any CNA at the indicated locus, or comparing the presence or absence of a CNA of a particular size. (B and C) Kaplan-Meier curves are plotted at four
prognostic loci comparing tumors with focal CNAs (�3 Mb), tumors with broad CNAs (>3 Mb), and tumors that lack CNAs at that locus. Amplifications
and deletions correspond to CNAs > |0.3|. (D) Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed including both the copy number of the
indicated gene as well as the mutational status of that gene. Z scores for either the univariate models (CNAs alone) or the multivariate models
(CNAs + mutation status) are displayed. (E) Kaplan-Meier curves comparing gene mutation status and gene copy number for EGFR and MLH1
alterations in colorectal cancer. EGFR amplification and MLH1 deletion are associated with poor prognosis, regardless of whether the tumor harbors an
EGFR or MLH1 mutation. In the bottom graph, note that no tumors harbored both MLH1 deletions and mutations.

Figure 4. Driver gene copy number, but not driver gene mutations, are associated with survival in independent patient cohorts. (A) Genes mutated
in �10% of patients in each tumor type in the TCGA were identified, and then compared to the mutation frequency of these genes in the
corresponding ICGC cohort or cohorts. The complete list of Z scores is presented in Supplementary file 6A. (B) Z scores of the 10 most frequently-
mutated genes per cancer type in the ICGC were identified and then plotted against the Z scores of the same gene from the corresponding TCGA
cohort or cohorts. (C) Significant Z scores (>1.96 or<�1.96) were counted per gene, and then the number of significant cohorts from the TCGA and the
ICGC are plotted. While the vast majority of frequently-mutated genes are significant in zero or one cancer type, TP53 mutation status is associated
with prognosis in 12 of 32 total patient cohorts. (D) A heatmap of significant survival associations among the 30 most frequently-mutated cancer driver
genes in 16 patient cohorts from the ICGC are displayed. Z scores were calculated by regressing survival times between patients harboring wild-type

 B). Consistent with our TCGA analysis, mutations in TP53 were associated with outcome in more
patient cohorts than any other gene (Figure 4C and Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D). Other
mutations, including in known cancer driver genes, were rarely associated with outcome in individual
cancer types and harbored minimal pan-cancer significance (Figure 4D–F and Supplementary file
6). Mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, APC, PTEN, CDKN2A, and many others were frequently
observed but were never correlated with outcome (Figure 4D). We next analyzed 2431 additional
patients with CNA data curated by cBioportal, and found numerous amplifications and deletions
associated with patient mortality (Supplementary file 6C). In breast cancer, we found prognostic
amplifications that were centered around oncogenes, including ERBB2, MYC, and MDM2, while
prognostic deletions encompassed tumor suppressors CDKN2A, PTEN, and TP53 (Figure 4G). Over-
all, we observed a highly significant correlation between the meta-Z scores obtained from the TCGA
and cBioportal datasets (R = 0.42; Figure 4H). Finally, in patient cohorts subjected to both mutation
and copy number analysis, we verified that CNAs in driver genes commonly harbored greater prog-
nostic significance than mutations in those same genes (Figure 4I). For instance, in breast cancer,
among 25 frequently-mutated genes, mutations in only two genes (TP53 and GATA3) displayed
prognostic significance, while CNAs in 12 of those same genes were associated with patient out-
come (Figure 4J). In total, these analyses suggest that the survival patterns discovered in the TCGA
dataset are conserved across independent cohorts of cancer patients. In particular, while mutations
in most cancer driver genes are non-prognostic, copy number alterations in these same genes are
tightly linked with patient outcome.
Cross-cohort identification of high-confidence prognostic biomarkers
In order to discover the biomarkers with the greatest potential clinical relevance, we next identified
the individual mutations and CNAs that were consistently associated with outcome across indepen-
dent patient cohorts. To increase our ability to detect these genetic alterations, we performed sur-
vival analysis on an additional set of 2701 primary tumors subjected to targeted sequencing and
copy number analysis (MSKCC_2017; Supplementary file 7) (Zehir et al., 2017), on 2431 patients
from cBioportal cohorts whose tumors had been sequenced (Supplementary file 6D), and on 628
patients from ICGC cohorts subjected to copy number analysis (Supplementary file 6B). Our com-
bined patient dataset therefore included two to six independent cohorts from each of 13 common
cancer types, comprising 16,580 total patients. These cohorts were collected at different locations,
in different patient populations, using different study designs, and the samples were analyzed using
different genomic technologies. We reasoned that alterations that were consistently associated with
outcome despite these significant differences would represent highly-penetrant biomarkers of
patient prognosis. To identify such alterations, we screened for biomarkers that were associated
with outcome (|Z| > 1.96) in �2 independent cohorts, and that were highly significant (|meta-Z| > 3.3)
across all available cohorts. This approach revealed multiple high-confidence genetic biomarkers of
patient outcome that, to our knowledge, were novel, including MDM4 amplifications in prostate can-
cer, NOTCH2 amplifications in melanoma, and 2q32 deletions in ovarian cancer (Supplementary file
8). These robust biomarkers allowed a striking stratification of patient risk, and top-scoring CNAs
remained prognostic in multivariate models that included commonly-measured prognostic criteria
(Gleason score in prostate cancer, Hepatitis serology in liver cancer, etc.; Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1). Consistent with our single-cohort analyses, cross-cohort prognostic CNAs were significantly

 more common than prognostic mutations, and TP53 was the only gene whose mutation status was
associated with outcome in more than one cancer type (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).
Certain prognostic biomarkers are also associated with unique
therapeutic vulnerabilities
We hypothesized that some genetic alterations that were sufficient to affect overall patient survival
could impact other facets of cancer behavior as well, including, potentially, drug sensitivity. That is,
biomarkers harboring significant prognostic information could potentially contain predictive informa-
tion as well. We therefore sought to discover whether genetic alterations that drove aggressive dis-
ease could also sensitize patient tumors to specific therapeutic regimens. By analyzing a cohort of
1000 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we identified several instances in which high-confidence
biomarkers were associated with vulnerability to particular anti-cancer agents (Gao et al., 2015a).
For instance, we identified Chr9 deletions that encompassed CDKN2A as a robust biomarker for
poor prognosis in breast cancer (Supplementary file 8). We found that PDXs harboring CDKN2A
deletions were profoundly sensitive to combination therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and an mTOR
inhibitor (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B), consistent with the fact that a protein encoded by
CDKN2A, p16, functions as a natural inhibitor of CDK4/6 (Serrano et al., 1993), p. 4). In contrast,
other biomarkers associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer failed to predict sensitivity to this
treatment combination, but instead correlated with sensitivity to other agents (Supplementary file
8). Due to the limited number of drugs tested in PDXs, we expanded our target search to include a
recently-described pharmacogenomic profile of cancer cell lines and discovered several additional
biomarker vulnerabilities (Figure 5A–B). For instance, we identified mutations in STAG2 as a high-
confidence biomarker of poor prognosis in glioma, and we found that STAG2-mutant gliomas were
exquisitely sensitive to treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Figure 5A). In total, we identified
highly-significant therapeutic vulnerabilities for 49% of the prognostic biomarkers uncovered by our
integrated analysis, providing potential strategies to treat a subset of patients who have the most
aggressive cancers.

(Johnson et al., 2017). However, increasing evidence suggests that large subsets of patients receive
sub-optimal care, and are over-treated or under-treated relative to their level of risk (Bhatt and
Klotz, 2016; Esserman et al., 2013; Swaminathan and Swaminathan, 2015). To date, many of the
genetic alterations that differentiate fatal and benign tumors have remained obscure. Our analysis of
prognostic biomarkers from 17,879 patients sheds light on these genetic differences, identifies a
subset of patients who may benefit the most from aggressive intervention, and suggests therapeutic
strategies for tumors harboring certain alterations associated with poor prognosis. A web portal to
facilitate access to these results is available at http://survival.cshl.edu/.
As cancers arise due to the accumulation of mutations in growth-promoting oncogenes and
growth-inhibitory tumor suppressors, the presence and diversity of these mutations may be
expected to dictate a tumor’s clinical course. However, our data suggest that in many cases, they do
not. Substantial disagreements exist in the literature on the value of mutation-based prognostic bio-
markers, as the same driver oncogenes have been independently reported to be either adverse or
non-significant prognostic features (Guan et al., 2013; Marabese et al., 2015; Scoccianti et al.,
2012; Sun et al., 2013). In this manuscript, we performed an unbiased genome-wide analysis of
public datasets with pre-established sample sizes. This approach may therefore bypass certain prob-
lems, including post-hoc hypothesis testing, patient-selection bias, and the ‘file-drawer problem’,
that can confound targeted biomarker studies (Aronson, 2005; Ensor, 2014; Goossens et al.,
2015; Rosenthal, 1979; Scargle, 1999). We consider it possible that, with larger sample sizes or
more-specific tumor subtypes, additional prognostic mutations could be identified. Importantly, in
most patient cohorts that we collected, tumors were analyzed on multiple genomic platforms, and
CNAs were commonly prognostic in the same cohorts in which gene mutations were not. These
results underscore our ability to successfully detect biomarkers in cohorts of these sizes, and suggest
that, in a head-to-head comparison, copy number alterations provide more useful prognostic infor-
mation than single-gene mutations.

 While we identified very few mutations associated with patient outcome, several lines of evidence
underscore the potential benefits of continued clinical sequencing efforts. First, our analysis revealed
a subset of mutations with tissue-specific prognostic power, including TP53 mutations in breast can-
cer, RB1 mutations in bladder cancer, and FBXW7 mutations in colorectal cancer. Secondly, most
patients in the TCGA cohorts were treated with standard cytotoxic drugs. As targeted and immuno-
therapies are increasingly adopted in the clinic, oncogenic mutations that were non-prognostic in
the datasets analyzed here may be able to predict sensitivity to specific therapeutic agents
(Gagan and Van Allen, 2015). Thirdly, tumors themselves are composed of sub-clonal populations
that harbor distinct sets of mutations, and recent evidence suggests that cancer heterogeneity can
influence clinical course (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017). Thus, interrogating the mutational spectrum at
the sub-clonal level may identify prognostic mutations not distinguished in bulk analyses.
Though large-scale changes in tumor ploidy have previously been recognized as an indicator of
poor outcome (Friedlander et al., 1984; Kallioniemi et al., 1987; Kokal et al., 1986; Merkel and
McGuire, 1990; Zimmerman et al., 1987), the contributions of copy number alterations in most sin-
gle genes have remained unexplored. Despite the limited stratification value of mutations in cancer

 driver genes, we found that copy number alterations of many of these same genes are broadly prog-
nostic. Focal CNAs tended to confer a worse prognosis than broad CNAs, consistent with a model
in which large-scale gene dosage imbalances trigger proteotoxic stress and impose a fitness penalty
on cancer cells (Santaguida and Amon, 2015; Sheltzer and Amon, 2011). Moreover, while prog-
nostic CNAs commonly caused proportional changes in target gene expression, most CNAs
remained prognostic whether or not they affected the expression of a mutated gene. These results
support a ‘cancer gene island’ or ‘cumulative aneuploidy’ model of tumorigenesis, in which cancers
accumulate a series of limited copy number changes affecting haplo-sensitive and triplo-sensitive
regions (Davoli et al., 2013; Solimini et al., 2012). Identifying the functional consequences of these
prognostic CNAs on tumor physiology is a key future goal.
Patients whose tumors harbor genetic alterations that drive mortality are in urgent need of
improved treatment options. We discovered many instances in which high-confidence biomarkers of
aggressive disease also sensitized tumors to specific anti-cancer therapies. By taking advantage of
these vulnerabilities, a precision-medicine approach could be applied to both stratify patient risk
and identify drug combinations most likely to provide a clinical benefit. Several predicted sensitivi-
ties from our work have clinical or mechanistic support, including the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to
treat CDKN2A-deleted tumors, the use of PARP inhibitors to treat STAG2-mutant tumors, and the
use of SYK inhibitors to treat RB1-mutant tumors (Bailey et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2015b;
Zhang et al., 2012). Treatment with targeted agents significantly alters the cellular epigenetic and
genetic landscape, often culminating in the development of resistance to the applied therapies
(Holohan et al., 2013). We speculate that secondary alterations that tumors evolve to tolerate these
drugs could also alter or blunt the aggressive phenotype caused by the original driver alteration. In
this way, targeting a biomarker that confers poor prognosis could both directly lead to improved
patient outcomes by triggering a robust clinical response, and indirectly help patients by forcing
tumor evolution away from dependence on a driver of aggressive disease.
Materials and methods
Data sources
Patient cohorts analyzed in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1. For the TCGA analysis, pre-
processed files from the Broad Institute TCGA Firehose were used (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/
). For the TCGA genomic copy number analysis, we used the HG19 segmented SCNAs, corrected
for germline SCNAs. Overall survival time was used as a clinical endpoint for all cancer types except
PRAD. Overall survival was chosen because it reflects an objective and unambiguous event, it is the
gold-standard for oncology clinical trials, and it is widely-available across different studies
(Driscoll and Rixe, 2009). However, as fewer than 2% of the patients in the PRAD cohort died dur-
ing the follow-up period, ‘days to biochemical recurrence’ was used as a surrogate endpoint. For all
cancers, survival or follow-up time from diagnosis were corrected for the days to sample procure-
ment. Primary tumors (indicated with a ‘01’ in the patient barcode) were used for every cancer type
except SKCM; for this cancer, few primary samples were available, so metastatic samples (indicated
with a ‘06’ in the barcode) were included for patients in which no primary tumor was available. For
additional discussion of the TCGA samples, see Supplemental Text 2. Pathology-assessed tumor cell
fraction was obtained from the TCGA clinical files under ‘Percent_tumor_cells’. Tumor stage and
grade were similarly obtained from the appropriate TCGA clinical files.
Mutation, copy number, and clinical data from Release 25 of the International Genome Consor-
tium were downloaded from the ICGC Data Portal (Zhang et al., 2011). Overall survival was used as
a clinical endpoint for all cohorts except EOPC-DE; due to the few deaths in this cohort, recurrence-
free survival was used as an endpoint. Cohorts were chosen based on the availability of WGS or
WES data, and were included if they came from a cancer type comparable to the types that were
studied in our TCGA analysis.
Copy number, mutation, and clinical data from cBioportal were downloaded as pre-processed
files from www.cbioportal.org (Gao et al., 2013). For the patients described in Zehir et al. (2017)
(the cBioportal/MSKCC_2017 cohorts), only primary tumors were included for all cancer types
except melanoma.

 Overall analysis strategy
All processing and analysis was performed using Python. Cox proportional hazard analysis used the
R survival package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) to compute Z
scores and p values. Justification and further explanation for the use of Cox proportional hazards
modeling can be found in Supplemental Text 1. The rpy2 project was used to control R from python,
allowing seamless integration of Z score calculations with data processing and pan-cancer analysis.
Pandas DataFrames were used as the primary structure for storing and manipulating data. Addition-
ally, native numpy methods and arrays were for used occasionally for efficiently storing strictly
numerical data, for example, as input to Cox proportional hazards models. The statsmodels package
(www.statsmodels.org) was used for false discovery correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg proce-
dure. Microsoft Excel was occasionally used for final data processing and examination, so a single
apostrophe was added before gene names in intermediate data processing steps to protect genes
from auto-formatting (Zeeberg et al., 2004).
Code was structured to allow ease of internal reuse and reproducibility of results. Cox univariate
proportional hazards, Cox multivariate proportional hazards, Kaplan-Meier, and Stouffers analysis
methods were factored into an analysis library, taking as input the data required to perform the
computation as numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames.
TCGA analysis
In addition to the code for statistical analyses, code for processing TCGA clinical files was factored
into a common library. This approach allowed the same TCGA clinical file processing code to be
executed across a variety of platform analyses, ensuring identical behavior for each platform. The
TCGA clinical processing code selected the relevant clinical endpoints and sample procurement
data. The processing translated the available clinical data into the required format for Cox propor-
tional hazard models: an endpoint/survival time value and a censor value for each patient. Code to
select tumor samples based on cancer type was also included in this library.
Raw input data for the mutation analysis needed additional preprocessing before Cox propor-
tional hazard models could be constructed. This preprocessing included removing per-patient head-
ers throughout the data and some data transposition. For all analyses using TCGA mutation data,
mutations annotated as silent were excluded. Genes were only included in downstream analyses if
they were mutated in 2% or more of the patients in a cancer type cohort.
Raw input data for copy number analysis also required substantial preprocessing. Copy number
input data consists of per-patient, per-chromosome location maps of copy numbers (hg19 down-
loaded from the UCSC Genome Browser; Tyner et al., 2017). These maps were converted to a sin-
gle copy number value for each gene. We created an interval tree (using the intervaltree python
package, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervaltree) of the location maps for each chromosome and
used the appropriate HGNC to convert chromosome locations to genes for each patient. We used
the gene’s transcriptional start site position to look up in the interval tree the copy number value for
a gene. This analysis produced an intermediate file of a similar form to the other TGCA platforms,
which allowed for straightforward Cox analysis. Note that Cox proportional hazards models are a
threshold-independent method of performing survival analysis, and so no minimum or maximum
threshold for a copy number alteration was specified.
A tumor was defined as having a focal amplification or deletion if its copy number was greater
than 0.3 or less than �0.3, and the chromosomal interval with a copy number greater than 80% of
the copy number at the gene of interest was less than or equal to 3 Mb (Krijgsman et al., 2014).
To calculate the number of structural alterations per tumor, the number of distinct copy number
values per chromosome in the DNA segmentation file was summed for each patient.
Pan-cancer TCGA analysis
For each platform and analysis type, we performed a pan-cancer analysis. This analysis created a sin-
gle Z score for each gene by combining the per gene Z scores from each cancer type using
Stouffer’s method. To perform Stouffer’s method, we took the sum of the Z scores for a single gene
and divided that sum by the square root of the number of cancer types with Z scores for the gene
(Stouffer, 1949). This meta-Z score was then compared against meta-Z scores obtained similarly
from other platform analyses.

 Additional TCGA mutation analyses
We performed several additional analyses on mutation data, including double mutation combination
Z scores, hotspot codon Z scores, and Z scores corrected for VAFs. For double mutation Z scores,
we took the top 30 most common cancer driver genes and performed pairwise combinations. We
then calculated Cox proportional hazards for each pair of genes, where a patient was considered to
have a pairwise mutation if and only if both genes were non-silently mutated for that patient. Z
scores were only calculated for a pair if (1) neither gene in the pair was statistically significant alone
in the univariate analysis and (2) if both genes were mutated together in at least 10 patients.
Per-codon Z scores were calculated for a selected set of hotspot codons. Most cancer types were
available in HG37, so HG37 mutation positions were used to locate codons. Mutations for OV and
COADREAD were only available in HG36, so gene positions were converted to HG37 before codon
processing. Per codon Z scores were calculated by first identifying patients with mutations in the rel-
evant gene, then selecting from that set of patients those whose mutations were in the codon of
interest. If 2% of patients or more had mutations in the selected codon, a Z score was calculated.
VAFs were calculated for 10 of the TCGA cancer types. We analyzed VAF data in two ways. First,
we calculated Z scores, only counting a gene as mutated if its VAF was greater than or equal to 0.4.
Secondly, we identified the median VAF score per gene, and calculated Z scores only counting a
gene as mutated if its VAF was equal to or greater than the median VAF for that gene.
CBioPortal analysis
CBioPortal was structured similarly to the TCGA analyses, though data processing was not factored
into an independent library since each of these datasets was only used in one analysis. Copy number
data from one CBioPortal cancer type, blca_mskcc, required initial preprocessing in the manner
described above for TCGA copy numbers. Mutations were included if they were annotated as one
of these types: In_Frame_Ins, Nonstop_Mutation, Translation_Start_Site, In_Frame_Del, Splice_Re-
gion, Frame_Shift_Ins, Frame_Shift_Del, Splice_Site, Nonsense_Mutation, or Missense_Mutation.
ICGC analysis
ICGC analysis was structured similarly to CBioPortal analysis. Mutations were only included in down-
stream analyses if they were annotated as one of these types: disruptive inframe deletion, disruptive
inframe insertion, frameshift variant, inframe deletion, missense variant, splice acceptor variant,
splice donor variant, stop gained, or stop lost. Z scores were calculated if a gene was mutated in 2%
or more of the patients in a particular cohort.
Identification of high-confidence biomarkers associated with drug
sensitivities
Across independent datasets, cohorts of patients from related cancer types were identified. Muta-
tions or CNAs significantly associated with patient prognosis (Z > 1.96 or Z < �1.96) in two or more
independent cohorts from each cancer type were determined. Then, the subset of these alterations
that remained highly-significant (Z > 3.3 or Z < �3.3) across all cohorts from the same cancer type
were classified as high-confidence biomarkers. In some instances, amplifications that spanned contin-
uous chromosomal regions were found to correlate with patient prognosis. These segments were
identified manually. For the determinations of therapeutic sensitivity described below, the gene with
the minimum meta-Z score (for deletions) or maximum meta-Z score (for amplifications) within a seg-
ment was chosen to represent the segment as a whole.
Therapeutic sensitivity data for PDXs was acquired from (Gao et al., 2015a). To identify muta-
tions that correlated with therapy sensitivity, for each drug or drug combination, a comparison was
performed if five or more PDXs had a mutation in a gene of interest, and if five or more PDXs were
wild-type for a gene of interest. For genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we next identified
instances in which the therapy resulted in a clinical response in the mutant population, defined as an
average ‘Best Average Response’<15% tumor growth among PDXs with a mutation in the gene of
interest. Finally, for genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we performed a t-test for the ‘Best
Average Response’ between PDXs with mutant and wild-type copies of a gene of interest. We
reported therapies in which these criteria were met and tumors with mutation were more sensitive
to the therapy than tumors with wild-type copies of the gene of interest (p < 0.01).

 To identify CNAs that correlated with therapy sensitivity in the PDX cohort, amplifications and
deletions (CNA >|.3|) were called, and then considered separately. As above, CNAs were included if
five or more PDXs exhibited an alteration, and if five or more PDXs did not exhibit that alteration.
For genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we next identified instances in which the therapy
resulted in a clinical response in the altered population, defined as an average ‘Best Average
Response’<15% tumor growth among PDXs with an amplification or deletion in the gene of interest.
Finally, for genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we performed a t-test for the ‘Best Average
Response’ between PDXs with mutant and wild-type copies of a gene of interest. We reported ther-
apies in which these criteria were met and tumors with a mutation were more sensitive to the ther-
apy than tumors with wild-type copies of the gene of interest (p < 0.01).
Therapeutic sensitivity data from cancer cell lines was acquired from (Iorio et al., 2016). For this
data, two different comparisons were used. First, the calculations described below were performed
for cell lines from the specific cancer type that the high-confidence biomarker was identified in. If
this analysis yielded no significant vulnerabilities, then the calculations were repeated across all can-
cer types (pan-cancer).
High-confidence mutations were assessed if five or more cell lines in the set of interest had a non-
synonymous mutation in that gene, and if five or more cell lines had wild-type copies of that gene.
CNAs were assessed if five or more cell lines had an alteration (deletion or amplification) of that
gene, and if five or more cell lines lacked that alteration. For each comparison, T-tests were per-
formed between the log(IC50) value of every tested compound. For single-cancer type analyses, a
threshold of p < 0.01 was used to identify significance, while for pan-cancer analyses, a threshold of
p < 0.0001 was used to identify significance.

Kaplan-Meier analysis
Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using Graphpad Prism. Deletions and amplifications in Kaplan-
Meier plots correspond to CNAs > |0.3|; deep deletions and high-copy gains correspond to CNAs >
|1|. P values reported in KM plots were generated by the log-rank test in Prism. Note that Kaplan-
Meier plots are displayed in this manuscript primarily for the ease of visualizing patient outcomes. Z
scores were always generated with Cox proportional hazards modeling, which does not require the
selection of artificial cut-offs or thresholds for continuous data.
Additional data sources and tools
The 30 frequently-mutated cancer driver genes were acquired from (Zehir et al., 2017). NCI-SEER
statistics were downloaded from https://seer.cancer.gov. Total tumor aneuploidy scores, ABSO-
LUTE-determined purity values, and leukocyte infiltration was obtained from (Taylor et al., 2018).
Hyper-mutated samples were obtained from (Bailey et al., 2018). Lollipop plots were generated
using Lollipops software (Jay and Brouwer, 2016). Density plots were generated with Python scripts
using matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/). Single base-pair mutations were mapped to codons using
PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010).
Supplemental text 1. Cox proportional hazards modeling
Multiple statistical techniques have been developed to perform survival or ‘time-to-failure’ analysis
(reviewed in Kleinbaum and Klein, 2012). These include Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional
hazards regression, accelerated failure time modeling, and many others. In this paper, we chose to
apply Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze cancer survival data. The Cox model is repre-
sented by the following function:
h t;X
ð
Þ ¼ h0 t
ð Þe
Pn
i¼1 biXi
Where t is the survival time, h(t, X) is the hazard function, h0(t) is the baseline hazard, Xi is a
potential prognostic variable, and bi indicates the strength of the association between a prognostic

Cancer Biology
 variable and survival. In this model, patients have a baseline, time-dependent risk of death [h0(t)],
modified by time-independent prognostic features that either increase (bi>0) or decrease (bi<0) risk
of death. In this paper, we report Z scores, which are calculated by dividing the regression coeffi-
cient (bi) by its standard error.
Cox proportional hazards modeling was chosen for several reasons. First, unlike Kaplan-Meier
analysis, Cox models do not require the selection of a threshold or cut-off, so continuous data like
gene expression values do not need to be dichotomized. (Note that in this manuscript, Kaplan-Meier
plots are provided for visualization purposes, but the reported Z scores are always from Cox mod-
els). Secondly, Cox models can accept both continuous and discrete input data, allowing this
approach to be used to analyze both binary (e.g., mutant vs. non-mutant) and continuous (e.g., gene
copy number) genomic features. Thirdly, Cox models are amenable to both univariate (i = 1) and
multivariate (i > 1) analyses. Fourthly, Cox regression allows us to calculate Z scores and a p value
for each association, as Z scores represent the number of standard deviations from the mean of a
normal distribution. Fifthly, Z scores encode the directionality of an association: poor prognostic fac-
tors will exhibit bi values greater than 0, while favorable prognostic factors will exhibit bi values less
than 0. This allows ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ survival features to be directly compared. Sixthly, Z
scores
are

for
meta-analyses,

Seventhly, Cox proportional hazards modeling is commonly used in both previous genome-wide
survival analyses and in numerous clinical biomarkers studies (Dhanasekaran et al., 2001;
Fukuoka et al., 2011; Gentles et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005), facilitating
comparison with other biomarker discovery efforts.
To verify the underlying normality of the Z scores, we generated qq plots for gene copy number
values (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). The resulting distributions for CNAs were generally linear,
as expected, with occasional shoulders at low and high Z scores. We similarly calculated Z scores for
all genes harboring coding-sequence mutations; however, we discovered that this resulted in pla-
teaus around the origin in multiple cancer types. These aberrations were caused by the occurrence
of rare, random mutations in multiple genes that lacked any prognostic power. To eliminate these
plateaus, we experimented with different thresholds for mutational analysis. Considering only muta-
tions that occurred in a certain percentage of cancer patients diminished the appearance of the pla-
teaus, but high thresholds also eliminated from consideration mutations in a number of known
cancer drivers. We selected a 2% threshold to balance between maintaining the normality of the Z
score distribution while also retaining infrequent but significant mutations in driver genes.
Note that in many survival analysis papers, a ‘feature selection’ step is included to identify a mini-
mal number of features that can accurately identify at-risk patients. We performed an unbiased,
whole-genome analysis without feature selection, to generate a Z score for every gene and for every
feature type in the genome. No feature selection step is applied in this work.
Supplemental text 2. Survival analysis in TCGA cohorts
Patient cohorts that were assembled for the TCGA were collected in order to allow a molecular anal-
ysis of the major cancer subtypes found within the United States. Though clinical information was
collected for nearly all patients, these cohorts were not specifically chosen in order to conduct sur-
vival studies. We posit that our survival analysis is appropriate for several reasons. First, we verified
that the overall survival times of patients within the TCGA is highly consistent with national epidemi-
ological data collected by the NCI (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E). Secondly, we found that
many well-established biomarkers hold prognostic significance in TCGA cohorts, including IDH1
mutations in glioma (Figure 1—figure supplement 7), TP53 mutations in breast cancer (Figure 1—
figure supplement 3), tumor stage and grade in multiple cancer types (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 3), and more. Thirdly, we validated the survival patterns that we describe in the TCGA in sev-
eral independent patient cohorts, indicating that these are not TCGA-specific phenomena
(Figure 4). Fourthly, in an independent analysis of the quality of clinical annotations in the TCGA
(Liu et al., 2018), none of the cohort/endpoint combinations chosen for this study were classified as

 ‘not recommended for use.’ Fifthly, our efforts build upon a robust body of work that has also per-
formed survival analyses on TCGA cohorts, and, in some cases, similarly validated findings from the
TCGA in independent patient populations (Andor et al., 2016; Davoli et al., 2017; Gentles et al.,
2015; Guinney et al., 2015; Uhlen et al., 2017). Finally, we note that the TCGA has several benefits
over standard investigator-initiated survival studies. Patient samples were collected and analyzed in
an unbiased manner, precluding the possibility of the ‘file-drawer problem’ (failing to publish nega-
tive results) or post-hoc sample size adjustment (ending patient enrollment when a significant result
is found). Significantly more molecular data is available from TCGA tumors than in any other compa-
rably-sized dataset, which allows for multivariate and correlational analyses of different facets of
tumor genomes. All data from the TCGA and all code from this manuscript are publicly-available,
allowing easy replication and extension upon this analysis.
