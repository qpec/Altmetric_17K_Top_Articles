Abstract
Background—Few remedies effectively treat long-term pain and disability from knee 
osteoarthritis. Studies suggest that Tai Chi alleviates symptoms, but no trials have directly 
compared Tai Chi with standard therapies for osteoarthritis.
Objective—To compare Tai Chi with standard physical therapy for patients with knee 
osteoarthritis.
Design—Randomized, 52-week, single-blind comparative effectiveness trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT01258985)
Setting—An urban tertiary care academic hospital.
Patients—204 participants with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (mean age, 60 years; 70% 
women; 53% white).
Intervention—Tai Chi (2 times per week for 12 weeks) or standard physical therapy (2 times per 
week for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of monitored home exercise).
Measurements—The primary outcome was Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included physical 
function, depression, medication use, and quality of life.
Results—At 12 weeks, the WOMAC score was substantially reduced in both groups (Tai Chi, 
167 points [95% CI, 145 to 190 points]; physical therapy, 143 points [CI, 119 to 167 points]). The 
between-group difference was not significant (24 points [CI, −10 to 58 points]). Both groups also 
showed similar clinically significant improvement in most secondary outcomes, and the benefits 
were maintained up to 52 weeks. Of note, the Tai Chi group had significantly greater 
improvements in depression and the physical component of quality of life. The benefit of Tai Chi 
was consistent across instructors. No serious adverse events occurred.
Limitation—Patients were aware of their treatment group assignment, and the generalizability of 
the findings to other settings remains undetermined.
Conclusion—Tai Chi produced beneficial effects similar to those of a standard course of 
physical therapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.
Primary Funding Source—National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the 
National Institutes of Health.
Knee osteoarthritis is a major age-related public health problem and a leading cause of long-
term pain and disability (1, 2). No effective medical treatments for the disease currently 
exist. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are commonly 
used to treat osteoarthritis but often fail to relieve symptoms and may cause serious adverse 
effects (3). Physical therapy, a globally recommended element of the standard care regimen

 for knee osteoarthritis, produces moderate benefits for pain and physical functioning, but 
data on psychological well-being and durability effects are limited (4, 5). Identifying new 
and effective treatments for patients with knee osteoarthritis is an urgent clinical and public 
health priority.
Tai Chi is a multicomponent traditional Chinese mind–body practice that combines 
meditation with slow, gentle, graceful movements; deep diaphragmatic breathing; and 
relaxation (6). Previous studies have indicated that Tai Chi can reduce pain and improve 
physical and psychological health among patients with chronic rheumatic disorders, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia (7–13). In our previous randomized trial, participants 
with knee osteoarthritis who completed 12 weeks of Tai Chi showed greater improvements 
in pain, physical function, depression, and health status compared with an attention control 
group (12). A 2013 updated meta-analysis of 7 studies that included 348 participants with 
osteoarthritis showed significant reductions in pain and improvements in physical function 
after 8 to 24 weeks of Tai Chi training compared with a waiting list, attention control, or 
usual physical activity (14).
Those prior trials suggested that Tai Chi could provide a practical exercise regimen with an 
integrative mind–body approach to manage knee osteoarthritis. The physical component 
provides exercise benefits that are consistent with recommendations for knee osteoarthritis 
(physical function, balance, and muscle strength) (15), and the mind component promotes 
psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and improved perceptions of health (9, 16). To 
date, however, no randomized trials have directly compared Tai Chi and standard care 
treatments. The primary goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Tai Chi 
versus a physical therapy regimen among a large sample of patients with symptomatic and 
radiographic knee osteoarthritis who were seen in the clinical setting and followed for 12 
months.
METHODS
Design Overview
This 52-week, single-blind, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial recruited 
participants with symptomatic and radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomly 
assigned to either Tai Chi (2 times per week for 12 weeks) or physical therapy in a clinical 
setting (2 times per week for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of rigorously monitored home 
exercise).
Details of the trial design and conduct have been published (17) and registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01258985). The study was approved by the Tufts Health Sciences 
Institutional Review Board and overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring 
board.
Setting and Participants
The trial was conducted at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, between October 
2010 and September 2014. Participants were recruited through multimodal strategies,

 including print advertisements, online media, a booth at a senior exposition, and a clinical 
patient database. We obtained informed consent before baseline assessments for eligibility.
We enrolled persons aged 40 years or older who met American College of Rheumatology 
criteria for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and had radiographic evidence of tibiofemoral or 
patellofemoral osteoarthritis (defined as the presence of a definite osteophyte in the 
tibiofemoral compartment and/or the patellofemoral compartment, as assessed on standing 
anterior–posterior and lateral or sunrise views) (18). All participants were required to have a 
score of 40 or greater on at least 1 of the 5 questions in the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale (range of 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating greater pain) at baseline. A study rheumatologist (W.H.) confirmed 
eligibility of applicants.
We excluded persons who had participated in Tai Chi or physical therapy in the past year; 
those with current serious medical conditions, such as dementia, symptomatic heart or 
vascular disease, or recent stroke, that would limit full participation; those with intra-
articular steroid or intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections in the past 3 or 6 months or 
reconstructive surgery before baseline screening on the most severely affected knee; and 
those with a score less than 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (19). Participants who 
satisfied eligibility criteria were offered enrollment.
Randomization
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Tai Chi or physical therapy after the 
baseline evaluation. Randomization was done in 9 consecutive cycles, comprising about 20 
participants each. Within each block of patients randomly assigned in each cycle, those 
assigned to Tai Chi were further randomly assigned to 1 of 3 instructors so that each 
instructor treated 1 group every 3 blocks. This design allowed for assessment of instructor-
level effects. Pseudorandom numbers were generated in advance by the statistician (C.S.) 
using the R statistical package (20). Assignments were concealed in sealed, opaque 
envelopes with date and signature labels. The study coordinator opened the consecutive 
envelopes individually after obtaining consent and confirming eligibility.
Research study nurses, physical function assessors, and sponsor personnel were blinded to 
the treatment assignments during enrollment. The blinded assessors did not have access to 
the data until data collection was complete.
Interventions
Tai Chi and physical therapy ran concurrently to minimize seasonal influences on disease 
activity. We encouraged participants to maintain routine activities but refrain from new 
exercises outside the study. Both groups received educational information about the 
importance of physical activity and home practice. We tracked reasons for missed sessions 
and asked participants to complete daily logs indicating duration of practice. Participants 
were encouraged to integrate at least 30 minutes of Tai Chi or physical therapy into their 
daily routine throughout follow-up. Attendance was monitored during each in-person 
session by using attendance forms and sign-in sheets. Study staff made monthly calls to 
monitor adherence throughout the 1-year follow-up.

 Tai Chi—The 60-minute Tai Chi sessions occurred twice per week for 12 weeks. We 
recruited 3 experienced Tai Chi instructors from the greater Boston area. We developed a 
standardized classical Yang style Tai Chi protocol for knee osteoarthritis that was based on 
the literature (13). Before study initiation, the principal investigator (C.W.) and the Tai Chi 
master (R.R., who was also 1 of the 3 instructors) reviewed the concepts of knee 
osteoarthritis and trained the other instructors (17, 21). In the first session, participants 
received printed materials on Tai Chi principles, practice techniques, and safety precautions. 
The instructor explained mind–body exercise theory and procedures. Subsequent sessions 
started with a warm-up and a review of Tai Chi principles and movement, breathing 
techniques, and relaxation methods. Participants were instructed to practice Tai Chi at home 
for at least 20 minutes per day. The principal investigator monitored all sessions by regularly 
reviewing video recordings and providing feedback throughout the study. After completing 
the 12-week intervention (24 sessions), participants were instructed to continue Tai Chi 
practice for 52 weeks with the aid of provided homework materials.
Physical Therapy—The physical therapy protocol followed U.S. guidelines for knee 
osteoarthritis treatment (15) and consisted of two 30-minute outpatient sessions per week for 
6 weeks. Before enrollment, the supervising physical therapist (M.I.) trained the 3 physical 
therapists. She observed evaluations and interventions during each treatment cycle to ensure 
consistency in documentation and provided feedback for program progression (17). 
Depending on the diagnostic findings in the initial musculoskeletal examination, the 
therapist targeted physical therapy regimens to address specific treatment goals developed 
collaboratively with the participant. At each session, the physical therapist examined the 
participant for adverse signs and symptoms before proceeding with manual therapy or 
exercise. Patients were encouraged to also perform exercises at home. After 6 weeks, 
participants were instructed to continue exercises in 30-minute sessions 4 times per week for 
6 weeks. These were monitored weekly by telephone by using standardized forms to 
ascertain frequency, exercises completed, adverse events, and adherence.
Outcomes and Follow-up
Knee osteoarthritis outcomes, which were measured at baseline and 12, 24, and 52 weeks, 
were drawn from the core set recommended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society 
International (OARSI) and focused on pain, physical function, and patients’ overall 
assessment of their disease severity (22).
Primary Outcome—The primary outcome was the change in WOMAC pain subscale 
score between baseline and 12 weeks. The WOMAC is a validated, self-administered visual 
analogue scale designed specifically to evaluate osteoarthritis symptoms (23).
Secondary Outcomes—Secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12, 24, and 
52 weeks and included WOMAC physical function and stiffness scores, Patient Global 
Assessment score, Beck Depression Inventory-II score (24), scores on the physical and 
mental components of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (25), Arthritis Self-
Efficacy Scale score (26), and results of the 6-minute walk test (27) and the 20-meter walk 
test (28). We also assessed participants’ expectations of their respective interventions by 
Wang et al.

 using the Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale (29). We will report other secondary 
outcomes, such as muscle strength and power and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System measures, in separate articles.
Monitoring of Adverse Events—We monitored study participants for adverse events 
during each encounter. Participants were also provided a study telephone number for 
reporting of adverse events throughout the study. We defined serious adverse events as those 
that were fatal, life-threatening, permanently disabling, or severely incapacitating or that 
required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization.
Medication Use—Participants were permitted to continue using routine medications, such 
as NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and maintain their usual physician visits throughout the 
study. Participants were not required to discontinue use of their pain medications before 
formal assessment visits. We kept a written record of changes in use of analgesics and 
NSAIDs throughout the entire intervention and evaluation period. We did not change or 
recommend changes in medical therapy.
Criteria for Clinical Response—We used the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria 
(30) to indicate clinically meaningful improvement. The WOMAC pain and function 
subscores were converted to scales of 0 to 100 by dividing by 5 and 17, respectively. Patient 
Global Assessment scores were multiplied by 10 to convert to a scale of 0 to 100. Clinical 
response was defined as either 1) improvement of at least 50% in pain or function and an 
absolute change of at least 20 points on a scale of 0 to 100 in the WOMAC pain or function 
subscores, or 2) at least 2 of the following criteria: improvement of at least 20% and an 
absolute change greater than 10 points on a scale of 0 to 100 in the WOMAC pain score, 
improvement of at least 20% and an absolute change greater than 10 points on a scale of 0 to 
100 in the WOMAC function score, or improvement of at least 20% in the Patient Global 
Assessment score and an absolute change greater than 10 points on a scale of 0 to 100.
Statistical Analysis
This study was designed to test Tai Chi for noninferiority and then for superiority if 
noninferiority was established with regard to the primary outcome (change in WOMAC pain 
score at 12 weeks). Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of effects observed in 2 prior 
knee osteoarthritis trials. The first of these showed an 80-point improvement in pain for 
physical therapy strength training compared with an attention control (31), and the second 
(our pilot trial [12]) found a 150-point improvement in pain for the Tai Chi group. We 
estimated the difference between these interventions to be 70 points (SD, 100). The 
noninferiority margin was set at 20 points (32) for the primary outcome of WOMAC pain 
score. To have 80% power for superiority with regard to this primary outcome (2-sided 
significance level of 0.05) and noninferiority with a margin of indifference of 20 points 
using a 1-sided significance level of 0.05 (32), and under the assumption of a 15% dropout 
rate, the study required 90 patients in each treatment group.
All analyses used all randomly assigned patients under the intention-to-treat assumption. For 
all outcomes, we fit longitudinal models incorporating all values recorded for each patient at

 baseline and 12, 24, and 52 weeks with a term for the interaction between treatment and 
each time point to assess differences in the effect of treatment over time. For continuous 
outcomes, we assumed normally distributed errors with an unstructured covariance matrix 
and used restricted maximum likelihood estimation. For binary outcomes, we used a 
generalized linear mixed model with random intercepts.
Preliminary analyses examined the association of missingness with baseline predictors and 
longitudinal outcomes. Participants who were lost to follow-up after completing the 
intervention had worse outcomes than those who remained in the study, thus invalidating the 
missing-completely-at-random assumption required for complete-case analysis. Several 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of missing data, including multiple 
imputation and adjustment for variables that were found to differ among participants who 
missed visits. These analyses are described in detail in Appendix Table 1 (available at 
www.annals.org).
We also explored several types of interactions. Two of these were of primary interest: the 
interaction of time with treatment, which indicates whether treatment has an effect, and the 
effect of instructor within the Tai Chi group. Potential 3-way interactions of treatment and 
time with 14 covariates (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], education, marital status, 
employment, living alone, NSAID or analgesic use, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, 
weight, and class attendance) were examined to explore whether they modified the effect of 
treatment across time.
We used 2-sided tests at a significance level of 0.05 for all primary efficacy and interaction 
analyses. For the exploratory interactions, we used a significance level of 0.01 to protect 
against false-positive interactions. Results are presented as between-group differences with 
95% CIs based on estimates from the longitudinal models. All model assumptions were 
checked with standard regression diagnostic evaluations (33).
All analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R.

RESULTS
Between March 2011 and June 2013, a total of 1195 patients were screened by telephone 
and 282 (23.6%) qualified for baseline evaluation. Of these, 204 (72.3%) consented, met 
inclusion criteria, and were randomly assigned to Tai Chi or physical therapy in 9 cycles 
(Figure 1).
Table 1 shows baseline data for the 204 participants. The mean age was 60 years, 70% were 
women, the racial/ethnic composition was diverse (53% white), and the mean BMI was 33 
kg/m2. The average duration of knee osteoarthritis was 8 years. Participants were well-
balanced between groups at baseline with respect to age, sex, race, BMI, scores of

 radiographic severity (Kellgren-Lawrence grade), WOMAC pain score, Beck Depression 
Inventory-II score, physical function, SF-36 score, and expectations of benefit from their 
randomly assigned regimen.
Overall attendance rates were 74% for Tai Chi and 81% for physical therapy for participants 
who attended at least 1 class during the 12-week intervention. Seventy-nine percent of Tai 
Chi participants and 78% of physical therapy participants attended at least 50% of the 
sessions (Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals.org). One hundred sixty-seven (82%) 
participants completed their evaluation at 12 weeks, 153 (75%) completed their evaluation at 
24 weeks, and 141 (69%) completed their evaluation at 52 weeks.
Table 2 shows changes from baseline at 12, 24, and 52 weeks in the 2 groups for all 
continuous outcomes, and Table 3 gives results for the 2 binary outcomes (NSAID and 
analgesic use). Results in both tables are unadjusted for covariates. For the primary outcome, 
both groups had improved WOMAC pain scores at 12 weeks (Tai Chi, 167 points [95% CI, 
145 to 190 points]; physical therapy, 143 points [CI, 119 to 167 points]). The treatment 
groups did not differ significantly in pain at 12 weeks (mean difference, 24 points [CI, −10 
to 58 points]). Both groups showed similar improvements in most secondary outcomes at 12 
weeks and in all outcomes at 24 and 52 weeks. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the 12-
week WOMAC pain score indicated that physical therapy was highly likely to be superior to 
Tai Chi by no more than 10 points, well within the noninferiority margin of 20 points.
The Tai Chi group showed greater improvement than the physical therapy group for most 
outcomes, but these differences were not statistically significant except for the SF-36 
physical component summary and the Beck Depression Inventory-II scores. Figure 2 shows 
the between-group mean differences for all outcomes at all time points. Results were similar 
after adjustment for BMI, which was higher among those who dropped out.
Regression diagnostic evaluations indicated that some observations had large residuals. 
Transformation of some outcomes to the logarithmic scale reduced the number of outliers 
but did not qualitatively change results, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II score 
remained significant in favor of Tai Chi. Results of analyses on the logarithmic scale are 
shown in Appendix Table 3 (available at www.annals.org).
Both treatment groups had high proportions of participants meeting OARSI response 
criteria. For the Tai Chi group, the proportions at 12, 24, and 52 weeks were 72%, 67%, and 
49%, respectively. For the physical therapy group, the corresponding percentages were 63%, 
48%, and 51%.
Only 1 of the 154 interactions among the 14 covariates with 11 separate outcomes 
(attendance rate and WOMAC pain score) was significant at the 0.01 level. Effects were 
consistent across Tai Chi instructors. Although use of NSAIDs and analgesics in the 7 days 
before the evaluation visit was generally lower than at baseline at all follow-up times in each 
treatment group, these reductions did not statistically significantly differ between groups 
over time (Table 3). No serious adverse events were observed.

 Comparisons of baseline characteristics between participants with missing versus complete 
data at each evaluation visit revealed differences by race, BMI, analgesic use, 6-minute walk 
test result, and SF-36 physical component summary score (Appendix Table 4, available at 
www.annals.org). Several sensitivity analyses were done to examine the effect of missing 
observations (Appendix Table 1). Adjustment for these variables in the longitudinal analyses 
did not change any of our results. Additional sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation 
and assigning no effect to participants missing the 12-week visit also yielded results similar 
to those described in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
This comparative effectiveness trial of 2 active therapies showed that despite a substantial 
difference in intensity of contact for participants between groups, Tai Chi and physical 
therapy each confer clinically significant improvements in pain and related health outcomes 
by 12 weeks, with the benefits maintained up to 52 weeks. Both treatment groups showed 
similar improvement in most secondary outcomes, but the Tai Chi group had significantly 
greater improvements in depression and the physical component of quality of life. Of note, 
the benefit of Tai Chi was consistent across experienced instructors treating patients with 
knee osteoarthritis.
A major strength of this trial is the enrollment of a representative sample of participants with 
knee osteoarthritis, including older and obese persons with risk factors and comorbidities 
commonly associated with the disease (34). Such persons typically face limited options due 
to ineffectiveness of and contraindications to osteoarthritis treatments. Indeed, the overall 
positive findings among adults who were representative of those seen in routine practice 
strengthen the evidence that the effectiveness and durability of both Tai Chi and physical 
therapy extend to obese older adults with knee osteoarthritis. Of note, instead of using 
inactive comparators, our study directly compared the effectiveness of 2 therapies that were 
each known to have health benefits for knee osteoarthritis, and the study had high adherence 
to assigned treatments and high follow-up rates. In addition, we found no difference in 
effectiveness among the Tai Chi instructors, implying that the intervention can be delivered 
standardly and effectively by appropriately trained instructors.
Our results are commensurate with our prior attention-controlled study (12) and with other 
studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of Tai Chi compared with various interventions 
for pain and physical and mental health over a range of chronic conditions (7–13). By 
integrating physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and behavioral elements, Tai Chi 
may systematically promote health by its effect on both the body and the mind. For example, 
pain has been found to correlate with the degree of quadriceps muscle weakness in knee 
osteoarthritis (35, 36). The physical exercise associated with Tai Chi enhances muscular 
strength, cardiovascular fitness, endurance, and coordination, thus improving functional 
capacity and joint stability (12, 13). In addition, central nervous system factors have recently 
been recognized as playing a prominent role in influencing osteoarthritis pain perception 
(37). Tai Chi may elicit behavioral responses by activating neuroendocrine and autonomic 
functioning and navigating neurochemical and analgesic pathways, which in turn may 
modulate the inflammatory response of the immune system and modify susceptibility to

 chronic pain (38, 39). Furthermore, by improving self-efficacy, social function, and 
depression, Tai Chi can help patients bolster their self-confidence and overcome their fear of 
pain (the latter of which often leads to physical malfunction and debility [7]).
Limitations of this research include patients’ awareness of their treatment group assignment 
and preconceived notions of treatment benefit potentially influencing their health and 
functional outcomes. For a study involving complex, multicomponent mind–body therapy, 
searching for and finding a feasible, useful, and valid sham comparison group remains 
challenging, with no well-accepted solution (40). Our study was necessarily single-blinded, 
a design with well-known limitations. To try to mitigate the influence of preexisting beliefs 
and expectations about the relative benefits of the interventions, we explicitly informed 
potential participants that the study was designed to test the effects of 2 different types of 
exercise programs. By emphasizing equipoise, we hoped to decrease expectations and 
minimize bias by not mentioning Tai Chi specifically. Using the Outcome Expectations for 
Exercise Scale to assess the possibility of bias, we found that participants’ expectations of 
benefit from their randomly assigned treatment regimen were similar (Tai Chi, 3.9 [SD, 0.5]; 
physical therapy, 3.9 [SD, 0.6]). Furthermore, total session attendance rates were similar 
between groups (74% for Tai Chi and 81% for physical therapy). Because the trial was 
conducted in a single academic center, we did not directly evaluate the generalizability of 
this intervention to other settings.
In conclusion, the results of this comparative effectiveness trial support the supposition that 
Tai Chi, a multicomponent mind–body exercise, improves pain and well-being in patients 
with knee osteoarthritis. Despite the substantial differences in delivering a mind–body 
intervention to a group and physical therapy to individual persons, both interventions 
produced similar effects in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, standardized Tai 
Chi should be considered as an effective therapeutic option for knee osteoarthritis. Future 
examination of the disease-modifying mechanisms of successful mind–body medicine will 
better inform clinical decision making for patients with this therapeutically challenging 
disorder.

*Values are estimated means (95% CIs) from longitudinal regressions, including time, treatment, and their interaction only 
with outcome variables on a logarithmic scale. Boldface values indicate statistically significant differences between groups.
†Values are relative change, defined as follow-up score as a proportion of baseline score.
‡Values are change in Tai Chi group relative to change in physical therapy group. For example, a value of 0.95 means that 
the Tai Chi score decreased by 5% more than the physical therapy score.
§Values aligned with row headings are for the interaction of treatment group and time.
