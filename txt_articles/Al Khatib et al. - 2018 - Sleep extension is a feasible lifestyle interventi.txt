ABSTRACT
Background: Evidence suggests that short sleep duration may be
a newly identified modifiable risk factor for obesity, yet there is a
paucity of studies to investigate this.
Objective: We assessed the feasibility of a personalized sleep exten-
sion protocol in adults aged 18–64 y who are habitually short sleepers
(5 to <7 h), with sleep primarily measured by wrist actigraphy. In ad-
dition, we collected pilot data to assess the effects of extended sleep
on dietary intake and quality measured by 7-d food diaries, resting
and total energy expenditure, physical activity, and markers of car-
diometabolic health.
Design: Forty-two normal-weight healthy participants who were ha-
bitually short sleepers completed this free-living, 4-wk, parallel-
design randomized controlled trial. The sleep extension group
(n = 21) received a behavioral consultation session targeting sleep
hygiene. The control group (n = 21) maintained habitual short sleep.
Results: Rates of participation, attrition, and compliance were
100%, 6.5%, and 85.7%, respectively. The sleep extension group
significantly increased time in bed [0:55 hours:minutes (h:mm);
95% CI: 0:37, 1:12 h:mm], sleep period (0:47 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:29,
1:05 h:mm), and sleep duration (0:21 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:06,
0:36 h:mm) compared with the control group. Sleep extension led
to reduced intake of free sugars (–9.6 g; 95% CI: –16.0, –3.1 g)
compared with control (0.7 g; 95% CI: –5.7, 7.2 g) (P = 0.042).
A sensitivity analysis in plausible reporters showed that the sleep
extension group reduced intakes of fat (percentage), carbohydrates
(grams), and free sugars (grams) in comparison to the control group.
There were no significant differences between groups in markers of
energy balance or cardiometabolic health.
Conclusions: We showed the feasibility of extending sleep in adult
short sleepers. Sleep extension led to reduced free sugar intakes
and may be a viable strategy to facilitate limiting excessive con-
sumption of free sugars in an obesity-promoting environment. This
trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02787577.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is increasingly recognized as a potential modifiable risk
factor that may be involved in the complex etiology of obesity and
cardiometabolic diseases (1) and is becoming an area of increas-
ing public health concern (2). Observational studies showed links
between short sleep duration or poor sleep quality with weight
gain (3–5) and its associated cardiometabolic complications (6–
11). Today, ∼37% of US adults report sleeping ≤6 h, and less
than two-thirds are achieving the recommended 7–9 h/night for
optimal physical and mental well-being (12, 13).
Experimental evidence investigating the effects of sleep de-
privation on insulin resistance (14–16) and glucose (17–19) and
appetite hormone (20, 21) dysregulation has indicated that poor
sleep is potentially detrimental to overall health. In our recent
systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies, we
found that partial sleep deprivation caused a 385-kcal (95% CI:
252-, 517-kcal) increase in energy intake in comparison to the
control habitual sleep condition, with no compensatory effects
on energy expenditure (22). If sustained, the net positive energy
balance due to sleep deprivation may manifest in weight gain,
which was previously shown after 5 nights of restricting sleep
to 4 h (23). The majority of sleep deprivation studies to date are
highly restrictive (<5 h/night) and conducted acutely (<2 wk)
in controlled laboratory settings. Studies in ecologically valid

conditions are needed to distinguish whether laboratory evi-
dence applies to free-living conditions. Moreover, the poor di-
etary habits that are characteristic of short sleepers reported in
observational studies have been extensively reviewed (24), yet
the relation has yet to be investigated in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs).
Turning the relation the other way around, evidence from a lon-
gitudinal study in adults has shown that spontaneously shifting
sleep duration from a short to a healthier length has been asso-
ciated with attenuated fat mass gain (25). Yet, few longer-term
(≥1 mo) RCTs have assessed the effects of sleep extension (SE)
in free-living adult short sleepers, and these were mainly con-
ducted in prehypertensive individuals with the aim of improving
blood pressure (26, 27).
The aim of this research was to assess the feasibility of SE by
using a behavioral change approach targeting sleep hygiene under
free-living conditions in healthy adults who are habitually short
sleepers. Primary outcomes were objective measures of compli-
ance to the sleep hygiene intervention in order to determine the
feasibility of the SE intervention. Other feasibility measures in-
cluded rates of subject participation and attrition. If it was shown
to be feasible to extend sleep duration in a free-living population,
it was hypothesized that SE would lead to changes in secondary
outcome measures that are conducive to maintenance of weight
and cardiometabolic health. To test this hypothesis, the secondary
aim of the study was to conduct a pilot investigation on the ef-
fects of SE on dietary intake and indicators of energy balance.
Exploratory analyses of markers of cardiometabolic risk, appetite
hormones, and heart rate variability were included to provide pre-
liminary data for use in planning sample sizes in future, larger SE
intervention studies.
METHODS
Experimental design
The Sleep Lengthening and Metabolic health, Body composi-
tion, Energy balance and cardiovascular Risk (SLuMBER) Study
is an open-label, 4-wk parallel-design RCT investigating the fea-
sibility of SE in habitually short sleepers and its effects on di-
etary intake, energy balance, and cardiometabolic health indica-
tors in comparison to a control, habitual short sleep condition.
The protocol was approved by the King’
s College London (KCL)
Research Ethics Committee (HR-15/16-2172) and conducted in
line with the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial is registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02787577).
Participants
Healthy men and women aged 18–64 y and with a BMI (in
kg/m2) of 18.5 to <30 were recruited by using internal circular
e-mails among KCL staff and students, as well as social media
advertisements and recruitment posters that were publicly avail-
able. Respondents to advertisements were initially screened by
telephone or e-mail questionnaires. Inclusion criteria as assessed
by the screening questionnaire specified healthy men and women
with a BMI of 18.5 to <30 who were habitual short sleepers, de-
fined as a self-reported average sleep duration of 5 to <7 h/night
on weeknights, which was confirmed with the use of baseline
actigraphy measurements. Exclusion criteria included the follow-
ing: diagnosed medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease,
type 1 or 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic liver or renal disease, inflam-
matory bowel disease, and thyroid conditions. Participants were
also excluded if they reported a weight change >3 kg in the pre-
vious 2 mo, substance or alcohol abuse (>28 units/wk for men;
>21 units/wk for women), use of antidepressants or chronic use
of sleep medication, smoking, shift work, habitual napping, an
obligation to wake up at night to care for others, and an inability
to adhere to a sleep intervention due to time commitments. Partic-
ipants with an extreme chronotype according to the Morningness-
Eveningness questionnaire (28) (defined as a score of ≥70 or
≤30) were excluded from the study. Those at a high risk of low
mood or any sleep-related disorders according to the Center of
Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES-D) (29), the Ep-
worth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (30), the Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI) (31), or the Berlin Questionnaire for sleep apnea (32) were
excluded from the study.
Eligible participants were then invited for a clinical screening
visit where their BMI was evaluated, and a fasted blood sample
was taken to analyze liver function, glucose, lipids, and hema-
tology at an accredited clinical biochemistry laboratory (ViaPath,
King’
s College Hospital) on the same day. Written informed con-
sent was obtained before any measures were taken. Eligible par-
ticipants were enrolled in the study. All of the visits were sched-
uled such that no participants had trans-meridian travel within
4 wk of commencing the study. Participants received travel reim-
bursements (≤£10/visit) and were compensated £75 upon com-
pletion of the study.
Clinical visits and study measures, and randomization
All of the clinical visits were conducted in the Metabolic Re-
search Unit at KCL, Waterloo Campus. All outcomes of the study
were assessed at baseline (before randomization) and at endpoint
during the fourth week of the study, as shown in Figure 1.
Participants attended 2 clinical study visits at baseline and
again at the endpoint. At the first visit, participants were fitted
with a wrist actigraph (MotionWatch8; CamNTech Ltd.) to wear
on their nondominant wrist for 7 d (7 nights). Participants were
asked to log their sleep and wake times in 7-d sleep diaries and
to complete a 7-d food diary. To measure total energy expendi-
ture (TEE), participants were fitted with an Actiheart (CamNTech
Ltd.), a small, light-weight, chest-worn unit that combines a heart
rate monitor and accelerometer to wear for 48 h. Participants then
completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (33) to as-
sess eating behavior, in addition to other questionnaires outlined
below.
The second clinical visit was scheduled a minimum of 8 d after
the first visit. Participants arrived after a 12-h overnight fast and
were instructed to refrain from intense physical exercise for the
previous 24 h. Baseline wrist actigraphy measures were appraised
to confirm that participants were short sleepers. Height was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.01 m. Body composition was measured with
the use of a segmental bioelectric impedance analyzer (Tanita
BC-418; Tanita Corporation of America, Inc.). Three waist cir-
cumference measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm at the midpoint
between the lowest rib and iliac crest were taken to obtain an av-
erage. Participants were then instructed to lie on a bed in a semire-
cumbent position and remain relaxed but awake for 20 min before
resting metabolic rate (RMR) assessment. RMR was measured
by indirect calorimetry with the use of the FitMate (CosMed), a
previously validated (34, 35) metabolic analyzer that measures

oxygen consumption under a hood to estimate energy expendi-
ture. Pulse Trace (Micro Medical Ltd.), a portable digital volume
pulse machine that uses photoplethysmography in a finger-clip
probe attached to the participant’
s index finger, assessed vascu-
lar function over a 15-s period. Recordings were taken in trip-
licate, and an average was calculated. Blood pressure measure-
ments were then taken in triplicate with the use of an A&D Med-
ical UA-767 Plus auto upper arm blood pressure monitor, in ac-
cordance with the British Hypertension Society Guidelines (36).
A fasting blood sample was taken and processed on the same day;
aliquots were then stored at −80°C for later analysis.
Upon completion of all measurements, participants were ran-
domly assigned (1:1), with stratification to minimize the dif-
ference between groups for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity (per-
formed by MinimPy 0.3 randomization computer program ac-
cessed at https://sourceforge.net/projects/minimpy/) by the re-
searchers, and informed whether they were enrolled to the SE
group or to a control group. The SE group received an SE inter-
vention, as detailed below. The control group was asked to resume
their lifestyle as usual, and informed that they would receive the
intervention session upon completion of the study.
SE intervention
The SE intervention entailed a personalized sleep consulta-
tion session (∼45 min), with the goal of extending time in bed
(TIB) by 1–1.5 h/night. The intervention was designed in con-
sultation with a health psychologist to focus on improving par-
ticipants’ sleep hygiene with the use of evidence-based behav-
ior change techniques by consulting the “Coventry, Aberdeen &
London - Refined” (CALO-RE) taxonomy (37). The personal-
ized consultation session was delivered with the use of a script
to standardize the sessions. First, the importance of sleep, cur-
rent sleep recommendations (7–9 h), and the concept of sleep
hygiene were explained to the participant. Participants were in-
formed that the success of the intervention was dependent on the
consultant and the participant working together to design a strat-
egy that could most feasibly be implemented in the participant’
s
current lifestyle. Next, the participant was provided with a list
of sleep hygiene behaviors that was formulated with guidance
from publicly accessible resources, such as the Harvard Division
of Sleep Medicine’
s Twelve Simple Tips to Improve Your Sleep
(38) and the National Sleep Foundation (39), American Sleep As-
sociation (40), and the UK National Health Service (41) web-
sites. With regard to sleep hygiene practices that are of relevance
to diet, participants were informed that excessive caffeine intake
late in the day, as well as going to bed too full or too hungry,
could disrupt their ability to go to sleep. The consultant reviewed
all of the sleep hygiene behaviors with the participant and encour-
aged the participant to identify any that were relevant to his or her
lifestyle. The participants were then supported with a selection of
a minimum of 4 sleep hygiene behaviors they felt were most ap-
plicable and easily implemented in their lifestyle, and these were
documented in a personalized sleep diary for their own reference.
Participants identified barriers (37) to achieving their selected be-
haviors, and were assisted to create implementation intentions
(37) that were also noted in the personalized sleep diary. Partic-
ipants were prescribed a recommended bedtime to increase their
TIB, and this was outlined as a “behavioral contract” (37), which
lists the agreed-on selected behaviors and bedtimes. Participants
completed the sleep diary by noting sleep and wake times and
indicated whether they achieved the selected sleep hygiene be-
haviors on the day for self-monitoring (37) purposes throughout
the duration of their intervention period.
Sleep assessment
Sleep was assessed objectively by wrist actigraphy, which has
been validated against the gold standard for sleep assessment,
polysomnography (42). The MotionWatch8 was programmed to
record motions every 30-s epoch and set at a threshold of 20 s to
distinguish sleep from waking, because this high-sensitivity set-
ting yielded the clearest agreement with a polysomnography val-
idation study (43, 44). While wearing the wrist actigraph, partic-
ipants were asked to push an “event marker” button on the device
to indicate their intention to go to sleep and again when they woke
up in the morning with no intent to return to sleep. Recordings
were downloaded to the MotionWare Software (CamNTech) for
analysis. Participants’ sleep diaries and event marks were used
to define the TIB period on the software (from “lights out” to
“got up”). Once this sleep region was selected, the software auto-
matically calculated the times at which participants “fell asleep”
and “woke up” to define “sleep period.” “Sleep duration” was
automatically defined as the total time spent asleep according

to epoch-by-epoch sleep/wake categorization within the sleep
period, therefore excluding time awake. “Sleep latency” was the
time between “lights out” and “fell asleep.” “Sleep efficiency”
was calculated as sleep duration expressed as a percentage of
TIB. “Sleep duration (%)” was sleep duration expressed as a per-
centage of sleep period. Sleep Fragmentation Index (SFI) denotes
the degree of sleep fragmentation, where a higher SFI indicates
poorer sleep quality. A 7-d average was calculated for each sleep
variable.
Subjective measures of sleep quality were also assessed with
the use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (45). The Sleep Hy-
giene Index (46) was used to verify adherence to behaviors of
sleep hygiene.
Dietary assessment
To assess dietary intake, we used 7-d estimated food di-
aries that resembled the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey
Rolling Program diaries (47), with predefined time slots for food
intake. Estimated food diaries were selected, because this method
was deemed to show the greatest magnitude of agreement of nu-
merous nutrients against the gold standard of self-reported dietary
intake, the weighed food diary (Spearman rank = 0.35–0.83) in
comparison to food-frequency questionnaire (Spearman rank =
0.39–0.57) and 24-h recall (Spearman rank = 0.21–0.63) (48).
Moreover, intakes reported in the estimated diaries showed good
correlation with 24-h urinary excretion of nitrogen and potassium
(Spearman rank = 0.65 and 0.66, respectively) (48) and have been
shown to provide better estimates than food-frequency question-
naires (49). Estimated rather than weighed food diaries were used
due to their utility in the free-living setting, as well as to mini-
mize participant burden. Participants were instructed to provide
as much detail as possible about all food, drinks, and supple-
ments consumed, and encouraged to attach packaging. Portion
sizes were reported using household measures or in grams, as
well as estimated with the use of visual guide portion-size pho-
tographs included in the diary. Mean daily intakes were analyzed
with the use of Nutritics (Nutritics Professional Diet Analysis,
version 3.74; Nutritics Ltd.), which incorporates McCance and
Widdowson’
s 6th edition of The Composition of Foods. Seven-
day averages were calculated for all nutrients and were assessed
in grams as well as percentages of total energy, where appro-
priate. Dietary misreporters were identified with the use of pre-
viously outlined methods by McCrory et al. (50) for sensitivity
analysis on plausible reporters with the use of 2-SD cutoffs.
Diet quality and UK dietary guidelines adherence
assessment
Because there is currently no diet quality index available in the
United Kingdom, we used the Eating Choices Index (51) and for-
mulated a composite score to assess adherence to the UK dietary
guidelines (52, 53) with the use of the 7-d food diaries. The fol-
lowing 6 UK dietary guidelines were used: 5 portions of fruit and

vegetables, ≥30 g fiber, <6 g salt, <11% of energy from satu-
rated fat, <5% of energy from free sugars, and ≥2 portions of
fish/wk (≥1 of which is oily). Each of the 7 d of the food diary
was scored such that participants received a score of “1” if they
met the daily requirement for the given category and “0” if not.
However, because guidelines for fish intake are weekly and not
daily, a score of 3.5 was given if ≥2 portions of fish were con-
sumed and 3.5 was given if ≥1 portion of fish was oily in order
to avoid over- or underrepresenting this category. The maximum
score for each category was 7, and summed across the 7 d; the
overall maximum adherence score was 42, where a higher score
indicates a healthier diet that complies more closely with the cur-
rent guidelines.
TEE and physical activity assessment
The Actiheart has been previously validated against doubly la-
beled water (54, 55), a gold standard for the assessment of TEE
in free-living conditions. The monitor was fitted to the chest with
the use of 2 electrocardiogram electrodes (SP-50, 50 mm round;
Pulse Medical) for attachment. Before placement of electrodes,
the skin was shaved of any chest hair and wiped with the use of
alcohol wipes to clean, and an abrasive pad (Unilect) was used
to remove the top layer of skin cells. A signal test was recorded
to confirm the quality of the signal. In addition, a step-test was
performed to measure participants’heart rate recovery, allowing
for calibration of the recordings to participants’fitness level. The
48-h recordings were programmed by using the short-term inter-
beat intervals application, allowing for analysis of heart rate vari-
ability parameters, a measure of autonomic function, as outlined
previously (56). Data were processed and analyzed with the use
of the Actiheart software (version 4.0.116; CamNTech Ltd.).
Physical activity intensity was analyzed with the use of the
MotionWatch8 with the use of MotionWare software’
s Daytime
analysis application. Seven-day average active times spent in vig-
orous, moderate, low, and sedentary activity that were determined
by the software were extracted and calculated as a percentage of
time spent awake or in “active time” as defined by the software.
Circulating markers of cardiometabolic risk
All of the analyses were conducted on stored (−80°C) serum
and plasma samples. Serum nonesterified fatty acids (RANDOX
NEFA kit), serum cholesterol profile (IL Test; Instrumentation
Laboratory Ltd.), plasma triglycerides (IL Test), and plasma glu-
cose (Glucose Oxidase kit) were determined with the use of en-
zymatic colorimetric assays on the ILAB 650 Clinical Chemical
System (Instrumentation Laboratory Ltd.). Immunoassays were
conducted by using the ADVIA 2400 analyzer (Siemens Health-
care Diagnostics Ltd.) to measure concentrations of serum in-
sulin (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd.), serum c-peptide
(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd.), serum cortisol (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd.), serum leptin (Quantikine ELISA
kits, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), and plasma ghrelin (Ghre-
lin RIA kit; Millipore Corporation). We used the HOMA-IR (57),
where the product of fasting glucose and fasting insulin is an in-
dex of insulin resistance. This was calculated as follows: HOMA-
IR = [fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mU/L)]/22.5.
Statistical analyses
A sample size of n = 40 participants (20 participants/group)
was determined to be sufficient for investigating the feasibility of
the SE protocol (58, 59) and to gain SD data to inform statistical
power calculations for future RCTs. Primary outcomes included
measures of sleep duration (TIB, sleep period, and sleep dura-
tion). Rates of participation and attrition were also calculated as
feasibility outcomes (58, 59). The intervention was to be deemed
feasible if sleep duration was extended, the attrition rate was
<20% (95% CI: 8%, 30%), and ≥80% (95% CI: 68%, 92%) of
all recruited participants completed follow-up. All data were ana-
lyzed with the use of a modified intention-to-treat analysis, where
missing data due to technical difficulties with equipment or in-
ability to draw blood were not included in the analysis. Data were
tested for normality by visual evaluation of histograms and Q-Q
plots and confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-normally dis-
tributed data were log-transformed and retested; nonparametric
analysis was applied if data still did not conform to a normal dis-
tribution. Participant characteristics were assessed with the use
of an independent-samples t test in order to detect significant

applied to assess nominal data. Sleep variables were analyzed by
ANCOVA on the change from baseline, with baseline values in-
cluded as a covariate.
The secondary outcomes were assessed with the use of
ANCOVA on change from baseline, and covariates included were
baseline measures for the given outcome, as well as the change

Of the 46 participants eligible for the study, 46 (100%) en-
rolled, and 43 completed the study, as shown in Figure 2. One
participant was removed from all analyses due to technical diffi-
culties with the wrist actigraphy device, and therefore the inabil-
ity to adjust for compliance (change from baseline in TIB) for
secondary outcomes. There was a 6.5% rate of attrition, because 3
participants dropped out from the study during baseline measure-
ments due to time constraints before being informed of the treat-
ment group to which they were allocated. There were no dropouts
after random assignment to treatment. Baseline wrist actigraphy
measures indicated the all of the enrolled participants were short
sleepers, and therefore none were excluded. There were no dif-
ferences in the distribution of sex, age, ethnicity, or BMI across
groups, confirming that the stratified randomization was success-
ful, as indicated in Table 1. BMI in both groups was within the
normal healthy range (18.4–24.9). There were no significant dif-
ferences at screening for fasting blood glucose or blood lipid
profile between groups, and mean values were within normal
ranges. There were no significant differences between groups in
scores for screening questionnaires used to detect sleep disor-
ders (Horne-Ostberg, Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepi-
ness Scale) and risk of depressed mood (Center of Epidemio-
logic Studies–Depression scale). There were no markedly pre-
dominant eating behaviors in the groups or any significant dif-
ferences across groups as assessed by the Dutch Eating Behavior
Questionnaire.
Intervention compliance
Sleep duration
The differences in outcomes of 7-d sleep duration and quality
between the SE and control groups as a result of the SE inter-
vention are outlined in Table 2. At endpoint, the change from
baseline was significantly higher in the SE group for TIB, sleep
period, and sleep duration in comparison to the control group. In
the SE group, 86% of participants increased their TIB, resulting in
50% of the group increasing their sleep duration. The SE group’
s
change from baseline in sleep duration (hours:minutes) ranged
from 00:52 to 01:28. Three participants in the SE group achieved
a weekly average sleep duration within the 7- to 9-h recommen-
dation. There were no significant differences in any measures of
sleep duration within the control group at endpoint.

Sleep quality
The changes from baseline for measures of sleep quality, in-
cluding sleep duration (percentage), sleep efficiency, and SFI, in-
dicate poorer sleep quality in the SE group than in the control
group. However, there was no significant difference in sleep la-
tency between groups as a result of the intervention. Within-group
analysis of the control group showed no significant changes in
sleep quality at endpoint.
Subjective measures of sleep and sleep hygiene
The change from baseline in the SE group’

Quality Index and Sleep Hygiene Index scores was significantly
lower in the SE group in comparison to the control group. There
were no within-group differences in the control group.
Dietary intake
The effects of the SE intervention on dietary intake are pre-
sented in Table 3. The reduction in the reported intake of free sug-
ars (grams) was significantly different from control (P = 0.042,
Cohen’
s d = 0.79). Within-group comparisons showed a sig-
nificant decrease in reported free-sugars intake (−9.6 g; 95%
CI: −16.0, −3.1 h; P = 0.002) in the SE group at the end of
the intervention period compared with baseline. The change from
baseline for the reported intake of protein (percentage of energy)
was significantly lower in the control group compared with the
SE group (P = 0.018, Cohen’
s d = 0.92); however, there was no
difference between groups in grams of protein consumed. There
were trends for a reduced intake of carbohydrates (grams; P =
0.083) and fat (percentage of energy; P = 0.074) in the SE group
in comparison to the control group.
Four implausible reporters were identified (n = 3 in the con-
trol group, n = 1 in the intervention group). A sensitivity anal-
ysis of plausible reporters showed a significantly lower change
from baseline in reported intakes of free sugars (mean differ-
ence: −11.8 g; 95% CI: −22.4, −1.1 g; P = 0.031, Cohen’
s d =
0.89), carbohydrate (mean difference: −28.5 g; 95% CI: −55.8,

Diet quality and UK dietary guidelines adherence
The change from baseline for the UK dietary guidelines adher-
ence score was significantly higher in the SE group in comparison
to the control group (P = 0.036, Cohen’
s d = 0.80) at endpoint
(Table 3). The score increase at endpoint was due to the change
from baseline in the free-sugars component of the score in the SE
group (3.3; 95% CI: 2.6, 4.0) compared with the control group
(−0.5; 95% CI: −1.3, 0.4) (P = 0.028, Cohen’
s d = 0.88). There
was no significant difference in Eating Choices Index scores be-
tween the control and intervention groups.
Anthropometric measures, energy expenditure, and physical
activity
The effects of the SE intervention on anthropometric measures,
energy expenditure, and physical activity are outlined in Table 4.
We found no significant differences at endpoint between groups
in weight, body composition, and waist circumference as a result
of the intervention. There were also no differences at endpoint
between groups’ RMR, activity, and TEE and physical activity
intensity (Table 4).
Cardiometabolic risk, appetite hormones, and heart rate
variability
There were no significant differences between groups in indi-
cators of cardiometabolic risk or appetite hormones, as shown
in Supplemental Table 1. Measures of HRV are outlined in
Supplemental Table 2, and we found no significant differences
between the SE and control groups.
DISCUSSION
This SE RCT had good rates of participation, low rates of at-
trition, and satisfactory compliance in healthy, free-living adult
short sleepers. These results show that a personalized behavioral
consultation targeting sleep hygiene is a feasible lifestyle inter-
vention and can be used to test the health effects of SE. Our pilot
investigation of secondary outcomes indicates that adherence to
advice to extend sleep may reduce free-sugars intake. No effects
were observed on indexes of body composition, energy balance,
cardiometabolic risk, appetite hormones, or heart rate variability
as a result of the intervention.
To our knowledge, this is the first long-term RCT to show
the feasibility of SE by addressing sleep hygiene under free-
living conditions in healthy adults who are habitually short sleep-
ers and uses objective measures of sleep to measure compli-
ance. Previous long-term (≥1 mo) SE trials were conducted
in prehypertensive adults (26, 27) or in overweight adults as
part of a weight-loss program (60), sometimes relying on self-
reported measures of sleep (26, 60). Previous SE interven-
tional studies in healthy, free-living short sleepers were non-
randomized (61, 62). In the present study, the intervention in-
creased TIB in the SE group, allowing for a longer sleep pe-
riod, thus increasing sleep duration in comparison to the con-
trol group; however, they did not achieve the recommended
7–9 h of sleep. We also found that objective measures of sleep
quality were modestly lower in the SE group than in the control
group. The decline in sleep quality may be due to a period of ad-
justment to the prescribed longer TIB. This apparently negative
consequence of earlier bedtimes may dissipate over time. A study
conducted in young adults for 3 wk suggested that their graduated
SE protocol preserved participants’sleep quality (63). Future SE
trials should investigate maintenance of or improvement in sleep

quality, as well as the potential benefits of introducing gradual
behavioral changes.
SE resulted in a reduction of ∼10 g of reported intakes of
free sugars, equating to approximately one-third of the UK di-
etary guidelines’ daily allowance (64). The SE group’
s reduc-
tion in free-sugars intake was also the main contributing factor to
the increased score for adherence to the UK dietary guidelines.
However, the change in the percentage of energy from free sug-
ars was not different between groups, suggesting that the reduc-
tion in sugary foods was not independent of reported total en-
ergy consumed. Although there were no significance differences
between groups in the change in energy intake, it is possible
that participating in the sleep intervention had driven changes in
the SE group’
s dietary reporting, which may result in artefacts.
The longest partial sleep deprivation RCT to date reported that a
2-wk intervention induced the consumption of excess calories
from energy-dense, high-carbohydrate snacks, with no significant
effect on total energy intake (65), lending support to our findings.
This suggests that the observational links between short sleep
and poorer-quality diets (66, 67) and increased intake of sugar
(12, 68) may be causal. In addition to the observed effects on re-
ported intakes of free sugars, there was a trend for a reduction in
reported fat intake in the plausible reporters, which became sig-
nificant when analyzed as a percentage of total energy. SE may
thus lead to a tendency to select foods with lower fat and higher
protein contents. Previous RCTs have shown enhanced brain neu-
ronal activation in response to unhealthy food images in a sleep-
deprived condition compared with a normal sleep condition (69,
70), suggesting that sleep influences reward-driven eating behav-
ior. SE may dampen hedonic signals that drive food intake. Leptin
and ghrelin have been implicated in sleep-deprivation studies but
were unaffected by SE in the present study. Because we observed
a decline in sleep quality in the SE group, it is possible that the
extended TIB, independent of sleep quality, could limit opportu-
nities to eat, regardless of levels of hunger. However, our interpre-
tation of leptin and ghrelin is limited due to possible changes in
circadian oscillations as a result of SE, because only single fast-
ing morning samples were taken per participant, albeit collected
at similar times. Our findings need to be interpreted with caution,
because participating in an intervention at a nutrition department
may have altered participants’tendency to bias their dietary re-
ports to a healthier diet.
We found no significant differences in markers of energy bal-
ance between groups, including body weight and composition,
energy expenditure, and physical activity levels. Experimental
sleep-restriction studies reported inconsistent findings, with some
suggesting decreased physical activity (71, 72) in those who are
sleep deprived and others reporting no changes in energy expen-
diture when assessed by using doubly labeled water (65, 73). Our
study design precludes quantifying net energy balance, because
our assessment of the mean 2-d energy expenditure may not re-
flect the mean 7-d reported dietary intake because humans are in
constant energy flux (74). Although we found no difference in
weight over a 1-mo period, diet quality may influence an indi-
vidual’
s ability to maintain energy balance over the longer term
(75).
There are several limitations to the present study. First, changes
in behavior variables may have been due to the “Hawthorne ef-
fect,” as previously reported by Cizza et al. (76). In addition, the
lack of ability to blind participants to the allocation of the SE in-
tervention may have introduced confounding effects in the con-
trol condition by indirectly stimulating an interest in sleep. To
minimize this possible effect, terms such as “sleep hygiene”were
avoided during interactions with the control group. Future SE tri-
als may consider blinding assessors to minimize sources of bias.
In addition, the sample was predominantly white, young women
recruited from a university setting, and this may limit generaliz-
ability to other sociodemographic groups. There are noteworthy
limitations to the use of dietary records, because these are prone
to reporting bias. Although we identified plausible reporters, their
reported intakes are not necessarily accurate. Moreover, a 1-mo
intervention may have been inadequate to allow for adaptation,
warranting longer future trials. Finally, secondary outcomes were
considered pilot investigations and we may have been underpow-
ered to detect differences between groups.
To our knowledge, this is the only RCT to date to investigate
SE by using a personalized behavioral approach in healthy adult
short sleepers. It was conducted under free-living conditions and
presents ecologically valid evidence. Further strengths include
the objective measurement of sleep, physical activity, and energy
expenditure (RMR and TEE). Moreover, we generated SDs for
a range of outcomes to be used in power calculations for future
RCTs.
We conclude that a tailored behavioral SE intervention target-
ing sleep hygiene is feasible in healthy, free-living young adults,
which shows the utility of including sleep hygiene guidelines in
public health messages. We also showed that SE may reduce re-
ported intake of free sugars, consequently improving diet quality
and supporting the theory that diet may be a key mediator in the
relation between short sleep and metabolic disease. The results
of this trial need to be confirmed by using methods less prone
to bias, necessitating inpatient dietary assessment or biomarker
studies. A secondary aim of this study was to explore mecha-
nisms linking SE and components of energy balance and dietary
intake. This trial did not aim to determine the long-term impact of
sleeping habits on weight change. Larger and longer-term RCTs
are needed to examine the effects of continued adherence to sleep
hygiene advice and preservation of sleep quality on energy bal-
ance, particularly in “at risk” populations.
