A
n excess stroke mortality among blacks was documented 
as long ago as 1949 to 1951, with the black-to-white 
mortality ratios over 3× greater between the ages of 45 to 54 
years and a declining black-to-white mortality ratio at older 
ages.1 These differences persist; Figure 1 shows the age-spe-
cific black-to-white stroke mortality ratio for the non-Hispanic 
US population between 2003 and 2007 (recruitment period for 
the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke 
[REGARDS] study).2
There are numerous factors contributing to the temporal 
decline in stroke mortality, including prevention and improved 
control of stroke risk factors, including hypertension and dia-
betes mellitus, smoking cessation programs, and advances 
in poststroke care, such as telemedicine and health system 
designs to enhance stroke care.3 However, improvements in 
these factors seem to benefit both the white and black popu-
lation and hence may not have contributed to changes in the 
magnitude of the black-to-white disparity for stroke mortality 
(in fact, the disparity seems to be increasing4). To reduce the 
black–white disparity in stroke, we need to understand what 
factors contribute to the higher mortality in blacks and target 
interventions at these factors.
Disease-specific mortality is a product of the incidence 
rate (number of people developing the disease) and the case 
fatality (proportion of those developing the disease die). 
Understanding whether higher stroke mortality in blacks is 
attributable to a higher incidence or case fatality is central 
to the effort to target interventions to reduce the disparity. 
Specifically, if higher incidence is the primary contributor, 
then efforts to reduce the disparity must focus on primary 
Background and Purpose—At age 45 years, blacks have a stroke mortality ≈3× greater than their white counterparts, with 
a declining disparity at older ages. We assess whether this black–white disparity in stroke mortality is attributable to a 
black–white disparity in stroke incidence versus a disparity in case fatality.
Methods—We first assess if black–white differences in stroke mortality within 29 681 participants in the Reasons for 
Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort reflect national black–white differences in stroke 
mortality and then assess the degree to which black–white differences in stroke incidence or 30-day case fatality after 
stroke contribute to the disparities in stroke mortality.
Results—The pattern of stroke mortality within the study mirrors the national pattern, with the black-to-white hazard ratio 
of ≈4.0 at age 45 years decreasing to ≈1.0 at age 85 years. The pattern of black-to-white disparities in stroke incidence 
shows a similar pattern but no evidence of a corresponding disparity in stroke case fatality.
Conclusions—These findings show that the black–white differences in stroke mortality are largely driven by differences in 
stroke incidence, with case fatality playing at most a minor role. Therefore, to reduce the black–white disparity in stroke 
mortality, interventions need to focus on prevention of stroke in blacks.

prevention of stroke in the black population. Conversely, if 
case fatality in blacks is the primary contributor, then the 
reduction of the black–white disparity must focus on efforts to 
reduce disparities in care of patients with stroke.
Remarkably, few studies have examined whether higher 
stroke incidence versus high case fatality in blacks is the 
primary contributor to the higher stroke mortality in blacks. 
The Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study 
used stroke surveillance approaches and showed an age-spe-
cific pattern of black–white differences in stroke incidence 
in 1999 in the Cincinnati region that is quite similar to the 
national age-specific pattern for black–white differences in 
mortality, with stroke mortality 2.6× greater in blacks than 
in whites at age 45 to 54 years, but monotonically decreas-
ing to 0.8× for ages 85+ years.5 The Greater Cincinnati/
Northern Kentucky Stroke Study also showed that stroke 
case fatality was 24% lower in blacks than in whites. 
Likewise, data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey 
showed consistently higher discharge rates for stroke per 
1000 population for blacks than whites but generally lower 
in-hospital mortality after stroke for blacks than whites.6 
The pattern of a declining black–white disparity in stroke 
incidence has been previously confirmed in the REGARDS 
cohort7; however, case fatality data have not been reported 
from the REGARDS cohort. Collectively, these data suggest 
that the key to reducing the black disparity in stroke mortal-
ity is through risk factor prevention or improved risk factor 
control to prevent strokes in blacks rather than improved 
care of blacks once stroke has occurred. The goal of the cur-
rent report is to confirm the findings in a national cohort of 
black and white participants.
Methods
The REGARDS study is a longitudinal cohort study of 30 239 black 
and white participants aged 45+ years. The cohort was recruited 
from the 48 contiguous states in the United States between 2003 
and 2007 through a combination of mail and telephone contacts. 
An interview assessing the risk profile was conducted by telephone, 
and an in-home visit was subsequently performed for assessment of 
blood pressure, height, waist circumference, weight, and biological 
specimen collection. The cohort has been followed up at 6-month 
intervals by telephone for surveillance of potential strokes, with 
medical records for suspected stroke events retrieved and adjudi-
cated by a physician panel. Details of the study are available else-
where.8 All participants provided written informed consent, and the 
study methods were approved by institutional review boards at all 
participating entities.
The excess stroke mortality in blacks has been documented in 
the Vital Statistics Systems from the National Center for Health 
Statistics, with mortality ≈3× higher in blacks than in whites at age 
45 years but a declining disparity at older ages.4 The first goal of this 
article was to validate data from the REGARDS study by confirming 
whether the black–white pattern of stroke deaths in the REGARDS 
study reflects these national data. Incident fatal stroke was defined as 
a death within 30 days of a physician-adjudicated stroke event and 
as such represents the product of both incidence and case fatality. 
Because the disparity in National Center for Health Statistics mortal-
ity includes both initial and recurrent stroke, we included the risk of 
incident fatal strokes among participants who are stroke free at base-
line and those who are self-reporting previous stroke at baseline. The 
potential of a black–white disparity in fatal stroke was assessed using 
proportional hazards analysis, with factors for race, age, race-by-age 
interaction, and sex.
We then investigated whether the (potential) disparity in fatal 
strokes was attributable to:
• Black–white disparities in stroke incidence (either fatal or non-
fatal) during follow-up using an analytic approach identical to 
that described above for incident fatal stroke.
• The black–white difference in case fatality was assessed in 
analysis restricted to those participants with a documented 
stroke during follow-up. Case fatality was defined by the pro-
portion of these participants dying within 30 days of an adjudi-
cated stroke event. The black–white difference in case fatality 
was assessed using logistic regression, with terms for race, age, 
race-by-age interaction, and sex.
The potential age-by-race interaction was tested in all models with 
an a priori α=0.10.
Results
Of the 30 239 REGARDS participants, follow-up was avail-
able on 29 682 (98%). A description of the study population 
is provided in Table 1. The white participants were slightly 
older, were more likely to be men, were less likely to have low 
income or education, and generally have fewer stroke risk fac-
tors. During an average follow-up of 6.8±2.7 years, there were 
1168 strokes; of which, 242 were fatal.
Analysis of Time to Incident Fatal Stroke
The interaction between race and age was significant 
(P=0.0042), and as such, the black–white differences in the 
time to fatal stroke are described by age.
When age is categorized in decades, there is a monotoni-
cally decreasing black-to-white stroke mortality ratio by age 
(Figure 2A). There were only 5 fatal strokes in the youngest 
age stratum (4 in black and 1 in white participants), resulting 
Figure 1. Age-specific (for age ≥45) black-to-white mortality ratio 
for deaths from cerebrovascular diseases (International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision: I60–I69) in the United States 
for years 2003 to 2007 (inclusive). Note that both the number of 
people dying of stroke and the number of people in the popula-
tion are from a census (census of the population and US Vital 
Statistics) and include all people in the United States. As such, 
there is no sampling variation of the estimated age-specific mor-
tality rates underlying the mortality ratio and hence no sampling 
variation (and hence no confidence bounds) on the mortality 
ratios.

in a wide confidence interval. For the older age strata, the 
black-to-white mortality ratio approaches 1.0 (and is nonsig-
nificantly <1.0 for ages 85+ years).
The monotonically decreasing black-to-white mortality 
ratios by decade support the analysis with age as a continu-
ous variable (Figure 2B, where the black-to-white mortality 
ratio decreases from ≈4.0 at age 45 years, down to 1.0 at age 
85 years). This pattern generally reflects the black-to-White 
mortality ratio from Vital Statistics.
Analysis of Time to Incident 
Stroke (Fatal or Nonfatal)
For the time to any stroke, the interaction between race and 
age was significant (P=0.0003), and as such, the black–white 
differences in the time to any stroke are described by age. 
Figure 3A shows the black-to-white stroke incidence ratio 
with age categorized by decade, showing a monotonically 
decreasing black-to-white ratio that is ≈3.0 at age 45 to 54 
years but decreases to ≈1.0 by age 75 to 84 years. This mono-
tonically decreasing black-to-white incidence ratio supports 
the analysis of the incidence ratio with age as a continuous 
variable (Figure 3B), where the black-to-white incidence ratio 
decreases from ≈2.5 at age 45 years, down to 1.0 at age 85 
years. This pattern generally reflects the black-to-white mor-
tality ratio from Vital Statistics.
Analysis of Case Fatality
The age-specific number of fatal strokes and total strokes, with 
sex-adjusted black-to-white odds ratios, is shown in Table 2. 
There was no evidence of any 2-way interactions between 
age, race, and sex (P>0.10), and as such, only main effects 
were assessed. In multivariable analysis, the odds of a stroke 
being fatal increased by 61% with each decade (odds ratio, 
1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.35–1.91); but there was no 
evidence that either race (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.89–1.62) or sex (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.76–1.36) was associated with case fatality.
Discussion
These data support the previous findings that the increased 
stroke mortality among middle-aged (45–65 years) blacks is 
attributable to black–white differences in stroke incidence and 
that black–white differences in case fatality is at most a minor 
contributor.5,7 The finding that case fatality is lower in blacks 
than in whites is supported by recent reports from Get With 
The Guidelines hospitals, where after adjustment for patient 
and hospital characteristics, the odds of in-hospital death in 
blacks was 0.90-fold (95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.95) 
that of whites.9 Hence, reducing the black-to-white dispar-
ity in stroke mortality will require further understanding 
and interventions to reduce the higher incidence of stroke in 
blacks. Although it is appropriate to work to reduce the dis-
parities in stroke care,10 this will be unlikely to substantially 
reduce the disparity in stroke mortality. The key will be inter-
ventions focused on approaches to risk factor prevention and 
management, with primary care physicians and public health 
programs playing a key role.
The REGARDS study has already provided some insights 
to the black–white disparity in stroke incidence, but much 
work remains. Previous reports from the REGARDS study

have shown that ≈40% of the black–white incidence disparity 
between the ages of 45 to 65 years can be attributed to preva-
lence of traditional risk factors (defined by the Framingham 
Stroke Risk Function11), particularly treated hypertension and 
prevalent diabetes mellitus, both of which are substantially 
higher in the black population than in the white population.12 
Eliminating the disparity in stroke risk factors will be chal-
lenging; however, failure implies the continued persistence of 
the disparity not only in risk factors but also in stroke inci-
dence and mortality.
Although the prevalence in stroke risk factors accounts for 
≈40% of the disparity in stroke incidence, we have previously 
suggested12 that the remaining 60% of the disparity could be 
associated with:
1.  
Awareness, treatment and control of risk factors: data 
from both National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey and REGARDS have shown that although aware-
ness and treatment for hypertension are higher in the 
black population than in whites, the likelihood of ade-
quate control is much lower.13,14 Hence, hypertension is a 
triple threat as a contributor to the black–white disparity 
in stroke incidence as it has a higher prevalence, is less 
likely to be controlled, and the harm of lack of control 
has more potent effect. It has been suggested that the 
disparities in hypertension control may be attributable to 
differences in social conditions.15 In contrast, for dyslip-
idemia, blacks are less likely to be aware, less likely to 
be treated, and less likely to be controlled.16–18 Likewise, 
blacks have poorer control of diabetes mellitus19 and are 
less likely to be aware of or treated for atrial fibrillation.20 
Interventions targeted to address prevention and control 
of risk factors in the stroke-free population are needed.
2.  
Risk factors having a differential effect by race, with a 
more potent effect in the black population: for example, 
we have previously shown that the effect of high blood 
pressure is larger in the black than in white population, 
where after multivariable adjustment for other risk fac-
tors, a 10-mm Hg higher blood pressure is associated 
with an 8% increase risk of stroke in whites but a 24% 
increase risk in blacks.21 This apparent differential sus-
ceptibility could be playing a major role as there were 
no disparities in stroke incidence in subjects with well-
controlled (<120 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure.
3.  
Disparities in nontraditional risk factors: beyond the 
Framingham stroke risk factors, there are a plethora of 
risk factors that are both shown to be related to stroke 
and where blacks have a disadvantage in the prevalence 
or severity.22,23 Among the risk factors declared as well 
documented in the primary prevention guidelines, blacks 
have a disadvantage in prevalence or severity for physi-
cal inactivity,24,25 diet,26 and obesity.27 In addition, there 
are numerous less-well documented risk factors, such as 
psychosocial factors, including depressive symptoms, 
anger, hostility, and discrimination that are likely re-
lated to stroke for which blacks are at a disadvantage 
for prevalence or severity.28 Blacks are also at a disad-
vantage for environmental and neighborhood exposures 
that are related to stroke risk, including an alarmingly 
disproportionate number living in poverty, one of the 
strongest risk factors for stroke and other cardiovascular 
disease outcomes.29,30 Much work remains to continue to

document nontraditional risk factors that are related to 
stroke where blacks are at a disadvantage for prevalence 
or severity of the risk factor, so that interventions and 
policies can address them.
4.  
Measurement error and residual confounding: all re-
gression models (including both the proportional haz-
ards and logistic models used here) assume that the 
predictor variables are measured with precision. For the 
predictor variables in this analysis (age, race, and sex), 
it is reasonably safe to assume that this is not a major 
issue. However, in other analyses where predictor vari-
ables are measured with a larger error, this could be a 
greater concern and lead to an underestimation of the 
proportion of the excess explained.
Despite the dramatic decline in stroke deaths for both 
blacks and whites, the black–white disparity in stroke mortal-
ity persists (or may be growing).4 Although some inroads have 
been made to understand the contributors to the higher risk of 
stroke incidence in blacks, there is much work remaining. The 
challenge for the REGARDS study and other epidemiological 
cohorts is to intensify the focus of investigations to identify 
the contributors, so that clinical trials can be developed to test 
the targeting of interventions to reduce this black–white stroke 
mortality disparity.
On the surface, it would seem that disparities in second-
ary stroke prevention could also play a role. Of the estimated 
795 000 stroke events in the United States, ≈185 000 (23%) are 
recurrent events.31 Although much less is known about the role 
of risk factors and the black–white disparities for secondary 
stroke events,32 data from the REGARDS study have shown 
no black–white differences in the risk of recurrent stroke,33 
and as such, it is relatively unlikely that secondary stroke pre-
vention is a pathway to reducing the black–white disparity in 
stroke mortality.
It is clear that there are substantial black–white differences 
in care after stroke,34 and we explicitly do not want to mini-
mize the importance of addressing disparities in stroke care. 
However, case fatality after stroke did not differ between 
blacks and whites in either this REGARDS analysis or the 
previous Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study, 
suggesting that these disparities in care are unlikely to be con-
tributors to the disparities in stroke mortality. This is not to 
say that it is unimportant to reduce documented black–white 
disparities in care, where after adjustment for patient and hos-
pital characteristics, black stroke patients were less likely than 
whites to receive intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activa-
tor, be discharged on antithrombotics, be provided the use of 
anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, to have low-density lipo-
proteins treated to 100 mg/dL, and to receive smoking cessa-
tion counseling9; it is only that these disparities do not seem 
to be major contributors to the black–white disparity in stroke 
mortality. In addition, the distinction between prestroke and 
poststroke is not always crisp, and many of our study partici-
pants could have some level of cerebrovascular disease that 
could affect memory and functional assessment before an 
acute stroke event.
Conclusions
The substantial black–white differences in stroke mortality 
between the ages of 45 and 65 years are largely driven by 
black–white disparities in stroke incidence. This observation 
should bring attention to the need to focus efforts to reduce the 
black–white disparity on contributors to higher stroke inci-
dence in blacks. A substantial proportion of the excess risk 
of incident stroke in blacks is attributable to a higher preva-
lence of traditional risk factors in blacks, and we need to go 
further upstream to make inroads to reduce this pathway (ie, 
why do blacks have a higher prevalence of hypertension and 
diabetes mellitus). However, there are many other pathways, 
including differential susceptibility to risk factors, disparities 
in the control and treatment of risk factors, socioeconomic 
inequities, and novel or emerging risk factors, where blacks 
have a disadvantage. We are at the early phase of processes to 
better understand these alternative pathways that potentially 
contribute to the black–white disparity in stroke incidence, 
and we need to redouble our efforts to the investigations of 
these pathways.
