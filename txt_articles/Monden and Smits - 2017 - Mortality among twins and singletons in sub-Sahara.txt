Mortality among twins and singletons in sub-Saharan Africa 
between 1995 and 2014: a pooled analysis of data from 
90 Demographic and Health Surveys in 30 countries
Christiaan W S Monden, Jeroen Smits
Summary
Background Sub-Saharan Africa has the world’s highest under-5 and neonatal mortality rates as well as the highest 
naturally occurring twin rates. Twin pregnancies carry high risk for children and mothers. Under-5 mortality has 
declined in sub-Saharan Africa over the last decades. It is unknown whether twins have shared in this reduction.
Methods We pooled data from 90 Demographic and Health Surveys for 30 sub-Saharan Africa countries on births 
reported between 1995 and 2014. We used information on 1 685 110 singleton and 56 597 twin livebirths to compute 
trends in mortality rates for singletons and twins. We examined whether the twin–singleton rate ratio can be attributed 
to biological, socioeconomic, care-related factors, or birth size, and estimated the mortality burden among sub-
Saharan African twins.
Findings Under-5 mortality among twins has declined from 327·7 (95% CI 312·0–343·5) per 1000 livebirths in 
1995–2001 to 213·0 (196·7–229·2) in 2009–14. This decline of 35·0% was much less steep than the 50·6% reduction 
among singletons (from 128·6 [95% CI 126·4–130·8] per 1000 livebirths in 1995–2001 to 63·5 [61·6–65·3] in 2009–14). 
Twins account for an increasing share of under-5 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa: currently 10·7% of under-5 mortality 
and 15·1% of neonatal mortality. We estimated that about 315 000 twins (uncertainty interval 289 000–343 000) die in 
sub-Saharan African each year. Excess twin mortality cannot be explained by common risk factors for under-5 
mortality, including birthweight. The difference with singletons was especially stark for neonatal mortality (rate 
ratio 5·0, 95% CI 4·5–5·6). 51·7% of women pregnant with twins reported receiving medical assistance at birth.
Interpretation The fate of twins in sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind that of singletons. An alarming one-fifth of 
twins in the region dies before age 5 years, three times the mortality rate among singletons. Twins account for a 
substantial and growing share of under-5 and neonatal mortality, but they are largely neglected in the literature. 
Coordinated action is required to improve the situation of this extremely vulnerable group.

Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of naturally 
occurring twin births in the world.1 Whereas natural 
twinning rates are about six to nine twin births per 
1000 maternities in east Asia and Latin America, and 
eight to 16 in Europe, North America, and the Middle 
East, they are as high as 18 per 1000 or more in the central 
African twinning zone that runs from Guinea, Liberia, 
and Côte d’Ivoire in the west of Africa to Tanzania, 
Mozambique, and the Comoros in the east.1 About 3–4% 
of children born in sub-Saharan Africa are members of a 
twin pair.
Twins are extremely vulnerable and twin births and 
twin pregnancies have a high risk of complications for 
mother and child. Twins suffer from low birthweight and 
preterm delivery. Twin pregnancies and births are 
associated with obstetric complications such as anaemia, 
post-partum haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and 
increased maternal mortality.2–4 Under-5 and neonatal 
mortality rates are two to five times higher than among 
twins compared with the largest relative differences 
found in regions with the lowest mortality rates.5–10 For 
example, in Finland, which has one of the lowest infant 
mortality rates in the world, infant mortality among 
multiple births is considerably higher than among 
singletons (11·1 vs 1·9 deaths per 1000 livebirths in the 
period 2010–15; Ahokas E, Population Statistics, Statistics 
Finland, personal communication). Twins suffer more 
from congenital malformations and could also therefore 
be more vulnerable after the first year of life.9
The fate of twins might be particularly precarious in 
sub-Saharan Africa where child mortality rates are the 
highest in the world,11 where maternal and newborn care 
is weak,11–14 and where the absolute number of children 
under 5 years, including twins, will increase by about 
20% over the next decades.15 High mortality rates among 
twins have been documented for many sub-Saharan sites 
or countries, with under-5 mortality rates ranging from 
over 200 to almost 400 deaths per 1000 livebirths.5,6,16,17 
Also, maternal mortality and morbidity associated with

twin pregnancies are very high in sub-Saharan Africa.2,4 
Although effective guidelines are available for antenatal 
and delivery care for twins,18,19 many women in the region 
receive little antenatal care at all and deliver in a non-
medical setting.5,17 Given the high absolute number of 
twin births in sub-Saharan Africa, in combination with 
the high perinatal and maternal mortality surrounding 
these births, it might be difficult, without special 
attention to this vulnerable group, to achieve the Every 
Newborn 2035 target of fewer than ten neonatal deaths 
per 1000 livebirths20 and the Sustainable Development 
Goal (SDG) 2030 targets of fewer than 12 per 
1000 neonatal deaths and fewer 
than 
25 
per 
1000 under-5 deaths. Moreover, the literature surrounding 
these targets12,21–25 does not discuss twin births or the 
special care twins and their mothers require. In the 
2015 SDG Indicators and Monitoring Framework,26 twins 
are not mentioned.
The gap in knowledge is particularly pertinent with 
regard to trends. We know that between 1990 and 2015, 
under-5 mortality in sub-Saharan Africa has decreased by 
more than half (54%).27 However, it is not clear to what 
extent this improvement has been experienced by twins. 
No trend studies are available that track the development 
of twin mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the size of 
the problem of twin excess mortality in sub-Saharan 
Africa is unknown. To change this situation, we 
assembled data on 1·6 million births, including 
56 597 twin births, derived from 90 Demographic and 
Health Surveys (DHS) held between 1995 and 2015 in 
30 sub-Saharan African countries. First, we examine how 
twin mortality has developed over time compared with 
singleton mortality. Second, we determine to what extent 
singletons and twins in sub-Saharan Africa differ with 
regard to common sociodemographic determinants of 
under-5 mortality. Third, we assess to what extent excess 
twin mortality can be explained by these socio-
demographic factors. Finally, we estimate the total 
mortality burden among twins in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods
Study design
The data are derived from the DHS Program. Each DHS 
survey consists of a household survey and separate 
women’s survey. In the latter, all usual resident women 
aged 15–49 years are invited for an interview, which 
includes a complete birth history collecting information 
on all livebirths of the women, including date of birth, sex 
of the child, whether it was a singleton or multiple birth, 
and whether and when a child died. The team executing 
the DHS survey ensures protection of participants in 
agreement with local and international laws.
Procedures
We pooled 90 standard DHS surveys done between 1995 
and 2015 in 30 sub-Saharan African countries: Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Côte 
d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, 
Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, 
Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, 
Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These countries 
were selected because their DHS survey provided 
sufficient numbers of births in the following periods: 
1995–2001, 2002–08, and 2009–14. These 30 countries 
account for 83% of all under-5 mortality in sub-Saharan 
Africa (appendix).11 We selected all children born in the 
period 1995–2014. DHS do not record stillborn children.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies from inception until 
Dec 1, 2016, with combinations of search terms including 
“twins”, “multiple pregnancies”, “multiple births”, 
“multiple-gestation”, “multifetal pregnancies”, “under-5 
mortality”, “neonatal mortality”, “infant mortality”, “child 
mortality”, “Africa”, and country names. We did not restrict the 
search by language. Studies identified were mostly 
hospital-based studies of twin births and the complications 
surrounding those births, including child mortality and 
maternal mortality and morbidity. Three comparative studies 
were identified in which twin mortality rates were calculated for 
two or more sub-Saharan African countries. We found no 
studies reporting trends over time, nor studies estimating the 
total mortality burden among twins in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Studies indicated that twins suffer from lower birthweight and 
preterm delivery and have much higher under-5 and neonatal 
mortality than singletons. Under-5 mortality rates among twins 
ranged from over 200 to almost 400 per 1000 livebirths.
Added value of this study
Our trend study shows that between 1995 and 2014, under-5 
mortality and neonatal mortality have decreased much less 
among twins (35·0%) than among singletons (50·6%). The 
twin–singleton rate ratio for under-5 mortality has increased 
from 2·5 to 3·4 and for neonatal mortality from 4·6 to 5·0. 
Twins account for 10·7% of all under-5 deaths and 15·1% of 
neonatal deaths in the region and these percentages are 
increasing. The total number of twins dying before 5 years of 
age is estimated at about 315 000 per year.
Implications of all the available evidence
Given the high and increasing proportion of under-5 and 
neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa due to mortality 
among twins, it will be difficult to achieve the Every 
Newborn 2035 target and the Sustainable Development Goal 
target regarding neonatal and under-5 mortality without 
special attention to this highly vulnerable group.

All figures refer to livebirths and for twins this means 
only those cases where both twins were liveborn. Triplets 
and other higher order multiple births were excluded. 
Marital status, place of residence, and wealth were 
measured at the time of interview. Household wealth was 
measured by the International Wealth Index,28 which is a 
cross-nationally comparable index based on the 
household’s possession of consumer durables, housing 
quality, and access to basic amenities.
Statistical analysis
To assess to what extent excess twin mortality can be 
accounted for by differences in biological and 
socioeconomic factors, medical assistance, and birth 
size, the 2009–14 mortality rate ratios were adjusted in a 
series of regression models. We included the following 
variables: maternal age at birth (in years), birth order, 
length of the preceding birth interval (in months), 
mother’s marital status, urban or rural residence, 
household wealth, place of delivery (in a medical facility 
or clinic versus at home or other non-medical location), 
and assistance of a nurse, medically trained midwife, or 
doctor during delivery. Women were asked to report 
whether their child’s size at birth was very small, small, 
average, large, or very large. This metric has been shown 
to be a good proxy for birthweight.29 For the case 
observations with missing information for one or more 
variables of interest, results were estimated with multiple 
imputations (MI command in Stata).
For these multivariate analyses, we restricted the 
sample to births that occurred not more than 5 years 
before the interview because questions about the place of 
delivery and medical assistance at delivery were only 
asked for the three most recent births in the last 5 years. 
All models included fixed effects for 323 subnational 
regions to account for measured and unmeasured 
regional 
context 
factors. 
Regions 
correspond 
to 
administrative divisions in the 30 countries. There are 
between three and 21 regions per country. Fixed birth 
year effects were also included.
Adjusted mortality rate ratios were calculated using 
Poisson regression. In all analyses we used a 
combination of weights: DHS household weights to take 
into account the survey nature of the data and weights 
for the relative population size of the country to make 
the results representative for the collective of 30 sub-
Saharan African countries. Population data were taken 
from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. 
Analyses were done in Stata 14 using the svy estimation 
command for complex survey data.30 All our conclusions 
hold true for unweighted estimation as well.

Results
The total 1995–2014 sample included information on 
1 685 110 children, of which 56 597 were twins. 
190 642 children died before age 5 years, of which 
16 399 were twins. Table 1 presents crude under-5 
mortality rates for singletons and twins for the 
three periods, 1995–2001, 2002–08, and 2009–14. There 
was a reduction in under-5 mortality for both singletons 
and twins between 1995 and 2014. For singletons, under-5 
mortality decreased by 51%, from 128·6 to 63·5 per 
1000 livebirths. This result is similar to the UN estimate 
of a 54% reduction in overall under-5 mortality 
between 1990 and 2015 for sub-Saharan Africa as a 
whole.11
Among twins, the reduction in under-5 mortality from 
327·7 to 213·0 per 1000 is much larger than among 
singletons in absolute terms (a reduction of 114·5 vs 
65·5 deaths per 1000), but it is smaller in relative terms 
(35% vs 51%). Twins experienced 198·8 more deaths per 
1000 livebirths than singletons in 1995–2001, but this 
excess mortality decreased to 149·5 per 1000 in the 
2009–14 period. So, the absolute difference in mortality 
rates between twins and singletons has fallen by a 
quarter.
The rate ratio for the difference in under-5 mortality 
between twins and singletons increased over the study 
period from 2·5 (95% CI 2·4–2·7) to 3·4 (3·1–3·6), an 
increase of 32%. Also, the share of twins in total under-5 
mortality has increased substantially. Whereas in 
1995–2001, 8·1% (95% CI 7·6–8·5) of under-5 mortality 
was due to mortality among twins, in 2009–14 this was 
10·7% (9·8–11·6) of total mortality. The number of

under-5 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 was 
estimated at 2·9 million by the UN Inter-agency Group for 
Child Mortality Estimation.11,27 This number translates to 
about 315 000 twins (uncertainty interval 289 000–343 000) 
dying before their fifth birthday (appendix).
In table 2 we break down under-5 mortality into 
mortality at different stages (conditional on survival to 
that age). The major difference in mortality between 
singletons and twins occurred in the first days and 
month of life. In the most recent period, the twin–
singleton rate ratio for neonatal mortality was 5·0 
(95% CI 4·4–5·6), whereas it was 2·6 (2·2–3·1) for post-
neonatal mortality (1–11 months) and 2·1 (1·6–2·7) for 
child mortality (12–59 months). The neonatal mortality 
rate has decreased for both twins and singletons, but for 
twins is still exceptionally high (137·0 per 1000). Although 
the biggest difference between twins and singletons was 
observed in the first month of life, the rate ratio for child 
mortality implies that after 12 months—and presumably 
highly selective mortality—twins still experienced a 
mortality rate twice as high as singletons.
Among both twins and singletons, the share of 
neonatal mortality in total under-5 mortality increased 
over the three periods. By 2009–14, neonatal mortality 
was responsible for 43% (27·5 of 63·5 per 1000) of 
under-5 mortality among singletons and for 64% 
(137·0 of 213·0 per 1000) among twins. Our figures show 
that in the 2009–14 period, as much as 15·1% (95% CI 
13·5–16·8) of all neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa 
were accounted for by twins.
Table 3 shows the distribution by twins and singletons of 
common demographic, socioeconomic, and medical care 
factors that are associated with under-5 mortality. Twins 
and singletons did not differ much in household wealth, 
maternal education, or marital status of the mother. Due to 
the large sample size all of the above differences are 
significant at the 5% level but none of them are substantial 
in absolute size. This result was also true for the difference 
in sex of the child and mother’s urban or rural place of 
residence.
Larger differences were found with birth order and 
mother’s age at birth (table 3). Twin births were less 
frequent among first births (6·8% vs 20·9%) and more 
frequent among high parity births of four or more 
(66·6% vs 45·4%). They were also less frequent among 
mothers aged 12–19 years (7·9% vs 18·9%) and more 
frequent among mothers in their 30s (35·0% vs 25·2%). 
In multivariate models, parity and maternal age have 
independent positive associations with twin births 
(appendix). These results are in agreement with findings 
from studies in more developed countries.31
Twins were more likely than singletons to have been 
born in a medical setting (62·5% vs 52·7%) and to have 
had some medical assistance at birth (51·7% vs 40·4%). 
These associations might have been to the benefit of 
twins, but with regard to birth size they were 
disadvantaged. More than one in three (35·6%) twins 
was reported to be smaller than average, compared with 
only one in six singletons (16·8%).
Of the 259 593 observations in the 2009–14 period for 
which multivariate analyses were done, 33 228 (12·8%) 
of the case observations had missing information for 
one or more variables of interest. Missing information 
on marital status (17 846 [6·9%]) or on child’s size at 
birth (25 186 [9·7%]) were most common. Results 
estimated with multiple imputations are similar to 
those of the complete case analysis (appendix). In the 
base model, which included only the fixed effects, the 
twin–singleton rate ratios for under-5 and neonatal 
mortality were 3·4 (95% CI 3·1–3·7) and 5·0 (4·5–5·7), 
respectively (table 4). After adjusting for demographic 
and socioeconomic factors, these rate ratios increased 
to 3·6 (95% CI 3·3–3·9) and 5·6 (4·9–6·3). Additional 
controls for medical assistance showed little change in 
rate ratios, but additional adjustment for birth size 
reduced the twin–singleton rate ratios back to base level 
for both under-5 mortality (rate ratio 3·4, 95% CI 
3·1–3·7) and neonatal mortality (rate ratio 5·0, 
4·4–5·7).
Although table 3 shows that twins were much more 
likely to have small birth size, this could not explain 
excess mortality among twins. The twin–singleton rate 
ratio for under-5 mortality rate ranged from 2·9 (95% CI 
2·3–3·7) among very small children to 3·7 (2·8–5·0) 
among very large ones (appendix). This result is in line 
with the so-called birthweight paradox, the finding that 
babies with low birthweight in high-risk populations, 
such as twins, have lower mortality than babies with low 
birthweight in more favourable populations.32,33 Among

Discussion
This study is the first comprehensive analysis on trends 
in twin mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Under-5 
mortality has decreased substantially in this region over 
the past decades. Nevertheless, the UN Inter-agency 
Group for Child Mortality Estimation has estimated that 
2·9 million children in the region died before the age of 
5 years in 2015.11 Our analysis indicates that almost 11% 
(about 315 000) of these deaths occurred among twins. 
This proportion has risen from 8% in 1995–2001. The 
differences are even larger for neonatal mortality. In

2009–14, the rate ratio of twin versus singleton neonatal 
mortality was 5·0 and the share of twins in total neonatal 
mortality was 15%.
Before discussing the practical implications of our 
findings, we should address some data limitations. Our 
estimates of twin mortality are likely to be lower bound 
estimates. The main limitation of the DHS for this study 
is possible under-reporting of twin births and twin 
deaths. Women who died during or since childbirth 
cannot be interviewed. Since the probability of maternal 
mortality is higher with twin births,2–4 it is likely that 
DHS data underestimate the number of twin births and 
deaths. Moreover, there might be further under-reporting 
of twin births and twin mortality because only livebirths 
are registered in the DHS surveys and all twin births in 
the data consist of two liveborn children. Where one of 
the twins was stillborn, the surviving co-twin has most 
likely been registered as a singleton. Because of the 
higher mortality risk inherent in twins, it is likely that the 
surviving co-twin faces a higher mortality risk than 
singletons (as has been reported for Burkina Faso17). Sear 
and colleagues34 report higher stillbirth rates among 
twins in Gambia and higher neonatal mortality among 
liveborn twins. DHS data are based on recall information, 
which makes them potentially susceptible to recall bias. 
However, births and deaths of children are among the 
most salient and emotional life events in women’s lives 
and therefore recall bias is unlikely to be high. Again, 
recall bias is more likely to suppress rather than increase 
estimates of twin mortality.
To reduce twin mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, 
improvements in health-care services are needed in all 
three phases of the process: during pregnancy, at delivery, 
and post partum.17 First, early detection of twin 
pregnancies, good antenatal care tailored towards the 
needs of mothers pregnant with twins, and timely 
referral for hospital delivery are important preconditions 
for twin survival and maternal health during and after 
delivery.5,35,36 However, still too few women pregnant with 
twins in the region receive appropriate medical care.5,37 
For example, almost half of the women giving birth to 
twins in a Nigerian tertiary hospital did not receive 
antenatal care35 and of the mothers who delivered twins 
in a study hospital in Guinea Bissau, as many as 
65% were not aware that they were pregnant with twins.5 
A first recommendation therefore is to strengthen 
antenatal care services and train providers of this care in 
recognising twin pregnancies. If ultrasound is lacking, 
most twin cases can be identified by clinical 
examination.5,38 When twin pregnancies are identified, 
the mothers should receive antenatal care that, given the 
often resource poor environments they live in, is as much 
as possible in line with existing guidelines for twin 
pregnancies.18,19,36
Second, it is important that delivery should take place 
in a hospital setting with staff trained in twin deliveries 
and with facilities for interventions, including caesarean 
section.5,35 Twins are a high-risk group, associated with 
preterm delivery and complications such as post-partum 
haemorrhage and increased maternal mortality.2–4,35 Twin 
deliveries have a substantially increased risk of caesarean 
section.2 In our data for the 2009–14 period, the crude 
under-5 mortality rate for twins was 178·2 per 
1000 among deliveries that took place in a medical 
setting compared with 250·9 per 1000 among deliveries 
at home. Given that almost half of these twin births took 
place without assistance of a medically trained person, 
and that many hospital deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa 
are last minute or emergency cases,5,35 there is still much 
to gain.
Third, special attention for twin births in sub-Saharan 
Africa should continue after a safe delivery. Mortality 
rates of twins remain high after the perinatal period and 
twins have increased risk of other complications, such 
as neurodevelopmental disabilities and congenital 
malformations.9,39 Therefore, it would be advisable to 
monitor these children in their first years of life. 
Particularly vulnerable are twins born after a short birth 
interval, from poor families, with an older mother, or 
when one child of a twin pair has died.5,6,17
If the care for twins and women pregnant with twins 
does not improve considerably in the coming years, the 
absolute numbers of twin deaths will hardly decrease. At 
the current speed of improved survival among twins, the 
reduction in the number of deaths will be compensated to 
a large extent by the growth in the under-5 population in 
the region, which is expected to increase by about 20% 
until 2030.15 To achieve the SDG and Every Newborn 
targets regarding neonatal and under-5 mortality, more 
attention will have to be paid to twin pregnancies and 
twin births. Despite twins’ higher vulnerability, it is 
possible to achieve high survival and, as the Finnish case 
shows (Ahokas E, Population Statistics, Statistics Finland, 
personal 
communication), 
a 
high 
twin–singleton 
mortality ratio can co-exist with small absolute mortality 
differences between twins and singletons. Although it is 
unrealistic to expect Finnish mortality rates for sub-
Saharan Africa anytime soon, the positive message is that 
improvements in care for twin pregnancies and twin 
births do not require unusual or new measures or 
technology. The potential for improvements in the 
survival of this forgotten group of vulnerable newborns is 
large and starts with increasing awareness of its plight.
