OBJECTIVE
To study the impact of genomic testing in shared decision making for men with clinically low-
risk prostate cancer (PCa).
MATERIALS AND
METHODS
Patients with clinically low-risk PCa were enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional study of
a validated 17-gene tissue-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (Genomic
Prostate Score [GPS]). In this paper we report on outcomes in the first 297 patients enrolled in
the study with valid 17-gene assay results and decision-change data. The primary end points were
shared decision on initial management and persistence on active surveillance (AS) at 1 year post
diagnosis. AS utilization and persistence were compared with similar end points in a group of pa-
tients who did not have genomic testing (baseline cohort). Secondary end points included per-
ceived utility of the assay and patient decisional conflict before and after testing.
RESULTS
One-year results were available on 258 patients. Shift between initial recommendation and shared
decision occurred in 23% of patients. Utilization of AS was higher in the GPS-tested cohort than
in the untested baseline cohort (62% vs 40%). The proportion of men who selected and per-
sisted on AS at 1 year was 55% and 34% in the GPS and baseline cohorts, respectively. Physi-
cians reported that GPS was useful in 90% of cases. Mean decisional conflict scores declined in
patients after GPS testing.
CONCLUSION
Patients who received GPS testing were more likely to select and persist on AS for initial man-
agement compared with a matched baseline group. These data indicate that GPS help guide shared
decisions in clinically low-risk PCa.

P
rostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid ma-
lignant tumor in American men and the second
leading cause of cancer death in this population.1
However, men with low-risk disease have a very low
likelihood of death from PCa: ~1% at up to 20 years post
diagnosis in 1 study.2 For this reason, active surveillance
(AS) has emerged as a valid management option for pa-
tients with low-risk PCa.3 PCa-specific mortality risk is sig-
nificant in some men with intermediate- and most men with
high-risk PCa.2,4 These men are likely best served by treat-
ment with curative intent.5
The optimal management strategy for a given man’s PCa
is dependent on accurate risk stratification.6 Unfortu-
nately, several large series have suggested a substantial rate
of upstaging/upgrading in men diagnosed with clinically
low-risk PCa who go on to surgery.7,8 This finding under-
scores the limitations of standard clinical tools (eg, pros-
tate biopsy) for accurate risk estimation in low-risk PCa.
Uncertainty regarding diagnostic accuracy undermines con-
fidence and may prompt men with low-risk, potentially in-
dolent cancers to proceed to definitive treatment with
radiation or surgery.9 All treatment options for PCa carry
substantial potential for morbidity and health-care
expenditure.10,11 As such, it would be desirable to identify

 and selectively treat only those patients who are most likely
to benefit.
In recent years, conventional tools for PCa risk assess-
ment (eg, biopsy Gleason scoring, serum prostate-specific
antigen, clinical stage) have been augmented by novel
technologies, including multiparametric magnetic reso-
nance imaging and tissue-based molecular assays.12,13
Molecular assays provide biological information that
cannot be gleaned from traditional clinicopathologic
metrics and have been demonstrated to improve predic-
tion of important clinical end points.12
The Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS,
Redwood City, CA) test is a 17-gene reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction-based genomic assay that has
been validated as an independent predictor of adverse
pathology14-16 and biochemical recurrence15 after prosta-
tectomy in men with clinically low-risk disease. The ad-
ditional information provided by the GPS about the
pathologic status of the prostate improves physician con-
fidence in management recommendations17 and increases
use of AS or watchful waiting in contemporary PCa
patients.18
In this study, we report a prespecified interim analysis
of a large multi-institutional observational study of GPS
in urologic practices (Supplemental Fig. S1). We hypoth-
esized that patients who received GPS testing predicting
favorable results would be more likely to select and persist
on AS than men who had not received testing. We also
hypothesized that GPS testing would increase physician con-
fidence and decrease patient decisional conflict.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objectives
The co-primary objectives of this interim analysis were to assess
shared decision making after GPS testing and, for men who chose
AS, to assess 1-year persistence. Secondary end points included
physician-reported utility and confidence and patient-reported
utility and decisional conflict.
Site Selection and Patient Eligibility
Physicians were selected for the study if they practiced at a center
that had experience in AS and annually treated at least 25 newly
diagnosed PCa patients who were National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk. Patient
inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Supplemental
Table S1.
The study started enrollment in July 2014 and completed en-
rollment in September 2015; target enrollment was 1200 men
from 26 US community-based urology practices, with no inves-
tigator contributing more than 50 patients. The report herein is
an analysis of the first 297 evaluable patients (ie, those who had
valid GPS, pre-assay physician recommendation, and post-assay
shared decision).
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of choice for each of the participating sites.
Baseline Cohort
To establish baseline practice patterns, a chart review of man-
agement decisions was performed in 9 sites with highest enrollment
in the prospective study. Patient charts from September 2014 ret-
rospectively to January 2012 were pulled (range 12-36 charts per
site) to reflect contemporary clinical practices before introduc-
tion of the GPS assay at these sites. Charts were reviewed with
the same clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria as the prospec-
tive study; for inclusion in the baseline cohort patients must have
a recorded follow-up visit at least 1-year post diagnosis. The shared
treatment decision for men newly diagnosed with clinically low-
risk PCa was captured as recorded in the patient chart.
Study Design
At initial visit, eligible patients were offered the option of par-
ticipating in the study. Patients were offered enrollment and written
informed consent was obtained. A GPS assay was ordered, and
the urologist recorded an initial management recommendation
based on the presenting clinical profile before a discussion with
the patient.
Patients were informed of management options per practice
standard, provided decision aids, and scheduled to return for
a second visit to discuss their GPS result. A GPS-based indi-
vidual estimation of risk was provided and discussed at the
second visit. At a third visit, a shared management decision
between AS or immediate treatment (IT) was recorded. A change
in management was counted when the post-GPS shared deci-
sion differed from the initial recommendation as recorded on the
case report form. For men who elected AS for initial manage-
ment, AS persistence was assessed 1 year post diagnosis.
Physician and patient perceived utility of the test was mea-
sured with a 7-point-bipolar Likert scale. Responses of “some-
what helpful/more confident,” “helpful/more confident,” and “very
helpful/much more confident” were treated as positive for test
utility or increased confidence, respectively. Patient decisional
conflict was measured pre- and post-GPS testing by the Deci-
sion Conflict Scale (DCS), a 16-item validated scale for mea-
surement of patient decisional conflict.19 The DCS measures
a patient’s perception of (1) uncertainty in choosing options;
(2) factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling unin-
formed, unclear about personal values, and unsupported in de-
cision making; (3) effective decision making. Low decisional
conflict was determined in this study by a DCS score of less than
or equal to 25 (scaled 0-100).
Data Capture and Administration
The clinical data collected for the study patients were
captured using the Electronic Data Capture system eClinicalOS,
compliant with 21CFR11. The baseline cohort chart review
was conducted and delivered by Clarity Pharma Research, LLC
(Spartanburg, SC).
Statistical Methods
The impact of GPS testing on shared management decision
was assessed for each individual NCCN risk group. The analysis
summarized the proportion of patients for whom the manage-
ment recorded on the case report form shifted from IT to AS (and
vice versa) pre- to post-assay. Similar analysis was performed across
each individual NCCN risk group.
Persistence on AS was defined as the number of evaluable pa-
tients who initially selected AS and were documented as
intervention-free at a 12-month visit divided by the number of
patients who chose AS for their shared management decision and
had 12-month visit data. Similar analyses were conducted to es-
timate the proportion of patients who persisted on AS by com-
bined GPS + NCCN biological risk group defined by the likelihood

 of favorable pathology of ≥79%, 68-78%, ≤67% for very low-, low-,
and intermediate-risk, respectively, as specified in the study pro-
tocol and per standard practice for GPS.
RESULTS
The baseline cohort consisted of 247 men with PCa di-
agnosed between January 2012 and September 2014. The
prospective cohort consisted of 297 patients from 22 com-
munity centers with valid GPS results, complete pre-
GPS management recommendations, and post-GPS shared
management decisions. The clinicopathologic character-
istics were similar between the baseline chart review cohort
(n = 247) and the observational study analysis cohort
(n = 258) (Table 1). Of the 297 tested patients, 258 had
evaluable data to assess AS persistence at 12 months
(Fig. 1).
The NCCN + GPS-incorporated risk refinement for
the observational study cohort is presented in Figure 2
and Supplemental Table S2. Overall, nearly 1 in 4 (23%)
of patient’s risk was restratified. Of 111 patients with NCCN
low-risk PCa, 63 (57%) were confirmed as GPS + NCCN
low-risk, 36% were predicted to have more favorable disease
consistent with very low-risk, and 7% were predicted to
have less favorable disease consistent with intermediate-risk.
The assay’s clinical utility was assessed by calculating the
change from the pre-GPS management recommendation
to the post-GPS shared management decision as re-
corded in the Electronic Data Capture. Among men with
NCCN low-risk disease the management plan changed for
28% (31/111) of patients following GPS testing. Over half,
51% (21/41), of all NCCN low-risk men who initially rec-
ommended IT selected AS, whereas 14% (10/70) of those
who initially recommended AS switched to IT. Incorpo-
ration of GPS in risk assessment led to changes in initial
management in men with very low- and intermediate-
risk cancer; the change rate was 16% (11/68) and 23%
(18/79) for NCCN very low- and intermediate-risk men,
respectively. In the NCCN very low and low groups, most
changes in management selection were toward AS. Shared
treatment decisions were directionally consistent with GPS
predicted risk.
Shared decision was for AS in 62% (159/258) of GPS-
tested men compared with 40% (98/247) of men in the
baseline group (Fig. 3). Selection of AS for initial man-
agement was higher in the GPS-tested cohort vs the base-
line cohort across all NCCN risk categories; AS was elected
in 88% (60/68) vs 57% (44/77) of very low-risk patients,
73% (81/111) vs 43% (39/90) in low-risk patients, and 23%
(18/79) vs 19% (15/80) in intermediate-risk patients in
GPS-tested vs baseline cohorts, respectively.
For patients who received GPS testing and chose AS,
the 1-year AS persistence rate was 89% (141/159). It
was 90% (79/88), 88% (44/50), and 86% (18/21) for
GPS + NCCN very low-, low-, and intermediate-risk pa-
tients, respectively. In the baseline cohort, the 1-year AS
persistence rate was 86% (84/98). It was 89% (39/44), 85%
(33/39), and 80% (12/15) for NCCN very low-, low-, and
intermediate risk patients, respectively (Fig. 4A). The overall
proportion of patients who selected and persisted on AS
at 1 year was higher in the GPS-tested than in the untested
cohort: 55% (141/258) vs 34% (84/247) (62% relative dif-
ference), respectively (Fig. 4B).
Use of the GPS enhanced physician-reported confi-
dence and reduced patient decisional conflict across all
NCCN risk categories and management modalities. Phy-
sicians reported GPS useful and a source of increased con-
fidence in 90% and 92% of cases, respectively. Among
patients, 96% found GPS useful in decision making. Mean
patient DCS fell from 29 to 16 post-GPS testing. Low DCS
(<25) was reported by 59% of men after being compared
with 36% before GPS testing, indicating that GPS testing
decreased decisional conflict.
COMMENT
In this prospective study of clinically low-risk PCa pa-
tients from geographically diverse large community prac-
tices, the personalized information provided by GPS led
to a 23% refinement of individual risk. Initial shared treat-
ment decision for AS was 40% in the baseline group com-
pared with 62% in the GPS-tested cohort; 55% of men in
the GPS-tested cohort selected and remained on AS at 1
year, compared with 34% of men within the baseline cohort.
Both physicians and patients found the assay added

 Figure 1. Analysis cohort for decision impact and 1-year active surveillance persistence from the prospective study. A total
of 297 patients with valid Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) results, complete pre-GPS management recommendation, and
post-GPS shared management decision was included in the analysis, with 26%, 44%, and 30% of National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) very low-, low-, and intermediate-risk distribution. A total of 258 patients (87%) had complete 1-year
follow-up status by the time of data lock, and the rest of 39 (13%) were lost to follow-up or with unknown visit status. The
total number of AS patients who were evaluable for 1-year persistence status was 159.
Figure 2. Genomic Prostate Score + National Comprehensive Cancer Network (GPS + NCCN) risk refinement. Of 111 pa-
tients with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), 63 (57%) were confirmed as GPS + NCCN low-risk, 36% were more favor-
able and had GPS + NCCN consistent with very low-risk, and 7% were less favorable and consistent with intermediate-risk.
Among NCCN intermediate-risk patients, 3 (4%) had GPS + NCCN consistent with low-risk and 96% were confirmed as GPS + NCCN
intermediate-risk. Of patients with NCCN very low-risk, 10% were considered less favorable, 7% consistent with NCCN low-
risk, and 3% consistent with NCCN intermediate-risk disease.

 confidence and certainty to their decision making; 96%
of patients found the test useful, and 92% of physicians
felt it increased their confidence in their management
recommendation.
Both the patient demographics and the AS selection rates
from the baseline cohort were representative of PCa pa-
tients and AS cohorts from the same time period. Recent
data from CapSURE20 reported AS utilization rates of about
40% in patients with clinically low-risk PCa. The rate of
AS in CapSURE was similar to that of the baseline cohort
in this study but substantially lower than the pre-GPS rec-
ommendations that were reported in the prospective arm
of the study. Despite a high rate of AS in the baseline group,
AS utilization was markedly higher in the GPS-tested
cohort. These results support the impact and utility of GPS
testing for guiding management.
The 62% relative increase in the pool of men persist-
ing on AS at 1 year suggests that the personalized risk in-
formation provided by GPS testing not only identifies
patients at lower risk of disease progression, but also helps
relieve anxiety and provide the necessary confidence to
adhere to AS over the early post-diagnosis timeframe.
Whereas there was a substantial increase in persistence on
AS at 1 year, AS selection was lower in GPS-tested pa-
tients with intermediate-risk disease compared with un-
tested patients with intermediate-risk disease. This highlights
how GPS is not simply a tool for promoting and expand-
ing of AS, but rather a tool for selecting optimal manage-
ment (ie, surveillance OR treatment) based on an individual
estimation of risk.
Overall, incorporation of GPS led to a change from
initial recommendation to shared decision in nearly 1 of
4 patients (23%). Importantly, physicians reported greater
confidence and patients reported less decisional conflict
after GPS testing; this underscores the additional patient-
centered value of the test, regardless of absolute rates and
direction of change in management. With 1 exception, all
changes in management decision were directionally con-
sistent with GPS results. Specifically, GPS suggested con-
sistent or greater-than-expected risk of adverse pathology
in all cases where the decision changed from surveillance
to intervention. Similarly, GPS suggested consistent or
lower-than-expected risk of adverse pathology in almost
all cases where management changed from intervention to
surveillance. This suggests that the personalized informa-
tion provided by GPS is understandable to patients and
providers and helps to guide decision making in patients
who may feel uncertain about their initial management se-
lection. These results differ from published data for Prolaris
(Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). A biopsy-
based registry study reported 13% of patients with cancer
that was less aggressive than expected changed from non-
intervention to intervention, whereas 11% of patients with
disease that was more aggressive than expected changed
from intervention to nonintervention.21
A substantial proportion of participants (15%) in this
analysis were African American, a population group that
experiences significant health disparities in terms of PCa
treatments and outcomes.22 Some experts have cited
evidence of higher rates of upgrading at surgery23 and
progression24 on AS to suggest that noninterventional strat-
egies should be considered selectively in African-American
men.25 The GPS was validated in a cohort with substan-
tial representation of African-American men,15 and the
current study provides further evidence for the utility of
GPS in the African-American PCa population.
Figure 3. Comparison of active surveillance utilization rate. Overall, 62% chose active surveillance (AS) as a shared man-
agement decision in the prospective cohort after using the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) assay, compared with 40% in
the baseline untested group. Utilization of AS was higher in GPS-tested groups vs baseline groups across all National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories.

 There were several limitations to the current report. This
manuscript is based on an interim analysis of the first 297
patients enrolled in a large (N = 1200), multicenter pro-
spective trial, and should thus be considered preliminary.
There were marked differences between participating prac-
tices in terms of baseline utilization of AS; this may impact
change rates in a meaningful fashion. Definitive surgical
pathology was not available in patients who chose AS. The
high rates of initial decision for AS in the GPS-tested cohort
could be partly due to a Hawthorne effect; providers may
have overstated their utilization of AS at baseline in this
study that was focused on a test for AS decision making.
The actual rate of AS in routine practice could be lower
than what had been collected on the study. Despite these
limitations, this analysis highlights the potential benefits
of incorporating genomic testing into individualized risk
estimation and shared decision making for PCa patients
in a real-world setting.
CONCLUSION
Biopsy-based genomic assays improve risk refinement and
help guide decision making for patients with PCa. The
Oncotype DX GPS assay refines personalized estimates of
PCa risk beyond clinical factors to inform management at
the time of diagnosis. Use of GPS in shared decision making
improves confidence, reduces decision conflict, and en-
hances persistence on AS.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
“One should reconsider perpetually one’s reasons for doing
something, because it may be that circumstances have
changed.”
―Richard Feynman
A report in this issue of Urology describes interim analysis of
a multi-institutional study to evaluate the impact of the Oncotype
DX® 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) on clinical decision-
making by urologists and patients. The primary outcomes were
initial selection and one year persistence on active surveillance
(AS).1 Prostate cancer patients at 22 community urology prac-
tices were offered participation during 2014-2015. Urologists re-
corded their initial management recommendation based on clinical
characteristics prior to meeting the patient, then GPS testing,
discussion of results, and shared management decision were made
over the course of 3 patient visits. In lieu of a prospective base-
line (control) group, charts of patients meeting the same eligi-
bility criteria at nine practices with the largest enrollment were
retrospectively reviewed for 2012-2014, and the shared treat-
ment decision was defined as the treatment recorded in the chart.
The GPS score reclassified risk for 23% of patients, and final
treatment decisions differed from the urologist initial recommen-
dation for 28% of patients. Active surveillance was chosen by
62% of GPS-tested patients, compared to 40% in the baseline
cohort, and maintained at one year among 53% vs. 34%, respec-
tively. Among those who chose AS one year persistence was 89%
in the GPS-tested vs. 86% in the baseline cohort.

 The authors are to be congratulated for this complex study
representing real-world practice in the community. Most
biomarker research focuses on the magnitude of risk estimates,
yet precision medicine will depend on biomarker impact on
treatment decisions and ultimately, how those decisions improve
outcomes.
What does this report tell us about GPS impact on treatment
decisions? Considering just the GPS cohort, the post-GPS shared
decision differed from the urologist’s pre-GPS initial recommen-
dation for 23% of patients. Most treatment decisions were con-
sistent with GPS-predicted risk, suggesting that pre-post changes
largely reflect the impact of GPS.
More difficult to interpret are differences between the retro-
spective baseline cohort and prospective GPS-tested patients.
Baseline patients included anyone who met eligibility criteria in
the 9 urology practices, whereas the prospective GPS cohort was
comprised of self-selected patients, potentially over-representing
patients more prone to information-seeking or knowledgeable about
genomic testing, which could induce selection bias. Pre-GPS treat-
ment recommendations were only provided for NCCN low risk
men; 63% were recommended AS. This differs markedly from the
40% AS rate for the overall baseline cohort, suggesting the cohorts
were not comparable. Thus, the overall post-GPS AS rate of 62%
and one year persistence rate of 55% are likely to be biased by
the much higher pre-GPS rate. Among men who did select AS,
persistence at one year was similar for the baseline (86%) and
GPS cohort (89%), indicating that GPS information was un-
likely to have influenced AS persistence. It would have been useful
to compare the baseline to pre- and post-GPS results among only
the 9 practices used to derive the baseline cohort.
One other study has demonstrated the ability of a commer-
cially available genomic test to influence initial treatment
decisions.2 However, neither study included a contemporary pre-
post control intervention, obscuring the individual impact of the
genomic test, differences between pre- and post-test settings, and
any contribution of regression to the mean.3
More broadly, evaluation of prognostic test utility for preci-
sion medicine may require trial designs similar to those for com-
panion diagnostics4 to determine whether patients whose treatment
decision is based on the prognostic test combined with clinical
factors have better outcomes than patients receiving the same
treatment based on clinical factors alone.

AUTHOR REPLY
We appreciate the editor’s kind remarks and insightful review of
our paper.
As the editor points out, patients who opted to participate in
this study may have been more prone to information seeking and
amenable to changes in management plan; therefore, these results
may not be reflective of patients who have already made treat-
ment decisions. The intention of Genomic Prostate Score (GPS)
is to augment the information provided by clinical risk alone with
personal molecular information to help decision making. As
knowledge of genomic testing is promulgated, more patients and
their physicians will approach treatment decisions in prostate
cancer (PCa) by including information provided by novel tech-
nologies such as magnetic resonance imaging and genomic pro-
filing. GPS is validated as a predictor of adverse pathology
and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in both
prospective1 and retrospective cohorts,2,3 and more recently as a
predictor of metastasis and PCa-specific mortality.4 Finally, the
utility of GPS for initial management of PCa is presented in this
study5 and in prior publications.6,7
Please note, the 62% referenced by the editor is the propor-
tion of patients who made a shared decision for active surveil-
lance (AS) in the GPS tested cohort and not the physician
recommendation. In contrast, the shared decision for AS was 40%
in the baseline cohort. The cohorts were comparable in clinical
parameters and drawn from 9 practices which participated in the
prospective arm of the study. At the editor’s suggestion, we ana-
lyzed the rates of AS and AS persistence for the 9 sites, and the
rates were nearly identical to that of the overall cohort (62% AS
with 88.5% persistence). Although temporal trends may have con-
tributed to the increase in AS utilization between cohorts, the
substantial change rate in the GPS-tested group, the fact that over
half (51%) of low-risk men initially recommended intervention
elected AS, the bidirectional change in shared decision, and the
profound impact of GPS on patient decision conflict indicate that
GPS was responsible for a substantial proportion of higher AS
utilization and thereby helped to expand the pool of eligible patients.
We acknowledge that there was not a “control intervention”;
however, our intention was to compare GPS to the local stan-
dard of care. We agree that the ultimate goal for a biomarker is
to provide not just prognostic information but rather predictive
information.8 Genomic Health pioneered genomics in oncology
with the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score initially as a prog-
nostic marker. It was later with longer term prospective data that
the assay was validated as a predictive marker and is now the es-
tablished standard of care.9 It is our intention to follow the same
development path in prostate cancer.
Early persistence on AS is similar between the cohorts as
many men today will not have surveillance biopsies until 18 or
24 months; thus, it may be challenging to improve upon this. By
increasing the pool of patients on AS, GPS is confirmed as a valu-
able tool and decision aid for enhancing and guiding AS utili-
zation and management.
