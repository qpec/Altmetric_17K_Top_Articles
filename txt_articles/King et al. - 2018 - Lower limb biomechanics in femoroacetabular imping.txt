Objective (1) Identify differences in hip and pelvic 
biomechanics in patients with femoroacetabular 
impingement syndrome (FAIS) compared with controls 
during everyday activities (eg, walking, squatting); and 
(2) evaluate the effects of interventions on hip and pelvic 
biomechanics during everyday activities.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus and 
SPORTDiscus until February 2017.
Methods Primary aim: studies that investigated hip 
or pelvic kinematics and/or joint torques of everyday 
activities in patients with FAIS compared with the 
asymptomatic contralateral limb or a control group. 
Secondary aim: studies that evaluated effects of 
conservative or surgical interventions on patients with 
FAIS using pre-post or controlled clinical trial designs. 
Biomechanical data must have been collected using 
three-dimensional motion capture devices. Reporting 
quality was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal 
Instrument and data were pooled (standardised mean 
difference (SMD), 95% CI) where populations and 
primary outcomes were similar.
Results Fourteen studies were included (11 cross-
sectional and three pre/post intervention), varying between 
low and moderate reporting quality. Patients with FAIS 
walked with a lower: peak hip extension angle (SMD 
−0.40, 95% CI −0.71 to −0.09), peak internal rotation 
angle (−0.67, 95% CI −1.19 to −0.16) and external 
rotation joint torque (−0.71, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.35), and 
squatted to a lesser depth with no difference in hip flexion 
range. Pre/post intervention data were limited in number 
and quality, and to surgical cohorts.
Conclusion This review suggests that patients with 
FAIS may demonstrate hip biomechanical impairments 
during walking and squatting, with minimal literature 
available to comment on other tasks.
Clinical relevance The information presented in 
the review provides insight into the biomechanical 
differences associated with FAIS; however, the between-
group differences were small to moderate. This 
information may aid in the development of management 
strategies for people with the condition.

InTRODuCTIOn
Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is 
a motion-related condition with a complex presenta-
tion of morphology, symptoms and clinical signs.1 It is 
associated with the development of labral tears2 3 and 
an increased risk of hip osteoarthritis (OA).4 Recent 
recommendations from the Warwick agreement 
concluded that FAIS has a complex presentation and 
can only be diagnosed with the presence of assess-
ment findings, symptoms in positions of impingement 
(flexion and internal rotation) and variances in bony 
hip morphology.1 Pincer morphology is character-
ised by overcoverage of the acetabulum, whereas cam 
morphology is characterised by an increase in bone 
formation at the femoral head-neck junction.5 The 
presence of morphological changes without clinical 
signs and symptoms is not considered to be FAIS,1 and 
does not dictate that the individual will develop FAIS.6 
Cam morphology has been reported in up to 60%–90% 
of athletic populations.7–10 However, the factors that 
delineate those who develop symptoms and those who 
do not are unclear. Since FAIS is a movement-related 
condition, biomechanical impairments associated with 
FAIS may play a role in symptom development and 
persistence, as well as structural joint deterioration.
Biomechanical impairments have been described 
in patients with FAIS but few syntheses have been 
performed. A recent systematic review concluded 
that patients with FAIS had lower range of motion 
(ROM) into positions of impingement.11 However, 
the review was based on few available studies and 
meta-analyses were not conducted to pool study 
findings. Since the completion of the search strategy 
in 2013, additional studies investigating the biome-
chanics during everyday activities in patients with 
FAIS have been reported.
The best treatment options for those with FAIS 
are unknown. Arthroscopic surgery is increasingly 
popular, and intends to treat patients with FAIS by 
restoring the femoral head-neck offset12 to regain 
function and relieve symptoms. However, the rates 
of arthroscopy are increasing despite the lack of 
supporting evidence.13 The effects of surgical or 
conservative interventions on biomechanical impair-
ments are not clear. Therefore, the aims of this system-
atic review were to: (1) identify differences in hip and 
pelvic biomechanics in patients with FAIS compared 
with controls during everyday activities (eg, walking 
and squatting); and (2) evaluate the effects of inter-
ventions on hip and pelvic biomechanics during these 
activities.

Review
search strategy
A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, 
EMBASE, Scopus and SPORTDiscus from the earliest date until 
February 2017. The search strategy was developed around two 
concepts with MeSH and keywords (limited to title and abstract) 
adapted to individual databases (Population: FAIS; keyword exam-
ples: ‘femoroacetabular impingement’, ‘cam impingement’, ‘pincer 
impingement’. Outcome: biomechanics; keywords: ‘kinetics’, 
‘kinematics’, ‘biomechanics’) (online supplementary A). Articles 
were imported into Endnote V
.X7 and duplicates removed. T
wo 
reviewers (MGK and PRL) independently reviewed the title and 
abstracts of the Endnote library, and disagreements were resolved 
by consensus, or a third reviewer (AIS). After title and abstract 
screening, full-text articles of potentially suitable studies were 
obtained to determine their eligibility. Reference checking, citation 
tracking in Scopus and manual searching of ahead-of-print listing 
in journals of included papers were conducted to ensure all rele-
vant studies were included.
selection criteria
For the primary aim, studies were eligible if they included partic-
ipants with FAIS and compared data with healthy controls, or 
the contralateral asymptomatic limb. For the secondary aim, 
studies were included if they evaluated the effect of a conser-
vative or surgical intervention on patients with FAIS. This 
included single group pre-post designs where baseline scores 
were available for comparison with post-intervention scores. 
It also included cross-sectional studies where post-intervention 
scores of one group were compared with outcomes of a group 
who did not undergo any specific intervention. Included studies 
must have collected kinematic or joint torque data during activ-
ities using three-dimensional motion capture devices. Kinematic 
data must have been reported as means, peaks or total ROM 
and joint torque data must have been reported as means, peaks 
or impulses. Where duplicates of published data existed, the 
study with the larger sample size was included. Opinion pieces, 
editorials, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, case studies, 
book chapters, conference abstracts and studies published in a 
language other than English were excluded.
Reporting quality
Included studies’ reporting quality was rated using a modified 
version of the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument (EAI).15 
The EAI is appropriate to assess the reporting quality of obser-
vational15 16 and intervention studies.15 Items that were not 
relevant to observational and pre/post intervention studies were 
removed. Items were scored as ‘Yes’ (2 points), ‘Partial’ (1 point), 
‘No’ (0 point), ‘Unable to Determine’ (0 point) or ‘Not Appli-
cable’. The maximal obtainable score for an observational study 
was 54, and 66 for a pre/post intervention study. Included studies 
were given a rating of high, moderate or low reporting quality 
based on the following criteria: high, >70% 
score on the EAI; 
moderate, ≤70% 
and >50%; and low, ≤50%. T
wo reviewers 
(MGK and PRL) independently reviewed the studies against the 
items and where consensus could not be made, a third reviewer 
(AIS) independently reviewed the paper.
Data extraction
Information on study design, sample characteristics (eg, age, sex, 
inclusion criteria), hip and pelvic kinematics, and joint torques 
were extracted and entered into Excel by one reviewer (MGK) 
with a random selection of 50% of the extracted data checked by 
another reviewer (PRL). All kinematic and joint torque data were 
extracted during stance phase where possible and data that were 
reported in text as graphs were digitised and extracted using Digiti-
zeIt (DigitizeIt, Braunschweig, Germany). For pre/post intervention 
studies that included data on asymptomatic controls, the pre-inter-
vention and control data were extracted to address the primary 
outcome, whereas the pre/post intervention data were extracted 
for the secondary outcome. Where included studies reported 
subsets of data from a smaller sample of additionally published 
work, the data from the larger sample were taken. However, if the 
larger sample had incomplete data, the study with the smaller, but 
complete data set was used for meta-analysis. If necessary, authors 
were contacted for further information to confirm eligibility and 
facilitate accurate data extraction.
Data analysis
Extracted data on hip and pelvic kinematics, and joint torques 
were grouped according to planes of motion for all included 
studies. Torque data that were reported as internal moments were 
multiplied by −1 and reported as external moments for summary 
and analysis. Standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CIs 
were calculated for all variables analysed in the FAIS versus 
control population by dividing the difference between groups by 
the pooled SD. Where multiple studies were available, data were 
pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model (Review 
Manager V
.5.3). To maintain sufficient clinical homogeneity for 
data pooling, studies were grouped according to population (eg, 
cam-only FAIS) and outcome (eg, peak hip extension). Cohen’s 
criteria were used to interpret pooled SMD with a large effect 
defined as ≥0.8, moderate >0.5 
and <0.8, and a small effect 
defined as ≤0.5 
and ≥0.20.17 
Statistical heterogeneity was evalu-
ated from pooled data using the I2 statistic, where a value of 25%, 
50% or 75% was considered low, moderate or high level hetero-
geneity, respectively.18 In the event that data were unable to be 
pooled in a meta-analysis, a qualitative synthesis was conducted 
by reporting the SMD and 95% 
CI, along with the reporting 
quality. Where data were estimated from graphs of included 
studies, sensitivity analyses were conducted with the estimated 
data removed.
Subgroup analyses were conducted on data reported for 
patients with cam-only FAIS. Specifically, subgroups were defined 
as cam-only FAIS when the study’s eligibility criteria included 
symptomatic patients with cam morphology and excluded those 
with combined (defined as an individual with both cam and 
pincer morphology in the same hip) or pincer-only morphology. 
A random effects model was used to pool the SMD and 95% 
CI 
to determine the effect. Due to the limited pre/post intervention 
data, only qualitative analyses were conducted.
Definitions of levels of evidence were adapted from van 
Tulder et al19 and consistent with those used in previous reviews 
with similar included study types.20–22 Allocation of levels of 
evidence were based on the reporting quality and defined as: 
(1) strong if the pooled data were statistically homogenous 
(P>0.05) and obtained from three or more studies of which 
two were classed as high quality; (2) moderate if the pooled 
data were obtained from three or more studies, which were 
statistically heterogeneous (P<0.05), and one of the studies 
was classed as high quality; or data pooled from multiple 
moderate/low quality, statistically homogenous studies; (3) 
limited if the data obtained were from one high-quality study; 
or two homogenous moderate/low quality studies; or multiple 
statistically heterogeneous moderate/low quality studies; (4) 
insufficient if the data were obtained from one moderate/
low-quality study; (5) conflicting if the pooled data were not 
statistically significant and from multiple statistically heteroge-
neous studies with inconsistent findings.

search strategy and reporting quality
The search strategy identified 21 227 articles for evaluation 
(figure 1). Following the removal of duplicates, 15 289 arti-
cles were evaluated for inclusion. Title and abstract screening 
excluded 15 223 and 66 full-text articles were assessed for 
eligibility with 14 meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Of the 14 included studies, 11 were cross-sectional and three 
were pre/post intervention studies. All studies investigated 
the biomechanics associated with the primary diagnosis of 
FAIS. T
wo intervention studies included control and pre-in-
tervention data and were therefore included in both aims. 
One study23 presented some data that were a replication of a 
larger sample24; where the larger sample presented incomplete 
data, the smaller more complete data set was taken for the 
meta-analysis.
A total of 215 symptomatic patients (158 men, 57 women; 
mean age range 24.7–40.1 years) with the primary diagnosis 
of FAIS, as well as 236 controls (158 men, 78 women; 27.1–
43.2 years) were included in the review (table 1 and 2). Seven 
of the 14 studies only included participants with cam-type 
FAIS (n=86, 56 men) and seven studies included a variety 
of cam, pincer and combined type FAIS. FAIS was diagnosed 
through X-ray, MRI or CT with alpha angle inclusion ranging 
from >50° to >60° for cam morphology and centre edge angle 
(CEA) inclusion ranging from >35° to >39° or a positive 
crossover sign for pincer morphology. No studies investigated 
the effects of conservative interventions and three case series 
studies evaluated the effects of surgical interventions on kine-
matics and joint torques.
Comparisons in biomechanics between FAIS and controls 
were described during walking,12 23–29 squatting,28 30–32 drop 
landing,28 ascending stairs12 33 and sit-to-stand.34 Comparisons 
of pre/post intervention biomechanics were described during 
walking,12 23 squatting35 and ascending stairs.12 Reporting quality 
score per item ranged from 0.82 to 1.37 with zero high, nine 
moderate and five low-quality studies (online supplementary B). 
All included studies reported their aims/hypothesis, participant 
characteristics, used standardised motion capture methods and 
adjusted for covariates where applicable. No included studies 
blinded observers or outlined assessment period.
FInDIngs
Walking sagittal plane hip kinematics: FAIs versus controls
Pooled data of sagittal plane kinematics showed moderate 
evidence of a small effect for lower peak hip extension angle 
(SMD −0.40, 95% 
CI −0.71 to −0.09; heterogeneity I2=0%, 
P=0.60)12 24 25 27 28 and moderate evidence of a moderate effect 
for total sagittal plane ROM (−0.51, 95% CI −0.93 to −0.08; 
I2=0%, P=0.66)12 26 28 but no difference (−0.19, 95% CI 
−0.47 to 0.08; I2=0%, P=0.46) in peak hip flexion angle12 24–28 
(figure 2A) during stance in patients with FAIS compared with 
controls (figure 2A).
T
wo additional studies reported data on total ROM during a 
full walking cycle (ie, stance and swing phase),23 25 pooled data 
provided limited evidence of a large effect that patients with FAIS 
walked with less total sagittal plane ROM compared with controls 
(−0.98, 95% CI −1.57 to −0.40; I2=0%, P=0.43) (figure 2A).
Walking frontal plane hip kinematics: FAIs versus controls
Pooled data showed moderate evidence of no difference in peak 
hip adduction angle (−0.06, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.31; I2=27%, 
P=0.24)12 24 25 27 28 and peak hip abduction angle during stance 
(−0.29, 95% CI −0.77 to 0.20; I2=57%, P=0.07)12 24 26 27 
(figure 2B). Total frontal plane ROM in stance was pooled from 
four studies, with moderate evidence (−0.31, 95% CI −0.84 
to 0.23; I2=50%, P=0.11) of no difference between FAIS and 
control groups12 25 26 28 (figure 2B).
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
One moderate quality study25 investigated peak hip abduction angle 
in swing phase, with insufficient evidence of no between-group 
differences (SMD −0.55, 95% 
CI −1.29 to 0.20) (table 3). One 
low-quality study23 reported data on frontal plane ROM in a full 
walking cycle. This review found insufficient evidence that patients 
with FAIS walked with less total frontal plane ROM compared with 
controls (−1.22, 95% CI −2.13 to −0.31) (table 3).
Walking transverse plane hip kinematics: FAIs versus controls
Pooled transverse plane kinematics demonstrated moderate 
evidence of a moderate effect for lower peak hip internal rotation 
angle (−0.67, 95% CI −1.19 to −0.16; I2=47%, P=0.15)12 25 27

(figure 2C) but no difference in peak hip external rotation angle 
(0.14, 95% CI –0.18 to 0.46; I2=0%, P=0.41)12 26–28 and total 
transverse plane ROM (−0.14, 95% CI −0.73 to 0.45; I2=46%, 
P=0.16)12 26 28 during stance in patients with FAIS compared with 
controls (figure 2C). Total transverse plane ROM in a full walking 
cycle was reported in two studies, with pooled data showing 
limited evidence of no difference between groups (−0.08, 95% CI 
−0.63 to 0.47; I2=0%, P=0.65)23 25 (figure 2C).
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
T
wo studies, with similar samples,23 24 reported peak hip internal 
and external rotation angles in a full walking cycle. The study 
with the larger sample reported no difference in peak internal 
and external rotation angles.24 Diamond et al25 found no 
between-group differences (0.02, 95% CI −0.71 to 0.75) in 
peak hip external rotation angle in swing (table 3).
Walking pelvic kinematics: FAIs versus controls
Due to the variability in collection and inconsistencies of 
reporting pelvic kinematics, qualitative synthesis was performed 
on information regarding pelvic kinematics.
Sagittal plane pelvic kinematics: FAIS versus controls
One low-quality26 study and one moderate-quality12 study 
described limited evidence of no difference in peak anterior 
pelvic tilt angle during stance (0.16, 95% CI −0.78 to 0.46; 
0.12, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.80, respectively) (table 4).One 
low-quality study26 found that patients with FAIS had a greater

Review
sagittal plane pelvic ROM in stance (0.85, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.50) 
and one moderate-quality study24 found no difference in total 
sagittal ROM during a full walking cycle (table 4).
Frontal plane pelvic kinematics: FAIS versus controls
Frontal pelvic obliquity did not differ for pelvic drop (−0.31, 
95% CI −0.93 to 0.3226; −0.48, 95% CI −1.20 to 0.2324) in 
one low-quality26 study and one moderate24-quality study or 
pelvic hike (rise) (−0.29, 95% CI −1.00 to 0.43) (table 4) in one 
moderate-quality study during stance phase.24 One low-quality 
study26 found no difference in total ROM in stance (−0.33, 95% 
CI −0.95 to 0.30) (table 4), whereas Kennedy et al24 reported 
that patients with FAIS walked with less total pelvic frontal plane 
ROM during a complete walking cycle.
Transverse plane pelvic kinematics: FAIS versus controls
Transverse plane pelvic kinematics was evaluated by one low-qu-
lity26 and two moderate-quality studies,12 24 and no studies 
reported any differences between groups. Specifically, no differ-
ences were reported for peak pelvic internal rotation angle in 
stance (−0.54, 95% CI −1.17 to 0.09)26 (table 4), peak internal 
and external rotation angles during a full walking cycle,24 total 
transverse plane ROM (−0.02, 95% CI −0.64 to 0.60; 0.20, 
95% CI −0.47 to 0.88)12 26 (table 4) and total transverse plane 
ROM during a full walking cycle.24
Walking joint torques: FAIs versus controls
Five included studies reported joint torque information on FAIS 
versus controls. One additional moderate-quality study reported 
no between-group differences, but provided no data.24
Pooled data from five studies23 25 27–29 demonstrated moderate 
evidence of a moderate effect size for lower peak external rota-
tion joint torque (−0.71, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.35; I2=0%, 
P=0.82) (figure 2D) in patients with FAIS compared with 
controls. There was moderate evidence of no difference in 
peak hip torques for flexion (−0.19, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.16; 
I2=21%, P=0.28), extension (−0.25, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.06; 
I2=0%, P=0.80), abduction (−0.04, 95% CI −0.39 to 0.31; 
I2=0%, P=0.53), adduction (−0.33, 95% CI −0.71 to 0.05; 
I2=0%, P=0.37) and internal rotation (−0.25, 95% CI −0.62 
to 0.13; I2=0%, P=0.73) (figure 2D). Additionally, one moder-
ate-quality29 study showed insufficient evidence that patients 
with FAIS had a greater peak hip flexion torque impulse (0.89, 
95% CI 0.25 to 1.52) and no difference in extension torque 
impulse (−0.49, 95% CI −1.11 to 0.12) (table 5).
subgroup analysis: walking kinematics and joint torques: cam 
only versus controls
Subgroup analysis of joint kinematics and external joint torques 
in cam-only populations demonstrated limited evidence of no 
difference in peak hip extension angle (−0.53, 95% CI −1.12 
to 0.06; I2=0%, P=0.82), and insufficient evidence of no 
difference in sagittal plane ROM (−0.45, 95% CI −1.48 to 
0.58) compared with controls in the stance phase of walking 
(online supplementary C). Peak hip internal rotation in stance 
was unable to be subgrouped due to lack of data and no addi-
tional subgroup analyses differed from the reported results of 
the review.
sensitivity analysis: removal of data estimated from graphs
Sensitivity analyses were conducted where manually extracted 
data from published graphs were removed from the meta-anal-
yses. Four sensitivity analyses were conducted with no 
noticeable changes in the reported results (online supplemen-
tary D).
squat kinematics: FAIs versus controls
Squatting kinematics was investigated in four studies.28 30–32 One 
study controlled squat height to a maximum depth of 25% of 
body height,28 two studies controlled squat height to a maximum 
depth of 1/3 tibial tuberosity height30 31 and one allowed 
maximum depth to be full range.32 Pooled data of reported squat 
depths showed moderated evidence of a large effect that FAIS 
participants squatted to a lesser depth than controls (SMD 0.92, 
95% CI 0.46 to 1.38; I2=0%, P=0.77) (figure 3).
Due to the variability in outcomes reported, kinematic squat 
variables were qualitatively synthesised. Hip kinematics were 
investigated by three medium-quality studies28 30 31 with no 
differences observed in all outcomes investigated. Specifically, 
no difference in peak hip angles in all three planes at maximum 
squat depth31; no difference in peak hip flexion, abduction and 
internal rotation angle between patients with FAIS and controls 
(flexion −0.62, 95% CI −1.36 to 0.11; abduction −0.01, 95% 
CI −0.73 to 0.70; internal rotation −0.65, 95% CI −1.39 to 
0.09),30 (flexion 0.02, 95% CI −0.99 to 1.03; abduction −1.04, 
95% CI −2.14 to 0.06; internal rotation −0.57, 95% CI −1.61 
to 0.47)28; and no difference in total ROM in all planes (sagittal 
0.58, 95% CI −0.46 to 1.63; frontal −0.26, 95% CI −1.28 to 
0.76; transverse −1.06, 95% CI −2.17 to 0.04)28 (table 3).
T
wo medium-quality studies30 31 demonstrated no difference in 
pelvic tilt at maximum squat depth (0.73, 95% CI −0.01 to 1.4830; 
0.70, 95% CI −0.11 to 1.50)31 (table 4). T
otal sagittal plane pelvic 
ROM was investigated in two moderate-quality studies31 32 with 
conflicting results. Lamontagne et al31 found patients with FAIS 
squatted with less total sagittal plane pelvic ROM (−1.18, 95% 
CI −2.04 to −0.33) whereas Ng et al32 found no between-group 
differences (−0.68, 95% CI −1.40 to 0.05) (table 4).
squat joint torques: FAIs versus controls
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
Squat hip joint torques were investigated in two moderate-quality 
studies. Kumar et al28 found that patients with FAIS squatted with 
less peak hip external rotation torque (SMD −0.13, 95% CI −0.21 
to −0.05) but no difference in peak hip flexion (0.19, 95% CI 
−0.83 to 1.21), peak hip abduction (0.00, 95% CI −1.01 to 1.01) 
or peak internal rotation (−0.34, 95% CI −1.37 to 0.69) (table 5) 
joint torque. Bagwell et al30 found a lower mean hip flexion torque 
(−0.79, 95% CI −1.53 to −0.04), but no difference in mean hip 
abduction torque (0.20, 95% CI −0.51 to 0.92) and mean hip 
internal rotation torque (0.10, 95% CI −0.62 to 0.81) in patients 
with FAIS compared with controls.
Drop landing kinematics and joint torques: FAIs versus 
controls
Drop landing kinematics and joint torques were investigated in 
one moderate quality study,28 finding insufficient evidence of 
no difference in all hip kinematics and joint torque outcomes 
(table 3 and 5).
stairs kinematics and joint torques: FAIs versus controls
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
Stair ascent kinematics was investigated in one medium-quality12 
study and one low-quality33 study with conflicting results. 
Hammond et al33 found no difference in hip kinematics (table 3) 
whereas Rylander et al12 found patients with FAIS demonstrated 
a smaller peak hip extension angle (−0.83, 95% CI −1.54 to 
 on 4 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

−0.13), total hip sagittal plane ROM (−1.23, 95% CI −1.97 
to −0.49) and peak hip internal rotation angle (−0.90, 95% 
CI −1.61 to −0.19) (table 3) compared with controls. Rylander 
et al12 also found that patients with FAIS had greater total 
pelvic rotation ROM (0.95, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.67) and anterior 
pelvic tilt (1.23, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.97) (table 4) compared with 
controls. One low-quality study33 investigated hip joint torques 
during stair ascent. The results show insufficient evidence that 
patients with FAIS ascend stairs with a greater peak hip flexion 
joint torque (0.92, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.57) and no difference in 
peak hip extension and peak hip adduction torque (table 5).
sit-to-stand joint torques: FAIs versus controls
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
Peak hip flexion joint torque was investigated in one moder-
ate-quality study34 finding insufficient evidence of no differ-
ence in peak hip joint torque (−0.04, 95% CI −0.63 to 0.55) 
(table 5) between groups.
secondary outcome preintervention versus postintervention
Qualitative synthesis of unpooled studies
Three included studies (one moderate12 and two low quality23 35) 
investigated the effects of arthroscopic surgery on kinematics 
and joint torques in walking,12 23 squatting35 and ascending 
stairs12 (table 2). One study reported insufficient evidence of 
improvements in sagittal plane hip ROM, peak hip flexion angle, 
peak hip internal rotation angle and hip transverse plane ROM 
during stance phase of walking, following arthroscopic surgery.12 
Another reported insufficient evidence of no differences during 
a full walking cycle following surgery.23 During a stair ascent, 
Rylander et al12 found there was insufficient evidence of no 
change in hip and pelvic kinematics following arthroscopic 
surgery. During squatting, the postoperative participants with 
FAIS squatted to a lower depth with no difference in peak hip 
flexion angle.35
DIsCussIOn
Movement patterns of patients with FAIS were different from 
controls. Specifically, patients with FAIS had lower peak hip 
extension, total sagittal plane ROM and peak hip internal rota-
tion during stance phase of walking and squatted to a lesser 
depth, with no difference in hip flexion range. The pooled 
results of hip kinematic differences during walking build on the 
results of the previous review,11 but few conclusions can be made 
for the other tasks, and for pelvic kinematics. These represent 
areas of future research.
Reduced hip extension towards terminal stance is consistent 
with findings in early-stage hip OA,36 end-stage hip OA37 and 
following total hip replacement.38 Reduced hip extension may 
be a strategy to reduce load on the anterior hip during walking.39 
However, this behaviour has also been hypothesised to be 
maladaptive, decreasing the stimulus to anterior hip muscula-
ture, which can negatively affect hip stability over time.40 41 At 
this time, the implications of lower peak hip extension angle 
during walking are not known.
Patients with FAIS produced lower peak external rotation 
torque, and lower peak hip internal rotation angles during 
walking compared with controls. These adaptations may repre-
sent a strategy to avoid positions of internal rotation, which are 
often reported to be painful in patients with FAIS.5 As external 
moments are offset by internal moments of the antagonistic 
muscle groups/movements, a lower peak external rotation joint 
torque may decrease the demand on the internal rotators to 
minimise pain/discomfort.27
The effect size was small for lower peak hip extension angle 
(−0.40), moderate for lower peak hip internal rotation angle 
(−0.67) and moderate for lower peak hip external rotation torque 
(−0.71). The clinical implications of these differences and the long-
term effects of alterations in biomechanics on joint health and long-
term outcomes in patients with FAIS are relatively unknown, as 
no studies have evaluated these outcomes over time. Longitudinal 
studies into whether these differences in walking are associated 
with symptom or disease progression are needed to understand 
if such impairments may benefit from targeted management strat-
egies, or whether they are protective movement patterns. Such 
information would enhance our understanding of the association 
between FAIS and OA.
Participants with FAIS did not squat as deep as controls, 
despite no difference in peak hip flexion angle. Reduced squat 
depth, but no difference in peak hip flexion angle may reflect 
poor motor programming, pain or fear of the task. Before 
recommendations can be made, greater investigations into the 
barriers to squat depth need to be explored. Since squatting type 
movements are required during everyday activities, patients with 
FAIS may benefit from skill retraining as a component of conser-
vative management strategies.
There were insufficient studies to draw conclusions for clinical 
practice on tasks such as stair ascent, sit-to-stand and drop landing 
tasks. We recommend that further research be conducted into 
these and more complex activities to provide better insight into 
movement strategies associated with FAIS and whether targeting 
these differences could provide benefit in management strategies.
Over recent times there has been a rapid rise in the rates of 
arthroscopic surgery for FAIS.13 However, only three included 
studies evaluated the effects of surgical interventions on lower 
limb biomechanics during walking, squatting and ascending stairs. 
The conflicting results for the effect of surgery during walking 
may be due to surgical technique used (arthroscopic12 vs open/
combined23), FAIS type (cam, pincer, combined cohort12 vs cam23) 
or follow-up time (12 
months12 vs 10–32 
months23). The results of 
the review indicate that surgical interventions may have no effect 
on hip kinematics during ascending stairs and squatting tasks. 
Further research, determining the effects of surgical intervention 
on biomechanics, is required to draw clinical conclusions. More 
stringent reporting of postoperative rehabilitation protocols is also 
required to better interpret results and draw recommendations.

Review
The review demonstrates the absence of studies evaluating the 
effect of exercise or physiotherapy on biomechanics in patients 
with FAIS, which should be addressed in future studies.
limitations
There are limitations present in the included studies and in 
this review that require acknowledgement. The review only 
included studies published in the English language, potentially 
missing important information from studies published in other 
languages. Full data extraction was only completed by one author 
(MGK), with a random sample of 50% of the data extracted 
checked by the second author (PRL). Risk of bias assessment 
could not be performed with the reporting appraisal tool used 
for this study. Instead, cut-off scores for high, moderate and low 
reporting quality were defined. It is possible that studies with 
good reporting scores also have a high risk of bias. For example, 
all of the included studies scored ‘zero’ for outlining assessment 
period and blinding observers, resulting in a risk of potential 
detection bias. Additionally, all studies scored ‘zero’ for their 
generalisability of the results to relevant populations, decreasing 
the confidence in the external validity of the data presented. 
All of the included studies were case series or case–control, 
cross-sectional studies of low to moderate reporting quality 
and were included in the review regardless of their assessment, 
limiting the confidence in the findings of the review.42 Addition-
ally, due to the differing units in joint torque data, and the kine-
matic models used, absolute differences were not determined at 
this time, and thus SMDs were used to calculate between-group 
differences in the outcomes of the included studies. The SMD 
provides an indication of the magnitude of the between-group 
difference enabling an interpretation of the pooled analyses 
beyond statistical significance.
There were differences in the kinematic models used in the 
included studies with six using a modified Helen Hayes marker 
set,23 24 27 31 32 35seven using a segmented model12 25 28–30 33 34 and 
an Oxford foot model with plug-in gait.26 Sagittal plane kine-
matics is the most reliable output for three-dimensional motion 
capture models (with the exception of pelvic tilt), followed by 
frontal and then transverse plane.43 Minimal detectable changes 
for three-dimensional motion capture analysis should be popu-
lation specific44 and have yet to be quantified in patients with 
FAIS. Additionally, SE of measurement (SEM) should be quanti-
fied on a per-model basis, only one included study provided SEM 
values associated with their analysis.26 Due to under-reporting of 
data, temporal parameters of walking were not included in this 
review. There is an association between walking speed and hip 
joint kinematics and joint torques,45 which would need to be 
considered in future studies.
A variety of diagnostic criteria were used for the radiographic 
definition of FAIS with minimal alpha angles ranging from 50° 
to 60° and CEA from 35° to 39°. This inconsistency may have 
created variability in the included study results and altered the 
likelihood of between-group effects. The studies included in the 
review do not allow for the determination of cause or effect. 
Whether biomechanical variations occur early and cause FAIS, 
or FAIS causes these biomechanical variations, is unknown.
The majority of participants included were recruited from 
orthopaedic clinics, and hence may reflect more severe presenta-
tions than those in athletic teams or presenting to health or medical 
practitioner clinics. Future research should be conducted on 
athletic populations and involve sport-specific movements, such as 
running and cutting, to determine if more complex, higher impact 
activities present a problem for patients with FAIS. Women are also 
under-represented in the samples. Future studies could evaluate the 
association between FAIS and biomechanics in women, as smaller 
alpha angles and greater hip anteversion have been observed in 
women with hip and groin pain compared with men.46
COnClusIOn
The systematic review identified 11 cross-sectional and three 
pre-post intervention studies of low to moderate reporting 
quality. Based on pooled data of 11 studies, we found patients 
with FAIS exhibit alterations in hip movement strategies in activ-
ities such as walking and squatting, with insufficient evidence 
to draw significant clinical conclusions in tasks such as stair 
ascent, sit-to-stand and drop landings. The review found small 
to moderate alterations in hip movement strategies such as 
lower peak hip extension, peak internal rotation angle and peak 
external rotation joint torque during walking as well as a reduced 
squat depth in patients with FAIS compared with controls.

What is already known?
Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is associated 
with decreased quality of life and persistent symptoms, and is a 
risk factor for the development of hip osteoarthritis. Synthesised 
information on movement strategies in patients with FAIS is 
limited.
What are the new findings?
 
► There is moderate evidence that people with FAIS walk with 
a lower peak hip extension angle, peak hip internal rotation 
angle and external rotation joint torque, with no difference in 
peak hip flexion angle in stance.
 
► There is moderate evidence that people with FAIS are unable 
to squat as deep as controls; however, this is not due to a 
difference in hip flexion range of motion.
