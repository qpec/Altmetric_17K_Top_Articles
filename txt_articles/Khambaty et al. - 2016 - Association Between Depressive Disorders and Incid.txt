Abstract
IMPORTANCE—With the advent of highly effective antiretroviral therapy and improved 
survival, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected people are living longer and are now at 
an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is an urgent need to identify novel risk 
factors and primary prevention approaches for CVD in HIV. Although depression is prevalent in 
HIV-infected adults and is associated with future CVD in the general population, its association 
with CVD events has not been examined in the HIV-infected population.
OBJECTIVE—To examine whether depressive disorders are prospectively associated with 
incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a large cohort of adults with HIV.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Included in this cohort study were 26 144 HIV-
infected veterans without CVD at baseline (1998–2003) participating in the US Department of 
Veterans Affairs Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009. At 
baseline, 4853 veterans (19%) with major depressive disorder (MDD; International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 296.2 and 296.3) and 2296 (9%) with dysthymic 
disorder (ICD-9 code 300.4) were identified. The current analysis was conducted from January 
2015 to November 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Incident AMI (defined by discharge summary 
documentation, enzyme/electrocardiography evidence of AMI, inpatient ICD-9 code for AMI 
(410), or AMI as underlying cause of death [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code 121]) between the enrollment date and December 
31, 2009.
RESULTS—The mean (SD) age of those with MDD was 47.3 (7.9) years and for those without 
MDD was 48.2 (9.7) years. During 5.8 years of follow-up, 490 AMI events (1.9%) occurred. 
Baseline MDD was associated with incident AMI after adjusting for demographics (hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05–1.62), CVD risk factors (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04–1.60), and HIV-
specific factors (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05–1.62). Further adjustment for hepatitis C, renal disease, 
substance abuse, and hemoglobin level (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00–1.56) and antidepressant use 
(HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87–1.42) attenuated associations. Baseline dysthymic disorder was not 
associated with incident AMI.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—We report novel evidence that HIV-infected adults with 
MDD have a 30% increased risk for AMI than HIV-infected adults without MDD after adjustment 
for many potential confounders. Our findings raise the possibility that MDD may be independently 
associated with incident atherosclerotic CVD in the HIV-infected population.
With the advent of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), the lifespan of individuals 
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is improving.1 Unfortunately, these 
ART-treated, HIV-infected individuals remain at a higher risk for chronic comorbidities,

 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the leading cause of death in this population.2 Case 
in point is a recent cohort study that reported that HIV-infected adults have a 50% greater 
risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than their HIV-uninfected counterparts.3 Multiple 
factors, some that have not yet been identified, likely account for this excess CVD risk.
In the general population, prospective studies from the past 30 years provide evidence that 
depression is independently associated with incident atherosclerotic CVD.4,5 Metaanalyses 
have revealed that adults with depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder 
(MDD) or dysthymic disorder, have a 40% to 60% increased risk for developing CVD than 
those without these conditions, even after adjustment for CVD risk factors.4,5 Notably, this 
longitudinal association has been detected in both men and women and in various age and 
race/ethnicity groups, and it is comparable in strength with that of traditional CVD risk 
factors.6,7 To our knowledge, the strongest evidence that depressive disorders are risk factors 
for CVD comes from a follow-up study of a randomized clinical trial in which depression 
treatment, delivered before CVD onset, was found to halve the risk for incident CVD events 
of older primary care patients with depression.8
Given the greater risk for CVD of HIV-infected adults and adults with depression separately 
and the high prevalence (24%–40%) of depressive disorders in those with HIV,9,10a key 
remaining question is the following: Is depression independently associated with incident 
atherosclerotic CVD in the HIV-infected population? The answer to this question could have 
important clinical implications, as this line of research could identify a novel target 
(depression) and approach (depression treatment) to CVD primary prevention among HIV-
infected adults. Currently, little is known about the depression-incident CVD association in 
adults with HIV. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the prospective association of 
MDD and dysthymic disorder with incident AMI among 26 144 HIV-infected veterans in the 
Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). In addition to MDD, dysthymic disorder warrants 
attention in this context, as it is understudied11 and its milder but long-term course12 might 
have implications for CVD risk.
Methods
Participants
The VACS is a prospective, multisite cohort of HIV-infected and age-, race/ethnicity-, and 
clinical site–matched uninfected adults enrolled in the same calendar year in the US 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system. Participants in VACS have been continually 
selected for inclusion since 1998 by using an existing validated algorithm from the VA 
national electronic medical record system.13,14 For the selected participants, data are 
extracted from several sources. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy data are 
obtained from the immunology case registry, the National Pharmacy Benefits Management 
database, the Decision Support System, the National Patient Care Database, and the VA 
electronic medical record health factor data set. Cardiovascular disease data are obtained 
from Medicare, Medicaid, and VA fee-for-service data and from the Ischemic Heart 
Disease–Quality Enhancement Research Initiative.15 Death data are obtained from the VA 
vital status file, the Social Security Administration death master file, the Beneficiary 
Identification and Records Locator Subsystem, and the Veterans Health Administration

 Medical Statistical Analysis Systems inpatient data sets.3 Finally, cause of death data are 
obtained from the National Death Index. The University of Pittsburgh, Yale University, and 
West Haven VA Medical Center institutional review boards approved this study; we obtained 
a waiver of consent from West Haven VA Medical Center and the Yale School of Medicine 
to minimize a loss of privacy and to facilitate this low-risk research given the large sample of 
HIV-infected veterans. The current analysis was conducted from January 2015 to November 
2015.
For the present report, we selected all adults with HIV enrolled in the VACS (N = 27 350), 
defined as at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) codes for HIV in the VA Immunology Case Registry.13 The baseline 
enrollment date was the participant’s first clinic visit on or after April 1, 2003. As described 
in our earlier work,3 all veterans with prevalent CVD (n = 1206) were excluded using ICD-9 
code data from Medicare, Medicaid, and VA fee-for-service files during the baseline period 
(1998 to the participant’s baseline enrollment date). Our final sample included 26 144 HIV-
infected adults, who were followed up from their baseline enrollment date to either an AMI 
event, death, or the last follow-up date on December 31, 2009.
Depressive Disorders
Participants in VACS with a diagnosis of either MDD (ICD-9 codes 296.2 or 296.3) or 
dysthymic disorder (ICD-9 code 300.4) during baseline were identified as depression cases. 
Specifically, a participant with at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient ICD-9 codes in their VA 
national electronic medical record was classified as positive for either depressive disorder. 
Major depressive disorder (0 = no MDD and 1 = MDD) was our primary exposure variable, 
and dysthymic disorder (0 = no dysthymic disorder and 1 = dysthymic disorder) was our 
exploratory exposure variable.
Incident Acute Myocardial Infarction
The definition of our primary outcome, incident AMI, was identical to that of Freiberg and 
colleagues.3 Acute myocardial infarction events were identified using VA, Medicare, and 
death certificate data between enrollment date and December 31, 2009. Acute myocardial 
infarction events occurring within the VA and those transferred from non-VA hospitals were 
determined by discharge summary documentation. These events were initially extracted by 
trained abstractors and subsequently adjudicated by reviewing physician notes and medical 
records for (1) evidence of elevated serum markers of myocardial damage, including 
elevated troponin I, troponin T, or creatine kinase– myocardial band (thresholds for positive 
markers were defined by the assay used), or (2) electrocardiographic findings (ST-segment 
elevation was defined as 1 mV or higher elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads and/or left bundle 
branch block). Acute myocardial infarction events occurring at non-VA hospitals that were 
not transferred to a VA facility were detected using an inpatient ICD-9 code (410) for AMI 
in Medicare data or VA fee-for-service data files. Fatal AMI events occurring within the VA, 
those transferred from non-VA hospitals, and those occurring at non-VA hospitals not 
transferred to a VA facility were defined as an International Statistical Classification of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code for AMI (I21.0-.9) as the first-
listed underlying cause of death in death certificate data.

 Covariates
Four groups of covariates were included in our analyses. First, the demographic factors were 
age, sex (0 = male, 1 = female), and race/ethnicity (white [reference], African American, 
Hispanic, or other), which were all determined through administrative data. Second, the 
cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and 3-hydroxy-3-
methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use, which were all assessed using 
clinical, laboratory, and/or pharmacy record data collected closest to the baseline date. Blood 
pressure was defined as the average of 3 routine outpatient clinical measurements. 
Hypertension was categorized as no hypertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and no 
antihypertensive medication [reference]), controlled hypertension (<140/90 mm Hg with 
antihypertensive medication), or uncontrolled hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg).16 Low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were categorized as less than 100 mg/dL 
(reference), 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, or 160mg/dL or more (to convert to 
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 
categorized as 60 mg/dL or more (reference), 40 to 59mg/dL, or less than 40mg/dL (to 
convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). Triglyceride levels were categorized as 
less than 150mg/dL (reference) or 150mg/dL or more (to convert to millimoles per liter, 
multiply by 0.0113). Diabetes (yes/no) was identified using a previously validated metric 
that incorporates glucose measurements, antidiabetic agent use, and/or at least 1 inpatient or 
2 outpatient ICD-9 codes for diabetes.17 Statin use was defined as a prescription receipt 
from pharmacy records within 180 days of the participant’s baseline enrollment date. Third, 
the HIV-specific factors were CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and ART regimen. Data on 
CD4 cell counts (≥500/mm3 [reference], 200–499/mm3, or <200/mm3) and HIV-1 RNA 
levels (<500 copies/mL [reference] or ≥500 copies/mL) were collected at baseline. Baseline 
ART data were obtained through pharmacy data and categorized by type of regimen within 
180 days of the baseline enrollment date. Regimen was coded as nucleoside reverse-
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus protease inhibitors (reference), NRTIs plus 
nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), other regimen, or no ART 
regimen. Fourth, the other covariates were hepatitis C infection, renal disease, history of 
abuse of or dependence on alcohol or cocaine, and hemoglobin levels. Hepatitis C virus 
seropositivity (yes/no) was defined as a positive hepatitis C virus antibody test result or at 
least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient ICD-9 codes for this diagnosis.18 Renal disease was assessed 
using outpatient and clinical laboratory data collected closest to baseline and was 
categorized as estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/1.73 m3 or more 
(reference), 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m3, or less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m3. History of abuse of 
or dependence on alcohol or cocaine were separately defined using ICD-9 
codes.19Hemoglobin levels were categorized as 14 g/dL or more (reference), 12 to 13.9 
g/dL, 10 to 11.9 g/dL, or less than 10g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10).
We also examined the influence of 2 candidate behavioral mediators and antidepressant 
medication use on the depression-incident AMI association. Candidate behavioral mediators 
were baseline smoking and body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared), assessed using the VA electronic medical record health 
factor data collected through standardized clinical reminders to VA clinicians.20 Smoking 
was categorized as never (reference), current, or past, and BMI was dichotomously

 categorized (<30 [reference] or ≥30). Baseline antidepressant use was defined as 
documentation of a filled prescription for a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI) or 
tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) from VA pharmacy records during the baseline period.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted t tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables (or their 
nonparametric counterparts) to test for MDD group differences for all covariates. To 
examine the prospective association of depressive disorders with incident AMI, we 
constructed 2 sets of Cox proportional hazards models—1 set for our primary exposure 
variable, MDD, and 1 set for our exploratory exposure variable, dysthymic disorder. For 
each set, we ran4models: (1) demographics adjusted, (2) model 1 plus CVD risk factors, (3) 
model 2 plus HIV-specific factors, and (4) model 3 plus other covariates. We also conducted 
supplementary analyses to examine the influence of candidate behavioral mediators 
(baseline smoking and BMI) and antidepressant use (baseline SSRI and TCA use) by adding 
each factor individually tomodel4. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the 
effect of efavirenz use on any observed associations by replacing the ART regimen variable 
with an efavirenz-only variable in models 3 and 4.
Results
The characteristics of HIV-infected participants without baseline CVD, stratified by MDD 
status, are presented in Table 1. Significant group differences were detected for all 
characteristics, except LDL cholesterol, statin use, and HIV-1 RNA levels. During baseline, 
4853 adults (19%) with MDD and 2296 adults (9%) with dysthymic disorder were 
identified. During 5.8 median years of follow-up, 490 incident AMI events (1.9%) occurred, 
of which 226 (46%) were within or were transferred to VA facilities, 218 (45%) were 
outside the VA and never transferred to VA facilities, and 46 (9%) were AMI deaths.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the Figure illustrate time to first incident AMI event and 
depict similar curves for those with vs without MDD until year 3, after which the MDD 
group demonstrates a steeper slope (Figure, A). Cox proportional hazards models adjusted 
for demographic factors (model 1) revealed that HIV-infected adults with MDD, vs those 
without MDD, had a 31% increased risk of incident AMI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 
1.05–1.62; P = .02) (Table 2). Major depressive disorder remained significantly associated 
with AMI after further adjustment for CVD risk factors (model 2) and HIV-specific factors 
(model 3), as HIV-infected adults with MDD had a 29% (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04–1.60; P = .
02) and 30% (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05–1.62; P = .02) increased risk for incident AMI, 
respectively. The MDD–incident AMI association was not significant (P = .053) after 
additional adjustment for other covariates (model 4); however, the HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 
1.00–1.56) demonstrates that there was little change in the magnitude of this association. In 
contrast, dysthymic disorder was not significantly associated with incident AMI in any of 
the models (Figure, B and all models in Table 2; model 1: HR, 1.26, 95% CI, 0.95–1.67; 
model 2: HR, 1.27, 95% CI, 0.95–1.69; model 3: HR, 1.28, 95% CI, 0.96–1.71; and model 
4: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.90–1.61; all P > .08), although the HRs were only slightly smaller 
than those for MDD. It is worth noting that our statistical power was lower in the models

 examining dysthymic disorder, vs those examining MDD, because of the smaller percentage 
of participants with the former diagnosis (9% vs 19%). Of the covariates in model 4, age, 
race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, LDL cholesterol level, triglycerides level, CD4 cell 
count, hepatitis C infection, renal disease, and hemoglobin level were significantly 
associated with incident AMI (Table 2).
Supplementary analyses adjusting model 4 for the candidate behavioral mediators showed 
that the MDD–incident AMI association continued to fall short of significance when 
baseline smoking variables were added (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.98–1.53; P = .08) but became 
significant when baseline BMI was added (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00–1.56; P = .049) (Table 
3). Current smoking (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22–1.97; P < .001), but not past smoking (HR, 
0.57; 95% CI, 0.70–1.31; P = .78) or BMI (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61–1.04; P = .10), was 
associated with incident AMI. The MDD–incident AMI association remained nonsignificant 
(HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87–1.42; P = .37) after adjusting model 4 for baseline SSRI and TCA 
use (Table 3). Use of SSRIs (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.52; P = .048), but not TCAs (HR, 
1.10; 95% CI, 0.88–1.37; P = .41), was associated with incident AMI. Sensitivity analyses—
in which the ART regimen variable replaced the efavirenz-only variable—showed that the 
pattern of results and the magnitude of effects did not change for either MDD or dysthymic 
disorder (eTable in the Supplement).
Discussion
We report novel evidence suggesting that MDD is independently associated with AMI in the 
HIV-infected population, similar to the general population. In our sample of more than 26 
000 veterans with HIV, we found that MDD at baseline was associated with an increased 
risk for incident AMI over 5.8years of follow-up. Specifically, after adjustment for 
demographics, CVD risk factors, and HIV-specific factors, HIV-infected adults with MDD 
had a 30% greater risk for having an AMI than did HIV-infected adults without MDD. This 
elevation in AMI risk was slightly attenuated to 25% (P = .053) after further adjustment for 
other covariates, namely, hepatitis C infection, renal disease, alcohol/cocaine abuse or 
dependence, and hemoglobin levels. In contrast to MDD, baseline dysthymic disorder was 
not associated with incident AMI.
To our knowledge, this is the first large study to examine the association between depression 
and incident atherosclerotic CVD among adults with HIV. In a study by Parruti and 
colleagues,21 no association between depression symptom severity and vascular events in 
HIV was observed. However, because only 19 vascular events occurred during follow-up in 
their cohort of 210 HIV-infected patients, they likely had low power to detect an association. 
Although our findings do not agree with those of Parruti et al,21 they are in line with a 
separate analysis we conducted of the VACS data. Specifically, we found that MDD was 
independently associated with incident heart failure among HIV-infected adults.22 
Furthermore, the effect we observed in the present study is consistent with findings in the 
general population, albeit smaller in magnitude. To illustrate, in a meta-analysis of 16 
studies, depression was associated with a 57% increased risk for CVD.5 Last, our findings 
are compatible with the literature demonstrating that depression is also independently 
associated with CVD prognosis in cardiac patients without HIV.23–25

 While the factors explaining the MDD–incident CVD association in HIV are unknown, 
several candidates exist. First, the mechanisms thought to play a role in the general 
population could also operate in HIV. Potential biological mechanisms are systemic 
inflammation,26 autonomic nervous system dysfunction,27 hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis dysregulation,28 and altered platelet function.29 Elevated markers of inflammation and 
coagulation have also been found to be associated with CVD events in those with HIV.30–33 
Thus, it is possible that the presence of MDD further exacerbates the persistent 
inflammatory and coagulatory activation already present in HIV, resulting in higher CVD 
event rates. Potential behavioral mechanisms underlying the MDD–incident CVD 
association are poor health behaviors (eg, smoking and sedentary lifestyle) and treatment 
nonadherence,34 including lower adherence to CVD primary prevention efforts (eg, 
statins).35 Adjusting for smoking in our analyses only slightly attenuated the observed 
association and adjusting for BMI did not change it, suggesting that these factors may not be 
operating as mediators (Table 3). However, we examined baseline smoking and BMI and not 
changes in these factors during follow-up. Treatment nonadherence in those with HIV may 
play a larger role because lower adherence to HIV therapies or CVD primary prevention 
efforts could promote CVD. In fact, depression has been shown to reduce adherence to HIV/
AIDS treatment.36 Thus, it is possible that the presence of MDD reduces adherence to both 
HIV- and CVD-related interventions, leading to higher CVD event rates. Finally, because 
social isolation is common in depression37 and has been found to be associated with incident 
CVD38 and all-cause mortality,39 it is yet another candidate mechanism that could underlie 
the MDD–incident CVD association.
In addition to these mechanistic pathways, the use of certain medications could partially 
explain the MDD–incident CVD association in HIV-infected adults. For instance, use of the 
HIV antiretroviral efavirenz has been linked to depression, higher risk for suicidality,40 and 
AMI events.41 However, efavirenz use is an unlikely explanation of the MDD–incident AMI 
association that we observed. First, efavirenz use was lower in those with vs without MDD 
(25% vs 30%, P < .001). Second, rerunning models 3 and 4 after adding an efavirenz-only 
variable as a covariate demonstrated the same pattern of results and magnitude of effects.
The limitations of our study should be noted. First, because our depressive disorder variables 
were based on electronic medical record ICD-9 codes, some misclassification certainly 
occurred (ie, patients with unrecognized depressive disorders were classified as not having 
these conditions). However, such misclassification would bias our results to the null and 
potentially attenuate the association between depressive disorders and incident AMI. 
Second, because of the lower rates of dysthymic disorder relative to MDD, our models 
involving this exposure variable may be underpowered and, thus, may have failed to detect 
important associations. Third, because a comprehensive assessment of lifetime depression 
history is not available for the VACS, we could not evaluate the influence of the number 
and/or duration of past depressive episodes on AMI risk. Fourth, we could not examine the 
effect of depression status and depression treatment exposure during the follow-up period on 
AMI risk or the reported associations, as data regarding these factors are not currently 
available for the VACS. Fifth, our analysis could not examine the association between 
depression and CVD death nor differentiate between AMI death and sudden cardiac death. 
Sixth, our analyses did not include baseline aspirin use because aspirin use is often

 purchased over the counter and therefore incompletely captured in the VA pharmacy records. 
Last, given that more than 95% of our sample included male veterans, future studies are 
needed to determine whether our findings generalize to women and non-VA populations.
Conclusions
With the advent of ART and improved survival, HIV-infected people are living longer and 
are now at an increased risk for CVD.1,42 Thus, there is an urgent need to identify risk 
factors and primary prevention approaches for CVD in HIV. We report novel evidence that 
HIV-infected adults with MDD have a greater risk for AMI than HIV-infected adults without 
MDD after adjustment for many potential confounders. Our findings raise the possibility 
that, similar to the general population, MDD may be independently associated with incident 
atherosclerotic CVD in the HIV-infected population. Considering the dearth of research in 
this area, future epidemiologic and mechanistic studies that include women and non-VA 
populations with HIV are needed. Furthermore, there is a need for clinical trials designed to 
evaluate the effect of high-quality depression treatment on CVD risk markers and incident 
events in HIV-infected adults with depression. Ultimately, this line of research could have 
substantial clinical ramifications; it could identify a novel and prevalent CVD risk factor 
(depression) and a new CVD primary prevention approach (depression treatment), which in 
turn could help to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in adults with HIV.

 Key Points
Question
Is depression independently associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected population?
Findings
In this cohort study of 26 144 veterans without CVD, HIV-infected adults with major 
depressive disorder (MDD) had a greater risk for acute myocardial infarction than HIV-
infected adults without MDD after adjustment for many potential confounders.
Meaning
Major depressive disorder may be an independent predictor of incident atherosclerotic 
CVD in the HIV-infected population.
