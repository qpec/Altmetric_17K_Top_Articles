Abstract
Purpose: A blood test for early detection of colorectal cancer is a
valuable tool for testing asymptomatic individuals and reducing
colorectal cancer–related mortality. The objective of this study
was to develop and validate a novel blood test able to differentiate
patients with colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps (AP)
from individuals with a negative colonoscopy.
Experimental Design: A case–control, multicenter clinical
study was designed to collect blood samples from patients
referred for colonoscopy or surgery. Predictive algorithms were
developed on 75 controls, 61 large AP (LAP) �1 cm, and 45
colorectal cancer cases and independently validated on 74
controls, 42 LAP, and 52 colorectal cancer cases (23 stages
I–II) as well as on 245 cases including other colorectal findings
and diseases other than colorectal cancer. The test is based on a
29-gene panel expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells alone or in combination with established plasma tumor
markers.
Results: The 29-gene algorithm detected colorectal cancer and
LAP with a sensitivity of 79.5% and 55.4%, respectively, with
90.0% specificity. Combination with the protein tumor markers
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CYFRA21-2 resulted in a
specificity increase (92.2%) with a sensitivity for colorectal cancer
and LAP detection of 78.1% and 52.3%, respectively.
Conclusions: We report the validation of a novel blood test,
Colox�, for the detection of colorectal cancer and LAP based on a
29-gene panel and the CEA and CYFRA21-1 plasma biomarkers.
The performance and convenience of this routine blood test
provide physicians a useful tool to test average-risk individuals
unwilling to undergo upfront colonoscopy. Clin Cancer Res; 22(18);

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in
women, the third one in men, and is the second leading cause of
cancer mortality in Europe and North America (1). Each year,
more than 1.4 million patients are diagnosed with colorectal
cancer globally, and approximately half of these patients die from
the disease. Colorectal cancer represents therefore a significant
public health issue, especially in industrialized countries. When
diagnosed early, colorectal cancer has a good therapeutic response
with high survival rates, whereas advanced and metastatic stages
of the disease are associated with poor prognosis (2). The devel-
opment from premalignant lesions, such as adenomatous polyps
(AP), and the long presymptomatic course of the disease highlight
the importance of screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic
average-risk individuals.
Recent studies have confirmed that regular screening by guaiac
fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) or flexible sigmoidoscopy sig-
nificantly reduces colorectal cancer mortality (3–5). Moreover,
systematic colorectal cancer screening is cost-effective as it lowers
global healthcare costs in comparison with no screening (6–8).
Average-risk individuals are recommended to be tested at regular
intervals above the age of 50 by either gFBOT, fecal immuno-
chemical test, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy (3). Despite these
recommendations, physicians today are facing a challenge in
convincing average-risk asymptomatic individuals to be screened
for colorectal cancer due to the invasive nature of colonoscopy
and the reluctance of individuals to manipulate stool samples.
There is therefore an unmet need for an effective and routine test
for asymptomatic average-risk individuals. A blood-based test is
highly attractive due to its minimal invasiveness, convenience,
and high acceptance by individuals at average risk (9–11).

 Myelomonocytic cells from the bone marrow are recruited at
the tumor site to create an inflammatory-like microenviron-
ment promoting tumor cell proliferation, survival, motility,
angiogenesis, and immune escape (12–15). Based on preclin-
ical and clinical observations, we hypothesized that mobilized
cells circulating in the blood may be used as a biomarker for the
presence of a tumor (16–18). We have recently reported a novel
blood-based approach to detect for AP and colorectal cancer
based on this hypothesis (19). In a follow-up study, we
reported a 29-gene panel in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) for the detection of patients with colorectal cancer
or AP (20).
The objective of the present study was to use this 29-gene
panel to develop and validate a blood test that discriminates
patients with colorectal cancer and AP from individuals with-
out lesions. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the test
were validated in a multicenter, case–control study. Finally,
we investigated whether combining the newly developed 29-
gene test with protein tumor markers already in routine
clinical use for cancer management would benefit the test's
accuracy.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The DGNP-COL-0310 was a multicenter, case–control clin-
ical study in which, from June 2010 to February 2012, 1,579
participants were enrolled in seven Swiss and three South
Korean hospitals (Supplementary Materials and Methods). In
order to have a second independent sample set to prospec-
tively validate the algorithm, an extension to the study was
conducted from November 2012 to April 2013 in four Swiss
centers, which enrolled 85 additional subjects (Fig. 1). The
study protocol (DGNP-COL-0310) was approved by the
competent ethics committees and Institutional Review Boards
for research on human subjects (Supplementary Materials
and Methods). All participants provided a written informed
consent.
Study population
The study recruited subjects older than 50 years who were
referred by general practitioners for the great majority (�80%)
for a diagnostic colonoscopy and for a minority (�20%) for a
screening colonoscopy. Most of the colorectal cancer cases
(64%) were recruited among subjects who were scheduled for
surgery.
Subjects with a personal history of polyps, colorectal cancer,
other types of cancer, or with family history indicating high
risk for colorectal cancer (� 2 first-degree relatives with colo-
rectal cancer or �1 with colorectal cancer at the age< 50 years,
familial polyposis, or Lynch syndrome) were not eligible for
the study.
Following diagnosis, the enrolled participants were retro-
spectively allocated to clinically predefined groups as sum-
marized in Fig. 2. Main study groups included controls, large
AP (LAP), and colorectal cancer. Subjects in the control group
were clear from any colorectal lesions, including hyperplastic
polyps and small AP. The LAP group included patients with
at least one adenoma � 1 cm and no colorectal cancer lesion.
Categorization of adenomas into the standard classification
(i.e., advanced and nonadvanced adenoma) could not be
performed due to the fact that the histologic grading of small
adenomas was not collected in the case report form. Never-
theless, because adenomas larger than 1 cm constitute the
vast majority of the advanced adenomas, the result relative to
this group could be generalized with a good approximation
for the advanced adenomas. The colorectal cancer group was
diagnosed with adenocarcinoma or, rarely, mucinous adeno-
carcinoma, ranging from stages I to IV (AJCC system, 7th
edition). Colorectal cancer cases with unknown stages were
collected but not included in the per-protocol analysis.
The remaining study groups included patients with small AP
(<1 cm), hyperplastic polyps, inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD), other inflammatory diseases (e.g., psoriasis, rheuma-
toid arthritis, hepatitis), other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
(e.g., gall stones, diverticulitis), infectious viral diseases (e.g.,
HIV, Herpes Simplex), and malignancies other than colorectal
cancer.
Enrolled subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria,
including group-specific criteria, were designated as per-proto-
col subjects and used for per-protocol analysis. The study also
enrolled subjects not meeting all the protocol criteria, but
deemed to be valuable for the algorithm evaluation. For
instance, some of them presented with comorbidities involving
more than one medical condition/disease that defined the
study group (e.g., LAP and inflammatory disease, colorectal
cancer, and other GI disorder). These subjects were classified as
"non per-protocol" and intended to be analyzed separately to
test the algorithm response on a larger spectrum of medical
conditions and comorbidities.
Clinical procedures
A colonoscopy was performed for all study patients, except for
those with malignancies other than colorectal cancer, due to
ethical reasons. Colonoscopy to the cecum was required in all
cases except for colorectal cancer patients with a stenosis caused by
a tumor mass. Resected LAP or colorectal cancer tissues were sent
to a central pathology board composed of three independent
pathologists blinded to all subject information, group allocation,
Translational Relevance
Early detection of colorectal cancer dramatically improves
outcome of the disease. However, physicians face a chal-
lenge in convincing average-risk individuals to be screened
for colorectal cancer due to the unpleasant nature of existing
methods. Here, we report a novel blood test that effectively
differentiates patients with colorectal cancer and large ade-
nomatous polyps from individuals with negative colonos-
copy. The test is based on a 29-gene panel expressed in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alone or in combina-
tion with the established plasma tumor markers CEA and
CYFRA21-1. The test's performance is consistent with its use
as a colorectal cancer detection tool for average-risk indivi-
duals reluctant to undergo upfront colonoscopy. This study
is being followed by a prospective study to monitor and
further evaluate performance of the test in daily clinical
practice. Finally, this test might become a useful option to
increase compliance of average-risk individuals to colorectal
cancer screening.

 and assessments made by other pathologists (Supplementary
Materials and Methods).
For each participant, 16 mL of peripheral blood was collected
into 4 � 4 mL Vacutainer CPT tubes (Becton Dickinson), before
or immediately after colonoscopy. Most of the samples from
subjects diagnosed with colorectal cancer requiring a surgery
were collected up to 12 weeks after colonoscopy. In all cases,
blood was collected prior to polyp resection and prior to any
measures in preparation for surgery or any cancer-specific
treatment.
Laboratory procedures
Sample preparation and analysis were performed in a blinded
manner by laboratory personnel. PBMC separation was per-
formed locally within 6 hours according to Vacutainer CPT tube
manufacturer's instructions. PBMC pellets were resuspended and
stored at –80�C. Plasma from each sample was collected and
stored at –80�C.
Automated purification of total RNA from PBMC pellets was
performed at a central laboratory. RNA integrity was analyzed
and, on average, RNA samples showed an RNA integrity

 number (RIN) of 8.6 � 0.7. RNA samples with RIN < 5 were
considered of poor quality and discarded. RNA samples were
aliquoted and stored at –80�C.
For each sample, 200 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR anal-
ysis was performed on the Lightcycler 480 instruments using a 29-
gene panel previously reported (20). Briefly, PCR reactions were
carried out on a 384-well plate, preloaded with RealTime ready
Custom RT-qPCR assays using RealTime Ready DNA Probes
Master Mix. Gene expression values (Cp) were normalized by
the DCT method using the mean of the three housekeeping genes
RPLP0, NACA, and TPT1.
Plasma concentration of CEA, CYFRA21-1, CA125, and CA19-9
tumor biomarkers was measured for each patient on the Architect
immunoassay analyzer platform according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Details on the equipment used during the laboratory proce-
dures and relative manufacturers can be found in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Statistical design and modeling
The study aimed at enrolling 1,600 participants in order to
have 1,400 evaluable subjects' samples. Of those, 900 were
expected to be equally distributed between the three main
study groups (control, LAP, and colorectal cancer) for the
development and clinical validation of the test. The remaining
subjects, presenting with other predefined diseases, were allo-
cated to secondary groups for testing the algorithm specificity.
In order to reach a significance level a ¼ 0.05 and a power 1 –
b ¼ 0.80, the study required at least 200 controls, 190
colorectal cancer cases, and 240 LAP cases. Out of those,
120 controls, 70 colorectal cancer cases, and 95 LAP cases
had to be collected at the Swiss sites. Samples from the three
main groups were stratified by gender, age, site, colorectal
cancer stage, and LAP size and randomly distributed into
training, validation, and Test Set 1, in the proportion of
40%, 20%, and 40%, respectively (Fig. 2). Training and
validation sets were used in the discovery phase to define the
predictive algorithms, including 45 samples previously used
for the identification of the 29-gene panel (20). In the testing
phase, the algorithms were validated on Test Set 1, Test Set 2,
collected in the extension study, and Test Set 3, which includ-
ed "non per-protocol" control, LAP, and colorectal cancer
subjects. Samples from subjects with other colorectal lesions
or diseases were used to test the positive rate of the predictive
algorithms.
Classifiers and multiple classifier systems were generated by
penalized logistic regression (21–23) and fuzzy logic (24, 25)
modeling techniques. First, an algorithm based on the 29-gene
signature was defined following a multiple classifier combination
strategy. We refer to it as a multigene multiclassifier (MGMC)
algorithm. The MGMC algorithm was then combined with CEA
and CYFRA21-1 proteins, using a decision tree classification
approach (MGMC-P algorithm). Both algorithms release a binary
result, which suggests the presence or absence of advanced colo-
rectal neoplasia. The methodology used to develop the predictive
algorithms of Colox is detailed in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Specificity was estimated as 1�positivity among subjects
belonging to the control group. For test characteristics, 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were computed with the use of an exact
binomial test.
The R statistics environment was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Study population
Out of 1,665 enrolled subjects, 1,405 were considered fully
evaluable (84.4%). Of those, 782 were recruited in Switzerland
and 623 in South Korea. This report focuses on the Swiss dataset
only. Korean data will be presented separately.
In the Swiss collective, the per-protocol population was con-
stituted of 594 participants (Fig. 1), including 149 control sub-
jects, 103 LAP, and 97 colorectal cancer patients from stages I to IV,
as well as 245 subjects diagnosed with other types of colorectal
lesions (e.g., small adenomas, hyperplastic polyps), solid cancers,
or other diseases such as IBD or diverticulitis, for testing the
algorithm specificity. In addition, 188 cases classified as "non
per-protocol" were enrolled for testing the algorithm behavior on
a larger spectrum of medical conditions and comorbidities.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects are
reported in Table 1. Subjects in the control, LAP, and colorectal
cancer groups had a mean age of 60.6, 67.3, and 69.4, respectively.
The control group enrolled 54% women and 46% men, whereas
the LAP and colorectal cancer group enrolled 64% and 62% of
men, respectively.
29-gene expression analysis
All blood samples were profiled with a 29-gene panel (Sup-
plementary Table S1) previously reported (20) and discovered
through a combined univariate and multivariate approach. No
differences in normalized gene expression were observed across
collecting centers (data not shown) or across different age
categories within the control or the LAP group (Supplementary
Table S2). A few genes were found to be differentially expressed
between individuals of different age classes in the colorectal
cancer group, as well as between men and women within all

 three groups. These differences in individual genes had no
impact on the output of the 29-gene algorithms as shown by
the results described further below. The most significant genes
for colorectal cancer discrimination (P < 0.0008) were S100A8,
IL1B, CCR1, and PTGS2, with 1.7- to 2.1-fold increase in gene
expression (linear scale, Supplementary Table S1). Some of
these genes (S100A8/Calprotectin and PTGS2/COX2) are well-
known players in colorectal cancer (13, 26).
Clinical performance of the MGMC algorithm
The MGMC algorithm was applied to Test Set 1 showing a
specificity of 89.6% and a sensitivity of 75.9% for colorectal
cancer detection (Table 2). These performance characteristics
were confirmed when the algorithm was tested on a second
independent sample set (Test Set 2), showing the stability of
the algorithm (Table 2). When the two test sets were combined,
the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 75.0% for colorectal
cancer and of 54.8% for LAP detection with specificity of
89.2%. The test performed well on early stage colorectal cancer
with a sensitivity of 60.9% for colorectal cancer stages I–II,
which increased to 75.6% when colorectal cancer stage III was
included. No differences were observed in LAP detection in
patients with only one versus more than one LAP (data not
shown). Small AP (<1 cm) and hyperplastic polyps were also
detected by the test but with lower sensitivity (29.9% and
29.5%, respectively; Table 3).
The MGMC algorithm was also tested on subjects with other
diseases (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Non-GI inflam-
matory and viral diseases showed a low rate of positivity, com-
parable with the controls, whereas IBD and other GI diseases had a
higher positivity rate. The other cancers showed a very heteroge-
neous behavior ranging from a positive rate of 41.7% for pan-
creatic cancer to 80.0% for other GI cancers.
The algorithm was further tested on the Test Set 3, and the
results are presented in Supplementary Table S4. They confirmed
the findings of the per-protocol analyses. When these samples
were added to the per-protocol samples, MGMC sensitivity for
LAP and colorectal cancer was 55.4% and 79.5%, respectively,
with a specificity of 90.0% (Table 2).
Combination of the MGMC algorithm with
protein tumor markers
Among the four tumor markers analyzed, CEA and CYFRA21-2
showed the most significant P values (less than 0.001) for dis-
crimination between the colorectal cancer and control groups,
and the highest area under the curve for colorectal cancer and
control classification (data not shown). In the training set, these
tumor markers displayed a specificity of 86.0% and 94.0% and
sensitivity for colorectal cancer detection of 63.3% and 43.3%,
respectively. These results were confirmed in the validation set
with a specificity of 88.0% and 96.0% and sensitivity for colorectal
cancer of 60.0% and 26.7%, respectively. CEA and CYFRA21-1
sensitivity was directly correlated to colorectal cancer stage (data
not shown).
In order to explore whether tumor-specific markers could
complement and strengthen the MGMC algorithm, we added the
variables CEA and CYFRA21-1. The resulting overall specificity
(Test Sets 1þ2) was 91.9%, higher than the MGMC algorithm
alone (Table 4), although this difference was not statistically
significant (P >0.05). Sensitivity for colorectal cancer (75.0%)
and LAP (52.4%) was similar to the one reported by MGMC
(Table 4). When the Test Set 3 (Supplementary Table S4) was also
taken into consideration, the test reached a sensitivity of 52.3%
and 78.1%, respectively, with a specificity of 92.2% (Table 4).

 When colorectal cancer cases were stratified according to the time
of recruitment and blood draw, i.e., before surgery or at colonos-
copy, a slightly higher detection rate was observed in the cases
collected before surgery (79% vs 74%). However, this difference
was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
Due to the observed differences in age and sex distribution
between the control and the colorectal cancer group and
differences in the expression levels of some individual biomar-
kers, statistical testing was carried out to evaluate a possible
confounding effect of age or sex on colorectal cancer discrim-
ination by the algorithm based on the 29-gene panel. None of
the considered factors showed an association with the test
result (P value > 0.05; Supplementary Table S5). Moreover,
age and sex were tested as covariates in multivariate logistic
regression analysis. None of these two variables played a
statistically significant role in differentiating the control from
colorectal cancer group.
Discussion
Early detection of colorectal cancer dramatically improves
the clinical outcome of the disease, and regular screening has
proven to reduce mortality (2). The "gold standard" for AP and
colorectal cancer detection is colonoscopy. It has the highest
sensitivity for AP or colorectal cancer among all screening tests
and has the advantage to allow direct visualization of the entire
colon and removal of precancerous lesions. However, due to
the unpleasant bowel preparation required by the method as
well as its invasive nature, compliance to screening colono-
scopy
remains
unsatisfactorily
low.
Other
recommended
options are stool-based tests, such as the guaiac or immuno-
chemical FOBTs or the recently FDA-approved stool DNA test
(Cologuard; refs. 27–31). Stool tests require stool manipula-
tion at home, which is unappealing and inconvenient to some,
thus contributing to the low screening compliance despite their
promising performances.
An accurate blood test would be an attractive alternative for
asymptomatic, average-risk individuals reluctant to undergo
screening by a stool test or colonoscopy. This is supported by a
Dutch study, based on a population survey and mathematical
simulations which concluded that the target population preferred
to be screened using a blood- rather than a stool-based test (26%
vs. 17%; ref. 32). Another study reported that of 172 age-eligible
individuals who were indicated for colorectal cancer screening by
colonoscopy, 63% refused the procedure, whereas 97% of those
who refused colonoscopy agreed to be screened by a less invasive
test such as a blood test (83%) or a stool test (17%; ref. 10). It is
therefore reasonable to expect that a blood test can help convinc-
ing average-risk individuals to be tested for colorectal cancer, and
in the long term to contribute to reduction of colorectal cancer–
related mortality.
A blood test based on detecting aberrantly methylated DNA
in the Septin9 gene (Epi proColon) has recently been reviewed
by the FDA, but approval is still pending. In a large prospective
screening study, the test showed sensitivity for colorectal cancer
of 68% at specificity of 79%. The test was not able to detect
advanced adenomas, showing sensitivity equivalent to the
false-positive detection rate in the control group (22% vs.
21%; ref. 33).
Here, we report a validation study for a newly developed blood
test, which can identify 78% of colorectal cancer and 52% of large
adenomas. The latter result is of particular interest as large
adenomas are one the most clinically relevant precursor lesions
of colorectal cancer. Two different predictive algorithms were
developed: one based on a 29-gene panel expressed in PBMC
(MGMC algorithm) and one combining the MGMC algorithm
with the plasma tumor markers CEA and CYFRA21-1 (MGMC-P
algorithm). Although both algorithms had a comparable sensi-
tivity for colorectal cancer, MGMC-P demonstrated a slightly
higher specificity (92.2% vs. 90.0%). The clinical advantage of
higher specificity is that the number of false-positive individuals
sent to colonoscopy would be lower, thus avoiding unnecessary
invasive procedures.
The test was also evaluated in patients presenting other
colorectal lesions and a various spectrum of different diseases.
The test detected around 30% of AP smaller than 1 cm. It
would be of interest to evaluate how this detection rate
correlates
with
the
histology,
i.e.,
nonadvanced
versus
advanced AP, the latter representing approximately 13% of
the small AP (34).
The test detected also 28% to 30% of subjects with hyperplastic
polyps which have traditionally not been considered as a relevant
risk factor for colorectal cancer, unless present as hyperplastic
polyposis syndrome (35). Whether the detection of these
lesions is an added value for the test may be debatable. Under
the scenario that considers the detection of hyperplastic polyps
and small adenomas a false positive event, the test's specificity
would be estimated at 83%, based on the study data and pub-
lished prevalence data (36, 37). The full biologic and clinical
relevance of isolated hyperplastic polyps to colorectal cancer

 development, however, has not been thoroughly investigated
(38). Emerging evidence indicates that hyperplastic polyps
share similar morphologic and molecular features with sessile
serrated adenomas, which are now recognized as precancerous
lesions that can rapidly progress into invasive carcinoma (39).
KRAS and BRAF mutations and aberrant CpG-island methy-
lation are observed in a significant fraction of hyperplastic
polyps (approximately 30%–60%) consistent with the notion
that hyperplastic polyps are a subset of serrated adenoma
(40–42). On the basis of these considerations, and in the
context of a more personalized medicine, the detection of
hyperplastic polyps with carcinogenic potential would be a
desirable feature for such a test, although it may come with the
burden of detecting also benign hyperplastic polyps. The clin-
ical significance of a positive test in individuals with hyper-
plastic polyps will be explored in future studies.
The positive rate of the test in patients with IBD and other GI
benign diseases was close to 30%. Because these patients are
normally under close surveillance and/or are presenting symp-
toms, they are considered ineligible for testing by this kind of test.
In clinical practice, this test will not be applied to individuals
diagnosed with other cancers. We nevertheless evaluated a limited
number of patients with malignancies other than colorectal
cancer and found different degrees of positivity. These exploratory
observations did not yield relevant conclusions because the study
was not designed to evaluate the test for the early detection of
cancers other than colorectal cancer, and most patients were not
investigated by colonoscopy.
In summary, a new blood test has been developed and
clinically validated for detection of LAP and colorectal cancer
based on a 29-gene expression panel and the CEA and
CYFRA21-1 plasma biomarkers. The test's performance is
consistent with its use as a colorectal cancer detection tool
for average-risk individuals reluctant to undergo upfront colo-
noscopy. This convenient and routine blood test can help
identify individuals who will benefit the most from a colo-
noscopy. A prospective study is currently on-going to monitor
and further evaluate the performance of the test in daily
clinical practice.
