Summary
Background Limited data are available for the efficacy of triple therapy with two long-acting bronchodilators and an 
inhaled corticosteroid in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We compared treatment with extrafine 
beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium bromide (BDP/FF/GB; fixed triple) with 
tiotropium, and BDP/FF plus tiotropium (open triple).
Methods For this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial, eligible patients had COPD, post-
bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of less than 50%, at least one moderate-to-severe COPD 
exacerbation in the previous 12 months, and a COPD Assessment Test total score of at least 10. After a 2-week run-in 
period receiving one inhalation per day via single-dose dry-powder inhaler of open-label 18 µg tiotropium, patients 
were randomised (2:2:1) using a interactive response technology system to 52 weeks treatment with tiotropium, fixed 
triple, or open triple. Randomisation was stratified by country and severity of airflow limitation. The primary endpoint 
was moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation rate. The key secondary endpoint was change from baseline in pre-dose 
FEV1 at week 52. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01911364.
Findings Between Jan 21, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 2691 patients received fixed triple (n=1078), tiotropium (n=1075), 
or open triple (n=538). Moderate-to-severe exacerbation rates were 0·46 (95% CI 0·41–0·51) for fixed triple, 
0·57 (0·52–0·63) for tiotropium, and 0·45 (0·39–0·52) for open triple; fixed triple was superior to tiotropium (rate 
ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·69–0·92]; p=0·0025). For week 52 pre-dose FEV1, fixed triple was superior to tiotropium (mean 
difference 0·061 L [0·037 to 0·086]; p<0·0001) and non-inferior to open triple (–0·003L [–0·033 to 0·027]; p=0·85). 
Adverse events were reported by 594 (55%) patients with fixed triple, 622 (58%) with tiotropium, and 309 (58%) with 
open triple.
Interpretation In our TRINITY study, treatment with extrafine fixed triple therapy had clinical benefits compared with 
tiotropium in patients with symptomatic COPD, FEV1 of less than 50%, and a history of exacerbations.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 
progressive disease, characterised by the presence of 
persistent respiratory symptoms, such as breathlessness, 
cough, and phlegm, and exacerbations.1 Much of the 
burden of COPD is due to exacerbations, which are 
associated with increased disease progression, reduced 
quality of life, and increased costs (especially from 
hospitalisation).2–5 In patients at risk of exacerbations, 
most current guidelines recommend starting with either 
a long-acting muscarinic antagonist or a combination of 
an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β₂-agonist.1,6 
Triple therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid, a long-
acting β₂-agonist, and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
is recommended in patients with exacerbations despite 
initial treatment,1,6 and is frequently used for the 
management of COPD. However, few studies have 
addressed the added value of triple therapy for preventing 
exacerbations. Although two 12-week studies7,8 have 
suggested that triple therapy can provide a greater 
reduction in exacerbations compared with a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist, longer trials are needed to assess 
moderate and severe exacerbations, not least because of 
their marked seasonality.9 One long term study10 
compared triple therapy with a long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist but showed no reduction in exacerbation rate 
by 12 months. However, this study did not evaluate the 
clinical efficacy of a triple therapy delivered in a single 
inhaler.
Currently, patients with COPD receiving triple therapy 
must use at least two inhalers, typically a combined 
inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β₂-agonist in one 
inhaler and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in 
another. Often these inhalers are of different types and 
designs, which might in turn negatively impact correct 
inhaler use and treatment adherence. A single inhaler

combining extrafine formulations of the inhaled 
corticosteroid beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), the 
long-acting β₂-agonist formoterol fumarate (FF) and the 
long-acting 
muscarinic 
antagonist 
glycopyrronium 
bromide (GB) has been developed to simplify this 
regimen, with extrafine formulations able to reach and 
treat not only the large airways but also the small 
airways.11 In the TRINITY study, we aimed to evaluate the 
use of extrafine BDP/FF/GB (fixed triple) over a 
monotherapy 
long-acting 
muscarinic 
antagonist, 
tiotropium, with a free combination of BDP/FF in one 
inhaler and tiotropium in a second inhaler (open triple) 
as a control.
Methods
Study design
Our study was a randomised, parallel group, double-
blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial, at 224 sites 
across 15 countries (six in Argentina, five in Belarus, ten 
in Bulgaria, five in Croatia, 17 in Germany, 14 in Hungary,
three in Italy, five in Mexico, 33 in Poland, 16 in Romania,
53 in Russia, six in Slovakia, five in Turkey, three in the 
UK, and 43 in Ukraine. The sites were a mixture of 
primary care (17), secondary care (121), tertiary care (48), 
and specialist investigation units (38).
Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at 
a screening visit (visit 1) entered a 2-week open-label run-
in period, during which they received tiotropium 18 µg, 
one inhalation per day (in the morning) via single-dose 
dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI; HandiHaler [Boehringer 
Ingelheim GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany]). At 
the end of the 2-week run-in (visit 2), patients were 
randomised with a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment 
groups.
The study was approved by the ethics committee or 
institutional review board at each site, and was performed 
in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, and the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH/CPMP/135/95). No protocol 
amendments were made.
Patients
Eligible patients were 40 years of age or older; current or 
ex-smokers; had a diagnosis of COPD, with post-
bronchodilator (salbutamol 400 µg) forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1) of less than 50% and a ratio of FEV1 
to forced vital capacity of less than 0·7; had at least 
one moderate or severe COPD exacerbation in the 
previous 12 months; and used an inhaled corticosteroid 
plus long-acting β₂-agonist (as an open or fixed 
combination), or inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist, or inhaled long-acting β₂-agonist 
plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (as an open or 
fixed combination), or long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
monotherapy for at least 2 months before screening—
patients receiving triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroid, 
long-acting β₂-agonist and long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist were not eligible. Additionally, eligible 
patients were symptomatic, with a COPD Assessment 
Test total score of at least 10. All patients provided 
written informed consent before any study-related 
procedure.
We excluded patients from the study if they had a 
diagnosis of asthma, or history of allergic rhinitis or 
atopy; COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks before 
screening or during the run-in period; clinically 
significant cardiovascular conditions or laboratory 
abnormalities (including persistent, long-standing, or 
permanent atrial fibrillation); or unstable concurrent 
disease that could have influenced efficacy or safety (as 
judged by the investigator). Full inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are in the appendix.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published before 
Sept 13, 2016, with no start date or language restrictions, using 
the search terms “Drug Therapy, Combination” [MeSH Terms] 
OR “triple” AND “COPD” AND “trial”, with no limits applied. Of 
the 524 results, 18 studies presented data from clinical trials 
evaluating the efficacy of triple therapy with an inhaled 
corticosteroid plus a long-acting β₂-agonist plus a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist, with one retrospective cohort analysis. 
Of these, six studies compared triple therapy with a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist therapy; and five compared triple 
therapy with both a long-acting muscarinic antagonist and an 
inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting β₂-agonist. Although 
most studies were of short duration (mostly 12–24 weeks), a 
number showed a reduction in the rate of exacerbations for 
triple therapy versus long-acting muscarinic antagonist, 
together with a consistent improvement in bronchodilation. 
However, results were more variable for the other endpoints, 
including health-related quality of life, and none of these 
studies used a single inhaler triple combination.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first long-term study specifically 
designed to evaluate the effect of a single inhaler triple therapy 
versus long-acting muscarinic antagonist therapy on the rate of 
exacerbations in a population at high exacerbation risk.
Implications of all the available evidence
By comparison with long-acting muscarinic antagonist alone, 
triple therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid, a long-acting 
β₂-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in a single 
inhaler reduces the rate of COPD exacerbations in this high-risk 
population, together with improvements in lung function, and 
in a range of other clinically relevant measures.

Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomised to treatment by investigators 
contacting an interactive response technology (IRT) 
system, which used a randomisation list generated by the 
IRT provider. Randomisation was in the ratio 2:2:1 to the 
fixed triple group, tiotropium group, or open triple 
group. Randomisation was stratified by country and 
severity of airflow limitation (post-bronchodilator FEV1 
<30% predicted, or 30–50% predicted, with a minimum 
of 20% of recruited patients to be <30% predicted). 
Patients, investigators, site staff, and funder personnel 
were masked to treatment assignment for the duration of 
the study. To achieve this masking, a double-dummy 
approach was used, with all patients using a pMDI 
twice daily (containing BDP/FF/GB, BDP/FF, or placebo) 
and an SDDPI once daily (containing tiotropium or 
placebo).
Procedures
At visit 2, baseline (pre-dose) data were collected for 
spirometry and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ; a measure of health-related quality of life). After 
visit 2, patients were randomised with a 2:2:1 ratio to one 
of three treatment groups: first, to continue to receive 
18 µg tiotropium, one inhalation once daily via SDDPI 
(tiotropium group); second, to receive extrafine 100 µg 
BDP/6 µg FF/12·5 µg GB, two actuations twice daily via 
pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI; fixed triple 
group), or, third, extrafine 100 µg BDP/6 µg FF, 
two actuations twice daily via pMDI plus tiotropium 18 µg, 
one inhalation per day via SDDPI (open triple group). 
During the subsequent 52-week treatment period, patients 
attended visits at weeks 4, 12, 26, 40, and 52. As rescue 
medication, patients were permitted to use salbutamol as 
needed (100 µg per actuation, via pMDI), but not within 
6 h before any spirometry assessment. Other than study 
treatments and rescue medication, for the duration of the 
study the following classes of medication were not 
permitted from the indicated time before the screening 
visit: 
short-acting 
β₂-agonists 
(6 
h), 
short-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (12 h), long-acting β₂-agonists 
(12 h; 72 h for ultra-long-acting β₂-agonists), long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (72 h), inhaled corticosteroids 
(12 h), and xanthine derivatives (7 days). FEV1 was 
determined from forced spirometry manoeuvres, with 
inspiratory capacity determined from slow spirometry 
(inspiratory capacity is a measure of hyperinflation). At 
each subsequent visit, pre-dose (morning) spirometry was 
conducted (with centralised spirometry used to improve 
the quality), and data were collected from the SGRQ. For 
the duration of the study, patients recorded daily 
symptoms using the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary 
disease Tool Patient-Reported Outcome (EXACT-PRO) 
questionnaire, together with treatment compliance and 
rescue medication use in an electronic diary; these data 
were reviewed by the investigator regularly, and at least at 
each visit.
Outcomes
Our primary objective was to assess efficacy of the fixed 
triple dose versus tiotropium in terms of moderate to 
severe COPD exacerbation rate for 52 weeks of treatment. 
The two key secondary objectives were both based on 
change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 at week 52—to 
assess efficacy of fixed triple versus tiotropium with a 
superiority analysis, and to assess fixed triple therapy 
versus open triple therapy with a non-inferiority analysis. 
The secondary efficacy variables were time to first 
moderate to severe COPD exacerbation, and to first 
severe COPD exacerbation; rate of severe and of moderate 
COPD exacerbations throughout 52 weeks of treatment; 
pre-dose FEV1 at all other clinic visits and the mean over 
the treatment period; FEV1 response (change from 
baseline in pre-dose FEV1 ≥100 mL) at weeks 26 and 52; 
pre-dose inspiratory capacity at all clinic visits; SGRQ 
response (decrease from baseline in total score ≥4, which 
is the minimal clinically important difference12) at 
weeks 26 and 52; SGRQ total score at all clinic visits; and 
percentage of days without rescue medication use and 
average number of puffs per day. For all variables, the 
following comparisons were prespecified: fixed triple 
versus tiotropium; fixed triple versus open triple; open 
triple versus tiotropium.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a worsening of 
the patient’s respiratory symptoms that in the view of the 
patient’s 
health-care 
provider 
required 
treatment 
with systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, or hospital 
admission, or a combination.13 Events were classified as 
moderate or severe according to European Medicines 
Agency/Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use guidelines,13 with severe exacerbations being those 
requiring hospital admission or resulting in death. Data 
from the EXACT-PRO questionnaire were used to 
optimise the recognition of potential exacerbations by 
programming the electronic diary to alert physicians and 
to advise patients to contact their investigator in the event 
of worsening symptoms.
Treatment-emergent adverse events were captured 
throughout the study. All events that were judged by the 
investigator as having reasonable causal relation to a 
medical product were considered to be treatment-related 
adverse events. Blood pressure was recorded pre-dose 
and at 10 min post-dose at each visit, with 
electrocardiograph (ECG) data captured at weeks 26 
and 52. Major adverse cardiovascular events were 
adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee 
of four cardiologists.
Statistical analysis
We estimated that 2580 randomly assigned patients 
(1032 patients in each of the fixed triple and tiotropium 
groups, and 516 in the open triple group) would be 
required, considering non-assessable rates of about 13% 
at week 12, 16·5% at week 26, and 20% at week 52. With 
the use of a two-sided significance level of 0·05, this

sample size provided an overall study power of 80%, and 
in particular, 93·3% power to detect a rate ratio of 0·8 for 
moderate to severe COPD exacerbations between the 
fixed triple and tiotropium groups, using a negative 
binomial model and assuming a rate of 0·9 exacerbations 
per patient per year in the tiotropium group and an 
overdispersion parameter of the negative binomial 
distribution of 0·56; 99·7% power to detect a mean 
difference of 60 mL between fixed triple and tiotropium 
in pre-dose FEV1 at week 52, assuming an SD of 260 mL; 
assuming 9% of completed patients with major protocol 
deviations, 86·0% power to show the non-inferiority of 
fixed triple relative to open triple in pre-dose FEV1 at 
week 52 in the per protocol population, with a non-
inferiority margin of –50 mL and assuming no difference 
between treatments and an SD of 260 mL (one-sided 
significance level of 0·025).
We analysed the number of moderate-to-severe COPD 
exacerbations (primary endpoint) using a negative 
binomial model including treatment, country, number of 
COPD exacerbations in the previous year, severity of 
airflow limitation, and smoking status at screening as 
fixed effects, and log-time on study as an offset. We 
considered two COPD exacerbations as a single episode 
in the statistical analysis if the second exacerbation 
started less than 10 days after the end of the systemic 
corticosteroids or antibiotics intake for the previous 
exacerbation. We analysed the change from baseline in 
pre-dose FEV1 (key secondary endpoint) using a linear 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), with data 
up to discontinuation included in the analysis for 
withdrawn patients. This model included treatment, 
visit, treatment by visit interaction, country, number of 
COPD exacerbations in the previous year, severity of 
airflow limitation, and smoking status at screening as 
fixed effects, and baseline value and baseline by visit 
interaction as covariates.
To deal with multiplicity, we did the primary and 
secondary comparisons in the following prespecified 
hierarchical order: (1) superiority of fixed triple compared 
with tiotropium in terms of moderate-to-severe COPD 
exacerbation rate; (2) superiority of fixed triple compared 
with tiotropium in terms of pre-dose FEV1; (3) non-
inferiority of fixed triple relative to open triple in terms of 
pre-dose FEV1. At each step of the procedure, no 
confirmatory claims were to be made unless the objectives 
were met in all the preceding steps. We did not apply 
multiplicity adjustments in the analysis of secondary

endpoints, and we descriptively interpreted p-values for 
these variables. We prespecified subgroup analyses of the 
primary and key secondary endpoints, with patients 
grouped according to severity of airflow limitation, 
smoking status, sex, reversibility to salbutamol, COPD 
phenotype (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or mixed), 
blood eosinophil concentration at screening, and age, 
with the primary endpoint also analysed according to 
presence of cardiovascular comorbidities and number of 
exacerbations in the previous 12 months. We did 
sensitivity analyses on the primary and key secondary 
endpoints to assess the potential impact of missing data 
(appendix).
We analysed severe and moderate exacerbation rates 
using the same model as the primary endpoint. We 
analysed times to first exacerbation using a Cox 
proportional hazards model, and we evaluated responder 
analyses for FEV1 and SGRQ using a logistic model. In 
these models, we included the same fixed effects as in 
the analysis of the primary endpoint, with the baseline 
value also considered in the responder analyses. We 
analysed the changes from baseline in pre-dose 
inspiratory capacity, SGRQ total score and rescue 
medication use endpoints using a similar MMRM model 
as for the key secondary endpoint.
We analysed primary, key secondary, and other secondary 
endpoints in the intention-to-treat population—classified 
as all randomly assigned patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline

efficacy assessment. We tested non-inferiority of the key 
secondary endpoint in the per-protocol population—
classified as all patients in the intention-to-treat population 
with no major protocol deviations. Safety outcomes were 
analysed in the safety population—classified as all 
randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose 
of study drug. An independent Data Safety Monitoring 
Board, composed of three independent clinicians and 
one independent biostatistician, provided a quarterly 
independent scrutiny of the study. We did all analyses 
presented in this manuscript with SAS software, version 9.2. 
The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01911364.
Role of the funding source
The funder was responsible for the design and analysis 
of the study, oversaw its conduct and was responsible for 
preparing the study report. All authors had full access to 
all of the data, with the lead author (JV) responsible for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
The study ran between Jan 21, 2014, and March 18, 2016. 
We recruited 3433 patients of whom 2691 were randomly 
assigned to one of the treatment groups, with 986 (91%) 
of 1078 completing the study in the fixed triple group, 
914 (85%) of 1075 in the tiotropium group, and 496 (92%) 
of 538 in the open triple group (figure 1). Patients in the 
tiotropium group were more likely to prematurely 
withdraw from the study than either of the other two 
groups (p<0·0001). Compliance to treatment was high, 
with a median of 94·6% (IQR 87·2–98·4) of doses taken in 
the fixed triple group, 94·3% (85·7–98·3) in the tiotropium 
group and 94·9% (88·7–98·5) in the open triple group. 
Median exposure in all three groups was 365 days, ranging 
from 3–402 days for fixed triple, 1–403 days for tiotropium, 
and 4–399 days for open triple. More than 83% of patients 
had at least one concomitant disease (table 1). Cardiac 
disorders were reported in 41% of the patients in the fixed 
triple group, 43% of the patients in the tiotropium group, 
and 40% of the patients in the open triple group.
The rates of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations 
were 0·46 per patient per year for fixed triple, 0·57 for 
tiotropium, and 0·45 for open triple (figure 2). Extrafine 
fixed triple was superior to tiotropium, with an adjusted 
rate ratio (RR) of 0·80 (95% CI 0·69–0·92; p=0·0025; 
figure 2). The rates of moderate-to-severe exacerbations 
were similar with fixed triple and open triple (figure 2).
Prespecified subgroup analyses are shown in the 
appendix. Of note, compared with tiotropium monotherapy,

the effect of the two triple therapies on exacerbation rate 
was greater in the subgroups with higher eosinophil 
concentrations. In the subgroup with an eosinophil count 
of at least 2%, the triple therapies also reduced exacerbation 
rates versus tiotropium (RR 0·70 [95% CI 0·58–0·85] for 
fixed and 0·69 [0·55–0·87] for open triple); corresponding 
reductions in the <2% subgroup were smaller (0·93 
[0·75–1·17] for fixed triple and 0·91 [0·69–1·20] for open 
triple). In the subgroup with an eosinophil count of at least 
0·2 × 10⁹ cells per L, the reductions were similar for fixed 
(0·64 [0·51–0·81]) and open triple (0·62 [0·47–0·83]); in the 
less than 0·2 × 10⁹ cells per L subgroup, reductions were 
smaller (0·92 [0·77–1·10] for fixed triple and 0·91 
[0·72–1·14] for open triple). Additionally, compared with 
open triple, fixed triple significantly reduced the rate of 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations in the subgroup of 
patients with more than one exacerbation in the previous 
12 months (0·71 [0·51–1·00]).
The time to first moderate-to-severe exacerbation was 
significantly extended with fixed triple versus tiotropium 
(figure 2). Fixed triple and open triple showed similar 
effects for this variable (figure 2). Fixed triple significantly 
reduced the rate both of severe and moderate 
exacerbations, compared with tiotropium with similar 
rates to open triple (figure 2). The time to first severe 
exacerbation was prolonged with fixed triple compared 
with tiotropium (HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·52–0·95]; 
p=0·0208), and was similar for fixed triple and open 
triple (1·05 [0·70–1·56]; p=0·82).
The adjusted mean changes from baseline in pre-dose 
FEV1 at week 52 (the key secondary efficacy variable) were 
0·082 L (95% CI 0·065 to 0·100) for fixed triple, 0·021 L 
(0·003 to 0·039) for tiotropium and 0·085 L 
(0·061 to 0·110) for open triple. Both of the key secondary 
objectives were met, with fixed triple superior to 
tiotropium (adjusted mean difference 0·061 L [95% CI 
0·037 to 0·086]; p<0·0001) and non-inferior to open 
triple (–0·003 L [–0·033 to 0·027]; p=0·85) in pre-dose 
FEV1 at week 52. Non-inferiority between fixed triple and 
open triple was confirmed in the per-protocol population. 
The results of the subgroup analyses were broadly 
consistent with the overall results (appendix). For this 
endpoint, eosinophil levels did not consistently influence 
the results.
For predose FEV1 at all other visits and averaged over the 
treatment period, fixed triple was superior to tiotropium 
and similar to open triple (figure 3). Averaged over the 
treatment period, the adjusted mean changes from 
baseline in pre-dose FEV1 were 0·080 L (95% CI 
0·067–0·093) with fixed triple, 0·022 L (0·009–0·036) 
with tiotropium, and 0·091 L (0·073–0·110) with open 
triple. The FEV1 adjusted mean difference between fixed 
triple and tiotropium was statistically significant (0·058 L 
[0·039 to 0·077]; p<0·0001), whereas the values were 
similar for fixed triple and open triple (difference –0·011 L 
[–0·034 to 0·012]; p=0·34). In terms of FEV1 change from 
baseline, patients were more likely to respond (response 
defined as ≥100 mL increase) to fixed triple than to 
tiotropium at both weeks 26 and 52 (table 2), with a similar 
percentage of responders in the fixed triple and open 
triple groups. Fixed triple was also superior to tiotropium 
for change from baseline in predose inspiratory capacity 
and was similar to open triple at all visits except week 12—
at which time it was inferior (figure 3).
More patients on fixed triple than on tiotropium alone 
were responders in terms of SGRQ total score (decrease 
from baseline ≥4 units) at both weeks 26 and 52, with a

similar percentage of responders in the two triple therapy 
groups at the end of the study but not at week 26 (table 2). 
Fixed triple was associated with a greater improvement 
in mean SGRQ total score than tiotropium at all time 
points except week 26, and a similar mean change from 
baseline in SGRQ total score to open triple at most 
timepoints, with the exception of weeks 26 and 
52 (appendix). Compared with patients receiving fixed 
triple, those receiving tiotropium required more rescue 
medication, both when analysed in terms of puffs per 
day and the percentage of days with no use, with rescue 
medication use similar in the fixed triple and open triple 
groups (appendix).
A similar proportion of patients had adverse events in 
the three groups (table 3). Most events were mild or 
moderate in severity. Pneumonia was reported in a small 
number of patients, with similar incidence in the 
three treatment groups (table 3). One serious adverse 
event occurred in one patient in the tiotropium group; 
the patient experienced an episode of angina pectoris, 
considered moderate in severity, and although the patient 
fully recovered it resulted in withdrawal from the study. 
Fewer patients experienced adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of study drug in the two triple therapy 
groups than did in the tiotropium group. The most 
common 
adverse 
event 
leading

drug 
discontinuation was COPD exacerbation (eight [1%] 
patients in the fixed triple group, 14 [1%] in the tiotropium 
group, and 5 [1%] in the open triple group). Adverse 
events resulted in 57 deaths (table 3). None of the deaths 
was considered related to study treatment.
Mean changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and 
Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were small, 
with no clinically relevant differences between the three 
groups (treatment differences in change from screening 
to pre-dose and post-dose at weeks 26 and 52 are shown 
in the appendix (p 14–19), together with comparisons 
between pre-dose and post-dose values and largest 
changes in blood pressure). The percentage of abnormal

Discussion
The study met the primary and both key secondary 
endpoints. Extrafine fixed triple resulted in a 20% (95% CI 
8–31) reduction in the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD 
exacerbations compared with tiotropium, together with a 
0·061 L mean improvement in pre-dose FEV1. Furthermore, 
the non-inferiority of fixed triple relative to open triple was 
shown for pre-dose FEV1. Fixed triple reduced both 
moderate and severe exacerbation rates, hyperinflation (as 
measured by inspiratory capacity), and rescue medication 
use, with more SGRQ responders compared with 
tiotropium, and effects generally similar to open triple.
The 20% improvement in exacerbation rates with fixed 
triple over tiotropium (a first-line treatment in this 
population1) is consistent with the suggested minimum 
clinically important difference.12 This result is especially 
notable in view of the relatively low rate of moderate-to-
severe exacerbations in all three groups (0·45–0·57 
exacerbations per patient per year). We recruited a 
population that was both symptomatic and at high risk of 
exacerbations, with a history of about 1·3 exacerbations 
per patient in the year before entry. We would therefore 
anticipate that a high proportion of patients would 
experience an exacerbation during the study. However, 
lower than anticipated exacerbation rates have also been 
seen in other trials,14–18 perhaps because patients often 
receive improved care in interventional trials with 
regular, detailed clinic visits. Additionally, the treatment 
adherence in clinical trials is far higher than is usually 
seen in clinical practice.
Limited evidence is available for an effect of triple 
therapy on exacerbations and—to our knowledge this is 
the first long-term study to compare a fixed triple with a 
long-acting 
muscarinic 
antagonist. 
Studies 
have 
generally been of short duration, and have generally not 
specifically recruited COPD patients at risk of 
exacerbation events. In one of the few long-term studies, 
Aaron and colleagues10 evaluated exacerbation rates with 
long-acting 
muscarinic 
antagonist 
alone 
or 
in 
combination with either long-acting β₂-agonist or inhaled 
corticosteroids plus long-acting β₂-agonist for 52 weeks. 
The study had a small sample size and a high dropout 
rate, and low statistical power could explain the non-
significant difference between triple therapy and 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy. By 
contrast, 12-week studies7,8 have shown a 62% 
(95% CI 43–75) reduction in the rate of severe 
exacerbations with triple therapy compared with long-
acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy and a 
41% (16–58) reduction in the rate of moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations .
The results of our study add to those from the 12-month 
TRILOGY study,19 in which this fixed triple combination 
resulted in a 23% (95% CI 8–35) reduction in the rate of 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with BDP/FF. 
Additionally, we believe that the significant reduction of 
32% in the rate of severe exacerbations (those leading to 
hospitalisation or death) with the fixed triple versus 
tiotropium in TRINITY is particularly important. The 
clinical response to triple therapy (in terms of exacerbation 
reduction) is consistent and clinically relevant irrespective 
of whether the use of triple therapy follows an escalation of 
therapy from inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting 
β₂-agonist or from long-acting muscarinic antagonist. 
More specifically, the two studies together show that triple 
therapy reduces exacerbation rates and improves lung 
function compared with either inhaled corticosteroid and a 
long-acting β₂-agonist or long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
monotherapy.
An advance in the management of COPD is the 
availability of combination inhalers containing a long-
acting β₂-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. 
Such bronchodilator combination inhalers have a role in 
the management of COPD—especially because the 
FLAME study20 suggested that compared with an inhaled 
corticosteroid/long-acting β₂-agonist combination, a long-
acting 
muscarinic 
antagonist/long-acting 
β₂-agonist 
combination reduced the rate of COPD exacerbations and 
improved both lung function and health-related quality of 
life. Neither our study nor TRILOGY19 can directly answer 
the question of the value of adding an inhaled 
corticosteroid to a long-acting β₂-agonist plus long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist combination. Furthermore, the 
addition of inhaled corticosteroids to maintenance therapy 
with the combination of two long-acting bronchodilators 
is not the most common triple therapy.21
Previous post-hoc analyses22–24 have shown that 
eosinophil levels can predict response to inhaled 
corticosteroids in COPD, although the exact cut-points to 
be used are uncertain.25 Using a 2% cut-point we found 
improved efficacy in the high eosinophil group regarding 
the primary outcome, with a 30% (95% CI 15–42) 
reduction in the moderate-to-severe exacerbation rate for 
fixed triple versus tiotropium, and similar results for the 
0·2 × 
10⁹ cells per L cut-point. We also found non-
statistically significant reductions in moderate-to-severe 
exacerbation rates of 7–8% in the low eosinophil groups.
This triple therapy approach did not result in any 
unexpected safety findings, with no relevant differences 
between the three groups. Few patients experienced 
pneumonia, an event that has been associated with 
inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD.26 The incidence of 
pneumonia in this study was lower than that observed in 
the FLAME trial,20 where the incidence of pneumonia 
was 3·2% in the group that received only dual 
bronchodilator treatment and 4·8% in those who received 
an inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β₂-agonist.
The main limitations of our study are the lower than 
expected rate of exacerbations, together with the potential 
narrowing of the recruited population due to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria that we applied. The

recruitment criteria are typical of this type of efficacy 
study, but despite them, a population was recruited with 
a high prevalence of comorbidities, including more 
than 40% of patients with cardiac disorders.
In conclusion, in TRINITY treatment with extrafine 
fixed triple therapy had clinically beneficial effects 
compared with long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
monotherapy on different components of COPD, namely 
exacerbations, FEV1, hyperinflation, and health-related 
quality of life. This consistent improvement in different 
disease domains suggests that stepping up a patient 
from long-acting muscarinic antagonist to triple therapy 
will have a clinically meaningful impact.
