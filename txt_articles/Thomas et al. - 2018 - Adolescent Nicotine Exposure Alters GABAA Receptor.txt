In Brief
Thomas et al. show that nicotine
treatments during adolescence, but not
adulthood, cause a long-term increase in
alcohol self-administration in adult
rodents. Adolescent nicotine exposure
shifts GABAA receptor signaling within
the ventral tegmental area circuitry,
thereby altering subsequent responses to
alcohol.

SUMMARY
Adolescent smoking is associated with pathological
drinking later in life, but the biological basis for
this vulnerability is unknown. To examine how
adolescent nicotine exposure influences subsequent
ethanol intake, nicotine was administered during
adolescence or adulthood, and responses to alcohol
were measured 1 month later. We found that adoles-
cent, but not adult, nicotine exposure altered GABA
signaling within the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
and led to a long-lasting enhancement of alcohol
self-administration. We detected depolarizing shifts
in GABAA reversal potentials arising from impaired
chloride extrusion in VTA GABA neurons. Alterations
in GABA signaling were dependent on glucocorticoid
receptor activation and were associated with attenu-
ated dopaminergic neuron responses to alcohol in
the lateral VTA. Importantly, enhancing chloride
extrusion in adolescent nicotine-treated animals
restored VTA GABA signaling and alcohol self-
administration to control levels. Taken together,
this work suggests that adolescent nicotine expo-
sure increases the risk profile for increased alcohol
drinking in adulthood.
INTRODUCTION
Nearly 90% of smokers start smoking by the age of 18 (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2017), and
tobacco use is strongly predictive of pathological alcohol con-
sumption (Grant, 1998; Harrison and McKee, 2011). This
association is thought to originate in adolescence, with early
tobacco exposure acting as a gateway for subsequent alcohol
use and abuse (Cross et al., 2017; Torabi et al., 1993). Adoles-
cence is a neurodevelopmental window marked by major
reorganization of limbic brain regions important for reward
processing (Casey et al., 2008). Nicotine exposure may, there-
fore, alter brain development to promote pathological drug
use later in life. Evidence from rodent models shows that
exposure to nicotine during adolescence, but not post-adoles-
cence, is associated with enhanced drug reinforcement in
adulthood (Adriani et al., 2003; La
´ rraga et al., 2017). Although
long-term alterations in brain function have been reported
following adolescent nicotine exposure (Counotte et al.,
2009; Doura et al., 2010), the specific neuroadaptations that
give rise to excessive alcohol consumption in adulthood
remain unknown.
Our previous work suggested that nicotine-ethanol interac-
tions could arise via altered GABAA receptor (GABAAR) signaling
within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Doyon et al., 2013).
GABAARs are positively modulated by ethanol and are impli-
cated in ethanol reinforcement (Boyle et al., 1993; Rassnick
et al., 1993). The strength and polarity of GABAAR signaling are
predominantly dictated by cellular chloride (Cl�) gradients and
maintained by the K+, Cl� transporter, KCC2 (Doyon et al.,
2016). Impaired KCC2 function and intracellular Cl� accumula-
tion leads to depolarizing shifts in the Cl� reversal potential
(EGABA) and compromised GABAAR-mediated inhibition (Hewitt
et al., 2009; Ostroumov et al., 2016). Within VTA GABA neurons,
functional KCC2 downregulation and the consequent decreased
GABAAR-mediated inhibition are thought to promote alcohol
self-administration following glucocorticoid receptor activation
(Ostroumov et al., 2016).
Based on that previous work, we hypothesized that adoles-
cent nicotine exposure promoted ethanol consumption in
adulthood via persistent adaptations in Cl� homeostasis. We
found that rats treated with nicotine as adolescents, but not
those treated as adults, showed elevated ethanol self-adminis-
tration and excitatory shifts in GABAAR signaling a month later
that were dependent on glucocorticoid receptor activation.
Adolescent
nicotine exposure impaired
Cl� extrusion
via
KCC2 downregulation and altered mesolimbic responses to
ethanol. Enhancing Cl� extrusion
in adolescent nicotine-
treated rats returned GABAergic inhibitory signaling to normal
and returned alcohol consumption to control levels. These
results indicate that adolescent nicotine exposure produces
long-lasting
alterations
in
Cl�
homeostasis
and
GABAAR
signaling and contributes to elevated ethanol self-administra-
tion in adulthood.

 RESULTS
Adolescent Nicotine Increases Adult Ethanol
Self-Administration
Adolescent rats were administered daily injections of saline or
nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.] injections) on post-natal
day (p)28–p42, and ethanol self-administration was measured
approximately 1 month later (p70–p100; 1-hr session per day)
(Figure 1A). Operant responses to saccharin were first estab-
lished, followed by the introduction of 2%–4% ethanol into the
drinking solution (Ostroumov et al., 2016). Saccharin consump-
tion was measured 3 days immediately prior to ethanol exposure
and the average intake was not statistically different between
adolescent nicotine-treated animals (10 ± 1 mL) and adolescent
saline controls (8 ± 1 mL) (Figure S1B): p > 0.05 n = 8, 10 rats per
group. Upon adding ethanol to the drinking solution, adolescent
nicotine-treated animals showed significantly increased self-
administration compared to adolescent saline controls (Fig-
ure 1B): for group, F(1, 16) = 14.48, p < 0.01. Analysis of total fluid
consumption also revealed greater intake among adolescent
nicotine-treated rats compared to controls (Figure S1C): for
group, F(1, 16) = 14.69, p < 0.01. Mean ethanol intake across
the first 7 days was 1.03 ± 0.05 g/kg for the nicotine-pretreated
group and 0.75 ± 0.05 g/kg for the saline-pretreated group (Fig-
ure 1C): p < 0.01, n = 8, 10 rats per group.
Next, we examined self-administration of higher ethanol con-
centrations. The average intake of 8% ethanol was significantly
increased in the adolescent nicotine group compared to adoles-
cent saline controls (Figure 1D): for nicotine, 1.83 ± 0.11 g/kg; for
saline, 1.30 ± 0.16 g/kg; p < 0.05; n = 9, 5 rats per group. To
confirm the specificity of this effect to ethanol, saccharin was
removed, and the intake of 8% ethanol was measured. Elevated
drinking was observed in adolescent nicotine-treated animals
compared to saline-treated controls after the removal of
saccharin (Figure 1E): for nicotine, 0.88 ± 0.05 g/kg; for sa-
line, 0.60 ± 0.05 g/kg; p < 0.01, n = 11, 9 rats per group. The
effects of adolescent nicotine exposure persisted throughout
the duration of self-administration experiments (25 days),
revealing long-lasting alterations in the acquisition and mainte-
nance of ethanol self-administration in adult animals.
Adult Nicotine Exposure Does Not Increase Adult
Ethanol Self-Administration
To determine the effect of post-adolescent nicotine exposure on
subsequent ethanol consumption, young adult animals were
administered comparable nicotine or saline injections over a
2-week period (p60–p74). Self-administration was assessed in
these animals approximately 1 month later (Figure 2A). Adult
nicotine pretreatment failed to increase daily ethanol self-
administration compared to adult saline controls (Figure 2B):
for group, F(1, 9) = 0.01, p > 0.05. The average intake in the
adult nicotine group (0.76 ± 0.08 g/kg; Figure 2C, gray bar)
was not statistically different from that in adult saline controls
(0.68 ± 0.06 g/kg; Figure 2C, black bar) or adolescent saline
controls (0.71 ± 0.05 g/kg; dotted line of Figure 2C: p > 0.05,
n = 9, 14, 9 rats per group). These results suggest that
adolescent, but not adult, nicotine exposure produces long-last-
ing elevations in subsequent ethanol self-administration.
Adolescent Nicotine Alters GABA Transmission and
Chloride Homeostasis in the VTA
Enhanced ethanol self-administration has been previously
associated with depolarizing shifts in the GABAAR reversal
potential (EGABA) of VTA GABA neurons (Ostroumov et al.,
2016). To examine whether adolescent nicotine exposure altered
EGABA, midbrain slices were prepared from adult rats treated with
nicotine or saline during adolescence (Figure 3A). Next, grami-
cidin perforated patch-clamp recordings were performed in
VTA GABA neurons to preserve the intracellular anion concen-
trations (Figure 3B). We measured GABAA currents at different

 membrane potentials following electrical stimulation (Figure 3C).
VTA GABA neurons from adult rats receiving adolescent nicotine
showed a significantly more depolarized EGABA value compared
to saline-treated controls (Figures 3C and 3D): �66 ± 2 mV after
nicotine (indicated in red) versus �87 ± 4 mV in controls (indi-
cated in black), n = 6, 7 cells per group, p < 0.01. Adolescent
nicotine did not alter the membrane resting potential (measured
as zero holding current): �56 ± 2 mV after nicotine versus �61 ±
3 mV in controls, n = 6, 7 cells per group, p > 0.05. Analogous
experiments were conducted to determine whether adolescent
nicotine altered EGABA in VTA dopaminergic (DA) neurons (Fig-
ures S2A and S2B). The EGABA in VTA DA neurons from adult
rats receiving adolescent nicotine were indistinguishable from
that in saline-treated controls (Figure S2B): �76 ± 3 mV after
nicotine (indicated in red) versus �77 ± 2 mV in controls
(indicated in black), n = 6 cells per group, p > 0.05.
We previously showed that nicotine targets glucocorticoid
receptors to alter GABAergic signaling within the VTA (Doyon
et al., 2013). To examine whether glucocorticoid receptor
activation is necessary for adolescent nicotine to alter EGABA,
adolescent animals were injected with RU486 (40 mg/kg, i.p.
injections) 15 min prior to injections with saline or nicotine.
Systemic injection of RU486 prior to nicotine prevented the
adolescent nicotine-mediated alterations in EGABA (Figure 3D,
blue): �84 ± 2 mV, n = 6 cells, p > 0.05. These animals did not
differ significantly from controls treated with RU486 and saline
(data not shown): �83 ± 4 mV, n = 6 cells, p > 0.05.
We next examined the effect of post-adolescent nicotine
exposure on EGABA. Young adult animals were administered
nicotine or saline injections over a 2-week period (p60–p74),
and
slice
electrophysiology
experiments
were
conducted
approximately 1 month later. No differences in EGABA were
observed after adult nicotine exposure compared to adolescent
or adult saline-treated controls (Figure 3D, gray): �87 ± 4 mV,
n = 6 cells, p > 0.05. Therefore, long-lasting adaptations in EGABA
occur after adolescent, but not adult, exposure to nicotine.
A depolarizing shift in EGABA reflects higher intracellular anion
concentration and is often mediated by a decrease in Cl�
extrusion capacity. To test whether adolescent nicotine weakens
Cl� extrusion in VTA GABA neurons, we applied repetitive
GABAAR stimulation during whole-cell recordings under a
holding potential that favors chloride influx (Vh = 0 mV). Faster
rates of inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude reduc-
tion during repetitive stimulation are indicative of impaired
chloride extrusion (Hewitt et al., 2009). Adolescent nicotine-
treated animals showed significantly faster rates of IPSC
amplitude reduction compared to adolescent saline controls
(Figures 3E and 3F): F(2;5) = 9.30, p < 0.05. No differences in
synaptic depression were observed between groups when the
Cl� driving force was outward (Vh = �90 mV; Figure S2C). These
data confirm that the differential effects on short-term depres-
sion are derived from Cl� extrusion efficacy.
Adolescent Nicotine Downregulates KCC2 Expression
Reductions in Cl� extrusion capacity are often mediated by
downregulation of the K+, Cl� cotransporter, KCC2 (Sarkar
et al., 2011). To examine adolescent nicotine-induced alterations
in KCC2 protein expression, we performed western blot analysis
using an antibody against KCC2 protein. Immunoblots revealed
two prominent bands (�140 and �270 kDa), indicating the
presence of monomeric and dimeric structures of KCC2 protein
(Figure 3G). A significant reduction in the expression of KCC2
was
observed
after
adolescent
nicotine
pretreatment
(Figures 3G and 3H): 74% ± 6% for monomer, 76% ± 6% for
dimer, n = 12, p < 0.01. As reported previously (Taylor et al.,
2016), immunolabeling analysis suggested that KCC2 protein
was expressed on non-DA, GABAergic neurons within the VTA
(Figure S2D), which is consistent with the presence of another
chloride extrusion mechanism in DA neurons (Gula
´ csi et al.,
2003). These data indicate that adolescent nicotine exposure
induces long-lasting alterations in KCC2 expression, chloride
homeostasis, and GABAAR signaling within VTA GABA neurons.
Adolescent Nicotine Increases Ethanol-Induced
Inhibition of Dopamine Neurons Ex Vivo
VTA GABA transmission influences mesolimbic DA neuron
activity and is modulated upon exposure to ethanol (Tan et al.,
2012; Theile et al., 2008). Depolarizing shifts in EGABA within
the VTA GABA neurons were previously associated with greater
ethanol-induced inhibition of lateral VTA DA neurons (Ostroumov
et al., 2016). To determine whether adolescent nicotine exposure
altered ethanol-induced GABA release onto DA neurons, we
performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of VTA DA
neurons and measured spontaneous IPSCs (Figures 4A and
4B). In control rats, bath-applied ethanol (50 mM) produced
a small increase in spontaneous IPSC (sIPSC) frequency
(Figures 4C and 4D): 114% ± 4% of basal (indicated in black),

 n = 8. In contrast, lateral VTA DA neurons from rats treated with
nicotine
during
adolescence
showed
significantly
greater
ethanol-induced potentiation of sIPSC frequency compared to
the control response (Figures 4C and 4D): for nicotine-treated
rats, 177% ± 6% of basal, (indicated in red), n = 13, p < 0.01.
No significant differences in baseline sIPSC frequency were
detected between saline and nicotine groups: 4 ± 1 Hz in
saline-treated rats versus 4 ± 1 Hz in nicotine-treated rats
(p > 0.5). Importantly, neither group showed alterations in sIPSC
amplitude upon exposure to ethanol (45 ± 5 pA in saline-treated
versus 38 ± 6 pA in nicotine-treated rats, p > 0.05). An increase
in the frequency, but not the amplitude, of sIPSCs suggests
enhanced presynaptic GABA release onto the DA neurons.
Adolescent Nicotine Attenuates Ethanol-Induced
Dopamine Activity In Vivo
Ethanol application typically increases the firing of VTA DA
neurons, and a more depolarized EGABA in VTA GABA neurons
has been shown to attenuate DA responses to ethanol (Foddai
et al., 2004; Ostroumov et al., 2016). We therefore hypothesized
that adolescent nicotine exposure would also attenuate adult
ethanol-induced DA responses from the lateral VTA in vivo
(Figure 4E). To test this, we first conducted in vivo single-unit
recordings of lateral VTA DA neurons in anesthetized adult
rats. DA neurons were recorded in the lateral VTA and were
identified based on their electrophysiological and pharmacolog-
ical properties (see Experimental Procedures). The spontaneous

 firing rate of these VTA DA neurons was measured before and
after intravenous infusion of ethanol (0.3 mg/kg), and this
dose was increased every 3 min until a final concentration of
1.5 mg/kg was achieved. Basal spontaneous firing rate of
these DA neurons was not altered after exposure to adolescent
nicotine: 8.0 ± 0.7 Hz after nicotine and 7.4 ± 0.5 Hz in control.
Ethanol administration (0.6–1.5 mg/kg) induced a significant
increase in the spontaneous firing rate of lateral VTA DA neurons
in saline-treated controls (Figures 4F and 4G, indicated in
black): 124 ± 5% of basal, n = 17. In contrast, DA neurons
from adolescent nicotine-treated animals did not show signifi-
cant increases in DA firing (Figures 4F and 4G, indicated in
red): 98 ± 2% of basal, n = 7, p < 0.01. The VTA recording
sites from adolescent saline-treated (black) and adolescent
nicotine-treated (red) rats were similar across experiments
(Figure 4H).
The in vivo electrophysiology results suggest that adolescent
nicotine pretreatment attenuates DA responses to ethanol in
lateral VTA. To determine whether adolescent nicotine treatment
influences ethanol-induced DA signaling in freely moving rats,
we conducted in vivo microdialysis and measured ethanol-
induced DA release in the more medial nucleus accumbens
near the border of the medial shell and core (Figure 4J). A
sustained increase in DA was observed in saline-treated controls
upon ethanol administration (Figure 4I, black trace). Adolescent
nicotine-treated rats, in comparison, showed blunted DA re-
sponses to ethanol in this medial shell region (Figure 4I, red
trace): for Group 3 Time, F(9, 117) = 2.90, n = 8, 7 rats per group,
p < 0.01. No significant differences in baseline DA levels were
detected between saline and nicotine groups: 1.02 ± 0.21 nM
in saline-treated rats versus 1.06 ± 0.13 nM in nicotine-treated
rats. The placements of the microdialysis probes in the nucleus

 accumbens did not differ between saline (indicated in black) and
nicotine (indicated in red) treatment groups (Figure 4J; also see
an example placement in Figure S3A). Taken together, these
data indicate that adolescent nicotine exposure produced
long-lasting, circuit-wide adaptations in mesolimbic responses
to ethanol.
Restoring KCC2 Function Normalizes GABA Signaling
and Alcohol Self-Administration
Intracellular Cl� accumulation can be reversed by enhancing Cl�
extrusion with the KCC2 agonist CLP290 (CLP) (Gagnon et al.,
2013; Ostroumov et al., 2016). To determine whether CLP290
restored Cl� extrusion in VTA GABA neurons, we applied
repetitive GABAAR stimulation to slices incubated in CLP290
(>1 hr, 10 mM) under a holding potential (Vh) of 0 mV to induce
chloride influx (Figures 5A and 5B). Following CLP290 incuba-
tion, the rates of IPSC amplitude reduction were indistinguish-
able between adolescent nicotine-treated animals (indicated in
red) and adolescent saline-treated controls (indicated in black;
Figure 5C, p > 0.05).
Because CLP incubation prevented intracellular chloride
accumulation, we hypothesized that CLP incubation would
also prevent enhanced GABA release onto DA neurons in
adolescent nicotine-treated animals (Figure 5D). Indeed, the
nicotine-mediated potentiation of the sIPSC frequency by
ethanol was prevented by CLP290 incubation (Figure 5E)
(p > 0.05). The average sIPSC frequency induced by ethanol
(relative to basal) was 123% ± 4% in adolescent nicotine-treated
animals (Figure 5E, red bar with CLP treatment) and 123% ± 9%
in saline-treated controls (Figure 5E, black bar). These results
indicate that the effects of adolescent nicotine pretreatment on
altered ethanol-induced GABA network activity in the VTA could
be reversed by CLP290.
We next examined whether enhancing Cl� extrusion would
prevent elevated ethanol self-administration following adoles-
cent
nicotine
exposure.

Signaling and Ethanol Self-Administration
(A) Animals were exposed to saline or nicotine throughout adolescence
(p28–p42), and effects of CLP290 on GABAergic signaling were evaluated
using slice electrophysiology 4 weeks later (p70–p100).
(B) The effect of CLP290 on Cl� accumulation was estimated by stimulating
repetitive GABAAR input and measuring eIPSC amplitude in VTA GABA
neurons.
(C) Following CLP290 incubation, no differences were observed in the rate of
evoked amplitude depression in VTA GABA neurons between saline-treated
(black) and nicotine-treated (red) animals. n = 6, 9 cells per group.
(D) The effect of CLP290 on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(sIPSCs) onto VTA DA neurons were recorded using the whole-cell patch-
clamp configuration in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists.
(E) Following CLP290 incubation, no differences were observed between
saline-treated and nicotine-treated animals in the sIPSC frequency. n = 6,

 received infusions of vehicle (1.04 ± 0.03 g/kg, red bar); n = 9,
13 rats per group, p < 0.01. Bilateral VTA cannulation and vehicle
infusions did not significantly alter ethanol consumption in
adolescent saline-treated controls compared to controls without
surgery (Figures 5G and 5H, dotted gray lines): 0.75 ± 0.04 g/kg,
n = 6, p > 0.05. In addition, intra-VTA infusions of CLP290 did
not significantly alter ethanol consumption in adolescent sa-
line-treated animals compared to vehicle infusions (Figure S4,
blue bar): 0.63 ± 0.05 g/kg, n = 5, p > 0.05. Infusion sites were
similarly distributed throughout the anterior/posterior axis of
the VTA (Figures S3B and S4).
DISCUSSION
Adolescent tobacco exposure is predictive of pathological drink-
ing later in life (Jensen et al., 2003; Riala et al., 2004), but the
neuronal adaptations underlying this interaction have not been
well delineated. We demonstrated in rats that repeated exposure
to nicotine during adolescence, but not adulthood, promotes
long-lasting increases in ethanol self-administration. In VTA
GABA neurons, adolescent nicotine treatment functionally
downregulated KCC2, attenuated Cl� extrusion, and caused a
depolarizing shift in EGABA. These alterations were associated
with enhanced GABAergic inhibition of DA neurons in the lateral
VTA upon ethanol exposure and diminished DA responses
to ethanol. Most importantly, enhancing chloride extrusion in
adolescent nicotine-treated animals prevented alterations in
VTA GABA signaling and normalized ethanol self-administration
to control levels.
Adolescence is thought to be a critical period of neural devel-
opment, and drug exposure during this time is known to induce
persistent neurobehavioral alterations (Chambers et al., 2003;
Spear, 2016). Here, we show that adolescent, but not adult,
nicotine exposure increases ethanol self-administration and
induces depolarizing shifts in EGABA. These findings support
previous work suggesting that a unique vulnerability to nicotine
may exist during adolescence (Adriani et al., 2003; Counotte
et al., 2009; La
´ rraga et al., 2017) and point to differential regula-
tion of GABAergic transmission as a factor mediating adolescent
vulnerability to substance use.
Within the VTA, GABAARs on GABA and DA neurons can
show differential responses to drugs of abuse (Tan et al.,
2012). We previously demonstrated that GABAAR signaling
onto VTA GABA neurons is positively modulated by ethanol
and contributes to ethanol reinforcement (Ostroumov et al.,
2016). Depolarizing shifts in GABAAR signaling within the VTA
have been reported in adult animals under conditions of stress,
drug dependence, and withdrawal (Laviolette et al., 2004;
Taylor et al., 2016), but our results demonstrate that these adap-
tations can persist into adulthood following an adolescent drug
exposure. These long-lasting alterations in GABAAR signaling
may, therefore, represent a neurobiological mechanism by which
adolescent nicotine exposure acts as a gateway for subsequent
alcohol use and abuse (Chen et al., 2002; Cross et al., 2017; Tor-
abi et al., 1993).
The strength of GABAergic inhibition is dynamically regulated
in the adult nervous system through changes in the transmem-
brane chloride gradient (Doyon et al., 2016). We provide
evidence that changes in EGABA following adolescent nicotine
treatment arise from impaired chloride extrusion and downregu-
lation of the K+, Cl� transporter KCC2. This neuron-specific
transporter is differentially expressed across development and
differentially regulated by environmental exposures (Williams
et al., 1999). In mature neurons, KCC2 downregulation is known
to occur in pathological conditions like epilepsy and chronic pain
(Kaila et al., 2014). More recently, KCC2 downregulation has also
been observed in VTA GABA neurons following acute stress and
opiate withdrawal (Ostroumov et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2016).
Thus, KCC2 is a key molecular target underlying changes in
GABAergic signaling across the CNS.
Our findings suggest the involvement of glucocorticoid recep-
tors, which have previously been shown to reduce KCC2 activity
via S940 dephosphorylation (Ostroumov et al., 2016). It is known
that dephosphorylation at S940 precedes KCC2 internalization
and decreased membrane expression (Lee et al., 2007), which
suggests that adolescent exposure to nicotine more potently
drives KCC2 downregulation compared to acute stress. Future
work should examine the intermediate signaling molecules
from glucocorticoid receptors to changes in KCC2 expression,
because these mechanisms may differ between adolescent
and adult populations.
Downstream of the KCC2 and VTA GABA neuron alterations,
there was increased ethanol-induced inhibition of lateral VTA
DA neurons and attenuated ethanol-induced DA responses
measured in the medial nucleus accumbens from adolescent
nicotine-treated animals. These electrophysiological data were
collected in an anesthetized preparation and correspond to a
blunted, but still present, increase in DA release to ethanol in
freely moving animals. The DA release was measured by micro-
dialysis sampling from the border between the medial shell and
core of the nucleus accumbens. Because DA signaling is hetero-
geneous from its source in the midbrain to its targets throughout
the striatum and elsewhere (Lammel et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2018), the amplitude and temporal DA signal throughout the nu-
cleus accumbens in response to ethanol is not anticipated to be
homogeneous. Furthermore, ethanol acts at multiple targets
within the midbrain to elicit DA release, including glutamatergic,
GABAergic, and direct actions on DA neuron cell firing (Harris,
1999). We observed elevated DA responses during ethanol
administration in all animals, but intermediate responses (from
the areas we recorded) were associated with greater ethanol
intake. This correlation between intermediate DA responses to
ethanol and enhanced ethanol self-administration is consistent
across multiple studies (Brodie and Appel, 2000; Doyon et al.,
2013; Ostroumov et al., 2016; Ramachandra et al., 2007) and
illustrates how impaired chloride extrusion can influence broader
mesolimbic responses to ethanol.
Direct modulation of KCC2 is a favored therapeutic strategy
to restore GABAA function under conditions involving impaired
Cl� transport (Gagnon et al., 2013). We showed that, following
adolescent nicotine exposure, elevated drinking in adulthood
could be prevented by intra-VTA infusion of the KCC2 agonist,
CLP290. These results suggest that chloride extrusion en-
hancers may serve as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate
excessive alcohol consumption in smoking populations. Taken
together, these results reveal that adolescent nicotine exposure
74
Cell Reports 23, 68–77, April 3, 2018
 induces long-lasting alterations in mesolimbic responses to
ethanol and promotes ethanol consumption in adulthood.
Thus, adolescent tobacco use may increase the risk for exces-
sive alcohol drinking in adulthood.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male Long-Evans rats (Harlan-Envigo) were singly housed in a quiet tempera-
ture- and humidity-controlled satellite facility under a 12-hr:12-hr light:dark
cycle. Rats had food and water available ad libitum in their home cages. All
procedures were carried out in compliance with guidelines specified by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania.
Drugs and Experimental Design
All drugs (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in sterile saline
unless otherwise specified. Rats were administered daily injections of saline
or nicotine tartrate (0.4 mg/kg, freebase, i.p. injections) during adolescence
(p28–p42), and responses to ethanol were assessed in adulthood beginning
4 weeks later. The p28–p42 window represents a conservative time frame
within adolescence (Spear, 2000). A separate cohort of animals was pretreated
with RU486 (40 mg/kg, i.p. injections) 15 min prior to each adolescent nicotine
injection to examine the contribution of glucocorticoid receptor signaling.
Comparable injections were carried out in post-adolescent animals (>p60
or 300 g), and responses to ethanol were assessed 4 weeks post-nicotine
exposure. Intra-VTA microinfusions of CLP290 or vehicle occurred 30 min prior
to ethanol self-administration over 3 non-consecutive days. Animals that
received vehicle infusions were indistinguishable from non-surgerized controls
and were thus combined. The intra-VTA concentration of CLP290 was 50 mM
delivered at 0.5 mL/min to 1 mL (Ostroumov et al., 2016) at the following VTA
coordinates (in millimeters relative to bregma): +5.7 anterior-posterior, +1.0
medial-lateral, �7.1 ventral to the skull surface (Paxinos, 2007). A separate
group of rats treated with 45 mM CLP290 before the first day of self-adminis-
tration were indistinguishable from the 50-mM treatment group, and these
results were thus combined.
Operant Ethanol Self-Administration
Standard operant chambers (Med Associates) were used for the self-adminis-
tration experiments. Illumination of an interior chamber light and presentation
of a retractable lever cued the start of each session. Depression of the lever
triggered the entry of a retractable drinking spout on the opposite side of
the wall. Each lever press resulted in 15 s of access to the drinking spout
(a fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule of 1). Animals initially had restricted
access to water overnight and were trained to press a lever for a saccharin
solution (0.125%, w/v). Once trained, the animals no longer had restricted
access to water, and their basal saccharin intake was monitored until intake
appeared stable for 3 consecutive days (one 60-min session per day). If the
animals underwent surgery, saccharin intake was re-established. The effects
of nicotine or saline pretreatment on 2%–4% ethanol self-administration
were then measured (Ostroumov et al., 2016). We previously confirmed that
this self-administration protocol produces pharmacologically relevant blood
alcohol levels ranging from 40 to 160 mg/dL (Ostroumov et al., 2016). In com-
parison, the legal limit of alcohol intoxication in humans is 80 mg/dL. For 8%
ethanol studies, initial ethanol fading (2%–8%) occurred over the first 8 days
in a saccharin solution (0.15%, w/v), and intake of 8% ethanol consumption
was then monitored for 7 consecutive days (Doyon et al., 2005). A separate
cohort of animals followed the same 8-day ethanol-fading procedure
(2%–8%), but saccharin was then gradually removed over 6 days. Intake of
8% ethanol without saccharin was subsequently monitored for 7 consecutive
days.
Ex Vivo Electrophysiology
Horizontal slices (230 mm) containing the VTA were cut (Leica Microsystems)
from adult Long-Evans rats in ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2),
high-sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in millimolar): 205.0 sucrose,
2.5 KCl, 21.4 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 7.5 MgCl2, and 11.1 dextrose.
Immediately after cutting, slices were transferred to normal ACSF buffer
(in millimolar): 120.0 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 25.0 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2,
1.0 MgCl2, 10.0 dextrose, and 20.0 sucrose. The slices were constantly
oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) and maintained at 32�C in ACSF for 40 min,
then at room temperature for at least 60 min. For incubation experiments,
slices were bathed in CLP290 (10 mM) for an additional hour. To perform
electrophysiological recordings, slices were transferred to a holding chamber
and perfused with normal ACSF at a constant rate of 2–3 mL/min at 32�C.
Patch electrodes made of thin-walled borosilicate glass (1.12 mm inner diam-
eter [ID], 1.5 mm outer diameter [OD]; World Precision Instruments [WPI]) had
resistances of 1.0–2.0 MU when filled with the internal solution (in millimolar):
135.0 KCl, 12.0 NaCl, 2.0 Mg-ATP, 0.5 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, and 0.3 Tris-
GTP (pH 7.2–7.3).
For EGABA perforated-patch recordings, gramicidin was first dissolved in
methanol to a concentration of 10 mg/mL and then diluted in a pipette so-
lution to a final concentration of 150 mg/mL. For synaptic stimulation
recordings, a bipolar tungsten-stimulating electrode (World Precision
Instruments) was placed 100–150 mm away from the recording electrode.
To determine EGABA, evoked IPSCs were measured under voltage clamp
at different holding potentials. Amplitudes of IPSCs were plotted against
voltage to estimate the reversal potential. After each perforated-patch
experiment, recordings were converted to the whole-cell configuration,
and Ih current was measured. When necessary, recordings were performed
in the presence of DNQX, AP5, CGP55845, and tetrodotoxin (0.5 mM) to
isolate GABAergic currents.
VTA GABA neurons in the lateral VTA were identified by a combination of
factors, including small somata size, high firing rate (>7 Hz), and the lack
of Ih current. Cells with these properties were consistently tyrosine hydrox-
ylase (TH) negative (> 95%) (Korotkova et al., 2006; Ostroumov et al., 2016).
Basal spontaneous firing rate of GABA neurons was not altered after expo-
sure to the nicotine treatment: 16 ± 3 Hz after nicotine and 14 ± 3 Hz in
control. In contrast, DA neurons were identified in the lateral VTA by their
morphology (>20 mm soma size), their low firing frequency (<5 Hz), and
the presence of a large Ih current, which, together, was shown to correlate
(95%) with TH-positive cells using immunocytochemistry approaches
(Doyon et al., 2013; Ostroumov et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010). Basal
spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons ex vivo was not altered after
exposure to the adolescent nicotine treatment: 1.9 ± 0.3 Hz after nicotine
treatment and 1.6 ± 0.1 Hz in control. Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic
currents onto DA neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in the
whole-cell configuration. Synaptic GABAA inputs were isolated pharmaco-
logically. To measure activity-dependent depression of evoked IPSCs,
whole-cell recordings were performed during repetitive stimulation (Hewitt
et al., 2009). The estimated GABA reversal was approximately �70 mV,
and the internal solution contained (in milllimolar): 123.0 K+-gluconate,
8.0 NaCl, 2.0 Mg-ATP, 0.2 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, and 0.3 Tris-GTP (pH
7.2–7.3). Synaptic GABAA input was isolated using DNQX, AP5, and
CGP55845. The liquid junction potential between the bath and the pipette
solutions was corrected.
Western Blots
The VTA was harvested in horizontal brain slices from adult rats, and the
VTA slices were prepared as described previously in the Ex Vivo Electrophys-
iology section. Membrane fractions were prepared using the Mem-PER Plus
Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Model #89842; Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA). Samples (30 mg protein) in 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol were run through
a 4%–15% Precast Protein Gel (#4561083; Bio-Rad). The sample was trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used were
rabbit anti-KCC2 antibody at 1:400 (#07-432; Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA)
and mouse anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) anti-
body (#MAB374; Millipore) at 1:400. Secondary antibodies used were goat
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G secondary antibody (#T2191; Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM (#T2192,
Applied Biosystems). All antibodies were diluted in SignalBoost solution
(#407207; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were developed
using Tropix CDP-Star solution (T2218; Applied Biosystems) for 5 min and
then scanned using the Protein Simple FluorChem R chemiluminescence

 detector and analyzed using AlphaView SA software. The optical densities of
KCC2-specific bands were measured and normalized to the loading control
GAPDH values.
To analyze KCC2 immunolabeling in the VTA, rats were perfused with
PBS (Chemicon), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Boston BioProducts).
Brains were post-fixed for additional 2 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde and then
kept in 30% sucrose for 24–48 hr. VTA sections were cut at 30 mm and
processed with antibodies against KCC2 (1:500, Millipore, #07-432) and
TH (1:1,000, Millipore, #MAB318) or GAD-67 (1:150, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, #sc-5602) overnight at 4�C. After washing in PBS, immunofluores-
cence reactions were visualized using secondary antibodies labeled with
Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,000; Invitrogen) and confocal
microscopy.
In Vivo Electrophysiology
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted with a catheter in the
jugular vein. Animals were positioned on a stereotaxic apparatus, and burr
holes were drilled into the skull to accommodate recording and ground
electrodes. Rat body temperature was maintained throughout the experi-
ment at 37�C using an isothermal pad. Glass electrodes backfilled with
0.5 M Na+-acetate and 2% Chicago Sky Blue (5–15 MU) were positioned
in the lateral VTA (coordinates: 5.3–6.0 mm posterior from bregma,
0.8–1.4 mm lateral to midline, and 7.5–8.5 mm ventral to brain surface).
Electrical signals were filtered at 0.3–5 kHz. DA neurons in the lateral VTA
were identified in vivo using established electrophysiological and pharma-
cological criteria (Ostroumov et al., 2016). After 6–20 min of stable baseline
recording, we infused 0.3 g/kg of ethanol (by intravenous [i.v.] injection)
every 3 min to a final dose of 1.5 g/kg over 15 min. Drug-induced changes
were detected by the second infusion period and were comparable across
all dose ranges (0.6–1.5 mg/kg). Following ethanol administration, the D2
receptor agonist quinpirole and the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride
were infused (i.v. injection, 0.25 mg/kg) to aid in the identification of
VTA DA neurons. Chicago Sky Blue injections were used to identify the
recording sites.
In Vivo Microdialysis
Microdialysis studies were carried out as previously reported (Doyon et al.,
2013). Animals were habituated to tethering and the microdialysis chambers
1 day prior to testing. Baseline DA samples were collected (15–30 min),
followed by a timed i.v. infusion of ethanol (1.5 g/kg, 20% in sterile
saline, v/v) over 5 min. The i.v. route (using a cannula) was chosen to circum-
vent handling-related disturbances in DA levels associated with i.p. injections
(Dong et al., 2010). Dialysis samples were analyzed for DA content using
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to an electrochemical
detector.
Statistical Analysis
An ANOVA with repeated measures (in SPSS for Windows) was used to
analyze the daily ethanol intake and dialysate DA concentrations. Exponential
fittings were compared by F test. For western blot analysis, a paired t test was
used to compare protein levels from saline- and nicotine-treated animals that
were run on the same gel. A two-tailed t test assuming equal variance was
used to assess differences between the mean GABA reversal potential, sIPSC
frequency, ethanol intake, and DA firing rate. Significance for all analyses was
determined by p < 0.05.
