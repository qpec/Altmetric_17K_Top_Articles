background Dog bite studies are typically based 
on hospital records and may be biased towards bites 
requiring significant medical treatment. This study 
investigated true dog bite prevalence and incidence at a 
community-level and victim-related risk factors, in order 
to inform policy and prevention.
Methods A cross-sectional study of a community 
of 1280 households in Cheshire, UK, surveyed 694 
respondents in 385 households. Data included dog 
ownership and bite history, demographics, health and 
personality (Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) brief 
measure). Multivariable logistic regression modelled risk 
factors for having ever been bitten by a dog, accounting 
for clustering of individuals within households.
results A quarter of participants (24.78%, 95% CI 
21.72 to 28.13) reported having ever been bitten by 
a dog during their lifetime, with only a third of bites 
described requiring further medical treatment and 
0.6% hospital admission. Incidence of dog bites was 
18.7 (11.0–31.8) per 1000 population per year. Males 
were 1.81 times more likely to have been bitten in their 
lifetime than females (95% CI 1.20 to 2.72, P=0.005). 
Current owners of multiple dogs were 3.3 times more 
likely (95% CI 1.13 to 9.69, P=0.03) to report having 
been bitten than people not currently owning a dog. 
Regarding all bites described, most commonly people 
were bitten by a dog that they had never met before the 
incident (54.7%). Individuals scoring higher in emotional 
stability had a lower risk of having ever been bitten 
(OR=0.77 for 1 point change in scale between 1 and 7, 
95% CI 0.66 to 0.9, P=0.001).
Conclusion This study suggests that the real burden 
of dog bites is considerably larger than those estimated 
from hospital records. Further, many bites do not require 
medical treatment and hospital-based bite data are 
not representative of bites within the wider population. 
Victim personality requires further investigation and 
potential consideration in the design of bite prevention 
schemes.
InTroduCTIon
With a dog population of around 8.5 
million1 in the 
UK (ie, 1 for every 7–8 people in a population of 
65 
million)2 dog bites are bound to occur.3 However, 
the rate of dog bite occurrence remains unknown,4 
which has implications for knowledge of the true 
burden on public health and economic loss to the 
health system. There are an estimated 6743 hospital 
admissions for ‘dog bites and strikes’ per year in 
England5 and 9500 for dog bites in USA.6 Dog bite 
rates are also thought to be rising.6 7 However, these 
figures actually concern ‘bites and strikes’ from a 
dog (strikes meaning injury caused by a dog but not 
from a bite), yet are commonly misreported as dog 
bites.4 Statistics concerning actual dog bites require 
clarification. Further, prevalence studies based on 
hospital admission records do not include likely 
less serious dog bites which do not require medical 
treatment or are treated elsewhere, including Acci-
dent and Emergency.4 8 9 In a population-based 
study in USA over 20 years ago, six times more bites 
occurred than required medical attention.10 The 
current often cited incidence for UK is estimated 
to be around 2.5 per 100 
000 requiring hospital 
admission and 740 per 100 
000 bitten.11 However, 
these figures are based on out-of-date data, incor-
rectly cited or even no true source is known4 and 
medical literature has a tendency to exaggerate dog 
bite risk.12 Given the implications of even minor 
dog bites to both physical health13 (including rabies 
in some countries)14 and psychological health,15 16 
newer and more accurate figures are essential.
With 21 fatal UK dog attacks occurring within 
10 years, pressure has been put on governments 
to enact more control measures and protect the 
public.17 Experts feel that there is a lack of under-
standing as to how victim/owner behaviour and 
misunderstanding of dog signalling can provoke 
dog bites, and they also have significant doubt as to 
the effectiveness of current dog bite reduction legis-
lation.3 18–20 The UK Dangerous Dogs Act (1991) 
has recently been extended such that dog owners 
can be also prosecuted for bites occurring on private 
property.21 This was in our view sensible and due to 
expert opinion and evidence that most bites occur 
from a familiar dog in familiar surroundings;18 22 23 
however, other studies do contradict this view.24 25 
New data are required in order to evidence whether 
people are generally bitten by familiar or unfamiliar 
dogs, as bite prevention strategies may need to be 
approached quite differently for different contexts 
and the importance of both contexts addressed 
adequately in prevention initiatives.
The first aim of this study was to provide a 
community population-level estimate for dog bite 
prevalence (how many people report ever having 
been bitten by a dog) and incidence (rate of new 
dog bites per year). The second aim was to esti-
mate the proportion of dog bites that require 
medical treatment and if so, where treatment was 
sought. The third aim of this study was to deter-
mine victim-related factors associated with having

ever been bitten by a dog at the population level. Hypothesised 
variables of importance based on previous research in other 
population types (such as hospital based data) and geographical 
locations included age and gender.26 Others hypothesised to be 
important included: current dog ownership, as this is likely to 
increase opportunity for interactions with dogs; education level, 
as socioeconomic factors can influence public health outcomes 
such as risk of injuries; general health, as health conditions 
may influence the nature of interactions with dogs; reasons for 
getting a dog, as this may again influence the type of interactions 
that occur with the dog and personality, due to expert opinion 
that victim behaviour around dogs is important and behaviour 
may be influenced by personality. The fourth aim was to identify 
the most common relationships between victims and the dogs 
that bit them.
MeThods
A cross-sectional census study of 1280 households was 
conducted between June and August 2015 in part of a 
semirural town in Cheshire West. This area was chosen 
because of its mixture of housing types, definition by natural 
and man-made boundaries and convenience as a research loca-
tion and has been used for previous research.27 28 Attempts 
were made to survey all households within the study area by 
knocking on their door up to five times. The interviewers 
were female veterinary students, personable and briefed in 
friendly interview technique. Contact was made with 984 
households (76.9%) and 217 (22.1%) declined to participate. 
For 767 households (77.9%), a brief survey was completed 
at the door asking about current and past dog ownership. 
Further paper questionnaires were provided for all household 
members; a different questionnaire was issued for adults and 
children (5–15 years). There was also an option to complete 
the questionnaire online. In total, 698 households (91.0% of 
those door-step interviewed) were left with questionnaires for 
1591 eligible participants aged over 5 years. Questions related 
to the individuals’ health, exercise, dog ownership and dog 
bites as well as collecting demographic information. Postcard 
reminders were sent at 2 weeks and a second copy of the ques-
tionnaire at 4 weeks. The data for this paper were collected as 
part of a wider study comparing health and physical activity of 
dog owners and non-dog owners, for which children less than 
5 years were not included due to difficulties in studying these 
outcomes using even parental surveys. The study conformed to 
the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki.
outcomes
Participants were asked to report how many times they had 
been bitten by a dog (if at all) and whether a dog bite occurred 
in the last year (yes/no). Participants were asked to choose one 
bite event to provide further information on. This included: 
whether the participant knew the dog (No, I did not know the 
dog previous to this occasion/Yes, but only briefly (seen on walks 
and so on)/Yes 
it was a well know friend/family members dog/
Yes, it was my own dog); how old they were at the time of the 
bite (years) and whether they required medical treatment from a 
doctor or hospital (yes/no) and where from (Hospital-admitted/
Accident 
and Emergency/Walk 
in Centre/GP 
Surgery/Other).
Variables
Demographic data collected included: current age (calculated 
from year of birth); gender (male/female) and highest educa-
tion level (16 options). Education was later categorised into 
four categories (see table 1). Participants were asked how many 
dogs they currently owned. Participants who owned dogs were 
also asked to indicate their (multiple) reasons were for getting 
a dog: (companionship/protection/ 
interest/hobby/gift/ 
to show/
to breed/exercise/working dog/always had a dog/family 
member 
wanted a dog/other). Dog owners were also asked whether they 
usually participated in walking the dog (yes/no). All respondents 
were asked to rate their general health on a five-point scale of 
poor to excellent. ‘Big Five’ personality traits were assessed for

all adults using the validated 10-Item Personality Inventory,29 on 
a scale of 1–7.
Analysis
Confidence intervals for sample proportions were estimated 
using the Wilson method in EpiTools.30 Missing data were 
excluded from analysis. The association between categor-
ical variables, such as demographic factors and bite-related 
outcomes was assessed using χ²  analysis. Univariable binary 
logistic regression analysis was also conducted to assess associ-
ations between variables and the primary outcome of whether 
the person had ever been bitten by a dog. Variables which had 
a P value of 0.250 or lower were used to construct a multi-
variable model and a backwards stepwise selection process 
was conducted until all remaining variables were significant 
at P<0.05. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression 
analysis was used to explore the association between explan-
atory variables and the outcome variable, while accounting 
for clustering of participants within households. Models were 
built for outcome ever been bitten by a dog (Model A) and on 
a subset excluding those who reported details of a bite that 
occurred over 5 years ago (Model B). Analysis was conducted 
using the R Language for Statistical Computing,31 including 
the lme4 package for mixed effects modelling.
resulTs
sample characteristics
A total of 694 (43.6%) participants returned their question-
naires, from 385 (55.2%) households that were given question-
naires to return, out of a total sample of 1280 households (total 
household response rate 30.1%). The sample characteristics for 
the population completing the survey are outlined in table 1. 
There were slightly more female than male participants and the 
majority of individuals within the study were of an older age.
description of dog bites reported
A quarter (24.78%, 95% 
CI 21.72 to 28.13, n=172) of the 
respondents had been bitten by a dog on at least one occasion. 
In total, 301 bites were reported. Only 13 (1.87%, 95% 
CI 1.10 
to 3.18) individuals had been bitten in the last 12 months. This 
equates to a dog bite incidence of 18.7/1000 per year (95% 
CI 
11.0 to 31.8). Of the individuals who reported ever being bitten 
(172), 57.6% had only been bitten once (mean 1.75, range 9). 
Only 33.1% of the dog bites described required any medical 
treatment. The number of times individuals had been bitten did 
not alter this figure, and there was no evidence of an association 
between medical treatment and gender (P=0.412). To summarise 
where medical treatment occurred if it was sought: 33 (58.9%) 
A&E; 17 (30.3%) general practitioner; 4 (7.1%) walk-in centre; 
1 (1.8%) hospital admission and 1 (1.8%) police station.
Forty-four per cent of the bites described occurred in child-
hood (<16 years). However, of the 48 children surveyed (aged 
5–15) within the study only three had been bitten (6.3%). All 
other reports of childhood bites were retrospective as adults and 
many (69.2%) described a bite that occurred more than 15 years 
ago. Over half (54.7%) of people were bitten by dogs they had 
never met before. Of the 87 individuals who had been bitten only 
once, 51 (58.6%) reported not knowing the dog, indicating that 
this finding is not due to reporting bias. There was no evidence 
that the relationship with the dog that bit varied by current dog 
ownership, whether medical treatment was sought, victim age or 
gender (table 2).
Factors associated with having ever being bitten by a dog
Univariable analysis findings and numbers reported by bitten/
never bitten are presented in the online supplementary file. 
Current age risk was found to have a non-linear shape, with 
increasing risk that plateaued at approximately age 50. There-
fore for final model building of Model A, the upper age was 
limited to 50 (all ages above this recoded to 50), so that the risk 
pertaining to cumulative age could be included and modelled in 
a linear manner.
On multivariable analysis (table 3), for model A (ever bitten 
by a dog), males were 1.81 times more likely to have ever been 
bitten than females (95% 
CI 1.20 to 2.72, P=0.005). Multiple 
dog owners were 3.31 times more likely to have ever been bitten 
than non-dog owners (95% 
CI 1.13 to 9.69, P=0.03). Odds of 
ever being bitten increased with age (up to 50) by 1.03 (95% CI 
1.01 to 1.06) per year (P=0.01), which is unsurprising as this 
measures cumulative risk over lifespan to date and an important 
adjustment to include in the model. Scoring as more emotionally 
stable/lower neuroticism by one a point change in score (between 
1 and 7) decreased the likelihood of experiencing a bite by 0.77 
times (95% 
CI 0.66 to 0.90, P=0.001). Similar variables were 
found to be associated in Model B where those reporting being

research report
bitten in the past 5 years (28 participants) were analysed against 
those reporting never having been bitten by a dog. However, 
the findings of this model should be interpreted with caution 
due to small sample size and the fact that it will have excluded 
people who were bitten more than once but chose to report 
details of a different bite than the one that occurred during the 
past 5 years, as we could not tell if they were bitten in the past 5 
years also. However the findings reassure that gender, number of 
dogs and personality-emotional stability are important factors. 
Current age was this time not significant, not surprising given 
that cumulative lifetime risk is not important given we are only 
modelling bites in the last 5 years. However, it also does not 
provide evidence that current age (near to the time of the bite) 
was associated with bite risk.
dIsCussIon
This study provides much improved indicators of the true burden 
of dog bites on public health. One in four people had ever been 
bitten by a dog and when a bite occurred, only one-third sought 
any form of medical treatment. Only 1 of the 172 bites (0.6%) 
reported in more detail resulted in hospital admission; given the 
small sample size and self-selection of which bites to describe 
further, this finding must be interpreted with caution but may 
suggest that figures based on hospital admission records (eg, 
6743 hospital admissions for ‘dog bites and strikes’ per year in 
England5 are a large underestimation of true incidence). Although 
in some senses this is reassuring that many dog bites do not cause 
significant physical injury, it is also known that even relatively 
minor bites can cause significant distress to the victim;16 thus 
they should not be considered unimportant to prevent. Perhaps 
multiple dog owners were more likely to complete the survey 
and inflate our dog bite incidences; however, the annual inci-
dence of dog bites over the previous 12 months in our commu-
nity was 18.7 per 1000 population which matches almost exactly 
population based studies in USA in the 1990s10 and 2000s.32 Our 
incidence of 1873 per 100 
000 per year is nearly three times that 
of the 740 per 100 
000 often cited but with no clear source.11 
Regarding victim-level risk factors, our discovery that reporting 
being more emotionally stable is associated with reduced odds of 
having been bitten by a dog, is completely novel and unreported 
elsewhere. Males were also 1.6 times more likely to have been 
bitten than females and owners of multiple dogs were 3.3 times 
more likely to have experienced a bite than non-dog owners. 
Regarding our final aim, it was more common for participants 
to have been bitten by dogs completely unknown to them than 
familiar dogs.
This study has strengths and limitations. It only examined 
households in one geographical location and thus may not be 
generalisable to the wider population. It was part of a semirural 
small town, with a variety of housing types and socioeconomic 
factors.27 Within the survey population, 200 people (28.8%) 
reported currently owning a dog which is similar to estima-
tions made by other studies conducted within UK.1 However, 
the respondents to the survey were proportionally more females 
(less likely to have been bitten) and older age groups (more likely 
to have been bitten). Furthermore, under 5 
s, thought to be a 
high risk population, were not surveyed. In addition, the North-
West of England experiences the highest rates of hospital admis-
sions due to dog bites in the UK.5 Thus there are a number of 
reasons why our findings in terms of prevalence and incidence 
could have been both overestimated but also underestimated.
However, this study provides the first UK-based investiga-
tion of prevalence, incidence and risk factors for dog bites at 
a community population level and has significant advantages 
over hospital attendance data sources. One limitation of the data 
collected regarding the circumstances of the dog bite is that the 
respondent was asked to choose one bite event to describe if they 
had experienced multiple bites. However, a substantial number 
of bite victims within the study reported they had only been 
bitten once (57.6%), therefore it was possible to investigate the 
potential for bias by comparing relationships based on all dog 
bites with those based on individuals that had been bitten once 
and none was found. It is unknown whether the proportion of 
hospital admissions for dog bites, or even the actual rate of dog 
bites, has changed over the years, and as these data were collected 
retrospectively covering a number of years, it is unknown if it 
had an effect. While assessing bites retrospectively may lead to 
some details of the event being forgotten, it is unlikely that this 
would have affected the relatively simple questions regarding the 
bite required within this study. Recall problems are most likely 
when there is little time to retrieve information, the activity is 
common and timing is required to be recalled accurately.33 Dog 
bites are relatively uncommon over a lifetime, may be emotion-
ally significant and we did not require specific timing of the 
event except for an indication of whether it had occurred in the 
past year.
Males were more likely to be bitten than females, which 
supports evidence from other studies at least in children.34–36 
It may be that men receive more serious injuries and so are 
more likely to appear in hospital data; however, there was no 
evidence here that men were more likely to require medical 
treatment than women. It could be hypothesised that person-
ality variation between genders has resulted in more males 
being subject to dog bites. Reporting being less emotionally 
stable was associated with an increased frequency of dog 
bites and so was being male. However, the multivariable anal-
ysis conducted adjust for the effects of these variables inde-
pendently, and males were more likely to rate themselves as 
being more emotionally stable (data not shown). Negative indi-
cators of emotional stability include descriptors such as insecu-
rity, fear, instability and intrusiveness.37 Neuroticism (the other 
name for emotional stability) is well known to be linked to 
public health behaviours and outcomes;38 39 perhaps then this 
aspect of personality may be linked to performing behaviours 
that provoke dog bites. However, perhaps any association is 
not causal, in that people that have been bitten become more 
nervous or the association is being confounded by another 
factor such as socioeconomic status. Previous research has 
outlined mental disorders40 and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder in children41 as risk factors for dog bites. Another 
study found that less shy children took greater risks with a 
therapy dog.42 This adds strength to our finding that person-
ality may be associated with dog bite incidence. There also 
is  evidence of an association between parent personality and 
child parenting style,43 which appears to echo in links between 
owner personality and dog personality44 and the nature of the 
dog–owner relationship.45 These studies suggest that nervous/
anxious owners may have nervous/anxious dogs, which may 
be another explanation for increased bite risk. Much more 
research into the possible association with personality is now 
required, especially in order to understand if and how this 
knowledge could be used in dog bite prevention.
Many previous studies report that individuals are more 
commonly bitten by dogs that are familiar to them;15 23 46 
however, this study has demonstrated that 54.7% of bites were 
by dogs the victim had never before seen. One hypothesis that 
could explain this difference is a possible bias towards people

research report
seeking medical treatment if bitten by a dog known to them,35 46 
resulting in these types of dog bites appearing in hospital data. 
However, there was no evidence in our study that relationship to 
the dog varied with whether or not they received medical treat-
ment. It may be that the association is present but not detectable 
given the study size.
Many of the historical bites reported occurred to individ-
uals when they were young; however, only 3 of the 48 current 
children within the study (6.3%) had been bitten. This could 
indicate that childhood bites are becoming less common than 
they once were. Reduction of children playing outdoors in the 
modern era may be reducing the incidence of dog bites in chil-
dren, in particular by strange dogs.47 The relatively high propor-
tion of bites from unfamiliar dogs reported by participants in 
this study could be related to reporting of bites that occurred 
many years ago in childhood when free-roaming dogs were more 
commonplace. The relationships between risk of dog bite, age at 
bite and relationship to the dog require further investigation in 
a larger sample.
Multiple dog owners have previously been found to be 
at increased risk of dog bites,32 as here. It could be hypothe-
sised that owners of multiple dogs may be a greater risk due 
to breaking up dog fights8 or simply having greater exposure 
to dogs and is a recommended area for further research, for 
example: are these bites from their own dog? are dog fights 
more likely? do these persons have increased exposure to other 
dogs in general? are multiple dog owners more likely to work in 
dog-related professions?
Our proportion of bites requiring hospital admission (0.6%) 
was very low and proportion requiring any medical treatment 
(33%) was higher rather than lower than the 19% reported in 
USA.32 Potential bias introduced into our estimate from those 
bitten multiple times is likely to be towards choosing to report 
to us the more serious injuries than less serious, meaning our 
proportion of bites described requiring hospital treatment may 
be underestimated. In fact, the proportions requiring medical 
treatment were similar even if someone had only been bitten 
once so we can be confident in our estimate in this respect. 
However, it must be noted that these statistical estimates is based 
on one community survey in one geographical area and thus it 
is questionable whether it can be generalised to the entire of 
England and certainly requires repeating to validate our propor-
tions requiring medical treatment found.
Thus, future research should be conducted to corroborate our 
findings in other UK populations in order to assess the public 
health impact of dog bites and the significance of severity of 
injury. In particular, the causes and contexts of higher risk in 
owners of multiple dogs require further investigation and estab-
lishment of the repeatability and nature of the relationship 
between victim level of emotional stability/neuroticism and dog 
bite risk. Future studies should also investigate in more detail the 
contexts and situations regarding being bitten by familiar and 
unfamiliar dogs.48 Research is also required to estimate dog bite 
risk in under 5 
s, which our study did not address. Our study 
also did not address any factors associated with the type of dog 
at risk of biting, such as sex, age and breed, which require more 
investigation as findings have been inconclusive.49
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the most severe 
dog bites, of highest public health significance, are thankfully 
a small proportion of overall bites that occur. However, many 
more bites occur than present for treatment at a hospital and 
community level dog bite statistics such as those presented 
here are important to collect to validate our findings here. 
Unlike medical records-based studies, community survey data 
are likely to identify additional bites not requiring medical 
treatment and which are of unknown concern to the victim 
and whose public health significance is unclear. Further, this 
study has found that dog bite analysis based on hospital data 
does not always reflect the relationships seen when assessing 
population-based surveys. To better understand dog bites, 
future research should attempt to explore the circumstances 
of dog bites, the nature of the injury and victims’ perceptions 
and impacts on them. It is essential that previously assumed 
risk factors are reassessed as this study has revealed that prior 
beliefs, such as bites typically being from familiar dogs, are 
contested. Dog bite prevention initiatives may need to rebal-
ance their target to include strange dogs with equal impor-
tance, as opposed to an emphasis on family pets in the home. 
Our study confirms that male victims are at increased risk 
and should be targeted for prevention. Dog bite prevention 
schemes may also need to target particular behaviours around 
dogs by different victim personality types. If UK or elsewhere 
hope to reduce dog bite incidence, it is essential that risk 
factors are accurately assessed in order to impose effective and 
well-informed dog policies in the future.
What is already known on this subject
 
► Dog bites are a public health problem of unknown quantity.
 
► It is thought that people are more often bitten by familiar 
dogs.
 
► Males are at higher risk of dog bites.
What this study adds
 
► An estimate of approximately 19 dog bites per 1000 
population per year and only a very small proportion require 
hospital admission.
 
► Lower emotional stability may be a risk factor for having 
been bitten by a dog.
 
► Bites from unfamiliar dogs (55%) are common.
