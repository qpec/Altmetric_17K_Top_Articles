ABSTRACT
We describe a novel therapeutic approach for cirrhosis using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and
colony-stimulating factor-1-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (id-BMMs) and analyze the
mechanisms underlying fibrosis improvement and regeneration. Mouse MSCs and id-BMMs were
cultured from mouse bone marrow and their interactions analyzed in vitro. MSCs, id-BMMs, and a
combination therapy using MSCs and id-BMMs were administered to mice with CCl4-induced cir-
rhosis. Fibrosis regression, liver regeneration, and liver-migrating host cells were evaluated. Admin-
istered cell behavior was also tracked by intravital imaging. In coculture, MSCs induced switching
of id-BMMs toward the M2 phenotype with high phagocytic activity. In vivo, the combination ther-
apy reduced liver fibrosis (associated with increased matrix metalloproteinases expression),
increased hepatocyte proliferation (associated with increased hepatocyte growth factor, vascular
endothelial growth factor, and oncostatin M in the liver), and reduced blood levels of liver
enzymes, more effectively than MSCs or id-BMMs monotherapy. Intravital imaging showed that
after combination cell administration, a large number of id-BMMs, which phagocytosed hepatocyte
debris and were retained in the liver for more than 7 days, along with a few MSCs, the majority of
which were trapped in the lung, migrated to the fibrotic area in the liver. Host macrophages and
neutrophils infiltrated after combination therapy and contributed to liver fibrosis regression and
promoted regeneration along with administered cells. Indirect effector MSCs and direct effector id-
BMMs synergistically improved cirrhosis along with host cells in mice. These studies pave the way
for new treatments for cirrhosis. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2019;8:271–284
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Cirrhosis is a life-threatening condition. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic approaches
for liver fibrosis regression and regeneration is urgently needed. The authors focused on two
cell types; that is, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and colony-stimulating
factor-1-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (id-BMMs), previously reported to be
effective for cirrhosis, and showed that combination therapy with the two cell types synergisti-
cally improves liver function and fibrosis (over monotherapy with MSCs or id-BMMs), in part by
enhancing host endogenous regenerative responses. The authors also, for the first time, suc-
ceeded in tracing the detailed behavior of administered cells in the liver by intravital imaging
technology and believe that these studies pave the way for new treatments.
INTRODUCTION
Liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening condition
mediated by hepatocyte loss and accumulation
of excess extracellular matrix (ECM). Recently,
evidence from studies using antiviral therapy
indicated that liver fibrosis and function are
reversible. However, even after treatment, some
patients with decompensated cirrhosis progress
to irreversible end-stage liver disease [1–3].
Since 2003, autologous bone marrow cell
infusion therapy, which improves liver fibrosis and
induces liver regeneration, has been applied in
experimental clinical trials for cirrhosis [4]; how-
ever, many fundamental issues for cell therapy in
this context require further study. First, the most

 effective cells among the heterogeneous bone marrow cells
should be identified. Second, the detailed behavior of the adminis-
tered cells remains unknown. Third, the mechanisms underlying
liver fibrosis improvement and promotion of liver regeneration
has not been shown. Because cell therapy involves multiple fac-
tors, this leads to difficulty in analyzing mechanisms. In this study,
we focused on these unresolved points.
Macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
attracted attention as cells that improve liver fibrosis and pro-
mote regeneration in cirrhosis. Macrophages present diverse
phenotypes and plasticity [5], with two macrophage pheno-
types having been defined: “classically activated” (M1) and
“alternatively activated” (M2). Following liver injury, M1 mac-
rophages contribute to the induction of inflammation and for-
mation of fibrosis through activation of hepatic stellate cells
and myofibroblasts. In contrast, when liver injury stabilizes,
M2 macrophages contribute to the inactivation of inflamma-
tion and fibrosis regression [6]. Furthermore, macrophages
induce the differentiation and fate decision of hepatic stem/
progenitor cells by producing oncostatin M (OSM) and Wnt3A
[7, 8]. Macrophages derived from the bone marrow and cul-
tured with colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) induce regres-
sion of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice [9]. Here, the
phenotype of culture-induced macrophages was not polarized
as M1 or M2, and theoretically could polarize from M1 to M2
or vice versa in vivo [5]. The therapeutic effect of these CSF-
1-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (id-BMMs) in
cirrhotic mice is directly and indirectly mediated by (a) factors
related to fibrosis (matrix metalloproteinases; MMPs), (b) anti-
inflammatory molecules (IL-10), (c) chemoattractants (CCl2,
CXCL1, and CXCL2), and (d) proregeneration factors (OSM).
However, migration and engraftment of administered macro-
phages and their contribution to the phagocytosis of debris
and fibrosis regression in the liver has not been detected using
intravital imaging.
MSCs can expand easily and, after induction, can differen-
tiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes [10]. MSCs
represent a heterogeneous population that presents species-
dependent specific surface markers such as CD105 and CD73
[10]. MSCs secrete various cytokines, chemokines, and growth
factors as well as exosomes, which help tissue repair indirectly
and remotely [11]. Importantly, MSCs regulate trophic factors,
which indirectly mediate antiapoptosis, antioxidant, antifibro-
sis, angiogenic, and immunosuppressive effects [11]. Owing to
their multiple functions, ready expansion, and low antigenicity,
not only autologous but also allogeneic MSCs have been used
in more than 700 clinical trials in a variety of diseases. There
are approximately 50 trials using MSCs targeting chronic and
acute liver diseases.
The functions of macrophages and MSCs are clearly differ-
ent; however, both have therapeutic effects on cirrhosis. Thus,
we focused on the different characteristics of these cells; their
behavior in the body especially in the liver, and their interac-
tions and mechanisms supporting their effects on liver fibrosis
and liver function. We showed the differences and interactions
between id-BMMs and MSCs finding that combination therapy
using both id-BMMs and MSCs had synergistic effects includ-
ing effects on host cells compared with those of therapy using
each cell type alone in a mouse model of cirrhosis. Further-
more, we succeeded for the first time in tracing the detailed
behavior of id-BMMs and MSCs using intravital imaging with
two-photon excitation microscopy [12]. The detailed analysis
of the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSCs and
id-BMMs using intravital imaging of the liver is a new concept
in cell-based therapies directed at liver diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment
and kept under standard conditions with a 12-hour day/night
cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. All animal
experiments were conducted in compliance with regulations
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Committee
at the Niigata University and Osaka University. C57BL/6 male
mice were purchased from Charles River (Yokohama, Japan).
Green
fluorescent
protein
(GFP)-transgenic
mice
(Tg[CAG-
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)]C14-Y01-FM131Osb)
were kindly provided by Professor Masahito Ikawa, Osaka Univer-
sity. DsRed-transgenic mice (Tg[CAG-DsRedMST1]Nagy/J) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
Preparation of the Cirrhosis Mouse Model and Cell
Transplantation
Male mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 1.0 ml/kg
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; Wako, Osaka, Japan) to induce
cirrhosis. CCl4 was dissolved in corn oil (Wako) at 1:10 ratio. The
mice received CCl4 i.p. over a 12-week period, twice weekly. At
eight weeks, 1 × 106 MSCs (MSC100) or id-BMMs (id-BMM100),
or 5 × 105 MSCs and 5 × 105 id-BMMs (50/50; cells were mixed
immediately prior to injection) were injected into CCl4-induced
mice through the tail vein.
Intravital Imaging
For intravital imaging of the liver in mice, mice were anesthe-
tized with isoflurane, the median lobe of the liver was surgi-
cally exposed, and the internal surface was observed using
inverted two-photon excitation microscopy. The imaging sys-
tem was composed of a two-photon inverted microscope
(A1R-MP, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) driven by a laser (Chameleon
Vision Ti: Sapphire, Coherent) tuned to 880 nm, with a water
multi-immersion objective lens (Plan Fluor; N.A., 0.75; Nikon).
Fluorescence signals were detected through bandpass emis-
sion filters at 525/50 nm (for EGFP) and 575/25 nm (for
DsRed). Raw imaging data were processed using Imaris soft-
ware (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). To estimate the amount
of administered cells distributed in the liver, lung, and spleen,
the number of GFP-positive cells or DsRed-positive cells in
40 fields of each organ (1 field = 400 μm × 400 μm × 10 μm)
was counted, and this number was extrapolated for each
organ using the total volume of the organ. Based on the num-
ber of administered cells (1 × 106), the frequency of populat-
ing cells was calculated for each organ.
Cell Culture and MSC and id-BMM Isolation
For MSC and id-BMM isolation, 8- to 10-week-old male
C57BL6 mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and
their limbs were removed. Bone marrow precursors were
flushed from the medullary cavities of tibiae and femurs.
MSCs were cultured at 37�C, under 5% O2 and 5% CO2 in
specific dishes (Collagen Type I-Coated Microplate, Iwaki,

mouse; Stem Cell Technologies,Vancouver, BC, Canada) contain-
ing stimulatory supplements (MesenCult Stem Cell Stimulatory
Supplements, Mouse; Stem Cell Technologies), 0.1 μl/ml supple-
ments (MesenPure ×1,000, mouse; Stem Cell Technologies),
and 10 μg/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2; human FGF-2;
Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). MSCs were cul-
tured for 2 weeks with the medium changed twice weekly.
Approximately 2 × 106 MSCs were obtained from one mouse,
and cultured cells were administered without passage or used
to monitor the phenotype (Supporting Information Fig. S1).
The id-BMMs were cultured at 37�C under 5% CO2 in spe-
cific dishes (ultra-low attachment flasks; Corning, Armonk, NY)
and medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 media;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 20 ng/ml
CSF-1 (Recombinant Murine M-CSF; Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill,
NJ). The id-BMMs were cultured for 7 days with the medium
changed twice weekly. Approximately 5 × 106 id-BMMs were
obtained from one mouse, and cultured cells were adminis-
tered without passage or used to monitor the phenotype
(Supporting Information Fig. S1).
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a QuantiTect reverse
transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gene expression
analysis was achieved by using prevalidated QuantiTech
primers (Supporting Information Table S1) with QuantiTech
SYBR reagent (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was conducted by using
a Step One Plus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The results were obtained from at least three
separate samples. Gapdh was used as an internal control. The
fold change in relative gene expression from the control was
calculated by using the ΔΔCt method.
Immunostaining
For immunohistochemistry, 10% formalin-fixed tissue was cut
into 3-μm-thick sections. When necessary, heat-mediated anti-
gen retrieval was performed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer at
pH 6.0. For 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, sections were
blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
Primary
antibodies
(Supporting
Information
Table S2) were incubated overnight at 4�C. Species-specific
anti-IgG biotinylated antibodies were used for detection. Slides
were then stained using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laborato-
ries, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and DAB substrate (Muto Pure Che-
micals, Tokyo, Japan). Nuclei were stained using hematoxylin
(Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Photographs were acquired using an
HS all-in-one fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence,
Osaka, Japan).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism5
software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Data are presented as the
means � SD; all data analyzed were normally distributed. The
results were assessed using the Student’s t test. Differences
between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of vari-
ance. Differences were considered significant when p < .05.
Furthermore, description of the experimental procedures used
is provided in Supporting Information.
RESULTS
Cultured MSCs and id-BMMs Express a Variety of
Unique Factors and Show Altered Characteristics After
Addition of Serum from Mice with CCl4-Induced Liver
Damage
Before assessing the therapeutic effects of MSCs and id-BMMs
on cirrhosis in vivo, we performed a comprehensive analysis of
factors expressed by these two populations by microarray
(Supporting Information Fig. S2). We compared several factors
related to fibrosis (MMP tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease
[TIMP]), chemoattractants (C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 [CXCR4]
and stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]), proregeneration fac-
tors (OSM and hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]), inflammation/
anti-inflammation factors (IL-10 and IL-6), macrophage pheno-
type markers (INOS and YM-1), and others (PGE2 and TSG-6).
Cultured macrophages express many factors that affect cirrho-
sis treatment directly or indirectly [9]. In the present study, the
expression of factors related to fibrosis (MMP-8, -12, and -13),
chemoattractant factors (CXCR4), anti-inflammation factors (IL-
10), and proregenerative factors (OSM) was stronger in id-
BMMs than in MSCs, suggesting that id-BMMs play a pivotal
role in the improvement of liver fibrosis and regeneration. Cul-
tured MSCs expressed different factors from those of id-BMMs
such as the antifibrosis factor MMP-2 and the angiogenic factor
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We further evalu-
ated other factors related to immunomodulation, especially
those affecting macrophage polarization. PGE2, TSG-6, and IL-
13 are factors that change the macrophage phenotype toward
M2 and are secreted from MSCs only when MSCs are stimu-
lated by inflammatory stimuli. The mRNA expression of PGE2,
TSG-6, and IL-13 in simple cultured MSCs was not as strong as
previously reported [11].
MSCs and macrophages change their characteristics in
response to environmental signals. Furthermore, once MSCs
are stimulated by inflammatory stimuli, they produce factors
such as PGE2 and IL-13, thereby switching the macrophage
phenotype toward M2 [13]. Because the serum from mice
with CCl4-induced liver damage contains various factors, we
suspected that after injection into these mice, the character-
istics of both MSCs and id-BMMs would change. Thus, to
mimic the change in the characteristics of MSCs and id-
BMMs in vivo, cultured cells were incubated for 72 hours
with serum from mice with CCl4-induced liver damage and
changes in mRNA levels were analyzed in vitro. In MSCs, after
addition of serum, mRNA levels of the antifibrotic factor
MMP-13 (p < .001), the chemoattractant factor SDF-1
(p < .001), the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 (p < .001), the
M2 macrophage-inducing factors IL-13 (p < .001, and PGE2
(p = .021) were upregulated, whereas, the mRNA expression
of the metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP3 (p < .001) was
downregulated (Fig. 1A). In id-BMMs, which secreted a high

 macrophage markers YM-1 (p = .018) and FIZZ-1 (p < .001),
and the mannose receptor (MR; p < .001) was upregulated.
In contrast, mRNA expression of the M1 macrophage markers
IL-6 (p < .001), INOS (p = .029), and TNF-α (p < .001) was
downregulated (Fig. 1B), suggesting that trophic factors in
the serum changed the id-BMM characteristics toward the
M2 phenotype. These results revealed that both MSCs and
id-BMMs were affected by the serum from liver-damaged
mice and their characteristics were changed.
MSCs Change id-BMM Characteristics Toward M2
Macrophages, Which Gain High Phagocytic Activity
To further show the interaction between MSCs and id-BMMs
mediated by trophic factors, we cocultured MSCs and id-BMMs
in a noncontact transwell culture system. After 72 hours of cocul-
ture changes in mRNA expression in id-BMMs in the presence or
absence of MSCs and those in MSCs in the presence or absence
of id-BMMs were compared. In id-BMMs cultured in presence of

 (p < .001) MR (p = .001) and that of the antifibrosis factor MMP-
13 (p < .001) increased, whereas, that of the M1 macrophage
markers INOS (p < .001) TNF-α (p < .001) and IL-6 (p < .001)
decreased (Fig. 1C) suggesting that MSC trophic factors induced
a switch toward the M2 phenotype. In MSCs cultured in the
presence of id-BMMs, the expression of PGE2 (p < .001) and
TSG-6 (p < .001) that induced the switch toward the M2 macro-
phage phenotype (Fig. 1D) increased suggesting that id-BMM
trophic factors affected the characteristics of MSCs as M2 macro-
phage inducers. These results revealed that by utilizing MSCs,
the characteristics of id-BMMs were changed toward the M2
phenotype. Furthermore, to determine whether the phagocytic
activity of M2-polarized id-BMMs changed, we compared the
number of macrophages that phagocytosed fluorescent particles
(zymosan) between id-BMMs cultured in the presence and
absence of MSCs in vitro. The phagocytic activity in M2-polarized
id-BMMs was 1.23-fold stronger (p = .008) than that in nonpolar-
ized id-BMMs revealing that macrophages polarized toward the
M2 phenotype by MSCs had a higher phagocytic activity
(Supporting Information Fig. 3A, 3B).
Combination Therapy Using MSCs and id-BMMs
(50/50) Has a Stronger Therapeutic Effect in Cirrhotic
Mice than MSCs or id-BMMs Alone
Altogether, the results obtained in vitro suggested that combi-
nation therapy using MSCs and id-BMMs could improve liver
fibrosis and regeneration. To show the therapeutic effect of
MSCs and id-BMMs on cirrhosis, 1 × 106 MSCs (MSC 100),
1 × 106 id-BMMs (id-BMM 100), a combination of 5 × 105
MSCs and 5 × 105 id-BMMs (50/50; total 1 × 106 cells), or
phosphate buffered solution control were administered to cir-
rhotic mice (Fig. 2A). Four weeks after cell administration, Sir-
ius red staining indicated reduced liver fibrosis in the MSC100
(5.40%; p = .201), id-BMM100 (18.8%, p = .036), and 50/50
groups (27.3%; p = .002) compared with the control group.
However, the improvement of fibrosis was stronger in the
50/50 group than in the MSC100 and id-BMM100 groups
(Fig. 2B), and quantitative analysis of hydroxyproline, which is
the major component of collagen, also indicated reduced liver
fibrosis in the MSC100 (2.43%; p = .315), id-BMM100 (19.8%;
p = .006), and 50/50 groups (37.2%; p < .001) compared with
that in the control group (Fig. 2C). Decreased serum ALT levels
were observed in the id-BMM100 (p = .001) and 50/50 groups
(p < .001), whereas decreased serum ALP levels were observed
in all groups (MSC100; p = .036, id-BMM100; p = .029, 50/50;
p = .012), and serum levels of total bilirubin were decreased in
the id-BMM100 and 50/50 groups (id-BMM100; p = .014,
50/50; p = .016; Fig. 2D). These results revealed that combina-
tion therapy using MSCs and id-BMMs (50/50) had the stron-
gest therapeutic effect for improvement of liver fibrosis.
Combination Therapy Leads to Increased Expression of
Antifibrosis Markers Followed by Proregenerative Factors
To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the effects of combina-
tion therapy shortly after cell administration, liver tissue was ana-
lyzed 1, 3, and 7 days after cell administration. On day 28 after
cell injection, the mRNA changes in combination therapy group
were not significantly different compared with the no cell injec-
tion or monotherapy groups (data not shown). Regarding fibrosis-
related factors, Mmp8 (p < .001; day 3, compared with control),
Mmp9 (p < .001; day 3, compared with control), and Mmp13
(p < .001; day 3, compared with control) mRNA levels in the com-
bination therapy group were upregulated, whereas those of TIMP-
1 (p < .001; day 3, compared with control) and TIMP-3 (p < .001;
day 3, compared with control; antagonist of MMP) were markedly
downregulated at day 3 in the combination therapy group
(Fig. 3A). Regarding the proregenerative factors, mRNA levels of
HGF (p < .001; day 7, compared with control), OSM (p < .001; day
7, compared with control), and VEGF (p < .001; day 7, compared
with control), especially those of VEGF and OSM, were upregu-
lated in the combination therapy group at day 7 (Fig. 3B). We fur-
ther evaluated the regeneration of hepatocytes by liver weight
and body weight ratio (LW/BW) and proliferating cell nuclear anti-
gen (PCNA) staining. Although there was no significant difference
in LW/BW, the largest number of dividing hepatocytes were pre-
sent in the 50/50 group at day 7 (p = .001 compared with day
1, p = .003 compared with day 3; Fig. 3C). These results revealed
that after combination therapy, the expression of MMPs, which
are antifibrosis markers, increased, followed by an increase in pro-
regenerative factors, leading to liver regeneration.
A Large Number of id-BMMs and Few MSCs Migrate to
the Fibrotic Area in the Liver and Combination Therapy
Increases the Frequency of id-BMM Engraftment
Although combination therapy using MSCs and id-BMMs (50/50)
was the most effective for improvement of liver fibrosis and
regeneration, the behavior of each cell type and the mechanisms
underlying the effect of combination therapy needed to be
shown. We first evaluated the detailed behavior of the adminis-
tered cells using intravital imaging in mice with CCl4-induced liver
damage using two-photon excitation microscopy. Previous stud-
ies reported the engraftment of administered cells indirectly
using still images or an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) [14]. How-
ever, it was difficult to distinguish dead hepatocytes from the
administered cells using such techniques. Additionally, the
detailed area of cell engraftment and the behavior of the cells in
the engrafted area were not fully shown. Intravital imaging using
two-photon excitation microscopy overcame these problems.
The administered fluorescently labeled cells were able to be
distinguished from dead cells. Moreover, we confirmed their
location and behavior in the intravital tissue. Furthermore,
migration or phagocytosis in the specific area was observed by
intravital imaging. To detect administered cells, id-BMMs derived
from GFP knock-in mice and MSCs derived from DsRed knock-in
mice were administered to cirrhotic mice (Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S4). The liver, spleen, and lung were observed by using
two-photon excitation microscopy (liver, Fig. 4A; spleen and lung,
Supporting Information Fig. S5A), which enabled intravital cell
imaging of tissues at days 1, 3, and 7 after cell administration.
On day 28, most of the administered cells had disappeared (data
not shown). Among the cells administered, the majority of id-
BMMs migrated to the liver (42.6% � 5.5%), especially near the
fibrotic area, or to the lung (47.7% � 7.9%) from day 1 and they
remained for 7 days (Fig. 4B). In contrast, most administered
MSCs migrated to the lung (84.4% � 6.1%) and were rarely
detected in the liver and spleen at day 1 (6.2% � 2.0%). MSCs
gradually disappeared and were not detected in the liver, spleen,
and lung at day 7 after cell administration (Fig. 4C). Similar
results were observed when the mice received the combination
therapy. However, the frequency of migration of id-BMMs into
the liver was significantly higher (1.70-fold at day 1, 1.26-fold
at day 3, and 1.50-fold at day 7) than that in mice receiving

 id-BMM monotherapy (Supporting Information Fig. S5B). These
results, together with the results showing that MSCs changed
the polarity of macrophages toward M2 in coculture, suggest
that id-BMMs are the direct effectors against liver fibrosis and
induce liver regeneration, whereas MSCs are indirect modulators
that affect the behavior and characteristics of macrophages.

A New Combination Cell Therapy for Cirrhosis
 Administered id-BMMs Migrate to the Fibrotic Area in
the Liver and Phagocytose the Debris near the
Fibrotic Area
We showed that id-BMMs migrated to the liver and were
directly involved in the improvement of liver fibrosis and
regeneration. However, the behavior of injected id-BMMs in
the fibrotic area is unknown. Time-lapse intravital cell imaging
was performed by using two-photon excitation microscopy to
investigate the behavior of id-BMMs in the fibrotic area.
During the time-lapse intravital cell imaging, we succeeded in
recording the phagocytosis of hepatocyte debris by administer-
ing id-BMMs for the first time. The id-BMMs migrated and sur-
rounded the hepatocyte debris near the fibrotic area and
gradually phagocytosed the hepatocyte debris in 30 minutes
(Supporting Information Video S1 and Fig. 4D). Phagocytosing
macrophages change their characteristics [8]. Thus, to evaluate
the changes in id-BMM characteristics after phagocytosis of
debris, hepatocyte debris was added to macrophages cultured

 in vitro. Vegf and Osm mRNA levels increased after phagocyto-
sis, suggesting that the injected id-BMMs that phagocytose
hepatocyte debris promote liver regeneration (Vegf; 3.18-fold,
p < .001 and Osm; 4.25-fold, p < .001, compared with mRNA
levels before phagocytosis; Fig. 4E). Altogether, our results
suggest that the administered id-BMMs modulated by MSCs
present high phagocytic activity, which promotes the healing
of damaged tissues and liver regeneration.
Combination Therapy Induces the Migration of Host
Macrophages and Neutrophils to the Damaged Liver
Where these Host Cells Express Antifibrotic MMPs
During macrophage therapy, endogenous macrophages and neu-
trophils that migrate into the damaged liver contribute to
improve resolution of liver fibrosis [9]. From our in vivo intravital
imaging results, the therapeutic effect could not be solely
explained by direct effects of the injected cells. Thus, we next
investigated the contribution of host cells. The damaged liver
expresses the chemoattractant SDF-1 [15]. Moreover, our macro-
phages cultured with or without serum from mice with CCl4-
induced liver damage expressed high levels of chemoattractants
such as CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2, and CXCR4. Thus, we suspected that
the concentration of chemoattractants is high in the injured liver.
In addition, we evaluated the change of mRNA expression levels
of chemoattractants in the liver over time after cell administra-
tion, confirming that mRNA expression levels of CXCL1 (p < .001;
day 3, compared with control) and CXCL2 (p < .001; day 3, com-
pared with control), chemoattractants for neutrophils, in the
liver were upregulated in the 50/50 group. Cxcl2 mRNA expres-
sion was upregulated not only in the 50/50 group but also in the

 was higher than that in the control group, and the number of
these cells at day 3 in the 50/50 group was highest (1.61-fold
increase in macrophages; p < .001 and 5.30-fold increase in neu-
trophils; p < .001 in the 50/50 group compared with the control
group; Fig. 5A, 5B). Furthermore, to strengthen our findings, the
frequency of macrophages and neutrophils among whole blood
cells in the liver was analyzed by flow cytometry. The frequency
of F4/80+/CD11b+ cells, which was the macrophage population
showing a significant increase in the id-BMM100 and 50/50
groups compared with the control group, was highest in the
50/50 group (Fig. 6A; 1.56-fold increase in the id-BMM100
group; p < .001, 2.11-fold increase in the 50/50 group; p < .001,
compared with the control group). F4/80+/CD11b+ cells com-
prised host macrophages in the liver and administered id-BMMs
that migrated to the liver. Because the administered id-BMMs
expressed the GFP fluorescent protein, host macrophages (GFP-
negative cells) and administered id-BMMs (GFP-positive cells)
could be distinguished by FACS. The content of GFP-positive id-
BMMs was extremely low, suggesting that the increase in the
number of macrophages mainly resulted from the migration of
host macrophages. The frequency of Ly-6G+/CD11b+ cells, which
represent the neutrophil population [16], also increased signifi-
cantly in the id-BMM100 and 50/50 groups compared with that
in the control group, and was highest in the 50/50 group
(Fig. 6B; 1.62-fold increase in the id-BMM100 group; p = .004,
4.58-fold increase in the 50/50 group; p < .001 compared with
the control group). Our in vitro study confirmed that the interac-
tion between MSCs and id-BMMs resulted in a change in the
macrophage phenotype toward the M2 phenotype. Thus, we
investigated the polarization of macrophages in the liver after
cell administration by flow cytometry. The frequency of F4/80
+/CD11b+/CD206+
cells,
the
M2
macrophage
population,
increased in the MSC100 and 50/50 groups compared with that
in the control group (Supporting Information Fig. S7). Altogether,
our results indicate that after combination therapy with MSCs
and id-BMMs, host macrophages and neutrophils migrated to
the damaged liver, and the frequency of M2 macrophages
increased in the liver, resulting in an increase of Mmps as antifi-
brotic factors in the liver at day 3. Moreover, id-BMMs modu-
lated by MSCs had a high phagocytosis activity, which promoted
the healing of damaged tissues and liver regeneration at day
7 after cell administration.
DISCUSSION
MSCs and macrophages are effective for liver fibrosis regression
and regeneration. However, the differences in the characteristics
of these cells, their detailed behavior, and the mechanism under-
lying the improvement of liver fibrosis and the promotion of liver
regeneration have not been fully shown. This study demonstrates
that combination therapy using MSCs and id-BMMs synergisti-
cally improves liver fibrosis and regeneration. Furthermore, we
showed the behavior of MSCs and id-BMMs using intravital imag-
ing and partially showed the mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis
improvement and liver regeneration.
In vitro data in simple culture and serum-added culture
revealed that MSCs may not directly affect liver fibrosis regres-
sion and liver regeneration as strongly as id-BMMs. Based on
these in vitro experiments, in vivo studies were performed to
show the most effective cells and cell populations for the
treatment of cirrhosis. The therapeutic effect of MSCs alone
was relatively low confirming our in vitro data. However, the
combination therapy significantly improved liver fibrosis.
Next, we focused on the detailed behavior of MSCs and
id-BMMs after administration using intravital imaging. First, by
using two-photon excitation microscopy, we showed that
id-BMMs abundantly migrated to the liver, whereas MSCs rarely
migrated to the liver. Furthermore, we clearly detected the
engraftment of id-BMMs near the fibrotic area and distinguished
the id-BMMs from dead cells. Finally, we succeeded in capturing
the migrating and phagocytosing id-BMMs, which is difficult
using conventional methods such as immunohistochemistry and
IVIS [14]. Most of the administered MSCs migrated to the lung,
were rarely detected in the liver, and disappeared from the lung,
liver, and spleen by 7 days after cell administration. Given that
combination therapy greatly improved liver fibrosis and regener-
ation and that id-BMMs engrafted near the fibrotic area in the
liver, expressing antifibrosis factors, we speculated that MSCs, as
indirect effectors, and id-BMMs, as direct effectors, synergisti-
cally improved liver fibrosis and regeneration. We further specu-
lated that owing to the cell sizes of MSCs, they were trapped in
the lung, whereas macrophage migration to specific places in
particular organs was probably due to the actions of chemoat-
tractants and adhesion molecules. Nevertheless, these cells syn-
ergistically improved cirrhosis. The location and direction of MSC
effects on macrophages require further analyses.
Thus, in this study, we comprehensively analyzed the char-
acteristics and
relationship
of
MSCs
and id-BMMs.
We
assessed the relationship between MSCs and id-BMMs com-
prehensively. A recent report suggested that MSCs polarize
macrophages toward the M2 phenotype [13, 17, 18]. Thus, we
evaluated the interaction between MSCs and id-BMMs by
coculture in transwell dishes. The mRNA expression of PGE2
and TSG-6, which can polarize macrophages toward the M2
phenotype, was upregulated in MSCs after coculture, and id-
BMMs increasingly showed the M2 phenotype after coculture
with MSCs. These results suggest that by utilizing MSCs, the
characteristics of id-BMMs were changed toward the M2
phenotype.
Additionally, the phagocytic activity of M2-polarized id-
BMMs after coculture with MSCs increased. A change in the
expression of various factors is observed in macrophages after
phagocytosis [8]. In our id-BMMs, mRNA levels of proregen-
erative factors (OSM and VEGF) were upregulated after phago-
cytosis of hepatocyte debris, suggesting that liver regeneration
is accelerated after phagocytosis of hepatocytes by id-BMMs.
From these results, we considered that M2 polarization of
macrophages prior to injection, or drug treatment to induce
M2-polarized macrophages might represent strategies for
future cell therapies.
Finally, we determined whether host cells were recruited
to the damaged site during fibrosis regression and liver regen-
eration. id-BMMs express several chemoattractants to recruit
host macrophages and neutrophils [9]. Furthermore, the dam-
aged liver itself expresses chemoattractants such as SDF-1.
Thus, the host cells are likely involved the therapeutic effect.
In our study, after cell administration, especially after combina-
tion therapy, host macrophages and neutrophils migrated to
the damaged liver. These results revealed that the combina-
tion therapy triggered the migration of macrophages and neu-
trophils and their involvement in fibrosis regression and liver

A New Combination Cell Therapy for Cirrhosis
 regeneration. In addition, the polarization of macrophages in
the whole liver was analyzed after cell administration. After
combination therapy, the frequency of M2 macrophages,
including host and administered macrophages, increased in
the liver. Time-lapse changes in mRNA expression after cell
administration indicated the upregulation of antifibrotic fac-
tors such as MMPs followed by the upregulation of proregen-
erative factors such as OSM and VEGF, suggesting that fibrosis
regression occurs first, followed by liver regeneration. Alto-
gether, these results suggest that both cell types are necessary
to improve liver fibrosis and regeneration and that MSCs,
which contributed to therapy remotely and indirectly, and id-
BMMs, which contributed directly, acted together to synergis-
tically improve liver fibrosis and regeneration (Fig. 7).
The activities of MSCs, but not synergistic effects with id-
BMMs, have been previously reported. MSCs affect various
events in the fibrotic cascade, which represents a series of
processes leading to the production of ECM as follows: hepa-
tocyte injury, inflammation, activation of myofibroblasts, and
then ECM production. MSCs reduce hepatocyte damage
and liver injury [19], suppress inflammation in the liver [20],
and inhibit ECM production by inactivating hepatic stellate
cells [21]. Recently, it has been reported that milk fat globule-
EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) related to the inactivation of hepatic
stellate cells suppresses ECM production [21]. Because the
expression of this factor was high in the microarray analysis of
our MSCs, this mechanism may also affect the suppression of
liver fibrosis. In this manner, MSCs affected the fibrotic cas-
cade indirectly and suppressed fibrosis formation. In our study,
the majority of MSCs were trapped in the lung, in which
increased Il10 mRNA levels and decreased Il6 mRNA levels
were detected (data not shown). Thus, we speculate that
MSCs support a systemic anti-inflammatory state and help to
change host and administered macrophages to the M2
phenotype.
Limitations of our studies included our use of the
CCl4-induced cirrhosis model mouse, which differs from human
cirrhosis wherein excess fibrosis occurs over the long-term. Fur-
thermore, direct intra-arterial MSC injection to the liver per-
formed in some human clinical trials [22]. Our studies did not
show the effect of direct injection of the cell combination to
the liver.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our results indicate that MSCs indirectly affect the
improvement of liver fibrosis, whereas M2-polarized id-BMMs,
together with host macrophages and neutrophils, directly
improve liver fibrosis and regeneration. We consider that these
studies are important for future cell therapies. Our developed
studies of combination therapy might serve as an alternative
therapy and fulfill unmet needs for decompensated cirrhosis.
Because MSCs can be obtained from medical waste such as adi-
pose tissue, umbilical cord tissue, and dental pulp and exhibit
low antigenicity, they can be applied for allogeneic administra-
tion
on
demand
[22–25].
Furthermore,
recent
research
advances suggest the possibility of cell-free therapy. Notably,
MSCs express various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors
as well as exosomes, which assist with tissue repair both indi-
rectly and remotely [11]. Accordingly, some studies have
reported that only conditioned medium or exosomes provide
effects similar to those of cell therapies [26, 27]. Moreover,
because macrophages can be obtained from peripheral blood
using apheresis, it is possible to obtain a sufficient number of
macrophages repeatedly, although some adverse effects may
occur during apheresis of patients with cirrhosis [28, 29], and
owing to their antigenicity, allogeneic administration of macro-
phages may be difficult. Overall, combination therapy consti-
tutes a useful tool to show the mechanisms underlying liver
fibrosis regression and liver regeneration and paves the way to
develop future therapies for decompensated cirrhosis.
