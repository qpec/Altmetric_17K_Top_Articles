IMPORTANCE Previous epidemiologic research on concussions has primarily been limited to
patient populations presenting to sport concussion clinics or to emergency departments
(EDs) and to those high school age or older. By examining concussion visits across an entire
pediatric health care network, a better estimate of the scope of the problem can be obtained.
OBJECTIVE To comprehensively describe point of entry for children with concussion, overall
and by relevant factors including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and payor, to quantify where
children initially seek care for this injury.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this descriptive epidemiologic study, data were
collected from primary care, specialty care, ED, urgent care, and inpatient settings. The initial
concussion-related visit was selected and variation in the initial health care location (primary
care, specialty care, ED, or hospital) was examined in relation to relevant variables. All
patients aged 0 to 17 years who received their primary care from The Children’
s Hospital of
Philadelphia’
s (CHOP) network and had 1 or more in-person clinical visits for concussion in the
CHOP unified electronic health record (EHR) system (July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2014) were
selected.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of initial concussion visits at each type of health
care location. Concussion visits in the EHR were defined based on International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes indicative of concussion.
RESULTS A total of 8083 patients were included (median age, 13 years; interquartile range,
10-15 years). Overall, 81.9% (95% CI, 81.1%-82.8%; n = 6624) had their first visit at CHOP
within primary care, 5.2% (95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%; n = 418) within specialty care, and 11.7% (95%
CI, 11.0%-12.4%; n = 947) within the ED. Health care entry varied by age: 52% (191/368) of
children aged 0 to 4 years entered CHOP via the ED, whereas more than three-quarters of
those aged 5 to 17 years entered via primary care (5-11 years: 1995/2492; 12-14 years:
2415/2820; and 15-17 years: 2056/2403). Insurance status also influenced the pattern of
health care use, with more Medicaid patients using the ED for concussion care (478/1290
Medicaid patients [37%] used the ED vs 435/6652 private patients [7%] and 34/141 self-pay
patients [24%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest estimates of concussion incidence based
solely on ED visits underestimate the burden of injury, highlight the importance of the
primary care setting in concussion care management, and demonstrate the potential for EHR
systems to advance research in this area.

oncussion in youth has received heightened attention
owing to emerging evidence that this common injury
can affect academics and cause behavioral changes and
neurocognitivedeficitsinworkingmemory,concentration,pro-
cessing speed, and eye and motor function.1-3 Reported esti-
mates of the number of youth with concussion have in-
creased in recent years, likely owing in part to increased
involvementinyouthsports,introductionofreturn-to-playleg-
islation, and increased awareness of concussion by clini-
cians, parents, and youth themselves.1,4-6
Concussion diagnosis remains symptom-based and does
not require advanced diagnostic tools such as imaging.7 Thus,
unlike many other types of traumatic injuries, children with
concussion potentially enter the health care system through
a variety of portals, including primary care or specialty care
such as sports medicine or neurology, in addition to the emer-
gency department (ED) and urgent care. A previous study
highlighted the diversity of health care use for youth with con-
cussion and minor head injury based on private insurance
data, emphasizing the importance of primary care clinicians.8
However, pediatricians noted that they lack up-to-date con-
cussion training and/or resources needed for timely and
accurate diagnosis and ongoing case management.9 A more
complete understanding of the distribution of point of health
care entry for children with concussion is needed to guide both
healthcarenetworksandclinicianswheretargetedtrainingand
resources need to be deployed.
In addition, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report high-
lighted the lack of data on concussions treated outside the ED
setting or sustained outside organized high school or colle-
giateathletics.1,10-12Prioreffortshaveeitherfocusedonasingle
sport, used EDs as the sole site of identification, or studied a
broader spectrum of head injury.13-22 In response to the IOM
report, several initiatives are under way that are attempting
to better estimate youth concussion incidence. To give guid-
ance as to the needed breadth of those efforts and to identify
locations in the health care system that need to be skilled in
concussion diagnosis and initial management, we leveraged
the linked electronic health record (EHR) system at The Chil-
dren’
s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to comprehensively de-
scribe point of entry into a large, regional, pediatric health care
network for CHOP primary care patients who sustained con-
cussions from July 2010 through June 2014; distributions were
assessed over time across broad age, demographic, and socio-
economic characteristics.
Methods
Description of CHOP Network
The CHOP network encompasses more than 50 locations
throughout southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jer-
sey, including 31 primary care centers, 14 specialty care cen-
ters, a 535-bed inpatient hospital, 2 EDs, and 2 urgent care cen-
ters supporting more than 1 million visits annually. The CHOP
network serves a socioeconomically and racially/ethnically di-
verse population and accepts most insurance plans, includ-
ing Medicaid. In addition to primary care clinicians, sports
medicine, neurology, and trauma care clinicians at CHOP
evaluate and manage concussions using a linked EHR system
(EpicCare; Epic Systems Inc). The EHR is used for all aspects
of clinical care, from inpatient to outpatient settings, as well
as initial and follow-up office visits.
This study was reviewed and approved by the CHOP in-
stitutional review board. Consent was waived because the re-
search was limited to existing data and involved no more than
minimal risk to the patient, and the research could not be prac-
ticably carried out without the waiver.
Case Identification
We queried CHOP’
s EHR database to identify all CHOP pri-
mary care patients who were aged 0 to 17 years and who had
an initial in-person medical visit at CHOP related to concus-
sion from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2014. Concussion
visits were defined as those assigned an International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code indicative of concussion (Table 1).
Primary care patients were identified as those with at least 1
primary care visit to a CHOP primary care network location
during the study period; the study was limited to patients
whose primary care is normally delivered by the CHOP net-
work because we expect the distribution of entry locations
for this group to be a more accurate representation of
patient behavior in using the CHOP health care system for
concussion than all patients of the CHOP health care net-
work. Initial visits were defined as the first clinical encoun-
ter for a concussion as determined by date and time of the
encounter. Because we could not separate multiple concus-
sions that may have been sustained by an individual patient
owing to limitations of CHOP’
s EHR system, each patient
was counted only once in analyses.
Given that the focus of this analysis was on patients whose
concussion was their only traumatic brain injury, as well as to
minimize concussion misclassification, we excluded pa-
tients who were also assigned an ICD-9-CM code for a more se-
vere traumatic brain injury (codes included the following key
words/phrases: contusion, laceration, subarachnoid, subdu-
ral, epidural, other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage,
andmoderateorprolongedlossofconsciousness)within2weeks

Key Points
Question Across a broad health care network, where do children
initially seek health care for concussion?
Findings In this descriptive epidemiology study, 82% of patients
sought initial care for concussion with primary care and only 12%
within the emergency department. Younger children and those
insured by Medicaid were more likely to use the emergency
department as their initial point of health care entry.
Meaning Efforts to measure the incidence of concussion cannot
solely be based on emergency department visits, and primary care
clinicians must be trained in concussion diagnosis and
management.

brain were excluded (n = 298); this was assessed by identify-
ingICD-9-CMcodescorrespondingtootherinjuriesonthesame
day as the initial concussion visit. Last, patients who were re-
ceiving ongoing concussion treatment during the study pe-
riod but whose initial concussion visit occurred prior to July
1, 2010, were excluded (n = 121).
Variable Definitions
Potential points of entry within the CHOP health care net-
work included (1) 1 of the primary care network offices; (2) out-
patient specialty care, including orthopedics/sports medi-
cine, trauma, and neurology; (3) 1 of 2 EDs or 2 urgent care
centers; and (4) direct admission to the hospital. Race/
ethnicity, sex, age, and payor (Medicaid, private, vs self-pay)
at time of initial concussion visit were ascertained from the
EHR.
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of initial concussion visit location was de-
scribed by age, sex, payor, and race/ethnicity; Wald 95% CIs
based on a normal approximation to the binomial distribu-
tion were calculated using the surveyfreq procedure in SAS.
In addition, during May and June 2012, extensive training was
provided to CHOP primary care clinicians on the current stan-
dard of care and approach for diagnosing and managing con-
cussions. Therefore, analyses were conducted looking both at
the overall 4-year period, as well as stratified by date of initial
concussion visit: July 2010 to June 2012 and July 2012 to June
2014. All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (SAS In-
stitute Inc).
Results
A total of 8083 children aged 17 years and younger had an ini-
tial in-person clinical visit for concussion (without a more se-
vere head injury or other clinically significant injury) within
the CHOP network during the 4-year study period. The fre-
quency and proportion of relevant characteristics at the time
of initial concussion visit are shown in Table 2. The median age
of patients was 13 years (interquartile range, 10-15 years); 4.6%
(n = 368) were aged 0 to 4 years, 30.8% (n = 2492) were aged
5 to 11 years, 34.9% (n = 2820) were aged 12 to 14 years, and
29.7% (n = 2403) were aged 15 to 17 years. Most were non-
Hispanic white (n = 5729; 70.9%) and had private insurance
(n = 6652;82.3%).Almosttwo-thirdsofallvisitsoccurredfrom
July 2012 to June 2014 (n = 5026).
Overall, 81.9% (95% CI, 81.1%-82.8%; n = 6624) of pa-
tients had their first concussion visit at CHOP within primary
care, 5.2% (95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%; n = 418) within specialty care,
11.7% (95% CI, 11.0%-12.4%; n = 947) within the ED, and 1.2%

(95% CI, 0.9%-1.4%; n = 94) direct admit to the hospital
(Table 3). The proportion of CHOP primary care patients who
sought care at their primary care office increased 13% be-
tween July to September 2010 and April to June 2014 (72.4%,
184/254 to 81.7%, 503/616), while the proportion seeking care
at the ED decreased 16% over the same period (15.4%, 39/254
to 13.0%, 80/616) (Figure).
Table 3 illustrates the distribution of health care entry lo-
cation by age, sex, race/ethnicity, payor, and period. Location
of entry varied significantly by age. More than half of chil-
dren aged 0 to 4 years entered the CHOP network via the ED
(51.9%; 95% CI, 46.8%-57.0%; 191/368), a significantly higher
proportion than for older children (14.9% [371/2492] of those
aged5-11years[95%CI,13.5%-16.3%];7.9%[222/2820]ofthose
aged 12-14 years [95% CI, 6.9%-8.9%]; and 6.8% [163/2403] of
those aged 15-17 years [95% CI, 5.8%-7.8%]). Conversely, more
than three-quarters of those aged 5 to 17 years (5-11 years: 1995/
2492; 12-14 years: 2415/2820; and 15-17 years: 2056/2403) ini-
tially sought care at CHOP via primary care. There were also
important differences by race/ethnicity and payor: 42.4% (95%
CI, 39.8%-45.0%; 586/1383) of non-Hispanic black patients en-
teredviatheEDcomparedwith4.9%(95%CI,4.3%-5.4%;280/
5729) of non-Hispanic white patients. Similarly, 37.1% (95% CI,
34.4%-39.7%; 478/1290) of children insured by Medicaid and
24.1% (95% CI, 17.1%-31.2%; 34/141) who were self-pay en-
tered through the ED compared with 6.5% (95% CI, 5.9%-
7.1%; 435/6652) with private insurance.
Discussion
While our understanding of concussion as an important pub-
lic health issue among children has grown tremendously over
the last decade, as highlighted in a recent IOM report,1 the epi-
demiology of youth concussion has been limited primarily to
those who are high school age or older, participate in orga-
nized sports, and/or are treated in EDs. In this study, we lev-
eraged the strength of a linked EHR system throughout a large
health care network to provide a comprehensive description
of the point of health care entry specific for pediatric concus-
sion across the developmental age spectrum—the first such US
assessment to include a diverse demographic and socioeco-
nomic sample. By doing so, we discovered important insights
into the variations in point of entry by age, payor, and race/
ethnicity that will provide guidance to the future develop-
ment of youth concussion surveillance systems being de-
signedtoprovidenationalincidenceestimates.Inaddition,our
results highlighted the potential of EHR systems to facilitate
research in this field.
First,thefindingsconfirmedthatconcussionsoccuramong
children of all ages: approximately one-third of patients (2860/
8083) were younger than 12 years. In contrast, most pediatric
concussion research has focused on youth of high school age,
resultinginlimitedknowledgeaboutthenaturalhistoryofcon-
cussion in a middle or elementary school population.23 Ow-
ing to the evolving neuropsychology and neurophysiology
across the pediatric age range, it is likely that children mani-
fest concussion symptoms differently across the age
continuum.24 Our findings underscore the critical need for fu-
ture research ensuring validated, age-appropriate diagnostic
and treatment strategies are available across the entire pedi-
atric age range.
Second, our results illustrate that more than three-
fourths of the patients (6624/8083) had their first concussion
visit within the CHOP network with primary care and just over
10% (947/8083) within the ED, suggesting that concussion es-
timates based solely on ED visits likely substantially underes-
timatethetrueincidenceofthisinjuryinchildren.Astudylink-
ingmultiplepopulation-basedhealthadministrationdatabases
in Canada25 and a study using data on private insurance claims
in Massachusetts8 documented a similar increase over time in
concussions and minor head injuries treated during office vis-
its (eg, primary care and specialty care) compared with treat-
ment within EDs. Our study uniquely extends these findings
in 2 ways. First, we used a stricter definition of concussion by
excluding minor head injuries that were not diagnosed as con-
cussions. More importantly, by capturing cases across broad
demographicsandsocioeconomicsthroughoutanentirehealth
care network, we identified important variations in health care
use by insurance payor and other demographic subgroups.
Ourresultshighlightthecriticalimportanceofprimarycare
clinicians in concussion care. This may be driven in part by in-
surance reasons or the fact that patients can often be sched-
uled for office appointments in the primary care setting sooner
and at lesser expense than in specialty care or the ED. Regard-
lessofthereason,thesedataprovidecriticalguidancetohealth
care networks, alerting them that the primary care setting is
increasingly being used for concussion care and those clini-
cians may be in need of augmented training or increased re-
sources. For primary care clinicians, these data provide evi-
dence they can use to advocate for concussion clinical decision
support tools in their health care system. Because special-
ized equipment is currently not needed for diagnosis, pri-
mary care clinicians can be well positioned to provide the ini-
tial evaluation for most patients with concussion. In some
geographic areas, they may be the only available clinical
resource. Preliminary findings suggest that primary care cli-
nicians can in fact provide quality care to children with
concussion.26Thecarepartnershipbetweenspecialistsandpri-
mary care that has occurred in the diagnosis and treatment of
pediatric mental health disorders, such as attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, suggests there are models for success-
ful clinical collaboration.
We also observed important variations in health care use
among different subgroups. Children younger than 5 years old
were more likely than older children to have the ED as their
initial point of entry into the CHOP system for concussion. This
aligns with previous research describing high rates of ED use
for injuries in younger children.27 Concussion is challenging
to diagnose in infants and toddlers as they are often unable to
reliably relay their symptoms to the clinician, which may make
their parents more likely to seek ED care for more urgent evalu-
ation and concern for more serious brain injuries. Others have
noted that ED use can be influenced by parental understand-
ing of the primary care clinician as a comprehensive source of
care,28 parental anxiety during the relatively high-stress pe-

riod of infancy,29 or misperceptions of illness/injury severity.30
Our findings suggest the need for specialized training for con-
cussion diagnosis and/or development of special screening
tools in EDs for this difficult-to-diagnose population. These as-
sessments may need to be age modified as evidence suggests
different symptom constellations among pediatric age
groups.24 Enhancement of the triage process that occurs in
most primary care settings via telephone nurse triage may
be advantageous in reassuring parents that many instances
of minor head trauma, even in the very young, can be ap-
propriately managed by primary care. Future work might
focus on delineation of concussion characteristics in this
youngest age group aimed at providing the foundation for
these interventions.
Patterns of health care entry point also varied by payor and
race/ethnicity, a finding congruent with previous research
related to pediatric injuries in general.27,31 Patients with
Medicaid were disproportionately more likely to use the ED
setting as an initial point of entry into the CHOP network for
concussion, as were non-Hispanic black patients. This may
be owing to the fact that specific state-level Medicaid provi-
sions may direct the patient where they can seek care, or it
may be owing to existing beliefs as to the appropriateness of
the ED for injury care for particular demographic sub-
groups. This suggests that concussion epidemiology based
on ED records may overestimate the incidence of concus-
sion among these groups and underestimate the incidence
among other groups.
There were several limitations of this study. First, inher-
ent to the use of a single health care network’
s EHR system as
a data source is the fact that visits outside that network are not
included. Some patients may have had a prior visit at a com-
munity ED or non-CHOP provider before seeking care at CHOP
and, therefore, this analysis may not fully characterize the
health care use of a well-defined underlying population. To ex-
plore the extent of this limitation, we conducted sensitivity
analyses that limited the sample only to patients of primary
care practices that were within 20 miles driving distance from
the CHOP ED as these might be more likely to use the CHOP
ED rather than another community ED. Despite being more
likely to be minority and receiving Medicaid than the entire
sample, 69% of these patients first sought care at their pri-
mary care office, reinforcing our primary findings. Previous
analyses indicated that the CHOP primary care population is
similar in key demographic variables to the Philadelphia met-
ropolitan area32 and likely is representative of the general pa-
tient population in the Mid-Atlantic region. Second, this as-
sessment did not take into account those who did not seek care
for their concussion, either because they did not recognize or
want to disclose their symptoms or because their family did
not perceive their injury required medical care. As high-
lightedbytheIOM,this“cultureofresistance”isprevalentand,
although not the focus of this analysis, is a significant soci-
etal issue in need of further study. Third, only the initial CHOP
visit for the first concussion occurring during the study pe-
riod was identified for each patient. Certainly, some propor-
tion of patients experienced multiple concussions during the
study period. Unfortunately, the EHR was not set up to sys-
tematically separate multiple concussions within a given pa-
tient’
s record. To estimate the extent to which we underesti-
mated the number of unique concussions, we selected 3% of
concussion patients (n = 218) for manual medical record re-
view;werandomlyselectedpatientswithinstratabasedonthe
number of concussion visits and the length of time between
the first and last visits; patients with more visits and a longer
time between the first and last visits were more likely to be se-
lected. Based on this review, we estimated that 16% of our pa-
tients (1289/8083) sought treatment for more than 1 concus-
sion during the study period, indicating that we likely
underestimatedthetruenumberofuniqueconcussionsbythat
percentage over the 4-year period. A more complete assess-
ment of the patterns of health care use for the entire course of
care, including subsequent concussions, is under way to
complement the analyses contained herein. Last, it is impor-
tant to note that these analyses were conducted on patients
with a primary care clinician; the distribution of health care
location initially used for concussion may be different in those
without a primary care clinician.

Conclusions
In summary, using a novel method to leverage rich data cap-
tured in a unified EHR system on a diverse demographic and
socioeconomic population, this study suggests that incidence
estimates of pediatric concussion that rely solely on ED rec-
ords substantially underestimate the true incidence of this in-
jury. Most pediatric patients with concussion sought their ini-
tial concussion care within the CHOP network with a primary
care clinician, illustrating the need to provide up-to-date train-
ing and clinical decision support tools to these clinicians. Im-
portant variations in the point of health care entry by age, race/
ethnicity, and payor also suggest the accuracy of incidence
estimates based on a single point of health care entry may vary

geted interventions to improve recognition and management

agement of this common childhood injury.
