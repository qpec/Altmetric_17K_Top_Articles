Background: Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence
to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics
for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.
Methods: Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included
at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands, and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment
strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary
endpoints were readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection
and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.
Results: A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days for the
observational and 12 (7–30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery
of 0⋅91 (lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅78; P = 0⋅151). No significant differences between
the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated
diverticulitis (3⋅8 versus 2⋅6 per cent respectively; P = 0⋅377), ongoing diverticulitis (7⋅3 versus 4⋅1 per
cent; P = 0⋅183), recurrent diverticulitis (3⋅4 versus 3⋅0 per cent; P = 0⋅494), sigmoid resection (3⋅8 versus
2⋅3 per cent; P = 0⋅323), readmission (17⋅6 versus 12⋅0 per cent; P = 0⋅148), adverse events (48⋅5 versus
54⋅5 per cent; P = 0⋅221) and mortality (1⋅1 versus 0⋅4 per cent; P = 0⋅432). Hospital stay was significantly
shorter in the observation group (2 versus 3 days; P = 0⋅006). Per-protocol analyses were concordant with
the intention-to-treat analyses.
Conclusion: Observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and can be con-
sidered appropriate in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Registration number: NCT01111253

Introduction
The natural history of acute diverticulitis is mild and
most patients are treated successfully by conservative
measures1–4. It is uncertain, however, whether antibiotics
are necessary in uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. T
wo
retrospective comparative studies5,
6 and one random-
ized trial7, which included about 40 per cent recurrent
diverticulitis, have compared observational and antibiotic
treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticuli-
tis. These studies have suggested that antibiotic treatment
is not more successful than observational treatment. Most
international guidelines remained unchanged and still
recommend antibiotics8–10. Whether or not antibiotics
are used varies between countries and disciplines11–13. In
a recent review14 it was stressed that further high-quality
RCT
s are required for the decision on antibiotics.

Importantly, antibiotic treatment is accompanied by sev-
eral drawbacks. Besides costs, there are the risks of adverse
effects and allergic reactions. Escalating antimicrobial
resistance owing to antibiotic overuse is a global threat
that is already being addressed in several fields in clinical
medicine15. This pragmatic randomized trial tested the
effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a
first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis.
Methods
The DIABOLO (DIverticulitis: AntiBiotics Or cLose
Observation?) trial was a multicentre (22 clinical sites),
open-label, pragmatic, RCT of two strategies in patients
with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis16. The study
design reflects clinical practice in which the two studied
approaches co-exist as standards of care.
This trial was conducted in accordance with the Decla-
ration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines
(ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01111253;
EudraCT
number
2009-015004-26). The institutional review board (IRB)
and Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving
Human Subjects approved the study protocol16. An inde-
pendent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
evaluated the progress and safety of the trial at regular
intervals. All serious adverse events were reported to
the DSMB and IRB. An endpoint assessment committee
adjudicated primary and main secondary endpoints.
Setting and participants
Patients were eligible if they had a first episode of
left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis, confirmed
within 24 h by CT. Only modified Hinchey stages 1a–b
(abscess size up to 5 cm) and Ambrosetti’
s ‘
mild’ diver-
ticulitis stage were included17,
18. Main exclusion criteria
were previous radiologically proven diverticulitis, higher
modified Hinchey stages or Ambrosetti’
s ‘
severe’divertic-
ulitis stage plus sepsis as defined by the American College
of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine19,
and antibiotic use in the previous 4 weeks (Table 1). All
participants provided written informed consent.
Randomization and interventions
Participants were assigned randomly to either an observa-
tional or antibiotic treatment strategy. Randomization was
controlled centrally using a computerized system, with a
random varying block size of two or four patients, strati-
fied by Hinchey classification and centre. The procedure
took place in the participating centres after all inclusion

Antibiotic use in the 4 weeks before inclusion
and exclusion criteria had been verified, and entered in the
standardized secured web-based form. The outcome was
generated automatically, thereby preserving concealment
of the upcoming allocation sequence. Outcome assessors
and investigators analysing data were masked to the alloca-
tion until analyses were finished.
Based on the practice guidelines of the Dutch Antibiotic
Policy Committee and the American Society of Colon and
Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was
chosen as broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment20,
21. The
regimen consisted of a 10-day course, with intravenous
administration of 1200 mg four times daily for at least 48 h,
after which the route could be switched, if tolerated, to
oral administration of 625 mg three times daily. In the
event of allergy, a switch was made to the combination of
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
With the antibiotic treatment strategy, the use of anti-
biotics led to admission of all patients on the premise that

treatment was started intravenously. Patients allocated
to observational treatment could be treated directly in
an outpatient setting when the following criteria were
met: toleration of a normal diet (solid food and more
than 1 litre oral fluids), temperature less than 38∘C,
pain score measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS)
below 4 (with paracetamol at the most), capable of
self-support at same level as before illness, and patient
acceptance.
In both strategies, CT was repeated in the event of clin-
ical deterioration. In the observation group, deterioration,
proven subsequent complicated diverticulitis or another
infectious focus dictated starting antibiotics. Start criteria
were: temperature above 39∘C, positive blood cultures and
sepsis19. Patients were discharged if they fulfilled above-
mentioned criteria.
Outcomes and follow-up
The primary outcome was time to recovery during
6 months of follow-up. Full recovery was defined by meet-
ing the following criteria: discharge from hospital, normal
diet, temperature less than 38∘C, VAS pain score below
4 (with no use of daily pain medication), and resump-
tion of preillness working activities as assessed by a daily
patient diary.
Secondary outcomes were: days spent outside hospital in
the 6-month period, readmission rate, occurrence of com-
plicated diverticulitis (abscess, perforation, obstruction/
stricture, diverticular bleeding or fistula), ongoing diver-
ticulitis and acute diverticulitis recurrence, need for sig-
moid resection or other (non-)surgical intervention within
6 and 12 months of follow-up, (serious) adverse events,
side-effects of initial antibiotic treatment and all-cause
mortality.
Details of the patients’ adherence to the antibiotic
regimen were obtained by telephone. At 2 and 6 months,
the patient visited the outpatient clinic; follow-up at
12 and 24 months was by telephone. A standard case
record form was used for collection of study variables.
Oracle® Clinical, with internet-based remote data cap-
ture version 4.5.3 (Oracle, Redwood Shores, California,
USA), was used for entering, managing and validating
data.

Statistical analysis
A post hoc power analysis was performed to detect a
difference in time to recovery of more than 5 days between
observational treatment and antibiotic treatment within
a follow-up period of 180 days. This analysis replaced
the originally published sample size calculation, mainly
because the observed median time to recovery following
antibiotic treatment as the reference strategy was consid-
erably shorter than that anticipated at the time of study
design16. Furthermore, the published sample size calcu-
lation was inaccurate (by reporting 21 days to recovery as
the reference case where it should have been 19 days). In
addition, the hazard ratio of recovery corresponding to a
non-inferiority margin of 5 days or less has been spelled
out here.
With at least 262 patients observed in each group based
on intention to treat and a one-sided 0⋅05 significance
level, an exponential maximum likelihood test of equality of
time-to-recovery curves had more than 99 per cent power
to detect a difference between a recovery rate under obser-
vational treatment of 0⋅0408 and a recovery rate under
antibiotic treatment of 0⋅0578 (constant hazard ratio of
recovery 0⋅706) within a follow-up period of 180 days.
The hazard ratio of full recovery below 0⋅706 corresponds
to a difference between a median above 17 days to recov-
ery in the observational treatment group and the observed
median of 12 days to recovery in the antibiotic group. With
at least 255 patients in each group based on a per-protocol
approach, the test had a power of 98 per cent.
The target sample size of 528 evaluable patients in the
original protocol was achieved after extension of the accrual
period to October 2012 following the recommendation
of the DSMB to compensate for a higher drop-out rate
than the 1 per cent initially anticipated, owing to incorrect
inclusions (Table S1, supporting information).
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.
Continuous variables are expressed as median (i.q.r.) as
these data are not normally distributed, with analysis
using Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were
compared by means of χ2 test, Fisher’
s exact test or
linear-by-linear association, as appropriate.
For the primary outcome, Kaplan–Meier time-to-
recovery curves were plotted and median (i.q.r.) times
reported. A Cox proportional hazards regression was used
to obtain hazard ratios for the observational treatment
strategy compared with the antibiotic strategy, without
and with adjustment for Hinchey classification and centre.

 Observation versus antibiotics for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis
Subgroup analyses were performed to assess differences
within Hinchey classes and centres. For each model,
the Cox proportional hazards assumption was tested by
inspecting the log–log plots visually, with no deviations
detected. The lower limit of the one-sided 95 per cent
confidence interval for the hazard ratio was calculated
using the lower limit of the two-sided 90 per cent c.i.22.
Supplementary analyses and considerations relating to log
rank testing and on ignoring censored observations in the
present data set are provided in Appendix S1 (supporting
information). The difference in VAS scores between the
groups was assessed using the area under the curve and,
given the normal distribution, tested using a Student’
s
t test.
Prespecified subgroup analyses for the main secondary
endpoints and per-protocol analyses were carried out.
Multiple testing adjustment was done by using the
Benjamini–Hochberg method to control for the false
discovery rate. P < 0⋅050 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS®
version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and adjust-
ment for multiple testing was done in R version 2.13.1 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
From 1 June 2010 to 14 October 2012, 893 consecu-
tive patients with diverticulitis were screened at surgi-
cal and gastroenterological departments in 22 Dutch cen-
tres (Fig. 1)23. Some 323 patients were excluded (Table S2,
supporting information) and the remaining 570 patients
were assigned randomly to observational (283) or anti-
biotic (287) treatment. Of these, 39 patients were wrongly
included and were not eligible to participate (Table S3,
supporting information). Primary analyses included 528
patients (Table S4, supporting information). Clinical char-
acteristics of patients who underwent randomization were
mostly similar to those of patients who were eligible but not
randomized because they declined participation (Table S5,
supporting information)
Baseline characteristics were distributed evenly, though
ASA fitness grade was somewhat higher in the antibiotic
group (P = 0⋅036) (Table 2). VAS scores declined rapidly
in both groups within the 10 days from time of admission
(Fig. 2) and there were no significant differences in VAS
pain score over time (P = 0⋅379). The rate of positive blood
cultures did not differ significantly: 5⋅9 per cent in the
observation versus 2⋅8 per cent in the antibiotic group
(P = 0⋅285). Bacterial resistance was noted twice: in one
culture to penicillin and clindamycin, and in another to
metronidazole. T

Study treatment
All except one patient allocated to antibiotic treat-
ment (265 of 266, 99⋅6 per cent) started antibiotics,
with a median interval of 0 days from randomization.
Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was the most prescribed
antibiotic (250 of 265, 94⋅3 per cent) (Table S6, support-
ing information). The median duration was 10⋅0 (i.q.r.
10⋅0–10⋅0) days and 94⋅7 per cent (252 of 266) completed
the 10-day treatment course. In three patients (1⋅1 per
cent) antibiotics were discontinued because of side-effects
or allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock in
one patient. Antibiotics were discontinued incorrectly in
11 patients (4⋅1 per cent of 266) assigned to antibiotic
treatment (Table S7, supporting information).
Time to recovery
The median time to recovery during 6 months’follow-up
was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days for patients who had observa-
tional treatment versus 12 (7–30) days among those in
the antibiotic treatment group. An observational treatment

disease. a P = 0⋅151, b P = 0⋅081 (1-sided P values for hazard ratio determined by Cox regression analysis)
was associated with a hazard ratio for full recovery of 0⋅91
(lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅78; P = 0⋅151)
(Fig. 3a). The hazard ratio was not affected by adjustment
for Hinchey classification and centre (hazard ratio 0⋅90,
lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅77; P = 0⋅118).
Within the Hinchey 1a subgroup, with a median time to
recovery of 14 (6–35) in the observational and 12 (6–28)
days in the antibiotic group, the hazard ratio for recov-
ery was 0⋅88 (lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅75;
P = 0⋅081) (Fig. 3b).
Secondary outcomes
Within 6 months, 234 patients (89⋅3 per cent) in the obser-
vation group and 248 (93⋅2 per cent) in the antibiotic group
fulfilled the recovery criteria (P = 0⋅183). In the observa-
tion group more patients were treated as outpatients after
evaluation in the emergency department (13⋅0 versus 0⋅4
per cent; P = 0⋅006), and median duration of initial hospital
stay was shorter owing to the intravenous administration
of antibiotics in the antibiotic group (2 versus 3 days;
P = 0⋅006) (Table 3). Readmission rates were comparable;
17⋅6 per cent in the observation versus 12⋅0 per cent in
the antibiotic group (P = 0⋅148). Of the 34 patients in the
observation group treated as outpatients, 32 were never
admitted within the first 6 weeks after randomization.
The number of days spent outside the hospital, expressed
as proportion of the follow-up duration of 180 days,
was higher in the observation group (0⋅989 versus 0⋅983;
P = 0⋅00); however, this difference may not be of clinical
significance.
Complicated
diverticulitis
rates
during
6 months’
follow-up were comparable: 3⋅8 per cent in the observation
versus 2⋅6 per cent in the antibiotic group (P = 0⋅377). The
proportion of patients whose disease progressed to compli-
cated diverticulitis during the initial admission was small
(1⋅1 and 2⋅3 per cent respectively; P = 0⋅390). Ongoing
diverticulitis was noted in 19 patients (7⋅3 per cent) in the
observation group and 11 (4⋅1 per cent) in the antibiotic
group (P = 0⋅183). The proportion of patients with recur-
rent diverticulitis was similar in the two groups (3⋅4 versus
3⋅0 per cent; P = 0⋅494). Rates of sigmoid resection were
comparable (3⋅8 versus 2⋅3 per cent; P = 0⋅323), for both
emergency resection (0⋅8 versus 1⋅1 per cent; P = 0⋅553)
and elective resection (3⋅1 versus 1⋅1 per cent; P = 0⋅254).
In both groups the most common reason for sigmoid
resection was colonic obstruction (3 of 10 in observa-
tion group versus 2 of 6 in antibiotic group), followed by
perforation (2 of 10 versus 2 of 6) (Table S8, supporting
information).
Some 86⋅6 and 90⋅2 per cent of patients in the obser-
vation and antibiotic groups respectively had a follow-up
duration of 12 months or more. At 12 months, treatment
groups were comparable in terms of the main secondary
outcomes readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and
recurrent diverticulitis rate, and overall need for sigmoid
resection (7⋅0 per cent versus 3⋅8 per cent; P = 0⋅057)
(Table S9, supporting information).

Adverse events
No significant between-group differences were observed in
the occurrence of mild (P = 0⋅086) and serious (P = 0⋅354)
adverse events (Table 3). As expected, antibiotic-related
adverse events, of which all but one were graded as mild,
were more frequent in the antibiotic group (0⋅4 versus 8⋅3
per cent; P = 0⋅006). Mortality rates were no different (1⋅1
versus 0⋅4 per cent; P = 0⋅432).
Subgroup and per-protocol analyses
No significant differences in the primary outcome, time
to recovery, were seen within subgroups of centre and
Hinchey classification (Fig. 3b; Fig. S1, supporting informa-
tion). In the Hinchey 1a subgroup (486 patients) secondary
outcomes were in line with those of the main analyses, but
in the Hinchey 1b subgroup (42) no significant differences
were found between the two groups (Table S10, supporting
information).
A total of 517 patients were included in the per-protocol
analyses. Results were in accordance with those of
intention-to-treat analyses. The median time to recovery
was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days with observation and 12 (7–31)
days with antibiotics (Fig. S2, supporting information),
associated with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0⋅93 (lower
limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅80; P = 0⋅200). This was
not affected by adjustment for Hinchey classification and
centre (hazard ratio 0⋅91, lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent
c.i. 0⋅78; P = 0⋅158). Within the Hinchey 1a subgroup,
with a median time to recovery of 14 (6–35) days in the
observation and 12 (6–31) days in the antibiotic group, the
hazard ratio for recovery was 0⋅89 (lower limit of 1-sided

95 per cent c.i. 0⋅76; P = 0⋅113). The secondary outcomes
were similar to those of the intention-to treat analyses
(Tables S11–S13, supporting information).
Discussion
In this pragmatic RCT, an observational strategy for a
first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute divertic-
ulitis was not inferior to treatment with antibiotics. The
duration of initial admission was longer and the rate of
antibiotic-related adverse events higher in the antibiotic
group. These results suggest that antibiotics can be omitted
in patients with a first episode of uncomplicated (Hinchey
I), left-sided acute diverticulitis.
Treatment without antibiotics is controversial, as guide-
lines have remained unchanged despite evidence from
two observational studies5,
6 and one RCT7 indicating that
antibiotics have no benefit. The previous RCT evaluated
623 patients, but some drawbacks of its methodological
design may account for the lack of change in clinical
practice7. The problems were: 40 per cent of patients had
recurrent rather than primary diverticulitis, there was a
long accrual period, and no standardized antibiotic treat-
ment may have resulted in performance bias7,
8,
14. The pos-
sibility that uncomplicated diverticulitis may not require
antibiotic treatment has been raised in recent literature24.
In the latest ASCRS practice parameters8, the Swedish trial
is discussed and deemed in need of confirmation. Mean-
while, two retrospective cohort studies25,
26 have confirmed
that a no-antibiotic policy for acute uncomplicated diverti-
culitis is feasible and safe.
There were some noteworthy limitations. Accrual rates
between centres were notably different. Selection bias
could have been introduced. The authors anticipate that
the large number of participating hospitals evened out
these possible effects. Importantly, the study’
s block ran-
domization and stratification by centre should also control
for such confounding. Although patients with recurrent
diverticulitis were excluded, patients who had experienced
an undetected previous episode without receiving medical
care, or who had been treated by general practitioners
without a definitive diagnosis, were not excluded by defini-
tion. Owing to multiple endpoints, the possibility of a type
II error existed and the rate of every negative outcome was
higher in the observation group. Therefore, groups were
compared for a composite endpoint, with no significant
differences found.
This trial, like most others, lacked power to detect
smaller subgroup effects. The present results suggest that
antibiotics may also not be necessary in patients with
Hinchey 1b diverticulitis. The inclusion of 1b disease may
be considered controversial, but small abscesses are usu-
ally managed without percutaneous drainage27. There are
no other reports on observational versus antibiotic manage-
ment of Hinchey 1b disease. Omitting antibiotics in the
treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be
limited to Hinchey 1a until larger Hinchey 1b samples have
been examined. Moreover, recommendations for patients
with significant co-morbidity or inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, and those who are pregnant or immunocompromised,
cannot be made based on the present results. Patients with
body temperature exceeding 39∘C, sepsis24 and/or positive
blood cultures warrant antibiotic treatment.
