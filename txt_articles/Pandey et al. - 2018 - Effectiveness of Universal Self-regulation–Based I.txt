IMPORTANCE Childhood and adolescence self-regulation (SR) is gaining importance as a
target of intervention because of mounting evidence of its positive associations with health,
social and educational outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of rigorously evaluated
interventions to improve self-regulation in children and adolescents.
DATA SOURCES Keyword searches of the PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, ERIC,
British Education Index, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, and CENTRAL were
used to identify all studies published through July 2016.
STUDY SELECTION To be eligible for this review, studies had to report cluster randomized trials
or randomized clinical trials, evaluate universal interventions designed to improve
self-regulation in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, include outcomes associated
with self-regulation skills, and be published in a peer-reviewed journal with the full text
available in English.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS A total of 14 369 published records were screened, of
which 147 were identified for full-text review and 49 studies reporting 50 interventions were
included in the final review. Results were summarized by narrative review and meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-regulation outcomes in children and adolescents.
RESULTS This review identified 17 cluster randomized trials and 32 randomized clinical trials
evaluating self-regulation interventions, which included a total of 23 098 participants ranging
in age from 2 to 17 years (median age, 6.0 years). Consistent improvement in self-regulation
was reported in 16 of 21 curriculum-based interventions (76%), 4 of the 8 mindfulness and
yoga interventions (50%), 5 of 9 family-based programs (56%), 4 of 6 exercise-based
programs (67%), and 4 of 6 social and personal skills interventions (67%), or a total of 33 of
50 interventions (66%). A meta-analysis evaluating associations of interventions with
self-regulation task performance scores showed a positive effect of such interventions with
pooled effect size of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32-0.53). Only 24 studies reported data on distal
outcomes (29 outcomes). Positive associations were reported in 11 of 13 studies (85%) on
academic achievement, 4 of 5 studies on substance abuse (80%), and in all studies reporting
on conduct disorders (n = 3), studies on social skills (n = 2), studies on depression (n = 2),
studies on behavioral problems (n = 2), and study on school suspensions (n = 1). No effect
was seen on 2 studies reporting on academic achievement, 1 study reporting on substance
abuse, and 1 additional study reporting on psychological well-being.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A wide range of interventions were successful in improving
self-regulation in children and adolescents. There was improvement in distal academic,
health, and behavioral outcomes in most intervention groups compared with controls.

 S
elf-regulation(SR)isapsychologicalconstructwhichen-
compasses a range of important competencies, includ-
ing the capacity for controlling one's emotions, the abil-
ity to have positive interactions with others, the capacity for
avoiding inappropriate or aggressive actions, and the ability
to carry out self-directed learning.1 Cognitive processes con-
tributing to SR are often referred to as executive functions, and
they include the ability to direct or focus attention, shift per-
spective, and adapt flexibly to changes (cognitive flexibility);
retain information (working memory); and inhibit automatic
or impulsive responses to achieve a goal, such as problem-
solving (impulse control).2,3 Self-regulation can be seen as the
volitional administration of executive functions in the enact-
ment of goal-related behavior.
ThereisgrowingevidencethatSRplaysanimportantfoun-
dational role in development and maintenance of physical
health and well-being in childhood and across the lifespan.4-7
Greater SR has been associated with positive outcomes on a
range of attributes, including school readiness, academic
achievement, healthy behavior, physical health, and mental
health. Conversely, poor SR has been linked to adverse out-
comes,suchashealthriskbehaviors,psychiatricdisorders,sub-
stance dependence, crime, and unemployment.8-13
Growing evidence of the importance of SR to improve life
chances has driven the development of a number of interven-
tions designed to improve SR skills during childhood and ado-
lescence. An increasing number of interventions have shown
promise in randomized clinical trials of self-regulatory capac-
ity improvements, ranging from playgroup games to training
in yoga and martial arts. Yet it remains unclear which type of
interventions are most effective and if effectiveness differs by
population, setting, or intervention characteristics. Previous
attempts to synthesize evidence on self-regulation interven-
tions have been limited to target populations (eg, people with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders) and specific age-
groups (eg, children age 0-10 years).14,15 No review to date has
evaluated the effectiveness of self-regulation interventions in
children and adolescents (age 0-19 years) and examined the
effects of such interventions on distal health and social out-
comes.
We undertook a systematic review of the effectiveness of
universalinterventionsdesignedtopromoteSRinchildrenand
adolescents (age 0-19 years), summarizing both evidence on
effectiveness of such interventions in improving SR and on im-
proving distal health and social outcomes, such as academic
achievement, substance abuse, well-being, and so on.
Methods
We followed an a priori search protocol to identify random-
ized and cluster randomized clinical trials that evaluated in-
terventionsfocusedonSRinchildrenandadolescents.Thepri-
mary search included 8 electronic databases: MEDLINE
(PubMed), PsycINFO, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE) via
Ovid; Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Cu-
mulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL) Plus, British Education Index, Child Development
and Adolescent Studies via EBSCO, and Cochrane Controlled
Trials Register (CENTRAL) in July 2016 to identify potential
studies for inclusion. In addition, we also searched reference
lists and citations of included studies to identify any addi-
tional studies. The details of the electronic search results are
summarized in Figure 1.

Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of universal
self-regulation–based interventions to improve self-regulation and
affect health and social outcomes in children and adolescents?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 49
randomized clinical trials evaluating 50 self-regulation
interventions found that these interventions were effective in
children and adolescents. Positive outcomes on health and social
measures such as academic achievement, social skills, mental
health, behavioral problems, conduct disorders, school
suspensions, and substance abuse was also reported.
Meaning Self-regulation interventions can be effective in children
and adolescents with possible benefits in health and social
outcomes.

 proportion of the total titles and abstracts were randomly se-
lectedandscreenedindependentlybyasecondreviewer(D.H.).
Results were compared to ensure that there was less than 5%
discrepancy in the results, after which screening of all search
results was completed by 1 reviewer (A.P.). After screening, 147
articles were identified for full-text review. These articles were
reviewed independently by 2 reviewers (A.P. and D.H.) for in-
clusion. Any discrepancy was resolved by consulting a third
reviewer (R.M.V.).
Studies were eligible for the review if they (1) reported ran-
domized clinical trials and cluster randomized trials; (2) evalu-
ated universal interventions designed to improve SR in chil-
dren and adolescents (age 0-19 years); (3) included at least 1
child-based outcome associated with SR skills; and (4) was a
peer-reviewed publication published in the English lan-
guage. All studies from the beginning date of database ar-
chives were eligible for inclusion.
We used a standardized data extraction form to record in-
formationabouteachstudy,includinggeneralinformationcon-
sisting of authors, country, study design, randomization pro-
cedure; population characteristics consisting of age, sex
distribution, ethnicity, any special demographics, baseline im-
balances, withdrawals, and exclusions; and intervention char-
acteristics consisting of content, mode of delivery, timing, in-
tervention provider, and fidelity of intervention. The
interventions could be classified into 5 categories: curricu-
lum interventions, physical activity and exercise interven-
tions, mindfulness and yoga interventions, parenting and fam-
ily-focused interventions, and other skills-based training.
We gathered information in detail about SR skills, which
was our primary outcome of interest, including tools used, as-
sessors, presence of blinding in assessment, and validity of the
assessment tools. A number of different outcome sources were
includedoverall,suchasparent,teacher,self-reports,andtask-
based measures. Findings for SR outcome were quantified by
effect sizes and CIs for quantitative synthesis. We also gath-
ered information on distal health and social outcomes, includ-
ing academic achievement, psychological stress, and sub-
stance abuse.
QualityassessmentwasconductedusingtheEffectivePub-
lic Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quan-
titative Studies.16 Included studies were assessed with re-
gards to selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding,
data collection methods, withdrawals, dropouts, interven-
tion integrity, and analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Of50includedinterventions,relevantdataforquantitativesyn-
thesis were available for 42. Effect sizes were calculated for the
intervention group relative to the comparison group for each
study. We used the Cohen d (defined as the difference between
posttest means divided by the pooled standard deviation) as
the effect size index. When 2 studies reported analyses of the
same sample, we included the larger sample for meta-
analysis.Whereveravailable,descriptivestatistics(mean,stan-
dard deviation, and sample size) was used to estimate effect
size. Wherever such information was unavailable, we esti-
mated effect sizes from available inferential statistics. When
more than 1 outcome variable associated with SR was re-
ported, we attempted to use the summary statistic for all as-
pects of SR. When such summary statistics were unavailable,
we selected the outcome variable that best described SR. All
effect sizes were calculated such that positive scores indicate
a desirable outcome for intervention participants compared
with control participants. All but 1 study reported continuous
outcomes.17 We conducted all analysis using an effect size
calculator.18 Meta-analysis was performed using a random-
effects model.19 We assessed for publication bias by visual in-
spectionoffunnelplots.TheI2statisticwascalculatedasamea-
sure of heterogeneity, which is interpreted as the proportion
of total variation in the estimated treatment effect that arises
from between-study heterogeneity rather than by chance.20
We also conducted subgroup analyses to explore for sources
of heterogeneity based on the age of study participants, the
type of intervention, the duration of the intervention, and the
source of outcome measure.

Results
Our literature search strategy identified 14 369 potentially rel-
evant studies; 49 studies reporting 50 interventions met all eli-
gibility criteria and were included in the final review (includ-
ing a total of 23 098 participants, a mean of 462 participants
per study). Our review included records published over a span
of 4 decades (1977-2017). On assessment, 3 studies were rated
as high quality, 38 as moderate in quality, and 8 as poor qual-
ity. The most common reason for downgrading a quality rat-
ing was a lack of blinding of participants, which was difficult
to achieve in this type of intervention; 46 studies (93.8%) were
downgraded for this reason. Detailed characteristics of in-
cluded studies5,17,24-74 are summarized in eTables 1-5 in the
Supplement.
Theageofstudyparticipantsrangedfrom2to17years,with
a median of 6.0 years. Although we identified interventions
evaluated for children in the age group 0 to 2 years in our lit-
erature search, they were limited to target populations, and
reports on universal interventions were only available for chil-
dren older than 2 years. The pooled sample characteristics in-
cluding sex, location, study setting, socioeconomic status, and
race/ethnicity are described in the Table.

Narrative Review
The SR interventions were classified as curriculum based,
mindfulness and yoga, family based, exercise based, and other
social and personal skills–based intervention strategies/
delivery methods. These classifications were based on discus-
sion between the review team members (A.P., D.H., and S.D.).
The interventions were delivered by teachers, psychologists,
yoga trainers, parent consultants, research facilitators, and/or
staff trained in a specific curriculum or specialty area.

 Mindfulness/Yoga Interventions
Eight studies30,32,33,44,45,55,72,73 evaluated mindfulness
and/or yoga techniques to enhance SR. These interventions
were mostly applied within the adolescent age group, and
although the effect on long-term outcomes was not studied
in most interventions, these interventions did show prom-
ise in improving SR in adolescents. All the interventions
were of short duration (6 months or less) and school based,
with qualified mindfulness or yoga instructors and
assistants delivering the intervention. Mindfulness and
yoga and exercise-based interventions were evaluated and
found to be effective especially for the preadolescent and
adolescent age groups. Four30,33,45,73of the 8 interventions
(50%) produced a statistically significant effect size favoring
the intervention group. The sample size of evaluated inter-
ventions was small, and that might be one of the reasons
why the proportion of interventions producing a statisti-
cally significant difference was relatively low compared
with other types of interventions. One intervention each
(13%) showed benefits in academic achievement,44 sub-
stance use,55 and mental health73 in active-arm participants
compared with control participants.
Family-Based Intervention

munity based (n = 5 of 9 [56%]),24,34,48,53,56 while others were
school based (n = 4 of 9 [44%]).39,43,46,60 Compared with other
interventions, these interventions had longer follow-up du-
rations. Family-based interventions were successful in bring-
ing a consistent change in SR measures in intervention groups
in 5 of the 9 studies (56%).34,39,43,56,60 There was also benefit
reported in distal outcomes, with better academic
achievement,46 mental health,60 social skills,34 and behav-

lems in 2 studies (22%)34,56; and reduction in substance use

Other Social and Personal Skills
A final subgroup of 617,64,65,69,71,75 evaluated interventions in-
cluded social and personal skills training in small groups using
frameworksofpersonalresponsibility,modelbehavior,conflict
resolution, and so on. These were especially useful in aspects
of SR such as delay of gratification, effortful control, and at-
tention. These interventions were highly effective, with only
265,71 of the 6 studies (33%) reporting a small and statistically
insignificant change, while others reported17,64,69,75 signifi-
cant improvements in SR measures (Figure 3). These inter-
ventions were focused on the aspects of SR and mostly tested
theskillsontask-basedperformancescores.Therelativelyhigh
effect size of these interventions (d, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86
vs an overall d of 0.42; 95% CI, 0.32-0.53) can be explained by
the focused nature of these interventions on aspects of SR, and
testing skills on task-based performance scores. None of these
studies reported on health and social outcomes.

ent report, teacher report, or self-report of SR behavior or was

studies that measured SR through performance testing requir-
ing SR skills reduced the I2 score from 77% to 39.3% (Figure 3).
In addition, the parent-reported, teacher-reported, and
self-reported scores are subjective assessments, while task-
based scores are direct measurements of SR skills and hence
less likely to be affected by detection bias. Thus, in our final
meta-analysis, we only included studies reporting SR out-
comesbasedontaskperformancescores.Wetestedthesestud-
ies for publication bias by creating a funnel plot (eFigure in the
Supplement).Thefunnelplotwassymmetrical,indicatingthat
publication bias in included studies was unlikely. Next, we as-
sessed the effectiveness of interventions from these 19 stud-
ies by pooling the results on a forest plot (Figure 3). We found
that the overall effect was statistically significant and fa-
vored the intervention (pooled effect size d = 0.42; 95% CI,
0.32-0.53). Social and personal skills intervention had a higher
mean effect size (d = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86). There was con-
siderable heterogeneity in data outcomes from studies using
parent-reported, teacher-reported, and self-reported mea-
sures of SR(I2 = 77%); as a result, a meta-analysis for the out-
comes in these studies was not undertaken.
Effects on Health and Social Outcomes
Data regarding the effect of interventions on concurrent and
distal health and social outcomes were found in 24 of 49 stud-
ies (49%). The effect of SR interventions on these outcomes
issummarizedineTable6intheSupplement.Quantitativesyn-
thesis of effect sizes for these outcomes was precluded by the
small number of studies reporting the data required to calcu-
late effect sizes, and considerable heterogeneity in outcome
measures. The follow-up period for these interventions ranged
from 3 months to 5 years.
The outcome studied most commonly was academic
achievement, and 1127-29,31,36,38,44,46,57,58,63 of 13 studies59,67 re-
ported a positive impact in the SR intervention group, which
was statistically significant. The areas of academic achieve-
ment with improvement included literacy, mathematics, read-
ing, letter naming, and vocabulary. One study reported no
impact,67 and another reported a marginal improvement that
wasnotsignificantonstatisticalanalysis.59Threestudiesstud-
ied the effect on conduct disorders and found fewer conduct
problems in the intervention groups compared with the con-
trol groups (eTable 6 in the Supplement).35,56,66 In 1 of the
studies61 in which further analysis was done, it was observed
that the prevention effects were stronger for youth at greater
risk of developing conduct problems. Social skills, behavioral
problems, and mental illness (depression) were studied in 2
studies each, and a positive impact was observed with re-
spect to all outcomes.31,43,48,51,60,73 One study reported a de-
crease in number of school suspensions after intervention,35
and 435,43,55,56 of 5 studies on substance use observed a benefit
in the intervention group; the fifth study30 showed no ben-
efit. A small but statistically insignificant improvement was
seen on 1 study50 reporting on psychological well-being. There
was no advantage of 1 type of intervention over another with
regards to effect on distal outcomes.
Discussion
Findingsfromthecurrentsystematicreviewdemonstrateover-
all effectiveness of SR interventions in children and adoles-
cents. A number of rigorously evaluated interventions for SR
using different types of interventions were found to be effec-
tive. By summarizing the evidence on studies evaluating SR
interventions, we observed that while most interventions
(n = 33 [66%]) were successful in improving SR, some of them
did not produce a noticeable change (n = 17 [34%]). When syn-
thesizing the evidence quantitatively, we found considerable
heterogeneity in the outcomes, and thus it may be difficult to
draw conclusions on effectiveness based on pooled effect size
estimates. However, based on the number of effective inter-
ventions, it can be concluded that each intervention type was
effective in most of the studies testing them. The interven-
tions were effective across all child and adolescent age groups
and in both community and school settings. Curriculum-
based approaches were most commonly used, and these in-
volved training components for teachers who then imple-
mented these interventions in classrooms. Compared with
curriculum interventions, mindfulness and yoga interven-
tions were shorter in duration but required additional staff in
the form of trained yoga and exercise instructors. Family-
based interventions used factors such as parenting practices
and sibling relationships to enhance SR. Despite some of these
interventions being based in communities, where it is a chal-
lenge to recruit and retain participants, the studies were able
to achieve good compliance and effectiveness. The social and
personal skills interventions were successful in improving SR
through model behavior, attention training, and fantasy play
activities in small groups. The pooled effect size for interven-
tions reporting SR improvement on task performance scores
was small, but comparable with other reviews looking at uni-
versal intervention for children and adolescents.75
There was evidence mainly on the effect on distal out-
comes(academicachievement,mentalhealth,socialskills,and
frequency of school suspensions), better educational attain-
ment, and lower tendency for substance abuse in interven-
tion groups compared with controls. One study found that the
intervention effect was highest for those at greater risk for con-
duct problems,61,62 thus offering the promise of interven-
tions where they are needed most.
There was no particular age group in which interventions
were most effective; they improved SR scores across all age
groups. Although most of the studies were conducted in the
UnitedStates,therewasalsoracial/ethnicdiversityinthestudy
subjects because some studies were conducted in areas with
racial/ethnic minority populations or mixed populations. Our
review included 7929 low-income study participants (34.3%),
which showed efficacy of interventions in a disadvantaged
group, including that outcomes such as academic success and
employment are harder to achieve. We also observed that SR
can be improved in childhood as well as in adolescence, thus

The findings of this review would be useful for policy mak-
ers, educators, and health professionals focusing on preven-
tionasSRattractsmoreattentionasaninterventiontarget.The
findings can be a useful aid when designing SR interventions,
with a range of effective intervention strategy options avail-
able. Also, some interventions brought more improvements in
SR measures of those with lower baseline scores.43,63 Such in-
terventions can be particularly useful when limited re-
sources are available, and there is need to design interven-
tions for the most vulnerable children and adolescents.
Curriculum-based interventions were delivered in schools by
training of teachers without a need for considerable addi-
tional resource in terms of time and staff. In addition, chil-
dren and adolescents spend a considerable part of their time
at school between the ages of 5 and 18 years and thus are eas-
ily accessible for interventions. Considering these factors, cur-
riculum-based interventions can be preferred over other types
of interventions. The effect of SR interventions on outcomes
such as educational attainment, substance abuse, conduct
problems, mental health, school suspensions, and behav-
ioral problems shows promise for SR as an intervention target
that can help improve educational, health, and social out-
comes and thus provide opportunities to reduce inequalities
in these areas.

cents.Also,mostoftheincludedstudiesweremoderatetostrong
quality in evidence.
Limitations
There are limitations to this systematic review that need
consideration. The SR outcome measures were not uniform,
and there was substantial heterogeneity in their reporting.
Considering this limitation of the evidence base of SR inter-
ventions, we would recommend that future research in SR
should be directed to evaluate standard methods of report-
ing SR outcomes. Our review was also limited to published
literature in the English language. We may have therefore
missed unpublished work and studies published in other
languages. The generalizability of our research findings may
also be affected by the substantial number of studies con-
ducted in the United States.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study findings suggest that SR interven-
tions are effective and that improvements in educational,
health, and social outcomes can follow improvements in SR.
Different types of interventions can be used to improve self-
regulation, and many of these strategies appear effective.
