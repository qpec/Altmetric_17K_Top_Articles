Abstract
Cannabis abuse in adolescence is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders. D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the
primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) protein is a driver for major mental illness by
influencing neurodevelopmental processes. Here, utilizing a unique mouse model based on host (DISC1) X environment (THC ad-
ministration) interaction, we aimed at studying the pathobiological basis through which THC exposure elicits psychiatric manifes-
tations. Wild-Type and dominant-negative-DISC1 (DN-DISC1) mice were injected with THC (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days during
mid-adolescence-equivalent period. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess exploratory activity (open field test, light-dark box
test) and cognitive function (novel object recognition test). Electrophysiological effect of THC was evaluated using acute hippocam-
pal slices, and hippocampal cannabinoid receptor type 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were mea-
sured. Our results indicate that THC exposure elicits deficits in exploratory activity and recognition memory, together with reduced
short-term synaptic facilitation and loss of BDNF surge in the hippocampus of DN-DISC mice, but not in wild-type mice. Over-
expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice prevented the impairment in recognition memory. The re-
sults of this study imply that induction of BDNF following adolescence THC exposure may serve as a homeostatic response geared
to maintain proper cognitive function against exogenous insult. The BDNF surge in response to THC is perturbed in the presence of
mutant DISC1, suggesting DISC1 may be a useful probe to identify biological cascades involved in the neurochemical, electrophysi-
ological, and behavioral effects of cannabis related psychiatric manifestations.

 Introduction
Psychotic disorders are increasingly considered as disorders of
brain development (1). While it is widely accepted that host-
environment interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of psy-
chotic disorders (2,3), the biological mechanisms that mediate
such interactions are unclear. Thus, utilizing animal models for
investigating synergistic effects between a candidate gene and
an environmental factor may provide better understanding of
the complicated mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility
for different environmental insults.
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among
adolescents in the U.S. (4) and in Europe (5), and is increas-
ingly becoming legalized for recreational use (6). The conse-
quences of cannabis use during adolescence is of increased
concern due to its deleterious effects on brain development
(7). Several studies have shown that cannabis use during ado-
lescence increases the risk of developing first episode psycho-
sis as well as various psychotic disorders later in life (8–12).
Recent studies suggest that the primary psychoactive compo-
nent of cannabis, D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), interferes
with maturational and developmental processes in the brain
of adolescents and causes psychopathological effects, such as
disinhibition and neurocognitive abnormalities, especially in
learning and memory processes (13–15). Nevertheless, merely
a small fraction of adolescent cannabis users develop a
psychotic disorder. One possible explanation is that certain
individuals are genetically susceptible to mental illness. This
explanation is supported by a recent study reporting that can-
nabis use in early adolescence moderates the association be-
tween
the
genetic
risk
for
schizophrenia
and
cortical
maturation among male individuals (16).
The Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene was discovered
through a unique Scottish pedigree in which a balanced translo-
cation in this gene segregated with severe mental illness includ-
ing schizophrenia (17). Although abundant research has been
conducted since its discovery, currently it is still unclear
whether genetic variation in DISC1 is involved in sporadic cases
of schizophrenia in the general population.
DISC1 protein is a molecular driver for major mental ill-
ness by influencing biological processes that mediate neuro-
development (18), including
progenitor
cell proliferation,
neurite outgrowth, neuronal migration and synapse forma-
tion and maintenance (19,20). DISC1 is highly expressed in
the developing brain, both prenatally and postnatally from
birth through adulthood, including the olfactory bulb and hip-
pocampus, regions of adult neurogenesis (21). DISC1 is an in-
tracellular
scaffold
protein
which
interacts
with
several
proteins, thus serving as a hub protein for a variety of cellular
processes (22). Therefore, DISC1 is an attractive target for
studying the biological mechanisms that underpin host sus-
ceptibility to mental illness induced by environmental insults
during brain development.
In a previous work from our team, we studied the long last-
ing effect of adolescence THC use in adult mice (23). In the cur-
rent study, we aimed to investigate the effect of robust THC
administration during adolescence in the post adolescent-
young adulthood period in order to model the effect of cannabis
on susceptible hosts in the context of first episode psychosis.
Furthermore, we investigated the biological mechanism of the
interaction between perturbed DISC1 signaling and THC expo-
sure during adolescence. We employed a transgenic mouse
model expressing a putative dominant-negative mutant form of
DISC1 (DN-DISC1) under the control of the aCaMKII promoter,
thereby restricting its expression to forebrain pyramidal neu-
rons (24). We exposed adolescent DN-DISC1 mice to sub-chronic
THC administration and evaluated the behavioral, biochemical
and electrophysiological effects a few days after THC adminis-
tration. We aimed to recapitulate the clinical presentation of
adolescent/early adulthood patients presenting to psychiatry
clinics with first clinical signs of a psychotic disorder after ro-
bust use of cannabis. This host (DN-DISC1 mice) X environment
(THC administration) experimental paradigm enabled us to
study the biological mechanisms through which DISC1 pathway
perturbation interacts with adolescence THC exposure to exert
behavioral deficits. Specifically, we investigated the role of
BDNF signaling as it was previously suggested to be aberrant in
this mouse model (25).
Results
Adolescent THC exposure induces aberrant exploratory
activity in DN-DISC1 mice, but not in WT mice
We first wanted to see whether interaction of THC exposure
with genetic aberrations can affect behavioral parameters. WT
and DN-DISC1 mice exposed sub-chronically to THC did not
show a decrease in locomotor activity during a 10-min period of
exploration in the open field arena (Fig. 1A). Vehicle-treated DN-
DISC1 mice did not differ from vehicle-treated WT mice in
terms of time spent in the anxiety-provoking center of the open
field arena. Nevertheless, following sub-chronic THC adminis-
tration, DN-DISC1 mice spent more time exploring the arena
center compared to vehicle-treated DN-DISC1 mice. This effect
was not evident in WT mice exposed to THC. Two-way ANOVA
revealed a significant genotype X exposure interaction (Fig. 1B).
In the light-dark box test, THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice spent
the longest period of time exploring the anxiety-provoking light
chamber compared to the other experimental groups. Two-way
ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of exposure and geno-
type, though genotype X exposure interaction was nonsignifi-
cant (Fig. 1D). Evaluation of the latency to enter the dark
compartment of the light-dark box, showed that THC-treated
DN-DISC1 mice demonstrated the longest latency to enter the
non-anxiety-provoking dark chamber compared to other exper-
imental groups (Fig. 1E). Main effects of genotype and exposure
were significant, however, the genotype X exposure interaction
was nonsignificant.
THC interacts with DISC1 to induce impaired object
recognition memory
We examined whether THC would affect cognitive function in
our genetically susceptible DN-DISC mice (Fig. 2A). Vehicle-
treated WT mice, as well as THC-treated WT mice and vehicle-
treated DN-DISC1 mice- displayed intact object recognition
memory, manifested by preference to explore the novel object
(exploring the novel object more than the familiar object), fol-
lowing a retention period of 1 h. However, DN-DISC1 mice ex-
posed sub-chronically to THC did not show preference for the
novel object, indicating disrupted short-term object recognition
memory (Fig. 2B). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant geno-
type X exposure interaction (Fig. 2B).
Since object recognition is considered to be a hippocampus-
dependent task (26), we aimed to investigate the effect of THC
on synaptic function in the CA3-CA1 hippocampal pathway
using acute hippocampal slices of an additional cohort of

 DN-DISC1 mice that were treated sub-chronically with THC.
First, we measured the effect of THC on input-output relation-
ship in the CA3-CA1 synaptic connections. For this, we recorded
field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the CA1 area
evoked by low frequency stimulation (0.1 Hz) of CA3 axons at
gradually increased stimulation intensities (Fig 2C). The slope of
the input (amplitude of fiber volley)/output (amplitude of fEPSP)
curve was similar between THC-treated and vehicle-treated DN-
DISC1 mice (P ¼ 0.58), indicating that basal CA3-CA1 synaptic
transmission was preserved following THC exposure. To exam-
ine the influence of THC on short-term synaptic plasticity, a
critical determinant of synaptic computation and memory func-
tion (26,27), we recorded fEPSP in CA1 stratum radiatum, while
stimulating the CA3 axons in the Shaffer Collateral pathway by
bursts composed of 5 stimuli at 50 Hz (Fig. 2D). THC significantly
reduced synaptic facilitation as estimated by a decrease in the
relative fEPSP slope within the burst in DN-DISC1 mice, while
demonstrating no interaction between THC and stimulus num-
ber during the burst. This indicates that for THC-treated DN-
DISC1 mice, facilitation in CA3-CA1 connections is decreased
equally throughout the burst relative to vehicle-treated con-
trols. Thus, sub-chronic administration of THC reduces high-
pass filter properties of CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses that
may contribute to the observed behavioral deficits.
THC administration induces an increase in hippocampal
CB1R and BDNF levels in WT mice, but not in
DN-DISC1 mice
Next, we evaluated CB1R expression levels in the hippocampi
of the mice using western blot analysis. We found a significant
genotype X exposure interaction (Fig. 3A), as CB1R expression
was down regulated following THC administration in the DN-
DISC1
mice
whereas
in
the
WT
mice
it
was
slightly
upregulated.
Taking into account that THC is known to upregulate BDNF
expression (28–30), we measured BDNF protein levels in the hip-
pocampus using ELISA. In WT mice, sub-chronic administration
of THC resulted in a significant increase of 42% in hippocampal
BDNF (Fig. 3B). However, in DN-DISC1 treated sub-chronically
with THC, this increase was not evident, revealing a significant
genotype X exposure interaction.
Hippocampal over-expression of BDNF prior to THC
administration specifically prevented the deficit in
object recognition memory in DN-DISC1 mice
Since WT mice responded to sub-chronic THC administration
with a surge in hippocampal BDNF, which was not observed in

nonsignificant (F1,37¼0.05, P ¼ 0.83 and F1,37¼1.59, P ¼ 0.22, respectively). (C) Illustration of the exploration path in the open field arena tracked by the EthoVision soft-

interaction was nonsignificant (F1,37¼2.67, P ¼ 0.11). Data (Mean þ SEM) were obtained from 19 DN-DISC1 males (9 Vehicle and 10 THC) and 22 WT males (11 Vehicle and
11 THC). Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.

Therefore, we over-expressed BDNF-EGFP in the hippocampus
of DN-DISC1 mice using a lentiviral vector, while the control

mental groups were later treated sub-chronically with THC, ac-
cording to the protocol conducted on the previous cohorts of
mice. Therefore, both groups are referred to as DN-DISC1-THC

in the first cohort of mice (Fig. 4A).
After completion of behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed
and several assays were conducted in order to validate over-
expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. First, we verified the
EGFP expression in the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 4B). In addi-
tion, hippocampal BDNF levels were determined using ELISA,
and hippocampal p-TrkB, indicating BDNF signaling, were mea-
sured using western blot analysis. We detected a significant in-
crease of 27% in hippocampal BDNF levels and a significant

vector
(BDNF-treated
DN-DISC1-THC mice) compared with DN-DISC1 mice injected
only with the EGFP vector (sham-treated DN-DISC1-THC mice)
(Fig. 4C and D).
Behavioral analysis revealed that, in the hippocampus-
dependent novel object recognition test, BDNF-treated DN-
DISC1-THC mice showed intact preference to the novel object,
which was not displayed by the sham-treated DN-DISC1-THC
mice (Fig. 4I). Importantly, BDNF treatment did not induce alter-
ations in behavior in the open field test (Fig. 4E and F), or in the
light-dark box test (Fig. 4G and H), as compared with the sham
treatment.
Discussion
Our results suggest that sub-chronic exposure to THC in
adolescence-equivalent period results in significant aberrations
in behavior only in mice harboring host susceptibility (DN-
DISC1 mice). This finding is consistent with the accepted view
that genetic background interacts with environmental insults to
induce psychopathology (gene X environment interaction) (31–
33). Our study reveals a strong connection between DISC1 X
THC interactions and cognitive function. DN-DISC1 mice ex-
posed to THC showed impairments in exploratory activity, re-
duced
performance
in
object
recognition,
a
hippocampal
dependent memory test, together with reduced hippocampal
short-term synaptic facilitation.
As DISC1 protein is considered a hub protein that interacts
with numerous intracellular proteins for multiple neural signal-
ing cascades, likely relevant to the pathobiology of mental ill-
ness (18), it is plausible that THC-elicited cellular cascades
interact with DISC1. We observed that DN-DISC1 mice fail to re-
spond to THC administration with a BDNF surge in the hippo-
campus, as compared to WT mice. Furthermore, we have
shown that an intervention that increases the levels of hippo-
campal BDNF levels ameliorates the cognitive deficit, indicating
that the interaction of DISC1 with the cascade starting in THC
exposure and leading eventually to BDNF induction, is involved
in the cognitive deficits at the mechanistic level. The fact that
BDNF introduction did not affect the behavior of the mice in the
open field and light-dark box tests suggest that the effect of hip-
pocampal BDNF over expression is more specific to the cogni-
tive aspects investigated in this study.
BDNF was previously found to be elevated in multiple brain
areas following exposure to THC (28,29), in particular in the hip-
pocampus (30) where BDNF is well characterized as a key modu-
lator of hippocampal synaptic plasticity (34). In addition,
cannabinoid signaling induces BDNF mediated neuroprotection
of striatal neurons against excitotoxicity (29). Nonetheless, the
in vivo role for BDNF induction in response to THC exposure was
unclear. This study has provided an answer to this important
question. The interaction of DISC1 with the cascade from THC
to BDNF leads to the loss of hippocampal BDNF surge and cogni-
tive deficits, which is prevented by the exogenous supply of
BDNF. Therefore, these results imply that the induction of BDNF
after THC exposure is a homeostatic response of the host to
maintain proper cognitive function against the exogenous in-
sult. Any host factors (e.g., genetic variations) that provide vul-
nerability to this homeostatic and compensatory mechanism
may underlie the risk for cognitive deficits and mental dysfunc-
tion elicited by THC or cannabis.
Cannabis abuse during adolescence has long been known to
be a risk factor for psychosis (3), with evidence for the increased
psychotogenic effect of cannabis with high THC concentration
(35). A recent study reported that cannabis imposes an even
greater risk for first-episode psychosis than previously thought
(12). Mechanistically, it is suggested that THC disturbs the physio-
logical control of the endogenous cannabinoid system over gluta-
mate and GABA release. One hypothesis is that the transient
blockade of the CB1 receptor, by exposure to THC, leads to an ex-
cess of glutamate and consequently too great an influx of calcium
in the postsynaptic neuron, thereby causing excitotoxicity (13).
Alternatively,
cannabinoid
signaling
dysregulation
in
CCK-
positive CB1R-expressing GABAergic interneurons, induced by
the administration of THC, may in turn result in desynchroniza-
tion of neural oscillations in the gamma range (36).
Nonetheless, it was unclear how this strong environmental
stressor (adolescent cannabis exposure) interacts with host fac-
tors. To address this question, some groups have exposed THC
to genetic animal models that by themselves display behavioral
deficits,
relevant
to
schizophrenia
and
related
disorders
(23,32,33). Encouraged by the findings from Ballinger et al. (23),
that focused on the long lasting effects in adulthood of
childhood-adolescent THC use, we sought to investigate the ef-
fect of robust THC use during adolescence in the context of first
episode psychosis in post adolescent-young adulthood period.
Importantly, these distinct paradigms provided divergent re-
sults in terms of cognitive domains affected, as Ballinger et al.
did not describe long lasting deficits in object recognition mem-
ory,
but
rather
reported
deficits
in
emotional
memory.
Importantly, the current study reveals a novel mechanism
through which cannabis exerts its detrimental effect on the sus-
ceptible DN-DISC1 mutant mice.
The mechanism proposed in the present study aids in
understanding of such preclinical studies. We believe that the
strength of this study lies in providing an important mechanism
downstream
of
cannabis
exposure
by
using
a
host-
environmental factor interaction model. Future studies may
test whether BDNF-mediated improvement of THC-induced
cognitive deficits is underpinned by the rescue of short-term
synaptic plasticity impairments.
Our study has some limitations. The behavioral results,
demonstrating significant gene X exposure interactions in
some, but not all the behavioral parameters evaluated, indicate
the complexity of the interaction. Specifically, we found that
THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice spent more time exploring the anx-
iety provoking center of the open field arena and light chamber
of the light-dark box. This could be conceptualized as a result of
the anxiolytic effect of THC on the DN-DISC1 susceptible mice,
similar to the effect seen following benzodiazepine treatment in
these paradigms (37). Alternatively, it can also be interpreted as
"poor judgment" or behavioral disinhibition (38) and thus as a
possible indication for psychosis in the DN-DISC1 susceptible
mice. Notably, animal models cannot recapitulate the complex-
ity of schizophrenia or first episode psychosis (39), but rather
serve as an efficient tool to test genetic predisposition (DISC1) to
pathological states in the context of an environmental insult
(THC). Therefore, we focused on the evident cognitive effect
that was observed in our study. The other behavioral measures
and their possible meaning in the context of psychosis- should
be interpreted with caution.
To conclude, we present a mechanism mediating host sus-
ceptibility to environmental insult using a translational mouse
model with possible relevance to schizophrenia onset. The devel-
opment of a host-environment interaction model that utilizes
perturbed DISC1 pathway as host vulnerability and THC exposure
as an environmental insult, could be helpful in elucidating the

 underpinning pathobiology of psychotic disorders, in discovering
novel pharmacological targets, and in testing therapeutic poten-
tial of novel treatment modalities. We suggest that future studies
should use the signaling pathway proposed here as a possible
target for treating patients at the early stage of mental illness,
and that enhancement of BDNF signaling may be a viable ap-
proach to prevent deterioration of symptoms towards full blown
severe mental disease such as schizophrenia.
Materials and Methods
Animals
We used a homozygous line of dominant-negative disrupted in
schizophrenia 1 (DN-DISC1) mice developed on a C57BL/6J back-
ground (24,40–42). DN-DISC1 mice express a putative dominant-
negative C-terminal truncated DISC1 under the control of the
aCaMKII promoter. Using this line created thorough homozy-
gous
inbreeding,
we
do
not
have
littermate
controls.
Importantly, it was shown that the control non-littermate wild-
type mice (offspring of the heterozygote DN-DISC1 mice that do
not express the truncated DISC1), do not differ from C57BL/6J in
various behavioral tests (24). Thus, as controls we used Wild-
Type C57BL/6 (WT) mice from Harlan (Harlan Laboratories,
Jerusalem, Israel).
Mice were housed in a group of 3-5 per cage. All mice were
kept in a 12 h light/dark cycle and had access to food and water
ad libitum. Behavioral training and testing were completed in
the light cycle between 8:00 A.M and 5:00 P.M. All animal experi-
ments and protocols were approved by the Committee for
Animal Research at Tel Aviv University, Israel.
Experimental design
In the first cohort, six weeks old (6 5 days) male WT (n ¼ 22) and
DN-DISC1 (n ¼ 19) mice were injected intraperitoneally with
THC (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days during adolescence-
equivalent period (postnatal 42–51d). Three days after the last
THC administration, the behavioral effects of sub-chronic THC
administration were evaluated utilizing behavioral tests to as-
sess exploratory activity (open field, light-dark box test) and
cognitive function (novel object recognition test).
For electrophysiological analysis, we used another cohort of
six weeks old (6 5 days) male DN-DISC1 mice. The mice were in-
jected intraperitoneally with THC (10 mg/kg) (n ¼ 5) or vehicle
(n ¼ 5) for 10 days during adolescence-equivalent period (post-
natal 42–51d). Three-four days after the last THC administration
the effects of sub-chronic THC injections on hippocampal short
term facilitation were evaluated using field EPSP recordings in
the Schaffer Collateral (SC) of acute hippocampal slices.
In another mice cohort, five weeks old (6 5 days) DN-DISC1
mice were injected with lentiviral vectors carrying BDNF-EGFP
(n ¼ 15) or EGFP (n ¼ 14) into the dorsal hippocampus. One week
later (six weeks old) mice were injected intraperitoneally with
10 mg/kg THC for 10 days. Three days after the last THC admin-
istration, mice underwent behavioral tests to assess exploratory
activity (open field, light-dark box test) and recognition memory
(novel object recognition test).
Behavioral tests
Analysis of the behavioral testing was conducted using the
EthoVision XT 10 software platform (Noldus, Wageningen,
Netherlands).
Open field test
In the open field test, mice were placed in a 47�47�51 cm arena
for 10 min. Total distance travelled and duration of time explor-
ing the periphery and the center of the arena were measured
using the EthoVision software.
Light-dark box test
The light-dark apparatus is a rectangular box divided into a small
(27�18�30 cm) and a large (27�27�30cm) chambers with a small
entrance (6�10 cm) located in the center of the partition at floor
level. The small chamber is a closed compartment painted in
black (dark chamber), whereas the large chamber is transparent,
open-topped and brightly illuminated (light chamber). Mice are
placed in the brightly lit chamber and are allowed to freely ex-
plore both chambers for 10 min. Latency of the first crossing from
the light chamber to the dark chamber and time spent in the light
chamber were recorded and analyzed by EthoVision software.
Novel object recognition test
The test was conducted as reported previously (40). Briefly, mice
were individually habituated to the open-field arena for three
consecutive days. During the training session, two identical ob-
jects were placed in the arena and the mice were free to explore
for 10 min. Following a retention period of 1 h, mice were placed
back to the same arena for another 10 min while one of the ob-
jects has been replaced with a novel object different in shape
and size. Duration of time spent sniffing each object was quan-
tified by EthoVision software. Novel object preference was cal-
culated as the percentage of time spent sniffing the novel object
relative to the total time spent sniffing both objects. Mice that
did not sniff any of the objects were excluded from analysis.
Electrophysiology
Coronal hippocampal slices (400 lm) were prepared in a cold
(4 �C) storage buffer containing (in mM): sucrose, 206; KCl, 2;
MgSO4, 2; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; glucose,
10. The slicing procedure was performed using a Leica VT1200
vibrating microtome as described (43). Slices were transferred to
a submerged recovery chamber at room temperature containing
oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(ACSF) for 1 h before recording.
Experiments were performed at room temperature in a record-
ing chamber on the stage of an Olympus BX51WI microscope
equipped with IR DIC optics. fEPSPs were recorded with a glass pi-
pette containing Tyrode solution (1–2 MX) from proximal synapses
in the CA1 stratum radiatum using a MultiClamp700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices). Stimulation of the Schaffer Collateral pathway
was delivered through a glass suction electrode (10–20lm tip) filled
with Tyrode solution. fEPSPs were induced by single stimuli at
0.1Hz or by bursts (5 stimuli at 50Hz, inter-burst-interval of 30s) as
described before (44). Electrophysiological data were analyzed us-
ing pClamp10 (Molecular Devices).
Tissue Analysis
Dissection and tissue collection
For western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), the brains of all mice were removed and the hippo-
campi of each mouse were dissected, divided into left and right

 hemispheres and cryopreserved at -80˚C. Dissection of the mice
brains was conducted using the Stainless Steel Zivic Adult
Mouse Brain Slicer Matrix with 1.0 mm coronal section slice in-
tervals (Zivic Instruments, PA, USA).
ELISA for BDNF quantification
For protein extraction, dissected hippocampi of one hemisphere
were thawed, and total protein was produced as previously de-
scribed (45). Protein concentration was determined using the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Quantification of BDNF levels was conducted using a
BDNF specific ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (50 mg of each
sample). The absorbance at 450 and 570 nm was recorded on a
Microplate Reader (LabSystems Multiskan MS).
Synaptic protein extraction and western blot analysis
Syn-PERTM Synaptic Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was used for extrac-
tion of proteins expressed in the synapses of the hippocampal
tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The pro-
tein concentration of the synaptosomal fractions was quantified
utilizing the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
Proteins were separated by 4–20% Mini-PROTEANV
R TGXTM pre-
cast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) electropho-
resis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were probed overnight at 4 �C with the following primary antibod-
ies: rabbit Anti-Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (1:1000, 17978-1-AP, protein-
tech, Chicago, IL, USA), rabbit Anti-TrkB (phospho Y515) (1 mg/ml,
ab109684, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and as a loading
control
mouse
anti-Actin
(1:500,
MAB1501,
EMD
Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany). Thereafter, membranes were incubated with
secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse IRDye 680CW or 800CW and
goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680CW or 800CW (1:5,000, infra-red dye, LI-
COR Biosciences, NE, USA) for 1h at room temperature. The mem-
branes were then scanned with Odyssey Infrared Imager (model
9120, LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometric analysis of Western blots
was
performed
using
Image
StudioTM
Lite
software
(LI-COR
Biosciences) to measure the area and density of protein bands
Histology
Mice were transcardially perfused, under ketamine/xylazine an-
esthesia, with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by
paraformaldehyde 4% in phosphate buffer. The brains were im-
mersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24h at 4 �C followed by cryo-
protection in 30% sucrose for an additional 48 h. The brains were
frozen in chilled 2-methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich) and subse-
quently sectioned into slices measuring 10lm. In order to demon-
strate the location of the stereotaxic injection of the viral vectors
carrying the EGFP gene, slides were stained with DAPI (1:500;
Sigma-Aldrich) and sections were mounted with fluorescent
mounting solution (Fluoromount-G, SouthernBiotech), covered
with a cover slide, and sealed with nail polish. Images were taken
using the Axio Imager.Z2 microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).
Preparation of viral vectors
High-titer lentiviral stocks pseudotyped with the vesicular sto-
matitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) were produced in HEK-293T
cells as previously described (46). In brief, HEK-293T cells were
transfected
with
lentiviral
transfer
construct
pLL3.7.hSyn.
BDNF.IRES.EGFP.WPRE or, pLL3.7.hSyn.EGFP.WPRE and packag-
ing constructs pMDLg-pRRE, pRSV-REV and pMD2.G envelope
protein construct, by means of calcium phosphate transfection.
Titers were determined by transducing HEK-293T cells with se-
rial dilutions of concentrated lentivirus. EGFP fluorescence was
evaluated by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems) at 72 h after transduction. The final
titer of lentiviruses for administration to the mice was deter-
mined by ELISA for p24, an abundant HIV-1 virus capsid protein
(Lenti-XTM p24 Rapid Titer Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
USA).
Administration of viral vectors
Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, mice were placed in a ste-
reotactic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA), and 108 viral vectors (either
BDNF-EGFP or EGFP alone) in 1-ml volume were injected into
each hippocampus bilaterally at 0.25 ll/min (Hamilton 701N sy-
ringe) to the following coordinates (relative to the bregma):
anterior-posterior,
-2mm;
medial-lateral, 61.6mm;
dorsal-
ventral, -2.5mm. The needle was withdrawn after 3 min.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the meanþ SEM. Statistical analyses
were performed using a commercial software (GraphPad Prism 6).
Comparisons
between
four
treatment
groups
(WTþ Vehicle,
WTþ THC, DN-DISC1þ Vehicle, DN-DISC1þ THC) were conducted
using a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.
Corrections for multiple comparisons were made when appropri-
ate. Comparison between two groups were conducted using two-
tailed t-test. For the electrophysiological study, two-way ANOVA
with repeated measures was conducted. Statistical significance
was considered for P < 0.05 in all statistical analyses.
