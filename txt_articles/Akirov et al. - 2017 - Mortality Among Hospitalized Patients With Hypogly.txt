Context: Hypoglycemia is common among hospitalized patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
Objective: Investigate the association between spontaneous or insulin-related hypoglycemia and
mortality in hospitalized patients.
Design: Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose ,70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l), including moderate
(40 to 70 mg/dl, 2.2 to 3.9 mmol/l) and severe hypoglycemia (,40 mg/dl, 2.2 mmol/l). Use of insulin
during hospitalization defined insulin-related hypoglycemia, thus patients were classified into
6 groups: non-insulin treated (NITC) and insulin-treated controls (ITC), insulin-related hypoglycemia
(IH) or severe hypoglycemia (ISH), and non insulin-related hypoglycemia (NIH) and severe hypo-
glycemia (NISH).
Setting and Patients: Historical prospectively data of patients $ 18 years of age, hospitalized in
medical wards for any cause between January 2011 and December 2013.
Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at the end of follow-up.
Results: The cohort included 33,675 patients, including 2605 with moderate hypoglycemia (IH, 1011;
NIH, 1594) and 342 with severe hypoglycemia (ISH, 201; NISH,141). Overall end-of-follow-up
mortality was 31.9% (NITC, 28.0%; ITC, 42.9%; NIH, 50.7%; IH, 55.3%; NISH, 70.9%; ISH, 69.1%).
Compared with NITC, unadjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for mortality were as
follows: ITC, 1.7 (1.6 to 1.8), NIH, 2.2 (2.0 to 2.4), IH, 2.5 (2.2 to 2.7), NISH, 4.2 (3.5 to 5.2), and ISH, 3.8
(3.2 to 4.5); with P , 0.001. Following multivariate analysis, respective hazard ratios were 1.8, 2.1,
2.4, 3.2, and 3.6 (P , 0.001). Cause of admission did not affect the association.
Conclusions: In hospitalized patients, hypoglycemia, either with insulin use or spontaneous, is associated
with increased short- and long-term mortality. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 416–424, 2017)

pontaneous and insulin-related hypoglycemia is
common among hospitalized patients with and with-
out diabetes mellitus (DM) (1, 2). The definition of
hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients is poorly defined;
thus, the true prevalence of hypoglycemia during hos-
pitalization is variable. The American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (ADA) defines hypoglycemia as blood glucose
levels ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and severe hypoglyce-
mia as hypoglycemia requiring assistance from another
person, characterized by cognitive impairment that may
be recognized or unrecognized and can progress to loss of
consciousness, seizure, coma, or death, and is reversed by
administration of rapid-acting glucose. As for hospitalized
patients, hypoglycemia is similarly defined as any blood
glucose level ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and severe hy-
poglycemia as a blood glucose level ,40 mg/dL (2.2
mmol/L) (3). The prevalence of hypoglycemia based on a
blood glucose value of ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) varies

 between 3.5% and 11% among noncritically ill patients
(1, 2, 4, 5).
The American Diabetes Association recommends initi-
ating insulin therapy for treatment of persistent hypergly-
cemia starting at a threshold of 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) and
higher, aiming at a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL
(7.8 to 10 mmol/L) for critically and noncritically ill
patients (3). However, in-hospital insulin therapy is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia (6). Inpatient
hypoglycemia is frequently asymptomatic; this is due to
hypoglycemia unawareness or altered consciousness asso-
ciated with acute illness or drug therapy (4). Hypoglycemia
is associated with several complications, including neuro-
logic and ischemic events, longer hospital stay, and an
increased mortality risk (1, 2, 7–13). Curkendall et al. (9)
reported that patients with any blood glucose value of ,70
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) had 7% higher odds of in-hospital
mortality compared with patients without hypoglycemia.
In this study, the association between spontaneous and
insulin-related hypoglycemia, including severe hypogly-
cemia and all-cause mortality, was evaluated among a
large cohort of hospitalized patients.
Methods
The study was conducted in a large, 1300-bed, university-
affiliated tertiary medical center. Most of the admissions to
the 10 medical wards are through the emergency department.
All patient data are recorded in electronic medical charts, which
are based on the same database platform used in the community
primary care facilities. Deaths are entered into the hospital’s
mortality database, which is updated according to the pop-
ulation registry of the Ministry of the Interior.
For the current study, historical, prospectively collected ob-
servational data were extracted from the medical records of all
patients who were admitted for any cause to the hospital’s medical
wards between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013. In patients
with multiple admissions, only the first admission was analyzed.
Mortality data were obtained up to 1 June 2015. Self-reported data
regarding alcohol use, smoking, and body mass index, as well as
comorbidities, were also collected from the database.
DM was defined as a previous diagnosis of DM in the medical
records or use of any oral hypoglycemic agent, glucagon-like
peptide 1 agonist, or insulin at the time of admission.
Blood glucose values were based on point-of-care bedside
measurements or serum glucose levels in venous samples. Hy-
poglycemia was defined as at least 1 blood glucose measurement
of ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); moderate hypoglycemia was defined
as blood glucose values between 40 and 70 mg/dL (2.2 to 3.9
mmol/L) during hospitalization; and severe hypoglycemia was
defined as blood glucose ,40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L). Hospitalized
patients without hypoglycemia (blood glucose .70 mg/dL
(3.9 mmol/L) served as control groups, and were classified into
2 groups: noninsulin-treated controls (NITC) and insulin-treated
controls (ITC). When hypoglycemia occurred during receipt of
insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia was assumed to be insulin
related (IH), and when no insulin was used, the hypoglycemia was
defined as noninsulin related (NIH). This same rule applied to
severe hypoglycemia, which was classified as insulin-related se-
vere hypoglycemia (ISH) and noninsulin-related severe hypo-
glycemia (NISH). Patients taking sulphonylureas and glinides at
admission were excluded, as well as patients with no blood
glucose measurement during the admission.
The primary outcome was risk of all-cause mortality at the
end of follow-up. The study was approved by the Rabin Medical
Center Institutional Review Board.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was generated using SAS software,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analysis of variance with
Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons was used to com-
pare continuous variables between groups, and logistic regression
with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons was used for
dichotomous variables. Median and mean survival times were
assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The Cox pro-
portional hazards model was used to assess overall survival
adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, DM, hypertension,
malignancy, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure,
cerebrovascular disease, and chronic renal failure. Two-sided
P values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant. We had
complete data for all of the study variables, other than alcohol
and smoking. No imputation for missing data was performed
because missing at random cannot be assumed.
Results
Study cohort
There were 73,796 admissions to the 10 medical wards
during the study period. After exclusion of repeat ad-
missions, patients with missing glucose levels, and pa-
tients treated with sulfonylurea or glinides, the final study
cohort consisted of 33,675 patients (Fig. 1). Of these,
17,274 (51%) were male, and the median age was 70
years (range, 18 to 108 years) at admission. According to
the medical records, 23,565 (70%) did not have preex-
isting DM, and 10,110 (30%) had DM. A total of 2893
patients (29%) with DM were treated with insulin prior
to admission. Median in-hospital glucose levels were
105 mg/dL (5.8 mmol/L) in patients without DM, and
154 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) in patients with DM.
All patients included in the study had at least 1 blood
glucose measurement during the admission. As shown in
Table 1, the median number of blood glucose measurements
was 3 in the NITC group and 12 in the ITC group. The
number of blood glucose measurements was higher for pa-
tients receiving insulin treatment compared with noninsulin-
treated patients. In all 3 groups of patients who received
insulin treatment during admission, the number of blood
glucose measurements was higher for patients without DM
compared with patients with DM. The opposite was true in
patients without insulin treatments during the admission.
A total of 2947 patients (9%) had at least 1 blood
glucose value of ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), including
2605 patients with blood glucose levels of 40 to 70 mg/dL

 (2.2 to 3.9 mmol/L), indicating moderate hypoglycemia,
and 342 patients with blood glucose values of ,40 mg/dL
(2.2 mmol/L), indicating severe hypoglycemia. A total of
4727 patients (14%) were treated with insulin during the
hospitalization, most of them with preexisting DM (4076
patients; 86%). The patients were dividedinto 6 groups: (1)
NITC (n = 27,213); (2) ITC (n = 3515); (3) NIH (n = 1594);
(4) IH (n= 1011); (5) NISH (n = 141); and (6) ISH(n = 201);
more patient details are provided in Fig. 1 and Table 1.
Rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, con-
gestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic
renal failure were considerably higher in the group of
insulin-treated patients compared with noninsulin-treated
patients. The characteristics of the patients by group are
shown in Table 1.
Almost half of the patients with hypoglycemia during
hospitalization did not have preexisting DM (1452 of
2947 patients; 49%). However, most of the patients with
severe hypoglycemia had preexisting DM (236 of 342
patients; 69%). Most of the patients with moderate hy-
poglycemia were not treated with insulin during the
hospitalization (1594 of 2605 patients; 61%), but most of
those with severe hypoglycemia received insulin treatment
during the hospitalization (201 of 342; 59%).
Median length of hospitalization was longer in pa-
tients with insulin-related hypoglycemia (7 days with
moderate hypoglycemia and 9 days with severe hypo-
glycemia), compared with patients without hypoglycemia
(3 and 4 days in noninsulin- and insulin-treated patients,
respectively; P , 0.001) and compared with patients with

 noninsulin-related hypoglycemia (5 days; P , 0.001) and
severe hypoglycemia (5 days; P = nonsignificant [NS]).
Mortality
Complete follow-up data at 12 months were available
for all patients; the first patient was censored after 1.4
years. Median follow-up time was 1022 days.
Overall in-hospital mortality was 6.3% (2105 of
33,675). Rates by group were as follows: NITC, 4.7%
(1267 of 27,213); ITC, 11.0% (387 of 3515); NIH,
13.9% (222 of 1594); IH, 12.9% (130 of 1011); NISH,
41.8% (59 of 141); ISH, 24.9% [50 of 201; Fig. 2(A)].
The overall mortality rate for the entire cohort at the
end of follow-up was 31.9% (10,743 of 33,675). Rates
by patient group were as follows: NITC, 28.0% (7628 of
27,213); ITC, 42.9% (1509 of 3515); NIH, 50.7% (808
of 1594); IH, 55.3% (559 of 1011); NISH, 70.9% (100 of
141); and ISH, 69.1% [139 of 201; Figs. 2(B) and 3].
The median survival time after discharge was signif-
icantly shorter in patients with severe hypoglycemia
compared with patients with moderate hypoglycemia:
NIH, 1048 days (range, 812 to 1266 days); IH, 734 days
(range, 588 to 973 days); ISH, 97 days (range, 45 to
288 days); NISH, 35 days (range, 1 to 156 days). Ac-
cordingly, the major increase in mortality was evident in
the first year after discharge; 1-year mortality rates were
40% and 41% for NIH and IH, respectively, compared
with 62% and 57% for NISH and ISH, respectively.
Compared with the NITC group, unadjusted hazard
ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for mortality at
the end of follow-up were as follows: ITC, 1.7 (1.6 to 1.8;
P , 0.001); NIH, 2.2 (2.0 to 2.4; P , 0.001); IH, 2.5 (2.2 to
2.7; P , 0.001); NISH, 4.2 (3.5 to 5.2; P , 0.001); and
ISH, 3.8 (3.2 to 4.5; P , 0.001). After adjustment for age,
sex, smoking, alcohol, DM, hypertension, malignancy,
ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebro-
vascular disease, and chronic renal failure, respective
hazard ratios were 1.8 (1.7 to 2.0; P , 0.001); 2.1 (1.9 to
2.2; P , 0.001); 2.4 (2.1 to 2.6; P , 0.001); 3.2 (2.6 to 3.8;
P , 0.001), and 3.6 (3.1 to 4.3; P , 0.001).
Compared with the ITC group, unadjusted hazard
ratios (95% CIs) for mortality at the end of follow-up
were as follows: NIH, 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4; P , 0.001); IH, 1.4
(1.3 to 1.6; P , 0.001); NISH, 2.5 (2.0 to 3.0; P , 0.001);
and ISH, 2.2 (1.9 to 2.7; P , 0.001). After adjustment,
respective hazard ratios were 1.1 (1.1 to 1.2; P , 0.01);
1.3 (1.2 to 1.4; P , 0.001); 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1; P , 0.001);
and 2.0 (1.7 to 2.4; P , 0.001). Compared with moderate
hypoglycemia, unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (95%
CIs) for mortality with severe hypoglycemia were 1.6 (1.3
to 1.9; P , 0.001) and 1.5 (1.3 to 1.9; P , 0.001) in patients
with insulin-associated hypoglycemia, and 1.9 (1.6 to 2.4;
P , 0.001) and 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9; P , 0.001) in pa-
tients with noninsulin-related hypoglycemia. The Kaplan-
Meier curves depict better survival with noninsulin-related
moderate hypoglycemia compared with insulin-related

 moderate hypoglycemia. However, in patients with
severe hypoglycemia, survival was better initially with
insulin-related hypoglycemia, but with longer follow-
up, the survival curves converged (Fig. 3).
Separate analysis of patients with DM and patients
without DM
In patients without DM, compared with the NITC
group, unadjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for mortality
at the end of follow-up were 2.3 (2.1 to 2.5; P , 0.001)
with NIH and 5.2 (4.0 to 6.7; P , 0.001) with NISH.
The respective adjusted hazard ratios were 2.3 (2.2 to
2.5; P , 0.001) and 3.9 (2.9 to 5.2; P , 0.001). In
patients with DM, compared with NITC, unadjusted
hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.9 (1.6 to 2.2; P , 0.001)
with NIH and 3.0 (2.2 to 4.1; P , 0.001) with NISH.
The respective adjusted hazard ratios were 1.6 (1.4 to
1.9; P , 0.001) and 2.7 (2.0 to 3.8; P , 0.001).
During admission, a total of 4727 patients were
treated with insulin, and 28,948 were not treated with
insulin. Mortality rates at the end of follow-up were
29.5% in noninsulin-treated patients compared with
46.6% in insulin-treated patients. When analyzed sepa-
rately, in patients without DM, mortality rates were
28.5% in noninsulin-treated patients (6544 of 22,914
patients) and 59.8% in insulin-treated patients (389 of
651 patients). In patients with DM, the respective mor-
tality rates were 33% (1992 of 6034 patients) and 44.6%
(1818 of 4076 patients).
Admission diagnosis
Admission diagnoses were available for 2643 of 2947
(90%) patients with hypoglycemia. The most common
diagnoses on admission in the entire cohort were in-
fectious diseases (845 of 2947 patients; 29%), diseases of
the circulatory system (432 of 2947 patients; 15%), and
diseases of the digestive system (223 of 2947 patients;
8%). Infectious diseases and diseases of the circulatory
system were also the most common admission diagnoses
in both groups of patients with hypoglycemia not related

group and in-hospital mortality was assessed by logistic regression. The overall significance of group was P , 0.001. The pairwise significance,
using Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons, was statistically significant for all comparisons (P , 0.05), other than the comparison of ITC
with IH (P = 0.59) and the comparison of IH with NIH (P = 0.97). The 30-day, 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival were estimated from the Kaplan-Meier
model depicted in Fig. 3. The significance of difference between groups was stated previously for this model.

Importance of Hypoglycemia With or Without Insulin

 to insulin (486 of 1505 patients; 32%; and 220 of 1505
patients; 15%), and patients with insulin-related hypo-
glycemia (359 of 1138 patients; 32%; and 212 of 1138
patients; 19%; Table 2). The cause of admission did not
significantly influence the association between hypogly-
cemia and mortality.
In patients admitted for infectious diseases and dis-
eases of the circulatory system, hazard ratios (95% CIs)
for mortality in patients with noninsulin-related hypo-
glycemia compared with insulin-related hypoglycemia
were 0.8 (0.7 to 1.1; P = NS) and 0.7 (0.5 to 1.1; P = NS),
respectively.
Discussion
This study indicated increased in-patient and post-
admission mortality risk in hospitalized patients with
blood glucose levels of ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), with
and without insulin therapy, compared with hospitalized
patients without hypoglycemia. In patients with mod-
erate hypoglycemia, the mortality risk was higher in
patients with insulin-related hypoglycemia compared
with those with noninsulin-related hypoglycemia, but in
those with severe hypoglycemia, mortality was increased
irrespective of insulin use. Mortality in patients with severe
hypoglycemia was most evident in the first months after
discharge, with median time to death of approximately
3 months with insulin-related severe hypoglycemia and
1 month with noninsulin-related severe hypoglycemia.
Analyzing the results according to admission diagnoses did
not prove a significant interaction between admission
diagnoses and study groups. Analyzing the data according
to DM status indicated moderate hypoglycemia was as-
sociated with a twofold increase in mortality compared
with noninsulin-treated controls, in patients with and
without DM. However, with severe hypoglycemia, the
increase in mortality was significantly higher in patients
without DM (fourfold increase after adjustment), com-
pared with patients with DM (less than threefold increase).
In accordance with previous studies, in our cohort, 9%
of the patients hospitalized in medical wards had at least 1
episode of hypoglycemia, mostly moderate hypoglycemia
(88%) (1, 2, 4). Twenty-six percent of patients treated with
insulin during hospitalization developed hypoglycemia,
including 4% with severe hypoglycemia. Umpierrez et al.
(14) reported that 23% of surgical patients with DM who
received a basal-bolus insulin regimen developed hypo-
glycemia. Farrokhi et al. (15) reported that 19% of
noncritically ill medical patients with DM developed
moderate hypoglycemia during inpatient subcutaneous
insulin therapy; 2% of these were documented as having
severe hypoglycemia.
In our study, 41% of all hypoglycemic events were
associated with insulin, whereas 59% of severe hypogly-
cemia events were associated with insulin. These rates of
noninsulin-related hypoglycemia are in line with previous
Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier analysis of patients after discharge. Patient survival was analyzed as time until death; observations were censored at the
end of follow-up (P , 0.05).

 studies that reported that about one-half of hypoglycemic
events occur in patients with DM or with insulin therapy,
but are higher compared with other reports (1, 16–18).
These differences may result from variable definitions of
hypoglycemia or the study population.
Many factors may contribute to development of hy-
poglycemia in the hospital setting, including poor nu-
trition, renal failure, heart failure, advanced liver disease,
advanced age, infections, and the intensity of the treat-
ment regimen (6, 19–21). Accordingly, the most common
admission diagnoses in the total cohort of patients with
hypoglycemia, with and without insulin treatment, were
infectious diseases and diseases of the circulatory system.
Most studies have reported that noninsulin-related hy-
poglycemia is associated with increased mortality compared
with insulin-related hypoglycemia (22–25). Our results in-
dicate that with a median follow-up of almost 3 years,
patientswithmoderatehypoglycemiaduringhospitalization
had a more than twofold increase in mortality compared
with patients without hypoglycemia, and severe hypogly-
cemia was associated with a threefold increase in mortality.
However, in patients with severe hypoglycemia, there was
no difference in mortality whether or not the hypoglycemia
was insulin related. The increase in in-hospital mortality was
much more significant in noninsulin-treated patients with
severe hypoglycemia, with a ninefold increase in mortality
compared with noninsulin-treated controls (41.2% vs
4.7%). Even a single blood glucose measurement of 40 to
70 mg/dL (2.2 to 3.9 mmol/L) during admission, in
noninsulin-treated patients, was associated with a threefold
increase in in-hospital mortality risk. There are several
possible explanations for the association between hypogly-
cemia and mortality. First, hypoglycemia may lead directly
to death, because low blood glucose levels could potentially
trigger fatal arrhythmia, seizures, or stroke. However, this
does not account for the increased long-term mortality risk
evident in our study. Second, increased mortality rates as-
sociated with inpatient hypoglycemia may merely reflect the
association between hypoglycemia and more severe illness
(1, 2, 22, 25). Another possibility is that, after a hypogly-
cemic episode, higher glucose targets are often set due to fear
of a recurrent hypoglycemic episode, and this may lead to a
higher rate of metabolic complications in the future.
Insulin treatment during admission was associated
with increased mortality at the end of follow-up. In pa-
tients without DM, mortality rates were 2 times higher in
insulin-treated compared with noninsulin-treated pa-
tients (59.8% vs 28.5%). Lower risk was evident in
patients with DM (44.6% vs 33%). Previous observa-
tional and randomized controlled trials have indicated
increased mortality risk with inpatient hyperglycemia in
both patients with and without DM (26–28). Given that
the ADA guidelines recommend insulin therapy in hos-
pitalized patients with hyperglycemia, it is possible that
the cause of hyperglycemia, leading to insulin therapy,
may contribute to the increased mortality risk.
Our study has several limitations. One of the main
limitations is the assumption that hypoglycemia in insulin-
treated patients was insulin associated, although we did not
have information about the temporal relation between
insulin injection and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, the
clinical presentation of hypoglycemia, if at all present, was
not recorded in the database. Because there is a considerable
variability in definitions of hypoglycemia, our analysis was
based on thedefinition used bythe ADA. Another limitation
is that data regarding comorbidities was based solely on the
medical records, and smoking and alcohol habits were
based on self-report. A further limitation is that patients

 with a prior history of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
have a greater chance of having their blood glucose mea-
sured more often, with a higher probability of detecting
hypoglycemia.
We based the definition of hypoglycemia on either ve-
nous blood test or glucometer readings, and in most of the
patients, low blood glucose was recorded in both bedside
glucometers and venous blood samples. Glucose moni-
toring during hospitalization is the standard of care for
patients with DM, allowing identification of hypoglycemic
events. However, given that in patients without DM, the
use of bedside glucometers is not as common, and many
low blood glucose measurements are identified incidentally
in routine blood work, we based our findings on this
measurement as well. It should be noted that most patients
are treated immediately for hypoglycemia in the event of a
low blood glucose reading with a bedside glucometer,and a
venous blood sample maybe obtained only later and would
thus show a normal or even high glucose level.
The major strengths of our study are the large cohort and
long-term follow-up, as well as our historical, prospectively
collected data that shows the actual treatment of patients
admitted to medical wards, as opposed to data from pro-
spective randomized controlled studies in which patients
undergo intensive monitoring and treatment adjustments.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that hypoglycemia,
whether insulin related or noninsulin related, is associated
with increased short- and long-term mortality risk. Mortality
risk is higher in insulin-treated patients with moderate hy-
poglycemia compared with patients without insulin treat-
ment who have similar glucose values. However, with severe
hypoglycemia, there was no significant difference between
insulin-related and noninsulin-related hypoglycemia.
