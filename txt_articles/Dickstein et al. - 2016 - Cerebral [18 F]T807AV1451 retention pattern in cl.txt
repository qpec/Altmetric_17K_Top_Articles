Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder most commonly associated with repetitive traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, known as a tauopathy. Currently, the
diagnosis of CTE can only be definitively established postmortem. However, a new positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [18F]
T807/AV1451, may provide the antemortem detection of tau aggregates, and thus various tauopathies, including CTE. Our goal was
to examine [18F]T807/AV1451 retention in athletes with neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with a history of multiple
concussions. Here we report a 39-year-old retired National Football League player who suffered 22 concussions and manifested
progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms. Emotional lability and irritability were the chief complaints. Serial neuropsychological
exams revealed a decline in executive functioning, processing speed and fine motor skills. Naming was below average but other
cognitive functions were preserved. Structural analysis of longitudinally acquired magenetic resonance imaging scans revealed
cortical thinning in the left frontal and lateral temporal areas, as well as volume loss in the basal ganglia. PET with [18F]florbetapir
was negative for amyloidosis. The [18F]T807/AV1451 PET showed multifocal areas of retention at the cortical gray matter–white
matter junction, a distribution considered pathognomonic for CTE. [18F]T807/AV1451 standard uptake value (SUV) analysis showed
increased uptake (SUVr ⩾ 1.1) in bilateral cingulate, occipital, and orbitofrontal cortices, and several temporal areas. Although
definitive identification of the neuropathological underpinnings basis for [18F]T807/AV1451 retention requires postmortem
correlation, our data suggest that [18F]T807/AV1451 tauopathy imaging may be a promising tool to detect and diagnose CTE-
related tauopathy in living subjects.

INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of
developing
dementia,
including
Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD).1,2
However, recent research in postmortem samples suggests that
a
separate
neurodegenerative
syndrome,
chronic
traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE), might be the cause of decline in some
individuals
who
have
sustained
both
single
and
multiple
concussive and subconcussive blows to the head.3,4 CTE, which
was first observed in ‘punch drunk’ boxers5 and termed ‘dementia
pugilistica’,6 is a neurodegenerative disease seen in individuals
with a history of repetitive brain trauma, that is, blows to the head.
CTE is characterized neuropathologically by progressive deposi-
tion of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau.4
Amyloidosis is a less consistent feature, present in only half of
the cases of CTE examined at postmortem. The tauopathy shows
a particular perivascular, sulcal, and neocortical distribution,
distinguishing CTE from AD and other tauopathies.4,7,8 CTE also
involves widespread axonal disruption, with eventual degenera-
tion of the neocortex, hippocampus and other limbic structures,
and basal forebrain.7,9
Clinically, individuals with CTE can display symptoms that
overlap with those seen in AD, such as impairments in memory
and executive function, but, in contrast to AD, CTE is more
frequently characterized by irritability, emotional lability, aggres-
sion, impulsivity, suicidality and substance abuse.7,10,11 Changes in
mood and behavior typically precede cognitive decline in CTE,
although clinical presentation is highly variable.7,11Although
individuals with CTE are at risk for severe functional impairment
as well as disabling and life-threatening behavioral disturbances;
currently, the disease can only be definitively diagnosed at
postmortem.11 Because of this limitation, the discovery of reliable
and valid body fluid and/or neuroimaging biomarkers is crucial to

 developing diagnostic specificity and identifying the underlying
pathology in order to track and treat these individuals during life.
Current estimates of prevalence based solely on neuropsycholo-
gical exams or solely on neuropathology are each inherently
susceptible to certain biases that could be mitigated with a
reliable molecular biomarker.
Currently, little is known about the progression of CTE
pathology in vivo. Attempts to detect CTE in living individuals
have been challenging. Clinical symptoms are often based on the
retrospective reports of family members after the loss of a loved
one with suspected pathology, and common signs overlap with
those seen in other neurodegenerative disorders.7,12 Standard
neuroimaging often reveals no gross lesions.13 However, neurop-
sychological testing can detect subtle changes in cognition, and
recent studies of retired athletes with a history of concussions
have
revealed
focal
impairments
in
episodic
memory,14–16
executive function,14 naming15 and semantic fluency.16 In addi-
tion, the identification of biomarkers, such as levels of serum
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau17,18 and CSF neurofilament
proteins,18 have shown promise in detecting peripheral changes
that may appear when CTE or other tauopathy is present.
Although studies examining blood and CSF levels of tau and
other neuronal injury markers after acute TBI have been mixed (for
reviews see refs 19,20), a recent study of professional hockey
players showed that total serum level of tau increased after
concussion and was correlated with clinical outcome.17
Structural imaging can also aid in the diagnosis of CTE. Studies
using diffuse tensor imaging have shown that diffusion abnorm-
alities, representing microstructural white matter damage, may be
associated with repetitive TBI (reviewed in ref. 13). In addition, a
handful of cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
studies showing ventricular enlargement and cortical thinning
after
mild
TBI,21
including
in
childhood
athletes,22
retired
professional athletes16 and military veterans,23,24 appear to
support postmortem findings. However, we are unaware of any
longitudinal studies that have examined structural changes in MRI
in individuals with a history of repetitive mild TBI.
Molecular imaging is also a promising tool in detecting CTE
pathology in vivo. [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) amyloid
imaging has revealed increased ligand binding following acute
TBI, which appears to be greatest immediately (hours) following
the injury and gradually decreases over time.25 The residual
amyloid
present
in
some
individuals
1-year
post-TBI
may
(dependent on their age) reflect slowed clearance of acutely
deposited amyloid, evolution to AD or evolution to CTE. In
addition, in vivo detection of brain deposits of tau, the hallmark of
CTE, is now possible through the use of novel positron emission
tomography (PET) radiotracers. One ligand, [18F]T807 (also known
as AV1451), has a high affinity and selectivity for tau over amyloid-
β peptide (Aβ)26 and has demonstrated utility in revealing
tauopathy in a variety of pathologies, including AD, frontotem-
poral dementia and CTE.27–29 We have previously reported the
case of a 71-year-old retired National Football League (NFL) player
with suspected CTE and a brain PET scan showing [18F]T807/
AV1451 retention in the globus pallidus, putamen, substantia
nigra
and
hippocampus.
[18F]florbetapir
PET
imaging
was
negative, excluding the presence of the cerebral amyloidosis thus
also excluding the diagnosis of AD.27 Another study that used [18F]
T807/AV1451 imaging in a patient at risk for CTE revealed focal
[18F]T807/AV1451 retention in the left anterior temporal lobe but
no evidence of amyloidosis based on [11C]PiB PET.30 Additional
studies are needed to determine whether positive [18F]T807/AV1451
imaging: (1) reliably reflects in vivo tauopathy with sufficient speci-
ficity for that proteinopathy; (2) reveals patterns distinct from other
tauopathies; and (3) correlates with current or future clinical status.
In this study, we present the case of a 39-year-old retired NFL
player with severe functional complaints and suspected CTE
whose [18F]T807/AV1451 imaging results are strikingly similar to
well-established postmortem patterns of tau deposition,4 suggest-
ing that this novel ligand may be useful in diagnosing CTE. In
particular, the presence of perivascular tauopathy at the depths of
the cerebral cortical sulci has been determined to be pathogno-
monic for CTE by a recent National Institute on Neurological
Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) neuropathology.4 We also present
longitudinal neuropsychological and structural MRI data revealing
patterns that may aid in understanding disease progression and
further inform the development of diagnostic criteria. Despite the
promise of this technique and the potential import of our ‘index
subject’, it is important to note that definitive radiological–
pathological correlation will be required in order to establish that
CTE tauopathy is indeed the basis for cerebral [18F]T807/AV1451
retention in subjects such as the retired athlete presented herein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical and experimental structural brain imaging
The 2011 MRI was obtained on a 3-Tesla Siemens Verio MR system
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at a Quest Imaging
Center. Sequences included high-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE images
(TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.1 ms, 160 sagittal slices, 1.2 mm slice thickness, voxel-
size of 1.33 × 1.33 × 1.2 mm3, flip angle = 9°). The 2015 MRI was obtained on
a 3-Tesla Siemens Biograph MR system at the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai (ISMMS) Hess Center for Science and Medicine. Comparable
high-resolution
T1-weighted
MPRAGE
images
were
acquired
(TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, 176 sagittal slices, 1.2 mm slice thickness,
voxel-size of 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm3, flip angle = 9°). The duration of time between
the two scans was 3.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of cortical thickness and
subcortical volume was performed using the FreeSurfer reconstruction
pipeline (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu, version 5.3.0). Processing of
individual time points included removal of non-brain tissue, automated
Talairach transformation and intensity normalization, and detection of gray
matter/white matter and gray matter/cerebrospinal fluid boundaries.
Cortical thickness was calculated as the distance between these tissue
boundaries (white matter and pial surfaces). The reconstructed surface
models produced by the pipeline were inspected visually for accuracy and
corrected manually using FreeSurfer’s FreeView software (http://surfer.nmr.
mgh.harvard.edu, version 5.3.0) as needed. Longitudinal processing
included creating an unbiased within-subject base template from both
time points and then using common information from the template to
perform atlas registration, spherical surface map creation, and subcortical
parcellation to extract reliable volume and thickness estimates.31,32
Clinical and experimental molecular brain imaging
[18F]Florbetapir imaging was conducted with a Siemens mCT 40-slice
4RPET/CT camera (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The patient
was injected with 370 MBq (10 mCi) of [18F]florbetapir. Image acquisition
began ~ 50 min post injection and lasted for 20 min. Images were acquired
in three dimensions, using a one-frame and one-bed position TOF Dynamic
All PASS filter. Reconstruction was performed with a 400 matrix utilizing
iterative reconstruction, with 24 subsets and 4 iterations. The z axis filter
was standard, summed images 5.0 mm full width/half maximum Gaussian
filter was used. The field of view was 50 cm in diameter, with 74 total slices.
[18F]T807/AV1451 imaging was acquired and reconstructed using the same
parameters as the [18F]florbetapir scan. After an appropriate washout
period, the patient was injected with 370 MBq (10 mCi) of [18F]T807/
AV1451. Image acquisition began ~ 80 min post injection and lasted for
20 min. A total of 74 axial slices of 3 mm thickness were displayed for
visual interrogation by a nuclear medicine physician.
For [18F]florbetapir analysis, standard uptake value (SUV) ratios (SUVr)
were calculated by dividing the mean uptake in an analysis region by the
mean uptake in a reference region. Six predefined anatomically relevant
cortical regions of interest (frontal, temporal, parietal, precuneus, anterior
cingulate and posterior cingulate) were used as analysis regions with the
whole cerebellum used as a reference region.33 Calculations were
performed using MIM software (MIM Software Version 6.1, MIM Software,
Cleveland, OH, USA), which has a semi-automatic program for [18F]
florbetapir SUVr calculation using three standard PET templates: normal,
mild cognitive impairment and AD.34
For [18F]T807/AV1451 analysis, PET and T1-MPRAGE images were brain
extracted using the FSL Brain Extraction Tool.35 Next, the subject’s PET and

 MR were coregistered followed by alignment to the MNI brain template
using FSL FLIRT.36 An MNI-Brodmann area atlas was used to extract mean
PET intensity values within each area. In addition, mean PET intensity
values were derived from subcortical region-of-interests defined by the
Harvard–Oxford subcortical structural atlas and the Talairach atlas. In
accordance with the standard practice of tauopathy PET, regional SUVrs
were calculated using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region.27,37
RESULTS
Clinical presentation
A 39-year-old retired professional football player sustained 22
concussions, four of which resulted in loss of consciousness,
during an 11-year career as an NFL player (Figure 1). He presented
with complaints of irritability, emotional lability and cognitive
decline. Following an informed consent process approved by the
local institutional review board, he was evaluated at ISMMS in
2015 as part of a larger study comparing individuals with a history
of multiple concussions to healthy controls and individuals with
mild cognitive impairment with no concussion history. He also
released to ISMMS investigators the medical records from his 2010
evaluation
at
the
Boston
University
Center
for
Traumatic
Encephalopathy. Evaluation at ISMMS included comprehensive
neurologic and neuropsychological assessment, a structural 3 T
MRI scan, a clinical [18F]florbetapir PET scan to determine the
presence or absence of amyloid, and a research PET scan using the
novel [18F]T807/AV1451 tau ligand to determine the possible
presence of tauopathy.
Concussion history was determined based on an in-depth
interview performed in 2010 by a neurologist specializing in TBI
and CTE. An abbreviated version of the Brain Injury Screening
Questionnaire38 was administered in 2015 and corroborated the
2010 report. Detailed information was obtained about reported
concussions, including their approximate date, descriptions of the
events,
and
the
nature
and
duration
of
immediate
post-
concussion symptoms (for example, confusion, disorientation,
retrograde and/or anterograde amnesia, loss of consciousness).
Total number of games played was also recorded, as this
information may reflect history of exposure to subconcussive
impacts (Figure 1). Concussions were classified according to
guidelines developed by the American Academy of Neurology.39
On the basis of these criteria, the evaluators determined that the
patient experienced 22 concussive events, 20 of which were Grade
II, one Grade I, and one Grade III. Four of the concussive events
resulted in loss of consciousness. The last recorded concussion
occurred ~ 9 months before the 2010 neuropsychological testing.
Detailed neurological examinations were conducted in 2010 and
2015 and were normal. In addition, APOE genotyping from 2010
showed a genotype of ε3/ε3.
Over the past several years, including prior to his retirement, the
subject noticed difficulties with concentration and memory,
particularly in short-term memory; the severity of his deficit was
sufficient to affect his activities of daily living. In addition to
memory complaints, the subject also reported numerous beha-
vioral and functional symptoms such as increased agitation,
irritability, impulsivity, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances,
and increased sensitivity to noise. At the time of the 2010
evaluation, he reported experiencing ‘mild’ feelings of being
slowed cognition, headache irritability, poor concentration, and
sensitivity to light. In the 2015 evaluation in clinical interview, the
most prominent symptom was irritability. He also reported
depression that occurred within the last 2 years and anxiety.
The Beck Depression Inventory from 2015 was 24, indicating
moderate depression. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was com-
pleted in 2015 by his wife who endorsed severe irritability,
moderate agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, disinhibi-
tion and sleep disturbance and mild delusional beliefs, anxiety and
elation. His Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) from 2015 was 0.5 and
mild problems with memory, judgment and problem solving,
community affairs and home and hobbies were endorsed. A
functional questionnaire from 2015 identified difficulty with
assembling tax and business records, shopping alone, remember-
ing to turn off the stove and keeping appointments.
Clinical and research neuropsychological assessment
Neuropsychological status was assessed in 2010 and 2015 and
with structured surveys including: the Rivermead Post Concussion
Symptom Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the CDR and the Functional
Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).
The patient had 16 years of education. Premorbid intelligence,
assessed by the Wide Range Achievement Test, was estimated to
be in the superior range. Using available norms, neuropsycholo-
gical tests, both from current assessment and previous testing
identified in the medical records, were reported as z-scores. Using
this method, comparison of scores from 2010 to 2015 showed a
decline in executive functioning, processing speed and fine motor
function (Table 1). Additional tests given only in 2015 showed
below-average performance only in lexical retrieval. Performance
was average or above average for long- and short-term verbal
memory, working memory and semantic fluency, despite self-
reported
severe
impairment
with
working
memory
and
distractibility.
Clinical and experimental structural brain imaging
Extended clinical and experimental structural brain imaging
methods appear in the Materials and Methods section earlier in
the text.
Both the 2011 and the 2015 MRI were evaluated by a
neuroradiologist and were read clinically as within normal limits
with no obvious atrophy or lesions. Comparison cortical thickness
measures derived from 3D T1 weighted MRI sequences acquired
in 2011 and 2015 showed diffuse cortical thinning in both
hemispheres (Figure 2), with the greatest thinning (42% change)
in the left inferior frontal gyrus corresponding to Broca’s area,
medial orbitofrontal cortex, mid-temporal gyrus, and the temporal
pole (Figure 2). Thickness increases 42% were found in the left
lateral occipital gyrus and the right rostral frontal gyrus (Figure 2).
Comparison of 2011 and 2015 MRI scans also showed a negative
trend with respect to volume of deep gray matter structures, with
the largest decreases seen in the basal ganglia (globus pallidus,
putamen and nucleus accumbens). Increases in volume were
found in bilateral lateral ventricles and in summed left hemisphere
Virchow–Robin spaces (Figure 3).

 Clinical and experimental molecular brain imaging
Extended clinical and experimental molecular brain imaging
methods appear in the Materials and Methods section earlier in
the text.
The clinical [18F]florbetapir scan was rated by nuclear medicine
physicians trained to interpret [18F]florbetapir images using a
binary (positive or negative) visual approach.40 Transaxial, coronal
and sagittal images were examined. The scan results were
considered positive if uptake in the cerebral gray matter equaled
or exceeded the uptake in the white matter in at least two major
areas of the brain. A positive [18F]florbetapir scan indicates
moderate-to-frequent fibrillar amyloid plaques; a negative [18F]
florbetapir scan indicates sparse-to-no fibrillar amyloid plaques,
which is inconsistent with a diagnosis of AD. In our subject the
[18F]florbetapir PET scan was negative for cerebral amyloidosis
(Figure 3), thereby excluding AD as a cause of his cognitive
decline. The global cortical SUVr calculated for the [18F]florbetapir
scan was 0.929, which is below the published cutoff of 1.1 and
reflects absence of amyloidosis.41–43
Experimental tauopathy imaging was performed using [18F]
T807/AV1451. As noted above, this ligand has a high affinity and
selectivity for tauopathy over fibrillar deposits of Aβ26 and has
demonstrated utility in revealing tauopathy in a variety of
pathologies,
including
AD,
frontotemporal
dementia
and
CTE.27–29 Visual assessment of the [18F]T807/AV1451 PET scan
revealed multiple areas of retention of [18F]T807/AV1451 through-
out the cerebral cortex particularly at the gray–white matter
junctions (Figure 4). Signal increases were also apparent in the
midbrain, globus pallidus, and hippocampus. In addition, quanti-
fication of the scan was performed by spatially normalizing the
PET image to a T1 MRI structural image and applying region-of-
interest templates (see Materials and Methods) for extraction on
regional SUVs. Brain SUVs were divided by the cerebellar cortex
SUV to calculate SUVr in multiple cortical and subcortical regions
(Table 2). Because no standard SUVr cutoff value has been
established for [18F]T807/AV1451 imaging in CTE or other
conditions, we used the cutoff of 1.1 established in the AD [18F]
florbetapir literature41–43 to identify regions of increased ligand
uptake. This cutoff is likely conservative for [18F]T807/AV1451, as
cerebellar deposition of tau in CTE7 will lead to underestimated
SUV ratios; indeed, in the current individual, [F18]T807/AV1451
ligand uptake was seen in the cerebellum. Cortical regions of
increased uptake were found in cingulate cortex (Brodmann areas
23, 24), retrosplenial cortex (areas 26, 29, 30), occipital cortex
(areas 17, 18, 19), primary auditory (areas 41, 42), parietotemporal
gyrus (area 39)44 the temporal pole (area 38), hippocampal
formation (areas 27, 34) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex
(area
47);
these
localized
findings
were
similar
bilaterally.
Subcortical regions of increased uptake were found in the
putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens,

 and substantia nigra, again with similar findings in both hemi-
spheres. Several of these regions (temporal pole, orbitofrontal
cortex, putamen,
globus
pallidus
and nucleus
accumbens),
corresponded to the areas of cortical thinning and subcortical
volume loss observed in the structural analyses (Figures 2 and 3).
Other investigators using several tau ligands including [F18]T807/
AV1451 have observed similar retention patterns, and they, too,
have interpreted this retention as nonspecific and/or due to local
concentrations of tissue monamine oxidase.44,45 Indeed, in a
typical healthy control studied at our site, nonspecific ligand
uptake was observed in the substantia nigra and hippocampus,
with no cortical uptake.
DISCUSSION
We present the case of a 39-year-old retired professional athlete
with a history of multiple concussions that developed emotional
lability,
behavioral
disturbances
and
cognitive
impairment.
Although neuropsychological testing revealed high levels of
function in multiple domains, executive function, processing
speed, and motor speed declined over that time, and naming
was below average. This pattern is similar to findings from
previous neuropsychological studies in retired athletes with a
history of concussions.14–16 The patient performed in the average-
to-superior range on several tests of short-term memory, despite
reporting problems with working memory in his daily life.
Difficulties with attention and distractibility may explain these
complaints, as he reported attention and concentration problems
and was medically treated for these symptoms. Further neurop-
sychological testing specifically examining aspects of attention
may disambiguate the underlying cause of poor performance. The
neuropsychological battery identified a pattern different from
other neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (unlikely at age 39
years). The presence of aggression, irritability and disinhibition
reflect a triad of seriously disabling symptoms. In addition,
relatively new onset of depression with anxiety was noted.
Altogether, these neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms
undoubtedly contribute to the significant functional impairment
reported in 2015.
Analysis of structural brain changes suggests diffuse atrophy,
most prominently seen within the frontal lobe, basal ganglia and
lateral temporal lobe, with apparent sparing of the medial
temporal lobes. Thinning in Broca’s area (Figure 2), which has
been implicated in word production and lexical retrieval,46,47 may
account for the striking impairment seen in the Boston Naming
Test, one of the patient’s lowest scores. Circuits involving the
frontal cortex and the basal ganglia have also been shown to be
involved in lexical retrieval,48 as well as executive function.49,50 As
such, the atrophy seen in the basal ganglia and the medial and
lateral frontal cortex may contribute to the patient’s difficulties in
these domains and may contribute to the reduced motor speed
and feeling ‘slowed down’ along with other disabling behavioral
symptoms. Thinning in the left orbitofrontal cortex and temporal
pole (Figure 2) may underlie the patient’s complaint of impulsivity.
A recent study examining athletes with a history of multiple
concussions found that cortical thinning in the orbitofrontal cortex
and temporal pole (and decreased diffusivity in the uncinate
fasciculus, the white matter tract that connects them) correlated
with errors on a go/no-go task and a measure of aggression.51
Little hippocampal or medial temporal lobe atrophy was found,
consistent with the high scores seen in the delayed recall tests.
Overall, these structural findings are in accord with the few brain-
wide cross-sectional studies wherein cortical thickness was
examined in brain images from subjects exposed to sports or
military-related mild TBI.
The pattern of ligand binding in the [18F]T807/AV1451 tau PET
scan suggests extensive tauopathy deposition, particularly at the
gray–white matter boundary. We were especially struck by the
apparent similarity of [18F]T807/AV1451 retention in this subject
with the recent recognition by an NINDS CTE neuropathology
consensus panel that tauopathy at the depths of the cerebral
cortical sulci is pathognomonic for CTE.4 This single feature of our
PET images is important not only for its apparent mirroring of the
hallmark distribution of the tauopathy of CTE, but this juxtacortical
distribution of ligand retention does not obviously invoke an

 immediate

regarding
off-target
ligand
retention.52
Indeed, although the signal in the globus pallidus may reflect
nonspecific retention of [18F]T807/AV1451,52 the accompanying
volume decreases seen in the globus pallidus of this patient
suggest involvement of this structure in his disease process. These
areas may contribute to the behavioral dysregulation noted in this
patient. Our previous report of a 71-year-old retired NFL player
who also had a negative amyloid scan did exhibit more focal [18F]
T807/AV1451 binding in basal ganglia and hippocampus with
minimal binding in the neocortex.27 That patient presented with
hypomimia, greater memory impairment and fewer behavioral
symptoms than the present case. The findings in the present
subject with relatively mild to moderate symptoms suggest that
this ligand may be useful in detecting CTE tauopathy in vivo, in at
least some patients. The success in visualizing [18F]T807/AV1451
retention
in
a
pattern
that
is
associated
with
a
singular
neuropathological signature in this 39-year-old subject with mild
to moderate symptoms is especially important in light of recent
pathologically confirmed case of CTE in a 25-year-old former
college football player.3,5,53 Both the current case and the 25-year-
old case published by Mez et al. showed contemporaneous clinical
signs of CTE. Our patient also emphasizes the prominent
psychiatric component of the presentation and the recovery of a
striking image despite highly functional status. This raises the
possibility that tauopathy imaging could inform decisions of
whether to initiate or continue engagement in high-risk activities
and/or or as an outcome for anti-tauopathy therapies to interrupt
the degenerative process. We would like to restate the point that
despite the promise of this technique and the potential import of
our ‘index subject’, it is important to note that definitive
radiological–pathological correlation will be required in order
to establish that CTE tauopathy is indeed the basis for cerebral
[18F]T807/AV1451 retention in subjects such as the retired
athlete presented herein. The achievement of this goal with
[18F]T807/AV1451 is more challenging than was the case with
florbetapir in AD. CTE patients are often younger than AD patients,
and encountering CTE patients within the final year of life so
that one might obtain both [18F]T807/AV1451 imaging and

characteristic of the distribution of tauopathy in CTE. The PET scales represent ligand uptake in Bq/ml. CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy;

 postmortem neuropathology from the same subject will not be
easily achieved.
Another recent study using a different ligand, [18F]FDDNP,
reported that professional athletes with a history of multiple
concussions had increased ligand retention compared with
controls in several cortical and subcortical regions, including the
medial temporal lobe, striatum and frontal cortex. Only increased
signal in the midbrain and amygdala were found in all 14 of the
athletes.37 All athletes but one in this study were also diagnosed
with mild cognitive impairment, but patterns of [18F]FDDNP
uptake were able to distinguish between the athletes and an AD
group, particularly in subcortical regions, whereas cortical regions,
particularly the medial temporal lobe, showed overlap between
the CTE and AD groups. However, participants in this study did not
undergo amyloid PET scans, an important point because [18F]FDDNP
is reported to have a relatively low affinity for tauopathy
neurofibrillary tangles and a low specificity for tauopathy over
amyloid;54–56 indeed, [18F]FDDNP is considered to bind to some
degree to both amyloidosis and tauopathy. Thus, further research
using agents like [18F]T807/AV1451 and [18F]florbetapir that have a
high selectivity and specificity for particular proteinopathies are
needed to clarify the burden of tauopathy and amyloidosis
separately, both to understand the disease process better and to
facilitate differential diagnosis. Indeed, one recent study that
examined [18F]T807/AV1451 in an MCI/AD cohort revealed a
pattern of tauopathy deposition that was concentrated mainly in
the inferior temporal gyrus and corresponded to Braak staging
regional distribution,57 distinct from the pattern found here,
suggesting that [18F]T807/AV1451 may be useful not only in detect-
ing tauopathy but in differentiating among tauopathies. These are
early days in the in vivo detection of these complex degenerative
disorders, and much additional investigation is required. To that end,
though we have primarily discussed [18F]T807/AV1451, however,
there are a host of other tauopathy ligands in the pipeline. For a
review on Tau PET imaging see refs 58, 59.
In closing, we would like to restate the point that, despite the
promise of this technique and the potential import of our ‘index
subject’, it is important to note that definitive radiological–
pathological correlation will be required in order to establish that
CTE tauopathy is indeed the basis for cerebral [18F]T807/AV1451
retention in subjects such as the retired athlete presented herein.
As also noted above, the achievement of this goal with [18F]T807/
AV1451 is more challenging than was the case with florbetapir in
AD. CTE patients are often younger than AD patients, and
encountering CTE patients within the final year of life so that one
might obtain both [18F]T807/AV1451 imaging and postmortem
neuropathology from the same subject will not be easily achieved.
This case provides a window into the neuropsychiatric and
structural progression of CTE and suggests that [18F]T807/AV1451
tauopathy imaging is a potentially promising tool to detect CTE-
related neuropathology in vivo in at least some patients. Further
research comparing [18F]T807/AV1451 results in CTE to healthy
controls and other tauopathies will clarify whether there is a
signature pattern that can be attributed to CTE, and thus whether
and under what conditions tauopathy imaging can be used
clinically
to
identify
and
track
progression
of
CTE-related
neurodegeneration.
