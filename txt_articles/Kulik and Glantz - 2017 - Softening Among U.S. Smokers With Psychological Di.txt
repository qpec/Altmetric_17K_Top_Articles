Abstract
Introduction—It has been argued that as smoking prevalence declines, the remaining smokers 
represent a “hard core” who are unwilling or unable to quit, a process known as hardening. 
However, as recently shown, the general smoking population is softening not hardening (i.e., as 
prevalence falls more quit attempts and lower consumption among continuing smokers). People 
with psychological distress smoke more, so they may represent hard core smokers.
Methods—Using cross-sectional time series analysis, in 2016–2017 changes in quit attempts and 
cigarette consumption were evaluated over 19 years among smokers with serious psychological 
distress (Kessler-6 score ≥13) based on the National Health Interview Survey (1997–2015), 
controlling for sociodemographic variables.
Results—People with psychological distress had higher prevalence and consumed more 
cigarettes/day than people without distress. The percentage of those with at least one quit attempt 
was higher among those with psychological distress. The increase in quit attempts over time was 
similar among smokers in each of the distress levels. For every 10 years the OR of a quit attempt 
increased by a factor of 1.13 (95% CI=1.02, 1.24, p<0.05). Consumption declined by 3.35 (95% 
CI= −3.94, −2.75, p<0.01) cigarette/day for those with serious psychological distress.
Conclusions—Although smoking more heavily than the general population, smokers with 
psychological distress, like the general population, are softening over time. To improve health 
outcomes and increase health equity, tobacco control policies should continue moving all 
subgroups of smokers down these softening curves, while simultaneously incorporating 
appropriately tailored quitting help into mental health settings.
INTRODUCTION
The concept of hardening of the smoking population has been described as the smoking 
population, on average, becoming less willing to or less capable of quitting as smoking 
prevalence declines, implying that hard-core smokers would increasingly comprise the

 smoking population.1–5 However, several studies from around the world have found that 
softening, not hardening, is occurring.6–8 Over time, as smoking prevalence fell continuing 
smokers were making more quit attempts and consumed fewer cigarettes.
Because those with psychological distress smoke more,9,10 some have identified them as 
hard-core smokers.11,12 Nineteen years of data from the U.S. National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS) are used to examine smoking prevalence levels and the associations between 
(1) the proportion of smokers who made at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months and 
(2) the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) among the remaining smokers as 
dependent variables, and time (as smoking prevalence decreased) as the independent 
variable among people with different levels of psychological distress as measured by the 
Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6).13,14 It is hypothesized that, as with the general 
population and people without psychological distress, smoking patterns are softening among 
people with mental distress, albeit from a higher baseline than among people without 
distress.
METHODS
Study Sample
Annual individual level data from 19 waves of the NHIS were used, the principal survey 
collecting health information on the U.S. civilian and non-institutionalized population15 for 
1997 through 2015 (Appendix Table 1).
Measures
A current smoker was defined as someone who has smoked ≥100 cigarettes in their lifetime 
and currently smokes every day or some days, a total of 118,604 in the 19 waves. Current 
smokers were asked how many cigarettes they smoked per day, allowing for an answer 
between 1 and ≥95. These smokers were asked if they had tried quitting smoking for a day 
or longer in the past 12 months. Those answering yes were characterized as having made a 
quit attempt.
The K613,14 questions included in the NHIS were used to measure psychological distress 
among the smokers in the survey. The K6 consists of six questions asking about the 
respondent’s level of feeling sad, nervous, restless, hopeless, worthless, and whether 
everything felt like an effort in the past 30 days. Possible answers range from none of the 
time, to a little, to some, to most, to all of the time. The none of the time was scored to be 0 
and all of the time to be 4, the points were then summed for all six questions to obtain an 
aggregate score between 0 and 24. Following Prochaska et al.16 respondents were assigned 
to three categories: no distress (total score 0–4), moderate distress (5–12), and serious 
psychological distress (13–24). Out of the total of 586,509 respondents, 11,819 (2%) had 
missing information for at least one K6 question, which resulted in 574,690 persons for 
analysis (Appendix Table 1).
The sociodemographic variables in the adjusted models were: sex (male/female), age 
(continuous variable in years 18 to ≥85), marital status (married/living with partner, never 
married, widowed/divorced/separated), alcohol use (current drinker [one or more drinks in

 past year], former drinker [no drinks in past year], lifetime abstainer [<12 drinks in 
lifetime]), educational level (0–11 years of education/12 years without diploma, high school 
diploma/GED or equivalent, some college/associate degree, bachelor degree and higher), 
race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic all 
other race groups).
Statistical Analysis
All data from the annual adult samples of the NHIS between 1997 and 2015 were pooled, 
accounting for the complex survey data design of the NHIS, including Primary Sampling 
Unit and strata17,18 for smokers in each of the three K6 categories and computed smoking 
prevalence, the percentage of smokers with at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months, 
and the number of cigarettes smoked (Figure 1).
Logistic regression was used to assess changes in quit attempts and linear regression for 
CPD over time in unadjusted and adjusted models controlling for all sociodemographic 
variables. Because of collinearity between time (in 10 year increments, centered on the mean 
[2006]) and smoking prevalence (prevalence dropped over time, Figure 1) time was used as 
the independent variable in the final analysis. Analyses were run for each of the K6 
categories, as well as for all smokers combined, controlling for K6 category. To assess 
whether time trends in quit attempts and cigarette consumption were the same in each of the 
distress subgroups, additional analyses were carried out for all smokers combined including 
interactions for decade X K6 category (Appendix Table 3).
Analysis was done with Stata, version 14 in 2016–2017.
RESULTS
Smoking prevalence declined between 1997 and 2015 for the general population and all 
three psychological distress groups (p<0.01 for all groups in unadjusted model), with higher 
prevalence among those with more psychological distress (Figure 1A; Appendix Table 2). 
The declines were slower among those with psychological distress (interaction terms in 
Appendix Table 3). Among those with serious psychological distress the unadjusted 
smoking prevalence fell by a factor of 0.92 (95% CI=0.86, 0.98, p<0.01) per decade, but the 
adjusted prevalence did not fall significantly.
The proportion of smokers with at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months increased 
over time in all subgroups of smokers (p<0.01 for all groups; Figure 1B and Table 1) in both 
the unadjusted and adjusted models. The OR of a quit attempt increases by factors of 1.39 
(95% CI=1.34, 1.44) and 1.43 (95% CI=1.35, 1.53) for those with moderate and serious 
psychological distress compared with those without distress, respectively, in the fully 
adjusted model (p<0.01; Table 3). The percentage of those with at least one quit attempt is 
higher among those with psychological distress (Figure 1B). The increase in quit attempts 
over time was similar among smokers with all distress levels (interaction terms in Appendix 
Table 3).

 CPD declined over time for all K6 categories of smokers (p<0.01; Figure 1C and Table 2). 
Cigarette consumption was higher among smokers with serious distress (19.6 CPD in 1997, 
falling to 14.5 CPD in 2015) than among those without distress (16.3 CPD in 1997, falling 
to 11.2 in 2015). In the fully adjusted model, smokers with moderate distress smoked 1.37 
(95% CI=1.19, 1.54), and smokers with serious distress 3.69 (95% CI=3.36, 4.03) more 
CPD than those without distress (p<0.01; Table 3). People with moderate psychological 
distress reduced CPD faster than people without psychological distress (p<0.05) whereas 
people with serious distress reduced consumption at a similar rate as people without distress 
based on interaction terms in Appendix Table 3. In a sensitivity analysis that treated K6 level 
as a continuous variable, a significant effect was found (p=0.006) for the interaction of K6 
level X time (not shown).
The changes with time were essentially the same in the adjusted and unadjusted models for 
both outcomes, indicating that the demographic factors were not confounding variables.
DISCUSSION
The analyses showed that, consistent with other literature,19 over time smoking prevalence 
among those with psychological distress declined, albeit the decline being slower than in 
people without psychological distress. Although smoking more heavily than people without 
psychological distress, like people without psychological distress and the general 
population,6–8 smokers with psychological distress are softening over time. Between 1997 
and 2015 smokers with both moderate and with serious psychological distress showed 
significant increases in quit attempts and a significant decreases in the average number of 
cigarettes smoked. These results reject the hypothesis of hardening over time and, instead, 
support softening among smokers with psychological distress.
The finding that the proportion of those with at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months 
is higher among those with psychological distress compared with those without might reflect 
the fact that although this subgroup of smokers is motivated and willing to quit, they may 
have a harder time quitting successfully. Cooper and colleagues20 found using a population-
based sample that smokers with depressive symptoms make more quit attempts, and might 
have a higher motivation to quit, but are also more likely to relapse within 30 days. Smith et 
al.21 similarly found a lower likelihood of long-term cessation success among those with 
mental illness compared with those without, with cessation rates varying by different 
diagnoses.
Mental health providers have often been reluctant to treat tobacco dependence in mental 
health and addiction treatment settings because of the incorrect assumption that treating 
nicotine addiction complicates treating other substance abuse or mental health issues.22 
Prochaska and others23–26 showed that prioritizing smoking cessation is consistent with 
good clinical practice among depressed smokers. Likewise, smoking cessation often 
improves clinical outcomes in people in substance abuse treatment and recovery and can 
even enhance long-term sobriety.27–29 In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Taylor et 
al.30 showed that both in the general population and in a clinical setting quitting smoking is 
associated with improved positive mood and quality of life,31 which should reassure

 smokers with psychological distress as well as their healthcare providers to make quitting 
one of their priorities.
A major strength of the analyses is the long period of time under analysis. Another strength 
is the large sample size of this national population representative sample that allowed to not 
just differentiate between those with and without serious psychological distress (K–6 scores 
of 0–12 vs 13–24), but to also make a distinction between those with moderate and serious 
distress. These two subgroups of smokers vary in their levels of smoking prevalence between 
each other and when compared with those without distress (Figure 1). Although quit 
attempts do not vary over time between the three groups, for CPD there was a significant 
difference in time trends between those without and with moderate distress, and a marginal 
one between those without and with serious distress (Appendix Table 3), a result confirmed 
in a sensitivity analysis that treated K6 level as a continuous variable and found a significant 
effect for the interaction of K6 level X time.
Limitations
A potential limitation of this study is that the NHIS is a survey of the non-institutionalized 
population, so does not include institutionalized smokers who may have more severe 
diagnoses of depression and mental distress, with the result that these people are excluded 
from the analyses. Second, whereas the K6 scale is a validated instrument, it is a self-
assessment of mental distress symptoms, which might be less reliable than a physician-
verified diagnosis of depression. The R2 values for the unadjusted models for CPD were, 
while highly significant, were low. Third, because quit attempts were measured in the past 
12 months, whereas psychological distress questions referred to the past 30 days, it is not 
possible to assess whether these two conditions coincided directly.
CONCLUSIONS
Even smokers with serious psychological distress are willing to quit and to reduce 
consumption over time, just like the population of those without distress, albeit from higher 
baseline prevalence and consumption rates. With appropriate tailored interventions and 
quitting help these heavier smokers can successfully quit smoking. To achieve this goal in 
mental health settings more attention has to be paid to quitting smoking. To improve health 
outcomes and increase health equity, tobacco control policies should continue moving all 
subgroups of smokers down these softening curves.
