Pancreatic beta cells are of great interest for biomedical research and regenerative medicine.
Here we show the conversion of human fibroblasts towards an endodermal cell fate by
employing non-integrative episomal reprogramming factors in combination with specific
growth factors and chemical compounds. On initial culture, converted definitive endodermal
progenitor cells (cDE cells) are specified into posterior foregut-like progenitor cells
(cPF cells). The cPF cells and their derivatives, pancreatic endodermal progenitor cells
(cPE cells), can be greatly expanded. A screening approach identified chemical compounds
that promote the differentiation and maturation of cPE cells into functional pancreatic
beta-like cells (cPB cells) in vitro. Transplanted cPB cells exhibit glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in vivo and protect mice from chemically induced diabetes. In summary, our study
has important implications for future strategies aimed at generating high numbers of
functional beta cells, which may help restoring normoglycemia in patients suffering from
diabetes.

eneration of functional pancreatic insulin-producing beta
cells for the effective treatment of diabetes is a key area of
translational research. Stepwise differentiation protocols
have been devised to guide the differentiation of human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs)1, and more recently induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(iPSCs)2,
into
definitive
endoderm,
primitive gut tube endoderm, posterior foregut endoderm and
pancreatic endoderm (PE). These hESC-derived PE cells can
mature into functional beta-like cells in vivo after prolonged
periods following transplantation into immunodeficient mice3–5.
More recently, improved differentiation protocols have been
described that allow the formation of functional beta-like cells
from hESCs under cell culture conditions6–8. While these findings
are encouraging, several challenges remain and significant
efforts have been directed towards further improvement of
differentiation conditions9–13, the expansion of cells at different
progenitor
stages14,15
and
the
purification
of
target
cell
populations16
to
obtain
sufficient
quantities
of
functional
pancreatic beta cells.
An alternative strategy previously employed is the conversion
of fibroblasts towards lineage-specific proliferative progenitors
in vitro17–19. The benefit of such an approach is the ability to
generate large numbers of cells suitable for any downstream
assays
and
applications
before
final
differentiation
into
the desired cell type in vitro or in vivo. We previously devised
a
Cell-Activation
and
Signalling-Directed
(CASD)
lineage
conversion strategy, which employs transient overexpression of
iPSC-transcription factors in conjunction with lineage-specific
soluble signals to reprogramme somatic cells into diverse
lineage-specific cell types without first establishing a pluripotent
state20,21. Using this method, we and other groups have
demonstrated
the
successful
reprogramming
of
fibroblasts
and other cells into cardiac cells22,23, neural progenitors24–26,
angioblast-like
progenitors27,
endothelial
cells28
and
hepatocytes29.
In
addition,
we
recently
demonstrated
the
generation of functional pancreatic beta-like cells from mouse
fibroblasts using the CASD strategy30. However, successful
translation of these approaches to generate functional human
beta-like cells from fibroblasts that are capable of reversing
diabetes in mouse models has not been demonstrated so far.
Here we demonstrate that human endodermal progenitor cells
can be established from neonatal and adult human fibroblasts
in vitro by employing a non-integrating reprogramming approach
following the CASD transdifferentiation paradigm. We have
identified conditions that allow great expansion of converted cells
at distinct progenitor stages, including posterior foregut and PE.
Converted pancreatic endodermal progenitors can be induced to
efficiently differentiate into glucose-responsive beta-like cells
in vitro. Beta-like cells transplanted into surrogate mice are
functional in vivo and possess the ability to protect mice from
diabetes. Therefore, these findings suggest an approach for the
potential production of patient-specific insulin-producing cells to
study relevant and unresolved questions in beta-cell biology.
Results
Converting
fibroblasts
into
endodermal
progenitor
cells.
Human foreskin fibroblasts were transduced with non-integrating
episomal reprogramming factors, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and a short
hairpin RNA against p5331, recovered in fibroblast medium for
4 days, and cultured in initiation medium containing epidermal
growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and
CHIR99021 (an activator of WNT signalling) to support cell
proliferation (Fig. 1a). After 7 days, the culture conditions were
switched to endodermal conversion media containing high
level of Activin A (100 ng ml � 1) and CHIR99021 to establish
converted definitive endodermal progenitor (cDE) cells, based on
previous studies demonstrating key roles for the Activin A and
WNT signalling pathways in endodermal fate decision in vitro
and in vivo32–34. This basic endodermal conversion protocol gave
rise to cell colonies with an epithelial morphology between days
21 to 28 (Fig. 1b). Colonies specifically stained for definitive
endodermal progenitor markers SOX17 and FOXA2, but not for
the pluripotency marker NANOG or primitive gut markers
HNF6 and HNF4a (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1a). As expected,
control
fibroblasts
were
negative
for
endodermal
and
pluripotency markers (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To increase the
efficiency of our endodermal conversion protocol, we performed
a small-scale screening of chemical compounds covering bioactive
molecules capable of controlling cell fate35. We observed that
combined addition of the epigenetic modulators: sodium butyrate
(NaB, a histone deacetylase inhibitor), Parnate (Par, a histone
demethylase inhibitor) and RG108 (RG, a DNA methylase
inhibitor) could significantly improve the conversion efficiency
by 2.5-fold (Fig. 1a,d). Additional screening using this improved
condition revealed that 50-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA,
an adenosine agonist) could further increase the conversion rate
by 2-fold, resulting in a 5-fold increase over the basal protocol
(Fig. 1d). Notably, by employing this optimized condition, we
could generate B50 FOXA2 and SOX17 double-positive cDE
colonies from 400,000 human fibroblasts (Fig. 1d). Quantitative
PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that mRNA expression of
fibroblast-specific markers, THY1 and COL1A1, was rapidly
downregulated during the first 7 days of reprogramming,
suggesting a rapid dedifferentiation process (Supplementary
Fig. 1b). Endodermal gene transcripts, SOX17 and FOXA2, were
gradually upregulated (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the expression of
endogenous pluripotency gene transcripts NANOG and OCT4
remained at very low levels during the conversion process
(Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 1c). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be converted into cDE
cells using an episomal reprogramming system by employing the
CASD transdifferentiation approach.
Characterization of posterior foregut-like progenitor cells.
Next, we attempted to serially expand the number of cDE
colonies
via
treatment
with
media
containing
two
small
molecules, the WNT signalling activator CHIR99021 and the
TGFb signalling inhibitor A83-01 in conjunction with two
growth factors EGF and bFGF that significantly promoted their
expansion (Fig. 2a,b). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed
strong expression of endodermal progenitor markers SOX17 and
FOXA2, but also induction of primitive gut tube marker HNF4a
and posterior foregut marker HNF6 (Fig. 2c), suggesting further
specification towards posterior foregut-like progenitor cells (cPF
cells). Employing these culture conditions, we established five cPF
cell lines from four independent experiments employing human
neonatal fibroblasts (Fig. 2d). cPF cells proliferated rapidly with
an average doubling time of 2 days for up to 15 passages
(Fig. 2e,g). All four media supplements were important for cPF
cell self-renewal (Fig. 2f) and expanded cPF cells maintained their
epithelial colony morphology, as well as posterior foregut-like
phenotype
as
determined
by
immunofluorescence
staining
for SOX17, FOXA2, HNF4a, HNF6 and SOX9 (Fig. 2g,h;
Supplementary Figs 2–4). During mouse embryonic development,
Pdx1 expression is first detected at embryonic day 8.5 and marks
the endodermal region that will give rise to the whole pancreas, as
well as the common bile duct, distal stomach and duodenal
epithelium36,37. Interestingly, we detect PDX1 protein (Fig. 2h).
Consistently, qPCR analysis demonstrated the induced high-level
expression

 transcripts, including SOX17, FOXA2, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A,
HNF6, SOX9 and PDX1 in cPF cells when compared with
parental fibroblasts (Fig. 2i). In contrast, ectodermal marker gene
SOX1, mesodermal marker gene BRACHYURY, and pluripotency
marker genes OCT4 and NANOG were not induced (Fig. 2i).
Collectively, these data confirm the specific posterior foregut
identity of cPF cells, which is further supported by our
observations that cPF cells at both early and late passages
possessed comparable capacities to differentiate towards the
hepatic lineage (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Of note, cPF cells can be
frozen and thawed with a recovery rate of 82.7±5.1% (n ¼ 3), an
important advantage enabling many downstream assays. We
further
checked
the
genome
stability
of
cPF
cells
using
comparative genomic hybridization arrays and did not observe
any gross chromosomal aberrations, but detected four copy
number variants in one human neonatal fibroblast-derived cPF
cell line (Supplementary Fig. 6). This result is consistent with a
recent report demonstrating that long-term cultures of bipotent
stem cells from adult human liver are genome stable38. Notably,
the episomal reprogramming vectors were spontaneously lost
in established cPF cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5a), thus
overcoming
a
current
safety
concern
associated
with
the
integration
of
viral
vector-based
reprogramming/conversion
approaches. Another potential safety concern regarding cells
with proliferative and stem cell capacity is their potential for
tumour formation39. Transplantation of expanded cPF cells
under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient mice did not result
in tumour formation even after prolonged periods up to 24 weeks
in vivo (n ¼ 10) (Supplementary Fig. 5c). In contrast, all controls
(hESC-derived endodermal progenitor cell populations) formed
tumorigenic structures with big cysts and increased graft size 7
weeks after transplantation (n ¼ 4) (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Haematoxylin
and

cPF
grafts

(Supplementary

and
further
immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated protein expression
of characteristic endodermal markers, including E-cadherin,
HNF4a,
PDX1,
SOX9
and
pan-cytokeratin
(Fig.
2j).
In
summary, our results demonstrate that cPF cells can be greatly
expanded in culture while maintaining their posterior foregut
endodermal phenotype.

 screened different combinations of small molecules and growth
factors to differentiate cPF cells into more committed pancreatic
endodermal progenitor cells (cPE cells). We optimized a two-step
protocol in which cPF cells were first exposed to FGF7, FGF10,
A83-01, Compound-E (an inhibitor of Notch signalling), retinoic
acid (RA), GDC-0449 (an antagonist of Sonic hedgehog) and
LDN-193189 (an inhibitor of BMP4 signalling) for 2 days
(Fig. 3a). Subsequently, differentiating cells were treated with
EGF, Exendin-4 (an agonist of glucagon (GCG)-like peptide-1),
A83-01, LDN-193189, PBDu (an activator of protein kinase C),
Compound-E and Nicotinamide (an inhibitor of polyADP-ribose
synthetase) for another 3 days (Fig. 3a). Resulting cPE cells
continued to express high levels of FOXA2, HNF6, SOX9 and
PDX1, as expected41,42 (Fig. 3b). Most importantly, this treatment
resulted in the generation of PDX1 and NKX6.1 double-positive
cells (Fig. 3c). NKX6.1 expression in common PDX1-positive
pancreatic progenitors (before NKX6.1 expression becomes
further restricted to beta cells) marks their commitment to a
more specific endocrine-/ductal-bi-potent progenitor cell type43.
Notably, hESC-derived PDX1 and NKX6.1 double-positive PE
progenitor cells have been shown to be able to give rise to
functional
beta
cells
after
transplantation16.
Fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed approximately
78% of PDX1-positive cells, and 17.3% PDX1 and NKX6.1
double-positive cells within cPE populations at passage 1
(Fig. 3d). The level of NKX6.1 expression detected in cPE cells
is comparable to PE cells differentiated from hESCs as described
by more conventional means (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Next, we
tested the cPF expansion media on cPE cultures in an attempt to
expand cPE cells in a similar manner. However, cPE colonies
easily detached from the plate under cPF expansion condition.
Omission of CHIR99021 and increasing the EGF concentration to
50 ng ml � 1 reversed this effect and promoted cPE cell expansion
(Fig. 3f). Employing this optimized culture condition, cPE cells
were expanded with an approximate doubling time of 3 days for
up to 14 passages (Fig. 3e). Of note, expanded cPE cells
maintained their progenitor identity as evidenced by the
presence of PDX1 and NKX6.1 double-positive cells at passage
12 (Fig. 3g). Consistently, qPCR results demonstrated the
downregulation of early endodermal marker gene SOX17. The

 To explore whether expanded cPE cells can further mature into
functional beta cells in vivo, we transplanted cPE cells under the
kidney capsule of immunodeficient mice. After 15–16, 19–20 and
23–24 weeks, we detected human C-peptide after a glucose
challenge in the blood of 62.5%, 75% and 86.6% of mice analysed,
respectively, albeit at low levels (Fig. 3i). In addition, we detected
a 2.1-fold increase in human C-peptide in the serum of mice-
bearing 23-week-old grafts after glucose challenge when com-
pared with fasting levels, illustrating that cPE grafts gave rise to
functional beta-like cells on transplantation into host animals
(Fig. 3j). Starting at 15 weeks post transplantation, we found
insulin-expressing beta-like cells and PDX1-positive pancreatic
progenitor cells in some graft sections, while other regions were
negative for pancreatic markers (Fig. 3k). Insulin-positive cells
co-expressed the critical beta-cell transcription factors PDX1 and
NKX6.1, but did not show expression of other endocrine
hormones (Fig. 3k). In addition, we detected CK19-positive
duct-like structures, but not Amylase-positive exocrine cells, a
finding that supports the notion that cPE cells possess bi-
potential duct/endocrine progenitor capacity (Supplementary
Fig. 7b). In summary, our data demonstrates that cPF cells can
be differentiated into cPE cells, which can be greatly expanded
in vitro while maintaining their specific phenotype. Importantly,
cPE cells differentiate further in vivo towards insulin-producing,
single-hormonal cells capable of releasing insulin in response to
glucose challenge.
Maturation of cPE cells into pancreatic beta-like cells. To
address the question of whether cPE cells can develop into
functional beta-like cells under cell culture conditions, we first
incubated cPE cells in a basal pancreatic differentiation media
that has been shown to promote hESC/iPSC-derived pancreatic
progenitor differentiation into insulin-producing cells40. This
media includes A83-01, Nicotinamide, Forskolin (an activator of
adenylyl cyclase), Dexamethasone (an agonist of glucocorticoid
receptor) and Exendin-4 (Fig. 4a). While we consistently observed
C-peptide-positive cells expressing high levels of PDX1 after
10–14 days in culture (Fig. 4b), the relatively low number
(B0.5%) suggested that further optimization was required.
Chemical
compounds
able
to
promote
differentiation
of
definitive endoderm44 and PDX1-positive progenitors9 have
been identified previously. However, discovering molecules
directing the final steps of differentiation into beta-like cells has
been challenging due to difficulties in generating and maintaining
sufficient numbers of differentiation-competent PE cells. We
performed a chemical screen45 with the intent of identifying
factors that would result in more efficient development of
C-peptide-positive
cells
from
expanded
cPE
cells.
These
experiments
revealed
that
supplementation
of
the
basal
pancreatic differentiation media individually with Compound-E
(an inhibitor of Notch signalling), Vitamin C or BayK-8644
(a Ca2 þ
channel agonist) were effective in increasing the
percentage of C-peptide-positive cells (Fig. 4c). Combined
treatment
with
these
compounds
had
an
additive
effect
(Exendin-4, A83-01, Nicotinamide, Forskolin, Dexamethasone,
Compound-E, Vitamin C and BayK-8644), resulting in the
formation of up to 7% C-peptide-positive cells (Fig. 4c).
Previously, insulin-producing cells generated from ESCs/iPSCs
are mostly immature as evidenced by co-expression of endocrine
hormones, the lack of crucial beta-cell transcription factors and
the inability to secrete insulin in response to physiological levels
of glucose46. The maturation defects may be partly due to the lack
of three-dimensional (3D) organization normally present in
islets of Langerhans47. Hence, we generated free-floating cell
aggregates of cPE cells that first had been incubated as 2D
cultures for 10 days in the improved maturation media
(protocol 1). The majority of cells within the aggregates
expressed the pan-pancreas marker PDX1 after 8–12 days of
3D culture (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). In addition, we
detected many insulin-expressing cells co-expressing key beta-cell
transcription factors, including PDX1, NKX6.1, NKX2.2 and
NEUROD1 (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 8b). In contrast, insulin-
expressing
cells
only
rarely
co-stained
for
the
endocrine
progenitor
marker
NGN3
or
other
endocrine
hormones,
including GCG and somatostatin (SST) (Fig. 4d; Supplementary
Fig. 8b). Of note, all insulin-positive cells also stained for a
human-specific C-peptide antibody, thus excluding possible
insulin
uptake
from
the
media
(Supplementary
Fig.
8c).
Considering
the
expression
of
key
beta-cell
markers,
we
designate these cells as converted pancreatic beta-like cells
(cPB cells). One of the distinguishing hallmarks of pancreatic
beta cells is the ability to release insulin upon glucose stimulation.
Importantly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays
demonstrated that in vitro-generated cPB cells released insulin in
response to physiological levels of glucose (n ¼ 7, fold increase
2.1±1.3) (Fig. 4e). Collectively, our findings illustrate the
generation of functional pancreatic beta-like cells that respond
to physiological levels of glucose in vitro.
cPB cells protect mice from STZ-induced diabetes. Functional
insulin-producing cells are capable of regulating glucose levels in
surrogate animals. Unfortunately, our initial trials in which cPB
cells (protocol 1) were transplanted into immunocompromised,
streptozotocine (STZ)-treated diabetic mice were unsuccessful,
with most animals retaining high glucose levels and eventually
succumbing to diabetes without recovery. Encouraged by two
recent papers that introduced improved protocols for pancreatic
differentiation7,8, we further improved the maturation conditions
of cPE cells into cPB cells (protocol 2) (Fig. 5a). In addition to the
Notch inhibitor that we already employed in protocol 1 and that
was also included in both published protocols, we tested whether
the addition of Vitamin C and BayK-8644, which were discovered
during our initial chemical screens, had additional beneficial
effects. We found that both compounds promoted expression of
the INSULIN gene (Fig. 5b) as well as increased the number of
C-peptide-positive cells co-expressing key beta-cell transcription
factors PDX1 and NKX6.1 (Fig. 5c). C-peptide-positive cells
rarely co-stained for other endocrine hormones, including GCG
and SST (Fig. 5c). Quantitative FACS analysis revealed the
formation of about 15% monohormonal C-pep þGCG-SST- cells,
with only few polyhormonal cells (Figs 5d,e). We infected cPE
cells with a lentivirus containing a minimal insulin promoter
driving a fluorescence reporter expression and FACS-sorted cPB
cells at d21 (Fig. 5g). qPCR analysis for the expression of beta-cell
marker
genes,
including
INS,
PDX1,
NKX6.1,
NKX2.2,
NEUROD1, PAX6, RFX6, MAFA, GCK, PCSK1, KIR6.2, SUR1,
UCN3 and SLC30A8 of sorted cPB cells in comparison to human
islets showed comparable levels for most genes, with only few
genes showing slightly reduced levels of expression (Fig. 5h).
GSIS assays conducted with in vitro-generated cPB cells
revealed a robust release of insulin in response to physiological
levels
of glucose
(n ¼ 7,
fold
increase 2.0±0.4)
(Fig.
5f;
Supplementary Fig. 9a). The stimulation index, as calculated by
the ratio of insulin secreted in high glucose to low glucose, was
similar among the cPB cells, hESC-derived beta-like cells and
primary human islets6–8. Thus, our findings illustrate that
protocol 2 efficiently generates functional pancreatic beta-like
cells in vitro.
Considering these major improvements for in vitro-generated
cPBs, we decided to re-evaluate their in vivo function by

 transplanting cPB cells into immunodeficient mice (Fig. 6a).
Importantly, while control human fibroblasts did not evoke any
response, we detected significant glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in cPB-transplanted mice 2 months after transplanta-
tion (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Fig. 9b). Immunofluorescence

treatment, cPB grafts were removed by uni-lateral nephrectomy.

In

these
results
directly

functional in vivo and protect mice from diabetes.
Generating pancreatic beta-like cells from adult human fibro-
blasts. We applied our pancreatic conversion strategy to adult
human fibroblasts and established six cPF cell lines from three
independent experiments that were further expanded. Using the
same culture conditions as for neonatal fibroblast-derived pro-
genitors, we were able to generate expandable cPF and cPE cells
from adult fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). We checked
the genome stability of cPF cells using comparative genomic
hybridization arrays and did not observe any gross chromosomal
aberrations, but only one copy number variant in one adult
fibroblast-derived cPF cell line (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicat-
ing their genome stability. cPE cells could further differentiate
into pancreatic beta-like cells at efficiencies comparable to neo-
natal fibroblast-derived cPB cells, with only few double hormone-
positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c). Most importantly,
human adult fibroblast-derived cPB cells are functional as
demonstrated

variation among experiments; a finding that mirrors prior reports

demonstrate that human adult fibroblasts can be used to
efficiently and rapidly generate functional cPB cells, a finding
that opens up opportunities for patient-specific analysis of beta-
cell properties and cell therapy approaches.
Discussion
Various strategies towards the generation of functional beta cells
are currently being pursued, including directed differentiation
of pluripotent stem cells2–4,6–8 and direct reprogramming of
different endodermal cell types48–51. In this study, we (I)
developed a simple, robust and non-integrating approach for
the inter-lineage conversion of mesodermal human fibroblasts
into definitive endodermal progenitor cells (cDE cells) following
the CASD transdifferentiation approach; (II) showed that cDE
cells could be further specified into posterior foregut-like
progenitor
(cPF)
cells

into expandable pancreatic endodermal progenitor (cPE) cells;

 pancreatic beta-like (cPB) cells in vitro; (V) and demonstrated
that transplanted cPB cells exhibit glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in vivo and protect mice from chemically induced
diabetes.
By following the CASD transdifferentiation paradigm17,18,21,
we
show
that
conversion
of
fibroblasts
into
proliferative
progenitor populations with the ability to give rise to beta cells
represents an attractive and feasible approach for the generation
of vast numbers of human beta cells under cell culture conditions.
The current efficiency of the conversion process is low and we
expect higher yields on future improvements similar to those
previously accomplished for iPSC reprogramming45. While the
approach is robust, the individual roles of reprogramming factors
as ‘pioneer transcription factors’ and the detailed analysis of the
underlying molecular mechanisms of the conversion process
require more systematic investigations52–54. Employing transient
expression of iPSC- reprogramming factors31 under the CASD
approach, likely establishes a permissive state in cells, that can
be exploited by incubation in culture conditions previously
shown to favour definitive endoderm derivation32–34. This notion
is supported by the observation that addition of epigenetic
chemical modulators significantly increased the conversion
efficiency.
Notably, the resulting cDE cells could rapidly be specified
towards the posterior foregut state (cPF), suggesting efficient
transdifferentiation of the fibroblasts towards the endodermal
germ layer. Subsequently, we established cPF cell lines that can be
greatly expanded without loss of their specific identity. This kind
of virtually unlimited expansion is reminiscent of the recently
described generation and expansion of endodermal progenitor
cells from hESCs (eEP)14. However, eEP cells have been described
as definitive endodermal progenitors while our established cPF
cells resemble a further specified posterior foregut-like cell type.
The difference in developmental stage might be explained by the
different expansion conditions for cPF cells, relying solely on
activation of the WNT pathway and inhibition of the TGFb
pathway in combination with pro-proliferative growth factors
EGF and bFGF. A somewhat unexpected finding was the
observation that we can expand not only cPF cells, but also cPE
cells committed towards a pancreatic phenotype. The expansion
of cPE cells by at least two hundred million fold involved the
addition of a selective set of factors, including bFGF, EGF and
compound A83-01. A role for EGF in short-term proliferation of
hESC-derived
PE
cells
has
been
suggested
previously2,55.
Interestingly, we found that inhibition of the TGFb pathway by
A83-01 was particularly important for the expansion process of
cPE cells, a finding that correlates well with prior reports showing
that inhibition of TGFb signalling is beneficial for pancreatic
specification
of
differentiating
hESCs11.
Mechanistically,
inhibition of TGFb signalling might promote epithelial cell
proliferation while at the same time interfering with the
commonly observed culture induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition process56. It would be particularly interesting to test
whether the cPE expansion conditions we identified can also
be employed to amplify hESC-derived PE cells in a similar
manner. Future in-depth analysis of our endodermal progenitor
populations and their comparison with progenitor cells generated
by distinct methods, such as eEP cells or hESC-derived PE cells,
will provide invaluable information about the mechanisms
underlying
endodermal
progenitor
specification
and
self-
renewal in a human setting that has remained hard to study
due to the limited supply of embryonic samples at the relevant
stages.
Importantly, employing a chemical library screen on expanded
cPE cells in vitro resulted in the discovery of several small
molecules, including the Notch inhibitor Compound-E, Vitamin
C and the Ca2 þ channel agonist BayK-8644 that could improve
the differentiation efficiency into pancreatic beta-like cells
independently as well as in combination. Notch inhibition in
bi-potent PE cells induces expression of NGN3, a factor essential
for endocrine cell development57,58, and similar findings have
recently been reported for conventional hESC to beta-cell
differentiation protocols7,8. The effects of Vitamin C and BayK-
8644 on beta-cell differentiation have been less well-studied.
Of note, our group described previously that Vitamin C was
effective in promoting mouse pancreatic beta-cell differentiation
and maturation30. Recent reports suggested Vitamin C is involved
in many epigenetic modifications, including DNA and histone
demethylation59, promotes cell fate conversion60 and improves
cell quality61,62. Therefore, future studies will explore the roles
of Vitamin C and related epigenetic regulators in pancreatic
differentiation
and
maturation63–65.
With
regard
to
the
functional
properties
of
BayK-8644,
one
very
attractive
underlying
mechanism
could
be
related
to
the
Ca2 þ/
Calcineurin (Cn)/Nuclear Factor-Activated T cells (NFAT)
signalling pathway, known to promote mouse and human
pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and maturation66–68. More
detailed
analysis
of
the
mechanistic
functions
of
these
compounds in future studies might reveal novel properties of
pancreatic beta-cell differentiation and function that could be
exploited for cell therapy approaches.
Significantly, our in vitro-differentiated beta-like cells exhibit a
functional beta-cell phenotype as judged by their ability to secrete
insulin in response to physiological levels of glucose, as well as
their co-expression of critical beta-cell transcription factors.
While we observed a similar fold change in human C-peptide
secretion on glucose stimulation of cPB cells in comparison to
recently described hESC-derived beta-like cells and human islets,
we note a wider range of secretion, similar to what has been
reported for iPSC-derived beta-like cells7,8. Further, in-depth
analysis may reveal additional genes and epigenetic modifiers that
regulate the maturation process of pancreatic beta cells from
somatic cells. Nonetheless, even in its present state our findings
clearly indicate the potential of human adult fibroblast-derived
functional beta-like cells for the identification and analysis of
novel patient-specific properties of these insulin-producing cells.
Finally, the transplantation experiments of cPB cells into
immunodeficient mice highlight their ability to give rise to
functional islet-like structures in this physiological context. This
is in contrast to human iPSC-derived pancreatic beta-like cells
which, despite their ability to respond to glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo, have not been reported to be
able to protect immunocompromised mice from STZ-induced
diabetes on transplantation7,8. Thus, our studies represent one of
the few examples of human cell types generated through cellular
reprogramming that could protect against or even cure an
existing disease19.
We are cognizant of the fact that our cPB cell cultures do not
contain all cells typically found in human islets, including
mesenchymal support cells, endothelial cells, and neural cells.
Thus, even while we observe clear evidence for the functional
properties of the fibroblast-derived beta-like cells, we anticipate
that future co-culture experiments aimed at fully replicating the
cellular composition of human islets will further optimize the
function of cPB cells. Furthermore, there is likely an in vivo
maturation process of in vitro-engineered pancreatic cells, as
reported in recent studies of hESC-derived pancreatic beta
cells7,8, whose underlying mechanisms have not been fully
elucidated yet. We anticipate that understanding the signals
that guide beta-cell maturation will allow generating human
fibroblast-derived cells fully recapitulating all properties of
human pancreatic beta cells.

 In summary, our study demonstrates an effective conversion
strategy for human fibroblasts into the endodermal lineage,
describes robust expansion conditions for distinct endodermal
progenitor cell populations and identifies novel cocktails of
signalling factors that promote the successful differentiation of
these endodermal progenitor cells into functional beta-like cells
both in vitro and in vivo. Most significantly, when transplanted
into immunocompromised mice, these cPB cells produced human
insulin and protected mice from diabetes. We surmise that the
current CASD strategy is a viable alternative to commonly used
iPSC approach and that these efforts will advance our under-
standing of basic pancreas biology and disease modelling, as well
as the development of cell replacement therapies and drug testing
strategies.
Methods
Conversion of human fibroblasts into endodermal progenitor cells. Human
foreskin fibroblasts (CRL-2097, ATCC) and adult human dermal fibroblasts (Cell
Applications) were cultured in a 10-cm tissue-culture dish in regular fibroblast
culture medium. Reprogramming with episomal vectors was done as described31.
Briefly, 4 � 105 fibroblasts were electroporated with up to 6 mg of episomal
vectors (pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK and pCXLE-EGFP) using the
Microporator Human Dermal Fibroblast (NHDF) Nucleofector Kit (Lonza)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in fibroblast
medium for 4 days and then re-plated onto Matrigel-coated 10-cm dishes at a
density of 50 000 cells per dish. The cells were then cultured in reprogramming
initiation medium (DMEM/F12, 10% Knockout serum replacement, 5% ES-FBS,
1% Glutamax, 1% Non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng ml � 1 bFGF, 10 ng ml � 1 EGF, 2 mM Par, 0.5 mM RG,
0.1 mM NaB, 0.5 mM NECA and 3 mM CHIR99021) for 1 week, followed by
endodermal induction medium (Advanced RPMI, 2% ES-FBS, 1% Glutamax,
1% Non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM Par, 0.5 mM RG, 0.1 mM NaB, 0.5 mM NECA, 3 mM
CHIR99021 and 100 ng ml � 1 Activin A) for another 2–3 weeks. The converted
colonies were carefully picked up for expansion in expansion medium (DMEM,
1% Glutamax, 0.5 � N2, 0.5 � B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
10 ng ml � 1 bFGF, 10 ng ml � 1 EGF, 0.5 mM A83-01 and 3 mM CHIR99021) and
were passaged at 1:4–1:6 each time by Accutase treatment. Routinely, 0.5 mM
thiazovivin was used during the first 12–24-h period of each passage to prevent cell
death after dissociation. All cell culture products were from Invitrogen/Gibco BRL
and all chemicals and growth factors were from Stemgent except where mentioned.
Differentiation of cPF cells into cPE cells. For pancreatic differentiation, cPF
cells were cultured in pancreatic differentiation medium (DMEM, 1% Glutamax,
B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) with 25 ng ml � 1 FGF7,
25 ng ml � 1 FGF10, 0.5 mM A83-01, 0.1 mM Compound-E, 2 mM RA, 0.1 mM
GDC-0449 and 0.1 mM LDN-193189 for 2 days; then 50 ng ml � 1 EGF, 50 ng ml � 1
Exendin-4, 0.5 mM A83-01, 0.1 mM Compound-E, 50 nM TPB, 0.1 mM
LDN-193189 and 10 mM nicotinamide for another 3 days. After differentiation, the
cPE cell population was passaged with Accutase and cultured in cPE expansion
medium (DMEM, 1% Glutamax, 1 � B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA, 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin, 10 ng ml � 1 bFGF, 50 ng ml � 1 EGF and 0.5 mM A83-01). Routinely, 0.5 mM
thiazovivin was used during the first 12–24 h period of each passage to prevent cell
death after dissociation.
Maturation of cPE cells into cPB cells. Protocol 1. The cPE cells were differ-
entiated into beta-like cells in the pancreatic maturation media with DMEM, 1%
Glutamax, B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 50 ng ml � 1
Exendin-4, 1 mM A83-01, 10 mM forskolin, 10 mM dexamethasone, 10 mM
nicotinamide, 0.1 mM Compound-E, 50 mg ml � 1 Vitamin C and 2 mM BayK-8644
for 10 days, and then cultured as 3D aggregates in low-attachment plates for
another 8–12 days.
Protocol 2. The cPE cells were differentiated into beta-like cells in the pancreatic
maturation media with DMEM, 1% Glutamax, B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mg ml � 1 Heparin, 10 mM ZnSO4, 10 mM Alk5 inhibitor
II, 0.1 mM LDN-193189, 1 mM T3, 0.1 mM Compound-E, 2 mM BayK-8644,
0.25 mM Vc for 7d; and DMEM, 1% Glutamax, B27, 5 mg ml � 1 BSA and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mg ml � 1 Heparin, 10 mM ZnSO4, 10 mM Alk5 inhibitor
II, 1 mM T3, 1 mM N-cysteine, 10 mM Trolox, 2 mM R428, 2 mM BayK-8644 and
0.25 mM Vc for 7 days, and then cultured as 3D aggregates in low-attachment
plates for another 7 days.
Immunofluorescence staining. Standard immunostaining was carried out
as previously reported69. For cell cluster staining, primary and secondary
antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 �C. Secondary antibodies were Alexa
Fluor-conjugated (1:500–1,000) (Invitrogen). Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst
(Sigma-Aldrich) staining. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U
microscope or a SP5 confocal microscope. The primary antibodies used are detailed
in Supplementary Table 1. A representative picture of at least five independent
experiments is shown in Figs 1b,c and 2g,h. A representative picture of at least
three independent experiments is shown in Figs 2c,j,3b,c,g,4b and 5c and
Supplementary Figs 2–4. A representative picture of three independent
experiments is shown in Supplementary Figs 1a, 5b, 8b,c, 10a,b and 12a.
A representative image of two independent mice is shown in Figs 3k and 6c
and Supplementary Fig. 7b.
Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points by Accutase
treatment, fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution, and washed five times with
ice-cold Perm/Wash buffer (BD). Cells were aliquoted and incubated individually
or combinatory with antibodies and isotype controls on ice for 2 h. Cells were
washed with Perm/Wash buffer for five times and incubated individually with
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibodies (1:500,
Invitrogen) on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed with Perm/Wash buffer for five times,
re-suspended in 0.5 ml ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and analysed by FACSCalibur
and CellQuest software (BD). FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used to analyse
the data.
QPCR. For qPCR analysis, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit in combination with QIAshredder (Qiagen). First strand reverse transcription
was performed with 1 mg RNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR
was taken out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The primers used are
detailed in Supplementary Table 2.
Kidney capsule transplantation. Mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice,
NSG mice, The Jackson Laboratory) used in this study were maintained according
to protocols approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee
on Laboratory Animal Resource Center. The kidney capsule transplantation was
done as previously reported70. Briefly, cells were collected from culture dishes by
cell scraper, and injected under the renal capsule of immunodeficient NSG male
mice (6–10-week-old). For transplantation assays of established cPF cell lines,
hESC-derived definitive endoderm generated by differentiation for 1 day in RPMI
containing 100 ng ml � 1 Activin A and 50 ng ml � 1 WNT3a, followed by 4 days in
RPMI containing 0.2% FBS and 100 ng ml � 1 Activin A served as a control. Grafts
were dissected and analysed at the indicated time points. For in vivo functional
assays of cPB cells, B5.0 � 106 cPB cells and control human fibroblasts were
transplanted. For glucose-induced insulin secretion, mice were fasted overnight
and serum was collected before and after i.p. administration of 3 g kg � 1 D-glucose
solution. For induction of diabetes, mice were administered 35 mg kg � 1
Streptozotocin via i.p. injection for 5 days.
Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Cell were pre-incubated for 1 h in
Krebs–Ringer buffer (KRB), followed by incubation for 1 h in KBR containing
2.8 mM glucose followed by 1 h incubation in KRB containing 16.7 mM glucose
followed by 30 min in KRB containing 16.7 mM glucose and 30 mM KCl. Human
C-peptide levels were quantified using an ultrasensitive ELISA kit (Mercodia;
cross-reactivity with insulin and pro-insulin, 0.0006% and 1.8%, respectively).
Statistics. Indicated P values were obtained using a two-tailed t-test, and all
quantitative data are shown as mean±s.e.m. No statistical method was used to
predetermine sample size. No samples were excluded. The experiments were
not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during the
experiments and outcome assessment.
