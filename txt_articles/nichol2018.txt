Abstract
Background/objectives Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are zero- or low-calorie alternatives to nutritive sweeteners, such as
table sugars. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to quantitatively
synthesize existing scientific evidence on the glycemic impact of NNSs.
Subjects/methods PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched. Two authors screened the titles and abstracts of
candidate publications. The third author was consulted to resolve discrepancies. Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials,
with a total of 741 participants, were included and their quality assessed. NNSs under examination included aspartame,
saccharin, steviosides, and sucralose. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines.
Results Meta-analysis was performed to estimate and track the trajectory of blood glucose concentrations over time after
NNS consumption, and to test differential effects by type of NNS and participants’ age, weight, and disease status. In
comparison with the baseline, NNS consumption was not found to increase blood glucose level, and its concentration
gradually declined over the course of observation following NNS consumption. The glycemic impact of NNS consumption
did not differ by type of NNS but to some extent varied by participants’ age, body weight, and diabetic status.
Conclusions NNS consumption was not found to elevate blood glucose level. Future studies are warranted to assess the
health implications of frequent and chronic NNS consumption and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.
Introduction
Obesity is a leading cause of morbidity and premature
mortality in the U.S. and worldwide [1]. From 1976–1980 to
2013–2014, the prevalence of obesity more than doubled
among the American adult population [2]. It is estimated that
the medical expenditure attributable to overweight and
obesity will reach $861–957 billion U.S. dollars by 2030,
accounting for 16–18% of the nation’s total health care costs
[3]. By 2025, the global obesity prevalence is expected to
reach 18% in men and exceed 21% in women, and severe
obesity will exceed 6% in men and 9% in women [4].
A long line of scientific research documented the risk of
sugar consumption (in forms of free sugars or sugar-
sweetened beverages) for childhood and adult obesity [5].
Sugar consumption may increase energy intake to an extent
that exceeds energy output and distorts energy balance [6].
Energy in liquid form, such as sugar-sweetened beverages,
can be less satiating than when derived from solid foods,
resulting in overconsumption [7]. Solid foods high in sugar
are often energy dense, and frequent consumption of such
foods may lead to weight gain [8]. Restricting caloric intake
from sugar has become an important public health strategy for
weight management and obesity prevention. The 2015–2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends <10% of
daily calories from added sugars [9]. The World Health
Organization’s Guideline: Sugars Intake for Adults and
Children recommends reduced consumption of free sugars
throughout the life course and suggests a further reduction of
sugar consumption to below 5% of daily calories [10].
Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs), also called artificial
sweeteners, are zero- or low-calorie alternatives to nutritive

 sweeteners (e.g., table sugar). NNSs provide a sweet taste
with an addition of few calories, making it a popular sub-
stitute to sugars. From 1999–2000 to 2009–2012, NNS
consumption in the U.S. increased by 200% in children and
54% in adults [11]. In 2009–2012, 25% of children and 41%
of adults reported consuming NNSs on a regular basis [11].
Currently eight NNSs are permitted for use in food in the
United States, including saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame-k,
sucralose, neotame, advantame, steviol glycosides, and Luo
Han Guo fruit extracts [12]. These NNSs are high-intensity
sweeteners 30 to 20,000 times sweeter than sucrose, which
allows for less NNS use in product formulations when
replacing sugar [13]. Although the Food and Drug Admin-
istration and most published studies endorse the safety of
these NNSs, conclusive evidence has yet been drawn
regarding their use on a regular basis [14]. The clinical and
epidemiologic data at the current stage remain insufficient to
make definitive conclusions regarding the benefits of sub-
stituting sugars with NNSs on energy balance and weight
management [15]. Nevertheless, moderate consumption of
NNSs is thought to be beneficial as a dietary aid for people
with diabetes or on a weight loss routine [16].
Unlike sugar consumption that raises glycemia—glucose
level in the blood—through metabolism, it is widely
believed that NNSs may not have a substantial impact on
glycemia [17]. However, different NNSs possess diverse
chemical structures and distinct post-ingestive behaviors,
resulting in some NNSs undergoing metabolism [18].
Recent research indicates differential effects of sucralose, a
type of NNS, on glucose metabolism between normal
weight people and people with obesity [18]. A recent
review examined the effects of NNSs on glucose metabo-
lism and appetite-regulating hormones [19]. However, it
mainly focused on the evidence linking NNS consumption
to the risks for chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes,
and metabolic syndrome rather than the short-term response
of blood glucose level to NNS consumption [19]. The
purpose of the current study was to systematically review
and quantitatively synthesize existing scientific evidence
from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the glycemic
impact of NNSs. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate
and track the trajectory of glucose concentrations over time
after NNS intake, and test differential effects by type of
NNS and participants’ age, weight, and diabetic status.
Materials and methods
Study selection criteria
Studies that met all of the following criteria were included
in the review—Study design: RCT; Study subject: human;
Intervention: oral NNS consumption after overnight fasting;
Outcome: change in blood glucose level in response to NNS
consumption; Article type: peer-reviewed publication; and
Language: English.
Studies that meet any of the following criteria were
excluded: (1) studies that administered NNS consumption
in combination with other caloric foods or beverages, (2)
studies not explicitly reporting a fasting protocol, (3) studies
reporting no results from blood glucose test, or (4) presence
of other intervention components that may affect blood
glucose (e.g., exercise).
Search strategy
A keyword search was performed in two bibliographic
databases—the PubMed and the Web of Science. We con-
ducted the searches from the time of database inception to
23 February 2018. The search algorithm included all pos-
sible combinations of keywords (with wildcards) from the
following
two
groups:
(1)
“non-nutritive
sweetener”,
“rebaudioside B”, “nonnutritive sweetener”, “non nutritive
sweetener”, “artificial sweetener”, “natural sweetener”,
“low calorie sweetener”, “low-calorie sweetener”, “zero
calorie
sweetener”,
“zero-calorie
sweetener”,
“stevia”,
“saccharin”, “aspartame”, “trichlorosucrose”, “sucralose”,
“acetosulfame”, “acesulfame*”, “neotame”, and “rebau-
dioside A”; and (2) “glucose tolerance*”, “glycemic load”,
“glycaemic load”, “glucose load”, “blood glucose”, “oral
glucose”, “hyperglycemia”, “hypoglycemia”, “hypoglycae-
mia”, and “intravenous glucose”. Titles and abstracts of the
articles
identified
through
the
keyword
search
were
screened against the study selection criteria. Potentially
relevant articles were retrieved for evaluation of the full
text. Cohen’s kappa (0.88) was used to evaluate interrater
agreement. Two authors of this review, ADN and MJH,
jointly determined the inclusion and exclusion of all articles
retrieved in full text, and discrepancies were resolved
through consultation with the third author RA.
Data extraction
A standardized data extraction form was used to collect the
following methodological and outcome variables from each
included study: author(s), publication year, NNS type,
blood glucose levels, sample size, and participants’ char-
acteristics (i.e., age, gender, body weight status [body mass
index (BMI)], and diabetic status).
Meta-analysis
Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the glycemic
impact of NNS consumption. All reported blood glucose
values were converted to a standard unit of mmol/L. Blood
glucose measurements were allocated to 30-min intervals
A. D. Nichol et al.
 starting from the time of NNS consumption (i.e., baseline)
to 210 min after consumption. The outcome variable was
the change in blood glucose level relative to the baseline. If
a study reported multiple glucose values in a single 30-min
interval, those values were averaged with pooled standard
error calculated. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the
I2 index. The level of heterogeneity represented by the I2
index was interpreted as modest (I2 ≤ 25%), moderate (25%
< I2 ≤ 50%), substantial (50% < I2 ≤ 75%), or considerable
(I2 > 75%). A fixed-effect model would be estimated when
modest to moderate heterogeneity was present, and a
random-effect model would be estimated when substantial
to considerable heterogeneity was present. Publication bias
was assessed by the Egger’s test. Meta-regressions were
conducted to assess the potentially differential glycemic
impacts by type of NNS and participants’ age, weight, and
diabetic status. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata 14.2 SE version (College Station, TX: StataCorp
LLC). All analyses used two-sided tests and p-values <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Study quality assessment
Adapted from the National Institutes of Health’s Quality
Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-
Sectional Studies, quality of the included studies was
assessed using seven criteria: (1) Was the research question
clearly stated? (2) Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria
clearly stated? (3) Were study participants’ body weight
status (height/weight and/or BMI) objectively measured and
clearly reported? (4) Was a sample size justification via
power analysis provided? (5) Was the dropout rate from the
study 20% or lower? (6) Was the population referenced in
the conclusion appropriate? (7) Were there 20 or more study
participants that received NNS without additional caloric
intake? The two authors of this review, ADN and MJH,
independently scored each study based on these seven cri-
teria,
with
disagreement
resolved
through
discussion.
Scores for each criterion range from 0 to 2, depending on
whether the criterion was unmentioned or unmet (0), par-
tially met (1), or completely met (2). The total study scores
range between 0 and 14. Study quality assessment helped
measure the strength of scientific evidence but was not used
to determine the inclusion of studies.
Results
Study selection
Figure 1 shows the study selection flowchart. Among 460
total unduplicated articles identified through the keyword
and reference search, 205 were excluded by title and
abstract screening. The full texts of the remaining 255
articles were reviewed, and 226 were excluded for not
meeting the study selection criteria. Main reasons for
exclusion included studies not explicitly reporting a fasting
protocol, NNS consumption in combination with other
caloric foods or beverages, no results from blood glucose
test, or presence of other intervention components that may
affect blood glucose (e.g., exercise). The remaining 29
articles [20–48] were included in the review.
Basic characteristics of the selected studies
Table 1 reports the basic characteristics of the 29 articles
included in the review. Eleven studies evaluated aspartame,
12 evaluated saccharin, 3 evaluated stevia or steviosides,
and 5 evaluated sucralose. Among a total of 741 study
participants, 406 were normal weight (18.5 kg/m² ≤ BMI <
25 kg/m²), 71 were overweight (25 kg/m² ≤ BMI < 30 kg/
m²), 20 were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), and the remaining
244 did not report their BMI. Regarding NNS consumption,
280 participants consumed aspartame, 214 consumed sac-
charin, 105 consumed stevia, and 142 consumed sucralose.
Regarding health status, 526 participants reported no
chronic condition, 69 reported type 2 diabetes, and 146 did
not report their disease status. Age across all studies ranged
from 9 to 69 years old, with an average of 38 years old.
Estimated glycemic impact of NNS consumption
Figure 2 shows the trajectory for the glycemic impact of
NNS consumption estimated in the meta-analysis. In com-
parison with the baseline, NNS consumption was not found
to increase blood glucose level, and its concentration gra-
dually declined over the 210 min of observation period

Estimated heterogeneities in glycemic impact of
NNS consumption
Meta-regressions were conducted to assess potential het-
erogeneities in the glycemic impact of NNS consumption
by NNS type and participants’ age, BMI, and diabetic sta-
tus. No difference in the glycemic impact of NNS con-
sumption was found by NNS type for any of the seven 30-
min intervals under observation (p-values > 0.05). Com-
pared with their healthy counterparts, the changes in blood
glucose level among participants with type 2 diabetes were
0.128 mmol/L (95% CI = 0.023, 0.233), 0.844 mmol/L
(95% CI = 0.349, 1.338), and 0.613 mmol/L (95% CI =
0.204, 1.022) lower during 1–29 min, 150–179 min, and
180–210 min following NNS consumption, respectively.
One-unit increase in BMI was found to be associated with a
decrease in the glycemic impact of NNS consumption by
0.049 mmol/L
(95%
CI = 0.008,
0.091)
during
120–149 min and 0.074 mmol/L (95% CI = 0.008, 0.140)
during 180–210 min following NNS consumption. An
additional year of age was found to be associated with a
decrease in the glycemic impact of NNS consumption by
0.026 mmol/L
(95%
CI = 0.002,
0.051)
during
150–179 min following NNS consumption.

Scores for each criterion range from 0 to 2, depending on whether the
criterion was unmentioned or unmet (0), partially met (1), or
completely met (2). The total study score ranges between 0 and 14.
The question IDs are as follows: (1) Was the research question clearly
stated? (2) Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly stated? (3)
Were study participants’ body weight status (height/weight and/or
BMI) objectively measured and clearly reported? (4) Was a sample
size justification via power analysis provided? (5) Was the dropout rate
from the study 20% or lower? (6) Was the population referenced in the
conclusion appropriate? (7) Were there 20 or more study participants
that received NNS without additional caloric intake?

Discussion
This study systematically reviewed and quantitatively syn-
thesized existing scientific evidence from RCTs on the
glycemic impact of NNSs. Twenty-nine studies with 741
total participants were identified from the keyword search of
bibliographic databases. NNSs under examination included
aspartame, saccharin, steviosides, and sucralose. Meta-
analysis was performed to estimate and track the trajectory
of blood glucose concentrations over time after NNS con-
sumption, and test differential effects by type of NNS and
participants’ age, weight, and disease status. In comparison
with the baseline, NNS consumption was not found to
increase blood glucose level, and its value gradually
declined over the course of observation following NNS
consumption. The glycemic impact of NNS consumption
did not differ by type of NNS but to some extent varied by
participants’ age, BMI, and diabetic status.
Findings of this review confirmed previous research on
the absence of glycemic impact of NNS consumption [49].
In addition, the review tracked the trajectory of blood glu-
cose level over the first 210 min following NNS consump-
tion and identified a significant decline in glycemia relative
to the baseline starting at approximately 120 min. Meta-
regressions further indicated that as BMI and age increased,
there tended to be an inclination for decreased blood glu-
cose levels at different time intervals. In contrast, a large
cross-sectional study reported that blood glucose levels
stayed constant during fasting up to 18 h [50]. Two cross-
sectional studies reported no difference in fasting blood
glucose level despite increasing age [51] or BMI [52]. The
elderly are a vulnerable population that are exposed to an
elevated risk for impaired postprandial glucose regulation.
Despite normal fasting levels, as age increases the ability to
regulate postprandial glycemia begins to diminish [53].
Future studies should take these pieces of evidence into
consideration and examine whether NNS consumption
actually causes the decline of glycemia.
Each NNS is structurally different from the others [54].
In addition to having a range of sweetness intensities, the
structural differences lead to different amounts of NNSs
absorbed and post-ingestive behaviors [55–61]. Despite
these differences, our results suggest no differential gly-
cemic impact by type of NNS.
The absence of glycemic impact of NNS consumption
makes NNSs a potentially useful dietary aid for people with
diabetes or on a weight loss regime [16]. However, some
NNS products may contain energy and carbohydrate from
other sources that impact blood glucose level [15]. Recent
reviews also caution against the safety of NNS consumption
on a daily basis. One prevailing hypothesis was that con-
suming sweet-tasting but non-caloric or reduced-calorie
foods and beverages interferes with learned responses that
normally contribute to glucose and energy homeostasis,
resulting in the counterintuitive effect of inducing metabolic
derangements [62]. Some inconclusive evidence indicates
that frequent NNS consumers could be exposed to an ele-
vated risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease [62]. Therefore, the lack of
glycemic impact may not exempt NNS from being asso-
ciated with long-term adverse health consequences. Future
studies are warranted to assess the health implications of
frequent and chronic NNS consumption and elucidate the
underlying biological mechanisms.
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated
both RCTs and prospective cohort studies [63]. NNSs were
not found to be associated with decreases in BMI based on
the RCTs included in the review; however, the observa-
tional data suggested that the routine intake of NNSs might
be associated with an increase in BMI in the long term.
Additionally, analysis of the observational studies showed
an increase in cardiometabolic risks such as hypertension.
However, additional experimental studies are necessary to
confirm these preliminary findings.
Of the eight US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved NNSs, four of them were not included in this
systematic review and meta-analysis because none of the
relevant studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these four
NNSs (neotame, advantame, acesulfame potassium, and
Luo Han Guo extract), 11 studies investigating acesulfame
potassium were identified by the search algorithm [64–74];
however, these studies did not fit our inclusion criteria for
reasons such as using an animal model [68] or incorporating
a caloric intake in participants’ treatment [74]. However,
Bryant et al. [74] have shown that acesulfame potassium +
glucose resulted in a 17% increase in glycemic response
when compared with glucose alone, which warrants further
investigation.
This review serves as the first attempt to synthesize
scientific literature regarding the glycemic impact of NNSs.
It included a relatively large number of RCTs with repeated
clinical measures and outcomes. However, a few limitations
pertaining to this review and the selected studies should be
noted. Sample sizes in the included studies were small to
modest,
and
study
participants
were
typically
non-
representative to the target population. These compro-
mised the estimation precision of the pooled effect and
generalizability of the study findings. Due to the small
sample size and heterogeneity in the NNSs assessed, we are
not able to limit our analysis to a single NNS. The meta-
analysis evaluated four NNSs, including saccharin, aspar-
tame, sucralose, and stevia, in which sucralose and
A. D. Nichol et al.
 aspartame are two of the most widely used NNSs [75].
Publication bias was identified for the estimated change in
blood
glucose
levels
during
the
time
interval
of
180–210 min following NNS consumption. This could be
resulted from a small number of unrepresentative studies
that followed the change in glucose level to over 3 h. Only
four of the eight FDA-permitted NNSs were examined in
the included studies due to data availability, so that the
glycemic impact of the other NNS types remains unre-
vealed. No gender-specific estimate was provided in the
included studies, which precluded assessing the gender
difference in the glycemic impact of NNSs. Future studies
are also warranted to assess the different blood glucose
measurement instruments and how their sensitivity, effi-
ciency, and convenience for the study participant may
impact results.
Conclusion
This study systematically reviewed scientific literature
regarding the glycemic impact of NNSs. Twenty-nine RCTs
with 741 adult participants were identified from the key-
word search. In comparison with the baseline, NNS con-
sumption was not found to increase blood glucose level, and
its value gradually declined over the course of observation
following NNS consumption. The glycemic impact of NNS
consumption did not differ by type of NNS but to some
extent varied by participants’ age, body weight, and diabetic
status. Future studies are warranted to assess the health
implications of frequent and chronic NNS consumption and
elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.
