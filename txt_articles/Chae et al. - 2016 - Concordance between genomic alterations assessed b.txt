ABSTRACT
Genomic analysis of tumor tissue is the standard technique for identifying DNA 
alterations in malignancies. Genomic analysis of circulating tumor cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA) represents a relatively non-invasive method of assessing genomic alterations 
using peripheral blood. We compared the concordance of genomic alterations between 
cfDNA and tissue biopsies in this retrospective study. Twenty-eight patients with 
advanced solid tumors with paired next-generation sequencing tissue and cfDNA 
biopsies were identified. Sixty-five genes were common to both assays. Concordance 
was defined as the presence or absence of the identical genomic alteration(s) in a 
single gene on both molecular platforms. Including all aberrations, the average number 
of alterations per patient for tissue and cfDNA analysis was 4.82 and 2.96, respectively. 
When eliminating alterations not detectable in the cfDNA assay, mean number of 
alterations for tissue and cfDNA was 3.21 and 2.96, respectively. Overall, concordance 
was 91.9–93.9%. However, the concordance rate decreased to 11.8–17.1% when 
considering only genes with reported genomic alterations in either assay. Over 50% 
of mutations detected in either technique were not detected using the other biopsy 
technique, indicating a potential complementary role of each assay. Across 5 genes 
(TP53, EGFR, KRAS, APC, CDKN2A), sensitivity and specificity were 59.1% and 94.8%, 
respectively. Potential explanations for the lack of concordance include differences in 
assay platform, spatial and temporal factors, tumor heterogeneity, interval treatment, 
subclones, and potential germline DNA contamination. These results highlight the 
importance of prospective studies to evaluate concordance of genomic findings 
between distinct platforms that ultimately may inform treatment decisions.
INTRODUCTION
A central goal of precision medicine in oncology 
is to target genomic alterations with novel therapeutic 
agents in a timely manner as the tumor genomic profile 
evolves. Currently, genomic analysis of tissue biopsy is 
accepted as the gold standard strategy for identifying 
DNA genomic alterations in tumors using next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) among other techniques. While tumor 
tissue will continue to remain the optimal technique 
to guide targeted treatments and to best understand 
tumor architecture and histology, limitations exist. In 
some circumstances, tissue biopsies carry risks and 
can be technically challenging to repeat. For instance, 
major complication rates with thoracic biopsies have 
been reported at 5.2% [1]. In other instances, such as

metastatic disease, actionable molecular alterations 
may exist at multiple sites, not easily accessible via a 
single tissue biopsy. Therefore, developing non-invasive 
techniques for characterizing tumor mutations at baseline 
and dynamically during treatment may be necessary to 
assess tumor evolution, to monitor therapy response, and 
to personalize changes in treatment.
Tumor heterogeneity represents a major challenge to 
personalized anticancer therapy. Intratumor heterogeneity 
can result in missing critical DNA genomic alterations 
using conventional tumor biopsies and underestimation 
of the genomic variability within a tumor [2–5]. While 
tumor tissue-based biopsies are limited by spatial and 
temporal (e.g., potential need for multiple invasive biopsies) 
considerations, circulating tumor cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
assays have emerged as a less invasive method of assessing 
tumor genomic alterations using peripheral blood [6, 7]. 
cfDNA quantity is on average higher in patients with 
cancer compared to controls, but varies considerably, and 
is thought to arise from apoptotic and necrotic cells [8]. 
In localized disease, the proportion of purified cfDNA in 
the blood is extremely low, which may limit utility in these 
patients. For advanced tumors, cfDNA is variable with 
some tumor types such as pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, 
breast, bladder, esophageal, melanoma, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma expressing higher percentages of cfDNA while 
others, such as brain, renal, prostate, and thyroid cancers 
having detectable circulating DNA in less than 50% of 
patients [9]. One study with an estimated 95% of patients 
having advanced or metastatic disease reported 58% of 
patients having at least one detectable alteration, which 
increased to 65% when excluding glioblastoma [10]. In 
contrast, only 1 of 222 (0.45%) healthy controls was found 
to have an alteration present. In addition, tumor purity based 
on non-cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment may 
also complicate cfDNA assays [11]. Still, cfDNA has the 
potential to capture DNA alterations in the peripheral blood 
in a more dynamic manner in particular types of advanced 
tumors when feasibility of repeat tissue biopsies is limited.
Potential applications of cfDNA assays include 
early detection of metastatic disease and monitoring of 
minimum residual disease [12]. For example, detection 
of emerging EGFR mutations (e.g., deletions in exon 
19 and L858R substitutions in exon 21) in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), can guide treatment 
with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [13, 14]. In 
many cases, tumor evolution results in secondary EGFR 
T790M mutations in exon 20 leading to resistance to 
EGFR TKIs [15]. cfDNA assays may have the potential to 
identify when these secondary resistance mutations arise 
in the peripheral blood prior to detection of clinical or 
radiological progression of disease. A recent prospective 
study indicates potential for detecting EGFR and KRAS 
mutations with 100% positive predictive value using 
plasma droplet digital PCR, which can be used to detect 
a small number of known mutation targets [16]. EGFR 
T790M mutations were also examined with specificity 
of 63%, possibly related to tumor heterogeneity and 
 
false-negative tissue genotyping. In addition, recent 
studies have suggested that detection of mutational 
burden can potentially help predict response to 
immunotherapies such as the checkpoint inhibitors 
targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1), raising another potential 
application of cfDNA analysis in parallel with genomic 
analysis of tissue biopsies [17–19].
High concordance has been reported between 
tumor tissue NGS and cfDNA in studies investigating the 
presence of EGFR alterations in NSCLC, multiple genes 
in pancreaticobiliary cancers (KRAS, TP53, APC, FBXW7, 
SMAD4), exons 12–13 of KRAS in colorectal cancer, 
BRAF V600E and KIT mutations in melanoma, and BRAF, 
EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA across a variety of advanced 
cancers [20–23]. These studies report high specificity and 
diagnostic accuracy as greater than 80–90% compared to 
the gold standard of tissue-based NGS. However, in these 
studies, the reported values are based predominantly on 
not detecting DNA alterations in either assay (e.g., no 
mutations detected in EGFR in the same patient). This 
limits potential applicability for whether this technology 
can be used to detect early mutations in the peripheral 
blood. One study reported an average concordance of 
85.9% in advanced cancers when including mutations that 
were both present and absent and 90% when limiting the 
sample to patients with stage II colorectal cancer [22]. 
Other work has reported high concordance for real-time 
 
polymerase methods to detect targeted BRAF V600 
mutations with rapid turn around time [24]. 
In early-stage disease, the low levels of cfDNA in 
peripheral blood may limit long-term clinical applications. 
In advanced cancers, current data are lacking that targeting 
cfDNA mutations in the peripheral blood improve patient 
outcomes. More clinical data are necessary to determine 
whether NGS data derived from cfDNA assays sufficiently 
correlate with that obtained from tissue biopsies to 
determine if and when cfDNA assays may be beneficial 
clinically.  The utility may exist in detecting treatment 
response and resistance, as opposed to replacing tumor 
biopsy for initial treatment decision making [25].
The goal of the present study was to identify 
concordance of genomic alterations obtained from tissue 
biopsies and cfDNA analyses for patients with advanced 
malignancy. This is necessary in order to assess the fidelity 
of cfDNA as many genomic alterations contribute to tumor 
heterogeneity. It is also critical to understand whether 
this information may be useful in patients in whom 
tumor tissue is unavailable to support clinical treatment 
decisions based on emergence of genomic alterations that 
can predict resistance to treatment. To our knowledge, this 
is one of the most systematic analyses in terms of number 
of genes to examine concordance across DNA alterations 
as assessed in tissue-based NGS and cfDNA.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Fifty-four patients were identified retrospectively to 
have cfDNA testing performed by a single commercial NGS 
sequencing provider. Of these, 29 patients had matched 
tumor tissue biopsy and peripheral blood cfDNA genomic 
analyses. One patient was excluded for insufficient sample 
for tissue-based FoundationOne testing. Table 1 shows the 
patient characteristics of the 28 patients included in the 
study. There were 14 lung cancer (10 adenocarcinoma, 
1 poorly differentiated NSCLC, 1 squamous, 1 small 
cell, 1 large cell neuroendocrine), 3 ovarian (2 serous, 1 
clear cell), 2 endometrial (1 mucinous, 1 epitheloid), 2 
thyroid (1 papillary, 1 poorly differentiated not otherwise 
specified), 2 hepatocellular (1 clear cell, 1 undifferentiated), 
2 unknown primary, 1 cholangiocarcinoma (mucinous), 
1 gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, and 1 
peritoneal adenocarcinoma (serous). Overall, 14 of 28 
(50%) patients had lung cancer and 26 of 28 (93%) had 
stage IV disease. The median interval between collecting 
each paired tumor biopsy was 89 days [8–3,448 days]. Nine 
patients had no treatment between biopsy collections. 
Concordance of tumor biopsy and cfDNA 
genomic analyses
Concordance between the two assays was 91.9% 
(1672/1820 genes) including all genes examined (SD 
4.31%) (Table 2). Concordance was similar for the 14 lung 
cancer patients (91.1%) as compared to the 14 patients

with non-lung cancers (92.6%). When excluding particular 
alterations within overlapping genes not sequenced by 
Guardant360, concordance was 93.9%. For this analysis, 
concordance was also similar when comparing lung 
cancer patients (93.3%) to non-lung cancer patients 
(94.5%). Concordance was high across all patients with 
range of 81.5%–100%. One of 28 (3.6%) had complete 
concordance at the patient level. This patient had no 
genomic alterations detected in either assay.
The remaining analyses were subset analyses, 
specifically examining concordance for genes with a 
genomic alteration present in one or both assays (i.e., 
excluding double negatives, wild type/wild type). Among 
the subset of genes with reported genomic alterations 
in either assay (N = 170), concordance between the two 
assays was 11.8% with a partial concordance of 4.7%. The 
full and partial concordance values were 17.1% and 4.7%, 
respectively, when only including alterations detectable 
in both assays. When excluding cfDNA biopsies without 
any alterations detected (N = 6), concordance and partial 
concordance were 19.0% and 5.2%, respectively. No 
significant differences were found when stratifying the 
sample based on genes with complete exon sequencing or 
copy number variant (CNV). The gene level concordance 
for each individual patient ranged from 0 to 33.3% with 
partial concordance of 0 to 28.6%. When only examining 
variants detectable in both assays, gene level concordance 
was 0 to 66.7% with partial concordance of 0 to 28.6%. 
The sample was also analyzed based on collection interval 
between biopsies, less than 90 days versus greater than 
90 days (Table 3). Concordance was 12.7% with a partial 
concordance of 1.3% for results of both tumor tissue and 
cfDNA less than 90 days apart (N = 77). For biopsies more 
than 90 days apart, concordance was 10.8% with a partial 
concordance of 7.5% (N = 93). The trend was similar 
when only including alterations detectable in both assays. 
In addition, when examining concordance for patients 
with no treatment between biopsies (N = 9), no significant 
differences were noted in this preliminary analysis.
When considering the same genes and variants 
analyzed by both platforms, 31.1% of tissue-based 
mutations were detected via cfDNA. In addition, 33.7% 
of cfDNA mutations were detected via tissue-based 
sequencing. Figure 1 shows the landscape of DNA 
mutations found in the NGS platforms in each patient.

potential outcomes observed for the 10 representative

Cell-free DNA percent
For genes with identical sequencing mutations 
(N = 23), the percent or allele frequency of altered 
cfDNA was analyzed. The mean allele frequency of 
altered cfDNA in the peripheral blood for the subset of 
mutations found in both tissue and circulating blood was 
16.8% (SD 27.4%) [range 0.1%–81.0%]. Overall, 65% of 
these identical mutations (15 of 23), were found to have

relatively low (less than 10%) allele frequency of altered 
circulating cfDNA.
Average number of DNA alterations
The average number of alterations including VUS 
per patient for tissue and cfDNA was 4.82 (SD 3.02) and 
2.96 (SD 3.01), respectively (Table 2). Median number of 
mutations for tissue and cfDNA was 4 and 2, respectively. 
More mutations were detected in tissue-based NGS in 21 
of 28 (75%) of patients. A greater number of genomic 
alterations were detected in cfDNA in 5 of 28 (17.9%) 
patients. An equal number of mutations were detected 
in 2 of 28 (7.1%) patients. When excluding particular 
alterations within overlapping genes not sequenced by 
Guardant360, average number of alterations including 
VUS for tissue and cfDNA was 3.21 (SD 2.25) and 2.96 
(SD 3.01). Median number of alterations was 3 for the 
tissue assay and 2 for the cfDNA assay.
Diagnostic accuracy analysis
Gene-level 
sensitivity, 
specificity, 
positive 
predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) 
and diagnostic accuracy were analyzed across the five 
representative genes in the sample - TP53, EGFR, KRAS, 
APC, CDKN2A (Table 4). Tissue-based NGS was used 
as the gold standard for this analysis [26]. Across all 5 
genes examined, including VUS, sensitivity was 50.0%, 
specificity was 89.5%, and diagnostic accuracy was 82.6% 
(Supplementary Table S3). Values were slightly higher 
when VUS were excluded with sensitivity of 59.1%, 
specificity of 94.8%, and diagnostic accuracy of 89.1% 
(Table 4). Four of the 5 genes examined had a specificity 
of greater than 90%. Specificity and diagnostic accuracy 
were lowest for TP53. The Youden’s J index across 
all 5 genes was 0.4 when including VUS and 0.5 when 
excluding VUS. 
DISCUSSION
Personalized treatment in oncology aims to treat 
malignancies based on their genomic profile with effective 
molecularly targeted drugs. Additionally, the goal is to 
detect the emergence of genetic alterations that predict 
recurrence or resistance to treatment prior to development 
of clinical symptoms or radiological evidence of disease 
progression. Rapid developments in genomic analyses 
of tumors are enabling this transformative paradigm in 
oncology that may ultimately allow real-time treatment 
decisions based on the precise genomic landscape of 
the tumor. In certain circumstances, genomic analysis of 
cfDNA may hold promise to help overcome this challenge 
if findings reliably correlate with primary tumor and 
metastatic site(s) genomic landscape. Hence, the primary 
objective of this study was to investigate the concordance 
rate of genomic profiling using NGS in both tissue 
biopsies and peripheral blood circulating tumor cfDNA.
As compared to tissue-based biopsy, our findings 
indicate that cfDNA assays have high specificity, but low 
sensitivity, along with diagnostic accuracy in the range 
of 82–89%. When examining all genes, including those 
without DNA alterations in either assay, concordance was 
91.9–93.9%. However, when examining the subset of genes 
with DNA alterations found in either assay, concordance 
and partial concordance were low (11.8–17.1% and 4.7%, 
respectively). A recent study examining 50 hotspot genes 
in tumor and cfDNA reported a sensitivity of 49.9% 
and a specificity of 99.8% for patients with advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors [27]. Similarly, previous studies that

report high concordance and specificity are based on single 
genes and sometimes specific codons. A critical difference 
in our analyses was that the genomic platforms used in 
our study included genes with both critical and complete 
exon coverage, thereby looking more comprehensively at 
sequencing concordance of the 65 overlapping genes. This 
analysis was critical to appropriately assess the potential for 
cfDNA to accurately identify specific sequencing mutations 
and resistance patterns. For example, it is not sufficient to 
classify a BRAF V600E mutation in tissue and a BRAF 
S729L VUS in peripheral blood as concordant at the 
gene level. Instead, we only considered concordant DNA 
alterations when the exact same sequencing alteration was 
present in both biopsies. Collectively, these data indicate 
that cfDNA assays may be best utilized to rule in rather 
than to rule out certain genomic alterations given the high 
specificity. 
There are several potential reasons to explain the 
difference in results between the two NGS assays. First, 
the biopsy techniques are quite different. In lung cancer, 
previous studies using multi-region whole-exome and/or 
whole-genome sequencing indicate differing degrees of 
driver mutation heterogeneity with one study reporting 
20/21 known cancer gene mutations in all regions 
[28]. However, another study suggested that subclonal 
diversification results in missed driver mutations indicating 
that multiple tissue biopsies in different locations would 
be optimal to best characterize tumor heterogeneity [29]. 
In contrast, cfDNA only captures mutations above the 
detection threshold that are found in peripheral blood after 
tumor cells outgrow the blood supply, become hypoxic, 
and undergo apoptosis or necrosis, releasing DNA into the 
peripheral blood. Therefore, there are intrinsic differences 
in assay platform and sensitivity. With current sequencing 
technology, more genomic alterations were detected 
in tissue biopsies (mean 4.82) as compared to cfDNA 
(mean 2.96). However, when eliminating alterations not 
detectable with the cfDNA at this time, mean alterations 
for tissue (3.21) and cfDNA (2.96) were similar.  While 
our analyses compared a single, commercially available 
cfDNA assay to tissue-based NGS, the emergence of 
additional cfDNA platforms necessitates further studies 
comparing these to tissue-based NGS. Studies are ongoing 
to assess concordance using new platforms, as well as 
more sensitive droplet digital PCR for targeted sequencing 
alterations.
Second, temporal factors may also be significant. 
Tumors are highly dynamic and a larger sample size 
stratifying concordance based on timeframe between 
biopsies is critical. For patients with advanced cancer 
and sufficient cfDNA in the blood, we hypothesized 
that higher concordance would be associated with closer 
timeframe between biopsies. We were unable to validate 
this hypothesis based on our analysis (Table 3). 
Third, type of cancer and site of biopsy are likely 
important. Some types of tumors, such as pancreatobiliary 
cancers, are more difficult to biopsy and to capture 
heterogeneity with tissue-based biopsies. Previous 
studies have also indicated differences in regard to type 
of malignancy and degree of cfDNA detected in the 
blood. Pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, breast, bladder, 
gastroesophageal, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma 
were more likely to have detectable cfDNA as compared 
to primary brain, renal, prostate, and thyroid cancers [9]. 
Our study indicated that concordance for patients with lung 
cancer was similar when compared to concordance for 
non-lung cancers. In addition, in our sample, 50% of tissue 
biopsies were performed at metastatic sites, which likely 
captures greater tumor heterogeneity after accumulation of 
mutations that promote metastasis. The burden and location 
of metastatic disease also may play a role in cfDNA 
detection and genomic landscape heterogeneity.
Finally, we included both subclones and VUS in 
this analysis with the goal of fully analyzing sequencing 
concordance between the two techniques. However, the 
potential to make treatment related decisions based on 
these assays is mostly predicated on clinically significant 
mutations at this time. Further comprehensive preclinical 
studies are needed to analyze this subset of mutations to 
determine the true functional significance of such variants. 
In addition, future studies should examine concordance 
comparing synonymous mutations across NGS platforms. 
Interestingly, over half of mutations detected in either 
technique were not detected using the other biopsy 
technique (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4). This finding 
indicates considerable tumor heterogeneity that cannot be 
fully detected in either biopsy technique alone. This implies 
a potential complementary role of both tissue-based and 
cfDNA biopsies to better capture tumor heterogeneity. 
To the best of our knowledge, the study examines 
the concordance of the largest number of genes (65) to 
date and reflects what is found in a real-world oncology 
clinical setting. Our analyses were comprehensive in 
assessing concordance for the panel of overlapping genes 
tested in both NGS platforms: tissue and blood cfDNA. 
We defined concordance in our study to encompass the 
full set of genes tested, rather than focusing on each 
gene. We included VUS and subclones to fully capture 
sequencing concordance. Theoretically, there should be no 
difference in concordance between VUS and non-VUS. 
 
This is supported by similarities in our sensitivity, 
specificity, and diagnostic accuracy analyses with and 
without VUS (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S3). We 
included a heterogeneous group of cancers in our analysis 
to optimally examine concordance across multiple types of 
cancer. Limitations of our study include a relatively small 
patient sample size, and half of the sample consisting 
of patients with lung cancers, which may have skewed 
the most common genes encountered in our sample. A 
large prospective trial assessing concordance between 
circulating tumor DNA and FoundationOne matched solid 
tumor samples is currently underway (NCT02620527).

In conclusion, our findings indicate high specificity 
and concordance when genomic alterations are present or 
absent. When examining the subset of genes with DNA 
alterations present, concordance was relatively low. 
Further studies are warranted to validate our findings 
across multiple cancer types, to examine concordance 
as new cfDNA platforms and sequencing technologies 
develop, to compare concordance at different intervals 
between biopsies, and to determine change in cfDNA 
genomic alteration type and frequency over time.

within the Northwestern Medicine Developmental 
Therapeutics Program, Division of Hematology Oncology, 
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 
All studies were conducted in concordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Fifty-four consecutive patients 
with commercial cfDNA NGS testing by Guardant360 
(Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA) were identified 
retrospectively. Of these, 29 patients had comprehensive 
tissue NGS testing (FoundationOne) commercially 
performed by Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, MA) 
[26]. 
One 
patient 
was 
excluded 
because 
the 
FoundationOne report stated inadequate sample quality. 
Therefore, the final sample size was 28 patients with 
both tissue and peripheral blood cfDNA results available. 
Clinical characteristics of patients included in the study 
were retrospectively obtained via patient chart review. 
These data included basic demographics as well as tumor 
biopsy information to characterize the histology and stage 
of malignancy.
Genes analyzed
The study examined concordance between 
all genes found in cfDNA that were also present in 
tumor biopsy samples. In total, 68 genes were tested 
by the Guardant360 cfDNA. Of those, 3 genes were 
excluded (RHEB, RHOA, and RIT1) because these 
genes were not included in the 315 gene panel tested 
by tissue biopsy sequencing. Therefore, 65 genes 
common to both assays were examined for concordance 
(Supplementary Table S1). Twenty-nine genes had 
complete exon sequencing by both assays. Thirty-nine 
genes had critical exon sequencing by Guardant360 and 
complete exon sequencing by Foundation Medicine. 
Four rearrangements were common to both assays. The 
median interval between collections of tissue biopsy and 
peripheral blood specimens was 89 days.
Defining concordance and data analysis
Concordance analysis between genomic findings 
from tumor tissue biopsy and plasma cell-free DNA was 
performed on 65 genes. Two definitions of concordance 
were utilized in the study. First, concordance was defined 
at the gene level as detecting an identical sequencing 
mutation or not detecting an alteration in a single gene. For 
example, a R248L mutation in TP53 detected in both assays 
for the same patient was counted as a concordant genetic 
alteration. In contrast, the finding of distinct mutations 
detected in the same gene when the two assays were 
performed on the same patient was counted as a discordant 
genomic alteration (e.g., TP53 R248W by cfDNA and 
TP53 K132R by tissue biopsy) (Supplementary Table S2). 
For this analysis, the denominator in this calculation was 
1,820 (65 genes for 28 patients). 
Second, concordance was examined for the subset 
of genes in which a genomic alteration was found. For 
this analysis, genes in which mutations were not found 
(e.g., no mutations found in EGFR in both assays in the 
same patient) were excluded from both the numerator and 
denominator. Concordance was further compared when 
excluding particular alterations within overlapping genes 
not sequencing by Guardant360. These included splice 
site mutations, certain small insertions or deletions, and 
allelic loss (such as PTEN). Partial concordance was 
defined as having one concordant mutation and at least 
one discordant genomic alteration in the same gene. 
Alterations were binned into 3 categories: concordant, 
partially concordant, or discordant. Total concordance 
was defined, not by patients, but by the total number of 
fully concordant or partially concordant alterations with 
the denominator as the total number of DNA alterations 
in our sample (N = 170 genomic alterations or N = 129 
when excluding alterations not sequenced by the cfDNA 
assay). The analysis included non-synonymous DNA 
mutations, rearrangements, and copy number variants 
(CNV) regardless of clone percentage. As variants of 
unknown significance (VUS) are also important to assess 
sequencing concordance, these were also included. 
All cfDNA samples, regardless of the number of DNA 
alterations detected (e.g., even when none were detected) 
were included. Synonymous DNA alterations reported 
by Guardant360 were not included in any concordance 
analysis because synonymous alterations were not 
included in FoundationOne reports.
In addition, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic 
accuracy (effectiveness) analyses were performed across 
the 5 representative genomic alterations (TP53, EGFR, 
KRAS, APC, CDKN2A) in the sample (Figure 1). This 
analysis included instances in which no alterations 
were detected in either assay (double negatives). There 
were two instances for TP53 in which a DNA alteration 
was detected in the same gene in both assays, but the

sequencing mutation was discordant. These two samples 
were excluded, only from the sensitivity, specificity, 
and diagnostic accuracy analysis for TP53 (N = 26). All 
other analyses included 28 patients. Youden’s J index 
(sensitivity + specificity – 1) was calculated as an indirect 
measurement of concordance, as well as an alternative 
method reflecting diagnostic accuracy [30].
