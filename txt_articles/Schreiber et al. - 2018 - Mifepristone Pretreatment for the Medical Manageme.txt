BACKGROUND
Medical management of early pregnancy loss is an alternative to uterine aspira-
tion, but standard medical treatment with misoprostol commonly results in treat-
ment failure. We compared the efficacy and safety of pretreatment with mifepris-
tone followed by treatment with misoprostol with the efficacy and safety of 
misoprostol use alone for the management of early pregnancy loss.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 300 women who had an anembryonic gestation or in whom 
embryonic or fetal death was confirmed to receive pretreatment with 200 mg of 
mifepristone, administered orally, followed by 800 μg of misoprostol, adminis-
tered vaginally (mifepristone-pretreatment group), or 800 μg of misoprostol alone, 
administered vaginally (misoprostol-alone group). Participants returned 1 to 4 days 
after misoprostol use for evaluation, including ultrasound examination, by an in-
vestigator who was unaware of the treatment-group assignments. Women in whom 
the gestational sac was not expelled were offered expectant management, a second 
dose of misoprostol, or uterine aspiration. We followed all participants for 30 days 
after randomization. Our primary outcome was gestational sac expulsion with one 
dose of misoprostol by the first follow-up visit and no additional intervention 
within 30 days after treatment.
RESULTS
Complete expulsion after one dose of misoprostol occurred in 124 of 148 women 
(83.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 76.8 to 89.3) in the mifepristone-pretreat-
ment group and in 100 of 149 women (67.1%; 95% CI, 59.0 to 74.6) in the miso-
prostol-alone group (relative risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.43). Uterine aspiration 
was performed less frequently in the mifepristone-pretreatment group than in the 
misoprostol-alone group (8.8% vs. 23.5%; relative risk, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.68). 
Bleeding that resulted in blood transfusion occurred in 2.0% of the women in the 
mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 0.7% of the women in the misoprostol-
alone group (P 
= 
0.31); pelvic infection was diagnosed in 1.3% of the women in 
each group.
CONCLUSIONS
Pretreatment with mifepristone followed by treatment with misoprostol resulted 
in a higher likelihood of successful management of first-trimester pregnancy loss 
than treatment with misoprostol alone. (Funded by the National Institute of Child

F
irst-trimester miscarriage, or early 
pregnancy loss, is the most common com-
plication in pregnancy and affects approxi-
mately 1 million women in the United States 
annually.1,2 Subtypes of early pregnancy loss in-
clude anembryonic gestation and embryonic or 
fetal death, inevitable abortion, and incomplete 
abortion.3,4 Before the advent of home pregnancy 
testing and early ultrasonography, women often 
presented with heavy bleeding or signs of infec-
tion requiring prompt treatment with dilation 
and curettage.5 Currently, women frequently re-
ceive a diagnosis of early pregnancy loss before 
the onset of symptoms. This decrease in exigent 
presentations has led to an interest in pursuing 
nonsurgical treatment options for pregnancy 
loss.6,7 Although some women pursue expectant 
management, women generally prefer active 
management6,8-12; the ability to have control over 
the management of miscarriage may relieve some 
of the emotional burden that accompanies first-
trimester pregnancy loss.12-14
Medical management of early pregnancy loss 
with prostaglandin analogues allows for planned, 
expedited expulsion of the nonviable pregnancy 
tissue, with the goal of avoiding a surgical pro-
cedure. Misoprostol is stable at room tempera-
ture and can be administered by the woman 
herself, which allows the tissue expulsion to 
occur in the privacy of a woman’s home at a time 
she chooses.15 Medical management is highly 
desired by many women, and the use of miso-
prostol is recommended by society guidelines in 
the United States and throughout the world.16,17 
Unfortunately, the standard dose of 800 μg of 
misoprostol, administered vaginally, has low ef-
ficacy among women with a closed cervical os. 
As many as 15 to 40% of such women require a 
second dose of misoprostol, which prolongs the 
treatment period, or ultimately require the uterine 
evacuation procedure they wished to avoid.3,7-9,18 
The rate of failure diminishes the clinical use-
fulness of this strategy in practice.12
Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid that acts as a 
competitive progesterone-receptor antagonist and 
a glucocorticoid-receptor antagonist and primes 
the myometrium and cervix for prostaglandin 
activity.15,19,20 The reported effectiveness of com-
bination treatment with mifepristone and miso-
prostol for early pregnancy loss has ranged from 
52 to 95%.3,10,11,21,22 This wide range is due in part 
to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome 
definitions.3 To date, the usefulness of mifepris-
tone in the treatment of early pregnancy loss has 
remained unclear. We performed a randomized 
trial to compare the efficacy and safety of pre-
treatment with mifepristone followed by treat-
ment with misoprostol with misoprostol use 
alone for the management of anembryonic ges-
tation and embryonic or fetal death in women in 
clinically stable condition who have a closed 
cervical os.
Methods
Trial Design
From May 2014 through April 2017, women who 
received a diagnosis of anembryonic gestation or 
embryonic or fetal death were referred to the 
study team for screening; an investigator con-
firmed eligibility before enrollment. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent. The 
Comparative Effectiveness of Pregnancy Failure 
Management Regimens (PreFaiR) trial was ap-
proved by the institutional review boards at the 
University of Pennsylvania, the University of Cali-
fornia, Davis, and the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine. All the authors vouch for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the data and analyses 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
Mifepristone (Mifeprex) was purchased from the 
manufacturer (Danco Laboratories) at a research 
price for use in the trial and was dispensed at 
the trial sites; the manufacturer had no other 
role in the trial. The protocol, including the sta-
tistical analysis plan, is available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org.
Participants
Healthy women 18 years of age or older were 
eligible if they had an ultrasound examination 
that showed a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy 
between 5 and 12 completed weeks of gestation. 
We excluded women who had an incomplete or 
inevitable abortion (defined as the absence of a 
gestational sac, an open cervical os, or both) 
because of the high efficacy of misoprostol use 
alone in women with these diagnoses.4 Women 
were also excluded if they had a contraindication 
to mifepristone or misoprostol, had any evidence 
of a viable or ectopic pregnancy, had a hemoglo-
bin level lower than 9.5 g per deciliter, had a

known clotting defect or were receiving antico-
agulants, had a pregnancy with an intrauterine 
device in place, or were unwilling to adhere to 
the trial protocol.
Trial Procedures
We randomly assigned the participants to receive 
pretreatment with 200 mg of mifepristone, ad-
ministered orally, followed by 800 μg of miso-
prostol, administered vaginally approximately 24 
hours later (mifepristone-pretreatment group), 
or standard therapy with 800 μg of misoprostol 
alone, administered vaginally (misoprostol-alone 
group), on trial day 1. Participants were randomly 
assigned in permuted blocks of two to eight, 
stratified according to trial site, with the use of 
Research Electronic Data Capture software 
(REDCap, Vanderbilt University). Women who 
were assigned to the mifepristone-pretreatment 
group swallowed the mifepristone in front of 
one of the trial staff members. In accordance 
with our pragmatic trial design, the women in 
the misoprostol-alone group did not receive pla-
cebo.23 We instructed all participants in both 
treatment groups to insert four misoprostol tab-
lets (200 μg per tablet) vaginally at home approxi-
mately 24 hours after randomization. We offered 
women oral analgesics according to the local 
standards at each trial site. Trial staff provided 
each participant a diary to record information 
about bleeding, symptoms, and pain medication 
use. Participants were scheduled for an initial 
follow-up appointment at least 24 hours (but not 
more than 4 days) after misoprostol use (trial 
day 3).
At the initial follow-up visit, an investigator 
who was unaware of the treatment-group assign-
ments assessed the outcome by means of endo-
vaginal ultrasonography. If the gestational sac 
was absent, a follow-up telephone call was 
scheduled approximately 1 week after random-
ization. If the gestational sac was present, we 
offered women a second dose of misoprostol or 
expectant or surgical management. Participants 
who chose expectant management or a second 
dose of misoprostol returned for an additional 
follow-up visit approximately 8 days (range, 6 to 
12) after randomization for evaluation by an 
investigator who was unaware of the treatment-
group assignments. We contacted all participants 
by telephone 30 days (range, 25 to 36) after 
randomization to collect information about ad-
ditional treatments or adverse events. At this 
time, participants assessed bleeding and pain 
(on Likert scales, on which scores ranged from 
1 to 5, with lower scores indicating greater bleed-
ing and pain) and responded to standard ques-
tions regarding the acceptability of treatment.8,24,25
Outcomes and Adverse Events
The primary outcome was gestational sac expul-
sion by the first follow-up visit with one dose of 
misoprostol and no additional surgical or medi-
cal intervention within 30 days after treatment; 
the attainment of the primary outcome was clas-
sified as treatment success. We chose this pri-
mary outcome in accordance with patient prefer-
ences for the treatment to work promptly and 
effectively. We also planned assessments of the 
treatment outcomes at the day 8 and day 30 time 
points according to three commonly used clini-
cal metrics: the rate of gestational sac expulsion 
with one dose of misoprostol, the rate of gesta-
tional sac expulsion with two doses of misopro-
stol, and the percentage of women who under-
went uterine aspiration. Additional prespecified 
secondary outcomes (for which results are pre-
sented in the current report) included adverse 
effects (including bleeding and pain, as measured 
on Likert scales), acceptability of treatment (an 
overall assessment of the treatment, as measured 
on a 3-point scale [with “good” indicating a 
positive experience, “bad” a negative experience, 
or neutral] and with the question, “Would you 
recommend this method of treatment to a 
friend?”), and assessment of clinical characteris-
tics associated with complete gestational sac 
expulsion; assessments of quality of life, costs, 
and biomarkers that predict complete gestational 
sac expulsion were performed, but the data are 
not presented here.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of previous research, we expected 
the rate of treatment success with a single dose 
of misoprostol to be 80 to 90% in the mifepris-
tone-pretreatment group and 60 to 71% in the 
misoprostol-alone group.8,10,18 We estimated that 
a sample size of 134 participants per treatment 
group would provide adequate power to detect a 
15 percentage-point difference in the rate of 
treatment success (85% in the mifepristone-

pretreatment group vs. 70% in the misoprostol-
alone group). Allowing for a single interim 
analysis under a group sequential design and a 
loss to follow-up of 5%, we set an overall re-
cruitment goal of 300 women. Data analysis 
were performed with Stata software, version 15 
(StataCorp). Standard descriptive methods were 
used to summarize the trial population overall 
and by treatment group. The primary outcome 
was assessed among all women who had at least 
one follow-up visit according to a preplanned 
modified intention-to-treat principle. After test-
ing for homogeneity of the primary outcome 
among trial sites, we calculated the percentage 
(with 95% confidence interval) of women in each 
treatment group who had treatment success and 
compared the results using two-sided Mantel–
Haenszel combined relative risks at an alpha 
level of 0.047 (an alpha level of 0.003 was allo-
cated to the interim analysis). We computed the 
effect of loss to follow-up by performing a sen-
sitivity analysis in which the outcome that was 
most in favor of no treatment effect (i.e., failure 
in the mifepristone-pretreatment group and suc-
cess in the misoprostol-alone group) was assigned 
to each participant who was lost to follow-up.
Subgroup analyses of the primary outcome 
according to patient demographics and clinical 
characteristics were prespecified; we performed 
analyses that were stratified according to gesta-
tional age, parity, gravidity, and diagnosis (em-
bryonic or fetal death vs. anembryonic gesta-
tion). (The protocol also specified an analysis 
according to presenting symptoms, but this was 
not performed owing to the low percentage of 
participants who presented with bleeding.) Two-
sided Mantel–Haenszel combined relative risks 
were used to compare treatment groups in all 
secondary analyses; the results are presented 
without adjustment for multiplicity and should 
be considered exploratory. In accordance with 
the protocol, the data and safety monitoring 
committee performed one interim analysis for 
safety and futility after recruitment of half the 
participants; on the basis of the findings from 
this interim analysis, the trial was continued.
Results
Participants
From May 2014 through April 2017, we assessed 
800 women for eligibility; 497 women were ex-
cluded and 303 consented to participate (Fig. 1). 
The most common reason for declining partici-
pation was a preference for uterine aspiration

over medical management. Of the 303 women 
enrolled, 3 did not meet screening criteria for 
inclusion; thus, 300 women underwent random-
ization, with 149 assigned to the mifepristone-
pretreatment group and 151 assigned to the 
misoprostol-alone group. All the participants 
completed the trial according to the protocol 
with the exception of 2 women who were lost to 
follow-up and 1 woman who was determined 
to be clinically ineligible after randomization 
because of suspicion of a cesarean-section-scar 
ectopic pregnancy (an ectopic pregnancy im-
planted in scar tissue from a previous cesarean 
section). Baseline characteristics were similar in 
the two treatment groups (Table 1).
Outcomes
Initial Follow-up
The median number of days between the time of 
misoprostol administration and the first follow-
up visit was 2.0 (range, 0.5 to 5.5) in the mife-
pristone-pretreatment group and 2.6 (range, 0.7 
to 9.6) in the misoprostol-alone group (P 
= 
0.04). 
Treatment success by the first follow-up visit, 
with no additional interventions needed within 
30 days after treatment, occurred in 124 of 148 
women (83.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
76.8 to 89.3) in the mifepristone-pretreatment 
group and in 100 of 149 women (67.1%; 95% CI, 
59.0 to 74.6) in the misoprostol-alone group 
(absolute difference in the rate of treatment suc-
cess, 16.7 percentage points [95% CI, 7.1 to 
26.3]; relative risk of expulsion with one dose of 
misoprostol, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.43]) (Ta-
ble 2). The results were similar in a sensitivity 
analysis that assumed that the outcomes in the 
women who were lost to follow-up were most in 
favor of no treatment effect (i.e., treatment fail-
ure with mifepristone pretreatment and treat-
ment success with misoprostol alone) (relative 
risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38). In the mifepris-
tone-pretreatment group, 65 women (43.6%) did 
not wait the full 24 hours before administering 
misoprostol (mean [±SD] number of hours wait-
ed, 12.0±7.3), of whom 45 (69.2%) waited for less 
than 18 hours. The rate of treatment success 
among women who not wait the full 24 hours 
before administering misoprostol was 79.7%, as 
compared with 86.9% among the women who 
waited for 24 hours (P 
= 
0.24). The number 
needed to pretreat with mifepristone to attain an 
additional outcome of treatment success by the 
first follow-up visit was 6.
Day 8 Follow-up
Gestational sac expulsion did not occur by the 
first follow-up visit in 24 women in the mifepris-
tone-pretreatment group (16.2%) and in 49 
women in the misoprostol-alone group (32.9%); 
among these women, 41% chose expectant man-
agement, 27% chose a second dose of misopro-
stol, and 31% underwent uterine aspiration (Ta-
ble S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org). Among the women who did not 
have treatment success by the first follow-up 
visit, there were no significant between-group 
differences in the proportion of women who 
chose each additional intervention (P 
= 
0.12). 
Complete expulsion of the gestational sac with 
one dose of misoprostol by day 8 occurred in 
130 of 148 women (87.8%; 95% CI, 81.5 to 92.6) 
in mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 106 
of 149 women (71.1%; 95% CI, 63.2 to 78.3) in 
the misoprostol-alone group (relative risk, 1.23; 
95% CI, 1.10 to 1.39).
Day 30 Follow-up
One month after randomization, the cumulative 
rate of gestational sac expulsion with up to two 
doses of misoprostol was 91.2% (95% CI, 85.4 
to 95.2) in the mifepristone-pretreatment group 
and 75.8% (95% CI, 68.2 to 82.5) in the miso-
prostol-alone group. By the end of the trial period 
at day 30, a total of 13 women (8.8%; 95% CI, 
4.8 to 14.6) in the mifepristone-pretreatment 
group and 35 women (23.5%; 95% CI, 16.9 to 
31.1) in the misoprostol-alone group had under-
gone uterine aspiration (absolute difference, 14.7 
percentage points [95% CI, 6.5 to 22.9]; relative 
risk, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.68]) (Table 2).
We performed subgroup analyses stratified ac-
cording to length of gestation, parity, gravidity, 
and diagnosis (embryonic or fetal death vs. anem-
bryonic gestation). Rates of treatment success by 
the first follow-up visit among women who were 
at 9 weeks of gestation or less were 84.8% (117 of 
138 women) in the mifepristone-pretreatment 
group and 66.7% (94 of 141 women) in the 
misoprostol-alone group. No significant between-
group differences were found in the effect of the 
intervention according to subgroups stratified by 
gestation, gravidity, parity, or diagnosis (Fig. 2).

end of the trial period, 89.4% of the women in 
the mifepristone-pretreatment group and 87.4% 
in the misoprostol-alone group described their 
experience overall as either “good” or “neutral”; 
the corresponding percentages of women who 
stated that they would recommend their treatment 
method to a friend were 87.0% and 89.6%. The 
majority of women in each group (69.1% in 
the mifepristone-pretreatment group and 64.8% 
the misoprostol-alone group) also stated that they 
would use medical management if they had an-
other pregnancy loss.
Discussion
In this randomized trial involving women with 
anembryonic gestation or in whom embryonic or 
fetal death was confirmed, pretreatment with 
mifepristone followed by treatment with miso-
prostol resulted in a significantly higher rate of 
complete gestational sac expulsion by approxi-
mately 2 days after treatment than misoprostol 
use alone. Pretreatment with mifepristone also 
resulted in a significantly lower rate of uterine 
aspiration than misoprostol use alone.
Even in the context of our pragmatic trial 
design in which women received routine clinical 
care after the first follow-up visit, we had high 
rates of participant retention and adherence to 
the protocol. Our trial population was diverse 
with respect to sociodemographic status and 
pregnancy diagnosis, which supports the gener-
alizability of the results. We did not include a 
placebo group in this pragmatic trial. Because 
the primary outcome was not reported by the 
participants but was assessed by an investigator 
who was unaware of the treatment-group assign-
ments, we do not expect that the lack of a placebo 
group introduced bias related to the primary 
outcome. It is possible that secondary efficacy 
outcomes could have been affected, because 
women in the misoprostol-alone group who did 
not have gestational sac expulsion by the first 
follow-up visit might have been less willing to 
wait (i.e., to choose expectant management) un-
til day 8 for tissue expulsion than those in the 
mifepristone-pretreatment group, but we did not 
find that the proportion of additional interven-
tions differed significantly between the treatment 
groups. We allowed for a short range of days at

Treatment success was defined as gestational sac expulsion with one misoprostol dose by the first follow-up visit and 
no additional intervention within 30 days after treatment.
‡  
The rate of treatment success by the first follow-up visit was significantly higher in the mifepristone-pretreatment group 
than in misoprostol-alone group (P<0.001).

which we initially assessed the primary outcome 
to accommodate the scheduling preferences of the 
participants. The slightly longer mean elapsed 
time between misoprostol use and follow-up as-
sessment in the misoprostol-alone group would 
have biased against the benefit of pretreatment, 
even though a significant benefit of pretreat-
ment was found.
We evaluated the 800-μg dose of misoprostol, 
administered vaginally, because this dose and 
route of administration were best supported by 
the literature at the time of the development of 
our protocol.3,10,26 Misoprostol can also be admin-
istered orally, rectally, buccally, or sublingually. 
Administration through the buccal route results 
in uterine tone and activity that are similar to 
those with the vaginal route,27 and the sublin-
gual route results in more rapid absorption and 
higher peak levels than the vaginal route.28 When 
misoprostol is used to induce a first-trimester 
abortion, vaginal administration is more effec-
tive than oral administration and may have 
fewer side effects than the sublingual or buccal 
route.29 Vaginal administration also permits ef-
ficacy at an interval of less than 24 hours after 
mifepristone administration among patients un-
dergoing abortion.25,30,31 Many of our participants 
chose not to wait the full 24 hours between 
mifepristone pretreatment and misoprostol use; 
future studies could test whether a shorter inter-
val between the administration of these medica-
tions affects the efficacy of treatment for early 
pregnancy loss.
In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration 
first approved mifepristone for use with miso-
prostol to end an early pregnancy. This approval 
included Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy 
requirements with the stated goal of mitigating 
the risk of serious complications associated with 
use of the drug. Although our study was not 
powered to show differences between groups 
in the proportions of serious adverse events, 
such events were rare — a finding that is con-
sistent with the results of other published stud-
Figure 2. Clinical Outcomes among Women Who Received Medical Treatment for Early Pregnancy Loss, Stratified According to Clinical 
Characteristics.
Treatment success was defined as gestational sac expulsion with one dose of misoprostol by the first follow-up visit and no additional 
intervention within 30 days after treatment. P values were calculated from tests of interaction between the treatment groups and the 
subgroup variables.

Mifepristone Pretreatment for Early Pregnancy Loss
ies.11,21,24,26,32 Studies of the use of mifepristone 
for induced abortion or for the treatment of 
early pregnancy loss have not shown a risk pro-
file that supports such regulatory limitations on 
prescription.33,34
In conclusion, this randomized trial showed 
that pretreatment with mifepristone followed by 
treatment with misoprostol resulted in a higher 
likelihood of prompt and effective treatment of 
early pregnancy loss than misoprostol use 
alone.

The rates for the total number of serious adverse events and mean number of adverse events were compared with the use of incidence rate 
ratios, with adjustment for trial site. The percentages of women who had each type of adverse event were compared with the use of relative 
risks that were adjusted for trial site with the Mantel–Haenszel method.
