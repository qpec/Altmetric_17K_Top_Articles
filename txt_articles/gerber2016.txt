IMPORTANCE Early-life antibiotic exposure has been associated with increased adiposity in
animal models, mediated through the gut microbiome. Infant antibiotic exposure is common
and often inappropriate. Studies of the association between infant antibiotics and childhood
weight gain have reported inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between early-life antibiotic exposure and childhood
weight gain.
DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective, longitudinal study of singleton births and matched
longitudinal study of twin pairs conducted in a network of 30 pediatric primary care practices
serving more than 200 000 children of diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds across
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.
PARTICIPANTS Children born between November 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011,
at 35 weeks’gestational age or older, with birth weight of 2000 g or more and in the
fifth percentile or higher for gestational age, and who had a preventive health visit within
14 days of life and at least 2 additional visits in the first year of life. Children with complex
chronic conditions and those who received long-term antibiotics or multiple systemic
corticosteroid prescriptions were excluded. We included 38 522 singleton children and 92
twins (46 matched pairs) discordant in antibiotic exposure. Final date of follow-up was
December 31, 2012.
EXPOSURE Systemic antibiotic use in the first 6 months of life.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Weight, measured at preventive health visits from age 6
months through 7 years.
RESULTS Of 38 522 singleton children (50% female; mean birth weight, 3.4 kg), 5287 (14%)
were exposed to antibiotics during the first 6 months of life (at a mean age of 4.3 months).
Antibiotic exposure was not significantly associated with rate of weight change (0.7%;
95% CI, −0.1% to 1.5%; P = .07, equivalent to approximately 0.05 kg; 95% CI, −0.004
to 0.11 kg of added weight gain between age 2 years and 5 years). Among 92 twins (38%
female; mean birth weight, 2.8 kg), the 46 twins who were exposed to antibiotics
during the first 6 months of life received them at a mean age of 4.5 months. Antibiotic
exposure was not significantly associated with a weight difference (−0.09 kg; 95% CI,
−0.26 to 0.08 kg; P = .30).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to antibiotics within the first 6 months of life
compared with no exposure was not associated with a statistically significant difference in
weight gain through age 7 years. There are many reasons to limit antibiotic exposure in
young, healthy children, but weight gain is likely not one of them.

A
ntibiotics are the most commonly prescribed medica-
tions for children,1 and many of these prescriptions are
inappropriate.2 The costs of antibiotic overuse, includ-
ing antibiotic resistance3 and adverse drug effects,4 are well
documented. The long-term health effects of antibiotic expo-
sure, however, are relatively unknown.
Antibiotics promote growth in livestock, and it has been
hypothesized that this occurs because of structural and
functional alterations of the gut microbiome.5 Short-term
antibiotic use can result in persistent changes in the human
gut microbiome.6 Mice given antibiotics had altered gut
microbiome composition, changed carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism, and increased adiposity compared with control
animals.7 Fecal transplants in mice using stool from humans
transferred the donor obesity phenotype (obese/lean) to
recipient mice.8
Observational studies have reported associations be-
tweenantibioticexposureandbodymassinchildren.9-12These
associations, however, have been inconsistent both within and
across studies, potentially because of differences in the set-
ting, population, and indication for antibiotics or because of
the use of different outcome and exposure definitions, ana-
lyticapproaches,andobservationwindows.13Becausethepub-
lic health implications of this proposed association are pro-
found, we evaluated the association between early-life
antibiotic exposure and weight gain by means of growth tra-
jectory modeling using a singleton birth cohort of nearly
40 000 children and an analysis of twin pairs who were dis-
cordant in early-life antibiotic exposure.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
The Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia Committee for the Pro-
tection of Human Subjects approved the study and granted a
waiver of consent.
A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study assessed the as-
sociation of early-life antibiotic exposures with childhood
weight using 2 separate cohorts within the same population:
(1) a retrospective, longitudinal study of singleton births and
(2) a matched longitudinal study of twin pairs discordant in
early-life antibiotic exposure. Data came from a network of 30
pediatric primary care practices with a common electronic
health record (Epic Systems) serving children of diverse ra-
cialandsocioeconomicbackgroundsacrosssoutheasternPenn-
sylvania, southern New Jersey, and northern Delaware.
Study Population
Children were included if they were born between 2001 and
2011 at 35 weeks’gestational age or older with a birth weight
of 2000 g or more and in the fifth percentile for gestational
age14 and who had a preventive health visit within 14 days of
life and at least 2 additional visits in the first year (to include
only children likely to have received the majority of their care
within the network). The observation period started at the first
visit and ended with the last visit before their eighth birthday
or December 31, 2012, whichever occurred first.
Children with complex chronic conditions (derived from
a published algorithm15) that might affect antibiotic use or
growth, who were prescribed long-term antibiotics (≥30 days
or ≥2 refills), or who received more than 2 systemic cortico-
steroid prescriptions during any 365-day period up to age 8
years were excluded. Identification of a complex chronic con-
dition was not limited to the primary exposure window be-
cause even though a diagnosis might have been identified and
recorded after the exposure period, the condition was likely
already present. Although exclusion of chronic steroid use
throughout the study period would prevent identification of
an association between antibiotic exposure and growth me-
diated by steroid use (eg, early-life antibiotics cause atopy,
which is treated with steroids, which affect weight), the rela-
tionship between steroid exposure and growth has been pre-
viously established and is not the broadly hypothesized (and
animal model–supported) microbiome-mediated mecha-
nism by which antibiotics might affect growth. Data were ob-
tained from a comprehensive electronic health record used ex-
clusivelybyallpracticesforallofficeandtelephoneencounters
since 2001.
Exposure
The primary exposure was antibiotic use in the first 6 months
of life, chosen to mimic the time window when microbiome
perturbation has been shown to be most influential in animal
models.16 Antibiotic use in the first 24 months was examined
as a secondary exposure. Antibiotic use was identified by pre-
scriptionsforsystemic(oral,intramuscular,orintravenous)an-
tibacterial agents. Any duration of therapy was included ex-
cept oral therapy for less than 3 days (manual chart review
revealedthattheseshort-termprescriptionsweretypicallycan-
celed or changed); 95% of prescriptions were between 5 and
10daysinduration.Newantibioticprescriptionsinitiatedmore
than 14 days after prior antibiotic prescriptions were consid-
ered separate courses. Exposure was classified by drug cat-
egory to differentiate narrow-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and
macrolideexposure(eTable1intheSupplement).Exposuresta-
tus was analyzed as binary (≥1 course vs none) and multilevel
(0, 1, 2, and ≥3 courses) categorical variables.
Outcome
The primary outcome was longitudinally measured weight in
the first 8 years of life, used to model growth trajectory via
changes in weight. For the primary exposure, only growth
measurements obtained beyond 6 months were used for
modeling growth trajectories (and beyond 24 months for the
secondary exposure). Weight was selected as the primary
outcome over body mass index (BMI) because BMI (as a ratio
measure) can introduce bias and spurious correlations in
regression settings.17 Furthermore, in the first 24 months
of life, BMI is not calculated because length is measured
as opposed to height. Only weight measurements from
preventive health encounters were included because of con-
cern about less reliable measurements at acute care encoun-
ters. Weight measurements identified as likely errors
using an automated method (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement)
were excluded.18

Covariates
Patient demographic variables included sex, Medicaid insur-
ance status, race (black vs nonblack, self-reported using op-
tions defined by all practices across the health care network;
race has previously been shown to be associated with both an-
tibiotic prescribing and growth trajectory19), household den-
sity (number of older siblings aged <21 years in household at
birth, categorized as none, 1-2, 3-4, or ≥5), and birth year. Base-
line anthropometric measures included weight at birth and
length at first visit. Primary care practice was assigned using
the practice visited most frequently.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis for the singleton cohort evaluated
the relationship between early antibiotic exposure and
weight trajectory using longitudinal rate regression models, a
nonlinear method well suited for examining growth
trajectories.20 This model uses a proportional rate assump-
tion and a general time trajectory function to estimate the
difference in rate of change for an outcome (weight) associ-
ated with an exposure (antibiotics). The rate parameter for
early antibiotic exposure represents the percent difference in
rate of weight gain for a typical child exposed to antibiotics
compared with the rate in an unexposed child. As an alterna-
tive interpretation, models can estimate the difference in
accumulated weight between ages 2 and 5 years for exposed
relative to unexposed. These differences can be interpreted
as the added weight change associated with the rate differ-
ence between exposure groups, referred to as the attributable
weight difference.
Growth trajectories were modeled using a natural cubic
regression spline with knots at 500 and 1100 days21-24 for the
6-month exposure models; a single knot at 1100 days was
used for the 24-month model. Unlike conventional longitudi-
nal regressions, the longitudinal rate regression model allows
for covariate adjustment at both rate and mean levels. Mean-
level covariates (sex, birth weight, race, Medicaid insurance
status, number of siblings, birth year, baseline length, and
primary care site) account for overall differences in weight
associated with a covariate, which is characterized by the
estimated difference in weight at baseline (ie, groups that are
bigger or smaller at birth). Rate-level covariates (same as
above except for primary care site, which was replaced by
urban/faculty vs nonurban/nonfaculty setting) account for
differences in growth trajectories associated with a covariate
(ie, groups that grow at faster or slower rates). All covariates
were centered on their respective sample means at the rate
level to allow for interpretation of the parameter of interest
relative to an average individual. Because of missingness for
race (13% missing data), a multiple imputation approach with
5 replicates was used for the primary model (eAppendix 1 in
the Supplement).25 Predictors used in this imputation were
sex, insurance type, gestational age, primary care site, num-
ber of siblings, birth weight, and standardized weight z score
at last measurement. Assessment of variability due to impu-
tation showed that the added component of variance due to
variability in the parameter of interest across replicates was
sufficiently small that only single imputation was used for
all secondary models (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Correla-
tion between repeated measures within individual was
adjusted for using random effects for both intercept and rate
of change. This longitudinal model was replicated for each
definition of early antibiotic exposure previously described.
Sensitivity analyses evaluated whether exposure misclassifi-
cation attenuated associations that would be clinically mean-
ingful (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
For a complementary, prespecified analysis designed to
control for unmeasured environmental (eg, household smok-
ing, diet, hygiene) or genetic factors that might confound the
relationship between antibiotic use and weight gain, twin
sets discordant in early-life antibiotic use were identified.
Differences over time were modeled in all paired weight mea-
surements of twins (weight of exposed twin minus weight of
unexposed twin) at each measurement time using linear
mixed-effects regression controlling for sex, birth weight,
and baseline length. Thus, the coefficient for time represents
the association of early antibiotic exposure with weight dif-
ference between twins.
Hypothesis tests were 2-sided and a significance thresh-
old of P < .05 was used. Analyses were performed using
Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp) and R version 3.0.1.
Calculations performed during project planning for the
singleton cohort, based on preliminary data and a projected
sample size of 40 100, estimated 80% power to detect a dif-
ferenceingrowthtrajectoriesof4%ofastandarddeviationand
90% power to detect a difference of 5% of a standard devia-
tion, both extremely small effects. A projected sample of 50

mated to have 80% to 90% power to demonstrate 4% to 5%

Results
Study Cohort
In the entire network, 56 567 children were born between
2001 and 2011 and had a primary care visit in the first 14
days of life. Of these, 44 737 children met inclusion criteria
and 38 614 remained eligible for analyses after exclusions
(38 522 singletons and 92 twins) (Figure 1). Demographic
characteristics of the singleton and twin cohorts are shown
in Table 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement, respectively (for
24-month exposure windows, see eTables 4 and 5 in the
Supplement).
Antibiotic Exposure
In the first 6 months of life, 5287 singleton children (14%)
were exposed to antibiotics at a mean age of 4.3 months
(eFigure in the Supplement), of whom 24% received broad-
spectrum agents and 5% macrolides. Most of the exposed
(79%) received only 1 course. The percentage of children
exposed to any antibiotics increased to 67% by 24 months
of age, of whom 52% received broad-spectrum agents and
19% macrolides.

Primary Exposure
Exposure to any antibiotic in the first 6 months was not asso-
ciated with rate of change in weight (0.7%; 95% CI, −0.1% to
1.5%; P = .07) (Table 2). The estimated increase in the rate of
change in weight was equivalent to 0.05 kg (95% CI, −0.004
to 0.11 kg) of attributable weight difference between 2 and 5
years of age. Subanalyses by number of antibiotic courses
(1, 2, or ≥3) and by antibiotic type (narrow spectrum, broad
spectrum, or macrolide) did not find significant associations
between antibiotic exposure and rate of change in weight. The
Wald test for overall differences in the rate effect across groups
defined by antibiotic type did not approach conventional lev-
els of statistical significance (P = .51).
Secondary Exposure
Exposure to any antibiotic in the first 24 months was associ-
ated with a 2.1% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.3%; P = .001) increase in the
rate of change in weight (Table 2), equivalent to an attribut-
able weight difference of 0.15 kg (95% CI, 0.06-0.24 kg) be-
tween 2 and 5 years of age (or gaining, on average, 7.34 kg in-
stead of 7.19 kg during this 3-year period). Subanalyses by
number of antibiotic courses and by antibiotic type revealed
similar estimated changes in growth trajectory, ranging from
alowof1.8%(95%CI,0.4%-3.3%;P = .01)for1antibioticcourse
to a high of 2.4% for 3 or more courses (95% CI, 0.9%-3.9%;
P = .002) and macrolides (95% CI, 0.6%-4.2%; P = .009). The
Wald test for overall differences in the rate effect across groups
defined by antibiotic type was statistically significant (P = .01).
Figure 2 shows growth curves, adjusted for mean- and rate-
level confounders, by antibiotic exposure in the first 6 months
(panel A) and first 24 months (panel B).
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses to assess the statistical effect of potential exposure
misclassification assumed that misclassification was strongly
associated with increased weight gain. For example, we as-
sumed that some children who gained more weight but had
no observed exposure to antibiotics actually were exposed and
that some children who did not gain weight but were pre-
scribed antibiotics actually did not take them. In this ex-
treme scenario, the estimated upper bound for any antibiotic
exposure was a 3.5% (95% CI, 2.7%-4.4%; P < .001) rate dif-
ference (0.26 kg [95% CI, 0.20-0.32 kg] attributable weight dif-
ference) for the 6-month exposure (eAppendix 2, eTable 6, and
eTable 7 in the Supplement).

Discussion
Inalarge,diversebirthcohortof40 000childrenwithinacom-
prehensivepediatriccarenetwork,astatisticallysignificantas-
sociation between antibiotic use in the first 6 months of life
and weight trajectory was not observed. Secondary analyses
of antibiotic exposure in the first 24 months was associated
withasmallbutstatisticallysignificantincreaseinweightgain,
equivalent to roughly 150 g over 3 years. These findings
do not support a clinically meaningful association of early-
life antibiotic use with childhood weight gain.
Previous studies reported associations between anti-
biotic use and obesity. A systematic review of 10 random-
ized clinical trials concluded that antibiotics had growth-
promoting effects on young children from middle- and
low-income countries27; however, given the fundamental dif-
ferences observed in the structure and function of the micro-
biome in children with clinically significant malnutrition,28
these findings may not be generalizable to all children. Stud-
ies of children from developed nations have reported mixed
results. Ajslev et al9 found that exposure to antibiotics in the
first 6 months of life was associated with a higher risk of
being overweight at age 7 years in children with normal-
weight mothers but a decreased risk in children with over-
weight mothers, and Trasande et al10 observed that antibiotic
exposure in the first 6 months of life was associated with an
increase in body mass between 10 and 38 months but not at 7
years. Both studies relied on parent recall of antibiotic use for
the year preceding the interview, a possible source of bias.
Bailey et al11 found an association between one of several
exposure categories tested (>3 broad-spectrum courses in the
first 24 months) and obesity measured at any time during
years 3 to 5, and Saari et al12 found associations between
infant antibiotic exposures and first BMI measurement at 24
months of age or older.
This study features important differences in design
and analysis from prior studies. The primary exposure—
antibiotics within the first 6 months of life—was chosen based

on the biological mechanism through which antibiotics in-
crease adiposity in experimental animals: perturbations in the
developing gut microbiome.7,16 The lack of an association in
subanalyses of children exposed to repeated antibiotic courses
and those given agents that would target a broader range of
gut microbiota supports our conclusions. Because prior stud-
ies reported associations between antibiotic exposure through
24 months of life and obesity,11,12 this time window was ex-
amined in secondary analyses to allow for comparison. Herein,
the roughly 2% increase in weight trajectory was equivalent
to a child gaining an additional 150 g between 2 and 5 years of
age; the statistical significance likely reflects the robust sta-
tistical power afforded by the sample size instead of a clini-
cally meaningful difference.
Additionally, twin pairs discordant in early antibiotic ex-
posurewereexaminedtoaddressthepotentialinfluenceofen-
vironmental and genetic factors that might not have been ac-
counted for in the adjusted analyses of the singleton cohort.
The narrow confidence intervals in the results from the twin
cohort make clinically important weight gain associated with
antibiotic exposure unlikely (either by 6 months or 24 months
of age).
The primary outcome measure, weight trajectory over
time, also differs from prior studies. Weight was selected as
the primary outcome rather than BMI because BMI as a ratio
measure can introduce bias and spurious correlations in
regression settings.17 Furthermore, modeling weight unad-
justed for stature (length or height) was deemed a more
appropriate outcome for addressing the question of whether
antibiotic exposure is associated with overall increases in
size. Because no association was found between antibiotic
exposure and weight gain, additional adjustment for length
or height would not be expected to affect the observed
results unless antibiotic exposure affects stature, but this
potential effect of antibiotic exposure lacks a biological basis.
To reduce measurement error, only anthropometric measure-
ments obtained at well-child visits were included, and an
automated, reproducible method was used to exclude mea-
surements identified as likely errors. Changes in weight tra-
jectories over time were modeled to reflect the association of
the exposure with weight gain based on a microbiome
mechanism. The analysis of weight trajectories also avoids
misclassification biases that can arise when continuous out-
comes are dichotomized.29 For example, if analyzing “time to
obesity,” the outcome assesses only small (and potentially
transient) weight increases in children on the borderline of
the 95th percentile of weight (or other dichotomous criteria)
but ignores subsequent weight changes that drop these chil-
dren below this threshold and does not assess weight
changes in nonoverweight children (ie, the majority of the

a Longitudinal rate regression model
results for weight against antibiotic
exposures in separate models.
Mean- and rate-level adjustment
included sex, birth weight, race,
Medicaid insurance status,
number of siblings, birth year,
baseline length, and urban/faculty
practices (full site adjustment at
the mean level).
bWeight change for a typical
unexposed child was estimated
based on the difference in model
estimates of the reference time
function at ages 5 years and 2 years.
c Estimates are adjusted for missing
race using multiple imputation with
5 replicates; all other models use
single imputation because of
minimal variation across replicates.
dWald test for overall group
differences resulted in P = .51.
e The observable difference in the
estimated weight change for a
typical unexposed child for this
model compared with other models
of 6-month antibiotic exposure is
likely due to the small subsample of
infants exposed to macrolides at 6
months (0.7% of the sample), which
overly influenced the reference time
function as a result of the
proportional rate assumption.
f Wald test for overall group
differences resulted in P = .01.

population). Thus, assessing the association of antibiotics
with weight gain in all children was deemed most appropri-
ate. The differences in results from prior studies highlight the
sensitivity of conclusions in obesity studies to model specifi-
cation and emphasizes the importance of selecting a model
that reflects the biological mechanism in question.
Despite these strengths, this study has potential limita-
tions. As with prior human studies (including those measur-
ing BMI), adiposity could not be assessed. Therefore, it is pos-
siblethatantibioticexposurecouldleadtochangesinadiposity
without affecting overall weight or BMI. Misclassification of
exposure may have occurred if antibiotics were obtained out-
side of the network or if prescribed antibiotics were not taken.
Sensitivity analyses, however, suggest that this bias is insuf-
ficient to explain the lack of meaningful differences between
exposedandunexposedchildren.Also,analternativetimewin-
dow, duration, or spectrum of antimicrobial exposure not ex-
amined in the study could affect child weight gain.7 All pos-
sible factors that might be associated with both antibiotic use
and weight gain, such as genetics, mode of delivery, and in-
fant diet, could not be assessed. However, a matched twin
study, which would account for many of these factors and was
wellpoweredtofindevensmalldifferencesinweightgain,con-
firmed the results. Although confounding by indication is a
common limitation, the indications for the vast majority of an-
tibiotic use for these children were acute respiratory tract in-
fections managed in the ambulatory setting, which have not
previously been associated with long-term weight change in
healthy children. In addition, although the network serves a
population of diverse race, socioeconomic status, and medi-
cal setting (academic and community based) and has an over-
all antibiotic prescription rate similar to national estimates,2,30
it might not be generalizable to children outside of a North
American health care setting, particularly to those with clini-
cally significant malnutrition.
Conclusions
Exposure to antibiotics within the first 6 months of life com-
pared with no exposure was not associated with a statisti-
cally significant difference in weight gain through age 7 years.
There are many reasons to limit antibiotic exposure in young,
healthy children, but weight gain is likely not one of them.
