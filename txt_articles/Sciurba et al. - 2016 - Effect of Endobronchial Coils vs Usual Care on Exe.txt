IMPORTANCE Preliminary clinical trials have demonstrated that endobronchial coils compress
emphysematous lung tissue and may improve lung function, exercise tolerance, and
symptoms in patients with emphysema and severe lung hyperinflation.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness and safety of endobronchial coil treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted among 315 patients
with emphysema and severe air trapping recruited from 21 North American and 5 European
sites from December 2012 through November 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to continue usual care alone (guideline
based, including pulmonary rehabilitation and bronchodilators; n = 157) vs usual care plus
bilateral coil treatment (n = 158) involving 2 sequential procedures 4 months apart in which
10 to 14 coils were bronchoscopically placed in a single lobe of each lung.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary effectiveness outcome was difference in
absolute change in 6-minute-walk distance between baseline and 12 months (minimal
clinically important difference [MCID], 25 m). Secondary end points included the difference
between groups in 6-minute walk distance responder rate, absolute change in quality of life
using the St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire (MCID, 4) and change in forced expiratory
volume in the first second (FEV1; MCID, 10%). The primary safety analysis compared the
proportion of participants experiencing at least 1 of 7 prespecified major complications.
RESULTS Among 315 participants (mean age, 64 years; 52% women), 90% completed the
12-month follow-up. Median change in 6-minute walk distance at 12 months was 10.3 m with
coil treatment vs −7.6 m with usual care, with a between-group difference of 14.6 m
(Hodges-Lehmann 97.5% CI, 0.4 m to �; 1-sided P = .02). Improvement of at least 25 m
occurred in 40.0% of patients in the coil group vs 26.9% with usual care (odds ratio, 1.8 [97.5%
CI, 1.1 to �]; unadjusted between-group difference, 11.8% [97.5% CI, 1.0% to �]; 1-sided P = .01).
The between-group difference in median change in FEV1 was 7.0% (97.5% CI, 3.4% to �; 1-sided
P < .001), and the between-group St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire score improved −8.9
points (97.5% CI, −� to −6.3 points; 1-sided P < .001), each favoring the coil group. Major
complications (including pneumonia requiring hospitalization and other potentially
life-threatening or fatal events) occurred in 34.8% of coil participants vs 19.1% of usual care
(P = .002). Other serious adverse events including pneumonia (20% coil vs 4.5% usual care)
and pneumothorax (9.7% vs 0.6%, respectively) occurred more frequently in the coil group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with emphysema and severe hyperinflation
treated for 12 months, the use of endobronchial coils compared with usual care resulted in an
improvement in median exercise tolerance that was modest and of uncertain clinical
importance, with a higher likelihood of major complications. Further follow-up is needed to
assess long-term effects on health outcomes.

P
atients with advanced emphysema and severe lung hy-
perinflation have few treatment options to relieve
dyspnea.1,2 Lung volume reduction surgery has been
shown to improve lung function, quality of life, and survival
in the subset of patients with advanced, heterogeneous, upper
lobe emphysema.3 However, relatively few patients with em-
physema undergo lung
volume reduction sur-
gery because a minority
have an upper lobe–domi-
nant heterogeneous pat-
tern of destruction and
postoperative complica-
tions can be severe.3-5 A less invasive bronchoscopic ap-
proach targeting patients with heterogeneous emphysema
involves segmental airway placement of unidirectional
valves resulting in lobar collapse and clinical improvement;
however, this approach is still investigational in North
America and restricted to patients without interlobar collat-
eral channels.6-8 Patients with advanced homogeneous
emphysema and/or presence of interlobar collateral ventila-
tion have very limited treatment options, essentially lung
transplantation or palliative support.
Endobronchial coils, 10- to 15-cm nitinol wires that re-
gain their preformed shape following deployment, are de-
signedtocompressemphysematoustissue,thusrestoringelas-
ticpropertiesinadjacentlungtissueandimprovingventilatory
mechanical function. Endobronchial coils have been tested in
patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous lung de-
struction with or without incomplete interlobar fissures. Sev-
eral small clinical trials preliminarily reported that coils may
improve quality of life and exercise tolerance.7,9-14 The re-
cently published REVOLENS randomized clinical trial raised
questions with respect to effectiveness, including durability
of effect, optimal patient selection criteria, multiperformer
technical feasibility, and importance of short- and long-term
adverse events including pneumonia.14 The RENEW trial was
conducted to assess 1-year effectiveness and safety of endo-
bronchial coils on exercise tolerance, quality of life, and lung
function in patients with severe lung hyperinflation and ad-
vanced homogeneous or heterogeneous emphysema.
Methods
Study Oversight and Ethics
The institutional review boards at participating centers ap-
proved the study protocol (Supplement 1), which was over-
seen by an independent data monitoring committee. Patients
were screened only after providing written informed con-
sent. This study was conducted in compliance with the prin-
ciples enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki, the US clini-
cal investigative laws, and those laws appropriate for
participating centers in the European Union and Canada.
Study Participants
The trial enrolled patients aged 35 years or older with medi-
cally optimized emphysema (Figure 1). Participants were
former smokers who recently completed pulmonary reha-
bilitation and/or were participating in exercise mainte-
nance. Self-reported ethnicity and race were collected as
fixed categories per Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium standards to appropriately adjust lung function
and to account for any potential differences by treat-
ment. Key inclusion criteria included postbronchodilator
forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 45%
predicted or less, total lung capacity (TLC) of more than
100% predicted, and residual volume (RV) of at least 225%
predicted. The RV threshold was lowered to at least 175%
predicted following enrollment of 169 patients to ad-
dress the effectiveness and safety of endobronchial coils
in a broader patient population. Severe bronchitis/
bronchiectasis, comorbidities potentially affecting trial
completion, and significant reversible airflow obstruction
(postbronchodilator response >20%) excluded patients from
enrollment (eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Trial Design
This multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded study com-
pared outcomes between treatment and control groups at 12
months. A radiology core laboratory reviewed scans for eli-
gibility, identified lobes for treatment, and classified the
type of emphysema (heterogeneous or homogeneous) (eFig-
ure 1 in Supplement 2) using a semiquantitative visual
assessment (Supplement 1). Upper lobes were preferentially
targeted in patients with homogeneously distributed dis-
ease based on physiologic modeling, preliminary surgical
experience, and a feasibility trial.12,15 Blinded block random-
ization (block size of 4) stratified by type of emphysema
occurred on a 1:1 basis between usual care (control group)
and usual care plus treatment with endobronchial coils
(PneumRx Inc) using a computerized, automated system
(Datatrak IWRS) directed by an independent contractor
(Pharm-Olam International).
Usual care was based on the Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)2 guidelines, whereby treat-
ment was optimized in cooperation with the treating physi-
cian at the pretreatment visit. Each participant was encour-
agedtouseinhaledlong-actingbronchodilatorswithorwithout
inhaled corticosteroids. Current influenza and pneumococ-
cus vaccinations were encouraged. Participants were re-
quired to complete a pulmonary rehabilitation program within
6 months or be performing maintenance rehabilitation prior
to baseline testing. During the posttreatment period, medica-
tion adjustment for treatment of exacerbations was permit-
ted; however, changes to the medical regimen were other-
wisediscouragedandparticipantswereencouragedtocontinue
maintenance rehabilitation.
The treatment group, in addition to receiving usual care,
underwent implantation of 10 to 14 coils under fluoroscopic
guidance via bronchoscopy (eFigures 2 and 3 in Supplement
2). The choice of moderate sedation or general anesthesia
was determined by the investigator. The bronchoscopist
advanced the bronchoscope to the ostium of the target sub-
segmental airway and then advanced a catheter with a guide
wire into the bronchial segment of the treatment lobe to

within a minimum of 3 cm of the pleural surface. The
selected coil length (100, 125, or 150 mm) was based on sub-
segmental airway length. Two sequential single-lobe treat-
ments of contralateral upper or lower lobes were performed
4 months apart (based on a conservative estimate of the
recovery time needed after a bronchoscopy for this severely
affected patient population) (Supplement 1).
Effectiveness Outcomes
All end points compared baseline data vs results at 12 months
after first treatment. Participants were not blinded, although
walk and spirometry measurements were obtained using a
blinded assessor.
The primary effectiveness variable was the difference in
absolute change in 6-minute walk distance between baseline
and 12-month visit. Secondary end points included 6-minute
walk distance response, defined as a 25-m minimal clinically
important difference (MCID)16 in 6-minute walk distance;
mean percent change in FEV1 (MCID, 10%)17; and mean abso-
lute difference in St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire score
(range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating worse quality of
life). Six-minute walk testing, spirometry, and physiologic
testing were performed using established standards, with
participants carrying their oxygen at the prescribed flow rate
when necessary.18-21
Other exploratory effectiveness end points included
St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire response, defined using
a 4-point or greater score reduction as the MCID22; mean ab-
solute difference in RV (MCID, 0.35 L)23 measured by body ple-
thysmography; and mean absolute difference in RV/TLC.

characterized during the course of this trial as coil-
associated opacity (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). The RENEW
data monitoring committee adjudicated the investigator-
reported pneumonia adverse events and determined that
some of these events were misclassified and represented
coil-associated opacity.
Statistical Analysis
Based on previous studies, a sample size of 315 was selected
to provide greater than 95% power to detect a treatment dif-
ference in effectiveness, assuming 5% lost to follow-up and
treatment difference in change in 6-minute walk distance of
59 m (SD, 80 m) (the difference from baseline observed in
early feasibility trials) and in FEV1 of 0.05 L (SD, 0.10 L)
using a 1-sided t test at α = .025.6,24 Comparisons of the coil
group vs usual care in primary and secondary effectiveness
end points were tested using analysis of covariance (or non-
parametric rank analysis of covariance in the presence of
significant skewness) and logistic regression (for 6-minute
walk distance responder end point) controlling for the
covariates of corresponding baseline value, analysis center,
and emphysema status in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analy-
sis. Missing values were imputed 50 times using the Markov
chain Monte Carlo method of multiple imputation. Mean
between-treatment differences adjusted for covariates and,
for data that were significantly skewed, Hodges-Lehmann
median between-treatment differences adjusted for base-
line were reported with associated 97.5% confidence inter-
vals. The proportion of responders, odds ratios (ORs), and
97.5% CIs adjusted for covariates are reported for responder
end points. This study was designed as a pivotal study to
support regulatory product registration by testing the supe-
riority in effectiveness of the coil group over usual care
against the null hypothesis of equality or inferiority. There-
fore, all effectiveness analyses were 1-sided tests of superi-
ority at the α = .025 significance level comparing endobron-
chial coil treatment vs usual care. The Hochberg step-up
procedure was used to control the study-wise α for multiple
comparisons in secondary end points.25-28
Other effectiveness end points tested for statistical sig-
nificance included St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire
response analysis and mean absolute differences in RV and
RV/TLC and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Post hoc analyses compared effectiveness between the coil
group and usual care separately by prespecified subgroups
for type of emphysema and baseline RV measurement using
the same methods as the primary and secondary effective-
ness analyses.
Between-group comparisons at baseline were based on
analysis of variance with a factor for investigational site,
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, or Fisher exact
test. Between-treatment comparison of proportions of par-
ticipants experiencing at least 1 major complication were
analyzed using a 2-sided Fisher exact test. All analyses were
conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). For
detailed information about study methods, see the eAppen-
dix in Supplement 2 and the statistical analysis plan in
Supplement 3.
Results
Participants
Study enrollment began in December 2012, and the final
participant completed 12-month follow-up in November
2015. Six hundred eighty-five patients were screened at 34
sites; 315 patients were randomized to receive either endo-
bronchial coil treatment (n = 158) or usual care (control;
n = 157) at 21 North American and 5 European sites. Twelve-
month follow-up was completed by 90.2% of participants
(Figure 1). Three participants randomized to coil treatment
withdrew before the intervention. Baseline characteristics
were similar between groups (Table 1). This population was
notable for the severity of airflow obstruction and hyperin-
flation, the high prevalence of comorbidities, and the pre-
dominance of homogeneous emphysematous destruction
on chest computed tomography. Seventy-six percent of coil
vs 71% of usual care participants had “very severe” spiro-
metric disease based on the GOLD 4 guidelines. Extreme
hyperinflation was present, with a mean RV of 246% (SD,
39%) predicted in the coil group vs 245% (SD, 39%) pre-
dicted in usual care participants. The coil group had a
median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-4.0) nonpul-
monary major comorbidities vs 2.0 (IQR, 1.0-3.0) in the
usual care group (eTable 3 and eFigure 5 in Supplement 2);
43% vs 41% received long-term oxygen and 31% vs 27% had
been hospitalized in the year prior to enrollment in the coil
and usual care groups, respectively. Emphysema distribu-
tion on computed tomography was similar between groups
(77% with homogeneous and 23% with heterogeneous pat-
terns) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Procedures
Bilateral treatment was completed in 144 of 158 participants
assigned to coil treatment; 11 participants completed only uni-
lateral treatment due to death (n = 3) or clinical worsening
(n = 8). Among the treatments, 84.2% were in upper lobes and
15.8% were in lower lobes, with a median insertion of 10 and
12 to 13 coils, respectively (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Proce-
dure duration was 42 minutes (SD, 16 minutes) with a median
hospital stay of 1 night (range, 0-15 nights).
Primary and Secondary 6-Minute Walk Distance
Effectiveness End Points (ITT Population)
The median prespecified primary effectiveness end point of
change in 6-minute walk distance at 12 months was 10.3 m
(IQR, −33.0 to 45.0 m) in coil-treated patients vs −7.6 m (IQR,
−40.0 to 26.0 m) for usual care, with a median between-
group difference of 14.6 m (Hodges-Lehmann 97.5% CI, 0.4 m
to �; 1-sided P = .02) (Table 2, Figure 2, and eTable 5A in
Supplement 2). The secondary effectiveness end point of

−� to −2.1%; 1-sided P < .001) (Table 2 and Figure 2). Descrip-
tive results of primary, secondary, and exploratory outcome

Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed to as-
sess response stratified by degree of air trapping (RV ≥225%
vs <225% predicted) and by heterogeneous vs homogeneous
emphysema distribution. The RV ≥225% group and the hetero-
geneous emphysema group each had greater magnitudes of
treatment response in all primary and secondary effective-
ness end points compared with respective groups with RV of
less than 225% and homogeneous destruction, although the
study was not powered to test differences between sub-
groups.

For all measures, the response rates were higher in the endobronchial coil group
based on reported minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs).16,17,19,23
In contrast, the proportion of participants declining an MCID equivalent was
numerically greater for all measures in the usual care group. Note the small
number of very significant 6-minute walk distance decliners, particularly
in the coil group, that lowered the mean response. All improver and decliner
rates were calculated with logistic regression with data from the full
intention-to-treat analysis set, with multiple imputation. For each histogram,
the bin interval was set at half of the MCID for that measure. In each bin, the
data are equal to or greater than the lower limit and less than the upper limit of
the bin. The bin widths for each histogram are for residual volume, 175 mL;
forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), 5%; 6-minute walk
distance, 12.5 m; and St George’

(eTable 8 in Supplement 2) indicated that 200% predicted
may be a more sensitive response threshold.
The presence of comorbidities reduced the 12-month
6-minute walk distance outcome despite lung function
improvements. Compared with usual care, coil-treated par-
ticipants with 4 or more comorbidities (eTable 9 in Supplement
2) had a 1.1-m relative decline in 6-minute walk distance
despite significant reduction in RV, in contrast to partici-
pants with 3 or fewer comorbidities, who had a relative
21.0-m improvement in 6-minute walk distance. Partici-
pants who exhibited cardiac-related comorbidity also dem-
onstrated a decline in 6-minute walk distance despite
improvements in lung function (eTable 10 in Supplement 2).
The RV <225% subgroup had the greatest prevalence of car-
diac disease and averaged more comorbidities than the sub-
group with greater severity of air trapping (RV ≥225%)
(eTable 11 in Supplement 2).
Safety End Points
There was no difference in deaths in the coil group (n = 10;
6.5%) vs the usual care group (n = 8; 5.1%) at 1 year (eTable 12
in Supplement 2). Total major complications occurred more
frequently in the coil group (n = 54; 34.8%) vs the usual care
group (n = 30; 19.1%; P = .002) (Table 3). This difference was
largely due to increased lower respiratory tract infections
(18.7% vs 4.5%; P < .001). There were 2 cases of hemoptysis
requiring intervention in the coil group.
There were 2 direct procedure-associated deaths; one
patient died during the initial coil procedure because of pul-
monary hemorrhage and respiratory failure leading to car-

diac arrest, and another patient died of respiratory failure 6
days following the second coil procedure. Overall, serious
adverse events were similar between the 2 study groups
except with respect to pneumonia (coil group, n = 31 [20%]
vs usual care, n = 7 [4.5%]; P < .001) and pneumothorax
(coil group, n = 15 [9.7%] vs usual care, n = 1 [0.6%];
P < .001). Serious adverse events related to chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease exacerbations tended to be more
frequent with coil treatment (n = 43; 27.7%) vs usual care
(n = 32; 20.4%; P = .15) but returned to the level of the usual
care group in the 9- to 12-month window (eTables 13 and 14
in Supplement 2).
Post Hoc Safety Analysis
Reported pneumonia events adjudicated by the data moni-
toring committee were determined to be noninfectious coil-
associated opacity in 14 of 40 adjudicable cases (35%)
(eTable 15 in Supplement 2). Coil participants with adjudi-
cated coil-associated opacity exhibited superior 12-month
effectiveness outcomes compared with patients without
coil-associated opacities or pneumonia; the median
6-minute walk distance response rate was 47.8% (95% CI,
20.1%-75.6%) vs 38.9% (95% CI, 27.6%-50.2%) and the
median FEV1 change was 10.8% (IQR, 3.5%-22.7%) vs
2.2% (IQR, −7.8% to 14.5%), respectively (eTable 16A in
Supplement 2). This contrasts with usual care participants
with pneumonia (n=13), who had worsening of all measures,
specifically a 7.8% 6-minute walk distance response rate,
with a median 6-minute walk distance decline of −25 m
(IQR, −66 to −0.6 m) and a median FEV1 change of −2.9%
(IQR, −11.5% to −1.6%) (eTable 16B in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In a multicenter trial, bilateral endobronchial coil treatment
in patients with severe lung hyperinflation and homoge-
neous or heterogeneous emphysema resulted in durable but
modest increases in 6-minute walk distance of uncertain clini-
cal importance, along with improved expiratory flow rate av-
eraging less than a clinically important difference, reduced air
trapping, and overall clinically important improvements in
quality of life. These improvements were associated with a
higher rate of pneumothorax, pneumonia, hemoptysis, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations imme-
diately following the coil procedure and for several months af-
ter coil implantation.
This study addresses a group of patients with advanced
predominantly homogenous emphysema who have few
treatment options. More than 75% of participants had a
homogeneous emphysema distribution that would exclude
them from consideration for surgical lung reduction and
from investigational endobronchial valve treatment
options.3,6,8,29 The improvement in lung function associ-
ated with quality-of-life improvement greater than 2 times
the established MCID at 1-year follow-up was consistent

with reports from several smaller observational and ran-
domized studies.7,9-14 On the other hand, the difference in
6-minute walk distance of 14.6 m, while statistically signifi-
cant, was modest and less than the established MCID of
25 m. Furthermore, the lower confidence limit suggests the
responder difference between the 2 groups could be as low
as 1%. Our results compare with the 21-m 6-minute walk
distance improvement reported in the recent REVOLENS
randomized trial at the primary 6-month end point and con-
trast with greater responses observed in previous observa-
tional studies.24 In this trial, the 6-minute walk distance
response was skewed such that a significantly greater pro-
portion of clinically important responses in the coil group
relative to usual care was balanced by a small proportion of
severe declines in both the coil and usual care groups that
lowered the mean and median response differences
(Figure 2). The variable improvement in walk distance was
in part related to this study’
s less restrictive inclusion crite-
ria; participants with less air trapping (RV <220% predicted)
were excluded from REVOLENS. The baseline walk dis-
tance, degree of hyperinflation, prevalence of prior hospi-
talization, and long-term oxygen use in this trial reflect
greater impairment than in those enrolled in prior surgical
and endobronchial volume reduction trials.3,6,8 One third of
this study’
s participants would qualify for lung transplanta-
tion based on their BODE (body mass index, airflow
obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise) scores of 7 or higher.30
Furthermore, the inclusion of participants with multiple
comorbidities in this study’
s cohort (eTable 3 and eFigure 5
in Supplement 2) and in REVOLENS likely attenuated the
6-minute walk distance response in both studies despite
improvements in lung function.
Although adverse events including pneumothorax and he-
moptysis were more common in the coil group, the events gen-
erally occurred in the periprocedural and postprocedural pe-
riods and events returned toward baseline in the months
following the second procedure, as has been described in pre-
vious series.31 The 15% excess incidence of pneumonia in the
coil group vs usual care was nearly identical to that reported
in the REVOLENS trial.14 This study has expanded the under-
standing of these pneumonia-classified events by identifying
noninfectious coil-associated opacities that represent more
than one-third of events. These coil-associated opacities ap-
pear to represent coil-induced inflammatory or lung struc-
tural changes induced by stress forces from the coils on lung
parenchyma.
Treated participants reporting a pneumonia or coil-
associatedopacityeventhadbetteroutcomesat12monthsthan
participants not experiencing these events, in contrast to usual
care participants with pneumonia, who did very poorly, sug-
gesting a causal and mechanistic difference between the study
groups (eTable 16 in Supplement 2). The planned follow-up of
the RENEW cohort for 5 years will better elucidate the long-
term response and safety profile of treatment.
We have identified prespecified and mechanistically plau-
sible subgroups defined by degree of air trapping and disease
distribution that associate with greater treatment response
(Figure 3 and eTable 7 in Supplement 2). The variation in re-
sponse within these subgroups, given the exploratory nature
of this analysis, must be interpreted with caution but offers
preliminaryevidencetosupportfuturevalidationofthesemea-
sures to enhance patient selection.
There are limitations in the interpretation of this
study’
s results. The difficulty in implementing a sham con-
trol group prevented effective blinding of participants
and may have influenced subjective outcomes such as the
St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire. On the other hand,
the St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire, which was the most
responsiveofthisstudy’
seffectivenessmeasures,trackedwith
more objective physiologic measures in the subgroup analy-
sis (Figure 3). Another limitation was the use of 6-minute walk
distance as the primary outcome measure. While 6-minute
walk distance can integrate the functional effects of complex
physiologic changes in lung mechanics such as reductions in
hyperinflation and air trapping, which may not always be re-
flected in more conventional expiratory flow measures, the
variance in the measure and ceiling effect can limit the re-
sponsiveness of the tool. Inclusion of a practice walk at all
evaluation time points or greater vigilance to maintaining re-
habilitationfollowingrandomizationmighthaveincreasedthe
responsiveness of 6-minute walk distance and lessened the
baseline decline across study groups.32 Despite these limita-
tions, however, the broadness of this study’
s inclusion crite-
ria, the large number of enrolled patients, the longer duration
of follow-up, and the inclusion of multiple centers and coil im-
planters provide insights regarding the potential clinical util-
ity of this therapy.
Conclusions
Among patients with emphysema and severe hyperinflation
treated for 12 months, the use of an endobronchial coil com-
pared with usual care resulted in an improvement in median
exercise tolerance that was modest and of uncertain clinical
importance, with a higher likelihood of major complications.
Further follow-up is needed to assess long-term effects on
health outcomes.

Funding/Support: This study was supported by
PneumRx Inc, a BTG International group company.
Drs Sciurba, Criner, and Slebos receive institutional
support from Pulmonx.
Role of the Sponsor/Funder: The investigators,
sponsor (PneumRx Inc), and representatives of the
US Food and Drug Administration designed the
trial. The sponsor funded the study, assisted in the
design and conduct of the study, collected the data,
managed site selection and trial operations,
analyzed the data per the prespecified statistical
analysis plan, supported additional analyses
requested by the authors and reviewed and
approved the final manuscript from a regulatory
perspective and approved of the decision to submit
the manuscript for publication. Independent from
the sponsor, the authors interpreted the data,
prepared the manuscript, and made the decision to
submit the manuscript for publication. The lead
investigators and writing committee had
unrestricted access to the data, had control of
manuscript preparation, and assume responsibility
for the accuracy and completeness of all reported
data. All authors received institutional funding from
PneumRx Inc in support of the conduct of this trial.
Drs Sciurba and Criner participated in medical and
scientific advisory board meetings for BTG
International and have received travel fees but no
consulting fees for this service totaling less than
$5000. Drs Strange, Michaud, Mehta, and Slebos
received travel and consulting fees totaling less
than $5000. Drs Shah, Mehta, and Marquette
received travel reimbursement and speaker fees
from BTG International.
Additional Contributions: Statistical support for
this study was provided by Brett Bannan, MS, and
Claire Daugherty, MS, who are BTG International
employees and thus compensated for their
contributions to the analyses.
