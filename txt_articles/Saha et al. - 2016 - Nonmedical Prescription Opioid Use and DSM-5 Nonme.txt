Abstract
Objective—The authors present 12-month and lifetime prevalence, correlates, psychiatric 
comorbidity and treatment of NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD.
Method—Data was derived from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and 
Related Conditions – III (NESARC-III) (n = 36,309).
Results—Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime NMPOU were 4.1% and 11.3%, exceeding rates 
in the 2001–2002 NESARC (1.8%, 4.7%). Twelve-month and lifetime rates of DSM-5 NMPOUD 
were 0.9% and 2.1%. NESARC-III DSM-IV NMPOUD rates (0.8%, 2.9%) were greater than 
those observed in the 2001–2002 NESARC (0.4% and 1.4%). Rates of NMPOU were greater 
among men, but no sex differential was observed for NMPOUD. Prevalences of NMPOU and 
NMPOUD were generally greater among 18-to-64 year-olds, Whites and Native Americans, and 
individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Associations were observed between 12-month and 
lifetime NMPOU and NMPOUD and other drug use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and 
borderline, schizotypal and antisocial personality disorders, persistent depression and major 
depressive disorder (for NMPOU) and bipolar I disorder (for NMPOUD). Only 5.5% and 17.7% 
of individuals with 12-month NMPOU and NMPOUD were ever treated.

 Conclusions—NMPOU and NMPOUD have considerably increased over the past decade, are 
associated with a broad array of risk factors and comorbidities, and largely go untreated in the 
U.S. More information on the determinants, characteristics and outcomes of NMPOU and 
NMPOUD is needed to support evidence-based interventions and prevention.
Keywords
Opioids; epidemiology; treatment; clinical correlates; comorbidity
Although opioid analgesics are important components of treatment for chronic pain that is 
highly prevalent among American adults1, prescriptions for opioid analgesics and harms 
from nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) have increased dramatically during the 
last decade. Between 2002 and 2012, the number of opioid analgesics dispensed by U.S. 
pharmacies has skyrocketed from 142 million to 248 million.2,3 Drug poisoning death rates 
more than tripled between 1999 and 2012,4 the quarterly intensional abuse rates associated 
with opioids reported by U.S. poison centers increased from 0.20/100,000 population to 
0.56/100,000 population in 20122, and emergency department visits increased by 153% from 
2004 to 2011.5 Drug treatment admission rates for nonheroin opiates increased 236% from 
2002 to 2012.6 Additional adverse health consequences of NMPOU include transitions to 
injection drug or heroin use with resultant infection (e.g., hepatitis C, human 
immunodeficiency virus),6–9 risk, falls and fractures among older adults,10,11 neonatal 
opioid withdrawal syndrome,12 cognitive impairment and drug interactions.13 Societal costs 
of NMPOU are estimated at $53 to $72 billion annually.14–16
Considerable concern stems from the dependence potential of NMPOU and the severity and 
disability of nonmedical prescription opioid use disorder (NMPOUD) attributable to its 
comorbidity with other substance use and psychiatric disorders.17,18 Although research has 
begun to identify correlates of NMPOU,19–21 very few surveys22,23 collect clinically-
relevant diagnostic information on nonmedical prescription opioid use disorder (NMPOUD) 
and its comorbidities. In the 2001–2002 National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism (NIAAA) National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
(NESARC),24 DSM-IV25 12-month and lifetime rates of NMPOUD (abuse and/or 
dependence) were 0.34% and 1.4%22 with substantial comorbidity between NMPOUD and 
major mood, anxiety, personality and other substance use disorders (SUDs).22,26–30 In the 
2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the 12-month prevalence of 
NMPOUD was 0.6%.23 NSDUH assesses only 12-month NMPOUD and does not address 
lifetime diagnoses or the full range of psychiatric disorders.
Previous national estimates of NMPOUD were all based on DSM-IV criteria. However, 
DSM-531 made major changes to the NMPOUD diagnosis, including combining most abuse 
and dependence criteria into a single diagnosis, adding a craving criterion, and setting a 
diagnostic threshold of ≥2 criteria.32 Because of the seriousness of NMPOU and NMPOUD, 
the lack of current epidemiologic data on NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD in the United 
States from a single reliable and uniform source represents a critical knowledge gap for 
prevention and intervention. We therefore present national data on the prevalence, correlates,

 comorbidity and treatment of NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD from the 2012–2013 NIAAA 
NESARC-III.33 DSM-IV NMPOUD criteria were also assessed to examine trends.
METHOD
Sample
NESARC-III’s target population was the U.S. noninstitutionalized adult civilian population, 
including residents of selected group quarters. As detailed elsewhere,33 probability sampling 
was used to select respondents. Primary sampling units were counties or groups of 
contiguous counties, secondary sampling units (SSU) comprised groups of Census-defined 
blocks, and tertiary sampling units were households within SSUs. Eligible adults within 
sampled households were randomly selected. Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians were 
oversampled; in households with ≥4 eligible minority persons, two respondents were 
selected (n = 1661). Total sample size was 36,309. The screener- and person-level response 
rates were 72.0% and 84.0%, yielding a total response rate of 60.1%, comparable to most 
current U.S. national surveys.23,34
Data were adjusted for oversampling and nonresponse, then weighted to represent the US 
civilian population based on the 2012 American Community Survey.35 Weighting 
adjustments compensated adequately for nonresponse. Respondents did not differ from the 
total eligible sample, including nonrespondents, in percent Hispanic, Black, or Asian, 
population density, vacancy rate, proportion of population in group quarters or proportion of 
renters at the segment level. There were no differences between respondents and the total 
eligible sample on Hispanic ethnicity. Respondents included a slightly higher percentages of 
men (48.1% versus 46.2%) and individuals aged 60–69 years (13.7% versus 12.6%), and 
smaller percentages aged 40–49 (18.1% versus 18.3%) and 30–39 (16.7% versus 17.4%), 
than the eligible sample.
Respondents gave informed consent and received $90.00 for survey participation. Protocols 
were approved by National Institutes of Health and Westat Institutional Review Boards.
Assessments
The diagnostic interview was the NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities 
Interview Schedule-5 (AUDADIS-5),36 designed to measure DSM-5 alcohol (AUD), 
nicotine (NUD), other specific drug use disorders (DUDs), and selected mood, anxiety, 
trauma-related, eating and personality disorders (PDs).
NMPOU and NMPOUD
Twelve-month and prior-to-past 12-months NMPOU information was aggregated into a 
lifetime measure. NMPOU was defined as use “without a prescription” or “in greater 
amounts, more often, or longer than prescribed, or for a reason other than a doctor said you 
should use them”. The definition differs in the NSDUH, “use without a prescription or only 
for the experience or feeling it caused”.23
Lifetime DSM-5 NMPOUD diagnoses required ≥2 of 11 criteria in the 12 months before 
interview or previously. Prior-to-the-past-12-month diagnoses required clustering of ≥2

 criteria within a single year. DSM-IV lifetime NMPOUD diagnoses required ≥1 of 4 abuse 
criteria or ≥3 of 7 dependence criteria clustered within a single year.
Symptom items (n=32) assessing DSM-IV 12-month NMPOUD in the 2001–2002 
NESARC and NESARC-III were virtually identical. However, three items were slightly 
reworded and an additional abuse item appeared in the NESARC and NESARC-III. 
Comparisons between DSM-IV diagnoses with and without the additional questions yielded 
identical prevalences (NESARC, 0.35% vs 0.35%; NESARC-III, 0.78% vs. 0.78%) with 
near perfect concordance (kappa=1.00 and 0.99), suggesting that trival differences between 
DSM-IV NMPOUD operationalizations did not yield the large differences reported below.
Test-retest reliability of NMPOU and frequency of NMPOU were substantial (kappa=0.66, 
0.66) in a large general population sample.37 Reliability of AUDADIS-5/DSM-5 NMPOUD 
categorical diagnoses (kappa=0.40, 0.47) and dimensional criteria scales (intraclass 
correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.71, 0.73) were moderate to substantial in a large general 
population sample.38 Procedural validity of AUDADIS-5/DSM-5 NMPOUD was assessed 
through blind clinical reappraisal using the clinician-administered, semi-structured 
Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders, DSM-5 version 
(PRISM-5).39 Moderate concordances between AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 NMPOUD 
diagnoses (kappa=0.40,0.49), and substantial concordances for their dimensional 
counterparts (ICC=0.68,0.79), were observed in a large general population sample.40
Test-retest reliability of DSM-IV NMPOUD diagnoses was moderate in clinical and general 
population samples.37,41,42 Convergent, discriminant and construct validity of AUDADIS-IV 
NMPOUD were moderate to substantial,43–46 including in the World Health Organization/
National Institutes of Health Study on Reliability and Validity (kappa=0.62).47
Other Psychopathology
DSM-5 AUD, NUD and other DUD diagnoses (sedative/tranquilizer, cannabis, stimulant, 
cocaine, club drug, opioid, heroin, hallucinogen, and solvent/inhalant) were derived 
similarly to NMPOUD. Sedative/tranquilizer and stimulant use disorders were aggregated to 
yield other nonmedical prescription DUD diagnoses, with the remaining DUDs aggregated 
to yield diagnoses of any other DUD. Test-retest reliabilities were moderate to substantial 
for AUD (0.60, 0.62), NUD (kappa=0.50, 0.87) and all other DUDs (kappa=0.41–0.54), and 
higher for their dimensional counterparts (ICCs=0.45–0.85).38 AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 
concordance on AUD, NUD and other DUD diagnoses and dimensional scales was moderate 
to substantial (kappa=0.35–0.72; ICCs=0.38–0.92).40
Mood disorders assessed in the NESARC-III included 12-month and lifetime persistent 
depression, major depressive, bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Anxiety disorders included 
panic, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, and social and specific phobias. Posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) was also assessed. All diagnoses excluded substance- and medical 
illness-induced cases. Lifetime PDs included antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal. 
Psychometric properties of these psychiatric disorders are described in detail elsewhere.48

 Statistical Analysis
Weighted means, frequencies and cross-tabulations were computed for 12-month and 
lifetime NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) derived from multiple 
logistic regression indicated associations between NMPOU and NMPOUD and each 
sociodemographic characteristic controlling for all others. Logistic regressions of psychiatric 
comorbidity of NMPOU and NMPOUD controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and 
other substance use and psychiatric disorders. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-
eating disorder were too rare to assess comorbid associations with NMPOU and NMPOUD 
but were used as covariates in comorbidity analyses. Opioid-specific treatment seeking 
among individuals with NMPOU and NMPOUD was assessed across treatment modality. 
All analyses utilized SUDAAN49software that accounts for the NESARC-III’s complex 
design.
RESULTS
NMPOU
Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime NMPOU were 4.1% and 11.3% (Table 1); 
considerably higher than in the 2001–2002 NESARC22 (1.8% and 4.7%). Twelve-month 
rates were greater among males, the three youngest age groups and among those with annual 
incomes < $70,000.00, ≤ high school education and those previously married. Prevalences 
were lower among Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics and among those residing in the 
Northeast and South. Lifetime prevalence showed similar distributions.
NMPOUD
Twelve-month and lifetime rates of DSM-5 NMPOUD were 0.9% and 2.1% (Table 2), with 
similar rates for DSM-IV (0.8% and 2.9%). Asians/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics had 
lower rates of 12-month and lifetime NMPOUD and Blacks had lower rates of lifetime 
NMPOUD than Whites. Although rates were greatest among Native Americans (1.4% and 
3.7%), low precision precluded reliable statistical comparisons. For both time frames, 
NMPOUD prevalences were greater among respondents < 65 years old and among those 
with ≤ high school education, lower incomes and the previously married (for lifetime 
NMPOUD).
Comorbidity
NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD were strongly related to other nonmedical prescription 
DUDs, other DUDs, AUD and NUD, PTSD, and schizotypal, borderline and antisocial PDs, 
regardless of time frame (Table 3). Twelve-month and lifetime NMPOU were associated 
with persistent depression and major depressive disorder (12-month only), whereas 
NMPOUD was associated with bipolar I disorder for each time period.
Treatment/Help Seeking
Overall, only 5.5% and 7.9% of individuals with 12-month and lifetime NMPOU were 
treated; corresponding rates for NMPOUD were 17.7% and 28.9% (Table 4). Among those 
with 12-month NMPOU, 3.2% received treatment from physicians/health care practitioners,

 2.1% from 12-step programs, and 0.9% to 1.3% from outpatient clinics, emergency 
departments, detoxification programs and rehabilitation programs; other modalities were 
utilized less frequently. Treatment among individuals with lifetime NMPOU followed a 
similar distribution except that 12-step participation (4.7%) was utilized more frequently 
than health care practitioners (3.5%).
Among individuals with 12-month NMPOUD, 10.3% received treatment from physicians/
healthcare practitioners, 8.5% from self-help programs, and 3.4% to 4.9% from outpatient 
clinics, rehabilitation programs, emergency departments, and detoxification programs; with 
utilization of other modalities less frequent. Similar patterns were observed for lifetime 
NMPOUD except that a greater percentage of respondents sought treatment from 12-step 
programs (18.3%) than from physicians/health care practitioners (13.9%).
Discussion
In 2012–2013, prevalences of 12-month and lifetime NMPOU were 4.1% and 11.3%, 
representing about 9.7 and 26.6 million adult Americans. Consistent with substantial 
increases in opioid prescriptions2,3 and NMPOU-associated morbidity and mortality during 
the past decade,1–6 these rates were considerably greater than those reported in the 2001–
2002 NESARC (1.8%, 4.7%).22 NSDUH rates of 12-month and lifetime NMPOU in 2013 
were similar (4.2%, 14.2%).23
Twelve-month and lifetime rates of DSM-5 NMPOUD were 0.9% and 2.1%, representing 
about 2.1 and 4.8 million Americans. In NESARC-III, corresponding prevalences of DSM-
IV NMPOUD were similar, 0.8% and 2.9%, but greater than corresponding rates reported in 
the 2001–2002 NESARC (0.4%, 1.4%).22 The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV NMPOUD 
in the 2013 NSDUH was 0.6%.23
Dramatic increases in NMPOU (161%) and NMPOUD (125%) observed in this study over 
the last decade may reflect, in part, increases in opioid prescribing and dosage; increased 
advocacy for opioid treatment of chronic noncancer pain; availability of long-acting 
formulations; lessened perceived risk or greater social acceptability of substances that can be 
obtained by legitimate prescription; drug diversion; aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical 
companies; disregard for the lack of long-term effectiveness; and lack of understanding of 
opioids’ addiction potential.50–54
Consistent with most prior studies,10–22,26,55–57men had greater rates of NMPOU. Although 
reasons for this sex differential are unclear, women more frequently report pain as 
motivation for first opioid use while euphoria is the major motivation for men.55 Women 
also more often use opioids via legitimate prescriptions and intended route of administration 
whereas men more often report obtaining opioids from illicit markets and using unintended 
routes of administration.58,59
The absence of sex differences in NMPOUD is inconsistent with higher prevalences among 
men in earlier studies19,21,22 including the NSDUH,23 and across many other SUDs.60–64 
This may reflect that women are increasingly more likely to be prescribed opioids,10 related 
in part to the greater comorbidity of pain and affective disorders more prevalent among 
Saha et al.

 women.65,66 Nonetheless, the narrowing gender gap in NMPOUD is important for 
screening, prevention and treatment. Of note, most risk stratification and screening tools 
identify male sex as a NMPOUD risk factor.54
Much debate surrounding the opioid epidemic has focused on the dependence liability of 
opioids. Recent studies on dependence risk among pain patients have yielded estimates of 
0.00%–45.0%.67–72 These studies generally failed to define dependence and most excluded 
patients with histories of SUDs or psychiatric disorders. In this study, 21.7% of individuals 
with NMPOU were classified with NMPOUD. Considering the key role of dependence 
liability in the opioid debate, uniform definitions and validated assessments based on current 
scientific and clinical understanding are essential to establish liability parameters. Within 
this context, the DSM-5 definition of opioid use disorder explicitly excludes tolerance and 
withdrawal as criteria if the individual is “taking opioids solely under appropriate medical 
supervision”.31 This exclusion does not apply to individuals with NMPOU.
NMPOU and NMPOUD prevalences decreased with age. Whether the declining rates 
observed here and previously22,23,73–75 reflect cohort, age or period effects,76 differential 
mortality, or recall bias merits further investigation. Although rates of NMPOU and 
NMPOUD were substantially lower among individuals ≥ 65 years old, rates among these 
individuals may rise with increasing life expectancy and as the proportion of the U.S. 
population aged 65-to-74 achieves its projected growth rate of 74% by 2020.77 Even if rates 
among the elderly remain steady, the projected increase in population size portends 
substantial increases in the number at risk in this cohort, in which illicit drug use was also 
common.74,78
Consistent with most research, 19,20–23,79–81 rates of NMPOU and NMPOUD were 
generally greater among Whites and individuals with lower incomes, lower education and 
widowed/separated/divorced marital status. Prevalences of NMPOUD were lower among 
Blacks and Native Americans had the greatest rates of NMPOU and NMPOUD, but low 
precision precluded reliable significance testing. In contrast to the results of a recent state-
level study in which opioid prescription rates were greatest in the South and Northeast 
followed by the West,82 this study showed that rates of NMPOU were significantly lower in 
the South and Northeast relative to West. Further, no regional differences were found for 
NMPOUD. These regional discrepancies suggest that opioid prescription rates may be 
imperfectly related to the rates of NMPOU and NMPOUD. Understanding mechanism of 
underlying sociodemographic risk and protective factors will be important to elucidate 
causes of NMPOU and NMPOUD. These findings highlight the need for more targeted 
prevention efforts and research on optimal treatment for subgroups of the population at risk 
of NMPOU and NMPOUD, as well as potential barriers to their treatment.
Consistent with earlier findings,17,22,26–30,83–86 this study revealed strong associations 
between NMPOU and NMPOUD and other nonmedical prescription DUDs (sedative/
tranquilizer, stimulant) and smaller, but significant, associations with other psychopathology. 
These findings underscore the need to diagnose and treat comorbidities among individuals 
with NMPOU and NMPOUD. This is especially critical because individuals presenting with 
SUDs and psychiatric disorders are more likely to receive prescription opioids and long-term

 opioid therapy, be prescribed concurrent sedative-hypnotics, and have more physical 
pain72,87–96 than those without these disorders. Accurate diagnosis and care of NMPOU and 
NMPOUD complicated by psychiatric comorbidity and pain will be a substantial challenge 
in the future.
Similar to the results of prior research,22 past year and lifetime treatment rates of NMPOU 
and NMPOUD were low (5.5% and 17.7%). The reasons for these particularly low treatment 
rates are not known, but may reflect the belief that prescription drugs are less dangerous than 
illegal drugs. Individuals may also be reluctant to discuss potential prescription drug 
problems with their physicians that may endanger future prescription.97 Alternatively, 
individuals prescribed opioids may be ambivalent about giving up the rewarding effects of 
the substance despite negative consequences associated with their use.98 Stigmatization, 
shown to be a critical barrier to substance abuse treatment,99 may also contribute to the low 
treatment rates found in this study. Taken together, these results highlight the need for 
physicians to periodically and systematically screen for NMPOU and NMPOUD and to 
educate patients and their families about the risks associated with them.
The present results contrast with NSDUH findings of stable rates of 12-month NMPOU 
(4.2%–4.9%) and NMPOUD (0.6%–0.8%) between 2002 and 2013.100 Differing definitions 
of NMPOU could explain these discrepancies, since only respondents answering NMPOU 
questions affirmatively are asked NMPOUD items. The AUDADIS versions used in the 
NESARC-III and 2001–2002 NESARC include many more items than the NSDUH 
instruments and their test-retest reliability and validity are extensively 
documented.37,38,40–48 Better sensitivity through more extensive probing of NMPOUD 
criteria has been identified as another reason for discrepancies in rates between these 
surveys.101
Strengths of NESARC-III included its large sample, reliable and valid measures of NMPOU, 
NMPOUD, and other psychopathology, and rigorous methodology. The NESARC-III is also 
unique in providing current, comprehensive information on the epidemiology of NMPOU 
and DSM-5 NMPOUD, in the U.S. from a single uniform source. Limitations include that 
not all psychiatric disorders were assessed, similar to other large U.S. surveys. Because 
some population segments (homeless individuals, prisoners) were not covered, the 
prevalence of NMPOU and NMPOUD may have been underestimated. The NESARC-III 
was also cross-sectional. Longitudinal surveys are needed to further investigate the stability 
of relationships found herein.
NMPOU and NMPOUD have increased considerably over past decade, are associated with a 
broad array of risk factors and comorbidities, and largely go untreated in the U.S. Valid 
assessment tools and algorithms are needed to stratify patients by risk based on current 
methodologically-rigorous epidemiologic studies. This study demonstrated strong 
associations of NMPOU and NMPOUD with pain, other SUDs, and psychiatric disorders 
that may indicate the severe impact of pain on mental health or difficulties in translating 
comorbidity care into clinical practice. The critical treatment gap observed in this study 
highlights the need for research on evidence-based treatments for NMPOUD that may better 
match affected individuals’ clinical characteristics.102–104 As more information emerges on

prevention and intervention must balance the complexity of these conditions with access to

 Clinical Points
•
Lack of current epidemiological data on nonmedical prescription opioid use 
(NMPOU) and DSM-5 opioid use disorder (NMPOUD) from a single reliable 
source represents a knowledge gap for prevention and treatment.
•
Given the dramatic increases in NMPOU and NMPOUD over the last decade, 
it is important for clinicians to systematically screen for these conditions and 
educate patients about their risks.
