IMPORTANCE Documentation rates of patients’medical wishes are often low. It is unknown
whether easy-to-use, patient-facing advance care planning (ACP) interventions can overcome
barriers to planning in busy primary care settings.
OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of an interactive, patient-centered ACP website
(PREPARE) with an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) to increase planning documentation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a comparative effectiveness randomized
clinical trial from April 2013 to July 2016 conducted at multiple primary care clinics at the San
Francisco VA Medical Center. Inclusion criteria were age of a least 60 years; at least 2 chronic
and/or serious conditions; and 2 or more primary care visits; and 2 or more additional clinic,
hospital, or emergency room visits in the last year.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to review PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD
or the AD alone. There were no clinician and/or system-level interventions or education.
Research staff were blinded for all follow-up measurements.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was new ACP documentation (ie,
legal forms and/or discussions) at 9 months. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported
ACP engagement at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months using validated surveys of behavior
change process measures (ie, 5-point knowledge, self-efficacy, readiness scales) and action
measures (eg, surrogate designation, using a 0-25 scale). We used intention-to-treat,
mixed-effects logistic and linear regression, controlling for time, health literacy, race/ethnicity,
baseline ACP, and clustering by physician.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of 414 participants was 71 (8) years, 38 (9%) were women, 83
(20%) had limited literacy, and 179 (43%) were nonwhite. No participant characteristic
differed significantly among study arms at baseline. Retention at 6 months was 90%.
Advance care planning documentation 6 months after enrollment was higher in the PREPARE
arm vs the AD-alone arm (adjusted 35% vs 25%; odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.03-2.51]; P = .04).
PREPARE also resulted in higher self-reported ACP engagement at each follow-up, including
higher process and action scores (P <.001 at each follow-up).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Easy-to-use, patient-facing ACP tools, without clinician-
and/or system-level interventions, can increase planning documentation 25% to 35%.
Combining the PREPARE website with an easy-to-read AD resulted in higher planning
documentation than the AD alone, suggesting that PREPARE may increase planning
documentation with minimal health care system resources.

 A
dvancecareplanning(ACP)isaprocesswherebypeople
communicate their goals and preferences for future
medical care.1 The Institute of Medicine recommends
ACP as a means to provide patient-centered, value-aligned
medical care.2 In addition, Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) reimburse clinicians for ACP documentation because
ACP conversations result in improved satisfaction with care,
quality of life, and receipt of medical care aligned with pa-
tients’wishes.3-7
The ACP field has evolved to consider ACP as a process that
involves a series of discussions over time in addition to
advance directive (AD) completion.8 However, most older
adults, even those with serious illness, have not engaged in
ACP, and patients’wishes are often not documented.9,10 Cli-
nician barriers to ACP include a lack of training and system re-
sources, especially in busy outpatient clinics.11-14 Patient bar-
riers include difficulty understanding AD forms and feeling
unprepared to make end-of-life medical decisions.9,11
To help overcome some of these barriers, we first created
an easy-to-read AD that significantly increased 6-month
documentation.15 However, formative work among diverse
populations demonstrated the need for more preparation
for complex, ongoing medical decision making and commu-
nication of one’
s wishes.11,16,17 Therefore, we created the
PREPAREwebsite(https://prepareforyourcare.org/),whichhas
been shown to empower older adults to engage in ACP through
the use of a simple 5-step process and “how-to” videos.18 Both
of these patient-facing ACP tools were designed to help
older adults begin to engage in ACP outside the medical
environment.
The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to com-
pare the efficacy of PREPARE plus the easy-to-read AD
(PREPARE plus AD) vs the AD alone (AD-only) on ACP docu-
mentation and engagement. We hypothesized that ACP docu-
mentation and engagement would increase in both arms but
would be greater in the PREPARE plus AD arm.
Methods
This is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized compara-
tive effectiveness trial. The conceptual framework and the full
trial protocol,18,19 including inclusion and exclusion criteria;
the study flow diagram; recruitment procedures; sample
size estimates; and validity, reliability, and response options
of all outcome measures have been previously published.
Using a modified informed consent process for vulnerable
populations,20 written informed consent was obtained for all
participants. Participants were compensated $50 for the base-
line interview and $25 for all follow-up interviews. This study
was approved by the University of California, San Francisco,
and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center
institutional review boards. VA research audits were per-
formed yearly.
Participants and Enrollment Criteria
Veterans were enrolled from a women’
s, geriatrics, and sev-
eral general medicine clinics at the San Francisco VA from April
2013 through July 2016. A full table of inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria has been published.19 In brief, veterans were in-
cluded if they were 60 years or older, had at least 2 chronic
medical conditions defined by International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes,21,22 had 2 or more vis-
its with a primary care clinician in the past year (ie, a marker
ofestablishedcare)andhadatleast2additionalVAclinic,emer-
gency department, or hospital visits with any clinician in the
past year (ie, a marker of frequent access). To be enrolled, vet-
erans had to have an upcoming primary care appointment
within 1 to 3 weeks.19 Exclusion criteria were determined by
their clinician and study staff based on ICD-9 codes, medical
record review, and in-person screening and included demen-
tia,moderate-to-severecognitiveimpairment,blindness,deaf-
ness, delirium, psychosis, active drug or alcohol abuse within
the past 3 months, plans to be out of town during the study,
no telephone, or inability to answer informed consent teach-
back questions within 3 attempts.19 Because people may
change their medical preferences over time,23 we did not ex-
clude individuals who had previously engaged in ACP.
Recruitment and Data Collection
A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
waiver was obtained to identify Veterans who met our inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria and had upcoming appointments.
As previously described,19 after clinicians gave permission for
studystafftocontacttheirpatients,wesentrecruitmentletters
and made phone calls to describe the study and assess eligibil-
ityandinterest.Nameswererandomlylistedtoensurerandom
recruitment, with oversampling of women and nonwhite vet-
erans.Staffscreenedparticipantspriortoenrollment.Datawere
collected using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap); a
secure, web-based application.24
Interventions
Given the potential benefits of ACP, we decided with our VA
stakeholderstoperformacomparativeeffectivenessstudyand
provide all veterans some form of ACP. Both PREPARE and the
easy-to-read AD were designed with and vetted by older adults
from several community and clinical settings and from di-
verserace/ethnicityandculturalbackgrounds.15,18,19Bothtools
Key Points
Question Can a patient-facing, interactive advance care planning
website called PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive
increase advance care planning documentation compared with an
advance directive alone?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 414 older
veterans with chronic illness from multiple primary care clinics,
PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive resulted in
statistically significant higher advance care planning
documentation (35%) compared with an advance directive alone
(25%).
Meaning Patient-facing advance care planning tools, including the
PREPARE website and the easy-to-read advance directive,
increased advance care planning documentation and engagement
without additional clinician- or system-level interventions.

 are patient-facing, meaning their use does not require clini-
cian or systems-level involvement to begin the ACP process.
No clinician-, electronic health record–, or systems-level
changes were implemented as part of this trial.
AD-Only Intervention
In the AD-only arm, veterans were asked to review the easy-
to-read AD for 5 to 20 minutes within research offices.15
Participants were called 1 to 3 days prior to their upcoming
primary care visit to remind them about their visit.
PREPARE Plus AD Intervention
The PREPARE plus AD arm included the literacy and cultur-
allyappropriate,HIPAA-compliantPREPAREwebsite18plusthe
easy-to-read AD.15 Briefly, we reconceptualized ACP as a pro-
cess that evolves over time and includes many behaviors.8
Using video stories, modeling of behaviors, and a 5-step pro-
cess, PREPARE was designed to motivate and prepare indi-
viduals to discuss their values and care preferences with their
family, friends and clinicians. Through tailored algorithms,
PREPARE asks individuals about their values and helps them
make a commitment (ie, action plan) to do 1 ACP step.
PREPARE then creates a unique, printed “Summary of My
Wishes” and has the capacity to save individual’
s prefer-
ences. Reviewing PREPARE takes an mean (SD) of 57 (16) min-
utes or approximately 10 minutes per step.18
PREPARE was administered within research offices, and
participants were asked to review PREPARE in its entirety. Par-
ticipants were instructed to complete PREPARE on their own.
Research staff intervened only if there were technological
issues and the study could not move forward. After viewing
PREPARE, participants were given a copy of their action plan;
the AD; their website login; and a PREPARE pamphlet, book-
let, and DVD to take home. Participants were called 1 to 3 days
prior to their upcoming primary care visit and reminded to
bring the “Summary of My Wishes” and action plan to their
medical visit.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was any new ACP documentation in the
electronic medical record (EMR) 9 months after study
enrollment.19 Because legal forms (eg, ADs, living wills, a du-
rable power of attorney for healthcare, and physicians’or-
ders for life-sustaining treatment [POLST] forms) and docu-
mented discussions can be used to direct medical care, we
createdacompositevariableofanyACPdocumentation(forms
and/or discussions). All medical review data were double-
codedby2independentresearchassistants.Discrepancieswere
adjudicated by the principal investigator (R.L.S.).
Secondary outcomes, measured at 1 week, 3 months, and
6 months, included the validated, patient-reported ACP En-
gagement Survey. This questionnaire includes both process
measures of knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and
readiness assessed on an average 5-point Likert scale and ac-
tionmeasuressuchasdiscussinganddocumentingACPwishes
using “yes” or “no” response options on a 0- to 25-point
scale.18,19,25 All questions are published.26 Clinically mean-
ingful effect sizes were defined based on commonly used cri-
teria (ie, 0.50-0.79 was considered a moderate effect).27 We
also measured ease of use, “How easy was it to use this guide?”
on a 1 (very hard) to 10 (very easy) point scale, and satisfac-
tion,“Howcomfortablewereyoureviewingthisguide?”,“How
helpful was this guide?”, and “How likely are you to recom-
mend this guide to others?” using “not-at-all” to “extremely”
5-point Likert scale after viewing the interventions.
Other Measures
We assessed participant characteristics using self-report at
baselineincludingage,gendertheymostidentifiedwith(male,
female,other),race/ethnicity,andvalidatedmeasuresofhealth
status,healthliteracy,socialsupport,andsocialstanding.19We
also assessed the presence of a possible surrogate decision
maker (yes or no), whether they had funeral plans or a will, and
whethertheyhadinternetaccessinthehome(yesorno).19Two
research assistants conducted independent medical record re-
view to determine prior ACP documentation up to 5 years be-
fore the baseline interview. We also administered the Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4 at baseline and at each fol-
low-up interview. The PHQ-4 includes the PHQ-2 for depres-
sion and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-2 anxiety
screening tool.28 A score of 3 or greater on a 0 to 6 scale sug-
gests possible depression or anxiety.
Sample Size
Weestimatedthat350veteranswouldprovide92%powerwith
a 2-tailed α = .05 to detect ACP documentation (primary out-
come) from 15% in the AD-only arm to 30% in the PREPARE
plus AD arm. We oversampled to 415 veterans to account for
up to 15% attrition.
Randomization, Allocation Concealment, Blinding,
and Fidelity
Because we hypothesized that literacy and cultural differences
maybeimportantdeterminantsofACPengagement,15,18,29par-
ticipants were block randomized, using a computer-based
random number generator, by health literacy (adequate vs
limited),30 and race/ethnicity (nonwhite vs white) in random
block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 by a statistician (J.B.) who was not in-
volved in recruitment. The initial visit included consent, base-
line assessments, and the interventions, which were longer in
the PREPARE plus AD arm. Because of the need to schedule in-
terviewroomstoaccommodatelongerPREPAREplusADinter-
views, randomization occurred at the time of scheduling.
Although participants could not be blinded to the inter-
vention, they were told during the consent process that they
had a “50/50 chance” of getting 1 of 2 different ACP guides.
However,thenonassignedinterventionwasnotdescribed.The
staff member who administered the intervention and base-
line interview was not blinded. However, all follow-up out-
come ascertainment was conducted by different staff blinded
to group allocation. Research staff asked participants at each
follow-uptonotdisclosethematerialstheyreviewed,andstaff
documented whether they became unblinded. If unblinding
occurred, a third blinded staff member conducted all subse-
quent interviews. Clinicians were blinded to patient group as-
signment; we obtained clinicians’permission to recruit their

 patients, but the interventions were not described, and no cli-
nician education was provided.
To ensure fidelity, staff followed study scripts and used
checklists for every study phase.19 Staff had to demonstrate
an ability to adhere to the protocol in role-playing exercises,
10% of all interviews and data capture were observed for ac-
curacy, and ongoing training was provided.
Statistical Methods
Variables were assessed for distributional and outlier values
using standard summary statistics. Baseline participant char-
acteristicswerecomparedbetweenarmsusingunpairedttests,
χ2, or Fisher exact tests. Using t tests or χ2 tests, we also com-
pared,byinterventiongroup,veterans’age,race/ethnicity,and
gender between those who refused vs those who enrolled and
between those who withdrew vs those who remained in the
study. We used intention-to-treat analysis using SAS statisti-
cal software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). All P values were
2-tailed and set at a significance level of .05. We used mixed-
effects logistic and linear regression with fixed effects for time
(baseline and 9 months for ACP documentation and 1 week, 3
months, and 6 months for secondary outcomes of the ACP
Engagement Survey modeled using dummy variables), group
(AD-only vs PREPARE plus AD) and group × time interaction
as well as blocking variables of literacy (adequate or limited)
and race/ethnicity (white or nonwhite). We also adjusted all
models for prior ACP documentation and potential clustering
by physician. We tested for interactions by adding interac-
tion terms to the group × time variable for age (<65 years and
≥65years),gender(womenandmen),race/ethnicity(whiteand
nonwhite), health literacy (adequate and limited), presence of
a possible surrogate decision maker (yes or no), health status
(fair-to-poororgood-to-excellent),andinternetaccessathome
(yes or no). A P value for interaction <.05 was considered sta-
tistically significant. Ease-of-use, satisfaction, depression, and
anxiety measures were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank test.
Missing Data
There were no missing data for the primary outcome (ie, all
medical records were reviewed). For secondary outcomes, less
than 10% of interviews were missing at any time point, and all
available data were included in the mixed-effects models. No
individual ACP Engagement Survey question was missing
greater than 10%; therefore, we used a mean imputation ap-
proach. If bias were to occur using this conservative ap-
proach, it would tend toward the null.31 We conducted sensi-
tivity analysis and excluded data for veterans whose research
assistants became unblinded.

 There were no significant differences in the 10-point self-
reported ease-of-use scales for PREPARE plus AD vs the AD-
onlyintervention(9.0[1.4]vs8.7[1.7];P = .31)orforthe5-point

tions (4.5 [0.7] vs 4.4 [0.8]; P = .57); helpfulness (4.4 [0.8] vs
4.3 [0.9]; P = .19); and likelihood of recommending the guides
(4.4 [0.9] vs 4.2 [1.1]; P = .10).
Noadverseeventswerereported.Aftercontrollingforbase-
line scores, there were no differences in depression or anxi-
ety between arms at 6 months. One participant assigned to the
AD-only arm was given PREPARE plus AD; however, this in-
dividual was analyzed in their assigned group. Outcomes did
not differ after excluding 7 individuals whose research assis-
tants became unblinded (5 PREPARE plus AD, 2 AD-only).
Discussion
In the absence of clinician- or systems-level interventions, the
easy-to-read AD (AD-only) increased new ACP documenta-
tion to 25%. PREPARE plus AD increased ACP documentation
to 35%. Both tools were rated highly in terms of ease-of-use,
satisfaction,andhelpfulness,suggestingthatPREPAREandthe
easy-to-read AD could serve as scalable, easy-to-disseminate
tools to improve the ACP process, especially in busy and re-
source-poor primary care clinics.
Prior studies have shown that passive ACP education with
written materials is less effective than ongoing education by
a trained health care professional.9 One reason may be the use
of ADs and other materials written beyond a 12th grade read-
ing level.32 The success of both PREPARE and the easy-to-
read AD may be explained by their attention to both literacy
and cultural considerations designed with and for diverse
communities.15,18 The PREPARE website may also help pa-
tients engage in ACP owing to the inclusion of “how-to” vid-
eos that model behavior based on behavior change and social
cognitive theories.18 In addition, videos have been shown to
help patients make end-of-life medical decisions.33
The easy-to-read AD-alone increased ACP documenta-
tion similar to a 52-page ACP workbook used among veterans
(easy-to-read AD, 25%; workbook, 23%), although the work-
book study included mostly educated, white men compared
with our diverse sample.34 In addition, in general, facilitator-
based models have shown marked improvement in clinical
communication and ACP documentation, well over 50%.6,35,36
In the VA workbook study, the addition of a social worker in-
tervention increased documentation to 48%, while the addi-
tion of PREPARE increased documentation to 35%. While all
care plans should eventually be reviewed by a clinician re-
gardless of whether they are initiated by patient-facing or fa-
cilitator-level interventions, these studies suggest that some
individuals may need a facilitator to begin to engage in the ACP
process. However, because it may not be feasible to provide a
facilitator for all patients, especially in resource-limited health
systems, the ACP documentation gains demonstrated in this
patient-facing only intervention study of 25% (AD-alone) and
35% (PREPARE plus AD) could have large public health impli-
cations. While combining the patient-facing tools with clini-
cian-, facilitator-, and system-level models would likely be
highly synergistic, further research is needed.
Limitations
Olderveterans,includingonly9%women,wererecruitedfrom
several clinics from the San Francisco VA, potentially limiting
generalizability. However, the sample was diverse. We did not
collect reasons for refusal, and it was not possible to blind pa-
tients to treatment. However, all staff conducting follow-up in-
terviewswereblindedtogroupallocation,andsensitivityanaly-

in study offices with computer access, potentially limiting gen-
eralizability to viewing at home. Furthermore, study inter-
views and reminder calls may be activating. Although re-
minder calls are a routine part of primary care at the VA, other

 programs may need to include reminders to obtain similar re-
sults, specifically reminders to bring in ADs.
Conclusions
Easy-to-use, patient-facing ACP tools, without clinician- and
system-level interventions, can increase ACP documentation
by 25% to 35%. Combining PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD
resulted in higher ACP documentation and engagement than
the AD alone. This study suggests that PREPARE and the easy-
to-read AD may be useful ACP interventions on a population
level, especially in resource-limited health systems. Al-
though these tools are likely to be synergistic with other cli-
nician- and system-level interventions, more research is
needed.
