Active full-length DNA Aβ42 immunization
in 3xTg-AD mice reduces not only amyloid
deposition but also tau pathology
Roger N. Rosenberg, Min Fu and Doris Lambracht-Washington*
Abstract
Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most well-known and most common type of age-related dementia.
Amyloid deposition and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein are both pathological hallmarks of AD. Using a triple-
transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD) that develops plaques and tangles in the brain similar to human AD, we provide
evidence that active full-length DNA amyloid-β peptide 1–42 (Aβ42) trimer immunization leads to reduction of both
amyloid and tau aggregation and accumulation.
Methods: Immune responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (antibody production)
and enzyme-linked immunospot (cellular activation, cytokine production). Brains from 20-month-old 3x Tg-AD mice
that had received DNA Aβ42 immunotherapy were compared with brains from age- and gender-matched transgenic
Aβ42 peptide-immunized and control mice by histology, Western blot analysis, and ELISA. Protein kinase activation and
kinase levels were studied in Western blots from mouse hemibrain lysates.
Results: Quantitative ELISA showed a 40% reduction of Aβ42 peptide and a 25–50% reduction of total tau and different
phosphorylated tau molecules in the DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized 3xTg-AD mice compared with nonimmunized 3xTg-
AD control animals. Plaque and Aβ peptide reductions in the brain were due to the anti-Aβ antibodies generated following
the immunizations. Reductions of tau were likely due to indirect actions such as less Aβ in the brain resulting in less tau
kinase activation.
Conclusions: The significance of these findings is that DNA Aβ42 trimer immunotherapy targets two major pathologies in
AD—amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles—in one vaccine without inducing inflammatory T-cell responses, which
carry the danger of autoimmune inflammation, as found in a clinical trial using active Aβ42 peptide immunization in patients
with AD (AN1792).

Introduction
Immunotherapeutic approaches have high potential for
successful treatment interventions in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Following the lessons learned from the first
anti-amyloid-β peptide 1–42 (anti-Aβ42) clinical trial
(AN1792), in which patients with AD received an Aβ42
vaccine and QS-21 adjuvant, which led to encephalitis in
6% of the treated patients, a major focus is now on
avoiding
autoimmune
inflammation
[1–3].
Ongoing
clinical trials are pursuing passive vaccination with
mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or fully human
antibodies against Aβ42 peptide epitopes to avoid com-
plications from autoimmunity [4–7]. A recent study in
which patients received passive immunotherapy with an
mAb targeting oligomeric or prefibrillar Aβ42 reported
positive results regarding amyloid reduction in the brain
as well as improved cognitive measurements [8].
Besides amyloid accumulation, tau aggregation and
spreading have been associated with progression of AD. In
fact, increased tau levels showed high correlation with
cognitive decline in patients with AD [9]. Tau immuno-
therapy is being evaluated in various preclinical and

 clinical trials as well, using active immunizations with
peptides from different parts of the tau protein or passive
immunizations using polyclonal or mAbs [10–15]. Antitau
antibodies have been shown to act inside and outside of
neurons and to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation as well
as pathogenic tau seeding [16–20].
We report, for the first time in an AD mouse model, that
active DNA Aβ42 immunization into the skin targets two
pathologies: amyloid-containing plaques and tau. DNA vac-
cination, in which not the antigen (peptide or protein) but
the DNA encoding this peptide is administered, is an alter-
native route of vaccination. Genes encoded by the DNA are
expressed within the skin, and the peptides are taken up by
dendritic cells traveling to the regional lymph nodes and
presenting the antigen to B and T cells [21]. Immune re-
sponses to DNA or peptide immunization differ qualita-
tively. We have shown previously that full-length DNA
Aβ42 trimer immunization is noninflammatory and induces
a regulatory immune response [22–25]. DNA Aβ42 trimer
immunization has been shown to be effective in removing
amyloid from the brain in immunized double-transgenic
mice (APPswe/PS1 [26–28]). In the present study, we used
a triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) that ex-
hibits Aβ and tau pathologies characteristic of human AD
[29, 30]. We found that immunotherapy with DNA Aβ42
trimer leads to reduction of Aβ40/Aβ42 peptides and amyl-
oid plaques, and we show for the first time that DNA Aβ42
trimer immunization leads also to significant reduction of
tau from the mouse brain.
Methods
Animals
3xTg-AD [B6;129-Tg(APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm/
Mmjax, MMRRC Stock No: 34830-JAX] mice had been
purchased from the Mutant Mouse Research and Resource
Center at The Jackson Laboratory and were bred and
housed at the UT Southwestern Medical Center animal fa-
cility under conventional conditions. This mouse model
had been developed by Oddo and colleagues [29, 30]. Ani-
mal use was approved by the UT Southwestern Medical
Center Animal Research Committee, and animal research
was conducted under the Animal Research: Reporting of In
Vivo Experiments guidelines [31].
Study design
Cohorts of 3xTg-AD mice were immunized with a DNA
Aβ42 trimer vaccine, Aβ42 peptide (rPeptide, Watskin-
ville, GA, luciferase (Luc) control DNA, or left untreated
as controls. This mouse model that had been developed
by Oddo and colleagues develops plaque and tangle
pathology [29, 30]. Cohort 1 consisted of 16 Tg female
mice and 8 wild-type controls, and cohort 2 consisted of
34 Tg female mice. Parallel immunized groups of
3xTg-AD males (16 males in cohort 3, 15 males in
cohort 4) showed no plaque pathologies at 18 and
20 months of age, so this study used females only. The
mice were vaccinated at a total of 13 time points until
20 months of age for final analyses. Collected brains
were cut in a sagittal plane. One hemibrain was frozen
and used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELI-
SAs) and Western blots, and the other half was fixed for
immunostaining with anti-Aβ and antitau antibodies.
Immunizations and collection of blood samples
Immunizations were started in 4-month-old mice in groups
of four to eight mice (3xTg-AD and 129/SvJ wild-type con-
trols) with three initial immunizations in biweekly intervals
(Fig. 1) with a Gal4/DNA Aβ42 trimer double-plasmid sys-
tem (4 μg of DNA/immunization, ratio of 3:1 DNA Aβ42
trimer responder plasmid/Gal4 activator plasmid) via intra-
dermal injection using a Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories, Hercules, CA, USA) or via intraperitoneal injections
of Aβ42 peptide (100 μg of peptide/immunization) with
Quil-A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as adjuvant as
previously described [22–25]. The immunizations were
boosted in 6-week intervals until the mice were 18 or
20 months old (up to 13 immunizations) (Fig. 1a). Control
mice received Luc DNA immunizations (group 1) or no
treatment (naïve controls, group 2). Blood samples were
collected at different time points throughout the study
10 days following the respective immunization time points.
IHC of mouse brains
Sagittal parallel sections of paraformaldehyde (PFA)--
fixed female mouse brains were stained with antibodies
specific for Aβ42 (6E10, BioLegend, San Diego, CA,
USA;
McSA1,
MédiMabs,
Montreal,
QC,
Canada;
MOAB-2, MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA) to detect
intraneuronal Aβ42 deposition and amyloid plaques in
the hippocampus and cortex of the mice. To stain for
tangle pathology, we used HT7, AT8, AT100, AT180,
and AT270 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) and T22 (MilliporeSigma); anti-tau antibodies
pT231, pS214, and pS404 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA); and Tyr18 (MédiMabs). NeuN antibodies (clone
ABN78, MilliporeSigma; clone 1B7, Abcam) were used
to stain neurons. Prior to the staining, sections were
treated with heat-mediated antigen retrieval for all the
tau antibodies or incubation in 70% formic acid for all
the Aβ antibodies. After staining, tissues were scanned
using a NanoZoomer digital pathology system and ana-
lyzed with NDP.view software (both from Hamamatsu
Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan).
Positive antibody staining area quantification
The Aβ and tau immunoreactive areas were quantified
using the “area measure” tool in ImageJ software (Na-
tional Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA [32]).

 Immunostained sections (sagittal sections of mouse
brain) were imaged with a 20× objective and were con-
verted into 8-bit grayscale. The Analyze > Measure tool
was used to measure the total area occupied by positive
staining in each image. The total area was averaged for
the sections per mouse group. Values are arbitrary units
expressed as mean ± SEM per area.
Anti-Aβ42 antibody ELISA and cytokine enzyme-linked
immunospot assays
ELISAs for antibody levels in mouse plasma were per-
formed according to standard procedures. Cytokine con-
centrations from cell culture supernatants and enzyme-
linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays to determine fre-
quencies
of
cytokine-secreting
cells
were
performed

 according to standard procedures and as previously de-
scribed using commercially available antibody sets for
mouse interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-4
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) [23–25].
Aβ and tau ELISAs
For semiquantitative analyses of total Aβ42, Aβ40, and tau
(total tau, pT231, pS396, pT181, and pS199) levels in the
brain, standard ELISAs were used (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). Frozen mouse hemibrains of female mice were ho-
mogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 volumes
(wet brain weight) of extraction buffer [1 mM Tris, 1 mM
ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraa-
cetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% su-
crose, pH 7.5). Following homogenization, lysates were
centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to clear the
homogenate. The supernatant (Sup 1) was removed, and
the pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton® X-100/1 mM
Tris/1 mM EGTA/1 mM DTT/10% sucrose, pH 7.5. The
solution was centrifuged at 188,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant was removed and stored at − 80 °C
(detergent-soluble supernatant). The pellet was washed,
dried, and dissolved in 5 M guanidine (nonsoluble frac-
tion). Lysates containing the detergent-soluble and -non-
soluble brain fractions were further diluted in homogenate
assay buffer (0.2 g/L KCl, 0.2 g/L KH2PO4, 8.0 g/L NaCl,
1.15 g/L Na2HPO4, 5% bovine serum albumin [fraction
V], 0.03% Tween® 20, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, and
1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4). Further dilu-
tions and ELISAs were performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Western blot analysis
Soluble hemibrain lysate fractions from female mice were
separated on 12% or 8–16% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
probed with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The
following antibodies were used: Tau12, 43D (BioLegend),
HT7
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific),
anti-extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (anti-ERK1/2) and phosphory-
lated ERK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2
(MEK1/2) and phosphorylated MEK1/2, GSK-3β, GSK-3α/
β, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
β-actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA), tubulin β (1:1000; Bio-Rad Laboratories), and phos-
phorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) Y216
(1:1000;
Abcam).
After
incubation
with
horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated
secondary
antibodies
(Thermo
Fisher Scientific; SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA),
antibody binding was visualized with an enhanced chemilu-
minescence detection reagent (ProSignal ECL; Genesee Sci-
entific, San Diego, CA, USA) and captured on a Syngene
G:Box system using GeneSys software (Syngene USA, Fred-
erick, MD, USA). Gray-level intensities (densitometries)
were quantified using gel analysis in ImageJ software [32].
For verification of similar total protein concentrations ap-
plied on the SDS-PAGE gels, filters were reprobed with
housekeeping genes GAPDH, actin, and tubulin.
Statistics
For statistical analysis (unpaired Student’s t test with
two-tailed p values, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test,
parametric multiple comparisons one-way analysis of vari-
ance [ANOVA] and column statistics), Prism software ver-
sion 6 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA) was used. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Humoral and cellular immune responses in Aβ42-
immunized mice
In 20-month-old transgenic mice that had received 13
immunizations (Fig. 1a), antibody levels reached 69.88 ±
11.08 μg of anti-Aβ42 immunoglobulin G (IgG)/ml of
plasma (63.77 ± 19.53 μg anti-Aβ42 IgG/ml plasma in
group 2) after DNA Aβ42 immunization and 655.9 ±
9.58 μg/ml after Aβ42 peptide immunization (763.4 ±
11.88 μg anti-Aβ42 IgG/ml plasma in group 2). Similar
antibody
levels
were
found
in
parallel
immunized
20-month-old
wild-type
control
animals:
49.79 ±
6.35 μg/ml in DNA Aβ42-immunized mice and 659.7 ±
6.95 μg/ml in Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice (Fig. 1b).
DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice had high levels of
IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies. The overall isotype compos-
ition was IgG1 = IgG2b > IgG2a/c (IgG1/IgG2a ratio of
1.61). Low levels of IgG2a/c antibodies were consistent
with a noninflammatory Th2 immune response (Fig. 1c).
All peptide-immunized mice had mixed isotype profiles
with similar levels of IgG1, IgG2a/c, and IgG2b anti-
bodies, indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response
(Fig. 1d). This mixed profile was found at high plasma
dilutions up to 1:20,000 (Fig. 1e).
ELISPOT assays from splenocyte cultures of 3xTg-AD
mice and wild-type mice were performed to detect
IFN-γ (Th1 cytokine), IL-17A (Th17 cytokine), and IL-4
(Th2 cytokine) upon Aβ42 peptide restimulation in the
immunized mice. Although we found high numbers of
IFN-γ- and IL-17-secreting cells in peptide-immunized
mice, low numbers of cells secreting these proinflamma-
tory cytokines were found in DNA-immunized mice. In
peptide immunized 3xTg-AD mice, IFN-γ-secreting cells
were detected with 8 ± 11.27 spots in medium control
wells and more than 1000 spots in the Aβ42 peptide re-
stimulated wells (p < 0.0001 by Mann-Whitney U test)
(Fig. 1f). We counted 104.7 ± 47.9 spots in medium con-
trol wells of DNA Aβ42-immunized 3xTg-AD mice with
no increase in peptide restimulated wells (92 ± 39.95
spots; p = 0.7428). A similar pattern was observed for
IL-17-secreting cells with increased numbers in Aβ42

 peptide-immunized mice: 227 ± 15.52 spots after peptide
restimulation compared with 5.3 ± 4.04 spots in medium
control wells (p < 0.0001 by Mann Whitney U test) and
no significant increase in IL-17-secreting cells after pep-
tide restimulation in DNA Aβ42-immunized mice (87.33
± 30.6 spots in Aβ42 peptide-containing wells, 111.7 ±
24.58 spots in medium control wells; p = 0.3439) (Fig. 1g).
For a peptide mix (Aβ10–26/Aβ17–31) containing the
T-cell epitope of several mouse major histocompatibility
complex haplotypes (H2b, H2k, H2d, H2s), similar results
were obtained in the ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1f).
Histology showing amyloid reduction from brain
In the initial studies, we used male and female mice and
found large differences in the pathology between sexes.
Figure 2a–d shows sections of 18- and 20-month-old mice
for comparison of Aβ42 pathology in females and males.
In 20-month-old mice, large numbers of Aβ plaques were
found in the subiculum of the hippocampus in female
mice (Fig. 2a), whereas no plaques were found in the
20-month-old males (Fig. 2b). Also, for tau antibody stain-
ing (HT7, AT180) in parallel sections, much less path-
ology was found in male mice (data not shown), and
therefore we continued immunotherapy in the following
groups only in females. In 18-month-old mice, amyloid
plaques were abundant in the female mice (Fig. 2c). In
age-matched male mice, only a few neurons with intracel-
lular Aβ42 staining were found, but no plaques (Fig. 2d).
Aβ42 immunotherapy led to a reduction of the number
of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus of treated mice. In
Fig. 2e–h, staining for NeuN, which stains neurons (red
color), and an Aβ antibody (McSA1), which stains amyloid
plaques (brown color) are shown for the hippocampal area
for representative examples of the different mouse groups
in one experimental cohort. The mAb McSA1 recognizes
the N-terminal region of the human Aβ peptide (Aβ1–12).
This epitope is present in β-C-terminal fragment and
amyloid precursor protein (APP) as well, but McSA1 has
been reported as highly specific for Aβ as opposed to APP
or soluble APP following competition studies with these
antigens [33, 34]. Figure 2e shows staining of the hippo-
campus subiculum of a 20-month-old 3xTg-AD control
female mouse. Figure 2f shows this area stained for neu-
rons and amyloid in a 20-month-old wild-type control
mouse. A reduction of amyloid plaques was seen in all
mice that had received Aβ immunotherapy. Representa-
tive sections are shown for one Aβ42 peptide-immunized
mouse (Fig. 2g) and one DNA Aβ42-immunized 3xTg-AD
mouse (Fig. 2h).
Immunohistological staining of plaques in the brains
of these mice was subjected to the counting of plaques
> 10 μm in corresponding 1-mm2 areas (subiculum/
CA1) of 15 control mice (7 DNA Aβ42-immunized mice
and 8 Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice) by two blinded
experimenters. These analyses showed significantly re-
duced plaque numbers in the DNA Aβ42-immunized
mice (p = 0.0238 by Student’s t test compared with con-
trol mice) and a nonsignificant reduction in the Aβ42
peptide-immunized mice (p = 0.6809). Also, the differ-
ence in plaque numbers between the DNA Aβ42- and
peptide-immunized mice was significant (p = 0.0487)
(Fig. 2i).
Histology showing reduction in levels of phospho-tau
The use of the 3xTg-AD mouse model allowed us to
analyze a second pathology of human AD, which is the
hyperphosphorylation of tau and development of neurofib-
rillary tangles. IHC of 3xTg-AD brain sections with differ-
ent antibodies specific for tau molecules phosphorylated at
specific residues (AT180, AT8, AT270, pT404, pS212,
Tyr18) showed that Aβ42 immunotherapy also led to a sig-
nificant reduction in the levels of tau phosphorylation. In
Fig. 3a, the age progression for tau phosphorylation in the
3xTg-AD mouse model is shown. Brains from 2-, 4-, 7-, 9-,
12-, and 18-month-old mice (n = 4/group) were harvested,
and PFA-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were analyzed
with the mAb AT180, which detects tau phosphorylated at
residue T231. In the comparison of the staining pattern
with brains from 18-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, which had
received DNA Aβ42 immunizations, we observed that the
AT180 staining intensity of the immunized 18-month-old
mice appeared more like the staining intensity in brains
from 7- or 9-month-old mice (Fig. 3b). Sections from four

and

18-month-old Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice were semi-
quantitatively analyzed with the area measure tool in Ima-
geJ software. The results showed an about 40% reduction
after DNA Aβ42 immunization and an approximately 20%
reduction after Aβ42 peptide immunization (Fig. 3c). How-
ever, owing to high SDs and the small number of control
animals, the results were not statistically significant.
Staining with the AT8 antibody specific for pS201/
pT205, which is a late tau phosphorylation site [35], was
less prominent in 18-month-old mice, but good staining
was observed in 20-month-old mice, which showed re-
duction of AT8 staining in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized
mice. Figure 3d shows that AT8-positive neurons were
detected in the hippocampus of 20-month-old 3xTg-AD
control mice (sections from two mice). Two representa-
tive
sections
from
the
Aβ42
peptide-immunized
20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice are shown in Fig. 3e. The
brains showed fewer AT8-positive neurons than in the
control animals. Much less staining was found in DNA
Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice. Figure 3 shows the re-
spective brain sections of the hippocampus from two
mice (insets show higher magnification of subiculum in
Fig. 3f).

hippocampus by two blinded experimenters. Blue bars show plaque count in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice (n = 7), and yellow bars show plaque
count found in brains of Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice (n = 8). Black bars show the numbers found in age- and gender-matched 3xTg-AD control
mice (n = 15). * indicates p value of ≤ 0.05 (unpaired Student's t test)

 The histological data indicating a possible reduction of
tau in the Aβ42-immunized mice led to further substan-
tiation of this finding by Western blot analysis and a
panel of commercially available tau ELISAs that allowed
testing for statistical significance of reduction of differ-
ent tau phosphorylation patterns.
Western blot analysis of total tau
The reduction of tau in mice that had received Aβ42 im-
munotherapy was further analyzed using Western blot-
ting of the brain lysates. In the comparison of total tau
detected with the mAb Tau12, it was found that both
immunotherapies led to a reduction in tau. The reduc-
tion was not significant in Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice
and was higher and significant in DNA Aβ42-immunized
mice (p values of 0.0302, 0.0142, and 0.0023 from three
independently performed Western blot analyses with
detergent-soluble brain lysates). Figure 3g and h shows
the results of one of these experiments (Western blot
and ImageJ analysis of gray-level intensities of the bands,
respectively). Total tau and phosphorylated tau were fur-
ther analyzed by Western blotting, and the results are
shown in Fig. 4. All band intensities were normalized to
band intensities found in the reprobing of the Western
blots with antibodies to housekeeping proteins. In the
detergent-soluble fractions, tau detected with the mAb
Tau12 was significantly reduced in brain lysates from
DNA Aβ42-immunized mice (p = 0.0059 by Student’s un-
paired t test) (Fig. 4a). The intensity of the Western blot
band reactive to the mAb AT8 was only slightly reduced
in DNA Aβ42-immunized mice (p = 0.3224, nonsignifi-
cant). The AT8-reactive protein band was found at
higher molecular weight (about 65 kDa), which might
correspond
to
the
64
kDa
tau,
a
Tris-buffered
saline-extractable hyperphosphorylated tau species de-
scribed in the rTg4510 mouse brain (Fig. 4a, middle
panel) [36]. In Fig. 4b, two different total human tau
antibodies, 43D and HT7, were directly compared in
parallel-run SDS-PAGE. Significant reductions of tau
were

Fig. 4 Western blot analyses for total and phosphorylated tau. Equal amounts of proteins from detergent-soluble brain lysates of 20-month-old triple-
transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (3xTg-AD) mice (D1–D5 = DNA Aβ42-immunized mice, P1–P4 = amyloid-β 1–42 [Aβ42] peptide-immunized mice, C1–C5 =
3xTg-AD control mice, wt = wild-type controls) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and probed using antibodies specific for
total human tau (a, upper panel), and phosphorylated tau AT8 (a, middle panel), and β-tubulin as a loading control (a, bottom panel). The graph on the
right-hand side of the SDS-PAGE pictures shows analyses of the band intensities performed with ImageJ software. All gray-level intensities of tau protein
bands were normalized to the gray-level intensities of protein bands of the housekeeping proteins β-tubulin or β-actin, respectively. The reduction of total
tau in the DNA-immunized mice compared with the 3xTg-AD control animals was highly significant (p = 0.0059). Of note, gray-level intensities for sample
D2 were not included in thess calculations, because the loading control for this sample indicated a much lower protein content (a, bottom panel). b A
comparison of total tau levels in DNA-immunized mice, 3xTg-AD control mice, and wt control mice in Western blots is shown using two different
antibodies. In the upper panel, 43D (Tau1–100) was used for detection; in the middle panel, antibody HT7 was used; and in the lower panel, the same
membrane was probed with a β-actin antibody as a protein loading control. The graph on the right-hand side of the panels shows the analyses of gray-
level intensities for the protein bands with ImageJ software normalized to gray-level intensities of the housekeeping protein β-actin. Differences were
statistically significant with p values of 0.0152 (HT7) and 0.0138 (43D). * and ** indicate p values of ≤ 0.05 and ≤ 0.01, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test)

antibody, p = 0.0138).
These results are consistent with the ELISA results de-
scribed in the “Quantification of tau in ELISAs” section
below. Although the reductions in the detergent-soluble
brain lysate fractions were obvious but statistically not
significant, reductions in the nonsoluble brain lysates
were highly significant. However, the nonsoluble frac-
tions could not be tested, owing to the extraction
method used with 5 M guanidine for the solubilization
of the pellet. These samples are not compatible with
SDS-PAGE. In future mouse cohorts, we will use a dif-
ferent extraction protocol allowing the nonsoluble brain
lysate
fractions
to
be
analyzed
in
Western
blots
(SDS-PAGE).
Quantification of Aβx-42 and Aβx-40 in ELISAs
After analysis of brain histology as shown in Fig. 2, ELI-
SAs were used for semiquantitative analyses of reduction
of Aβx-40 and Aβx-42 peptides in DNA Aβ42 trimer- and
Aβ42 peptide-immunized female 3xTg-AD mice. An in-
crease of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides in brains from 3xTg-AD
mice with age is shown in Fig. 5a. ELISAs were also used
to quantify the reduction of Aβx-40 and Aβx-42 peptides
due to DNA Aβ42 trimer and Aβ42 peptide immunization
(Fig. 5b and c). Statistical significance for reduction of
Aβ42 and Aβ40 was reached in the comparison of DNA
Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice (n = 7, blue bars) compared
with control animals (n = 14, black bars) in the nonsoluble
fractions (p = 0.0461, Mann-Whitney U test, for Aβx-42; p
= 0.0125 for Aβx-40). These reductions were nonsignificant
in the one-way ANOVA (Fig. 5b). In the soluble brain lys-
ate fractions, a reduction of both Aβ peptides was highly
significant (p < 0.0008, Mann-Whitney U test; p = 0.0123,
one-way-ANOVA, for Aβx-42; p = 0.0017, Mann-Whitney
U test; p = 0.0028, one-way ANOVA for Aβx-40) (Fig. 5c)
in DNA Aβ42-immunized mice. Aβx-42 peptides were also
reduced
in
brains
from
Aβ42
peptide-immunized
3xTg-AD mice in the nonsoluble lysate and detergent-sol-
uble lysates, but levels did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.2766 for nonsoluble Aβx-42, p = 0.0815 for soluble
Aβx-42). Much less removal was found for Aβx-40 peptides
in brains from Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice (Fig. 5b and
c, yellow bars, right-hand graphs).
Quantification of tau in ELISAs
Histological analyses of the mouse brains with tau anti-
bodies AT180 and AT8 (early and late tau phosphorylation)
showed reduced staining in the immunized mice (Fig. 3).
ELISAs were used for detection of total tau, pT231 tau,
p396 tau, pT181 tau, and pS199 tau in the semiquantitative
analyses of tau reduction in DNA Aβ42 trimer- and Aβ42
peptide-immunized 3xTg-AD mice. Tau was reduced in
both mouse groups, which had received Aβ42 immunother-
apy or DNA or peptide vaccine (Fig. 6a–e, Table 1). How-
ever, statistical significance was reached only in the DNA
Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice (Table 1).
High levels of tau protein were found in the detergent
soluble fractions: 1.235 × 105 ± 0.556 × 105 pg/ml brain
lysate in the 20-month-old female 3xTg-AD control
mice (n = 14), with small reductions in the mouse groups
that had received Aβ42 immunotherapy (1.201 × 105 ±
0.44 × 105 pg/mg in the peptide-immunized mice [p =
0.9754, n = 9], and 0.928 × 105 ± 0.324 × 105 pg/mg [p =
0.1285] in DNA-immunized mice [n = 7]). Higher reduc-
tions of total tau were found in the nonsoluble brain lys-
ate fractions: control mice had mean values of 7.322 ×
105 ± 3.301 × 105 pg/mg; Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice
had
levels
of
6.879 × 105 ± 3.153 × 105
pg/mg
brain
weight (p = 0.8446); and DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized
mice had significantly reduced levels of 3.793 × 105 ±
1.096 × 106 pg/mg brain weight of total human tau (p =
0.0411, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 6a).
pT231 tau reached mean values of 1793 ± 490.3 U/mg
brain weight in the detergent-soluble brain lysate fractions of
3xTg-AD
control
mice,
1454 ± 390.6
U/mg
in
Aβ42
peptide-immunized mice, and 1199 ± 221.5 U/mg in DNA
Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice. Although the reduction in the
peptide-immunized mice was not significant (p = 0.4767),
the reduction in DNA-immunized mice was highly signifi-
cant (p = 0.0091). In the nonsoluble brain fractions, a mean
value of 1.296 × 105 ± 0.282 × 105 U/mg pT231 tau was
found for control mice, 1.313 ± 0.338 × 105 U/mg was found
in
peptide-immunized
mice,
and
0.809 × 105 ± 0.192 ×
105 U/mg was found in DNA-immunized mice (Fig. 6b).
Thus, Aβ immunotherapy reduced the nonsoluble pT231
only in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice (p = 0.0017).
pS396 tau was slightly reduced in the detergent-sol-
uble
fraction
for
DNA
Aβ42
trimer-
and
Aβ42
peptide-immunized female mice compared with 3xTg-
AD female control mice (889.2 ± 273.2 pg/mg, 1264 ±
389.1 pg/mg, and 1441 ± 566 pg/mg, respectively; p = ns
by one-way ANOVA). pS396 was significantly reduced in
DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice in the nonsoluble frac-
tions with mean levels of 0.631 × 105 ± 0.121 × 105 pg/mg
(p = 0.0007) compared with 1.136 × 105 ± 0.272 × 105 pg/
mg in the 3xTg-AD control mice (Fig. 6c).
For pT181 tau, mean levels of 3.869 × 104± 1.774 ×
104 pg/mg in the detergent-soluble brain lysates of 3xTg-AD
control mice were reduced to 3.098 × 104 ± 0.99 × 104 pg/mg
in Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice (p = 0.3686) and to
1.969 × 104 ± 0.507 × 104 pg/mg in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immu-
nized mice (p = 0.0198). In the nonsoluble brain fractions, a
level of 1.876 × 105 ± 0.591 × 105 pg/mg was measured for
female 3xTg-AD control mice, which was reduced to
1.672 × 105 ± 0.661 × 105 pg/mg (p = 0.5123) in Aβ42 pepti-
de-immunized mice and to 0.911 × 105 ± 0.248 × 105 pg/mg

 (p = 0.002, one-way ANOVA) in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immu-
nized 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. 6d).
pS199 tau was also reduced after DNA Aβ42 immuno-
therapy: 20-month-old 3xTg-AD control mice had a mean
5341 ± 1208 pg/mg wet brain weight in the detergent-soluble
fractions, and DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice had a
reduced level of 3227 ± 730.5 pg/mg wet brain weight
(p = 0.0012). Aβ42 peptide-immunized mice showed no re-
duction (5094 ± 1246 pg/mg, p = 0.5995). Significant differ-
ences were present in the nonsoluble brain lysate fractions
between female control and DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized
mice with mean levels of 2.69 × 105 ± 5.46 × 104 pg/mg in

in
DNA-immunized mice (p = 0.0007) (Fig. 6e, Table 1). In
peptide-immunized mice the reduction was not significant,
with 2.34 × 105 ± 6.86 × 104 pg pS199/mg (p = 0.2496).
In comparison of the two Aβ immunotherapies, a bet-
ter reduction with high significance for phosphorylated
tau molecules was found in DNA Aβ42 trimer-immu-
nized mice. Percentages of reduction were calculated for
the groups, and the results are shown in Table 1. A
greater than 20% higher reduction was found in the
detergent-soluble brain fractions of DNA-immunized
mice for pT181 and pS396. This was statistically signifi-
cant in the comparison of DNA- and peptide-immu-
nized mice for pS396 (p < 0.0311) (Table 1). For the
nonsoluble brain fractions, 12–25% higher reductions
were found in lysates from DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized
mice for total tau, pT231, pT181, and pS396. These
values were statistically significant for the comparisons
with the age- and gender-matched control mice (Fig. 6)
and also in the comparison between the differently im-
munized groups of mice (Table 1).
Analyses of kinase variations
Western blot analyses were performed to detect whether
different enzymatic kinase patterns could be found in
brains from immunized mice. Significantly reduced
levels of phosphorylated MEK (MAP2K), and phosphor-
ylated ERK1/2 (p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kin-
ase [MAPK]), as well as reduced levels for the activated
form of GSK3β (Y216), were found in brains from
DNA-immunized mice. Figure 7 shows the detection
MEK1/2 and phospho-MEK1/2 (Fig. 7a), as well as ERK1/2
and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 7b), in brain lysates from
seven DNA Aβ42-immunized mice compared with seven
age- and gender-matched 3xTg-AD control mice and two
20-month-old wild-type mice.
Results from the semiquantitative analysis of gray-level
intensities (ImageJ software) are depicted in Fig. 8. Re-
ductions in protein levels of phospho-MEK1/2 (Fig. 8a),
total ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 8b) in DNA
Aβ42-immunized mice were significant (p values of
0.0379, 0.0006, and 0.0087, respectively, by Mann-Whit-
ney U test). Significant reductions were also found for
protein levels of activated GSK3β (p = 0.0006) (Fig. 8c).
These data were further normalized against the protein
levels of total MEK1/2, total ERK1/2, and total GSKα/β
for each of the bands individually to compensate for the
possibility of different overall protein levels for the tested
enzymes in the brain lysates and shown as a percentage
of protein (percentage of phosphorylated MEK, ERK,
and
GSKα/β).
The
percentage
difference
for
phospho-MEK1/2 was highly significant between control
and DNA Aβ42-immunized mice (p = 0.0031). In the
comparison of phosho-ERK1/2 with total ERK1/2 in the
DNA Aβ42-immunized mice, the reduction was not sig-
nificant, because these mice already had less total ERK1/
2. The percentage reduction of phospho-GSK3β (Y216)
in the DNA Aβ42-immunized mice was highly significant
(p = 0.006). No differences in protein levels between the
mouse groups were observed for the proteins MEK1/2
(Fig. 7a), GSK3α/β (Fig. 7c), and the housekeeping pro-
tein β-tubulin (Fig. 7d). Of note, a blot with GSK3α/β is
shown in the comparison for activated GSK3β because it
appears that there is weak cross-reactivity of this specific
antibody with both GSK3 bands (Fig. 7c, lower panel),
but differences were seen only for the strong reactivity
with GSK3β phosphorylated at residue Y216 (46 kD
band). Only this activated form of GSK3β is described
and discussed. No significant differences were found for

Discussion
DNA Aβ42 immunotherapy results in significant reduc-
tions in Aβ42 peptide and plaque load in brains of the
3xTg-AD mouse model at 20 months of age, consistent
with our previous results in double-transgenic mice [26,
27]. New findings shown with this vaccine for the first
time were significant reductions of total tau and phos-
phorylated tau in brains of mice that had received active
DNA Aβ42 trimer immunizations. This finding was con-
firmed by histology, Western blot analysis, and ELISA.
Despite the 10× levels of anti-Aβ antibodies in peptide-
immunized mice, peptide immunization was less effica-
cious,
which
is
indicative
of
different
Aβ
species
detected and removed by the antibodies generated
following DNA Aβ42 immunization (e.g., Aβ oligomers).
In fact, this was highly consistent throughout the study
with more Aβ and more tau removed in DNA Aβ42
trimer-immunized mice than in Aβ42 peptide-immu-
nized mice in all three assay systems used (immunohis-
tology, Western blotting, ELISA). We had previously
shown that the expression of the DNA Aβ42 trimer vac-
cine in skin shows production of Aβ oligomers [37]. We
had also previously shown that the epitope specificity of
antibodies produced after DNA Aβ42 immunization dif-
fers from the Aβ1–15 B-cell epitope specificity and shows
a wide reactivity with epitopes across the Aβ1–42 peptide
[38–40]. Aβ oligomers in particular activate tau kinases,
leading to hyperphosphorylation, and Aβ oligomers are
also strong activators for cellular caspases, leading to tau
cleavage and tau aggregation. Hyperphosphorylated tau
and truncated tau are both prone to self-aggregation and
tau accumulation in neurons, and phosphorylation of

 specific residues in tau (e.g., S422) are important for
caspase-mediated cleavage. Thus, less tau phosphoryl-
ation leads to less tau truncation via caspase-mediated
cleavage and therefore reduces tau aggregation and total
tau levels, explaining why Aβ42 immunization and re-
duction of Aβ42 peptides in brain led also to reduction
of total tau [41–49].
DNA Aβ42 immunotherapy led to a noninflammatory
immune response with no T-cell proliferation and no in-
flammatory cytokines produced during the cellular im-
mune responses in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, similar
to the immune responses we had found in the wild-type
mouse model [22–25]. Although in the Balb/c wild-type
mouse strain IgG1 was a dominant IgG antibody isotype
in the humoral immune response [37], other mouse
strains showed also a strong anti-Aβ42 IgG2b antibody
production similar to the one found in the 3xTg-AD
mouse used in the present study (unpublished data).
Aβ42 peptide immunization led to a mixed immune
response with high levels of all antibody isotypes, includ-
ing IgG2a/c, and high levels of inflammatory cytokines
in AD mouse models and wild-type mice [22–25, 28]. In
a prime boost study, in which the immune response was
first primed with Aβ42 peptide immunizations and then
boosted with DNA Aβ42 immunizations in wild-type
mice, we found that even though the anti-Aβ42 antibody
isotype profile had high levels of “inflammatory” IgG2a/c
antibodies, no inflammatory cytokines were detected in
the cellular in vitro assays, providing evidence that the
DNA immunization resulted in the downregulation of
inflammatory cellular responses [50]. Antibody isotypes
strongly influence the therapeutic effect of a treatment
or vaccine because the different antibody isotypes have
different effector functions (complement binding, Fc re-
ceptor binding). In AD immunotherapy, microglial acti-
vation is thought to help remove excess Aβ from the
brain, so that FcR binding is not a negative feature of
the antibody per se. Furthermore, the epitope detected

20-month-old triple-transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (3xTg-AD) mice (D1–D7 = DNA Aβ42-immunized mice, C1–C7 = 3xTg-AD control mice, wt = wild-type
control mice) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and probed using antibodies specific for MEK (a, upper panel) and its active form
phosphorylated MEK (a lower panel), total ERK1/2 (b, upper panel) and the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (b lower panel), and GSK3α/β (c, upper panel) and
activated GSK3β (c, lower panel). Of note, a blot with GSK3α/β is shown in the comparison for activated GSK3β because it appears that there was weak cross-
reactivity of this specific antibody with both GSK3 bands (c, lower panel), but differences were seen only for the strong reactivity with GSK3β phosphorylated at
residue Y216 (46 kD band). As a loading control, the blots were reprobed with the housekeeping protein β-tubulin (d). All assays were performed three times
in independent experiments. Shown are representative results from one of these assays

 by the respective antibody pool is crucial for removal of
amyloid from the brain [51–53]. Thus, the multivalent
nature of the humoral immune response following DNA
Aβ42 immunization is beneficial in many aspects.
To address how either DNA Aβ42 or Aβ peptide vacci-
nations can cause both Aβ and tau reduction, we investi-
gated
a
number
of
kinases
involved
in
tau
phosphorylation that had also been shown to be acti-
vated by Aβ42 peptides and in particular Aβ42 oligomers
[54–56]. We were able to show differences for the acti-
vated/phosphorylated kinases MEK1/2, p40/p42 MAPK1
and MAPK2 (ERK1/2), and GSK-3β in brain protein
lysates from female DNA Aβ42-immunized mice com-
pared with the age- and gender (female)-matched 3xTg-
AD control mice, supportive of the assumption that a
higher removal of Aβ oligomers after DNA Aβ42 trimer
immunization has significant effects on tau pathology
via changes on cellular kinases. ERK1 and ERK2 are both
highly expressed in the brain, and it had been shown in
vitro that ERK2 is capable of phosphorylating a large
number
of
residues
in
tau.

 Aβ42 oligomers in a cell culture system as well as in
postmortem human AD brains indicated a pathologic
link between Aβ and this particular MAPK pathway
[57–59]. It has been suggested by others that the two
main pathologies of AD, amyloid and tau aggregation,
affect the aging brain and cause changes in large-scale
neuronal circuits [60]. We show in the present study
that DNA Aβ42 immunization led to significant changes
in several pathways. Further analyses of the mechanism
of action on tau reduction and changes in cellular signal-
ing pathways in the DNA Aβ42 trimer-immunized mice
are goals for future research.
It had been shown before in the 3xTg-AD mouse
model that antitau immunotherapy or passive anti-Aβ
immunotherapy led to removal of tau or Aβ or both
[19, 43, 55, 61–64]. Of note, these studies were of
passive immunotherapy using preformed mAbs or the
intracranial injection of anti-Aβ or antitau antibodies,
which is different from the active immunization done in
the present study. It had also been shown before that
immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding Aβ1–11 or a
short tau epitope led to the production of antibodies
against Aβ or tau, respectively [65, 66]. We show for the
first time a different mechanism in which active DNA
Aβ42 trimer immunization in the 3xTg-AD mouse model
results in reduction of both pathologies with one vaccine:
Aβ reduction due to antibodies generated against Aβ and
tau reduction due to an indirect mechanism in which less
Aβ led to less tau kinase activation and therefore to less
tau phosphorylation. Of note, also in AN-1792, a clinical
trial using Aβ42 immunotherapy in patients with AD, a
trend toward reduction in cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau
concentrations was reported, and analysis of postmortem
brain tissue showed a reduction of aggregated tau in neur-
onal processes [1–3, 67].
Current assessments of Aβ immunotherapy for the pre-
vention of AD in several completed and ongoing trials
show divergent responses [68]. Positive results in patients
treated with the mAb aducanumab support the effective-
ness of Aβ immunotherapy in patients with early AD [8].
Aducanumab is a fully human IgG1 antibody that corre-
sponds to the IgG2a antibody isotype in the mouse. Of
note, aducanumab has been characterized as an antibody
that binds to soluble Aβ42 oligomers and insoluble Aβ42 fi-
brils prepared in vitro, but not Aβ42 monomers, consistent
with the detection of conformational but not linear epi-
topes. This antibody reactivity might be similar to anti-
bodies generated in response to immunization with DNA
Aβ42 trimer as shown in the present study.
Conclusions
We present data showing for the first time that active
immunization with a DNA plasmid coding for an Aβ tri-
mer (3xAβ1–42) designed to induce an anti-Aβ humoral
immune response in the 3xTg-AD mouse model signifi-
cantly reduced both of the main AD pathologies, amyl-
oid and tau. We show a
significant reduction in
activated protein levels for p44/p44 MAPK (ERK1/2),
the upstream MEK, and GSK3β. Our data support sig-
nificant changes in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling
pathway in AD mouse model brain due to DNA Aβ42
immunotherapy, and this is a goal of further studies.
DNA Aβ42 immunization in patients with AD has the
potential to modify early and late changes in this disease.
It is expected that DNA Aβ42 trimer immunotherapy in
a clinical trial will reduce both plaques and tangles in
patients with AD.
