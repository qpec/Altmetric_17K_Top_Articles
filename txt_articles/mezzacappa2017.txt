IMPORTANCE Several studies have examined the links between prenatal exposure to
antidepressants and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in children, with inconsistent results,
especially regarding the impact of the trimester of exposure.
OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of published
studies to assess the association between ASDs and fetal exposure to antidepressants during
pregnancy for each trimester of pregnancy and preconception.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases up to May 2016 were searched in
June 2016 for observational studies. For the meta-analyses, data were analyzed on RevMan
version 5.2 using a random-effect model. For the review, studies were included if they had been
published and were cohort or case-control studies, and for the meta-analysis, studies were
included if they were published studies and the data were not derived from the same cohorts.
STUDY SELECTION We included all the studies that examined the association between ASDs
and antenatal exposure to antidepressants.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Three reviewers independently screened titles and
abstracts, read full-text articles, and extracted data. The quality of the studies was also assessed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was the association between
antidepressants during pregnancy and ASDs. Secondary outcomes were the associations
between antidepressants in each individual trimester or before pregnancy and ASDs.
RESULTS Our literature search identified 10 relevant studies with inconsistent results. For
prenatal exposure, the meta-analysis on the 6 case-control studies (117 737 patients) evidenced
a positive association between antidepressant exposure and ASDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95%
CI, 1.49-2.20). The association was weaker when controlled for past maternal mental illness
(OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.12). A similar pattern was found whatever the trimester of exposure
considered (first trimester: OR, 2.09, 95% CI,1.66-2.64; second: OR, 2.00, 95% CI, 1.55-2.59;
and third: OR, 1.90, 95% CI, 1.20-3.02. Controlled for past maternal mental illness: first
trimester: OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.27-2.52, second: OR, 1.67, 95% CI, 1.14-2.45; and third: OR, 1.54,
95% CI, 0.82-2.90). No association was found when the 2 cohort studies were pooled (772 331
patients) for the whole pregnancy (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.91-1.74) or for the first trimester.
In addition, preconception exposure to antidepressants was significantly associated with an
increased risk for ASDs (OR controlled for past maternal illness, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.49-2.09).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There is a significant association between increased ASD risk
and maternal use of antidepressants during pregnancy; however, it appears to be more
consistent during the preconception period than during each trimester. Maternal psychiatric
disorders in treatment before pregnancy rather than antenatal exposure to antidepressants
could have a major role in the risk for ASDs. Future studies should address the problem of this
potential confounder.

Pregnant women with untreated depression are at in-
creased risk for poor obstetric follow-up and compli-
cations, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and pre-
eclampsia, and postnatal complications have been mainly
reported.3Theimpactonthechildisalsoofconcern,withapos-
sible increased risk for premature birth and low birth weight.3,4
In addition, depression during pregnancy is the main predic-
tor of postpartum depression,5,6 which is associated with pos-
sible serious impairment in mother-child bonding7 and child
development,8,9 with behavioral problems10,11 and poor scores
on social engagement and emotional regulation.12 Thus, treat-
ment for prenatal depression appears essential for clinicians,
with regard to both the mother and the infant.
Antidepressants are the treatment choice for major de-
pressive disorders in the general population.13,14 Whereas only
2% of pregnant women were treated with antidepressants in
the United States in 1996, more than 5% were receiving treat-
ment by 2013.15 The rate of exposure increased from 0.2% in
1997 to 3.2% in 2010 in Denmark.16 The most commonly pre-
scribed drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs)17knownfortheirsafetyinthegeneralpopulation.Spon-
taneous abortions, congenital malformations (mainly cardiac
defects3), prematurity, and low birth weight have been linked
to antenatal use of antidepressants.18 A protective role of SSRIs
with respect to preterm birth and cesarean delivery has been
also described.19 Neonatal adaptation syndrome and persis-
tent pulmonary hypertension have also been reported, both
being outweighed by the risks of untreated depression.20
Animal in utero exposure to SSRIs has been found to in-
duce long-lasting alterations in brain function and behav-
ioral effects.21,22 The neurodevelopmental role of serotonin in
the fetus has been established23 and the hypothesis of the role
of serotonin in the onset of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)
remains an open question.
First described in 1943, ASDs were reported to affect 1.46%
of American children aged 8 years in 2012.24 Autism spec-
trum disorders are currently considered a multifactorial dis-
order resulting from interactions between genetic and nonge-
netic risk factors.25 Genetic factors have been found in 10% to
20% of individuals with ASDs. The concordance rate is ap-
proximately 70% in monozygotic twins compared with 3% in
dizygotic twins.26 Several genes are thought to be involved.
Advanced parental age, maternal diabetes, abnormal melato-
nin synthesis, zinc deficiency, prenatal viral infection, prena-
tal and perinatal stress, environmental factors, valproate, and
various chemicals have been reported as risk factors.25,27
Morphological brain alterations, biomarkers of oxidative
stress, mitochondrial and porphyrin metabolism dysfunc-
tions,andepigeneticalterationshavealsobeenreportedinASD
populations.28 In addition, blood and platelet serotonin levels
arehighinapproximatelyone-thirdofpatientswithASDs,sug-
gestingtheimplicationofserotonininASDs.Someauthorshave
suggested that increased serotoninergic activity during fetal
brain development may play a part in the onset of ASDs.29,30
Given the plausible links between in-utero serotonin dys-
regulationsandASDs,thequestionoftheimpactofantidepres-
sant antenatal exposure on the occurrence of ASDs is crucial.
Two recent meta-analyses reported a significant associa-
tionbetweenantenatalantidepressantexposureandASDs.31,32
In addition, recent studies have explored the issue of the tri-
mester of exposure, providing contradictory results.33,34
We present here a systematic review of publications and
an up-to-date meta-analysis of studies that have explored as-
sociationsbetweenfetalexposuretoantidepressantsandASDs,
focused first on the specific impact of trimester of exposure
and second on associations between preconception maternal
exposure to antidepressants and ASDs.
Methods
Search Strategies
A systematic literature search was conducted in June 2016
using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases to search for
articles published up to May 2016, using the combination of
terms: antidepressant or antidepressants and pregnancy or fe-
tal exposure and autism, including MeSH terms (whenever
available) found below them in the MeSH hierarchy. Refer-
ences from articles retrieved were also considered. Three re-
viewers (F. Gressier, P.-A.L., and A.M.) conducted indepen-
dent searches to identify potentially relevant articles.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For the review, studies were included if they (1) had been pub-
lished and (2) were cohort or case-control studies that exam-
inedtheassociationbetweenfetalantidepressantexposureand
ASDs. Articles were excluded if they were case or case series re-
ports. The following information was extracted: first author,
publication year, study design, data source, sample size, inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria, potential confounders considered, po-
tential sources of bias, and outcome parameters (hazard ratios
[HRs] and odds ratios [ORs]) and their corresponding 95% CIs.
For the meta-analyses, studies were included if (1) they
were published studies and (2) the data were not derived from
the same cohorts. Studies were excluded if they comprised no
control group.
Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment of the Studies
The quality of the studies included in the meta-analyses was
independently evaluated by the 3 reviewers using the STROBE
statement.35
Key Points
Question Does prenatal antidepressant exposure increase the
risk for autism spectrum disorders?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests an
association between increased autism spectrum disorder risk and
maternal use of antidepressants during pregnancy; however, it
appears to be more consistent during the preconception period
than during each trimester. The association was weaker when
controlled for past maternal mental illness.
Meaning Maternal psychiatric disorders in treatment before
pregnancy rather than antenatal exposure to antidepressants
could have a major role in the risk for autism spectrum disorders.

Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration Re-
view Manager Software (RevMan version 5.3). Both adjusted
andnonadjustedresultsformaternalpsychiatricdisorderswere
considered. For each study, the log HR or OR and their SE were
calculated on the basis of effect measures provided and their
95% CIs, and then entered into RevMan under the “generic in-
verse variance” outcome. A random-effect model, which takes
into account between-study heterogeneity, if present, was
used. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2
test for fit and I2. A funnel plot was produced to evidence any
selective reporting—the preferential publication of statisti-
cally significant results—by plotting the natural logarithms of
individual study effect sizes. Finally, we performed sensitiv-
ity analyses on the trimester of exposure and on preconcep-
tion exposure.
Results
Articles Retrieved
The PubMed database yielded 95 records. No additional rec-
ord was identified from other sources. In all, 12 references
were excluded on the basis of the title and abstract. Twenty-
three full-text articles were assessed for eligibility (Figure 1).
Thirteen were excluded: 3 were literature reviews,36-38 2 were
meta-analyses,31,32 7 were editorial letters or commen-
taries,18,39-44 and 1 analyzed autistic traits.45 Finally, 10 stud-
ies were included in the review: 3 were cohort studies33,46,47
and 7 case-control studies (Table 1).33,34,48-53 Three studies
from Denmark and 2 from Sweden used the same data-
bases.46,47,49,51,52 In addition, 2 from the United States used
the same Partners HealthCare electronic health record over
the same period34,48 but used independent data for a replica-
tion study.34 All studies explored prenatal antidepressant
exposure, but Rai et al51 assessed only antidepressant expo-
sure at the time of the first antenatal interview (median 10
weeks’gestation). Antidepressant exposure was determined
using the available regional prescription databases. Only 1
study50 included both the mother’
s self-report and prenatal
medical record information. Autism spectrum disorders were
determined using the available regional disease registries.
Details of the different studies are provided in the eTable
in the Supplement and Table 1. The quality of the studies was
high (Table 1).
Systematic Review
Boukhris et al33 reported an association between antidepres-
sant exposure during the second and/or third trimester and
ASDs. The association persisted after taking into account ma-
ternal history of depression. The risk was higher with com-
bined treatments (≥2 antidepressant classes).
Results from the 3 studies on Danish population regis-
tries are contrasted.49,51,53 Hviid et al46 showed that ASDs were
associated with antidepressant use 2 years to 6 months be-
fore pregnancy but not with use during pregnancy. In addi-
tion, this study also focused on the use of medication other
than SSRIs during pregnancy: antipsychotic agents and mood
stabilizer drugs were associated with ASDs. Autism spectrum
disorders were also associated with maternal depression;
schizophrenia and neurotic, stress-related, or somatoform dis-
orders; adult personality or behavior disorders; eating disor-
ders; and substance abuse, but they were not associated with
maternal ASDs. Diagnoses were made in a psychiatric hospi-
tal or psychiatric unit.
Exploring the same registries, Sørensen et al47 found a sig-
nificant association between prenatal antidepressant expo-
sure and ASDs. However, this association did not remain sig-
nificant when the analysis was restricted to the children of
women with a diagnosis of affective disorder. These authors
considered the mean dose of antidepressant, and both a low
mean dose and a high mean dose increased the risk for ASDs
(adjusted HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8 and adjusted HR, 1.8; 95%
CI, 1.3-2.4, respectively) compared with nonexposed pa-
tients. When the trimester of pregnancy was considered, ex-
posure during the first trimester was significantly associated
with ASDs, but not exposure during the second and third tri-
mesters only.
Gidaya et al49 also performed an analysis on the same reg-
istries, but via a case-control study. They reported an associa-
tion between ASDs and antidepressant exposure, during over-
all pregnancy and for each trimester, even after adjusting for
history of maternal depression. However, SSRI use and the
prevalence of depression were lower than reported in other
Nordic countries. Assuming a prevalence of depression of 15%,
the authors also estimated depression-stratified from simu-
lation-based sensitivity analysis for nondifferential underre-
porting of SSRIs and depression in the register. The effect did
not remain significant among mothers with depression (OR,
1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.4).
Croen et al53 showed that antidepressant exposure dur-
ing pregnancy and in each trimester was associated with an
increased risk for ASDs. In this study, no association was seen
betweenASDsandahistoryofmaternaldepressionoranyother
mental health disorder.

antidepressant use at the time of the first antenatal interview
(median 10 weeks’gestation) (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.50-7.47). A
similar pattern was reported for SSRIs and nonselective mono-
amine reuptake inhibitors. This association was stronger in
cases of autism without intellectual disability. Further, pre-
natal antidepressant use for psychiatric indications other than
depression was not statistically associated with ASDs in off-
spring. So, the significant association could therefore be due
to depression requiring antidepressants rather than to anti-
depressant exposure. A previous study using the same
database52 reported that antidepressants and the use of other
psychoactive drugs (neuroleptics, sedatives, and sleep-
inducing medications) during pregnancy in mothers of chil-
dren with ASDs were more common than among the mothers
of control participants (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.19-9.05; P < .001 and
OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.5-8.0; P = .003, respectively).
Harrington et al50 reported a highest prevalence of prena-
tal SSRI exposure in ASDs (5.9%) than in typical development
children (3.4%), but with no statistically significant differ-
ence.Amongboys,prenatalSSRIexposurewasassociatedwith
ASDs, the strongest association occurring with first-trimester
exposure. Findings were similar among mothers with an anxi-
ety or mood disorder history.
Clements et al48 included a large number of children with
ASDs (1377 aged 2 to 19 years matched with 4022 control chil-
dren). In models adjusted for sociodemographic features, an-
tidepressant exposure during both the first and second tri-
mesters were associated with a higher risk for ASDs, but this
association was no longer significant when each trimester was
considered and after controlling for history of maternal de-
pression (from electronic medical records). These results sug-
gest that the risk for ASDs observed with prenatal antidepres-
sant exposure is likely to be confounded by the severity of
maternalmentalillness.Finally,antipsychoticprescriptiondur-
ingpregnancywasindependentlyassociatedwithagreaterrisk
for ASDs than antidepressant prescription.
In a replication study,34 1245 children with ASDs (aged 2
to 19 years) were matched with 3405 children without neu-
rodevelopmental disorders (International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision codes of 299, 314, or 317-319). No in-
creased risk for ASDs was reported in children exposed in the
course of pregnancy, nor in each individual trimester, control-
ling for sex, race/ethnicity, birth year, insurance type, me-
dian income tertile, and past maternal depression. Exposure
was identified in electronic health records, which record the
number of pills and the frequency and number of renewals,
enabling the calculation of the exposure period. However, an
association was reported when prepregnancy exposure and
prenatal psychotherapy were considered, suggesting the role
of psychiatric disorders rather than of the medication itself.
Regarding antidepressant exposure and the different tri-
mesters, 8 studies analyzed exposure in each trimester and 1
in the first trimester only.51 For the first trimester, 4 of 9 stud-
ies (1 cohort study47 and 3 case-control studies49,51,53) re-
ported an association (adjusted ORs or HRs, even after adjust-
ment for past psychiatric disorders, all studies except that of
Sørensen et al47). For the second and third trimesters, 2 of 8
studies (1 cohort study that analyzed the second and third tri-
mesters together33 and 1 case-control study49) reported a sig-
nificant association, even after adjusting for history of mater-
naldepression.Thedataanalysisoftrimesterexposureforeach
class of antidepressant is presented in Table 1, showing con-
trasted results.
Five studies searched for an association between antide-
pressant exposure before pregnancy and ASDs.34,46,48,49,53 All
reported a significant association.
No strong association between prenatal antidepressant
exposure during pregnancy and ASDs was found in this
review. The association between antidepressants and ASDs
appears to be more consistent during the preconception
period than during each trimester. Therefore, maternal psy-
chiatric disorders in treatment before pregnancy rather than
prenatal antidepressant exposure could have a major role in
the onset of ASDs.

A summary of all the meta-analyses performed is provided in
Table 2. For exposure during pregnancy, the meta-analysis on
the 6 case-control studies (117 737 patients)34,48-51,53 showed
significant associations between antidepressant exposure
and ASDs (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.49-2.20; I2 = 11%) (Figure 2). The
ORs decreased but remained significant when maternal
history was taken into account (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.12;
I2 = 61%). No association was found when the 2 cohort stud-
ies were pooled33,46 (772 331 patients: HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.91-
1.74; I2 = 67%).
The meta-analysis on the association between first-
trimester exposure and ASDs (6 studies included34,48-51,53)
showed an OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.66-2.64; I2 = 17%) (eFigure 1
intheSupplement).TheassociationwasweakerwhenORsalso
adjusted for past psychiatric disorders were considered (OR,
1.79; 95% CI, 1.27-2.52; I2 = 55%). No significant result was
found for the pooled results of the 2 cohort studies.33,46 Simi-
lar results were observed for the meta-analysis on antide-
pressant exposure during the second trimester (5 studies
included34,48-50,53;eFigure2intheSupplement).Regardingthe
meta-analysis on the exposure during the third trimester (5
studiesincluded34,48-50,53),asignificantassociationwasfound,
but it did not remain significant when ORs adjusted for past
depression were included, with heterogeneity across the study
results (I2 = 73%) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Four studies were included in the meta-analyses on pre-
conception exposure34,48,49,53 (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Both reported a significant association (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.65-
2.32 and adjusting for past depression, OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.49-
2.09),withnoheterogeneitybetweenstudies(I2 = 0%).Ameta-
analysis on results for the whole pregnancy including the same
4 studies showed the following: OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.30-2.24;
I2 = 36% and OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.94-2.19; I2 = 69%, respec-
tively (data not shown).
Discussion
Results from recent studies have suggested an increased risk
for ASDs in children exposed to antidepressants in utero.

These results have been widely reported by the media as a
causal link underpinning incentives to discontinue antide-
pressants during pregnancy. A number of letters has been
published in an attempt to address and mitigate this mis-
interpretation33 and especially to draw attention to the poten-
tially harmful effects of discontinuing antidepressants in
pregnant women. Indeed, inadequately treated prenatal
depression can lead to adverse obstetrical and developmental
issues, bearing also in mind the risk for maternal suicide. Nev-
ertheless, clinicians are increasingly faced with the question

of prescriptions to women wishing to quit their treatment
during the perinatal period.
Based on our meta-analyses, there is a significant asso-
ciation between ASDs and prenatal maternal use of antide-
pressants. However, it appears to be more consistent during
prepregnancy than each trimester. The association was weaker
when controlled for past maternal mental illness. It is also in-
teresting to note that the study with the highest weight49 re-
ported results that contrasted with those of other studies on
thesamepopulation.46,47Furthermore,whentheresultsofthe
2 cohort studies were pooled, no association was found. Two
meta-analyses on SSRI prenatal exposure and ASDs pub-
lishedrecentlyunderlinedtheroleofmaternalpsychiatriccon-
dition as a major confounding factor.54,55
The public health implications of the possible risk for
ASDs as a result of antidepressant exposure during preg-
nancy are difficult to assert or to refute, especially as we
also observed an association with preconception exposure.
The increased risk for ASDs in children exposed in utero
could well be related to maternal depression or other psy-
chiatric disorders rather than to antidepressant medications
per se.
Limitations
Nevertheless, this review has some major limitations: (1) the
small number of eligible studies in the literature; (2) the con-
flicting results of some studies, evidenced by marked hetero-
geneity in the meta-analysis on the adjustment for maternal
history; and (3) the possibility of a publication bias. Some stud-
ies may not have been published because of a lack of results;
however,thelargeregistry-basedstudiesshouldnothavebeen
affected by this phenomenon.
Several biases should be mentioned concerning the
published studies. First, apart from 1 study,50 the studies in-
cluded in our meta-analyses did not adopt a classic case-
control design but were based on population registries. In fact,
potentialconfoundingeffectsforASDdetectionshouldbemen-
tioned, especially the fact that children with prenatal antide-
pressant exposure are possibly more likely to have a higher fre-
quency of pediatric and psychiatric consultations compared
with nonexposed children, which could lead to a higher rate
of ASD detection. Second, most of the studies defined antide-
pressant exposure for 1 trimester even if the medication ex-
posure overlapped other trimesters. Only 1 study49 assessed
the duration of exposure for each trimester separately and di-
chotomized duration into 2 categories: use between 1 and 45
days and use for more than 45 days. In addition, 1 study ana-
lyzing prepregnancy exposure considered exposure 2 years to
6 months before pregnancy but not during pregnancy.46 Third,
antidepressant exposure in most of the studies was ascer-
tained from prescription databases. Analyses were carried out
on the basis that women had received 1 antidepressant pre-
scription. This does not provide any information as to whether
the women actually took the treatments prescribed during
pregnancy. Fourth, most studies considered maternal depres-
sive history but not current depression during pregnancy. Sev-
eral studies also reported that a history of depression was as-
sociated with an increased risk for ASDs in children. The effect
of maternal depression in itself may be an important con-
founder. Depression and ASDs have been reported to share risk
factors.42 Genetic overlap has been found,56 and a family his-
tory of depression has been associated with the risk for ASDs.57
Most of the studies considered did not search for autistic traits
in the parents. Whereas environmental factors may be influ-
ential, the preeminent causes of autism are genetic.58 Fifth,
the indication for the prescription of antidepressants during
pregnancy was often missing and the severity of depression
was not reported in most studies. Pregnant women who take
antidepressants are more likely to have severe depressive dis-
orders than women with less severe depression who often
stop taking their antidepressants before pregnancy.59 Most
women using antidepressants during pregnancy are taking
maintenance therapy to prevent a possible relapse.45 The
combination of 2 antidepressants seems to increase the risk
for ASDs,33 as does the use of psychotropic drugs other than
antidepressants.48 The use of other psychotropic drugs could
explain part of the association, but only 1 study considered
this possible confounding factor.52 All these points suggest
the importance of maternal psychiatric disorders in the
occurrence of autistic traits in children. Last, accounting for
exposures other than prescribed medications, including
tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, is missing in most of the
studies. The risks for ASDs could increase in the offspring of
mothers who used these substances in addition to antide-
pressants.
Strengths
This article also has certain strengths: (1) its multiple-study
approach, based on a systematic literature review comple-
mented with meta-analyses; (2) sensitivity meta-analyses; and
(3) the evaluation of the quality of the studies included.
The prevention of depression during pregnancy is an
important goal. Previous studies reporting an association
between fetal antidepressant exposure and ASDs are not suf-
ficient to warrant a discontinuation or avoidance of prescrip-
tion of antidepressants during pregnancy. Clinicians should
always balance the risks of maternal depression against the
potential neurodevelopmental risks of antidepressant expo-
sure for the fetus. Each prescription should be evaluated
individually. Nevertheless, the risk of untreated depression
during pregnancy is considerable. Thus, it seems advisable to
reserve psychotropic treatments for women with severe
major depression and to promote psychological approaches
for others.
Conclusions
Future studies, comprising an assessment of diagnoses, se-
verity of illness, and treatments at different stages in preg-
nancy and substance abuse, are needed and could help dis-
entangle the role of the mother’
s psychiatric condition and
psychotropic drug use in the risk for ASDs. Further detailed
observational data to address these confounding factors are
required to investigate the association between antidepres-
sant exposure and ASDs.
