INTRODUCTION:Alongwithitswell-documented
roleasatrackforcargotransport,themicrotubule
(MT) cytoskeleton is linked to diverse structural
and signaling roles in the
cardiac myocyte. MTs can
facilitate the rapid trans-
mission of mechanical sig-
nalstointracellulareffectors,
a process termed mechano-
transduction.Aproliferated
MT network may also provide a mechanical
resistance to cardiac contraction in certain dis-
ease states. Yet our understanding of how MTs
resist compression and transmit mechanical
signals has been impaired by a lack of direct
observation and by the unpredictable effects
of blunt pharmacological tools.
RATIONALE: Direct observation of MT me-
chanical behavior during contraction is the most
straightforward way to elucidate the mech-
anisms underlying MT contributions to heart
function. Advances in imaging have made this
possible at temporal and spatial resolutions
that permit quantification of MT geometry dur-
ing the contraction cycle. Furthermore, recent
evidence suggests that posttranslational mod-
ification of the microtubule network, specifically
“detyrosination,” regulates cardiac mechano-
transduction. This raises the question of whether
detyrosination alters how microtubules respond
to the changing mechanical loads inherent to
each cardiac cycle. To answer these questions,
we used advanced imaging techniques to explore
MT behavior in beating murine cardiomyocytes.
RESULTS: During contraction, MTs must some-
how accommodate the changing geometry of
the myocyte. In a typical myocyte, this was
accomplished by deforming into a sinusoidal
buckled configuration that returned to an identi-
cal resting configuration after each beat. The
periodic nature of these buckles coincided with
the repeating contractile units of the cardiomyo-
cyte known as sarcomeres, which suggested a
directinteraction.Desminintermediatefilaments
were identified as a key component of an an-
choring complex that links MTs to the sarcomere
and imparts structural organization to the MT
network.
The physical link between microtubules and
the sarcomere was highly dependent on detyro-
sination. In myocytes where detyrosination was
suppressed, MTs often accommodated the con-
traction by sliding past each other rather than
bucklingas thesarcomere shortened. Disrupting
the MT-sarcomere interaction allowed
the sarcomere to shorten farther and
faster, as well as decreased overall stiff-
ness. Conversely, promoting detyrosina-
tion was sufficient to increase myocyte
stiffness and impede the contraction of
the myocyte. Consistently, clinical data
showed a direct correlation between
excess detyrosination and functional
decline in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
CONCLUSION: Thus, microtubules can
provide mechanical resistance to the
myocyte through interactions with the
sarcomere, forming load-bearing spring
elements in parallel with the contractile
apparatus. These interactions are medi-
ated by a detyrosination-dependent as-
sociation with desmin that regulates
myocyte stiffness and contractility. Ex-
cess detyrosination promotes the inter-
action between MTs and the sarcomere,
which increases resistance to contrac-
tion and may contribute to reductions
in cardiac function in certain disease
states.▪

MTs in the beating heart. When a cardiomyocyte (A) is compressed (B), as occurs during systolic con-
traction, MT
s buckle under load. In a typical myocyte (C), detyrosinated MT
s are mechanically coupled to the
sarcomere and buckle during contraction (D). When detyrosination is reduced (E), this interaction is
disrupted and MT
s buckle less, which allows sarcomeres to shorten and stretch with less resistance.

The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton can transmit mechanical signals and resist
compression in contracting cardiomyocytes. How MTs perform these roles remains unclear
because of difficulties in observing MTs during the rapid contractile cycle. Here, we used
high spatial and temporal resolution imaging to characterize MT behavior in beating mouse
myocytes. MTs deformed under contractile load into sinusoidal buckles, a behavior
dependent on posttranslational “detyrosination” of a-tubulin. Detyrosinated MTs
associated with desmin at force-generating sarcomeres. When detyrosination was reduced,
MTs uncoupled from sarcomeres and buckled less during contraction, which allowed
sarcomeres to shorten and stretch with less resistance. Conversely, increased
detyrosination promoted MT buckling, stiffened the myocyte, and correlated with impaired
function in cardiomyopathy. Thus, detyrosinated MTs represent tunable, compression-
resistant elements that may impair cardiac function in disease.
A
long with its well-defined transport func-
tions, the microtubule (MT) network serves
multiple mechanical roles in the beating
cardiomyocyte. MTs function as mechano-
transducers, converting changing contract-
ile forces into intracellular signals (1, 2). MTs may
also act as compression-resistant elements, which
could provide a mechanical impediment to cardio-
myocyte contraction (3–5). If so, they must bear
some of the compressive and tensile load of a
working myocyte. Unfortunately, little is known
about MT behavior during the contractile cycle.
During this cycle, Ca2+-mediated actin-myosin
interaction first shortens repeating contractile
units called sarcomeres, which are then stretched
as the heart fills with blood during diastole.
Although an isolated MT would present minimal
resistance to myocyte compression, the stiffness
of the network within a living cell, with MT-
associated proteins and other cytoskeletal ele-
ments, can change by orders of magnitude (6, 7).
It is in this context that MTs are proposed to act
as compression-resistant elements (6, 8) that may
impair sarcomere shortening and thus cardiac
function, particularly in disease states associated
with MT proliferation (8–10). Posttranslational
modification (PTM) of MTs (11, 12) could also
modify their mechanical properties and binding
interactions. Detyrosination, a PTM of a-tubulin,
has recentlybeenshowntoaugmentMT-dependent
mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and
skeletal muscle (12). This specific PTM is also in-
creasedinanimal models of heartdisease (1, 13, 14),
which raises a mechanistic question: If mechano-
signaling is altered, have the mechanical properties
of the myocyte changed?
Although the idea that a proliferated (and per-
haps modified) MT network may mechanically
interfere with contraction is attractive, the “MT
hypothesis” has remained controversial [for re-
views, see (15, 16)]. Two important limitations
have hindered our understanding: (i) a reliance
on blunt pharmacological tools (colchicine/Taxol)
that have off-target consequences; (ii) a lack of
direct observation of MTs under the stress and
strain of the contractile cycle. Here, we charac-
terized MTs under contractile loads using a
high-resolution imaging technique and directly
tested how MT detyrosination may regulate
load-bearing and the mechanical properties of
the myocyte.
MTs buckle under contractile load
MT networks in cardiomyocytes have two major
features (Fig. 1A): an orthogonal grid just beneath
the membrane that wraps the myofibrils and a
deeper network composed primarily of longitu-
dinal elements that interdigitate the myofibrils.
Longitudinal MTs often run many sarcomeres in
length but do not span the full cell. Given that
cardiomyocytes change shape during contraction,
the MT cytoskeleton must accommodate this
change. There are three apparent possibilities:
MTs not anchored to other cytoskeletal or sarco-
meric proteins could rearrange or slide passively
with the surrounding medium; anchored MTs
could directly experience contractile force and
themselves deform under load; or the MTs could
break and/or disassemble and reform. These pos-
sibilities offer divergent mechanisms for the reg-
ulation of mechano-signaling and the overall
mechanics of the myocyte. Without direct obser-
vation, however, this behavior has been difficult
to quantify.
Standard confocal imaging, although capable
of resolving MTs in living cells (17), suffers from
limitations in the signal-to-noise ratio when
pushed to speeds that can resolve events on the
time scale of cardiomyocyte contraction (Fig. 1B
and movie S1). Consequently, we turned to a high-
speed, subdiffraction limit technique called Airy-
scan (see fig. S1). This technology maintains high
signal-to-noise ratios at the required temporal
resolution, while offering a 1.7-fold improvement
in spatial resolution beyond the standard diffrac-
tion limit.
Using the MT-binding fluorogenic dye SiR tu-
bulin, based on the fluorophore silicon rhodamine
(18) (Fig. 1C and movie S2), we imaged internal
MTs during contractions triggered by a 1 Hz elec-
trical field stimulation in isolated mouse cardio-
myocytes. We were able to capture MT behavior
during contraction and found that longitudinally
oriented MTs frequently deformed and developed
sinusoidal buckles. Because SiR tubulin may poly-
merize MTs (18), we also generated adenovirus
encoding a small fragment of the MT-binding pro-
tein ensconsin fused to three copies of GFP (EMTB-
3xGFP) to decorate MTs. We achieved similar
results (table S1) but with improved signal-to-
noise ratios (Fig. 1D and movie S3).
We measured blindly selected MTs for deforma-
tion with two parameters—amplitude and wave-
length (Fig. 1G). Where possible, the same MT was
followed through contraction. Amplitude rose
quickly from resting to contracted levels (Fig. 1H),
with clearly visible buckles. Using a threshold of
two standard deviations above resting amplitude,
we found that two-thirds of MTs buckle under
control conditions (Fig. 1H).
MT buckles quickly reversed during relaxation,
and the configuration of the MT network between
contractions tightly colocalized with the network
configuration from previous cycles (Fig. 1, E and
F), with a minimal mean reduction in Pearson’s
colocalization of 0.01 per contractile cycle (n =
18 runs). The rapid and precise reversibility of the
network deformations suggested tight coupling
to the contractile apparatus, and it argues against
MT breakage and regrowth contributing to me-
chanical properties and signaling over the time
scale of myocyte contraction.
A notable feature of the MT buckles was the
emergence of subpopulationsof buckle wavelength
centered at ~1.65 mm, 3.3 mm, and perhaps even
4.7 mm (Fig. 1I). These corresponded closely to the
length of one, two, or three contracted sarcomeres,
respectively. Although MTs buckling outside of
these populations could be found in our data with-
out difficulty, these subpopulations were strongly

cells where faint transverse staining at the Z-disc
shows MTs buckling between sarcomeric con-
straints (movie S4).
Detyrosination regulates MT buckling in
the heart
This robust buckling behavior of the MT network
may be a result of a particularly high abundance
of “detyrosinated” MTs in adult cardiomyocytes
(19). Detyrosination is a PTM of a-tubulin where
the C-terminal tyrosine residue has been cleaved
by a tubulin carboxypeptidase (TCP); this process
can be readily reversed by tubulin tyrosine ligase
(TTL) (11). This tyrosination cycle is evolutionar-
ily conserved across eukaryotes (20) and appears
required for life (21), yet its functional roles are
still poorly understood. Because detyrosination
can protect MTs from disassembly (22, 23) and
can facilitate their cross-linking with intermediate
filaments (IFs) (24, 25), we hypothesized that the
high proportion of detyrosination may confer the
resilient load-bearing capabilities of the cardiac
cytoskeletal network.
Using antibodies specific to detyrosinated a-
tubulin, we found a high abundance of detyrosi-
nation in the a-tubulin network of adult myocytes
(Fig. 2, A and B), as expected (12, 19). To test the
role of detyrosinated MTs, we generated adeno-
virus encoding TTL (AdV-TTL) with a Discosoma
red fluorescent protein (DsRed) reporter. Express-
ing this construct in isolated cardiomyocytes
could effectively reduce the level of detyrosina-
tion as shown by both immunofluorescence (Fig.
2, A and B) and immunoblot (Fig. 2, C and D),
which resulted in a 71% reduction in the amount
of polymerized, detyrosinated MTs, with a con-
comitant up-regulation of tyrosinated tubulin
(Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S2). Overexpression of
TTL also resulted in a modest (10%) reduction in
the density of the polymerized MT network (Fig.
2B), consistent with an increased disassembly of
tyrosinated MTs (22, 23). We complemented this
genetic strategy with a pharmacological approach
to inhibit TCP using parthenolide (PTL) (26). PTL
treatment also reduced the fraction of detyrosi-
nated MTs, albeit to a lesser extent (42%) than

 AdV-TTL and with no effect on MT network
density (fig. S2).
The load-bearing behavior of the MT network
in cardiomyocytes overexpressing TTL or treated
with PTL was dramatically different from control
myocytes. Tyrosinated MTs frequently seemed to
simply slide in the moving cell (Fig. 2, E and F,
orange arrows; movies S5 and S6; and fig. S3),
rather than buckling under load. This behavior
was again reversible, with a minimum reduction
in Pearson’s colocalization over successive con-
tractions that was not different from controls
(P = 0.87, n = 19 runs). The occurrence of buckling
in TTL-overexpressing and PTL-treated cells fell
significantly (Fig. 2G, left), whereas amplitude
changes observed on the same MT between rest
and contraction also dropped significantly (Fig.
2G, right, and table S1).

 When MT buckling was observed, the mean
wavelength was not significantly different between
control and TTL-overexpressing cells (table S1).
However,themajorityofMTsinTTL-overexpressing
myocytes no longer buckled at the wavelength of
a single sarcomere, and no subpopulations at
multiples of the sarcomeric period were observed
(Fig. 2H). Instead, the majority of these MTs
buckled in a single population at wavelengths
between 2 and 3 mm, which suggested that MT
buckling was less constrained by a sarcomeric
interaction after detyrosination was reduced
(Fig. 2I).
Detyrosinated MTs resist
contractile compression
The energy required to deform detyrosinated MTs
under compressive load could confer some mean-
ingful resistance to myocyte contraction. We thus
tested directly if MT detyrosination affects contrac-
tilityinbeatingcardiomyocytes.Afteroverexpression
of TTL, we found significant enhancements in
both the magnitude (Fig. 3, A to C) and peak rate
(Fig. 3, D and E) of sarcomere shortening (table
S2). PTL had a similar effect on contractility (Fig.
3F and table S2). Peak relaxation rates were also
increased, which could be because of a decrease
in cellular viscosity (see below) or may reflect the
increased magnitude of shortening and, there-
fore, compression of internal elastic elements
(e.g., titin) that develop restoring force (27). These
contractile changes were not associated with
any significant difference in global calcium tran-
sients (Fig. 3, G to I) or resting sarcomere length
(Fig. 3C), which suggested a change in intrin-
sic mechanical resistance associated with the
ability of detyrosinated MTs to bear compres-
sive load.
Detyrosination regulates myocyte
mechanical properties
We next measured mechanical resistance directly
using atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM mea-
surements of transverse stiffness were performed
across a range of indentation rates. Myocyte stiff-
ness changed substantially with indentation rate
and was well fit by a standard linear solid model
(SLSM)[methods insupplementary materials (SM)]
(fig. S4 and Fig. 4A). At low rates (100 nm/s), the
stiffness of the cardiomyocyte was essentially elas-
tic, reported as E1, and was reduced by PTL treat-
ment and TTL overexpression (Fig. 4B). At higher
rates, the modulus increased by E2, which reflects
cross-linked material inside the cell that slips on
the time scale of slower measurements but “turns
on” (stiffens) at faster time scales (> 2 mm/s) (28).
The viscosity derived by the SLSM defines the
rate above which these cross-links are engaged.
TTL overexpression significantly decreased E2 and
viscosity (Fig. 4B), which suggested that reducing
detyrosination decreases the number of cross-
links engaged at physiological strain rates in the
cardiomyocyte.
The fact that MTs deform under load and re-
sist sarcomere shortening implies a transfer of
force between MTs and the sarcomere. If MTs
resist longitudinal compression, they could also
confer a tensile resistance when the sarcomeres
are stretched, as occurs during diastolic filling. To
test this idea, we measured passive stiffness direct-
lyalongthelongitudinalaxisof TTL-overexpressing
myocytes. We attached cardiomyocytes to laser-
etched cell holders (Fig. 4C, fig. S5, and movie S7)
via a biological adhesive (1) and subjected them
to steplike changes in length, while simultaneously
measuring sarcomere length and passive force
with a high-sensitivity transducer (Fig. 4D). A typ-
ical force response (Fig. 4D, blue) showed a rapid
rise to peak force during the high-velocity stretch
(Fpeak), containing both elastic and viscous ele-
ments, followed by a relaxation to a steady-state
force (Fs.s.) that largely reflects the elastic stiff-
ness of the myocyte. For a given step size, TTL-
overexpressing myocytes exerted significantly
reduced peak forces during physiological length
changes, with modest reductions in steady-state
force (fig. S5F). The TTL-overexpressing cells also
underwent significantly larger changes in sarco-
mere length with any given step (fig. S5G), which
indicated increased sarcomere compliance and
which suggested that stiffer sarcomeres in con-
trol cells distribute the length change to other
compliant components in series. As can be sur-
mised from fig. S5, F and G, TTL overexpression
decreased tension across the physiological range
of sarcomere lengths achieved during diastolic
filling (Fig. 4E), which indicated a role for de-
tyrosinated MTs as tensile-resistant elements.
Visual evidence supporting such a relation was
seen in MT networks in a control cell at resting
and stretched length (fig. S5 and Fig. 4C, cyan).
At resting length, there was some inherent slack in
the MT network, whereas the same MTs became

Model of MT contribution to
cardiac contractility
We next sought to develop a mathematical mod-
el to recapitulate the experimentally measured
changes in MT buckling and contractility when
detyrosination is reduced. Previous work mod-
eling MT buckles (6) suggests that three critical
variables determine buckling behavior; MT stiff-
ness, stiffness of the surrounding medium, and
force incident on the long axis of the MT. How
these three variables are predicted to alter MT
behavior and myocyte mechanics is described in
fig. S6. Of the three, only a decrease in incident
force can explain our experimental observations
after suppressing detyrosination. If MT anchor-
ing to the sarcomere is disrupted, the reduced
incident force on the MT may drop below the
critical force required for buckling, which results
in simultaneous decreases in buckling amplitude
(Fig. 2) and viscoelasticity (Figs. 3 and 4). The
sarcomeric periodicity of buckles (Fig. 1I) also
suggests an underlying structural constraint that
changes in MT or medium stiffness alone cannot
explain. We thus chose to model MT buckling
within a contractile model that includes a MT
compression-resistive element that’s interaction
with the sarcomere can be varied (see model in
SM for details).
Using the mechanical scheme detailed in
Fig. 5A, we fitted the contraction resulting from a
log-normal force input to derive both contractile
and buckling parameters. By modifying the in-
cident force applied to a MT for a given amount
of sarcomere shortening (Fig. 5A and model in
SM), we simulated the effect of a sarcomeric an-
chor sliding and then catching at detyrosinated
regions of the MT. Inclusion of a 100-nm slide
(50 nm at each anchor, see model) before MTs
engage with the rest of the sarcomere is rea-
sonable, given the ~80% reduction in detyrosi-
nated area observed by immunofluorescence
with TTL overexpression (Fig. 2C), and reflects
the fact that reductions in detyrosination would
increase the average distance between detyrosi-
nated tubulins that could interact strongly with
MT anchoring points. This disruption of MT-
sarcomere coupling produced model outputs (Fig.
5, C and D) that closely recapitulated our experi-
mental contractility and buckling results.
An alternate possibility to the sliding anchor is
that the anchor is completely uncoupled by sup-
pressing detyrosination and reverts to buckling
behavior governed by local viscoelasticity rather
than underlying structure, as proposed for less
rigidly organized cell types, including developing
myocytes (6). In either case, the coupling of MTs
to the sarcomere is reduced, which impairs their
ability to resist contraction.
Potential role for desmin as a
sarcomeric MT anchor
The putative characteristics of the anchor—a me-
chanically stiff protein capable of forming complexes
with MTs and restricted to a spatially defined
region of the sarcomere—suggested the interme-
diate filament desmin as an immediate candidate.

 Desmin forms structural bundles that form a
complex with the Z-disc (29), and intermediate
filaments can form detyrosination-dependent
cross-links with MTs (30, 31).
We first sought to determine whether desmin
preferentially associates with detyrosinated MTs.
Cosedimentation of cardiomyocyte lysates showed
that desmin forms pellets with polymerized MTs
(Fig. 6A) in direct proportion to their level of
detyrosination (Fig. 6, B and C), which indicated
a specific and sensitive interaction. We also co-
stained cardiomyocytes from desmin-depleted
[knockout (KO)] and wild-type (WT) mice for
desmin and both tyrosinated and detyrosinated
tubulin to observe any preferential interaction.
The two populations of MTs show similar overall
patterning in WT myocytes, except for a specific
accumulation of detyrosinated (and not tyrosi-
nated) tubulin in transverse bands at the Z-disc
that colocalized with desmin (Fig. 6, D and E,
and fig. S7). Note that KO animals lacked this
transverse pattern completely (Fig. 6D and fig.
S7H), although the Z-disc itself remained intact
(fig. S7C). In addition, KO myocytes had a denser
(fig. S7F) and more disorganized MT network
(Fig. 6D and fig. S7, B and E), which suggested
that desmin is required for proper MT network
organization.
If desmin cross-links with detyrosinated MTs
to structurally reinforce the network, then the
removal of desmin should both decrease cyto-
skeletal stiffness and prevent tyrosination-
dependent changes in viscoelasticity. Blind studies
in WT and KO myocytes revealed that desmin
KO myocytes were significantly less stiff than WT
counterparts (Fig. 6, F and G), and that treatment
with PTL no longer reduced viscoelasticity (Fig. 6,
F and G).
MT detyrosination is sufficient to impair
cardiomyocyte contractility
Increasing detyrosination correlates with impaired
function in animal models of heart disease (13, 14).
Thus, we next tested whether increasing detyr-
osinationcould directly impair cardiac contractility.

 Using an adenoviral construct expressing short
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against TTL (shTTL), we
suppressed TTL expression, which enhanced
detyrosination (Fig. 7A and fig. S8). shTTL-
transduced myocytes were then tested for their
viscoelastic and contractile properties. The ex-
cess detyrosination alone was sufficient to in-
crease viscosity and stiffness (Fig. 7, B and C)
and suppressed contractile velocity and mag-

We next examined whether this modification
correlated with functional deficits in human heart

from patients exhibiting varying degrees of heart

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate a regulatory pathway
for MT load–bearing and myocyte mechanics
through posttranslational detyrosination of tu-
bulin. Detyrosinated MTs buckle under load in
contracting cardiomyocytes, which confers mechan-
ical resistance to contraction and regulating the
viscoelastic properties of the myocyte.
The observation that MTs normally buckle,
rather than break or slide, strongly indicates that
they bear load and store elastic bending energy
during the cardiac contractile cycle. This has im-
plications for MT-dependent mechano-signaling
in muscle and other tissues (1, 32, 33) but also
has direct implications for contractility. Our mod-
el of myocyte contractility demonstrates how
changing MT load–bearing and force transfer
with the sarcomeres can substantially alter con-
tractile properties. Our experimental data show
that such changes in MT load–bearing can be
achieved by posttranslational modifications of
the MTs themselves, particularly detyrosination.
The measured reductions in buckling and visco-
elasticity and the increase in contractile speed of
PTL-treated, TTL-overexpressing myocytes can
all be attributed to changing the way MTs in-
teract with the sarcomere and impairing their
ability to act as compression resistors. It is also
possible that detyrosinated MTs anchored to one
sarcomere form bundles with MTs anchored to
adjacent sarcomeres. If so, disrupting bundling
would also effectively uncouple MTs from force-
generating structures. Regardless of the mecha-
nism, disrupting coupling to sarcomeres would
reduce the incident force on the MT, and buckling
occurrence would drop.
The striking periodicity of buckles in untreated
myocytes lends further support to the idea of a
sarcomeric anchor. The preferential association of
desmin with detyrosinated tubulin and the insen-
sitivity of desmin KO animals to changes in de-
tyrosination strongly implicates desmin as at least
one component of a sarcomeric anchoring com-
plex of detyrosinated MTs. Note that myocytes
lacking desmin have decreased viscoelasticity,
despite a denser MT network, which supports
the idea that MT network organization and cross-
linking is a stronger determinant of myocyte me-
chanical properties than network density per se.
Both the desmin and MT networks have ele-
ments perpendicular to their typical orientation,
particularly near the sarcolemma, which may
alter how those elements interact with the cyto-
skeleton and plasma membrane. However, we
believe that the preponderance of the contractile
resistance that results from detyrosination is due
to longitudinal MTs in an orthogonal grid with
transverse desmin IFs because of the simple nu-
merical majority of cytoskeletal elements in this
configuration.
Despite the fact that detyrosinated MTs store
energy during sarcomere contraction, which pro-
vides compression resistance, little of this energy
appears to return in the form of a restoring force
that would quicken sarcomere extension. This
implies that energy used to deform MTs under-
goes substantial loss. Buckling of the MT exerts
compressive force on the surrounding matrix and
deforms the cytoplasm, which, due to its intrinsic
viscosity, can act as an energy sink during each
cycle. This is reflected in the large viscous com-
ponent of the MT contributions to myocyte me-
chanical properties observed at deformation rates
consistent with contractile velocities both in this
and previous work (34). However, we do note a
slight prolongation of the late phase of relaxation
in TTL-overexpressing myocytes, which may rep-
resent the loss of a MT contribution to restoring
force. We consider it probable that the restoring
force of other internal elastic elements, such as
titin, are likely to play a more dominant role, at
least in the initial return toward resting sarco-
mere length (27). Thus, an increase in detyrosina-
tion may increase myocyte stiffness and impair
contraction by acting as an energy sink, without
providing significant energetic return during
relaxation.
Consistent with this, an increase in detyrosi-
nation was associated with clinical contractile
dysfunction in human hearts. Our cellular studies
demonstrate that acute reduction of detyrosina-
tion with genetic or pharmacologic approaches
can boost contractility and reduce mechanical
stiffness. Additionally, these approaches are
able to induce large changes in detyrosination,
while only slightly altering the overall MT cyto-
skeleton,whichminimizesoff-targetconsequences.
Thus, interfering with detyrosination may repre-
sent an attractive and novel therapeutic strategy
for increasing contractility.
In conclusion, our data show that MTs exhibit
divergent mechanical behavior because of the
differences in how they couple to the rest of the
cardiac cytoskeleton. The tyrosinated portions of
the network, moving readily with the myocyte
during contraction, provide little contractile re-
sistance. Conversely, the detyrosinated portions
of the MT network, forming complexes with des-
min IFs, produce a cross-linked MT-IF network
that confers robust resistance to contraction. This
orthogonal MT-IF grid requires tightly periodic
MT deformations to accommodate myocyte mor-
phology changes during contraction. These defor-
mations require a considerable amount of energy
to form and dissipate a large fraction of that en-
ergy due to viscous interactions. This has im-
portant implications for MT load–bearing across
cell biology, as well as for the altered mechanical
stiffness and mechano-signaling in cardiac disease.
