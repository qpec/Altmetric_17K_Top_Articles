Abstract
Cardiovascular factors among uninjured active adult recreational scuba divers in the USA are described. Scuba diving as
an activity was included in 2011, 2013, and 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. One-third of active US
scuba divers were aged �50 years and/or reported prior high cholesterol, around half were overweight, more than half
reported having smoked cigarettes, and 32% reported hypertension or borderline hypertension. High cholesterol,
hypertension, high body mass index, and smoking status should all be addressed during routine diving fitness physician
assessments, to reduce the risk of mortality while diving.

Introduction
Scuba diving is a popular recreational pursuit enjoyed
by millions of US divers.1 It is estimated around 1.1%
of residents scuba dive each year. Annually, in the USA
around 80 scuba divers die and 1400 present at US
emergency departments.1 The mean age of US recre-
ational diving fatalities has increased steadily over the
last 25 years.2,3 Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs)
are now implicated in a large proportion of deaths
and injuries among US recreational divers.4 The aim
of this study is to describe CVRFs among active
adult recreational scuba divers in the USA.
Methods
The
Behavioral
Risk
Factor
Surveillance
System
(BRFSS) is a telephone-based survey of non-institutio-
nalized adults in the USA and US Territories.5–7 Every
second year a survey module investigates patterns of
physical activity and exercise. The pertinent BRFSS
survey questions are:
. During the past month, other than your regular job,
did you participate in any physical activities or exer-
cises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening,
or walking for exercise?
. What type of physical activity or exercise did you
spend the most time doing during the past month?
. What other type of physical activity gave you the
next most exercise during the past month?
Scuba diving as an activity was included in 2011,
2013, and 2015 surveys.5–7 BRFSS data are weighted
using an iterative raking method, de-identified and
made
available
through
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control and Prevention, therefore the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the Divers Alert Network
ruled this study exempt from requiring approval
(letter available on request). SAS version 9.4 was used
for the analysis. Before combining the three years
of data, annual weights were adjusted proportionally
to each year’s contribution to the combined dataset,
as previously described.8 All data reported by this
study are national estimates, generated by summing

 the adjusted annual weights.9 We believe this appropri-
ate where:
. the sample is as small as it is for divers,
. the divers are distributed across the USA,
. the minimum cell size �50.
A comparison group of active participants with a
ratio of three per diver (actual participants, not
weighted estimates) was selected. This group were
active in activities other than diving and were matched
to the divers on survey year, age (five-year bin), sex,
and state of residence. Relative risks were calculated
with exact confidence intervals, as recommended for
small sample sizes.10
Results
Combined proportionally adjusted 2011, 2013, and
2015 BRFSS surveys gave a national estimate of
735,750,527 persons. Of those, 497,733,757 (68%)
were reportedly active in the previous month and
113,892 (0.02%) indicated the activity they had been
most, or next most, active in was scuba diving.
The comparison group, matched on age, sex, and
state of residence, equated to a national sample of
338,933 people who considered themselves to have
been active during the previous month, mostly (and
next mostly) in an activity that was not scuba diving.
Both
age
groups
and
sex
variables
contained
<50 unweighted count in at least one cell (e.g.
<50 female divers), therefore these distributions are
not reported at the individual class level. Florida and
California accounted for 34% of active divers. Median
frequency of scuba diving was once per week. Mean
duration engaged in scuba diving was two hours.
Mean body mass index (BMI) among the divers was
26.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.5–26.7) and
among
the
non-divers
27.3
(95%
CI
26.8–27.7,
p < 0.0001). Among the divers mean age-sex estimated
VO2max
was
35.2 ml/kg/min.
The
great
majority,
(>90%) reported no history of coronary heart disease,
heart attack, stroke, asthma, any forms of cancer,
kidney disease, diabetes, or depressive disorders. The
majority (78%) of divers reported having some form
of healthcare coverage. Prior diagnosis of high choles-
terol (Table 1) was reported in 30% of divers and the
control group, and around one-third of both groups
were aged 50 years or older.
Discussion
One-third of active US adult scuba divers in this
BHFSS sample were �50 years old. A greater propor-
tion of divers had smoked at some point but, compared
with the control group, a greater proportion had given
up smoking. Divers were more frequently overweight
but had lower mean BMI overall than the control
group. There was no relative difference in hypertension
or high cholesterol diagnoses, though around one-third
of divers reported either or both conditions.
Scuba diving is a geographically concentrated sport
confined to locations with access to popular dive sites
and, therefore, the BRFSS may not accurately reflect

 the true distribution of US active divers. Active divers
were, however, distributed across 44 US states and ter-
ritories, with Florida and California accounting for
34% of all divers, which is also in keeping with US
recreational diving fatalities.3,4 Diving activity in the
USA peaks during summer and the survey was con-
ducted throughout the year, which may also have
affected the results. The comparison group may still
have been scuba diving, but simply listed another activ-
ity as their main type of activity. It is unlikely any indi-
vidual diver participated in this survey more than once.
The US adult recreational diving community is a
dynamic population. Prospective research with repre-
sentative sampling is required to characterize active
US
recreational
divers.
No
previous
study
has
attempted this and hitherto it was largely unknown
what modifiable risk factors exist to prevent death or
injury among active US scuba divers. Active adult US
scuba divers are often well educated, more than half
earn �US$75,000 per year, and they are commonly
married with children (Table 1). High cholesterol,
hypertension, high BMI, and smoking status should
all be addressed during routine diving fitness physician
assessments, to reduce the risk of mortality while
diving.
