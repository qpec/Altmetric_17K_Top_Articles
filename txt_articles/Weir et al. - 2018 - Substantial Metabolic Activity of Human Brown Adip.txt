SUMMARY
Current understanding of in vivo human brown adi-
pose tissue (BAT) physiology is limited by a reliance
on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
tomography (CT) scanning, which has measured
exogenous glucose and fatty acid uptake but not
quantified endogenous substrate utilization by BAT.
Six lean, healthy men underwent 18fluorodeoxyglu-
cose-PET/CT scanning to localize BAT so microdial-
ysis catheters could be inserted in supraclavicular
BAT under CT guidance and in abdominal subcu-
taneous white adipose tissue (WAT). Arterial and
dialysate
samples
were collected during
warm
(�25�C) and cold exposure (�17�C), and blood flow
was measured by 133xenon washout. During warm
conditions, there was increased glucose uptake
and lactate release and decreased glycerol release
by
BAT
compared
with
WAT.
Cold
exposure
increased blood flow, glycerol release, and glucose
and glutamate uptake only by BAT. This novel use
of microdialysis reveals that human BAT is metabol-
ically active during warm conditions. BAT activation
substantially increases local lipolysis but also utiliza-
tion of other substrates such as glutamate.
INTRODUCTION
The identification of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult hu-
mans offers the possibility of activating this tissue to treat
metabolic disease. However, our understanding of in vivo hu-
man BAT physiology has been limited by the requirement for
positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
(CT) to quantify BAT activity. For example, PET/CT (most
commonly using 18fluorodeoxyglucose [18FDG]) has been relied
upon to infer that BAT is activated by cold (Saito et al., 2009;
Virtanen et al., 2009), is under sympathetic regulation (Cypess
et al., 2015), contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis (Ouel-
let et al., 2012), enhances insulin sensitivity (Lee et al., 2014),
and regulates lipid metabolism (Chondronikola et al., 2016).
While these findings show that human and rodent BAT share
substantial similarities, there are also important differences in
the regulation of BAT activation (Ramage et al., 2016), high-
lighting the need to dissect BAT physiology in humans. In addi-
tion, although fatty acids are the primary substrate for BAT
thermogenesis in rodents (Ma and Foster, 1986), most human
studies using PET have used glucose uptake as the primary
measurement of BAT activation.
Many important questions regarding substrate utilization by
human BAT have not been answered using PET. For example,
while there has been much attention on cold- and drug-induced
BAT activation, it is unclear whether there is substantial meta-
bolic activity by BAT during warm conditions when thermo-
genesis is not required. In addition, the fate of the substantial
cold-induced glucose uptake by BAT is unclear, such as whether
this is oxidized to generate heat or predominantly released as in-
termediates such as lactate and pyruvate, as in rodents (Ma and
Foster, 1986). PET cannot measure the hydrolysis of local triglyc-
erides which are believed to be the primary substrate for BAT
thermogenesis (Blondin et al., 2017), and is limited by the capac-
ity to measure uptake of one substrate at a time. This has led to a
focus on glucose with limited information available on other sub-
strate utilization by human BAT. Alternative in vivo techniques
used to study human BAT, such as measurement of supracla-
vicular temperature (Lee et al., 2011; Ramage et al., 2016), MRI

Microdialysis is a technique where a catheter with a semi-
permeable membrane is inserted into a tissue of interest, an
isotonic perfusate is then slowly infused through the catheter
to allow the perfusate to equilibrate with the interstitial concen-
trations (Barbe et al., 2001), and dialysate is collected to
measure compounds of interest. We adapted microdialysis, in
combination with arterial and blood flow measurements and sta-
ble isotope glucose and glycerol tracer infusion, as a novel in vivo
technique to quantify endogenous substrate utilization by human
BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) during warm conditions and
during cold activation.
RESULTS
Study Visit 1: Identification and Quantification of 18FDG
Uptake by BAT
Six lean healthy men (subject characteristics in Table S1) under-
went 18FDG-PET/CT scanning following cold exposure to quan-
tify their active BAT (Figure S1). All six subjects had detectable
18FDG uptake by BAT (Figures 1A–1C), with a mean BAT volume
of 117 ± 22 cm3. In particular, there was substantial 18FDG up-
take by supraclavicular BAT in all subjects, which ensured they
could proceed to study visit 2.
Study Visit 2: Measurement of BAT Activity Using
Microdialysis
Microdialysis catheters were placed in supraclavicular BAT and
abdominal subcutaneous WAT (Figure S1). 133Xenon was in-
jected into BAT and WAT to measure blood flow continuously
(Astrup et al., 1985). A catheter was inserted into a radial artery
for repeated sampling. Subjects were kept in a warm room
(�25�C) and then a cold room (�17�C) each for 3 hr.
Whole-Body Measurements
Whole-body energy expenditure was increased by 125 ±
32 kcal/24 hr by cold exposure (Figure 1D) (p < 0.01). Cold expo-
sure decreased peripheral skin temperature, increased systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (Table S1), and transiently increased
plasma noradrenaline (Figure 1G) but not adrenaline concentra-
tions (Figure S2). Cold exposure slightly decreased arterial
glucose but did not increase clearance of 6,6-[2H]2-labeled
glucose (Figures 1E and 1F). Cold exposure increased whole-
body lipolysis as demonstrated by arterial non-esterified fatty
acids and the rate of appearance of glycerol (Figures 1I and 1J).
Cold exposure did not alter arterial lactate or pyruvate levels
but transiently decreased glutamate concentrations (Figure S2).
Adipose Tissue Measurements
Warm Conditions.
Glucose concentrations in BAT were lower
compared with WAT (Figure 2A), indicating substantial glucose
uptake by BAT in warm conditions not typically associated

appearance (Ra) of glycerol. Data were analyzed using the paired t test or by repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc least significant difference (LSD) testing.

 with thermogenesis. Glycerol concentrations were lower in BAT
than in WAT (Figure 2B), consistent with either reduced lipolysis
or enhanced glycerol recycling in BAT. Lactate concentrations
were higher in BAT, in keeping with increased glycolysis (Fig-
ure 2C), while pyruvate levels were similar in both tissues (Fig-
ure 2D). In addition, glutamate concentrations were higher in
BAT, potentially due to reduced uptake (Figure 2E).
Cold Conditions.
Interstitial BAT glucose levels decreased
further during cold exposure, consistent with previous PET
data identifying substantial cold-induced glucose uptake by
BAT (Figure 2A). Similarly, cold decreased glutamate concentra-
tions only in BAT (Figure 2E). Cold increased lactate concentra-
tions in WAT (Figure 2C) but did not alter glycerol or pyruvate
concentrations in WAT or BAT (Figures 2B and 2D). The reduc-
tion in BAT glucose concentrations closely correlated with
cold-induced thermogenesis (Figure 2F, p < 0.01).
Quantifying Net Substrate Balance across BAT
The use of 133xenon to measure adipose tissue blood flow in ‘‘real
time’’ allowed quantification of net balance of the above measure-
ments. While blood flow was similar between WAT and BAT de-
pots during warm conditions, cold exposure substantially
increased blood flow only in BAT as seen previously (Figure 3A)
(Astrup et al., 1985; Orava et al., 2011). The increase in BAT blood
flow did not correlate with cold-induced thermogenesis (R2 =
0.057). The arterial and interstitial measurements were used to
quantify net balance across WAT and BAT during warm and
cold conditions, following calculation of the true interstitial con-
centrations at zero flow (Figure S3). There was detectable glucose
uptake only by BAT during warm conditions (p < 0.05 versus 0)
(Figure 3B). Cold exposure increased net glucose uptake by
BAT by 11.5 ± 3.5 mmol/100 g tissue/min (p < 0.05) but not by
WAT. There was net uptake of glutamate by WAT and BAT during
warm conditions (both p < 0.05 versus 0) (Figure 3F), but cold only
increased glutamate uptake by BAT. There was higher glycerol
release by WAT than BAT during warm exposure; however,
cold exposure only increased glycerol release by BAT (by 1.1 ±
0.3 mmol/100 g tissue/min) (Figure 3C). Net release of lactate
was higher by BAT than WAT during warm conditions (Figure 3D),
and cold increased lactate release by WAT during cold exposure.
Pyruvate release by WAT and BAT was similar (both p < 0.05
versus 0) and unaltered by cold exposure (Figure 3E).
Glycerol Recycling in Human BAT
The reduced glycerol release by human BAT during warm condi-
tions could be secondary to reduced lipolysis or substantial glyc-
erol recycling. In WAT, glycerol is not recycled due to the lack of
the enzyme glycerol kinase; however, human peri-renal BAT has
substantial glycerol kinase activity (Chakrabarty et al., 1983). To
test this, we first measured glycerol kinase mRNA levels in paired
human supraclavicular BAT and WAT samples (Ramage et al.,
2016). Glycerol kinase expression was significantly higher in
BAT than WAT (Figure 4A), and there was a strong correlation
between glycerol kinase and uncoupling protein 1 mRNA levels
(Figure 4B, p < 0.01). To test whether there was considerable
glycerol recycling, [3H]glycerol incorporation into the lipid frac-
tion was measured in primary human supraclavicular brown

 and white adipocytes cultured in the presence of either vehicle
(to model thermoneutrality) or 10 mM noradrenaline (to model
thermogenesis). Consistent with substantial glycerol recycling,
3H counts were increased severalfold in the brown compared
with white adipocytes in both vehicle and noradrenaline-treated
groups (Figure 4C). Noradrenaline did not alter 3H uptake in the
brown adipocytes and decreased uptake in the white adipo-
cytes. Consistent with the in vivo results, glycerol release by
human brown adipocytes was reduced compared with white ad-
ipocytes in the vehicle-treated group and was increased by
noradrenaline (Figure 4D). Similar results were obtained when
[3H]glycerol uptake and glycerol release were normalized to
cellular lipid (Figures 4C and 4D) or protein content (Figure S4).
Other Intermediates in Human BAT
The high lactate concentrations in BAT may have an important
physiological role. Lactate inhibits lipolysis through the GPR81
receptor, which is highly expressed in human BAT (Liu et al.,
2009; Ahmed et al., 2010). Supporting this, we found high
expression of GPR81 in both human WAT and BAT samples (Fig-
ure 4A), suggesting that the high BAT lactate concentrations
observed during warm conditions may inhibit lipolysis and
ensure that BAT triglyceride stores are rapidly replenished and
maintained for subsequent hydrolysis during cold-induced ther-
mogenesis. LDHA and LDHB mRNA levels were similar between
WAT and BAT (Figure 4A).
There were increased mRNA levels of pyruvate dehydroge-
nase (PDH) subunit A (and a trend for increased PDHB
[p = 0.06]) in BAT compared with WAT while levels of the PDH
kinases were similar in both depots (Figure 4A), suggesting
that pyruvate may be used as a substrate for the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle in human BAT. We found low mRNA levels of
the glutamate transporter GLAST in BAT compared with WAT
(Figure 4A), suggesting that the high interstitial BAT glutamate
levels in the warm may be due to reduced uptake. In addition,
mRNA levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (GPT),
which converts alanine and a-ketoglutarate to pyruvate and
glutamate, respectively, were increased in human BAT (Fig-
ure 4A), which could indicate enhanced glutamate synthesis
and release by BAT. Glutamate dehydrogenase and GPT2
mRNA levels were similar between WAT and BAT.
DISCUSSION
We adapted microdialysis as a novel tool to examine human BAT
physiology in vivo and quantified uptake of substrates and
release of intermediates by measuring arterio-interstitial differ-
ences in combination with real-time measurement of adipose tis-
sue blood flow using 133xenon. We discovered that human BAT
is metabolically active even during warm conditions not typically
associated with BAT thermogenesis. There was glucose uptake
by BAT but not WAT during warm conditions, while lactate
release by BAT was higher than by WAT. Pyruvate release by
BAT was also substantial, and taken together this suggests
high rates of glycolysis in BAT during warm conditions. These
data suggest that during warm conditions glucose may be
used by BAT for glyceroneogenesis or fatty acid synthesis to in-
crease triglyceride stores for subsequent hydrolysis when acti-
vated by cold. Glycerol release by BAT was reduced during
warm conditions compared with WAT. Our in vitro data suggest
that this is most likely due to glycerol recycling, although it is also
possible that lipolysis is reduced, potentially due to elevated

 lactate levels inhibiting lipolysis through GPR81 (Liu et al., 2009).
In addition, there was increased interstitial glutamate concentra-
tions in BAT, potentially due to reduced uptake by the glutamate
transporter. Glutamate inhibits glucose uptake by adipocytes
(Nagao et al., 2017), so reducing intracellular glutamate may
enhance glucose uptake by BAT compared with WAT.
Glucose was the primary substrate taken up by BAT during
cold exposure; the increase in glucose uptake during cold acti-
vation (�11.5 mmol/100 g/min) was similar to previous results ob-
tained using 18FDG-PET/CT (Virtanen et al., 2009; Ouellet et al.,
2012). The decrease in interstitial BAT glucose concentrations
correlated with cold-induced thermogenesis, supporting previ-
ous PET/CT data (Yoneshiro et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013).
Lactate release was �21 mmol/100 g tissue/min during cold
exposure and, although not statistically significant, increased
by �6 mmol/100 g tissue/min compared with warm conditions.
Our data strongly suggest that the majority of glucose uptake
by BAT is not fully oxidized during BAT thermogenesis. Lactate
production also accounts for a large proportion of glucose up-
take by rodent BAT during thermogenesis (Ma and Foster,
1986). Two lactate molecules are produced from one glucose
molecule so could account for all glucose uptake during warm
conditions and over half (�10.5 mmol/100 g tissue/min) of
glucose uptake during BAT activation. Pyruvate production
would only account for a small amount of glucose uptake
(�0.25 mmol/100 g tissue/min). If the remaining glucose uptake
(�6 mmol/100 g tissue/min would translate to �10 mmol glucose
over a 24-hr period in our subjects) was fully oxidized, this would
generate only �7 kcal/24 hr. This could still account for the ma-
jority of BAT thermogenesis according to some recent reports
(Muzik et al., 2013; Din et al., 2016). However, the remaining
glucose could be used for alternative processes such as glycer-
oneogenesis for triglyceride synthesis or alternatively for anaple-
rosis. The substantial glutamate uptake by BAT during cold
activation may support the latter concept.
Recent data suggest that fatty acids hydrolyzed from local
triglycerides are required for human BAT thermogenesis (Blondin
et al., 2017). The glycerol release quantified by BAT during cold
exposure (2.17 mmol/100 g tissue/min) would release �11 mmol
of fatty acids in 24 hr. Assuming these are on average 16C fatty
acids, if fully oxidized these could produce �25 kcal/24 hr. In
addition, this calculation ignores the effect of glycerol recycling
(which may be increased substantially during thermogenesis
[Labbe et al., 2015]) and oxidation of circulating fatty acids taken
up by BAT (Ouellet et al., 2012), so this may be a considerable
underestimation. Our data suggest that fatty acids released
from local triglycerides likely account for the majority of BAT
thermogenesis. These estimates rely on several large assump-
tions, such as that substrate utilization remains constant during
chronic activation and is similar in all BAT depots. In addition,
more severe cold exposure may further increase substrate utili-
zation by BAT. Surprisingly, we did not detect increased glycerol

 release by WAT during cold activation, despite increasing whole-
body rate of appearance of glycerol. It is possible the microdial-
ysis technique is not sensitive enough to detect the small local
increase in WAT lipolysis. Conversely, abdominal adipose tissue
may not contribute substantially to cold-induced lipolysis,
although this is less likely. Recovery of fatty acids is unreliable
using the microdialysis technique, so we were unable to measure
fatty acid uptake or release by BAT (Jensen et al., 2007),
although previous data suggest that fatty acid uptake is lower
than glucose uptake by BAT (Ouellet et al., 2012).
There was substantial lactate and pyruvate release by BAT dur-
ing warm and cold exposure. This did not increase during BAT
activation, unlike in rodents (Ma and Foster, 1986); however,
this may have occurred with more extreme and/or more pro-
longed cooling. We did find substantial uptake of glutamate by
human BAT during cold activation. Pyruvate can be a substrate
for BAT thermogenesis (Cannon and Nedergaard, 1979) and
glutamate can be converted to a-ketoglutarate to enter the TCA
cycle. The enzymes catalyzing those reactions were expressed
in human BAT, and it is likely that BAT uses substrates other
than fatty acids and glucose during thermogenesis. However,
we did not measure protein or enzyme activity while mRNA levels
of these enzymes may be regulated by cold exposure (Hao et al.,
2015). Further work is required to determine the fate of these in-
termediates during BAT thermogenesis. The decrease in arterial
blood glucose without increased glucose clearance may be due
to reduced appearance of glucose. In support of this, the rate of
appearance of glucose during cold was 8.0 ± 0.3 versus 8.5 ±
0.5 mmol/kg/min in the warm (p = 0.12), calculated using the
non-steady-state Steele equation (Stimson et al., 2017).
The microdialysis technique offers several advantages over
currently available methods to measure BAT activity in vivo. Mea-
surement can be performed of multiple endogenous substrates in
the tissue, is not reliant on exogenously administered tracers, can
assess the effect of interventions in real time, and could be used to
deliver drugs locally to determine the effect on BAT function. The
disadvantages of microdialysis include the invasive nature of the
technique and the radiation exposure from PET and CT scanning.
The latter is required to ensure correct catheter placement as BAT
depots are small (1–2 cm) and often surrounded by WAT. In addi-
tion, the slow microdialysis flow rates required to quantify tissue
concentrations precludes measurement of very acute changes in
BAT activation and small sample volumes are limiting. There are
also potential confounders of the technique to consider. The
extraction efficiency of all five analytes in dialysate was similar in
WAT and BAT during warmand coldconditions,and soshouldreli-
ably reflect the true tissue concentrations. Furthermore, the dialy-
sate concentrations did not change over 3 hr of cold exposure,
suggesting that equilibrium was achieved. A potential confounder
could be the contribution of neighboring muscle to the interstitial
BAT measurements, despite the short catheter membrane length
and use of CT to ensure correct catheter placement. However,
18FDG uptake and O2 consumption by these muscles is much
lower than BAT during cold exposure (Ouellet et al., 2012; Blondin
etal.,2015;Dinetal.,2016)and,ifanything,would causeanunder-
estimation of substrate utilization by BAT. In addition, the BAT
lactate and glycerol concentrations and glucose uptake by BAT
were substantially higher than previously reported in skeletal mus-
cle (Orava et al., 2011; Muller et al., 1996; Rosdahl et al., 1998).
Limitations of Study
There are some caveats with this protocol to consider. Firstly,
due to the invasive nature of microdialysis we were only able
to cannulate two BAT depots. We measured substrate utilization
in one depot and it is possible that substrate utilization by other
BAT depots may differ. Therefore, our estimations of substrate
utilization by all BAT should be interpreted with caution. Sec-
ondly, in our protocol, subjects were exposed to mild cold for
only 3 hr. It is possible that more severe or more prolonged expo-
sure would have altered substrate utilization by BAT substan-
tially, as this may deplete local triglyceride stores. Finally, we
only studied young lean men so are unable to determine how
age, weight, or sex alters substrate utilization by BAT.
To conclude, we developed microdialysis as a novel technique
to measure in vivo BAT activity in humans. We determined that
there is substantial metabolic activity in BAT even during warm
conditions with increased glucose uptake, lactate production,
and reduced glycerol release than WAT. Cold-induced BAT acti-
vation substantially increases glucose uptake and glycerol
release from lipolysis of BAT triglyceride stores, and most likely
leads to utilization of additional substrates such as glutamate.
Improved understanding of substrate utilization by BAT in hu-
mans may identify new targets to activate this tissue to improve
metabolic health.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
In Vivo Study Participants
Six healthy lean men (subject information in Table S1) were recruited using the following inclusion criteria: aged 18-35 years; body
mass index (BMI) 18.5-25 kg/m2; weight change <5% in last 6 months; no acute or chronic medical conditions; on no regular med-
ications; alcohol intake % 21 units/ week; no claustrophobia; no allergy to local anaesthetic. Approval was obtained from the South
East Scotland Research Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from each subject.
In Vitro Study Participants and Cell Culture
White and brown adipose tissue samples were obtained from euthyroid subjects undergoing elective thyroid or parathyroid surgery
(subject details in Table S2) in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh as previously described (Ramage et al., 2016). Approval was obtained
from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from each subject. During their oper-
ation, a small quantity of BAT was obtained from the central compartment of the neck superior to the clavicle and deep to the lateral
thyroid lobe either adjacent to the longus colli muscle or to the oesophagus. Paired WAT samples were obtained from the superficial
subcutaneous neck. Tissue was either immediately frozen at �80�C for subsequent qPCR (n = 12, 11 female/1 male) or the stromal
vascular fraction isolated for culture (n = 8, 6 female/2 male) as previously described (Ramage et al., 2016). Adipose tissue for isola-
tion was cut into small pieces and digested using 0.2% collagenase type 1 in Krebs-Heinseleit buffer at 37�C for 45 min. Following
centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min at 20�C, the re-suspended pellet was passed through a 100 mm filter and subjected to centrifugation
at 200 g for 5 min at 20�C. The pellet was re-suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 nM human fibroblast
growth factor-basic (Peprotech, Rocky Jill, New Jersey) and cultured in 6-well plates at 37�C. Medium was changed every 2-3 days
and cells were passaged at 80% confluence. Confluent cells were differentiated in DMEM containing 10% FBS with the addition of
1 nM tri-iodothyronine, 20 nM insulin, 500 mM IBMX, 500 nM dexamethasone and 125 mM indomethacin for 5 days (days 2-7). There-
after, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 nM tri-iodothyronine and 20 nM insulin until the experiments which were
performed between days 14–16.

 METHOD DETAILS
In Vivo Study Protocol
Subjects attended the Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility after overnight fast wearing the same clothes (clo thickness �0.5-0.6) on 2
consecutive days and avoided alcohol and exercise for 48 hr prior to each visit. On study visit 1 (‘BAT finding visit’), measurements
were performed of height, weight, and body fat using bioimpedance (using an Omron BF-302). A cannula was placed in an antecubital
vein and a CT needle guide (IZI Medial Products, Baltimore, MD) was placed posteriorly medial to the scapular area to aid the sub-
sequent CT-guided insertions. Thereafter, subjects were placed in a room cooled to 17�C for 2 hr to activate BAT. After 1 hr of cold
exposure, subjects received an intravenous injection of 185 MBq 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). Subjects were asked and as-
sessed clinically for shivering every 15 min; no shivering was detected clinically or noted by any subject during either visit. PET/CT
was then performed as previously described (Ramage et al., 2016) with the exception that subjects lay prone in the scanner while the
scans were performed using 5-min beds. The PET/CT scan was reviewed to ensure there was enough 18FDG uptake by BAT to allow
insertion of the microdialysis catheter and 133Xenon at visit 2. Subjects were allowed home and kept the needle guides in place
overnight.
Upon arrival for study visit 2 (microdialysis visit), anthropometric measurements were performed as per visit 1. A cannula was
placed in an ante-cubital fossa vein and baseline bloods obtained. Intravenous infusions of 6,6-[2H]2-glucose (at a rate of
0.22 mmol/kg/min following a 17.6 mmol/kg bolus) and 1,1,2,3,3-[2H]5-glycerol (at 0.11 mmol/kg/min following a 1.6 mmol/kg bolus)
were commenced at T= –120 min for 8 hr (Figure S1). Subjects were moved to the CT suite at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
and lay prone on a 64-multidetector row CT scanner (Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems, Crawley, United Kingdom). A microdial-
ysis catheter (63 microdialysis catheter (length 60 mm, membrane 10 mm), M Dialysis, Johanneshov, Sweden) was inserted into the
supraclavicular BAT under local anaesthetic (1% lidocaine), using the PET/CT images from study visit 1 under initially ultrasound (us-
ing a LOGIQ S7 Expert, GE Medical Systems Ltd, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and then CT-guidance to ensure the CT-visible
catheter tip was correctly positioned in the PET positive BAT (Figure S1). 133Xenon (2 MBq) was then injected into the contralateral
supraclavicular BAT depot under CT-guidance using a 22G spinal needle to measure adipose tissue blood flow continuously
throughout the study protocol (Goossens and Karpe, 2008). Subjects returned to the Clinical Research Facility and were placed
in a room at �25�C (warm room). A second microdialysis catheter was placed in subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue
(WAT) �5 cm lateral to the umbilicus and 2MBq 133Xenon was injected in the contralateral WAT at the same depth as the catheter.
An arterial catheter (Leadercath, Vygon Ltd, Swindon, United Kingdom) was inserted in a radial artery for blood sampling and mea-
surement of blood pressure. At t = 0 min, microdialysis was commenced in both WAT and BAT depots using M Dialysis 107 pumps at
a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Blood flow was measured continuously using a gamma counter (John Caunt Scientific, Lancashire, United
Kingdom). Energy expenditure was measured each hour by indirect calorimetry. Arterial samples and dialysate were collected regu-
larly (Figure S1). Skin temperature was measured regularly from the left and right distal forearm using skin temperature probes
(YSI 409 series, Henleys Medical Supplies Ltd, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) with the results presented as the mean of the two
sides. At t = 180 min, subjects were moved to a room cooled to �17�C (cold room). Identical measurements were performed during
cold exposure.
PET/CT Protocol and Analysis
All subjects lay prone in a hybrid PET/CT scanner (Biograph mCT, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Subjects under-
went an initial low dose CT for attenuation correction (non-enhanced, 120 kV) with tube current modulation applied 20 mAs quality
reference followed by static PET imaging of the upper body using 5 min beds. Images were analysed using PMOD version 3.409
(PMOD technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). 18FDG uptake by BAT was quantified by measuring the mean uptake in KBq from all pixels
with uptake >2KBq/cc which corresponded to tissues with a radio-density on the CT scan with Hounsfield unit (HU) values within the
expected range for adipose tissue (from �150 to �30 HU). The total 18FDG uptake by BAT was calculated as the mean uptake in
KBq/cc multiplied by the volume of active BAT in cc.
Indirect Calorimetry
Energy expenditure was measured for 15 min each hour using a ventilated-hood indirect calorimeter (GEM Nutrition, Cheshire,
United Kingdom). The first 5 min of data were discarded and the mean value for the final 10 min recorded each hour. Energy expen-
diture (EE) is presented as the mean of three values obtained during warm and cold exposure. Cold-induced thermogenesis was
calculated by subtracting the mean EE in the warm room from the EE in the cold room.
Microdialysis Technique
Microdialysis Infusion Method Development
Initial work was performed testing flow rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mL/min using the 63 M Dialysis catheters in vitro to
determine whether equilibrium was achieved. Microdialysis was performed in solutions containing 3 mmol/L glucose, 200 mmol/L
glycerol, 1.5 mmol/L lactate, 70 mmol/L pyruvate, and 20 mmol/L glutamate at the above rates (n=4). The mean dialysate concentra-
tions of all 5 compounds of interest were within 7% of the known concentrations when using flow rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 mL/min,
and when using a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol. Concentrations decreased substantially at the higher
flow rates.

 To determine the extraction efficiency of these compounds in white and brown adipose tissue in vivo, 4 healthy male subjects (aged
26.8 ± 3.0 years, BMI 22.5 ± 0.7 kg/m2) were recruited. Local ethical approval and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
The visit 1 protocol was identical to that described above, which identified substantial 18FDG uptake by BAT in all subjects. Subjects
returned after overnight fast the following morning during which a 63 M Dialysis catheter was placed in the supraclavicular BAT under
CT guidance and in subcutaneous abdominal WAT. Two of the subjects were then kept in a room at 21�C and the other two subjects
were kept at 17�C for the duration of the visit to determine the extraction efficiency during both warm and cold conditions. T1 perfu-
sion fluid was infused at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mL/min and dialysate was collected regularly throughout. Unlike in vitro,
mean concentrations of glucose, glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate did not reach steady state even at the lower flow rates.
The tissue concentration of each compound at zero flow was determined using the perfusion rate method (Stahle et al., 1991) in order
to quantify arterio-interstitial differences. The flow rate was plotted against 1/mean concentration, which had linear R2 values of >0.96
for all 5 compounds of interest when the 5.0 mL/min flow rate was excluded (Figure S3). At 0.3 mL/min (the flow rate chosen for the
main study protocol), the calculated recovery of the various compounds in the warm was 69% (WAT) and 72% (BAT) for glucose,
84% (both WAT and BAT) for lactate, 74% (WAT) and 76% (BAT) for pyruvate, 33% (WAT) and 35% (BAT) for glycerol and 80%
(both WAT and BAT) for glutamate. The calculated recovery during cold conditions was 72% (WAT) and 74% (BAT) for glucose,
82% (WAT) and 78% (BAT) for lactate, 74% (WAT) and 73% (BAT) for pyruvate, 33% (WAT) and 32% (BAT) for glycerol and 82%
(WAT) and 88% (BAT) for glutamate.
Microdialysis Study Protocol
Following insertion of a 63 M Dialysis catheter in the supraclavicular BAT and abdominal WAT T1 perfusion fluid was infused through
both M Dialysis 107 pumps (M Dialysis, Johanneshov, Sweden) at a rate of 0.3 mL/min. Dialysate was collected in microvials each
hour from the WAT and BAT catheters respectively and stored in microvial racks at �80�C until analysis. Dialysate collected during
the first hour of infusion (from T=0 to T+60 min) was discarded due to tissue trauma from the insertions potentially confounding re-
sults. Three of the subjects had all 6 dialysate samples collected as per study protocol. In these subjects dialysate concentrations of
glucose, glycerol, pyruvate, lactate and glycerol did not change during the same conditions (e.g. results from t+120 and t+180 were
similar as were concentrations at t+240, t+300 and t+360 min). However, in three subjects there were temporary blockages in one of
the microdialysis catheters leading to loss of one or more samples although all subjects had at least one dialysate sample collected
during both warm and cold conditions. Therefore, the data are presented as the mean of all results obtained from each subject in the
warm and cold conditions.
In Vitro Study Protocol
Paired primary human brown and white adipocytes were incubated in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate phosphate buffer solution with
25 mmol/L glucose at pH 7.4 with 10mM noradrenaline or vehicle for either 6 or 24 hr depending on the experiment. Glycerol release
by the adipocytes was measured following 24 hr incubation as previously described (Stimson et al., 2017). To measure incorporation
of 3H-glycerol into lipid (a measure of glycerol recycling), 100 mM glycerol and 6.25 mM 2-[3H]-glycerol (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA)
was added to the above medium in a subset of adipocytes for 6 hr by adapting a previously published protocol (Kiskinis et al., 2014).
3H-Glycerol Incorporation Assay
The incorporation of 3H-glycerol into lipid was measured in triplicate by adapting a previously published protocol (Kiskinis et al.,
2014). Cells were serum starved for 3 hr and then incubated as above. Following the 6-hour incubation, cells were washed three times
in 4�C PBS then methanol (900 mL) was added to wells, which were then scraped on ice to lyse the cells prior to transfer to a new tube.
Chloroform (450 mL) and then water (450 mL) were added to the mixture, vortexed, and then subjected to centrifugation at 3,200 g for
20 min at room temperature. The infranatant (organic lipid layer) was transferred to a new tube, dried down under N2 at 50�C prior to
reconstitution in scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and quantification by liquid scintillation counting. To ac-
count for variability in the differentiation of the adipocytes, results were normalised either to the cellular lipid content as measured by
Oil Red O or to cellular protein content.
Biochemical Assays
Serum insulin (DRG Instruments, Marburg, Germany), plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations (LDN, Nordhorn, Ger-
many) were measured by ELISA. NEFAs were measured using a colorimetric assay (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, Virginia, USA).
Serum glutamate (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), lactate and pyruvate (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) were
measured using fluorimetric kits. Glycerol in the culture medium was measured using a colourimetric kit (Sigma, Poole, UK) and pro-
tein in cell lysates was measured in duplicate using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) as previously described (Stimson
et al., 2017). Cellular lipid content was measured using Oil Red O (Sigma, Poole, UK) as previously described (Janderova et al., 2003).
Plasma glucose, 6,6-[2H]2-glucose (D2-glucose), glycerol and 1,1,2,3,3-[2H]5-glycerol (D5-glycerol) were measured using gas
chromatography mass spectrometry as previously described (Macfarlane et al., 2014). Dialysate glucose, glycerol, lactate, pyruvate,
and glutamate concentrations were measured using an ISCUS clinical microdialysis analyser (M Dialysis, Johanneshov, Sweden).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR in Human Brown and White Adipose Tissue
qPCR was performed as previously described (Ramage et al., 2016). mRNA levels are presented as the ratio of genes of interest to the
mean of internal control genes (18S and cyclophilin A). Primer sequences and probes numbers are detailed in Table S3.

 Tracer Kinetics and Net Balance Equations
The rate of appearance (Ra) of glycerol was calculated using the following equation:
Ra glycerol = D5-Glycerol infusion rate/(D5-Glycerol/Glycerol tracer: tracee ratio)
The metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucose was calculated using the following equation:
MCR glucose = D2-Glucose infusion rate/D2-Glucose concentration
The rate of disposal of glucose was also calculated using the above equation for Ra glycerol by adapting the respective tracer and
tracee values. Both the values for MCR glucose and Rd glucose were unchanged by cold exposure, the results presented are for the
MCR glucose.
Net balance of glucose was calculated using the following equation, which was adapted by insertion of relevant values to calculate
net balance of the other compounds of interest:
Net glucose balance = ([GlucoseArtery] – [GlucoseInterstitial]) x blood flow
The interstitial concentrations used in the above equation were the calculated tissue concentrations at zero flow. This was calcu-
lated for each compound by dividing the concentration measured in the dialysate by the extraction efficiency value at 0.3 mL/min
(e.g., for WAT glucose during warm conditions the measured concentration was divided by 0.69).
Measurement of Adipose Tissue Blood Flow Using 133Xenon
Adipose tissue blood flow was measured as previously described (Goossens and Karpe, 2008) using a gamma counter (John Caunt
Scientific Ltd, Bury, United Kingdom) with measurements performed every minute. The tissue-blood partition coefficient of 133Xe for
adipose tissue (l) was calculated using the following equation (Goossens and Karpe, 2008):
l (ml/g) = [V(SL/SP � 1) + 1] / [Hct(SC/SP � 1) + 1]
In this equation V is the lipid fraction of adipose tissue, SL (solubility in lipid) is 1.8276 mL/g, SP (solubility in plasma) is
0.0939 mL/mL, Hct is the hematocrit (expressed as a fraction), and SC (solubility in red blood cells) is 0.2710 mL/mL. It was not
possible to measure V in this group of participants, as such 0.72 was used for human supraclavicular BAT as has been determined
previously using MRS in lean individuals, while 0.87 was used for WAT (Raiko et al., 2015). The mean partition coefficients for these
subjects were 9.4 ± 0.1 (WAT) and 7.9 ± 0.1 (BAT).
Adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) was calculated using the following equation:
ATBF (mL/100g tissue/min) = slope of semilog plot (ln counts/s) 3 l (mL/g) 3 100 (g) 3 60 (s)
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data were tested for normal distribution using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and
were log transformed if not normally distributed. Comparisons between two related groups (e.g. energy expenditure during warm and
cold conditions) were examined using the paired t test, while comparisons involving three or more related groups were analysed us-
ing repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc testing using Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test. The specific statistical tests
used are detailed in the respective figure legends. Associations were tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. p < 0.05 was
considered significant. SPSS version 22 was used for all analyses.
