Cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Modern treatment strat-
egies have led to an improvement in the chances of surviving a diagnosis of cancer; however, these gains can come at a cost.
Patients may experience adverse cardiovascular events related to their cancer treatment or as a result of an exacerbation of
underlying cardiovascular disease. With longer periods of survival, late effects of cancer treatment may become clinically evi-
dent years or decades after completion of therapy. Current cancer therapy incorporates multiple agents whose deleterious car-
diac effects may be additive or synergistic. Cardiac dysfunction may result from agents that can result in myocyte destruction,
such as with anthracycline use, or from agents that appear to transiently affect left ventricular contractility. In addition, cancer
treatment may be associated with other cardiac events, such as severe treatment-induced hypertension and vasospastic and
thromboembolic ischemia, as well as rhythm disturbances, including QTc prolongation, that may be rarely life-threatening. Early
and late effects of chest radiation can lead to radiation-induced heart disease, including pericardial disease, myocardial fibrosis,
cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and arrhythmias, in the setting of myocardial fibrosis. The discipline
of cardio-oncology has developed in response to the combined decision making necessary to optimize the care of cancer
patients, whether they are receiving active treatment or are long-term survivors. Strategies to prevent or mitigate cardiovascular
damage from cancer treatment are needed to provide the best cancer care. This review will focus on the common cardiovascu-
lar issues that may arise during or after cancer therapy, the detection and monitoring of cardiovascular injury, and the best
management principles to protect against or minimize cardiotoxicity during the spectrum of cancer treatment strategies. CA

Introduction
Mortality rates from cancer have declined over the past 30 years largely because of early detection strategies, improved surgi-
cal approaches, as well as advances in cancer therapeutics.1-3 Improvement in survivorship, however, can be associated with
other organ injuries, including impact on cardiovascular health.4 Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is now the second
leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.1-3,5,6 Conventional chemotherapy and targeted
therapies are associated with an increased risk of cardiac damage, including left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (LVD) and
heart failure (HF),7,8 treatment-induced hypertension, vasospastic and thromboembolic ischemia, as well as rhythm distur-
bances, including conduction system damage and potentially QTc prolongation, that may be rarely life-threatening.
Although some of these cardiac adverse effects are irreversible and cause progressive CVD, others induce only temporary
dysfunction with no apparent long-term sequelae.9 Early and late effects of chest radiation can lead to radiation-induced
heart disease (RIHD), which may involve a spectrum of cardiac conditions, such as pericardial disease, myocardial fibrosis,

 cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular
disease, and arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial fibro-
sis.10 Oncologists face the challenge of treating patients with
the best cancer therapies available without adversely impact-
ing CV health. The discipline of cardio-oncology has devel-
oped in response to the combined decision making necessary
to optimize the care of patients with cancer, whether they
are receiving active treatment or are long-term survivors after
successful treatment. This review will focus on the common
CV issues that may arise during or after cancer therapy, the
detection and monitoring of CV injury, and the best man-
agement principles to protect or minimize the impact of CV
issues during the spectrum of cancer therapies.
Epidemiology of Cancer Therapy-Induced
Cardiotoxicity
Cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of morbid-
ity and mortality in the industrialized world. However,
there is cause for optimism. Modern treatment strategies
have led to an improvement in the chances of surviving a
diagnosis of cancer; the 5-year survival for early stage breast
cancer increased from 79% in 1990 to 88% in 2012,2,3,6,11
and similar improvements have been seen with some other
solid and hematological cancers, including non-Hodgkin
lymphoma and testicular cancer.1 Long-term cancer survi-
vors are expected to increase by approximately 30% in the
next decade to an estimated 18 million by 2022 in the
United States alone.12 These improvements in survivorship
can come at a cost.4 Current anticancer therapies are associ-
ated with unique and various degrees of direct (eg, myocar-
dial toxicity, ischemia, hypertension, arrhythmias)13-17 as
well as indirect CV insults (eg, unfavorable lifestyle
changes). The incidence of cancer treatment-induced CV
injury varies widely, depending on the specific cancer ther-
apy used, duration of therapy, and underlying patient
comorbidities. In a recent comprehensive review of breast
cancer survivors in the United States, women were noted to
be at significantly increased risk of death caused by CVD,
exceeding their risk of death from the initial cancer itself or
from recurrent disease.5,6,11 CVD is the predominant cause
of mortality in breast cancer patients over 50 years of age18
and is a more common contributor than cancer to mortality
among older cancer survivors.5,6,11,18 CVD is not always
caused by toxicity from cancer therapy exposures, and it can
be a normal disease process in older adults. However, the
impact of cancer therapies on CVD in the general adult
cancer survivor population is largely unknown. We can gain
some insight from longitudinal studies in the pediatric pop-
ulation. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study showed
that, 15 to 25 years after diagnosis, survivors of childhood
cancer have an 8.2-fold higher rate of cardiac death com-
pared with the age-matched and sex-matched national
average.18,19 Compared with controls, long-term childhood
cancer survivors had 15-fold increased rates of congestive
HF, 10-fold higher rates of CVD, and 9-fold higher rates
of stroke.20 These results have significant implications for
adult cancer survivors who face the CV effects of aging
compounded by the potential detrimental impact of cancer
therapy. Recognition of the importance of CV health in
adult cancer patients is paramount if we are to sustain the
survival gains achieved with modern cancer therapies.
Common CV Adverse Events
LVD and HF
Cardiac dysfunction and HF are among the most serious CV
consequences of systemic cancer treatment.9 Conventional
chemotherapeutics, such as anthracyclines, antimetabolites,
and cyclophosphamide, can induce permanent myocardial cell
injury, leading to acute or chronic LVD.21,22 Anthracyclines,
commonly used in the treatment of solid tumors (ie, breast
cancer, osteosarcoma, etc) and hematologic malignancies
(Hodgkin/non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, etc), can trigger significant LVD. Anthracycline-
related LVD has historically been considered to be dose-
dependent, cumulative, and progressive,22,23 which manifest
as decreased LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and, ultimately,
symptomatic HF in up to 5% of patients.24 The mechanism
of anthracycline-induced cardiac injury has been studied
extensively and is still not clearly understood.15 Structural
cardiomyocyte alterations and cell death induced by anthra-
cyclines are mediated in part by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated in iron-dependent chemical reactions. ROS lead to
the peroxidation of myocyte membranes and, after calcium
influx, into the intracellular space, which can ultimately lead
to permanent myocyte damage. In addition, mechanisms have
been identified, including disturbances in DNA topoisomerase
2-b (Top2b) metabolism.25 The risk of doxorubicin-induced
HF (which can occur within hours, weeks, or years after expo-
sure) increases with cumulative dose of anthracycline: 3% to
5% with 400 mg/m2, 7% to 26% at 550 mg/m2, and 18% to
48% at 700 mg/m2.24,26,27 High-risk patients include those at
the extremes of age (<5 or >65 years), those who received
prior or concurrent chest radiation, and those with preexisting
cardiac disease or established CV risk factors.22
In a
Surveillance,
Epidemiology,
and
End Results
(SEER) database review of elderly breast cancer patients, the
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for HF was 1.26 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.12-1.42) for those who received adjuvant
anthracyclines compared with those who received nonan-
thracycline adjuvant regimens.18 The cumulative incidence
of HF at 10 years was 38% after anthracyclines, 32.5% with
nonanthracycline chemotherapy regimens, and 29% with no
chemotherapy.18,28 The likelihood of anthracycline-induced
HF almost doubles with each 10-year increase in age.

 Peripheral and coronary artery disease (CAD) (HR, 1.31
and 1.58, respectively), diabetes (HR, 1.74), hypertension
(HR, 1.45), as well as emphysema and chronic bronchitis
(HR, 1.68), represent additional predictors of increased
risk for cardiac dysfunction.29 The risk of HF remains
higher for patients who receive anthracyclines compared
with those who receive other agents, even after excluding
elderly patients and those with relevant comorbidities.18,29
Cancer treatment-induced HF occurs with several other
traditional chemotherapeutic agents, including cyclophos-
phamide
(7%-28%)21and
docetaxel
(2.3%-8%)26
(Table 1).30-44 The potential for permanent cardiac dam-
age with exposure to anthracyclines has led to the adop-
tion, in some clinical settings (ie, early stage breast
cancer), of chemotherapy regimens with lower cumulative
anthracycline exposure.
Many targeted therapies, particularly monoclonal anti-
bodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), targeting
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) (ie,
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, etc), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptors (ie, bevacizumab,
sunitinib, sorafenib, etc), and Abl kinase activity (ie, imati-
nib, nilotinib, dasatinib, etc), have been demonstrated to
interfere with molecular pathways crucial to CV health.12,13
LVD associated with targeted therapies has been most
extensively evaluated in the breast cancer population treated
with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular
domain of the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ErbB2)/
HER2 and leads to reduced ErbB2 signaling via several
mechanisms. It has been speculated that the cardiac dys-
function associated with trastuzumab is a direct conse-
quence of ErbB2 inhibition in cardiomyocytes.15 Mice with
cardiac-specific deletion of ErbB2 develop dilated cardio-
myopathy and demonstrate exaggerated systolic dysfunc-
tion in response to pressure overload compared with
normal mice.15 Therefore, it would appear that ErbB2
receptor signaling is important in the maintenance of myo-
cardial function.15 In contrast to anthracycline-induced car-
diotoxicity, trastuzumab exposure can result in LVD and
HF that appears mostly reversible.45 At highest risk for car-
diotoxicity from trastuzumab exposure are those aged >50
years, patients with underlying heart disease or hyperten-
sion, those with baseline LVEF between 50% and 55% or
lower, and those who have also received anthracycline ther-
apy. The introduction of adjuvant trastuzumab for patients
with HER2-positive, early stage breast cancer has reduced
the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 50% and mortality by
33%.46 However, in the 5 major adjuvant trastuzumab trials
(summarized in Table 2),47-50 symptomatic, severe HF/car-
diac events, ranging from 0% to 3.9%, were observed with
the addition of trastuzumab to traditional chemother-
apy.51-53 Long-term follow-up of the pivotal adjuvant trials
have demonstrated the cardiac safety of trastuzumab with
no substantial increase in CV events over 8 to 10 years,
even with longer term trastuzumab therapy.49,54 However,
it is difficult to generally define cardiac toxicity across stud-
ies, as criteria vary by trial. Current clinical trials in early
breast cancer are taking advantage of the role of dual
HER2 blockade, including the synergistic activity of pertu-
zumab and trastuzumab. To date, there has not been any
additional cardiac safety concern when those agents were
combined55,56; however, we await the results of a large, pro-
spective, randomized trial (Aphinity trial) exploring this
combination in the adjuvant setting.57 Two neoadjuvant
studies (Neosphere, Tryphaena) demonstrated higher path-
ological complete response rates in women with breast can-
cer treated with chemotherapy and dual HER2 blockade
(pertuzumab, trastuzumab) compared with chemotherapy

 and trastuzumab therapy alone. In the Tryphanea study,
the primary endpoint of cardiac safety was met, with a low
incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic LV systolic
dysfunction across all arms.58
Cardiac dysfunction has also been reported with angio-
genesis inhibitors, including bevacizumab (1.7%-3%) and
sunitinib (4%-11%).59 Inhibitors of VEGF receptors, such as
sunitinib and sorafenib, block several tyrosine kinase recep-
tors,52 thus making it difficult to identify which targets
mediate cardiotoxicity.59 Preclinical studies have associated
sunitinib therapy with LV systolic dysfunction related to the
inhibition of 50 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), a regulator of cardiomyocyte response to
stress.60 This inhibition leads to a condition of energy deple-
tion and consequent cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Mitochon-
drial dysfunction may explain the transient episodes of LV
systolic dysfunction observed in clinical practice. A marked
increase in systemic vasoconstriction, increasing the afterload
on a susceptible LV, provides another plausible explanation
for LV systolic dysfunction.61
The hypothesis of reversibility for cardiac damage is not
unique to toxic exposure from chemotherapy or targeted
agents, because the features of stunning or hibernation of
the myocardium are well established in cardiac physiol-
ogy.62 Myocyte injury may also be reversible if the extent of
damage has not met a threshold of irreversibility; if cell
death exceeds this threshold, then it will result in potential
permanent LV contractile dysfunction. The distinction
between reversible and irreversible cardiac dysfunction,
however, is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, if LVD is detected
early and appropriate HF-based treatment is instituted,
even anthracycline cardiac damage may be reversible.63
Hypertension
The TKIs, which include certain VEGF signaling path-
way (VSP) inhibitors, such as sorafenib and sunitinib,
commonly
cause
hypertension.64
Although
these
are
effective anticancer agents, their clinical use may be lim-
ited by their potential negative impact on CV health.
Hypertension
is
the
most
frequent
cardiotoxicity
observed with VSP inhibitors, with a reported incidence
of 19% to 47% (see Table 3).60,65-76 The mechanisms of
hypertension induced by VSP inhibitors have recently
been reviewed15 and include: reduced nitric oxide pro-
duction in the wall of arterioles, increased endothelin-1
production, and capillary rarefaction that results in the
reduction of effective capillary beds.12,77 In addition,
VSP inhibitor-induced hypertension is perhaps related to
VEGF-mediated suppression of nephrin, a transmem-
brane protein that is important for the maintenance of
the glomerular slit diaphragm, which may contribute to
proteinuria seen with this class of drugs. Strategies to
attenuate or prevent VSP inhibitor-induced hypertension
are necessary to prevent cardiac dysfunction and early
termination of effective anticancer therapy.
Vascular Thrombosis and Ischemia
Several of the newer TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponati-
nib) that have revolutionized the treatment of some hemato-
logic cancers appear to be associated with important vascular
events.78,79 There is also an increased rate of thrombotic
adverse events in patients treated with combination therapy
for multiple myeloma that includes dexamethasone, revlimid,
and proteasome inhibitors like carfilzomib.80,81 The nature

 of these events varies, depending on the exact agent used and
the severity of the hematologic malignancy being treated.
The range of vascular problems is related to the vascular beds
affected. For instance, dasatinib rarely induces pleural effu-
sions or pulmonary hypertension,82 although the vascular
issues noted with nilotinib are completely different and likely
represent progressive atherosclerosis.83,84 In addition, combi-
nation therapies used in myeloma may increase the risk of
venous and arterial thrombotic events.85 Overall, it is fair
to say that these myriad vascular complications are impor-
tant and ultimately require specific strategies to manage
them effectively.
Rhythm Disturbances and QTc Prolongation
Cancer therapies may be associated with a variety of
rhythm disturbances but most notably can prolong the QT
interval, potentially leading to ventricular arrhythmias. The
use of some medications used in supportive care during
cancer therapy (eg, antiemetics, antidepressants) in combi-
nation with cancer treatments can lead to QT prolongation.
A careful review of drug interactions should be considered
the standard of care for all patients receiving cancer treat-
ment.86 There are specific therapies that have been associ-
ated with certain rhythm disturbances, but the mechanism
for this association is frequently related to electrolyte
abnormalities or concomitant medications that occur in a
particular population. Potential QT interval changes may
be related to the pharmacologic targets, but this association
is difficult to prove.86-88 In general, electrolyte abnormal-
ities should be carefully managed, and concomitant medica-
tions should be chosen that have minimal impact on
rhythm disturbances.
Radiotherapy-Induced CV Damage
The association of radiotherapy (RT) and cardiac dysfunc-
tion is well recognized. Radiation-associated cardiac inju-
ries are especially important in young patients with curable
malignancies, in whom the risk of developing clinically sig-
nificant late cardiotoxicity is high. The development of CV
damage after RT may be progressive and can include coro-
nary artery disease, valvular disease, myocardium damage,
defects in the conduction system, and diastolic dysfunc-
tion.89 The relative risk of fatal CV events after mediastinal
irradiation for Hodgkin disease and for left-sided breast
cancer, which are the two most common reasons for RT in
young patients, is between 2.0 and 7.0 and between 1.0 and
2.2, respectively.89-91 In addition, it is worth highlighting
that these data may not reflect contemporary radiation
treatment protocols, because RT methods have significantly
changed over time. Damage to the arterial endothelium can
induce premature atherosclerosis in the coronary circula-
tion, particularly in the left anterior descending and right
coronary arteries.90 This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after
RT. Acute pericarditis and either symptomatic or asymp-
tomatic chronic pericardial effusion may appear 6 to 12
months after RT. Stenosis and regurgitation of mitral and
aortic valves have been reported. Fibrosis of the conduction
system with disturbed heart rate and heart block (either
complete or incomplete) may also occur. These late
radiation-induced cardiac effects have been seen with doses
from 30 to 40 grays.91 Newer RT techniques, including
3-dimensional (3D) treatment planning with dose-volume
histograms to precisely calculate both heart volume and
dose, should decrease the risk of direct cardiac damage.89-91
The prone position and deep inspiration breath hold are
also commonly used as techniques. Models to predict the

 complication probability (NTCP) method, which takes
into account the dose and the volume of normal tissues that
are subject to radiation exposure.92 The NTCP model pre-
dicts the correlation between the given dose and the risk of
cardiac mortality within 15 years after RT.93
Detection of Cardiac Dysfunction and
Evidence for Cardiotoxicity
Echocardiographic Imaging
Echocardiography,
particularly
2-dimensional
imaging
(2D-Echo), is the most commonly used imaging technique
to monitor cardiac function during and after chemotherapy.
It is a widely available, reproducible, noninvasive modality
that permits safe, serial assessment of cardiac function.
There are many technical limitations to any technique, and
2D-Echo is no exception. Recent reviews have detailed
these
considerations.94
Common
parameters
that
are
followed include LVEF and myocardial strain.
LVEF
LVEF is the most commonly accepted parameter of cardiac
function that independently predicts short-term and long-
term mortality from CV events, including myocardial
infarction, ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy, as well
as anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.95-99 However,
the measurement of LVEF presents several challenges
related to image quality, assumption of LV geometry, load
dependency, and expertise. Moreover, LVEF measurement
remains a relatively insensitive tool for detecting cardiotox-
icity at an early stage.100 This is largely because a decrease
in LVEF does not occur until a critical amount of myocar-
dial damage has taken place and cardiac compensatory
mechanisms are exhausted. Interestingly, in a recent study
involving a large, predominantly breast cancer population
treated with anthracyclines, prospective and close monitor-
ing of LVEF with standard 2D-Echo during the first 12
months after the completion of chemotherapy allowed early
detection of almost all cases of cardiotoxicity (98%), and
prompt treatment led to normalization of cardiac function
in most cases (82%). In this study, candidate variables were
age, sex, CV risk factors, cumulative anthracycline dose,
mediastinal RT, left chest RT, body mass index, and year
of recruitment; and baseline and final (at the end of chemo-
therapy) LVEF measurements were collected. LVEF at the
end of chemotherapy was an independent predictor of fur-
ther development of cardiotoxicity.101
However, only 11% of patients had a full recovery—ie,
showed an LVEF value equal to or better than the baseline
value (before chemotherapy initiation); in the remaining
89% of patients, cardiac function was below the baseline
value. This evidence suggests that strategies aimed at pre-
venting the development of LVD appear strategically more
effective than therapy interventions aimed at counteracting
existing damage, which can be progressive and irreversible
in many cases.
Diastolic dysfunction
may precede
LVEF
reduction
in patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.101
Accordingly, abnormal diastolic filling without evidence of
LVEF decrease has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-
treated patients.102 However, no diastolic parameters have
been proven to definitively predict cardiotoxicity, and the role
of diastolic dysfunction in screening for the detection of early
subclinical cardiotoxicity currently remains controversial.
Myocardial strain
Newer technology has emerged that allows for an improve-
ment in the accuracy of calculating LVEF. One of the most
promising is strain-echocardiography. Strain is a measure-
ment of myocardial deformation. As the ventricle contracts,
muscle shortens in the longitudinal and circumferential
dimensions and thickens and lengthens in the radial direc-
tion. Strain imaging can provide an assessment of global
and regional cardiac function and can be measured using
either tissue Doppler or 2D-based methods.103 Several
small studies evaluating tissue Doppler and LV strain rate
imaging have detected early subclinical changes in cardiac
function that preceded a decrease in LVEF.104-106 By using
tissue Doppler-based strain imaging, a common measure-
ment known as the peak systolic longitudinal strain rate can
be used to reliably recognize most early myocardial defor-
mation variations during anticancer therapy; whereas, with
speckle tracking echocardiography, an advancement of
strain imaging, peak systolic global longitudinal strain
(GLS) would appear to be the most accurate measure. A
10% to 15% early decrease in GLS by speckle tracking
echocardiography during therapy seems to be the most use-
ful parameter for the early detection of cardiotoxicity,
defined as a drop in LVEF or HF.103 However, currently,
long-term data on large populations confirming the clinical
significance of such changes are not available. Moreover,
there are currently important limitations of these techni-
ques: data analysis is currently offline, time-consuming, and
still depends on the quality of the acoustic windows. In
addition, different echo machines and software packages
may yield different strain results, making them difficult to
compare. Consequently, these new echo imaging techni-
ques are not typically included in a routine assessment of
cardiac function during chemotherapy.94
The role of other imaging techniques
Multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans can limit inter-
observer variability in assessing LVEF, but it has the disad-
vantages of exposing the patient to radiation and provides
limited information on cardiac structure and diastolic func-
tion. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered to be the
CA CANCER J CLIN 2016;66:309–325
VOLUME 66 _ NUMBER 4 _ JULY/AUGUST 2016
315
 gold standard for the evaluation of cardiac volumes, mass,
and both systolic and diastolic function. However, because
of high cost and lack of availability, this imaging modality
is not routinely used.103,105
Cardiac Biomarkers
A strategy based on the use of biochemical markers, in par-
ticular cardiac troponins, has developed in the last 15 years
for early real-time identification, assessment, and monitoring
of antitumor drug-induced cardiotoxicity. This approach
negates the interobserver variability reported with strategies
using imaging; but, unfortunately, the exact timing of bio-
marker measurement and the variability in techniques have
not been adequately determined.103,107,108
Troponins
Cardiac troponins are regulatory proteins within the myo-
cardium that are released into the circulation when damage
to the myocyte has occurred.109 Troponins are the first
blood biomarkers identified to detect cardiac damage. They
are medium-sized proteins regulating the contractile ele-
ments actin and myosin. Although they are normally unde-
tectable, troponins may increase within 2 or 3 hours after
cardiac damage occurs.110-112 Studies have shown that tro-
ponins may detect cardiotoxicity at a preclinical phase, long
before any reduction in LVEF has occurred, in patients
treated with antitumor drugs (Table 4).104,108,110,113-130
Measurement of troponins may provide additional infor-
mation, including:
1. Prediction of the severity of future LVD, because the
peak value of troponin after chemotherapy is closely
correlated to the extent of LVEF reduction;
2. Stratification of cardiac risk after chemotherapy, which
allows for the personalization of the intensity of post-
chemotherapy monitoring of cardiac function;
3. Selection of patients more prone to develop cardiotox-
icity, in whom a cardioprotective therapy can be con-
sidered; and
4. Exclusion of most patients from prolonged cardiologic
monitoring.
In a study of 703 predominantly breast cancer patients,
troponin I (TnI) was assessed before chemotherapy, during
the 3 days after the end of chemotherapy (early evaluation),
and after 1 month (late evaluation).110 Three different tro-
ponin release patterns were identified. TnI was regularly
within the normal range in 70% of patients, increased only
at early evaluation in 21%, and increased at both early and
late evaluations in 9%. Patients without a TnI increase after
chemotherapy showed no significant reduction in LVEF
and had a low incidence of cardiac events (1%) during the

 >3-year follow-up. In contrast, TnI-positive patients had a
greater incidence of major adverse cardiac events. In partic-
ular, among TnI-positive patients, the persistence of the
TnI rise 1 month after chemotherapy was associated with a
greater LVEF reduction and a higher incidence of cardiac
events compared with patients who had only a transient
increase in the marker (84% vs 37%; P < .001). An addi-
tional study in leukemia patients suggested that a troponin
elevation may identify those at risk for LVD.131
High-sensitivity troponins
Recent improvements in assay technology have led to more
sensitive and precise troponin assays. These new high-
sensitivity (HS) assays can now reliably measure small
increases that are undetectable by using other troponin
assays.132 The most recent study in which HS troponin was
assessed was that by Ky et al,108 who investigated the associ-
ation between multiple biomarker increases and successive
development of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients being
treated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.108 In
that study, however, the most important risk of cardiotoxic-
ity was associated with HS TnI change in absolute values at
the end of anthracycline treatments as well an increase in
myeloperoxidase, a marker of oxidative stress.
Natriuretic peptides
Increased
natriuretic
peptide
(NP)
levels
can
detect
chemotherapy-induced LVD in both adult and pediatric
populations.133,134 Unfortunately, many studies failed to
find a correlation between the increase in NP and the devel-
opment of cardiac dysfunction, probably because significant
volume changes can occur in patients who are receiving
chemotherapy without any significant change in LVEF. It
is noteworthy that, when considering only the two most
used NPs—B-type NP (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP
(NT-proBNP)—the significant differences in analytical
characteristics and measured values among the most widely
used commercial methods underline that clinicians must be
careful and cautious when comparing results obtained by
laboratories that use different methods. Understanding the
utility of NP as an adjunct to clinical care in patients being
treated with potential cardiotoxic therapy is necessary.135
New prospective and multicenter studies that include large
populations, using well standardized methods for dosage,
and with well defined timing of sampling and cardiac end-
points are paramount to clarify the appropriate use of NP
and to interpret the results in the clinical context.
An Integrated Approach of Markers and
Cardiac Imaging
An integrated approach combining biomarkers as well as
imaging data may yield progressive utility in predicting subse-
quent cardiotoxicity. In a recent multicenter study, HS tropo-
nins, NT-pro-BNP, ST2 (interleukin 1 receptor-like 1),
LVEF, and echocardiographic parameters of myocardial
deformation were used to detect LVD in patients receiving
anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Decreases in peak
longitudinal strain and increases in HS TnI concentrations at
the completion of the anthracycline treatment were predictive
of subsequent LVD. The combined assessment of the two
endpoints showed an improved specificity (93%) compared
with either parameter alone (both 73%).124 However, this
result was associated with a reduction in sensitivity to 35%.126
Other Proposed Biomarkers
Other potential markers of cardiotoxicity have been investi-
gated in small studies. These include markers of endothelial
dysfunction (tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasmino-
gen activator inhibitor type 1, soluble intercellular adhesion
molecule-1, and circulating endothelial cells), markers of
myocardial ischemia (fatty acid binding protein), as well as
markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (glutathione
peroxidase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleu-
kins).132,133 Although many of these proposed biomarkers
have shown significant changes during chemotherapy, the
impact of these changes on cardiac function are unknown;
thus, further research is needed.136
In summary, a novel approach based on the use of cardiac
biomarkers has emerged in the last decade, resulting in a
promising, cost-effective diagnostic tool for early, real-time
identification, assessment, and monitoring of cardiotoxicity.
Further trials are necessary to confirm their use in clinical prac-
tice. Standardization of the use of routine biomarkers in this
clinical setting is a current unmet need, and future larger, pro-
spective, multicenter studies should provide clear indications
of the appropriate use of these biomarkers in clinical practice.
Management of Anticancer Drug-Related
Cardiotoxicity
The Role of Cardioprotective Therapy for
Prevention
The cardioprotective effects of many pharmacologic agents
have been demonstrated during cancer therapy in a laboratory
setting; however, most of these agents have not been proven
to be cardioprotective for cancer treatment-related cardiotox-
icity. Several agents—dexrazozane, beta-blockers, angiotensin
antagonists, statins, and aldosterone antagonists—have been
shown to be potentially cardioprotective in patients exposed
to anthracyclines or trastuzumab (Table 5).137-146
Dexrazoxane
Dexrazoxane significantly reduces anthracycline-related car-
diotoxicity in adults with different solid tumors and in
children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Ewing sar-
coma.147-149 There is a large amount of evidence that
CA CANCER J CLIN 2016;66:309–325
VOLUME 66 _ NUMBER 4 _ JULY/AUGUST 2016
317
 patients who received dexrazoxane had a decreased incidence
of HF compared with those who did not receive the drug.
Despite these consistent positive findings, the use of dexra-
zoxane has not been widely adopted, and it is recommended
as a cardioprotectant by the American Society of Clinical
Oncology (ASCO) only in patients with metastatic breast
cancer who have already received more than 300 mg/m2 of
doxorubicin.150 This might be explained by the suspicion—
never confirmed—of interference with the efficacy of anthra-
cyclines, by the occurrence of secondary malignancies, or by
its possible additive effects of myelosuppression.
Beta-blockers
Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with antioxidant
activity that is considered crucial in the treatment of
patients with HF and LVD, is an effective cardioprotective
agent during doxorubicin treatment.151 This effect was
confirmed in a randomized study in which prophylactic
use of the drug protected both systolic and diastolic LV
function in a small population of anthracycline-treated
patients.141 The protective effect of nebivolol, a beta-selective
beta-blocker with a nitric oxide donor capacity, has also been
demonstrated to be beneficial in a recent randomized study of
47 breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-therapy142;
notably, LVEF and NT-proBNP remained unchanged after 6
months in patients who received nebivolol. Conversely, in the
placebo group, a significant decrease in LVEF and an increase
in NT-proBNP were observed.142
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers
The possible role of telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor
blocker, in preventing myocardial injury induced by epirubi-
cin was evaluated by Cadeddu et al139 in a randomized trial
that included 49 patients with a variety of solid cancers.139
Twenty-five patients who started telmisartan 1 week before
chemotherapy showed no significant reductions in myocar-
dial deformation parameters (peak strain rate), as evaluated
using a tissue Doppler echo technique, and no significant rise
in ROS or interleukin-6, as found in 24 control patients.139
These results suggest that telmisartan might protect against
epirubicin-induced ROS production and inhibit the genera-
tion of inflammation, thus preventing the development of
early myocardial impairment.139 The cardioprotective effects
of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
(ACE-I), were studied in a randomized, controlled trial that
included 473 patients (53% had breast cancer) treated with
high-dose anthracyclines.137 One-hundred fourteen patients
(24%) showed an early troponin increase and were random-
ized to receive enalapril or no treatment. Enalapril was
started 1 month after the end of chemotherapy and contin-
ued for 1 year. In the enalapril-treated group, LVEF did not
change during the follow-up period. Conversely, in patients
who did not receive enalapril, a progressive decrease in
LVEF and an increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic vol-
umes were observed. Moreover, enalapril-treated patients
had a significantly lower incidence of adverse cardiac events
compared with controls at 1-year follow-up (2% vs 52%;
P < .001).137
The preventive effects of combined enalapril and carvedilol
recently were tested in a randomized trial of 90 patients with
hematologic malignancies who were treated with anthracy-
clines.144 After 6 months, LVEF did not change in the inter-
vention group; conversely, LVEF significantly decreased in
controls (P 5 .035). Importantly, compared with controls,

 patients in the intervention group had a lower incidence of
the combined event of death or HF (6.7% vs 22%; P 5 .036)
or of death, HF, and a final LVEF below 45% (7% vs 24%;
P 5 .02).144
Statins
Statins exert antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and other
pleiotropic effects in addition to reducing low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) cholesterol. In an animal model, it was
demonstrated that pretreatment with fluvastatin blunted
anthracycline-induced toxicity, reducing oxidative stress,
enhancing the expression of antioxidative enzyme mito-
chondrial superoxide-dismutase-2, and limiting cardiac
inflammation.153 In a retrospective case-control study, 67
women with breast cancer treated with anthracyclines who
also were receiving a statin drug were compared with 134
matched controls.146 Women treated with statins showed a
lower incidence of HF at a mean of 2.5 years of follow-
up.146 Finally, in a small clinical trial of 40 patients who
had
normal
LVEF
before
undergoing
chemotherapy
(which included anthracyclines), the 6-month LVEF value
was unchanged among patients treated with atorvastatin
compared with an 8% absolute decrease in controls.145
Aldosterone antagonists
Aldosterone antagonism has been evaluated in a very recent
trial that included 83 patients with breast cancer who were
randomized to spironolactone or placebo and a concomitant
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy control groups.140
During at least 24 weeks of treatment, including 3 weeks
after completing anthracycline-containing chemotherapy,
spironolactone prevented a decrease in LVEF, blunted the
increase in TnI and NT-proBNP, and preserved diastolic
function.140
Ongoing Studies
Currently, several studies are ongoing to evaluate CV drugs
as cardioprotectant agents. The MANTICORE-101 (Mul-
tidisciplinary Approach to Novel Therapies in Cardiology
Oncology Research) trial is evaluating the use of perindo-
pril versus bisoprolol in patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer who are undergoing treatment with trastuzumab in
the prevention of LVD as assessed by cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging.154 At the end of trastuzumab therapy,
neither drug had an impact on LV end-diastolic volume
(the primary outcome of change from baseline in the study).
In univariate analysis, only bisoprolol was associated with
preservation of baseline function (from 62% to 61%; sec-
ondary outcome). However, in multivariate analysis, the use
of both cardiac drugs significantly predicted preserved
LV function (for perindopril, P 5 .013; for bisoprolol, P <
.001). These data were presented during the 2015 San
Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.
The PRADA (Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction Dur-
ing Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy) trial is assessing
whether the use of candesartan, metoprolol, or their combi-
nation can prevent the development of LVD in patients on
adjuvant epirubicin-containing chemotherapy with or with-
out trastuzumab.155 The results demonstrated that cande-
sartan—but not metoprolol—concomitantly administrated
with adjuvant chemotherapy, including epirubicin with or
without trastuzumab, can protect against early decline in
LVEF, assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance.
The International Cardioncology Society (ICOS)-ONE
trial is the only randomized study that is designed to com-
pare the use of enalapril administration concomitantly with
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (primary prevention)
versus enalapril administration after preclinical cardiotoxic-
ity detection, as revealed by the increase in troponins (sec-
ondary prevention; national clinical trial NCT01968200;
clinicaltrials.gov).
In the NCT01708798 study (clinicaltrials.gov), the
potential ability of the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone to
prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity will be explored
in a randomized controlled trial of breast cancer patients.
Finally, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an
ongoing randomized trial (NCT02177175; clinicaltrials.gov)
is assessing the use of carvedilol for the prevention of anthra-
cycline/trastuzumab therapy-associated cardiotoxicity among
women with HER2-positive breast cancer using myocardial
strain for early risk stratification. In this trial, carvedilol is
started in women who show an absolute decrease in GLS
below 19% or in those who have a decrease �11% from base-
line. It is hoped that the findings from these trials will pro-
vide important insights into the best strategy for managing
cardiotoxicity induced by anticancer drugs.
Treatment
The Role of ACE-I and Beta-Blockers
Limited data exist regarding the treatment of patients with
antitumor drug-associated cardiomyopathy. Typically, these
patients have been excluded from large randomized trials
evaluating the effectiveness of HF therapies. The use of
ACE-I and beta-blocking agents in this particular clinical
setting were first evaluated in a very few retrospective studies,
which involved small populations (Table 6).45,63,99,101,156-163
More recently, the effectiveness of ACE-I and beta-blockers
were prospectively assessed in this setting. In 201 consecutive
patients with anthracycline-induced LVD, enalapril (com-
bined with carvedilol when possible) was initiated at the time
of LVEF impairment detection and was up-titrated to the
maximal tolerated dose.63 The investigators found that the
time elapsed from the end of chemotherapy to the start of
HF therapy was a crucial variable for the recovery of cardiac
function. Indeed, among patients who were treated within

 2 months after the end of chemotherapy, 64% had a com-
plete recovery of LVEF. Conversely, after 2 months, the per-
centage of patients who recovered progressively decreased,
with no complete recovery seen after 6 months.63 Consistent
with these findings, a greater improvement in cardiac func-
tion was observed in a large population of patients with
anthracycline-induced LVD who were receiving a combina-
tion of enalapril and carvedilol or bisoprolol. Initiation of
HF medications promptly after the detection of symptomatic
and asymptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy
was associated with recovery in 82% of patients over a mean
period of 8 6 5 months. Long-term studies are needed to
determine if therapy with ACE-I and beta-blockers should
be prolonged lifelong, or discontinued after achievement of
complete recovery of LVEF.
QTc Prolongation Management
Prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
can
lead
to
life-
threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including “torsade de
pointes.” Although prolongation of the QT interval is not
the best predictor of proarrhythmic risk, it represents the
principal clinical surrogate marker by which to evaluate the
arrhythmic risk of a drug and has led to withdrawal of sev-
eral anticancer drugs from the market. Although drugs
leading to prolonged QT may possess significant risks of
serious adverse events, the clinical benefit of therapy in the
oncologic setting, including the possibility of cure for a
cancer patient, may outweigh the potential risks of QTc
prolongation, even when the prolongation is significant.
Patients with a history of QT interval prolongation;
patients who are taking antiarrhythmics; or patients with
relevant CVD, bradycardia, thyroid dysfunction, or electro-
lyte disturbances should be screened and monitored.
Periodic monitoring with on-treatment electrocardiograms
and electrolytes should be considered.163,164
Hypertension Treatment and Management
A collaboration between oncologists, a primary care health
care provider, and cardiologists is essential to properly
monitor and manage hypertension, which is an unwanted
adverse effect of many antiangiogenic agents associated
with VSP inhibition. Aggressive management of hyperten-
sion beginning from the initiation of therapy is important
to avoid cardiac dysfunction; and, again, an understanding
of the potential cardiac toxicities of the chemotherapeutic
regimen used is essential, giving further support to the con-
cept of a multidisciplinary strategy for management.
Patients who are candidates for treatment with VEGF/
TKI inhibitors should be considered at higher risk for CV
complications if they have systolic blood pressure (BP)
�160 mm Hg or diastolic BP �100 mm Hg; diabetes mel-
litus; established CV disease, including any history of ische-
mic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or transient ischemic
attack; myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revasculari-
zation, or HF; peripheral artery disease; subclinical organ
damage previously documented by electrocardiogram or
2D-Echo revealing LV hypertrophy; cigarette smoking;
and dyslipidemia. Repeated BP measurements and aggres-
sive management of BP elevations are recommended to
prevent clinically limiting complications.79,164,165
Anticoagulation in Cancer Patients
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of
morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Patients receiving
chemotherapy or antiangiogenic agents have a 7-fold higher
risk
of
developing
VTE
compared
with
patients

Cardiotoxicity of Anticancer Treatments

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 without cancer. Several randomized trials have demon-
strated a significant thromboprophylactic effect of low-
molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in ambulatory cancer
patients who are receiving chemotherapy.166,167 However,
routine thromboprophylaxis is currently not recommended
for ambulatory cancer patients by ASCO because of the
limited
absolute
risk
reduction
demonstrated
with
LMWH and the concern with bleeding complications.
The prophylactic use of LMWH may be considered for
highly selected, high-risk patients only, according to the
risk-assessment model validated by Khorana et al167 (Table
7), ie, in patients with scores �3 and a low bleeding
risk.167,168 Data about the new oral anticoagulants (dabiga-
tran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) for either prophylaxis or treat-
ment of VTE in patients with cancer are still limited, and
their use is currently not recommended (ASCO).168
Conclusions
Modern cancer treatment strategies have led to a significant
improvement in the chances of surviving a diagnosis of can-
cer for many years. These gains in overall outcome may be
offset by the potential negative impact of cancer therapy on
CV health. Cancer therapies may have short-term and
long-term side effects involving the heart and circulation,
as well as exacerbating and/or unmasking existing heart dis-
ease. The development of CV disease during the course of
cancer treatment can adversely impact the management of
the underlying malignancy by interfering with the optimal
doses and timing of lifesaving cancer therapy. In addition,
the development of a potentially important cancer therapy

 may be halted or abandoned because of a perceived
increased CV risk. The discipline of cardio-oncology has
developed in response to the combined decision making
necessary to optimize the care of patients with cancer,
whether they are receiving active treatment or are long-
term survivors after successful treatment (Fig. 1). Cardiol-
ogy and oncology organizations around the world (ie,
European Society for Medical Oncology, American Col-
lege of Cardiology, ASCO, European Society of Cardiol-
ogy, Canadian Cardiovascular Society) are now recognizing
the importance of this collaboration, resulting in the
ongoing development of several clinical practice guidelines
and position statements.94,164,165 Although these initiatives
will provide important guidance for clinicians on best prac-
tices for patients today, many questions remain unan-
swered:
How
can
we
predict
who
will
develop
cardiotoxicity, what is the best prevention strategy, how
should we monitor those at risk of cardiotoxicity, and what
are the best management strategies? There is an urgent
need for collaborative research to address these questions.
Vibrant collaborative partnerships between oncologists, car-
diologists, and other allied health care professionals will
play an important role in the development and promotion
of clinical care models, educational programs (for patients
and health care providers), and evidence-based research to
improve the care of patients being treated for cancer. �
