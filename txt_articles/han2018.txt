visual cortex

While the inputs received by a neuron drive its activity, its axonal 
projections determine its effects on other neurons. The axons of 
excitatory projection neurons that reside in layers 2 and 3 (hereafter 
2/3), and 5 and 6 of the neocortex are the main conduit by which 
signals are exchanged between cortical areas1. To date, no study has, 
to our knowledge, systematically investigated the principles by which 
individual neurons in any region of the mammalian neocortex dis-
tribute information to their targets. This knowledge is fundamental 
for deducing the logic of the communication between areas, for con-
straining hypotheses about neural function and for the identification 
of putative sub-classes of neurons. Anatomical studies in macaques, 
cats and mice, which are mostly based on retrograde tracing meth-
ods, indicate that there is an abundance of intracortical projection 
neurons in the sensory neocortex, which have axons that appear 
to innervate single target areas2–6, raising the possibility that infor-
mation may be distributed through ensembles of dedicated path-
ways that are functionally tailored to each target6–12. For example, 
neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) that innervate the 
 
posteromedial (PM) or anterolateral (AL) area appear to match the 
spatial and temporal frequency preference of these target areas7,13,14. 
Similarly, neurons in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex 
that project to either the primary motor cortex or the secondary 
 
somatosensory area comprise largely non-overlapping populations 
with distinct physiological and functional properties6,9,10. These 
findings indicate that dedicated lines—specialized subpopulations of 
neurons that preferentially target a single downstream area (Fig. 1a, 
left)—may represent a fundamental mode of cortico-cortical com-
munication. Alternatively, intracortically projection neurons could 
broadcast to multiple targets4,5,15–19, either randomly (Fig. 1a, middle) 
 
or by targeting specific sets of areas (Fig. 1a, right). These three models 
of cortical architecture have different implications for communica-
tion between areas underlying sensory processing in hierarchical net-
works. To distinguish between these models, we used two anterograde 
 
anatomical approaches, whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal trac-
ing and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded 
neurons (MAPseq), to map the long-range axonal projection patterns 
of individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex, an area 
that distributes visual information to multiple cortical and subcortical 
targets20–22.
Fluorescence-based tracing of single neurons
We first traced the projections of single neurons using whole-brain 
fluorescence-based axonal reconstructions. We used single-cell electro-
poration of a GFP-encoding plasmid to label up to six layer-2/3 cells in 
the right visual cortex of each mouse. After allowing 3–10 days for GFP 
expression, we imaged the axonal projections of the labelled neurons 
by whole-brain serial two-photon tomography with 1 × 1 × 10-μm3 
resolution23,24 (Fig. 1b). We then traced each fluorescently labelled cell 
(n = 71; Fig. 1c, d) and registered each brain to the Allen Reference 
Atlas25 (Fig. 1e, f). To assess axonal labelling with GFP, we electro-
porated neurons labelled retrogradely from the ipsilateral striatum, 
and in all cases observed axonal terminations therein (n = 9/9 cells; 
Extended Data Fig. 1), indicating a low false-negative rate of filling axon 
collaterals in distal targets of V1 neurons. Nonetheless, to minimize 
any possible contribution of incomplete axonal filling, we excluded 
those reconstructed V1 neurons with axon collaterals beyond V1 that 
terminated abruptly without branching (n = 28; Extended Data Fig. 2 
 
and Supplementary Note 1), although the results below are robust 
to the inclusion of these cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We did not 
exclude neurons with abrupt terminations of contralaterally projecting 
branches (see also ref. 6), instead restricting our analysis to ipsilaterally 
projecting axons.
We analysed the ipsilateral projection patterns of 38 pyramidal neu-
rons in layer 2/3, including 31 neurons in area V1 (Fig. 1g and Extended 
Data Figs 3, 4) and 7 neurons in nearby higher visual areas (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). Inspection of individual axonal arborizations of V1 
 
Neocortical areas communicate through extensive axonal projections, but the logic of information transfer remains poorly 
understood, because the projections of individual neurons have not been systematically characterized. It is not known 
whether individual neurons send projections only to single cortical areas or distribute signals across multiple targets. Here 
we determine the projection patterns of 591 individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex using whole-brain 
fluorescence-based axonal tracing and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq). 
Projections were highly diverse and divergent, collectively targeting at least 18 cortical and subcortical areas. Most 
neurons targeted multiple cortical areas, often in non-random combinations, suggesting that sub-classes of intracortical 
projection neurons exist. Our results indicate that the dominant mode of intracortical information transfer is not based on 
‘one neuron–one target area’ mapping. Instead, signals carried by individual cortical neurons are shared across subsets 
of target areas, and thus concurrently contribute to multiple functional pathways.

the number and identity of target areas (Fig. 1g and Extended Data 
 
Figs 3, 4), whereas this diversity was not clear in the bulk projection 
data20,21 (Fig. 1g, top left).
Almost all layer-2/3 cells projected out of V1 (97%, n = 30/31; Fig. 1h)

registration and from subject-to-subject variability in the bounda-
ries between brain areas, we excluded low-confidence buffer zones of 
100 μm around the area boundaries from analysis, and included only 
those areas that received over 1 mm of axonal input from an individ-
ual cell as targets (see Methods). Eighty-five per cent of all projection

patterns appeared only once, highlighting the diversity of long-range 
projections.
The majority of reconstructed layer-2/3 projection neurons sent 
axon collaterals to more than one target area (77%, n = 23/30), with 
some targeting up to seven areas (Fig. 1j). Although individual neurons 
innervated different target areas with different axonal densities, and 
thus might influence the computations in one area more than another, 
we found that a large fraction of ‘broadcasting’ cells innervated more 
than one target with comparable strengths (Fig. 1k). Moreover, the total 
length of axons scaled with the number of target areas (average length 
per brain area = 4.6 ± 2.2 mm), such that the innervation density per 
target was, on average, similar irrespective of how many targets an 
axon innervated (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). The innervation in higher 
visual areas was most dense in layers 2/3 and 5, consistent with recent 
reports26,27, often recapitulating the pattern of lateral axonal projections 
of layer-2/3 cells within V1 (Extended Data Fig. 6c–h).
Posterior, postrhinal (POR), lateromedial (LM) and PM visual areas 
were the most common targets of V1 neurons (Fig. 1l). Even when 
the analysis was restricted to neurons that projected to at least one of 
the six nearby cortical visual areas (laterointermediate (LI), LM, AL, 
PM, anteromedial (AM) or rostrolateral (RL)), we found that half of 
these neurons projected to two or more of these areas (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 7a–e). The fraction of input provided by dedicated projection 
 
neurons to any area comprised no more than 25% of the total input 
(Fig. 1m), and most target areas received no dedicated input. These 
conclusions were robust to changes in the size of the border exclu-
sion zone between neighbouring areas and the minimum projection 
strength in the target area (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h). Similar to projec-
tions from V1, all seven reconstructed neurons, which had cell bodies 
that resided in nearby higher visual areas, also projected to more than 
one target area (Extended Data Fig. 5). Our results thus show that most 
layer-2/3 neurons distribute information to multiple areas, rather than 
project to single targets.
Interestingly, the location of the cell body within V1 was predictive of 
projection target for some recipient areas (Extended Data Fig. 8). Given 
the retinotopic organization of V1, this suggests that visual information 
from different parts of visual field may be preferentially distributed to 
specific target areas, which is consistent with recent findings28.
High-throughput MAPseq tracing
We next investigated whether broadcasting cells choose their cortical 
target areas independently, or whether they target specific subsets of 
areas. Although the targeting of different combinations of areas distin-
guishes individual V1 projection neurons (Fig. 1), their classification 
into putative sub-types requires a demonstration of higher-order pro-
jectional structure within the population. We define the higher-order 
structure in terms of the connection patterns predicted by the per- 
neuron (first-order) probability of projecting to each target. For exam-
ple, if the probability of any given neuron projecting to area A is 0.5 
and the probability of projecting to area B is also 0.5 then we would 
expect P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.25 of all neurons to project to both 
A and B if the decision to target these areas is independent. Significant 
deviations from this expectation would indicate the organization of 
the projections into non-random projection motifs. Investigating the 
higher-order structure requires large datasets, because, if a sample size 
of n neurons is required to estimate the first-order probabilities, then 
a sample size of n2 is needed to estimate pairwise probabilities with 
comparable accuracy. Although single-neuron reconstruction provides 
very high spatial resolution, the tracing of axons remains highly labour 
intensive despite increases in throughput for data acquisition17,29.
We therefore used a higher-throughput strategy, MAPseq30, to 
obtain the required number of single-neuron projections for higher- 
order statistical analysis. In a MAPseq experiment, hundreds or thou-
sands of neurons are labelled uniquely with random RNA sequences 
(barcodes) by a single injection of a library of barcoded Sindbis viruses 
(Supplementary Note 2). The barcodes are expressed and then actively 
transported into the axonal processes of each labelled neuron, where 
they can be analysed by high-throughput barcode sequencing after 
dissection of potential target areas. The abundance of each barcode 
sequence in each area serves as a measure of the projection strength of 
the corresponding barcode-labelled neuron. MAPseq simultaneously 
maps the projections of all labelled neurons of dissected target areas, 
and therefore enables in-depth analysis of projections to a smaller set 
of targets.
We used MAPseq to map the projection patterns of 553 neurons 
from V1 to six higher visual areas—LI, LM, AL, AM, PM and RL—
that can be identified reliably by intrinsic signal imaging in vivo and 
dissected ex vivo for barcode sequencing (Fig. 2a, b, Extended Data 
Fig. 9 and Methods). To prevent the virus from spreading from V1 to 
adjacent areas, we made small focal injections of the MAPseq virus 
to yield 100–200 traced cells per mouse. Consistent with the analysis 
of fluorescence-based single-neuron reconstructions restricted to the 
six higher visual areas (Fig. 2c, left), almost half (44%) of all MAPseq 
neurons projected to more than one area (Fig. 2c, right). Furthermore, 
the projection patterns obtained by fluorescence-based tracing were 
statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by MAPseq (using 
a bootstrap procedure; see Supplementary Note 3), whereas randomly 
generated neurons with projection strengths sampled from a uniform 
distribution were markedly different (Fig. 2d). Therefore, the findings 
from the MAPseq dataset were consistent with those from the sin-
gle-neuron tracing dataset.
We first catalogued the diversity of single-neuron projection patterns 
from V1 to six higher visual areas by unsupervised clustering of the 
MAPseq dataset (k-means clustering with a cosine distance metric). 
These projectional data were best described by eight clusters (Fig. 2e, 
Extended Data Fig. 10), of which all but one contained cells targeting 
more than one area. The most common combination of broadcasting 
neurons involved areas LM and PM, consistent with the fact that a large 
fraction of neurons targeted these areas and the suggestion of LM22 and 
PM as integrative hubs of V1 signals, similar to the secondary visual 
cortex in the monkey (Fig. 2f).
To investigate whether non-random projection motifs existed in the 
MAPseq dataset, we measured the likelihood of specific bi-, tri- or 
quadrifurcations and compared them to their expected probabilities 
(assuming independence between each projection type; Fig. 3a, b). 
This analysis identified six projection motifs that were significantly 
over- or underrepresented after a correction for multiple compari-
sons (Bonferroni adjustment; Fig. 3b, c). Together, these six projection 
motifs represented 73% of all broadcasting cells that were identified by 
MAPseq. Therefore the majority of V1 cells projecting to multiple tar-
get areas do so in a non-random manner, suggesting that broadcasting 
motifs reflect several sub-classes of projection neurons for divergent 
information transfer from V1 to higher visual areas.
The most underrepresented broadcasting motif was the bifurcation 
between PM and AL (Fig. 3d). These two areas exhibit distinct visual 
response properties13,14 and receive functionally specialized input from 
V17, consistent with the idea of exclusive projections from V1 into these 
areas. Moreover, the underrepresented population of neurons, which 
project to both PM and AL, was further split into two groups according 
to projection strength; one population primarily innervates PM and 
another primarily innervates AL (Fig. 3d). A second underrepresented 
motif is the bifurcation between PM and LM (Fig. 3e). However, in 
contrast to the PM–AL bifurcation, the detected PM–LM-projection 
neurons do not clearly separate into two classes. Our findings therefore 
provide an anatomical substrate for the previously reported functional 
dichotomy of AL and PM areas, and suggest that a few ‘dedicated’ out-
put channels can co-exist with the prevalence of broadcasting cells that 
co-innervate multiple targets.
In addition to the two underrepresented projectional motifs, we 
identified four overrepresented motifs, that is, combinations of tar-
get areas that receive more shared input from individual V1 neurons 
than expected from first-order projection statistics (Fig. 3f–h). Cells

that innervated both PM and AM were significantly more abundant 
than expected by chance (Fig. 3f). Resolving the projection strengths 
within this motif revealed two subpopulations of neurons, one that 
innervates PM more than AM, the other innervates both areas with 
similar strength. Moreover, neurons bifurcating to LM and AL were 
also highly overrepresented (Fig. 3g) and comprised the most abun-
dant class of broadcasting cells (Fig. 3b). The most significantly over-
represented trifurcation motif was the projection to PM, LM and LI, 
comprising a relatively homogenous population that projects to LM 
and PM with similar strengths while projecting slightly less strongly to 
LI (Fig. 3h). Finally, we discovered that trifurcation between PM, AM 
and RL was overrepresented, but it appeared only rarely in our dataset 
(Fig. 3b). These motifs did not arise from false negatives (undetected 
connections) or false positives (Supplementary Note 4 and Extended 
Data Fig. 2f).
These projectional data have implications for the categorization of 
higher visual areas into putative streams of visual processing in mouse 
neocortex. Areas AL and PM on the one hand, and LM and LI on the 
other, have been suggested to belong to dorsal and ventral processing 
 
streams in the mouse visual system, respectively31–33. Given that these 
areas receive a high degree of shared input (for example, LM–PM 
bifurcation, which was still abundant even though it was underrep-
resented; AL–LM bifurcation; PM–LM–LI trifurcation), such a dis-
tinction is unlikely to originate as a result of segregated V1 input into 
these areas.
Discussion
In summary, our results reveal some of the principles by which single 
neurons in one cortical area distribute information to downstream 
 
target areas. Almost all layer-2/3 pyramidal cells projected outside of V1, 
indicating that V1 neurons concurrently participate in local and distal 
computations. We found that the single-neuron projections outside V1 
 
were highly diverse, innervating up to seven targets, predominantly 
in specific, non-random combinations (Extended Data Fig. 10g, f). 
These results suggest a functional specialization of subpopulations of 
projection cells beyond ‘one neuron–one target area’ mapping.
The fraction of neurons in V1 that broadcast information to multiple 
 
targets is considerably greater than has previously been indicated 
using retrograde tracing methods2,5,16. This difference is unlikely to 
be caused by differences in the sensitivity with which these approaches 
detect the projection patterns of individual cells. Instead, anterograde 
 
tracing maps projections to many or all targets simultaneously, whereas

retrograde tracing typically analyses only two or three potential target 
sites at a time. Because the fraction of neurons projecting to any pair of 
targets selected for retrograde tracing is relatively low (typically <10%), 
most neurons will not be doubly labelled in any given experiment; only 
by sampling many potential targets in a single experiment can the true 
prevalence of broadcasting be uncovered. Indeed, if we simulate dou-
ble retrograde tracing based on our MAPseq results, the fractions of 
bifurcating neurons are comparable to those observed when using 
 
retrograde methods in primates2,5,16,18 (Supplementary Table 1).
We speculate that dedicated projection neurons—which comprise 
the minority of neurons in V1—convey specialized visual information 
that is tailored to their target area, as has previously been suggested6–11. 
Indeed, the most underrepresented projection motif from V1, the 
 
PM–AL bifurcation, innervates two target areas with distinct preferences 
for visual features13,14. By contrast, we suggest that the majority of cells 
encode information that is shared and in a form that is suitable for 
 
generating visual representations or multimodal associations across 
subsets of areas. Indeed, those target areas that are preferentially co-in-
nervated by broadcasting neurons appear to have more similar visual 
response properties13,14. Broadcasting cells may also coordinate activ-
ity among the subset of areas that they co-innervate, thus providing a 
signal that links different processing streams. The divergent nature of 
signal transmission from a primary sensory cortex to its targets may 
therefore help to constrain models of hierarchical sensory processing. 
The existence of distinct projection motifs that either avoid or favour 
subsets of target areas suggests that sub-types of intracortical projection 
neurons exist and raises the question of how these specific, long-range 
connectivity patterns are established during development.

Mice. The anatomical single-cell tracing experiments were conducted at The 
Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland. We obtained licenses and performed 
all experimental procedures in accordance with Basel Canton animal welfare guide-
lines using both male and female adult (>8 weeks of age) C57BL/6 mice. Detailed 
protocols and all software are available at http://mouse.vision/han2017.
Fluorescence-based single-neuron tracing. Two-photon guided single-cell electro-
poration. We performed surgery as previously described34. In brief, we anaesthe-
tized mice with a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg kg−1), midazolam (5 mg kg−1) and 
medetomidine (0.5 mg kg−1), and maintained stable anaesthesia by isoflurane (0.5% 
in O2). We performed all electroporation experiments on a custom linear scanning 
two-photon microscope, equipped to image both a green and a red channel and 
running ScanImage 5.135. For electroporation, we used a patch pipette (12–16 MΩ) 
filled with plasmid DNA (pCAG-eGFP (Addgene, 11150) or pAAV-EF1a-eGFP-
WPRE (gift from B. Roska; sequence file can be found in the Supplementary 
Information, 100 ng μl−1) and AlexaFluor 488 (50 μM) in intracellular 
 
solution, and delivered electroporation pulses (100 Hz, −14 V, 0.5-ms duration 
 
for 1 s) with an Axoporator 800A (Molecular Probes) when pushed against a 
target cell. We verified successful electroporation by dye filling of the cell body, 
and then sealed the skull with a chronic window using 1.5% agarose in HEPES-
buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid and a cover slip. We confirmed plasmid 
expression two days after electroporation by visualization of GFP epifluorescence 
through the chronic imaging window. Three to ten days after electroporation, we 
 
transcardially perfused anaesthetized mice with 10 ml 0.9% NaCl followed by 50 ml 
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). We removed the brains 
from the skull and post-fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. 
We then stored the fixed brains in PBS at 4 °C until imaging with serial-section 
two-photon tomography.
Serial-section two-photon tomography. We embedded the fixed brains in 5% 
oxidized agarose (derived from type-I agarose (Sigma-Aldrich)) and covalently 
cross-linked the brain to the agarose by incubation in an excess of 0.5–1% sodium 
borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05 M sodium borate buffer overnight 
at 4 °C. We then imaged embedded brains using a TissueVision two-photon scan-
ning microscope23,36, which cut physical sections of the entire brain every 50 μm 
coronally, and acquired optical sections every 10 μm in two channels (green chan-
nel: 500–560 nm; red channel: 560-650 nm) using 940-nm excitation laser light 
(Mai Tai eHP, Spectraphysics). Each imaged section is formed from overlapping 
800 × 800-μm ‘tiles’
. We imaged with a resolution of 1 μm in x and y and measured 
an axial point spread function of ~5 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum) 
using ScanImage 5.1.
Image processing and cell tracing. We stitched raw image tiles using custom 
MATLAB-based software, StitchIt. StitchIt applies illumination correction based 
on the average tiles for each channel and optical plane, and subsequently stitches 
the illumination-corrected tiles from the entire brain. We then navigated through 
the stitched brain space using MaSIV (https://github.com/alexanderbrown/masiv), 
a MATLAB-based viewer for very large 3D images, and traced axons using a 
 
custom, manual neurite-tracing extension for MaSIV. The tracer was not blinded, 
as no comparison across experimental conditions was performed. No power 
 
calculations were performed.
To assign each voxel of the imaged brains to a brain area, we segmented each 
brain using areas defined by the Allen Reference Atlas (Common Coordinate 
Framework v.3, © 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science, Allen Brain Atlas API, 
available from http://brain-map.org/api/index.html), after smoothing with a single 
 
pass of a Gaussian kernel with an s.d. of 0.5 using the Nifty ‘seg-maths’ tool as 
described previously37. In brief, we downsampled one imaging channel to a voxel 
size of 25 μm and converted it to MHD format using StitchIt. We then registered the 
volume to the average template brain of the Allen Reference Atlas using Elastix38 
by applying rigid affine transformation followed by non-rigid deformation with 
parameters as previously described39,40. We examined registration quality using 
a custom Python/PyQt5 application, Lasagna, which overlays the Allen template 
brain and the registered sample brain and is extendable to allow the overlay of 
traced cells, or the overlay of area borders from the Allen Reference Atlas onto 
a downsampled brain. To transform the traced cells into Allen Reference Atlas 
space (sample to the Allen Reference Atlas), we calculated the inverse transform 
to the one calculated by Elastix (Allen Reference Atlas to sample) and applied this 
to the traced points.
Analysis of traced neurons. To prevent potential incomplete filling of neurons from 
biasing the results of our analyses, we excluded cells with non-arborizing primary 
branches in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the analysis. Out of a total of 71 traced 
cells, we excluded 28 cells that exhibited abrupt, non-callosal terminations, as well 
as 5 cells that were back-labelled from the striatum, thus restricting our analysis to 
ipsilateral projection patterns of 31 cells in V1 and 7 in other higher visual areas. 
Moreover, axonal branches terminating contralaterally or after entering the corpus 
callosum were considered as callosal terminations and were included in the analy-
sis (see also ref. 6). We calculated the first-order projection statistics only using the 
cells registered in the Allen Reference Atlas that satisfied these criteria. To reduce 
any artefacts associated with registration in the Allen Reference Atlas or individual 
brain variability in boundaries between brain areas, we excluded any axon within 
50 μm from any brain area boundary from the analysis. We then calculated the 
projection strength of each neuron to each area as the total length of axon of 
 
that neuron in an area. To determine the number of projection targets for 
 
every cell, we used a minimum projection strength of 1-mm axon length per 
target area.
MAPseq. MAPseq sample processing. To define the V1 injection site and target 
higher visual areas (LI, LM, AL, PM, AM and RL), we used optical imaging of 
intrinsic signals as previously described13,41. In brief, we first implanted a custom-
ized head plate and then thinned the skull to increase its transparency. After 2–3 
days of recovery, we sedated the mice (chlorprothixene, 0.7 mg kg−1) and lightly 
anaesthetized them with isoflurane (0.5–1.5% in O2), delivered via a nose cone. 
We illuminated the visual cortex with 700-nm light that was split from an LED 
source into two light guides, performing imaging with a tandem lens macroscope 
focused 250–500 μm below the cortical surface and a bandpass filter centred at 
700 nm with 10-nm bandwidth (67905; Edmund Optics). We acquired images 
at 6.25 Hz with a 12-bit CCD camera (1300QF; VDS Vosskühler), frame grab-
ber (PCI-1422; National Instruments) and custom software written in LabVIEW 
(National Instruments). We visually stimulated the contralateral eye of mice with 
a monitor placed at a distance of 21 cm and presented 25–35° patches of 100% 
contrast square wave gratings with a temporal frequency of 4 Hz and a spatial 
frequency of 0.02 cycles per degree for 2 s followed by 5 s of grey screen (mean 
luminance of 46 candela per m2). To establish a coarse retinotopy of the targeted 
area, we alternated the position of the patches: we used two different elevations 
(approximately 0 and 20°) and two different azimuths (approximately 60 and 90°); 
at each position, we acquired at least 17 trials. We obtained intrinsic signal maps 
by averaging the responses during the stimulation time using ImageJ (National 
Institute of Mental Health, NIH) and mapping the location of the estimated spots 
of activation onto a previously acquired blood vessel picture.
We then pressure-injected (Picospritzer III, Parker) 100 nl of 1 × 1010 genome 
copies ml−1 barcoded MAPseq Sindbis virus30 with a diversity of >8 × 106 different 
barcode sequences unilaterally at a depth of 100–200 μm from the brain surface 
into V1 of four 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. In addition, we labelled the 
six higher visual areas by placing a DiI-coated micropipette into retinotopically 
matched positions according to intrinsic signal maps. For this, we allowed 2–5 μl 
of 2.5 mg ml−1 DiI (Invitrogen D3911) in ethanol solution to dry on the outside of 
a pulled micropipette tip until some DiI crystals were visible. Mice were euthanized 
44–48 h after injection by decapitation, and their brain immediately extracted and 
flash-frozen on dry ice.
We cut 180-μm thick coronal sections using a cryostat at −10 °C blade and 
sample holder temperature, and melted each slice onto a clean microscope slide 
before rapidly freezing it on dry ice again. We then dissected each target area and 
the injection site using cold scalpels while keeping the brain sections frozen on a 
metal block cooled to approximately −20 °C in a freezing 2.25 M CaCl2 bath42. 
During dissection, we identified each dissected area using a fluorescent dissection 
microscope to visualize viral GFP expression and DiI stabs labelling each target 
area (Extended Data Fig. 7). Throughout the procedure, we took care to avoid 
sample cross-contamination by never reusing tools or blades applied to differ-
ent areas and changing gloves between samples. To measure noise introduced by 
contamination, we collected samples of the olfactory bulb from each brain, which 
served as a negative control.
We then processed the dissected samples for sequencing mostly as previ-
ously described30, but pooling all samples after first-strand cDNA synthesis. In 
brief, we extracted total RNA from each sample using TRIzol reagent (Thermo 
Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We mixed the sample RNA 
with spike-in RNA (obtained by in vitro transcription of a double-stranded 
 
ultramer with sequence 5′-GTCATGATCATAATACGACTCACTATAG

Coulter) and produced double-stranded cDNA as previously described43. 
We then treated the samples using ExonucleaseI (NEB) and performed two 
rounds of nested PCR using primers 5′-CTCGGCATGGACGAGCTGTA-3′ 
and 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGTGATGTGACTGGAG 
TTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA-3′ for the first PCR and primers 
 
5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCA 
TACGA-3′ for the second PCR using Accuprime Pfx polymerase (Thermo Fisher). 
Finally, we gel-extracted the resulting PCR amplicons using Qiagen MinElute 
Gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced 
the library on a Illumina NextSeq500 high-output run at paired-end 36 using the 
SBS3T sequencing primer for paired-end 1 and the Illumina small RNA sequencing 
primer 2 for paired-end 2.
MAPseq data analysis. On the basis of the sequencing results, we constructed a 
barcode matrix M of size of (number of barcodes) × (number of dissected areas) 
with entry Mi,j representing the absolute counts of barcode i in area j as previously 
described30. We de-multiplexed the sequencing results, extracted the absolute 
counts of each barcode in each sample based on the UMI sequence and error- 
corrected the barcode sequences, before matching barcode sequences to the virus 
library and constructing matrix M by matching barcode sequences across areas. 
We then filtered the barcode matrix for ‘high-confidence’ cell bodies inside the 
dissected area of V1 by requiring a minimum of 10 counts in at least one target area, 
an at least tenfold difference between the cell body location in V1 and the most 
abundant target area in data normalized to the efficiency of library production 
as measured by the amount of recovered spike-in RNA counts, and an absolute 
minimum barcode count of 300 in V1. We then normalized the raw barcode counts 
in each area to the relative spike-in RNA recovery to the olfactory bulb sample, 
merged the results from all four processed brains into a single barcode matrix and 
used this matrix for all further analysis.
To determine whether a particular neuron projected to any given target area, we 
chose a conservative threshold of at least 5 barcode counts, based on the highest 
level of barcode expression in the olfactory bulb negative control sample.
Calculation of statistical significance of projection motifs. To calculate the statistical 
significance of broadcasting projection motifs, we compared against the simplest 
model in which we assumed that each neuron projected to each area independently. 
To generate predictions of this model, we first estimated the probability of pro-
jecting to each area, assuming independent projections. We define the probability 
P(Ai) that a given neuron projects to the ith area Ai as
=
P A

i
A
total
i
in which NAi is the number of neurons in the sample that project to area Ai, 
i = 1 ... k for k analysed target areas, and Ntotal is the total number of neurons in the 
sample.
In our MAPseq experiments, we do not have direct access to Ntotal, since for 
technical reasons we only include neurons that have at least one projection among 
the dissected targets. Because, in principle, some neurons might project to none of 
the areas dissected (see Fig. 3a), failure to include these would lead to an underes-
timation of Ntotal. However, assuming independence of projections, we can infer 
Ntotal from the available measurements.
To estimate Ntotal, we first observe that

Noting that this is a quintic equation in Ntotal, we can use a root finder to solve for 
Ntotal numerically, and use the result to calculate P(Ai).
Using the derived Ntotal and P(Ai), we can calculate the P value for every possible 
broadcasting motif by calculating the value of the binomial cumulative distribution 
function, for a total of Ntotal tries, the empirical number of observed counts (suc-
cesses), and P(motif) assuming independent projections. We calculated the P value 
of all possible bi-, tri- and quadrifurcations, and determined significantly over- or 
underrepresented broadcasting motifs at a significance threshold of α = 0.05 after 
Bonferroni correction.

one additional cell was retrogradely labelled and electroporated, which 
revealed its axonal projection to the striatum, but it is not shown because 
the brain was too distorted to allow accurate registration to the Allen

neurons (no abrupt terminations and abrupt terminations; right). f, To test 
the effect of false negatives on our analyses, we simulated the random loss 
or gain of projections from the MAPseq dataset, while maintaining overall 
area projection probabilities. n = 553 neurons; 400 repeats. P values based 
on a binomial test for all six projection motifs determined as significantly 
over- or underrepresented in our dataset are plotted after removing 
(dropfraction <1) or adding (dropfraction >1) connections. Mean (black

the primary target) that each area needs to receive to be considered a 
target. g, The fraction of broadcasting cells as a function of increasing 
buffer zones between areas within which axons are ignored, assuming a 
minimum projection of 1 mm of axon per target area. h, The fraction of

we randomly selected neurons from the available positions to project to 
each area and repeated the process 10,000 times. P values were derived 
from the bootstrapping probability distribution and are indicated for 
projection targets significantly deviating from this expectation (α = 0.05). 
P values below 10−4 are not exact and are therefore indicated as a range.

the to-be-dissected higher visual areas by performing intrinsic imaging 
of visual cortex in response to stimuli at different positions in the 
contralateral visual field and mapping the resulting changes in intrinsic 
signals. a, A representative retinotopic map, with responses to the two 
25° visual stimuli pseudocoloured in green and magenta (stimulus 1

f, g, Summary of single-neuron projections from V1. f, Cells targeting  
single higher visual areas (dedicated projection neurons) comprise the  
minority of layer-2/3 V1 projection neurons. Among the areas analysed by 
MAPseq, dedicated projection neurons predominantly innervate cortical 
areas LM or PM. g, Cells projecting to two or more areas (broadcasting 
projection neurons) are the dominant mode of information transfer 
from V1 to higher visual areas. In the six areas analysed by MAPseq, 
broadcasting neurons innervate combinations of target areas in a non-
random manner, including those that are more or less abundant than 
expected by chance. Line width indicates the absolute abundance of each 
projection type as observed in the MAPseq dataset.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
Please do not complete any field with "not applicable" or n/a.  Refer to the help text for what text to use if an item is not relevant to your study. 
For final submission: please carefully check your responses for accuracy; you will not be able to make changes later.
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
No sample size calculations were performed.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
We excluded fluorescence-based reconstructed neurons that showed abrupt terminations in 
the ipsilateral hemisphere from analysis. Cells with cell bodies in layer 5 of mouse 7 of the 
MAPseq data were excluded from analysis, as this sample appears t be contaminated by area 
LM.
3.   Replication
Describe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility 
of the experimental findings.
All findings replicated across animals, subject to the sampling inherent in single cell tracing 
approaches.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Group allocation is not applicable in this study, as we do not compare across treatment 
conditions but report only static connectivity properties.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
No blinding was used for fluorescence based single neuron reconstructions. The researcher 
producing the MAPseq sequencing libraries was blinded to sample identity.
Note: all in vivo studies must report how sample size was determined and whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
Test values indicating whether an effect is present 
Provide confidence intervals or give results of significance tests (e.g. P values) as exact values whenever appropriate and with effect sizes noted.
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars in all relevant figure captions (with explicit mention of central tendency and variation)
See the web collection on statistics for biologists for further resources and guidance.
