ABSTRACT
Introduction Long-term air pollution exposure
contributes to mortality but there are few studies
examining effects of very long-term (>25 years)
exposures.
Methods This study investigated modelled air pollution
concentrations at residence for 1971, 1981, 1991 (black
smoke (BS) and SO2) and 2001 (PM10) in relation to
mortality up to 2009 in 367 658 members of the
longitudinal survey, a 1% sample of the English Census.
Outcomes were all-cause (excluding accidents),
cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory mortality.
Results BS and SO2 exposures remained associated
with mortality decades after exposure—BS exposure in
1971 was significantly associated with all-cause (OR
1.02 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.04)) and respiratory (OR 1.05
(95% CI 1.01 to 1.09)) mortality in 2002–2009 (ORs
expressed per 10 μg/m3). Largest effect sizes were seen
for more recent exposures and for respiratory disease.
PM10 exposure in 2001 was associated with all
outcomes in 2002–2009 with stronger associations for
respiratory (OR 1.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.44)) than CV
mortality (OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.25)). Adjusting
PM10 for past BS and SO2 exposures in 1971, 1981 and
1991 reduced the all-cause OR to 1.16 (95% CI 1.07 to
1.26) while CV and respiratory associations lost
significance, suggesting confounding by past air
pollution exposure, but there was no evidence for effect
modification. Limitations include limited information on
confounding by smoking and exposure misclassification
of historic exposures.
Conclusions This large national study suggests that air
pollution exposure has long-term effects on mortality
that persist decades after exposure, and that historic air
pollution exposures influence current estimates of
associations between air pollution and mortality.
INTRODUCTION
While the impact of air pollution on mortality in
the
short
term
(days)
and
medium
term
(<10 years) is now well established, there are rela-
tively
few
studies
assessing
the
long-term
(>10 years) impact of air pollution1–10 with even
fewer
assessing
the
very
long
term
(25+
years).2 3 8–10 Only a small number of these4–6 had
exposure data at more than one time point.
Like many other developed countries the UK
experienced high levels of air pollution in the past,
including the infamous London smog episode of
December 1952,11 since when air pollution levels
have fallen to much lower levels. Changes in air
pollution concentrations in the UK are well docu-
mented as, uniquely, the UK had a comprehensive
national air quality monitoring network running
from the 1950s to the 1990s measuring black
smoke (BS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) arising from
domestic and industrial coal and fossil fuel combus-
tion, then major sources of emissions. Thereafter,
networks switched to monitor nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) (from the early 1990s) and particulate
matter with a diameter of 10µm or less (PM10)
(from
the
mid-1990s),
as
transport
emissions
became the largest source of air pollution.12 13 The
present study uses a very large nationally represen-
tative British cohort to consider impact of air pollu-
tion over 38 years of follow-up. Three a priori
hypotheses were investigated:
1. Historic air pollution (ie, of several decades pre-
viously) is associated with later mortality risk.
2. The mortality risks associated with a given
exposure decrease over subsequent decades.
3. Air pollution exposures in previous decades
interact with recent exposures to affect mortal-
ity risk.

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What is the impact of very long-term
(>30 years) air pollution exposure on mortality?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Historic air pollution exposure has long-term
effects on mortality that persist over 30 years
after exposure and these potentially also
influence current estimates of associations
between air pollution and mortality.
Why read on?
▸ This is one of the longest running studies to
look at health effects of air pollution, using air
pollution estimates independently assessed at
multiple time points using contemporaneous
monitoring data in a large cohort followed for
38 years.

 Longitudinal Study, which contains linked census and life events
data on a representative 1% sample of the population of
England and W
ales. The initial sample was drawn from the
1971 census.14 15
For this investigation, the study was restricted to members of
the cohort of all ages present at the 1971 census, who were
either present at each subsequent census (1981, 1991 and 2001)
and either traced up to 2009 or had died, who were not identi-
fied through general practice (GP) registration as having left the
country. Exclusions (figure 1) were made for data inaccuracies,
those who died in 1971 and those not UK born (who may have
had different previous air pollution exposures). By constructing
a closed cohort, we were able to estimate air pollution exposures
across the entire period of their life 1971–2009 for each
individual.
Air pollution exposures in 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001
Land use regression techniques were used to model BS and SO2
annual concentrations in 1971, 1981 and 1991 at 1 km grids.
Models for BS and SO2 have been described in detail previ-
ously12 but were developed with a range of variables including
information on land cover, major and minor roads, and X–Y
coordinates of each monitoring site. Models were developed
against concentration data from national monitoring station sites
where operational days in the year exceeded 75%, which
involved a total of 966 sites for BS and 825 sites for SO2. Model
building used 80% of network sites; the remaining independent,
randomly stratified 20% sample was retained for model valid-
ation. The validation statistics from the independent subset gave
r2 values for BS of 0.41, 0.38 and 0.34 for 1971, 1981 and
1991, respectively, and for SO2 of 0.57, 0.26 and 0.31. Values of
mean (fractional) bias were low in all years (ie, <−0.1), which
suggests that predicted values were within 20% of observed
monitored concentrations. Land use regression techniques were
used to model PM10 at 100 m grids in 2001.16 Leave-one-out
validation statistics for PM10 in 2001 gave r2 value of 0.37.
Integration of air pollution and confounder data into the
longitudinal survey
Air pollution exposure estimates were produced for UK grids
and wards (ONS small area geographical units) and Centre for
Longitudinal Study Information & User Support (CeLSIUS)
staff matched these to individuals; precise geolocation of longi-
tudinal survey (LS) participants is not made available to
researchers. For 1971, individuals were assigned the annual
average BS and SO2 concentration of the 1 km grid in which
their residence was located. For other years (1981, 1991 and
2001) the pollutant surfaces (ie, regular grids) were intersected
with ward boundaries and area-weighting was used to calculate
the average values of each pollutant within each ward.
Information on smoking was not available at individual level
in the cohort, so smoothed district-level lung cancer mortality

 relative risk 2002–2009 (International Classification of Diseases
(ICD)-10 codes C33-C34) as a proxy measure for cumulative
smoking over the past 20+ years17 were used. Lung cancer risks
using Bayesian smoothing methods were calculated from ONS
data held by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of individual-level data were conducted in
person at the ONS offices using Stata V
.11 (Stata, College
Station, T
exas, USA). Descriptive analyses were conducted for
all variables. Logistic regression analyses (died/survived) were
used to investigate associations between BS and/or SO2 exposure
in 1971, 1981 and 1991 and PM10 in 2001 and risk of death in
1972–1981, 1982–1991, 1992–2001 and 2002–2009, respect-
ively. Mortality outcomes were all-cause excluding accidents;
cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory mortality and by constituent
subgroups of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, respiratory
infections, COPD and lung cancer. For ICD codes used, see the
online supplementary appendix A table A1. W
e conducted ana-
lyses by decade to align with census years, the periodicity of
which reflects marked changes in air pollution sources in the
UK, from predominantly fossil fuel burning in the 1970s to
domination by traffic-based sources with increasing contribution
from diesel engines by 2001.
Adjustments were made: (i) for age and sex; (ii) additionally
for social class of individual (Registrar General occupation) and
area (quintiles
of Carstairs deprivation index),
population
density (not used in any of the exposure models) and geograph-
ical region (in 1971). Sensitivity analyses were conducted adjust-
ing for the smoking proxy (lung cancer risks), restricting
analyses to non-movers in the 5 years prior to the 1971 census
and adjusting for exposures in other years. All air pollution vari-
ables, population density and age variables were centred prior
to regression analyses.
To evaluate whether past BS or SO2 exposure modified the
effect of PM10 on mortality in 2002–2009 we introduced inter-
action terms in statistical models between tertiles of BS/SO2 and
PM10 and examined risks by exposure tertiles. As SO2 was
highly correlated with the same-year BS, we did not conduct
two pollutant analyses. Finally, through a piecewise linear
model for the tertiles of BS/SO2 at 1971 and the three main
outcomes (all-cause mortality, all respiratory mortality and all
CV mortality) we visually assessed the presence of a concentra-
tion–response.
RESULTS
Descriptive analyses
The analyses included 367 658 individuals followed from 1971
to 2009 with non-missing data (figure 1), comprising 71.67%
of the initial cohort. The main reasons for exclusion were emi-
gration
(n=77 265)
and
missing
or
incomplete
data
(n=25 992). Those excluded from the analysis were significantly
(p<0.001) younger in 1971 than those included (mean age 25
vs 38 years), more likely to be male (54% vs 48%), more likely
to have lived in most deprived areas in 1971 (23% vs 20%) and
to have moved between 1966 and 1971 (59% vs 39%) (see
online supplementary appendix A table A2).
Median air pollution exposures to BS and SO2 were twofold
to threefold higher in 1971 compared with 1991. Ranges
(10th–90th centiles) for BS were 18.5–70.5 μg/m3 in 1971 and
3–19 μg/m3 in 1991 (table 1).
The mean PM10 exposure in 2001 was 20.7 μg/m3 (10–90th
centile 18–24). The highest exposures were seen in urban
metropolitan areas: BS was highest in the northern regions of
England and W
ales, and highest SO2 and PM10 exposures were
seen in London (see online supplementary appendix A table
A3). All exposures decreased with increasing individual-level
social class and increased with increased deprivation of area of
residence (see online supplementary appendix A table A3).
PM10 exposure in 2001 was weakly correlated with BS and
SO2 in earlier years (all r <0.45) (table 2).
Within-year BS and SO2 exposures were highly correlated
(r>0.7). Correlations were also moderate to high (r∼0.6–0.7)
for BS exposures between years, but there was a greater range
for SO2 (r∼0.45–0.7).
BS exposures in 1971–1991
There were statistically significant associations between BS
exposure in 1971 and all-cause mortality in all subsequent
decades through to 2002–2009 (figure 2 and table 3); CV and
respiratory
mortality
showed
similar
patterns
as
all-cause
mortality.
BS exposures in 1981 and 1991 were also significantly asso-
ciated with all-cause, CV and respiratory mortality in subsequent
decades (see figure 2 and online supplementary appendix B
table B1). Figure 3 shows stronger effects for more recent BS
exposures. Largest associations were between BS exposure in
1991 and respiratory mortality in 1991–2001 with OR 1.38
(95% CI 1.22 to 1.57) (see online supplementary appendix B
table B1). In the subgroup analyses (see online supplementary
appendix B table B1), risks were marginally higher for CHD
than stroke mortality and higher for COPD and lung cancer
than for respiratory infections especially for more recent expo-
sures. The highest risks observed were for COPD mortality.
COPD mortality remained significantly associated with past
exposures up to the most recent decade, while respiratory infec-
tions
generally
reduced
in
magnitude
and
became
non-
significant over time.
Adjustment for confounders slightly reduced ORs for expo-
sures in 1971 (table 3) and 1991 (see online supplementary
appendix B table B1) but showed a larger effect for BS in 1981
(see online supplementary appendix B table B1). Sensitivity ana-
lyses restricted to the non-movers made no difference in ORs.
The association with respiratory mortality in 2002–2009 no
longer reached statistical significance after additional adjustment
for the smoking proxy in 2002–2009 but it made no difference
to associations with all-cause and CV mortality (see online sup-
plementary appendix B table B2).
Concentration–response for each tertile of BS exposure in
1971 for the three main outcomes (figure 4) showed a steeper
response in the highest tertiles that was most marked for respira-
tory mortality. By 1981, the 90th centile value of BS exposure
(25 μg/m3) was within the lowest tertile range of BS exposure
for 1971 (1971 tertile cut points 31 and 50.5 μg/m3).
SO2 exposures in 1971–1991
Results for SO2 showed very similar patterns to those for BS
(see online supplementary appendix C) including for concentra-
tion–response. As for BS, there were statistically significant asso-
ciations between SO2 exposure in 1971 and mortality in all
subsequent decades through to 2002–2009 (see online supple-
mentary appendix C figure C1 and table C1). The largest associ-
ation, as for BS, was between SO2 exposure in 1991 and
respiratory mortality in 1991–2001 with OR 1.24 (95% CI
1.15 to 1.34) (see online supplementary appendix C table C1).

 PM10 exposure in 2001
PM10 exposure in 2001 was associated with an increased risk of
all-cause mortality in 2002–2009 after adjustment (OR 1.24
(95% CI 1.15 to 1.33)) (table 4), with higher ORs for respira-
tory and lower for CV mortality. Within the subgroup analyses,
the highest risk observed was for lung cancer with OR 1.60
(1.29 to 1.99) (see online supplementary appendix B table B4).
Additional adjustment for past exposures to BS in 1971, 1981
and 1991 reduced ORs for each outcome and the OR for CV
mortality (CV) lost statistical significance. The impact of adjust-
ing for past air pollution exposures was greater than that pro-
duced by adjusting for individual social class and area-level
deprivation. Similar effects were seen whether past BS, SO2 or
both were adjusted for, as expected from the high correlations

 between BS and SO2 (see online supplementary appendix B
table B3).
There were no clear patterns in interaction terms between
PM10 in 2001 in relation to mortality in 2002–2009 and past
exposures in terms of tertiles of BS or SO2 exposure in 1971,
1981 or 1991, or always highest or always lowest tertiles of
exposures. The exception to this was for CV with respect to BS
in 1981 (p value for highest tertile of exposure=0.014), suggest-
ive of lower OR for PM10 and CV confined to the highest tertile
of BS exposure in 1981, which is an apparently protective effect.
DISCUSSION
This study investigated air pollution exposures in 370 000 indi-
viduals in a national census-based cohort followed for 38 years.
In line with our prior hypotheses, we found that historic expo-
sures to BS and SO2 were associated with increased risks of all-
cause, CV and respiratory mortality in England and W
ales over
30 years later, and mortality risks associated with a given expos-
ure generally decreased over time. Subgroup analyses showed
highest risks for COPD and lung cancer mortality. Adjusting for
past BS or SO2 exposures resulted in slightly lower observed
mortality associations with recent PM10 exposure (suggestive of
confounding), but there was no clear evidence that higher air
pollution exposures in earlier life resulted in greater or lesser
susceptibility to PM10 (effect modification).
W
e saw highest associations with respiratory mortality, consist-
ent with other UK-based studies investigating long-term BS expo-
sures in the 1950s and 1960s,18 1970s,7 1980s and 1990s5 and
PM10 in the 2000s19 and with a population-registry-based study
in the Netherlands examining PM10 exposure in 2001.20 In con-
trast, studies of large American cohorts have found highest asso-
ciations of particulates with CV mortality,4 6 as did a recent study
in Rome,21 while the large European Study of Cohorts and Air
Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) analyses found associations with all-
cause9 but not non-malignant respiratory8 or CV mortality.10
Reasons for these differences are unclear, but may include
differences in death certification practices between countries.22 23
Our effect sizes for BS were very similar to those of recently
reported previous British studies5 7 especially for more recent
exposures, despite differing exposure estimation methods and
study design. The only other UK study to investigate recent
exposure to PM10 by Carey et al19 reported a lower effect size of
HR 1.07 (0.99 to 1.16) for all-cause mortality in 2003–2007,
compared with OR 1.24 (1.16 to 1.34) in this study. Effect esti-
mates are not incompatible but non-differential exposure mis-
classification in the Carey study (where PM10 concentration
estimates were on 1 km grids, compared with 100 m grids in this
study) may have biased estimates towards the null, and alterna-
tively the lower estimates in the Carey study may relate to better
control for individual-level confounders. Our effect size for PM10
exposure in 2001 and lung cancer mortality in 2002–2009, OR
1.60 (1.29 to 1.99), is larger than the combined estimate from
14 cohorts in the ESCAPE study (HR 1.22 (1.03 to 1.45)),24

 although our CIs overlap. The ESCAPE study was able to adjust
for smoking, which we were not able to do for this outcome as
our smoking proxy was lung cancer. Some earlier UK studies of
air pollution in the 1970s,1 25 including one using the LS,1 did
not find associations between mortality and particulate air pollu-
tion. This may relate to previous less accurate air pollution assess-
ment based on nearest monitoring station.
Few studies have examined long-term effects of SO2 expo-
sures. Studies conducted in the UK5 19 25 and the American
Cancer Society in the USA26 have generally found statistically
significant associations of mortality with SO2, while studies in
other parts of Europe2 3 27 have not. In the present study, BS
and SO2 levels were highly correlated (both originated from
fossil fuel combustion), so it is difficult to clearly attribute mor-
tality effects to one pollutant.
Was apparent persistence of air pollution mortality risk due
to highly correlated exposures?
Our results showed continued effects air pollution from 1971
on mortality in subsequent decades up to 2002–2009, suggest-
ing long-term persistence of risk. Since 1966 (5 years prior to
the start of the study in 1971) and 2001, 72% of individuals
had moved at least once, so results are not merely a function of
living in the same place. Air pollution exposures were assigned
to an individual’s ward of residence (or 1 km grid of residence)
at each census year. BS and SO2 air pollution exposures were
moderately correlated between decades (r∼0.6–0.7), so an alter-
native explanation for the apparent persistence of risks to
2002–2009 is that exposure in 1971 may have been acting as a
proxy for more recent exposures. However, while adjustment
for BS in subsequent years (1981 and 1991) did reduce effect
estimates, those for all-cause and respiratory mortality remained
statistically significant (see online supplementary appendix B
table B2). It is also possible that 1971 levels of exposure may
correlate highly with and be a proxy for earlier life exposures
when levels were much higher.
Mortality risks associated with a given exposure decrease
over time
Mortality risks were generally highest in decades immediately
following exposure. This is consistent with a previous UK study
finding that in the last 4 years BS and SO2 exposure gave higher
risks of respiratory mortality than exposures 12–16 years prior.5
It is also consistent with the Harvard Six Cities follow-up
study,4 which found similar risks for annual compared with
mean air pollution over the study period (1980–1998), suggest-
ing that air pollution during the last year may be important.
The follow-up of the American Cancer Society study6 did not
find clear differences in risks for average PM2.5 and SO2 con-
centrations 1–5, 6–10 and 11–15 years before death, but high
correlations between the time periods may have reduced the
ability to detect differences.
Increased risks per unit pollutant were observed for more
recent exposures even though air pollution levels fell markedly
(fourfold lower mean BS concentrations between 1971 and
1991). This might imply a steeper concentration–response curve
at lower exposures,28 although this was not the case for BS
exposure in 1971 where a steeper concentration–response curve
was seen in higher exposures (figure 4); or be due to more
accurate exposure estimates for more recent periods. However,
the latter seems unlikely because exposure models performed
better for earlier periods. Alternatively, changes in air pollution
sources over time, with reductions in industry and household
emissions and increases from road traffic,12 13 may have led to
changes in toxicity. Due to qualitative changes in particulate
composition over time, we did not adopt a conversion factor
between PM10 and BS. However, the two measures are moder-
ately highly (r=0.5–0.8) correlated29 and a number of previous
studies have found associations between BS and CV30 and
respiratory mortality31 with comparable effect sizes expressed
per IQR of exposure.29 The larger size of the PM10 associations
relative to the BS per unit mass in the present study may suggest
greater toxicity of recent particles or changes in population sus-
ceptibility. A ‘harvesting’ effect of sensitive individuals in our
closed cohort might at least partly account for waning effects of
air
pollution
over
time,
but
would
be
inconsistent
with
increased risks for more recent exposures, unless sensitivity also
increased over time.
Interaction of past with recent air pollution exposures
W
e did not find evidence for effect modification by past expo-
sures to BS and SO2, or put another way, we did not find that
higher exposures in earlier life has a multiplicative effect on
mortality risk associated with more recent PM10 exposure. Our
results did suggest that the relationship between mortality and
PM10 exposure was confounded by past exposure (ie, that past
air pollution exposures are independently associated with both
PM10 exposure and with mortality outcomes, suggesting that
not accounting for past exposures will affect observed risk esti-
mates for more recent exposures), although the overall impact
of this was small. This is one of the first studies directly to inves-
tigate this question. This confounding is unlikely to be solely
due to correlation between the exposures as PM10 exposure in
2001 was not strongly correlated with BS and SO2 in earlier
years (all r<0.45).
Exposure assessment
Previous studies investigating very long-term air pollution expo-
sures have had limited historical exposure information. ESCAPE
studies8–10 relied on back-extrapolation from modelled expo-
sures in 2008–2011, studies in Stockholm used emissions
data3 32 to estimate historic SO2 exposure without independent
measured
concentrations

models,

 contemporaneous monitored concentrations. Model perform-
ance was moderate (r2 0.3–0.5) with weakest performance for
SO2 in 1981 (r2=0.26) and best performance for SO2 in 1971
(r2=0.57),12 but the lower r2 values in later years may be partly
related to lower variability in concentrations rather than model
performance.
W
e used air pollution estimates to the highest spatial reso-
lution available, which were on 1 km (BS and SO2) and 100 m
(PM10) exposure grids. This may have contributed to some
exposure misclassification, though this is likely to be non-
differential and result in bias towards the null. Because of
limited access to location of individuals in the LS cohort, we
were unable to adjust for spatial autocorrelation, but other
studies suggest that impact of this is small.6 19
Other study limitations
While the cohort was originally a population-based sample,
losses to follow-up occurred that were higher in those living in
more deprived areas. We consider that this is more likely to
have led to an underestimate than overestimate of associations
between air pollution and mortality. We cannot rule out an
effect of residual confounding on the observed associations but
previous work suggests that it is unlikely to have a large impact
on our conclusions. The LS does not have information on
individual-level smoking, so, as in some other studies,20 we
used area-level lung cancer risk as a proxy; adjustment for this
did not affect observed effect estimates (see online supplemen-
tary appendix B table B2). While some comparable studies
with individual-level information on smoking have found
larger effects in non-smokers,26 other studies have found no or
only small confounding effects of smoking,7
9
19 or that
smoking was not related to the exposure,21 with larger impacts
from adjustments for socioeconomic status.19 Association of
smoking with air pollution exposures is likely to be through
deprivation with which it is highly correlated33 and, in the
present study, we adjusted for socioeconomic status at both
individual and area level.
Conclusions
This study suggests that air pollution exposure may have persist-
ent long-lasting impacts on mortality risk but that more recent
air pollution exposures is associated with higher relative risks
than past exposures. Concentration–response function estimates
for recent long-term exposures may be slightly overestimated if
previous exposures are not taken into account. Findings may be
particularly relevant to countries such as China experiencing
high but declining levels of particulate concentrations, with a
transition from coal to cleaner fuels and increases in emissions
from traffic.
