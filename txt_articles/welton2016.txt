Abstract     
Background: This study provides the first contemporary epidemiological insight into 
venomous injuries based on demographics and geography in Australia in the timeframe 
2000-2013.  
Methods: Analysis of national hospitalisation and mortality data to examine the incidence of 
injury and death due to envenoming in Australia. Rates were calculated using the intercensal 
population for all Australian age groups.  
Results: Over the study period, deaths were due to an anaphylactic event (0.16 per 100 
000), snake envenoming (0.13 per 100 000) or box jellyfish envenoming (0.01 per 100 000). 
Only 44% of cases involving anaphylaxis reached medical care prior to death, compared to 
74% of those envenomed by snakes. Over half of all deaths (52%) occurred at home, and 
64% of these occurred within a major city or inner regional area, with 48% of anaphylaxis 
deaths work related. Hospital admission rates of 199 per 100 000 persons over the 11 years 
were caused by contact with wasps or bees (31%), spiders (30%) and snakes (15%) with a 
predominate age range of 30-44 years.  
Conclusions: The greatest burden of injury due to envenoming was caused by arthropods 
and snakes. Causes of death led by anaphylaxis subsequent to an arthropod bite or sting, 
followed by death from snake envenoming.  Over half the incidence resulting in death 
occurred at home, in areas where health care is accessible. Operational data routinely 
collected is informative, with variations of injury incidence between States and Territories 
indicating a need for a more localised approach to management of this injury.

Introduction 
Accidental injuries are a major public health problem in developed countries1,2, with 
poisoning and envenoming a subset of this category. Australia has an international 
reputation for being the epicentre of all things venomous, whether these are 
venomous snakes and arthropods on land, or lethal jellyfish, stingrays, stonefish and 
octopuses in our oceans. Injuries and deaths caused by venomous snakes and 
jellyfish are often sensationalised in the media, yet there is a paucity of high 
resolution data regarding fundamental national public health questions, such as 
where venomous injuries occur, the reasons for their occurrence, and determinants 
of their outcomes.  
Injuries have multifaceted requirements within Australia’s health plans and 
strategies3-5 including aspects of population health, access to pharmaceutical and 
medical services, acute and primary health care and health workforce capacity.  A 
key strategic outcome identified in these plans includes the need to build a 
consumer-focused health care system4, 5 . That is, individuals within different 
population groups will require different types of support from the health system with 
varying risks including age, gender, cultural background, geographical location and 
remoteness. Evidence is necessary to support decision making for planning, 
resource allocation, co-ordination and integration of effort across health areas, and 
to lead the identification of training needs to provide an informed and capable 
workforce. 
While envenoming incidents are considered a minor injury6-10, minor injuries make up 
a large portion of the overall cost of injuries5, and some may be both potentially life

threatening and challenging to manage11, 12 , further reinforcing the advisability of  
understand national needs. 
Clinical envenoming by snakes11-13, marine and jellyfish stings14, 15  or from 
arthropods16-18 has been studied extensively in recent times and the findings used to 
underpin present management guidelines. However contemporary national research 
on the burden of envenoming across Australia is lacking with only one national report 
to date10. Such information is essential for evidence-based planning and resource 
allocation. Here we report core data on national incidence and mortality resulting 
from venomous bites and stings between 2000 and 2013, and highlight how 
improved data collection can yield even greater resolution and deeper insights into 
the burden of envenoming in Australia. 
Methods  
Australian hospital separations provided by the Australian Institute of Health and 
Welfare [AIHW] and National Coronial Information System [NCIS] mortality data 
were examined to describe the incidence, trends and the characteristics of 
venomous bite and sting injuries resulting in hospital inpatient treatment and/or 
death.  
AIHW data for all public hospital separations in Australia from August 2001 to May 
2013 enabled identification of acute hospital admissions. Separations by care type 
code 1.0: (Acute admitted care) were used for analysis with other admission types 
(for example 2.0: Rehabilitation care, 8.0: other admitted care) and transfer 
separations were excluded from the database. The scope of the venomous injuries 
was defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems 10th Revision, Australian Modification [ICD-10-AM] codes19. Data

extracts were requested for external cause codes (levels 1-10): X20-X29, W56, W57, 
W59, W60; and diagnosis codes (levels 1-10): T61-63, S61, S91, T78.2, T78.3, 
T78.4, L02, L03, L50, L97, and Z0419.  Data were tabulated into T63 or external 
cause codes X20-X29, as detailed in Table 1. Code 59.1 (Bitten or crushed by 
snake, unknown if venomous or non-venomous) with no association with X or T 
codes per Table 1 were excluded (n=6,149). 
Deaths were identified from January 2000 to December 2013 using external cause 
and diagnostic codes, keyword and mechanism searches. Cause of death 
assignment was based on closed coronial findings and autopsy reports. AIHW 2006-
2011 Cause of Death Unit Record Files [COD URF] were reviewed for all cases with 
an external cause code or principle diagnosis associated with an envenomation 
event. COD URF data were cross checked against the NCIS searches between 
2006-2011 to identify correlations or gaps between the databases and ensure any 
limitations were valid. Medical literature and media reports were reviewed to broaden 
searches. Cases identified from a minimum of two sources were included in the 
study. Cases were excluded if deaths occurred among non-residents, were caused 
by ingestion of a poisonous substance, where the identified causes of death were 
definitively not linked to envenoming, or if cases remained open within the NCIS 
(n=19). 
ArcGIS Desktop 10.2.1 (ESRI)20 was used to extract and process data. An Australian 
basemap21 was overlayed with Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) remoteness 
structures22. Incidence (hospital separations) and mortality rates due to bites and 
stings were calculated per 100,000 population using a 2007 intercensal Australian 
age group profile with 5-year age increments, gender and state specific 
populations23. Rates were presented for the entire study period. Remoteness

populations were calculated24 using 2007 state population. Confidence intervals 
were calculated using published methods10. Where case counts were greater or 
equal to 100, symmetrical 95% confidence intervals were used.  
This project was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics 
Committee (1441602), the NCIS (M0308) and Western Australian Coronial ethics 
(EC08-14) and the AIHW (560824/1).   
Results  
Hospitalisations  
From August 2001 to May 2013, there were 41,521 hospital admissions with a 
principle ICD-10 diagnosis of T63 or X20-X29 (199 persons admissions per 100,000 
people). Gender distribution was skewed towards males (Table 2), with gender-
specific rates of males and females 127 and 72 per 100,000 persons, respectively. 
ICD-10-AM external cause codes X21, X23 and X25 (contact with arthropods) 
represented 76% of all admissions (139 per 100 000 people). Admissions due to 
contact with venomous snakes (X20.0) accounted for 15% of all admissions (29 per 
100,000 people), with a further 9% due to contact with marine animals (X26) (18 per 
100,000 people).  
A diagnosis of “venom of other arthropods” (T63.4) was recorded for 44% of 
admissions (73 per 100,000 people). A diagnosis of “snake venom” (T63.0) was the 
third leading cause admission, accounting for 16% (Table 2) (26.3 per 100,000 
people). A diagnosis of allergy or anaphylaxis (T78.2, T78.3, T78.4) related to the 
allergenic effect following contact with venomous animals (T63.0-T63.9) was noted 
in 26% (n=8,997) of patients (43 per 100,000 persons).

In terms of absolute numbers, the largest proportion of admissions occurred among 
Australians aged 30-34 years, representing 34% of all admissions (233 admissions 
per 100,000 people). This was followed closely by the 5-9 and 75-79 year age 
groups (223 and 228 admissions per 100,000 people, respectively). (Figure 1) 
Figure 2 illustrates hospitalisation incidence per State according to cases by 
organism and rates per remoteness category. Rates of admissions by remoteness 
vary considerably between state and territories. The highest rates of admissions 
within a remote or very remote area were reported in WA and the NT, whereas more 
than half the reported cases in Victoria and Tasmania were hospitalised within a 
major city or inner regional area (see also supplementary table 1). Contact with 
venomous snakes (X20) and marine animals was highest in NT, Qld, Tasmania and 
NSW, and contact with marine animals (X26) highest in Qld and NT. Arthropod 
envenoming (spiders [X21], bees, wasp, hornets [X23] and contact with other 
specified arthropods [X25]) was common and was reported in all states and 
territories. 
Mortality  
There were 82 deaths identified within the NCIS. Cases were removed from the 
analysis where the coronial findings and death certificate did not confirm 
envenoming as cause of death. Data records from NCIS and COD URF were 
correlated from 2006-2011. Cases were reviewed +/- 6 months outside of these 
years to identify lags in reporting. Thirty five NCIS cases and 34 COD URF cases 
were identified, with a total of 36 within this period. Keyword searches and coronial 
record review identified two cases not recorded within the COD URF due to no 
codes allocated to the case, and one case in COD URF was corroborated with 
media reports, but not recorded within the NCIS.

During the period from 2000 to 2013, 64 deaths after a bite or sting from a venomous 
organism were identified. This corresponded to a crude rate of 0.30 per 100,000 
persons. The majority of deaths occurred between the months of October and April 
(n=58). Deaths due to insects, arthropods or unknown causes occurred at a rate of 
0.16 per 100,000 persons, with bees (n=25), wasps (n=2), ants (n=2), ticks (n=3) or 
unknown organisms (n=2) being recorded as the cause. Deaths due to snakebite 
envenoming occurred at a rate of 0.13 per 100,000 persons, and involved 27 cases. 
No deaths were recorded during the study period from Tasmania or the ACT. 
Deaths due to anaphylaxis post-envenoming from an arthropod occurred in 0.16 per 
100,000 people (n=33). South Australia (n=8) and Western Australia (n=9) had the 
highest number of deaths due to anaphylaxis. The mean age was 46.2 years (± SD 
14.3), with 91% (n=31) of cases being male. The majority of anaphylaxis deaths 
(87%) occurred at home, with 62% of these occurring within a major city or inner 
regional area (Figure 3). Only one death from anaphylaxis was due to work as a bee 
keeper. Sixteen out of 33 cases occurred during paid work, with 6 of these occurring 
in SA. Snake bite was the only other cause of envenoming deaths (n=2) that 
occurred whilst in the workplace. 
There were a total of 30 deaths due to envenoming per se, that is, not due to 
anaphylaxis (0.14 per 100,000 people). Twenty seven were attributed to snakebite 
and 66% occurred within a major city or inner regional area (Figure 3). Queensland 
(n=13) had the highest number and rate (2.0 per 100,000 people). The mean age 
was 47.8 years (± SD 22.6) and 70% (n=21) of cases involved males.  
Two-thirds of cases that involved fatal bites took place at the person’s home, and 
74% of all cases were hospitalised prior to death. Brown snakes (Pseudonaja spp.) 
were recorded as the cause of 63% (n=17) of all snakebite deaths.

There were only three jellyfish-related deaths. 
Discussion  
We have provided the first national analysis of the morbidity and mortality following 
envenoming in recent times, drawing together data using a Geographic Information 
System (GIS) based software collated with three routinely collected health data sets 
(AIHW hospital and COD URF, NCIS) to demonstrate the capacity of this information 
to provide demographic and geographic metrics.  
Overall, the leading causes of envenoming-related admissions in Australia was from 
contact with arthropods, followed by contact with snakes, with most deaths caused 
by either the effects of snakebite or anaphylaxis following a bee sting.  Admission 
rates due to arthropod envenoming were highest in populated areas of SA and WA, 
which reflected the higher number of deaths in these states. However, the deaths 
were not related to industries requiring handling of bees. Anaphylaxis from

for 
management25. Given the number of deaths occurring at home, in males, where 
health care is accessible, further investigation to determine which interventions can 
further mitigate these incidents is required.  
Snakebite envenoming, although pre-eminent in the public consciousness, 
constituted just 15% of admissions, third after envenoming by hornets, wasps and 
bees, and spider bite. Hospital admissions with a diagnosis of venom from snakes 
(T63.0) resulted in more than twice the deaths per admission observed following 
admissions diagnosed as venom from other arthropods (T63.4).  Snakebite is often 
thought of as an outdoor medical emergency, but our data showed the majority of 
snakebite fatalities occur around a person’s residence within a major city or inner

regional area. This is perhaps not so surprising given that several medically 
important species of snakes are abundant in the most densely settled southern and 
eastern coastal corridors of Australia from South West WA to Victoria and north 
along the eastern seaboard. Higher death rates in outer regional areas may not be 
representative due to the small numbers.  
Our use of these injury datasets demonstrates feasibility of utilising this information 
to identify geographic, organism and demographic evidence that could inform priority 
setting for policy makers, health professionals and public consumers. Ongoing 
surveillance can not only inform a national agenda, but a further decentralised review 
per Primary Health Network would better focus the needs of this injury in accordance 
with the National Health Plan. This in turn would ensure that while envenoming is a 
relatively uncommon injury, the right data is used to ensure coordinated 
implementation of informed decisions within each Primary Health Network foci. For 
example, workforce training priorities such as clinical education could be focused 
initially upon higher burden areas with the potential for online education. Localised 
and targeted public health initiatives will have a greater impact and information could 
also be used to lead a conversation in regard to the best policy for anaphylaxis 
management, venom immunotherapy and antivenom distribution for patient centred 
care. To achieve this, access to finer geospatial and clinical data will be required to 
further expand upon determinants and trends not available within the current hospital 
data provided. 
When discussing data it is important that all groups, from policy makers to health 
professionals use common language and denominators in order to align priorities.

analytic dimension. The Remoteness Structure of Australia seeks to provide a

classification for statistics by dividing Australia into areas that share common 
characteristics. The use of common subjective terms such as rural and urban need 
to be re-evaluated and potentially replaced by vocabulary that conforms to a 
structure enabling data to be analysed and compared in accordance with national 
policy metrics. 
Several limitations to our study warrant mention. First, we relied on the accuracy of 
ICD-10 coding to identify relevant hospital admissions. Coding can be affected by 
variations in the quality of coding and the numbers reported. There are no national 
standards for auditing the comparability of local, state or national coded diagnosis 
and external cause data, so it is not possible to make quantitative assessments of 
data quality on a national basis26-28. Secondly, AIHW records are de-identified, and 
while cases were chosen based on their coding for acute admitted care, multiple 
sequential admissions for the same injury could not be ascertained. Therefore these 
numbers may overestimate the overall burden. Thirdly, other researchers have 
identified changes to the ICD-10-AM third edition as having influenced the rates of 
cases attributed to X20–X29 external cause codes, leading to a suspicion that cases 
previously coded to X20 had been coded as W59.110. The data provided by AIHW 
contained a number of examples where W59.1 was used without an X or T code 
(n=6,149), and thus the burden of venomous snakebite may be underrepresented. 
Lastly, the NCIS is an administrative data set with limitations that may include cases 
that remain open (and unavailable for research use). Therefore the number of cases 
presented under-represent the true burden29 . However, a keyword search within the 
NCIS did identify cases not coded with venom related ICD-10 codes. In addition to 
the cross checking of NCIS with COD URF, we are satisfied this is as complete as 
possible without reporting open cases.

Conclusion 
This study aimed to provide contemporary epidemiological insight into venomous 
injuries based on demographics and geography in Australia. It was shown that 
operational data routinely collected are informative. The greatest burden of injury 
due to envenoming was caused by arthropods and snakes, with most deaths 
resulting from arthropod-related anaphylaxis or snake envenoming. Variations of 
injury incidence between States and Territories indicate a need for a more localised 
approach for the management of this injury. However, greater resolution of detail for 
hospital data is required in order to identify localised needs, such as per Primary 
Health Network. Our study shows that most deaths after envenoming occur in 
settings where access to health services is available. Since distance to hospital 
appears not to be a major determinant, further research is needed to investigate 
other factors that contribute to these outcomes is required. It is also important to 
improve our capacity to spatially analyse the burden of injury and mortality after 
envenoming, particularly with regard to environmental, social, ethnic and 
occupational factors. This approach can potentially lead to enhanced understanding 
of the determinants of poor outcomes after envenoming, and better inform Federal 
and State health administrations, health networks, health professionals and the 
broader community. This will lead to targeted allocation of resources, education 
strategies and help drive secondary prevention priorities.
