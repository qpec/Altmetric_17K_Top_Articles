SUMMARY
Cellular prion protein (PrPC) binds the scrapie confor-
mation of PrP (PrPSc) and oligomeric b-amyloid pep-
tide (Abo) to mediate transmissible spongiform en-
cephalopathy (TSE) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
respectively. We conducted cellular and biochemical
screens for compounds blocking PrPC interaction
with Abo. A polymeric degradant of an antibiotic tar-
gets Abo binding sites on PrPC with low nanomolar
affinity and prevents Abo-induced pathophysiology.
We then identified a range of negatively charged
polymers with specific PrPC affinity in the low to
sub-nanomolar range, from both biological (melanin)
and synthetic (poly [4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-ma-
leic acid], PSCMA) origin. Association of PSCMA
with PrPC prevents Abo/PrPC-hydrogel formation,
blocks Abo binding to neurons, and abrogates PrPSc
production by ScN2a cells. We show that oral
PSCMA yields effective brain concentrations and
rescues APPswe/PS1DE9 transgenic mice from
AD-related
synapse
loss
and
memory
deficits.
Thus, an orally active PrPC-directed polymeric agent
provides
a
potential
therapeutic
approach
to
address neurodegeneration in AD and TSE.
INTRODUCTION
Extensive evidence points to the oligomeric form of b-amyloid
peptide (Abo) as the trigger to initiate Alzheimer’s pathology
(Citron et al., 1997; Cleary et al., 2005; Hardy and Selkoe,
2002; Kostylev et al., 2015), but clinical measures to reduce brain
Ab burden have been therapeutically ineffective (Schneider et al.,
2014), inspiring exploration for alternate strategies. Discovery
that cellular prion protein (PrPC) acts as a high-affinity neuronal
receptor required for toxic Abo signaling (Gimbel et al., 2010;
Laure
´ n et al., 2009; Purro et al., 2018; Salazar et al., 2017)
has led to the identification of several effectors downstream
of Abo/PrPC interaction, such as mGluR5 (Haas et al., 2014,
2017; Haas and Strittmatter, 2016; Um et al., 2013), Fyn kinase
(Kaufman et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Um et al., 2012), and
Pyk2 kinase (Haas and Strittmatter, 2016; Kaufman et al.,
2015), that can be targeted pharmacologically to rescue the mu-
rine brain from AD model pathology. Abrogation of Abo/PrPC
interaction itself in vivo, genetically (Gimbel et al., 2010; Laure
´ n
et al., 2009) or with antibodies directed against the Abo-binding
domains on PrPC (Chung et al., 2010; Freir et al., 2011; Klyubin
et al., 2014), also reverses synaptic degeneration and restores
behavioral performance to impaired AD model mice, even as
Ab load is unaltered. These data indicate the possibility of dis-
ease intervention independently of Abo clearance and identify
Abo/PrPC interaction as an opportune nexus for pharmacolog-
ical intervention after Ab accumulation occurs.
Cell-surface PrP is a conformationally diverse protein, origi-
nally identified as effecting transmissible spongiform encepha-
lopathy (TSE) via a template-induced proteinase K-resistant
form (Colby and Prusiner, 2011). Conversion of PrPC to infectious
scrapie (PrPSc) refolds the C-terminal segment, while the toxic
action of PrPSc also requires natively unfolded N terminus (Sonati
et al., 2013). Recently, we showed that cell surface PrPC en-
gages in phase state changes between soluble, liquid, and hy-
drogel (Kostylev et al., 2018). The mobile liquid state exists at
endogenous PrPC levels present in lipid rafts. The relatively
immobile hydrogel phase is induced upon association with multi-
valent Abo. Lateral mobility of PrPC in the membrane is restricted
upon Abo association, and mGluR5 is trapped in the hydrogel.
Upon Abo association, the unstructured N-terminal PrP domain
adopts an a-helical structure, which coincides with the engage-
ment of mGluR5 and consequent synaptotoxic signaling though
Fyn and Pyk2 kinases.
Transgenic APPswe/PS1DE9 mice (APP/PS1) expressing
the human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and pre-
senilin 1 (PS1) proteins that cause early onset AD exhibit
certain pathological characteristics (Jankowsky et al., 2004).

 Age-dependent accumulation of Abo and abundant amyloid pla-
ques, synaptic degeneration, dendritic spine loss, Fyn dysregu-
lation, microglial and astrocytic activation, and multiple memory
deficits are among APP/PS1 histopathologies and functional
deficits (Brody and Strittmatter, 2018). Because later-stage AD
symptoms such as tau tangle accumulation and cell loss are
not evident in APP/PS1 and similar strains (Drummond and Wis-
niewski, 2017), these models may reflect an early AD stage, at
which Abo-directed intervention might have the greatest impact.
Here, we describe competitive antagonists of Abo/PrPC inter-
action. These compounds target PrPC Abo-binding domains,
thereby preventing Abo association with PrPC, Abo action
in vitro, and APP/PS1 phenotypes in vivo. Additionally, these
N terminus-directed ligands potently inhibit PrPSc propagation
in culture, suggesting efficacy across PrPC-mediated neurode-
generative diseases.
RESULTS
Ceftazidime Degradation Yields a Potent Polymeric
Abo/PrPC Inhibitor Termed Compound ‘‘Z’’
To search for inhibitors of Abo/PrPC interaction we engaged in a
high throughput cell-based screen using stably PrPC-trans-
fected CV-1 cells. Abo prepared from biotinylated synthetic
Ab42 peptide associates with these cells in a PrPC-dependent
fashion that can be blocked by an antibody (6D11) directed
against the Abo-binding domain at PrPC 90-111 (Figures 1A
and 1B). From a screen of 2,560 known drug and 10,130 diverse
small molecules, the cephalosporin antibiotic cefixime sample
was found to be highly inhibitory. Upon attempted validation,
neither fresh cefixime nor a range of cephalosporins was found
to possess inhibitory activity, suggesting an impurity or degrada-
tion product of cefixime was responsible (compound ‘‘X’’). To
investigate this possibility, five different cephalosporins were
allowed to stand in DMSO at 23C for 6 days before re-testing.
In addition to cefixime, ceftazidime exhibited activity resulting
from prolonged incubation (compound ‘‘Z’’), while other cepha-
losporins (cefdinir, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone) exhibited zero
activity either freshly diluted or after 6 days in DMSO (Figure 1C).
Inhibitory activity developed progressively from ceftazidime
incubated in sodium carbonate at 23�C over 9 days (Figure S1).
Compound Z Binds PrPC with Nanomolar Affinity
Potency and rate of generation from ceftazidime led to a focus on
compound Z. Fractionation by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) demonstrated broad high molecular weight of the activity
(Figures 1D and 1E), consistent with the reported polymerization
of a negatively charged R group degradant of ceftazidime (Baert-
schi et al., 1997; Ercanli and Boyd, 2006). Both cefixime and cef-
tazidime possess a negatively charged R group, while other
cephalosporins do not, consistent with this group being required
(Figure 1C). Elution of Z by high NaCl (100–130 millisiemens) in
anion exchange chromatography confirmed that Z is highly
negatively charged. Measurement of Abo-binding inhibitory ac-
tivity of the 20 kDa Z SEC fraction by PrPC-linked immunosor-
bent assay (PLISA) (Figure 2B) or PrPC binding affinity by biolayer
interferometry (BLI) (Figure 2A), indicated an EC50 of 900 pM
and KD of 1.7 nM, respectively. Conversely, Z showed no affinity
for Abo by BLI (Figure 2A), indicating specificity of affinity for
PrPC.
Abo associates with two lysine-rich domains near the PrPC
N terminus: 23–31 and 90–111. To determine whether Z directly
associates with these epitopes, we tested whether antibodies
against specific PrPC epitopes could inhibit Z binding to PrPC.
Biotinylated Z exhibited unaltered PrPC affinity in a plate-based
Z-linked immunosorbent assay (ZLISA) (Figure 2D), enabling
the evaluation of PrPC-directed agents to compete with Z. Anti-
bodies directed against PrPC in the 23–31 or 90–111 regions
were able to block soluble biotin-Z binding to plate-bound
PrPC, while antibodies directed against other PrPC domains
did not (Figure 2E), consistent with occupation of these sites
by Z. PrPC gel shift assay showed laddering of PrPC in the pres-
ence of Z that could be reversed by heating to 65�C, indicating
non-covalent reversible binding between multivalent Z and
PrPC (Figure 2C). Taken together, these data indicate Z is a
PrPC-binding reversible competitive antagonist of Abo/PrPC
interaction.
Compound Z Blocks Abo Action and PrPSc Propagation
In Vitro
Functionally, Z blocks numerous metrics of Abo action (Figure 3).
Abo association with days in vitro (DIV) 19 mouse cortical neuron
cultures is reduced by 80% in the presence of Z (Figure 3A). In
addition, co-incubation with Z fully blocks Abo-induced Fyn
activation in cortical neuron cultures detected with a phospho-
specific anti-Fyn pY416 antibody (Figure 3B). The PrPC-medi-
ated synaptotoxic action of Abo is evidenced in hippocampal
neuronal culture by an 8-fold increase in dendritic spine loss (Fig-
ure 3D). Co-administration of 100 nM Z with 1 mM Abo prevented
92% of Abo-induced spine loss in hippocampal cultures (Fig-
ure 3D). Treatment of DIV 21 hippocampal neurons for 6 hr
with a higher concentration of Abo (3 mM) exerted a neurotoxic
action evidenced by LDH release. Abo-induced LDH release
was blocked dose-dependently by Z, with an IC50 of 2 nM (Fig-
ure 3C). Given the efficacy of Z with regard to PrPC-mediated
AD phenotypes, we sought to determine whether Z could also
affect prion propagation underlying TSE. In an scN2A cell culture
PrPSc propagation assay, treatment with Z (1 mM) cleared PrPSc
infection, as detected by the elimination of proteinase K-resis-
tant PrP (Figure 3E).
Compound Z Rescues Transgenic APP/PS1 Mouse
Memory Deficits
Next, we considered whether the in vitro efficacy of Z might be
translated in vivo. Spatial memory performance by Morris water
maze (MWM) of aged APP/PS1 mice was assessed after 1 month
of treatment (Figure 4). The large size and negative charge of Z
predicted inefficient transit across the blood-brain barrier such
that polymerized compound might need to be administered cen-
trally. Therefore, we delivered Z chronically by intracerebroven-
tricular (ICV) minipump infusion beginning at 12–14 months of
age (Figures 4A–4C), when Ab accumulation and learning deficits
are well established (Gimbel et al., 2010; Haas et al., 2016; Kauf-
man et al., 2015; Kostylev et al., 2015; Salazar et al., 2017; Um
et al., 2013). CNS administration rescued mice from phenotypic
learning impairment across six twice-daily blocks of four learning

Cell Reports 26, 145–158, January 2, 2019
 trials to a hidden platform (Figure 4A) and during reversal trials to
a new location (Figure 4B). Memory performance during a 60-s
probe trial performed 24 hr after the learning trials was impaired
in vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (WT)
and restored by ICV Z treatment (Figure 4C).
We considered the possibility that fresh ceftazidime (as For-
taz) might polymerize in vivo and be distributed across the
blood-brain barrier. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) twice-daily administra-
tion of fresh non-polymerized ceftazidime (as Fortaz) to APP/
PS1 mice had no detectable effect on learning trials of spatial
memory testing (Figures 4D and 4E). Similarly, i.p. twice-daily
administration of aged 100 mg/kg Fortaz containing pre-
polymerized

deficits (not shown). Thus, antagonism of PrPC and effective
rescue of APP/PS1 behavioral deficits by Z requires central
administration.
Class of Acidic Polymers as Competitive Inhibitors of
Abo/PrPC Interaction
The activities of Z provide proof-of-principle that Abo/PrPC inter-
action can be pharmaceutically targeted with non-biologic
agents. Because inability to cross the blood-brain barrier

 constrains translational utility, we undertook an expanded PLISA
screen of 56,610 small molecules for Abo/PrPC inhibitory activity
in an effort to identify molecules with greater potential to transit
the blood-brain barrier, followed by extensive medicinal chemi-
cal optimization of 121 candidates. Although numerous activities
were developed, none achieved an IC50 below 1 mM, and thus
were deemed insufficiently potent for development.
Consequently, we sought insight from the chemical nature
of Z for a directed approach to inhibitor development. A poly-
meric ceftazidime degradant has been reported to possess
anti-HIV activity (Hobi et al., 2001) with a hypothetical structure
containing repeating acidic subunits (Baertschi et al., 1997; Er-
canli and Boyd, 2006). To explore the composition of Z, we pu-
rified active Z from aged ceftazidime by either size exclusion

 or anion exchange chromatography, followed by replicated
elemental analysis. Elemental analysis of Z did not conform
precisely to the published predicted structure but does agree
with an alternate structure with water and sodium adducts
(Figure S2). Both potential structures allow for repeating acidic
polar subunits. Based on these features, we tested structurally
related polymers to derive a structure-activity relationship
(SAR) for activity. Simple polyanionic structures, such as poly-
acrylic acid co-maleic acid, were minimally inhibitory, while the
inclusion of a hydrophobic moiety, such as in poly (styrene
co-maleic acid) partial isobutyl ester, dramatically increased
Abo/PrPC inhibition (Figure 5A). A range of polymers featuring
acidic groups proximal to cyclic hydrophobic groups exhibit
low nM activity, comparable or superior to Z (Figures 5B–
5E), indicating that acidic-hydrophobic polymers are selec-
tively active against PrPC.
Given the high affinity of PrPC for these polymers, we consid-
ered whether similar biological polymers might exhibit such ac-
tivity. We evaluated melanin and related molecules for inhibitory
activity by PLISA. Neuromelanin produced from 72 hr aqueous
degradation of norepinephrine, but not freshly solubilized norepi-
nephrine, exhibited a PLISA IC50 of 19 nM monomer equiva-
lents (not shown). Because the neuromelanin is comprised of
numerous subunits originating from monomeric norepinephrine,
the activity relative to polymeric neuromelanin MW is likely much
more potent than 19 nM. Commercial adrenochrome free base
exhibited an IC50 of 700 pM, suggesting pre-existing polymeriza-
tion (not shown).
The efficacy of specific polymers contrasts with our inability to
derive high-affinity small molecule inhibitors and suggests a min-
imum size or valency. PLISA evaluation of specific molecular
weights of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) indicates 1–10 nM IC50
for species of 17 kDa, 6.8 kDa, and 4.3 kDa, with potency
decreasing dramatically at 1.7 kDa or smaller (Figure 5B). We
speculate this inhibitor size threshold may relate to the minimum
dimension required for simultaneous contact with both Abo-
binding domains at PrP 23–31 and 90–111, either intramolecu-
larly or intermolecularly.
Our hypothesis is that polymers blocking Abo binding to PrPC
do so by the same mechanism as does Z, namely by competitive
inhibition upon PrPC binding. We examined this for poly (4-styr-
enesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) (PSCMA). Like Z, PSCMA
directly binds PrPC, with an observed KD of 540 pM by BLI (Fig-
ure 5F). Concordantly, PSCMA affinity for Abo is undetectable by
BLI and, when co-applied with full-length PrPC in solution,
completely blocks PrPC binding to an Abo-coated BLI sensor
(Figure 5G).
Next, we evaluated 17 kDa PSCMA or 3.4 kDa polystyrene sul-
fonate (PSS) activity in cellular assays. Soluble Abo interaction
with cell membrane-associated PrPC is blocked by PSCMA
with an IC50 of 3.4 nM in PrPC-transfected COS cells (Figures
6A and 6B) and 32 nM in primary neurons with endogenous
PrPC (Figures 6E and 6F). To assess Abo-induced neuronal phe-
notypes, we determined dendritic spine density of mouse 14 DIV
hippocampal neurons after 4-day exposure to 1 mM Abo in
the presence of PSS. In close agreement with PLISA activity

 (Figure 5B), PSS completely blocked Abo-induced spine toxicity
at 10 nM or greater concentration, with an EC50 of 1–10 nM (Fig-
ures 6G and 6H). Thus, the PrPC-directed polymeric inhibitors
effectively inhibit a direct functional consequence of Abo interac-
tion with neurons.
To investigate the specificity of PSCMA for PrPC as opposed
to other Abo binding sites, we considered that microglial scav-
enger receptors such as SCARA1 have been reported to act as
Abo receptors. In transfected HEK cell Abo binding, we tested
scavenger receptors related to SCARA1. We found SCARF1 to
be a high-affinity receptor with selectivity for Abo over Abm,
similar to PrPC. However, in contrast to PrPC, SCARF1 binding
of Abo is not PSCMA-sensitive even at 1 mM, 1,000-fold above
the IC50 for PrPC (Figure S3). Thus, PSCMA exhibits selectivity
for blockade of Abo binding PrPC.
We recently observed that upon Abo binding, the lateral move-
ment of PrPC within the plasma membrane is greatly reduced
as monitored by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP), with a shift from rapid to slow recovery from photo-
bleaching (Kostylev et al., 2018). To investigate the ability of
PSCMA to block Abo-triggered restriction of PrPC in a hydrogel
with Abo, we performed a set of FRAP experiments in COS7 cells
transiently transfected with a human PrP/N terminus SNAP tag
fusion construct, enabling specific fluorescent labeling of PrPC
on the cell surface. In these cells, cell-surface SNAP-Alexa
Fluor647-PrPC exhibits rapid lateral translation within the
plasma membrane, as indicated by recovery of fluorescent
signal within the laser-bleached zone over 250 s. Treatment
with 1 mM PSCMA had no measurable effect upon FRAP kinetics
compared with vehicle control (Figures 6C and 6D). Critically,
PSCMA pre-treatment completely blocked the PrPC immobiliz-
ing action of Abo (Figures 6C and 6D).
Both PSS and PSCMA function like Z with regard to potent in-
hibition of Abo binding and to protection of dendritic spines from
Abo-induced loss. We sought to test if PSCMA would also clear
PrPSc replication as does Z. PSCMA exhibits pronounced activ-
ity in an scN2A cell PrPSc propagation assay, with an IC50 be-
tween 10–40 nM (Figure 6I). PSCMA induced no observable
toxicity in N2A cells even after 5 days at 5 mM, as indicated by
unchanged cell morphology and density in culture. Thus, a com-
mon characteristic among pharmacologically active acidic poly-
mers appears to be efficacy against both AD and TSE cellular
pathophysiologies.

The ideal PrPC antagonist would be orally bioavailable and cross
the blood-brain barrier. It is not clear that relatively large acidic

Model Mice from Memory Pathology
(A and B) Ceftazidime (as Fortaz) was dissolved at
333 mg/mL in sodium carbonate per manufac-
turer’s instructions and allowed to stand 14 days at
23�C. Vehicle (veh) or aged Fortaz (Z) containing
PrP antagonist activity equal to 2 mM purified
10–20 kDa compound Z was administered intra-
cerebroventricularly (ICV) by minipump to 12- to
14-month-old wild-type (WT) or APP/PS1 (TG) mice
at a constant rate of 0.11 mL/hr for 4 weeks before
memory assessment by MWM. Assuming the 24 hr
dose distributes equally through the brain and is
cleared within 24 hr, this yields a 10 nM predicted
steady-state Z level. The same dose was continued
throughout the behavior testing period via pump
exchange. The time to reach the hidden platform
during learning of an initial platform location (A) or
a subsequent reversed platform location (B) is
plotted as a function of swim block. The vehicle-
treated APP/PS1 group differed significantly from
all other groups by one-way RM-ANOVA over the
last eight trials (two blocks) with Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test (*p < 0.05), whereas other com-
parisons were not different (p > 0.05).
(C) A 60-s probe trial test was performed 24 hr after completion of platform reversal training in the MWM. Plotted is the time spent in the area where the platform
was previously located (target area). Vehicle-treated APP/PS1 transgenic Alzheimer’s model (TG) mice spent significantly less time in the target area than WT
mice, reflecting AD memory deficit. TG mice treated with Z underwent normalization of time spent in the target area relative to WT mice treated with Z, reflecting
restored memory function. Data are mean ± SEM of 9–12 mice/group. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s comparisons as indicated.

injection twice daily for 6 weeks to 12- to 14-month-old wild-type (WT) or APP/PS1 transgenic Alzheimer’s model (TG) mice. Four weeks post-treatment

 polymers would have such characteristics. Nevertheless, high-
affinity macromolecules (antibodies) targeting PrPC have been
peripherally administered and shown to penetrate the brain at
sufficient concentration to rescue model mice from AD pheno-
types (Chung et al., 2010; Freir et al., 2011; Klyubin et al.,
2014). Because the polymers have nM affinities, comparable
to anti-PrPC antibodies, we explored the ability of orally adminis-
tered PSCMA to reach the brain at PrPC-inhibitory concentra-
tions. PSCMA-spiked brain lysate defied mass spectrometry-
based efforts of detection, likely due to charge and mass
heterogeneity of the polymer. However, phenol-chloroform
extraction retrieved activity in a ‘‘nucleic acid’’ fraction due
to general chemical similarities between PSCMA and RNA,
enabling us to characterize PSCMA-dependent Abo/PrPC inhib-
itory activity from brain. Adult mice were treated by oral gavage
with 20 kDa PSCMA, followed by assessment of brain lysate
for Abo/PrPC inhibitory activity. Twice daily administration of
40 mg/kg for 10 days yielded brain bioactivity equivalent to
40 nM (Figure 7A). Although this represents only �2% of the
2 mM concentration expected from a single dose of a perfectly
bioavailable
compound,
it
is
nearly
100-fold
above
the
PSCMA/PrPC KD of 540 pM (Figure 5F) and sufficiently high to
evaluate in a disease model. A 3 mg/kg PSCMA twice daily
dose is calculated to achieve brain concentrations 10-fold
greater than the PSCMA/PrPC KD. Studies of systemic toxicity
by survival, body weight, organ weight, blood chemistry, and
hematology revealed no concerns at this dose (Figures S4 and
S5). Survival was reduced at 40-fold higher doses.
The PrPC antagonist, PSCMA, was administered orally to APP/
PS1 mice for 30 days at the 3 mg/kg twice daily dose, followed
by MWM spatial memory testing. Importantly, treatment began
at 12 months of age, after Ab accumulation, synapse loss, and
learning and memory deficits are well established in this strain
(Gimbel et al., 2010; Haas et al., 2016; Kaufman et al., 2015; Kos-
tylev et al., 2015; Salazar et al., 2017; Um et al., 2013). This pro-
vides a therapeutic disease-modifying regime rather than a pro-
phylactic design. Mice remained on treatment throughout testing
and were examined histologically after behavioral analysis
(Figures 7B–7G). Transgene-dependent behavioral impairment
was evidenced by increased swim latency to the hidden platform
by APP/PS1 mice compared to age- and sex-matched WT mice
(Figure 7F). Oral PSCMA rescued mice from pre-existing pheno-
typic learning and memory impairment, as evidenced by a return
of APP/PS1 swim latency to a duration indistinguishable from
WT, in both forward trials (Figure 7F) and training trials performed
after reversal of the submerged platform location (Figure 7F).
One day after the final learning swim, a probe trial in the absence
of the platform was conducted to test memory for the learned
location. The APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle spent signifi-
cantly less time in the target quadrant than did APP/PS1 or WT
mice treated with PSCMA (Figure 7G), indicating that PSCMA
treatment corrected a pre-existing learning and memory deficit
in APP/PS1 mice.
To determine whether behavioral recovery reflected repair of
transgene-dependent synaptic damage, we examined hippo-
campal synaptic architecture. The presynaptic marker SV2a ex-
hibited a 42% reduction in area occupied by immunoreactive
puncta within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of
APP/PS1 compared to WT mice (Figures 7B and 7C). PSCMA
treatment rescued APP/PS1 mice from synapse loss with
restoration of presynaptic SV2a immunoreactivity to WT levels
(Figures 7B and 7C). Post-synaptic degeneration detected by
PSD-95 staining showed a similar but non-significant statistical
trend between transgenic and WT mice, with PSCMA correct-
ing the transgene-dependent deleterious trend (Figures 7D
and 7E).
Previous investigations of the role of the Abo/PrPC axis in AD
have shown restoration of learning and memory performance
as well as synapse density by PrPC pathway blockade, while
Ab plaque load and neuroinflammatory hallmarks of astrogliosis
and microgliosis persisted (Chung et al., 2010; Gimbel et al.,
2010; Salazar et al., 2017; Um et al., 2013). Similar to previous
PrPC-pathway-directed experiments, the treatment with PSCMA
did not alter Ab plaque area in APP/PS1 mice (Figure S6). In addi-
tion, there was no change in the elevated astrocytic GFAP and
microglial Iba1 in APP/PS1 animals treated with PSCMA as
compared to vehicle (Figure S6). This is consistent with PSCMA
selectively blocking PrPC-mediated synaptic effects in APP/PS1
mice, without modulating Ab metabolism or glial reaction to pro-
tein deposition.
DISCUSSION
The PrPC-dependence of the AD phenotype in APP/PS1 trans-
genic model mice has enabled elucidation of AD signaling
pathway components (Brody and Strittmatter, 2018). Antibodies
directed against the Abo-binding domains of PrPC have proven
effective preclinically, but no chemical antagonist has yet been
developed to target this proximal site of AD induction by Abo
in vivo (Chung et al., 2010; Freir et al., 2011; Klyubin et al.,
2014; Purro et al., 2018). Although the large surface area contact
of protein-protein interactions are challenging targets for phar-
macological intervention with small molecules, the potential
experimental and therapeutic utility of a chemical tool for Abo/
PrPC blockade compelled us to search for such agents. High-af-
finity small molecule inhibitors were not identified during exten-
sive screening and medicinal chemistry efforts. However, higher
MW polymers with repeating negatively charged and hydropho-
bic moieties possess anti-PrPC activity. Our findings show that
such polymers can be optimized to bind PrPC with robust affinity,

completely inhibited by PSCMA (1 mM). PSCMA exhibits no affinity for Abo (100–200 s, right sensorgram) indicating specificity for PrPC.

 effectively block Abo binding, and intervene in the AD pathway
in vitro and in vivo.
The discovery of compound Z, a polymer that spontaneously
forms from degradation products of the cephalosporin antibiotic
ceftazidime, revealed these active polymers bind the PrPC N ter-
minus specifically in the two domains mediating high-affinity Abo
interaction. Individual positively charged lysine residues within a
given Abo-binding region of PrPC contribute in an additive
fashion to Abo affinity, potentially via electrostatic interactions
with negatively charged domains of Abo (Kostylev et al., 2018).
Avidity effects between bivalent PrPC and multivalent Abo yield
low nM affinity. We posit the charge distribution structure of Z
and analogs mimics Abo, interacting electrostatically with posi-
tively charged residues in the Abo binding domains of PrPC. As
a result, Z and its analogs act as potent reversible competitive
antagonists of Abo/PrPC interaction.
We independently identified numerous compounds as active
Abo/PrPC inhibitors that had been previously reported as PrPSc
inhibitors, including epigallocatechin gallate, tannic acid, tricy-
clic antidepressants and antipsychotics, porphyrins, and dyes
(unpublished observations). In our hands, the PLISA activity of
these molecules was variable and reduced by charcoal filtration
or size filtration. All submicromolar-potent hits from a 56,610-
compound screen were not reproduced upon resynthesis or
charcoal filtration (unpublished observations). This contrasts
with the stability and reproducibility of polymeric inhibitors. We
hypothesize that these observations derive from a necessity
for inhibitor multivalency in order to interact with the two distinct
Abo-binding domains of PrPC. The covalent linkage among
charged polymer regions maintains capacity for multivalent as-
sociation with bivalent PrPC and consequent high avidity. We
speculate that nominally ‘‘small’’ molecules acquire the multiva-
lency though non-covalent aggregation, accounting for ephem-
eral activity. This requirement for multiple charged regions within
an inhibitor is evidenced by the three order-of-magnitude differ-
ence between the IC50s of 3.4 kDa and 1.7 kDa polystyrene sul-
fonate. Given the mapping of Z interaction to two Abo sites on
PrPC, as well as the polymer activity size-dependence, it is likely
that high avidity requires interaction between two basic Abo-
binding sites on PrPC with two acidic polymer regions, intensified
by hydrophobic polymer constituents locally driving polymer to
protein affinity.
While active polymers appear to mimic Abo in binding site and
mechanism, they lack agonist activity. Downstream functional
consequences of Abo/PrPC interaction, such as PrPC immobili-
zation at the cell surface, Fyn kinase activation, dendritic spine
loss, neurotoxicity, and memory impairment are not induced
by the polymers. We tested Z, PSCMA, and PSS for antagonist
activity toward multiple consequences of Abo/PrPC interaction.
Upon Abo binding at the cell surface, PrPC exhibits dramatic
lateral mobility inhibition, as evidenced by FRAP. Subsequent
dendritic spine retraction and cytotoxicity results from toxic
PrPC signaling mediated in part by Fyn activation. Each of these
Abo-induced neuropathologies were completely blocked by Z,
PSCMA, or PSS, indicating effective abrogation of the Abo/
PrPC axis by competitive inhibition.
Numerous neurodegenerative diseases have recently been
found to involve proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase transi-
tions (LLPT), including FUS, TIA1, TDP-43, hnRNPA1, and tau
(Banani et al., 2017; Hyman et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017).
The role of the phase states in the pathophysiology of the asso-
ciated diseases remains an open area of investigation. Previ-
ously, no drug-based method of phase change intervention
has been developed and shown to influence disease mecha-
nism. Recently, we described PrPC as the first example of cell-
surface membrane-bound protein to undergo LLPT (Kostylev
et al., 2018) Additionally, we found that PSCMA prevents the
Abo-induced conversion of PrPC to hydrogel state and reverses
Abo/PrPC hydrogel once formed, establishing that it is possible
to pharmacologically target phase transition of disease-related
proteins. Our findings here, that PSCMA blocks Abo-induced
PrPC immobility at the cell surface and rescues APP/PS1 mice
from AD model pathophysiology, demonstrates that it is
possible to develop
phase change-based intervention
to
address neurodegeneration.
Previous studies have identified polymeric inhibitors of the
conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in TSE. Specifically, dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS) and pentosan polysulfate (PPS) exhibit anti-prion
activity in vitro (Caughey and Raymond, 1993). As with the poly-
mers here, DSS and PPS possess charged and hydrophobic
(C) SNAP-tagged PrPC-transfected COS7 cells were treated with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor647 to fluorescently label cell-surface PrP. Cells were treated with
vehicle 1 hr,1 mM Abo for 1 hr, 1 mM PSCMA for 1 hr, or PSCMA for 15 min followed by Abo for 1 hr. A 50 mm2 square of fluorescent PrP was bleached with a burst of
laser light, and recovery of PrP into the bleached area though lateral PrP diffusion in the plasma membrane monitored over 250 s. Scale bar, 1 mm.
(D) Quantification of recovery in (C). Vehicle and PSCMA treatment fluorescence recovery curves were indistinguishable. Abo treatment strongly inhibited PrPC
recovery kinetics, indicating arrested lateral mobility of PrPC in the plasma membrane as a result of Abo/PrPC complexation. PSCMA pre-treatment completely
prevented Abo-induced inhibition PrPC recovery kinetics.

 groups, suggesting they may also possess Abo/PrPC inhibitory
activity. Indeed, DSS has been reported to partially inhibit Abo/
PrPC interaction (Aimi et al., 2015). Our evaluation confirmed
Abo/PrPC inhibition by DSS and PPS, but with a potency orders
of magnitude weaker than the single nM activity observed for the
active polymers reported here. Given the evident similarities but
superior potency of the polymers described here, we considered
whether they were capable of inhibiting PrPSc propagation
in vitro. Both Z and PSCMA blocked PrPSc propagation in
scN2A culture, with PSCMA exhibiting an IC50 between 10 and
40 nM to clear PrPSc from neuroblastoma cells. To the extent
that the PrPC N terminus Abo-binding domains mediates interac-
tion with these compounds, inhibition of PrPSc propagation im-
plicates the N terminus domains prion formation. Given our

(A) WT mice were administered 40 mg/kg (mpk) PCMA by oral gavage twice daily for 10 days, followed by perfusion, brain lysis, extraction, and PLISA assessment
of Abo/PrPC inhibitory activity. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 6 mice. Standard curve was made by spiking brain lysate from untreated mice with the designated
concentrations of PSCMA, prior to identical processing as brains from treated mice. Orally dosed mouse brain contains an average 40 nM PSCMA. Data are

 finding that twice-daily oral administration of 40 mg/kg PSCMA
yields �40 nM PSCMA in brain, it will be of interest to investigate
PSCMA inhibition of TSE. Because our biochemical assays uti-
lized human PrPC and our functional AD assays were in murine
systems, it is clear these polymers act across species. It remains
to be tested whether these polymers might have broader strain
and species specificity than previously reported anti-PrPSc com-
pounds (Lu et al., 2013).
The non-pathological function of PrPC is an open matter of
study. Our finding that neuromelanin potently interferes with
PrPC binding to Abo raises the possibility that a physiological
role for PrPC may involve high-affinity interaction with melanin
produced endogenously. Given the synaptic presence of PrPC,
where high catecholamine concentrations may lead to extracel-
lular melanin formation, this interaction may bear significance in
processes yet to be investigated, such as neuromelanin clear-
ance or toxicity mediation.
Blockade of PrPC with PSCMA reversed synaptic loss and
memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice even though microgliosis
and astrocytosis persisted. While a range of human genetic data
implicate microgliosis and microglia proteins such as TREM2 in
AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013; Ulrich et al.,
2017), this is not inconsistent with the lack of microglial change
during rescue with PrPC antagonist. On the one hand, the obser-
vations may be explained by an upstream microglial action
related to Ab accumulation or plaque compaction (Condello
et al., 2018), which is unaffected by downstream blockade of
Abo/PrPC at postsynaptic sites. Other data suggest that micro-
glia participate in synaptic damage triggered by Abo (Hong
et al., 2016). In this case, the action of Abo/PrPC complexes
may be essential to ‘‘tag’’ damaged synapses for downstream
engulfment by microglia. When PrPC/mGluR5 signaling is
blocked by PSCMA, subsets of synapses may no longer be
marked for destruction by microglia. Confirmation of current re-
sults and investigation of potential synaptic mechanisms in addi-
tional AD models will aid in establishing the relevance to clinical
translation.
It has been shown that PrPC accounts for 50% of punctate
neuronal Abo binding (Laure
´ n et al., 2009). While evidence points
to Abo/PrPC interaction mediating AD synaptopathology, other
pathological aspects of AD are not explained by Abo action
though PrPC (Purro et al., 2018; Salazar et al., 2017; Smith and
Strittmatter, 2017). As mentioned above, neuroinflammation is
unaffected in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by Prnp deletion or by
drugs
targeting
PrP-dependent
downstream
mechanisms
(Haas et al., 2016, 2017; Salazar et al., 2017; Um et al., 2013).
The finding that PSCMA and other polymers block 90% of Abo
binding to neurons, but at concentrations greater than the IC50
for Abo/PrPC inhibition (Figures 3A, 6E, and 6F), suggests that
other non-PrPC lower-polymer-affinity neuronal Abo receptors
may also be inhibited by PSCMA. These receptors remain to
be identified, but apparently share a common Abo binding mech-
anism with PrPC, which is similarly inhibited by these polymers.
At the low PSCMA dose we achieved in vivo during treatment
of APP/PS1 mice, it is unlikely that alternate low-affinity recep-
tors were inhibited. Clearly, not all Abo receptors are sensitive
to PSCMA, because we found that the scavenger receptor
SCARF1 binds Abo with high affinity but, in contrast to PrPC, is
not PSCMA-sensitive. The essentially complete extinction of
Abo binding to neurons, while binding to microglial SCARF1 is
unaffected, demonstrates a cell-type specificity for PSCMA ac-
tion and suggests neuronally mediated APP/PS1 phenotype
rescue. Further experimentation will be necessary to determine
whether PSCMA action is limited to neurons or also has a bene-
ficial role in blocking Abo disruption of vascular function or
blood-brain barrier integrity via endothelial PrPC.
The development of acidic polymeric inhibitors of Abo/PrPC
interaction provides a tool for investigation of AD and demon-
strates the feasibility of pharmaceutically intervening with a com-
pound directed at this mechanism of AD etiology. Although these
high-affinity PrP-interactors share characteristics with Abo, such
as multivalency, rapid on- and slow off-rate kinetics, and dual
PrPC binding-domain specificity, they do not share the toxic
pathway-inducing activity of Abo, and thus act as potent
competitive inhibitors of Abo function. Rescue of AD model
mice with oral administration suggests that these compounds,
or compounds similar to them, could provide a therapeutically
tractable strategy at early stages of AD, when the role of Ab
accumulation in disease progression is most clear. The inhibition
of PrPSc propagation as well suggests that a single PrPC-tar-
geted drug might address both AD and TSE pathologies, and
that targeting phase transitions will be therapeutically effective
in neurodegenerative conditions.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Transgenic and control mouse strains
Mice were cared for by the Yale Animal Resource Center and all experiments were approved by Yale’s Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and performed in accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).
Wild-type and APPswe/PS1DE9 mice (APP/PS1) (Jankowsky et al., 2003, 2004) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and
maintained on a C57/Bl6J background as described previously (Gimbel et al., 2010; Um et al., 2012, 2013). All experiments were
conducted in a blinded fashion with respect to genotype and treatment, and groups were matched for age and sex, and groups con-
tained 45%–55% of each sex.
METHOD DETAILS
Aßo preparation
Biotinylated and unlabeled synthetic Ab1-42 peptide are obtained as lyophilized powder from The ERI Amyloid Laboratory, LLC (Ox-
ford, CT). Preparation and characterization of Ab1-42 oligomers (Abo) have been described previously (Um et al., 2012). Ab monomer
is dissolved at 10 mg/ml in HFIP and boiled in water bath 1 h at 70C, then cooled on ice, transferred to 2 mL microfuge and tubes spun
7 min at 12,000 x g. Avoiding pellet, 50 ml (0.5 mg) is aliquoted in a 1.6 mL microfuge tube and allowed to evaporate completely in
chemical hood (24 h), followed by a minimum of 1 h in a speed vac. An observable clear film surrounds the inside tip of the tube.
Closed tubes are stored at RT for later oligomer preparation. To prepare oligomers, add 40 ml DMSO to tube, allow to stand
20 min with occasional flicking/trituration to suspend peptide, wiping down tube sides to insure no un-dissolved peptide remains.
Aliquot 20 ml/1.6 mL microfuge tube. Add 1 mL phenol red-free F12 (Atlanta Biologicals cat # M15350) to tubes for 0.25 mg/ml final
conc. Let stand O/N at RT. Spin 15 min at 14000 rpm - there is usually no pellet; a large pellet indicates an unsuccessful prep. Aliquots
can be frozen for later use. Binding assays show consistent results over at least 72 h post F12 addition. Concentrations of Abo are
expressed in monomer equivalents, with 1 mM total Ab1-42 peptide corresponding to approximately 10 nM oligomeric species
(Laure
´ n et al., 2009).
Cell-based Screen for small molecule inhibitors of Aßo/PrPC interaction
CV1 cells stably transfected with rat PrP were plated in 96 well tissue culture plates (Corning, 354461) 24 h prior to application of small
molecule library components dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO (10 mM final concentration) for 1 h prior to addition of biotinylated Aßo
(1 mM final concentration). Wells were fixed 25 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, blocked 1 h in PBS containing
5% goat serum (GIBCO, 16210-064). 50 ml 1:1000 Eu-labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer, 1244-360) in DELFIA assay buffer
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added per well for 30 min. After washing five times in PBST, 50 mL of DELFIA Enhancement Solution
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied to each well, and time-resolved europium fluorescence was measured using a Victor 3 plate
reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Compounds were assayed in singlet, with hits defined as inhibition exceeding 50% of
Aßo-dependent signal, with assay plates exhibiting a Z’ over 0.5 relative to anti-PrP positive control antibody 6D11 (Covance).
Hits were validated at 10 mM in triplicate in a similar assay, with visual inspection of each treatment for cell toxicity and detachment.
Compounds inducing obvious cellular toxicity were eliminated from further study. Non-toxic active compounds were subjected to
dose-response evaluation in triplicate in the same cell-based format. Libraries screened were Enzo FDA Approved Drugs Library
(Enzo), Microsource Pharm 1600 (Microsource) and Yale Small Molecule Discovery Center compound collection.

 Immunocytochemistry
COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 cells
transfected 2 days earlier with PrPC expression vector were pre-incubated with inhibitor in F12 media at 22�C for 30 min. Biotin–
Ab42 oligomers were added to a concentration of 500 nM monomer equivalent for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed
25 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice with PBS, blocked 1 h with 5% goat serum in PBS, incubated in 0.1%
488-streptavidin (Life technologies, S11223) in PBS 1 h, washed twice and visualized on an ImageExpress Micro (Molecular Devices).
Images were analyzed using ImageJ. Alternatively, higher resolution images were capture from cells cultured on poly-lysine coated
glass with a Zeiss confocal microscope.
Size-exclusion Chomatography (SEC)
Aged ceftazidime (as 14-day reconstituted Fortaz) was separated on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences) using AKTA purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). 200 ml of sample was injected at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. PBS,
pH 7.4, was used as a mobile phase. Fractions of 0.5 mL were continuously collected thoughout the run and analyzed for PLISA ac-
tivity or selected for Z quantitation.
Z concentration measurement
The SEC fraction of aged Fortaz corresponding to 15 kDa was collected, exchanged into water though extensive washes with a 3 kDa
filter (Amicon, UFC500396), and desiccated. Weighed material (a light brown powder) was resolubilized in PBS and absorbance
determined at 280 nm to determine concentration.
Anion-exchange Chomatography
Aged ceftazidime (as 14-day 440 mM reconstituted Fortaz in sodium carbonate) was separated on an XK 50/20 column (GE Health-
care Life Sciences) packed with Q Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, 17-0510-01) with a 0.5-2.0 M NaCl gradient. Fractions
eluting at 100-120 millisiemens were used as Z.
Biolayer Interferometry
Biotinylated Aßo or full-length human PrPC biotinylated by incubation in 2-fold molar excess biotin-NHS (Thermo Scientific, 21329)
2 h in PBS at RT were coated onto streptavidin Biosensors (ForteBio, 18-5019) and exposed to dilution series of solutes as described
in Figures 2A, 5F, and 5G in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, P7949) and 0.1% BSA. Association curves were detected and
analyzed using an Octet biolayer interferometer (ForteBio).
Blue Native PAGE shift assay
Recombinant human PrPC (1 mM) was incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mM Z for 10 min in 0.25X PBS at room temperature.
Following the incubation, the samples were loaded on 4%–16% NOVEX Bis-Tris gel (ThermoFisher) and separated according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. To demonstrate the requirement of native PrPC structure for complexation with compound Z,
some samples were heated in 65C heatblock for 10 minutes prior to BN-PAGE separation to denature the protein. Following the
BN-PAGE, the gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes using iBlot semi-dry transfer (ThermoFisher), the membranes were dried
and the excess of Coomassie dye was removed by washing the membrane in methanol thee times for 5 min to avoid interference with
subsequent immunoblotting. The membranes were then washed 3X with water, blocked using fluorescent western blot blocking
buffer (Rockland) and immunoblotted with 1:500 SAF-32 mouse anti-PrPC antibody (Cayman Chemical) in TBS-T followed by
800CW-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Li-Cor). Immunoblots were imaged using Li-Cor Odyssey near-infrared
scanner.
Assay for Aßo binding to immobilized PrPC (PLISA)
MaxiSorp 384 well white microplates (ThermoFisher Scientific, 460372) were coated overnight with 20 ml/well of 250 nM human full
length PrPC in 30 mM Na2CO3, 80 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, at 4�C. After washing two times with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), the
plates were blocked with 100 ml/well protein-free T20 PBS blocking buffer (Pierce, 37573) for 1 h at 23C. After thee PBST washes,
20 ml samples diluted in PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) were applied to microplates in triplicate and incubated 1 h at RT. 20 ml of syn-
thetic biotinylated Abo in PBSTB (5 nM monomer equivalent) was added for 2 h. Plates were then washed four times with PBST and
incubated 1 h with 20 ml 1:1000 Eu-labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer, 1244-360) in DELFIA assay buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Finally, after washing five times in PBST, 20 mL of DELFIA Enhancement Solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied, and time-
resolved europium fluorescence measured using a Victor 3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Biochemical small molecule screen
PLISA was used to screen 56,610 unique compounds not included in the initial cell-based screen. Libraries screened were
MicroSource GenPlus (Microsource), Yale compound collection, and ChemDiv Diversity Library (ChemDiv). Small molecule library
components are stored dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO (10 mM final concentration) and added in singlet to PrP-coated wells of a
384-well plate containing PBST for a final concentration of 10 mM. After 30 min, PBST containing biotinylated Abo was added for
e4

 a final Abo concentration of 5 nM, incubated @ RT 2 h and developed per PLISA protocol. Hits exceeding 50% signal inhibition were
evaluated further.
Z-binding PrP-epitope mapping
A MaxiSorp 384 well white microplate (ThermoFisher Scientific, 460372) was coated overnight with 20 ml/well of 250 nM human full
length PrPC in 30 mM Na2CO3, 80 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, at 4�C. After two PBST washes, the plates were blocked with 100 ml/well
protein-free T20 PBS blocking buffer (Pierce, 37573) for 1 h at 23�C. After 3 PBST washes, 20 mL of anti-PrP antibodies (8B4, Santa
Cruz Biotech, sc-47729; 5058, Millipore Sigma, AB5058; 8G8, Cayman chemical,189760; 6D11, Covance, SIG-399810; Pri 308,
Cayman Chemical, 189750; 8H4, abcam, ab61409; SAF70, Cayman Chemical, 189770) diluted 1:50 in PBST were applied to wells
in triplicate and incubated 1 h at RT. Twenty ml of 50 nM Z biotinylated by incubation in 10-fold molar excess biotin-NHS (Thermo
Scientific, 21329) 2 h in PBS at RT was added per well for 2 h. Plates were washed four times with PBST and incubated 1 h with
20 ml 1:1000 Eu-labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer, 1244-360) in DELFIA assay buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, after 3
PBST washes, 20 mL of DELFIA Enhancement Solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied, and time-resolved europium fluo-
rescence \ measured (Victor 3V PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Melanin Synthesis
Norepinephine bitartrate salt (Sigma Aldrich A0937) was dissolved at 50 mg/ml in H2O, brought to pH 8.5 with ammonium hydroxide
and allowed to stand at RT at least 72 h, forming a black solution.
PrPSc Propagation Assay
Chonically PrPSc-infected scN2a cells, RML strain, were cultured in Delbucco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine
and 4.5 g/L glucose plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin. 10 mM and 5 mM stock so-
lutions of compounds Z and PSCMA, respectively, were prepared in PBS and stored at 4�C for no longer than 1 week prior to use.
Compound stock solutions or PBS alone (vehicle) were added to culture medium and working concentrations obtained via serial dilu-
tion. Trypsinized ScN2a cells were split 1:10 and allowed to adhere to plates in compound-free media for 12 h, at which point medium
containing the treatment compound was added. Cells were grown for 3 days to confluence with a media exchange at 36 h. Cells were
trypsinized, split 1:10 and again allowed to adhere in compound-free media for 12 h, and then returned to compound-containing me-
dium for an additional 3 days prior to processing. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% w/v
Na deoxycholate, 0.5% v/v NP-40). Lysate was centrifuged at 2,100 x g for 30 s to pellet DNA. 10% of the resulting supernatant was
added to an equal volume of 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled at 95�C for 10 min and saved as the minus proteinase K (–PK) sam-
ple. To the remaining supernatant, PK was added to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and samples were digested shaking at 37�C for
30 min prior to quenching with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final concentration of 5 mM. PK-digested
samples were centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4�C and the pellet was resuspended in equal volumes of lysis buffer and 2x
SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to boiling and analysis via SDS-PAGE and western blot. Western blotting was carried out with
GE8 primary antibody at 1:2000 and HP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody at 1:5000.
Immunoblots
Proteins were electrophoresed though precast 4%–20% tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred with an iBlotTM Gel Transfer De-
vice (Novex-Life Technologies) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer for fluores-
cent western blotting (Rockland MB-070-010) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated overnight in primary antibodies at 4�C.
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Fyn (Cell Signaling Technology 4023; 1:1,000), anti-phospho-Src (Cell Signaling
Technology 2101; 1:1,000). appropriate secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature (Odyssey donkey anti-mouse
or donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to IRDye 680 or IRDye 800, LI-COR Biosciences) and proteins were visualized with a LI-COR
Odyssey infrared imaging system. Quantification of band intensities was performed within a linear range of exposure.
Neuronal culture and Aßo binding
Brain cortices and hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 13 pups removed from CO2-euthanized pregnant C57/Bl6 mice,
dissociated by incubating in 0.25% trypsin 10 min at 37C, followed by gentle trituration in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with
2% B27, 1% Glutamax, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% pen/strep and 0.2% FBS, filtration though a 40 um filter and plated at 30,000 cells/
well in a polylysine-coated 96 well plate. After DIV 14, wells were treated with Z or PSCMA at the specified concentrations 30 min by
adding to the conditioned media, followed by addition of biotinylated Aßo for 2 h, after which cells were washed once with PBS, fixed
25 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, washed 3 times with PBS, blocked 1 h in PBST with 5% goat serum, incubated overnight at 4�C
with designated antibody in PBST (SV2a, Abcam 32942, 1:250; NeuN, Millipore, mab377, 1:500 or actin, Cell Signaling Technology,
4967S, 1:500), followed by washing twice with PBS and incubating 2 h in cognate secondary antibodies, DAPI and 0.1% 555-strep-
tavidin (Invitrogen, S32355) in PBST, followed by washing twice in PBS and imaging with an ImagExpress (Molecular Devices). Signal
was quantitated with ImageJ. Alternatively, stained neurons cultured on poly-D-lysine-coated glass were imaged with a Nikon
Eclipse Ti Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope.

 Cell Transfection and Aßo Staining
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with full length human PrPC or human SCARF1
(Transomic, clone ID pCS6(BC039735)) using lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent. Thee days post transfection, cells in condi-
tioned media were treated with 1 mM PSCMA or PBS vehicle for 30 min prior to addition of biotinylated Aßo at final 1 mM monomer
equivalent concentration for an additional 2 h. Cells were washed 1 x with PBS, fixed 25 min in 4% formaldehyde, washed 3x in PBS,
blocked 1 h in 5% normal goat serum, incubated 1 h in 488-streptavidin (Molecular Probes), washed 3x in PBS and imaged with an
ImageXpress Micro XLS Widefield High-Content Analysis System (Molecular Devices).
Imaging of Dendritic Spine Stability (Z)
Hippocampal neurons of various genotype were obtained from E17-19 mouse embryos (Um et al., 2012). After hippocampal diges-
tion with papain (37�C; 5% CO2 for 30 min), the neurons were transfected with myristoyl-GFP expression vector by Amaxa Nucle-
ofector. Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well on poly-D-lysine-coated glass 8 well plates (Lab-Tek Chambered Coverslip
155411). The culture medium was Neurobasal A supplemented with 1X penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMax,
and B27 supplement with weekly replenishment. After 19-23 DIV, neurons were imaged with a 100X objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti
Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope using a 488 laser. A 10 mm Z stack at 0.1 mm intervals was obtained every 15 min over 6 hours
from multiple fixed locations per 8-well dish with an automated stage. 500 nM Aß oligomer or F12 vehicle control were added
after one hour of imaging and additional images collected over 5 hours. In some conditions, 50 nM Z or drug vehicle control were
added immediately before Aß or vehicle. Spine number in consecutive images for specific dendritic segments was measured using
ImageJ software without knowledge of drug or genotype. For each condition, at least 4 segments with 30 spines at time zero were
assessed.
LDH release
Cell toxicity was quantitatively assessed by the measurement of Lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the medium. LDH activity in
the culture medium was measured by Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche) according to manufacturer’s procedure. In brief, 60 mL of
supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96 well plate and 60 mL of reconstituted substrate solution was added to each
well and then the plates were incubated for 30 min. Total LDH release was achieved by adding 2% Triton X-100 solution to untreated
control cells. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 490 nm using a VictorX3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). The
values were expressed as a percent of the total LDH release.
Animal Treatment
For Morris water maze, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups and the experimenter was unaware of both genotype and
treatment group. Groups were balanced for age, sex, and weight. Mice used were 12-14 months of age at experiment initiation. Dur-
ing treatment, the experimenter was blinded to genotype. For drug treated mice, Poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid co-maleic acid) was
administered by twice daily oral gavage of 5.0 mg and 15.0 mg Poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid co-maleic acid) per kg body weight in
a vehicle of 0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 0.1% w/v polysorbate 80 to APP/PS1 and WT mice, respectively. Vehicle
treated animals were gavaged twice daily with vehicle. 500 mg ceftazidime as Fortaz was dissolved per manufacturer’s instructions in
1.5 mL sterile milliQ H2O to obtain 333 mg/ml in sodium carbonate solution. Animals treated peripherally with fresh ceftazidime were
injected directly after dissolution intraperitoneally with 100 mg ceftazidime per kg body weight in a vehicle of PBS. Animals treated
centrally with aged ceftazidime were fitted with an intracerebroventricular cannula (Alzet brain infusion kit 0008663) and subcutane-
ous osmotic minipump (Alzet model 1004) loaded with aged ceftazidime diluted in PBS. All animals were treated for 4 weeks prior to
the Morris water maze and thoughout assessment.
Behavioral Testing
Morris water maze was performed as previously described (Morris, 1984; Smith et al., 2018). Thoughout experimentation, the exper-
imenter was blinded to treatment group, and genotype. Each animal was handled by the experimenter for five minutes each day for
thee consecutive days preceding the initiation of behavioral experiments to minimize animal stress on testing days. The testing pool
was �1 m in diameter with four unique spatial cues placed evenly around the perimeter. For learning swims, a clear plastic platform
was submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water and fixed to the bottom of the pool in the target quadrant. For each swim a
mouse was placed in the water facing the pool wall opposite the target quadrant in one of four positions. The sequence of the entry
positions was changed for each of the six trial blocks.
For a single trial block, each animal was swum four times. For each swim mice were given 60 s to locate the hidden platform. Mice
were given a 60 s rest interval with access to a heating lamp between swims. Trial blocks were initiated every 12 hours over thee
consecutive days for a total of 6 trial blocks. If a mouse failed to locate the hidden platform in the allotted time during trial blocks
one or two, the mouse was gently guided to the platform and placed there for 15 s. The reverse swim began the day after completion
of the forward swims and followed the same protocol with the hidden platform placed in the quadrant opposite that of the forward
swims.
Twenty-four hours after the last learning trial block of the reverse swim, the platform was removed from the pool for the probe trial.
During the probe trial, each animal was placed in the pool once and allowed to freely swim for 60 s. For all swims animals were tracked
e6

 using SMART 3.0 software (Panlab, S.L. - Harvard Apparatus, Inc, Holliston, MA) with a JVC Everio G-series camcorder (Yokohama,
Japan).
To account for differences in visual acuity, a marker that extended above the surface of the water was placed on the platform and
mice we placed in the water facing the wall opposite the platform. Latency to reach the visible platform was recorded and any animals
that did not reach the platform within two standard deviations of the mean were excluded from analysis. For analysis of the learning
swims, a single mouse’s latency to find the platform was averaged across four swims to generate a trial average.
Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)
COS-7 green monkey kidney cells (ATCC� CRL-1651) were passaged in high-glucose DMEM (ThermoFisher, 11965092) supple-
mented with sodium pyruvate, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and Pen/Strep antibiotic mix. Trypsinized cells were seeded in 8-well cham-
bered sterile coverglass slides (ThermoFisher, 155411) at 10000 cells/well in 250 ml of complete growth medium and cultured over-
night. The following day, the cells were transfected with a total of 200 ng DNA/well using Lipofectamine 3000 lipid transfection
reagent (ThermoFisher, L3000015) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
For fluorescent labeling, cells expressing SNAP-PrP were incubated with 500 nM SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor647 in complete me-
dium for 30 min at 37�C. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium (Sigma, D8662) to remove
the excess labeling fluorophores and then incubated for 15 min in PBSCa,Mg with 1 mM PSCMA or PBSCa,Mg alone as a control. Abo or
PBS (vehicle) was subsequently applied to 1 mM final concentration for 1 h at 37�C and cells were then imaged at room temperature.
All FRAP experiments were performed on UltraVIEW VoX (Perkin Elmer) SDC microscope equipped with PhotoKinesis FRAP unit
using 60x oil immersion objective. Images were collected every second for 7 s. before bleaching to measure the baseline fluores-
cence. Following the bleaching cycle, the imaging was performed with 1 s intervals for the first 30 s and with 4 s intervals for an addi-
tional 220 s. 640 nm laser was used for selective photobleaching of SNAP-PrP conjugated with Alexa 647. All the imaging was per-
formed in the apical membrane of the cells and at least thee 2x2 mm areas per cell were bleached to average the intrinsic variability in
the protein mobility between the regions of the plasma membrane. Quantitation of fluorescence recovery was performed in Volocity
software (PerkinElmer).
Immunohistology
Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, perfused with cold PBS and brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 72 h at 4�C. Brains were sliced into 40 mm coronal brain sections using a Leica WT1000S vibratome. Sections were permea-
bilized in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. All slices underwent an antigen retrieval step prior to exposure to primary antibody by
incubating slices in 1x Reveal Decloaker buffer (RV1000M, Biocare Medical) for 15 min at 90C in an oven. After antigen retrieval, sec-
tions were blocked in 10% normal horse serum (Jackson ImmunoResarch Laboratories) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature and
then incubated with primary antibodies for 24 hours at 4C. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein; Abcam ab4674; 1:500), anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; Wako 019-19741; 1:250), anti-
PSD95 (postsynaptic density protein 95; Invitrogen 51-6900; 1:250), and anti-SV2a (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A; Abcam
32942; 1:250). Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or donkey
anti-chicken fluorescent antibodies; Invitrogen Alexa Fluor; 1:500) for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, the
sections were mounted onto glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific) and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories
H-1200) antifade aqueous mounting medium.
Imaging and analysis of immunohistochemistry
For imaging of synapse density stained by anti-SV2a and anti-PSD95 antibodies, a Zeiss 800 confocal microscope with a 63X 1.4 NA
oil-immersion lens was used. The area occupied by immunoreactive synaptic puncta from the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus
was measured as described previously (Gimbel et al., 2010). For imaging and analysis of the tissue stained for Iba1 and GFAP, a Zeiss
800 confocal microscope with a 20X 0.3 NA air-objective lens was used and a full tiled z stack of the hippocampus was taken. b-am-
yloid plaque load was imaged on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 fluorescent microscope with a 4X air-objective lens. ImageJ software was
used for quantification of image area containing tissue only, excluding image area not containing tissue. Statistical analysis was
based on separate mice.
Thioflavin S Aß plaque staining
60 mm sections were incubated in pre-heated 10 mM sodium citrate with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6 at 95�C for 1 hour, rinsed twice with
PBST and blocked with 10% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch 017-000-121) for 1 hour. Next, sections were incubated in
0.1% Thioflavin S (Sigma T1892) in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, washed twice with 70% ethanol, then twice with
distilled water. Images of cortical Thioflavin S staining were collected from thee slices for each animal and quantified using ImageJ.
Thee values for a single animal were averaged and graphed as a single data point per animal.
Mouse pharmacokinetic (PK) study
Brain penetration of 20 kDa PSCMA (Sigma, 434566) was characterized in six male C57BL/6 mice. Mice received drug at 40 mg/kg as
a solution in 95% PEG400/5% Solutol (dose volume = 5 mL/kg) by oral gavage. After 10 days of treatment, mice were euthanized by

 CO2 asphyxiation, perfused with ice-cold PBS for 60 s, and brains were rapidly dissected. Whole brains were Dounce homogenized
in 1:10 w:v brain:PBS, followed by polyanion extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026). 1 mL trizol per 100 mg tissue was
added, vortexed, 0.2 mL chloroform per ml TRIzol added, vortexed, centrifuged 15 min at 12,000 x g, aqueous phase transferred to a
new tube, 0.5 mL isopropanol added per ml TRIzol used for lysis, incubated 15 min, centrifuged at 12,000 x g, supernatant retrieved
leaving RNA pellet, supernatant speed vacuumed overnight, resuspended in H2O and purified using Oasis� WAX cartridges (Waters,
186002489). Eluted extracted PSCMA was assayed for Aßo/PrPC inhibitory activity by PrP-ELISA or PLISA (Kostylev et al., 2015) us-
ing similarly Dounce homogenized brain, spiked with varying concentrations of PSCMA followed by extraction, to establish a stan-
dard curve.
Toxicological Assessment of PSCMA
For the survival study, WT mice were orally gavaged with 120 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 2.4 mg/kg, or vehicle twice daily for 10 days. For the
tissue sampling study, groups of 12-month-old WT mice balanced for sex and weight were orally gavaged with 15 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or
vehicle twice daily for 1 week. All group received the same volume of vehicle per gram of body weight. After treatment, animals were
sacrificed and whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture using a 21 gauge needle, and aliquoted into a plasma separator tube
(BD Microtainer 365985) and a K2 EDTA tube (BD Microtainer 365974). Plasma separator tubes were centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 90 s.
Following blood collection, heart, liver, spleen, and left kidney were removed and weighed. Blood samples were sent to ANTECH
Diagnostics for complete blood counts and chemistry panels.
Analysis of Dendritic Spine Density (PSS)
For Aßo-induced spine loss, Aßo (1 mM monomer, 10 nM oligomer), vehicle (veh), Aßo + PSS, or PSS alone were applied at the desig-
nated dose to GFP transfected neurons at DIV 17, replacing 50% culture medium with fresh Aßo + veh, Aßo + PSS, or Veh-containing
conditioned culture medium every 24 hours for 4 days thereafter. Neurons were fixed and imaged with a 40X objective oil lens on
a Nikon Eclipse Ti Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope driven by Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Images were obtained as a
1 mm Z stack with 0.5 mm spacing using a 488 laser. All imaging and analyses were completed by an observer unaware of genotype
or treatment group. Analysis and quantification of data were performed with Volocity software after max intensity projection. The
number of dendritic spines were counted manually to estimate the density of primary or secondary dendritic branch by observer
unaware of treatment. For each condition, at least 3 dendrites were measured from each neuron and 5-7 neurons were imaged
per coverslip.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All results are presented as mean ± SEM. Microsoft Excel, Prism 6 software and IBM SPSS Statistics were used for statistical anal-
ysis. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, or repeated-measures one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple
comparisons test, as specified in the Figure legends. Only two-sided tests were used, and all data analyzed met the assumption for
the specific statistical test that was performed. Probability levels of p % 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
