Background: Although previous single-center studies report the rate of anaphylaxis for oral food challenges
(OFCs) as 9% to 11%, little is known regarding the epidemiology of clinical OFCs across multiple centers in the
United States.
Objective: To examine the epidemiology, symptoms, and treatment of clinical low-risk OFCs in the non-
research setting.
Methods: Data were obtained from 2008 to 2013 through a physician survey in 5 food allergy centers
geographically distributed across the United States. Allergic reaction rates and the association of reaction
rates with year, hospital, and demographics were determined using a linear mixed model. Meta-analysis was
used to pool the proportion of reactions and anaphylaxis with inverse-variance weights using a random-
effects model with exact confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: A total of 6,377 OFCs were performed, and the pooled estimate of anaphylaxis was 2% (95% CI,
1%-3%). The rate of allergic reactions was 14% (95% CI, 13%-16%) and was consistent during the study period
(P ¼ .40). Reaction rates ranged from 13% to 33%. Males reacted 16% more frequently than females (95% CI,
4%-37.5%; P ¼ .04). Foods challenged in 2013 varied geographically, with peanut as the most challenged food
in the Northeast, Midwest, and West and egg as the most challenged in the South.
Conclusion: As the largest national survey of allergic reactions of clinical open OFCs in a nonresearch setting
in the United States, this study found that performing clinical nonresearch open low-risk OFCs results in few
allergic reactions, with 86% of challenges resulting in no reactions and 98% without anaphylaxis.

Introduction
The
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
food
challenge
OFC
(DBPCFC) is currently recognized as the gold standard test for the
presence or absence of food allergy.1 The recommended evaluation
of patients with food allergies includes detailed clinical history,
serum specific IgE measurement, skin testing, and open oral food
challenges (OFCs) for relevant food allergens. In adults, milk,
shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts have been reported as top
allergens, whereas in children, these are allergens are cow’s milk,
nuts, and egg.2 In clinical practice, DBPCFCs are time consuming
and require more personnel compared with open OFCs. Therefore,
the risk of reaction of OFCs predominantly performed in research-
based clinical protocols has been assessed. However, there is a need
to determine the safety of open OFCs because food allergies
affect up to 6 million people,3 and the health care cost for food
allergies is $24 billion annually attributable to annual medical and
out-of-pocket cost, lost labor productivity, and forgone caregiver
labor market activities.4
It is paramount that physicians correctly identify true food
allergies given the significant impairment in quality of life5 and
potential for nutritional deficiencies.6 In addition, current studies
have found that future food allergy therapies (oral immunotherapy,

 sublingual immunotherapy, and epicutaneous immunotherapy) are
on the horizon.7e12 If these therapies become standard of care,
potentially eligible patients may need confirmation of food allergy
through OFCs before starting treatment.
Despite the numerous studies and the great economic burden of
food allergies, little is known regarding the epidemiology of OFCs in
the clinical nonresearch setting. Specifically, little is documented
about the rate of anaphylaxis and the interventions used in the
clinical nonresearch setting for open OFCs in the United States. The
current information about OFCs in the United States is based on
data collected in research settings along with some studies using
data from single centerereported retrospective medical record
reviews that consisted of 200 to 1,000 OFCs.13e18 In these studies,
reaction rates were noted to range from 18.8% to 47%, with the
following foods being more commonly challenged: peanut, tree
nut, and egg.13e18 In general, the reactions were noted to include
oral pruritus and cutaneous symptoms, with an anaphylaxis risk of
6% to 33% of OFCs.13,15e18 The objective of the study was to describe
the epidemiologic profile of clinical open OFCs by reviewing sample
data from tertiary clinics across the United States.
Methods
Medical record and literature review was performed in accor-
dance with local institutional review boards. This project obtained
data (from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2013) from 5 of
26 US food allergy centers: Texas Children’s Hospital Food Allergy
Program (South); University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medi-
cal Center (North Midwest); Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana
University Health (Midwest); University of Washington School of
Medicine, Northwest Asthma & Allergy Center (Northwest); and
Boston Children’s Hospital (Northeast). Each institution completed
a survey with questions assessing the following: (1) number of
OFCs performed; (2) number of OFCs with the outcome of
anaphylaxis, pruritus, vomiting, hives, facial or tongue swelling,
difficulty breathing, changes in blood pressure, or cough; (3) foods
challenged in 2013 (milk, baked milk, soy, wheat, peanut, shrimp/
shellfish, finned fish, egg, baked egg, tree nut, other); (4) use of an
OFC protocol (obtained from the American Academy of Allergy,
Asthma, and Immunology Adverse Reactions to Food Committee
Work Group Report,19 PRACTALL consensus report,20 or other
published guidelines); (5) the criteria for a positive reaction; (6) the
waiting period after the last dose of an OFC; (7) the use of the prick
and prick (the use fresh food items vs standardized extracts) testing
method used before OFC; (8) reaction characteristics; (9) the
number of challenges in which epinephrine, antihistamines, or
steroids was given; and (10) demographics of patients challenged
(age, ethnicity, sex, and prior history of food reactions and
anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis was defined according to the criteria
outlined by Sampson et al,21 with some discretion based on clinical
judgment of the supervising physician. When a patient developed
anaphylaxis based on the criteria of Sampson et al,21 epinephrine
was used for treatment. Although criteria for food challenge

 differed among centers, all centers challenged patients with and
without positive skin prick test results. No center only performed
challenges on patients with negative skin prick test results. The 95%
cutoff values, when available, were used for guidance. One center,
Boston Children’s Hospital, has reported a quality improvement
initiative with food challenges, encompassing some patients also
included in this report.22
The proportions over time overall and by hospital were deter-
mined for the variables listed above. The association among time,
hospital, and demographics with reaction rates and anaphylaxis
rates were evaluated using a linear mixed model with autore-
gressive correlation structure that accounted for within hospital
correlation. Meta-analysis was used to pool the proportion of re-
actions, anaphylaxis, epinephrine use, steroid use, and diphenhy-
dramine use by year and overall with inverse-variance weights
using a random-effects model with exact confidence intervals (CIs).
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were
performed using STATA, version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station,
Texas).
Results
A total of 6,377 open OFCs were performed, with 5,393 of those
challenges occurring in patients younger than 18 years. The pro-
tocols of the sites are listed in Table 1. The centers report that most
OFCs performed were low risk during this study because of one of
the following factors: lack of recent reaction, history of tolerance to
ingestion, or low levels of specific IgE unless cross-sensitization was
suspected. Riley Children’s Hospital (Midwest) performed a lower
proportion of OFCs in patients younger than 18 years old. Boston
Children’s Hospital (Northeast) had the largest sample size,
whereas Texas Children’s Hospital (South) had the smallest sample
size. The demographics of the challenged patients are listed in
Table 2.
Nonanaphylactic reaction rates ranged from 13% to 33%,
depending on year and hospital. There was heterogeneity within all
years except 2013 but not between years (P ¼ .40), so the overall
pooled estimate of the proportion of reactions was appropriate
(Fig 1). The pooled estimate of allergic reactions with open OFCs

interval (CI) for each site within a year, overall for each year, and overall for all years and sites. The meta-analysis weighs sites and years based on amount of data. The size of the
squares indicates the weight. Boston Children’s Hospital has the highest weight because it has the largest sample size. The I2 statistic is the percentage of total variation
attributable to interstudy heterogeneity.

 was 14% (95% CI, 13%-16%). The linear mixed-model results indicate
that Boston had reaction rate 8.3 percentage points lower than
Texas Children’s Hospital (95% CI, �10.5 to �6.2; P < .001). The
proportion of nonanaphylactic reactions varied significantly from
year to year (P ¼ .004). Nonanaphylactic reaction rates were 10.2
percentage points lower in 2010 compared with 2009 (95%
CI, �19.0 to �1.4; P ¼ .02), 8.0 points lower in 2011 compared with
2009 (95% CI, �12.8 to �3.3; P ¼ .001), 5.9 points lower in 2013
compared with 2009 (95% CI, �11.7 to �0.2; P ¼ .04), and 7.3 points
higher in 2012 compared with 2010 (95% CI, 1.9e12.7; P ¼ .008).
Males had a reaction rate that was 16 percentage points higher than
females (95% CI, 0.4e37.5; P ¼ .04).
Anaphylaxis rates ranged from 0% to 14%, depending on year and
hospital (Fig 2). There was heterogeneity within some years (P <
.001 for 2008 and P <.001 for 2013) but not between years (P ¼ .68),
so the overall pooled estimate of the proportion of anaphylaxis
with OFCs was consistent with each year. The pooled estimate of
anaphylaxis was 2% (95% CI,1%-3%). The linear mixed-model results
indicated that centers in the Northeast, Midwest, and North
Midwest all had higher proportions of anaphylaxis than the South
(P < .001), and centers in the Midwest and North Midwest had
higher anaphylaxis rates than the Northeast. The proportion of
OFCs that resulted in anaphylaxis did not change over time
(P ¼ .45). Just as was seen in nonanaphylactic reaction rates, pa-
tients with anaphylaxis were more likely to be males (P ¼ .008) and
white (P ¼ .007) compared with patients who did not have
anaphylaxis.
Meta-analysis was used to estimate the proportion of treatment
(antihistamine, epinephrine, steroids) and 95% CI by year for all
OFCs performed (Fig 3A-C). Of the 6,377 OFCs, treatment data were

 obtained for 3,127 OFCs. There were 451 of 3,127 challenges that
required treatment (14.4%). Antihistamines were used most often
when reactions occurred with OFC 76% of the time, whereas
epinephrine was used 14% of the time. Steroids were only used 11%
of the time. The overall percentage of OFCs that received antihis-
tamines was 10%, and the overall percentages receiving epineph-
rine and steroids were each 1%.
Figure 4 shows the proportion of hospital admissions that
resulted from open OFCs from 2008 to 2013. Nineteen OFCs resul-
ted in patients being placed in hospital observation, and 63 were
treated with epinephrine. Hospital admission included all patients
who were transferred from the outpatient clinic to an adjacent
hospital. Although the exact reason for the admission and the
associated challenge food was not determined through the ques-
tionnaire, all patients were discharged from the hospital in less
than 1 day from admission. The contribution of delayed adminis-
tration of epinephrine to hospital admission could not be excluded,
although all challenges were accompanied by a supervising
physician.
The specific foods used for OFCs in 2013 year are shown in
Figure 5. There was some variability, but peanuts were universally
challenged most across all sites. Texas Children’s Hospital (South)
challenged egg, baked milk, and peanut at a higher rate. Boston
Children’s Hospital (Northeast) challenged peanut and egg most
often. Riley Hospital for Children (Midwest) challenged peanut and
egg, and Pittsburgh (North Midwest) challenged peanut, tree nut,

 and milk most often. The most often challenged foods at the
Northwest Asthma & Allergy Center (Northwest) were peanut and
milk. Texas Children’s Hospital (South) challenged more baked milk
than the other sites (P < .001). The foods from all centers in the
other category included oat, chicken, chickpea, kiwi, carrot, lentil,
pea, sunflower, sesame seed, rice, banana, turkey, corn, potato,
pineapple, strawberry, barley, and kidney bean.
Overall ethnicity over time is shown in Figure 6. For all sites
combined, the diversity in the patients with OFCs decreased during
the study period, with the proportion of white patients obtaining
OFC increasing and the proportion of the other ethnic groups
decreasing over time (P < .001). Texas Children’s Hospital (South)
has a higher proportion of challenged patients identified as His-
panic and African American compared with the other sites,
whereas Northwest Asthma & Allergy Center (Northwest) had a
much higher proportion of patients categorized as belonging to
another ethnic group compared with other centers.
Discussion
The prevalence of food allergies has been increasing in the
United States.23 However, not many studies have determined
whether this increase is accompanied by increased OFC-proven
reaction rates. This study provides data from the largest number
of OFCs in 5 geographically distributed locations in the United
States. The numbers of overall OFCs performed during a specific
period and foods challenged, along with the associated outcomes
and interventions, were examined. The severity of OFC reactions in
this setting is low, with 2% of OFCs resulting in anaphylaxis and 14%
in mild to moderate allergic reactions, requiring no epinephrine.
Food challenges increase the quality of life of food allergic pa-
tients,24 even if they test positive.25 There is great cost to delaying
the performance of OFCs, up to $4,184 per 12 months of delay.26
Therefore, this procedure should be performed by allergists for
appropriate patients with a prior accurate risk assessment per
Figure 3. (continued).

344
 patient. However, allergists may choose not to perform OFCs in
their offices because of perception of risk, time burden, reim-
bursement concern, and personnel constraints. Therefore, accurate
determination of the true risk of OFCs in nonresearch settings is
helpful for everyday decision making in clinical practices across the
nation. This comprehensive study of a large number of OFCs
distributed across the nation estimates the OFC anaphylaxis risk
lower than prior studies, which have reported the risk ranging from
6% to 33%.13e18,27,28 Because OFCs are already considered a safe
procedure in allergists’ offices, this treatment should be routinely
used to maximize quality of life for patients and minimize the
economic burden of disease.
Sites participating in the study used different site-specific pa-
rameters for their OFCs, including the Practical Allergy (PRACTALL)
guidelines,20 the Adverse Reactions to Food Committee Work
Group Report,19 or practitioner-specific guidelines. The stopping
criteria for OFCs in the Work Group Report are descriptive and do
not contain specific scoring criteria. The PRACTALL guidelines
contain specific scoring criteria with mild, moderate, and severe
symptoms of specific target organs scored from 0 to 3. These dif-
ferences along with the ambiguity in practitioner-specific protocols
could account for some of the differences in reaction rates among
sites. Most sites incorporated one of the aforementioned guidelines
with the exception of Texas Children’s Hospital (South) and
Figure 3. (continued).

345
 Northwest Allergy and Asthma Center (Northwest). In each of these
sites, the OFC recommendations were used in a combination from 2
of the following protocols: the PRACTALL, the Work Group Report,
and/or practitioner-specific parameters. Different dosing regimens
may contribute to heterogeneity among sites, but this was not
assessed by the survey instrument. Future assessment of the true
risk of reaction to OFCs will benefit from a wider acceptance of
standardized protocols.
Three of 5 practices in this study performed prick and prick
testing to selected foods, mainly fruits and vegetables, before OFC.
It is unknown whether this method of testing more accurately
predicts OFC outcome compared with skin prick testing with ex-
tracts or serum specific IgE. Most practices performed this testing
within 6 months of the OFC. In centers that performed prick and
prick testing, if results differed from stock extract skin test results
performed previously, this may have changed the practitioner’s
decision to perform the challenge (G.V. and D.R.N., personal
communication, 2017). Prick and prick testing of food before OFC
has been recommended in the most recent practice parameters as a
valid way to determine food allergy for fresh fruits and vegetables
or in other foods if extracts are not available.29
The pooled data indicate an overall estimated rate of non-
anaphylactic reactions of 14% during the study period. Reactions
noted in the study population included hives, abdominal pain,
shortness of breath, and emesis. These reactions were mild to
moderate and most of the time treated with diphenhydramine.
Because the rate of these mild reactions that resulted in use of
diphenhydramine is approximately 10%, it is reasonable to consider
the OFC as a relatively safe procedure. Even though shortness of
breath was encountered as a symptom of mild reaction, this is a
symptom that, in the absence of wheezing, cough, or stridor, could
be subjective and is not considered a severe symptom by the
PRACTALL guidelines.20 Although shortness of breath would
indicate respiratory difficulty (a criterion for the definition of
anaphylaxis),21 this was not classified as severe in some cases. This
highlights some of the ambiguity of determining the severity of OFC
reactions.
The pooled meta-analysis of the data provided by the 4 sites
(partial data were collected from one site and in turn were not
included in meta-analysis) indicates a 2% rate of anaphylaxis during
the 2008e2013 study period, with a 95% CI of 1% to 3% for OFCs
performed in the clinical nonresearch setting. This finding is similar
to reported rates in countries outside the United States.30 The
perceived safety concern for performing OFCs in the nonresearch
clinical setting at first glance is supported by the pooled rate of
anaphylaxis occurring during nonresearch clinical OFCs performed
in our population being higher than the reported rate of anaphy-
laxis seen in immunotherapy systemic reactions performed in US
allergy clinics.31 However, when one considers that the rate of

 anaphylaxis for a single OFC may be higher than a single allergy
shot provided during immunotherapy, the rate of anaphylaxis
across a full course of immunotherapy (up to 100 visits) is com-
parable to that of a food challenge. Therefore, because allergists are
skilled at treating anaphylaxis, they should feel comfortable per-
forming OFCs. Because allergists perform drug challenges and
aeroallergen immunotherapy routinely, we believe the allergist’s
office is best equipped with the expertise and staff to perform
clinical OFCs. Although up to 85% of allergists report they perform
OFCs, only 5.6% of allergists perform more than 10 OFCs per month
and 70% perform only 1 to 5 OFCs per month, with risk of an
adverse event cited as 1 of the top 3 barriers.32 Allergists should
perform this practice on a regular basis to ensure patients do not
needlessly avoid foods for fear of allergic reactions and thus sub-
sequently live with the anxiety related to avoidance. Furthermore,
the risk of anaphylaxis should be evaluated with prospective
epidemiologic studies.
Although late-phase and biphasic reactions were not assessed
with this survey, prior studies have found that the rate of these
reactions during OFC ranges from 1.5% to 4%.13,33,34 A subset of
patients
who
experience
anaphylaxis
and
are
treated
with
epinephrine during OFC have biphasic reactions. Features associ-
ated with biphasic reactions include multiple organ involvement,
more severe reactions, and multiple doses of epinephrine. The rate
of anaphylaxis of 2% from this survey and the 1% (n ¼ 63/6377) of
patients requiring epinephrine after OFC suggests biphasic re-
sponses would not have occurred in this study more often than
what has been previously reported.

the 2013 year found that for most sites milk, peanut, or egg were

known
epidemiology of milk, peanut, and egg as the most common food
allergens.2 Many of the sites were noted to have a number of open
OFCs to baked foods (milk or egg). In particular, Texas Children’s
Hospital (South) had a higher rate of baked milk challenges,
whereas Boston Children’s Hospital (Northeast) had a higher rate
of baked egg challenges. This observation is explained by the
trend to attempt to increase the dietary options for people with
known milk and egg allergies by testing for ability to tolerate
baked products. The introduction of baked milk and egg products
may have some benefit for hastening tolerance development to
milk and egg in children with allergic disease35,36 and should be
considered as an intervention in cases where tolerance to baked
goods is unknown.
The predominance of male patients with more reactions is
consistent with the observation of more frequent food allergic
disease in males.37 During this time, most patients undergoing
OFCs at all sites participating were white. Even though the abso-
lute number of black and Hispanic patients who underwent OFCs
increased during the survey period, the proportion of whites
undergoing OFCs increased compared with the other ethnic
groups. This finding suggests a decrease in diversity in patients
challenged from 2008 to 2013. This was noted most prominently
at the Texas Children’s Hospital (South) site location, where the
regional population almost doubled during the 6-year period.
Given the observation that minority populations more often have
symptoms when surveyed by telephone or National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys,2,38 it is especially important for
allergists treating minority patients to offer OFC procedures to
these patients. Patients may be more at risk of developing allergic
reactions from unintentional exposures if the diagnosis of food
allergy is unclear.
The limitations of this study included the inability to collect
more robust data (including specific IgE values) because of elec-
tronic medical record upgrades at some sites, to determine
biphasic responses in a systematic fashion, and to determine the
complete epidemiologic picture of food allergies based on only a
few centers, although these centers represent a snapshot of
different regions of the country. There may also be limitations on
the generalization of results to private practice settings because
all sites were tertiary academic institutions with resource-rich
environments. Another potential limitation is the lack of differ-
entiation between IgE-mediated OFCs vs noneIgE-mediated OFCs.
Therefore, resulting reactions may be misclassified, and the rate of
anaphylaxis
underestimated
or
overestimated.
However,
the
number of challenges performed for other than IgE-mediated re-
actions is likely to be small and, therefore, unlikely to substan-
tially alter the results. Finally, uniform criteria for recommending
OFC varied among locations, making comparisons imperfect and
limiting generalizability.
This is the largest assessment of allergic reactions to clinical
OFCs in the United States to date. Studies from outside the United
States have used OFCs in the context of evaluating disease pro-
gression for specific food allergens (ie, peanut)39 or to diagnose
food allergy for research protocols.40 In the United States, previous
studies have been single-center studies with determination of re-
action rates of OFCs in an office setting located in one geographic
area14,15 or single-center studies determining reaction rates of OFCs
in the context of clinical research protocols.13 This study is the first
study, to our knowledge, to evaluate OFC reactions in 5 widely
geographically distributed centers, which clarifies the risk of per-
forming clinical nonresearch open OFCs. OFCs are a safe procedure
and should be performed by practicing allergists when indicated.
Allergists are the most capable physicians to evaluate and manage
this risk.
