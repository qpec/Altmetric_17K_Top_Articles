ypertension is one of the most prevalent and prevent-
able risk factors for cardiovascular and kidney diseases 
and is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.1 
Approximately 78 million US adults are currently hyperten-
sive.2,3 Nationally representative survey data show a prevalence 
of hypertension of 30.8%, which has plateaued since 1999.4 
Decreasing the prevalence of hypertension has been iden-
tified as a key public health priority by the American Heart 
Association, which has been proposed as a target decreasing 
hypertension prevalence to 26.9% by 2020.4,5 Similarly, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set hyperten-
sion prevention as its top priority action to prevent a million 
heart attacks and strokes by the year 2017.6 To reduce hyper-
tension and its related public health burden,4,7 it is important 
to identify modifiable risk factors for the early prevention of 
hypertension, particularly among high-risk populations.
Approximately 7% (ranging from 1% to 14%) of all preg-
nancies in the United States are complicated by gestational 
Abstract—Women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus represent a high-risk population for hypertension later in life. 
The role of diet in the progression of hypertension among this susceptible population is unknown. 
We conducted a prospective 
cohort study of 3818 women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus in the Nurses’ Health Study II as part of the 
ongoing Diabetes & Women’s Health Study. These women were followed-up from 1989 to 2011. Incident hypertension was 
identified through self-administered questionnaires that were validated previously by medical record review. Adherence 
scores for the alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010, the alternative Mediterranean diet, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension were computed for each participant. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations 
between dietary scores and hypertension while adjusting for major risk factors for hypertension. We documented 1069 
incident hypertension cases during a median of 18.5 years of follow-up. After adjustment for major risk factors for 
hypertension, including body mass index, alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010, alternative Mediterranean diet, and Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension scores were significantly inversely associated with the risk of hypertension; hazard ratio 
and 95% confidence interval comparing the extreme quartiles (highest versus lowest) were 0.76 (0.61–0.94; P for linear 
trend =0.03) for AHEI score, 0.72 (0.58–0.90; P for trend =0.01) for Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension score, and 
0.70 (0.56–0.88; P for trend =0.002) for alternative Mediterranean diet score. Adherence to a healthful dietary pattern was 
related to a lower subsequent risk of developing hypertension among women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.

diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is associated with an elevated 
risk for hypertension.8 We have previously reported that the 
cumulative incidence of hypertension for women with a his-
tory of GDM was 26% higher than those who did not have 
GDM even 16 years after the index pregnancy.8 Thus, women 
with a history of GDM represent a high-risk population 
for hypertension that could benefit from early prevention. 
Although there is extensive literature on how lifestyle factors 
may influence blood pressure in the general population,4,9–11 
no information is currently available on the role of diet and 
lifestyle in the development of hypertension specifically in 
this susceptible population. Only one small randomized clini-
cal trial has investigated the effects of Dietary Approach to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in pregnancy women with 
GDM but did not have hypertension as end point.12,13 It is 
currently unknown whether and to what extent following a 
DASH diet after GDM affect subsequent hypertension risk. 
The DASH and Mediterranean diet were inversely associated 
with blood pressure in the general population,14,15 but whether 
these healthy dietary patterns could be helpful in a high-
risk population, such as women with a history of GDM, is 
unknown. To address these gaps, we prospectively examined 
the associations between long-term adherence to 3 healthy 
diets with subsequent risk of hypertension among women 
with a history of GDM, specifically the DASH diet, the 
alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED), and the Alternative 
Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). We also assessed whether the 
associations were potentially mediated through changes in 
body mass index (BMI).
Methods
Study Population
The study population is composed of women with a history of 
GDM in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) as part of the ongo-
ing Diabetes & Women’s Health Study.16 The NHSII is an ongoing 
prospective cohort study established in 1989. It consists of 116 430 
female nurses, aged 24 to 44 years at baseline. Study participants 
report their lifestyle information and medical history through a self-
administered questionnaire every 2 years. Dietary information is 
collected every 4 years using a validated semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire.17
GDM diagnosed by a physician was ascertained by self-report on 
each biennial questionnaire through 2001. Investigators ceased the 
update of occurrence of GDM in 2001 because most women had 
passed reproductive age. In a previous validation study consisted 
of a subgroup of the NHSII cohort, ≈94% of self-reported GDM 
events were confirmed by medical records.18 Physicians were most 
likely to use the National Diabetes Data Group criteria, and among 
both cases and noncases in the NHS cohort, there was a high level 
of GDM surveillance. From a supplemental questionnaire sent to a 
random sample of parous women who did not report GDM (n=114), 
83% of them reported undergoing a 50 g glucose screening test dur-
ing pregnancy and 100% reported frequent prenatal urine glucose 
screening.
Among the 94 166 women who reported a pregnancy, we excluded 
women with a history of cardiovascular diseases or cancer at base-
line (n=895), those with multiple gestations or pregnancies lasting <6 
months (n=2274), and those without a history of GDM (n=89 532). 
We also excluded women with a history of hypertension before 
the diagnosis of GDM or with missing data on postpregnancy diet 
(n=1465), leaving 3818 women in the study.
We censored participants during follow-up if they reported a physi-
cian diagnosis of hypertension, died, or were lost to follow-up. Our 
final analytic sample included 3818 women with a mean age at GDM 
of 32 years; 2017 women had GDM identified through the baseline 
questionnaire and 1801 women had GDM identified during the fol-
low-up. This study was approved by the institutional review board 
of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Partners 
Healthcare system. All study participants have provided informed 
consent.
Exposure
A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 
every 4 years to assess the participants’ usual diet over the past 
year.17,19 Previous validation studies have shown good correlations 
between food frequency questionnaire and multiple food records 
and biomarkers of intake.17,19 For each participant, we calculated an 
adherence score to 3 dietary patterns as previously described10,20,21: 
the AHEI, DASH, and the aMED. AHEI 2010, based on a compre-
hensive literature review of foods, nutrients, and components that 
are consistently associated with a lower risk of chronic disease (car-
diovascular disease and cancer) in the general population, empha-
sizes high consumption of nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish, and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower intake of sugar-sweetened 
beverages.10 The DASH diet was originally developed for blood 
pressure reduction and emphasizes a low consumption of sodium, 
animal protein, and sweets and encourages high intakes of fruits, 
vegetables, legumes and nuts, and moderate low-fat dairy prod-
ucts.22 The alternative Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegeta-
bles, fish, and whole grains, moderate in dairy products and alcohol, 
high in fat (mainly from monounsaturated fat), olive oil, and low in 
meat and meat products.11,23
We modeled different dietary patterns using cumulative average 
level of dietary variables and stopped updating after participants 
developed intermediate outcomes that could change dietary habits, 
such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, 
angina, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Dietary scores were 
divided into quartiles, with highest quartiles representing the most 
healthful diet.
Outcome
The outcome was newly diagnosed hypertension as reported in fol-
low-up questionnaires among women with a history of GDM. Every 
2 years, study participants returned self-administered questionnaires 
indicating whether they had clinically diagnosed hypertension.24 In a 
validation study among a random sample of NHS II participants, self-
reported hypertension had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 85% 
when compared against medical records.24
Covariates
We adjusted for major sociodemographic information, family his-
tory of hypertension, lifestyle, and clinical covariates which were 
collected and updated with biennial questionnaires since 1989. Self-
reported weight was highly correlated with measured weight (r=0.97) 
in a previous validation study.25 Physical activity and sedentary 
behaviors were repeatedly assessed in 1989, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2005, 
and 2009. Participants were asked to report the average amount of 
time spent per week doing various activities. Weekly energy expendi-
ture in metabolic equivalent (MET) hours was calculated. In a previ-
ous validation study,26 the correlation of physical activity reported on 
questionnaires was 0.79 when compared with prospectively collected 
1-week recalls and 0.62 when compared with prospectively collected 
physical activity diaries. BMI at age 18 was collected in the 1989 
questionnaires, which has been validated in a previous study with 
relatively good validity.8,27–29 Hypertensive disorder in pregnancy was 
defined as self-reported pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclamp-
sia, or toxemia.
Statistical Analysis
Participants were followed from the date of the first questionnaire 
when GDM was reported to the date of the questionnaire first report-
ing hypertension diagnosed by a physician, death, or end of follow-up

up (≤22.9, 23.0–24.9, 25.0–26.9, 27.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, 35+ kg/m2).
To evaluate the robustness of the findings, we conducted a series 
of sensitivity analyses, including restricting the analysis to women 
with a GDM identified at baseline questionnaire cycle (prevalent 
GDM, n=2017), women with GDM identified during the follow-up 
from 1991 until 2001 only (incident GDM, n=1801), and among 
white women only. We performed stratified analyses by family his-
tory of hypertension (yes, no), baseline obesity status (BMI ≥30 kg/
m2, yes, no), physical activity level (Q3 and 4 versus Q1 and 2), and 
history of GDM (yes, no). We also additionally adjusted for duration 
of lactation.
We plotted the cumulative incidence of hypertension among 
women by extreme quartiles of dietary quality. Using mediation 
analysis method (difference approach),30 we calculated the propor-
tions of the associations between healthful dietary patterns with 
risk of hypertension mediated through BMI change after GDM. 
BMI change was calculated as the difference between BMI at base-
line and at the end of follow-up. Because BMI change was a sig-
nificant mediator for the association with AHEI score, we further 
plotted the predicted probabilities of hypertension among women 
with a history of GDM for the joint effects of AHEI scores with 
baseline BMI and the joints effects of diet scores with changes in 
BMI. We calculated predicted probabilities assuming median val-
ues for covariates.
Results
We documented a total of 1069 incident hypertension cases 
during 27 251 person-years of follow-up among women with a 
history of GDM. Women with greater adherence to the AHEI, 
DASH, or aMED diet patterns were less likely to be current 
smokers (Table 1). They were more likely to be moderate 
alcohol drinkers, eat more cereal fiber, be more physically 
active, and less likely to consume trans fat (Table 1). BMI 
at age 18 was similar across quartiles of AHEI, DASH, and 
aMED scores. The median duration of time to the develop-
ment of hypertension since the index GDM pregnancy was 
17 years.
Figure 1 shows that the cumulative incidence of hyperten-
sion among women with AHEI, DASH, and aMED scores in 
the highest quartile was higher than those in the lowest quar-
tile after 18 years of follow up. Moreover, all the 3 dietary 
pattern scores were strongly inversely associated with hyper-
tension risk. For AHEI score, we observed a consistent strong 
inverse association with risk of hypertension. Comparing 
extreme quartiles, women who consumed a high-quality diet 
after GDM were 35% less likely to develop hypertension 
(hazard ratio =0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53–0.81, 
P for trend =0.0002; Table 2). After further adjustment for 
BMI, the association did not change appreciably (hazard 
ratio =0.76, 95% CI: 0.61–0.94, P for trend =0.03; Table 2). 
We observed similar results for DASH and aMED scores. 
The results were also similar when we used simple updated 
dietary scores (Table S1 in the online-only Data Supplement), 
stopped updating diet after development of intermediate out-
comes, restricted the analysis to white women only, further 
adjusting for duration of lactation, or restricted the analysis to

prevalent or incident GDM cases only (data not shown). We 
did not identify significant effect modification by family his-
tory of hypertension, baseline obesity status, physical activity, 
or history of GDM (Table S2).
Mediation analysis using the difference method indicated 
that weight gain after GDM was a significant mediator for the 
association between AHEI and risk of hypertension. For the 
AHEI score, 43.9% (95% CI 12.3%–75.6%, P=0.006) was 
mediated through BMI change. For the DASH diet score, 13.8% 
(95% CI −18.9% to 46.6%, P=0.4) of the association was medi-
ated through BMI change. For the aMED score, −10.9% (95% 
CI −55.4% to 33.6%, P=0.6) was mediated through BMI 
change. We plotted the predicted incidence rate of hypertension 
by the joint effects of diet scores and baseline BMI and the joint 
effects of diet scores and changes in BMI (Figure 2). The prob-
abilities were in general higher for women who gained weight 
or who were obese throughout the study period compared with 
those who lost weight during the follow-up.
Discussion
In this large long-term prospective cohort of US women with a 
history of GDM, we observed an inverse association between 
adherence to healthful dietary patterns, AHEI, DASH, or 
Mediterranean diet, and risk of hypertension later in life. 
Comparing extreme categories, women consuming a higher 
quality diet after GDM had on average a 20% lower risk of 
subsequent hypertension. Increase in BMI explained around 
20% to 30% of the association between healthful dietary pat-
terns and hypertension.
Although GDM is a pregnancy complication, it has been 
demonstrated that the majority of women with GDM may 
have reduced insulin secretion and chronic insulin resistance 
before pregnancy, and the glucose intolerance may deterio-
rate through their life course.31 Studies on the associations 
between dietary and lifestyle factors and the risk of hyperten-
sion among women with GDM are sparse. One small random-
ized clinical trial of 34 women studied intermediate outcomes 
and reported that among pregnant women with GDM, the 
DASH diet improved glucose tolerance and lipid profiles.12,13 
However, risk of hypertension as the end point was not inves-
tigated in this study. The role of dietary factors in long-term 
prevention of hypertension after the index pregnancy remains 
to be elucidated. Findings from the present study among the 
high-risk population are, in general, in line with studies from

the general population where beneficial associations of AHEI, 
DASH, and aMED with the risk of hypertension have been 
observed.15,22,32–35
Compared with the general population, women with GDM 
are more likely to have a sedentary lifestyle, to be obese, and 
to develop diabetes mellitus.7,8 Nonetheless, we observed 
similar effect sizes of the 3 dietary scores in association with 
hypertension among women with GDM, compared with the 
general population. Adjustment for BMI moderately attenu-
ated these findings. Mediation results suggested that moderate 
effects of diet, particularly AHEI diet score, on hypertension 
risk reduction were mediated through changes in BMI.
Prevention of hypertension involves reduction in sodium 
intake, a healthful dietary pattern, and maintaining a healthy 
body weight.36 AHEI, DASH, and aMED dietary patterns are 
rich in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, with high intake of magne-
sium and potassium and low intake of sodium. The DASH diet 
has been shown to lower risk of hypertension consistently and 
was recommended for prevention and treatment of high blood 
pressure.9,20,37,38 The high fiber content from whole grains 
and legumes, a characteristic from the 3 dietary patterns, 
could reduce glucose absorption, improve insulin sensitiv-
ity, improve endothelial function, and have anti-inflammatory 
and antioxidant effects.39,40 Fruits and vegetables contain high 
potassium and vitamin K, ascorbic acid, and antioxidants, 
which could reduce vascular oxidative stress, endothelial 
impairment, atrial stiffness, and lower blood pressure.41–43 
High intake of magnesium and potassium may inhibit 
sodium reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, suppress 
renin secretion, relax smooth muscle, suppress formation of 
free radicals, and protect against vascular injury.36,44–46 Low 
fat dairy in the DASH diet also could potentially stimulate 
secretion of insulinotropic peptides and reduce saturated fat 
intake.47 Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in 
the AHEI increases the production of vasodilators and modi-
fies membrane phospholipid composition,48,49 lowering blood 
pressure. Furthermore, the evaluation of dietary patterns 
focuses on food groups instead of individual components 
and takes into account the interactions or synergistic effects 
between these components.
A limitation of our study was that our participants were 
mainly white educated women. Future studies are needed 
to examine this association in other race/ethnic groups, as 
previous studies have suggested that Hispanic and black 
women have an increased risk of hypertension compared 
with white women.4,50 However, the homogeneous race/ethnic

represents baseline BMI or changes in BMI. For changes in BMI, positive number represents increase in BMI, whereas negative number 
represents decrease in BMI. Z axis represents AHEI score, which ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating worst diet quality and 100 
indicating best healthiest diet.

background and socioeconomic status in our cohort is also 
a strength because it reduces the possibility of residual con-
founding. In addition, the biological mechanisms underlying 
the healthy dietary pattern and hypertension among GDM 
women are likely to be the same across different race/ethnic 
groups.51–54 Further, in our study, hypertension cases were 
identified by self-report of a clinician diagnosis in the past 
2 years. However, previous validation study based on medi-
cal records review among a subset of random sample of NHS 
II participants demonstrated a high validity for self-reported 
hypertension cases.24
Our study is one of the first studies examining the asso-
ciation of different healthful dietary patterns with the risk 
of hypertension among a high-risk population, women 
who develop GDM in a prior pregnancy. Strengths of our 
study include a large sample size, long-term follow-up, and 
repeated measurement of dietary and lifestyle informa-
tion. We also have detailed information on weight, physical 
activity, birth weight, BMI at age 18, and updated BMI, 
which allows detailed adjustment for cardiovascular risk 
factors across the adult lifespan, including both prepreg-
nancy and postpregnancy. We also have detailed covariates 
adjustment and similar sociodemographic characteristics 
in this study sample, which further reduce residual con-
founding. Our results were robust to a series of sensitivity 
analyses.
Perspectives
After having GDM in pregnancy, women who adhered to 
a healthy dietary pattern experienced substantially lower 
risk of hypertension. The associations were moderately 
mediated through changes in body mass index, suggest-
ing that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key factor 
in preventing hypertension among these high-risk women. 
Findings from the present study indicate that women with 
a history of GDM may benefit from adhering to a healthy 
dietary pattern characterized by rich intake in fruits and 
vegetables and whole grains and low in red and processed 
meats and refined grain.

What Is New?
• Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the most common pregnancy 
complications, has short-term and long-term health implications for both 
women and their offspring. Women with a history of GDM represent a 
high-risk population for hypertension that could benefit from early pre-
vention.
• Although healthful diet and lifestyle factors may help lower the risk of 
hypertension in the general population, it is unknown among this sus-
ceptible high-risk population whether and how healthful dietary patterns 
are related to the risk of hypertension. Such information is particularly 
critical in future development of effective and targeted prevention strat-
egy of hypertension among this high-risk population.
• This study is one of the first studies examining the association of dif-
ferent healthful dietary patterns with the risk of hypertension among a 
high-risk population, women who had a history of GDM.
• In this prospective study of US women from the Nurses’ Health Study II, 
we aimed to investigate the association after 18.5 years of follow-up of 
women who had diabetes mellitus during pregnancy.
• We observed that after GDM, adherence to a healthy dietary pattern was 
associated with lower risk of developing hypertension. The associations 
were moderately mediated through changes in body mass index, sug-
gesting that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key factor in prevent-
ing hypertension among these high-risk women.
What Is Relevant?
• Findings from the present study indicate that women with a history of 
GDM may benefit from adhering to a healthy dietary pattern character-
ized by rich intake in fruits and vegetables and whole grains and low in 
red and processed meats and low in refined grain.
Summary
Adherence to a healthful dietary pattern was related to a lower 
subsequent risk of developing hypertension among women with 
a history of GDM.
