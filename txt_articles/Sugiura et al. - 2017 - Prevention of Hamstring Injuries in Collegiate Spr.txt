Investigation performed at Juntendo University, Chiba, Japan
Background: No studies have been reported on how strength, agility, and flexibility training reduce the occurrence of hamstring
injuries in sprinters. Therefore, a program for preventing hamstring injury in these athletes has not been established.
Purpose: To document the incidence of hamstring injuries during times when different prevention strategies were employed to see
whether a particular prevention program reduced their occurrence.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Methods: The study subjects were a total of 613 collegiate male sprinters trained by the same coach over 24 seasons. Tow training
was used throughout the research period as a normal sprint training method. The hamstring injury prevention program evolved over
time. From 1988 to 1991 (period 1), prevention focused on strength training alone; from 1992 to 1999 (period 2), a combination of
strength and agility training was used; and from 2000 to 2011 (period 3), the program incorporated strength, agility, and flexibility
training. The incidence of hamstring injuries was compared for each of the 3 prevention strategies.
Results: The incidence of hamstring injuries per athlete-seasons was 137.9 for period 1, 60.6 for period 2, and 6.7 for period 3.
A significant difference was observed in the incidence of hamstring injury according to the different prevention programs
(w2(2) ¼ 31.78, P < .001, effect size: Cramer V ¼ 0.23, 1 � b ¼ 0.999). Residual analysis showed that the number of hamstring
injuries for period 1 was significantly greater than the expected value (P < .01), whereas that for period 3 was significantly lower than
the expected value (P < .01).
Conclusion: The incidence of hamstring injuries in sprinters decreased as agility and flexibility were added to strength training.

The incidence of hamstring injury has remained about the
same in recent years.38 Hamstring injuries are particularly
prevalent in football, soccer, and sprinting.38 In a study
investigating the epidemiology of hamstring injuries
among student athletes in 25 types of National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) championship sports over
5 seasons,15 the incidence during competition (per 10,000
athlete-exposures) was highest for men’s indoor track
(15.70), followed by outdoor track (15.39), soccer (14.69),
and football (10.67). During practice sessions, the highest
observed incidence was from men’s indoor track (5.93), fol-
lowed by soccer (5.01), outdoor track (3.91), and football
(3.82). The majority of hamstring injuries occur while the
athlete is running at maximal or close to maximal speeds.7
Of 109 runners (joggers, middle-distance runners, distance
runners, and sprinters) reported by Brubaker and James,12
hamstring injuries occurred in 12 cases; there were 9 inju-
ries in sprinters and 3 in runners. These authors also found
that
50%
of
all
injuries
in
sprinters
involved
the hamstrings. Sprinters show a high incidence of
hamstring injury.28
In 1985, Agre2 discussed hamstring injuries occurring
while running or sprinting. He listed several possible etio-
logical factors relating to injury to the hamstrings, includ-
ing (1) inadequate flexibility of the muscles, (2) inadequate
muscle strength and/or endurance, (3) dyssynergic muscle
contraction, (4) insufficient warm-up and stretching before
activity, (5) an awkward running style, and (6) a return to
activity before complete rehabilitation. These factors are
broadly accepted in the fields of practice and research. In
a theoretical model, Worrell55 suggested that a combination

 of abnormalities related to strength, flexibility, warm-up
method, and fatigue increases the risk of hamstring injury.
Devlin17 suggested that there is a threshold above which
the number of risk factors produces an injury; therefore,
some factors may be more predictive of injury than others.
According to Sugiura et al,49 not only strength deficits but
also neuromuscular control and flexibility problems con-
tribute to the incidence of hamstring injuries. Since the
occurrence of hamstring injury is complex and common, it
has been difficult to accumulate evidence for the best
method of preventing such injuries.
Most investigations of prevention of hamstring injury
have focused on ball sports (soccer and football).6,37,41,52,53
These studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
eccentric strength training of the hamstring muscles and
a combination of measures to prevent hamstring injury. On
the other hand, no studies have reported on the effect of
hamstring injury prevention programs for sprinters.
The purpose of this study was to document the incidence
of hamstring injuries in a single athletic program over time
as different prevention strategies were employed, examin-
ing whether a particular prevention program could reduce
the occurrence of hamstring injuries.
METHODS
Subjects
The study subjects comprised 613 collegiate male sprinters
(age range, 18-24 years) over 24 athletic seasons. Most of
the subjects were top-ranked sprinters in intercollegiate or
national championships in Japan. The sprint training pro-
gram was supervised by the same coach throughout all
24 seasons. The coach also had the final decision on the
sprinters’ participation in training and athletic meets.
Records for training and meets of each sprinter were main-
tained every season. Informed consent was obtained from
all subjects.
Study Periods
The total study period was the 24 seasons beginning in
1988, when supramaximal running was first introduced
as a type of sprint training, through the 2011 season. One
season is defined as the period from April of one year
through March of the next year. The 24-year study period
was divided into 3 periods according to changes in the train-
ing program. As is typical in athletics, new training meth-
ods and machines were developed and introduced,
particularly in Olympic years. Period 1 covered 4 seasons
(1988-1991), period 2 covered 8 (1992-1999), and period 3
covered 12 (2000-2011) (Figure 1).
Tow training was used throughout all 3 periods. The
objective of tow training with repeated episodes of supra-
maximal running is to improve sprint ability by producing a
higher stride frequency. Supramaximal running was per-
formed on the day after a rest day or in individual practice
when muscle fatigue was considered to be the lowest. Each
sprinter engaged in 2 to 5 supramaximal runs per day for
15 to 25 days per season. The number of runs for each
sprinter over a season was limited to a maximum of 50.
To provide appropriate injury prevention, the coach mod-
ified the program through repeated trial and error on the
field while investigating causative factors for injuries that
were sustained.
Hamstring Injury Prevention Program
The injury prevention program followed by the sprinters
evolved over time as established by the coach based on his
judgment of the most effective strategies to prevent ham-
string injuries (Table 1). Period 1 consisted only of concen-
tric hamstring strengthening using a traditional leg curl
weight machine. In period 2, agility training such as ladder
and mini-hurdle exercise was incorporated into the

 program. Halfway through this period, a newly developed
weight machine providing a concentric hip extension exer-
cise was also introduced. In period 3, in addition to the
programs taken place in period 2, eccentric hamstring
strengthening exercises (Nordic hamstring lower exer-
cise6,37 and gluteus-hamstring raise16) and dynamic
stretching exercises were added. The dynamic stretching
exercise consisted of walking lunge, hurdle walking for-
ward, and hurdle walking backward. The practice of flexi-
bility training through dynamic stretching is believed to
have an effect that smoothens the sprinting motion by
rehearsing the movement specific to the motion.
The strength exercises were performed as a part of a
general weight-training program. The agility and flexibility
training were performed during individual warm-ups.
Definition of Hamstring Injury
The occurrence of a hamstring injury during supramaximal
running was confirmed and documented by the coach, trai-
ners, and sports medicine doctors. Hamstring injuries were
diagnosed by local tenderness, pain, and reduced range of
motion on the straight-leg raise test as well as by evaluat-
ing for pain and reduced strength during resisted knee
flexion while prone.39 We defined an incident of hamstring
injury as one that caused the sprinter to refrain from train-
ing or competition for at least 1 week.11
Statistical Analysis
The number of sprinters who experienced hamstring injury
for each of the 3 periods according to prevention strategy
was recorded. On the basis of previous studies,4,5,22 the
injury incidence in each period was calculated as the num-
ber of hamstring injuries per athlete-seasons. The differ-
ence between the types of prevention and hamstring
injury incidence was investigated using a chi-square test
and residual analysis. The significance level was set at 1%.
RESULTS
A steady decline was seen in the number of hamstring inju-
ries over the study period (Figure 2). The incidence of ham-
string injuries per athlete-seasons was 137.9 for period 1,
60.6 for period 2, and 6.7 for period 3, with the incidence
decreasing significantly for each of the 3 periods
(w2(2) ¼ 31.78, P < .001; effect size: Cramer V ¼ 0.23, 1 �
b ¼ 0.999). Residual analysis showed that the number of
hamstring injuries for period 1 was significantly greater
than the expected value (P < .01), and the number for period
3 was significantly lower than expected (P < .01).
DISCUSSION
Strengths of the Study
A significant strength of this study is that all athletes were
trained by the same coach over the entire 24-year study
period. Therefore, with the exception of changes in the
injury prevention program, all 613 sprinters were treated
similarly. Also, the continued competitiveness of the team
indicates that the content of the sprint training was of
excellent quality.
Summary of Risk Factors for Hamstring Injuries
Understanding individual risk factors for hamstring injury
is vital to developing a hamstring injury prevention pro-
gram.40 These factors are traditionally divided into internal
and external categories.40 Recently, a more appropriate
grouping has been suggested, that is, modifiable and non-
modifiable, representing the complex interaction of multi-
ple risk factors.8,40 The most common modifiable factors are
the 6 described by Agre.2 The most common nonmodifiable
factors are anatomy, previous injury, age, and race.27
Effects of Adding Agility Training and Hip Extension
Exercise on Hamstring Injury Rate
From the late-swing phase to the early-contact phase dur-
ing running at full speed, the hamstring is required to
switch rapidly from eccentric to concentric contraction in
the stretch-shortening cycle45-47 while under the influence
of the contractile activity of the quadriceps femoris muscle.
Therefore, neuromuscular coordination plays an important
role in this activity. A hamstring muscle injury is conjec-
tured to occur when there is muscular dyssynergy such as a
disorder in the timing of the contraction from the late-
swing phase to the early-contact phase.2
During supramaximal running, it is possible to achieve a
higher stride rate than with maximal running. However,
the excessive stride rate increases the possibility of ham-
string injury. Mero and Komi34-36 have pointed out that
adequate neuromuscular performance is important for
Figure 2. Effects of a combined prevention program on
incidence of hamstring injuries. Period 1 consisted of only a
strength training program. In period 2, agility training was
incorporated into the strength training. In period 3, flexibility
training was added to strength and agility training. The
number of hamstring injuries was 16 out of 116 sprinters in
period 1, 12 out of 198 in period 2, and 2 out of 299 in period 3.

 supramaximal running. Agility training is practiced to
‘‘learn’’ the rapid motion required at a supramaximal level
of running. Sprinters who practiced with ladders and mini-
hurdles exhibited rapid stepping at a rate equivalent to or
faster than the stride rate observed (4.00-4.76 steps/s)
during supramaximal running.48 Moreover, it is reported
that the activity of the cerebellum, which plays a primary
role in motor learning, is correlated with movement veloc-
ity.20,30 It is likely that muscle synergy adapted to high-
level sprinting can be acquired by sprinters through the
use of ladders and mini-hurdles. This could explain why
we observed a decrease in the number of hamstring injuries
during supramaximal running when agility training was
added in period 2.
When sprinting, the function of the hamstrings in the
late-swing phase is that of concentric hip extension to
quickly swing the thigh back1,29 while also contracting
eccentrically in flexing the knee to decelerate the for-
ward swing of the lower leg.1,29,45 In the early-contact
phase, the hamstring functions to minimize the loss of
running speed by acting as a concentric knee flexor and
hip extensor, enabling the body’s center of gravity to
shift forward smoothly.29,45 The hamstrings must gener-
ate a large amount of power in these phases to maximize
speed during sprinting.1,13,29 These high forces have
been postulated to relate to the hamstring injuries com-
monly seen in sprinters.
There are many studies investigating the causative fac-
tors of hamstring injuries from the perspective of leg
strength. The relationship between insufficient hamstring
strength during eccentric contraction and the occurrence of
hamstring injury has been highlighted.42,46 However,
Sugiura et al49 reported that insufficient muscle strength
in the concentric action of the hip extensors may also con-
tribute to hamstring injury. It may be important to assess
the concentric strength of the gluteus muscles, as they work
with the hamstrings to extend the hip.33
The aim of strength training is to improve the muscle’s
ability to respond to high-intensity (force) activity when the
hamstring contracts concentrically. During periods 2 and 3,
all sprinters in our study strengthened their hamstrings by
hip extension exercises. This facilitated adaptation to
supramaximal levels of power during supramaximal run-
ning. As a result, it is likely that the number of hamstring
injury cases that occurred decreased.
Effects of Adding Nordic Hamstring and Dynamic
Stretching Exercises on Hamstring Injury Rate
Epidemiological evidence suggests that the actual injury
often takes place during eccentric contraction of the ham-
string muscles.18,25,47 More specifically, it has been sug-
gested that it is the portion of eccentric hamstring
contraction occurring during the descending limb of the
muscle’s length-tension relationship that results in inju-
ries.11 Sprinting requires multiple episodes of eccentric
contraction in the late-swing phase, during which the
hamstring muscles generate tension while lengthening
(eccentric contraction) to decelerate knee extension.19,43
Increasing the eccentric contraction strength of the ham-
strings, achieved by lengthening the hamstring complex
while it is loaded and contracting, has therefore been pro-
posed as a method to prevent hamstring injuries.10,14,51
Nordic hamstring exercises have been shown to be effec-
tive in increasing eccentric hamstring strength, developing
higher maximal eccentric hamstring torques than is possi-
ble with leg curls.37 The aim of this type of strength train-
ing is to increase the strength of muscles that can respond
to high-intensity (force) activity with eccentric hamstring
contraction. As with strengthening concentric contraction,
strengthening eccentric contraction may also contribute to
a decrease in injuries.
Flexibility is an intrinsic property of body tissue, and it
determines the range of motion at a joint or group of joints
achievable without injury.21 Increases in joint ranges of
motion are associated with decreases in passive resistance
to stretching. This decrease in resistance can be described
as a decrease in muscle stiffness or an increase in muscle
compliance.32 Alonso et al3 reported that when hamstring
flexibility decreases, the length of the hamstring during
generation of peak torque becomes shorter. Also, Brockett
et al10 proved that short muscle length during the genera-
tion of peak torque is a risk factor for hamstring injury.
Therefore, a decrease in flexibility can contribute to ham-
string injury.
The purpose of stretching before an athletic event or
training is to ensure that the individual has sufficient
range of motion in his joint to perform the athletic activity
optimally and to decrease muscle stiffness (or increase mus-
cle compliance). Theoretically, risk of injury is thereby
decreased. Stretching is therefore intended to enhance per-
formance while decreasing the risk of injury.32,50
There are several methods by which to improve flexi-
bility, including static and dynamic stretching. Although
there is a difference in degree, flexibility improves with
whichever kind of stretching is used. Bandy et al9
described improved hamstring flexibility with dynamic
stretching. However, there are almost no studies demon-
strating the relationship between improved flexibility
through stretching and a decrease in the incidence of
injury.23,24 Stretching has not yet been demonstrated to
decrease injury.
Meanwhile, in research investigating the effects of
stretching on performance, the practice of static stretching
has been demonstrated to have a potentially negative
impact on performance directly after stretching.44,54 In con-
trast, dynamic stretching has been considered to have a
positive effect on performance and has recently been
endorsed as a replacement for static stretching.26,31 It is
recommended that dynamic stretching be done ‘‘as fast as
possible’’ before the performance.56
With respect to the effect of stretching on injury risk,
McHugh and Cosgrave32 suggested that decreased passive
resistance to stretching and hamstring injuries were some-
what interrelated. Dynamic stretching is conjectured to
prevent hamstring injury while also assisting athletes to
achieve a high level of performance. The practice of
dynamic stretching is potentially effective as a method of
preventing hamstring injuries.

The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
 Comparison With Other Studies on Prevention
Programs in Soccer and Football Players
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
Nordic hamstring exercises. Mjølsnes et al37 examined the
effects of the simple eccentric Nordic hamstring lower and
compared it to leg curls in well-trained soccer players. They
found a remarkable increase in eccentric torque production
after 10 weeks of eccentric strength training. Petersen
et al41 investigated the preventive effect of eccentric
strengthening of the hamstring muscles using the Nordic
hamstring exercise compared with no additional hamstring
exercise on the rate of acute hamstring injuries in profes-
sional and amateur male soccer players. These authors con-
cluded that Nordic hamstring exercises decreased the rate
of hamstring injuries. However, it is still unknown whether
these results can be generalized to other sports. The major-
ity of hamstring injuries occur while the athlete is running
at close to maximal speeds.7 In our study, the supramaxi-
mal running speeds in sprinters were certainly higher than
those required in other sports. The hamstring in sprinters
contracts very rapidly to generate a large amount of power
during full-speed running.49 Therefore, the similarity of
our findings to those performed in soccer players may sug-
gest that this type of Nordic hamstring exercise in an injury
prevention program can be useful in any sport with a high
risk of hamstring injuries.
Arnason et al6 concluded that eccentric strength training
with Nordic hamstring exercises combined with warm-up
stretching in top-league soccer teams appears to reduce the
risk of hamstring injuries, yet no effect was detected from
flexibility training alone. Verrall et al53 observed a signifi-
cant reduction in the incidence of hamstring injuries in
Australian rules football with a 3-component prevention
program including anaerobic interval training, stretching
while the muscle is fatigued, and implementing sport-
specific training drills. However, these authors cautioned
that the reduction in injury should not be attributed to any
particular component. Their program was accompanied by
the concept that the athletes should train as if they were
playing the game, and they believed that this was largely
responsible for decreasing injuries. Likewise, our final pro-
gram of hamstring injury prevention in period 3 employed
3 particular strategies, that is, strengthening, agility,
and flexibility for hamstring muscles. Although each
component of our prevention program might potentially
have decreased the hamstring injury rate, we do not
believe a single exercise in isolation was the reason for
the beneficial effect we observed. Along with Verrall
et al,53 we agree that it is not possible to determine which
factors are directly responsible for the observed effect.
Nevertheless, the marked decrease in injuries we observed
with modification of the program over the 24-year study
period is very encouraging.
Limitations
This study focused on addressing only 3 of the 6 modifi-
able factors described by Agre2 to be involved in ham-
string injury, namely inadequate strength, dyssynergic
contraction, and inadequate flexibility. The other 3 factors
were not specifically addressed in this study, even though
they may have been taken into consideration during prac-
tice. Our study was unable to address nonmodifiable fac-
tors possibly contributing to hamstring injury, such as
anterior pelvic tilt, fiber-type distribution, and previous
injury,38 as well as other potential confounders. In addi-
tion, the introduction of several prevention strategies at
the same time did not allow us to determine the relative
effect on injury reduction of each element of the preven-
tion program.
CONCLUSION
The incidence of hamstring injuries in sprinters
decreased as agility, further strength exercises, and flex-
ibility were incorporated into a prevention program that
already included strength training. Future study of risk
factors and prevention program should be prospective,
particularly aiming to establish a cause-and-effect rela-
tionship. Such studies should control for nonmodifiable
risk factors and ideally should include both control and
experimental groups.
