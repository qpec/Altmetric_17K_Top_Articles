Abstract 
23 
Individuals show high variability in body weight responses to exercise training. Expectations and 
24 
motivation towards effects of exercise on body weight might influence eating behaviour and could 
25 
conceal regulatory mechanisms. We conducted two single-blind exercise trials (4 weeks (study 1) 
26 
and 8 weeks (study 2)) with concealed objectives and exclusion of individuals with weight loss 
27 
intention. Circuit exercise training programs (3 times a week (45-90 min), intensity 50-90% VO2peak, 
28 
for 4 and 8 weeks) were conducted. 34 females finished the 4 weeks intervention and 36 females 
29 
the 8 weeks intervention. Overweight/obese (OV/OB) and lean (L) female participants´ weight/body 
30 
composition responses were assessed and fasting and postprandial appetite hormone levels (PYY, 
31 
insulin, amylin, leptin, ghrelin) were measured pre and post intervention for understanding potential 
32 
contribution to individuals’ body weight response to exercise training (study 2). Exercise training in 
33 
both studies did not lead to a significant reduction of weight/BMI in the participants’ groups, 
34 
however, lean participants gained muscle mass. Appetite hormones levels were significantly (p<0.05) 
35 
altered in the OV/OB group affecting fasting (-24%) and postprandial amylin (-14%) levels. 
36 
Investigation of individuals’ BMI responses using multiple regression analysis revealed that levels of 
37 
fasting leptin, postprandial amylin increase, and BMI were significant predictors of BMI change 
38 
explaining about 43% of the variance. In conclusion, tested exercise training did not lead to weight 
39 
loss in female participants, while a considerable proportion of variance in body weight response to 
40 
training could be explained by individuals’ appetite hormone levels and BMI.

Introduction 
47 
Exercise is often prescribed for weight loss (Donnelly et al. 2009). However, although weight loss is 
48 
often reported (Ross et al. 2000, 2004), exercise training does not always result in weight loss and 
49 
often reveals high individual variability in body weight changes (King et al. 2007, 2008, Barwell et al. 
50 
2009). Possible causes of less than expected weight outcomes are suggested to be modified 
51 
appetite, perceived reinforcement value of food and altered unstructured physical activity (Blundell 
52 
et al. 2003, King et al. 2007, Church et al. 2009). Accordingly, the concept of compensators and non-
53 
compensators of negative energy balance has been established, although causes for individuals’ 
54 
responses are still debated (Finlayson et al. 2009). Energy balance, and therefore body weight, is 
55 
regulated by mediators released from gastrointestinal apparatus, pancreas and fat tissue, as well as 
56 
nutrients. Tonic and phasic signals provide important information about the energy status to the 
57 
brain. Leptin and insulin, as well as possibly amylin, providing tonic information about energy status; 
58 
ghrelin, as well as PYY (1-36, 3-36), GLP-1, CCK, and again amylin and insulin providing phasic signals 
59 
direct to the hypothalamus but also to the hind brain (Suzuki et al. 2010). Moreover, the levels of 
60 
response to hormonal changes are not restricted to satiety and hunger but expand to neuronal 
61 
systems connected to hedonic responses, like the mesolimbic dopamine neurons towards leptin and 
62 
insulin (Figlewicz 2003, Figlewicz and Benoit 2009) or ghrelin’s involvement in reward processing 
63 
(Jerlhag et al. 2007). Alterations on hormonal levels are shown to contribute to the regulation of 
64 
energy balance if challenged by exercise training (Stensel 2010); with training PYY and ghrelin are 
65 
more consistently found to be altered then others (Broom et al. 2009, Ueda et al. 2009, Kawano et 
66 
al. 2013). A possible influencing factor in exercise training studies is the control of motivation and 
67 
intention of individuals to restrain their food intake, even if this may not be wanted by the 
68 
experimenters. It is possible that some studies are biased towards weight loss based on the 
69 
recruitment of participants who may be motivated to lose weight and not naïve towards study aims 
70 
and objectives. To investigate possible mediators influencing individuals’ weight loss response to 
71 
exercise we conducted two single blind exercise training studies, one lasting 4 weeks (study 1) and 
72

the other lasting 8 weeks (study 2). Group-based circuit training exercises were performed at 50-95% 
73 
VO2peak, 3 times a week, for 45-90 min. Energy intake was ad libitum in both studies, which were 
74 
designed with the intention of avoiding the formerly mentioned influence of motivation to lose 
75 
weight. Thus, aims and objectives were concealed from the participants and spurious objectives 
76 
were provided. Females over a wide range of BMI were recruited as participants and individuals who 
77 
expressed an intention to lose weight were excluded. In the first study (4 weeks), a randomized 
78 
control design was used and body characteristics and composition, as well as cardiovascular fitness 
79 
were measured pre and post training. In the second study (8 weeks), fasting and postprandial blood 
80 
samples were taken for measurements of appetite hormones and metabolites, body composition, 
81 
cardiovascular fitness, and resting metabolic rate assessed pre and post intervention. We 
82 
hypothesized that a) females with overweight/obesity and leanness would regulate their body 
83 
weight successfully leading to no weight/BMI changes after the training interventions; b) measured 
84 
appetite hormones levels (PYY, insulin, amylin, leptin, ghrelin) could be used to explain individuals’ 
85 
variance in BMI changes; c) hormone levels would be affected by exercise training leading to 
86 
reduced levels of appetite suppressing hormones.

Materials and methods 
89 
The two studies were approved by Bangor University ethics committee and the North Wales 
90 
Research Ethics Committee – West (Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board – REC No 11/WA/0321 
91 
and 12/WA/0118). All participants were given written and verbal information and participants 
92 
provided written informed consent.  
93 
Participants and studies design 
94 
For both studies, sedentary females were recruited. In study 1, 40 females were recruited for a 4 
95 
weeks training intervention, with 34 finishing the study. Participants were randomly allocated to an 
96

exercise training group or a control group.  In study 2, 56 females were recruited for an 8 weeks 
97 
training intervention with 36 females completing. For both studies, recruitment was performed 
98 
using emails to students and employees of Bangor University and posters in the Bangor area. To 
99 
conceal the aims and objectives of the research, potential participants were informed that the study 
100 
investigated the influence of exercise training on cognitive performance and cardiovascular fitness. In 
101 
study 2, an incentive for taking part was the reimbursement for effort with a pair of trainers up to 
102 
£100 value. The element of deception in both studies was achieved using a computer based 
103 
cognitive sorting task for measuring reaction times in recognising combinations of pictures and 
104 
words. Participant information sheets were written according to the spurious objectives, and any 
105 
questions arising were answered by researchers accordingly. Participants were debriefed after the 
106 
intervention. 
107 
Potential participants were selected to take part in the study based on their responses to a pre-
108 
screening questionnaire assessing health, physical activity, general diet habits (i.e. restrictive diet). 
109 
To avoid participants’ bias towards weight loss and potential dieting, we used Aizen’s theory of 
110 
planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991) as a framework for including/excluding participants based on 
111 
current intention to lose weight (Sørensen et al. 2005). Participants were aged between 18 and 40; 
112 
BMI categories were lean (L) < 25 kg/m2 and overweight/obese (OV/OB) > 25 kg/m2; healthy; 
113 
sedentary; not following any type of specialised diet; and having not stated an intention to lose 
114 
weight.  
115 
Exercise sessions were circuit based (e.g.running on the spot, lunges, star jumps, sit-ups, press-ups 
116 
and squats) for both studies and completed 3 times a week. Length of sessions was 60 minutes in 
117 
study 1, and between 40 – 90 minutes in study 2, dependent upon the intensity of exercise required 
118 
to achieve equal exercise energy expenditure across two training groups (descriptions follows). All 
119 
sessions were completed in small training groups (5-10 participants) and supervised by 3 members 
120 
of the research team. Participants trained in groups according to their BMI group (L or OV/OB). In

study 1, after randomized distribution into control and exercise group, individuals trained on a target 
122 
heart rate representing 70-80% of their heart rate at �� O2peak. The control group did not take part in 
123 
any exercise training. In study 2, to include the influence of exercise intensity into the design, 
124 
participants were randomly assigned to two exercise intensities moderate (50-60% �� O2peak) (L and 
125 
OV/OB) and high intensity (80-90% �� O2peak) (L and OV/OB) training groups. Exercise intensity was 
126 
used as a continuous variable based on heart rate recordings as well as a covariate in the statistical 
127 
analysis due to high variability of achieved target heart rates in the groups. Heart rate was 
128 
continuously recorded throughout all sessions and an approximation of energy expenditure was 
129 
calculated based on �� O2peak assessment. Training intensity was controlled by a telemetric heart 
130 
rate monitoring system (Activio, Activio Sport System, Sweden) displaying the live heart rates of 
131 
each participant. HR data were analysed to calculate mean exercise intensity and estimates of 
132 
energy expenditure throughout the 8 weeks training (study 2) to achieve a matched total exercise 
133 
energy expenditure across groups.  
134 
Anthropometry 
135 
Body mass and composition were measured using a beam scale (Seca, Germany) and dual-energy x-
136 
ray absorptiometry (DXA; QDR 4500, Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). 
137 
Resting metabolic measurements 
138 
In study 2, after 12 hour overnight fast participants, having refrained from exercise for 48 hours, 
139 
resting metabolic rate (kcal.min-1) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER; �� CO2/�� O2) were measured 
140 
by indirect calorimetry (Oxycon Pro, Erich Jaegar, Germany) in a supine position for 30 minutes; 
141 
heart rate (Polar RS800CX, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) was also recorded. 
142 
Blood sampling and analysis 
143 
In study 2, under both overnight-fasting and postprandial conditions 12ml of venous blood was 
144 
collected from the antecubital vein. Glucose was measured by the Accu-Chek Aviva glucose meter

(Accu-Chek® Aviva, Mannheim, Germany). For further measurements, plasma was aliquoted, frozen 
146 
and stored at -80oC. Hormone measurements were carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
147 
assay (ELISA) and plate reader (Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany). ELISAs were carried out to 
148 
measure amylin (Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) (intra assay CV: 12% ), insulin (Mercodia, Uppsala, 
149 
Sweden) (intra assay CV: 7%), leptin (BioVendor Research and Diagnostic Products, BioVendor – 
150 
Laboratorni medicina a.s., Czech Republic) (intra assay CV: 7% ), total ghrelin (Millipore; St. Charles, 
151 
MO, USA) (intra assay CV: 4%), and PYY (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) (intra assay CV: 
152 
12%). The Homeostasis Model Assessment version 2 (HOMA2) (www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/) 
153 
was used to calculate beta cell function, insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity. All samples were 
154 
batch analysed and assayed in duplicate. 
155 
Test meal 
156 
In study 2, to analyse potential influence of chronic and phasic appetite hormone changes on 
157 
individual BMI alterations, participants were given a liquid test meal (Resource® Energy Vanilla 
158 
200ml, Nestle, Switzerland) following overnight fast according to a modified protocol by Kraemer et 
159 
al. (2011). The meal provided 300kcal of which 55% was carbohydrate, 30% fat and 15% protein. This 
160 
test meal was chosen to avoid variability in intake composition and processing known from more 
161 
complex meals. Blood samples were taken prior to the test meal at fasting state and precisely 1 hour 
162 
after consumption. Timing of blood sampling was chosen due to former experiments selecting the 
163 
time point with the strongest correlation between appetite hormone levels and BMI-based body 
164 
type. Significant (p<0.05) correlations between BMI and appetite hormone levels at fasting (F), 
165 
postprandial (PP) levels and alterations (CH) were found for insulin (F, rho= 0.49; PP, rho= 0.37 ), 
166 
amylin (F, rho= 0.49; CH, rho= -0.48 ), PYY (CH, rho= -0.33), ghrelin (CH, rho=0.43), leptin (F, rho= 
167 
0.59).

For both studies, peak oxygen uptake (�� O2PEAK; ml.kg-1.min-1) was measured on a cycle ergometer 
170 
(Corival 400, Lode, Groningen, Netherlands) using a graded exercise protocol with 1 minute stages 
171 
(20 watts steps), until exhaustion. Oxygen and carbon dioxide were measured by a metabolic cart 
172 
(Oxycon Pro, Erich Jaegar, Germany). Heart rate (Polar RS800CX, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) 
173 
and ratings of perceived exertion (Borg 1973) were collected at the end of every stage and at point 
174 
of exhaustion. �� O2PEAK was achieved when one of three criteria was met: RER greater than 1.1, RPE 
175 
of 20 or cycling cadence less than 60rpm. Control subjects in study 1 were not tested for �� O2PEAK. 
176 
Statistical analysis 
177 
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Data were analysed either by 
178 
one-way ANOVA (baseline characteristics), ANCOVA using exercise intensity as a covariate or by 
179 
mixed model ANOVA and appropriate post hoc analysis, after assumptions had been met and 
180 
outliers removed. Pearson’s and Spearman’s rho correlations were used to analyse relationships 
181 
between variables. Multiple regression analyses using the enter and backward methods were 
182 
performed on variables of interest. All data are reported as means and ± standard deviation. 
183 
Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.  
184 
 
185 
Results 
186 
In the first study, 34 female participants of the 40 recruited finished the intervention. Mixed model 
187 
ANOVA with repeated measures revealed that there were no significant alterations in weight/BMI 
188 
after the 4 weeks, neither in the exercise training group nor in the non-exercising control group 
189 
(Table 1). Consequently, exercise related energy expenditure was compensated and body 
190 
weight/BMI was maintained. Further analysis of body composition showed that there was a 
191 
significant reduction in body fat [%] in the exercise group, however, this effect was only seen in the 
192 
lean participants who lost about 0.5 kg fat (significant effect of time (p=0.018), interaction of time x 
193

9 
 
trial (control/exercise) (p=0.041), and interaction of time x baseline body fat [%] (p=0.046)), (Table 
194 
1). Moreover, an increase in lean mass (kg) was significant only in the lean participants of the 
195 
exercise group, who gained about 1 kg lean mass (increase of lean mass over time (p=0.009), 
196 
interaction of time x baseline fat percentage [%] (p=0.028) and time x trial (control/exercise) 
197 
(p=0.05)), (Table 1). Individual alterations in body characteristics over the 4 weeks intervention 
198 
period are depicted in Figure 1; positive effects on body composition were restricted to lean 
199 
participants of the exercise group but without alteration of weight/BMI.  
200 
The second study used principally the same experimental design but omitting a non-exercising 
201 
group; the training program was performed for 8 weeks. Additionally, exercise energy expenditure 
202 
was matched across participants using a wider range of training intensities (50-90%VO2peak). 
203 
Training intensity was implemented as a covariate to investigate its possible influence on weight and 
204 
body composition. This was suggested based on outcomes of study 1 where body composition 
205 
changes were restricted to lean participants who trained on higher absolute intensity. Moreover, 
206 
fasting and postprandial blood samples were collected for the analysis of appetite hormones and 
207 
metabolites pre and post intervention. The design was chosen to confirm outcomes of study 1 with a 
208 
further focus on the investigation of underlying factors responsible for individual weight/BMI 
209 
responses to exercise in lean and overweight/obese females.  
210 
From the 56 recruited females for the 8 weeks training program, 36 females finished the study. 
211 
Baseline body characteristics and blood parameters of the participants are given in Table 2. OV/OB 
212 
participants had higher (p < 0.05) levels of BMI, weight, fat mass, lean mass, and RMR as well as 
213 
lower relative VO2peak compared with L individuals (Table 2).  
214 
Training compliance was ~85 % across the training groups with no difference between groups; heart 
215 
rate based estimates of total exercise energy expenditure, amounting to ~3400 kcal after 8 weeks, 
216 
and was matched across the groups (Table 3). Moreover, mean training intensity in percent heart 
217 
rate reserve was about 65% with no difference between lean and OV/OB groups (Table 3).  
218

Mixed model ANOVA with body type (BMI groups) as between factor and training intensity as 
219 
covariate revealed that 8 weeks training did not lead to significant alterations of BMI/weight in 
220 
either group (no significant main effect of time, or interactions of time x group) (Table 3); hence, 
221 
both groups compensated the exercise energy expenditure over the training period confirming 
222 
outcomes of study 1. In terms of body composition changes, females of the lean group lost body fat 
223 
while participants of the OV/OB group remained unaltered after the training period (no significant 
224 
time effect was reported for body fat [%] change but a significant (p=0.008) interaction of time x 
225 
body type). Moreover, lean mass (kg) was not affected (non-significant time effect) but there was a 
226 
significant interaction time x training intensity (p=0.025) supporting the hypothesis that lean mass 
227 
changes have been influenced by training intensity (Table 3). A further splitting of the data (Table 4) 
228 
in moderate and high intensity training groups without consideration of BMI shows that the higher 
229 
intensity group tended to gain more lean mass than the moderate exercise group. Moreover, a 
230 
significant correlation (R=0.458; p=0.006) between training intensity and �� O2PEAK showed that 
231 
individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tended to train harder.  
232 
In summary, the second study confirmed that lean and OV/OB females compensate exercise induced 
233 
energy expenditure without losing weight but positive body composition changes were more 
234 
apparent in lean participants being possibly related to training intensity.  
235 
To further investigate individuals’ weight/BMI response to training (individuals’ post intervention 
236 
changes in BMI and body composition are shown in Figure 2), we analysed fasting and postprandial 
237 
blood samples.   
238 
ANOVA analysis of pre intervention levels of the two groups revealed significant differences in 
239 
fasting levels for leptin, PYY, insulin, and amylin between groups (Table 5). Moreover, postprandial 
240 
increases in amylin and PYY were significantly different between L and OV/OB groups (Table 5). After 
241 
8 weeks exercise training, fasting and postprandial levels of amylin were significantly reduced in the 
242 
OV/OB group but not in the L group (no significant main effect of time, significant interaction of time

11 
 
x body type, p<0.001 for fasting and postprandial levels, p=0.004) (Table 5). The postprandial 
244 
increase of amylin, which was significantly different between groups, was unaltered after the 
245 
training revealing an unchanged higher increase of amylin after the test meal in L group females 
246 
compared with females of the OV/OB group (Table 5). Multiple regression analysis showed that 
247 
postprandial amylin levels after the intervention were determined (R2=0.34, p=0.002, n=33) by 
248 
fasting glucose levels (β=0.35, p=0.027) and postprandial increase in glucose (β=0.50, p=0.002). 
249 
Fasting and postprandial levels of insulin, leptin, PYY, total ghrelin were unchanged after exercise 
250 
training (no significant main effect and interactions) (Table 5).  
251 
To further associate hormonal levels with individuals’ BMI response to exercise (see also figure 2), 
252 
we performed multiple regression analysis (enter method) using appetite hormone levels as 
253 
predictor variables and body characteristics for post intervention BMI changes. Analysis led to a 
254 
significant model for the BMI change of participants who finished the training; the model used post 
255 
intervention levels of leptin (β=0.59, p=0.002) and postprandial amylin change (β=-0.37, p=0.03), and 
256 
pre-intervention BMI (β=-0.44, p=0.02) as predictor variables. The three variables explain 43% of the 
257 
variance of the BMI alterations (R2=0.43, p=0.002, n=30) after training. Other hormone parameters 
258 
did not lead to significant model improvements.

There were significantly higher levels in insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and lower insulin 
261 
resistance in the L- than in the OV/OB group. However, comparisons of HOMA 2 parameters 
262 
revealed no significant alterations after 8 weeks training. Additionally, �� O2peak, RER, RMR, and 
263 
fasting glucose levels were not significantly changed (Table 3).

We conducted two exercise training interventions with sedentary females with concealed aims and 
267 
objectives of the study and excluding participants who expressed an intention to lose weight. To our 
268 
knowledge, this is the first exercise training study which tried to achieve ad libitum conditions for 
269 
participants whilst avoiding the influence of explicit motivation towards weight loss. Both 
270 
interventions did not lead to significant weight loss/BMI change in both OV/OB and L groups after 4 
271 
and 8 weeks training. This finding is consistent with our first hypothesis and we interpret this as 
272 
indicative of intact weight regulation over the periods of the exercise training, even in females with 
273 
high BMI (e.g. overweight/obesity). This outcome, considering the mean weight changes, as well as 
274 
individual weight responses to exercise, is dissimilar to results published earlier (King et al. 2007, 
275 
2008). For example, King et al. (2008) reported considerable weight loss with high variability 
276 
amongst overweight/obese participants and outcomes were skewed towards weight loss. This 
277 
suggests that BMI/weight alterations in comparable training studies might be partially driven by 
278 
participants’ intention to lose weight with concomitant consequences for eating behaviour rather 
279 
than a singular effect of exercise. Additionally, recent work showed that the window for a 
280 
satisfactory increase in total energy expenditure is narrow; in a large, diverse population sample it 
281 
was shown that only about 7-9% of the variance in total energy expenditure was explained by 
282 
physical activity (Pontzer et al. 2016). These authors assume that homeostatic regulation not only 
283 
affects weight but also total energy expenditure. 
284 
Our study results on group level (i.e. no weight change over time), though, do not explain the 
285 
individuals’ weight response to training which varied strongly from considerable weight loss to 
286 
weight gain, a consistent finding in studies which lead to the concept of compensators and non-
287 
compensators (King et al. 2008). As mentioned before, body weight is influenced by homeostatic and 
288 
hedonic mechanisms, with some authors suggesting that humans are more prone to be driven by 
289 
hedonic regulation (Berthoud 2011). Indeed, exercise energy depletion could increase the incentive 
290 
salience of food, like it is known from fasting (Berthoud 2011) and increasing hunger levels have 
291 
previously been reported following exercise training (King et al. 2009). However, it was suggested 
292

that alterations in food reward after exercise bouts are not influenced by exercise training and the 
293 
reward response seems to be more trait-like. Finlayson et al. (2011) did not find alterations in 
294 
wanting and liking of foods after 12 weeks training but participants who lost weight (responders) 
295 
had a lesser increase in food reward after a bout of exercise than participants who reduced weight 
296 
less than predicted (non-responders). Additionally, in our study, participants, not having the 
297 
objective to lose weight, could have responded to the exhaustion and sensation of effort related to 
298 
exercise in a self-rewarding manner with the selection of high palatable foods. Furthermore, poor 
299 
judgement of caloric expenditure could have reduced existing diet restrain. Clearly, these possible 
300 
factors might have contributed to the variance in the weight outcomes in our study. However, due 
301 
to our study design we were not able to collect data about any alterations in food reward. On the 
302 
other hand, it is known that both regulatory processes are heavily interlinked and difficult to 
303 
separate; in particular appetite hormones are repeatedly shown to influence 'liking' and 'wanting' or 
304 
reward perception, as well as influencing energy intake and energy metabolism (Volkow et al. 2011). 
305 
While we gathered no information about the individuals' motives of eating in our study, we still 
306 
gathered information about appetite hormones responses at fasting and postprandial levels to 
307 
analyse their possible contribution to the variability of weight/BMI changes after the exercise 
308 
training intervention. Post intervention, most of the tested appetite hormones revealed no 
309 
alterations in both groups maintaining the differences detected at baseline. Nonetheless, we found 
310 
significant alterations of amylin at fasting and postprandial levels in the OV/OB group, while the L 
311 
group revealed no changes after the 8 weeks training intervention. Reports about alterations in 
312 
amylin levels in response to exercise training are sparse; Izadpanah et al. (Izadpanah et al. 2012) and 
313 
Roberts at al. (2013) reported a reduction of amylin in response to a combined diet exercise 
314 
intervention in children with obesity for 14 days. Additionally, acute responses to exercise bouts 
315 
with a reduction of amylin after prolonged exercise bouts (Kraemer et al. 2011) and increase in 
316 
higher intensity bouts (Kraemer et al. 2002) were recently shown. Mechanistically, amylin expression 
317 
in beta cells was recently shown to respond directly to glucose availability via carbohydrate-

response-element-binding-protein (ChREBP) and thioredoxin-interacting-protein (TXNIP) (Jing et al. 
319 
2014). Indeed, our data revealed that amylin levels were significantly influenced by fasting levels and 
320 
postprandial increase of glucose supporting this possible connection between amylin levels and 
321 
altered glucose availability. Moreover, a positive associations between postprandial amylin levels 
322 
and fasting glucose levels at post intervention was particular strong (r=0.625, p=0.02) in OV/OB 
323 
group which highlights a possible connection between glucose availability and amylin levels. Clearly, 
324 
fasting glucose levels can be influenced via sugar/carbohydrate intake (Sartor et al. 2013) as well as 
325 
exercise (Sartor et al. 2010). Theoretically, a stronger depletion in glycogen storage during exercise 
326 
in OV/OB individuals who might have more preferred carbohydrate utilization during exercise could 
327 
have reduced glucose availability and could have led to reduced amylin levels with consequences for 
328 
appetite and possible compensatory food intake. 
329 
Participation in exercise is often driven by a desire to lose weight (Teixeira et al. 2012). However, 
330 
individual physiological differences may confound attempts to lose weight. In our study, observed 
331 
amylin alterations contributed to the individual weight outcomes after the intervention. Indeed, our 
332 
multiple regression analysis showed that hormone levels of leptin and postprandial amylin increase 
333 
were best predictors for BMI changes (about 43% of BMI change variance explained). Leptin is 
334 
known to be the most important tonic signal of fatness and mainly sensed in the hypothalamus for 
335 
the intrinsic drive to eat and consequently for the regulation of body weight and energy expenditure 
336 
(Blundell and Gillett 2001); therefore the contribution of leptin levels in the model is not 
337 
unexpected. Additionally, leptin’s links towards perceptual response to food was recently 
338 
established identifying fasting leptin levels as a determinant of food reward (Hopkins et al. 2014). 
339 
However, the strong contribution of amylin for the model is noteworthy. Amylin is known to play a 
340 
role as a satiogenic signal, inhibits gastric emptying, and possesses glucoregulatory functions; 
341 
agonists are well established in supporting weight loss in people with obesity (Smith et al. 2007). 
342 
Moreover, amylin and leptin are shown to share important functions in the hindbrain and 
343 
hypothalamus; it is suggested that amylin enhances leptin signalling and lead to transient alteration 
344

of leptin responsiveness threshold (Trevaskis et al. 2010). Decreased amylin levels (postprandial and 
345 
fasting) could increase leptin responsiveness threshold and could have led to increased energy 
346 
intake in response to exercise training. Consequently, participants who displayed a combination of 
347 
high levels of leptin and low postprandial increase in amylin were more prone to weight gain during 
348 
exercise training. However, further work needs to support this interpretation. 
349 
Our work has several limitation; firstly, the selection of appetite hormones measured in this study 
350 
does not exclude the importance and possible contribution of other hormones to the weight 
351 
response in our study. Clearly, other hormones are consistently shown to be affected by training. 
352 
Exercise training type, intensity, and duration are certainly factors that could influence outcomes in 
353 
studies; besides the involvement of restricted dieting. Moreover, knowledge about altered food 
354 
preference over the training period in terms of caloric density, macronutrient amounts and 
355 
composition would have supported the interpretation of results largely. However, the need for not 
356 
disclosing objectives of our study excluded the recording of precise food diaries and assessments of 
357 
food liking, wanting and preference.  However, our study used an ecological training programme 
358 
which includes exercises and intensities commonly used in leisure centres or gyms. Finally, we used 
359 
females only; consequently, we can’t extrapolate findings towards males. 
360 
In summary, we have shown that under ad libitum condition 4 and 8 weeks exercise training did not 
361 
result in weight loss in females over a wide range of BMI. Appetite hormone responses revealed 
362 
decrease in amylin at fasting and postprandial levels, however this was restricted to 
363 
overweight/obese participants. A large proportion of variance in BMI changes after training could be 
364 
explained by postprandial amylin increase and leptin levels, pointing towards an important influence 
365 
of amylin for weight regulation during exercise training.  
366 
Perspective 
367 
Exercise training is often performed with the objective of losing weight. However, individuals may 
368 
face less than expected weight loss or even weight gain over an exercise training period. Clearly, 
369

16 
 
unrealistic expectations about the response of an individual to exercise training impairs exercise 
370 
participation, in particular in population groups who could largely benefit on many other health 
371 
levels other than weight loss. In our single blind exercise training study, excluding participants with 
372 
weight loss intentions, females within a wide range of BMI, did not lose weight on group levels. 
373 
However, individual weight gains or losses could be explained by appetite hormone levels. In 
374 
particular, levels of amylin and leptin could explain a significant proportion (43%) of the variance in 
375 
BMI changes post training. Our results highlight the need for individualized interventions tailored 
376 
also to the physiological and not only to psychological characteristics of clients in weight loss 
377 
programs.
