money’? A follow-up of a Danish case-study

Abstract
Background: The recent surge of asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) is raising questions about the EU’s
ability to integrate newcomers into the economy and into society; particularly those who need specialized services
for the treatment of severe trauma. This study investigated whether rehabilitating traumatised refugees represents
‘value-for-money’ (VfM) in terms of intervention cost per health gain and in a long-term and societal perspective.
Methods: The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility analysis (CUA) and a partial cost-benefit analysis (CBA).
The CUA incorporated data on Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for 45 patients who were treated at the
Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims, Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2001–2004 and followed for up to
2 years, to determine the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). For the CBA, data was collected for 44 patients
who completed treatment between 2001 and 2004 and 44 matched controls on the waiting list, for the patients’
primary health care utilisation, and personal and family labour income from 2001 to 2014. This was analysed to
evaluate the Net Social Benefit (NSB) of the programme.
Results: The average cost of treatment was found to be about 32,000 USD per patient (2016 prices) with an
average gain in QALY of 0.82. The treatment was cost effective according to the ICER threshold suggested by the
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (UK). At the individual level, the NSB remained negative throughout
the study period. However, at the family income level the intervention proved to have been beneficial after 3 years.
Conclusion: The implication of the study is, that providing rehabilitation to severely traumatised refugee families
can be an economically viable strategy, considering the economic effects observed at the family level.

Background
Torture and its consequences have mostly received at-
tention in the academic literature as a socio-political
phenomenon with severe psychological ramifications.
Nevertheless, torture is also assumed to be financially
costly to society, not only in terms of treating the mental
and physical sequelae, but also through lost productivity,
as torture survivors often struggle to cope with day-to-
day work. However, little is known globally or at a
country level about the cost of torture to society. The
measurement of cost is notoriously difficult, because the
parameters involved are not easily defined and the data
not easily captured [1]. One study has attempted to
model
the
cost
societies
incur
as
refugee-hosting
countries; Mpinga and colleagues estimate the economic
burden of torture in Switzerland, using estimates of
prevalence of torture experience among refugees resid-
ing in Switzerland to model the socioeconomic conse-
quences of torture at country level. Their study shows
that the effects of torture create substantial economic
losses to society. They found that the greater part of this
loss is due to the indirect cost (approximately 10 billion
CHF) related to the loss of productivity over a period of
30 years. By comparison, direct expenditure related to

 housing, healthcare, food and education over the same
period amounted to roughly 130 million CHF [2]. The
authors acknowledge the potentially controversial nature
of calculating the cost associated with being a country
hosting traumatised refugees, but stress that their find-
ings should be seen within a strong ethical perspective,
using the economic argument to support the campaigns
for the prevention of torture [2].
The current crises in Syria and elsewhere leave little
hope that the number of people traumatised by war and
torture will diminish for many years. UNHCR estimates
that in 2015 65.3 million people were displaced, the
most ever recorded [3]. Many, though not all of them,
are forced to flee their own countries and seek asylum in
Europe and elsewhere. In 2015, the number of first-time
applicants for asylum in Europe increased to almost 1.26
million, more than doubling the number in 2014. This
increase was mainly due to applicants from Syria,
Afghanistan and Iraq [4]. Among the refugees who come
to Europe there will be a need for specialised help to
deal with the after-effects of torture and other poten-
tially traumatic experiences. It remains unclear how the
current influx of refugees will fare in society, and what
impact on the public finances of their host countries
their presence will have. This impact will depend on sev-
eral aspects, such as the age, gender, and skill-levels of
the refugees. Research done by the Deutsche Bank and
the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)
show that the economic consequences depend on how
successful social and economic integration is, and the
time-perspective employed in the analyses. Despite large
initial cost, these institutions find that investment in ref-
ugees is worthwhile in a longer-term perspective [5],
with better outcomes modelled for successful integration
efforts [6].
The refugee population is far from homogeneous and
the specific needs of individuals and their ability to inte-
grate successfully may vary substantially. In particular,
refugees who have been exposed to torture and other
war-related traumas experience a range of physical and
social problems that persist over time [7]. The conse-
quences of torture and war trauma include Post Trau-
matic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and
chronic pain, which pose particular challenges for main-
taining daily life and functioning [8, 9]. Moreover,
trauma has also been shown to affect the family through
intergenerational transmission. A person who has suf-
fered torture or war-related trauma may have profound
difficulty in maintaining a family role both in relation to
his or her spouse and in terms of parental responsive-
ness and role function [10–12]. Not only do intimate
partners of survivors display an elevated level of psychi-
atric symptoms and feelings of loneliness, among other
things [11], but studies show that parental PTSD and
depression is strongly correlated with child distress [13,
14]. Little is known about the relation between short-
term health outcomes for refugees and the longer-term
socioeconomic outcomes for the individual as well as
the family. So far, the evidence we do have suggests that
victimisation of individuals place an extra financial bur-
den on the individual and the family. Family members
might employ various coping strategies to address an in-
creased burden of care, including taking up debt, stop
going to school or work to care for the victim in the
family [15, 16].
Research evaluating rehabilitation programmes has
tended for many years to have an exclusively clinical
focus, especially in the specific area of rehabilitation for
torture and war survivors [17]. One aspect of ensuring
access to good quality rehabilitative care for traumatised
refugees also involves providing evidence of the societal
cost of torture, and on the cost-effectiveness and the
long-term economic impact of providing rehabilitative
services [18]. However, despite their importance, the
economic implications of torture have not been a re-
search priority [19] and only few have attempted to
document the economic viability of providing specialised
care for tortured and war-affected populations [20]. In
Denmark, care for tortured refugees is available at spe-
cialised clinics across the country. However, no system-
atic effort is currently in place to screen refugees for
torture trauma at the point of arrival to the country [21].
Therefore the specific issues and challenges torture sur-
vivors face, may either not be addressed at all, may be
managed in the Danish health care system at large or, if
referred to a specialised clinic for refugees be addressed
in this context. Moreover, despite public demand for
documenting the effect of the resources spend on re-
habilitative efforts and the long-term socioeconomic
outcome for this group, no systematic effort has been
carried out at this stage.
The present study addresses the gap in knowledge
about the economic effects of rehabilitation programmes
by evaluating a specific multidisciplinary rehabilitation
programme for torture survivors, from the point of view
of its economic viability. The rehabilitation programme
was provided for a severely traumatized group of
refugees living in Denmark. It is unique in that it ad-
dresses the socio-economic consequences of providing
multidisciplinary rehabilitation by combining data on
short-term
self-reported
health
improvements
with
longer-term economic data covering labour income and
expenditure on health services. The study is to our
knowledge the only of its kind combining both a cost-
utility analysis (CUA) and a partial cost-benefit analysis
(CBA), using actual rather than modelled data, to answer
the question of whether rehabilitation for survivors of
torture and war represent ‘value-for-money’ (VfM) in a

 societal perspective. This information will aide policy
makers in the allocation of expenditure in the Danish
health system as well as provide crucial feedback to the
specialised clinics who have direct contact with, and
knowledge of, this population’s concerns and needs.
Methods
Two-pronged approach to estimating ‘value-for money’
(VfM)
Evaluations of health interventions face the risk of exclud-
ing important impacts when focusing exclusively on indi-
vidual clinical outcomes. Consequently, the true effect of
the programme is underestimated as this occurs [22]. To
take the complex comorbidity torture survivors present
into account, and the multifaceted nature of the rehabili-
tation programme, the study employed a two-pronged
approach by combining a cost-utility and a partial cost-
benefit analysis, when estimating VfM (See Fig. 1 below).
This approach included a short-term perspective, using
data from self-reported quality of life (over 23 months)
and a longer-term societal perspective, based on popula-
tion register data on labour income and health care con-
sumption in the primary sector over a 14-year period
(2001–2014). To provide further nuances and qualify our
analysis, we included labour income not only for the indi-
viduals in the study population but subsequently also for
their families. Figure 1 below depicts the analytical ap-
proach in the study, illustrating the decision criteria by
which an intervention can be categorised as providing
VfM. Each analysis estimates VfM as compared to a pre-
determined decision criterion. In this study, the result of
the cost-utility analysis is compared to a threshold value,
while the cost-benefit analysis expresses the intervention’s
net contribution to society as a monetary value.
Datasets
The calculations are based on records of a course of treat-
ment provided for refugees in the Rehabilitation and
Research Centre for Torture Victims (now DIGNITY –
Danish Institute Against Torture), in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The effect of the treatment is captured using various clinical
measures, monitoring the process from visitation through
the follow-ups [23]. The treatment provided was individua-
lised and multidisciplinary in nature, consisting of sessions
with psychologists, doctors with different specialisations
(neurologist, psychiatrist and rheumatologist), physiothera-
pists, nurses, and social workers, and was delivered as either
individual or group therapy (for women). The composition
of the treatment, i.e. the number and types of sessions with
professionals, varied per the individual patient’s needs as
determined by the treatment team and the patient. The cost
of treatment and other services provided was found
using DIGNITYs financial records from 2001, when
the study was initiated. The treatment composition
at patient level was recorded and used to calculate
an average treatment cost. The average treatment
cost was used in both analyses and is the same for
both the CUA and the CBA. However, the CUA and
the CBA had different time perspectives and used
different outcomes measures. The necessary datasets
were obtained from various sources as illustrated in
Table 1.
Dataset: Cost-utility analysis
The key source of data for the CUA consisted of the cost
of treatment and monitoring data on improvements in
health-related quality of life. The calculation of the ini-
tial cost of treatment will be described in detail below.
Mental health and health-related quality of life were
assessed before the multidisciplinary rehabilitation was
carried out, and again at 9 and 23 months in a previous
study by Carlsson and colleagues [23]. From this previ-
ous study, which consisted of a comprehensive evalu-
ation of mental health and health-related quality of life,
we used the data from one outcome measure on self-
reported quality of life as recorded for a group of 45 in-
dividuals (the original sampled population was 69) who
had no missing data at baseline, 9 and 23 months’
follow-up. The original study was designed as a pre-post
study, and changes in quality of life was measured
against the baseline.
Dataset: Cost-benefit analysis
Data from Danish population-based registers over the
period 2001–2014 and the cost of treatment formed
the basis for this calculation. The Danish registers,

 both administrative and research-focused in nature,
contain substantial information on all individuals residing
permanently in Denmark. Residents of Denmark can be
identified through a unique personal identification number
which can be linked to the different registers, making the
registers highly relevant for longitudinal studies of socio-
economic and welfare outcomes [24] From Statistics
Denmark, which is a key supplier of register data, we ob-
tained data on labour income and health care consumption
in the primary sector for 44 treated and 44 untreated indi-
viduals as well as labour income for their families.
Study populations
All individuals included in this study were patients treated at
the Rehabilitation Centre and Research for Torture Victims
in Copenhagen and who all had a history of torture and war
trauma. The individuals were referred to the clinic by their
general practitioner. See Fig. 2 for the study overview.

 Cost-utility analysis
From the original study of 69 individuals, only 45 had
complete data at 23-months follow-up and the calcula-
tions on cost of treatment and quality of life is therefore
based on these 45 individuals. These 45 individuals were
treated at in the period from 2001 to 2004. This sample
consisted predominantly of individuals with Iraqi origin
(66.7%) and the group was majority male (66.7%). At the
23 months’ follow-up, this group had been in treatment
for an average of 14.3 months (SD = 6.98) and received
60.6 treatment sessions on average (SD = 43.19) [23].
From the original study, only data on quality of life and
information on treatment composition for the individual
patients were used (individual versus group-based, and
number and types of sessions received).
Cost-benefit analysis
The study population included in the CBA was also a
sample from the original case-study with 69 individuals
[25]. The potential pool of individuals to be included in
the CBA was larger than for the CUA, as the analysis was
not dependent on a complete set of monitoring data. This
was because the data could be obtained from the population
registers for all patients in the original case study through
the patients’ civil registration number.
For the CBA, a control group was needed. Finding a
suitable control group for a study over a long period was
challenging as it would have been highly unethical to se-
lect identified torture survivors and not offer them im-
mediate treatment. A comparison group was therefore
assembled with patients who were in treatment or on
the waiting list at the time of the sampling procedure
(winter/spring 2016). The sampling procedure for the
CBA is illustrated below in Fig. 3. While 69 individuals
were included in the original case study, only 62 had suf-
ficient data allowing for the matching procedure. Simi-
larly, out of the 130 individuals on the waiting list or in
treatment at the time of the sampling procedure, only 88
were eligible to be included. The 62 cases were matched
with the 88 controls using propensity score matching,
without replacement. A total of 44 treated individuals
were matched with 44 control individuals on age, gender,
country of origin, time of arrival to Denmark and on tor-
ture and/or war trauma. Matching individuals on the lat-
ter variable occurs indirectly, as it is what qualifies this
group of individuals to receive treatment at DIGNITY,
as a clinic granted special status in this area by the Min-
istry of Health in Denmark.
For the expansion of the CBA, family members of the
study population were included. The family as a unit is
defined by Statistics Denmark and includes individuals
living in the household with the same family ID number.
This includes children who are defined as children (bio-
logical or adopted) of at least one of the adults, 24 years

Data analysis
Cost of treatment
i.
Step-down costing
DIGNITYs internal financial accounts provided the
information for calculating treatment cost. Standard
recommendations for step-down costing were
followed [26]. The allocation of facility and
overhead cost were allocated to departments using
a spatial allocation criterion (square metres used) as
well as the number of staff in the department,
depending on the cost category. The cost per
session type (medical, nursing, psychological,
group-based, social work, physiotherapy) was then
calculated using the total salary for each
professional group and the total number of services
produced for each type of treatment.
ii. Micro costing
After the cost of different types of sessions had
been determined, this information was combined
with information on the actual treatment received
by the members of the study group. This was
possible since for the patients in the study group,
the number of each type of treatment session had
been recorded. This enabled the calculation of the
treatment cost to be completed at individual level.
The information was used to calculate the average
treatment cost which forms the basis for the cost
calculations of both the CUA and the CBA. The
treatment record available however, did not
distinguish psychological and medical assistance
from each other so these were grouped. The same
was the case for physiotherapy, nursing, and social
support sessions. In calculating the cost of sessions,
the former groups were allocated a higher cost than
the latter. The average treatment cost was
consequently constructed based on the number of
high and low-fee sessions received by the study
group.
Quality adjusted life years (QALY)
For the CUA, the outcome measure was Quality Adjusted
Life Years (QALYs). QALYs were calculated using results
for the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire, brief version
(WHOQOL-Bref) [27] and the approach developed by
Hwang and Wang [28]. The WHOQOL-Bref is a quality
of life assessment instrument which includes 24 facets
covering four domains and in addition, two facets related
to general health. The four domains relate to physical
health (pain, sleep, daily activities), psychological health
(self-image, negative thoughts, positive attitudes, self-
esteem, mentality, memory concentration), social health
(relationships, social support, sex life) and environmental
health (access to financial resources, safety, health services
and social services, the physical living environment, op-
portunities to acquire new skills and knowledge, recre-
ation). The 26 questions are rated on a five-point Likert
scale. The WHOQOL-Bref is a disease-independent, vali-
dated instrument for population studies [29]. It was suit-
able for this particular group of patients as it is culturally
sensitive [27] and has been validated in a Danish context,
including for psychiatric patients [30].
For each facet, the question scores for the domain
were summed up after reversing the score for the nega-
tively phrased questions (Q3, Q4 and Q26). The mean
score was then found and multiplied for each domain.
This process transformed the WHOQOL-Bref score into
a score directly comparable to that of the longer instru-
ment, WHOQOL100. The total score for quality of life
could then be created by summing the domain scores.
For the purpose of calculating QALYs, we assume that
the utility assigned to death is zero and that the survival
time is unaffected by the treatment, which is an ap-
proach used for chronic, non-fatal diseases [31]. It
means that Quality Adjusted Life Months (QALMs) can
be found though a trapezoidal approximation where,
QALM ¼ 0:5 � Q t0
ð Þ þ Q t1
ð Þ
ð
Þ � n1 þ 0:5 Q t1
ð Þ
ð
Þ � n2
The quality of life data was collected at n1 and n2,
which in this study corresponds to 9 and 23 months’
follow-up. To convert QALMs into QALYs, the result
was divided by 12.
Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)
The incremental gain in utility in this case is expressed
as compared to the baseline and used to find the Incre-
mental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of the treatment.
This ratio is then compared to an ICER threshold, typic-
ally defined in policy by a national public health body.
As Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries do
not operate with an explicit or implicit ICER threshold
[32], this study refers to the range proposed by the Na-
tional Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in
the UK, which suggests a most plausible ICER threshold
range of £20,000–30,000 [33], below which an interven-
tion can likely be considered cost-effective. Mathematic-
ally the ICER is defined as:
ICER ¼ C1−C0
E1−E0
Where C1 represents the cost of the intervention and
C0 is the cost of the comparator. E1 is the effect mea-
sured for the intervention and E0 correspondingly the ef-
fect of the comparator. In the present study, C1 is the
Bager et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:365 
Page 6 of 14
 treatment cost and E1 is the QALY as measured at
follow-up. C0 is zero as no comparator treatment was
available. Similarly, E0 is the baseline quality of life
measured, which is assumed to represent what would
have happened without treatment. As no comparison
group is available from the original study this calculation
therefore expresses the assumption that quality of life
would have remained constant over the period and that
no additional cost or savings are incurred in this no-
treatment alternative scenario.
Net social benefit (NSB)
The Net Social Benefit (NSB) is a measure quantify-
ing the net contribution to society of an intervention
or programme. To evaluate the net contribution of
the rehabilitation programme, the concept of the NSB
is used as the decision criterion on whether the inter-
vention is a good investment. The NSB is found by
subtracting social cost (C) from social benefits (B)
[34]. All cost and benefits are measured as a monet-
ary value;
NSB ¼ B−C
The benefits include income gained through employ-
ment (labour income), excluding any transfer payments.
Transfer payments refer to a transfer of surplus between
individuals or groups in society and is thus a matter of
distribution of existing resources [35]. That is, social
benefits provided by the Danish welfare system to the
patients in the study are not included in the analysis as
such transfer does not constitute an actual resource con-
sumption [26]. The cost includes the cost of treatment
and the cost of consumption of health care services in
the primary sector. To establish the net cost and benefit
associated with the treatment, the values for the control
group were subtracted from the treatment group. This
was done for each year and subsequently cumulatively,
over the 14-years to find the NSB for the study period.
The entire cost of treating 44 individuals was then as-
cribed to 2001 although in reality the treatment of those
individuals would have taken place over a few years. In
addition, to capture effects at the family level, the NSB
was recalculated replacing individual labour income with
data on family labour income. To make sure any differ-
ences in family labour income is not solely due to differ-
ences in family size, the age distribution in the two
groups was investigated.
Results
Cost analysis
The cost allocation has been illustrated below in Table 2,
showing fixed and variable cost. Treatment specific sal-
ary, that is, salary of the therapist and those directly
involved in the treatment of patients, amounts to just
over 5 million DKK. Non-salary fixed and variable cost
accounted for the remaining 4.5 million DKK. The ratio
of salary to overhead was 0.88. For every 1 kr. spent on
treatment in terms of direct salary expenses, another 0.
88 kr. was added to account for the general overhead.
Not all patients who received treatment at the clinic in
2001–02 were included in the study. Therefore the ac-
tual cost of the intervention does not equal that of the
above table. The number and type sessions the patients
in the study received were recorded and the total salary
expense of the treatment group calculated as shown in
Table 3. The total intervention cost was found by multi-
plying the direct salary related expenses with the ratio
established above of 0.88. The average cost of treating
an individual amounted to 166,112.6 kr. per patient
(2001 prices), which corresponds to the total interven-
tion cost divided by the number of patients in the study.
Cost-utility analysis
Table 4 summarises findings of the changes in QALY
from baseline to 9 and 23 months’ follow-up, as found
using the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. The instru-
ment demonstrated good internal consistency for both
baseline, 9 and 23 months’ follow-up with Crohnbach’s
alpha values of 0.931, 0.933 and 0.915 respectively. The
average gain in QALY per client was found to be 0.82,
with considerable variations observed in the four differ-
ent domains. The largest increase in QALY is seen in
the environmental domain with a gain of 1.16 while a
loss of 0.74 QALY per patient was observed in the social
domain.

Where 99.4 is the CPI for January 2016 and 76.7 is the
CPI for January 2001.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) in the UK has for over a decade referred expli-
citly to a range in which the ICER threshold could lie.
This threshold is between £20,000–£30,000 or roughly
190,000 kr. – 290,000 kr.1 It is noted that NICE has not
adjusted this range since it first published the guidelines
in the early 2000s. The result as shown above, re-
gardless of whether the treatment cost is displayed
in 2001 or 2016 prices, indicate that the treatment is
within, although in the upper region of what would
be considered cost-effective, using the NICE guide-
lines [33]. In several other countries, public bodies
or institutions have proposed ICER thresholds; In
the Netherlands, the council for Public Health and
Health Care has proposed a maximum ICER thresh-
old of €80,000, corresponding to roughly 595,000 kr.
per QALY gained [37].
Cost-benefit analysis
Balance of covariates
The CBA involved two groups, the treatment and con-
trol group, which were matched on 4 covariates (age,
gender, country of origin, time of arrival to Denmark).
The distributional balance of these were checked using

 no significant difference between the size and age distri-
bution in the families of the two groups.
Net social benefit (NSB)
Table 6 and Fig. 4 show the result from the analysis from
the individual client perspective as well as the family
perspective. The cost for both groups includes the costs
associated with utilisation of primary health care ser-
vices. For the patients from the original study, the treat-
ment group, the full treatment cost in January 2016
prices have been allocated the year 2001. The final col-
umn in the individual and family category respectively in
Table 6, displays the NSB over the period (cumulative).
Figure 4 compares the cumulative NSB for the two dif-
ferent levels in the analysis. The results show a marked
difference between the CBA taking the individual as a
starting point versus that for the family as whole. For
the individual level analysis, the curve that illustrates the
cumulative NSB has an upward trend towards break-
even. This is, however, never reached (the line never in-
tersects the x-axis) and the NSB remains negative
throughout the study period. A quite different picture is
observed when family rather than individual labour in-
come is plotted. From 2004 onwards, the NSB is positive
and although it displays the same reverse in trend, it is
far from being as pronounced as at the individual level.
The reason for this change in trend will be discussed
later.
Discussion and conclusion
The rehabilitation of survivors of torture is of great
importance, not only for the individuals concerned
but for the societies in which they are living. DIG-
NITY in Denmark is a clinic offering specialised
multidisciplinary rehabilitation for torture survivors.
In the process of evaluating and testing such pro-
grammes, not only information on efficacy but also
effectiveness is needed. This ‘value-for-money’ (VfM)
perspective is increasingly important in a health care
setting with limited resources, where decisions must
be made on what health interventions to provide.
This paper describes the procedure of two analyses to
assist such decisions on VfM.
Torture is a complex phenomenon, which affects so-
cial, economic, physical and mental dimensions of the
everyday lives of survivors and their families. In this
study, we employed a societal perspective, investigating
the cost-effectiveness and long-term economic benefits

 of providing multidisciplinary rehabilitation. The CUA
was calculated based on a group of 45 individuals who
had been in the rehabilitation programme in the period
2001–2004. The measured gain in QALYs showed that
the intervention was cost-effective within the upper limit
of the NICE ICER threshold, which is an internationally
recognised comparator of health care cost. As it is our
interest to elucidate changes in the relationship between
the survivor and society, we disaggregated the gain in
QALYs to each of the four domains (physical, mental,
social and environmental) measured by the WHOQOL-
Bref questionnaire and a more differentiated picture was
revealed (see Table 2). The outcome data for the CUA
covers roughly 23 months and the results for the psy-
chological and physical domain shows little change.
Considering the level of chronicity of the health prob-
lems survivors of torture and war experience, it is likely
that data collected over a relatively short period might
not reveal functional changes. The environmental do-
main on the other hand, showed a much larger increase
in QALYs than the other domains (1.16 as compared to
0.82 overall). This domain is of special interest to this
study as it provides information about the individuals
functioning in society. It is well-known that PTSD and
other symptoms are not static but can present them-
selves in recurrent relapses. Aggravation and escalation
of symptoms can occur as environmental stressors inter-
act with the trauma history [38–40]. The environmental
domain encompasses 8 questions covering topics ran-
ging from how safe the respondent feels in daily life
(Q8), the financial situation (Q12), the possibility of tak-
ing up leisure activities (Q14) and access to health care
services (Q25), among others [27]. The calculation of
the ICER for the environmental domain is shown separ-
ately below. As is demonstrated, the result is below the
suggested NICE threshold (190,000–290,000 kr.) of what
is to be considered cost-effective, specifically for the in-
tegration into a new environment.
ICERenvironmental ¼ 166; 112:56kr
1:16QALY
¼ 143; 200:5kr per QALY environmental
This is also the case in 2016 prices (185,500 kr. per
QALYenvironmental). While the environmental domain dis-
played a positive gain in QALYs, the result was quite dif-
ferent for the social domain. Disaggregated, the social
domain accounted for a 0.74 loss in quality of life, on
the surface indicating that the participants fare worse
after treatment. However, this effect may be partly due
to the qualities of the instrument. The WHOQOL-Bref
questionnaire has the most question in the environmen-
tal domain (8) and the fewest in the social domain (3).
Therefore, the changes in the score for the social do-
main makes this domain more sensitive to varying re-
sponses. Furthermore, the social domain covers the
respondent’s satisfaction with his or her personal life
(Q20), sex life (Q21) and support from friends (Q22)
[27]. While these questions represent important aspects
of well-being, the specific focus of this study was how
the treatment could potentially improve the study popu-
lation’s functioning in society, which is why we placed
emphasis on the environmental domain.
Fig. 4 Comparison of CBA for individual and family level

 We found very few studies in the literature that could
contextualise the results of the CUA and no study specific
to our population in a high-income setting; one study in
Australia found that trauma-focused cognitive behavioural
therapy (TF-CBT) in combination with sertraline was su-
perior to TF-CBT alone, non-directive counselling and the
non-treatment alternative for sexually-abused girls with
PTSD or PTSD and depression. The ICER the authors
found amounted to AU$22,263 (approx. 102,400 kr.) which
is well below the Australian ICER threshold of AU$50,000
(approx. 230,600 kr.) [41]. Similarly, in a study of US war
veterans with PTSD, prolonged exposure theory proved
more efficient than sertraline along with an ICER of [42].
For the CBA in the second stage of the study, we
included objective, long-term data that could reveal
the socio-economic outcomes for the study popula-
tion over a longer period. An interesting picture was
revealed, showing that the treatment never breaks-
even in the individual level analysis while a substan-
tial positive NSB is seen over the 14-year study
period, when taking the family as the unit of analysis
(see Fig. 4). Looking at the values for the NSB at
both the individual level and at the family level, a
trend is observed where the cumulative NSB over the
period first increases and then decreases. Several as-
pects need to be highlighted in this respect; the indi-
viduals in the treatment group performed better with
respect to individual income from 2001 to 2008.
However, after this point the income started to de-
crease again. A similar trend is observed for the con-
trols, though the decline from 2008 onwards is less
marked. The trend is repeated for family income
where the families of the treated individuals per-
formed better than the families of the controls except
for the years 2013 and 2014. The data on the ex-
penses related to primary health utilisation show a
mixed picture in which from 2006 onwards the ex-
penses of individuals in the treatment group display
an increasing trend while those of the controls re-
main relatively constant. As the study population is
small, it is difficult to say whether the increase in pri-
mary health care expenditure is due to a change in
health seeking behaviour induced by the rehabilitation
or if the treatment and control group were systemat-
ically different in health seeking behaviour from the
beginning.
Both individual and family income demonstrate that
2008 is a pivot point in terms of the overall trend
(Fig. 4). The results should be seen in the context of
the wider societal context and 2008 represent the onset of
the financial crisis that also impacted the Danish economy.
A study by Statistics Denmark for a larger sample of mi-
grants and refugees from some of the same countries (Iraq,
Afghanistan and Turkey) confirms the trend towards a peak
in 2008 [43]. In Statistics Denmark’s analysis, the declining
trend
in
employment
of
refugees
from
Iran
and
Afghanistan and economic migrants from Turkey is also
partly ascribed to the economic crisis. In such a situation,
the individuals in our study population, who are vulnerable
in various ways, might be particularly exposed to a contrac-
tion of the economy; at the onset of the financial crisis the
study population is on average 43 or 44 years old, they suf-
fer from health issues, generally have a low-skill level and
thus it is likely that they faced challenges in retaining their
job or finding jobs once the economic situation in
Denmark improved after the recession.
Sensitivity analysis
In the calculation of the ICER, the cost per gained
QALY amounted to 262,530 kr. in current prices. Of this
cost, 122,864 kr. was overhead related cost and the
remaining 139,666 kr. being the direct salary related
cost. There are two considerations in this composition
of this overall cost per QALY gained; One consideration
is the accuracy in the estimation of the overhead share
and the other being the difference in treatment compos-
ition, causing a variation in the salary component of the
treatment cost. There was a degree of uncertainty about
the overhead expenses as the evaluation was carried out
some years after the treatment programme, and infor-
mation about the organisational structure, inventory and
staff was no longer complete. Moreover, as the treatment
composition varied considerably, it is also worth consid-
ering whether the population included in the original
study can be assumed to have received a course of treat-
ment comparable to that of other patients in the clinic.
To test the decision uncertainty, both inputs to the over-
all treatment cost were varied by 20% in either direction.
This variation did not impact the conclusion in relation
to the reference ICER threshold obtained from NICE.
That is, the change did not move the established ICER
below the NICE ICER threshold lower boundary of
£20,000, or above the upper boundary of £30,000.
We also tested how the NSB would change if we
equalised the two groups’ health expenditure in the pri-
mary sector as well as the outcome for a scenario where
the financial crisis was assumed not to have happened.
Despite the treatment and control group showing differ-
ent trends, the actual magnitude of the primary health
care expenditure did not significantly alter the outcome
of the analysis either at individual level (NSB remained
negative) or at the family level (NSB remained positive).
However, under the assumption that the financial crisis
in 2008 was the sole responsibility of the change in the
income of the two groups, we kept the income level for
this year constant from 2008 to 2014, which was exactly
enough to reach break-even in 2014. Under this sce-
nario, the NSB at the individual level became positive.

 Does rehabilitation for traumatised refugees represent
‘value-for-money’?
The overarching goal of this analysis was to determine
whether the specific rehabilitation provided at RCT (now
DIGNITY) in 2001–2004 represents ‘value-for-money’.
This question was answered through a CUA, looking at
cost per QALY and a partial CBA that calculated the NSB,
based on individual and family income and primary health
care expenditure. The shorter-term focus of the CUA il-
lustrated the cost-effectiveness of the multidisciplinary
intervention at the individual level. The cost-effectiveness
of the intervention might be greater if the ability of the
intervention to support the study populations’ coping with
everyday life and integration into society is emphasised.
This is indicated by the disaggregated results for the envir-
onmental domain.
The partial CBA also indicated a positive effect; at
the family level, the productivity gains by family
members led to a positive NSB after only a couple
of years and this gain persisted over the course of
the study period. Therefore, based on the included
parameters, the multidisciplinary intervention pro-
vided at DIGNITY from 2001 to 2004 was shown
provide ‘value-for-money’ and to be an economically
sustainable strategy. The results also show that the
chosen study design can highlight important dynam-
ics otherwise not revealed; in this study, it was done
by taking a broader perspective, including multi-level
variables and transgenerational effects when evaluat-
ing multidisciplinary interventions for torture or war
survivors. By considering these parameters, the study
has contributed an alternative perspective to focus-
ing on symptoms. Many of the symptoms suffered
by torture survivors are chronic in nature [44–46],
so their persistence may not adequately represent
the change of functionality in society that the multi-
disciplinary rehabilitation provides.
Strengths, limitations and further research
There are several restrictions in the study that limit the
strength of the conclusions. The effectiveness study car-
ried out in 2001–2004, providing quality of life data to
the CUA, was designed as a pre- and post-treatment
study. Therefore, there is no control group and instead
the baseline was used as the comparator. It is uncertain
to what extent this baseline estimate represents an ac-
curate depiction of what would have happened in the ab-
sence of treatment. However, and referring again to the
long-term and persistent physical and mental health
consequences of war and torture, it might be reasonable
to presume that no significant improvement would have
happened in the absence of treatment over the 23-
month period and so the baseline data for quality of life
is a good approximation of the alternative.
Disaggregating the QALY into the different do-
mains helped us to gain more insight into the results
of the rehabilitation programme. However, whether
it is theoretically sound to do so is debateable.
Another point that has been criticised is the reliance
on an ICER threshold, as it might not adequately
represent
society’s
willingness
to
pay
for
the
programme. It has to be emphasised that the NICE
threshold is a politically defined threshold, grounded
in economic theory but not with an unproblematic
transfer to practice [37]. For this study, however, the
ICER threshold as suggested by NICE, was necessary
as no other cost-effectiveness analysis of an appro-
priate comparator treatment was available and as the
ICER threshold has not been defined in the Danish
context.
The CBA investigated socioeconomic outcomes for
the study group over a 14-year period (2001–14), using
data on individuals’ primary health care use, their labour
income and the families’ labour income obtained from
the Danish population registers. Other impact categories
could have been of relevance but was not possible to in-
clude in this study and therefore should the CBA be
regarded as a partial CBA. As this group suffer from ser-
ious mental health issues, memory bias is an important
concern when including self-reported data. Hence, the
use of long-term and objective register data is a key
strength of the study as it supports and further qualifies
the results measured at the clinical level. While the
long-term perspective in the partial CBA provides valu-
able insight into economic outcomes that cannot usually
be captured in shorter-term clinical follow-ups, this also
presents challenges to finding a suitable control group
which introduces a potential bias. To minimise this, it
was decided that enrolling the patients currently in
treatment or on the waiting list, represented the best
approximation with respect to the potential covariates.
Creating a sample from the general refugee population
would not have allowed us to match participants on
torture or war-related trauma exposure. The members
of both the treatment and control groups were all eli-
gible for DIGNITY rehabilitation, and had arrived in
Denmark at the same time. Nevertheless, the members
of the control group had accessed DIGNITY’s services
much later. The reason behind this difference is not
known, but it may be a difference between the two
groups that could result in bias. Members of the control
group could have had a different health seeking behav-
iour, or there may have been differences in the referral
system.
When evaluating the effect of health interventions we
often risk underestimating the true effect as a too nar-
row focus is employed [22]. The welfarist approach un-
derlies the CBA and several aspects have been criticised;
Bager et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:365 
Page 12 of 14
 Among others, it is based on a theoretical compensation
principle,
the
implicit
inclusion
of
income
in
the
decision-making process (with social willingness to pay)
and the central notion that health is valued in monetary
terms (see [47] for a discussion on these issues). The
concept of QALY is part of an effort to move towards
non-welfarist or extra-welfarist approaches and is in-
spired by Amartya Sen’s Capability approach focusing on
freedoms of ‘beings and doings’ [22, 47]. However, those
who advocate for a more holistic approach to evalua-
tions of health and social interventions argue that al-
though health is maximised in this perspective, QALY as
a concept has limited capacity to capture non-health and
functional changes especially for chronic patients [48].
This is a highly valid point also in the light of the com-
plex intervention evaluated here as well as the chronic
nature of the symptoms the patients in this study experi-
ence. At this point, nonetheless, no adequately tested in-
strument is available or was not available at the time the
clinical data was recorded.
Yet, in this study we have attempted to address the chal-
lenges by including a range of variables and approached
the ‘value-for-money’ perspective from two angles, using
both self-reported, short-term and clinical data in combin-
ation with longer-term objective data on socioeconomic
outcomes. Separately, the CUA and partial CBA show that
the intervention is a sound economic strategy. Yet, the
strength of the study is the combination of methods, data-
sources and time perspective, which underline the conclu-
sion: Rehabilitating severely traumatised refugees can gen-
erate economic benefits, not only to the individuals but
also their families and society. Future research should take
steps to include a larger sample size and more variables
for a full CBA, such as data on hospital care and expenses
related to social services or crime. Furthermore, as time
passes the possibility to obtain more detailed socioeco-
nomic information from the population registers on chil-
dren of traumatised refugees becomes possible, allowing
for an expansion of the analyses of intergenerational ef-
fects of trauma.
