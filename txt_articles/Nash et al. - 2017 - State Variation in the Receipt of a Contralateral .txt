IMPORTANCE The use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPMs) among patients
with invasive unilateral breast cancer has increased substantially during the past decade in
the United States despite the lack of evidence for survival benefit. However, whether this
trend varies by state or whether it is correlated with changes in proportions of reconstructive
surgery among these patients is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To determine state variation in the temporal trend and in the proportion of CPMs
among women with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study of 1.2 million women 20
years of age or older diagnosed with invasive unilateral early-stage breast cancer and treated
with surgery from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2012, in 45 states and the District
of Columbia as compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.
Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to August 31, 2016.
EXPOSURE Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Temporal changes in the proportion of CPMs among
women with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery by age and state, overall
and in relation to changes in the proportions of those who underwent reconstructive surgery.
RESULTS Among the 1 224 947 women with early-stage breast cancer treated with surgery, the
proportion who underwent a CPM nationally increased between 2004 and 2012 from 3.6%
(4013 of 113 001) to 10.4% (12 890 of 124 231) for those 45 years or older and from 10.5% (1879
of 17 862) to 33.3% (5237 of 15 745) for those aged 20 to 44 years. The increase was evident in
all states, although the magnitude of the increase varied substantially across states. For
example, among women 20 to 44 years of age, the proportion who underwent a CPM from
2004-2006 to 2010-2012 increased from 14.9% (317 of 2121) to 24.8% (436 of 1755)
(prevalence ratio [PR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46-1.89) in New Jersey compared with an increase from
9.8% (162 of 1657) to 32.2% (495 of 1538) (PR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.80-3.88) in Virginia. In this age
group, CPM proportions for the period from 2010 to 2012 were over 42% in the contiguous
states of Nebraska, Missouri, Colorado, Iowa, and South Dakota. From 2004 to 2012, the
proportion of reconstructive surgical procedures among women aged 20 to 44 years who were
diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and received a CPM increased in many states;
however, it did not correlate with the proportion of women who received a CPM.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The increase in the proportion of CPMs among women with
early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery varied substantially across states.
Notably, in 5 contiguous Midwest states, nearly half of young women with invasive
early-stage breast cancer underwent a CPM from 2010 to 2012. Future studies should
examine the reasons for the geographic variation and increasing trend in the use of CPMs.

marked increase in the use of contralateral prophylactic mas-
tectomies (CPMs) for women who receive a diagnosis of early-
stage unilateral breast cancer, particularly for patients younger
than 45 years of age,2-4 despite a lack of evidence for survival
benefit.5-9 The reasons for this increasing pattern are unclear
butarethoughttoincludethefearofdevelopingasecondbreast
cancer and the desire for breast symmetry following recon-
structive surgery.10-12
Two previous studies based on the Surveillance, Epide-
miology, and End Results (SEER) database13 and the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB)2 reported regional variation in the
proportions of CPMs. However, these studies were limited be-
cause the SEER database (a population-based cancer regis-
try) covers only 28% of the US population14 and because the
NCDB(ahospital-basedcancerregistry)coverageinsomestates
(eg, 27% in Arizona) is too low to provide representative state-
specific estimates.15,16
We examined temporal trends by state and age in the pro-
portion of patients who received CPMs among women diag-
nosed with invasive unilateral early-stage breast cancer and
treated with surgery from 2004 through 2012. We used na-
tionwide population-based incidence data as collected by the
SEER program and the National Program of Cancer Registries
and compiled by the North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries (NAACCR).17 Using these data, we also ex-
amined whether the temporal changes in the proportion of
women receiving a CPM by state were correlated with changes
in the proportion of women undergoing reconstructive sur-
gery following a CPM.
Methods
Data Source and Variables
Demographic and clinical information for women 20 years of
age or older who received a diagnosis of primary invasive uni-
lateral breast cancer between January 1, 2004, and December
31, 2012 (n = 1 404 411), was obtained from the NAACCR data-
base for the District of Columbia and all states except for the
nonconsenting states of Illinois, Maryland, and Vermont and
owing to a lack of readily available data in Kansas and Minne-
sota. This project was reviewed and approved by the NAACCR
institutionalreviewboardandwasexemptfrominformedcon-
sent of individual study participants because it used only de-
identified patient data.

categorized as local or regional according to the 2000 SEER

Tumor size was grouped into 3 categories: less than 2 cm,
2 to 4.9 cm, and 5 to 20 cm; cases with a likely erroneously re-
cordedtumorsizeofmorethan20cm(n = 1262)wereclassified

nosis was categorized in 10-year age groups to compare CPMs
with other surgical procedures at the national level. To inves-
tigate CPM trends temporally and geographically, age at diag-
nosis was collapsed into 2 categories: 20 to 44 years of age and
45 years of age or older, with a particular emphasis on women
20 to 44 years of age, for whom a CPM is more common.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to
August 31, 2016. For each state, we calculated the proportion of
patients undergoing a CPM among all women with early-stage
unilateralbreastcancertreatedwithsurgery(BCS,UM,orCPM)

Toshowchangesinthetemporaltrendovertimeforeachofthe
2 age groups (20-44 and ≥45 years), we used a joinpoint model,
with a maximum of 1 joinpoint allowed. A log-transformed
model was used to approximate a fixed annual percent change
(APC) to account for the skewed distribution over time. In this
method, the APC is calculated by fitting a least-squares regres-
sion line to the natural logarithm of the proportion, using year
of diagnosis as the regressor variable.21 In the presence of a sig-
nificant joinpoint, 2 values for APC were calculated, preceding
and following the identified joinpoint.
Key Points
Question Does the proportion of contralateral prophylactic
mastectomies vary by state?
Findings In this cohort study of more than 1.2 million women who
received a diagnosis of invasive unilateral early-stage breast cancer
treated with surgery, the proportion of contralateral prophylactic
mastectomies varied substantially by state. The proportion among
women 20 to 44 years of age during the period from 2010 to 2012
ranged from 15.7% in Hawaii to 42.8% to 48.5% in 5 contiguous
Midwestern states.
Meaning Patients should be educated about the benefit and harm
of a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy for informed decision
making.

 Multivariable analysis was conducted using binary logis-
tic regression, in which the outcome variable was CPM vs other
surgery (UM or BCS). A second logistic regression model was
fitted restricted only to patients who underwent a mastec-
tomy (CPM vs UM). For both of these analyses, a single model
was fit to the data, and the results were reported as odds ra-
tios adjusted for the effect of the other covariates and 95% CIs.
StatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingSAS,version9.4(SAS
InstituteInc),andjoinpointanalysiswasperformedusingJoin-
point Regression Program, version 4.2.0.2 (NCI). P = .05 (2-
tailed) was considered significant.
We also examined state-specific trends in reconstructive
surgery by age (20-44 years and ≥45 years) and year of diag-
nosis for women who underwent a CPM or a UM. We corre-
lated the proportion of CPMs among women 20 to 44 years of
age with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with sur-
gery during the most recent period (2010-2012) with the pro-
portion of reconstructive surgical procedures among women
who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and re-
ceived a CPM by state, as well as the relative percent change
in the proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage uni-
lateral breast cancer treated with surgery between 2004-
2006 and 2010-2012 with the corresponding relative percent
change in reconstructive surgery, using the Pearson correla-
tion coefficient. We repeated these correlation analyses with
proportions of reconstructive surgical procedures among
womenwhowerediagnosedwithearly-stagebreastcancerand
received a mastectomy (either a UM or a CPM).
Results
Of1224947patientswithunilateralearly-stagebreastcancerwho
underwent surgery between 2004 and 2012 and met the inclu-
sioncriteria,715914(58.4%)hadBCS,402434(32.9%)hadaUM,
and 106 599 (8.7%) had a CPM (Table 1). Nationally, the propor-
tionofpatientsundergoingaCPMmonotonicallyincreasedwith
younger age from 2.4% (7891 of 330 698) for those 70 years or
olderto29.3%(1896of6464)forthose20to29yearsofageand
with later years of diagnosis from 5.1% (20 037 of 391 393) in
2004-2006 to 11.9% (49 592 of 416 030) in 2010-2012.
Multivariable analysis also showed that the odds of under-
goingaCPMcomparedwithothersurgery(BCSorUM)weresig-
nificantly higher for younger patients (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). In binary logistic regression, the odds of undergoing a
CPMcomparedwithothersurgeryrangedfrom2.5(95%CI,2.5-
2.6) for patients 60 to 69 years of age to 18.6 (95% CI, 17.4-19.8)
forpatients20to29yearsofagecomparedwithpatients70years
of age or older. In addition, the odds of undergoing a CPM com-
pared with other surgical procedures were significantly higher
for patients who received a diagnosis of node-positive regional
stage disease than for patients who received a diagnosis of lo-
cal stage disease and were higher for patients with lobular car-
cinoma than for patients with ductal carcinoma, as well as for
white vs nonwhite patients and for privately insured vs unin-
sured or non–privately insured patients. In contrast, in analy-
ses restricted to patients receiving a mastectomy, the odds of
undergoing a CPM compared with a UM were lower for pa-
tients who received a diagnosis of regional stage disease than
for patients who received a diagnosis of local stage disease and
were lower for patients with large tumors (≥2 cm) than for pa-
tients with small tumors (<2 cm) (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Figure 1 depicts the proportion of CPMs among women
with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery
byeachyearofdiagnosisfrom2004to2012forallpatients(≥20
years) and for the collapsed age categories (20-44 and ≥45
years) nationally. The proportion nationally increased be-
tween 2004 and 2012 from 3.6% (4013 of 113 001) to 10.4%
(12 890 of 124 231) for those 45 years or older and from 10.5%
(1879 of 17 862) to 33.3% (5237 of 1574) for those aged 20 to 44
years.Joinpointanalysisofthetemporaltrendshowedthatthe
proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage unilat-
eral breast cancer treated with surgery significantly in-
creased by an APC of 22% per year from 2004 through 2008
and by 11% per year from 2008 through 2012 for women 20 to
44 years of age (P < .05). Similarly, APCs preceding and fol-
lowing the 2008 joinpoint in women 45 years of age or older
were 22% and 10%, respectively (P < .05) (eFigure in the
Supplement).
The proportions of CPMs among women 20 to 44 years of
age with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with sur-
gery by state and year of diagnosis are presented in Table 2
(eTable 2 in the Supplement contains data from 2007 to 2009).
From2004-2006to2010-2012,theproportionofCPMsamong
women with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated
with surgery significantly increased in every state except
Wyoming, with the magnitude of the increase varying by state.
For example, between 2004-2006 and 2010-2012, the pro-
portion of CPMs among women with early-stage unilateral
breast cancer treated with surgery increased by about 3-fold
inVirginia(PR,3.29;95%CI,2.80-3.88)andKentucky(PR,3.03;
95% CI, 2.51-3.66), while it increased less than 2-fold in
several states, such as New Jersey (PR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46-
1.89). During the most recent time period (2010-2012), the pro-
portion of CPMs among women with early-stage unilateral
breastcancertreatedwithsurgerysubstantiallyvariedbystate,
from about 15% in Hawaii and the District of Columbia to
greater than 42% in South Dakota, Iowa, Colorado, Missouri,
and Nebraska (Table 2 and Figure 2). South Dakota also regis-
tered the highest proportion of women who underwent a CPM
during the period from 2004 to 2006 (29.9% [41 of 137]), and
West Virginia (6.0% [19 of 319]) and Utah (5.8% [21 of 364]) reg-
istered the lowest proportions.
The corresponding proportions of CPMs among women 45
years or older with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated
with surgery are presented in eTable 3 in the Supplement and
Figure 2. Similar to the results seen among the younger age
group, the proportion of CPMs among women 45 years or older
with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery
significantly increased from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012 in all
states except the District of Columbia, where the proportion
of CPMs among women 45 years or older with early-stage uni-
lateral breast cancer treated with surgery remained un-
changed (2004-2006, 3.3% [25 of 759]; 2010-2012, 3.2% [26
of 810]). Prevalence ratios ranged from about 1.7 in South
Dakota and Colorado to greater than 3.5 in Missouri, West

 Nationally, the proportion of reconstructive surgical pro-
cedures among patients 20 years of age or older with early-
stageunilateralbreastcancerfrom2004to2012increasedfrom
11.6% (5618 of 48 289) to 21.5% (8741 of 40 595) among pa-

common among younger than older patients for both CPM and
UM. In 2012, 37.4% of patients 20 to 44 years of age with a UM
(1776 of 4748) and 66.8% with a CPM (3499 of 5237) had re-
constructive surgery. The corresponding proportions of pa-
tients 45 years of age or older were 19.4% (6965 of 35 847) and
49.9% (6431 of 12 890), respectively.
Theproportionofreconstructivesurgicalproceduresamong
those 20 to 44 years of age who received a CPM from 2004-
2006 to 2010-2012 significantly increased in more than half of
the states (26 of 45), with the magnitude of the relative in-
crease ranging from 18% in Florida (PR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.30)
to a 2-fold increase in Virginia (PR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.63-2.47)
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). During the most recent time pe-
riod(2010-2012),theproportionofreconstructivesurgicalpro-
cedures among patients 20 to 44 years of age who received a
CPM ranged from 30.0% (54 of 180) in Oklahoma to 82.1% (252
of 307) in Massachusetts (Figure 3 and eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment). Similarly, among patients 45 years of age or older who
received a CPM, the proportion of reconstructive surgical pro-
cedures significantly increased in two-thirds of the states, and
during the most recent time period, the proportion varied from
20.4% (109 of 534) in Oklahoma to 66.9% (599 of 895) in New
Jersey (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Receipt of reconstructive
surgery among patients who received a CPM and use of CPMs
by state were not correlated cross-sectionally (r = 0.19; P = .21)
or temporally (r = –0.09; P = .57).
The proportion of reconstructive surgical procedures also
increased among patients who received a UM during the study
period in most states. During the most recent time period
(2010-2012), the proportion of reconstructive surgical proce-
dures among women 20 to 44 years of age receiving a UM
ranged from less than 20% in Washington, Oklahoma, New
Mexico, and Hawaii to 66% in Massachusetts (eTable 7 in the
Supplement). Among women 45 years of age or older receiv-
ing a UM, the proportion of reconstructive surgical proce-
drues ranged from about 7% in Alaska (7.2% [19 of 265]), Idaho
(6.4% [35 of 548]), and Oklahoma (6.8% [108 of 1592]) to 35.9%
(806 of 2243) in Massachusetts. The proportion of reconstruc-
tive surgical procedures among patients 20 to 44 years of age
who underwent either a UM or a CPM during the period from
2010 to 2012 was correlated with CPM proportions (r = 0.42;
P = .005), but the changes in CPM proportions from 2004-
2006 to 2010-2012 were not correlated with the correspond-
ingchangesinreconstructionproportionsamongpatientswho
underwent a mastectomy (r = 0.06; P = .68).
Discussion
Using a nationwide population-based cancer database, we
found that the proportion of CPMs among patients 20 years
or older with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with
surgery significantly increased from 2004 to 2012 in almost
all states, with the absolute proportions substantially higher
amongpatients20to44yearsofagethanamongthose45years
of age or older and in some Midwestern and Southern states
than in Western and Northeastern states. In 5 contiguous Mid-
western states (South Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, and
Missouri),nearlyhalfoftheyoungwomenwhounderwentsur-
gery for early-stage unilateral breast cancer during the period
from 2010 to 2012 underwent a CPM.
Factors associated with receipt of a CPM that may contrib-
ute to variations by state in the proportion of women who un-
derwent a CPM include regional differences in distribution of
white race, high socioeconomic status, testing for high-risk
genetic mutations, reconstructive surgery for breast symme-
try,useofmagneticresonanceimaging(MRI),andfearandanxi-
ety surrounding a diagnosis of breast cancer.12,22-27 However,
we found no association between the temporal increases in

 reconstruction. Interestingly, the highest proportions of young
women undergoing reconstructive surgery among young
women who had a CPM were geographically clustered in sev-
eral Northeastern states (Massachusetts, Maine, New Jersey,
Connecticut, New York, and Delaware) rather than in the Mid-
western region where we observed the highest proportions of
women who underwent a CPM, although high proportions of

tioned Northeastern states also showed the highest propor-
tions of reconstructive surgical procedures among those who

 hospitals and lowest in community hospitals, suggesting that
therewasatransitioninsurgicaltreatmentbyfacilitytype.How-
ever, teaching hospitals comprise only about 20% of the hos-
pitals reporting to the NCDB and contribute only about 35% of
the cases.15 Furthermore, our findings do not suggest that state
variation in the proportion of women who underwent a CPM
reflectsgeographicaldifferencesinthedistributionofhealthcare
facilities. We found high proportions of CPMs among women
with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery
in both states with mostly community hospitals (eg, South Da-
kota) and states with many teaching hospitals (eg, Connecti-
cut). We also found lower-than-average proportions of CPMs
amongwomenwithearly-stageunilateralbreastcancertreated
with surgery in both states with many teaching hospitals (eg,
Massachusetts and New York) and in states with very few (eg,
Hawaii, Idaho, and Wyoming).
Limitations
To our knowledge, our study is the first to show state-level
variationbasedonpopulation-baseddataandhighlightsacon-
tiguous region of states that have substantially higher-than-
average proportions of CPMs among women with early-stage
unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery. However, a no-
table limitation of our study is its ecological nature and the lack
of individual patient-level or clinician-level data, as well as the
lackofhealthsystemdatatoexaminereasonsforthelargestate
variations in the use of a CPM. Studies have shown that fam-
ily history, high-risk genetic testing regardless of result, and
socioeconomic status are individually associated with receiv-
ing a CPM10,22,48,49; however, our study lacked data on these
variables. Also lacking in our analytical database were impor-
tant clinical indicators affecting surgical decisions, such as
mammographic patterns of diffuse microcalcifications, pres-
ence of multiple tumors, and failed lumpectomy attempts.
Studiesexaminingdecisionaidshavesuggestedthatamas-

ingphysician-leddecisionsweremorelikelytoundergoBCS.50,56
However, variability in physician practices and approaches to
decision making with their patients cannot be captured in a
study of this nature. Recently, the American Society of Breast
Surgeons issued a consensus statement that women with uni-
lateral disease at average risk should be discouraged from un-
dergoing a CPM.57,58 Future studies could examine the effect of
this consensus on halting or reversing the rising proportions of
CPMsintheUnitedStates,especiallyinsomeMidwesternstates
with the highest proportions.
Conclusions
Using a nationwide population-based database, we found sub-
stantial geographical variation in the receipt of a CPM among
US women with unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery,
with nearly 1 in 2 patients 20 to 44 years of age during the pe-
riod from 2010 to 2012 receiving a CPM in 5 contiguous Mid-
western states. This regional variation was partly explained by
statevariationsinreconstructivesurgicalproceduresamongall
women with a mastectomy but not among women who under-
went a CPM. Future studies should examine patient-level, cli-
nician-level, and health system–level factors to provide addi-
tionalinsightintothereasonsfortemporalchangesandregional
variationinthereceiptofaCPM.Inthemeantime,however,sur-
geons and other health care professionals should educate their
patients about the benefit, harm, and cost of a CPM to help pa-
tients make informed decisions about their treatments.

Do Patterns of Breast Cancer Surgical Care Reflect
National Voting Records?
Lisa A. Newman, MD, MPH
The Midwest is oftenreferred to as America’s heartland, and
is home of the so-called bellwether states whose voting pat-
ternshaveconsistentlypredictedtheoutcomefornationalelec-
tions. Patients with breast cancer and breast cancer surgeons
are also voters, and it is therefore reasonable to question
whether these political pat-
terns can be generalized to
oncology practice patterns. If
so, then the study by Nash et al1 in this issue of JAMA Surgery
indicates that we have not yet seen a peak in the rising rates
ofcontralateralprophylacticmastectomy(CPM)thathavebeen
observed among patients in the United States with unilateral
breast cancer.
Similar to reports from a variety of data sets,2-4 Nash et al1
demonstrated that rates of CPM have risen substantially dur-
ing the past 20 years, despite statistics revealing that the more
extensive surgery is associated with higher rates of complica-
tions; it does not generate a survival advantage, and, with re-
gard to preventing new metachronous primary breast can-
cers, the procedure reduces but does not eliminate risk.5 A
distinctive feature of the Nash et al1 North American Associa-
tion of Central Cancer Registries data set, however, is the
broadly representative reporting for 45 states and the District
of Columbia. Five geographically contiguous Midwest states
were found to have the highest rates of CPM among patients
aged 20 to 44 years with breast cancer, resulting in nearly half
of this subset choosing CPM during the latter part of the study
timeframe (2010-2012).
Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy should be a con-
sideration only among patients who are ineligible for, or un-
willing to accept, breast-conserving surgery for the biopsy-
provenunilateralcancer.Nashetal1cannotaccountformedical
contraindications to breast-conserving surgery such as failed
prior lumpectomies or diffuse microcalcifications, but there
is no reason to expect either overall increases or geographical
variation in the prevalence of these contraindications. Sev-
eral studies have shown that white American identity and af-
fluence are associated with decisions to undergo CPM. Inter-
estingly, 4 of the 5 Midwestern states with the highest rates
of CPM have African American populations no larger than 5%
and poverty rates below the 14% national rate.6,7
Choices regarding breast cancer surgery—much like cast-
ingaballot—canbeintenselypersonaldecisions,basedonone’
s
lifetime experiences and exposures, as well as values and re-
sources. Patients and voters alike deserve accurate informa-
tion regarding realistic expectations from their options. The re-
sponsible journalist strives to protect the public from hollow
promises by politicians that are all too easily made in the heat
of election campaigns. It is an ethical and moral imperative for
the responsible surgeon to insure that patients with breast can-
cerarewellinformedregardingtreatmentchoicesthataremedi-
cally safe and that prioritize optimal oncologic outcomes. We
must respect patient choice and avoid being paternalistic, but
we must also protect our patients from making impulsive sur-
gical decisions when they are freshly encumbered by the panic
accompanying a new diagnosis of breast cancer.
