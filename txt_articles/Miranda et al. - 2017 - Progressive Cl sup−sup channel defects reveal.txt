I n t R o d u c t I o n
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal degenerative disor-
der caused by an expanded CAG repeat sequence at the 
5′ end of the Huntingtin gene (MacDonald et al., 1993). 
The characteristic motor and cognitive symptoms prog-
ress in severity over the time course of the disease (Bates 
et al., 2002). At the early stage of HD, the motor symp-
toms include minor motor abnormalities such as fidget-
ing and restlessness. By the middle stage, patients exhibit 
symptoms including chorea, bradykinesia, dystonia, and 
muscle rigidity. By the late stage, the choreic symptoms 
subside and the bradykinesia, dystonia, and rigidity can 
become debilitating (Bates et al., 2002). Although the 
cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of HD are likely 
caused by degeneration of the striatum and cortex, the 
motor symptoms may be caused by cell-autonomous ef-
fects of the mutant Huntingtin gene in skeletal muscle.
There is a growing body of evidence showing skeletal 
muscle pathology in HD, including metabolic and mito-
chondrial defects (Lodi et al., 2000; Turner et al., 2007), 
molecular changes leading to atrophy (She et al., 2011; 
Ehrnhoefer et al., 2014), and loss of strength (Busse et 
al., 2008). Muscle-specific changes in HD gene expres-
sion include decreased expression of actin, myosin light 
chain, and troponin, which are important for muscle 
differentiation (Luthi-Carter et al., 2002; Strand et al., 
2005). Interestingly, the onset of skeletal muscle abnor-
malities in HD may precede neurodegeneration and, in 
part, cause motor symptoms, as shown by the marathon 
runner who exhibited HD motor symptoms well before 
any neurological symptoms (Kosinski et al., 2007).
Previously, we discovered that muscle chloride chan-
nel (ClC-1) and inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) 
channel currents were reduced in skeletal muscle 
from the transgenic R6/2 mouse model for HD near 
Huntington’s disease (HD) patients suffer from progressive and debilitating motor dysfunction. Previously, we 
discovered reduced skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1) currents, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) chan-
nel currents, and membrane capacitance in R6/2 transgenic HD mice. The ClC-1 loss-of-function correlated 
with increased aberrant mRNA processing and decreased levels of full-length ClC-1 mRNA (Clcn1 gene). Phys-
iologically, the resulting muscle hyperexcitability may help explain involuntary contractions of HD. In this study, 
the onset and progression of these defects are investigated in R6/2 mice, ranging from 3 wk old (presymptom-
atic) to 9–13 wk old (late-stage disease), and compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) siblings. The R6/2 
ClC-1 current density and level of aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA remain constant with age. In contrast, the 
ClC-1 current density increases, and the level of aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA decreases with age in WT 
mice. The R6/2 ClC-1 properties diverge from WT before the onset of motor symptoms, which occurs at 5 wk 
of age. The relative decrease in R6/2 muscle capacitance also begins in 5-wk-old mice and is independent of 
fiber atrophy. Kir current density is consistently lower in R6/2 compared with WT muscle. The invariable R6/2 
ClC-1 properties suggest a disruption in muscle maturation, which we confirm by measuring elevated levels of 
neonatal myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in late-stage R6/2 skeletal muscle. Similar changes in ClC-1 and MyHC 
isoforms in the more slowly developing Q175 HD mice suggest an altered maturational state is relevant to 
adult-onset HD. Finally, we find nuclear aggregates of muscleblind-like protein 1 without predominant CAG 
repeat colocalization in R6/2 muscle. This is unlike myotonic dystrophy, another trinucleotide repeat disorder 
with similar ClC-1 defects, and suggests a novel mechanism of aberrant mRNA splicing in HD. These early and 
progressive skeletal muscle defects reveal much needed peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and 
better elucidate the mechanism underlying HD myopathy.

 Disrupted muscle maturation in Huntington’s disease | Miranda et al.
56
the terminal stage of the disease (∼12 wk of age) com-
pared with age-matched WT siblings (Waters et al., 
2013). These reductions correlated with decreased 
levels of full-length mRNA for both ClC-1 (Clcn1) and 
Kir (Kcnj2) ion channels as well as aberrant splicing 
of Clcn1 mRNA. Additionally, the specific membrane 
capacitance (Cm) of R6/2 muscle fibers was reduced 
compared with WT. The reduced chloride currents 
and aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA in R6/2 fibers 
were similar to reported mechanisms in myotonic dys-
trophy, type 1, in which ClC-1 down-regulation has 
been linked to the sequestration of mRNA binding 
proteins such as muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1; 
Mankodi et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2006). The reduced 
chloride and Kir currents (IClC-1 and IKir) cause muscle 
hyperexcitability and could underlie the myotonic 
symptoms of HD such as dystonia, rigidity, and brady-
kinesia. Because our previous work was performed 
only on severely symptomatic R6/2 mice at the end of 
the disease, the onset and progression of ClC-1 and 
Kir defects and their relationship to disease were un-
known. In this study, we determined the time course 
over which the following R6/2 muscle defects develop, 
reduced IClC-1 and IKir, lower Cm, decreased full-length 
Clcn1 and Kcnj2 mRNA, and increased aberrantly 
spliced Clcn1 mRNA.

Ethical approval
All animal procedures were performed in accordance 
with the policies of the Animal Care and Use Commit-
tees of the California State Polytechnic University, Po-
mona and Wright State University.
Animal husbandry
Each breeding pair consisted of one WT female with an 
ovarian transplant containing the mutated Huntingtin 
gene (stock# 002810) and one WT male (B6CBAF1/J) 
from the Jackson Laboratory. Six breeding pairs pro-
duced a total of 41 HD (R6/2) mice and 50 WT mice. 
Q175 mice were provided by R. Cachope of the Cure 
Huntington’s Disease Initiative (CHDI, New York, NY). 
Environmental conditions were maintained with a 12-h 
light/dark cycle and constant temperature (21–23°C) 
and humidity (55 ± 10%). The cages contained sani-
chip bedding (product 7090; Envigo) and environmen-
tal enrichment (mouse house and cotton nestlet). Mice 
were supplied with dry chow (irradiated rodent diet; 
Harlan Teklad 2018) and water ad libitum. At 10 wk of 
age, the R6/2 mice were supplied with supplemental 
food and water in the form of Hydrogel and mash (dry 
chow moistened until paste-like in consistency) in a 
Petri dish placed on the cage floor. Cages were changed 
every 1 wk or as needed.
Mouse monitoring and behavioral assessment
The physical condition of the mice was assessed weekly 
in mice <10 wk of age and daily in mice ≥10 wk of age. 
Assessment categories were physical condition, approx-
imate respiratory rate, activity level, consumption of 
water and food, body mass loss, and hind limb clasping. 
Each category was rated on a scale of 0–3, with 0 mark-
ing normal condition and 3 representing extremely 
poor condition. Mice were euthanized (and used for 
experimentation) if the sum of the first five category 
scores was greater than or equal to 6 or if the score of 
any individual category was equal to 3, which in all cases 
occurred during late stage.
Video-based home cage activity data were analyzed 
using HomeCageScan 3.0; behavioral definitions were 
as described previously (Steele et al., 2007). Mice were 
single housed and habituated to standard microisolater 
cages for 24 h and then video recorded for an addi-
tional 24 h. The percentage of time spent hanging, 
jumping, rearing, or walking was calculated by dividing 
the sum (in seconds) of each of these behaviors by the 
sum of all scored behaviors (only one behavior can be 
assigned at any given time).
Electrophysiology
Mice were euthanized by inhalation of a 2-g/liter dose 
of isoflurane for at least 1 min, followed by cervical 
dislocation. Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and inter-
osseous (IO) muscle fibers were removed, pinned to 
Sylgard-bottomed Petri dishes, and enzymatically dis-
sociated at 35–36°C under mild agitation for ∼1 h 
using 1,000 U/ml of collagenase type IV (Worthing-
ton Biochemical). Collagenase was dissolved in the 
extracellular solution (below). Dissociation was com-
pleted using mild trituration in extracellular solution 
with no collagenase. The fibers were allowed to re-
cover at 21–23°C for 1 h before electrical measurements 
 
were recorded.
Fibers were visualized in a BX51WI or IX71 micro-
scope (Olympus), and images were acquired with a 
CCD camera (ST-7XMEI-C1 or STF8300M; Santa Bar-
bara Instruments). The BX51WI microscope was 
equipped with 10× (UMP 
LFLN10XW) and 40× (LUM 
PLF 
LN40XW) objectives; 20× images were obtained 
with a 2× intermediate magnification changer. The 
IX71 microscope was equipped with 10× (UPlanFLN) 
and 20× (UPlanFLN) objectives. ImageJ (National Insti-
tutes of Health) and SigmaPlot13 (Systat) were used to 
determine the fiber surface area assuming a cylindrical 
shape. The mean fiber length (l) was obtained from at 
least two measurements of length near each edge and 
one measurement from the middle of the fiber. Because 
a two-dimensional image of a cylinder is a rectangle, r 
was obtained from the equation, r = (two-dimensional 
surface area)/(2l). This provided a more reliable 
method of estimating r than measuring the diameter of 
 57

the fiber at numerous points along its length. The equa-
tion for a cylinder was used to estimate the three-dimen-
sional fiber surface area (surface area = 2πrl + 2πr2).
Electrical properties were measured under standard 
current and voltage-clamp conditions at 21–23°C using 
two borosilicate intracellular microelectrodes with a 
1.5-mm outside diameter and 0.86-mm inside diame-
ter (Sutter Instrument), an Axoclamp 900A amplifier, 
a Digidata 1550 digitizer, and pCLA 
MP 10 data acqui-
sition and analysis software (Molecular Devices). The 
Axoclamp 900A was equipped with a virtual-ground 
headstage (VG-9Ax100). Reference electrodes were 
placed in separate cups containing 3 M KCl and con-
nected to the extracellular fluid via agar bridges. Elec-
trodes were impaled ∼50 µm apart from each other, or 
roughly within the diameter of the fiber. The voltage- 
sensing electrode was connected with an Axoclamp 
HSx1 headstage. The current-passing electrode was 
connected with an Axoclamp HSx10 headstage that 
was modified to have a 2-MΩ output resistor (HSx5). 
Both the current-passing and voltage-sensing elec-
trodes were filled with the same internal solution 
(below). The electrode resistance was between 4 and 
16 MΩ. After impalement, 20 min was given for equili-
bration of the electrode solution with the sarcoplasm 
before data acquisition. A high concentration of EGTA 
was used in the internal solutions to prevent contrac-
tions. Data were acquired at 100 kHz. Current and 
voltage records were low-pass filtered with the internal 
Axoclamp 900A filters at 2 kHz. The voltage-clamp 
command signal was low-pass filtered with an external 
Warner LFP-8 at 2 kHz.
Fiber capacitance and leak conductance were ob-
tained under voltage-clamp conditions in the same fi-
bers used to determine the chloride and potassium 
currents, as described previously (Waters et al., 2013). 
To minimize errors caused by voltage-activated chan-
nels, measurements were made at the end of the exper-
iments after the major Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− channels 
were blocked with tetrodotoxin, Cs+ substitution, nifed-
ipine, and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9AC), respec-
tively. Fiber capacitance was measured by integrating 
the capacitive transients from an equal number of posi-
tive and negative 20-ms voltage steps from the holding 
potential. The leak conductance was obtained from the 
same voltage jumps by determining the slope of the 
steady-state current-voltage relationship. Leak conduc-
tances were normalized to the fiber capacitance.
For data analysis, healthy fibers were chosen based on 
equilibrium potential and leak conductance. Fibers 
with a measured reversal potential of ±5 mV of the chlo-
ride equilibrium potential or ±10 mV of the potassium 
equilibrium potential were chosen for chloride and po-
tassium currents, respectively. Only fibers normalized to 
leak conductance within a standard deviation of the 
mean value were included for analysis.

RNA analysis
Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were removed from eu-
thanized R6/2 mice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 
stored at −80°C. Total RNA was isolated from muscle 
samples using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit (QIA 
GEN). TA muscles were removed from mice at the 
same time as FDB and IO. TA samples were chosen 
based on age and were not dependent on electrophysi-
ological experiments. 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed 
to synthesize cDNA. For analysis of alternatively spliced 
gene products (inclusion of exon 7a) of Clcn1, PCR 
was performed for 30 cycles, annealing at 52°C using 
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) protocol.

TCC-3′ primers were used (In-

stated above. To quantify full-length total Clcn1 and 
Kcnj2 mRNA levels, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was 
performed with an MJ Research DNA engine Opticon 
2. Clcn1 was quantified using primers that spanned ei-
ther exons 10–14 or exons 16–19 as previously de-
scribed (Waters et al., 2013). Kcnj2 was quantified 
using a TaqMan assay (Mm00434616.m1; Applied Bio-
systems). Clcn1 and Kcnj2 were normalized to β2-mi-
croglobulin (TaqMan assay Mm00437762.m1; Applied 
Biosystems) and analyzed using the ΔΔCT method 
(Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform mRNAs were 
quantified similar to full-length Clcn1 and Kcnj2 
mRNAs using the real-time PCR procedures and the 
ΔΔCT method. Expression levels were again normal-
ized to β2-microglobulin. TaqMan assays (Applied 
Biosystems)

g1, and Mm01329494.m1 were used to quantify myh1 
(MyHC-2x), myh2 (MyHC-2a), myh3 (MyHC-embry-
onic), myh4 (MyHC-2b), myh7 (MyHC-1), and myh8 
(MyHC-neonatal), respectively, as described in Tal-
madge et al. (2014).
Clcn1 and Kcnj2 pre-mRNA were assessed as markers 
for gene transcription (see for example, Huey et al. 
[2003] and Ponzio et al. [2007]). A semi-quantitative 
one-step RT-PCR protocol (One-Step with Q reagent; 
QIA 
GEN) was used to quantify pre-mRNA levels in the 
TA of WT and R6/2 (HD) mice. Total RNA was ob-
tained from TA muscles of WT and HD mice (n = 6 per 
group) using the TRIzol technique (Chomczynski and 
Sacchi, 1987) followed by a DNase treatment (DNA-
Free; Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. cDNA was syn-
thesized from 1 µg RNA using primers designed to 
reverse transcribe and subsequently amplify only the 
specific pre-mRNA of interest (across an intron–exon 
boundary). Because the primers amplify a product that 
crosses an intron–exon boundary, Clcn1 and Kcnj2 
mRNA would not generate reaction products. For 
Clcn1, the forward primer was located in intron 1 and 
the reverse primer in the following exon. For Kcnj2, the 
forward primer was located in exon 1 and the reverse 
primer in the following intron. For the RT-PCR step, the 
optimal annealing temperatures were determined using 
the gradient function on an MJ Research DNA Engine 
(56°C for Clcn1 and 60°C for Kcnj2). PCR was per-
formed using the following temperature steps: HotStar-
Taq PCR activation for 15 min at 95°C and then 32 
cycles of 1-min denaturing (94°C), 1-min annealing 
(see above), and 1-min extension (72°C), followed by 
final extension for 10 min (72°C), which resulted in 
433-bp and 237-bp PCR products for Clcn1 and Kcnj2, 
respectively. Because contaminating genomic DNA 
would also generate a similar-sized PCR product and in-
terfere with quantification of the pre-mRNAs, PCR reac-
tions using an equal amount of non–reverse transcribed 
RNA were performed. In this case, the one-step reac-
tions were run as normal, but the RNA was added im-
mediately after the RT step (50°C for 30 min). These 
reactions did not produce reaction products, demon-
strating an absence of contaminating genomic DNA. 
PCR products were quantified on ethidium bromide–
stained 1.8% agarose Tris-Borate-EDTA gels. For nor-
malization purposes, one-step RT-PCR was performed 
on each sample using primers for 18S ribosomal RNA 
(Ambion). Clcn1 and Kcnj2 band intensities were nor-
malized to 18S RNA band intensities.
Protein analysis
Western blotting for the quantification of mus-
cleblind-like (MBNL) proteins were as follows. In brief, 
TA muscles from late-stage R6/2 and age-matched WT 
mice (n = 5 per group) were homogenized in 9 vol of 
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with a protease 
inhibitor cocktail added (cOmplete, Mini EDTA-free 
protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich). The ho-
mogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 
4°C, and the supernatants were saved at −80°C for 
analysis. The protein contents of the TA supernatants 
were quantified according to Bradford (1976). Super-
natant proteins (50 µg per sample) diluted in Laemmli 
sample buffer were then separated on sodium dodecyl 
sulfate–polyacrylamide gels (10% T). The proteins 
were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride 
(PVDF) membranes using a semi-dry blotting proce-
dure. The PVDF membranes were then blocked in 
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 
(TTBS) and 4% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. After blocking, 
the membranes were incubated for 18 h at 4°C in pri-
mary antibodies, MB1a(4A8) for MBNL1 (Holt et al., 
2009), MB2a(3b4) for MBNL-2 (Holt et al., 2009), or 
an antibody against β-actin (Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy). The MBNL primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 
and the β-actin antibody 1:500 in blocking solution. 
MBNL1 and MBNL1 antibodies were developed by 
G.E. Morris (Centre for Inherited Neuromuscular Dis-
ease, RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, England, 
UK). The membranes were washed in TTBS (3× 10 
min) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary 
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After a second 
wash in TTBS (3× 10 min), the membranes were incu-
bated in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent sub-
strate 
(Thermo 
Fisher 
Scientific) 
for 
5 
min. 
Chemiluminescent images and band quantification 
were performed using a FluorChem image analysis sys-
 59
JGP Vol. 149, No. 1
tem (Alpha Innotech). All Western blot images are 
shown as reverse images, and MBNL quantitative data 
are normalized to β-actin. MyHC isoforms were quanti-
fied as described in Talmadge and Roy (1993).
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and 
immunofluorescence (IF)
The detection of CAG transcripts in three R6/2 and 
three WT mice was performed with FISH using the 
TYE563-labeled DNA/LNA probes 5′(CTG)6-CA with 
modified LNA at positions 5, 8, 13, 16, and 19 (Exiqon; 
de Mezer et al., 2011; Mykowska et al., 2011). Frozen 
sections (18 µm) of whole FDB muscles were washed 
in PBS and fixed in modified Carnoy’s (2% formalin, 
25% acetic acid, and 73% ethanol) at 4°C for 30 min. 
After fixation, tissue was incubated in 30% formamide 
with 2× SSC buffer for 30 min at room temperature. 
Tissue was incubated with FISH probe (2 ng/µl) in hy-
bridization buffer (30% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dex-
tran sulfate, 2 mM vanadyl nucleoside, and 0.02% 
BSA) first at 75°C for 5 min to denature the target 
RNA and probe and then overnight at 37°C in hybrid-
ization chamber while light protected. After hybridiza-
tion, tissue was washed three times for 5 min in 30% 
formamide with 2× SSC buffer and then three times 
for 5 min in 30% formamide with 1× SSC Buffer for 15 
min at room temperature.
To detect MBNL1, IF was performed using rabbit an-
ti-MBNL1 primary antibody (1:2K, A2764; a gift from 
C. Thornton, University of Rochester Medical Center, 
Rochester, NY). After FISH, tissue was washed in PBS 
with 0.3% Triton X-100 (TX) for 15 min, blocked for 
1 h with 10% normal horse serum (Vector Laborato-
ries), and then incubated in primary antibody at 4°C 
overnight. After a wash in PBS with 0.3% TX for 15 
min, immunoreactivity was detected with anti–rab-
bit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 
(1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) 
for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue was washed in PBS 
with 0.3% TX for 15 min and then PBS for 10 min, 
mounted in VEC 
TAS 
HIE 
LD medium with 4′,6-diamid-
ino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) for 
imaging. To confirm our observations were specific to 
skeletal muscle nuclei, in two R6/2 and WT mice, the 
FISH and IF methods were also performed in dissoci-
ated muscle preparations.
Confocal imaging and figure composition
Micrographs of fluorescently labeled FDB skeletal mus-
cles were obtained on a FluoView 1000 (Olympus) con-
focal microscope with a 60× oil immersion objective 
(NA 1.35) at 0.2-µm z-steps for both R6/2 and WT mice. 
Microscope images were prepared by adjusting contrast 
and brightness and sharpened using a “high gauss” fil-
ter in Image Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics) 
equally in R6/2 and WT images. The information con-
tent of the images was preserved. Figures were com-
posed using CorelDraw (v. 12.0).

required for an e-fold change in current. Linear fits 
were used to determine conductance values.
Statistics
A two-tailed t test was used to compare means of two 
independent samples that were found normal by the 
Shapiro-Wilk test and had equal variances based on a 
folded F variance ratio test. We used the Mann-Whit-
ney rank sum test for nonnormal and/or heterosce-
dastic samples. Repeated measures one-way ANO 
VA 
was used to compare means of mouse weights within 
the same category (i.e., R6/2 or WT). For full datasets 
plotted as a function of age, we hypothesized that the 
skeletal muscle properties change in R6/2 and WT 
mice during maturation (3–12 wk of age) and that 
those changes differ between R6/2 and WT mice. 
Electrical characteristics of conductances (mS/cm2 
and mS/µF) and Cm (µF/cm2) were measured on one 
to nine muscle fibers per mouse. The mRNA process-
ing data were measured from one muscle sample per 
mouse. The number of fibers or muscle samples used 
in each experiment is included in relevant sections of 
the Results. We used linear mixed models for testing 
the above hypotheses and included individuals as a 
random variable when multiple measures were taken 
per individual to avoid pseudo-replication. We fit the 
models by maximum likelihood and tested the above 
hypotheses with F-tests using the Satterthwaite method 
for estimating denominator degrees of freedom. We 
included age as a continuous variable and genotype as 
a categorical variable (R6/2 vs. WT), as well as an in-
teraction between the two to test the hypothesis that 
muscle development differs over time between WT 
and disease mice. The overall significance of age tested 
our first hypothesis that muscle characteristics change 
over time. We inspected model residuals visually for 
deviation from assumptions of normality, homoscedas-
ticity, and patterns that would suggest a curvilinear re-
lationship, rather than a straight line. Means were 
compared in SigmaPlot except for the behavior data, 
which was completed with Prism. All other statistical 
analyses were conducted in the statistical program-
ming environment R (R Core Team 2013). Null hy-
potheses in all statistical tests were rejected at α ≤ 0.05.

Body weight and behavior
Mean mouse body weights were grouped per week of 
age from a total of 41 R6/2 mice and 50 age-matched 
WT littermates (Fig. 1). As expected, the WT mice 
continuously gained weight from 3–12 wk of age. From 
4–6 wk of age, the R6/2 mice weighed slightly but sig-
nificantly more than WT mice. However, from 6–10 
wk, the R6/2 mice did not gain or lose weight. It was 
not until 10 wk of age that the R6/2 mice began to lose 
weight. From 10–12 wk, the weight of the R6/2 mice 
became significantly lower than WT. This reduction is 
consistent with previous studies (Carter et al., 1999; 
Ribchester et al., 2004; She et al., 2011). The R6/2 
weight loss was an indicator of progression into the 
late stages of disease.
To confirm that motor symptoms developed in our 
R6/2 colony, automated behavior analysis was per-
formed on mice in their home cage environment. 
R6/2 mice exhibited a significant decrease (P = 0.019) 
in hanging compared with WT mice at the late stage of 
the disease (Fig. S1), roughly corresponding to the 
time of weight loss in the R6/2 mice. Our previous, 
more detailed, study of behavior showed that the 
motor defects appeared in R6/2 mice as young as 7 wk 
of age (Steele et al., 2007), in line with several other 
studies (Carter et al., 1999; Ribchester et al., 2004; She 
et al., 2011) and near the time at which the R6/2 
weight began to plateau.
Muscle chloride channels
To determine any age-dependent functional defects in 
the muscle chloride channel (ClC-1), IClC-1 values were 
measured from dissociated FDB or IO muscle fibers 
from R6/2 and WT mice using two-electrode voltage- 
clamp. All IClC-1 were normalized to membrane capaci-
tance to obtain IClC-1 density (µA/µF). Fig. 2 shows the 
voltage- and time-dependent properties of IClC-1 values 
between age-matched WT (left) and late-stage R6/2 
(right) muscle fibers obtained from a three-pulse proto-
col (Fig. 2 A). Late-stage R6/2 mice had a 44% reduc-
tion (P = 0.003) in peak IClC-1 density (−125.63 ± 12.37 
µA/µF) at −140 mV compared with WT animals 
(−220.99 ± 33.93 µA/µF; Fig. 2 D).
IClC-1 was isolated by blocking Na+, K+, and Ca2+ chan-
nels with tetrodotoxin, Cs+/TEA, and nifedipine, re-
spectively. High intracellular chloride (70 mM) was 
used to maximize inward chloride currents. From a 
holding potential of −20 mV, the chloride equilibrium 
potential, ClC-1 was fully activated by applying a 150-
ms conditioning pulse to 60 mV (Fig. 2 A, P1). Subse-
quently, the voltage dependence of the peak IClC-l 
through the open channels was determined by apply-
ing a series of 200-ms voltage steps from −140 mV to 
120 mV in increments of 20 mV (Fig. 2 A, P2). After 
the channels deactivated, the voltage was stepped to 
−100 mV for 50 ms (Fig. 2 A, P3) to determine the rel-
ative open probability. The total currents recorded in 
this protocol include IClC-1 plus the leak and capacitive 
currents (Fig. 2 B). To obtain specific IClC-1, the voltage 
protocol was repeated in the presence 0.4 mM 9AC, a 
chloride channel blocker (Fig. 2 C). The currents re-
corded during exposure to 9AC included only the leak 
and capacitive currents. Specific IClC-1 records were 
generated by subtracting the currents recorded in the 
presence of 9AC from the total currents recorded be-
fore 9AC (Fig. 2 D). The current-voltage (IV) relation-
ship of the peak specific IClC-1 records during P2 for 
WT and R6/2 fibers is shown in Fig. 2 E. There was a 
significant reduction in R6/2 peak IClC-1 density com-
pared with WT at all voltages except −20 mV, the re-
versal potential for Cl−.

mouse weights plotted as a function of age in weeks. The n 
values represent the number of weights recorded from each 
mouse at different ages within the given age range. Student’s t 
test indicted a significant difference (*) between WT and R6/2 
mice at 4 (nWT = 102, nR6/2 = 98, P = 0.029), 5 (nWT = 97, nR6/2 = 
89, P = 0.049), 6 (nWT = 87, nR6/2 = 71, P ≤ 0.001), 10 (nWT = 37, 
nR6/2 = 23, P = 0.002), 11 (nWT = 27, nR6/2 = 16, P = 0.002), and 
12 (nWT = 11, nR6/2 = 5, P = 0.002) wk of age. The number of 
weight measurements decreased with age because mice used 
for experiments were removed from the cohort. Repeated one‑
way ANO 
VA measurements were used to assess the plateau in 
R6/2 weight. There was no significant difference between age 
groups 6–10 for R6/2 mice (P = 0.378). However, there was a 
significant difference (**) in R6/2 age groups between 6–11 wk 
(P = 0.049) and 6–12 wk (P = 0.032). Data are presented as 
mean and errors as SEM.

Adequate voltage control of skeletal muscle, particu-
larly in the transverse tubular (t-tubular) system, can be 
difficult to obtain. Voltage-clamp errors caused by 
space-clamp problems will result in abrupt changes in 
IV profiles and poorly resolved reversal potentials (Be-
zanilla et al., 1982). Supporting adequate voltage con-
trol, our IClC-1 values had a smooth voltage dependence 
and reversal potential near the predicted value of −20 
mV, based on the concentrations in our intracellular 
(electrode) and extracellular solutions.
The specific GClC-1 of the fibers in mS/µF was the 
slope of the IV relationship from −140 to −100 mV. To 
more accurately examine ClC-1 function during disease 
progression, the GClC-1 of individual WT (n = 79 fibers; 
31 mice) and R6/2 (n = 77 fibers; 23 mice) skeletal mus-
cle fibers was plotted as a function of age (Fig. 3 A). For 
consistency with our previous work, Fig. 3 (A and B) 
also includes five fibers from four R6/2 mice and nine 
fibers from three WT mice from our initial characteriza-
tion of ClC-1 function in HD (Waters et al., 2013). The 
data were analyzed with a mixed linear model. The dif-
ference in slopes between R6/2 and WT GClC-1 (P = 
0.019) occurred because WT GClC-1 significantly in-
creased with age (P = 0.045), whereas the R6/2 GClC-1 
did not change with age (P = 0.174). We estimated the 
age at which the R6/2 GClC-1 diverged from WT mice 
using 95% confidence intervals (Fig. 3 B). GClC-1 values 
in Fig. 3 B are shown as means per mouse. This is not 
equivalent to the inclusion of individuals as a random 
variable in the mixed models but is the closest possible 
graphical representation. Based on the intersection of 
the confidence intervals, the divergence between WT 
and R6/2 GClC-1 began at ∼35 d.
By determining the relative open probability of ClC-1, 
we previously observed no voltage-dependent changes 
in ClC-1 function from late-stage R6/2 fibers compared 
with WT mice (Waters et al., 2013). Here, the age de-
pendence of ClC-1 relative open probability was ana-
lyzed from the same fibers as shown in Fig. 3 (A and B). 
There was no difference in the voltage of half-maximal 
activation (V0.5) between WT (−36.13 ± 1.44 mV) and 
R6/2 (−34.14 ± 1.40 mV) fibers (P = 0.32; based on n of 
fibers). Based on the mixed linear model, there was no 
change in the V0.5 of WT (P = 0.073) or R6/2 (P = 0.653) 
over time, and there was no difference between the V0.5 
of WT and R6/2 over time (P = 0.659). Although not 
significant, the WT V0.5 tended to slightly decrease with 
age (−0.17 ± 0.09 mV/day; P = 0.073). Similarly, there 
were no differences in the slope factor for the Boltz-
mann curve (k) between WT (22.59 ± 0.32) and R6/2 
(22.31 ± 0.37) fibers (P = 0.57; based on n of fibers). 
Moreover, there was no age-dependent change in k val-
ues for WT (P = 0.495) and R6/2 (P = 0.653) fibers or a 
change between the WT and R6/2 k values over time (P 
= 0.424). This supports the normal functioning of ClC-1 
over the time course of study.

Chloride channel mRNA
In separate experiments, the level of aberrantly spliced 
Clcn1 mRNA containing exon 7a over the progression 
of the disease was measured from WT (n = 25 mice) and 
R6/2 (n = 30 mice) TA muscle (Fig. 3 C). The level of 
Clcn1 mRNA with exon 7a in R6/2 skeletal muscle did 
not change over time (P = 0.553). In contrast, the level 
of Clcn1 mRNA with exon 7a in WT muscle decreased 
with time (P = 0.026). Because of the different progres-
sions, the level of exon 7a inclusion in R6/2 muscle dif-
fered from WT over time (P = 0.041). The confidence 
intervals of the linear regressions indicate that the level 
of exon 7a Clcn1 mRNA in R6/2 skeletal muscle began 
to differ from WT mice at ∼35 d of age, analogous to 
the divergence in GClC-1.
Two additional aberrant splice variants of Clcn1 
mRNA were examined by assessing the expression of se-
quences between exons 5 and 8. One variant includes 
an exon between exons 7 and 8, called exon 8a (Man-
kodi et al., 2002). The other isoform includes an exten-
sion of exon 6. There was a significant (P < 0.001) 
increase in the combined aberrantly spliced Clcn1 
mRNA transcripts within exons 5–8 from late-stage 
R6/2 mice relative to WT mice (Fig. 4 A). These find-
ings support an increase in multiple alternatively spliced 
Clcn1 mRNA isoforms during disease progression.
There was a significant reduction in total full-length 
Clcn1 mRNA as measured by using primers spanning 
exons 10–14 (Fig. 4 B, P = 0.015) and 16–19 (Fig. 4 C, P 
< 0.001) at the late stage of the disease. Although the 
levels of full-length Clcn1 mRNA were not statistically 
reduced in younger muscle, the data trended toward a 
progressive decrease over time in experiments with 
both primers. This trend is in line with the age-depen-
dent reduction in GClC-1, suggesting that aberrant splic-
ing of Clcn1 mRNA causes a reduction in full-length 
Clcn1 mRNA and subsequently reduces the levels of 
functional ClC-1 proteins. To further examine the de-
crease in full-length Clcn1 mRNA, pre-mRNA was mea-
sured in WT and R6/2 muscle. There was no significant 
change in Clcn1 pre-mRNA in WT compared with R6/2 
muscle (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that the reduction of full-
length Clcn1 mRNA was caused by a posttranscriptional 
defect such as aberrant mRNA splicing.
Kir channels
The age dependence of Kir channel currents (IKir) in 
dissociated FDB and IO muscle fibers from R6/2 and 
WT mice were measured using two-electrode voltage- 
clamp. All IKir were normalized to membrane capaci-
tance to obtain IKir density (µA/µF). Kir channels open 
at potentials negative to the potassium equilibrium po-
tential (EK) and generate inward currents; at potentials 
positive to EK, Kir channels are mostly closed (Standen 
and Stanfield, 1980). The subtraction approach we used 
was analogous to that described above for IClC-1 values. 
The major Na+, Cl−, and Ca2+ channels were blocked 
with tetrodotoxin, 9AC, and nifedipine, respectively. IKir 
was obtained by taking the difference between the cur-
rents recorded before and during exposure to the Kir 
channel blocker, Ba2+ (5 mM).
Large inward currents were generated by using high 
extracellular potassium (130 mM). The predicted EK of 
−10 mV was calculated using an intracellular K+ concen-
tration of 190 mM (electrode solution). From a holding 
potential of 0 mV, 700-ms pulses ranging from −60 to 20 
mV were applied in 10-mV increments (Fig. 5 A). Peak 
IKir from late-stage R6/2 fibers were reduced compared

fibers as a function of time. Linear regression lines are shown as solid black lines for WT and broken red lines for R6/2 fibers. There 
was a significant difference between WT and R6/2 slopes (P = 0.019), a significant increase in WT GClC‑1 over time (P = 0.045), and no 
significant change in R6/2 GClC‑1 over time (P = 0.174). (B) Mean GClC‑1 per mouse with 95% confidence intervals for WT (black) and 
R6/2 (red) data points. The slope of the R6/2 regression line was −0.006 ± 0.004 GClC‑1/day, and the slope of the WT regression line 
was 0.009 ± 0.004 GClC‑1/day. (C) Age dependence of aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA (with exon 7a) per mouse with 95% confidence 
intervals for WT (black) and R6/2 (red) data points. There was no significant change in R6/2 exon 7a+ overtime (P = 0.553), a signif‑
icant decrease in WT exon 7a+ over time (P = 0.026), and a significant difference between R6/2 and WT slopes (P = 0.041). Note, 
two R6/2 Exon 7a+ data points overlap (32 d, 13.3%). The slope of the R6/2 regression line was 0.010 ± 0.017% exon 7a+/day and 
the slope of the WT regression line was −0.045 ± 0.019% exon 7a+/day.

with WT fibers (Fig. 5 B) as described previously (Wa-
ters et al., 2013). Kir channel conductance (GKir) was 
the slope of the IV relationship for the peak IKir from 
−60 to −40 mV (Fig. 5 C).
To examine the Kir channel defects during disease 
progression, the GKir (mS/µF) of individual WT (n = 86 
fibers; 25 mice) and R6/2 (n = 90 fibers; 26 mice) skel-
etal muscle fibers were plotted as a function of age and 
fit with a linear regression lines (Fig. 6 A). Included are 
9 fibers from 4 R6/2 mice and 10 fibers from 3 WT mice 
from our previous study (Waters et al., 2013). The de-
crease in R6/2 GKir over time was not significant (P = 
0.138), and R6/2 GKir was not different relative to WT 
(P = 0.586). However, GKir was lower in R6/2 fibers rela-
tive to WT fibers throughout the disease progression. 
Confidence intervals with the mean GKir per mouse 
(Fig. 6 B) point to a divergence between WT and R6/2 
GKir at 40 d of age. The apparent divergence of WT and 
R6/2 GKir, which was not reflected in the trend lines, 
may be the result of a smaller sample size for younger 
mice. Regardless, the data indicate that the R6/2 GKir 
began to differ from WT early in muscle maturation.
The age dependence of the relative expression level 
of full-length Kir mRNA (Kcnj2) was also measured. 
The full-length Kcnj2 transcripts were significantly re-
duced (P = 0.005) only in late-stage R6/2 mice relative 
to WT (Fig. 6 C). Additionally, there was no significant 
difference in Kcnj2 pre-mRNA between R6/2 and WT 
muscle (Fig. 6 D).
Membrane capacitance
Previously, a decrease in the Cm (µF/cm2) was observed 
in late-stage R6/2 mice, suggesting a loss of t-tubular 
membrane in HD skeletal muscle (Waters et al., 2013). 
The age dependence of Cm was determined from the 
WT (n = 165 fibers; 56 mice) and R6/2 (n = 167 fibers; 
39 mice) fibers used to measure GClC-1 and GKir (Fig. 7 A). 
Cm was determined from step changes in voltage-clamp 
under conditions in which all of the ion channels were 
blocked (i.e., in the presence of 9AC in the GClC-1 exper-
iments). Fig. 7 includes 14 fibers from 8 R6/2 mice and 
19 fibers from 6 WT mice from our previous study (Wa-
ters et al., 2013). The Cm of WT fibers did not change 
with age (P = 0.447), whereas the Cm of R6/2 fibers sig-
nificantly decreased with age (P < 0.001). Additionally, 
the WT Cm was significantly different from that of WT 
over time (P < 0.001). Like GClC-1 and GKir, the plot of 
the mean WT and R6/2 Cm values per mouse with con-
fidence intervals (Fig. 7 B) suggests that the divergence 
between WT and R6/2 Cm occurred at 40 d of age.
The Cm of skeletal muscle depends on fiber diame-
ter, such that smaller fibers have a lower Cm (Hodgkin 
and Nakajima, 1972). Thus, some of the changes in 
R6/2 fibers could be caused by disease-related fiber at-
rophy (Carter et al., 1999; Ribchester et al., 2004; She 
et al., 2011). To reduce or eliminate this effect, re-

Relative percentage of aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA between

R6/2 mice at the early (nWT = 6 mice, nR6/2 = 9 mice) or mid (nWT = 
7 mice, nR6/2 = 7 mice) stage of the disease. There was a significant 
increase in aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA at the late stage of the 
disease (nWT = 7 mice, nR6/2 = 6 mice; *, P < 0.001). (B and C) Rel‑
ative percentage of total full‑length Clcn1 mRNA as measured by

(nWT = 9 mice, nR6/2 = 10 mice) or mid (nWT = 9 mice, nR6/2 = 10 mice) 
stage of the disease. There was a significant decrease in total Clcn1 
mRNA at the late‑stage of the disease (nWT = 10, nR6/2 = 9) for exons 
10–14 (*, P = 0.017) and exons 16–19 (*, P < 0.019). (D) Relative

and R6/2 (7.967 ± 2.049) Clcn1 pre‑mRNA. Data are presented as 
mean and errors as SEM.

cords were only taken from larger R6/2 fibers in this 
study. The diameters of all the fibers used for electro-
physiology were plotted as a function of age (Fig. S2). 
There was no difference in diameter between WT and 
R6/2 fibers at any age (P = 0.191). Thus, the effects of 
fiber atrophy on Cm was eliminated or greatly mini-
mized by analyzing WT and R6/2 fibers that were 
similar in size.
Our chloride and potassium current records normal-
ized to capacitance should reflect the current density 
regardless of any loss of t-tubular membrane. However, 
a difference between the currents normalized to capac-
itance or surface area may suggest a loss or altered func-
tion in the chloride and potassium channels of the 
t-tubules. For comparison, the age dependence of GClC-1 
and GKir normalized to surface area are shown in Fig. S3.
Sequestration of MBNL1
In myotonic dystrophy, type 1, CUG repeats sequester 
the mRNA-binding protein MBNL1 in nuclear foci of 
skeletal muscle fibers, which triggers aberrant splicing 
of several mRNA transcripts (Lin et al., 2006). A combi-
nation of IF against MBNL1 and FISH targeting ex-
panded CAG repeats in FDB muscle slices were used to 
determine whether MBNL1 was similarly sequestered by 
CAG repeats in late-stage R6/2 skeletal muscle (Fig. 8). 
MBNL1 and CAG repeat foci were frequently observed 
in R6/2 muscle; however, those foci rarely colocalized

(Fig. 8 A). Nonetheless, some foci with colocalization 
were observed but often required searching several slices 
of muscle tissue to locate (Fig. 8 B). Diffuse MBNL1 im-
munoreactivity was found throughout the nuclei of R6/2 
and WT fibers, which can be seen in the absence of DAPI 
staining (Fig. 8 B). There was no evidence of MBNL1 or 
CAG repeat foci in WT nuclei (Fig. 8 C). Cytoplasmic 
MBNL1 immunoreactivity was observed in both R6/2 
and WT fibers, consistent with a previous study of MBNL1 
(Wang et al., 2014). Diffuse nuclear labeling of the 
CAG-trinucleotide repeats in R6/2 fibers and, to a lesser 
degree, in WT fibers was also detected.
Gastrocnemius muscle slices from HSALR mice, a 
model for myotonic dystrophy, type 1, were also exam-
ined with the same probes and conditions used for the 
R6/2 and WT FDB slices. The CAG probe used here has 
been shown to bind CUG repeats in myotonic dystro-
phy (Urbanek and Krzyzosiak, 2016). Likewise, CUG 
probes have been shown to bind CAG repeat expan-
sions in HD (Sun et al., 2015). In contrast to R6/2 tis-
sue, there was abundant colocalization of MBNL1 and 
CUG repeats (detected by the CAG probe) in nuclear 
foci of the HSALR muscle (Fig. 8 D), consistent with a 
previous study (Urbanek and Krzyzosiak, 2016).
Muscle tissue includes nuclei from multiple cell types, 
including muscle fibers, endothelial cells, satellite cells, 
fibroblasts, and other cell types. To confirm specificity 
to single muscle fibers, the same combination of IF and 
FISH was performed on dissociated FDB and IO fibers 
from late-stage R6/2 mice. Consistent with our observa-
tions in muscle tissue slices, foci of MBNL1 and the 
CAG repeats did not colocalize in the nuclei of dissoci-
ated fibers (Fig. 8 E).
To determine whether the expression level of MBNL1 
was altered in R6/2 tissue, the levels of MBNL1 and 
MBNL2 were measured by Western blot of whole TA 
muscle homogenates. No significant changes were 
found between MBNL1 and MBNL2 protein levels in 
R6/2 compared with WT (Fig. 9).
MyHC isoform expression
MyHC isoform expression in the TA was assessed in late-
stage R6/2 and WT mice. Significant reductions in the 
expression of MyHC-2x and MyHC-2b, the fastest of the 
adult MyHC isoforms, were observed at the mRNA level 
in R6/2 skeletal muscle relative to WT (Fig. 10 A). In 
contrast, no significant changes in either MyHC-2a or 
MyHC-1, the slowest adult MyHC isoforms, were ob-
served. MyHC-neonatal mRNA was significantly ele-
vated by a factor of ∼3 in R6/2 compared with WT mice 
(P = 0.008). Although MyHC-embryonic mRNA was not 
significantly different between WT and R6/2 skeletal 
muscle (P = 0.135), the level of MyHC-embryonic 
tended to be higher in R6/2 mice relative to WT. Curi-
ously, at the protein level (Fig. 10 B), it was found that 
MyHC-2x was elevated in R6/2 mice relative to WT (P = 
0.004). Embryonic and neonatal MyHC proteins were 
not clearly observed in the SDS-PAGE gels of WT and 
R6/2 TA muscle, which may have occurred because of 
co-migration of neonatal MyHC with MyHC-2x and 
co-migration of embryonic with MyHC-2a. Expressing 
the mRNA data as mean expression level relative to 
β2-microglobulin (but not normalized per isoform) re-
veals that the magnitude of the reduction in MyHC-2b

was significantly greater than the reduction in MyHC-2x 
mRNA (Fig. 10 C). This resulted in an elevation in the 
total proportion of MyHC-2x mRNA in R6/2 mice rela-
tive to WT (Fig. 10 D), which corresponded to the net 
increase in MyHC-2x protein. This, in part, explains the 
increase in MyHC-2x at the protein level despite an ab-
solute reduction at the mRNA level because the propor-
tion of MyHC isoforms synthesized at the protein level 
(Fig. 10 B) likely reflects the proportions at the mRNA 
level (Fig. 10 D).
Q175 mice
To show that the altered maturational state observed in 
HD skeletal muscle was not unique to the early-onset 
model for HD (i.e., the R6/2 mouse model), GClC-1, Cm, 
Clcn1 mRNA processing, and MyHC isoform expres-
sion were measured in another model for HD, the Q175 
mouse line (a model for late onset of HD symptoms), 
and their WT littermates. 1-yr-old (12–15 mo) Q175 HD 
mice (n = 25 fibers; 4 mice) and age-matched WT mice 
(n = 21 fibers; 3 mice) were analyzed. When normalized 
to capacitance, there was a significant difference be-
tween Q175 (1.1 ± 0.1 mS/µF) and WT (1.4 ± 0.1 mS/
µF) GClC-1 (P = 0.013). There was also a significant differ-
ence between Q175 (4.3 ± 0.4 mS/cm2) and WT (7.3 ± 
0.6 mS/cm2) GClC-1 if normalized to surface area (P < 
0.001). A significant difference between Q175 (3.9 ± 0.1 
µF/cm2) and WT (5.1 ± 0.1 µF/cm2) Cm (P < 0.001) 
was also observed.
In addition to GClC-1, changes in Clcn1 mRNA aber-
rant splicing were also observed in Q175 mice. These 
changes were similar to those observed in R6/2 mice 
(Fig. 11 A). Whereas FDB and IO muscles were re-
moved and dissociated for single fiber electrophysio-
logical experiments, TA muscles were removed from 
the same Q175 (n = 5 mice) and WT (n = 5) mice for 
mRNA analysis. A significant increase (P = 0.05) in ab-
errantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA containing exon 7a was 
observed in Q175 skeletal muscle (7.20 ± 0.32% mis-
spliced) compared with WT mice (6.02 ± 0.48% mis-
spliced). However, no differences were observed in 
full-length Clcn1 mRNA.

MBNL1 and the CAG probe was observed in 
HSALR gastrocnemius tissue. A small number 
of non‑colocalized foci were also present (gray 
arrows). Note that CAG probe binds CUG re‑

has been shown previously (Sun et al., 2015;

ated FDB fibers from R6/2 mice were probed

Similar to the R6/2 mouse model of HD, the Q175 
mice showed a significant reduction (P = 0.008) in 
MyHC-2b mRNA (Fig. 11 B). Although significant 
changes were not detected in MyHCs-1, -2a, -2x, or 
-embryonic, the neonatal MyHC isoform tended to 
be elevated, although not significantly (P = 0.08).
d I s c u s s I o n
Previously, we found defects in R6/2 skeletal muscle 
IClC-1 and IKir, membrane capacitance, and mRNA pro-
cessing (Waters et al., 2013). The resulting hyperex-
citability causes delayed muscle relaxation that can 
help explain the dystonia, rigidity, and bradykinesia 
that characterize the motor symptoms of HD. How-
ever, all of this previous work was completed with 
R6/2 mice that were near terminal. Thus, the initial 
objective of this study was to determine the time 
course over which these defects develop in R6/2 
mice. It was found that the skeletal muscle defects 
present before motor symptom onset and that the 
ClC-1 defects increased in severity throughout dis-
ease progression. This lead to the discovery of neona-
tal MyHC isoforms expression in both juvenile-onset 
(R6/2) and adult-onset (Q175) HD mouse models. 
Finally, despite similar deficits in chloride currents 
and Clcn1 mRNA splicing, we report evidence that 
the underlying mechanism for these deficits may, in 
large part, be unique from that observed in myotonic 
dystrophy, type 1.
Weight loss, muscle growth, and behavior
It is well known that R6/2 mice lose weight with age 
(Carter et al., 1999; Ribchester et al., 2004; She et al., 
2011), in part, as a result of disease-related skeletal 
muscle atrophy (Mielcarek et al., 2015). Our results 
show a plateau in R6/2 mouse weight from 6 to 10 
wk of age, a lack of growth that may be related to a 
disruption in muscle maturation. The weight loss 
that began at 10 wk of age in R6/2 mice can be at-
tributed primarily to atrophy, suggesting that muscle 
atrophy predominates at the late stage of the disease 
rather than a lack of growth. This corresponds to an 
analysis of R6/2 muscle fiber diameter that showed 
decreases in diameter beginning after 8 wk of age 
(Ribchester et al., 2004).
In our previous study of R6/2 mouse home cage ac-
tivity (Steele et al., 2007), decreases in locomotor and 
exploratory behaviors were notable even in early stages 
of disease and steadily declined thereafter. In the pres-
ent study, we observed similar levels of most locomotor 
behaviors and only observed a decrease in hanging be-
havior at the last time point tested. Given that the sam-
ple sizes used for behavioral measurements were low, it 
is difficult to conclude whether the R6/2 home cage 
behavioral phenotype has changed over the past de-
cade or whether we happened to use several mice that 
were less affected by the disease transgene. Further test-
ing of locomotor behaviors and grip strength may be 
warranted to determine how well the alterations in 
muscle physiology and transcription correlate to gross 
locomotor phenotypes in the R6/2 mice.

ClC-1 defects
In support of disrupted muscle maturation, R6/2 
GClC-1 remained constant over the time course of the 
disease, whereas WT GClC-1 steadily increased. Changes 
in Clcn1 mRNA alternative splicing followed the same 
age-dependent trend. Namely, Clcn1 mRNA contain-
ing exon 7a remained constant over the time course of 
the disease. In WT muscle, however, high levels of ab-
errantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA were observed early in 
the time course and progressively decreased with age. 
This observation is consistent with other studies show-
ing postnatal decrease of Clcn1 mRNA containing 
exon 7a (Pierno et al., 1999; Mankodi et al., 2002; Lin 
et al., 2006). The inclusion of exon 7a results in a 
frame shift and premature termination of ClC-1 trans-
lation, resulting in fewer channel proteins. In addition 
to the exon 7a inclusion, a significant increase in late-
stage R6/2 Clcn1 mRNA splice variants (spanning 
exons 5–8) that are normally expressed in WT neona-
tal muscle (Mankodi et al., 2002) was observed. Thus, 
taking into account the reduction in full-length Clcn1 
mRNA and normal levels of Clcn1 pre-mRNA, our data 
support a reduction in Clcn1 mRNA expression 
through processing defects that underlie the progres-
sive reduction in GClC-1 in addition to an altered transi-
tion from neonatal to adult mRNA splicing in R6/2 
skeletal muscle.
Kir channels
Previously, we showed that GKir is reduced in late-stage 
R6/2 skeletal muscle. Together, the decreased GKir and 
GClC-1 in late-stage R6/2 mice causes muscle hyperexcit-
ability. Here, we found that the R6/2 GKir remained 
consistently lower than WT throughout the progression 
of the disease. This indicates that there is a very early or 
persistent decrease in R6/2 GKir that may contribute to 
the motor symptoms throughout the majority of dis-
ease progression.

WT expression level for a given isoform. The 2x and 2b isoforms were reduced in R6/2 muscle compared with WT. In contrast, the 
neonatal isoform was significantly elevated in R6/2 mice. Although not statistically different, the embryonic isoform was trending to 
be elevated in R6/2 muscle. *, P < 0.05. (B) Protein levels of MyHC‑1, MyHC‑2a, MyHC‑2b, and MyHC‑2x were measured from late‑
stage TA muscle from WT (n = 5) and R6/2 (n = 5) mice. There was a significantly higher (*, P = 0.004) level of MyHC‑2x in R6/2 mice 
compared with WT and no significant difference in MyHC‑1 (P = 0.075), MyHC‑2a (P = 0.948), or MyHC‑2b (P = 0.159) protein levels. 
Possibly because of comigration with 2x, the neonatal isoform was not clearly identified. (C) Mean relative MyHC isoform mRNA 
levels in WT and R6/2 mice (not normalized for a given isoform). As expected, MyHC isoforms 2b and 2x were the predominant

all isoforms as calculated from the mean relative MyHC isoform levels. The absolute magnitude of the reduction in MyHC‑2b mRNA 
was greater than the absolute magnitude of the reduction in MyHC‑2x mRNA. Thus, when expressing the data as the proportion of 
a given mRNA isoform for WT and R6/2 (D), an increase in the proportion of MyHC‑2x isoform mRNA was observed in R6/2 mice. 
Data are presented as mean and errors as SEM.

Unlike the parallel progression of GKir, the levels of 
full-length Kcnj2 mRNA decreased markedly in late-
stage R6/2 muscle compared with WT. This reduc-
tion is most likely caused by a posttranscriptional 
processing event other than aberrant splicing be-
cause (a) no significant changes in Kcnj2 pre-mRNA 
levels were observed in late-stage R6/2 skeletal mus-
cle, and thus transcription appears to be unaffected; 
and (b) the structure of the Kcnj2 gene includes only 
a single intron, and previous work found no evidence 
of alternative splicing of this gene (Houtman et al., 
2012). Possible explanations for the decrease in full-
length Kcnj2 mRNA in late-stage R6/2 muscle in-
clude alterations in mRNA transcript stability, altered 
expression of regulatory miRNAs, or altered expres-
sion of natural antisense transcripts. Additionally, an 
up-regulation of other Kir channel isoforms in late-
stage R6/2 muscle may compensate for the drop in 
full-length Kcnj2 mRNA, which codes for the Kir2.1 
isoform. Future analyses of the Kir channel protein 
will be needed to gain a greater understanding of the 
changes in Kir channel function that occur in R6/2 
skeletal muscle.
Membrane capacitance
Our analysis of the Cm may provide insights into the 
morphology of the R6/2 muscle fibers. Fiber capaci-
tance is proportional to the total amount of extracellu-
lar membrane, which in skeletal muscle includes the 
sarcolemma and the t-tubular membrane. Assuming 
all the extracellular membrane is included in the sur-
face area estimate, the Cm would be ∼1 µF/cm2, the 
typical capacitance of a biological membrane. Mature 
mammalian skeletal fibers have a Cm of ∼5 µF/cm2 be-
cause estimates of surface area do not include the in-
ternal t-tubular system (Falk and Fatt, 1964). Thus, a 
likely explanation for the R6/2 fibers having a lower 
Cm compared with WT mice is a loss or disruption of 
t-tubular membrane in the disease fibers. Such a t-tu-
bular membrane defect would reduce the Ca2+ re-
leased per action potential and help explain the 
muscle weakness that is common in HD patients. In-
deed, reduced Ca2+ transients have recently been mea-
sured in HD skeletal muscle fibers (Braubach et al., 
2014). Future experiments will be needed to directly 
assess the amount of t-tubular membrane in HD fibers 
and correlate those measurements with intracellular 
Ca2+ levels and specific force generation.
In this study, it is shown that the reduction in Cm of 
R6/2 fibers compared with WT mice increases with 
disease progression. Similar to the age-dependent 
changes in GClC-1 and aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA 
levels, the Cm of R6/2 skeletal muscle fibers began to 
diverge from WT mice in ∼5-wk-old mice. In contrast, 
the Cm of WT fibers were stable over the 3- to 12-wk age 
range. This data indicates an increasing disruption of 
membrane structure in R6/2 skeletal muscle during 
disease progression.
The total fiber capacitance was used to normalize 
our IClC-1 and IKir, which provides a measure of current 
density, regardless of the amount of t-tubular mem-
brane. The same currents normalized to fiber surface 
area (Fig. S3) show more dramatic age-dependent dif-
ferences between WT and R6/2 fibers. A straightfor-
ward explanation for this is that ClC-1 and Kir 
channels are being lost along with t-tubular mem-
brane. If the loss of t-tubular membrane is confirmed 
by direct optical measurements, these results have im-
plications for the uncertainty on whether or not ClC-1 
is expressed in the t-tubules (Lueck et al., 2010; Di-
Franco et al., 2011).
MyHC isoform expression in R6/2 mice
To test for disrupted muscle maturation, the profile of 
MyHC isoform expression was examined in late-stage 
WT and R6/2 skeletal muscle. Identifying MyHC iso-
forms is an established method for assessing changes in 
the phenotypic properties of muscle (Billeter et al., 
1981; Talmadge and Roy, 1993). As expected, little neo-
natal and embryonic myosin mRNA were present in 
late-stage WT skeletal muscle. However, a threefold in-
crease in the expression of MyHC-neonatal in the TA of 
late-stage R6/2 mice was observed, indicating that the

fast TA muscle either retains or re-attains some charac-
teristics of a developing muscle.
Most fiber type analyses of mature skeletal muscle 
focus on fiber types 1 and 2. Type 1 fibers express 
MyHC-1 and have a slow time-to-peak tension, slow 
maximal shortening velocity, and a high capacity for 
oxidative metabolism that results in a high resistance 
to fatigue. Type 2 fibers generally have faster time-to-
peak tensions and a range of oxidative capacities gen-
erally resulting in less resistance to fatigue (Talmadge, 
2000; Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011). Based on 
MyHC isoform content, type 2 fibers may be further 
subdivided into types 2a (MyHC-2a), 2d/x (MyHC- 
2x), and 2b (MyHC-2b) in mice. Type 2a, 2d/x, and 
2b fibers are high, intermediate, and low in oxidative 
capacity, respectively, with a corresponding reduction 
in resistance to fatigue. A transition from type 2x or 
2b to the more oxidative type 2a can occur normally 
with increased contractile activity as may occur with 
endurance training (Pette and Vrbová, 1992). Previ-
ous studies suggest that R6/2 fibers become more ox-
idative (Ribchester et al., 2004; Strand et al., 2005; 
Mielcarek et al., 2015). This could be because of the 
hyperexcitability of R6/2 muscle fibers causing an in-
crease in contractile activity and a subsequent transi-
tion in fiber type from 2b toward 2x or 2a. Indeed, in 
the R6/2 mice, there was a pronounced reduction in 
the expression of the fastest MyHC-2b isoform (see 
Fig. 10 C). This resulted in an elevation in the rela-
tive proportion of MyHC-1 and MyHC-2x mRNA pro-
portions (see Fig. 10 D). Thus, the TA muscle of R6/2 
mice appears to be undergoing a fast to slow shift, 
resulting from a dominant down-regulation in fast 
MyHC-2b isoform expression. These molecular 
changes would support the physiological data show-
ing a decreased time-to-peak tension and maximal 
shortening velocity in R6/2 mice compared with WT 
(Mielcarek et al., 2015). In apparent contrast, 
Chaturvedi et al. (2009) reported that R6/2 muscles 
showed an elevation in the expression MyHC-2b and 
a reduction in MyHC-1 consistent with a slow to fast 
shift in fiber type. However, these data were obtained 
from the slow soleus muscle, not the fast TA muscle 
used in this study. In addition, the expression of 
MyHC isoforms normally expressed during develop-
ment were not assessed by Chaturvedi et al. (2009). If 
skeletal muscles in R6/2 mice were less mature than 
WT, it might be expected that the muscles would ac-
quire an intermediate fiber phenotype, such that fast 
muscles (like the TA) would be slower (current data) 
and slow muscles (like the soleus) would be faster 
(Chaturvedi et al., 2009) than WT.
In Q175 mice, the trend toward higher levels of neo-
natal MyHC was particularly striking given that they 
were 12–15 mo old. This suggests that there may be a 
possible down-regulation of MyHC-2b with a corre-
sponding up-regulation of MyHC-neonatal, both of 
which are alternatively regulated. Normally, MyHC-2b is 
up-regulated during maturation and MyHC-neonatal is 
down-regulated, further supporting a disruption in HD 
skeletal muscle maturation. The Q175 data also suggest 
that a shift to isoforms normally expressed in earlier de-
velopmental states is relevant to adult-onset HD.
In total, the different conclusions regarding R6/2 
fiber type transitions may be explained by the per-
sistence of or a reversion toward a neonatal fiber type, 
as suggested by the presence of mRNA for neonatal my-
osin. Thus, a disruption of muscle maturation could 
partially explain these disparities.
The disruption in skeletal muscle maturation re-
ported here may be similar to the lack of neurogenesis 
found in the hippocampus of HD mouse models and 
HD patients (Gil et al., 2005; Orvoen et al., 2012). 
Moreover, a lack of growth, rather than degeneration of 
striatal neurons, has been observed in R6/2 mice (Rat-
tray et al., 2013). Similar observations have been made 
in other tissues such as the pancreas in HD (Björkqvist 
et al., 2005). Because of its abundance and high accessi-
bility, skeletal muscle may prove to be a very useful 
model for better understanding the changes in HD de-
velopmental states.
Relation to juvenile- and adult-onset HD
Analogous to R6/2 mice, the onset of overt symptoms 
in human juvenile-onset HD patients coincides with 
muscle maturation during adolescence. Perhaps sur-
prisingly, this disruption in muscle maturation appears 
relevant to adult-onset HD. We found reduced GClC-1 
and increased aberrantly spliced Clcn1 mRNA in skele-
tal muscle from the Q175 mice, a model for adult-onset 
HD. The mean GClC-1 value of 1-yr-old Q175 mice (1.1 ± 
0.1 mS/µF) reported here was similar to that of 12-wk-
old near-terminal R6/2 mice (1.0 ± 0.1 mS/µF), as we 
reported previously (Waters et al., 2013). However, the 
mean GClC-1 value of 1-yr-old WT Q175 littermates (1.4 ± 
0.1 mS/µF) was substantially lower than that of 12-wk-
old WT R6/2 littermates (2.4 ± 0.1 mS/µF), suggesting 
that GClC-1 may normally decrease with age. Strikingly, 
high levels of neonatal myosin in the 1-yr-old Q175 mice 
were also observed. The Q175 data suggest that a rever-
sion to earlier developmental states may occur in 
adult-onset HD. A time course study with the Q175 mice 
or another late-onset model will be needed to better ad-
dress muscle changes in adult HD.
Nuclear sequestration of MBNL1
For the first time in adult R6/2 skeletal muscle, we 
show abnormal nuclear sequestration of MBNL1 pro-
tein without predominate colocalization with CAG 
foci. It is unlikely that the threshold for detecting 
MBNL1 at the CAG repeat foci was low because small 
punctae of MBNL1 immunoreactivity were detectable

throughout the tissue. Our data suggest that a novel 
mechanism in addition to MBNL1 sequestration by 
CAG repeats may underlie the aberrant splicing of 
Clcn1 mRNA in R6/2 skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, 
the pathology likely involves MBNL1 because abnor-
mal aggregates of MBNL1 were present in R6/2 mus-
cle nuclei, and previous studies have shown colocalized 
MBNL1 and CAG repeats in fibroblasts and other in 
vitro systems of HD, including those that overexpress 
MBNL1 (de Mezer et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2015). Fu-
ture investigations will need to examine other 
RNA-binding factors in R6/2 muscle, such as the 
CELF family of proteins that includes the CUG-bind-
ing protein, CUG 
BP, and embryonically lethal abnor-
mal vision-type RNA-binding protein 3, ETR-3 (Ladd 
et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2013). The 
identity of the proteins involved in the mRNA process-
ing defects may depend on the age of the muscle.
Denervation
The phenotype of R6/2 skeletal muscle has been de-
scribed as denervation like (Ribchester et al., 2004), 
and a recent study has further suggested that motor 
unit loss and denervation drive the changes in mus-
cle excitability by measuring changes in muscle con-
tractility during step changes in motor neuron 
excitation (Mielcarek et al., 2015). Contradicting the 
denervation idea is that a morphological analysis of 
R6/2 mouse neuromuscular junctions showed de-
fects in only a very small fraction of neuromuscular 
junctions (Ribchester et al., 2004). A more recent 
study has also reported morphological changes, in-
cluding vesicle shape at the neuromuscular junction 
of R6/2 mice, but showed no clear evidence of dener-
vation (de Aragão et al., 2016). Moreover, re-innerva-
tion after crushing the motor neuron was normal in 
R6/2 skeletal muscle (Ribchester et al., 2004). The 
results of our study are also not easy to reconcile with 
denervation, or at least significant denervation. De-
nervation would need to occur before 5 wk of age in 
the R6/2 mice and cause no symptoms in order to 
drive the muscle defects observed. Perhaps the 
changes in muscle contractility with varying nerve 
stimulation recently reported (Mielcarek et al., 2015) 
were the result of motor neuron hyperexcitability, as 
has been observed in skeletal muscle in this article 
and previously (Waters et al., 2013) and in striatal 
neurons (Ariano et al., 2005). Alternatively, changes 
in muscle fiber types and/or motor neuron func-
tional characteristics could contribute to the changes 
in contractility. Ultimately, a functional examination 
of neuromuscular transmission, under voltage-clamp 
conditions (to eliminate the effects caused by changes 
in passive muscle membrane properties) will be 
needed to determine the contribution of any presyn-
aptic defects to HD skeletal muscle.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate the presence of progressive 
skeletal muscle defects that begin before the onset of 
motor symptoms in R6/2 mice. We also made the novel 
observation that there is a disruption in muscle matura-
tion, as indicated by the elevation in neonatal MyHC 
mRNA and a developmental Clcn1 mRNA splice variant 
in both R6/2 and Q175 models of HD. Additionally, we 
show that the mRNA processing defects in R6/2 mice 
may be distinct from what has been demonstrated in 
myotonic dystrophy, type 1. The aberrant splicing of 
gene transcripts has been observed in HD patients (Lin 
et al., 2016) as well as patients with fragile x-associated 
tremor/ataxia syndrome (Sellier et al., 2010), another 
trinucleotide repeat disease. In both diseases, the splic-
ing defects were found in brain tissue, suggesting that 
the defects in R6/2 skeletal muscle are applicable to 
multiple tissues and humans.
The results reported herein support that HD is a my-
opathy in addition to a neurodegenerative disease and 
may provide a new opportunity to improve patient care 
by targeting skeletal muscle tissue. Current methods for 
assessing HD progression in patients involve costly MRI 
and PET scans (Niccolini et al., 2015). Because of their 
early presentation, these defects in skeletal muscle may 
serve as highly accessible biomarkers of disease. In addi-
tion to biomarkers, new therapeutic targets can be de-
veloped to decrease hyperexcitability in HD skeletal 
muscle. For example, retigabine, which activates potas-
sium channels (KCNQ) and reduces hyperexcitability, 
has been shown to improve locomotor activity in R6/2 
mice (Cao et al., 2015). In addition to acting on striatal 
neurons, retigabine may improve locomotor function 
by reducing hyperexcitability in skeletal muscle. Al-
though CNS dysfunction is the primary target for cur-
rent therapeutic strategies, the results in this study 
highlight that HD is a multi-system disease and justifies 
the necessity for more systemic approaches to cure 
and/or delay HD symptoms.
