Introduction: Visits to the emergency department (ED) for use of illicit drugs and opioids have 
increased in the past decade. In the ED, little is known about how gender may play a role in drug-
related visits and referrals to treatment. This study performs gender-based comparison analyses of 
drug-related ED visits nationwide. 
Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data collected from 2004 to 2011 by the 
Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). All data were coded to capture major drug categories and 
opioids. We used logistic regression models to find associations between gender and odds of 
referral to treatment programs. A second set of models were controlled for patient “seeking detox,” or 
patient explicitly requesting for detox referral.
Results: Of the 27.9 million ED visits related to drug use in the DAWN database, visits by men 
were 2.69 times more likely to involve illicit drugs than visits by women (95% CI [2.56, 2.80]). Men 
were more likely than women to be referred to detox programs for any illicit drugs (OR 1.12, 95% 
CI [1.02-1.22]), for each of the major illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine: OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.15-1.40]), and 
for prescription opioids (OR 1.30, 95% CI [1.17-1.43]). This significant association prevailed after 
controlling for “seeking detox.” 
Conclusion: Women are less likely to receive referrals to detox programs than men when 
presenting to the ED regardless of whether they are “seeking detox.” Future research may help 
determine the cause for this gender-based difference and its significance for healthcare costs and 
health outcomes. [West J Emerg Med. 2016;17(3):295–301.]
INTRODUCTION
Visits to the emergency department (ED) for use of 
illicit drug and misuse of opioid analgesic have increased 
disproportionately among certain sub-populations during the 
past decade.1,2 The number of ED visits for nonmedical use 
of opioid analgesics increased by 111% between 2004 and 
20083 in the setting of marked increase in opioid prescriptions 
from both primary care and ED.4 Interestingly, a clear 
gender-specific pattern has emerged from the epidemiologic 
data on opioid overdoses: the rate of drug overdose deaths

Medicine, Providence, Rhode Island
increased 500% in women over the past decade, compared 
to a 360% increase in men.3 Drug use in the ED population 
is associated with high prevalence of comorbid conditions, 
injuries, high recidivism, morbidity, and mortality.5 Thus, the 
ED is an important point of contact for providing standardized 
screening, brief interventions and referrals to treatment 
(SBIRT) for drug use.6 
In the face of modest outcomes from existing ED SBIRT 
studies, investigators have been turning to more targeted 
programs, reasoning that subgroups of patients might have

different motivations for and barriers to changing drug use, 
responsiveness to specific intervention elements, and referral 
needs. Designing interventions based on gender is one 
promising avenue: gender is one of the most influential factors 
in determining trajectory of drug use disorders, accessing 
treatments, and achieving recovery.7-10 Outside the ED setting, 
a number of successful programs have been developed 
specifically targeting subgroups of men and women.11 
Developing gender-specific interventions for the ED will 
require a better understanding of how men and women differ 
on various aspects of ED care. Frequently, studies include 
gender as a covariate but do not stratify samples or examine 
interactions between gender and other demographic or clinical 
variables; many studies explicitly studying gender are likely 
underpowered to detect differences between genders. Overall, 
there are few data on ED utilization by men and women 
with drug misuse and clinical outcomes of visits. As the 
opioid epidemic has demonstrated, following gender-related 
trends over time can shine a light on clinical problems that 
are manifesting in gender-specific or gender-sensitive ways, 
which in turn may represent gender-related vulnerabilities to 
adverse clinical consequences or special needs for prevention 
or treatment. Although there have been gender-based 
comparisons of utilization of substance-use treatment facilities 
and treatment outcomes,12,13 we know little about how 
treatment entry is facilitated and any gender disparity therein. 
The importance of emergency care research focused on 
gender disparities in patterns of referrals to substance-abuse 
treatments has been identified as a national priority.14 
Our objective was to perform a gender-based comparative 
analysis of drug-related ED visits using a nationally 
representative database, Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration (SAMHSA)’s Drug Abuse Warning Network 
(DAWN). Objectives were to examine, by gender the 
following: 1) rates of presentations and dispositions of patients 
presenting with use of major illicit drugs and nonmedical 
use of prescription opioids; 2) trends in drug-related visits 
over time; 3) patterns of referral to outpatient therapy upon 
discharge referred to as “detox referrals.”
METHODS
DAWN is a nationally representative sample of ED 
visits to hospitals throughout the 50 states of the U.S.15 
DAWN includes non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical 
and medical hospitals with a 24-hour ED.15 A retrospective 
chart review was performed by a trained DAWN reporter 
at each hospital. ED visits in which drug ingestion was 
the direct cause or contributing factor of the visit were 
identified.15 ED visits were codified based on a standardized 
algorithm – a “DAWN Decision Tree” – available in the 
DAWN Methodology Report.16 ED visits reportable to 
DAWN involve not only all forms of drug misuse and abuse 
but also adverse reactions, accidental ingestions, and visits 
where patients were seeking detox services.15 All drugs are 
classified based on DAWN Drug Reference Vocabulary, a drug 
coding system based on Multum Lexicon, © 2012.15 “Illicit” 
drugs are defined as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic 
cannabinoids, amphetamines, methamphetamine, Ecstasy 
(MDMA), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), flunitrazepam 
(Rohypnol®), ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 
phencyclidine (PCP), hallucinogens, or substances inhaled for 
psychotropic properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue). 
Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals include misuse or abuse 
of prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, 
or dietary supplements that result from taking higher-than-
prescribed dose, taking pharmaceuticals prescribed to another 
individuals, or malicious poisoning by another individual.15 
This analysis used all available DAWN data, from 2004 
to 2011, when data collection was terminated due to limited 
funding. Across the years, 2.6 million drug-related ED visits 
were identified: Applying post-stratified weights, these cases 
extrapolated to an estimate of 27.9 million drug-related ED 
visits out of an estimated 937 million total visits. DAWN 
captures limited data on individual visits, including age, 
gender, race, and disposition categories. It does not capture 
admission diagnoses, measures of illness severity, procedures 
performed, or length of stay. 
Our analysis was restricted to adult patients (≥18 years of 
age). Individual drug types reported in the DAWN database 
were reviewed by the authors and further coded into categories 
of the following: 1) cocaine, 2) hallucinogens, 3) heroin, 4) 
marijuana; 5) methamphetamines; and 6) any illicit drug. We 
coded separately recreational drugs not clearly falling into 
one of these categories but included in DAWN’s definition of 
“illicit drugs” (e.g., cathinone and GHB). Drug combinations 
(such as cocaine/heroin) were placed in both categories. A 
single code for “any illicit drug use” was created that was 
positive if any of the previous drug categories were present 
and reflect “illicit drugs” defined by DAWN. We also created 
a variable for all prescription opioids that were included in 
the database for nonmedical use. All drug names under each 
category were reviewed by the authors, and any discrepancies 
between the two authors’ lists were resolved by using a 
toxicology database. Alcohol was a pre-defined variable in the 
DAWN database and only included underage drinking. Other 
variables of interest extracted for this study included gender, 
age, race, and clinical disposition, including 1) hospital 
admission or transfer; 2) intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 
3) referral to outpatient detoxification; 4) admission for 
inpatient detoxification; and 5) psychiatric care. 
As this study used only existing, publically available, 
de-identified data, it was exempt from institutional review 
board review.
Data Analysis
We calculated proportions for demographic and drug use 
variables. The proportions for men and women were compared 
using unadjusted odds ratios.

Gender Differences in Emergency Department Utilization
Trends over time were presented graphically and 
examined using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, 
TX). We developed logistic regression models to test for 
associations between gender and the binary outcome of 
referral to substance-use treatment programs among patients 
discharged from the ED. The first model adjusted for age, 
race, number of involved substances, and the time of day of 
the visit. These variables were determined a priori based on 
previous studies as characteristics available in the DAWN 
database that could potentially confound the effect of 
gender.17-23 The second model additionally included the chief 
complaint of “seeking detox.” This variable was selected 
after noting a difference between proportions of men and 
women “seeking detox” in the univariate analysis. Model 
variables were examined for evidence of collinearity with 
variance inflation factors (VIF), as high multicollinearity 
may lead to increased variance of model coefficients. 
Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for which the 95% CI did not 
cross the null value of aOR=1.0 were considered statistically 
significant. For all analyses, we used “svy” commands in 
Stata to account for weights and clustering and to obtain 
accurate point estimates, standard errors, confidence 
intervals and tests of hypothesis. These have been described 
in previous studies.24 Model fit was evaluated using Hosmer-
Lemeshow goodness of fit statistics. 
RESULTS
Of the 27.9 million ED visits related to drug use in the 
DAWN database 2004 to 2011, visits by men were 2.69 times 
more likely to involve illicit drugs than visits by women 
(95% CI [2.56, 2.80]). For every major category of illicit 
drugs, visits by men were more likely than visits by women to 
involve the illicit drug (Table 1).Visits by men were less likely 
to involve patients that were White (OR=0.75; 95% CI [0.70, 
0.81]) and ages >55 years old (OR=0.75; 95% CI [0.72, 0.79]) 
as compared to women (Table 1). 
Gender differences were observed in the ultimate 
disposition of ED patients presenting with drug use. ED visits 
by men were more likely than visits by women to result in 
hospital admissions with odds ratio of 1.19 (95% CI [1.14, 
1.24]) (Table 1). Among discharged patients, men were 1.90 
times more likely than women to receive detox referrals (95% 
CI [1.72, 2.09]) (Table 1). Among those seeking detox, 23.1% 
(95% CI [19.0, 27.2]) of women actually received referrals 
to detox compared to 24.5% (95% CI [20.7, 28.3]) of men. 
Conversely, among those discharged with detox referrals, 
33.2% (95% CI [29.4, 37.1]) of women were “seeking detox” 
compared 41.4% (95% CI [38.2, 44.6]) of men. In other 
words, although a similar proportion of male and female 
patients “seeking detox” received detox referrals, “seeking 
detox” constituted a smaller proportion of women receiving 
referrals as compared to men. 
For most years from 2004 to 2011, visits by male 
patients were significantly more likely to involve any illicit 
drug use, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, as compared to 
women (Figure 1). Men and women had similar rates of visits 
involving hallucinogens, methamphetamines, and prescription 
opioids across all years studied (Figure 1). No significant 
changes in numbers of visits were found across the years for 
visits involving either male or female patients (Figure 1).
In logistic regression analysis, men were more likely than 
women to be referred to detox programs for any illicit drugs, 
each of the illicit drug categories, as well as prescription 
opioids (Table 2). This significant gender-based difference in 
detox referrals remained after adjusting for “seeking detox” 
for all categories of drugs, except for the combined category 
of “all illicit drugs” (Table 2). The VIFs were near unity, 
supporting lack of collinearity (Table 2). 
DISCUSSION
Approximately 23.9 million Americans aged 12 or 
older are current users of illicit drugs and the proportion 
of women using illicit drugs is growing faster than men.25 
Women face many gender-specific barriers to treatment 
such as financial dependence, family responsibilities, and 
more frequent self-reports of shame and stigma.7 Given 
the potentially high impact of substance-abuse treatments, 
improving access to treatment services–particularly for 
women–is a public health priority. 
Visits to the ED by women involving substance abuse 
present an opportunity to connect them to substance-use 
treatment and other mental health resources and address any 
existing barriers to accessing these resources. The DAWN 
database, however, demonstrates that nationwide, women 
are less likely than men to receive referrals to treatment 
for use of illicit drugs or misuse of prescription opioids. 
There are a number of potential causes for gender-based 
difference in referrals, including severity of drug use, 
comorbid conditions, patient motivation, and physician 
biases. The current literature, however, suggests that many 
of these factors should result in higher rate of treatment 
referrals for female than male patients. In particular, past 
studies have shown that women have greater severity of 
substance abuse upon presentation to treatment,7 and faster 
progression to dependence, also known as “telescoping.”8-10 
The addiction literature also demonstrates that women are 
more likely to suffer from comorbid psychiatric conditions 
such as depression and anxiety and other health-related 
consequences than men; it is likely that women have 
greater needs for dual substance-use and mental healthcare 
facilities, which would address these interrelated problems 
simultaneously. Overall, these findings suggest that severity 
of drug use and comorbid conditions should have prompted 
more treatment referrals for women than men. 
Our analysis indicates that patient motivation could have 
played a role in the fact that referrals were given more often 
to men than women. Although similar proportion of men and 
women “seeking detox” actually received detox referrals,

more men than women with detox referrals were “seeking 
detox.” This descriptive finding suggests that motivation 
may play a larger role in obtaining referrals to treatments 
for men than for women. The regression model, however, 
demonstrates a greater rate of treatment referrals for men 
even after controlling for the chief complaint “seeking detox” 
for all drug categories. This finding suggests that lower rate 
of explicit request for treatment services by women may not 
entirely account for their lower rate of detox referrals for most 
categories of illicit drugs. On the other hand, men and women 
had similar rate of detox referral for “all illicit drugs” after 
controlling for “seeking detox.” One potential explanation is 
that “seeking detox” was an important reason for receiving 
detox referrals for patients using drugs that are part of “all 
illicit drugs” but not coded as major categories of illicit drugs, 
such as GHB, LSD, and PCP. 
Prior studies have demonstrated physician bias in 
screening for substance use in the emergency setting.10,26 
Similarly, past literature regarding alcohol treatment suggests 
that women are less likely than men to receive physician 
referrals to treatment centers.7,27 The higher prevalence of 
ED visits involving drug use among men as well as the 
higher admission rates found in DAWN database suggest 
that emergency physicians may be more aware of significant 
substance use among their male patients, and thus more 
vigilant about providing detox referrals for them. Physician- 
and healthcare-related barriers to detox referrals for women 
and interventions to overcome these barriers are important 
areas for future research.
Overall, the rate of referrals was very low: only 3.2% 
in women and 5.9% in men of those presenting with drug 
use problems. Although our analysis indicates that women 
are less likely than men to receive referrals, it is important 
to note that both genders have low rates of referrals and 
may therefore both be likely to face significant barriers to 
treatment. The low rate of referrals is consistent with past 
studies that have found that 27% of ED patients had unmet 
substance-abuse treatment needs28. The low rate of referrals 
reflects, in part, that the baseline population includes those 
who clearly did not present with drug abuse, such as those 
with accidental ingestions or adverse reactions. However, 
it may also demonstrate the limited availability of and 
referral to substance-use treatment programs, particularly 
for patients who are uninsured. Other barriers may 
include cost, lack of transportation, other family or work 
responsibilities, lack of information, functional differences 
arising from psychiatric illness, or domestic violence.7,26 It 
is also plausible that many of the patients presented with 
low amounts of drug abuse and were deemed not at risk 
enough to receive a referral. However, there is no “safe” or 
“low risk” amount of illicit drug use or nonmedical use of 
prescription drugs ,and virtually all illicit drug users should 
receive some type of referral. 
Over the past 40 years, there has been a dramatic 
improvement in the recognition of the specific needs of 
women with substance use disorders and the development 
of women-focused substance-abuse treatment programs7. 
Data from the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation 
Survey (NTIES), a study of publically-funded substance-use 
treatment units nationwide, demonstrated that women are 
more likely than men to receive individualized counseling 
and access-related services such as transportation and child 
care.29 Compared to men, women have comparable treatment 
retention, similar reductions in post-treatment substance 
abuse,20,29-32 and are less likely to experience relapse.33,34 
Despite these advances, our analysis suggests that referrals in 
the ED may lag in recognition of substance use in women as 
suggested by our analysis and serve as a potential barrier to 
accessing substance-use treatments that have otherwise been 
shown to be efficacious for women. 
LIMITATIONS
Although the DAWN database is a useful resource for 
nationally representative drug-related ED visits, there are 
several limitations. The DAWN database relies on diagnosis of 
illicit drug use or misuse of opioids by ED physicians. Future 
studies with patients’ reports of illicit drug use and nonmedical 
use of opioids are needed to determine whether the gender 
disparity reflects the actual prevalence of drug use by patients 
in the ED or differences in the recognition of drug use by 
emergency physicians. The DAWN database was created as 
ED, emergency department

a surveillance system to monitor trends of drug use over time 
and thus poses several challenges in answering our clinical 
research question of gender differences in ED visits and detox 
referrals. Because the cases reportable to the DAWN database 
include only visits involving drug misuse, proportions are 
expressed as a percentage of DAWN cases rather than total 
ED visits. This does not allow estimation of the proportion of 
total visits with illicit drug use and may inaccurately reflect the 
differences between genders; specifically, it is vulnerable to 
underestimating visits by female patients, who are less likely 
to be identified as using illicit drugs10. The inherent limitations 
of data captured by the DAWN database also do not allow 
more in-depth inquiry regarding the severity of illness, patient 
level factors such as past drug abuse, socioeconomic status, 
or physical or mental health comorbidities, or physician-level 
reasons for failing to provide detox referrals. DAWN is not 
clear whether a referral to a dual diagnosis treatment center – 
a resource potentially more relevant to women than men, as 
discussed above – would have been captured as a referral to 
a substance-use treatment center; if dual diagnosis referrals 
were not categorized as substance-use treatment, this could 
lead to a systematic bias underestimating resources provided 
to women. It is unclear whether physicians did not recommend 
detox or whether the patient refused detox despite being offered 
a referral. A study with prospective data collection focused on 
capturing these details that were omitted in DAWN could better 
identify contributing factors to a detox referral or lack thereof. 
“Seeking detox” in the DAWN database is also a heterogeneous 
definition and includes a wide range of causes, such as 
experiencing withdrawal and request for medical clearance 
before entering jail or a detox program. More research is needed 
to investigate each cause for seeking detox and the impact of 
patient motivation in receiving referrals to detox. Specifically, 
future studies should stratify specific motivations for seeking 
detox (e.g., medical clearance for jail or for withdrawal 
symptoms) and their impact on detox referrals. 
CONCLUSION
The DAWN database suggests that nationwide, women 
are less likely to present to the ED and receive detox referrals 
for illicit drug use or nonmedical use of prescription opioids 
compared to men. Future research is needed to determine the 
cause for this disparity, including more in-depth investigation 
of patient- and physician-level factors leading to referral, its 
significance to clinical outcomes, and whether increasing 
referrals to detox programs for women in the ED may improve 
substance-abuse treatment use and other patient-centered 
patient outcomes.
