Abstract
Background
In polypharmacy patients under home health management, pharmacogenetic testing cou-
pled with guidance from a clinical decision support tool (CDST) on reducing drug, gene, and
cumulative interaction risk may provide valuable insights in prescription drug treatment,
reducing re-hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits. We assessed the clinical
impact of pharmacogenetic profiling integrating binary and cumulative drug and gene inter-
action warnings on home health polypharmacy patients.
Methods and findings
This prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted at one hospital-
based home health agency between February 2015 and February 2016. Recruitment came
from patient referrals to home health at hospital discharge. Eligible patients were aged 50
years and older and taking or initiating treatment with medications with potential or signifi-
cant drug-gene-based interactions. Subjects (n = 110) were randomized to pharmacoge-
netic profiling (n = 57). The study pharmacist reviewed drug-drug, drug-gene, and
cumulative drug and/or gene interactions using the YouScript® CDST to provide drug ther-
apy recommendations to clinicians. The control group (n = 53) received treatment as usual
including pharmacist guided medication management using a standard drug information
resource. The primary outcome measure was the number of re-hospitalizations and ED vis-
its at 30 and 60 days after discharge from the hospital.
The mean number of re-hospitalizations per patient in the tested vs. untested group was
0.25 vs. 0.38 at 30 days (relative risk (RR), 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32–1.28;
P = 0.21) and 0.33 vs. 0.70 at 60 days following enrollment (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27–0.82;
P = 0.007). The mean number of ED visits per patient in the tested vs. untested group was

days (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.99; P = 0.045). Differences in composite outcomes at 60
days (exploratory endpoints) were also found. Of the total 124 drug therapy recommenda-
tions passed on to clinicians, 96 (77%) were followed. These findings should be verified with
additional prospective confirmatory studies involving real-world applications in larger popu-
lations to broaden acceptance in routine clinical practice.
Conclusions
Pharmacogenetic testing of polypharmacy patients aged 50 and older, supported by an
appropriate CDST, considerably reduced re-hospitalizations and ED visits at 60 days fol-
lowing enrollment resulting in potential health resource utilization savings and improved
healthcare.

Introduction
In 2013, Home Health Agencies (HHAs) provided services to about 3.5 million Medicare ben-
eficiaries, and Medicare spent about $18 billion on home health services [1]. Most patients
receiving home health care are elderly, take multiple medications, and experience poor com-
pliance due to a number of issues, primarily adverse drug events (ADEs). This often leads to
emergency department (ED) visits, re-hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life. With
trends toward bundling of post-inpatient services, penalties for readmissions, and integration
into Accountable Care Organizations, there is increased interest in hospitals co-managing or
even acquiring home health providers. There is hope that innovative medical management can
improve outcomes and reduce costs.
Medication-related problems are defined as circumstances during drug treatment that actu-
ally or potentially interfere with optimal care outcomes [2]. They are common among poly-
pharmacy patients taking multiple medications and can cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs),
which are adverse drug events (ADEs) at normal doses for approved uses. For example, rou-
tinely prescribed psychiatric medications are a common cause of ADR-driven ED visits [3].
Pharmacogenetic variation also leads to ADRs, including single drug-gene interactions (DGIs)
and cumulative drug-drug-gene Interactions (DDGIs). More than 85% of patients have signifi-
cant genetic variation in the cytochrome P-450 (CYP 450) genes that metabolize the majority
of the most commonly prescribed medications [4, 5]. Genetic variance among patients who
are abnormal metabolizers compounds the potential risk for ADRs and often results in
decreased efficacy [6, 7]. Both drug-drug and drug-gene medication related problems rise with
polypharmacy, and two-thirds of adults over age 65 use one or more prescription drugs daily
[8–10]. An estimated 35% of seniors experience ADEs, nearly half of these preventable [10]
and 10–17% of hospitalizations of older patients are directly related to ADRs [11]. Addition-
ally, patients aged 60 years and older account for 51% of ADR-related deaths [12, 13].
Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to predict and reduce unnecessary drug-related
adverse reactions and its value has been shown in clinical trials in psychiatry [14]. Based on
these results, we believe that adding pharmacogenetic and cumulative information warnings

 to drug interaction clinical decision support tools (CDST) available to pharmacists could be
useful in managing polypharmacy elderly patients. Interactions involving genes cause approxi-
mately 47% (25% were DGIs and 22% were DDGIs) of significant interaction warnings that
can lead to side effects and ADRs [15, 16].
Knowledge of a patient’s pharmacogenetic profile and gene-based ADR susceptibility
allows clinicians to make medication therapy decisions specific to each patient leading to bet-
ter outcomes such as decreased pill burden, improvement of disease state, decreased ADRs,
and increased quality of life. However, controlled trials of integrated pharmacogenetic infor-
mation in a broad polypharmacy population have been lacking. Pharmacogenetic profiling
reduced hospitalizations (39%) and ED visits (71%) in a prospective registry study in an ambu-
latory Medicare-age polypharmacy population [17]. Therefore, we undertook a randomized
controlled trial in a high-risk population of chronically ill patients aged 50 years and older
admitted to home health care after an inpatient hospitalization. The trial was designed to add
pharmacogenetic data in an integrated clinical information system compared to a standard
drug information system. In addition to re-hospitalization and ED visit metrics; we examined
secondary endpoints including death and Medicare administrative quality measures.
Methods
The home health trial was approved by the Harding University Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization
guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), and the Code of Federal Regulations on the
Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46) and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, num-
ber NCT02378220. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Setting, study population and recruitment
This pilot study was conducted at a hospital-based HHA in Searcy, Arkansas. The study popu-
lation was derived from patient referrals to home health upon hospital discharge. A pharmacist
and/or pharmacy intern performed chart reviews for every new patient admitted to home
health and the study investigator screened potential candidates from this allotment of patients.
Inclusion criteria were patients aged 50 years and older taking or initiating treatment with at
least one of fifty-five single ingredient or six medication combinations [17] with potential for
significant gene-based interactions defined by FDA boxed warning, FDA cautionary labeling,
clinical literature, or a YouScript1 CDST algorithm-predicted significant effect.
Exclusion criteria were the same for tested and untested groups and included patients previ-
ously tested for CYP 450, history of organ transplant, current malabsorption, treatment of
invasive solid tumors or hematologic malignancies in the last year, end stage renal disease or
current dialysis. Of 655 patients assessed for eligibility, 412 did not meet the inclusion criteria
and 133 patients declined to participate. (Fig 1).
Randomization and intervention
Prior to enrollment the treatment assignments were generated as a block random sample, with
50 patients assigned to each treatment arm in blocks of 100 patients. The randomization was
carried out in R version 3.1.1 (Vienna, Austria). The study statistician provided the principal
investigator with a list of 400 random assignments of potential study subjects that were ran-
domized in blocks of 100 (50 for each study arm within each block of 100.) Patients meeting
eligibility criteria were numbered chronologically based on the date of consent and were
assigned to each arm according to the randomization list. All patients in the tested group
received a physician order for pharmacogenetic testing. Patients were enrolled from February

 2015 to December 2015 and each patient was followed for 60 days from date of hospital dis-
charge with follow-up ending in February 2016. The study enrolled a total of 110 patients com-
prised of 53 controls and 57 interventional recipients.
Baseline data was extracted from patient charts and manually entered into the study data-
base. The study pharmacist reviewed drug-drug interactions (DDIs), DGIs, and cumulative
drug and/or gene interactions in the tested group using the YouScript1 generated reports and
CDST to provide drug therapy recommendations to clinicians, after which prescriptions were
altered at clinician discretion. Patients in the untested group were screened for DDIs using
standard drug information resources (Lexicomp) with recommendations acted on according
to clinician judgment. Time to change therapy was similar to those in the tested group.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes included the number of re-hospitalizations and ED visits at 30 and at
60 days. The exploratory outcomes included the time to the first re-hospitalization, time to the
first ED visit, number of falls during the study, deaths, scores on select Outcome and Assess-
ment Information Set (OASIS) quality metrics at 30 and 60 days, and clinical decision-making
(proportion of recommendations accepted by study pharmacist and passed on to clinicians
and the proportion of recommendations accepted by clinicians). The selected OASIS metrics
included overall status, pain, confusion, anxiety, disruptive behavior, assistance with activities

criteria and 133 patients either declined to participate, refused home health, already enrolled or the clinician would not
order pharmacogenetic testing. Of 110 randomly allocated patients, 53 patients in arm 1 were assigned to not receive

 of daily living, and depression. Data was extracted from the patient chart upon admission and
recorded using a case report form (CRF) at 30 days and 60 days. All data was manually entered
into the study database.
Genotyping and CDST
Buccal samples were obtained from eligible patients for determination of genotype and
shipped to Genelex Corporation (Seattle, WA). Genelex is accredited by the College of Ameri-
can Pathologists (CAP 1073709); certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA No. 50D0980559); is Washington State Medical Test Site No. MTS-
60353885; New York State Department of Health license no. PFI 8201; and licensed to perform
high complexity clinical testing in all US states. DNA extractions from buccal swabs were per-
formed using the MagJET genomic DNA extraction kit from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA).
Genotypes were obtained using a laboratory-developed, multiplex PCR based tests followed by
single base primer extension for variant detection by mass spectrometry (MassArray Analyzer
4 System, Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Pharmacogenetic testing included PCR based
assays to detect all common and rare variants with known clinical significance at analytical
sensitivity and specificity greater than 99% [18]. The tested alleles included CYP2C9:
�2,�3,�4,�5,�6,�8,�11,�13,�15; CYP2C19: �2,�3,�4,�5,�6,�7,�8,�9,�10,�12,�17; CYP2D6:
�2,�2A,�3,�4,�5,�6,�7,�8,�9,�10,�11,�12,�14, �15, �17,�19,�20,�29,�35,�36,�41, gene deletion and
duplications; CYP3A4: �22; CYP3A5: �3; and VKORC1: c.-1639G>A. The gene panel was
decided upon based on the high frequency of variation and the variety of common medica-
tions that it effects. The CYPs selected are the CYPs that have been shown to have a consistent
relationship with drug levels [4, 5, 19, 20]. The absence of a positive test result for all variants
listed results in the assignment of a �1 wild type status.
The pharmacogenetic definition (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) and
inferred phenotypes calling (ultrarapid, normal, intermediate and poor metabolizer) is consis-
tent with the recently published guidance for allele function status and phenotype [21]. Two
increased function alleles, or more than two normal function alleles were inferred as ultrarapid
metabolizer; combinations of normal function and decreased function alleles were inferred as
normal metabolizer; combinations of normal function, decreased function, and/or no function
alleles were inferred as intermediate metabolizer, and combinations of no function alleles were
inferred as poor metabolizer. In addition, the combinations of CYP2C19 normal function and
increased function allele was inferred as ultrarapid metabolizer; and the combinations of
CYP2C19 increased and no function allele were inferred as intermediate metabolizer based on
CYP2C19 published guidelines [22]. The CYP3A5 phenotype designations, non-expressers
(poor metabolizer), intermediate expressers (intermediate metabolizer) and expressers (nor-
mal metabolizer) are based on the CYP3A5 guidelines [23]. With respect to VKORC1, a com-
mon noncoding variant (c.-1639G>A, rs9923231) is significantly associated with warfarin
sensitivity and reduced dose requirements, as c.-1639A carriers require lower initial warfarin
doses than c.-1639G carriers [24].
Patient phenotypes and medication lists were analyzed by YouScript1 and verified by a
clinical pharmacist. YouScript1 is a CDST (S1 Appendix) that performs a comprehensive
analysis of patient medication regimen and their genetics using a proprietary algorithm and a
curated database of the primary literature to predict changes in drug levels [15, 16]. The report
(S1 Appendix) included type and date of sample collection, the tests conducted, the genotype
for each gene tested, the patient’s genetic phenotype for each gene tested, the medications the
patient was taking, and prescribing suggestions. YouScript1 also categorizes the type of inter-
action (DDI, DGI, and cumulative drug and/or gene interactions) and assigns a warning

 category. The strongest warning is “contraindicated” followed by “major”, “moderate” and
“minor” impact. Evidence-based medication or dose change guidance was provided for all
“contraindicated”, “major” and “moderate “warnings. Reports were reviewed by the study
pharmacist who provided final drug and dose change recommendations to fit patient needs
and forwarded to clinicians.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis compared the primary and exploratory outcomes between tested and
untested groups. Descriptive statistics are presented as means and ranges for count and
ordinal outcomes and as percentages for binary outcomes. All count outcomes were compared
between tested and untested groups using Poisson regression, and all Poisson regression mod-
els were diagnosed for over-dispersion. When over-dispersion was detected (p<0.05), the neg-
ative binomial regression was used instead of the Poisson regression. substantial The log-rank
test was used to compare time-to-event outcomes. The time-to-event outcomes were further
described using Kaplan-Meier estimates (curves and estimates at 30 and 60 days shown) and
hazard ratios estimated from the Cox proportional hazards model. Ordinal outcomes (OASIS
metrics and PHQ-2 scores) were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare the proportion of patient deaths. The effect on mortality was
expressed by a risk ratio calculated from a log-link generalized linear model (with confidence
interval calculated using profile likelihood from the model). Patient deaths and the composite
event outcomes (analyzed both as counts and times to the first event) were added post-hoc to
the exploratory outcomes. Composite event outcomes included re-hospitalizations + ED visits
+ deaths and re-hospitalizations + ED visits (where overlapping events were counted as one).
Both were compared at 30 and at 60 days and as the time to the first composite outcome event.
Calculations were carried out in R, version 3.2.3 (Vienna, Austria). All tests were two-sided.
P<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. As the study was designed as a pilot, tests
were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Results
A total of 57 tested patients were compared to 53 untested patients (Fig 1). Table 1 reports
patient demographics overall and for tested and untested groups. The mean (n = 110) age was
75.6 years and 81.8% of the patients were 65 years and older. The percentage of female patients
in the tested group and untested group were 56.1% and 67.9% respectively. The population in

 the area where the trial was conducted is predominately white—86.8% in 2010 [25]. The aver-
age pharmacogenetic risk, the likelihood that testing would reveal substantial gene based drug
interactions, for the tested and untested groups was 33.2% and 34.3% respectively. The mean
OASIS score for overall health at the start of intervention in the tested and untested groups
was 2.64 and 2.63 respectively (S1 Table).
Tables 2 and 3 compare primary and exploratory composite outcomes between the tested
group and the untested group at 30 and 60 days post-discharge. Reduction in the number of re-
hospitalizations, ED visits and in the composite number of outcomes were observed at 30 days.
At 60 days, primary and exploratory composite outcomes post-discharge were considerably
lower in the tested group. As shown in Table 2, at 60 days twenty-eight patients in the untested
group had no ED visit, while eighteen had one visit, five had two visits, one had three visits and

 one had four visits. In the tested group thirty-nine patients had no ED visits at 60 days while
fourteen had one visit and four had two visits. At 60 days thirty-one patients in the untested
group had no re-hospitalization, while thirteen had one re-hospitalization, three had two re-hos-
pitalizations and six had three re-hospitalizations. In the tested group forty-one patients had no
re-hospitalization at 60 days while fourteen had one re-hospitalization, one had two re-hospitali-
zations and one had three re-hospitalizations. As shown in Table 3, the mean number of out-
comes per patient in the tested vs. untested group for re-hospitalizations was 0.33 vs. 0.70
(relative risk (RR), 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27–0.82; p = 0.007); ED visits was 0.39
vs. 0.66 (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.99; p = 0.045); re-hospitalizations + ED visits was 0.54 vs. 1.04
(RR, 0.52; 95% C, 0.32–0.86; p = 0.01). The testing reduced the number of re-hospitalizations,
ED visits, and composite number of re-hospitalization + ED visits at 60 days by 52%, 42% and
48% respectively. The true re-hospitalization, ED visits, and composite number of re-hospitaliza-
tion + ED visits reduction in a population similar to this study will likely fall between 18% to
73%, 1% to 66%, and 14% to 68% (95% CI) respectively. Six deaths were observed in the untested
group versus one death in the tested group, an 85% reduction in the risk of death in the tested
group (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01–0.87; p = 0.054). At 60 days, the mean composite number of re-
hospitalizations + ED visits + deaths was 0.54 for the tested group versus 1.10 for the untested
group (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30–0.81; p = 0.005). For the composite exploratory outcomes at 60
days, the dispersion assumption was violated, so negative binomial regression was used instead.
At 30 days, tested group events were lower but the effect was smaller than at 60 days.
Table 4 compares the exploratory time-to-event outcomes between the tested and untested
groups at 30 days and 60 days. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.59 for time to the first re-hospitali-
zation and 0.60 for time to the first ED visit. The HR for the time-to-composite event out-
comes for re-hospitalizations + ED visits and re-hospitalizations + ED visits + deaths was 0.59
(95% CI, 0.34–1.02; P = 0.056) and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.33–0.99; P = 0.041), respectively. Fig 2A
and 2B presents the Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to first re-hospitalization and to the first
ED visits. At 60-days, the cumulative rate in the tested versus untested group for re-hospitaliza-
tion rate was 28% vs. 43% (log-rank test for the entire follow-up: P = 0.10); cumulative ED visit
rate was 32% vs. 49% (P = 0.09). Fig 2C and 2D presents the Kaplan-Meier curves for the time-
to-cumulative composite event outcomes for re-hospitalizations + ED visits and re-hospitaliza-
tions + ED visits + deaths.
The comparison of selected OASIS metrics between the tested and untested group is
addressed in S1 Table. Scores were evaluated and documented at time of admission to home
health, at 30 days, and at 60 days following enrollment for improvement in overall status, pain,
confusion, anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior, and the need for assistance with activities

and untested groups were relatively small. The mean number of falls per patient was 0.11 and
0.09 for the tested and untested groups respectively.
Tables 5 and 6 compare differences in the distribution of CYP 450 metabolic phenotypes,
and differences in the severity of DDI (binary and cumulative), DGI, or DDGI between this
home health trial and another published study population [16]. As seen in Table 5, for each of
the genes of interest a large fraction of patients were characterized as having a “risk phenotype”.
The phenotype breakdown of evaluated patients, by enzyme, was as follows: 42.9% were inter-
mediate or poor CYP2D6 metabolizers; 64.9% were intermediate, poor, or ultra-rapid CYP2C19
metabolizers; 29.8% were intermediate or poor CYP2C9 metabolizers; 10.5% intermediate
CYP3A4 metabolizers; and 12.3% were CYP3A5 intermediate expressers. The mean number of
all YouScript1 recommendations per patient in the tested group was 2.18 and the mean num-
ber of gene-based recommendations was 1.49. The percentage of tested patients showing overall

 YouScript1 interaction severity with “change or major” recommendations was 35.1% and with
“consider or moderate” recommendations was 21.1% (Table 6). YouScript1 recommendations
were accepted by the study pharmacist who reviewed the recommendations based on additional
patient factors and needs and then provided final recommendations to clinicians. Of the 124
recommendations passed on to clinicians, 96 were followed (77%), 6 were not followed (5%),
and 22 were unknown (18%). By unknown, it meant that it could not be determined whether
the reviewing physician followed a specific prescribing suggestion.
Discussion
Pharmacogenetic testing of genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes has the potential to
optimize medication prescribing, dosing, and monitoring by identifying metabolizer pheno-
type status. Although over 137 medications have pharmacogenetic considerations in their label
[20], the value of testing has yet to be established. Although some validation is needed, it
should be noted that approximately one-half of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the
United States undergo metabolism via CYP450 enzymes. Similar to creatinine clearance
(CrCl) rate as a biomarker of kidney function, CYP genetic status serves as a biomarker of the
patient’s ability to metabolize drugs via CYP450 enzymatic pathways. FDA guidance regarding
pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired renal function suggests that dosing recommenda-
tions be based on creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
other relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, such as area under the curve (AUC), half-life and

#When gene duplication is detected for CYP2D6 alleles of different activity (e.g. one inactive allele and one active allele), the technology cannot distinguish
which allele is duplicated and therefore cannot assign a definitive phenotype. There were 560 CYP2D6 phenotype results in the AJHP cohort and 1 result in
the Home Health Trial cohort affected by this, and they were omitted from this phenotype prevalence analysis.

 Cmax [26]. Similarly, patient CYP genetic status and the resulting alterations to CYP enzyme
activity are fundamental to understanding the AUC, half-life and Cmax which measure and
determine circulating drug levels. Older patients may realize a greater benefit from pharmaco-
genetic testing along with an appropriate CDST being at heightened risk for polypharmacy
and adverse medication outcomes [27]. This trial assessed the clinical impact of pharmacist
medication management with access to pharmacogenetic profiling integrated with cumulative
drug-gene interaction warnings (YouScript1 CDST). Inhibition of CYP enzymatic activity by
concomitant medication(s) can dramatically change a person’s metabolic capacity presenting
with a phenotype that does not match with the genetic phenotype [28]. YouScript1 algorithms
combine all drug-gene and drug-drug interactions to predict the cumulative effect of all inter-
acting components on an affected drug. This is important because normal and intermediate
metabolizers can be ‘phenoconverted’ to poor metabolizers. The phenotype prediction from
genotype data depends heavily on the allelic variants present in a population of interest and
the number of alleles being interrogated. An overestimate of the normal-function of CYPs is
likely to occur when a considerable number of no- and decreased-function alleles are missed.
In addition, other genetic, physiological, pathological, and environmental factors on CYP
expression and activity may also have an implication. Interpretation of the functional conse-
quences of predicted phenotypes for drug clearance in vivo, and thus translation into specific
dosing guidelines for individual drug-diplotype pairs, will benefit from future genotype-strati-
fied pharmacokinetic studies for high-priority drugs [29].
The study population was selected to have a higher than average return on pharmacogenetic
testing defined by the likely frequency of drugs interacting with CYPs. Patients who were aged
50 and older, enrolled in home health, and taking or initiating treatment with at least one med-
ication with a significant DDI or DGI as defined by FDA boxed warning, FDA cautionary
labeling, clinical literature or YouScript1 algorithm- predicted significant effect were
included. To verify patients were similar in each arm, the distribution of diagnosis (patient

 diseases, disorders and related health problems) and medication utilization between the tested
and untested groups were compared. The diagnosis results (S2 Table) showed significant dif-
ferences only in the frequency of the cerebrovascular conditions and eye diseases. Finding
statistically significant differences for two conditions is not unusual among twenty-six com-
parisons (1.3 such differences would be expected, on average.) Additionally, the frequencies of
these two conditions were higher in the tested group. Despite this, there was an overall reduc-
tion in ED visits and re-hospitalizations at 60 days. Therefore, not adjusting for this imbalance
appears to be, in fact, conservative. All other diseases, disorders and health related problems
between the two groups were not statistically significant and likely did not impact the pre-
sented outcomes of the study.
Home health patients are polypharmacy treated subjects; the average number of drugs per
patient in this study was 11.6. The average drug count at baseline (before pharmacogenetic
profiling based intervention) was relatively balanced between the tested and untested groups
(11.6 vs. 11.8; p = 0.6, two sample t-test). On comparing the frequency of drugs prescribed
between the two groups (S3 Table), no major difference were observed validating a relatively
good balance between the two arms. A major 52% reduction in the number of re-hospitaliza-
tions and a 42% reduction in the number of ED visits at 60 days post-discharge was observed
in the tested versus the untested group. This finding occurred in an HHA that, according to
2015 Home Health Quality Improvement reporting was in the 5th-12th-percentile group for
the CMS re-hospitalization benchmark. The HHA received 4.5 of 5 stars in the CMS Home
Health Compare rating.
Reducing rates of re-hospitalization has attracted attention from policymakers as a way to
improve quality of care and reduce costs. ED visits are also an important cause of morbidity,
and may often be caused by ADEs, particularly among patients aged 65 years and older [30].
Six deaths were observed in the untested group versus one death in the tested group, an 85%
reduction in the risk of death. However, because of the small sample size it is unclear if it was
directly related to pharmacogenetic-guided treatment. The death in the tested group occurred
before pharmacogenetic results were sent to the clinician.
The fact that most patients are not normal metabolizers for at least one CYP drug metabo-
lizing enzyme is extremely important when managing a patient medications. The wide range
of CYP isozyme-encoding gene variants suggests that a large number of DGIs and DDGIs
must go undetected without pharmacogenetic testing. The total number of patients with risk
phenotypes, as well as the incidence of DGIs and DDGIs identified, supports the use of risk-
based pharmacogenetic testing [16]. Interestingly, this study had many more severe interac-
tions (Table 6) than the Hocum et al study [16] likely because of higher average drug count
(11.6 vs. 8.2). In addition, the mean age, percentage of patients who were 65+ years, and the
racial differences were higher in this study (S4 Table). Also, the home health patients in this
study are all being released from the hospital to home health, so they tend to be less well than a
typical ambulatory patient.
The limitations of this study include small sample size, use of a randomized population
within one institution and undetermined impact of the genetic testing on patient-provider
interactions. Also, the average time to change drug therapy was approximately 3 weeks; only
one week short of the 30-day time point which could have impacted the time-to-event out-
come at 30 days. However, the benefits of pharmacogenetic profiling at 30 days are possible if
the average time to change therapy is shortened, but the impact is still less certain since in
some instances as it may take longer for the benefits of the intervention to materialize. This
study was planned as a pilot study and therefore no power calculations were carried out.
Despite the small size of the study, other factors such as age, gender, race and baseline health
status (OASIS) were relatively balanced between the two study arms. Because of this balance,

 the small size of the study and the type of the outcomes, the analyses were not adjusted for
covariates to avoid an increased type I error [31, 32]. When results were adjusted for categori-
cal age all p-values were smaller than the corresponding unadjusted p-values. The unadjusted
p-values presented in our results are thus appropriately more conservative compared to the
adjusted p-values. Actual cost and charge data was not available. Therefore, cost savings were
modeled based on Medicare average all-cause readmission [33] and ED visit cost [34], result-
ing in a $4382 per patient cost savings in 60 days (S5 Table) prior to the cost of intervention,
resulting in decreased healthcare resource utilization. Follow-up was limited to 60 days post-
discharge, but over time additional savings could increase the value obtained from the one-
time expense of testing as the results can be used for ongoing patient management. A recently
conducted cost-effectiveness analysis showed cost-savings when considering a one-time
genetic test to avoid lifetime ADRs [35].
In conclusion, we conducted a pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial
testing comprehensive medication management delivered by clinical pharmacists, incorporat-
ing pharmacogenetic testing along with appropriate CDST versus usual care. This home health
trial mirrored a previously published prospective observational study which demonstrated that
pharmacogenetic CYP testing of ambulatory elderly exposed to polypharmacy reduced hospi-
talizations by 39% and ED visits by 71% compared to a matched retrospective control cohort.
This study offers a potentially important opportunity to minimize ADEs and reduce health
resource utilization and marks an important step towards accomplishing the goals of the
Triple Aim (improved care of the individual, improved health of the patient population and
decreased per capital costs) [36]. To further validate these findings, additional prospective con-
firmatory studies involving real-world applications in larger populations in the same and alter-
nate settings are needed to broaden its acceptance in routine clinical practice.
