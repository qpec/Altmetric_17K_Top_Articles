Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs the flow of sensory and motor signals between the brain and the areas 
of the body located below the lesion level. Here, we describe a neurorehabilitation setup combining 
several approaches that were shown to have a positive effect in patients with SCI: gait training by means 
of non-invasive, surface functional electrical stimulation (sFes) of the lower-limbs, proprioceptive and 
tactile feedback, balance control through overground walking and cue-based decoding of cortical motor 
commands using a brain-machine interface (BMI). the central component of this new approach was the 
development of a novel muscle stimulation paradigm for step generation using 16 sFES channels taking 
all sub-phases of physiological gait into account. We also developed a new BMI protocol to identify left 
and right leg motor imagery that was used to trigger an sFes-generated step movement. our system 
was tested and validated with two patients with chronic paraplegia. these patients were able to walk 
safely with 65–70% body weight support, accumulating a total of 4,580 steps with this setup. We 
observed cardiovascular improvements and less dependency on walking assistance, but also partial 
neurological recovery in both patients, with substantial rates of motor improvement for one of them.
Every year, about 250,000–500,000 people worldwide suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI) as a result of traffic acci-
dents, falls, other traumatic accidents or violence1. SCI leads to severe impairments of the sensory, motor and 
autonomic functions below the lesion level, as well as secondary clinical conditions such as pressure ulcers, uri-
nary tract infections, and osteoporosis. In addition to the gravity of these clinical effects, SCI incurs substantial 
financial costs, both for the individual and society. For patients diagnosed with the most severe cases of SCI 
(patients presenting no motor functions below the lesion (AIS B) and patients presenting neither motor nor sen-
sory functions (AIS A)), at the chronic phase of the lesion (a year after the injury), the chances for a spontaneous 
recovery are negligible2,3. Up to now, there is no systematic approach to restoring neurological functions in such 
patients.
Over the past decades, a variety of new approaches for SCI rehabilitation have been introduced4,5. These efforts 
aimed at inducing activity-dependent plasticity5 by the utilization of robotic trainers6–8, epidural electrical stimu-
lation9–11, body-weight support trainers12, brain-machine interfaces11,13–15, transcranial magnetic stimulation16,17 
and surface functional electrical stimulation (sFES)18,19. Recently, our group has shown that a training proto-
col (the Walk Again NeuroRehabilitation protocol (WANR))14,20 ̶ induced a significant level of neurological

recovery in a group of eight subjects with chronic complete paraplegia (seven AIS A, one AIS B), by combin-
ing assisted walk training with robotic walkers, electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-machine interface 
(BMI), and continuous visuotactile feedback. Extending our previous findings, the present study describes our 
group’s effort to further enhance clinical neurological recovery in severe cases of SCI by providing more selec-
tive lower-limb musculoskeletal recruitment through sFES, while maintaining our fundamental philosophy of 
activating both ascending and descending neural pathways during the neurorehabilitation process. As such, the 
BFNR (BMI, sFES, NeuroRehabilitation) protocol described here integrates four key elements to potentiate recov-
ery in patients with SCI: muscle activation through sFES21–23 (see24 for a review), balance control through body 
weight support25, real-time decoding of motor command (BMI)14,20 and sensory feedback through a portable 
haptic device26.
In recent years, BMI-FES (systems that use BMI to detect patients’ voluntary motor commands to trigger 
their muscle contractions through an FES) have been extensively studied as rehabilitation tools (some research-
ers call it therapy or partial restoration) for patients with severe cases of stroke27–29, to potentiate recovery of 
upper-limb28,30,31 or lower-limb motor function32 (see33 for a review).
On the other hand, several studies with SCI patients have shown remarkable results when using BMI-sFES 
technology as an assistive device, by bypassing the spinal cord lesion and permitting the patient to perform motor 
functions34,35. However, to date, little is known about the potential of the BMI-sFES approach as a true rehabil-
itative tool/therapy for patients with SCI. To our knowledge, only one study with rats has rigorously tested this 
hypothesis: Bonizzato and colleagues15 recently showed that a training paradigm integrating BMI with epidural 
stimulation accelerated and enhanced the animal’s neurological recovery when compared to training that used 
only the epidural stimulation.
Here, we studied both the assistive and the restorative aspects of a novel BMI-sFES system with two patients 
with chronic SCI. First, we demonstrated the validity of each aspect of our approach: a custom 16 channel sFES 
system, a closed-loop proportional- integral (PI) controller to cope with muscle fatigue, the integration of a port-
able haptic device to cope with the lack of lower-limb sensory functions and a novel BMI protocol based on the 
detection of left and right leg motor imagery. Next, we tested our neurorehabilitation protocol with two patients 
with SCI (originally AIS A) who had been previously trained with the Walk Again Neurorehabilitation (WANR) 
protocol and, as a consequence, converted to AIS C20 (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). At the onset of the current 
protocol both patients presented motor functions more than three segments below the motor level (presence of 
knee extension (L3) for both patients); however, their overall motor score at that point in time was low (lower 
extremity motor score of 4 for P1 and 2 for P2 out of a maximum possible score of 50). To identify the effect of 
the BFNR protocol, we ran a series of neurological36, neurophysiological and functional (WISCI II)37 assessments 
at the onset and at the end of training. Overall, we observed a significant improvement in muscle responses and 
reduction of muscle fatigue in our two patients in response to the sFES. Patients also experienced an increase in 
muscle volume and functional improvement for walking (measured as the ability to walk 10 meters in full load, 
using only passive assistive devices, such as walkers, orthoses, and crutches). More remarkably, we also docu-
mented clinical neurological improvement in both patients. Indeed, one of these patients reached a substantial 
increase of 9 points for the lower extremity motor score (LEMS) after 22 sessions with the BFNR training.
Results
Two individuals with chronic paraplegia due to SCI, designated as P1 and P2 (40 and 32 years old; time since 
lesion: 4.5 and 10 years) with thoracic level injuries (patient P1 lesion at T7, and P2 at T4) were enrolled in our 
protocol (Supplementary Table S3). Before the sFES training, these patients had followed the WANR training for 
28 and 34 months14,20 respectively (Fig. 1A). Both patients had experienced sensory and motor improvements 
during the WANR and had been converted from AIS A to AIS C by the time of onset of the current protocol. 
First, we validated our setup for 6 months, for a total of 25 sessions, with patient P1. During this period, we tested 
our conditioning protocol (12 sessions), validated the closed-loop sFES stimulation (one session), validated the 
sFES-generated locomotion (10 sessions), and performed the integration of the tactile feedback with our training 
protocol (two sessions). Next, we tested the BFNR (BMI, sFES, NeuroRehabilitation) protocol with both patients. 
To isolate the effect of our training protocol, a 2-month washout period was given before the onset of the BFNR 
(Fig. 1A). The subjects did not receive any locomotion training, nor training in an upright position during this 
period. Clinical assessments, including the lower-limb circumference perimeter measurement38, evaluation of 
walking function with assistive devices37 and neurological status exam36 were performed before and after the 
training protocol for both patients (measurements M4 to M5). We also compared both patients’ neurological 
improvement rate during the BFNR protocol with their improvement during the WANR protocol (measurements 
M1 to M2 for P1, M1 to M3 for P2), as well as their spontaneous improvement measured before they started the 
WANR protocol (measurements M0 to M1). For patient P1, we also controlled for whether our pilot validation 
tests induced any changes (measurements M2 to M3).
The BFNR protocol was comprised of three basic phases: (1) lower-limb sFES conditioning (FC); (2) 
sFES-generated locomotion training (FL); and (3) brain-controlled sFES-generated locomotion (B + FL) 
(Fig. 1B). Patient P2 performed nine FC sessions, followed by four FL sessions, and then 10 B + FL sessions. One 
extra FL session was recorded after the fifth B + FL session for analyses of patients’ walking aptitude using the 
sFES. Patient P1, who had already followed a conditioning phase during the pilot validation phase, had two FC 
sessions followed by the same sequence of FL and B + FL sessions as patient P2.
During all BFNR phases we used a custom 16-channel sFES system39 targeting the following muscles in both 
legs (Fig. 1C): gluteus maximus (GMx), gluteus medius (Gmd), rectus femoris proximal (RFP), hamstrings (Hs), 
vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (Gs) and soleus (Sl).
During the FL and B + FL phases, patients were partially suspended (65–70%) with a body weight support 
system (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. S1) (Zero-G, Aretech LLC., Ashburn, VA). During their walking over a

four-meter-long linear track, patients assisted themselves with a low-cost walker. The session was supervised by 
a physiotherapist or a physician. The patients’ hip and knee joint angles were measured every 7 ms. A PI control-
ler adapted the stimulation amplitude in real-time to the muscle conditions determined by the lower-limb joint 
angles measurements. Two additional elements completed the setup: (a) a 16-channel EEG electrode (Fig. 1E) 
placed around the medial longitudinal fissure, densely clustered over the putative leg sensorimotor cortical area to 
detect the cortical activation for leg motor imagery; and (b) a portable haptic device26 that permitted the patients 
to perceive the position of the stimulated leg on their upper-arm (Fig. 1F). Continuous waves of tactile vibrations 
delivered to the patients’ forearms coincided with the stimulation of the lower-limb muscles to indicate the begin-
ning and end of the swing phase of a stride.
The preparation, followed by the training session, required approximatively 95 minutes, divided as follows: the 
sessions started with 15 minutes stretching, targeting both the upper-limbs, trunk, and lower-limb muscles. Next, 
approximately 35 minutes were used during the session preparation (placement of the EEG and sFES electrodes, 
placement of the position sensors and portable tactile feedback, placement of body weight support harness and 
moving patient to an upright position). The training lasted 45 minutes. We developed a novel sFES stimulation strat-
egy that used time-based muscle contractions considering the eight sub-phases40 of a physiological gait pattern41,42 
(Fig. 1G): (1) initial foot contact; (2) load response; (3) mid-stance; (4) terminal stance; (5) pre-swing; (6) initial 
swing; (7) mid-swing; and (8) terminal swing. To reproduce adequate gait during each sub-phase, we fine-tuned the 
stimulation time, the stimulation ramps up/down, the amplitude and the frequency for each muscle.

Number of sessions per training phase for the BFNR protocol. (C) Eight lower-limb muscles are bilaterally 
stimulated with the sFES: three muscles for hip mobilization (flexion, extension, and abduction), two for the 
knee (flexion and extension) and three for the ankle (one dorsiflexor and two plantar flexors). (D) Patients were 
secured by a body-weight support system (Zero-G, Aretech LLC., Ashburn, VA) and used a walker for stability. 
A stimulation model, containing a reference kinematic profile and gait phases (detailed in subfigure G), was used 
as a base for the feedforward current stimulation. Patients’ hip and knee angles were measured in real-time. The 
command of the Proportional Integral (PI) controller was computed based on the error (eθ
) between the current 
joint angle (θ
m) and the reference kinematics (θ
d). We used a sigmoid function to convert the PI command into 
feedback currents for the flexors (Iflex) and extensors muscles (Iext). The feedback and feedforward currents were 
summed to produce the actual values applied to the electrodes. (E) EEG electrodes were placed around the medial 
longitudinal fissure. Channel Fz was used as the reference and the Fpz as Gnd. Arm and leg sensorimotor areas are

pI controller validation. 
We introduced a PI controller to adapt the electrical stimulation pattern of the 
sFES system, based on muscle responses, to generate a reliable gait and cope with variance regarding muscle 
responsiveness and fatigue. To illustrate this effect, Fig. 2A compares the knee angle for patient P1 during a 
sFES-generated knee extension task in a seated position, when the PI controller was turned on (blue line) or off 
(grey line). To guarantee well-controlled conditions, only the knee joints were controlled for this test, while the 
other joints remained immobilized. In both conditions, the same desired target angle (black line) is used for com-
parison. The test was repeated with both patients. We found that the root mean square error (RMS) for the PI-on 
condition (left knee 8.2°, right knee 7.8°, for P1, 11.2° and 9.3° for P2) was significantly smaller compared to PI-off 
(left knee 14.5°, right knee 14.4° for P1, 15.5° and 17.6° for P2) (two-sided two-sample t-test attests the significant 
difference (t(110) = 15.13, p = 0 for P1; t(110) = 15.20, p = 0 for P2) (Fig. 2B). These findings confirm that the PI 
controller produced more reproducible responses to the patients even in the presence of muscular fatigue.
To cope with the increase in fatigue, the PI controller increased the amplitude of the stimulation for the last 
part of the sessions (Fig. 2C). The mean current employed was only 6% higher than in the PI-off condition for P1 
and 7.8% for P2. Considering the entire session, the mean currents for both conditions were comparable for both 
P1 (mean current of 49 mA for PI-on and 47 mA for PI-off), and P2 (42.51 mA PI-on, 39.96 PI-off), suggesting 
that the use of the PI did not notably increase the necessary current for stimulation.
sFes-Conditioning validation. 
The FC phase was introduced to delay the onset of muscle fatigue while 
increasing muscle responses. Three factors were gradually adjusted during this phase: the stimulation time, the 
amplitude and the number of muscles stimulated simultaneously. The first training session was set to 10 minutes 
whereas the following sessions were gradually increased up to 40 minutes. At the onset of the sessions, the stimu-
lation amplitude was set to the minimum current that produced a clear muscle contraction. Then, if the therapist 
observed a notable decrease in a given muscle response, the corresponding stimulation current was increased by 
5 mA (maximum: 100 mA).
An example of stimulation amplitude is shown for nine sessions of VL muscle for patient P1 (Fig. 2D). For 
session three, during the first 20 minutes of training, it was necessary to increase the current five times (from 
60 mA to 80 mA) to observe a muscle activation that led to an overt movement. On the following day, at the same 
moment throughout the session, only 70 mA were needed to generate the same response. This positive trend 
continued throughout the training. Thus, after the sixth session of conditioning, the patients’ VL muscle response 
did not decay after 40 minutes of stimulation at 60 mA.
We calculated the mean time before fatigue for all muscles during the first 20 minutes of the session. 
Considering only sessions that lasted 20 minutes or more (to avoid bias due to the session length), we observed a 
significant linear increase of the average time before fatigue (Fig. 2E, y = 0.62x + 11.03, P = 0.01), confirming that 
the patients’ muscle responses improved following FC sessions.
sFes stimulation strategy validation. 
Gait-analysis based on 3D construction of motion capture data of 
patient P2 revealed that the majority of the markers of the physiological walk were present (Fig. 2F, detailed anal-
ysis in Supplementary Fig. S2, Supplementary Video S1). Indeed, on initial contact, we observed the accurate hip 
flexion, and the expected neutral position for the knee and the ankle. Through the mid-stance phase, we observed 
an accurate, neutral position for both the hip, knee and ankle joints. For the pre-swing, as expected, we observed 
the flexion of both the hip and the knee and the ankle plantar-flexion. We documented the flexion of the hip 
and the knee during the initial swing, and a neutral position of the ankle during the mid-swing. On the terminal 
swing, the hip flexion was correctly maintained, the ankle was in neutral position, and the knee extended.
In three cases the range of motion was smaller than the normal gait: hip extension during the terminal-stance, 
the second peak of knee flexion during the swing phase, and the ankle dorsiflexion during mid and terminal 
stance. The hip extension and the ankle dorsiflexion limitations reduced the overall step length, whereas the lim-
itation on the knee flexion reduced the foot clearance during the swing. Nevertheless, none of these limitations 
was severe enough to compromise the patient’s gait.
We also wanted to be sure to use the fastest walking pace, to maximize the number of steps per session, while 
guaranteeing a comfortable and safe training environment for the patients. We performed a systematic evalua-
tion of the maximum comfortable speed during six sessions with patient P1. For each run of 12 steps, we varied 
the speed and asked the patient whether the run was comfortable or not and whether the run was the patient’s 
favorite among the ones achieved in the current session. The patient was told before the session that the speed 
could change from one run to another, but no further information was given during the session. Over time, the 
patient reported feeling comfortable with speeds that were gradually increased (Fig. 2H); while the threshold for 
comfortable speed was between 6 and 8 seconds per step (s/step) during session seven, it reached a maximum of 
3 s/step on the 10th session. By then, the preferred speed improved from 8 s/step to 3 s/step.

Haptic feedback validation. 
SCI induces a loss of tactile and proprioceptive feedback information that 
is needed to generate a correct walking pattern43,44. To overcome this limitation, we integrated a portable haptic 
device, developed by our group (named the tactile shirt)26, composed of arrays of vibrators to display relevant 
events using a tactile illusion called the apparent movement45.
We ran two sessions with patient P1 to evaluate the difference of behavior in the presence or absence of the 
tactile feedback (Fig. 2I). An expert physiotherapist, blinded to the conditions of the experiment used an 11-item 
visual assessment developed by our team to evaluate differences in terms of the patient’s adaptation to our loco-
motion training setup (questions 1–5) and the patient’s gait kinematics during the sFES-generated locomotion 
(questions 6–11) (Supplementary Table S4 for details). The presence of the tactile shirt did not positively or nega-
tively influence the patient’s trunk alignment, his need for compensatory movements, or his coordination with the 
walker. As expected, neither did we observe any substantial difference in any of the kinematic-related questions: 
the presence of the tactile feedback did not change the patient’s muscle responses during the stance (questions 
6–8), or the swing (questions 9–11) phases.
On the other hand, we observed that the patient developed a tendency to look less at his own body during the 
walk when the tactile feedback was present (question 4). This phenomenon allowed patients to express a better 
understanding of the position of the leg in space, as well as the movement of the lower limbs. During the sessions, 
the therapist instructed the patient about correct trunk posture, upper and lower-limb participation, as well as the 
best way to coordinate the walker. We noticed a reduction in the need for these verbal instructions when tactile 
feedback was employed (question 5). Overall, we found that tactile feedback was useful for the patient to perform 
the task more independently.
BFNR validation. 
After completing the pilot validation tests, we applied our BFNR protocol to both patients. 
Here, we present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the patients’ walking with our sFES system, their per-
formance with the BMI and their performances with the setup integrating the BMI and the sFES. Overall, both 
patients managed to walk correctly using the sFES and the stimulation paradigm proposed in this project (see 
Supplementary Movies S2 and S3 for runs with both patients).
To have a complete view of the behavior of the two patients with our setup, we carried out a qualitative anal-
ysis of the patients’ sFES-generated walking patterns during their last FL sessions. Figure 3A shows the hip and 
knee range of motion for these sessions and Figure 3B the detailed study carried out by a trained physiotherapist 
blinded to the experiment.
Considering the metrics for high-level coordination, we did not find notable differences between the patients; 
both patients had good trunk alignment during the tasks; they, nevertheless, used compensatory movements to 
maintain their upper body. As patients used the tactile shirt in both sessions, we found results consistent with the 
pilot tests for P1. Basically, both patients did not need verbal instructions, nor did they need to constantly look 
at their bodies during the sFES-generated locomotion. During the stance phase, both patients had good knee 
position but poor plantigrade position during single support. Patient P1 had expected responses during the swing 
phase, with his foot rarely dragging on the floor. Patient P2 had difficulties in this aspect of the swing phase, due to 
a smaller response of the tibialis anterior muscle. We hypothesize that this lack of muscle response was due to an 
observed tension in this patient’s gastrocnemius (Gs) muscle (which is the antagonistic muscle of this movement). 
Likely, this resulted from his positioning in his wheelchair since his knees and feet usually stayed flexed in his 
wheelchair, which could lead to increased tension in the Gs muscle.
Both patients in this protocol had been previously trained with the BMI protocol using an arm or leg motor 
imagery as described in the WANR protocol14,20 for over 2 years. However, the specific BMI protocol proposed 
in the current study was new to both patients. Each B + FL session started with an 8-minute open-loop training 
block where patients were randomly instructed to imagine moving their left or right leg. The recorded EEG data 
was used to train the EEG classifier. The classification accuracy for both patients was above chance (73.9% ± 3.6% 
for P1 and 83.2% ± 8.2% for P2) (Fig. 3C). Patient P2’s classifier accuracy was significantly higher than for P1 
(t-test, P = 0.002). To confirm that patients effectively used leg motor imagery during the B + FL sessions, we 
analyzed the principal components calculated with the common spatial pattern filter (CSP)46 (Fig. 3D). The CSP 
algorithm detects the EEG electrodes that maximize the variance for the two classes (here, left leg versus right leg 
motor imagery). For left leg motor imagery, we found the main activation over the C2 electrode for both patients 
(see Fig. 1E for electrode placement), while for right leg motor imagery, the CSP filter detected the highest vari-
ance over electrodes CCP1h, confirming cortical activation in the leg motor area.
Next, patients learned to perform leg motor imagery to trigger the stimulation of the corresponding leg 
through an EEG-based brain-machine interface (Fig. 3E). An array of LEDs informed the patients of the cur-
rent state of the trial and the brain activity classification. A trial was defined as follows: after a relax period of 
4 seconds where the patients could adjust themselves, and 1-second focus time, the patients had a 4-second time 
window to perform the motor imagery (Fig. 3F). If the patient managed to maintain the correct motor imagery 
for 2 seconds, the trial was considered as successful, and the corresponding step was triggered. If the timeout 
was reached, the trial was registered as a failure, and an automatic step started. The time to trigger a step, there-
fore, ranged between 2 and 4 seconds. During each session, patients performed 72 steps divided into six runs 
separated by a 1-minute break.
The number of correct steps per run is reported in Fig. 3G. Patient P2 outperformed patient P1 regarding the 
number of successful trials per session by performing 88% of the runs above chance and more than one-fifth of 
the runs with a perfect score (Fig. 3G). Throughout the training, we observed a clear improvement in terms of 
control accuracy for patient P2. Indeed, when considering the second half of the training, 25 out of 30 runs were 
significantly better than chance (mean + 2*SD).

Patient P1 had just 50% of the runs above chance level. This shows that the BMI protocol and the need to 
maintain the leg motor imagery for 2 seconds was particularly difficult for patient P1 who, despite having a good 
classifier score (on average >70%), did not manage to perform the BMI control above chance level.
We also analyzed the mean time to perform a step for each session (Fig. 3H). We found a small but statisti-
cally significant trend towards reducing the time to perform the task in patient P2 (y = −
0.11x + 3.44, p = 0) and 
patient P1 (y = −
0.03x + 3.7, p = 0.03) with training. Altogether, we observed significant control performances in 
patient P2. Patient P1, who started with lower performance rates, improved (although at a slower rate) with the 
training and could have potentially reached better control with more extended BMI training.
Clinical improvements. 
Following the BFNR protocol, we observed notable physical improvements in both 
patients. This was first verified by an increase in muscle volume through the perimeter assessment38. We found, as 
expected, an increase of the thigh volume of 276 cm3 in patient P1 and the lower-leg volume of 636 cm3 (Table 1, 
Supplementary Fig. S3). Patient P2 also exhibited this effect, with an increase of 838 cm3 of thigh volume and 
280 cm3 for the lower-leg volume.
We next analyzed the patients’ walking functions using assistive devices. For this, we employed the WISCI II 
evaluation37, which assesses the amount of physical assistance needed, as well as the required devices (orthosis 
and gait assistive devices), for a patient with SCI to walk 10 meters (Table 2). The exam was performed with no 
body weight support and no sFES. At the onset of the BFNR (M5), patient P1 was able to walk 10 meters using a 
lower-limb orthosis (HKAFO: hip-knee-ankle-foot orthosis), a triangular walker and required additional physi-
cal assistance for hip and trunk stabilization (WISCI score of 6). Following the BFNR protocol (M6) this patient’s 
functional score improved to 9, as he required no physical assistance to perform the task. He also managed to 
perform the same test with crutches and one assistant (score of 7). Additionally, P1 was able to accomplish the 
task 19 seconds faster than at the onset of the BFNR. No notable changes were observed during the pilot valida-
tion tests (M3 to M4). Considering the necessary level of assistance to perform the 10 m task, we did not register 
changes for patient P2 (score of 6 at the onset and the end of the protocol), he nevertheless managed to perform 
the test 14 seconds faster.
Both patients experienced a small decrease in the resting heart rate (HR) throughout the protocol (81 bpm to 
74 for P1, 79 bpm to 76 for P2, Table 2). Similarly, the HR increase due to the effort was smaller at the end of train-
ing for P2 (HR increase of 41 bpm at the onset of the training (M5 and 23 bpm at the M6). Patient P1 improved 
during the pilot tests (an increase of HR of 30 bpm was observed at M2, and an increase of 1 at M3). During the 
measurement following the BFNR, this patient managed to perform the task with less assistance which translated 
into a higher increase in HR (36 bpm).
The Borg fatigue assessment is a subjective self-reported level of exertion during exercise ranging between 
0 (no fatigue) to 10. Patients were asked to report the level of fatigue in their upper-limbs. We observed a small 
decrease in the fatigue assessment following the BFNR for patient P1. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were 
also measured before and after each WISCI assessment (Table 2). All recorded values were in the normal range.
No clear neurological improvement was observed in the patients’ sensory domain (light touch, pin-prick sen-
sation) during the BFNR (Fig. 4A). Patient P2 had an improvement rate comparable to the one he had during the 
first 28 months of WANR, while patient P1 stagnated.
On the other hand, we documented significant motor improvement in both patients. The improvement was 
assessed through the lower extremity motor score measurement (LEMS) of five lower-limb muscle groups (rec-
tus femoris proximal and distal, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus and gastrocnemius). For a complete 
view, we recorded seven additional lower-limb muscles (hip adductors, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, medial 
and lateral hamstring,flexor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus). The scoring method followed the 
standard ASIA motor exam conventions, ranging from 0 (no contraction) to 5 (normal contraction). We show 
the LEMS score for both patients in the lower panel of Fig. 4A, and the details per muscle in Table 3. For patient 
P1, we observed, a 1 point LEMS increase during the sFES pilot phase and a gain of 3 points during the BFNR 
phase. This was an encouraging result, as it demonstrated that even at the chronic phase of an SCI, it is still pos-
sible to observe neurological improvement. Notably, patient P2 exhibited a much higher motor improvement 
(Supplementary Movie S4); starting with an LEMS of 2 measured at the onset of the BFNR training. This patient 
reached a final score of 11 points. Considering all 12 muscles, this patient went from a score of 6 to 21 (Table 3). 
By the end of the training, patient P2 could contract the Rectus Femoris Distal (RFD) muscles with a score of 2. 
This was confirmed both clinically and thorough EMG recordings (Fig. 4B) showing the presence of significant 
contractions at the end of the BFRN.
We next analyzed the proportion of muscles that improved with the training, considering the muscles that 
were stimulated with the sFES separately from those that were not (lower part of Table 3). For patient P1, no clear 
improvement was observed during the pilot tests. During the BFRN for this patient, none of the non-stimulated 
muscles improved, but 5 out of the 16 stimulated muscles improved. For patient P2, we observed an improve-
ment in one out of the eight non-stimulated muscles and 14 out the 16 stimulated ones. We observed that the 
best motor improvement occurred in muscles that were stimulated with sFES, with notably better responses for 
patient P2.

Overall, the motor improvement in both our patients could not be compared to the type of spontaneous 
improvement rates reported in the literature (scores <1 point when the training starts 26 weeks after the injury2) 
or those recorded for our patients prior to the start of training in our laboratory (0 for both patients, M1-M0). 
For patient P2, the improvement observed following the BFNR (9 points after just 5 months) was even higher 
than the one he experienced during the WANR protocol (i.e., a 4 point improvement during the first 28 months).
Discussion
This paper introduces a novel, non-invasive neurorehabilitation protocol for locomotion training for patients 
with severe chronic paraplegia resulting from spinal cord injuries, which targets both musculoskeletal training 
and corticospinal plasticity. Our setup integrated several technical novelties: a new sFES paradigm targeting mus-
cle activation to produce locomotion, a BMI paradigm based on detection of left and right leg motor imagery to 
trigger the sFES, and sensory substitution to provide patients with tactile feedback from the lower limbs. We also 
introduced a step-by-step conditioning/training protocol and validated it with two individuals with paraplegia.
Using this novel approach, we successfully tested a stimulation protocol to reproduce a smooth gait pattern; 
patients were able to use our setup to walk with partial suspension and little or no external help. This result 
was possible thanks to muscle conditioning preceding the sFES-generated walk. Following an SCI, muscles 
with myotomes originating below the lesion level undergo severe disuse atrophy47,48. Several years after the

lesion, the volume of muscle fibers is reduced, becoming more and more prone to the process of fat infiltration. 
Concurrently, slow fatigable fibers tend to transform into fast fatigable fibers47. As a result of our training proto-
col, our patients experienced an increase in the volume of their leg muscle fibers and a parallel increase in their 
resistance to muscle fatigue21,49–51.

Another important aspect of our strategy was the stimulation of a large number of muscles (16 lower-limb 
muscles) with precise timing. This was possible thanks to a custom-built programmable sFES stimulator39 to 
target each muscle individually. The conventional sFES technique to reproduce locomotion uses stimulation 
of the peroneal nerve to elicit the triple-flexion reflex during the swing and stimulation of the gluteus and the 
quadriceps during the stance phase of the gait35,52,53. This technique is limited by the high variability of the muscle 
response and the rapid habituation to the stimulation24. Instead, in our protocol, we decided to directly stimulate 
the lower-limb muscles to produce a consistent gait pattern. A major technical difficulty of our approach came 
from the inherent non-linearity of muscle responses54 (sigmoidal shape response type) and the effect of muscular 
fatigue due to the recruitment of muscles fibers in a non-selective, spatially fixed and temporally synchronous 
pattern55,56. In SCI subjects, following the lesion, there is also a trend towards the substitution of muscle fibers 
into rapidly fatigable fibers47. To cope with these difficulties, we proposed and successfully tested a closed-loop 
sFES controller using the joint angles of the lower-limbs to adapt the stimulation in real time. We also introduced 
online tactile feedback to help patients perceive gait events. Previously, our group has reported that this sort of 
feedback promotes cortical plasticity26 and provides patients with the type of lower-limb sensory information 
needed to improve their gait. Here, we observed that the use of tactile feedback increased the patients’ confidence 
and independence during the walk. Overall, using our setup and following our protocol, our patients acquired 
the ability to produce a smooth sFES-generated gait pattern. Indeed, for both patients, the main clinical features 
of human gait were respected: absence of crouching at stance, neutral position of the ankle at initial contact and 
during stance phase, as well as sufficient foot clearance during the swing.
Our BFNR protocol was specifically designed considering the use of BMI for neurorehabilitation purposes 
(rather than assistance)35,57 for patients with SCI with minimal or no motor function. Therefore, the focus was not 
placed at achieving the highest level of control accuracy or speed, but rather to create a condition in which both 
afferent and efferent signals, converging at the level of the lesion, are engaged simultaneously. Thus, to trigger 
a step, patients had to perform and maintain leg motor imagery of the corresponding leg for two seconds. This 
protocol was particularly complicated for one patient who experienced more difficulties in control performance. 
Future work with a larger cohort of patients is necessary to address this issue; for example, a shorter trial-time 
could potentially facilitate the task.
As the final outcome of this study, we observed that patients exposed to our protocol exhibited important 
clinical improvements, including, as expected, increases in muscle volume58. Moreover, we observed better out-
comes in walking functions using assistive devices. As a result, our patients’ step frequency increased, and one 
patient was able to walk using less assistance at the end of the protocol. This was probably a consequence of better

overall physical condition, which was indirectly inferred by the decrease in resting heart rate, smaller heart rate 
increase after the effort, improved muscular resistance, better coordination with walking devices due to the use of 
a walker and body weight support in the protocol, and the occurrence of a significant partial neurological recov-
ery in the motor domain. Considering this latter component, partial motor neurological recovery was observed 
in different degrees: it was moderate in patient P1 and substantial in patient P2. Importantly, P2 was the patient 
who had good BMI control and good sFES responses. Further clinical trials are necessary to disambiguate if 
achieving good BMI-control accuracy is a necessary condition or even a determinant for patients to benefit from 
this training.
Yet, there is one major question that remains open: what is the mechanism that induces this improvement? We 
hypothesize that, like in the case of our previous results with the WANR, the concurrent occurrence of cortical 
plasticity, induced by BMI use11,13,14 and spinal plasticity, promoted by sFES through ascending signals59–61 was an 
essential agent for the observed neurological motor improvement in our study. Recent work with human subjects 
showed that the use of invasive epidural stimulation has the potential to induce partial neurological restoration 
in chronic complete SCI patients9. Importantly, a study with rats15 showed that the motor recovery was faster and 
more important when the epidural stimulation was paired with brain-machine interfaces compared to conditions 
where epidural stimulation was used alone. These findings provide clear support for our hypothesis.
For both patients, the cortical activation during leg motor imagery was found close to the cortical leg 
sensory-motor area. The presence of activation in posterior areas was previously reported in patients with chronic 
complete SCI due to cortical reorganization towards the primary somatosensory cortex62–64.
Given the improvements obtained in this pilot study in terms of muscular volume and performance, better 
walking functions and neurological recovery, we propose that our BFNR protocol has the potential to become a 
valuable neurorehabilitation therapy for patients with SCI in the future.
Methods
patients inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Subjects were adults diagnosed with paraplegia, with traumatic SCI 
thoracic injury at the chronic phase of the lesion, emotionally stable and with the absence of offset comorbidities. 
The inclusion criteria for the present study considered patients that had previously participated in the WANR 
protocol and who exhibited evidence of upper motor neuron injury, clinically manifested by the presence of 
spasticity and positive response to spinal reflexes. The screening was performed to test their muscles’ responsivity 
to sFES before inclusion. Exclusion criteria included lower motor neuron injury, the absence of muscle response 
during sFES responsivity screening, a degree of spasticity exceeding a score of 2 (Ashworth scale), and a degree of 
osteoporosis (T-score) greater than −
4. Two patients were included in this study. Prior to the intervention, patient 
P1 and P2 followed a neurorehabilitation protocol introduced by our team (Walk Again Neurorehabilitation 
Protocol, WANR)20 which integrated the use of body weight support (BWS, Zero-G, Aretech LLC., Ashburn, VA), 
Lokomat6, brain-machine interface (both arms and legs motor imagery), and tactile feedback26 for 28 months and 
34 months respectively. The two patients, referred to here as P1 and P2, were previously referred to as P5 and P6 
by Donati et al.14 and Shokur et al.20,26.
study approval. 
The study was approved by both the local ethics committee (Associação de Assistência à 
Criança Deficiente, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil #364.027) and the Brazilian federal government ethics committee 
(CONEP, CAAE: 13165913.1.0000.0085). The experiments were carried out as a feasibility study that did not meet 
the clinicaltrials.gov definition of an Applicable Clinical Trial. All research activities were carried out in accord-
ance with the guidelines and regulations of the Associação de Assistência à Criança Deficiente and CONEP. The 
participants signed a written informed consent before enrolling in the study, and also signed a written informed 
consent for open access publication (print and digital) of their images. The experiments were carried out at the 
Associação Alberto Santos Dumont para Apoio à Pesquisa (AASDAP), São Paulo.
sFES conditioning. An initial screening, which tested all muscles individually, helped set the stimulation 
amplitude and frequency parameters for the conditioning. The pulse width was fixed at 300 μ
s for the whole 
program65. The conditioning phase aimed at preparing the muscles progressively to produce a muscle contrac-
tion that allowed lower-limb movements of flexion, extension, and abduction, with the final goal to produce a 
sFES-generated gait. The stimulation time for each muscle increased gradually, up to 40 minutes maximum. The 
ramp up/down stimulation time decreased from one session to the next one. During the first eight sessions, the 
patient was maintained in the supine position, and the legs were positioned on rollers to allow free movement. 
The muscles were first stimulated individually, then in pairs and finally alternating between flexors and extensors 
(leg-by-leg pattern). The leg-by-leg pattern was applied in two phases: extensors of one leg were stimulated, while 
the flexors of the opposite leg contracted for 10–15 seconds. The muscles then rested for 2 seconds before the 
opposite pattern was applied. During the session, a physiatrist supervising the experiment evaluated the muscle 
response (visual evaluation of the range of motion of the joints and presence or absence of fatigue), the tonus 
behavior, the sensory perception of the stimulation and the ability to voluntarily improve the muscle contraction 
together with the stimulation.
For the last session, the patient was supported in an upright position in a body weight support system 
(Zero-G, Aretech LLC., Ashburn, VA). The stimulation sequence, called stationary gait, differed from the 
leg-by-leg sequence due to the continuity of the stimulation to extend both lower-limbs. The following criteria 
were expected for a patient to continue with the FC phase in standing position: adequate muscle responses to 
allow the hip and knee extension, stable blood pressure, no signs of fatigue during the first 25 minutes, and no 
spasticity disturbing the stimulation pattern.

Body-weight support system. A robotic body weight support system (Zero-G, Aretech LLC., Ashburn, VA) was 
used to support 65–70% of the weight of the patient during gait. This percentage was selected to provide the min-
imum suspension required to avoid a crouching position of the lower-limbs, ensuring good contact between the 
foot and the ground and reducing muscle effort to help avoid premature fatigue.
Real-time tracking system. During all experiments, hip and knee joint angles were measured in real-time at 
148 Hz. The system used four inertial measurement units (IMU, Trigno TM Inertial Measurement Sensors, 
Delsys, USA). One sensor was placed on each femur (thigh) and tibia (lower leg) of the patient. The joint angle 
was computed based on the difference in orientation of the sensors on the adjacent segments66. The patient was 
asked to keep the trunk position straight throughout the training. At the first session, the sensors were positioned 
on the body relative to anatomical references (patella, tibial tuberosity, and malleolus) and we calculated the 
parameters needed for the algorithm.
Description of the gait pattern and rationale. To produce the gait movement, we designed an activation sequence 
based on 16 lower-limb muscles stimulated non-invasively. The stimulation pattern, shown in Fig. 1G was deter-
mined based on eight gait sub-phases, namely (1) initial contact, (2) load response, (3) mid-stance, (4) terminal 
stance, (5) pre-swing, (6) initial swing, (7) mid-swing and (8) terminal swing. The stride duration could vary from 
4 to 20 seconds. The highest joint range of motion of the human gait takes place in the sagittal plane where flexion 
and extension of the hip, knee, and ankle occur. We selected extensors and flexors for each joint.
We describe here each muscle activation of the stimulation pattern, considering the start of the stance as the 
start of the gait cycle. In this position, during initial contact, the vertical reaction force is acting in front of the 
hip joint promoting an internal flexor moment that will induce hip flexion. The GMx is therefore activated to 
challenge this internal moment to extend the hip and to align the trunk and pelvis in the orthostatic posture. 
During the single support phase (that includes mid-stance and terminal stance sub-phases), the patients’ lack of 
lateral pelvic stabilization could potentially compromise hip joint integrity. To avoid this issue, the Gmd muscle 
was stimulated to stabilize the pelvis segment in the frontal plane. The Sl muscle was recruited to control the 
advancement of the tibia in mid-stance, together with the knee extensor, VL, to maintain dynamic stability and 
extension of the knee at stance.
The pre-swing phase started when the opposite foot touched the ground. At this instant, the Gs was stimulated 
to assist the knee flexion, and the Hs stimulation reinforced this movement. This condition promoted lifting the 
heel off the ground. After this, during the initial swing, the RFP was stimulated to flex the hip to lift the foot from 
the ground. Then the RFP acted to counteract the external lower-limb extension moment promoted by gravity. 
The RFP stimulation during terminal swing also allowed better control of the downward movement of the limb 
towards the ground, preparing the limb for the next cycle (next initial contact).
The Hs stimulation was progressively replaced by the VL to extend the knee gradually in the mid- and termi-
nal swing. The TA stimulation promoted ankle dorsiflexion to keep it in a neutral position during the swing phase 
and to avoid dragging the foot on the ground. The TA stimulation decreased progressively, slightly before the foot 
touched the ground, to let the foot set down gently on the floor in a flat position, minimizing joint injuries. Three 
types of different speeds ramps were used (slow, middle, rapid).
sFES Stimulator. 
We used a custom 20-channel stimulator for this project39,67. The stimulator sends 
charge-balanced, rectangular, biphasic pulses. Surface electrodes were used to stimulate 16 selected muscles as 
shown in Fig. 1C. Two sizes of electrodes were used: 5 ×
 10 cm (for GMx, Gmd, VL, Hs, Gs) and 5 ×
 5 cm to target 
important muscles more locally (RFP) or smaller muscles (TA, Sl). The stimulator allowed the modulation of 
pulse width, frequency and current intensity at a refresh rate of 10 ms. The pulse width was maintained at 300 μ
s 
as this was previously found as an optimal value65. By default, a frequency of 30 Hz was used68. This electrostimu-
lator and the risk analysis associated report has been approved by the SwissMedic Ethical Committee for Clinical 
Investigations (SwissMedic Ethical approval, Ref MD-2007-MD-0031).
PI controller. The PI controller ran at 50 Hz and adapted the stimulation amplitude to reach the predefined tar-
get angles (see Description of the gait pattern and rationale). For safety, the maximum current modulation was 
saturated within a range of 20% above or below the command. The parameters for the PI controllers were found 
using the pure PI control (i.e., without pre-established stimulation pattern) on healthy subjects to achieve typical 
joint trajectories (ramp target, sinusoidal target and kinematics curves from a normal gait cycle). Proportional 
and integral gain, Kp and Ki were respectively set to 0.5 and 0.001.
PI controller characterization experiment. To evaluate the effect of the PI controller, we designed a specific 
experiment that isolated only the knee extension. The patient was sitting in his wheelchair with his feet hang-
ing. The vastus of each leg was stimulated alternately to induce left and right knee extension. We designed the 
desired angle trajectory to be composed of ramps and plateaus to study the characteristics of the controller 
with constant and changing targets. We pseudo-randomized the trials where the PI controller was on (PI-on) 
and trials where it was off (PI-off) (three PI-off and three PI-on were shuffled every six repetitions). Only the 
vastus muscle was stimulated to act as knee extensor, and the knee flexion was performed passively by gravity. 
The whole experiment was composed of 100 repetitions (50 open-loop, PI-off, and 50 closed-loop, PI-on). The 
current amplitude model for the open-loop was composed of ramps and plateaus between two amplitudes. 
Those two amplitudes were selected during preliminary tests on the same day to obtain two levels of extension 
close to the desired target.

Custom visualization system and LEDs. During the B + FL phase, two arrays of four LEDs were placed on each 
side of the walker to indicate the output of the EEG classifier and the experiment’s protocol. The left and rightmost 
LEDs informed the patients of the experiment with a simple color convention: black (turned off) for idle time, 
pink for focus, and left or right blue LED for corresponding leg motor imagery. At the end of each trial, the patient 
could see if he succeeded or failed the trial (green or red LED). Patients’ EEG classifier value was discretized in the 
[−
1.5; +1.5] range and shown using the six remaining LEDs.
EEG and BMI. We used the opensource software OpenViBE 0.16.0, for the acquisition and processing of EEG sig-
nals69. EEG signals were acquired at 2000 Hz with the V-amp amplifier (Brain Products, GmbH). Sixteen channels were 
recorded and clustered around the leg representation of the primary sensorimotor cortex (Fig. 1E). We used actiCAP 
active electrodes, connected to the wireless MOVE (both Brain Products, GmbH), carried with the patient. The wireless 
receiver was directly connected to the amplifier via USB to a computer. EEG signals were band-pass filtered at 8–30 Hz 
(mu and beta), corresponding to the well-documented frequency band for motor-related EEG activity70.
We then used two algorithms for the detection of motor imagery: the Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) algo-
rithm46 as a spatial filter and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification. The CSP aims at learning 
spatial filters, such that the variance of the signals is maximized for one class (e.g., one mental imagery task) and 
minimized for the other class. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm was used to estimate a linear 
hyperplane to separate feature vectors from two classes)71. In our case, if the LDA output was positive, the feature 
vector was assigned to the right motor imagery class. Otherwise, it was assigned to the left leg motor imagery 
class. Every BMI session started with 8 minutes of training (40 trials, 20 left and right leg motor imageries, ran-
domized order). Each trial consisted of 1-second preparation, followed by 1.25 s of cue presentation and a 3.75 s 
motor imagery period. The intertrial time was randomly chosen between 1.5 and 3.5 seconds.
Patients were instructed to produce motor imagery involving only one leg at the time as, e.g., ‘imagine kicking 
a ball with your right leg,’ ‘imagine making a circular movement with your left ankle,’ and to avoid motor image-
ries that involved the movement of both legs such as ‘cycling’ or ‘walking.’ We used a 5-fold, cross-validation for 
calculation of the classifier accuracy.
During this acquisition, the patient already had the sFES electrodes placed and connected to the stimulator 
(with the stimulator turned off); he was standing, in the BWS system, but without suspension and was supported 
in an upright position. Before the first BMI run, the patient remained for 30 seconds without motor imagery in 
a standing position to record the baseline classifier. The mean of this signal was subtracted from the classifier for 
the run to avoid any offset. The baseline could be calculated one more time before the fourth run if needed to 
compensate for any new offset.
During the online control, we used the parameters for the CSP and the LDA that were calculated during the 
training phase. The only difference with the training phase was a threshold of 0.1 on the classifier value to reduce 
chances of false positives: we considered detection of left or right motor imagery only when the classifier was, 
respectively, smaller than −
0.1 or above 0.1.
Tactile shirt. The tactile shirt was composed of the three vibrators aligned on the ulna as described in26. Patients 
received continuous tactile feedback going from the wrist to the elbow (apparent movement as described in45) 
coinciding with the stimulation of the lower-limb muscles to indicate the beginning the swing (start of phase six, 
Fig. 1G). At the end of phase eight, they received stimulation of all three vibrators together for 600 ms.
Calculation of the chance level for the BMI. The baseline data was gathered during resting time with the same patients, 
collected at the onset of each BMI session. All experimental conditions were the same as those for the current experi-
mental paradigm. Patients were using the same EEG cap, and setup (standing position). EEG signals were recorded for 
30 seconds prior to the session. We gathered all the baseline datasets and cut them into 4 s time windows corresponding 
to step trials. Then we applied the exact same algorithm and simulated a sequence of runs based on these datasets. We 
report the statistics for chance level, obtained by simulating 600 steps (50 runs of 12 steps): 5.72 + −
 1.82 (mean + −
SD) 
correct steps performed over 12 steps run, and the time to perform a step is on average 3.31 + −
0.84[s].
Session interruption and data exclusion. A clinical check was done before and during the sessions. If the patient 
presented abnormal low blood pressure or severe cases of spasticity before or during the session, the session was, 
respectively, not initiated or interrupted.
Qualitative visual gait evaluation. Each evaluation session had six FL runs; each run had 12 steps. Step time 
was pseudo-randomized per run (8 s/step, 6 s/step or 4 s/step). Video clips of the patients’ runs were cut, shuffled 
and given to an expert physiotherapist blinded to the conditions of the experience, with a questionnaire devel-
oped by our group (referred to here as visual gait score for sFES, see Supplementary Table S4 for details). The 
questionnaire included three control, five high-level and seven kinematics-oriented questions. The answers were 
Likert-type, ranging from 1 to 5. The control questions assessed respectively whether the patient exhibited spas-
ticity, clear signs of fatigue or reduction of muscle response to the stimulation during the run. If any of the three 
control questions had a score superior or equal to 4, the run was discarded. No runs were removed for any of the 
two sessions used for the tactile-on versus tactile-off experiment with patient P1. One of the runs of patient P2 
and none of P1 were discarded from the qualitative analysis of sFES-generated walk.
3D Gait analysis. Standard gait-analysis procedures were employed to collect data using a motion-capture sys-
tem comprised of 12 cameras and a 4 Mb resolution (Raptor-4) and the Cortex 6.0 software (Motion Analysis, 
Santa Rosa, CA, USA). The kinematic data were acquired at 150 Hz. The marker-set protocol adopted was

comprised of 28 anatomical reflective markers (Helen Hayes marker set). Markers were placed directly onto 
the skin in the patient’s pelvic and lower-extremity segments. Offline, raw marker-trajectory data were filtered 
using a 4th-order, low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz. Data processing was performed 
using the Cortex software version 6.0. Visual 3D software (C-motion Inc., Germantown, MD, USA) was used to 
perform all kinematics calculations. The foot strike and toe-off were determined when the velocity of the heel 
and toe markers respectively crossed a 20 mm/s threshold level. The definition of the anatomical-segment coor-
dinate system was used to determine the 3D position and orientation of the lower extremity and pelvis segments 
through a combination of anatomical-frame conventions proposed previously72. Patient P2 performed 54 full gait 
cycles, with 101 time-normalized points, which corresponded to the time-normalized angles (pelvis, hip, knee, 
ankle, and foot).
