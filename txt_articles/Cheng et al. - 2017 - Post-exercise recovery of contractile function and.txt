Key points
r We investigated whether intramuscular temperature affects the acute recovery of exercise
performance following fatigue-induced by endurance exercise.
r Mean power output was better preserved during an all-out arm-cycling exercise following a
2 h recovery period in which the upper arms were warmed to an intramuscular temperature of
̴ 38°C than when they were cooled to as low as 15°C, which suggested that recovery of exercise
performance in humans is dependent on muscle temperature.
r Mechanisms underlying the temperature-dependent effect on recovery were studied in intact
single mouse muscle fibres where we found that recovery of submaximal force and restoration
of fatigue resistance was worsened by cooling (16–26°C) and improved by heating (36°C).
r Isolated whole mouse muscle experiments confirmed that cooling impaired muscle glycogen
resynthesis.
r We conclude that skeletal muscle recovery from fatigue-induced by endurance exercise is
impaired by cooling and improved by heating, due to changes in glycogen resynthesis rate.
Abstract Manipulation of muscle temperature is believed to improve post-exercise recovery,
with cooling being especially popular among athletes. However, it is unclear whether such
temperature manipulations actually have positive effects. Accordingly, we studied the effect of
muscle temperature on the acute recovery of force and fatigue resistance after endurance exercise.
One hour of moderate-intensity arm cycling exercise in humans was followed by 2 h recovery in
which the upper arms were either heated to 38°C, not treated (33°C), or cooled to �15°C. Fatigue
resistance after the recovery period was assessed by performing 3 × 5 min sessions of all-out arm
cycling at physiological temperature for all conditions (i.e. not heated or cooled). Power output
during the all-out exercise was better maintained when muscles were heated during recovery,
whereas cooling had the opposite effect. Mechanisms underlying the temperature-dependent
effect on recovery were tested in mouse intact single muscle fibres, which were exposed to
�12 min of glycogen-depleting fatiguing stimulation (350 ms tetani given at 10 s interval until
force decreased to 30% of the starting force). Fibres were subsequently exposed to the same
fatiguing stimulation protocol after 1–2 h of recovery at 16–36°C. Recovery of submaximal force
(30 Hz), the tetanic myoplasmic free [Ca2+] (measured with the fluorescent indicator indo-1),
and fatigue resistance were all impaired by cooling (16–26°C) and improved by heating (36°C).
In addition, glycogen resynthesis was faster at 36°C than 26°C in whole flexor digitorum brevis
muscles. We conclude that recovery from exhaustive endurance exercise is accelerated by raising
and slowed by lowering muscle temperature.

Introduction
Recovery of skeletal muscle force generation following
fatigue-inducing exercise can take from minutes to hours,
or even days before returning to pre-fatigued values
(Edwards et al. 1977). This prolonged depression of
contractile force is often more pronounced at low than
at high stimulation frequencies (Edwards et al. 1977)
and has been referred to as prolonged low-frequency
force depression (PLFFD) (Allen et al. 2008). Thus,
higher stimulation frequencies are necessary in order
to attain a given submaximal force output. Given that
the majority of locomotion involves submaximal contra-
ctions, PLFFD can markedly contribute to the sensation
of muscle weakness that persists long after a fatiguing
exercise has been completed, even though maximum force
capacity can still be attained upon a maximal voluntary
effort. The development of PLFFD is consistent with an
impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release and/or
a decreased myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, with the relative
importancedependingonthetypeofexerciseandrecovery
time (Skurvydas et al. 2016). For instance, increased
reactive
oxygen–nitrogen
species
generated
during
high-intensity type fatigue tasks have been implicated in
depressing both SR Ca2+ release and myofibrillar Ca2+
sensitivity (Bruton et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2015; Place
et al. 2015; Watanabe & Wada, 2016; Dutka et al. 2017),
whereas myofibrillar damage may cause PLFFD after
repeated eccentric contractions (Skurvydas et al. 2016).
Furthermore, the muscle glycogen level may also affect SR
Ca2+ regulation (Ørtenblad & Nielsen, 2015).
Glycogen is a primary energy source for muscle
contraction, and depletion of glycogen from mainly
intra-myofibrillar pools close to the SR has been associated
with impaired SR Ca2+
release during prolonged,
endurance-type exercise in elite cross-country skiers
(Nielsen et al. 2009; Ørtenblad et al. 2011b), following
fatiguing contractions in mechanically skinned rat fibres
(Nielsen et al. 2009), and in intact mouse fibres (Nielsen
et al. 2014). Given that decreased SR Ca2+ release can
be long lasting after fatigue induction (Westerblad et al.
2000), it is feasible that glycogen depletion contributes to
the depressed SR Ca2+ release and consequently PLFFD.
In humans, glycogen depletion provides a strong drive for
its own resynthesis and the resynthesis rate is highest in
the early post-exercise period (0–4 h) and slows down
as muscle glycogen increases (Piehl, 1974; Jentjens &
Jeukendrup, 2003; Marchand et al. 2007; Nielsen et al.
2011). Depending on the extent of glycogen depletion
and exercise mode, full glycogen recovery may last up
to 24 h or several days (Piehl, 1974; Kiens & Richter,
1998; Jentjens & Jeukendrup, 2003; Pilegaard et al. 2005;
Krustrup et al. 2011). Thus, glycogen repletion and PLFFD
followasimilartimecourse(Edwardsetal.1977),although
a causative relationship has not been established.
Among the numerous approaches to maximizing
post-exercise recovery, cryotherapy (i.e. cooling the
exercised limbs) has become widely popular. Although
whole-body cooling appears to be clearly beneficial for
counteracting hyperthermia when exercising in a warm
environment (Todd et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2006; Tyler
et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015), the benefits of cryotherapy
of the exercised limbs alone are more uncertain (Leeder
et al. 2012; Ihsan et al. 2016). Rates of enzymatic processes
generally increase as the temperature rises, and thus we
hypothesized that muscle cooling might actually delay
recovery following prolonged glycogen-depleting exercise,
particularly during the first hours following fatigue
when regeneration of force and glycogen resynthesis are
most rapid (Piehl, 1974; Marchand et al. 2007; Nielsen
et al. 2011). Conversely, heating muscles may promote
both of these processes. To test these hypotheses we
performed experiments with exercising human subjects
and electrically stimulated single mouse muscle fibres.
Altogether our current results reveal that recovery of
contractile function and muscle endurance as well as
glycogen repletion were faster at elevated than at lowered
muscle temperatures.
Methods
Healthy recreationally active young subjects (4 females, 1
male) participated in this study. The age, height, weight
and percentage body fat (as measured by bioelectrical
impedance, InBody720, Seoul, Korea; mean ± SEM) were
26 ± 2 years, 171 ± 4 cm, 64 ± 2 kg, 19 ± 3%.
All human experiments were performed at Mid Sweden

the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were fully informed of
any potential risk associated with the experiments before
written and oral consent was obtained from all subjects
prior to participation in this study.

Welfare Act, the Swedish Welfare Ordinance, and
applicable
regulations
and
recommendations
from
Swedish authorities. The parts of the study involving
mice were approved by the Stockholm North Ethical
Committee on Animal Experiments (no. N120/13).
Female C57BL/6J mice (n = 50) (Scanbur Research,
Sweden) were used for this study. Animals were housed in
a temperature-controlled environment with a 12 h light–
dark cycle, and were provided with standard rodent chow
and water ad libitum.
Human experiments
The experiment consisted of four visits. The first visit
was used for familiarization and initial testing of ˙
VO2peak
during arm cycling to determine exercise intensities in
subsequent visits. In visits 2–4, subjects performed arm
cycling on a modified ergometer (SRM GmbH, J¨
ulich,
Germany) (Fig. 1). First, subjects performed two 4 min
warm-up exercises at submaximal intensity (40 W), and
then a fatigue test which consisted of 3 × 5 min all-out
exercise at a constant pedaling frequency of 100 rpm,
with 5 min recovery between sets. Mean power output,
blood lactate, cardiorespiratory data and heart rate were
continuously measured; all methods were well established
and regularly used in the laboratory (Zinner et al. 2016).
Five minutes after the last set of the fatigue test, subjects
performed exhaustive exercise consisting of 4 × 15 min of
arm cycling at an intensity of 50% ˙
VO2peak. Then followed
2 h of recovery during which both arms were either:
(1) continuously cooled with ice-chilled water-perfused
arm cuffs, (2) kept at physiological temperature (�33°C),
or (3) heated to 5˚C above physiological temperatures
(i.e. 38°C) using modified arm cuffs (Breg PolarPad
Multi-Use, Carlsbad, CA, USA) continuously perfused
by a temperature-controlled water bath (Julabo ED-5,
Seelbach, Germany). The cooling experiment mimicked
other cold-water immersion studies in which exercised
limbs are immersed in ice-cooled water (Ihsan et al.
2016), which is well tolerated over prolonged periods. Pre-
liminary experiments revealed that a 5°C increase in arm
muscle temperature with heating was the upper limit of
what subjects could comfortably tolerate for 2 h. The arm
cuffs were modified by removing the flow restrictor valve
in the tubing to allow for more rapid water perfusion
through the cuff. To prevent skin irritation with the
temperature manipulations, a thin dressing was wrapped
over top of the skin before applying the arm cuffs. The
order of the cooling, control, and heating condition was
randomized between subjects at visits 2–4. Intramuscular
temperature was recorded with probes (IT-23, Physitemp
Instruments, USA) inserted 1.5 cm deep into the lateral
head of the triceps brachii muscle of both arms using
a 23-gauge catheter. Core temperature was measured
with an infrared radiation device measuring temperature
from the tympanic membrane (Braun ThermoScan 5,
Germany).
During

subjects
consumed
1.1 g−1 (kg body weight)−1 h−1 carbohydrates in the
form of sports drinks and bars (High5 Sports Nutrition,
Leicester, UK) to maximize glycogen repletion (Jentjens
& Jeukendrup, 2003). The subjects were instructed to
consume the drinks and bars continuously during the
recovery period and to be finished 20 min before the end
of the recovery period. After the 2 h recovery, subjects
performed two 4-min submaximal warm-up stages at
100 rpm pedalling frequency and at an intensity that
elicited a respiratory exchange ratio of <1.0, which was

followed by the 3 × 5 min fatigue test to determine
whether exercise performance was affected by the recovery
intervention.
The oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2), carbon dioxide ( ˙
VCO2), and
pulmonary ventilation ( ˙
VE) were continuously monitored
using an open-circuit metabolic cart (AMIS 2001 model
C, Innovision A/S, Odense, Denmark) calibrated with
a 3 L syringe prior to each test (Hans Rudolph Inc.,
Kansas City, KS, USA) with a certified mixture of 16.0%
O2 and 4.5% CO2 in N2. Values were analysed as an
average of the highest 30 s for the ˙
VO2peak and an average
of the entire 5 min time trial for ˙
VO2mean. Heart rate
(HR) was monitored (RS400, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele,
Finland) during all testing and the average of each trial is
reported. Before and immediately after the fatigue tests,
capillary blood samples from the earlobe were analysed
for lactate concentration (Biosen 5140, EKF Diagnostic
GmbH, Magdeburg, Germany).
Single fibre experiments
Mice were killed by rapid cervical dislocation and whole
flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles were removed
from the hindlimbs. Intact single muscle fibres with
attached tendons were mechanically dissected from whole
FDB muscles (Cheng & Westerblad, 2017). Aluminum
T-clips were attached to both tendons of the single fibre
and the fibre was placed longitudinally in a perfusion
chamber between two platinum plates that delivered the
electrical currents. One tendon of the single fibre was
mountedtoaplatinumhookattachedtoaforcetransducer
(Akers 801, Kronex Technologies, Oakland, CA, USA)
and the other tendon was mounted to a platinum hook
attached to an adjustable holder. The fibre was electrically
stimulated with 70 Hz tetani of 350 ms duration (0.5 ms
pulse width) and the fibre length was adjusted until the
fibre achieved its optimum length of force production.
A camera and display monitor were used to determine
the fibre cross-sectional area at optimal length, which
was measured by taking the average diameter measured
at two different portions of the fibre. Before fatiguing
stimulation, all fibres were continuously perfused with
Tyrode solution containing (in mM): 121 NaCl, 5.0 KCl,
1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 24.0 NaHCO3, 0.1
EDTA, and 5.5 glucose. The solution was bubbled with
95% O2–5% CO2, giving a bath pH of 7.4. Experiments
were performed at physiological temperature for mouse
FDB fibres (31°C) (Bruton et al. 1998), and fibres
were perfused with Tyrode containing glucose unless
otherwise mentioned. Single fibres were pressure injected
with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 (no. 0146,
TEFLabs Inc., Austin, TX, USA) to measure myo-
plasmic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i]. Indo-1 was excited at
360 ± 5 nm wavelength and emission was recorded at
405 ± 5 nm and 495 ± 5 nm wavelengths using a system
consisting of a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and two
photomultiplier tubes (Photon Technology International,
Wedel, Germany). Ratiometric indo-1 emission values
were converted to [Ca2+]i using an in vivo calibration as
reported previously (Cheng & Westerblad, 2017). Indo-1
fluorescence decreased over time, and thus measurements
of tetanic [Ca2+]i at >1 h recovery were not used because
the 495 nm signal, which declines when [Ca2+]i increases,
became too low to allow reliable ratio measurements.
Initially, each fibre was stimulated with 350 ms duration
tetani once every 1 min at 30, 70 and 120 Hz, and
the peak force and spatial and time-averaged [Ca2+]i
were measured during tetani. After 5 min of rest, fibres
were perfused with glucose-free Tyrode solution and then
fatigue was induced by repetitively stimulating fibres with
350 ms duration 70 Hz tetani given once every 10 s
until peak force was decreased to 30% of the starting
value. This low-intensity stimulation protocol has been
shown to cause a marked 60–70% glycogen decrease
in single mouse FDB fibres (Nielsen et al. 2014). To
determine temperature effects on the recovery of force
and [Ca2+]i after fatigue, fibres were perfused with
glucose-containing Tyrode solution for up to 2 h at
one of four temperatures: 16°C (i.e. 10°C below physio-
logical temperature), 26°C (i.e. 5°C below physiological
temperature),31°C(physiologicaltemperatureoftheFDB
muscle) (Bruton et al. 1998), or 36°C (i.e. 5°C above
physiological temperature). To further assess whether
force recovery was dependent on glycogen restoration,
additional experiments were performed where fibres
were perfused with glucose-free Tyrode solution at the
different temperatures. Every 30 min during the recovery
period, the temperature was briefly changed to 31°C (for
�3 min) and fibres stimulated at 30, 70 and 120 Hz.
Temperatures were briefly restored to 31°C when fibres
were tested during the recovery period since temperature
in itself alters force production, that is, lowering muscle
temperature increases submaximal force while raising the
temperature decreases submaximal force (L¨
annergren &
Westerblad, 1987); thus, measuring force and [Ca2+]i at
the same temperature allowed a comparison of recovery
characteristics between conditions. To assess the effect of
temperature and glucose availability on the recovery of
muscle fatigue resistance, a second fatigue bout matching
the initial fatiguing stimulation was performed after the
recoveryperiod.Thereisapositivecorrelationbetweenthe
force produced and the energy consumed by cross-bridges
and SERCA (Crow & Kushmerick, 1983; Rall, 2005).
In some instances, fibres entered a marked PLFFD and
the 70 Hz force in these fibres was significantly lower
before the second vs. first fatigue bout. For these fibres,
the stimulation frequency during tetani was increased
in the second fatigue bout in order to match the initial
forces, and hence energy consumption, in the two fatigue
bouts.

Glycogen measurements
Muscle glycogen content was determined in whole FDB
muscles. Silk suture thread was tied to the distal and
proximal tendons of isolated FDB muscles and then the
muscles were mounted in a stimulation chamber (World
Precision Instruments - SI-MB4, Hertfordshire, UK)
containing Tyrode solution bubbled with 95% O2–5%
CO2. Whole FDBs were adjusted to optimal length by
stimulating with 70 Hz tetani. Muscles were then fatigued
at 31°C in glucose-free Tyrode solution with repeated
70 Hz tetani. Two stimulation protocols were performed: a
moderately glycogen-depleting protocol involving 700 ms
duration contractions given every 10 s for 150 tetani,
and a more severely glycogen-depleting protocol with 1 s
contractions given every 5 s for 300 tetani. Tendons were
cut, muscles weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen at
5 min after the repeated stimulations to assess the extent
of glycogen depletion during fatiguing stimulations. In
another set of experiments, control muscles were frozen
in liquid nitrogen without prior stimulation to represent
glycogen content before fatigue. Glycogen resynthesis was
assessed for the different stimulation protocols by bathing
muscles at temperatures of 26°C or 36°C with Tyrode
solution containing glucose, and snap freezing muscles at
30 min of recovery. Frozen FDB muscles were dissolved in
25µl1 NHClfor30minwithagitation.Homogenateswere
neutralized with the addition of 25 µl 1 N NaOH, and 5 µl
homogenate were added in duplicates to a 96 well plate.
Glycogen content was established using a fluorometric
kit (MAK016, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA). Glycogen
content was normalized to muscle wet weight.
Statistics
Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, one-way ANOVA,
and Student’s t tests were performed as appropriate using
Graphpad Prism Software (Graphpad Prism 7.0, San
Diego, CA, USA). Post hoc analysis was performed using a

Statistically significant differences were determined at
P < 0.05.
Results
Decreased fatigue resistance with cooling in humans
Three sets of 5 min all-out arm cycling were performed
before and after a 2 h recovery period at different muscle
temperatures to assess the effect of recovery temperature
on subsequent fatigue resistance. Intramuscular triceps
brachii temperature was recorded under the different
recovery conditions, with muscle warming elevating the
temperatureto�38°C(5°Cabovethecontroltemperature
of �33°C) by 20 min, whereas muscle cooling gradually
reduced muscle temperatures down to 15°C (Fig. 2A).
Core temperature was not affected by warming or cooling
(two-way repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.70, n = 5)
(Fig. 2B).
Mean power output in the first set (S1) of the fatigue
test (i.e. prior to heating, control, or cooling) was not
different across the three sessions, averaging 97 ± 7 W,
94 ± 7 W, and 94 ± 5 W (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.45,
n = 5). Furthermore, the mean relative power output
was also similar during the first 3 × 5 min fatigue test
(S1–S3) before the different recovery conditions (two-way
repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.94) (Fig. 2C). Thus,
the performance did not differ at the start of the three
testing sessions.

Single muscle fibre experiments were used to determine
potential cellular mechanisms underlying the greater
fatigue resistance following a recovery period with
muscle heating vs. cooling. These single fibre experiments
allow temperature to be strictly controlled and hence
temperature effects on the recovery of muscle contra-
ctile function can be directly assessed. Figure 3A shows
a significant main effect of temperature on the recovery
of 30 Hz force (two-way repeated measures ANOVA,
P = 0.0001, n = 4—5 per group), with the slowest
recovery evident at 16°C and the fastest recovery at 36°C.
There was also a significant main effect observed for
temperature on the recovery of 70 Hz force (two-way
repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.0001, n = 5 per
group), although the differences in force were smaller
than observed with 30 Hz stimulation. In contrast, 120 Hz
forcerecoveredrapidlyto>90%ofthecontrolandshowed
nosignificanttemperaturedependency(two-wayrepeated
measures ANOVA, P = 0.56, n = 5 per group).
The recovery of force in the absence of glucose
at different temperatures (26°C, 31°C, 36°C) resulted
in consistently lower mean force than in the pre-
sence of glucose. Moreover, the force depression showed
no temperature dependency in the absence of glucose
(two-way repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.97, n = 3–5
per group), and hence grouped data from all eleven fibres
recovering without glucose are plotted in Fig. 3A–C. Thus,
the effect of temperature on recovery of force is abolished
if glucose is not provided to the fibres.
The largest temperature-dependent differences in force
were observed after 30 min of recovery. Therefore, we
measured [Ca2+]i at this time point and observed a
relationship between higher tetanic [Ca2+]i and increased
temperature (one-way ANOVA main effect, P < 0.05,
n = 4–11 per group) (Fig. 3D–F). Importantly, this
temperature effect was absent when fibres recovered in

the absence of glucose. Together, these data are consistent
with the idea that PLFFD following fatiguing contra-
ctions is caused by a decrease in tetanic [Ca2+]i which is
dependent on muscle glycogen levels. It can be noted that
although [Ca2+]i during 30 Hz tetani was fully recovered
at 36°C, force was still decreased by �20%, which implies
that there was a contributing component of reduced
myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity (compare Fig. 3A and D).
Furthermore, the temperature-dependent differences in
recovery of tetanic [Ca2+]i at 120 Hz stimulation was
not reflected in the force, which was restored close to
the pre-fatigue force levels under all conditions. Thus,
although tetanic [Ca2+]i was decreased by �25% at 16°C
and26°C,itwasstillhighenoughtoreachsaturatinglevels.
Decreased fatigue resistance after recovery without
glucose and at low temperatures
After the 2 h recovery, FDB fibres were fatigued again with
repeated tetani (350 ms duration every 10 s) to determine
whether the temperature, and the presence or absence
of glucose affected fatigue development. Fibres that
recovered without glucose required higher stimulation
frequencies of 100–150 Hz to reach the same initial forces
asinthefirstfatiguebout(Fig.4).Theseglycogen-deprived
fibres showed a rapid decline in force during fatigue
induction. Typical force records illustrating this decrease
in fatigue resistance are shown in Fig. 4A and B. The
more rapid fatigue development in Fig. 4B is not due to
the higher stimulation frequency per se, as a typical force
recording from one of three control experiments shows
well-maintained force during stimulation with repeated
150 Hz tetani in a previously unfatigued fibre. All fibres
that underwent a recovery period without glucose showed
severely impaired fatigue resistance after the recovery
period (paired t test, P < 0.05, n = 5) (Fig. 4D). In
the presence of glucose over the 2 h recovery period,
some, but not all, fibres recovered at 16°C, 26°C, 31°C,
which may reflect slight variations in muscle glycogen
levels in the fibres and a relatively sharp glycogen–SR
Ca2+ release association. However, the recovering fibres
required higher stimulation frequencies of 100–120 Hz to

reach the same initial forces as in the first fatigue bout.
Fibres that recovered at 26°C, 31°C and 36°C sustained a
comparable number of contractions in the second fatigue
bout. Conversely, fatigue resistance was severely impaired
following 2 h recovery at the lowest temperature of 16°C
(Fig. 4C).
Next, with the rationale that a temperature-dependent
effect on glycogen restoration might be discerned when
the recovery time was shortened, we evaluated fatigue
resistance after only 1 h recovery at 26°C and 36°C,
i.e. temperatures spanning the interval where fatigue
resistancewasfullyrestoredafter2hrecovery(seeFig.4C).
All fibres recovering at 26°C required higher stimulation
frequencies of 100–120 Hz to reach the same initial forces
as in the first fatigue bout. The number of contractions
sustained until force was decreased to 30% of the starting
force in the second fatigue bout was markedly fewer
after 1 h recovery at 26°C than at 36°C (Fig. 5A–D)
and mean data show a significantly impaired endurance
after recovery at 26°C than at 36°C (unpaired t test,
P = 0.0035, n = 6–7) (Fig. 5E). Hence, endurance is
worsened following recovery at 26 than at 36°C.
To assess whether the difference in fatigue resistance
after recovery at the two temperatures reflected a major
difference in fatigue mechanisms, tetanic [Ca2+]i was
assessed at the start and end of the fatigue bouts. Tetanic
[Ca2+]i at the start of fatiguing stimulation before and
after 1 h recovery at 26°C was similar (0.76 ± 0.09 µM
vs. 0.88 ± 0.14 µM; P = 0.70); comparable values were
obtainedbeforeandafterrecoveryat36°C(0.81±0.07µM
vs. 0.92 ± 0.08 µM; P = 0.69). The typical tetanic [Ca2+]i
records in Fig. 5A–D show a similar reduction in the
fatigued state in all four conditions and mean data show
a �20% decrease in tetanic [Ca2+]i at the end of the first

fatigue bouts as well as after recovery at 26°C and 36°C
(Fig. 5F). Altogether these experiments show the same
fatigue-induced reduction in tetanic [Ca2+]i at the end
of fatigue, but that the reduction occurs faster following
recovery at 26°C compared to 36°C.
Slower glycogen resynthesis during recovery at low
temperature
To determine whether muscle glycogen resynthesis was
temperature dependent, muscle glycogen content was
measured in whole FDB muscles before and after
fatigue induction, and then 30 min after fatigue at
two recovery temperatures, 26°C and 36°C. Following
the milder fatiguing stimulation protocol, there was a
modest depletion of glycogen (one-way ANOVA main
effect, P = 0.0038; Sidak’s post hoc test, P = 0.0003,
n = 5 per group), followed by complete recovery at
both 26°C (Sidak’s post hoc test, P = 0.15, n = 5 per
group) and 36°C (Sidak’s post hoc test, P = 0.86, n = 5
per group) relative to the unfatigued (PRE) value, with
no difference in glycogen content between temperatures
(Fig. 6A) (unpaired t test, P = 0.17, n = 5 per group).
Following the more severe fatiguing stimulation protocol,
glycogen was more depleted and a clear temperature
dependence in glycogen resynthesis was revealed (one-way
ANOVA main effect, P < 0.0001, n = 6 per group), with
muscle glycogen content being fully restored after 30 min
recovery at 36°C relative to the PRE value (Sidak’s post hoc
test, P = 0.766, n = 6 per group), whereas it had only
recovered to 61 ± 11% of the PRE value at 26°C (Fig. 6B)
(Sidak’s post hoc test, P = 0.0047, n = 6 per group).
Discussion
By using an integrative approach from human whole
muscle to mice single fibre experiments, our results reveal
that intramuscular temperature affects the acute recovery
of exercise performance following fatigue. Specifically,
cooling slowed whereas heating accelerated recovery from
fatigue. At the cellular level, the slower recovery of
low-frequency (submaximal) force and fatigue resistance
at low temperature was linked to decreased tetanic [Ca2+]i
and reduced muscle glycogen resynthesis.
Our current findings in humans show that skeletal
muscle cooling during the recovery period after fatiguing
contractions results in reduced endurance, shown as a
greater relative decline in mean power output during
a bout of 3 × 5 min all-out exercise. We ascribe the
impaired recovery at low temperature to slowed glycogen
resynthesis. This assumption is based on the present
results obtained in isolated mouse FDB muscle where
there was a clear association between the recovery of sub-
maximalforceandmuscletemperature,whichwasglucose
dependent. Furthermore, glycogen resynthesis was slower
at 26°C than at 36°C (see Fig. 6B). This is consistent with
the fact that the rate of biological or chemical system
metabolic reactions generally becomes slower when the
temperature is lowered. These results are consistent with
previous data showing lower glycogen content in vastus
lateralismuscles4hafterglycogen-depletingexercisewhen
ice was applied at 30 min intervals that decreased intra-
muscular temperature by �10°C (Tucker et al. 2012). On
the other hand, others have shown no effect of lower limb
cold water immersion on muscle glycogen resynthesis
following glycogen-depleting cycling exercise (Gregson
et al. 2013). However, in that study cold water immersion
wasonlyappliedforabrief10minandmuscletemperature
only decreased to 30°C in superficial portions, and even
less in deeper parts of the muscle, which was only mini-
mally cooler than in the control condition (�35°C). In
comparison, in the present study the triceps brachii was
cooled to an average temperature of �20°C over 2 h
(see Fig. 1A). Thus, it appears safe to conclude that
glycogen resynthesis is temperature dependent, becoming
slower when the temperature is reduced for a prolonged
period. Cooling of the muscle and surrounding tissue
may also decrease glycogen resynthesis rate due to a
decreased blood flow thereby limiting glucose delivery. In
line with an increased glycogen resynthesis in the heated
muscle, we observed a higher blood lactate concentration
(see Table 1), which is consistent with previous studies
showing that higher muscle glycogen content in exercising
muscle is associated with increased muscle glycogenolysis
and greater lactate production (Hargreaves et al. 1995;
Blomstrand & Saltin, 1999). The present results provide
a mechanism for this association as a higher glycogen
content allows muscles to sustain greater power output,
and hence produce more lactate, but eventually glycogen
depletion inhibits SR Ca2+ release during fatigue.
The present experiments on isolated mouse FDB
fibres show glucose- and temperature-dependent recovery
of force and [Ca2+]i during contractions (see Fig. 3).
During recovery from fatiguing contractions there was
a significant main effect of temperature on tetanic [Ca2+]i
at all three stimulation frequencies (30, 70 and 120 Hz)

with glucose. Importantly, there was no temperature
effect when recovering with zero glucose. Further, the
depressive effect on force from lack of glucose and low
temperature was pronounced at 30 Hz, intermediate at
70 Hz, and absent at 120 Hz. The small or absent glucose-
or temperature-effect on high-frequency force is likely due
to the fact that the tetanic [Ca2+]i at 120 Hz is high enough
to reach close to saturating levels (see Fig. 3C and F). For
submaximal contractions that occur on the steep portion
of the force–[Ca2+]i relation, the fatigue protocol revealed
a more sensitive glucose- and temperature-dependent
influence on PLFFD, which could be explained by
decreased SR Ca2+ release during contractions. Notably,
this is consistent with the idea that PLFFD following
fatiguing contractions is caused by a decrease in tetanic
[Ca2+]i, which in turn is dependent on muscle glycogen
levels. A recent study showed that the intramyofibrillar
glycogen content, which is the largest store of glycogen
within muscle fibres, regulates SR Ca2+ release in isolated
mouse FDB fibres (Nielsen et al. 2014). Glycogen per se is
not required for SR Ca2+ release as this process primarily
depends on action potential-mediated activation of the
t-tubular voltage sensors, the dihydropyridine receptors
(DHPRs), which mechanically activate the SR Ca2+ release
channels, the ryanodine receptors 1 (RyR1) (Rebbeck et al.
2014). On the other hand, [ATP], [Mg2+], and [Pi] are
regulators of RyR1 opening (Duke & Steele, 2001; Laver,
2006), and their myoplasmic concentrations and spatial
distribution in muscle can be altered during fatigue (Cady
et al. 1989; Westerblad & Allen, 1992). This may especially
be evident in the restricted space of the triad junction,
with a diffusional restricted space for more than 90%
of t-systems length, and with a high metabolic activity
(Dulhunty et al. 1984). Studies on mechanically skinned
muscle fibres have shown impaired SR Ca2+ release in
glycogen-depleted fibres even when bulk myoplasmic
[ATP] is kept at baseline values (Stephenson et al. 1999;
Barnes et al. 2001; Nielsen et al. 2009), suggesting that
low global intracellular [ATP] as such cannot explain
the impaired RyR1 opening. In line with this, studies
on SR vesicles from both trained and untrained human
musclehavedemonstratedanassociationbetweenreduced
muscle glycogen and decreased SR vesicle Ca2+ release rate
(Duhamel et al. 2006; Ørtenblad et al. 2011a; Gejl et al.
2014). The fact that SR Ca2+ release is impaired at low
[glycogen] might be considered a protective mechanism
since inhibiting SR Ca2+ release in glycogen-depleted
fibres would reduce downstream ATP consumption by
the cross-bridges and SR Ca2+ pumps, thereby pre-
venting deleterious consequences of critically low [ATP]
(Ørtenblad & Nielsen, 2015; Cheng et al. 2017).
Also, the present experiments on isolated mouse
FDB fibres show (1) a glucose-dependent and (2)
a temperature-dependent recovery of endurance. As
expected, fatigue occurred very rapidly after 2 h of
recovery without glucose. This fits with previous studies
which showed severely impaired fatigue resistance when
limited or no glucose is provided during the recovery
period to isolated mouse muscle (Chin & Allen, 1997;
Helander et al. 2002) and in humans (Alghannam
et al. 2016). Furthermore, muscle glycogen resynthesis is
indeed severely blunted with minimal or no carbohydrate
provision following exercise (Maehlum & Hermansen,
1978; Alghannam et al. 2016). In line with this, muscle
glucose utilization is higher when plasma glucose levels
are increased during exercise by ingestion of carbohydrate
(McConell et al. 1994). Furthermore, a temperature effect
on fatigue resistance was observed with more rapid
fatigue after 2 h recovery at 16°C (see Fig. 4). Also,
fibres recovering for 1 h were more fatigue resistant after
recovery at 36°C than at 26°C (see Fig. 5). A reasonable
explanation for these observations is that fibres recovering

at lower temperatures (16°C or 26°C) contained less
glycogen at the start of the second fatigue bout than those
recovering at higher temperatures (36°C), such that a
glycogen-dependent decrease in SR Ca2+ release occurred
faster during repeated contractions as can be observed
for instance in Fig. 5A vs. B at the same time point (e.g. at
�250s).Thisisinlinewiththeideaofacriticalsetquantity
of glycogen below which SR Ca2+ release is impaired
(Ørtenblad & Nielsen, 2015). Supporting this argument
is the finding that fibres that recovered at 26°C and 36°C
reached the same reduction in tetanic [Ca2+]i at the end
of fatigue (Fig. 5F), suggestive of fibres reaching a critical
glycogen concentration which eventually impairs SR Ca2+
release.
We show that PLFFD develops after fatigue-induced
by endurance exercise. This PLFFD is related to reduced
tetanic [Ca2+]i, although there is also a component of
decreased myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity; for instance, after
30 min recovery at 36°C 30 Hz force was still decreased by
�20% despite full recovery of [Ca2+]i (see Fig. 3A and D).
Previously, PLFFD following metabolically demanding,
high-intensity exercise has been linked to defective SR
Ca2+ releaseand/ordecreasedmyofibrillarCa2+ sensitivity
via reactive oxygen–nitrogen species-dependent mecha-
nisms (Cheng et al. 2016), whereas PLFFD following
repeated high-force eccentric contractions is related
to myofibrillar damage that impairs force generating
capacity (Skurvydas et al. 2016). Our current findings
add a glycogen-dependent mechanism to PLFFD.
Conclusion
Recovery interventions involving muscle temperature
manipulation have been commonly adopted by athletes
to improve recovery following different forms of exercise.
A major assumption underlying the usage of muscle
cooling is that it reduces inflammation induced by
high-load, high-power exercise, e.g. during resistance
exercise that might induce some muscle damage (Leeder
et al. 2012; Ihsan et al. 2016). However, recent results
show that local cooling does not decrease the muscle
inflammatory response, or reduce indicators of muscle
damage following acute resistance exercise (Peake et al.
2017), and it may blunt muscle protein synthesis
during long-term resistance training (Roberts et al.
2015). The extent to which muscle cooling influences
acute recovery of muscle performance following end-
urance exercise has not been previously addressed.
Our results show a clear positive relationship between
increased muscle temperature and the recovery of
force and endurance of exercised muscle, given that
carbohydrate is provided during the recovery period.
Cryotherapy is a popular post-exercise recovery modality,
but we provide mechanistic evidence that lowering the
temperature of limb muscles following endurance-type
exercise exacerbates PLFFD, slows glycogen resynthesis,
and impairs fatigue resistance during subsequent exercise.
Indeed, temperature directly affects metabolism in all
living organisms, with increasing temperature generally
accelerating biochemical reactions (Gillooly et al. 2001).
Critical to intramuscular glycogen resynthesis is muscle
glucose uptake via GLUT4 in the sarcolemma, and
glycogen polymer resynthesis through glycogen synthase
activation (Jensen & Richter, 2012). While it seems
that the number of GLUT4 glucose transporters trans-
locating to the sarcolemma is not markedly affected by
temperature (Somwar et al. 2001), glucose uptake into the
fibre (Somwar et al. 2001), and the activity of glycogen
synthase would slow down when the temperature is
reduced. Whether or not used by endurance athletes,
the current results argue against prolonged cryotherapy
as an effective recovery method for athletes performing
prolonged exhaustive exercise where the rate of recovery of
muscle force-generating capacity, endurance and glycogen
resynthesis can play a critical role; for instance, in
competitive sports that require multiple races to be
performed in the same day, or in prolonged events
performed over consecutive days.
