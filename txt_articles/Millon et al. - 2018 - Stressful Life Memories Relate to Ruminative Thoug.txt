More than one in every four women in the world experience sexual violence (SV) in
their lifetime, most often as teenagers and young adults. These traumatic experiences
leave memories in the brain, which are difficult if not impossible to forget. We asked
whether women with SV history experience stronger memories of their most stressful life
event than women without SV history and if so, whether strength relates to ruminative
and trauma-related thoughts. Using the Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire (AMQ),
women with SV history (n = 64) reported this memory as especially strong (p < 0.001),
remembering more sensory and contextual details, compared to women without SV
history (n = 119). They further considered the event a significant part of their personal life
story. The strength of the memory was highly correlated with posttraumatic cognitions
and ruminative thoughts, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety (p’s < 0.001,
n = 183). A third (33%) of the women with SV history were diagnosed with posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but PTSD alone did not account for the increase in memory
strength (p’s < 0.001). These data suggest that the experience of SV increases
the strength of stressful autobiographical memories, which are then reexperienced
in everyday life during posttraumatic and ruminative thoughts. We propose that the
repeated rehearsal of vivid stressful life memories generates more trauma memories in
the brain, making the experience of SV even more difficult to forget.

INTRODUCTION
Sexual violence (SV) against women is common in today’s world with numbers upward of 25%
(1, 2). Most experiences occur during adolescence and young adulthood, when women are most
vulnerable (3). The numbers are also high for women in college. Several years ago, the White House
Task Force partnered with the Bureau of Justice to survey SV on nine college campuses. Of nearly
15,000 responders, ∼10% reported SV during college (4). Other surveys suggest numbers closer to
25% (5, 6). Percentages are even higher (32%) for women in the same age group but not enrolled in
college (6).
Memories of an extremely stressful life event tend to be easily recalled and are generally stronger
than memories of normal-day experience (7–9). They also change with time as the memory is

rehearsed and/or avoided (10). When a memory is reactivated,
it becomes associated with the new context (11). If the context
is safe and/or neutral, the strength of the memory may lessen
and its expression can extinguish. This process of “extinction”
forms the basis of exposure therapy, the most accepted evidence-
based intervention for people with trauma history (12). The
memory is not erased from the brain but exposure therapy is
effective because cues associated with the event are less likely
to elicit the conditioned fear response. However, others theorize
that rehearsing the trauma memory can strengthen the memory
simply because it is being reactivated and reconsolidated over
and over again. Because of these concerns, it is important to
understand more fully how someone relives the memory of an
extremely stressful life event, such as sexual violence. Does the
person remember when and where the event took place more or
less than the feelings associated with the event? Does he or she
tend to remember discrete sensory details such as the sounds and
smells or rather is the memory relived like a movie in sequence?
Does he or she feel as if traveling back in time or is the memory
experienced in the present moment?
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness
characterized by persistent trauma-related thoughts after an
extremely stressful life event (13). Most individuals who
experience SV do not go on to develop PTSD but are at high
risk. In fact, of all traumas, rape is the most likely to induce
PTSD (13, 14). A diagnosis includes some combination of
intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, avoidance behaviors, numbness
or hyperarousal, along with disruption of normal life function
(15). Although many people with PTSD suffer from symptoms of
depression and anxiety (11, 16), trauma memories are the source
of most problems (17, 18). According to Rubin and colleagues,
“PTSD is defined in large part by changes that occur specifically
in autobiographical memory” (19). To assess the strength of
these memories, they developed the Autobiographical Memory
Questionnaire (AMQ), which asks questions related to the details
of an autobiographical memory, typically framed as a negative
event in their past. In response to the AMQ, individuals with
PTSD recalled negative autobiographical events with greater
strength compared to people without PTSD, and the strength of
the memory correlated with PTSD symptoms (9, 19–21). They
interpret these and other findings to suggest that the repeated
rehearsal of an intense memory experience may exacerbate PTSD
symptoms over time and contribute to one’s life story (19). To our
knowledge, the AMQ has not been used to assess the strength of
stressful life memories in women who experienced the trauma
of SV while adolescents and young adults, as it relates to the
diagnosis of PTSD.
Rumination is defined as the repeated rehearsal of thoughts.
These thoughts are usually autobiographical, negative in nature
and about the past. They are also described as uncontrollable
and involuntary. Historically, rumination was considered a trait
and thus relatively stable. As such, the tendency to ruminate was
considered a potential risk factor for PTSD (22, 23). However,
more recent data suggest that rumination is malleable and can
be decreased significantly by interventions, which target trauma
memories (24–27). In general, ruminative thoughts have been
most often associated with depression, although recent studies,
including our own, indicate a strong relationship to trauma (22,
28). But exactly how they relate to trauma is unclear. Minimally,
they exacerbate trauma-related thoughts through the repetition
of trauma memories (28) and as discussed, each time a memory
is retrieved, a new memory is made through its association with
the context in which it is expressed. Thus, at a neuroscience level,
one could hypothesize that the repetitive and largely involuntary
rehearsal of a trauma memory creates yet more memories of
the trauma and related memories in the brain. A related theory,
known as the “multiple trace theory” was developed by Nadel
and Moscovitch to account for the persistence of memories
(29–31). We extend their theory to suggest that the repeated
rehearsal of a vivid autobiographical memory during rumination
generates more trauma memories, thereby making the trauma
more difficult to “forget.” The purpose of the present study was to
investigate the relationship between rumination and the strength
of autobiographical memories in women with SV history.
In the present study, we hypothesized that women with SV
history would report autobiographical memories of a stressful
life event as more intense than women without SV history,
even in the absence of PTSD. It was hypothesized that women
who ruminate more would also report stronger stressful life
memories. We further hypothesized that the experience of SV
history rather than the diagnosis of PTSD per se, would influence
the expression of ruminative thoughts and intensity of stressful
memories. Finally, we hypothesized that the relationship between
the stressful life memory and rumination would relate to the
numbers of trauma-related cognitions, as well as anxious and
depressive symptoms. Adult women who experienced SV during
and after puberty were evaluated because most women are
assaulted during this time period and because memory processes
for events that occur in childhood may be different from those
acquired later (3). To test the hypotheses, we relied on statistical
analyses of group differences between women with and without
SV history as well as correlations among outcomes within
individuals.

Stressful Memories of Sexual Trauma
assessed for trauma history with a structured clinical interview,
completed a series of questionnaires (described below) and
then completed the working memory task (total session ∼2 h).
Afterwards, participants were debriefed and compensated ($20
or research credits).
Materials
All participants were assessed for trauma history with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID; 15) by a doctoral
psychology graduate student trained in conducting clinical
interviews. Trauma exposure was defined according to the DSM-
5 as direct exposure to “an event or events that involved actual
or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation to the self”
(32). The age of participant at time of trauma was also recorded
and used to select only those participants with trauma history
during adolescence or young adulthood for analyses.
The
Autobiographical
Memory
Questionnaire
[AMQ;
(33)] is a 19-item questionnaire that assesses qualities of
an
autobiographical
memory.
Given
the
breadth
of
the
questionnaire, typically items are scored individually or in
clusters, depending on the research question of interest (20). We
were especially interested in the sensory details and vividness
of details related to the memory rather than the accuracy of the
memory itself. Therefore, we did not assess items concerning
confidence of the memory or dating the event. We also wanted
to protect their privacy and therefore, did not ask them to
identify the event. Participants were told to respond to the
questionnaire in relation to an autobiographical memory of the
most stressful event in your life. We included 12 individual items
which assessed the rehearsal of the memory, sensory details
(“As I remember the event, I can hear it in my mind” or “see
it in my mind”), temporal and spatial details (“As I remember
the event, I know its temporal and spatial layout”), emotional
intensity (“As I remember the event, I feel the emotions now
that I felt then”), and significance (“the memory is significant
in my life”). Total scores were calculated, with greater scores
representing heightened vividness of details related to a stressful
autobiographical memory. This task has been used in the past
to distinguish between types of memory systems activated
during recall, particularly in participants with PTSD symptoms
(7, 19, 20, 34).
The Symmetry Span Task was used to assess working
memory (35). Developed by Engle and colleagues, the computer
task required participants to make assessments of symmetrical
pictures while remembering the temporal order and spatial
location of a series of squares individually displayed on a grid.
Participants were shown a picture and were asked to respond
whether it was symmetrical or not. Immediately following, a 1
× 1 square in a 4 × 4 grid appeared on the screen for 2-s.
Pairs of pictures and squares were presented 2–5 times per trial,
for 12 trials (3 blocks total). Following stimulus presentations,
participants were asked to replicate the location of the squares
in the order presented. The task required ∼20 min to complete.
Data from the working memory task yielded partial and absolute
accuracy scores. A partial accuracy score was a sum of all
correct responses. An absolute accuracy score was the sum of
correct responses in completely correct trials, when the order and
location of all squares were correctly identified during the trial
(all-or-none system).
The Ruminative Responses Scale [RRS; (36)] is a 22-item
questionnaire that assesses thoughts and responses to depressed
mood and affect. Examples of RRS items include “thinking
about how sad you feel,” “thinking about your shortcomings,
failings, and mistakes” or “analyzing events to understand why
you feel depressed or unmotivated.” The RRS is scored as a
summation of responses (min 22; max 88) as well as according
to three subscales: (1) depressive ruminations, which relate to the
rehearsal of depressive events, (2) brooding ruminations, which
are often non-adaptive and emotion-laden, and (3) reflective
ruminations, which are not as maladaptive but self-focused (37,
38).
The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) is a 33-item
questionnaire that assesses altered cognitions related to traumatic
life experiences (16). The PTCI is composed of three subscales:
thoughts related to oneself (i.e., sees oneself as blameworthy,
isolated, unreliable), others (i.e., sees them as untrustworthy),
and the world (i.e., sees it as a dangerous place). The purpose
of the PTCI is to assess the person’s reaction to the event after
time has passed and includes items such as “I have to be on guard
all the time,” “I feel like I don’t know myself anymore,” and “I feel
isolated.” We altered the prompt to ask participants about their
thoughts and feelings related to the most stressful event of your
life. This way, women with no trauma history could also report
their thoughts and feelings of a past event. We also wanted to
use the same prompt as used for the AMQ. Higher PTCI scores
are indicative of more negative posttraumatic cognitions and are
generally associated with greater numbers of PTSD symptoms
(24).
The Beck Depression Inventory [BDI; (39)] is a 21-item
questionnaire that measures symptoms of depression. The Beck
Anxiety Inventory [BAI; (40)] is a 21-item questionnaire that
measures symptoms of anxiety. For both measures, total scores
are computed by adding response choices. Scores greater than 20
on the BDI represent moderate to severe depression and scores
greater than 20 on the BAI are consistent with moderate to
severe anxiety. Both questionnaires are commonly used to assess
cognitions associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety,
respectively (41–43).
Statistical Analyses
Dependent variables were obtained from self-report scores from
the respective questionnaires with independent variables based
on violence, PTSD, or trauma history. Independent samples
t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to test
differences in mental health outcomes (AMQ, Working Memory
task, RRS, PTCI, BDI, BAI) between groups without (no-SV,
n = 119) and with history of SV (SV, n = 64). The sample was
divided further to account for PTSD diagnosis: no-SV, SV-no
PTSD (n = 43), SV+PTSD (n = 21). When analyzing groups
based on SV history and PTSD diagnosis, ANOVAs and Fisher’s
least significance difference (LSD) post-hoc test were used to
uncover differences in the strength of autobiographical memories
and ruminative thoughts between groups.

Stressful Memories of Sexual Trauma
Relationships among all outcome measures are presented as
Pearson rho correlations. Statistical analyses were assessed with
SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., 2017) and a significance level of
p < 0.05 was used for all analyses, with Bonferroni corrections for
the AMQ. Effect sizes are presented as partial eta-squared (η2) in
order to quantify meaningful differences in dependent outcomes
between women with and without SV history. Typically, partial
η2 effect sizes are categorized as 0.01 (small), 0.09 (medium), and
0.25 (large) (44).
RESULTS
Sexual Violence History With and Without
PTSD
Approximately one-third of women with SV history (n = 21) met
diagnostic criteria for current PTSD according to SCID-5 criteria.
Women with SV history regardless of PTSD diagnosis averaged
seven current PTSD symptoms (SD = 5, range 0–19). Women
with exposure to trauma other than SV (n = 19) averaged one
current PTSD symptom.
Autobiographical Memory
The cumulative AMQ score from items 1–12 was calculated for
women with SV history vs. women without SV history. Women
with SV history reported a significantly stronger memory of
their most stressful life event compared to women with no
history of SV F(1, 181) = 11.75, p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.06
(Figure 1A). Women with SV and PTSD did not report higher
AMQ scores than women with SV but no PTSD, F(2, 180) = 6.53,
p > 0.05, but they did report higher AMQ scores than no-trauma
controls. Women with SV history but no PTSD reported stronger
AMQ memory scores compared to women without SV history
(p < 0.05).
Items on the AMQ were analyzed for group differences.
To correct for multiple comparisons and avoid Type 1 Errors,
Bonferroni corrections were applied to a p-value of 0.05 (0.05/11
comparisons of 12 AMQ items = 0.005). Therefore, a p-value less
than 0.005 was necessary to establish significance. Group scores
were significantly different for three items (Figure 1B). Women
with SV history (1) reported more details related to seeing the
event in their mind, t(181) = −3.73, p < 0.001, (2) indicated more
details related to the spatial layout of the memory t(181) = −3.35,
p < 0.001, and (3) reported the autobiographical memory as
significantly more central to their life story, t(181) = −4.03,
p < 0.001. Group responses did not differ significantly on the
other nine items assessed by the AMQ, p > 0.005, with the
Bonferroni correction, although the overall AMQ score was
significantly larger in women with SV history.
Working Memory
Data collected for spatial and temporal working memory with the
Symmetry Span task were analyzed. Sixty five participants did not
complete the task due to technical problems. Women with SV
history (n = 48) did not significantly differ from women without

0.05, or absolute accuracy, t(119.93) = 1.29, p > 0.05.
Ruminative Thoughts
Women with SV history reported ∼15% more rumination
as assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS)
compared to women without SV history, F(1, 181) = 12.15,
p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.06 (Figure 2A). RRS subscales for
the depressive, brooding and reflective thoughts were analyzed
(Figures 2B–D). Women with SV history reported 17% more
depressive rumination compared to women without SV history,
F(1, 181) = 12.51, p <
0.001. Women with SV history
reported 11% more brooding compared to women without
SV history, F(1, 181) = 5.54, p < 0.001. Additionally, women
with SV history also reported 14% more reflection compared
to women without SV history, F(1, 181) = 8.32, p < 0.001.
Women significantly differed on RRS scores depending on
PTSD diagnosis, F(2, 180) = 8.46, p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.09.
Fisher’s LSD post-hoc test revealed that women with SV and
PTSD reported more rumination than women with SV but no
PTSD, p < 0.05. Women with SV and no PTSD reported more
rumination than women without SV, p < 0.05.
Trauma-Related Thoughts, Depression and
Anxiety
Women with SV history reported 26% more posttraumatic
cognitions as assessed on the PTCI compared to women without
SV history, F(1, 181) = 38.42, p <
0.001, Partial η2 = 0.18
(Figure 4A). PTCI subscales of self, world and others were
analyzed. Women with SV history significantly differed from
the no-SV group on all three PTCI subscales of self-blame,
negative thoughts about the world and of others (p’s < 0.01).
Women significantly differed on PTCI scores depending on
PTSD diagnosis, F(2, 180) = 24.87, p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.22.
Fisher’s LSD post-hoc test revealed that women with SV and
PTSD reported more posttraumatic cognitions than women with
SV but no PTSD, p < 0.05. Women with SV and no PTSD
reported more posttraumatic cognitions than women without SV,
p < 0.01.
Women with SV history reported 44% more depressive
symptoms

significantly differed on BDI scores depending on PTSD
diagnosis, F(2, 180) = 15.34, p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.15. Fisher’s
LSD post-hoc test revealed that women with SV and PTSD
reported over 50% more depressive symptoms than women with
SV and no PTSD, as well as women without SV, p’s < 0.05.
Women with SV and no PTSD also had more depressive
symptoms than women without SV, p = 0.001.
Women with SV history reported twice as many anxiety
symptoms as assessed on the BAI compared to women without
SV history, F(1, 181) = 25.09, p < 0.001, Partial η2 = 0.12 (equal
variances not assumed) (Figure 4C). Differences in anxiety
depended on PTSD diagnosis, F(2, 180) = 16.59, p < 0.001, Partial
η2 = 0.16. Fisher’s LSD post-hoc test revealed that women with
SV and PTSD reported over 70% more anxious symptoms than

women with SV and no PTSD, as well as women without SV,
p’s < 0.05. Women with SV and no PTSD had more anxious
symptoms than women without SV, p < 0.01.
Individual Differences
As summarized in Table 1, women who reported more
ruminative thoughts (higher RRS scores) reported a greater
number of details surrounding an autobiographical memory
of a past stressful event and more posttraumatic cognitions
(p < 0.001; Figure 3). Relationships among depressive, anxious
and posttraumatic symptoms across the entire sample were
highly significant (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we asked whether stressful life memories would
be reported as more intense in women with a history of sexual
trauma and if so, whether they would relate to posttraumatic
cognitions and ruminative thoughts within individuals. We also
asked whether these relationships would occur irrespective of

a PTSD diagnosis. Researchers have long been interested in
questions such as these (20, 34, 45–47). The AMQ was developed
by Rubin and colleagues to answer some of these questions
(33). Through a series of studies, they established traumatic
memory recall as part of a basic memory system rather than
its own specific system. In other words, the processes through
which autobiographical memories of stressful life events are
recalled may not be substantively different from the way that
other memories are recalled. We used their autobiographical
memory questionnaire here to compare the strength of stressful
life memories in women with and without SV history and further
to compare responses in women who did and did not meet
criteria for current PTSD. We predicted that women with SV
history would report a stressful life memory as more intense
compared to responses from women without SV history and this
response would not depend on the concurrent diagnosis of PTSD.
As predicted, SV in the past, irrespective of PTSD diagnosis, was
associated with a stronger reported memory experience. Thus,
SV is sufficient to establish an especially strong autobiographical
memory of a very stressful life event upon recall.
In the present study, women with SV history not only reported
a stronger stressful life memory, they reported specific details as
being especially prevalent (Figure 1A). They were more likely
to: (1) see the event in their mind, (2) recall its temporal
and spatial layout, and (3) consider the memory a significant
part of their life story (Figure 1B). They did not report the
“feelings” associated with the memory as more intense, nor did
they report more “reliving” of the memory, when compared
to women without SV history reflecting on the most stressful
event in their life. These differences in memory detail suggest
that the memory for a SV event is experienced as watching a
movie rather than a body response, per se. Of course, memories
for trauma are experienced in the body—the participants just
did not report it as more intense. One limitation of this study
is that we did not ask participants to identify the event they
were reflecting upon and therefore do not necessarily know
whether women were recalling the sexually violent experience.
Nonetheless, these data suggest that memories for stressful life
events are especially vivid in sensory and contextual detail as
well as meaningful for women who have had a sexually violent
experience.
Working memory is a learning process, which allows the
brain to hold and manipulate information in short-term memory,
usually in the service of completing a cognitive task or skill
(48). Women with SV history performed a working memory
task just as well as women without SV history. These findings
are generally consistent with others (49). For example, college
students with interpersonal trauma history performed just as well
on tests of working memory and cognitive flexibility (using digit-
span and card-sorting tasks) as students without trauma history
(50). Another study compared the recall of autobiographical
to nonautobiographical memories in individuals with PTSD.
Whereas, autobiographical memories were more disorganized,
nonautobiographical memories were not (51). These data and
those we report here suggest that trauma and/or violence history
is more likely to impact stressful life memories rather than
general memory processes.
The psychological mechanisms through which SV and
memory interact is not without controversy (45, 52). Many
studies point to disorganization of memory (10, 51). Rape victims
often describe their memories as emotionally intense but lacking
coherence (53), whereas other victims report memories rich
in detail. A recent study asked survivors of domestic violence
to write a narrative about a traumatic event and a positive
experience (54). The trauma narratives were detailed and more
coherent than the memories of a positive experience, and were
better predictors of PTSD. The underlying psychopathology, if
present, is also important. For example, undergraduates with
PTSD reported more sensory details of a traumatic event whereas
undergraduates with depression recorded fewer details (55).
Age also seems to matter. For example, children sometimes
dissociate during trauma and as a consequence, may have
difficulty remembering what happened (56). We only tested
women who had experienced SV during or after puberty. Their
responses suggest a strong detailed memory for their most
stressful life event, which is consistent with some studies in adults
(45, 57).
Ruminations
Ruminations generate intrusive memories which can extend
the persistence of PTSD (58, 59). In the present study,
women with SV history reported they tend to ruminate about
15% more than women without SV history (Figure 2A).
These women also reported significantly more depressive,
brooding and reflective ruminations. Rumination was further
associated with posttraumatic cognitions, which are indicative
of PTSD symptomology. These data are consistent with meta-
analyses, indicating positive relationships between rumination
and posttraumatic symptoms, even years after the trauma
(57, 60–63). The mechanisms through which ruminative
and posttraumatic thoughts interact are unknown. In one
study, individuals with PTSD described their ruminations
as uncontrollable thoughts about critical life events (28). In
our study, women with SV history and PTSD reported more
ruminations than women with SV history and no PTSD, who
in turn reported more ruminations than women without SV

history. Therefore, PTSD symptoms are associated with a greater
tendency to ruminate but exposure to SV on its own is sufficient
to increase rumination. Of course, we cannot determine whether
the tendency to ruminate predates trauma exposure and
consequently exacerbates the development of trauma-related
symptoms later in life, though other studies suggest this may be
the case (22).
Relations Among Ruminative Thoughts
and Stressful Life Memories
In general, participants who reported one outcome in this
study were more likely to report another outcome (Table 1).
Strong correlations among responses may not be especially
surprising because the questions on the various questionnaires do
overlap. But even so, the correlations were strong and pervasive.
For this study, we focused primarily on the relationship
between rumination and stressful life memories (Figure 3).
The correlation between RRS and AMQ scores was highly
significant across the entire sample, as shown in Table 1; the
correlation between RRS and AMQ for SV without PTSD
was significant, albeit less strong (r = 0.33; p < 0.05). To
our knowledge, no study to date has reported a positive
relationship between rumination and autobiographical memory
detail in women with sexual trauma exposure but not necessarily
experiencing PTSD. To interpret these results, we come back
to the “multiple memory trace” hypothesis. Each time a
memory is activated in a new context, additional details
are incorporated into the memory and a new “hippocampal
trace” memory is generated (29, 30, 64–66). These learning
processes in the hippocampus can interact with stress as well.
In one study, people watched a stressful film and later were
exposed to cues, which reactivated the memory for the film.
Those who did so under stressful conditions (high cortisol)
reported more intrusive memories than those who did so under
unstressed conditions (67). A similar process may be occurring
in women with SV history. According to their self-report
surveys, they often rehearse trauma memories. The rehearsals
are likely done under stressful conditions because the women
are experiencing moderate levels of depression and anxiety. We
propose these involuntary rehearsals generate new memories
with new contextual details in the brain, which become more
difficult to extinguish.
The positive relationship between rumination and memory
reported here is different from other reports. Kleim and
Ehlers (68) observed less detail for autobiographical memories
in individuals with acute stress disorder (68). Moreover, the
correlation between memory detail and rumination was negative.
There are some key differences between studies. In theirs,
memories were provoked with cues using the Autobiographical
Memory Test (AMT) and thus different in content from “the
most stressful life memory” retrieved during the AMQ. Also,
their assessments were within weeks of the trauma and ours
were generally much later. But interestingly, they conclude that
an overgeneralized memory is not necessarily the result of
trauma, per se, but rather a predisposition to depression, which
arises as a result of trauma. The literature connecting trauma
with autobiographical memory is extensive and implicates other
factors such as avoidance behavior and executive control (17, 18,
69). Others studies propose even more complicated relationships
(70–74). It is difficult to directly compare our results with these
because of the methodological differences and because most
of our participants did not have PTSD. In general, there does
appear to be a strong relationship between rumination and the
strength of autobiographical memory recall, but the direction
of this relationship depends on the experimental question and
procedures, as well as the presence of PTSD and/or other mental
disorders such as depression.
Rumination is considered a risk factor for depression, in
part because women tend to ruminate more than men do and
are more often diagnosed with depression (75, 76). However,
FIGURE 3 | (A) Recall of an autobiographical memory of a past stressful event as assessed by the Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire (AMQ) and
(B) trauma-related thoughts as assessed with the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) correlated with ruminative thoughts as assessed by the Ruminative
Responses Scale (RRS).

Stressful Memories of Sexual Trauma
FIGURE 4 | (A) Women with sexual violence history reported significantly more posttraumatic cognitions as assessed by the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory
(PTCI), (B) more depressive symptoms as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and (C) more anxiety symptoms as assessed by the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI) compared to women with no sexual violence history. *p < 0.001.
rumination per se does not necessarily account for the high
incidence of depression in women (37). In one of our recent
studies, both men and women with high numbers of depressive
symptoms reported more ruminative thoughts, but there were
no sex differences in the relationship. With that being said,
because women are more likely to ruminate and more likely
to experience sexual violence, it is reasonable to assume that
these ruminations may exacerbate the symptoms of depression,
as previously suggested (68). Of course, not all ruminations are
maladaptive and some degree of reflection is necessary in order
to learn how to recover from trauma (77).
Trauma-Related Thoughts and Symptoms
of Anxiety and Depression
Women with SV history had PTCI scores greater than 120,
which is relatively high (Figure 4A), especially because most of
them were not diagnosed with PTSD (16). However, participants
without trauma history also had relatively high PTCI scores (16).
These differences are easily explained. We asked participants to
reflect on the most “stressful event” in their lifetime, rather than
the most “traumatic event.” We did this in order to compare
responses between participants with and without trauma history
but obviously, this procedure would increase PTCI scores across
groups. Importantly though, women with SV history reported
more trauma-related thoughts than women without SV history.
And women with SV and PTSD reported more posttraumatic
thoughts than women with SV history and no PTSD.
Most women with SV history did not meet diagnostic criteria
for a depressive or anxiety disorder, as diagnosed by the SCID.
As a group, their BDI scores were consistent with a mild
mood disturbance (39) and BAI scores were consistent with
mild anxiety (40). Overall, these data indicate a significant
yet moderate elevation of anxiety and depressive symptoms in
response to SV history. Others report similar findings in college
students with violence history (78, 79). These results likely reflect
low level activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the
hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, both of which are associated
with the persistent expression of symptoms of depression and
anxiety (80–84).
Sex Differences
We concentrated on women and not men for several reasons.
First, women are four times more likely to experience SV
compared to men, and women between ages 12 and 34 are most
likely to experience sexual assault (2, 6). Second, college-age
women report sexual assault as the most traumatic event of their
lifetime when compared to men (53% compared to 11%) (85).
And third, women are more likely than men to develop assault-
related and stress-related disorders such as PTSD, presumably
because they are more frequently exposed to sexually violent
events, but also perhaps due to biological differences in stress-
related systems (86, 87).
The impact of SV on the human brain is difficult to study,
in part because studies must be retrospective and variability
between individual experiences is substantial (86, 88–90). To
meet this need, we developed an animal model known as SCAR,
which stands for Sexual Conspecific Aggressive Response. During
this procedure, a young female rat in puberty is exposed to
an adult sexually-experienced male each day for 30 min. As
a result, female rats produced high levels of stress hormones
and did not learn as well in standard laboratory training tasks.
They also retained fewer new neurons in the hippocampus, a
part of the brain necessary for many types of learning (91).
These data suggest that the experience of sexual aggression
can affect neuronal processes related to learning and memory,
even neurogenesis. However, these results must be interpreted
with caution; it is not possible to directly compare results from
laboratory animal studies to women with SV history because the
conditions surrounding the stressful events are different in many
ways and levels of organization.

Stressful Memories of Sexual Trauma
Learning to Recover
Sexual violence against women is an all too common occurrence
and recent attention from the media is long overdue (1, 3).
But this problem will not go away soon and we must keep
our attention focused on prevention and justice for survivors.
We must also find new ways to help women learn to recover.
The most accepted course of treatment is Prolonged Exposure
Therapy (PET) (12, 16, 24, 92), during which the client recollects
the trauma memory during interviews, story-writing and even
revisiting the traumatic location. After repeated exposure, the
strength of the memory often lessens and the conditioned
responses of fear and anxiety begin to extinguish (93, 94).
Theoretically, the memory becomes less accessible in part
because it has been updated and reconsolidated with other safer
memories (95). Effective as it is, PET is time-consuming and
can be expensive. Also, clients often drop out because it is
emotionally painful to rehearse and relive the memory.
We recently developed a novel intervention to help women
recover from the trauma of SV (26, 27, 96). The intervention
is known as MAP Training because it combines “Mental And
Physical” Training. Each session combines 30 min of mental
training with silent meditation followed by 30 min of aerobic
exercise. After 6 weeks of training, twice a week, women with
SV history reported significantly fewer trauma-related cognitions
and ruminative thoughts than women with SV history who
were trained with meditation alone or exercise alone. Women
who completed MAP Training also reported greater self-worth
than the other training groups (26). It is unclear how this
intervention works to reduce rumination and trauma-related
thoughts. Women in the study completed the AMQ as well.
Interestingly, scores did not change in women who completed
training but increased in women who did not train. These
data may suggest that fewer trauma-related and ruminative
thoughts lessen the likelihood that the memory will strengthen
over time.
CONCLUSION
Women who experienced SV as adolescents or young adults
reported intense memories for stressful life events, irrespective
of PTSD. The strength of these memories was highly related
to ruminative and trauma-related thoughts within individuals,
as were symptoms of depression and anxiety. Theoretically,
these data support the idea that ruminative thoughts and vivid
memories of stressful life events coexist and are especially
prominent in women who have experienced sexual violence.
Thus, rumination may be an especially effective target for trauma
recovery, because fewer ruminations would produce fewer vivid
memories of trauma in the brain.
