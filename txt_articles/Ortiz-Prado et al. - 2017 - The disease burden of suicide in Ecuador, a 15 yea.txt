Abstract
Background: Suicide affects people from different backgrounds, ethnical groups, socio-economic status and
geographical locations. In Latin America, suicide reports arescarce, specially in Andean countries. In Ecuador, very
few reports have partially described this phenomenon, nonetheless, estimation of the burden of disease (BoD)
hasnever been reported in the country.
Methods: A country-wide comparison was performed using the Ministry of Public Health’s national databases of
overall mortality, Hospital Discharges Database, and the Population Census of the National Institute of Census and
Statistics (INEC). The study variables analyzed were age, geographical distribution to provincial level, sex, means of
suicide, educational attainment, marital status and mortality. Linear Regression and relative Risk analysis were used
to predict outcome and the likelihood that suicide occur among study variables.
Results: In the last 15 years, 13,024 suicides were officially reported. Men were 3 times more likely than women to
die by suicide. The overall age-adjusted suicide ratio in Ecuador corresponds to 7.1 per 100,000 per year. The sex-
specific rates were 5.3 in women and 13.2 in men. The primary mean of suicide was hanging X70 (51.1%), followed
by self-poisoning X68-X69 (35.2%) and firearms X72-X74 (7.6%). Provinces located at higher altitude reported higher
rates than those located at sea level (9 per 100,000 vs 4.5 per 100.000). The total economic loss due to suicide was
estimated to be $852.6 million during the 15 years’ analysis.
Conclusions: This is the first geodemographic study exploring the complete burden of suicide in Ecuador and one
of the very few in Latin-America. In the last 15 years of available data, Ecuador ranks above the regional average
with an adjusted suicide rate of 7.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. An important finding is that Suicide affects rather
younger populations, adding more than 10,000 years of premature years of life lost (YYL) between 2001 and 2015,
becoming the first and fourth leading cause of death among adolescent women and men respectively.
Suicide affects people from different backgrounds, socioeconomic status and educational attainment. The mean of
suicide changed over time showing that gun and pesticides related deaths decreased significantly since 2001, while
hanging and suffocation increased in more than 50%.

 Background
Suicide affects people from different backgrounds, ethnical
groups, socio-economic status and geographical locations
[1–3]. Suicide can be defined as any deliberated act by
which an individual’s death results directly or indirectly
from a self-inflicted injury or poisoning [4, 5]. Suicide is a
global health problem, ranking between 4th to 20th cause
of mortality for any given region in the world [6, 7]. Ac-
cording to the World Health Organization (WHO),a per-
son commits suicide every 40 s [1]. In 2012, suicide
accounted for 1.4% of all deaths worldwide, the majority
occurring in low- and middle-income countries [8, 9].
Suicide rates vary across countries, ranging from less
than 1 per 100,000 deaths in Saudi Arabia and Belize to
more than 40 per 100,000 deaths per year in Guyana or
Lithuania [1, 10]. The Global Burden of Disease Group
(GBD) reported that in 2013, more than 840,000 people
died from self-harm worldwide [7]. According to this re-
port, suicide was the 14th leading cause of years of life
lost in the world [7].
Suicide is a multifactorial problem influenced by genetic,
psychological, cultural and environmental factors [11].
Several risk factors for suicide have been clearly docu-
mented, e.g. male sex, younger age, having a psychiatric
disorder such as depression and schizophrenia, hopeless-
ness, marital status, white race, low income, owning fire-
arms, incarceration, job loss and drug abuse [12–18].
Recently, a positive association between altitude gradient
and suicide has been described [19].
It is estimated that about 30% of suicides in the world
are committed by poisoning with pesticides, hangings or
firearms, and the means of suicide depend greatly on the
availability and access to the lethal object used by the
person [20, 21].
In Latin America, the highest mortality rate comes
from Uruguay; a small country with a little more than
three million people reported more than 15 per 100,000
deaths per year from suicide in 2012 [6, 22]. Other
countries like Guatemala (2.5/100.000), Venezuela (3/
100.000) or Peru (5.8/100.000), reported more lower
rates, averaging 3.7 per 100,000 deaths in 2012 [6].
In South America suicide rates change according to
cultural, behavioral and socioeconomic factors, however,
data availability and under-ascertainment might also
contribute to these differences. Adding up all the re-
gional reports, it was estimated that more than 45,800
people commit suicide every year in this region [23].
Data about suicide is still scarce in Latin America, es-
pecially in smaller countries like Ecuador. In the last
20 years just very few reports have partially described
this phenomenon in the country [24–26].
The Observatory for Citizen Security in Quito carried
out a study on the subject and determined that in 2014
in Ecuador there were 9 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants
with similar results in 2015 [27]. The most recent scientific
reports on Ecuadorian suicide epidemiology comes from
2011, with two descriptive analyses that offer an interest-
ing demographic analysis of the problem, however, none
of those reports included a detailed geodemographic and
economic analysis of suicide, years of life lost, disability-
adjusted life years (DALY) or risk analysis [24, 26].
In this sense, this document responds to the lack of
data about the economic and public health impact of
suicide in Ecuador, adding new insights about a problem
that has been poorly described in Latin American coun-
tries will improve the capacity of policy makers to cor-
rectly approach this health problem.
Methods
Study design and population
The present study is an observational cross-sectional
analysis of suicide data and the burden of disease in
Ecuador in the last 15 years of available data, from 2001
to 2015.
Ecuador is situated in South America and according to
national census data, the total population surpassed 16.4
million people in 2015 [28].
A country-wide comparison of the data from the 24
provinces was performed using the complete dataset
from the Ministry of Public Health’s national databases
on overall mortality and hospital discharge data from
2001 to 2015, as well as 2010 population census data
from the National Institute of Census and Statistics
(INEC). The study variables analyzed were age, geo-
graphical distribution at the provincial level, sex, means
of suicide, educational attainment, marital status, mor-
tality and high altitude exposure.
Data sources and description
All cases of suicide were classified according to the
International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision
(ICD-10). ICD-10 codes reflecting intentional self-harm
(X60-X84) were identified through autopsy reports pro-
vided by INEC. Data on demographic variables such as
sex, province elevation, educational attainment and
marital status for all cases of suicide were included.
The burden of disease attributable to deaths by suicide
in Ecuador was measured in disability-adjusted life years,
or DALYs. [29]. DALYs are the sum of years lived with
disability (YLDs) and years of life lost due to premature
mortality (YLLs). In the case of suicide, only YLLs were
considered for the calculations. YLLs were computed as
the number of deaths multiplied by life expectancy at
the age of death for specific age and sex strata consider-
ing a life expectancy at birth of 80 years for men and
82.5 years for women. A standard time discounting of
3% without age weighting was used. All calculations
were made in the “DALY” package for R [30].

 Data analysis
The demographic variables, suicide method (X60-X84),
place and date of suicide as well as the DALY data was
analyzed using descriptive statistics. Data are presented
as mortality rates, absolute values and proportions. The
mortality rate was adjusted by age, sex and geographic
location. Linear Regression and relative Risk analysis
were used to predict outcome and the likelihood that
suicide occur among variables. The calculations were
completed using the IBM SPSS statistics version 24.0.
References, citation and retrieval were managed by
Zotero Open Source Software version 4.0.11. Spatial ana-
lysis was performed using QGIS 2.8 and the graphics were
designed using the Piktochart infographic online app.
Ethical considerations
According to the international guidelines of good clinical
practices (GCP) and the Helsinki Declaration, anonymous
databases can be used when no harm or confidentiality
can be guaranteed [31]. According to the national guide-
lines we have complied and met the criteria described
above and the study approval was exempted by the
BioEthics Committee for Human Research at Univer-
sidad de las Americas (CEISH-UDLA) [32]. The de-
identified non- biological data is freely available to

(INEC).
Results
In Ecuador, over a period of 15 years from 2001 to 2015, a
total of 13,024 deaths were attributed to self-inflected in-
juries. Over this time period, suicide rate fluctuated be-
tween 4.3 to 7.1 per 100.000. The overall national suicide
mortality rate in private and public healthcare systems av-
eraged 7.5 per 100,000 deaths. Men were 3 times more
likely than women to die by suicide. The highest rate of
suicide was recorded in Carchi province (12.7 per
100,000) and the highlands provinces had higher rates
than those located at sea level (9 vs 4.5 per 100.000). For
the first time in history, the rate of suicide in 2015 (7.9 per
100,000) surpassed the homicide rate (6.3 per 100,000).
Age distribution
Suicide in Ecuador affects all age groups, but adolescents
and young adults are the most likely group to commit
suicide (Fig. 1). During the 15 years of analysis, 262 chil-
dren younger than 12 years old committed suicide;
Azuay province had the highest cumulative percentage
reported for this group (4%).
Among adolescents, suicide ranked first among all the
causes of death in women aged 13 to 20 years old and
4th in men in the same age group, accounting for more
than 17% and 10% of mortality, respectively (Table 1.).
The proportion of suicide by age groups in relation-
ship with all other causes of death from 2001 to 2015
was 2.9% in children (6–12 years), 12.0% in adolescents
(13–20 years), 5.8% among young adults (21–39 years)
1.5% in adults (40–65 years) and 0.2% among the elderly
(>65 years old).
Sex differences
In Ecuador, men account for a majority of suicides,
71.5%. The overall sex-specific rates in Ecuador is 5.3 for
women and 13.2 for men (Fig. 2) and the men to women
ratio is 3:1. The proportion of suicide in comparison
with all other causes of death is 1.9 in men and 1.0 in
women.
Means of self-inflicted injury
The means used by persons who committed suicide in
Ecuador differs according to sex and location of the vic-
tim. The principal means of self-inflected injury reported
in the last 15 years is the X70: Intentional self-harm by
hanging, strangulation and suffocation (ICD-10 X70),
followed by Intentional self-poisoning by exposure to
pesticides (ICD 10 X68) and then firearms (ICD 10
X72–74). (Fig. 3).
Women are more likely to use less violent means, such
as poisoning and drug abuse, while men are more likely
to use hanging, firearms or intentional self-harm with
sharp objects (Fig. 4).
Self-inflicted deaths by firearms accounted for almost
15% of the of means of suicide s in 2001 and 5% in
2015. Hanging increased from 33% in 2001 to 69.3% in
2015 and pesticide self-poisoning decreased from 43% to
20% in the same time period (Fig. 5).
Geographical differences
The provinces with the highest suicide rate per 100.000
in Ecuador are Carchi (12.7/100,000), Napo (11.6/
100,000), Cañar (11.3/100,000) and Azuay (11.0/100,000)
(Fig. 6).
The lowest recorded suicide rate was reported in the
coastal province of Santa Elena with 1.4 per 100.000. The
highlands region of the country had the highest suicide
rate (9 per 100,000), followed by the Amazonian region
(8.1 per 100,000), the insular region of Galapagos (5.6 per
100,000) and finally the coastal region (4.5 per 100,000).
When the average elevation was analyzed, higher alti-
tude locations (>2500 m) had a rate of 9.4 per 100,000
while lower altitude locations (<2500 m) had a rate of
6.3 per 100,000) (Table 2). We performed a logistic re-
gression and a relative risk analysis for elevation (in me-
ters) and suicide. The results show that living at high
altitude has a very low chance to predict the occurrence
Ortiz-Prado et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:342 
Page 3 of 11
 of suicide (R2 = 0.0232, p = 0.477), however the relative
risk (RR) analysis showed a slightly high increment in
the risk of committing suicide when living above 2500 m
(RR = 1.545, 95% CI: 1.4890 to 1.6055, p < 0.0001).
DALYs and YLLs analysis
During the period 2001–2015 in Ecuador there were
13,024 deaths registered as self-inflected injuries causing
death. These deaths are equivalent to 135,731 years of
life lost due to premature mortality. 93% of YLLs are at-
tributable to deaths in the economically active popula-
tion. 73.6% of the burden generated by premature
mortality occurred in men (Table 3).
Sociodemographic characteristics
In Ecuador, the majority of people committing suicide
are single, followed by married and common law cou-
ples. Educational attainment was found to be another
important factor related with suicide in Ecuador. In the
last 15 years, people who did not finish primary or high
school had the highest suicide rates among Ecuadorians.
Urban communities have almost triple the suicide rates
of rural communities. The overall suicide rate by race
shows that mestizos or mixed race has the highest rate
(9/100.000), followed by indigenous (7/100.000) and all
the other ethnic groups (2/100.000). Suicide rates tend
to be higher during January, March and October as de-
scribed in Table 4.
Discussion
The results from this investigation demonstrate that sui-
cide is one of the most important health issues in
Ecuador. Adequate public policy needs to be pursued in
order to generate effective public health prevention pro-
grams. The results in Ecuador accompany and support
the WHO global epidemics [10, 33]. Nearly 13,500
deaths were attributed and officially reported as suicide
in the last 15 years in Ecuador, averaging almost 890

 deaths per year, with an average suicide rate of 7.1
per 100,000. In Ecuador, men are three times as likely
to commit suicide than women; this relationship of
3:1 seems to be within the range described worldwide
[10, 22, 34].
Suicide rates vary from region to region, affecting
provinces located in the Andean region of Ecuador more
than those located at lower altitudes. It is not well
understood why this relationship is present in Ecuador,
however, other reports have also suggested the positive
relationship between altitude and suicide rates [19, 35].
The differences between highland and lowland com-
munities have been well documented and include cul-
tural, physical or socioeconomic variances [27, 36].
Although there is not much research on this subject it is
speculated that altitude can increase psychiatric disor-
ders, mood changes, risk of depression and risk to de-
velop
stroke
[37–40].
Greater
access
to
firearms,
isolation or reduced income have also been implicated
as possible causes [35]. In Ecuador, high altitude prov-
inces have more presence of indigenous groups than
those provinces located at the coast. According to the
latest National Census, this vulnerable population has
less access to proper housing, education and health care
[41]. The World Report on Violence and Health in 2002
found that suicide rates have increased among indigen-
ous people [42]. Among the proposed risk factors, cul-
tural differences, discrimination, poor adaptation to
urban lifestyles, poverty and limited health access were
identified [42, 43]. In this sense, Carchi and Azuay, two
of the provinces with the highest suicide rates experi-
enced a massive emigration from their young adults to
the US and Europe in the year 2000 [44]. Immigration
patterns are variables that increase the risk of suicide due
to the apparition of broken families and children that were
raised alone, make this group particularly vulnerable to
depression, drug abuse and probably higher risk of suicide
[45–47]. On the other hand our results might indicate that
living at high altitude could be considered a non-
traditional risk factor, although the effect of hypoxia on
suicidal thoughts or behavior has not been demonstrated
yet, a slightly higher relative risk of committing suicide
was demonstrated among high altitude dwellers when
compared to those located at lower altitudes [19, 35].
Among Andean countries, Ecuador has the second
highest suicide rate, ahead of Colombia (6.1/100.000)
and
Peru
(5.8/100.000)
and
behind
Bolivia
(18.7/
100.000) [6, 22]. The reasons of this situation are not
well understood; multifactorial risk factors might con-
tribute to these differences among similar countries, and
there may also be methodological differences in data col-
lection and registering death causes.
It is not clear why some countries within the same re-
gion have significantly different suicide rates [6]. The
World
Health
Organization
reports
that
from
the
800,000 people committing suicide each year, 50% are
from China and India, and the highest rates reported
were from Guyana, Lithuania, Hungary and South Korea
[21, 33, 48]. Other countries including Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Jordan, Nepal and Jamaica reported some of the
lowest rates worldwide [49, 50].

 The data from rural and urban areas showed different
characteristics regarding the means of the suicidal act
[51]. The incidence of suicide between rural and urban
areas varies around the world due to their cultural, so-
cioeconomic and geographical particularities [52]. In
Ecuador, most of the reports come from the cities, more
than doubling the cases from rural communities. Social
stress factors such as high unemployment rates, social
isolation, divorce, drug abuse, excessive working and
negative chronobiological or physical working conditions
have been identified as risk factors in the urban area
[53–56]. Emotional conflicts occur in both rural and
urban areas, but due to cultural and economic features,
divorce as a reason for suicide is less frequent among
the rural communities [57]. It has also been hypothe-
sized that longer night shifts and busier lifestyles in
urban areas can increase the risk of suicide [58]. There
has been very little research on the effect of urbanization
on the incidence of suicide. It has been identified that
women perform more suicidal acts in urban areas than
men, which may be due to job-related factors (quality,
opportunity for promotions, etc.) and also vulnerability
living in large cities [59].
It is not yet clear why men commit suicide more than
women, despite knowledge that suicidal thoughts are
more common in women than men, this proportion is
observed across cultures. Certain factors have been iden-
tified that influence the suicide rate in men [60, 61]. For
instance, the gender gap and the social pressure that is
exerted on men because the image is generally linked to
family support, which can cause economic failure to
have a stronger negative impact on men. In Ecuadorian
culture, men are commonly perceived or expected to be
the primary head of household or even the family’s

 unique livelihood. They are expected to earn more than
women counterparts so often times economic failure
and feelings of inability to support one’s family can cre-
ate an insurmountable pressure [62].
According to available literature, the means by which a
man takes his own life appear to be more violent than
those means utilized by women [17, 63]. In Ecuador,
men use more violent methods than women, including
death by firearms, hanging and sharp objects (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, the landscape of means of suicide in
Ecuador have changed in the last 15 years. Firearms used
to account for 15% of the total causes of suicide in 2001,
however in 2015, this number dropped to 5% (Fig. 5).
This important reduction might be a consequence of
better gun control and stronger national safety policy in
Ecuador in the last 10 years [64]. For the first time ever
in 2015 homicide rate dropped below the suicide rate,
This trend might also be related with an important re-
duction in crime reported in Ecuador in the last years
since suicide did not changed dramatically in the last
15 years. [65, 66].
An alarming discovery
is that among adolescent
women, suicide is the main cause of death, including all
violent and non-violent causes. In the last years suicide
has become a major public health problem among ado-
lescents, specially in developed countries like the US
[67].
Data
from
other
countries
shows
that
men
adolescents are 2.6 times more likely to commit suicide
than adolescent women [68]. In Ecuador, the proportion
of suicide among adolescents account for more than
12% of the total causes of deaths, being this number
higher in women (17%) than in men (10%). Similar re-
ports have been published in other countries, showing
that proportions are useful tools when estimating the
impact of suicide among all other causes of the unnat-
ural Death [69].
Suicide is usually preventable, especially in health sys-
tems where mental health services are readily available
[70]. These preventable deaths need to be addressed to
public health policy makers in order to plan and imple-
ment suicide prevention programs with a special focus
on high-risk groups such as young adolescents women
and single young men. Despite the fact that from 2001
to 2015 suicide rates in Ecuador were fairly stable, the
health system and economic impacts are highly concern-
ing due to premature mortality. Ecuador reported 4421
deaths registered as suicide, and the total years of
healthy life lost exceeded 135,731 years. Using the hu-
man capital method, in 2001–2015 period, the total eco-
nomic loss due to suicide was estimated to be $852.6
million international dollars (year 2010 base), almost 1%
of the Ecuadorian gross domestic product (GDP) for
2015 [65].
Limitations
The main limitation of our study is that data from sui-
cide attempts was not available. In addition, the lack of
data to assess confounding factors in order to better
understand some of the observed associations and the
possible causes of suicide is inexistent.
Conclusions
This geodemographic study is the first of its kind in ex-
ploring the complete burden of suicide in Ecuador and
its economic impact over the local health and productive
system. In the last 15 years of available data, nearly
13,500 deaths were officially registered as suicide, put-
ting the country above the regional average with a sui-
cide rate of 7.1 per 100,000. Suicide largely is taking the
life of younger people; especially adolescent women sig-
nifies that gender inequality may be a contributing fac-
tor. Some of the possible causes of higher suicide rate
among younger people can be explained by chronic
stressors such as family dysfunction, school failure, sex-
ual abuse, alcohol, drug use and immigration patterns.
Despite the fact that some of the means of suicide has
changed over time, the annual rate of suicide has not
varied significantly in the last 15 years. In fact, while
other means like firearms and pesticide consumption de-
creased in the last few years, hangings have increased
over time.

 Suicide seems to be more prevalent in high altitude
provinces when compared to provinces at lower alti-
tudes, however, this relationship does not demonstrate
causality and further research is needed. Although this
data is important, the analysis of risk factors and behav-
ioral problems need to be addressed at a deeper level fu-
ture studies.
The results of this study will provide an insight into
the needs of authorities with regard to prevention pro-
grams and contributed to our understanding of suicide
in Andean countries where information is scarce. Fur-
thermore, it contributes to create the baseline data in
order to publish guidelines for those involved in the
medical practice of suicide specially those who are in
charge of adolescents’ school-based education programs
and gender inequality policies.
