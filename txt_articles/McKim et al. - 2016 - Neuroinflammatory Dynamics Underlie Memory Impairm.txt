Repeated social defeat (RSD) is a murine stressor that recapitulates key physiological, immunological, and behavioral alterations ob-
served in humans exposed to chronic psychosocial stress. Psychosocial stress promotes prolonged behavioral adaptations that are
associated with neuroinflammatory signaling and impaired neuroplasticity. Here, we show that RSD promoted hippocampal neuroin-
flammatoryactivationthatwascharacterizedbyproinflammatorygeneexpressionandbymicrogliaactivationandmonocytetrafficking
that was particularly pronounced within the caudal extent of the hippocampus. Because the hippocampus is a key area involved in
neuroplasticity,behavior,andcognition,wehypothesizethatstress-inducedneuroinflammationimpairshippocampalneurogenesisand
promotes cognitive and affective behavioral deficits. We show here that RSD caused transient impairments in spatial memory recall that
resolvedwithin28d.Inassessmentofneurogenesis,thenumberofproliferatingneuralprogenitorcells(NPCs)andthenumberofyoung,
developing neurons were not affected initially after RSD. Nonetheless, the neuronal differentiation of NPCs that proliferated during RSD
was significantly impaired when examined 10 and 28 d later. In addition, social avoidance, a measure of depressive-like behavior
associated with caudal hippocampal circuitry, persisted 28 d after RSD. Treatment with minocycline during RSD prevented both micro-
glia activation and monocyte recruitment. Inhibition of this neuroinflammatory activation in turn prevented impairments in spatial
memory after RSD but did not prevent deficits in neurogenesis nor did it prevent the persistence of social avoidance behavior. These
findings show that neuroinflammatory activation after psychosocial stress impairs spatial memory performance independent of deficits
in neurogenesis and social avoidance.

Introduction
Chronic psychological stress is a strong risk factor in the etiology
of numerous mental health complications (McEwen, 2012), in-
cluding mood disorders and cognitive impairments. Recent work
reveals that chronic stress triggers immune dysfunction that is
causally implicated in mental health disturbances (Glaser and
Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Wohleb et al., 2014b; Reader et al., 2015).
Individuals exposed to chronic stress show persistent cognitive

Significance Statement
Repeated exposure to stress alters the homeostatic environment of the brain, giving rise to various cognitive and mood disorders
that impair everyday functioning and overall quality of life. The brain, previously thought of as an immune-privileged organ, is
nowknowntocommunicateextensivelywiththeperipheralimmunesystem.Thisbrain–bodycommunicationplaysasignificant
role in various stress-induced inflammatory conditions, also characterized by psychological impairments. Findings from this
study implicate neuroimmune activation rather than impaired neurogenesis in stress-induced cognitive deficits. This idea opens
up possibilities for novel immune interventions in the treatment of cognitive and mood disturbances, while also adding to the
complexity surrounding the functional implications of adult neurogenesis.

 and emotional dysregulation that contribute to deterioration of
overall mental health and quality of life (Baum et al., 1993;
McEwen, 2013). For instance, studies with caregivers (Caswell et
al., 2003; Mackenzie et al., 2007) and college-age students
(Keinan et al., 1999) demonstrate that chronic stress is associated
strongly with cognitive impairments and accelerated cognitive
decline (Vitaliano et al., 2011). Additional studies also report
associations between stress-induced neuroinflammatory activa-
tion and psychological disturbances. For instance, elevated pro-
inflammatory cytokines (Janelidze et al., 2011), increased
microglia activation (Schnieder et al., 2014), and increased brain
macrophages (Torres-Platas et al., 2014) were all detected within
specific brain regions of depressed suicide victims. Thus, stress-
induced neuropsychiatric disturbances may involve impaired
neuroplasticity caused by microglia activation, monocyte re-
cruitment, and enhanced neuroinflammatory signaling.
These connections between neuroimmune activation and
psychological complications are also paralleled in rodent models
of stress, such as repeated social defeat (RSD). In these models,
sympathetic activation promotes the production of proinflam-
matory monocytes (Wohleb et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013; Heidt
et al., 2014) that traffic to the brain (Wohleb et al., 2011) and
promote the development of prolonged and recurring anxiety
(Wohleb et al., 2013, 2014a, McKim et al., 2015). In addition,
chronic stressors activate microglia within specific stress-
responsive brain regions (Tynan et al., 2010; Wohleb et al., 2011)
that are spatially coupled to neurovascular facilitation of mono-
cyte recruitment (Sawicki et al., 2015). These experimental find-
ings reveal a profound, bidirectional interplay between stress
circuitry and neuroimmune signaling that controls behavioral
responses to chronic stress. Treatments, such as �-adrenergic
receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants, that
modify neuronal adaptation prevent many of the neuroimmune
and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress, including anxi-
ety and social avoidance (Wohleb et al., 2011; Ramirez et al.,
2015, 2016). Furthermore, treatments that interfere at the neuro-
immune interface also prevent stress-induced behavioral adapta-
tions, including prolonged and recurring anxiety (Wohleb et al.,
2014a,c, McKim et al., 2015) and depressive-like behaviors (Kre-
isel et al., 2014). Thus, stress-induced neuroinflammatory re-
sponses serve as an important link between immune dysfunction
and development of mood disorders.
In the RSD model, neuroinflammatory activation was localized
primarily within the limbic system including the hippocampus
(Wohleb et al., 2013). This is relevant because the hippocampus is
a key area involved in neuroplasticity, behavior, and cognition
(McEwen, 1999). Indeed, increased neuroinflammatory signaling
augments neurobiological processes implicated in behavioral disor-
ders involving neurogenesis (Koo and Duman, 2008) and metabo-
lismofneurotransmitters(Milleretal.,2009;O’Connoretal.,2009).
Corresponding with these findings, neuroinflammatory activation
in the hippocampus may impair neuroplasticity and behavior after
psychosocial stress.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether
stress-induced neuroinflammation (e.g., microglial activation, cyto-
kine induction, and monocyte recruitment) affected hippocampal
neurogenesis, cognition, and mood. Here, we show that RSD en-
hances neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, causes transient
deficits in memory recall, alters neuronal cell fate, and prolongs so-
cialavoidance.Moreover,hippocampal-dependentmemorydeficits
werecausedbyneuroinflammatoryactivation,whereassocialavoid-
ance and impaired neurogenesis were not. Collectively, these studies

pendent of stress-induced neuroinflammation.
Materials and Methods
Mice. Male C57BL/6 (6–8 weeks old) and male CD-1 retired breeder mice
were purchased from Charles River and allowed to acclimate to their sur-
roundingsfor7–10dbeforeexperiments.Micewerehousedin11.5�7.5�
6-inch polypropylene cages. Rooms were maintained at 21°C under a 12 h
light/dark cycle from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. with ad libitum access to water
and rodent chow. All experiments took place between 8:00 A.M. and 11:00
A.M., unless noted otherwise. All procedures were in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Lab-
oratory Animal Care and Use Committee.
RSD. RSD was performed as described previously (Wohleb et al., 2013).
In brief, an aggressive male intruder CD-1 mouse was introduced into cages
ofestablishedmalecohorts(threepercage)ofC57BL/6micefor2hbetween
5:00P.M.and7:00P.M.for6consecutivenights.Duringeachcycle,submis-
sive behavior, including upright posture, fleeing, and crouching, were ob-
servedtoensuredefeatoftheresidentmice.Iftheintruderdidnotinitiatean
attack within 5–10 min or was attacked by any of the resident mice, a new
intruder was introduced. At the end of the 2 h period, the intruder was
removed, and the residents were left undisturbed until the following day
when the protocol was repeated. Different intruders were used on consecu-
tive nights. The health status of the mice was carefully examined throughout
theexperiment.Micethatwereinjuredormoribundwereremovedfromthe
study.ConsistentwithpreviousstudiesusingRSD(Engleretal.,2004),�5%
of mice met the early removal criteria. Control (CON) mice were left undis-
turbed in their home cages.
Minocycline treatment. Minocycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered
in vivarium drinking water. Solutions were prepared fresh daily and admin-
isteredinopaquesipperbottles.Miceandwaterbottleswereweigheddailyto
adjust dosage to 90 mg/kg. Oral minocycline treatment was started 1 day
before the beginning of RSD and was terminated on the last day of RSD.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR. RNAwasisolatedfromthehippocam-
pus using the Tri-reagent/isopropanol precipitation protocol. RNA concen-
tration was determined by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf). RT was
performedusingaHigh-CapacitycDNAReverseTranscriptionKit(Applied
Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems
Taqman Gene Expression Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression protocol. In
brief, target cDNA [IL-1�, TNF�, IL-6, arginase-1, brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve
growth factor (NGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] and refer-
ence cDNA [glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] were
amplified simultaneously using a primer/probe set for each gene of interest
(Life Technologies). Fluorescence was determined on an ABI PRISM 7300-
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using
the comparative threshold cycle method, and results were expressed as fold
difference from GAPDH.
Immunohistochemistry and digital imaging analysis for Iba-1 and CD45.
BrainsampleswerecollectedaftertranscardialperfusionwithsterilePBS,pH
7.4, followed by 4% formaldehyde. Brains were postfixed in 4% formalde-
hyde for 24 h and then in 30% sucrose for another 48 h. Fixed brains were
frozen with isopentane (�78°C) and sectioned (30 �m) using a Microm
HM550 cryostat. Brain regions within the hippocampus were identified by
reference markers in accordance with the stereotaxic mouse brain atlas
(Paxinos and Franklin, 2008). To label for Iba-1 or CD45, sections were
placed free-floating in cryoprotectant until staining. Next, sections were
washedinPBSandthenblocked(5%normalgoatserum,1%BSA,and0.5%
Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Iba-1 (1:1000;
WakoChemicals)orratanti-mouseCD45(1:500;Abcam)overnightat4°C.
Then sections were washed in PBS and incubated with a fluorochrome-
conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594). Sec-
tions were mounted on slides, coverslipped with Fluoromount G (Beckman
Coulter), and stored at �20°C. For each mouse, five to six representative
images were taken at 20� magnification from the dentate gyrus (DG) of the
hippocampus.FluorescentimagesweretakenwithaZeiss510Metaconfocal
microscope and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. For CD45, cells with
positive labeling were counted in each hippocampal section. Iba-1 labeling

Spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Spatial memory (Morris, 1984)
was determined using a modified version of the classic Morris water maze
(MWM;Morris,1981).Theapparatusconsistedofawhite180-cm-diameter
tub filled with a mixture of water and white paint (at room temperature). A
clear plastic platform (12 cm diameter) was concealed 1 cm beneath the
surfaceofthewaterandwasplacedinaposition20cmawayfromtheedgeof
the tub. The area surrounding the apparatus consisted of two distinct extra-
maze geometric cues and additional spatial cues inherent to the room. The
experimenter and recording equipment were concealed behind a curtain
during testing. The spatial memory assay involved a 5 d acquisition phase
after RSD and a probe trial on day 6. Acquisition consisted of four trials per
day, with the platform in the same position throughout the task. A 30 min
intertrialintervalwasusedthroughouttheacquisitionphase.Maximumtrial
duration was 60 s. If the platform was not reached within 60 s, then the
mouse was placed on the platform and a latency of 60 s was recorded. Mice
were placed at one of four positions in a quasi-random balanced order.
Latency and total distance to reach the platform and percentage time in the
outer annulus of the tub were recorded. During the probe trial on day 6, the
platform was removed, and total distance traveled and percentage time in
each quadrant were recorded for 60 s. Behavior was recorded and analyzed
using the Noldus EthoVision XT 8.0 Software.
Working memory in the MWM. Working memory was determined in
an adaptation of the MWM as was described previously (Sparkman et al.,
2006). All conditions were the same as described above unless noted
otherwise. There were three massed trials per day with an intertrial inter-
val of 30 s and maximum trial duration of 120 s. Each trial lasted until the
platform was reached or until the maximum trial duration elapsed. If
the platform was not reached within 120 s, then the mouse was placed on
the platform and a score of 120 s was recorded. In a pseudorandom and
experimentally balanced manner, mice were placed in one of four quad-
rants �3 cm from the edge of the tub. The location of the platform was
changed every day but remained in the same place during trials on the
same day. Average velocity, latency to platform, distance to platform, and
duration spent in the outer annulus were recorded and analyzed using
the Noldus EthoVision XT 8.0 Software.
Spatial memory in the Barnes maze. Hippocampal-dependent learning
and memory recall were determined using a previously described Barnes
maze paradigm with some modifications (Bach et al., 1995). The accli-
mation phase consisted of two trials: (1) mice were guided to the escape
hole and allowed 2 min in the escape box; and (2), mice were guided to an
incorrect or “dummy” hole and then guided to the escape hole and
allowed 2 min in the escape hole. Trials were initiated 30 min apart for
each mouse. After the acclimation day, the position of the escape box was
shifted to its permanent location for the remainder of the paradigm for
mice to learn overt stationary spatial cues to find the escape box. The
acquisition phase consisted of four trials per day for 4 consecutive days.
Mice were placed in the center of the maze under a semi-opaque con-
tainer for 15 s. The trial recording began with the removal of the con-
tainer. Each trial lasted 120 s or until the mouse entered the escape hole.
If the mouse did not reach the escape hole in the allotted time, then it was
guided to the hole. Speed, distance traveled, time to locate the escape
hole, and the number of errors were determined. To evaluate immediate
memory recall, mice were reexposed to the Barnes maze trial 24 and 48 h
after RSD. For long-term memory recall, reexposure was performed on
days 28 and 29 after RSD. Reexposure consisted of one 60 s trial during
which the speed, distance, time to locate the escape hole, and the number
of errors were determined. Mice in the acquisition phase and recall trial
were tracked, recorded, and analyzed using the Noldus EthoVision XT
8.0 Software.
5�Bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin labeling. The proliferation of
cells in the DG was determined using 5�bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) la-
beling. BrdU (10 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in warm PBS and
then filtered. On the last 3 nights of RSD (i.e., cycles 4, 5, and 6), mice
were injected with 50 mg/kg BrdU at 4:00 P.M. (1 h before social defeat).
Brains were collected for BrdU immunohistochemistry 14 h (0.5 d), 10 d,
or 28 d after the last injection of BrdU. For quantification of BrdU-
positive (BrdU �) and doublecortin-positive (DCX �) cells, every sixth
section throughout the hippocampus was collected. For BrdU labeling,
sections were washed, denatured in 2N HCl at 37°C for 30 min, and
blocked (1% BSA/PBS, 5% NGS, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Sections were
then incubated in primary antibody (mAb, 1:1000, rat anti-BrdU; AbD
Serotec) at 4°C for 24 h and then secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488) at
room temperature for 1 h. For DCX labeling, sections were washed,
blocked (1% BSA/PBS, 5% donkey serum, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for
1 h and then incubated in primary antibody (mAb, 1:200, goat anti-DCX;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C for 48 h, followed by secondary anti-
body (Alexa Fluor 594) at 4°C overnight. Sections were mounted on
slides, coverslipped with Fluoromount G (Beckman Coulter), and stored
at �20°C. Fluorescent images were visualized using a Zeiss 510 Meta
confocal microscope, captured, and then analyzed using MetaMorph
software. The total number of BrdU � cells and DCX � cells in the DG
were extrapolated for the entire volume of the hippocampus. A previous
study was used as a reference for morphological comparison of immature
and mature DCX � neurons (Zhao et al., 2006).
Fate mapping of BrdU� cells. For phenotypic analysis of BrdU � cells at
10 and 28 d after injection, double labeling was performed with rat anti-
BrdU (mAb, 1:1000; AbD Serotec), goat anti-DCX (1:500; Abcam), and
rabbit anti-NeuN (1:1000; Abcam) or rabbit anti-GFAP (rabbit, 1:1000;
Dako). Sections were collected at 10 and 28 d after injection of BrdU.
Fluorescent samples were visualized using an epifluorescent Leica
DM5000B microscope. Images were captured on the Leica DFC300 FX
camera and then analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. The total number
of cells with positive labeling in the hippocampus was counted and rep-
resented per brain section.
Social interaction. Social avoidance was determined as described pre-
viously (Berton et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2007; Wohleb et al., 2014a).
In Trial 1 (empty), an experimental mouse was placed into the arena with
an empty wire mesh cage, and activity was recorded for 2.5 min. In Trial
2 (social), an unfamiliar CD-1 mouse was placed in the wire mesh cage,
the experimental mouse was placed in the arena, and activity was re-
corded for 2.5 min. Activity in the social avoidance behavior test was
video recorded and analyzed using Noldus EthoVision XT Software.
Statistical analyses. Observations 2 SDs above and below the mean
were counted as outliers and were excluded in the subsequent analyses.
To determine significant main effects and interactions between main
factors, data were analyzed using one-way, two-way, or repeated-
measures ANOVA using the general linear model procedures of SPSS
statistical software (IBM). Specifically, Barnes maze and MWM data were
averaged across trials on the same day. Data with repeated trials were
tested for sphericity using Mauchly’s test and were then analyzed with
repeated-measures ANOVA to determine the effect of day, trial, or ex-
perimental condition. In the event of a main effect of experimental
treatment, differences between group means were evaluated by an
F-protected t test. Post hoc analyses are presented graphically in the fig-
ures. All data are expressed as treatment means � SEMs.
Results
Increased inflammation and presence of CD45 � myeloid cells
in the hippocampus after RSD
It has been reported previously that RSD activated microglia and
promoted monocyte trafficking to the brain (Wohleb et al., 2013).
Moreover, these events contributed to an enhanced inflammatory
profile, activated IL-1 signaling in the brain, and affected the devel-
opment of prolonged anxiety-like behavior. Stress-induced mono-
cyte trafficking and inflammatory signaling was localized within the
limbicsystem(includingthehippocampus).Thisisrelevantbecause
the hippocampus is critical in neuroplasticity, behavior, and cogni-
tion (McEwen, 1999). Therefore, the objective of this study was to
determine the effects of RSD on hippocampal-dependent memory
and neuronal plasticity.

McKim, Niraula et al. • Stress-Induced Neuroinflammation Impairs Memory
 In the first experiment, mice were exposed to six cycles of social
defeat, and mRNA expression of several inflammatory mediators
and growth factors were determined in the hippocampus immedi-
ately after the last cycle. Fig. 1A shows that RSD increased mRNA
expression of IL-1� (p � 0.0001), IL-6 (p � 0.05), and TNF� (p �
0.05) in the hippocampus immediately after RSD. These data are
consistent with our previous findings (Wohleb et al., 2013). In addi-
tion, mRNA expression of NGF (p � 0.05) and VEGF (p � 0.01)
were also increased in the hippocampus immediately after
RSD. The expression of genes coding for BDNF and IGF-1
were unaffected by RSD.
Next, microglial Iba-1 immunoreactivity and the presence of
CD45� monocytes were assessed in the DG of the hippocampus.
Figure 1B shows representative images of Iba-1 labeling of microglia
in the DG. RSD promoted changes in microglial morphology
marked by larger soma size and shorter, thicker processes. These
morphological changes, associated with an inflammatory profile,
resulted in an overall increase in Iba-1 proportional area across the
caudal and rostral DG (F(1,19) � 11.66, p � 0.05; Fig. 1C) that was
significantly augmented in the caudal hippocampus compared with
the rostral hippocampus after RSD (p � 0.05). Figure 1D shows

RSDmice.TherewasasignificantincreaseinthenumberofCD45�

pocampus (p � 0.05) of the RSD mice.
Overall, these data indicated that RSD ele-
vated proinflammatory cytokine levels in
the whole hippocampus and increased mi-
croglial Iba-1 immunoreactivity and num-
ber of CD45� monocytes that was more
pronounced in the caudal hippocampus.
Impaired performance on the working
memory version of the MWM was
related to thigmotaxis
Prolonged exposure to inflammatory cyto-
kines may negatively affect hippocampal-
dependent spatial memory (Sparkman et
al., 2006; Hein et al., 2010). To test this idea
in RSD, mice were exposed to six cycles of
social defeat, and working memory was as-
sessedfor5dusinganadaptedversionofthe
MWM (Fig. 2A). In this design, mice were
trained to locate the hidden platform that
changedlocationoneachdayoftesting(Fig.
2B). Figure 2C shows the representative
search patterns of CON and RSD mice on
day 3 of testing in the MWM. RSD did not
affect swim velocity during the 5 d of testing
(F(1,22) � 0.71, p � 0.794; Fig. 2D). A
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that
RSD did not significantly affect performa-
nce across all 5 d on either latency (F(1,22) �
1.02, p � 0.331; Fig. 2E) or distance
(F(1,22) � 1.00, p � 0.335; Fig. 2F). How-
ever, there was a significant main effect of
stress when analyzed across the first 3 d on
both latency (F(1,22) � 5.82, p � 0.05) and
distance (F(1,22) � 5.21, p � 0.05). Post hoc
analysis indicated that RSD tended to in-
creaselatencyanddistancetoreachtheplat-
form on each of the first 3 testing (D7–D9)
days (p � 0.1 for each; Fig. 2E,F). By days 4
and 5 of testing (D10–D11), latency and
distance traveled were no longer affected by
RSD. In addition, there was significant in-
crease in performance across days on both
latency (F(4,19) � 23.66, p � 0.001) and dis-
tance (F(4,19) � 16.87, p � 0.001) to reach
the platform independent of stress condi-
tion. This temporal pattern is indicative of
learning. It is important to note that there
was a main effect of RSD on time spent in
theouterannulusofthemaze(F(1,22) �9.25,p�0.01;Fig.2G).Post
hoc analysis confirmed that RSD mice spent more time in the outer
annulus on D7–D9 compared with CON mice (p � 0.05 for all 3 d).
Thissearchstrategyresemblesananxiety-likethigmotacticbehavior,
and it was readily apparent in the representative search paths in
Figure 2C. This altered anxiety-like search strategy may explain the
increased time and distance to reach the escape platform observed
after RSD. Consistent with this, there was a significant correlation
between the average percentage time in the outer annulus and aver-
age latency (r � 0.632, p � 0.001) and average distance (r � 0.638,
p � 0.001) across the first 3 testing days. Moreover, thigmotaxis is a
significant covariate between stress and latency (F(1,22) � 6.75, p �

onlatency(F(1,22)�7.22,p�0.405)anddistance(F(1,22)�6.46,p�

transient impairment in performance on this working memory ver-
sion of the MWM that was likely attributable to an anxiety-like or
thigmotactic search strategy.
RSD impaired spatial memory recall but not acquisition in
the MWM
To further assess cognitive functioning, learning and spatial
memory recall were examined using another variation of the
MWM (Fig. 3A). In this experiment, mice were trained on
the MWM to acquire the location of the hidden platform on the
first 5 d (acquisition phase, D7–D11) after the six cycles of RSD

McKim, Niraula et al. • Stress-Induced Neuroinflammation Impairs Memory
 (Fig. 3B). Then, memory recall was probed by removing the hid-
den platform on day 6 after RSD (D12). During the 5 d of acqui-
sition, performance was not significantly affected by stress on
either latency (F(1,24) � 1.264, p � 0.273; Fig. 3C) or distance
(F(1,24) � 0.156, p � 0.697; Fig. 3D) to reach the escape platform.
In addition, regardless of stress treatment, performance on the
MWM significantly improved across acquisition days on latency
to the platform (F(4,21) � 19.12, p � 0.001; Fig. 3C) and distance
traveled (F(4,21) � 24.68, p � 0.001; Fig. 3D). This observation
confirmed that both groups learned the location of the platform
during the acquisition phase. However, during the probe trial,
CON mice outperformed the RSD mice in memory recall. Rep-
resentative paths from the probe trial are shown for CON and
RSD mice in Figure 3E. Mice exposed to RSD spent significantly
less time in the target quadrant compared with CON mice (p �
0.05; Fig. 3F) during the probe trial (D12). Reduced time in the
target quadrant during the probe trial was not attributable to
alterations in total distance traveled (p � 0.811; Fig. 3G). Collec-
tively, these results demonstrate impaired spatial memory recall
in mice exposed to RSD.
Impaired spatial memory recall in the Barnes maze after RSD
was not associated with anxiety, impaired encoding, or
deficient memory consolidation
Because RSD-induced anxiety-like behavior persists for at least
8 d (Wohleb et al., 2014a), it is possible that decreased time spent
in the target quadrant of the MWM was attributable to increased
anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, because mice were trained on
the maze after exposure to RSD, the apparent impairment in
spatial memory may be indicative of deficient encoding rather
than impaired recall. To circumvent the possible anxiety- or
encoding-related deficits, spatial memory recall was assessed in
the Barnes maze. In this design, mice were allowed to learn the
location of the escape hole for 4 d before the beginning of RSD.
Next, mice were exposed to RSD for 6 d, and memory recall was

 tested for 2 d either immediately after RSD (D7 and D8) or 28 d
later (D34 and D35; Fig. 4A).
There were no differences between the groups in escape la-
tency (F(1,17) � 0.005, p � 0.946; Fig. 4B) or number of errors
(F(1,17) � 0.115, p � 0.739; Fig. 4C) during acquisition before
RSD (pre-CON and pre-RSD). In addition, mice exhibited a day-
dependent learning effect on both latency (F(3,15) � 19.72, p �
0.001) and errors (F(3,15) � 9.63, p � 0.001) to find the platform
during the acquisition phase. Memory recall was then assessed for
2 consecutive days after the sixth cycle of social defeat (D7 and
D8). Across both days, RSD mice showed increased latency to
find the escape hole (F(1,17) � 10.82, p � 0.005; Fig. 4B) when
compared with the CON mice (p � 0.05; for each day). RSD also
increased the number of errors (F(1,17) � 5.96, p � 0.05; Fig. 4C)
to reach the escape hole on D7 (p � 0.1) and D8 (p � 0.05).
There were no significant day � stress interactions on either
latency (F(1,17) � 0.885, p � 0.361) or errors (F(1,17) � 0.588, p �
0.454) during the testing phase (D7 and D8). Together, these data
indicate that RSD disrupts short-term memory recall in the
Barnes maze.
Next, a similar paradigm was used to test performance in
the Barnes maze 28 d after RSD. Mice were allowed to acquire
the location of the escape platform for 4 days before RSD.
Again, the CON and RSD mice showed no differences in es-
cape latency (F(1,23) � 0.172, p � 0.683; Fig. 4D) or the num-
ber of errors during the acquisition phase (F(1,23) � 0.172, p �
0.683; Fig. 4E). In addition, mice exhibited a day-dependent
learning effect on both latency (F(3,21) � 42.87, p � 0.001) and
errors (F(3,21) � 18.75, p � 0.001) to find the platform during
the acquisition phase. Twenty-eight days after the completion
of RSD, memory recall was assessed at two time points (D34
and D35). No detectable differences were observed in escape
latency (F(1,23) � 0.589, p � 0.453; Fig. 4D) or the number of
errors (F(1,23) � 0.219, p � 0.645; Fig. 4E) between the CON
and RSD mice. It is important to note that all mice retained a
strong memory of the location of the escape hole even 28 d

 after learning. For instance, performance was improved sig-
nificantly on D34 and D35 compared with D1 on both latency
and distance (p � 0.001 for all). Collectively, these data indi-
cate that RSD caused transient deficits in spatial memory
recall in the Barnes maze that were not associated with anx-
iety-like search strategies, impaired encoding, or deficient
consolidation.
The number of proliferating progenitor cells and young
neurons in the hippocampus was unchanged 0.5 d after RSD
Cognitive impairments after stress have been associated with
inflammation and impaired neurogenesis (Ben Menachem-
Zidon et al., 2008). Therefore, the effects of RSD-induced
inflammation on neurogenesis were examined. To label pro-
liferating neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the DG of the
hippocampus, BrdU was injected on the last 3 days of RSD,
and BrdU � cells in the DG were determined 0.5 d after the
completion of RSD. Figure 5A shows representative images of
BrdU labeling in the DG. The total number of BrdU � cells in
the DG did not differ significantly between RSD and CON
mice 0.5 d after stress (Fig. 5B).
In a related study, the number of cells expressing DCX, an
early neuronal marker, in the DG was also determined. Figure 5C
shows representative images of DCX labeling in the DG of CON
and RSD mice. At 0.5 d after RSD, there was no difference in the
number of DCX � cells between the treatment groups (Fig. 5D).
Next, morphological analysis of the DCX � cells (Zhao et al.,
2006) was used to differentiate cells by maturity (i.e., mature vs
immature DCX � cells). Representative images of a DCX-labeled
mature and immature neuron are shown (Fig. 5E). Again, there
was no significant difference in the number of immature or ma-
ture neurons between RSD and CON at 0.5 d after RSD (Fig. 5F).
These results indicate that the total number of proliferating cells
and the total number of young neurons in the DG were unaf-
fected by RSD at 0.5 d.

 Reduced young neurons in the hippocampus 10 d after RSD
These findings indicated no initial difference in the number of
new BrdU � cells 0.5 d after RSD. Nonetheless, the fate of the
NPCs may differ with time after RSD. Therefore, to assess the
effects of RSD on the phenotypic fate of the hippocampal NPCs,
mice were injected with BrdU on the final 3 days of social defeat,
and the expression of DCX and BrdU was determined in the DG
10 d after the completion of RSD (Fig. 6).

 Figure 6A shows representative double labeling of BrdU and
DCX in the DG 10 d after RSD. The insets highlight a DCX �/
BrdU � cell from a CON (left) and DCX �/BrdU � cell from an
RSD (right) mouse. The proportion of BrdU � cells that colocal-
ized with DCX � was reduced in mice exposed to RSD compared
with CON mice (p � 0.05; Fig. 6B). Similar to the 0.5 d results,
the total number of BrdU � cells was unaffected by RSD (data not
shown). Together, RSD significantly reduced the proportion of
NPCs that upregulated the early neuronal marker DCX at 10 d
after injection.
Impaired differentiation of hippocampal NPCs into mature
neurons 28 d after RSD
Because there was a reduction in the number of BrdU� cells that
co.-localized with the early neuronal marker DCX 10 d after RSD
(Fig. 6B), it was possible that RSD may have reduced the neurogenic
capacityofthehippocampalNPCs.Totestthisidea,miceexposedto
RSD were injected with BrdU during the last three cycles of social
defeat,andthebrainwascollectedandprocessed28dlater.Thistime
point allowed enough time for the BrdU-labeled NPCs to fully ex-
pressmaturephenotypicmarkers(Brownetal.,2003),suchasNeuN
(mature neurons) or GFAP (astrocytes). BrdU� cells from sections
collected 28 d after RSD were labeled for NeuN (Fig. 7C) and GFAP
(Fig.7E).ThetotalnumberofBrdU�cellsatthistimepointwasnot
different between CON and RSD groups (Fig. 7A,B). Nonetheless,
the number of BrdU� cells in the caudal and rostral DG that colo-
calizedwiththematureneuronalmarkerNeuNwasreducedinmice
exposedtoRSD(F(1,18)�96.54,p�0.05;Fig.7C,D).Moreover,this
reduction in NeuN�/BrdU� cells 28 d after RSD was more pro-
nouncedinthecaudalhippocampus(p�0.05).Nodifferenceswere
detected in the number of BrdU� cells that colocalized with GFAP
(Fig. 7E,F). Overall, these findings indicate that the neuronal differ-
entiation of NPCs that proliferated during RSD was impaired.
Social avoidance was maintained 28 d after RSD
Results from the neurogenesis studies here indicate significant re-
duction in the maturation of NPCs in the caudal hippocampus after
RSD. Existing literature on hippocampal anatomy indicates that the
caudalhippocampusisinvolvedinemotionandbehaviorregulation
(FanselowandDong,2010).Furthermore,afferentsfromtheventral
hippocampus have been found to regulate depressive-like behavior,
as marked by increased social avoidance (Bagot et al., 2015). In line
with this finding, previous work from our laboratory and others has
shown that RSD increases social avoidance (Wohleb et al., 2013;
Donahue et al., 2014). Therefore, to examine the long-term role of
RSD-induced impaired neurogenesis on affective functioning
(depressive-like behavior), mice were tested on the social avoidance
task 28 d after RSD (timeline depicted in Fig. 8A). The test consisted
of two trials. Trial 1 consisted of an empty cage (Empty Trial),
whereas Trial 2 consisted of a cage housed by a social conspecific
(Social Trial; Fig. 8B). There was a significant trial � stress interac-
tion effect on both duration in the interaction zone (F(1,27) � 7.39,
p � 0.05; Fig. 8C) and duration in the corner zone (F(1,27) � 9.89,
p � 0.01; Fig. 8D). These trial � stress interactions were character-
ized by significant reduction in social behavior in the RSD
group during the Social Trial. For instance, RSD significantly
reduced interaction duration (p � 0.05; Fig. 8C) and in-
creased corner duration (p � 0.05; Fig. 8D) during the Social
Trial. These results demonstrate RSD-induced social avoid-
ance that persisted at least 28 d after RSD.
Minocycline intervention attenuated RSD-induced microglia
activation and monocyte recruitment
Our results indicate that microglia activation, monocyte recruit-
ment, and neuroinflammatory signaling are temporally associated
withspatialmemoryimpairmentsandco-occurinbrainregionsthat
mediate spatial learning and memory. Thus, minocycline, an anti-
inflammatoryagentandpurportedmicrogliainhibitor(Henryetal.,
2008), was used to determine the role of neuroinflammation in each
of these stress-induced events. First, to assess the effect of minocy-
cline on neuroinflammatory signaling in the DG, microglial Iba-1
expression was determined. In vehicle-treated mice, RSD altered
microgliamorphologythatwascharacterizedbyincreasedsomasize
and thickened cell processes (Fig. 9A). This change in morphology

 was associated with a significant increase in Iba-1 proportional area.
Forinstance,therewasasignificantmaineffectofconditiononIba-1
proportional area (F(2,9) � 6.79, p � 0.05) that was characterized by
asignificantincreaseinvehicle-treatedRSDmice(p�0.05;Fig.9B)
thatwasnotdetectedinminocycline-treatedRSDmice(p�0.765).
Thus, RSD increased Iba-1 proportional area that was blocked by
minocycline.
Because previous work has implicated RSD-induced microglia
activation in the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the
brain (Wohleb et al., 2014b), the effect of minocycline on the pres-
ence of CD45� monocytes in the brain was determined next. As
reported here previously, RSD appeared to increase brain mono-
cytes in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 9C). Consistent with this finding,
there was a significant effect of condition on CD45� cell number
(F(2,17) � 3.63, p � 0.052; Fig. 9D), with a significant increase in
vehicle-treated RSD mice (p � 0.05) that was not detected in
minocycline-treatedRSDmice(p�0.886).Next,IL-1�mRNAwas
determined in the brain after RSD. There was a significant main
effect of condition on IL-1� mRNA (F(2,24) � 6.12, p � 0.01;
Fig. 9E), with a significant increase in vehicle-treated RSD
mice (p � 0.01) that was not detected in minocycline-treated
RSD mice (p � 0.564). These results indicate that minocycline
inhibited microglia activation and prevented monocyte re-
cruitment to the brain after RSD.
Minocycline prevented spatial memory impairments
after RSD
Next, the effect of minocycline treatment on stress-induced
memory deficits was determined. To do this, mice were trained
on the Barnes maze for 4 d before being exposed to RSD with or
without minocycline treatment. Mice were then tested for spatial
memory recall at 1 and 2 d after RSD (Fig. 10A). The groups
showed no difference in latency (F(2,19) � 0.621, p � 0.549; Fig.
10B) or errors (F(2,19) � 518, p � 0.606; Fig. 10C) during the
acquisition phase. However, during the testing phase, there was a
significant effect of condition on latency (F(2,19) � 5.606, p �
0.05; Fig. 10B) and errors (F(2,19) � 4.079, p � 0.05; Fig. 10C), in
which vehicle-treated RSD mice exhibited increased latency and
errors on all testing days (p � 0.05 for all) but minocycline-
treated RSD mice did not (p � 0.40, for all). These data show that
inhibition of neuroinflammatory activation by minocycline pre-
vented RSD-induced spatial memory recall deficits.

McKim, Niraula et al. • Stress-Induced Neuroinflammation Impairs Memory
 Minocycline did not prevent persistent social avoidance or
long-term deficits in NPC differentiation
We show that RSD has a long-term effect on social avoidance and
neuronal cell fate. Therefore, we next sought to determine
whether minocycline blocked the effects of RSD on social behav-
ior and NPC differentiation. To do this, mice were administered
minocycline during RSD and were injected with BrdU over the
last three cycles of social defeat. Then, social behavior was deter-
mined 28 d later, and brains were collected for BrdU immuno-
histochemistry (Fig. 11A). As reported previously (Wohleb et al.,
2014a), there was a significant effect of trial on interaction time
(F(1,20) � 6.214, p � 0.05; Fig. 11B), in which CON mice spent
significantly more time in interaction in the Social Trial com-
pared with the Empty Trial (p � 0.05). This social preference
was not detected in either vehicle-treated (p � 0.833) or
minocycline-treated (p � 0.594) RSD mice. Thus, treatment
with minocycline did not prevent reduced social preference in
RSD mice. Next, hippocampal brain sections were labeled for
BrdU and NeuN. As shown previously, the majority of BrdU �
cells in CON mice started expressing the mature neuronal marker
(NeuN) by this 28 d time point, and this neuronal differentiation
appeared to again be attenuated by RSD (Fig. 11C). Analysis of
these differences revealed a main effect of condition on the per-
centage of BrdU � cells that were NeuN � (F(1,19) � 5.287, p �
0.05; Fig. 11D), in which both vehicle-treated (p � 0.05) and
minocycline-treated (p � 0.01) RSD mice showed significant
reduction compared with vehicle CON mice. Thus, long-term
deficits in social behavior and NPC differentiation after RSD were
not prevented by minocycline treatment.
Discussion
We extend our previous findings on stress and neuroinflamma-
tion to show that RSD caused pronounced microglia activation
and monocyte recruitment within the caudal hippocampus.
These changes were associated with disruptions in hippocampal-
dependent cognition, as evidenced by impaired spatial memory
recall. Moreover, RSD caused long-term disruptions in the dif-
ferentiation of NPCs into neurons at 10 and 28 d after RSD.
Parallel with neuroinflammatory activation, the reduction in
neuronal maturation was more pronounced in the caudal hip-
pocampus 28 d after RSD, at which point social avoidance behav-
ior was also maintained. This is relevant because the caudal
hippocampus is a key regulator of mood and certain depressive-
like behaviors, such as social avoidance (Lehmann et al., 2013).
The role of neuroinflammatory activation in behavioral and neu-
ronal effects of RSD was delineated using minocycline interven-
tion. Minocycline prevented microglia activation and monocyte
recruitment within the hippocampus. In addition, minocycline
prevented spatial memory deficits after RSD but did not prevent
social avoidance behavior or deficits in NPC differentiation.
These data highlight neuroinflammatory-dependent and -in-
dependent behavioral deficits after RSD. Together, RSD induced
neuroinflammatory signaling in the hippocampus, and inhibi-
tion of this signaling prevented stress-induced memory impair-
ments independent of neurogenesis.
A novel finding of this study was the increased presence of
CD45 � monocytes in the hippocampus after RSD. We reported
previously that GFP � monocytes infiltrate into the hippocampus
of bone marrow-chimeric mice (Wohleb et al., 2013). Here we
confirm these findings in wild-type mice that were not exposed to
myeloablation, thus avoiding chimera-associated variability that
could influence the percentage of cells entering the CNS paren-
chyma. Notably, however, myeloablation by low dose busulfan is
not associated with artifactual monocyte recruitment (Kierdorf
et al., 2013; Wohleb et al., 2013). Overall, we have consistently
detected an influx of CD11b �/CD45 hi/Ly6C � monocytes into
the brain of wild-type mice after RSD (Wohleb et al., 2011, 2013,
2014a,c). Here, labeling of CD45 � cells confirmed that the num-
ber of monocytes in the hippocampus was increased 0.5 d after
RSD. In addition, this increase in monocyte recruitment was pro-
nounced in the caudal hippocampus, which corresponded with
Figure 10.
Minocycline prevented spatial memory impairments after RSD. Mice were trained on the Barnes maze to acquire learning before social defeat (Pre-Veh CON, Pre-Veh RSD, and
Pre-MinoRSD).ThePre-MinoRSDgroupreceivedminocycline(90mg/kg)indrinkingwater1dbeforeRSDandcontinuedthroughouttheRSDperiod.Miceweresubjectedtosixcyclesofsocialdefeat

 higher Iba-1 immunoreactivity of micro-
glia. Consistent with previous studies
(Wohleb et al., 2013; Sawicki et al., 2015),
the increased presence of macrophages and
de-ramified microglia in the hippocampus
were associated with elevated mRNA ex-
pression of IL-1�, TNF�, and IL-6. Because
of the relative infrequency of brain macro-
phages compared with microglia in naive
mice, microglia are the primary producers
of cytokine mRNA under homeostasis.
However, our previous studies suggest that
monocytetraffickingduringRSDcanprop-
agate and enhance cytokine signaling in the
brain(Wohlebetal.,2013).Thus,enhanced

performance in the MWM and the Barnes
maze. In the MWM, deficits were detected
during the probe trial but not during the
learning phase, which is indicative of im-
paired memory recall (Morris, 1984). Nota-
bly, moderately impaired performance was
also detected in the working memory ver-
sion of the MWM in the first 3 d after RSD.
Nonetheless, the interpretation of these re-
sults was confounded by anxiety-like search
patterns observed in the mice during test-
ing. Based on this confound, we aimed to
distinguish stress-induced memory impair-
ment from stress-induced anxiety. There-
fore, mice were trained to locate the escape hole during the
acquisition phase of the Barnes maze before RSD. The recall test was
performed1and2dafterthelastcycleofsocialdefeat.Miceexposed

Together, RSD induced a transient impairment in spatial memory
recall that was independent of anxiety and best detected using the
Barnes maze assay.
A novel aspect of this study was that RSD reduced the neuronal
cell fate of NPCs that proliferated during stress exposure. Surpris-
ingly, RSD did not reduce the proliferation of NPCs or the number
of young neurons in the DG. Impaired neurogenesis was evident
during fate-mapping of proliferating cells. This revealed that RSD
significantly reduced the number of DCX�/BrdU� cells 10 d after
RSD. Furthermore, the number of BrdU� cells that matured into
neurons (NeuN�/BrdU�) was reduced 28 d after RSD. Thus, RSD
did not affect the number of proliferating NPCs initially but did
reduce the total number of NPCs maturing into neurons that were
incorporated into the dentate circuitry.
It is important to note the temporal mismatch between mem-
ory deficits and deficits in neurogenesis. For instance, the spatial
memory deficits were transient and no longer present 28 d after
RSD. It is likely that neuroinflammatory activation (e.g., in-
creased IL-1�), more so than altered neurogenesis, contributes to
impaired spatial memory. This possibility is underscored by mi-
nocycline treatment, which attenuated memory deficits after
RSD but had no effect on NPC cell fate. Alteration in physiolog-
ical levels of IL-1� has also been shown to impair memory in fear
conditioning paradigms (Goshen et al., 2007) and promote hip-
pocampal monocyte trafficking (Liu et al., 2015). A prevailing
hypothesis is that stress-induced cognitive deficits are attribut-
able to impairments in neurogenesis (McEwen, 1999). The mis-
match between acute memory recall deficits and impaired NPC
differentiation shown here are inconsistent with this hypothesis.
Nonetheless, these data are evidence for ongoing, cumulative ef-
fects of RSD on neuronal plasticity. Myriad studies report a re-
duction in the number of neurons and proliferating NPCs with
stress. For example, 4 weeks of chronic isolation stress reduced
the number of DCX � cells in the DG and impaired several mea-
sures of learning and memory in an IL-1 receptor-dependent
manner (Ben Menachem-Zidon et al., 2008). The 4 week span in
the study allows enough time for cells to differentiate into neu-
rons and be incorporated into circuitry. This report aligns with
our current finding of impaired neuronal maturation in the DG
28 d after RSD. It is likely that neurogenesis has more profound
behavioral implications in stress models that persist at least 4
weeks. Nonetheless, the long-term cognitive affect of RSD-
induced impaired neurogenesis is yet to be fully determined.
An important point for discussion is that increased number of
monocytes and microglial activation after RSD spatially co-
occurred with reduced NPC maturation in the caudal hippocam-

 pus. This selective reduction in neurogenesis in the caudal
hippocampus after social stress has been reported previously
(Lehmann et al., 2013). Notably, there is a functional dichotomy
between the rostral and the caudal hippocampus in cognitive and
affective processing (Fanselow and Dong, 2010). The rostral hip-
pocampus is involved in learning, memory, and navigation (Fan-
selow and Dong, 2010), whereas the caudal hippocampus is
involved with the regulation of mood states such as depression.
The caudal hippocampus projects to the prefrontal cortex, bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, and subcortical structures associ-
ated with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that can indi-
rectly influence learning and memory efficiency (Bannerman et
al., 2004). These observations align with the expectation that the
caudal rather than rostral hippocampus would exhibit enhanced
neuronal activation with stress, leading to region-specific neuro-
inflammatory activation and altered NPC cell fate.
Previous work shows that social defeat causes persistent social
avoidance (Wohleb et al., 2013; Donahue et al., 2014) that is
interpreted as depressive-like behavior (Berton et al., 2006;
Krishnan et al., 2007; Golden et al., 2011; Ramirez et al., 2015).
The association between reduced neurogenesis, elevated inflam-
mation, and increased depressive-like behavior has also been
shown in previous studies (Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011; Dinel et
al., 2014). Here, we report maintenance of RSD-induced social
avoidance and reduction in the number of newly matured neu-
rons, both of which were unaltered by minocycline. These find-
ings suggest that social avoidance observed 28 d after RSD is
unrelated to neuroinflammatory signaling and may be related to
reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This observation is
consistent with our previous report that a single cycle of social
defeat is sufficient to induce social avoidance (Wohleb et al.,
2014a) without inducing neuroinflammatory activation (Woh-
leb et al., 2013).
In summary, RSD promoted hippocampal neuroinflamma-
tory activation that was characterized by increased expression of
proinflammatory gene expression along with pronounced mi-
croglia activation and monocyte recruitment within the caudal
hippocampus. In addition, RSD impaired neurogenesis via re-
duced neuronal cell fate of NPCs rather than reduced prolifera-
tion that is typically reported with stress. Neuroinflammatory
activation and impaired NPC differentiation in the hippocampus
corresponded with transient spatial memory deficits and persis-
tent social avoidance behavior, respectively. Minocycline pre-
vented RSD-induced neuroinflammatory activation, resulting in
a rescue of memory deficits but did not prevent social avoidance
or alter impaired NPC cell fate. Collectively, these studies re-
vealed a dichotomy of stress-induced behaviors that were either
dependent on neuroinflammatory activation, such as anxiety and
memory deficits, or independent of neuroinflammation, such as
social avoidance behavior.
