During development, pyramidal neurons undergo dynamic regulation of AMPA receptor
(AMPAR) subunit composition and density to help drive synaptic plasticity and
maturation. These normal developmental changes in AMPARs are particularly vulnerable
to risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), which include loss or mutations
of synaptic proteins and environmental insults, such as dietary zinc deficiency. Here,
we show how Shank2 and Shank3 mediate a zinc-dependent regulation of AMPAR
function and subunit switch from GluA2-lacking to GluA2-containing AMPARs. Over
development, we found a concomitant increase in Shank2 and Shank3 with GluA2 at
synapses, implicating these molecules as potential players in AMPAR maturation. Since
Shank activation and function require zinc, we next studied whether neuronal activity
regulated postsynaptic zinc at glutamatergic synapses. Zinc was found to increase
transiently and reversibly with neuronal depolarization at synapses, which could affect
Shank and AMPAR localization and activity. Elevated zinc induced multiple functional
changes in AMPAR, indicative of a subunit switch. Specifically, zinc lengthened the decay
time of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents and reduced their inward rectification in
young hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, both Shank2 and Shank3 were necessary
for the zinc-sensitive enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and
act in concert to promote removal of GluA1 while enhancing recruitment of GluA2 at
pre-existing Shank puncta. These findings highlight a cooperative local dynamic
regulation of AMPAR subunit switch controlled by zinc signaling through Shank2 and
Shank3 to shape the biophysical properties of developing glutamatergic synapses. Given
the zinc sensitivity of young neurons and its dependence on Shank2 and Shank3, genetic
mutations and/or environmental insults during early development could impair synaptic
maturation and circuit formation that underlie ASD etiology.

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
INTRODUCTION
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have symptom onset during
the first three years of life, a period characterized by intense
formation and refinement of synaptic connections. Therefore,
it is not surprising that many ASD-associated genes encode
synaptic proteins, such as neuroligins (NL3 and NL4; Jamain
et al., 2003; Laumonnier et al., 2004), neurexins (Nrx1; Kim
et al., 2008), and the Shank family of proteins (Durand et al.,
2007; Berkel et al., 2010; Leblond et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2012).
This suggests that changes in synaptic structure and function
are causally associated with ASDs (Chen et al., 2014; Bourgeron,
2015). Synaptic deficits are also strongly linked with ASD-related
environmental insults (such as prenatal inflammation and zinc
deficiency) during the critical periods of brain development
(Yasuda et al., 2011; Forrest et al., 2012; Grabrucker et al., 2014;
Giovanoli et al., 2016), underscoring synapses as a potential
focus for genetic and environmental interactions. Therefore, a
better understanding of signaling pathways regulating synapse
development is essential to discover effective pharmacotherapies
for ASDs.
Mutations in the human SHANK2 and SHANK3 genes have
been implicated in ASDs. Disruptions of these molecules serve
as key models to study the underlying neuronal and synaptic
dysfunction of ASDs (Harony et al., 2013; Jiang and Ehlers,
2013). The family of Shank proteins (Shank1, Shank2 and
Shank3) are key multidomain molecules at excitatory synapses
that interact with multiple glutamatergic receptors, cell adhesion
molecules and cytoskeletal proteins (Boeckers et al., 1999;
Naisbitt et al., 1999; Sheng and Kim, 2000; Arons et al., 2012).
While they share high structural similarity and all localize to
postsynaptic sites, Shank proteins are differentially expressed
during development with Shank2 and Shank3 peaking before
Shank1 (Boeckers et al., 1999; Grabrucker et al., 2011). Thus,
Shank2 and Shank3 are thought to be critical for plastic aspects
of synaptic activity during development and are the focus of
this work. For example, Shank2 is thought to play a key role
in growth cone function and nascent synapse formation (Du
et al., 1998; Bresler et al., 2004) and Shank3 for dendritic
spine morphogenesis (Roussignol et al., 2005). Both Shank2 and
Shank3 knockout mice show impairments of synaptic plasticity
and learning (Bozdagi et al., 2010; Peça et al., 2011; Won et al.,
2012; Lee E. J. et al., 2015). Together, these data support the
important roles of Shank2 and Shank3 in synapse formation and
plasticity.
Shank2 and Shank3 have also been implicated in the
maturation of synapses. For example, loss of Shank2 in mice
resulted in reduced GluA1 levels, delayed synaptic maturation,
and a reduction of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function (Peter
et al., 2016; Wegener et al., 2017). Similarly, Shank3 was
shown to play a key role in the postnatal development
of excitatory synapses, such that loss of Shank3 increased
the AMPA/NMDA ratio and impaired the developmental
AMPAR subunit switch (Peça et al., 2011; Bariselli et al.,
2016). Such cellular and molecular deficits and autistic-like
phenotypes in these mouse models were rescued by both
genetic and pharmacological restoration of AMPAR functions
(Bariselli et al., 2016; Mei et al., 2016). These findings suggest
that Shank2 and Shank3 are critical for AMPAR recruitment
and functionality in multiple brain circuits. Mechanistically,
these Shank proteins could induce such changes by direct
modulation of GluA1 trafficking via the Rich2 or mGluR
dependent pathways, and/or indirectly through an interaction
with GluA2 via GRIP (Sheng and Kim, 2000; Uchino et al., 2006;
Verpelli et al., 2011; Raynaud et al., 2013). Understanding the
interactions between Shank proteins and AMPAR will provide
key insights into how they operate to regulate subunit switching
of AMPARs during development.
Zinc has been shown to regulate the structure and function
of Shank2 and Shank3 through its binding to the C-terminal
sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain in these proteins. Both of
these proteins require zinc binding for their synaptic localization,
oligomerization, mobility and trans-synaptic signaling (Boeckers
et al., 2005; Baron et al., 2006; Grabrucker et al., 2011;
Arons et al., 2016). ASD-associated mutations in the SAM
domain are associated with severe synaptic deficits in cell
culture and mouse models (Baron et al., 2006; Durand et al.,
2012; Speed et al., 2015). Interestingly, prenatal zinc deficiency
also reduced expression level of Shank2 and Shank3 as
well as Shank-binding partners, such as GluA1, suggesting
that these Shank proteins act as mediators of zinc effects
on synaptic function (Grabrucker et al., 2014). Furthermore,
Shank3 was shown to be necessary for zinc-sensitive potentiation
of AMPAR evoked EPSCs in young hippocampal neurons
(Arons et al., 2016). In most neurons, basal free intracellular
zinc is tightly regulated at very low picomolar concentrations
(Maret, 2017). One endogenous source of free zinc for Shank
modulation includes zinc release from synaptic vesicles which
can enter postsynaptic sites via different ion channels, such
as calcium-permeable AMPAR, NMDAR and voltage-gated
calcium channels (Vogt et al., 2000; Frederickson et al., 2006;
Vergnano et al., 2014). Synaptic activity could also trigger zinc
release from postsynaptic zinc buffers, such as Metallothionein
III or mitochondria (Masters et al., 1994; Cuajungco and Lees,
1998; Cole et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003; Bossy-Wetzel et al.,
2004). We thus hypothesize that zinc is well positioned to serve
as a dynamic regulator to activate Shank-dependent pathways,
such as regulating AMPAR subunit composition during synaptic
development.
Here,
we
examine
how
Shank2,
Shank3
and
zinc
mechanistically regulate AMPAR subunit composition and
function in developing synapses. Our data reveal that during
development, these Shank proteins exhibit increased synaptic
localization
in
parallel
with
GluA2-containing
AMPAR,
supporting the hypothesis that they might play a role in the
maturation of AMPARs. To test this, we studied whether
neuronal activity regulated the level of postsynaptic zinc
at glutamatergic synapses and in turn affected Shank and
AMPAR localization and activity. We showed that K+-induced
neuronal depolarization elevated postsynaptic zinc transiently
and reversibly. Zinc elevation was found to enhance synaptic
efficacy by recruiting GluA2 and dispersing GluA1 at Shank-
containing synapses in young neurons. Importantly, knockdown
of either Shank2 or Shank3 function abolished the zinc-induced

enhancement of AMPAR-mediated transmission, indicating that
Shank2 and Shank3 are critical mediators of a zinc-dependent
AMPAR signaling pathway. Together, these data provide a
potential mechanistic link between genetic mutations in Shank
proteins and zinc deficiency in the etiology of ASD.

Short-Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Design and
Cloning
Sequences of Rattus norvegicus Shank2 and Shank3 from
GenBank (NIH) were utilized to design short-hairpin RNA
(shRNA) specifically targeting either Shank2 or Shank3. Online
software (sidirect2.rnai.jp) was utilized to identify candidate
sequences using criteria from three references (Amarzguioui and
Prydz, 2004; Reynolds et al., 2004; Ui-Tei et al., 2004) with a
maximal melting temperature (Tm) of 21◦C. Literature searches
for shRNA targeting Shank2 or Shank3 were also performed to
provide a secondary selection of our custom designed shRNA. All
candidate sequences were then further examined and modified
using the iRNAi software (mekentosj.com). Forward and reverse
oligo sequences were synthesized, annealed and cloned into the
pZoff vector (see below; Leal-Ortiz et al., 2008). The different
elements included: recognition sites of restriction enzymes used

5% CO2 incubator at 37◦C and passaged every 2–3 days
using TrypLE and mechanical trituration. Cells used for viral
production were passaged fewer than 10 times after their initial
acquisition from ATCC.
Primary Rat Hippocampal Neurons
Primary rat hippocampal neurons were prepared according to a
Banker culture protocol from hippocampi of wildtype Sprague-
Dawley rat embryos (embryonic day 18 or 19) with mixed gender
(Kaech and Banker, 2006). Rats were handled in accordance
with Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory
Animal (APLAC) guidelines (Protocol #14607). Hippocampi
were dissected in ice cold HBSS supplemented with 10 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, glucose and Anti-Anti and digested in trypsin
in Neurobasal media at 37◦C for 15 min. Cells were dissociated
and plated at a density of 178 cells per mm2 on poly-D-lysine-
coated coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply Company) with
paraffin feet in warmed neuronal plating media (0.6% glucose,
10% HS and 100 µM sodium pyruvate in MEM). After 1 h,
coverslips were transferred in pairs to 60-mm dishes containing
a glial feeder layer, where they were inverted and maintained
in Neurobasal media containing B-27 and GlutaMAX in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37◦C. Neurons were fed with
a half media exchange twice per week. At 7 days in vitro (DIV 7),
cells were treated with 800 nM Ara-C for approximately 24 h.
Primary Astrocyte Cultures
Primary astrocytes from the cortex of P0–2 rats with mixed
gender were prepared according to the Papain Dissociation Kit.
In brief, cortices from neonate rats were dissected, placed in
dissection media, chopped into small pieces and then digested
with papain and DNase. The astrocytes were cultured in glial
media (10% FBS, 100 µM sodium pyruvate, 5 µg/ml N-acetyl-L-
cysteine, 5 µg/ml insulin and 5 ng/ml hydrocortisone in DMEM).
Microglia and other contaminating cells were shaken off of a
confluent monolayer at one week, after which cells were allowed
to recover. Upon reaching 80%–90% confluence, astrocytes were
passaged, plated or harvested for cryopreservation. For use in
Banker cultures, astrocytes were passed and plated one day prior
to neuron preparation.
Gene Delivery
Neuronal Transfections
Neuronal transfections were performed using Lipofectamine
2000 as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) with
the following modifications. Neurons were transfected at
DIV 9–10 with a 1.8:1 ratio of Lipofectamine to DNA in
transfection media (Neurobasal supplemented with Glutamax).
After incubation at 37◦C for 80 min, coverslips were placed back
into their original 60 mm dishes with a half media exchange.
Hippocampal neurons were incubated for 2–4 days prior to
imaging experiments.
Lentivirus Production
To create lentivirus for expression of a given protein or shRNA,
HEK293T cells were transfected in suspension with the lentiviral
transfer plasmids FU-X-Wm, envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G,
and packaging plasmid SPAX2 (2.8:1:1.5 ratio, respectively)
using Lipofectamine 2000 to generate replication-incompetent
lentivirus. The transfection media was replaced with complete
Neurobasal media 6 h post-transfection, and cells were moved
to a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 32◦C. After 48–52 h, the
lentivirus containing supernatant was collected, passed through a
0.45 µm filter to remove cellular debris and stored at -80◦C until
use. Biological Safety Level 2+ (BSL-2+) guidelines were applied
for all lentiviral production and handling.
Lentiviral Infection
Hippocampal
cultures
were
infected
by
the
addition
of
100–130 µL of lentivirus, to hippocampal neurons in 60 mm
dishes at DIV 0–5 to infect 80%–100% of neurons depending on
the day of infection.
Electrophysiological Recordings
General Experimental Conditions
Neurons
were
transferred
to
a
recording
chamber
and
perfused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with HibernateE [in mM:
81.4 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.0025 Fe(NO3)3∗9H2O, 5.26 KCl,

34 D-glucose, 10 MOPS, 0.227 sodium pyruvate, Vitamin MEM
(1:27) and Amino Acid MEM (1:26), pH 7.3, 235–240 mOs] at
RT. Hibernate mimics the composition of Neurobasal media and
improves both the stability and duration of recordings. Neurons
were visualized using a 60× 0.9 NA LUMPlanFl/IR objective
(Olympus Corporation) using differential contrast optics on an
Axioskop 50 FS microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an X-Cite
120Q excitation light source. Pyramidal neurons were selected
for electrophysiological recordings based on their pyramidal or
pear-shaped somata with 3-4 primary dendrites.
Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recordings of
AMPAR-Mediated Miniature EPSCs
Whole-cell recordings in voltage-clamp mode were obtained
using borosilicate glass electrodes (Sutter Instrument) with a tip
resistance of 3–7 MΩ. The internal solution contained (in mM):
114.5 gluconic acid, 114.5 CsOH, 2 NaCl, 8 CsCl, 10 MOPS,
4 EGTA, 4 MgATP and 0.3 Na2GTP, pH 7.3, adjusted with
CsOH.
Signals were amplified with a Multiclamp 700A amplifier,
sampled at 20 kHz, filtered at 2.4 kHz, acquired using a Digidata
1440A digitizer and pClamp 10 (all from Molecular Devices).
Cells were held at -60 mV, and AMPAR-mediated miniature
EPSCS were isolated using bath application of TTX (1 µM),
D-AP5 (50 µM) and picrotoxin (100 µM).
ZnCl2 (10 µM) was bath applied in HibernateE to the cultured
neurons. Series resistance (Rs) was monitored throughout the
duration of all recordings, and data were excluded if Rs
increased >20%.

D-AP5) and GABAR blocker (100 µM picrotoxin). For these
recordings, the internal pipette solution contained (in mM)
101 gluconic acid, 101 CsOH, 11 KCl, 10 MOPS, 2.9 QX 314,
1 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP and 50 µM spermine,
pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH (250 mOsm). In addition to D-AP5
and picrotoxin, a very low concentration of NBQX (0.05 µM)
was added to the bath to reduce spontaneous AMPAR-mediated
synaptic activity that occurred under conditions of disinhibition
(Kumar et al., 2002). To stimulate evoked AMPA EPSCs,
a platinum parallel bipolar electrode (FHC) was placed in
close proximity (∼1.5 mm) to the recorded neurons. Synaptic
activity was evoked by delivering current pulses of 4–5 mA
for 0.5 ms at intervals of 20 s. Post data collection, membrane
potentials were corrected for a liquid junction potential of
18 mV.
Analysis
We detected and analyzed miniature EPSCs with wDetecta,
a custom postsynaptic current detection program1. Numerical
values are given as median ± SEM unless stated otherwise.
Quantification of zinc conditions was performed using data
after 10 min of zinc application to capture the plateau
phase of the zinc effects. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed
rank tests were applied to compare between baseline and
ZnCl2 conditions for young or mature neurons. For shRNA
experiments, the effect of genotypes on the zinc response
were tested by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Sidak correction multiple post hoc comparison was applied
to determine the difference between baseline and ZnCl2
within the same genotype. Statistical significance was set at
p < 0.05.
For
cumulative
probability
distributions,
each
cohort
population was composed of a random selection of equal
number of events per condition from each cell (i.e., 600 events
from 12 cells). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K.S.) test was applied to
determine statistical significance (p < 0.005) for experiments
with two samples. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA with
Dunn’s correction post hoc multiple comparison was used for
experiments with more than two samples.
For evoked AMPAR EPSC, current response at each holding
voltage was measured by averaging the value within 3–6 ms
of peak current using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). The
I/V slope for negative and positive responses was calculated
separately for each condition (baseline or ZnCl2) of each cell
using linear regression in Excel 2016 (Microsoft Office). For
the population I/V curve, current responses were normalized
to the value at the most negative potential. The rectification
index was defined as the ratio of the I/V slope of negative
responses over that of positive responses. The correlation
between the rectification index and change in RI induced by
ZnCl2 application was calculated using a two-tailed Pearson
correlation coefficient analysis, and statistical significance was set
at p < 0.05.
All graphs and statistical analyses were done in Prism 6.0
(GraphPad Software).

Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblots of cellular lysates were prepared from lentiviral
infected hippocampal neurons as described previously (Hsieh
et al., 2016; Okerlund et al., 2017). In brief, neurons were
infected with a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA and enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) on DIV 1. Lysates from these
neurons were harvested at DIV 14–15 in Laemmli loading
buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Lysates were
loaded on either a 4%–15% or 4%–20% polyacrylamide gels
(Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membrane (Bio-Rad). After washing (0.1% Triton X-100 in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) and blocking (5% non-fat
powdered milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) overnight at
4◦C, membranes were probed with primary and secondary
antibodies in blocking solution. Protein bands were visualized
by West Dura ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Membranes
were either blotted simultanously with Shank and actin
antibodies or blotted with Shank antibodies first, then stripped
using Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher)
and blotted again for actin to standardize protein levels.
Representative blots of relevant protein bands are shown in
the figures, and full blots are provided in the Supplementary
Material.
Immunocytochemistry
Whole-Cell Staining
For whole-cell staining, wild-type (WT) or transfected rat
hippocampal neurons were washed at room temperature (RT)
with HibernateE solution. Cells were then placed in fixative
solution [in mM: 60 PIPES, 25 HEPES, 120 sucrose, 2 MgCl2,
10 EGTA and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), pH 7.4] for 10 min
at RT. After fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS,
permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Thermo Scientific)
in PBS for 2 min and washed twice with PBS at RT. Fixed
and permeabilized cells were incubated in blocking solution
(2% glycine, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% gelatin, and
50 mM NH4Cl in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at RT, and then
primary antibodies were applied in blocking solution overnight
at 4◦C. After the primary antibody incubation, cells were washed
three times with blocking solution, followed by the addition
of secondary antibodies for 1–2 h at RT. After secondary
antibody application, cells were washed three times with PBS
and rinsed quickly with water. Neurons were then mounted
with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) on pre-cleaned glass
slides.
Surface Staining of AMPAR Subunits
The protocol for surface staining of AMPAR subunits was
modified from published studies (Lu et al., 2001; Mangiavacchi
and Wolf, 2004; Park et al., 2004). Coverslips were incubated
in HibernateE solution with or without 10 µM ZnCl2 for
20 min at RT. After treatment, coverslips were incubated with
GluA1 or GluA2 antibodies in HibernateE with 2% BSA at 4◦C
on ice for 1 h. After primary antibody labeling, coverslips were
washed twice with 2% BSA in HibernateE and placed in fixative
solution. Neurons were then permeabilized and co-stained for

Chemical Labeling of Endogenous
GluA2-Containing AMPAR Using CAM2
Labeling Conditions and Specificity Testing of
CAM2 Reagent
For chemical labeling of endogenous GluA2-containing AMPAR
in hippocampal neurons, labeling conditions were modified from
the original published protocol (Wakayama et al., 2017) to allow
for maximal labeling efficiency and minimal internalization of
receptors. In brief, neurons were washed twice with Tyrode’s
solution [in mM: 96 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2∗2H2O,
10 HEPES and 25 D-glucose, pH 7.3], then incubated in
a humidified box for 3 h with 3 µM Alexa 647-CAM2 or
Alexa 488-CAM2 in Tyrode’s solution at 17◦C to minimize
internalization of AMPARs (Wakayama et al., 2017). To
assess the specificity of the CAM2 reagent for tagging the
GluA2 subunit, after labeling, neurons were washed three times
with Tyrode’s solution and then immunostained for GluA1 and
GluA2 subunits using the whole-cell staining protocol described
previously.
Sequential Dual-Labeling Experiment of Endogenous
GluA2-Containing AMPAR
Neurons were first labeled with Alexa 647-CAM2 using the
labeling protocol described above. Cells were then washed three
times with Tyrode’s solution, treated with 10 µM ZnCl2 or
MgCl2 (control) in Tyrode’s solution for 20 min at RT. After
treatment, neurons were labeled again with Alexa 488-CAM2.
After the second labeling, neurons were washed three times
with Tyrode’s solution and immunostained with MAP2 and
either Shank2 or Shank3 antibodies using the whole-cell staining
protocol described previously.
Zinc Imaging
Labeling
A high affinity zinc-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoZin-3 AM (Kd
for Zn2+ ∼15 nM), was used for measuring total zinc and a low
affinity zinc indicator, Newport Green DCF (NPG, Kd for Zn2+
∼1 µM), for free Zn2+. For measuring intracellular zinc, neurons
were loaded with FluoZin-3 (1–2 µM) or NPG (5 µM) for 30 min
at RT, washed three times with Tyrode’s solution and incubated
for another 20–30 min at RT to allow for dye deesterification.
Experimental Set Up
To assess free zinc changes with extracellular manipulation
of zinc, WT neurons were loaded with NPG as described
above. Sister cultures were treated with different ZnCl2
concentrations (with or without pyrithione, a zinc ionophore)
and TPEN concentration (a zinc chelator) at RT. After
10 min of treatment, neurons were washed with Tyrode’s
solution, fixed, washed three times with PBS, and mounted
onto slides. To monitor live zinc dynamics, WT neurons
were utilized for whole-cell zinc assessment, and neurons

confocal (Perkin Elmer) fitted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted
microscope. The excitation light of a Krypton/Argon ion laser
(643-RYB-A02; Melles Griot) was selected by 488/10 nm,

488, a 607/45 nm bandpass filter for Alexa 568 or a 700/75 nm
filter for Alexa 647, was obtained using a Cascade 512B
camera (Roper). For between sample comparison, all images
were acquired with the same settings without knowledge

To acquire image stacks that could be deconvolved for
further analysis, images were sampled using the Nyquist
criterion.
Time-Lapse Imaging of Zinc Dynamics in Spines
For this experiment, three-dimensional fluorescence images
(8-bit, 512 × 512) were acquired using a SP8 laser scanning
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc.) with a white-light
laser, hybrid (HyD) photodetectors and a tunable acousto-optical
beam splitter. Custom band-passes (FluoZin-3, wavelength:
488 nm, bandwidth: 493–582 nm; mApple, wavelength: 568 nm,
bandwidth: 583–602 nm) were set for FluoZin-3 and mApple
based on their excitation and emission spectra (FluoZin-
3 maxima, Excitation: 494 nm, Emission: 516 nm; mApple
maxima, Excitation: 568 nm, Emission: 592 nm). Images were
captured with a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion
HC PL Apo objective lens (Leica Microsystems Inc.) with
a pinhole set at 1 Airy unit. For monitoring spine Zn2+
dynamics, images of both mApple and FluoZin-3 channels were
captured every 40–60 s. After 5 min of baseline imaging, cells
were perfused with high potassium Tyrode’s solution (in mM:
11.5 NaCl, 90 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl22H2O, 10 HEPES and
25 glucose, pH 7.3) for 120–180 s and then washed out with
regular Tyrode’s solution for 5–10 min. Zinc increases were
measured immediately post-HiK treatment to allow for full
exchange of solution.

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
3D Colocalization Analysis for Immunocytochemistry
Images were first preprocessed for analysis. Raw image stacks
were background subtracted using a rolling ball radius of
50. They were then 3D deconvolved in Huygens Professional
(Scientific Volume Imaging) software using the theoretically
calculated point spread functions (PSF) and classic maximum
likelihood estimation (CMLE) deconvolution algorithm. Next,
primary dendrites were linearized and extracted from the
full-frame image using the Straighten plugin for ImageJ.
The identification of protein puncta in straightened dendrites,
and analysis of their colocalization in 3D was performed
using a custom software package IMFLAN3D—a combination
of ImageJ and MATLAB functions (Tai et al., 2007). In
brief, straightened dendrites were sharpened, and regions of
concentrated fluorophore intensity (puncta) within the images
were segmented using a watershed algorithm (ImageJ). Once
puncta separation was achieved in each channel, thresholding
was done to remove low intensity noise while keeping higher
intensities intact. Separate threshold values were determined
for each channel, and this common set of threshold values
was used to process all images from all conditions in a given
experiment.
The resulting images with separated puncta were then
processed using custom scripts in Matlab to calculate the
properties of the individual 3D puncta. In brief, individual
puncta were identified in the binary versions of the raw
images using a standard image-processing technique for
labeling

connected
pixels
(26-connectivity

and this identity information was then used to calculate
distributions of individual puncta volume, intensity and other
parameters in the raw images. For analyzing the percentage of
colocalization between two proteins, the following equation was
utilized:

2D Intensity Analysis of Shank Proteins in Dendritic
Puncta vs. Spines
Raw image stacks were processed in Huygens Professional and
ImageJ as described above. Deconvolved 3D images of linearized
dendrites were then Z-projected (sum intensity). An intensity
profile of puncta in the dendritic regions and in the spines were
plotted in ImageJ, and the total intensity was quantified using
area under the curve integration in Prism 6.0. The ratio of total
Shank intensity in the dendritic shaft puncta vs. in the spines
were quantified for each Shank protein in each dendrite as a
metric for their relative contribution to the immature synapses
vs. mature synapses (Niesmann et al., 2011; Valnegri et al.,
2011).
2D Density and Fluorescence Intensity Analysis

and

were background subtracted then Z-projected (average intensity)
prior to use of SynPAnal analysis software (Danielson and Lee,
2014) to quantify 2D density and intensity values along primary
dendrites. For identification of primary dendrites, the eGFP
signal or the GluA1/2 signal was used, and puncta detection
was accomplished by thresholding images and counting distinct
cluster of four or more adjacent pixels above the intensity
threshold. The same detection criteria were applied for different
genotypes. Intensity and density values were extracted from the
software.
2D Puncta Analysis of CAM2 Labeling of
GluA2-Containing AMPAR
Raw image stacks were Z-projected (average intensity). Puncta-
by-puncta analysis was performed using OpenView analysis
software (Friedman et al., 2000; Arons et al., 2012). Shank2 or
Shank3 immuno-positive fluorescent puncta were individually
boxed using a Mexican hat filter and then selected based on the
following criteria: selected puncta must be above background
intensity values in immunostained and CAM2 channels, the
puncta must be discrete and non-overlapping with good spatial
separation, and the puncta must lie within four pixels of a
MAP2-positive dendrite. Puncta fluorescence intensity values
were determined, and subsequent data analysis revealed trends
in the data.
Fluorescence Intensity Analysis of NPG DCF Signal
Raw image stacks were background subtracted and Z-projected
(average intensity). Neuronal cells were identified based on
morphology using bright field images of the same regions. NeuN
staining was performed in an independent set of coverslips
to further confirm the neuronal identity of these cells. Puncta
intensity values of neuronal somas were then determined using
the Time Series Analyzer plugin in ImageJ.
Fluorescence Intensity Analysis of FluoZin-3
Dynamics in Spines
Raw image stacks were background subtracted and Z-projected
(sum intensity). Primary dendrites were then linearized and
extracted from the full-frame image before being analyzed using
custom scripts in Matlab (SpineZap; Mysore et al., 2007). To
select spines, Z-projected images of FluoZin-3 signal at each
time point and of mApple at the first time point were combined
into a single stack and Z-projected (sum intensity; referred to
as t-projection below). Individual boxes covering the spine and
minimal extracellular space were then drawn around each spine
so that the morphology of the spine was clearly visible but not in
close proximity to axons, dendritic projections or tissue debris.
The coordinates of each spine’s box were then utilized to extract
time-lapse images from the raw images in order to further verify
visually whether or not the selected protrusions were spines.
Mean fluorescence intensity values of spines were quantified
using custom codes in MATLAB.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical tests of imaging data were performed in Prism 6.0.
For cumulative probability distributions, each cohort population
was composed of a random selection of an equal number of
puncta values (50–100) from each cell per condition. The K.S. test

was applied to determine statistical significance (p < 0.005) for
experiments with two samples. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA
with Dunn’s correction post hoc multiple comparisons was used
in experiments with more than two samples. Two-way ANOVA
was used to analyze the developmental difference in the ratio of
Shank2 and Shank3 intensities in spines (mature) vs. in dendritic
puncta (immature). The Mann-Whitney test was used for
comparison of mean values between two non-paired conditions.
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were applied to
compare between baseline and high potassium conditions in
time-lapse experiments and to compare the difference in the ratio
of Shank2 and Shank3 intensity in dendritic puncta vs. spine at
each time point.
RESULTS
Changes in Synaptic Expression of
Zinc-Sensitive Shanks and VGluT1 During
Development
To understand the roles of Shank2 and Shank3 on excitatory
synaptic development, we compared the developmental changes
of endogenous proteins in young (DIV 11) and mature (DIV 18)
hippocampal neurons in culture (Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure S1A). Shank postsynaptic clusters (puncta) were analyzed
using a three-dimensional blind analysis. Shank2 showed distinct
clusters along the dendrites and was present in spines at DIV
11 (Figure 1A, left middle panel). Shank2 puncta remained
stable with regard to intensity, density or volume between DIV
11 and DIV 18 (Figure 1A, middle panels and Figures 1B–D). In
contrast, at DIV 11 Shank3 was present mainly in the dendritic
shaft, especially in the proximal dendrites, and dendritic puncta
with limited localization in spines (Figure 1A, left top panel).
At DIV 18, the density of Shank3 puncta increased by 31.6%
compared to DIV 11 (p = 0.0092; Figure 1C) without a change
in puncta intensity or volume (Figures 1B,D). Additionally,
Shank2 and Shank3 showed strong colocalization (Figure 1E)
at DIV 11 (78.14 ± 2.43%) that remained stable through these
developmental stages (DIV 18, 77.23 ± 2.58%), implying that
both proteins might function in concert at the same synapses.
Shank1 was weakly expressed in these cultures during this
window (data not shown; Grabrucker et al., 2011) and was
excluded from the rest of the study.
Motivated by the localization difference in Shank2 and
Shank3 expression pattern at DIV 11 (Figure 1A), we further
examined the contribution of each protein to mature vs.
immature synapses at two additional time points (DIV 14 and
21). This contribution was measured by the ratio of Shank
intensity in spines (mature) vs. in dendritic puncta (immature;
Figure 1H; Valnegri et al., 2011). A ratio of zero means that
Shank2 and Shank3 exclusively occupy immature synapses on
the shaft whereas a ratio of one indicates they contribute
equally to both immature synapses on the dendritic shaft and
mature synapses on spines. In young neurons (DIV 11 and 14),
Shank2 was more biased towards mature synapse localization
in spines (0.69 and 0.67) compared to Shank3, which showed
a stronger dendritic localization (0.51 and 0.58; p = 0.0003 and
p = 0.0024; Figure 1I). Later in development (DIV 18 and 21),
Shank3 localization mimicked Shank2 with an increased spine
localization [0.70 at DIV 21 (p = 0.0024); Figures 1H,I]. Overall,
these findings imply that Shank2 may serve as the primary
scaffolding molecule occupying excitatory synapses early in
development while Shank3 arrives later, which is consistent
with previous studies (Boeckers et al., 1999; Bresler et al., 2004;
Grabrucker et al., 2011).
Next, we wanted to understand the development of Shank-
containing synapses by also looking at VGluT1 for visualization
of presynaptic specializations to distinguish synaptic from
non-synaptic puncta. Striking increases in VGluT1 during
synapse maturation were seen in all measures (Intensity: 131.8%
increase, p < 0.0001; Density: 34.078% increase, p = 0.0004;
Volume: 96.91% increase, p < 0.0001), which is consistent with
an earlier study (Wilson et al., 2005). Because of these large
changes, we again looked at multiple time points (DIV 11,
14, 18 and 21). We found that VGluT1 showed developmental
step-like changes in puncta intensity, density and volume
between DIV 11 and 21, delineating a clear developmental
profile of young neurons (DIV 11–14) and mature neurons
(DIV 18–21; Supplementary Figures S1B–E). More than half
of Shank2 (54.41%) and Shank3 (55.55%) clusters overlap with
punctate VGluT1 staining at DIV 11 (Figure 1E). Concomitant
with these developmental VGluT1 changes, significant increases
with time were seen in all parameters (fraction, density and
volume) of Shank-dependent synapses, as defined by Shank-
VGluT1 overlapping puncta (Figures 1E–G).
Developmental Characterization of AMPAR
Structure and Function
Since Shank2 and Shank3 serve as master scaffolding molecules
that interact with glutamate receptors (Sheng and Kim, 2000;
Uchino et al., 2006), we examined whether the developmental
changes in AMPAR expression track with those of Shank.
Here, we first compared the expression pattern of GluA1 and
GluA2 at two different developmental stages (young—DIV 11
and mature—DIV 18) for GluA1 and GluA2 (Figure 2A).
GluA1 puncta density and intensity remained the same
between DIV 11 and DIV 18 (Figures 2B,C). However,
GluA2 puncta density at DIV 18 more than doubled in
comparison to that of DIV 11 [100.4 ± 15.31 puncta/µm at
DIV 11 vs. 210.1 ± 17.03 puncta/µm at DIV 18 (p = 0.004;
Figure 2C)]. These data identified the time frame for the
AMPAR developmental subunit switch from GluA2-lacking
to GluA2-containing receptors in our hippocampal cultures,
similar to previous findings (Pickard et al., 2000; Kumar et al.,
2002).
Considering the developmental increase of GluA2, we asked
whether this contributes to different functional properties of
these excitatory synapses. To address this question, AMPAR-
mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded and
compared between both groups of neurons (Figure 2D). AMPAR
mEPSC decay time of mature neurons was longer than that of
young neurons (p ≤ 0.005; Figures 2D,E), a finding consistent
with earlier work (Brill and Huguenard, 2008). No difference

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
was found between young and mature neurons in terms of
AMPAR mEPSC amplitude (Figures 2D,F) or frequency (data
not shown). The developmental increase in decay time could
be explained by the slower decay kinetics of GluA2-containing
AMPAR (Geiger et al., 1995).
GluA2-lacking AMPARs are more sensitive to polyamine
blockage at positive holding potentials and thus pass less outward
current than inward current at equivalent distance from the
reversal potential (Kumar et al., 2002). Therefore, we investigated
whether inward rectification of electrically evoked AMPAR
EPSCs changed during development. This was accomplished by
measuring the AMPAR evoked response at different holding
voltages (Figure 2G). In young neurons, AMPAR EPSCs were
consistently smaller at positive holding potentials compared with
those at corresponding negative potentials (Figure 2G, left). In
mature neurons, AMPAR EPSCs were similar in magnitude at
equipotential levels on either side of AMPAR reversal potential
(∼3 mV in our experimental condition; Figure 2G, right),
consistent with decreased rectification. For comparison, we
employed a rectification index (RI) defined as the ratio of
AMPA conductance measured at corresponding positive over
negative holding potentials. The RI of young neurons was
larger than that of the mature neurons (Figure 2H, 37.66%,
p = 0.04). Thus, in young neurons, AMPAR-EPSCs were mostly
characterized by inward rectification in contrast to mature
neurons, similar to previous observations (Jonas et al., 1994;
Geiger et al., 1995; Kumar et al., 2002; Brill and Huguenard,
2008; Bariselli et al., 2016). Together, these data indicate that
AMPAR in young and mature neurons are fundamentally
different in terms of their subunit compositions, leading to
functional effects on their decay kinetics and inward rectification
property.
Depolarization and Exogenous Zinc Cause
an Increase in Intracellular Zinc
Due to the similar developmental expression profiles of
GluA2 and synaptic Shank2 and Shank3 (Figures 1, 2), we
hypothesized that these Shank proteins could play a role in
regulating AMPAR subunit composition during development.
Previous work from our lab showed that Shank3 is required
for zinc-induced AMPAR synaptic potentiation (Arons et al.,
2016), Thus, zinc influx into the postsynaptic compartment
could activate Shank-dependent regulation of AMPAR subunit
composition. We next examined if neuronal stimulation affects
the dynamics of postsynaptic zinc, which could enter from
presynaptic-released zinc in the cleft or postsynaptic sources
(Masters et al., 1994; Cole et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003; Bossy-
Wetzel et al., 2004; Frederickson et al., 2006).
Dissociated hippocampal neurons were transfected with
mApple, as a structural marker, and then loaded with the
membrane permeable fluorescent zinc indicator, FluoZin-3-AM
(Figure 3A). FluoZin-3 fluorescence was present throughout
the soma, dendrite and spines and co-localized with mApple
(Figures 3A,B). Importantly, FluoZin-3 allows for the detection
of small changes in intracellular zinc (Kd = 1.5 nM, detection
range 10 nM-300 µM) and is unaffected by millimolar
concentration of calcium (Zhao et al., 2008). In the absence
of exogenous stimulation, the FluoZin-3 fluorescence signal
remained stable over time (Figure 3C). To determine whether
neural activity affects postsynaptic zinc levels, we briefly
depolarized neurons by the application of 90 mM high potassium
stimulation (HiK). Here, we observed a transient increase of
FluoZin-3 intensity in spines (Figures 3C–E, 47.75% increase
between baseline and during HiK, p = 0.0001). The elevation
was fully reversible after washout (Baseline vs. Wash, p > 0.05;
HiK vs. Wash, p = 0.0001). Together, these data show that zinc is
elevated in postsynaptic spines during neuronal depolarization,
which could bind to Shank2 and Shank3 and influence the
activation of these proteins via conformational changes (Arons
et al., 2016).
We then examined how extracellular manipulations of zinc
change intracellular zinc levels (DIV 11–30). Here, Newport
Green DCF (NPG) was used due to its lower affinity to zinc
(Kd = 1.5 µM, detection range 1 µM-1 mM) for detection
of free intracellular zinc (Thompson et al., 2002). With the
application of 300 µM ZnCl2, hot spots of NPG appeared
along dendrites after a 10 min incubation, potentially indicating
free zinc accumulation in synaptic puncta (Supplementary
Figure S2A). Treatment with ZnCl2 in the presence of a zinc
ionophore, pyrithione (MNO), allowed the passive transport of
zinc between the intra- and extracellular milieu and further
induced the appearance of these putative zinc synaptic puncta
(Supplementary Figure S2A). To assess the free zinc at baseline
condition, we used a high affinity zinc chelator, TPEN (50 µM;
Kd = 0.7 fM; Radford and Lippard, 2013). The zinc-chelating
effect of TPEN was confirmed by its capacity to reduce somatic
FluoZin-3 signal (data not shown). In contrast, we observed
no quantifiable difference of NPG signal between baseline and
zinc chelator (TPEN, 50 µM) treatment. This result showed
that minimal, if any, free intracellular zinc is detectable by this
method under baseline conditions (Supplementary Figure S2C),
consistent with previous studies (Sensi et al., 1997; Canzoniero
et al., 1999). At the population level, 10 µM extracellular ZnCl2
application increased somatic NPG signal above baseline by
24.91% (Supplementary Figures S2B,C), and further increasing
ZnCl2 concentration to 300 µM raised the intracellular NPG
signal even higher. Taken together, these results highlight the low
levels of free intracellular zinc and that exogenous addition of
ZnCl2 can elevated this concentration above baseline. Based on
these findings, we established our experimental conditions for
further experiments using 10 µM ZnCl2.
Zinc Treatment Enhances
AMPAR-Mediated Synaptic Responses in
Young Neurons
What are the functional consequences of the elevation of synaptic
zinc? To test the functional effects of zinc on AMPAR, we
recorded mEPSCs from young hippocampal neurons (DIV
11–14; Figure 4A). After a 10 min application, the addition
of 10 µM ZnCl2 was associated with a relative increase
(39.69%, p = 0.0186) in a fraction of large amplitude events
(event > 20 pA) and a consistent increase of peak amplitude

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
(29.93%, p = 0.002; Figures 4B–D). However, the frequency of
AMPAR mEPSCs was unaffected by zinc application (Figure 4F),
suggesting that the effect of zinc is likely postsynaptic. Consistent
with a postsynaptic locus of action, zinc lengthened the decay
times of AMPAR mEPSCs (19.76%, p = 0.002; Figures 4C,E) but
did not affect rise time (Figure 4G). The increased amplitude
and lengthened decay time resulted in increased synaptic
efficacy as measured by the charge transfer (22.75%, p = 0.001;
Figure 4H). These results reveal that zinc enhanced the strength
of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in young neurons,
perhaps via activity at postsynaptic sites affecting AMPAR
composition and hence response amplitude and kinetics.
Zinc Treatment Reduces Inward
Rectification Property of AMPARs in
Young Neurons
Since the decay time constant increases as a function of
GluA2 content (Figure 2; Geiger et al., 1995), the zinc-induced
slowing
of
decay
might
be due
to the
recruitment of
GluA2. To assess how zinc alters the subunit composition of
functional AMPARs in young neurons, we indirectly assessed
GluA2 content by measuring the current to voltage relationship
of evoked AMPA EPSCs (evoked EPSCs) at baseline and during
zinc treatment. At baseline, synaptic currents were reliably
smaller at positive holding potentials in comparison to those at
corresponding negative levels, indicating these receptors were
inwardly rectifying. The application of zinc led to a more linear
current to voltage relationship (Figures 5A,B, right panels) and a
reduction in the RI (32.8%, p = 0.0061; Figure 5C), observed after
10 min of treatment. Since more linear I/V curves are indicative
of higher relative proportions of GluA2-containing AMPAR
(Kumar et al., 2002; Brill and Huguenard, 2008), this result
suggests that zinc specifically recruited receptors containing
GluA2 subunits and/or reduced the synaptic level of GluA2-
lacking AMPAR.
We also observed that AMPARs in young neurons have a
wide range of RI (1.15–4.71) at baseline, implying variable basal
synaptic GluA2 content. Motivated by this observation, we next
examined the relationship between initial RI and magnitude of

change induced by zinc. From this analysis, the magnitude of RI
changes showed a strong positive correlation with the initial RI
(Figure 5D; R2 = 0.498, p = 0.0071). These data show that the
initial GluA2 content affects the sensitivity of AMPAR to zinc
application.
AMPARs of Mature Neurons Are Not
Affected by Zinc Treatment
Given that the initial GluA2 content appears to predict
the response to zinc treatment (Figure 5D) and mature
neurons had higher GluA2 puncta density than young neurons
(Figures 2A–C), we hypothesized that mature neurons would
have limited sensitivity to zinc. We then recorded AMPAR
mEPSCs in mature neurons (DIV 18–23) at baseline and
examined the effect of zinc application. No detectable changes
in any AMPAR mEPSC parameters (amplitude, kinetics or
frequency) in mature neurons were observed with zinc
application (Figures 6A–C and Supplementary Figures S3A–E),
indicating that zinc has no significant influence on unitary
synaptic strength, kinetics or active synapse numbers at this
age of neuronal development. The insensitivity of AMPAR
mEPSCs in mature neurons to zinc application is unlikely
due to a ceiling effect since no difference in amplitude
between young and mature neurons was observed (Figure 2F).
Increasing zinc concentrations up to 30 µM also did not
elicit any effect on AMPAR mEPSCs (data not shown). These
results indicate that the insensitivity of AMPAR mEPSCs
in mature neurons is independent of the availability of
zinc.
Since zinc did not affect the decay kinetics of AMPAR
mEPSCs, we predicted that it also would not alter the subunit
composition of AMPARs. To indirectly test this, we assessed
the rectification property, which would reflect the relative
contribution of GluA2 to synaptic EPSCs (Figures 6D,E,G,H).
In mature neurons, AMPAR-evoked EPSCs had a highly linear
I/V relationship and low inward rectification (RI = 1.44 ± 0.19),
similar to Figures 2G,H. This low IR remained unchanged
with zinc application in these cells, suggesting that zinc exerted
no effect on AMPAR subunit compositions (Figures 6D–H).
As a result, no correlation was seen between initial RI and
the magnitude of change induced by zinc treatment. Taken
together, the addition of zinc had no significant effect on AMPAR
function and subunit composition in mature neurons, likely
due to the high basal level of GluA2-content in these cells
(Figure 2C).
Zinc Recruits Surface GluA2-Containing
AMPARs and Disperses GluA1 at Existing
Shank-Positive Puncta
To understand the subunit composition changes induced by
zinc, we examined the localization of GluA1 and GluA2 using
an antibody directed against an extracellular epitope for
each subunit (Figure 7A). Sister cultures were treated with
either control or zinc conditions, immunolabeled and analyzed
blind in three-dimensions for surface GluA1 or GluA2. This
served as an immunocytochemical index of AMPAR subunit
composition for comparison with mini and evoked recordings
(Lu et al., 2001; Thiagarajan et al., 2005; Kalashnikova
et al., 2010). Under control conditions, numerous, bright
GluA1 clusters decorated the dendrite (Figure 7A, top left)
in comparison to the low intensity levels of GluA2 puncta
(Figure 7A, bottom left). Zinc treatment led to a marked
increase of GluA2 puncta in terms of intensity (54.34%,
p = 0.0001), volume (29.8%, p = 0.0077) and density
(18%, p = 0.0016; Figures 7B–D). The modest change
in
density
suggests
that
zinc
has
a
stronger
effect
on
GluA2 at preexisting synapses. This agrees with our findings
in which zinc lengthened AMPAR mEPSC decay time and
increased amplitude but did not affect frequency (Figure 4).
Zinc also induced a reduction (19.6%, p = 0.0097) of
GluA1 puncta density (Figure 7C), similar in magnitude
to the increase in GluA2 density. This further emphasized
that the major effect of zinc was to alter AMPAR subunit
composition from GluA2-lacking to GluA2-containing at
existing synapses.
Do the zinc-induced changes of AMPAR subunit composition
involve Shank2 and Shank3? We looked at the pattern
of surface GluA1 and GluA2 incorporation at (Figure 8B,
Supplementary Figure S4) Shank-positive puncta with the
same three-dimensional analysis described previously (Figure 1).
The distribution of AMPARs and Shank puncta were analyzed
(defined as overlap of GluA1 or GluA2 with Shank-positive or
non-Shank puncta; Figure 8). A significant fraction of GluA2-
positive puncta contained Shank2 (72.69%) and Shank3 (61.89%;
Figure 8B, Supplementary Figure S4). A similar fraction
of GluA1-positive puncta associated with Shank2 (73.55%)
and Shank3 (78.38%) puncta (Figure 8B). This suggests that
the majority of AMPAR (both GluA1 and GluA2 clusters)
were found at Shank-positive puncta, consistent with previous
findings on the interaction between both subunits with
Shank2 and Shank3 (Sheng and Kim, 2000; Uchino et al., 2006).
On the other hand, just over half of all Shank puncta were GluA2-
positive (Shank2 56.76%; Shank3 54.82%; Figure 8C) with a
higher fraction associated with GluA1 (Shank2 69.18%; Shank3
61.17%; Figure 8C).
Interestingly, with zinc treatment, there was a significant
decrease in the fraction of GluA1 overlapping with Shank2 and
Shank3 with a large concurrent increase of GluA1 at non-Shank
sites (Figure 8B and Table 1). In contrast with regard to the
total GluA2 population, there was no change in the fraction
of overlap at any type of Shank or non-Shank puncta with
zinc treatment. Instead, with regard to Shank puncta, zinc
changed the distribution of GluA2, such that a higher fraction
of Shank co-clustered with GluA2 than in control conditions
(Table 1). A significant concomitant decrease in GluA2 was
seen at both non-Shank2 and non-Shank3 sites (Table 1).
Together, these data suggest that zinc preferentially recruits
GluA2 to Shank puncta and disperses GluA1 to non-Shank
sites.
Besides increasing the clustering density of GluA2 and
Shank3, zinc treatment also led to an increase in fluorescence
intensity (75.04%) and volume (40.19%) for GluA2 specifically
at Shank3-positive puncta (Figures 8D,E), further supporting

the hypothesis that zinc selectively induces GluA2 incorporation
to Shank3-positive puncta. A similar increase in intensity
in response to zinc was seen in GluA2 at Shank2 puncta
(64.05%) with no significant change in volume (Figures 8D,E
and Table 1). In contrast, zinc decreased GluA1 overlap with
Shank3 as measured by volume (Figure 8E and Table 1).

(132.65%; p < 0.0004) was seen at non-Shank2 sites (Table 1),

Zinc-Sensitive Recruitment of GluA2 via
Exocytosis and Lateral Diffusion Is
Mediated by Shank3
To further understand which cellular processes underlie the
zinc-dependent recruitment of GluA2, we performed a sequential
dual-labeling experiment to monitor both lateral diffusion
and exocytosis with zinc treatment. Here, we used a recently
developed method to visualize native GluA2 using chemical
AMPAR modification (CAM2) reagents that allow for covalent
chemical labeling with a small fluorophore (Alexa fluors;
Wakayama et al., 2017). Control experiments were performed
to confirm the specificity and saturation binding of all surface
GluA2 for this dual-labeling experiment in our neuronal
culture system. Similar to the original study (Wakayama
et al., 2017), we found that 80%–90% of CAM2 puncta
colocalized with GluA2 staining, whereas there was limited
colocalization between CAM2 and GluA1 (data not shown).
We then next tested varying concentrations of CAM2 for
labeling and chose an excess concentration (3 µM) for
subsequent experiments to ensure saturated labeling of surface
GluA2.
In order to examine AMPAR dynamics with zinc, surface
GluA2 subunits were initially labeled with Alexa 647-CAM2 for
saturated labeling. Neurons were then treated with control or
ZnCl2 conditions, which could recruit receptors from outside
of the synapse and increase synaptic Alexa 647-CAM2 signal. If
exocytosis was enhanced with zinc treatment, these new surface
receptors would be labeled during the second labeling with Alexa
488-CAM2. Shank2 or Shank3 were also labeled as postsynaptic
markers and used to understand their roles in zinc-sensitive
AMPAR dynamics (Figure 9A).
To this end, we measured the fluorescence intensity in both
CAM2 channels at Shank-positive puncta. Using puncta-by-
puncta analysis (Friedman et al., 2000; Arons et al., 2012),
we found that both lateral diffusion and exocytosis were
involved with the zinc-dependent trafficking of GluA2 to
synaptic sites as measured by the increase of both A647-CAM2
(16.61%, p < 0.0001) and A488-CAM2 puncta intensity (14.1%,
p < 0.0001; Figures 9B–D and Supplementary Figure S5A).
The total puncta density was not affected by zinc application
(Supplementary Figure S5B), which agrees with the stable
mEPSCs frequency during zinc treatment (Figure 4F). The
relative rate between exocytosis and lateral diffusion was likely
not affected by zinc since there was no difference in the
slope of Alexa 647-CAM2 to Alexa 488-CAM2 (Supplementary
Figure S5C).
Next, to assess whether there is a direct correlation between
the amount of Shank2 or Shank3 and Alexa-labeled CAM2,
we measured the fluorescence intensity of Shank at each
individual puncta as well as the intensity of the CAM2 in
both channels. Fluorescence intensities of individual Alexa-
labeled CAM2 puncta were then plotted as a function of the
corresponding colocalized Shank2 or Shank3 puncta intensities,
and linear regression analysis applied for the individual synaptic
intensities (Figures 9E–H and Supplementary Figures S5D,E
O’Brien et al., 1998; Rumbaugh et al., 2003). Consistent
with previous results (Figures 8B,C), we found a significant
increase in the slope of A647-CAM2 intensity at Shank3-
positive puncta with zinc treatment (Figures 9E,G), which
means that for a given amount of Shank3 there is an
increase in A647-CAM2. This can serve as a proxy for the
increase in ratio of GluA2 to Shank3 through lateral diffusion
(A647-CAM2; 139.8%, p = 0.0001; Figure 9G) or through
exocytosis (A488-CAM2; 48.66%, p = 0.0186; Figure 9H). In
contrast, the correlation between Shank2 and GluA2 for both
processes was unchanged with zinc treatment (Figures 5G,H
and Supplementary Figures S5D,E), implying that Shank2 did
not directly influence the zinc-sensitive dynamics of GluA2.
Taken together, these results imply that: (1) both lateral
diffusion and exocytosis contributed to the GluA2 pool
recruited by zinc; and (2) Shank3 was involved in both
processes.
Characterization of Shank2 and
Shank3 Knockdown in Young Neurons
To understand if Shank2 or Shank3 are required for the
zinc-sensitive regulation of AMPAR structure and functions,
we employed shRNA to decrease the endogenous expression
of Shank2 or Shank3 in neurons (Figure 10). Multiple
shRNA constructs for Shank2 and Shank3 were designed
in a pZoff vector to target the various isoforms of each
protein (Supplementary Figures S6A,B and Supplementary
Tables S1, S2; Boeckers et al., 1999; Lim et al., 1999; Leal-
Ortiz et al., 2008). To assess their efficacy in neurons,

by 90.56% (p = 0.001; Figure 10D). The most effective
shRNA for Shank3 targeting the 3�UTR domain (shShk3; ∗ in
Supplementary Figure S6B) showed a significant decrease
in Shank3 puncta density (35.56%, p = 0.0372; Figure 10F)
and no change in intensity (Figure 10E), accompanied by
a 122.08% increase of Shank2 puncta intensity (p = 0.0233;
Figure 10C).
We next subcloned the two successful shRNAs described
above into a lentivirus vector to create LV/eGFP/shRNA
constructs (Supplementary Figure S6D) to ensure higher
infection efficiency and avoid any potential overexpression
artifacts associated with plasmid-based transfections. Lysates
of hippocampal neurons infected with lentiviruses at 100%
infectivity were harvested after 14 DIV and probed with
antibodies for Shank2 and Shank3 (Figures 10G,H and
Supplementary Figures S6E,F). With the shShk2, we observed
a dramatic loss of most major Shank2 isoforms (Figure 10I)
along with the reduction of the third longest isoform of
Shank3 (c: 58.98% Figure 10J). The effect of shShk2 on
Shank3 expression was similar to previous studies suggesting that
Shank2 might be necessary for recruiting synaptic Shank3 over
development (Grabrucker et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2017). On
the other hand, the shShk3 produced ∼50%–80% loss of the
three longest Shank3 isoforms (a: 70.05%, b: 80.01%, c: 53.6%;
Figure 10J), which are the major zinc-binding isoforms. This
shRNA also induced large increases of all Shank2 isoforms
(Figure 10I), suggesting that there might be a compensation of
Shank2 due to the loss of Shank3.

Shank2 led to a modest reduction of mEPSCs amplitude
as seen in the cumulative distribution (5.18%, p = 0.0072;

in Shank3 knockdown neurons had a faster rise time (9.6%,
p = 0.0032; Supplementary Figure S7B) and decay time (20.89%,
p < 0.0001; Figure 11B). The faster kinetics led to a reduction in
charge transferred by AMPAR in Shank3 knockdown neurons
(16%, p = 0.0004, Figure 11C). Taken together, these results
support that Shank3 is important for maintaining the kinetics,
and hence, synaptic efficacy of AMPAR synaptic response in
young neurons.
Zinc-Sensitive Regulation of AMPAR in
Young Neurons Is Dependent on
Shank2 and Shank3
Given that 10 µM zinc treatment led to increased incorporation
of GluA2 to Shank puncta (Figures 8, 9), we next asked
whether Shank expression is necessary for the zinc-sensitive
increase of AMPAR function. To address this question,
we recorded and compared AMPAR mEPSCs from shLuci,
shShk3 and shShk2 neurons at baseline and during zinc
treatment (Figure 11D). Neurons infected with shLuci preserved
their zinc-sensitivity with an increase in decay time (12.63%,
p = 0.0069) and peak amplitude (30.44%, p = 0.044; Figure 11E
and Supplementary Figure S7C). As a result, the charge
transferred by AMPARs in shLuci neurons was increased by zinc
treatment (16%, p < 0.0001; Figure 11F). The effects of zinc
on shLuci neurons are comparable to those on untransfected
neurons described in Figure 4 (p > 0.05).
In contrast, we observed no zinc-sensitive increase in either
decay time or charge with zinc addition in shShK3 neurons,
confirming that synaptic expression of Shank3 is necessary
for
the
zinc
recruitment
of
GluA2-containing
AMPARs
(Figures 11E,F). Instead of being potentiated by zinc treatment,
mEPSCs in Shank3 knockdown neurons displayed a decrease
in peak amplitude (37.42%, p = 0.012) and frequency (34.78%,
p = 0.035) upon zinc treatment (Supplementary Figures S7C,E).
This observation revealed a separate zinc-dependent modulation
of AMPAR activity, perhaps via the reduction of surface GluA1 as
described in Figure 7 from Shank synapses. Furthermore,
knockdown of Shank2 also abolished the zinc sensitivity
of AMPARs in all measures examined (decay time, charge,
amplitude and rise time; Figures 11E,F and Supplementary
Figures S7C–E). Together, these data revealed the necessity of
both Shank2 and Shank3 expression to zinc-induced potentiation
of AMPAR function.
DISCUSSION
The dynamic regulation of neurotransmitter receptor number
and composition is a fundamental mechanism underlying
synaptic plasticity, synaptic maturation and neural circuit
development (Henley et al., 2011; Bassani et al., 2013; Henley
and Wilkinson, 2016). This regulation is critical for the encoding
of information, cognition and behavior and is vulnerable
to genetic and environmental insults associated with ASD
(Shepherd and Huganir, 2007; Lee et al., 2016; Kim et al.,
2018). In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms
underlying zinc-dependent regulation of synaptic transmission
via the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins Shank2 and Shank3.
Our data reveal that young hippocampal neurons undergo
a zinc-dependent subunit switch of AMPAR from GluA2-
lacking to GluA2-containing receptors, which dictate their
biophysical properties. In addition, we found that Shank
proteins are key mediators of this regulation since they were
necessary for this zinc-induced enhancement of AMPARs.
Importantly, postsynaptic zinc, an activator of Shank2 and
Shank3, was found to increase transiently and reversibly
with neuronal depolarization, likely due to release of zinc
from presynaptic vesicles or postsynaptic sources. Upon
treatment with zinc, GluA2 was preferentially recruited into
synapses by both lateral diffusion and exocytosis with a
concomitant dispersion of GluA1. This occurred at pre-existing
Shank2 and Shank3 puncta in young neurons, converting
these
synapses
from
GluA2-lacking
to
GluA2-containing.
This zinc-stimulated subunit switch of surface GluA2 was
accompanied by an increase in amplitude, longer decay
time and reduced inward rectification of AMPAR-mediated
currents and was dependent on Shank2 and Shank3. In
summary, these results provide new insights into a cooperative
dynamic regulation of AMPAR composition driven by the
zinc signaling pathway via Shank2 and Shank3 at developing
synapses, a critical period for local control of AMPAR
composition.
Bimodal Action of Zinc on Shank2 and
Shank3 for Dynamic Regulation of AMPA
Receptors
During development and plasticity, GluA2 is a tightly regulated
subunit of glutamate receptors (Isaac et al., 2007). GluA2-
containing
AMPARs
at
synapses
are
controlled
through
a variety of mechanisms and significantly increase with
maturation (Pickard et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2002; Brill and
Huguenard, 2008; Mignogna et al., 2015). Here, we found
GluA2 was recruited to an increasing number of synapses in
dissociated hippocampal neurons, almost doubling during our
developmental window of interest (Figure 2). Shank3 likewise
increased in expression at individual synapses and number of
synapses in this same period with a particular recruitment to

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
mature synapses on dendritic spines (Figure 1). The SH3 domain
of Shank proteins binds to GRIP suggesting that Shank3 might
indirectly interact with and recruit GluA2 to synapses via the
APB/GRIP complex (Sheng and Kim, 2000). Functionally, the
knockdown of Shank3 has been shown to result in decreased
GluA2 expression and GluA2-mediated AMPAR properties,
such as reduced inward rectification (Bariselli et al., 2016; Mei
et al., 2016). In our current study, Shank3 knockdown resulted
in AMPAR mEPSCs with a faster decay time (Figure 11), which
supports the concept that Shank3 can promote synaptic clusters
of GluA2. Furthermore, Shank3 was shown to directly facilitate
GluA2-containing AMPAR activity since zinc preferentially
enhanced GluA2 at Shank3 puncta (Figure 8 and Table 1).
Both Shank2 and Shank3 appear to be necessary for the
zinc-induced enhancement of synaptic AMPARs since knocking
down either Shank3 or Shank2 eliminated the zinc effect. In
both cases, this is likely due to a reduction of Shank3 at
synapses (Figure 10), consistent with a recent study showing
Shank2 is necessary for recruitment of Shank3 (Shi et al.,
2017).
Clues to the mechanism for how Shank3 and zinc recruit
GluA2-containing AMPAR to synapses can be found in the
role of Shank3 in receptor trafficking (Okamoto et al., 2001;
Lu et al., 2007; Verpelli et al., 2011; Raynaud et al., 2013),
and zinc may be a key underlying driver. For example,
zinc could facilitate the interaction between Shank3 and the
Homer1b/dynamin-3 complex to tether the endocytic zone
in close proximity to the PSD. This would allow for more
rapid receptor recycling that could increase total surface GluA2
(Okamoto et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2007; Petrini et al., 2009).
Using CAM2 labeling, we showed that the magnitude of the
zinc-induced recruitment of GluA2 via lateral diffusion and
exocytosis was correlated to the amount of synaptic Shank3
(Figure 9). Additionally, we found that elevating zinc induced a
trafficking of GluA2 to Shank3-positive puncta from non-Shank3
sites (Figure 8 and Table 1). These functions are plausible,
especially considering the strong expression level of Shank3 in
dendrites and its known interaction with the cytoskeleton via
cortactin/actin binding (MacGillavry et al., 2016).
Since
zinc-mediated
recruitment
of
GluA2-containing
AMPAR to Shank synapses did not strongly affect amplitude
or frequency for AMPA mEPSCs, this implies that zinc might
concomitantly induce the dispersion/removal of other types of
synaptic AMPARs. Indeed, our data revealed that elevation of
zinc also induced a synaptic removal of GluA1 from Shank2-
positive synapses, indicating that GluA1 dispersion may be
mediated by Shank2 (Figures 8, 11). Consistent with this
concept, previous studies showed that Shank2 directly associates
and colocalizes with GluA1 and is critical for its synaptic
expression, particularly at nascent synapses (Pickard et al., 2000;
Uchino et al., 2006; Ha et al., 2016; Peter et al., 2016; Szíber
et al., 2017). These findings indicate that Shank2 may regulate
FIGURE 12 | A model for Shank mediation of zinc-dependent subunit switch of AMPAR in developing synapses. A glutamatergic synapse of a wild-type (WT) young
neuron is shown with low levels of Shank3 (green) and GluA2 (teal) and high levels of Shank2 (blue) and GluA1 (orange). The synaptic complement changes with
zinc-sensitive recruitment of synaptic GluA2 via exocytosis and lateral diffusion (blue arrows), leading to potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic activity. The
zinc-recruitment of GluA2 correlated with the level of synaptic Shank3. Zinc addition also led to reduction of synaptic GluA1, which is most likely driven by Shank2.
Hence, loss of either Shank2 or Shank3 abolished the zinc-sensitive potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission.

Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
the synaptic localization of GluA1. In support of this idea, our
data confirmed that Shank2 initially co-clustered with surface
GluA1 (Figure 8 and Table 1) and knockdown of Shank2 led
to reduction of AMPAR mEPSC amplitude (Supplementary
Figure S7) in young neurons, potentially indicative of fewer
GluA1
receptors.
Furthermore,
Shank2
overexpression,
a
condition induced by expressing shShk3, also resulted in
synapses with faster kinetics (Supplementary Figure S7B
and Figures 11B,C) perhaps via the increase recruitment of
GluA1 to Shank2 sites. In contrast, elevating zinc reduced
surface GluA1 puncta density. This could be due to increased
endocytosis and/or diffusion of GluA1 away from Shank2-
positive sites (Figure 8 and Table 1). In line with a role
of Shank2 and zinc in the synaptic removal of GluA1, our
data showed that the zinc-induced reduction of AMPAR
mEPSCs amplitude was prominent at synapses lacking Shank3
(Supplementary Figure S7C), a condition that creates synapses
dominated by Shank2 (Figure 10). This effect of zinc, however,
failed to occur in Shank2-lacking synapses (Supplementary
Figure S7C).
Several mechanisms could explain the effects of zinc on
downregulating GluA1 level at Shank2 sites. First, zinc binding
to the SAM domain could favor a new conformation of
Shank2 within the Shank scaffolding network or the complex
with other molecules, all of which could have lower affinity or
fewer docking sites for GluA1. This potential conformational
change of Shank2 might affect its interaction with dynamin-2
(Okamoto et al., 2001) to facilitate GluA1 internalization (Carroll
et al., 1999). Additionally, zinc could affect GluA1 synaptic
dispersion by regulating the PKA, PKC or CaMKII-dependent
phosphorylation
of
this
AMPAR
subunit
either
directly
(Noh et al., 2001) or via crosstalk with calcium signaling
(Hershfinkel et al., 2001; Takeda et al., 2008). Intriguingly,
reduced phosphorylation of GluA1 at sites S831 and S845 has
been reported in a Shank2 knockout mouse model (Won et al.,
2012), raising yet another possible mechanism for zinc to
regulate Shank2-dependent redistribution of GluA1.
In summary, the data presented in this study suggest a
model for how zinc and zinc-sensitive Shank proteins regulate
AMPAR function at developing synapses. Under basal conditions
in young neurons, Shank2 appears to promote the synaptic
localization and molecular anchoring of GluA1-containing
receptors. Elevating zinc near synapses, as occurs during
synaptic transmission, then exerts two effects: preferentially
recruiting GluA2 to Shank3 synapses through both lateral
diffusion and exocytosis, while simultanously promoting the
removal of GluA1 receptors from Shank2 complexes (Figure 12).
In this model, zinc interactions with Shank molecules may
offer a general mechanism to shape the biophysical properties
at developing glutamatergic synapses. While there are clear
differences in the effects of shShk2 and shShk3 on Shank2 and
Shank3 expression, both shRNAs induced changes in protein
levels of these molecules. Future studies should attempt to
parse the specific roles of Shank2 and Shank3 using strategies
that result in cleaner knockdown or knockout of each
protein.
Functional Implications of Zinc-Sensitive
Control of AMPAR Subunit Composition
Our results suggest that a major function of the synaptic
zinc-Shank
pathway
is
to
facilitate
synaptic
maturation.
Shank3 was found to be necessary for AMPAR maturation in
the ventral tegmental area (Bariselli et al., 2016). It is likely
that during development of hippocampal neurons, Shank2 and
Shank3 act as zinc-sensitive mediators to convert GluA2-lacking
to GluA2-containing AMPAR synapses. More specifically, our
data support the proposed model in which zinc could trigger
Shank3 to accumulate more GluA2-containing AMPAR and
act on Shank2 to remove GluA1-containing AMPAR over
time. Perturbations of this pathway specifically during the
prenatal period or early postnatal development have been
linked to delayed AMPAR maturation, circuit dysfunction and
behavioral deficits, further emphasizing the role of zinc-sensitive
Shank proteins and zinc in synapse maturation and for the
formation of associated brain circuits (Peça et al., 2011;
Grabrucker et al., 2014; Bariselli et al., 2016; Mei et al., 2016).
It is intriguing to speculate that other features of synaptic
maturation, such as the subunit switch of NMDAR, might
also be mediated by zinc and zinc-sensitive Shank proteins
and that these processes might be shared mechanisms for
synaptic development in pyramidal neurons of other brain
areas. In order to directly understand whether zinc signaling
mediates synaptic maturation, future studies could focus
on revealing the effect of chronic chelation of zinc in the
transition period from young to mature neurons during the
development of synapses. However, a major challenge of such
an approach is to select the appropriate zinc chelator that
does not severely impair neuronal health, synapse stabilization
or synaptic localization of Shank2 and Shank3 (Grabrucker
et al., 2011; Arons et al., 2016). Moreover, since the source
of zinc to activate Shank2 and Shank3 could be from either
presynaptic vesicles or postsynaptic stores, both extracellular
and intracellular zinc chelators should be considered to
selectively chelate presynaptic- or postsynaptic-released zinc,
respectively (Besser et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2011; Grabrucker
et al., 2014).
The loss of AMPAR zinc-sensitivity in mature neurons
(Figure 6) might be regulated by a variety of mechanisms. During
early stages of development, the size of the synapse, and the
number and composition of receptors with their complement
of proteins are plastic (Craig et al., 1993; Rao et al., 1998;
Boeckers et al., 1999; Kumar et al., 2002; Grabrucker et al., 2011;
Valnegri et al., 2011). In the presence of zinc and zinc-sensitive
Shank molecules, synapses are more dynamic and less stable
(Grabrucker et al., 2011; Arons et al., 2012, 2016). Additionally,
young synapses could have more available docking sites to
accommodate zinc-induced recruitment of GluA2-containing
receptors (Czöndör et al., 2012). Over development, the increase
of Shank1 at synapses (Grabrucker et al., 2011) and the loss
of zinc-sensitive recruitment of molecules may synergistically
create a more stable/less plastic state. Also, a reduction in the
diffusion rate of AMPAR could hinder zinc-sensitive recruitment
of AMPAR via lateral diffusion in mature neurons (Groc et al.,
Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

November 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 405
 Ha et al.
Shank-Dependent Zinc Regulation of AMPAR
2006; Czöndör et al., 2012). Another possibility is that the high
content of GluA2 in mature neurons (Figure 2) could result in
the reduction of AMPAR zinc sensitivity (Figure 5D) by affecting
zinc entry (Jia et al., 2002; Takeda et al., 2007). However, we
found that intracellular zinc levels of neurons at different DIV
(11–30) were similarly responsive to exogenous manipulations
(Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting that the availability of
zinc is not a limiting factor for mature neurons to respond to
treatment. The mechanism shown here could allow for a means
to downregulate AMPAR calcium signaling as seen in mature
neurons. Considering that mature neurons can uptake zinc, it is
possible a smaller subpopulation of synapses in mature neurons
could undergo the AMPAR subunit switch dependent on their
experience (Mattison et al., 2014). Furthermore, mature neurons
may have other zinc-sensitive processes that play alternate roles
in neuronal function, such as plasticity.
Does
the
zinc-sensitive
dynamic
control
of
AMPAR
composition
operate
during
plasticity?
While
zinc
and
zinc-sensitive Shank proteins may act together to regulate
maturation of synapses, it is also reasonable to consider
that they may additionally function to modulate AMPAR
subunit composition during synaptic plasticity, e.g., during
the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation
(LTP). More specifically, activity-dependent accumulation of
postsynaptic zinc might activate Shank2 and Shank3 to replace
GluA1-containing AMPARs with GluA2-containing receptors
(Shi et al., 2001; Alberi et al., 2005). This AMPAR subunit switch
mechanism might also enable synaptic long-term depression
(LTD), especially at newly unsilenced synapses (Zhou et al.,
2011; Selcher et al., 2012). Hence, the differential zinc sensitivity
of synapses could allow them to be dynamically remodeled
during Hebbian plasticity. Conversely, dysfunction of this
pathway could contribute to the synaptic plasticity deficits seen
in multiple Shank knockdown or zinc-deficient models (Lu et al.,
2000; Jiang et al., 2011; Verpelli et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011,
2016; Jaramillo et al., 2016). In another aspect of plasticity, a
bidirectional model for synaptic scaling has emerged in which
scaling up is dependent on increased synaptic accumulation of
GluA2-containing receptors (Gainey et al., 2009; Anggono et al.,
2011; Tatavarty et al., 2013; Ancona Esselmann et al., 2017).
During synaptic scaling up due to chronic activity deprivation,
one trafficking mechanism was shown in which GRIP was
recruited to synaptic sites where it enhanced trafficking and/or
stabilization of GluA2 (Gainey et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015).
Since Shank proteins have been reported to bind to GRIP and
therefore could complex with GluA2 through the APB/GRIP
(Sheng and Kim, 2000; Uemura et al., 2004), the zinc-sensitive
dynamic regulation of AMPAR at developing synapses may
converge in this same pathway. In general, this zinc-sensitive
regulation of AMPAR could play roles to modulate receptor
compositions and synaptic strength.
Zinc, Zinc-Sensitive Shank Proteins and
Autism Spectrum Disorders
Our study revealed a novel zinc/Shank-dependent molecular
pathway for regulating AMPAR subunit switching that could
affect the formation, maturation and plasticity of excitatory
synapses.
Consistently,
alterations
of
AMPAR
subunit
compositions and/or synaptic recruitment have been seen
in multiple Shank2 and Shank3 mouse KO models of ASDs
(Ramanathan et al., 2004; Mejias et al., 2011; Hayashi et al.,
2013; Mignogna et al., 2015; Bariselli et al., 2016; Chanda
et al., 2016; Wegener et al., 2017). Our findings also offer a
novel mechanism for understanding how zinc deficiency or
disrupted zinc dynamics might be linked to individuals with
ASDs (Yasuda et al., 2011; Grabrucker et al., 2014; Curtin
et al., 2018). Specifically, we anticipate that zinc deficiency
during early brain development could disrupt Shank functions
(Grabrucker et al., 2011; Grabrucker, 2014), the composition
of synaptic AMPAR and ultimately synaptic plasticity, network
formation and behavior. With shared molecular deficits to Shank
knockout mice, zinc deficiency could result in similar circuit
and behavioral deficits broadly in a number of relevant animal
models (Halas and Sandstead, 1975; Sandstead et al., 1978; Lu
et al., 2000; Grabrucker et al., 2014; Hagmeyer et al., 2015).
Taken together, our study adds to the current understanding of
how Shank2 and Shank3 regulate multiple aspects of synaptic
functions during development and plasticity. These results
also indicate that genetic mutations and environmental insults
might predispose individuals to ASDs by impairing this
process. This realization might help improve future diagnostics
and development of effective pharmacotherapies for ASDs
(Grabrucker et al., 2014; Lee J. et al., 2015; Bariselli et al., 2016;
Hagmeyer et al., 2018).
