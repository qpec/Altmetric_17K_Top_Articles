Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that emerged recently
as a global health threat, causing a pandemic in the Americas. ZIKV
infection mostly causes mild disease, but is linked to devastating
congenital birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The
high level of cross-reactivity among flaviviruses and their cocircula-
tion has complicated serological approaches to differentially detect
ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) infections, accentuating the urgent
need for a specific and sensitive serological test. We previously gen-
erated a ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-specific human monoclo-
nal antibody, which we used to develop an NS1-based competition
ELISA. Well-characterized samples from RT-PCR-confirmed patients
with Zika and individuals exposed to other flavivirus infections or
vaccination were used in a comprehensive analysis to determine the
sensitivity and specificity of the NS1 blockade-of-binding (BOB) as-
say, which was established in laboratories in five countries (Nicara-
gua, Brazil, Italy, United Kingdom, and Switzerland). Of 158 sera/
plasma from RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infections, 145 (91.8%) yielded
greater than 50% inhibition. Of 171 patients with primary or second-
ary DENV infections, 152 (88.9%) scored negative. When the control
group was extended to patients infected by other flaviviruses, other
viruses, or healthy donors (n = 540), the specificity was 95.9%. We
also analyzed longitudinal samples from DENV-immune and DENV-
naive ZIKV infections and found inhibition was achieved within 10 d
postonset of illness and maintained over time. Thus, the Zika NS1
BOB assay is sensitive, specific, robust, simple, low-cost, and acces-
sible, and can detect recent and past ZIKV infections for surveillance,
seroprevalence studies, and intervention trials.

Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is spread via
the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes or by sexual transmission
and is responsible for the explosive 2015–2017 epidemic in the
Americas. ZIKV infection during pregnancy is linked to devastating
birth defects and associated anomalies, designated congenital Zika
syndrome (1, 2), whereas in adults, ZIKV infection has been associ-
ated with Guillain Barré syndrome (3). Flaviviruses are enveloped
RNA viruses containing an ∼11-kb positive-stranded RNA genome
that encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Cells
infected by flaviviruses secrete nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which
has multiple roles in immune evasion and pathogenesis (4, 5).
Antibody responses generated in response to flavivirus infec-
tions are notoriously cross-reactive, representing a significant ob-
stacle for the specific diagnosis of infection using serological
assays. Multiple RT-PCR-based assays for the detection of ZIKV
RNA are available, but their use is limited to the narrow window
when viral RNA is detectable in body fluids. This is highly variable
among patients and subject to reporting error, as symptoms are
mild, and thus patients may take less notice of the day of onset,
but in most cases, it is up to 7 d in serum, up to 14 d in urine, and
more than 20 d in semen (6, 7). Conventional ELISAs using tra-
ditional viral antigen have been found to poorly differentiate
among flavivirus infections (8, 9). This is especially problematic
with antibodies to ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV), which
cocirculate in the Americas. Neutralization assays can measure
virus-specific neutralizing antibodies; however, specificity is affected
by the production of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, especially
after multiple DENV infections and at early times postinfection (9–
11). The lack of accurate serologic methods for identification of
ZIKV infection has made it very challenging to determine the bur-
den and rate of asymptomatic infections, define the incidence of
congenital Zika syndrome among infected women, and identify
neurologic complications associated with ZIKV infection.
In previous studies (10, 12), we identified NS1-reactive mono-
clonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from ZIKV- and DENV-infected
Significance
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus with homology to
dengue virus (DENV), has become a public health threat, partic-
ularly because of its association with severe congenital birth
defects. The high level of cross-reactivity among flaviviruses and
their cocirculation has complicated serological approaches to
detect ZIKV infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for a specific
serological assay to discriminate ZIKV infection from other flavi-
viruses. This study demonstrates that the antibody-based assay
we developed and implemented in five countries has high spec-
ificity and sensitivity in the detection of recent and past ZIKV
infections. The ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) blockade-of-
binding ELISA assay is a simple, robust, and low-cost solution
for Zika surveillance programs, seroprevalence studies, and in-
tervention trials in flavivirus-endemic areas.

 individuals. The analysis of their cross-reactivity revealed that most
of the mAbs induced in subjects exposed to DENV or ZIKV only
were virus-specific. Conversely, numerous mAbs isolated from
DENV-immune ZIKV-infected donors cross-reacted with both
ZIKV and DENV NS1 antigens. Antibody competition studies
identified two sites on NS1 that were recognized by ZIKV-specific
mAbs and not competed by cross-reactive antibodies (10). One of
these mAbs, designated ZKA35 and directed to site S2 on NS1, was
used as a probe to develop the serological NS1 blockade-of-binding
(BOB) assay described in this study. Here, we established the NS1
BOB ELISA in laboratories in five countries, including Nicaragua
and Brazil during the Zika epidemic, and tested a large number of
well-characterized samples from RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infec-
tions, primary and secondary DENV infections, individuals with
other flavivirus and other virus infections or vaccinations, and
healthy control patients in a comprehensive study to demonstrate
the high sensitivity and specificity of the assay and its robust
implementation in multiple countries.
Results
Anti-NS1 Antibody Cross-Reactivity Among Different Flaviviruses.
Initially, to assess serum reactivity to NS1, plasma from ZIKV-
immune (n = 18) and DENV-immune (n = 44) returned travelers,
as well as healthy Swiss blood donors (n = 30), was tested by
ELISA for binding of IgG antibodies to solid-phase NS1 from
different flaviviruses. Eighteen ZIKV-immune plasma samples,
including 3 DENV-naive samples, 4 DENV-immune samples, and
11 samples with unknown prior DENV exposure history, were
tested at a fixed dilution of 1:100 against NS1 antigen from ZIKV,
DENV1-4, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV)
(Fig. 1A). All ZIKV-immune plasma samples recognized ZIKV
NS1. Of note, the four plasma samples from DENV-immune do-
nors all cross-reacted with DENV1-4 and WNV NS1, whereas the
three samples from DENV-naive subjects showed weak to no
cross-reactivity. Samples from patients with unknown DENV-
immune status were for the most part specific for ZIKV NS1.
Similarly, plasma samples from ZIKV-naive DENV-immune do-
nors (including secondary DENV infections) were tested for IgG
reactivity against flavivirus NS1 (Fig. 1B). Notably, a large fraction
of these samples (i.e., 36–40%; cutoff, 1.5 OD) cross-reacted with
ZIKV, WNV, and YFV NS1. None of the plasma samples from
the healthy donors demonstrated reactivity against NS1 from dif-
ferent flaviviruses (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate
that the cross-reactivity of anti-NS1 IgG antibodies induced by
ZIKV and DENV infections represents an obstacle to the use of
ELISA methods based solely on the binding of total IgG antibodies
to solid-phase NS1 for development of flavivirus-specific serologi-
cal assays. We therefore considered it likely that a competitive
assay format, using labeled ZIKV-specific antibodies, would im-
prove the specificity.
Analysis of Nicaraguan Samples. To resolve the issue of cross-
reactive anti-NS1 antibodies, we took advantage of a human
ZIKV-specific anti-NS1 mAb (ZKA35) we had previously gener-
ated and characterized from a recovered ZIKV-infected individual
(10). We labeled this mAb with biotin and used it in an ELISA
based on solid-phase ZIKV NS1. In this assay, plasma or serum
samples are diluted (1:10) and incubated on ZIKV NS1-coated
plates, followed by the addition of the biotinylated ZKA35 mAb,
which detects the presence of ZIKV-specific serum antibodies
capable of inhibiting its binding to ZIKV NS1. To evaluate the
sensitivity and specificity of this NS1 BOB assay, we tested a large
collection of longitudinal samples derived from multiple studies of
Zika and dengue in Nicaragua (Table 1). A total of 112 and
146 samples from the latest times available from subjects diagnosed
by RT-PCR for ZIKV or DENV infection, respectively, were used
to perform a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to
identify the cutoff giving optimum sensitivity and specificity in the
NS1 BOB ELISA. The ROC analysis established 50% as the most
effective cutoff value for ZKA35 binding inhibition (Fig. 2 A–C);
that cutoff was therefore used throughout this study. Of the ZIKV
panel, 37 and 38 subjects from the Nicaraguan Pediatric Dengue
Cohort Study (PDCS) (13, 14) were defined as previously DENV-
naive or DENV-immune, respectively, whereas DENV-immune
status in 37 subjects from the Nicaraguan national surveillance
system was not known. Testing of the samples collected at least
10 d after symptom onset in the NS1 BOB assay indicated that 100 of
112 samples scored positive (89.3%) (Fig. 2 D–G). In this dataset, we
did not observe a significantly different rate of positivity in the NS1

 BOB assay in samples between DENV-naive and DENV-immune
patients. The kinetics of the NS1 BOB assay results indicated that
antibodies inhibiting the binding of the ZKA35 mAb probe per-
sisted for more than 5 mo after ZIKV infection.
The specificity of the NS1 BOB assay in DENV-immune sam-
ples was further investigated by separately analyzing longitudinal
samples from primary versus secondary DENV infections strati-
fied by serotype. A total of 75 samples from 58 subjects diagnosed
as primary DENV1, DENV2, or DENV3 infections by RT-PCR
during 2010–2014 (before the introduction of ZIKV into Nicaragua)
were analyzed; none of these samples scored positive (Fig. 2 H, J,
and K). Similarly, 99 samples from 87 subjects diagnosed as sec-
ondary DENV1, DENV2, or DENV3 infections by RT-PCR from
2005 to 2016 were evaluated. In 17 of 86 secondary DENV infec-
tions, the NS1 BOB assay scored positive (Fig. 2 I–K). These results
indicate that the ZIKV NS1 BOB assay is highly specific in patients
with primary DENV and in the great majority (about four of five) of
patients who experienced secondary DENV infections.
Analysis of Brazilian Samples. To further evaluate the performance
and robustness of the NS1 BOB assay, we transferred the assay to
the Flavivirus Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz)
in Rio de Janeiro and tested a panel of samples from 58 ZIKV-
infected patients from Brazil collected between 2 and 53 d after
symptom onset (Table 1). In most cases, multiple samples were
collected from each patient. Twenty-nine of 31 samples (93.5%)
collected more than 10 d after symptom onset scored positive in the
NS1 BOB assay. In addition, 35 (41.2%) of 85 samples collected less
than 10 d after symptom onset scored positive (Fig. 3 A and B), a
result that might be related to an early production of NS1-reactive
antibodies or to an inhibitory effect by circulating NS1. In parallel,
we tested serum samples collected between 2002 and 2013 (before
ZIKV introduction into Brazil) from 82 patients diagnosed with
acute DENV infection by RT-PCR. Of these, only four samples
scored positive (specificity of 95.1%). In addition, 62 samples col-
lected from 2000 to 2014 from patients diagnosed with infection with
measles virus, hepatitis B virus, human cytomegalovirus, rubella vi-
rus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E viruses, as well as YFV vaccinees,
were also tested using the NS1 BOB assay, and all scored negative.
These results confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of the
NS1 BOB assay on a distinct group of patients and also demonstrate
that the assay is sufficiently robust to be successfully established in
different laboratories in multiple countries and in populations en-
demic to many flaviviruses.
Analysis of Samples from European Travelers and Residents. To as-
sess the efficacy of the assay on samples from travelers returning
from areas at risk for ZIKV infection, we tested plasma samples
from 23 travelers in the United Kingdom and Italy who were con-
firmed by RT-PCR to have been infected with ZIKV; in most of
these cases, the DENV immune status was not known. Of note,
several plasma samples were collected more than 200 d after
symptom onset (in one case, 753 d afterward). Twenty-one (95.5%)
of 22 samples collected more than 10 d after symptom onset scored
positive for ZIKV in the BOB ELISA (Fig. 4 A and B). To further
assess the specificity of the ZIKV NS1 BOB assay, we tested a large
set of samples obtained from patients infected with DENV, WNV,
or chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Thirty-one (96.9%) of 32 samples
from patients with WNV collected more than 10 d after symptom
onset scored negative. Of note, the only positive was obtained from a
sample collected in 2016. Two of 27 samples from patients with
DENV collected more than 10 d after symptom onset scored posi-
tive, and similar to what was observed with Nicaraguan DENV
samples, the two positive samples were derived from secondary
DENV infections. In addition, none of the samples from patients
with chikungunya or YFV vaccinees scored positive. We also tested
a large number of plasma samples from Swiss blood donors (n =
116) collected between 2010 and 2016, as well as other samples
derived from healthy pregnant women who underwent antenatal
screening for HIV-1 in 2010 and 2015 (n = 102) and convalescent
samples collected at least 14 d after illness from returning travelers
who had been tested for leptospirosis (n = 39) as a result of un-
diagnosed systemic illness. Only two samples from this wider set of
samples from healthy adults (blood donors and pregnant women) or
UK individuals with undiagnosed systemic illness after travel (n =
257) scored positive; of note, these two samples were collected in
2015 and 2016, a period in which it is not possible to exclude a real
exposure to ZIKV infection. Once more, the results obtained

 confirmed and strengthened the high sensitivity and specificity of
the NS1 BOB ELISA.
Sensitivity and Specificity of the NS1 BOB ELISA. To assess the degree
of sensitivity and specificity of the NS1 BOB ELISA, we analyzed
one sample from each patient (the latest available) and evaluated
the frequency of patients developing an inhibitory antibody re-
sponse. Because in the analysis of longitudinal samples shown in
Figs. 2 and 3, we observed that the development of “inhibitory”
antibodies required a time window of more than 10 days; here we
excluded samples collected 10 d or less after symptom onset. In
total, we analyzed samples from 158 patients with Zika from
Nicaragua, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Italy, and found that
when the time cutoff was set at >10 d after symptom onset, the
sensitivity was 91.8% (i.e., 145 of 158 positive; Fig. 5 A and B).
When the cutoff was changed to ≥20 d after symptom onset, the
sensitivity increased to 95.0%, and it remained at similar levels
when the cutoff was further raised to ≥50 or ≥100 d after symptom
onset (94.3% and 95.0%, respectively). Notably, in 96 of 158 sam-
ples, the percentage of BOB inhibition was above 70%, indicating
that a high level of inhibitory antibodies is elicited by ZIKV in-
fection. The analysis of the assay specificity was initially focused on
samples from patients diagnosed for DENV infection between
2005 and 2014. Here we analyzed samples from 171 patients from
Nicaragua and Italy >10 d postonset of symptoms and found a
specificity of 88.9% (i.e., 152 of 171 samples scored negative). Of
the 19 samples that scored positive, all were derived from patients
with secondary DENV (mainly from secondary DENV2 and DENV3
infections). When the same analysis was restricted to samples col-
lected from secondary DENV cases, we found that in 19 of 97 pa-
tients, the assay scored positive, yielding a specificity of 80.4%.
Conversely, when the analysis was extended to all 257 patients in-
fected (or vaccinated, in the case of YFV) with any flavivirus (i.e.,
DENV, WNV, or YFV), the specificity increased to 91.9% (i.e.,
227 of 247 samples scored negative), and when it was further extended
to all 540 control subjects used in this study, including blood donors,
pregnant women, and samples from returned travelers, the specificity
increased to 95.9% (i.e., 518 of 540 samples scored negative).
Discussion
The serological detection of ZIKV infections is challenging be-
cause of the high degree of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses.
Indeed, some have raised the possibility of considering ZIKV as a
fifth member of the DENV serocomplex (15). A specific sero-
logical assay for detection of anti-ZIKV antibodies is urgently
needed for surveillance of both Zika and dengue, age-stratified
serosurveys, and studies investigating the association of ZIKV with
congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
In this study, we initially found that measuring the binding of
total IgG to solid-phase ZIKV NS1 did not enable significant
discrimination of samples from patients with Zika and dengue, in
that a large number of samples (i.e., ∼40%) from DENV-immune
patients, collected during a period in which ZIKV exposure could
be excluded, scored as positive in a direct ZIKV NS1-based
ELISA. These results are consistent with our previous finding
(10) that NS1-reactive monoclonal IgG antibodies isolated from
patients with ZIKV and DENV can be cross-reactive. In partic-
ular, we found that more than 50% of the mAbs derived from
patients with Zika who had been previously exposed to DENV
were cross-reactive with DENV (in most cases with DENV1,
DENV2, and DENV3, although this might be a reflection of the
infection history of the donors), as predicted by the original an-
tigenic sin theory in a recall response (16, 17). These results in-
dicate that measuring the binding of IgG antibodies to ZIKV
NS1 in an indirect ELISA format (18) results in low specificity.
Here, we evaluated an ELISA on the basis of the use of
recombinant ZIKV NS1 protein as a solid-phase antigen and a la-
beled mAb (ZKA35) as probe, which was selected for its specificity
to a site on ZIKV NS1 not targeted by cross-reactive antibodies.
ZKA35 does not bind to heat-denatured NS1 (Fig. S1A), and thus
likely targets a discontinuous or conformational epitope displayed on
the surface of ZIKV NS1. Because ZKA35 mAb was isolated from
an individual infected with ZIKV on a trip to Guatemala and El
Salvador in November 2015 (19), it is plausible this antibody was
elicited by NS1 antigen from an American ZIKV strain. However, it
binds equally well to recombinant NS1 from a 2016 Suriname ZIKV
strain, as well as from the prototype Ugandan strain MR766 (Fig.
S1B). In addition, we found that ZKA35 reacts by flow cytometry with
cells infected with the Asian ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (Fig. S1C). Taken
together, these data indicate that ZKA35 binds to a site on NS1
(defined as S2 in ref. 10) that is highly conserved in multiple ZIKV
lineages, but that is not homologous in sequence and structure with the
corresponding site on NS1 of other flaviviruses. Additional studies will
be required to map in more detail the epitope of the ZKA35 mAb.
The NS1 BOB assay was developed as a BOB assay and mea-
sures the presence of serum antibodies capable of preventing the
binding of the labeled mAb probe to solid-phase ZIKV NS1. Im-
portantly, the NS1 BOB assay is robust and was easily transferred to
multiple laboratories in Latin America and Europe. We have not
determined the subclass of antibodies able to block the binding of
the ZKA35 mAb. However, we cannot exclude that both IgM and
IgG could be responsible for the observed inhibition, particularly in
samples taken early after the onset of illness. Additional studies,
such as IgG or IgM depletion, could be explored to assess whether

 IgM antibodies also contribute to the initial inhibition. Further-
more, in an acute setting, we cannot rule out that high levels of
circulating ZIKV NS1 could also contribute to the inhibitory signal.
Indeed, we have observed that in the NS1 BOB assay, the addition
of exogenous soluble ZIKV NS1 (above 1 μg/mL) resulted in an
inhibition of ZKA35 binding to solid-phase ZIKV NS1 (Fig. S2).
This mechanism of inhibition could explain some of the positive
results observed in samples from Brazilian patients collected less
than 10 d after symptom onset (Fig. 3 A and B).
The sensitivity of the NS1 BOB assay was found to be ∼92%,
and 10 of the 15 samples that scored as negative had a per-
centage of inhibition greater than 40%, suggesting sensitivity
could be increased by further optimizing the assay conditions.
Furthermore, 11 of the 15 negative ZIKV samples were collected
less than 20 d postsymptom onset, and indeed, when only sam-
ples collected more than or equal to 20 d after symptom onset
were considered, the sensitivity increased to 95%. Importantly,
we found that antibodies blocking the binding of ZKA35 probe
persisted over time without a trend for a clear decline, at least in
the time window analyzed (i.e., up to 753 d after symptom onset).
The specificity of the NS1 BOB assay was found to range from
80.4% to 95.9%, depending on the control groups analyzed. Im-
portantly, exposure to YFV vaccine or primary DENV infection did
not result in any false-positive samples. Most of the samples scoring
as false-positives (i.e., 19 of 22) were among the secondary DENV
samples. Of note, the three positives from non-DENV samples were
collected in 2015–2016 from patients who might have had a history
of previous asymptomatic ZIKV infection. These results indicate
that in a fraction (about 1 in 5) of patients with secondary DENV,
cross-reactive antibodies targeting the ZKA35 site or neighboring
sites on ZIKV NS1 are elicited by multiple exposures to DENV
NS1 from different serotypes. It will be interesting to determine
whether a given combination of sequential infections with different
DENV serotypes is primarily responsible for eliciting cross-reactive
antibodies able to block ZKA35 mAb binding to ZIKV NS1. ZIKV
and DENV1-4 NS1 share homology in protein sequence of about
51–53%, whereas within DENV serotypes, DENV1 and DENV3
NS1 share homology at the amino acid level of about 81%, and
DENV2 homology to DENV1 and DENV3 is considerably lower
(i.e., 73% and 74%, respectively). DENV4 is equally distant from
the other 3 serotypes (i.e., 71–75%). It will be interesting to
understand whether sequential infection with more distant DENV
serotypes is more likely to elicit antibodies able to inhibit ZKA35
binding to ZIKV NS1. Finally, it would be useful to isolate cross-
reactive mAbs from patients with secondary DENV and map their
fine specificity on ZIKV NS1. This could enable mutation of ZIKV
NS1 to rationally knock out their epitopes with the goal of further
increasing the specificity of the NS1 BOB assay.
The strengths of this study include the very well characterized
samples from the cohort studies in Nicaragua that enabled distinction
between DENV-naive and DENV-exposed ZIKV-infected patients,
as well as samples from DENV infections stratified by serotype and
immune status. Furthermore, acute, convalescent, and longitudinal
samples from the same patients allowed careful kinetic analyses to be
performed. This unique sample set was essential for providing time-
matched comparisons of ZIKV infections versus DENV infections of
different serotypes. One limitation of this study is that we could not
test samples from subjects convalescent from DENV4 infections, as a
result of the absence of DENV4 in our sample set.
Initial calculations estimate the cost per well in reagents and
materials as approximately US$0.25; furthermore, the assay is
based on an ELISA platform, which is widely available throughout
the world. Thus, the NS1 BOB assay represents a broadly acces-
sible, low-cost solution. Other important features of the NS1 BOB
assay are its simplicity, its single-assay format, and its requirement
for only one dilution of the samples compared with other tests
requiring several dilutions and/or more complex and lengthy
procedures (such as neutralization tests or Luminex-based assays).
Additional studies are ongoing to further simplify the ZIKV NS1
BOB assay protocol, including direct conjugation of the ZKA35 to
peroxidase and the development of a lateral flow format. A similar
BOB approach using other available mAbs reacting specifically with
DENV1-4 NS1 antigen (such as DV54, described in ref. 12) could
also be developed to identify previous DENV infections and to
define the DENV-immune status of ZIKV-infected patients.
In conclusion, in response to the urgent need to develop a
serological assay capable of distinguishing between ZIKV and
DENV infections, we performed an extensive analysis of a large
panel of well-characterized clinical samples derived both from trav-
elers and from patients living in areas with a high level of exposure to
ZIKV and endemic for other flaviviruses. Using this unique panel of
samples from relevant populations, we have demonstrated the
high sensitivity and specificity of a low-cost, accessible ZIKV
NS1 serological assay. The NS1 BOB assay is thus a timely solution
for Zika surveillance, seroprevalence studies, and intervention trials.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Participants.
Samples from Nicaragua. A total of 75 children RT-PCR-positive for ZIKV who
experienced signs and symptoms of Zika between January 18 and September
20, 2016, from the Nicaraguan Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) were
included. The PDCS is a community-based prospective study of children 2–14 y
of age that has been ongoing since August 2004 in Managua, Nicaragua
(13). All Zika suspected cases were confirmed by RT-PCR in serum and/or
urine, using triplex assays that simultaneously screen for DENV and CHIKV
infections [ZCD assay (20), CDC Trioplex (21), or in some cases the CDC ZIKV
monoplex assay (8), in parallel with a DENV-CHIKV multiplex assay (22)]. As
a control group, a total of 146 patients with dengue confirmed by RT-PCR
(23, 24) between 2005 and 2013 were included, of whom 115 (41 primary
cases and 74 secondary cases) belonged to the PDCS and 31 (18 primary cases
and 13 secondary cases) were participants in the Nicaraguan Hospital-based
Dengue Hospital at the National Pediatric Reference Hospital in Nicaragua
(25), which has been ongoing since 1998. The PDCS and the Dengue
Hospital-based study were approved by the institutional review boards of
the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and the University of California, Berkeley.
Parents or legal guardians of all subjects provided written informed consent,
and subjects ≥6 y old provided assent. Full details are provided in the SI

Samples from Brazil. Samples from Brazilian patients used in this study were
referred for routine diagnostics to the Flavivirus, Influenza, and Hepatitis
reference laboratories at the Institute Oswaldo Cruz (IOC), Fiocruz-Rio de
Janeiro (Table 1). ZIKV-positive patients (n = 58) were confirmed by RT-PCR, as
previously described (8), and paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum

Analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of the BOB NS1 ELISA.
(A) The values of BOB inhibition in samples from subjects diagnosed with
ZIKV or DENV infection by RT-PCR are shown. The DENV group consists of
samples from primary and secondary DENV cases from Nicaragua and Italy.
The control group identified as “all” comprises DENV samples as well as
samples from patients infected (or vaccinated) with other flaviviruses (i.e.,
WNV and YFV) or with CHIKV, samples from patients with other illnesses and
samples from healthy blood donors. (B) Sensitivity calculated on the basis of
different time-point cutoff values, and specificity calculated using different
control groups. The flaviviruses group comprises samples from DENV and
WNV cases and YFV vaccinees. The control group identified as “+ other ill-
nesses” comprises the samples from the flavivirus group, as well as samples
with CHIKV and other illnesses (Brazilian samples collected before 2014).

 samples were collected during 2015 and 2016 (n = 116). Samples with con-
firmed DENV, measles, rubella, and other infections (PCR- and/or IgM-positive
sera) or YFV vaccination were collected in or before 2013 to exclude ZIKV
exposure, which is estimated to have arrived in Rio de Janeiro in January 2015.
These samples belong to a previously gathered collection from the Laboratory
of Flavivirus, IOC/Fiocruz approved by resolution number CSN196/96 from the
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Ethical Committee in Research (CEP 274/05), Min-
istry of Health, Brazil. Samples were received for routine diagnostics as part of
the reference work of the laboratory. The ethics approval from the committee
includes further studies using these samples for improvement of the diagnostic
assays without needing informed consent of these patients.
Samples from Italy. The diagnostic assessment for DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV, WNV and
YFV included the following: detection of anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies in
serum samples, detection of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies, identification of
CHIKV IgM and IgG using specific immunofluorescence tests, detection of WNV
IgM and IgG using specific tests, and detection of YFV IgM and IgG with anti-
YFV immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Serology results were confirmed by
specific virus neutralization assays (26). Detection of DENV RNA, ZIKV RNA, and
WNV RNA in plasma and urine samples was performed using a pan-flavivirus
heminested RT-PCR assay targeting a conserved region of the NS5 gene (27), as
well as virus-specific real-time RT-PCR tests. This retrospective analysis was
performed according to guidelines of the institutional review board of the
Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo on the use of biologic specimens for
scientific purpose, in keeping with Italian law (art.13 D.Lgs 196/2003). In-
formed consent was not necessary because patients with suspected arbovirus
infections were included in a regional diagnostic protocol. Full details are
provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Samples from the United Kingdom. Samples from UK patients used in this study
included the following: a cohort of Zika-positive returning travelers undergoing
long-term follow up, anonymized residual samples from antenatal screening of
healthy pregnant women, and residual convalescent sera from individuals with
systemic illness who tested negative for leptospirosis. Postinfection sera from
Zika-infected UK blood donors were collected with full informed consent in
accordance with and as required by the National Health Service Blood Trans-
fusion Service, England. Sera remaining after antenatal screening of healthy
pregnant women or testing of returning UK travelers for leptospirosis were
used anonymously, in accordance with Royal College Pathologists guidelines.
Production and Labeling of the ZKA35 mAb Probe. The VH and VL sequences of
ZKA35 human mAb were cloned into human Igγ1 and Igκ expression vectors
(28), and recombinant ZKA35 mAb was produced by transient transfection
of EXPI293 cells (Invitrogen), essentially as previously described (28). Full
details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
NS1 Blockade-of-Binding Assay. Polystyrene plates were coated overnight with
1 μg/mL ZIKV and blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 1% BSA. Plasma or
serum (1:10 dilution) were added to NS1-coated ELISA plates. After 1 h, an
equal volume of biotinylated anti-NS1 ZKA35 was added, and the mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Plates were washed, and alkaline-
phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin was added for 30 min. Plates were
washed again, and the substrate was added for 30–60 min. The percentage of
inhibition was calculated as follow: [1 − ([OD sample − OD neg ctr]/[OD pos
ctr − OD neg ctr])] × 100. Full details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. ROC analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
7 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Full details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
