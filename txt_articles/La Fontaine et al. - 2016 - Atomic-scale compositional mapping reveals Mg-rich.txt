Mg-rich amorphous calcium phosphate in human
dental enamel

Human dental enamel, the hardest tissue in the body, plays a vital role in protecting teeth from wear as a result of daily
grinding and chewing as well as from chemical attack. It is well established that the mechanical strength and fatigue
resistance of dental enamel are derived from its hierarchical structure, which consists of periodically arranged bundles
of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanowires. However, we do not yet have a full understanding of the in vivo HAP crystallization
process that leads to this structure. Mg2+ ions, which are present in many biological systems, regulate HAP crystalliza-
tion by stabilizing its precursor, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), but their atomic-scale distribution within HAP is
unknown. We use atom probe tomography to provide the first direct observations of an intergranular Mg-rich ACP
phase between the HAP nanowires in mature human dental enamel. We also observe Mg-rich elongated precipitates
and pockets of organic material among the HAP nanowires. These observations support the postclassical theory of
amelogenesis (that is, enamel formation) and suggest that decay occurs via dissolution of the intergranular phase. This
information is also useful for the development of more accurate models to describe the mechanical behavior of teeth.
INTRODUCTION
A staggering 60 to 90% of children and nearly 100% of adults
worldwide suffer from dental decay (caries), which occurs via the pro-
gressive dissolution of dental enamel (1). The development of effective
treatments requires a basic understanding of the structure of enamel
and the processes by which it forms and dissolves. Dental enamel con-
sists of a mineral phase [96 weight % (wt %)], mainly in the form of
highly oriented carbonated hydroxyapatite (HAP) ribbon-like nano-
wires with cross-sectional dimensions of about 50 nm × 25 nm that
are up to several millimeters long (2) (Fig. 1D). These crystallites are
packed into bundles known as rods or prisms. Each rod contains
about 40,000 nanowires at a density of roughly 550 crystallites/mm2
(3, 4). The phase present between the enamel rods is referred to as
interprismatic enamel. The rods extend in an interwoven pattern
through the thickness of the enamel, from the dentin-enamel junction
to the outer surface of the tooth (5) (Fig. 1, A to C).
Dental enamel is a biocomposite. Apart from a mineral phase, it
contains enamel proteins (1 wt %) and water (3 wt %). This combi-
nation of proteins, water, and a highly anisotropic nanostructured
mineral phase leads to a unique combination of strength and tough-
ness (6), viscoelastic properties (7, 8), wear (9) and erosion (10)
resistance, and resistance to carious attack (11). These features enable
dental enamel to last a lifetime in the harsh and variable environment
of the oral cavity.
Under normal physiological conditions, demineralization and re-
mineralization processes occur cyclically within the dental biofilm
(plaque) layer, but these processes are balanced (12). The first stage
of caries occurs when the biofilm microbial community shifts toward
acidogenic species because of an imbalance of metabolic activity. This
causes the pH of the dental biofilm to remain low for prolonged
periods of time, resulting in increased dissolution of the dense outer-
most layer that is normally present at the tooth surface, leaving the
tooth susceptible to preferential demineralization of the nanowires
[thought to occur at the nanowire core (13)] and in the spaces that
exist between the enamel rods.
The HAP composition in enamel differs slightly from the perfect
HAP crystal [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2]. Dental enamel HAP is carbonated
and contains trace elements, such as magnesium and sodium (14).
Naturally occurring peptides of the enamel-specific proteins, that is,
amelogenin, ameloblastin, and enamelin, have been identified in
mature human enamel (15). These proteins play an essential role in
enamel formation, that is, amelogenesis. During amelogenesis, amelo-
blast cells secrete an organic matrix containing enamel-specific pro-
teins, which is followed immediately by mineralization. As the HAP
crystallization progresses, specific enzymes degrade and eliminate
most of the remaining organic matrix (16). HAP crystallization is ini-
tiated by the mineralization of an amorphous calcium phosphate
(ACP) precursor (17). It was recently proposed that Mg ions play a
critical role in the stabilization of this ACP phase and the formation of
the HAP mineral, where surface Mg ions retard the growth of HAP
crystals, leading to the nanometer-sized HAP crystallites (18). Knowl-
edge of the distribution of Mg ions and the presence of the precursor
ACP in mature human dental enamel would provide much needed
information for a better understanding of amelogenesis and may even-
tually allow the development of strategies to enhance remineralization,
to slow the progression of or prevent caries, or even to restore lost
dental enamel. However, until recently, it has not been possible to ob-
serve the distribution of Mg ions within HAP nanowires at the nano-
scale in human dental enamel.

 In recent work on rodent tooth enamel (19, 20), nanoscale hetero-
geneities in the distribution of Mg ions and organic materials, as well as
the presence of intergranular ACP, were revealed using atom probe
tomography (APT), a technique that allows three-dimensional (3D) vi-
sualization and chemical analysis at the atomic scale (21). Here, we use
ultraviolet laser–assisted APT to investigate the distribution of trace in-
organic (Mg, Na, and C ions) and organic (C, H, and N ions) materials
within HAP nanowires in mature human dental enamel.
In laser-assisted APT, individual atoms (or small molecules) are
field-evaporated from a needle-shaped sample (tip) with a diameter
of about 100 nm by applying a combination of picosecond laser pulses
and high voltage to the sample. A position-sensitive detector records
the position of each atom, and their mass/charge ratio is determined
by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a result, a 3D reconstruction
of the field-evaporated volume (typically millions of atoms) is ob-
tained (21, 22). In a typical APT mass spectrum, direct peak overlaps
can lead to erroneous ion identification and composition measurements
(23) (fig. S1). For example, in the case of tooth enamel, 24Mg2+, 12C+,
and 24C2
2+ could directly overlap at 12 daltons (and their corresponding
isotopes at 12.5 and 13 daltons). Because there is direct overlap be-
tween these species, the combined use of the isotopic distribution
and the spatial association with other ions (for example, carbon-rich
areas) was used to differentiate with a high degree of confidence be-
tween Mg and C ions from 12 to 13 daltons. Details are provided in
figs. S2 and S3, tables S1 to S5, and Supplementary Text.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Six APT tips were prepared from the cusp region of a human perma-
nent molar tooth, and a total of approximately 400 million atoms were
collected. The APT mass spectra (fig. S1) were consistent with previ-
ous APT studies of HAP (19, 24, 25). O, Ca, and P dominated. Inter-
faces enriched with Mg and Na were found between the HAP
nanowires in all of the samples (Figs. 2 and 3, fig. S4, and movie S1).
Three tips contained Mg-rich elongated precipitates (Fig. 3 and fig. S5),
and two tips contained traces of organic material (Figs. 3 to 5 and fig.
S6). The Ca/P ratios measured within the HAP crystallites in the six tips
are between 1.48 and 1.59, close to the expected ratio of ~1.6 for pure
HAP (26) (table S6).
The intergranular Mg-rich phase between the HAP nanowires is a
calcium phosphate phase with a Ca/P ratio varying from 1.70 to 1.76
and containing ~15 times more Mg and ~1.5 times more Na than the
bulk of the HAP crystallites (table S6). Human tooth enamel differs
from pure HAP because of the presence of CO3, Mg, and Na as its
main impurities. Typical human tooth enamel contains between 2.7
and 5 wt % CO3, between 0.2 and 0.6 wt % Mg, and between 0.2
and 0.9 wt % Na (27, 28). When measured by APT, the level of Mg
in the intergranular phase (from 1.55 to 2.66 wt %) far exceeds the Mg
observed in HAP (~0.10 wt %). Only a disordered calcium phosphate
phase could accommodate this level of foreign ions (29). A Mg-rich
intergranular phase, which is thought to be ACP, has also been re-
ported in rodent dental enamel (19). The intergranular regions were
investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A bright-
field image of HAP nanowires (Fig. 4) shows thin layers of lighter con-
trast between nanowires and a triple point. The bright contrast between
the crystallites is consistent with the presence of an amorphous phase
that appears lighter because of the absence of diffraction. It is assumed
to be the Mg-rich phase observed in the atom probe data.
The HAP nanowires are mostly parallel and elongated in the z di-
rection of the atom probe analysis, corresponding to the c axis of the
nanowires (Figs. 2 and 3). As predicted by theories of enamel forma-
tion (30), the HAP nanowires have grown along the c-axis direction,
whereas their growth in other directions was inhibited. In two APT
tips containing Mg-rich precipitates, the HAP crystallites are bent,
suggesting that their growth was interrupted (fig. S5). The ribbon

 shape of the nanowires is visible in Fig. 2D. The amorphous ACP
phase is homogeneously distributed along all sides of the nanowires.
The ACP phase was found to be 2 to 10 nm thick in all five tips. This
measurement is based on specific Mg isosurfaces, and hence there is
some spread in the values recorded. The TEM image (Fig. 4) indicates
that the width of the amorphous layer is ~2 nm.
This new finding has important implications for the mechanical
and acid corrosion resistance of enamel as well as for the understand-
ing of the HAP growth process. The presence of an intergranular
amorphous layer between the HAP crystallites has a strong influence
on the mechanical and wear properties of enamel similar to ceramic
nanocomposites (31, 32). Previous studies attributed the observed de-
formation behavior under nanoindentation to the presence of proteins
and peptides at the interface between HAP crystallites (31, 33). Here,
we show that the interphase regions contain Mg-ACP phase and rem-
nants of proteins rather than proteins alone (Figs. 3 to 5 and fig. S6).
The Mg-rich ACP is also rich in Na (Figs. 2, 4, and 5 and table S6).
ACP is known to accommodate foreign ions, such as Mg or Na (29).
Although not detected here, fluorine ions have been found in inter-
granular ACP of fluorine-treated rodent enamel (19). In pigmented
rodent enamel, an iron-rich ACP phase replaces the Mg-rich ACP,
greatly improving its resistance to acid attack (19). Here, we provide
evidence of incorporation of foreign ions in ACP in human dental
enamel. This new knowledge highlights the potential for new tech-
niques of remineralization using the intergranular ACP as a conduit
for ions known to benefit enamel remineralization, such as fluorine.
Although the intergranular ACP phase may provide a pathway for
beneficial ions, it also has higher dissolution rates in acidic environ-
ments compared to the crystalline HAP phase (34), having been
shown to be preferentially etched by acid in rodent tooth (19).
It has been hypothesized that Na within the ACP may act to balance
the charge as a result of an increase in hydroxyl ions (20). However, we
found no clear evidence of H enrichment within the intergranular ACP
(table S6). Although it is difficult to distinguish the H in the instrument
chamber from the H in the sample, sharp localized increases in H in
specific features within atom probe data could be interpreted as coming
from the sample.
The carbon content measured in HAP and ACP varied greatly be-
tween the samples, depending on whether they (i) consisted of the
HAP/ACP only (for example, Fig. 2), (ii) contained Mg-rich precipi-
tates (for example, Figs. 3 to 5), or (iii) also contained C-rich regions
(for example, Figs. 3 to 5). Samples with no Mg-rich precipitates or
organic material contain ~0.12 wt % C in HAP and ~0.22 wt % C in
ACP. The average carbonate content in bulk HAP is expected to be ~3
to 5 wt % (~1 wt % C) higher than the APT results (35). On the other
hand, the samples containing Mg-rich precipitates and signs of organ-
ic materials (Figs. 3 and 5) have a total C concentration of ~0.42 wt %
in the ACP regions and 0.23 wt % in the HAP regions (table S6).
Most of the carbon measured in the ACP and HAP is thought to
be inorganic (from carbonates), because no significant enrichment of
H, 14N2+, 12C2+, and 44CNO+ was detected (Fig. 5). On the other hand,
the precipitates that contain a much larger amount of carbon (15.6 wt %)
are thought to be organic in origin owing to the copresence of H, 14N2+,
12C2+, and 44CNO+ (fig. S3). The C evaporating as 28CO+ and 29COH+ is
from both organic and inorganic origin (Fig. 5D), whereas the C from
44CO2+ is from carbonates only (Fig. 5B), as highlighted by the respective
isosurfaces. The distribution of carbonates and organic carbon is highly

 heterogeneous. Reconstructed APT volumes also revealed that the Mg-
rich precipitates are elongated along the nanowire’s c axis (Fig. 3 and figs.
S5 and S6) and contain ~2 wt % Mg, very close to the Mg content of the
ACP intergranular phase.
Our direct observation of these Mg-rich ACP and precipitates
supports the postclassical theory of amelogenesis (36). It has been dem-
onstrated that, during amelogenesis, the enamel mineral nanowires
near the mineralization front initially take the form of the ACP phase,
and then at a later stage during the enamel maturation, they crystallize
into the HAP phase. Our observations support the hypothesis that
ACP ribbon-like nanowires are initially formed following the template
provided by the enamel-specific self-assembled protein matrix, mainly
composed of the N-terminal amelogenin cleavage products. The ACP
nanowires begin to crystallize into the HAP phase only during the
maturation stage, which lasts about 5 years for human permanent
teeth. This stage is characterized by the secretion of kallikrein 4
(KLK4) proteases, which progressively degrade the enamel protein
matrix followed by the reabsorption of the cleaved products into ame-
loblasts. The removal of the protein matrix allows ribbon-like nanowires
to crystallize and grow in thickness, interlocking with the neighboring
crystallites. Regions of enamel where peptides were not removed remain
poorly crystallized. They are characterized by the increased concentra-
tions of magnesium, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen ions.
CONCLUSIONS
Atomic-scale observations of an intergranular Mg-rich ACP phase be-
tween the enamel rods in human dental enamel contribute to our
understanding of how enamel forms, how it decays, and its mech-
anical behavior. Understanding how enamel forms is the first step
for the development of methods to achieve remineralization of carious
enamel. Our observations verify the mechanism of enamel formation,
specifically the postclassical theory of amelogenesis. Because the Mg-
ACP phase at the enamel boundaries is susceptible to dissolution in an
acidic environment, we propose that decay occurs via dissolution
along the enamel rod boundaries. Finally, these results can be used
to improve models of the mechanical properties and wear behavior
of enamel by incorporating the true properties of the intergranular
ACP phase.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation
The collection of the human tooth sample for this study was ap-
proved by Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research
Ethics Committee, Australia (AU RED HREC/15/WMEAD/142).
The tooth used in this study was a molar.
Tooth cutting. Following the extraction, the tooth was fixed
overnight in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer at 4°C. The specimen
was then placed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich
Co.; 9.8 g/liter of deionized distilled water) for 24 hours at 4°C and
then dried with compressed air. The tooth was cut along the mesio-
distal axis at the cement-dentin junction to separate the crown using a
low-speed diamond saw (IsoMet, Buehler Ltd.) under constant water
irrigation. One-millimeter-thick sections were prepared from the
crown using a low-speed diamond saw.

 Optical imaging. For optical imaging, the tooth section was
thinned and polished using 30-, 9-, and 6-mm diamond lapping films
(Allied High Tech Products) on a tripod (Allied High Tech Products).
An electron transparent sample was used for transmitted dark-field
optical imaging.
Transmission electron microscopy. For TEM, the specimens
were further thinned on a tripod using 6-, 3-, and 1-mm diamond
lapping films, followed by ion beam thinning for 2 hours at 3 kV in
a precision ion polishing system (Gatan 691) using a cold stage.
Atom probe tomography. For APT, a small piece (10 mm ×
10 mm) of enamel from the tooth cross section was cut out. It was
then tripod-polished to a thin wedge (typically below 10 mm) and
attached to a support grid. The sample was then coated with gold to
limit charging effects under the electron beam. Posts that were
about 4 mm wide and with 50- to 100-mm clearance were cut using
a Zeiss Auriga focused ion beam. The samples were then milled to
form atom probe tips (80 to 120 nm in diameter) with final milling
using a low acceleration voltage (10 kV) to minimize Ga implanta-
tion and damage.
Optical microscopy
A Leica DM6000 optical microscope was used in reflective light and
transmitted dark field for the optical images of the tooth.
Transmission electron microscopy
TEM was carried out on a CM120 Biofilter microscope running at
120 kV by using a JEOL standard high-background double-tilt holder.
Atom probe tomography
APT measurements were conducted on a Cameca LEAP 4000× Si
atom probe equipped with a picosecond-pulsed ultraviolet laser. In
laser-assisted APT, individual atoms or small molecules from a
needle-shape sample (tip) with a diameter of about 100 nm were
field-evaporated by picosecond laser pulses in combination with high
voltage applied to the sample. A position-sensitive detector recorded
the position of each atom, and their mass/charge ratio was deter-
mined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a result, a 3D recon-
struction of the field-evaporated volume (typically millions of atoms)
was obtained.
Here, a 355-nm-wavelength laser with a pulse energy of 100 pJ and
a pulse frequency of 250 kHz was used to field-evaporate the samples
at 50 K. A total of 400 million atoms from six tips were detected.
