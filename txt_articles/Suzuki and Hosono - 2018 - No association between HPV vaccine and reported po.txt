Nagoya City introduced free HPV vaccination in 2010 and in April 2013 the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare included the HPV vaccine in the National Immunization Program. However, in June 2013, the Ministry
suspended proactive recommendation of the vaccine after unconfirmed reports of adverse events. To investigate
any potential association between the vaccine and reported symptoms, Nagoya City conducted a questionnaire-
based survey.
Participants were 71,177 female residents of Nagoya City born between April 2, 1994 and April 1, 2001. The
anonymous postal questionnaire investigated the onset of 24 symptoms (primary outcome), associated hospital
visits, frequency, and influence on school attendance.
Totally, 29,846 residents responded. No significant increase in occurrence of any of the 24 reported post-HPV
vaccination symptoms was found. The vaccine was associated with increased age-adjusted odds of hospital visits
for “abnormal amount of menstrual bleeding” (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.13–1.82), “irregular menstruation” (OR:
1.29, 95% CI: 1.12–1.49), “severe headaches” (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02–1.39), and chronic, persisting “abnormal
amount of menstrual bleeding” (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.11–1.79). No symptoms significantly influenced school
attendance and no accumulation of symptoms was observed.
The results suggest no causal association between the HPV vaccines and reported symptoms.
1. Introduction
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women
worldwide, with about 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths in 2012
[1]. In Japan, mortality from cervical cancer is increasing in women of
reproductive age [2,3]. Furthermore, between 1994 and 2011, there
was a 4.4% annual percentage increase in incidence of cervical cancer
in women aged 15–39 years [4]. Most women who develop cervical
cancer are either under-screened or never-screened. The cervical cancer
screening rate in Europe and Northern America, is roughly 80%;
however, in Japan it was only 37.7% in 2011 [5].
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends human pa-
pillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to prevent HPV infection and the de-
velopment of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases [6]. The
bivalent HPV vaccine was licensed in Japan in October 2009. Soon after
this, Nagoya City, with a population of approximately 2,300,000 and
located in the center of Japan, initiated a fully financed HPV vaccina-
tion program to encourage vaccination of girls born between April 2,
1996 and April 1, 1998 and in the first and second year of junior high
school. In April 2013, HPV was added to the list of recommended
routine vaccinations in Japan. However, following unconfirmed reports
of unusual post-vaccination symptoms, the Japanese Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare (MHLW) suspended its proactive recommendations
for the vaccine in June 2013 [7] and instructed local health authorities
to stop promoting the use of the vaccine until the suspected adverse
events had been investigated. This led to a rapid and dramatic decrease
in vaccination coverage, even though the HPV vaccines were freely
available for the target age-group [8,9].
Epidemiological studies conducted globally since the launch of the
HPV vaccines have failed to find any increased risk of developing
conditions claimed to be associated with the vaccine such as complex
regional pain syndrome (CRPS) [10,11], postural orthostatic tachy-
cardia syndrome (POTS) [11], multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating
diseases [12], venous thromboembolism [13], or any other adverse
events following immunization [14]. A meta-analysis [15] and a recent
review [16] found that both the bi- and quadrivalent HPV vaccines
were safe. Descriptive studies such as case reports of CRPS, POTS [17]
and a novel disease entity, HPV vaccination-associated neuro-im-
munopathetic syndrome (HANS) [18], have been published in Japan.
However, no analytical epidemiological studies investigating the

T
 association between HPV vaccines and reported post-vaccination
symptoms, have been published.
In January 2014, following clinical evaluation of individual cases,
the MHLW concluded that the reported post-vaccination symptoms
were not causally associated with HPV vaccination but were psycho-
somatic responses [19]. Despite this statement, the MHLW insisted that
further studies were required before once again promoting the use of
HPV vaccines [20]. It has been argued that this decision was not based
on adequate scientific evidence because the Japanese vaccination
system suffers from a failure of governance [21]. The decision to sus-
pend proactive recommendations for the HPV vaccines traveled glob-
ally through online networks and social media and was applauded by
antivaccination groups but not by the global scientific community [22].
In August 2015, the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology de-
manded the resumption of proactive recommendations for HPV vacci-
nation because it is recommended for the prevention of cervical cancer
[23]. Others also argued that a fair and transparent policy, including
no-fault compensation, was required when implementing a new vacci-
nation program, including the HPV vaccine, in Japan [24,25]. Fur-
thermore, in December 2015, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on
Vaccine Safety (GACVS) noted in their Statement on the Safety of HPV
Vaccines that in Japan “young women are being left vulnerable to HPV-
related cancers that otherwise could be prevented. As GACVS has noted
previously, policy decisions based on weak evidence, leading to lack of
use of safe and effective vaccines, can result in real harm” [26]
In March 2014, Nagoya City council requested that the national
government investigate any possible causal association between HPV
vaccines and reported post-vaccination symptoms, and to recommend
treatments for such symptoms. In January 2015, the Aichi Branch of All
Japan Coordinating Association of HPV Vaccine Sufferers asked for and
received approval from the Mayor of Nagoya City for an investigation
into reported symptoms after HPV vaccination. Consequently, Nagoya
City and the Nagoya City University agreed to conduct a large-scale
questionnaire-based study in April 2015 to investigate any association
between HPV vaccines and reported post-vaccination symptoms. The
results of this study are presented in this paper
2. Methods
Participants eligible for the study were women born between April
2, 1994 and April 1, 2001 (9–15 years old on April 1, 2010), who were
residents of Nagoya City as of August 12, 2015. The survey tool was an
anonymous postal questionnaire. The study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nagoya City University,
Graduate School of Medical Sciences (approval number 1206).
The anonymous questionnaire was mailed to each eligible resident
in September 1, 2015; responses that were returned before November 2,
2015 were evaluated. The responses included information on the birth
date of the person eligible for vaccination, which was stratified by year
to one of seven 1-year age groups (categories) beginning on April 2,
1994 and ending on April 1, 1995 through 2001, and information on
the responder (the person eligible for vaccination, the person eligible
for vaccination with help from her parent or caregiver, or only the
parent or caregiver). The onset of one or more of 24 symptoms between
the sixth year of elementary school and the time of the survey were the
primary outcomes. These included: irregular menstrual periods; ab-
normal amount of menstrual bleeding; pain in the joints or other parts
of the body; severe headache; fatigue; poor endurance; difficulty con-
centrating; visual field abnormalities; abnormal sensitivity to light;
sudden vision loss; dizziness; cold feet; difficulty falling asleep; abnor-
mally long sleep duration; skin problems; hyperventilation; memory
decline;, loss of ability to perform simple calculations; loss of ability to
remember fundamental Kanji [Chinese characters indispensable for life
in Japan]; involuntary uncontrollable body movements; loss of the
ability to walk normally; becoming dependent on a walking stick or
wheelchair; sudden loss of strength; and weakness in the hands and
feet. The month and year of symptom onset, hospital visits because of
symptoms, current frequency of the symptoms (i.e., always, sometimes,
rarely, or never), influence of symptoms on school attendance or em-
ployment, HPV vaccination history (the number of injections and the
injection schedule), type of HPV vaccine: the bivalent HPV vaccine
(Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) or the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil,
Merck & Co.), and reasons for not completing the full immunization
schedule, if applicable, were recorded. Items to be included in the
questionnaire items were selected after consultations with both the
study investigators and the Aichi Branch of the All Japan Coordinating
Association of HPV Vaccine Sufferers. The original Japanese version of
the questionnaire [27] and an English language translation [28] are
available online.
2.1. Statistical analysis
Association of the HPV vaccination with one or more of the 24 re-
ported symptoms was the primary outcome. This was evaluated in the
entire study population. Other outcomes such as hospital visits for
symptoms, persistent and constant symptoms (answered “always” for
current frequency of the symptoms), influence on life activities, and
occurrence of multiple symptoms, were also investigated for any po-
tential association with HPV vaccination. Logistic regression analysis
was used to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The
analysis was repeated for each vaccine individually (Cervarix or
Gardasil).
Subgroup analyses by age and year of first injection (subgroup
analysis I), and after exclusion of subjects with early-onset symptoms
(subgroup analysis II), were also conducted. In both subgroups, subjects
in each age category were selected by year of first vaccine injection and
grouped to form 2-year age distribution as follows: first and second
category in 2011; third category in 2010, fourth category in 2010 and
2011, fifth category in 2011 and 2012, sixth category in 2012 and
2013, and seventh category in 2013, as shown in Fig. 1 (also numbered
in bold in Table 1). The entire population of vaccinated and un-
vaccinated subjects, grouped as described above, comprised the “main
frame” of the study. For subgroup analysis I, five cohorts based on the
year of the first injection were created. Each cohort included in-
dividuals born within two sequential years and comprising most vac-
cine recipients in the corresponding years. Girls of the same age who
had not been vaccinated were also included in each cohort as controls.
The structure of the cohorts is shown in Fig. 1. For example, cohort 3
consists of 1500 + 1300 vaccinated girls and 663 + 1260 unvaccinated
ones (see Table 1). In the subgroup analysis I, two comparisons were
performed; in terms of age difference between cohort 1 and 3, (fixed
injection year of 2010) and time trend among cohort 2, 3, 4, and 5
(fixed age in 11–14 years old).
Subgroup analysis II was also performed using data obtained from
the main frame participants. Those with symptoms that had occurred
before the year of the first HPV vaccination (i.e., not caused by the
vaccine) were excluded (Fig. 2). The purpose of subgroup analysis II
was to allow for analyses after excluding “noise” attributable to the
grand analysis. This exclusion, performed regardless of vaccination
status, prevented biased results from consideration of symptoms in
vaccinated girls before they received the first injection. The statistical
analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
3. Results
A total of 71,177 questionnaires were sent, 217 were returned as not
deliverable, and 30,793 (43.4%) of the 70,960 distributed copies were
returned by the recipients. Of those, 947 were excluded because of
missing data on HPV vaccination status and/or age. The responses in
the remaining 29,846 questionnaires were included in the analysis.

status including year of dose one, and the overall number of doses

 administered. Vaccination coverage in the first to fourth category
was > 85%. It began to decline in the fifth age category and dropped to
15% in the seventh category.
Table 2 shows the distribution of HPV vaccination status and oc-
currence of the 24 reported symptoms. The most common symptom was
menstrual irregularity (26.3%) followed by cold feet (12.3%). Another
six symptoms: severe headache, fatigue, poor endurance, dizziness,
abnormally long duration of sleep, and skin problems were reported
by > 10% of participants. In contrast, four symptoms: unable to per-
form simple calculations; involuntary uncontrollable body movements;
loss of ability to walk in a normal way; and becoming dependent on a
walking stick or wheelchair was reported by < 1.0% of participants.
In our analyses, we hypothesized age and the person responding to
the questionnaire (child versus parent) might be potential confounders.
Age, but not responder, confounded the association between HPV
vaccination and reported symptoms, therefore we decided all analyses
should be age-adjusted. Table 3 shows the age-adjusted ORs for the
association between HPV vaccination and occurrence of the 24 reported
symptoms (primary outcomes), hospital visits for the symptoms, and
persistent or continuing symptoms. None of the 24 reported symptoms
were significantly associated with increased odds of occurring after
administration of the HPV vaccine. Three symptoms had significantly
increased odds of attending hospital: 1.43 (95% CI: 1.13–1.82) for
“abnormal amount of menstrual bleeding”; 1.29 (95% CI: 1.12–1.49)
for “irregular menstruation”, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.02–1.39) for “severe
headache”. Persistent occurrence of “abnormal amounts of menstrual
bleeding” was also statistically significant, OR of 1.41 (95% CI:
1.11–1.79).
Fig. 1. Subjects Included in the Five Main Frame Cohorts of the Subgroup Analyses. Cohorts 1 and 3 include girls who were vaccinated in 2011 plus their unvaccinated controls. Cohorts
2, 3, 4, and 5 include girls who were vaccinated at 11–14 years of age plus their unvaccined controls. Subjects belonging to any cohort were considered main frame subjects.

 There was no statistically significant association between any of the
24 reported symptoms and school performance, school activities other
than studying, and job hunting and employment at 0.82 (95% CI:

and multiple symptoms.
Because the bivalent vaccines was licensed two years before quad-
rivalent vaccine, 87.8% of recipients were vaccinated with the bivalent
vaccine in 2010 and 2011 and 80.0% of recipients with the quad-
rivalent vaccine in 2012 and 2013. None of the ORs for association of

 symptoms after vaccination with the bivalent vaccine were significant,
whereas the OR for experiencing “involuntary uncontrollable body
movements” was significantly increased after vaccination with the
quadrivalent vaccine (1.54, 95% CI: 1.04–2.29). However, the ORs for a
hospital visit (1.19, 95% CI: 0.50–2.84), and persistent and constant
symptom (0.52, 95% CI: 0.11–2.44), were not significant. No other
symptoms were significantly associated with the quadrivalent vaccine.
The analyses were repeatedly performed to evaluate main frame
data for each year of being administered the first dose and in the un-
vaccinated controls. The 23,774 participants included 14,676 vacci-
nated and 9098 unvaccinated girls shown in bold numbers in Table 1,
and comprised 79.7% of the entire sample of 29,846 participants. We
obtained almost identical results (data not shown) with those of the
grand analysis shown in Table 3.
As shown in Table 4, the five cohorts differed in age and year of
receiving the first dose of the HPV vaccine. Table 5 shows the age-
adjusted ORs of the association between individual reported symptoms
and the year of first vaccination. The ORs for occurrence of each of the
24 reported symptoms in cohorts 1 and 3 were all higher in cohort 3
participants compared to those in the older cohort 1 participants. No
significant ORs were observed. Comparisons of cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5
revealed increases in ORs in more recent years of vaccination. Although
significant, high ORs were observed in cohorts 4 and 5, the involved
symptoms differed in the two groups.
Table 6 shows the results of subgroup analysis II, wherein the
subjects with symptoms that occurred before the first year of HPV
vaccination were excluded. “Weakness of the hands and feet” was the
only symptom with a significantly higher OR (1.44, 95% CI: 1.09–1.82).
The ORs of the 24 reported symptoms that led to a hospital visit were
higher than those in the grand analysis shown in Table 3. Five of the 13
symptoms that led to a hospital visit had significantly increased ORs
of > 2.0. The highest OR was 6.15 (95% CI: 1.03–23.78) for “inability
to
remember
fundamental
Kanji”,
followed
by
4.59
(95%
CI:
1.32–28.75) for “unable to do simple calculations”. There were only
two hospital visits among unvaccinated subjects for these two symp-
toms.

 comparison within the population.
None of the age-adjusted ORs of the primary study outcomes in the
main analysis, namely the 24 symptoms that have been reported in the
media, by the victims’ supports group or proposed by some physicians
as being associated with HPV vaccination were significant. The ORs of
three symptoms that led to a hospital visit were significant. Of those,
“abnormal amounts of menstrual bleeding” (OR = 1.43) was the only
one that persisted at the time of the study and had a significantly high
OR. No other symptoms that persisted at the time of the study had
significantly higher ORs in the vaccinated group. Although the sub-
group analyses revealed significantly increased ORs for several symp-
toms, none remained consistently high in all three analyses. There was
also no evidence of the occurrence of multiple concurrent symptoms as
reported in the Japanese media after HPV vaccination or by a few
physicians. Significant findings were also absent for each vaccine when
analyzed separately, although significantly higher ORs were occasion-
ally observed in the secondary analyses. Additionally, the planned
alpha error of 5%, should be considered when interpreting these results.
Our findings support the reports of WHO and the Japanese Government
regarding the safety of these HPV vaccines.
The influence of age at vaccination is apparent from the difference
in ORs between cohorts 1 and 3. However, the lower ORs seen in cohort
1 could be attributed to the higher vaccination coverage in that group
causing the relatively poor health conditions of the unvaccinated girls
(frailty selection bias) in cohort 1 [29,30]. However, the problem of the
frailty bias might be less serious in the relatively homogeneous school
population than in an aged population with various health conditions.
Furthermore, HPV vaccination is not contraindicated for the reported
post-vaccination symptoms. Therefore the presence of these symptoms
would not be a reason not to vaccinate against HPV. As for the yearly
trend in ORs, the number of symptoms with point estimates of ORs > 1
increased over time, i.e., 3, 7, 9, and 13 symptoms in cohorts 2, 3, 4,
and 5, respectively. These increases may have occurred within a short
4-year period because of the relatively poor health status of girls in the
unvaccinated groups in the early study period when the vaccination
coverage was higher [30]. Other reasons include enhanced negative
psychological effects in response to negative opinions about HPV vac-
cination and because memory of vaccine-associated symptoms faded as
time passed. Marked changes in ORs over a short interval are unlikely
to have a biological cause and suggest the involvement of socio-psy-
chological factors and/or changes in the characteristics of subjects with
vaccination coverage.
Exclusion of subjects with symptoms that occurred before the first
vaccination year did not alter the ORs for the primary outcome of
symptom occurrence, but it did increase the ORs of symptoms that led
to a hospital visit compared with the grand (Table 3) and main frame
analyses (not shown). After exclusion, the ORs of 13 of 24 symptoms
that led to a hospital visit were significantly increased. This could have
resulted from relatively more severe symptoms among HPV vaccine
recipients which needed a physician's diagnosis/treatment (reason A),
more frequent doctor visits by vaccine recipients because they were
anxious about causal relationship between HPV vaccine and symptoms
(reason B), or a strong impression of HPV vaccination which had un-
consciously moved the memory of the symptom onset to after the
vaccination (reason C). The “loss of ability to remember fundamental
Kanji” and “loss of ability to perform simple calculations” high ORs
(6.15 and 4.95, respectively), but exclusion of participants with
symptoms that occurred early in the study period, did not affect the
occurrence or persistence of these symptoms. As shown in Table 6, the
ORs of symptoms that led to a hospital visit differed significantly from
those of the other types of outcomes. This suggests that hospital visits
were not driven by the severity of symptoms but rather by changes in
the attitude toward seeking medical advice and/or an effect of vacci-
nation on the questionnaire responses. It is noteworthy that biological
causal association (reason A), influence of vaccination on hospital-vis-
iting behavior (reason B), and influence of vaccination on the
questionnaire answers (reason C) became indistinguishable when the
relationship of HPV vaccination and hospital visits was analyzed, re-
sulting in a high OR regardless of a causal association. In addition, the
highest ORs of 6.15 and 4.95 were calculated on only two subjects
among the unvaccinated subjects, therefore they are not robust.
The most important study strength of this study was the inclusion of
both recipients and non-recipients of HPV vaccine within the same
population. The comparison was performed internally and did not rely
on external data. Another study strength was very little missing data of
HPV vaccine status and occurrence of symptoms, which would have
been frequent if the study had depended on data retrieved from medical
records only. Additionally, as we surveyed participant experiences of
vaccine injection and occurrence of symptoms over time, the data re-
flected incidence cases rather than prevalence cases, which allowed a
clear description of causal inferences. Thus, we believe that the findings
of this study significantly advance our understanding on the lack of
causal associations between HPV vaccines and post-vaccination symp-
toms. We also believe that the response rate of 43.4% is a strength of
this study, since it was set in an urban area. We believe it was due to
great efforts by Nagoya City, which included sending reminder letters
to all of subjects, public broadcast via TV/subway news, and notifica-
tion by flyers and posters, and so on. Finally, this survey allowed the
parent or caregiver to respond and not just the child, which was an
effective strategy to obtain a higher response rate. If we did not allow
parents or caregivers to respond, the response rate might have been
23.0% (16,347/70,960) lower.
However, the first major limitation of this study was also an im-
perfect response rate resulting in possible selection bias that may have
affected the results [31]. The questionnaire was sent to all female re-
sidents of Nagoya City born in specific years, so the estimated asso-
ciation would be unbiased if the response rate was sufficiently high.
However, restricting the evaluation only to responders with an in-
sufficient response rate would lead to selection bias of HPV vaccine and
occurrence of symptoms [32]. While we cannot assess the magnitude of
the bias theoretically, we have a base population and were could cal-
culate the response rate, which provides stronger validation of the re-
sults than a smaller and/or unavailable response rate. Furthermore, the
results of the subgroup analysis without these answers from parents
only was quite close to the main analysis, i.e., no significantly high OR
(data not shown). The results might be robust if the response rate was
higher.
A second limitation was that the study design did not solicit very
rare symptoms. Different study designs (e.g., case-control or monitoring
system [33]) are necessary to investigate extremely rare or severe
symptoms, including serious adverse events [34]. Insofar as mild or
moderate symptoms may be extensions of corresponding severe symp-
toms, this study indirectly addressed that association. This study was
not able to detect the association of HPV vaccine with extremely severe
and rare events that do not have any relationship with the 24 reported
symptoms. However, as we wrote in the methods sections, symptoms to
be surveyed were chose in cooperation with the cooperation of the
Aichi Branch of the All Japan Coordinating Association of HPV Vaccine
Sufferers and reflect the symptoms they felt were associated with the
HPV vaccine.
The third limitation was the use of self-reported symptoms without
guidelines or diagnoses by a physician. Although we were unable to
treat diseases based on a physician guidelines, the significance of this
study derives from its design as an epidemiological study with internal
comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Outcomes
were not diseases or syndromes but simple symptoms and their influ-
ence on daily life. Thus personal interpretation to questions is likely to
be rather homogeneous despite the fact that the validity of the symp-
toms using self-reporting is unknown in this population. If we required
a clinical diagnosis, there would have been more missing data, resulting
in less precise and even more biased results. We decided not to collect
the information on clinical diagnoses, since it was neither essential nor

 realistic for this type of study design.
The temporal relationship between vaccination and symptoms de-
serves mention as a potential limitation. We did not completely exclude
symptoms that occurred before vaccination because only vaccinated
participants had an immunization date and deleting those cases from
the vaccinated groups would have violated the validity of comparison.
Instead, we devised two time frames for both vaccinated and un-
vaccinated girls (i.e., the grand analysis in Table 3 and the subgroup
analysis II in Table 6) and observed the changes in ORs. Symptoms prior
to vaccination may provide “noise”, but the validity of comparison
between vaccinated and unvaccinated was maintained. Every epide-
miological study design has unique strengths and weaknesses. To more
clearly determine the association of vaccination and symptoms, many
studies of diverse design and objective are needed. Despite several
limitations, we believe that the results of the study are a significant
addition to our knowledge on the safety of HPV vaccination in Japan.
5. Conclusion
In this large-scale survey in Nagoya, Japan, we found that the HPV
vaccines were not significantly associated with the occurrence of 24
reported symptoms, thus suggesting no causal association between the
vaccines and reported symptoms or adverse events.
