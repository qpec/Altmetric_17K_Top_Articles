Abstract
IMPORTANCE—In 2011, critical congenital heart disease was added to the US Recommended 
Uniform Screening Panel for newborns, but whether state implementation of screening policies 
has been associated with infant death rates is unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To assess whether there was an association between implementation of state 
newborn screening policies for critical congenital heart disease and infant death rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Observational study with group-level analyses. 
A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted using the National Center for Health Statistics’ 
period linked birth/infant death data set files for 2007–2013 for 26 546 503 US births through June 
30, 2013, aggregated by month and state of birth.
EXPOSURES—State policies were classified as mandatory or nonmandatory (including 
voluntary policies and mandates that were not yet implemented). As of June 1, 2013, 8 states had 
implemented mandatory screening policies, 5 states had voluntary screening policies, and 9 states 
had adopted but not yet implemented mandates.

 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Numbers of early infant deaths (between 24 hours 
and 6 months of age) coded for critical congenital heart disease or other/unspecified congenital 
cardiac causes for each state-month birth cohort.
RESULTS—Between 2007 and 2013, there were 2734 deaths due to critical congenital heart 
disease and 3967 deaths due to other/unspecified causes. Critical congenital heart disease death 
rates in states with mandatory screening policies were 8.0 (95% CI, 5.4–10.6) per 100 000 births 
(n = 37) in 2007 and 6.4 (95% CI, 2.9–9.9) per 100 000 births (n = 13) in 2013 (for births by the 
end of July); for other/unspecified cardiac causes, death rates were 11.7 (95% CI, 8.6–14.8) per 
100 000 births in 2007 (n = 54) and 10.3 (95% CI, 5.9–14.8) per 100 000 births (n = 21) in 2013. 
Early infant deaths from critical congenital heart disease through December 31, 2013, decreased 
by 33.4% (95% CI, 10.6%–50.3%), with an absolute decline of 3.9 (95% CI, 3.6–4.1) deaths per 
100 000 births after states implemented mandatory screening compared with prior periods and 
states without screening policies. Early infant deaths from other/unspecified cardiac causes 
declined by 21.4% (95% CI, 6.9%–33.7%), with an absolute decline of 3.5 (95% CI, 3.2–3.8) 
deaths per 100 000 births. No significant decrease was associated with nonmandatory screening 
policies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Statewide implementation of mandatory policies for 
newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease was associated with a significant decrease 
in infant cardiac deaths between 2007 and 2013 compared with states without these policies.
Congenital heart disease, which occurs in 800 per 100000 births,1 accounted for 6% of US 
infant deaths during 1999–2006.2 Critical congenital heart disease, a subset of 12 
phenotypes or defects with a high likelihood of presenting with low blood oxygen saturation 
(hypoxemia), occurs in 200 per 100000 births.1,3 The rationale for screening is that timely 
detection can reduce the risk of an apparently healthy infant with critical congenital heart 
disease being discharged home and experiencing a potentially fatal crisis.4 If not diagnosed 
in a timely manner, particularly before the patent ductus arteriosus closes at a few days of 
life, infants with these defects often die. Surgical treatments are available, and survival to 
adulthood in the modern era surpasses 82% in the United States despite surgical 
complications and long-term cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities.5
Routine screening using pulse oximetry in the United States is typically conducted around 
24 hours after birth.3 Following a positive screening result, diagnostic tests are conducted to 
determine a cause of hypoxemia.6 Echocardiography is routinely done to identify a cardiac 
cause, and other tests such as chest x-ray, complete blood cell count, and blood culture may 
be ordered to identify noncardiac causes. Specificity of screening at or after 24 hours is high 
and false positives uncommon (approximately 0.05%4,5). The sensitivity of screening to 
detect critical congenital heart disease is variable; a meta-analysis estimated a sensitivity of 
78%,7 but sensitivity may range from 36% to 92% depending on the phenotype.8 Modeling 
studies of the potential number of cases detected by screening for critical congenital heart 
disease in the United States suggest that screening could be cost-effective.8,9
Critical congenital heart disease was added to the US Recommended Uniform Screening 
Panel for newborns in September 2011.10,11 Subsequently, most US states implemented 
policies recommending or requiring screening.11,12 As of August 9, 2016, 48 states had

 either enacted legislation or adopted regulations relating to pulse oximetry screening of 
newborns.13
This study evaluated the association between state screening policies during 2011–2013 and 
infant deaths attributable to critical congenital heart disease, hypothesizing that states that 
implemented screening policies would experience greater declines in death rates than other 
states and that this association would be strongest in states with mandatory screening.
Methods
Study Design
This was an observational study with group-level analyses. Pooled cross-sectional time-
series data with a difference-in-differences analytic approach were used to evaluate changes 
in critical congenital heart disease and other congenital heart disease deaths in states 
implementing screening policies between August 1, 2011, and June 1, 2013. This design 
controlled for both secular trends in infant cardiac deaths and time-invariant state-specific 
effects.14 Given that deaths are not independent within a state over time, clustered standard 
errors were estimated to prevent overrejection of the null hypothesis.15
Because the data were anonymized, the human subjects contact at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental 
Disabilities determined that the study did not require human subjects protections in 
accordance with federal regulations.
Data
The period linked birth/infant death data set files from the National Center for Health 
Statistics at the CDC containing live births from 2007 through 2013 were used. The 2013 
data were the most recent available data at the time of analysis. These files contain all infant 
(<1 year of age) deaths in a given year linked to the corresponding birth certificates for 
infants born in the same year or the previous year. The database includes information from 
both the birth certificate (eg, state and month of birth) and death certificate (eg, age at death 
and underlying and multiple causes of death).
Policies
A screening policy can be a regulation, guidance document, or legislation and can be 
mandatory or nonmandatory. For enactment dates of nonmandatory policies, the month 
during which a policy was enacted was treated as the beginning of the exposure to the 
policy; all infants born in that month were classified as exposed and all infants born in 
months before any screening policy was adopted were treated as unexposed. Months for 
which the implementation date of a mandatory screening policy occurred on the first day of 
the month were classified as exposed. Because mandates typically have a lead time before 
being implemented, with gradual adoption of screening by hospitals, births during months 
after a mandate had been enacted but not yet implemented were classified as exposed to 
nonmandatory screening policies, the same as months during which explicitly non-
mandatory screening policies were in place.

 Enactment and implementation dates were identified by review of legislation, regulations, or 
guidance documents or descriptions of those policies when available, supplemented by a 
source of information on critical congenital heart disease screening policy dates in months 
(Table 1).11
Outcome Measures
In the period linked birth/infant death data set used in this study, approximately 90% of 
infant deaths due to critical congenital heart disease occurred in the first 6 months after birth. 
The main outcome variables were the numbers of early infant (from 24 hours to <6 months 
of age) deaths due to either critical congenital heart disease or other/unspecified congenital 
heart defects based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes Q20.0–Q26.9 for underlying cause of death 
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Deaths coded for patent or persistent foramen ovale (Q21.1) 
or patent ductus arteriosus (Q25.0) if the infant was born preterm were excluded because 
these are considered normal conditions of prematurity.16 To identify deaths coded for critical 
congenital heart disease, ICD-10 codes associated with 12 phenotypes were used, although 
some codes may include noncritical congenital heart disease malformations (eTable 1).17 All 
deaths not coded for critical congenital heart disease were classified as “other” congenital 
cardiac deaths. Births from January 1, 2007, to June 30, 2013, were included in the analysis; 
births in the second half of 2013 were excluded to ensure that all deaths prior to 6 months of 
age were identified.
Statistical Analysis
Data were aggregated by birth month and year and state of birth. Because not all infant death 
records could be linked to the corresponding birth certificate, weights included in the data 
set were used in the aggregation to adjust for the percentage of death certificates linked to 
birth certificates, which varied slightly by age at death and state. Early infant deaths due to 
critical congenital heart disease and other/unspecified congenital heart defects among infants 
born in states that at the time of birth had policies in effect that mandated screening were 
compared with cohorts of infants born in states without screening policies in place at the 
time of birth.
Because the outcome variable of interest was a count (number of deaths due to critical 
congenital heart disease or other/unspecified defects in a given state-month-year), a Poisson 
regression model was used. Deviance and Pearson goodness-of-fit tests were conducted, and 
large P values provided no evidence against selecting a Poisson regression model. The log 
number of monthly births in a state was included as an offset along with time-varying state 
characteristics, state and year-month fixed effects to capture time-variant factors in each 
state, and time-specific factors common across all states (eTable 2 in the Supplement). 
Adjusted percentage declines in early infant death rates were calculated by taking the 
exponential of the regression coefficients (and the associated 95%confidence interval) and 
subtracting 1.
The difference-in-differences identification strategy relies on the assumption of parallel 
pretreatment trends in treated and control states. This assumption in models was tested by 
Abouk et al.

 including an interaction term between time and a dummy variable for whether states enacted 
mandatory screening.14
Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp) was used for all analyses. Results for regression coefficients 
other than interaction terms were reported as significant based on a .05 level of significance 
using a 2-sided test; P<.10 was used to assess interaction terms.
Sensitivity and Falsification Analyses
In sensitivity analyses, 3 alternative age periods for deaths were used: 24 hours to 12 months 
of age, birth to age 6 months, and birth to 12 months. The analysis also was modified to 
exclude deaths among very preterm births (<32 weeks of gestation). In addition, separate 
coefficients were estimated for 2 early-adopter states that implemented screening mandates 
in August 2011 and January 2012 and 6 states that later implemented mandates from August 
2012 through May 2013.
Falsification or placebo analyses were conducted by repeating the primary analysis with 
outcome measures presumed to be unrelated to the policy. The leading causes of infant 
deaths other than congenital malformations were grouped into 4 categories: sudden infant 
death syndrome, bacterial sepsis, maternal and placental complications, and disorders of 
short gestation and low birth weight (ICD-10 codes listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement). 
Each was defined as deaths occurring between 24 hours and 6 months after birth. Neonatal 
sepsis can be detected through pulse oximetry screening, and deaths from sepsis could 
therefore potentially be affected by critical congenital heart disease screening18; the other 3 
categories were assumed to be unrelated to screening.
Results
Between August 31, 2011, and June 1, 2013, 8 states implemented mandatory critical 
congenital heart disease screening policies. Five states adopted nonmandatory screening 
policies and 9 states adopted mandatory screening policies during that period but had not yet 
implemented the mandates by June 1, 2013 (Table 1).
The timing of implementation of screening policies was first compared with trends in death 
rates at a national level. Less than 1% of infants born during 2011 were born in states with 
screening mandates, which increased to 5.6% in 2012 and 16.3% in 2013. Between 2007 
and 2013, there were 2734 deaths from critical congenital heart disease and 3967 deaths 
from other/unspecified congenital cardiac causes. For the period 2007–2012, there was a 
modest average annual exponential decline in the rates of early infant death due to critical 
congenital heart disease by 2.8% per year (from 11.1 [95% CI, 10.1–12.1] per 100000 [n = 
478] births in 2007 to 9.7 [95% CI, 8.7–10.6] per 100 000 [n = 382] in 2012) (Table 2). 
Similarly, the rate of other/unspecified defects declined by an exponential 1.8% per year 
(from 14.8 [95% CI, 13.7–16.0] per 100000 [n = 640] births in 2007 to 13.4 [95% CI, 12.2–
14.5] per 100 000 [n = 529] in 2012). In contrast, between 2012 and 2013, rates of death due 
to critical congenital heart disease and other/unspecified cardiac causes decreased by 16.8% 
to 8.0 (95% CI, 7.2–8.9) per 100 000 (n = 316) and by 13.2% to 11.6 (95% CI, 10.6–12.7) 
per 100 000 (n = 457), respectively. The critical congenital heart disease and other/

 unspecified cardiac death rates for births in states with no screening policy did not change 
over time. In 2013, the critical congenital heart disease death rate was 10.6 (95% CI, 8.6–
12.5) per 100 000 births (n = 117) and the other/unspecified cardiac death rate was 14.6 
(95% CI, 12.416.9) per 100 000 births (n = 162) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
States that implemented mandatory critical congenital heart disease screening policies 
during the study period had mean critical congenital heart disease death rates before 
adoption that were lower than in states without any screening policy or that adopted only 
nonmandatory policies (Table 3 and Figure). However, critical congenital heart disease death 
rates were not trending downward in states that adopted mandatory policies prior to the 
adoption of mandates, and there was no decrease in critical congenital heart disease deaths 
during the intervening months between adoption and implementation. In contrast, a mean 
50% decrease in critical congenital heart disease death rates occurred following 
implementation. The adoption of nonmandatory screening policies was not associated with a 
reduction in critical congenital heart disease deaths.
Relative to states with no mandatory screening policies, the mean adjusted relative decline in 
critical congenital heart disease deaths during months with mandatory screening policies in 
place was 33.4% (95% CI, 10.6%–50.3%), with an absolute decrease of 3.9 (95% CI, 3.6–
4.1) deaths per 100000 births (Table 4 and eTable 4 in the Supplement). The mean relative 
decrease in other/unspecified cardiac deaths was 21.4% (95% CI, 6.9%–33.7%), with an 
absolute decline of 3.5 (95% CI, 3.2–3.8) deaths per 100 000 births. These were derived 
from the Poisson regression coefficients in the regression models (eTable 2 in the 
Supplement). The adjusted declines in death rates for birth cohorts born under 
nonmandatory policies relative to birth cohorts in states with no screening policies were 
smaller and not statistically significant (eTable 2).
No evidence of nonparallel trends was found in critical congenital heart disease and other 
cardiac infant deaths prior to the adoption of mandatory screening policies. The coefficients 
for the interaction terms of time and screening mandates were essentially zero (−0.001; 95% 
CI, −0.008 to 0.006 for critical congenital heart disease deaths) (eTable 5 in the 
Supplement).
In a sensitivity analysis that allowed for differential associations with early and late adoption 
of screening mandates, the magnitude of the reduction in critical congenital heart disease 
deaths was smaller in the 2 states (New Jersey and Indiana) that implemented mandates prior 
to July 2012. The point estimate of the relative reduction in critical congenital heart disease 
deaths in those 2 states was 19.7% (95% CI, 3.1%–37.7%), and the absolute decrease was 
1.9 (95% CI, 1.5–2.3) per 100 000 births. In comparison, the mean relative decrease in the 
remaining 6 states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and 
Virginia) was 53.5% (95% CI, 36.0%–66.3%) (Table 4), and the absolute decrease was 4.6 
(95% CI, 4.2–5.0) per 100000 births (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
In other sensitivity analyses, results for the percentage of critical congenital heart disease 
deaths avoided by mandatory screening policies were robust to different temporal cut-offs 
for deaths. Point estimates of the reduction ranged from 28.4% to 30.7% of all infant critical

 congenital heart disease deaths relative to the baseline (Table 4). The absolute decreases 
ranged from 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0–3.4) per 100 000 births to 4.1 (95% CI, 3.9–4.4) per 100 000 
births for infant deaths prior to 6 months (eTables 4 and 6 in the Supplement). The estimated 
reductions in other congenital cardiac deaths were statistically significant in analyses of 
deaths from birth to 6 or 12 months.
Results of the falsification analyses showed no association of mandatory or nonmandatory 
critical congenital heart disease screening policies with changes in any other type of early 
infant deaths (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Implementation of policies requiring critical congenital heart disease screening by June 1, 
2013, in 8 states was associated with a 33.4% reduction in early infant deaths due to 
recognized critical congenital heart disease. The reduction in early infant deaths due to 
critical congenital heart disease including deaths occurring in the first 24 hours was 30.7%; 
the smaller relative reduction in that analysis likely reflects that screening at 24 hours cannot 
avert deaths during the first 24 hours. The relative reduction in critical congenital heart 
disease deaths exceeded 50% for 6 states implementing mandates from July 1, 2012, to June 
1, 2013. These findings support the policies implemented by states to require critical 
congenital heart disease screening.
The goal of critical congenital heart disease screening is to reduce the number of deaths due 
to missed or late diagnoses. Previously published US estimates suggested that pulse 
oximetry could prevent 20 to 100 infant deaths from critical congenital heart disease each 
year.5,19,20 For example, a California study reported a mean of 10 deaths per year during 
1989–2004 among infants with missed critical congenital heart disease diagnoses, equivalent 
to 70 preventable deaths each year in the United States.20 A one-third reduction from the 
baseline of 350 to 380 critical congenital heart disease infant deaths per year would imply 
120 fewer deaths per year if mandatory screening were implemented nationwide. A previous 
cost-effectiveness analysis that assumed that 20 deaths would be averted each year by 
universal critical congenital heart disease screening in the United States calculated an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 385 per life-year gained (in 2011 US dollars).9 
The present results suggest a lower cost per life-year gained.
In addition to the estimated decrease in deaths classified as due to critical congenital heart 
disease, there was a significant reduction in other early infant cardiac deaths. This reduction 
may represent cases of critical congenital heart disease that were given a nonspecific ICD-10 
code on the death certificate or cases of noncritical cardiac defects that might have been 
detected as a result of screening.6,18
This study has several strengths. First, the difference-indifferences study design controls for 
underlying trends in factors influencing infant cardiac deaths. Second, falsification studies 
demonstrated that mandatory critical congenital heart disease screening policies were 
unrelated to the occurrence of early infant deaths attributed to the leading noncardiac causes 
of infant mortality in the United States. If the analysis had found significant associations of

 critical congenital heart disease screening policies with infant deaths that are not causally 
related to hypoxemia, that would have called into question the meaningfulness of the 
associations found with cardiac deaths. One group of noncardiac early infant deaths, 
associated with pneumonia or sepsis, is related to hypoxemia.18,21 Although the present 
study found no significant reduction in deaths coded for pneumonia or sepsis associated with 
US policies to screen for critical congenital heart disease around 24 hours after birth, an 
association between pulse oximetry screening and a reduction in neonatal deaths from 
pneumonia or sepsis cannot be ruled out if such screening were conducted immediately after 
birth or in countries where the mortality burden is larger.
Because almost all US states have adopted policies recommending or requiring screening for 
critical congenital heart disease,13 the findings of this study are not intended to inform 
further state policies. Nonetheless, retrospective evaluations of regulatory policies are 
important to validate the projected benefits of policies.22 In addition, lessons learned from 
policy evaluations in one country can inform policy decisions in other countries. In 
particular, the findings have implications for countries that are considering the possible 
adoption of a policy to routinely screen newborns for critical congenital heart disease.23
Limitations
This study had limitations. First, the classification of deaths using ICD-10 codes may not be 
exact (eg, code Q20.3 may include other types of transposition of the great arteries); 
therefore, a few deaths classified as due to critical congenital heart disease may have been 
associated with other malformations. Second, the study may not have included all important 
confounders in the regression modeling analyses. Third, the estimates were imprecise due to 
small numbers of infant critical congenital heart disease deaths by state and month and the 
small number of states with fully implemented screening mandates by June 1, 2013. 
Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution, and replication with additional 
years of data is needed.
Fourth, there was a lack of information on actual screening practices by hospitals within a 
state because many states do not require hospitals to report screening to state health 
departments.12 Not all hospitals necessarily screened for critical congenital heart disease 
after screening mandates had been implemented, and hospitals in states without a screening 
policy may have screened. The study design may be subject to the “ecological fallacy” 
because actual screening practices were not observed. However, this was an ecological 
analysis of screening policies, not screening practices, and the study design was appropriate 
for the study purpose. Screening policies may not necessarily entirely account for the effect 
of screening practices. For example, screening mandates might result in increased clinical 
detection of infants with critical congenital heart disease as a consequence of increased 
clinical awareness of the importance of prompt detection.
Fifth, although efforts were made to ascertain exact dates of implementation of screening 
policies, there was a lack of documentation for some states. To the extent that uptake of 
screening was incomplete, despite the existence of mandates, the estimates in this study may 
have understated the association with mandates that are effectively enforced. Conversely, 
hospitals may have implemented screening voluntarily in the absence of a state policy, with 
Abouk et al.

 some hospitals implementing screening well before 2011.24 Widespread screening in states 
without screening policies would lessen the estimated effectiveness of screening policies. 
The large decreases in death rates in 2013 might represent the wider implementation of 
mandated screening as well as voluntary screening practices.
Sixth, there was a lack of information on the timing of critical congenital heart disease 
diagnoses. Such information would be needed to assess the effect of screening policies on 
the occurrence of late or missed critical congenital heart disease diagnoses. To conduct 
comprehensive evaluation of the effects of critical congenital heart disease screening 
policies, state based birth defects registries linked to screening records could be useful.12
Seventh, lack of state-level information was lacking on the availability of pediatric 
cardiology care facilities or the practice of prenatal critical congenital heart disease 
diagnosis. Both of these variables could influence numbers of critical congenital heart 
disease deaths and the effects of screening policies on deaths.25,26 Prenatal detection for 
many types of critical congenital heart disease remains low in the United States.8 
Improvements in prenatal diagnosis of critical congenital heart disease can be expected to 
diminish the effect of screening on critical congenital heart disease death rates by reducing 
the numbers of children with undiagnosed disease that could be diagnosed as a result of 
postnatal screening. The same caveat applies to improvements in clinical care.
Conclusions
Statewide implementation of mandatory policies for newborn screening for critical 
congenital heart disease was associated with a significant decrease in infant cardiac deaths 
between 2007 and 2013 compared with states without these policies.

 Key Points
Question
Were mandatory state newborn screening policies for critical congenital heart disease 
using pulse oximetry associated with a decrease in infant cardiac deaths?
Findings
In this observational study conducted between 2007 and 2013 including approximately 
27 million US births, state adoption of a mandatory screening policy was associated with 
a statistically significant decline of 33.4% in the death rate due to critical congenital heart 
disease compared with states without such policies.
Meaning
Mandatory screening policies were associated with a reduction in infant deaths due to 
critical congenital heart disease.

Screening Policies as of June 1, 2013
Error bars indicate 95% CIs. State policies were assessed as of June 1, 2013. Observations 
are from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; Alabama had a nonmandatory policy but 
enacted a mandatory policy later so is included in both groups.

aThe mean monthly death rates for critical congenital heart disease and other/unspecified congenital heart disease were calculated by dividing total numbers of deaths of each type by total number of births and total number of state-months. These are not necessarily identical to 
the ratio of the mean number of monthly deaths and the mean number of monthly births. State-month periods with either voluntary screening policies enacted or mandatory screening policies that had been enacted but not yet implemented are included in the columns of 
nonmandatory policy states.
bObservations are from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
cDefined as deaths that occurred 24 hours to less than 6 months after birth.
dAlabama had a nonmandatory policy but enacted a mandatory policy that was not implemented by June 1, 2013.

aPercentage declines are derived from Poisson regression coefficients. Those regression models include all explanatory variables listed in eTable 2 
in the Supplement in addition to state and month-year fixed effects. Numbers in parentheses are clustered confidence intervals at state level to 
capture non independence of observations in the same state. Poisson regression coefficients for the association with deaths from 24 hours to less 
than 6 months of age are presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
