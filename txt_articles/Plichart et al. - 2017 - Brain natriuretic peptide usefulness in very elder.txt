Methods
and results
A total of 383 patients aged 80 years or older, hospitalized in geriatrics care for dyspnoea, had a BNP measurement at
the acute phase. Independent cardiologists blinded to BNP values classified the patients into cardiac vs. respiratory
aetiology according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Mean (SD) age was 88.5 (5.4) years, 66%
(n = 254) of patients were women, 62% (n = 238) had cardiac dyspnoea and 38% (n = 145) had respiratory dyspnoea.
The BNP levels were significantly higher in the cardiac group (median = 385.5 ng/L, interquartile range = 174.0–842.0)
than in the respiratory group (median = 172.0 ng/L, interquartile range = 70.8–428.0; P < 0.001). On its own, BNP
showed poor discriminative ability [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.73]
for the diagnostic. In multivariate analysis, BNP remained independently associated with the cardiac aetiology after
full-adjustment (odds ratio 1 log increase = 1.87; 95% CI 1.28–2.74), but did not improve the discrimination between
the cardiac and the respiratory aetiologies (ΔAUC = 0.013, P = 0.16). In addition, although adding BNP to the other
predictive covariates yielded a significant continuous NRI of 57.8% (95% CI 31.2–83.5%), the mean changes in
individual predicted probabilities were too low (<3%) to be clinically relevant.

Introduction
The use of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is included in current
guidelines for heart failure (HF) diagnosis and management because
of its high specificity and sensitivity in screening patients with acute
dyspnoea. Among younger and middle-aged patients presenting

levels increase with advancing age and among women.5,
6 Some
previous studies have suggested the significance of natriuretic
peptides (NPs) for the diagnosis of acute dyspnoea in elderly
patients.7–11 However, the optimal cut-off level for ruling out HF
in elderly patients with other co-morbidities remains unclear.12
Notably, none of these previous studies have addressed the use-
fulness of BNP levels in acute settings among very old patients
(>80 years) with multiple co-morbidities in geriatric settings. Fur-
thermore, all of these studies have used the area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the sole discrimination
index, although it might be complemented by more recent indexes,
such as the net reclassification index (NRI) and Integrated Discrim-
ination Index (IDI).13,
14
Our objective was therefore to provide new information in the
field of acute HF diagnosis among geriatric patients, by evaluating
the usefulness of BNP for HF diagnosis in acute dyspnoea among
patients aged 80 years or older participating in the BED Study (BNP
Usefulness In Elderly Dyspnoeic Patients).
Methods
Population
The patients were prospectively recruited in acute geriatric wards
from seven University Hospitals from June 2007 to February 2011.
Patients aged 80 years or older, presenting acute dyspnoea (rest-
ing dyspnoea, orthopnoea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) or
hypoxaemia (peripheral oxygen saturation <90%) were eligible. The
availability of an echocardiographic assessment within the first 72 h
was also required for eligibility. Patients who were not covered by a
health insurance, participating in a therapeutic trial, or refusing blood
tests were not included. All patients received a written information
note on the study and gave their oral consent. The protocol has been
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection
des Personnes—Ile de France I).
Baseline data collection
Data were collected by the practitioners (blinded to BNP values) that
were in charge of the patients, using a standardized questionnaire and
included socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, physical
examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, current medications,
results of usual blood tests, chest X-rays, and echocardiography.
Plasma brain natriuretic peptide level
measurement
Plasma BNP level was independently assessed at baseline blindly
from other clinical and biological data and before initiation of intra-
venous loop-diuretic therapy. A venous blood sample was taken after
15 minutes of rest in a supine position, and collected in ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (5 mm3). The BNP was mea-
sured immediately with the immunofluorometric triage method from
BIOSITE (Biosite Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Because the study was
performed in geriatric departments that were at times distant from
the biochemistry laboratory, we assumed that measuring BNP locally
and immediately would minimize uncertainty regarding blood sample

handling and the delay of BNP measurement caused by blood sam-
ple transfers to another department or laboratory. The intra-assay
coefficients of variation (CV) were assessed at different BNP plasma
concentrations in 10 patients for two thresholds of BNP 90–110 ng/L
and 360–440 ng/L. At 100 ng/L threshold the CV was 9.7% and 7.8%
for the 400 ng/L threshold. All results for BNP were not disclosed to
the clinicians and the cardiologist during the whole study.
Heart failure diagnosis
Heart failure diagnosis was determined blindly to BNP by the referent
cardiologist of each centre, according to the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) guidelines1 based on relevant data, including past and
present medical history, physical examination findings on admission,
ECG, in-hospital treatment, routine blood tests, reading of the chest
radiograph, echocardiography (performed during the first 72 h) results
and review of patient’
s response to therapy. Altered and preserved left
ventricular functions were defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) <50% or LVEF ≥50%, respectively.
Non cardiac dyspnoea
Patients who were not classified as having HF were categorized as
having either pure respiratory dyspnoea or mixed dyspnoea whenever
the available information showed both features from cardiac and
respiratory dyspnoea. At last, ‘
mixed-dyspnoea’patients were further
reclassified in cardiac or respiratory dyspnoea according to the most
predominant feature after careful reviewing of all available data.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, bivariate associations and diagnosis
utilities
Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables are presented as
mean (standard deviation, SD) but were log-transformed for statistical
analyses when appropriate. Categorical variables are presented as
percentages (n). The baseline characteristics of the participants were
compared by the final diagnosis and by plasma BNP level (median
cut-off = 293 ng/mL) using by Student’
s t-tests and by a chi-square test
for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Non-parametric
tests were used when appropriate.
Diagnostic utilities were calculated using the sensitivity, specificity,
negative and positive predictive values, and negative and positive likeli-
hood ratios (LR). The ROC curves were computed using the cardiol-
ogist diagnosis as the reference and the area under the curve (AUC)
was estimated. The grey-zone method was used for determining the
optimal BNP cut-off for ruling-in and ruling-out HF.15 Briefly, this simple
method consists of building a three-zone partition for quantitative tests
results, including a grey zone between positive and negative conclusions
about the condition tested (in this case HF). The estimation of the grey
zone limits requires computing the positive and the negative LR for
each value of the test (in this case BNP values) and then to retain LR
values that ensure a post-test probability for ruling out (post-test prob-
ability <0.05) and ruling in (post-test probability >0.95) the diagnosis.
Multivariate and reclassification analyses
The relationship between potential predictive variables and the diag-
nosis of acute HF was assessed by logistic models with random effects
for the study centre. The first model (model 1) included age, gen-
der, study centre, factors known to influence BNP levels [body mass

from the bivariate analysis and that remained independently associated
with the diagnostic group in the fully-adjusted model (P ≤ 0.05). Model
1 finally included age, gender, study centre, BMI, GFR, history of HF
(y/n), chronic respiratory disease (y/n), bilateral pulmonary crepitations
(y/n), rhonchi (y/n), diffuse alveolar/interstitial oedema on chest X-ray
(y/n), atrial fibrillation on ECG (y/n), LVEF (<50% vs. ≥50%) and leu-
cocyte count. Model 2 further included log-transformed BNP level at
baseline.
The added value of BNP for HF diagnosis was evaluated by compar-
ing the discrimination power of the final model without BNP (model
1) and with BNP (model 2). We compared the AUC between the
two models using an appropriate test for non-independent data.16 For
reclassification, we computed the continuous NRI and IDI associated
with the addition of BNP to the model 1.17
Regarding the multivariate analyses, a total of 145 patients had
missing values for ≥1 covariate (mainly owing to missing height)

exclusion of patients with dyspnoea of mixed origin did not change
our findings, those latter were further reclassified as having cardiac
(n = 44) and respiratory (n = 47) dyspnoea, yielding samples of 238
for cardiac dyspnoea and 145 for respiratory dyspnoea.
For the multivariate analysis, 145 patients had missing values
for ≥1 covariate selected for the models. Compared with the
238 patients with complete observations, those were more likely
to die (50.3% vs. 38.2%, P < 0.001), had lower peripheral oxygen
saturation (mean ± SD: 90.3 ± 7.2% vs. 92.7 ± 4.8%; P = 0.001), and
were more likely to have focal pulmonary condensation (29.6% vs.
18.1%; P = 0.01). Nevertheless, patients with missing data did not
differ from those with complete observations regarding the BNP
level [median (interquartile range, IQR): 293 (123–714) ng/ml vs.
286 (107–639) ng/ml; P = 0.99) and the diagnostic group (cardiac

tivariate analyses was thus 156 for cardiac dyspnoea and 86 for
respiratory dyspnoea.
Patient characteristics across diagnostic
groups and brain natriuretic peptide
levels
The mean age was (± SD) 88.5 ± 5.4 years and comprised 66.3% of
women. As shown in Table 1, patients with dyspnoea of cardiac ori-
gin were more likely to have hypertension, past history of cardio-
vascular disease, higher BMI, ECG abnormalities, lower LVEF, high
frequency of cardiovascular treatments (angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and
beta-blockers) than those with dyspnoea of respiratory origin.

Compared with the cardiac origin, respiratory dyspnoea was
associated with chronic respiratory disease, higher respiratory
rate, higher body temperature, lower peripheral oxygen satura-
tion, higher blood leucocyte count and higher C-reactive protein
levels (Table 1). The BNP levels were significantly higher in the
cardiac group (mediancardiac = 385.5 ng/L, IQR = 174.0–842.0 ng/L)
than
in
the
respiratory
group
(medianrespiratory = 172.0 ng/L,
IQR = 70.8–428.0 ng/L; P < 0.001).
Finally, patients with higher baseline BNP were more likely to
have a history of HF, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, lower
BMI, more frequent clinical and chest X-ray HF features, ECG
abnormalities, lower LVEF, cardiovascular treatments (diuretics,
beta-blockers) and lower GFR than those with lower baseline BNP
levels (not shown).
Association between brain natriuretic
peptide levels and diagnosis group
After adjustment for age, gender, and study centre, higher BNP was
associated with an increased odd of HF [OR1 log increase = 1.77, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.46–2.14; P < 0.001]. This association
was similar after full adjustment (OR1 log increase = 1.87, 95% CI
1.28–2.74; P = 0.001). Among the other covariates, higher BMI,
history of HF, bilateral pulmonary crepitations, alveolo-interstitial
syndrome on chest X-ray, and lower LEVF were associated with
HF, whereas chronic respiratory disease, rhonchi, and higher blood
leukocyte counts were associated with a respiratory aetiology
(Figure 2).
No interaction was found between BNP levels, the diagno-
sis group and age (Pinteraction = 0.72), gender (Pinteraction = 0.44),
BMI (Pinteraction = 0.36), GFR (Pinteraction = 0.65), history of HF
(Pinteraction = 0.41), chronic respiratory failure (Pinteraction = 0.93),
LVEF (Pinteraction = 0.65) and atrial fibrillation recorded on ECG
(Pinteraction = 0.65).
Diagnostic performance of brain
natriuretic peptide for heart failure
The sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive values, and
negative/positive LR are summarized in Table 2, for different BNP
cut-offs. The ‘
optimal’threshold for ‘
ruling-out’(e.g. for reaching
90% sensitivity) the HF diagnosis was 67 ng/L, while 90% specificity

was achieved for a BNP level of 828 ng/L. Furthermore, no cut-off
value was found according to the grey-zone method, e.g. to
ensure post-test probabilities of HF <0.05 and >0.95, respectively
(Table 3).
It was found that BNP alone was poorly discriminant for the
diagnosis of HF (AUC = 0.68; 95% CI 0.62–0.73). Similarly, adding
BNP to the fully adjusted model including age, gender, BMI and
independent covariates identified in our study, did not improve the
AUC (from 0.915 to 0.928; P = 0.13; Figure 3).
The reclassification analysis yielded both a significant continuous
NRI as 57.8% (95% CI 31.2–83.5%; P < 0.001) and a statistically
significant IDI (IDI = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.07; P = 0.01). However,
taking into account BNP beyond the other predictive factors
resulted in very low mean changes in predicted probabilities [mean
(SD) changecardiac = 0.014 (0.07); mean (SD) changerespiratory = 0.027
(0.12)] (Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
Among patients with ‘
pure’ diagnostic of cardiac dyspnoea
or respiratory dyspnoea, excluding subjects with dyspnoea of
mixed origin (n = 292; ncardiac dyspnoea = 194; nrespiratory dyspnoea = 98),
higher BNP was associated with increased odds of HF diagnosis
(fully adjusted OR1 log increase = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.59; P = 0.08)
although the association became borderline significant. The OR
for HF diagnostic in patients with mixed diagnostic (n = 91;
nmostly cardiac dyspnoea = 44; nmostly respiratory dyspnoea = 47) was 3.48 (95%
CI 1.14–10.63; P = 0.03). As in the main analysis, BNP was not
useful for discriminating (Table 3) and reclassifying patients in the
pure (ΔAUC = 0.001, P = 0.76) or in the mixed (ΔAUC = 0.017,
P = 0.15) group.
Similar results were found using the imputed dataset regarding
the association of BNP with the HF diagnosis (OR1 log increase = 1.47,
95% CI 1.21–1.93; P = 0.005) and also for both the discrimination
(ΔAUC = 0.007, P = 0.21) and the reclassification analysis (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study of very elderly patients with acute dyspnoea hospi-
talized in geriatrics care, although being independently associated
with HF, BNP was poorly discriminant for the aetiological diagnos-
tic of acute dyspnoea (e.g. cardiac vs. respiratory) using various
discrimination and reclassification methods.

Pure diagnosis: patients who were adjudicated as having only either cardiac or respiratory dyspnoea by the referent cardiologist. Mixed diagnosis: patients who had both
features from cardiac and respiratory origin after review of all relevant data by the referent cardiologist. The cardiac or respiratory diagnosis was determined blindly to BNP
level.

The importance of NPs in very elderly patients remains a matter
of debate. Some previous studies have suggested the utility of NPs
for the diagnosis of acute dyspnoea in elderly patients,7–11 or for
prognostic stratification.20
Others studies suggest that in contrast to younger patients
NPs are not useful for optimizing HF treatment 21,
22 after 75 years
of age.
Our results were in line with those reported in these stud-
ies regarding sensitivity for HF diagnosis (sensitivity ≈90% for
a BNP threshold around 100 ng/L). However, a 90% specificity
was achieved for a higher BNP level of 800 ng/mL, instead of
400 ng/mL in the previous reports. However, no BNP cut-off
value was found to ensure post-test probabilities of HF <0.05
and >0.95, respectively, using the grey-zone method developed by
Coste et al.15

for the diagnosis of HF.23 This was not unexpected as key factors
known to reduce the specificity of NPs for HF, such as high preva-
lence of preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, impaired
renal function, and extreme age, were prominent in our study
population. Very old patients, and especially those hospitalized in
acute settings, often have many acute or chronic conditions, such
as other cardiac (atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, hyper-
tension, etc.) or non-cardiac conditions (renal failure, chronic res-
piratory disease, pneumonia, sepsis, etc.), that could influence BNP
levels.4,
12,
24 Similarly, multiple comorbid conditions might interfere
with the discrimination ability of BNP in this particular population
as the raw AUCs (e.g. using BNP alone) were higher (≥0.80) in
the younger patients of the previous studies than in the present
work (0.68). Interestingly, a recent study assessed the utility of
BNP for the diagnosis of chronic stable HF among very elderly
nursing-home residents with multiple co-morbidities and reported
a lower AUC (0.73)23 than was found in younger patients.7–10
Furthermore, all of these studies used the area under the ROC
curve as the sole discrimination index, although more recent
indexes may complement this.13,
14 In addition, the effect of poten-
tial confounding factors has not always been taken into account
in an integrated way in these previous reports. In the BED study,
we assessed the incremental value of BNP using three indexes of
discrimination, including the AUC, the NRI, and the IDI indices,
from multivariate models including factors associated with both
the diagnostic and the BNP levels and reflecting the complexity
of acute geriatric patients.25 Although BNP yielded statistically sig-
nificant reclassification indexes, changes in predicted probabilities
were too small to be relevant in clinical practice. This might be
explained by the fact that our initial model (model 1, without BNP)
was already highly discriminant, with an AUC above 0.90, and thus
required a very strongly associated biomarker to influence the pre-
dicted risk with greater magnitude.14,
26 Notably, our results were
quite similar regardless of the population sample studied (overall,
pure diagnostic or mixed diagnostic) and we found no interaction
with various predefined covariates such as age, gender, GFR, his-
tory of HF, chronic respiratory failure, LVEF, and atrial fibrillation,
suggesting the robustness of our findings.
Some limitations should be acknowledged in the present work.
Unfortunately, we did not assess the other NPs used in clinical
practice for the diagnostic of HF, namely the N-terminal pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). However, there is no clear

evidence that one NP is superior to the other for the diagnosis
of HF in clinical settings, especially in the elderly.4,
7–10,
12
In the context of acute dyspnoea, echocardiographic assessment
should ideally be performed within the first 48 h.1 However,
owing to logistic constraints of a geriatric setting, we had to
choose a slightly wider time-window (72 h). Furthermore, despite
international guideline recommendations, echocardiography is still
underused for the diagnostic of acute HF.27 This is particularly
true among octogenarians who are even less likely to undergo
echocardiography.28
Although the final diagnosis was made according to the ESC
guidelines, we acknowledge the difficulty of finding a ‘
gold stan-
dard’ for diagnosing HF in our population of very old patients.
Indeed, most clinical practice guidelines focus on distinct diseases
and/or conditions with narrow and well-defined phenotypes. In typ-
ical geriatric clinical practice, hospitalized patients often present
multiple acute illnesses and it may therefore be difficult to classify
into one single diagnostic category.25,
29 Regardless of this issue, the
present study exposes a major common fact of clinical ‘
real life’in
elderly patients. Furthermore, the systematic use of echocardiog-
raphy and the geriatric expertise of our referent cardiologists are
likely to minimize such a bias. In addition, our results were similar
with and without the patients with dyspnoea of mixed origin.
One hundred and forty-five patients had missing values for at
least one covariate and could not be included in the multivariate
analyses. The missing covariates were mainly height, LVEF, and
to a lesser extent chest X-ray. As pointed out in the Results
section, the patients with missing covariates were more severely
ill and potentially unstable. Under emergency conditions some
non-critical information such as height may not have been recorded
and some patients died before they could undergo chest X-ray or
echocardiography. However, the ‘
missing data’status was neither
associated with the BNP level nor with the diagnostic group,
suggesting that this potential issue had no or very little influence
on our findings.
Despite its excellent discriminative ability (AUC >0.90) and its
‘
clinical consistency’
, our risk-prediction model is not necessarily
generalizable to the whole geriatric population. Furthermore,
some covariates known to be associated with NP levels (e.g. age,
gender, and hypertension) were not found to be related to BNP
in the present study. Nevertheless, it is difficult to extrapolate
findings from younger populations to our very old patients as the
prevalence of these factors is very high and their effect on BNP
level remain unclear in this particular population.
Conclusion and perspectives
In this study of very elderly patients with acute dyspnoea, although
independently associated with HF, assessment of BNP in the acute
phase was not useful compared with the regular clinical, biological
and imaging assessment to better discriminate the cardiac vs. the
respiratory origin of the dyspnoea.
As this is the first study combining a multivariate approach
and using the recently developed discrimination/reclassification
indexes, we think that our findings need to be replicated in other
older populations.

In conclusion, BNP does not seem to be useful as diagnostic
tool for the clinician among very elderly patients with acute
dyspnoea. However, NPs may still be of interest for the prognosis
of HF. Furthermore, recent innovations in HF treatment, with
the development of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors,30
will probably lead to a rethinking of the place of plasma NPs the
assessment of HF.
