Abstract
Background: Future cancer immunotherapies will combine multiple treatments to generate functional immune
responses to cancer antigens through synergistic, multi-modal mechanisms. In this study we explored the combination
of three distinct immunotherapies: a class I restricted peptide-based cancer vaccine, metronomic cyclophosphamide
(mCPA) and anti-PD-1 treatment in a murine tumor model expressing HPV16 E7 (C3).
Methods: Mice were implanted with C3 tumors subcutaneously. Tumor bearing mice were treated with mCPA
(20 mg/kg/day PO) for seven continuous days on alternating weeks, vaccinated with HPV16 E749-57 peptide antigen
formulated in the DepoVax (DPX) adjuvanting platform every second week, and administered anti-PD-1 (200 μg/dose IP)
after each vaccination. Efficacy was measured by following tumor growth and survival. Immunogenicity was measured
by IFN-γ ELISpot of spleen, vaccine draining lymph nodes and tumor draining lymph nodes. Tumor infiltration was
measured by flow cytometry for CD8α+ peptide-specific T cells and RT-qPCR for cytotoxic proteins. The clonality of
tumor infiltrating T cells was measured by TCRβ sequencing using genomic DNA.
Results: Untreated C3 tumors had low expression of PD-L1 in vivo and anti-PD-1 therapy alone provided no protection
from tumor growth. Treatment with DPX/mCPA could delay tumor growth, and tri-therapy with DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1
provided long-term control of tumors. We found that treatment with DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 enhanced systemic
antigen-specific immune responses detected in the spleen as determined by IFN-γ ELISpot compared to those in
the DPX/mCPA group, but immune responses in tumor-draining lymph nodes were not increased. Although no
increases in antigen-specific CD8α+ TILs could be detected, there was a trend for increased expression of cytotoxic
genes within the tumor microenvironment as well as an increase in clonality in mice treated with DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1 compared to those with anti-PD-1 alone or DPX/mCPA. Using a library of antigen-specific CD8α+ T cell
clones, we found that antigen-specific clones were more frequently expanded in the DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1
treated group.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate how the efficacy of anti-PD-1 may be improved by combination with
a potent and targeted T cell activating immune therapy.

 Background
Immune based cancer treatments are beginning to show
promise in clinical trials and have already begun to inte-
grate into the standard of care for multiple indications,
with many others sure to follow. Different types of
immune therapies have complimentary mechanisms of
action, and when combined rationally could be used to
overcome complex immune suppressive networks uti-
lized by tumors [1]. Cancer vaccines generate active and
targeted immune responses, and could be a cornerstone
of these combinations [2, 3].
DepoVax™ (DPX) is a water free lipid-in-oil vaccine
formulation with demonstrated ability to enhance re-
sponses to peptide vaccines in animals and in human
clinical trials [4–6]. The DPX formulation utilizes lipids
to effectively combine multiple peptide or protein anti-
gens and adjuvants into an oil phase, resulting in a for-
mulation that uniquely provides a long lasting and
immunogenic depot in vivo [7]. Peptides formulated in
DPX generate a stronger antigen-specific immunity
compared to other types of emulsion-based depot form-
ing vaccine platforms (unpublished data). Previously, we
evaluated metronomic cyclophosphamide (mCPA) as
an immune modulator with DPX vaccination in a pre-
clinical tumor model [6]. We found that the treatment
combination provided enhanced therapeutic control of
tumors, which could be attributed to an enrichment in
the expansion of vaccine-induced antigen specific CD8+
T cells. These results were translated to a Phase 1/1b
clinical trial evaluating DPX-Survivac, a DPX vaccine
containing multiple peptide antigens derived from the
tumor associated protein survivin (DPX-Survivac), and
mCPA in advanced ovarian cancer patients [5]. The
immune responses induced by patients treated with
DPX-Survivac and mCPA were significantly higher than
responses induced by patients treated with DPX vaccine
alone. Although CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg)
reduction has been a reported effect of administering
low dose cyclophosphamide, we and others have not
detected any reduction in the Treg population following
administration [5, 8, 9]. Treg depletion is one of many
immune modulating effects attributed to low dose
cyclophosphamide [10], and the effects of the treatment
may be specific to the type of cancer involved. Due of
the multiple effects of cyclophosphamide on the immune
system, combinations with other forms of immune ther-
apy must be individually assessed.
Immune therapies are likely to benefit by combining
multiple agents that target complimentary mechanisms
of the immune system [1, 3]. Although we have demon-
strated that the DPX/mCPA combination is effective in
inducing antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that could effect-
ively control small tumors in our preclinical model, the
efficacy was limited in the treatment of more advanced
tumors [6]. This may be due to increased immune sup-
pression exerted by advanced tumors, and may also be a
barrier for clinical applications. Therefore, in this work
we have explored additional immune therapies that may
enhance the immune response induced by DPX/mCPA
through complimentary mechanisms in order to identify
promising combinations for clinical testing and novel
immune biomarkers. In our preclinical work, programmed
death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
were both increased within the tumor by DPX/mCPA
treatment, corresponding to increases in cytotoxic genes
such as IFN- γ and granzyme B. PD-1 is a co-inhibitory
receptor expressed primarily by activated lymphocytes
which induces tolerance/exhaustion upon interaction with
its ligand PD-L1. The expression of PD-1 on T cells is in-
creased in response to persistent antigen exposure [11].
PD-L1 is frequently upregulated in many tumor types,
particularly in response to IFN-γ, and is a mechanism of
immune suppression used by tumors to escape immune
detection [12, 13]. The biological significance of this
mechanism was demonstrated through the substantial
clinical benefit observed in Phase 3 testing of the anti-PD-
1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab
in patients with advanced cancers, where anti-tumor re-
sponses to these antibodies correlated with the presence
of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) activity [14, 15].
Encouraged by these results, other monoclonal antibodies
and small molecule drugs that block PD-1 signaling are in
various stages of development [16].
Increased PD-1 expression has been correlated with
high mutation load tumors which bear immunogenic
neoantigens [17, 18]. Indeed, within the tumor micro-
environment (TME) of clinical samples, PD-1 expression
is primarily induced on tumor-specific T cells [19, 20].
These
observations
suggest
that
anti-PD-1
therapy
would be most effective in patients that have spontan-
eous tumor-specific immune responses with increased
numbers of TILs, presumably to immunogenic neoanti-
gens [21]. However, this mutation load and these im-
mune responses do not exist in all patients, nor in all
cancer types, to the same extent, therefore anti-PD-1
therapy is not uniformly effective. Using preclinical
models, others have shown that combining anti-PD-1
therapy with vaccination has a synergistic effect in in-
creasing tumor infiltrating immune cells in non-PD-1/
PD-L1 expressing tumors, resulting in better efficacy
[22–24]. It has been postulated that this synergistic ef-
fect may be in part due to expansion of T cell clones
specific to other tumor antigens besides those in the
vaccine, the “epitope spreading” phenomenon [22, 23].
However, this has not been directly evaluated.
In this study, we evaluate the combination of three
distinct immune therapies, DPX vaccination, mCPA and
anti-PD-1, in the HPV16 E7 expressing C3 preclinical

 tumor model. The advantage to using this model is that
there is an immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope,
HPV16E749-57 (R9F), and R9F-specific CD8+ T cells can
be induced by vaccination. This allowed us to evaluate
the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and clonality
using a defined target. Our results provide a mechanistic
rationale for the combination of these therapies to im-
prove treatment of advanced tumors, and also demon-
strate how clonality may be used to assess the quality of
antigen-specific immune responses.
Methods
Mice and tumor implantation
Pathogen-free, 6–8 week old female C57BL/6 mice were
obtained from Charles River Labs (St. Constant, PQ,
Canada). Mice were housed under filter-top conditions
and provided food and water ad libitum.
The C3 cell line, provided by Dr. Martin Kast (USC,
Los Angeles, USA), is derived from C57BL/6 mouse em-
bryo cells transfected to express HPV16 [25]. The C3
tumor line was maintained in IMDM (Gibco) supple-
mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone)
2 % penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 50 mM mercap-
toethanol (Gibco) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco). Mice
were implanted with 3 × 105 C3 tumor cells subcutane-
ously in the left flank.
Tumor growth was measured with digital calipers twice
weekly and tumor volume calculated using the formula
[(width2 × length)/2]. For experiments requiring determi-
nations of survival, endpoint was determined to be when
mice had tumor volumes of ≥2000 mm3, or showed sig-
nificant signs of ill health, such as wasting, severe dehy-
dration, significant decrease in activity and hunched or
prostate posture. When endpoint was determined, mice
were humanely euthanized per CCAC guidelines.
Peptides
All peptides were synthesized by NeoMPS (San Diego,
CA, USA) at >90 % purity. The H2Db peptide epitope
HPV16E749-57 (RAHYNIVTF; R9F) was used in each
study. In some studies, the irrelevant H2Db peptide
epitope WT-1126-134 (RMFPNAPYL; R9L) was used. All
vaccines contained a universal T helper peptide PADRE
(AKXVAAWTLKAA).
Vaccine preparation and immunization
Peptides were formulated in DepoVax vaccines with a
proprietary adjuvant as previously described [26]. Briefly,
peptides and adjuvant were solubilized in appropriate
buffer and mixed with 10:1 (w:w) DOPC/cholesterol
mixture (Lipoid GmBH, Germany) to form liposomes.
The aqueous mixture was lyophilized to a dry cake
which was reconstituted with Montanide ISA51 VG
(SEPPIC, France) just prior to injection. Mice were
vaccinated subcutaneously on the right flank with 50 μl
of vaccine. Each dose of vaccine contained 10 μg R9F
fused to PADRE + 20 μg adjuvant. When multiple vacci-
nations were administered they were given in the same
area but avoiding previous immunization sites.
Cyclophosphamide treatment
Cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was reconstituted in
PBS and provided for seven consecutive days in drinking
water (PO) at 0.133 mg/mL, calculated to deliver 20 mg/kg/
day based on 3 mL water/mouse/day. Water was changed
every 2–3 days. Mice that were treated with cyclophospha-
mide were monitored daily for signs of ill health indicating
adverse reactions to cyclophosphamide treatment.
Antibody treatment
Monoclonal antibodies for in vivo administration were
purchased from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH, USA).
Anti-PD-1 (clone RMP1-14) or isotype control (clone
2A3) was administered as a 200 μg dose by intraperito-
neal injection on days indicted.
IFN-γ ELISpot
IFN-γ ELISpot was performed as described previously [6].
Briefly, mature dendritic cells (DCs) were generated by
culturing bone marrow cells from naïve C57BL/6 mice in
complete RPMI media [RPMI 1640 (Gibco) + 10 % FBS,
2 % penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine
(Gibco), 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and
5 mM HEPEs buffer (Gibco)] supplemented with murine
GM-CSF (Peprotech). DCs were loaded with 20 μg/mL
peptides on day 7. Day 8 DCs were used as antigen pre-
senting cells for ELISPOT and were resuspended in
complete RPMI at 2 × 105 cells/mL.
Right (vaccine draining) and left (tumor draining) in-
guinal lymph nodes were collected from mice upon termin-
ation. Single cell suspensions were prepared in complete
RPMI media and cell concentration adjusted to 2 × 106
cells/mL. Lymph node cells (100 μL) and DCs (100 μL)
were added to IFN-γ ELISpot plates (BD Bioscience).
The ELISpot plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C,
5 % CO2 and then developed the next day using AEC
kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Spots were counted using ELISpot
Reader (C.T.L. Ltd, Shaker Heights, OH, USA) and enu-
merated as number of spot-forming units (SFU) per well.
IFN-γ ELISpot performed using splenocytes had the fol-
lowing modifications. Single cell suspensions of splenocytes
were prepared by lysing RBCs with ammonium-chloride-
potassium solution and resuspending cells at 5 × 106 cells/
mL in complete RPMI media. A volume of 100 μL cells
was added into IFN-γ ELISpot plate and stimulated with
100 μL complete RPMI containing no peptide (background
control), 20 μg/mL R9F or irrelevant peptide, or 5 × 105
cells/mL C3 tumor cells.

 Tumor dissociation
Tumors were extracted from mice upon termination and
chopped into small pieces using a scalpel. Pieces were
transferred into a 15 mL tube containing 5–10 mL of
digestion buffer [1 mg/mL collagenase type 1 (Gibco) +
0.1 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma) in RPMI 1640] and incu-
bated in a shaker at 37 °C for 30 min. Suspensions were
then strained into a new tube through 40 μM filter. Cells
were washed in PBS and used for flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry and FACS
Cells were pre-incubated with normal rat serum to block
non-specific staining. Antibody cocktails were added and
cells incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The following fluoro-
chrome conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were used
CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8α (53.6-7), CD45
(30
F11),
all
purchased
from
eBioscience.
R9F-
dextramer-PE was obtained from Immudex. A FASCcali-
bur (BD Bioscience) was used for acquisition of flow cy-
tometry data and analysis was performed using WinList
7.0 (Verity Software, Topsham, ME, USA). FACS sorting
was performed using a FACSAria III (BD Bioscience)
and FACSDiva 6.0 software.
RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIA-
GEN); 4 μg aliquots were treated with DNAse I (Invitro-
gen) and reverse transcribed using a SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) pri-
mer (Invitrogen). PCR primers for Cd8a, Gzmb, Ifng,
Prf, Tbx21, CD4, Pdcd1, CD274, GATA3 and Gzmb were
designed using Primer-BLAST algorithm (Additional file 1:
Table S1). Amplifications of these transcripts were per-
formed on a Rotor-Gene Q real-time PCR machine using a
QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN). Data were
analyzed based on the standard curve method and normal-
ized against levels of GAPDH mRNA.
TCRβ sequencing
Tumor
genomic
DNA
was
extracted
using
the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). CD8α+ R9F-
specific T cells were purified by FACS using R9F-
dextramer reagent, anti-CD8α and anti-CD3. The cells
were pelleted, frozen at -80 °C and sent to Adaptive
Biotechnologies.
The
TCRβ
locus
was
sequenced
using the ImmunoSEQ survey level assay by Adaptive
Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA). TCRβ sequencing was
analyzed using the ImmunoSEQ Analyzer (Adaptive
Biotechnologies).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism 6
(La Jolla, CA, USA) software. Data was analysed by
appropriate tests as indicated in figure legends. Significance
denoted as: *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.
Results
PD-1 and PD-L1 expression is induced in C3 tumors in
response to infiltration with tumor-specific CD8+ T cells
In our previous work, we detected enhanced expression
of PD-1 mRNA in HPV16 E7 expressing C3 tumors after
treatment with a DPX vaccine containing HPV16E749-57
peptide (DPX-R9F) and mCPA [6]. To evaluate if the
increased PD-1 expression in the tumors was due to in-
creased accumulation of CD8+ T cells, we performed a
flow cytometry analysis on TILs. Mice were implanted
with C3 tumors and were treated with mCPA for seven
consecutive days starting 2 weeks after implantation, at
the time when most tumors become palpable. At the
end of the week, mice were vaccinated once with DPX-
R9F, and all mice were euthanized 8 days later. The
dissociated tumor preparations from treated mice had
significantly increased infiltration by CD45+CD8+ T cells
compared to untreated mice (Fig. 1a). PD-1 expression
on the CD45+CD8+ T cells from these treated mice was
also significantly elevated (Fig. 1b), and yet PD-1 expres-
sion on non-leukocytes (i.e. CD45 negative) was un-
changed (Fig. 1c). Correspondingly, PD-L1 expression on
non-leukocytes was increased in treated mice (Fig. 1d).
Additionally, we found that C3 cells treated in vitro with
IFN-γ increased expression of PD-L1, but not PD-1 or
PD-L2 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
PD-1 blockade enhanced the efficacy of DPX vaccination
with mCPA
To determine if the C3 model was responsive to anti-
PD-1 therapy, C57BL6 mice (n = 10) were implanted
with C3 tumors. Anti-PD-1 therapy, or isotype control,
was initiated 15 days later when tumors were estab-
lished, and administered three times on days 15, 18, and
21. Treatment was repeated 2 weeks later. In our experi-
ence with this model, initiating treatment on these days
provides suboptimal protection from tumor growth
therefore we considered this to represent more advanced
tumors. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, isotype control or
anti-PD-1 therapy provided no delay from tumor growth
or enhanced survival of mice. In a separate experiment,
we also evaluated the combination of mCPA and anti-
PD-1 without vaccination, however this combination did
not provide any significant protection from tumor in this
model (data not shown).
To assess if PD-1 blockade using anti-PD-1 monoclo-
nal antibodies could enhance the efficacy of immuno-
therapy provided by DPX-R9F vaccination and mCPA,
we tested the triple combination therapy in the C3
tumor model in three separate experiments each with
9–10 mice per group. The pooled results are shown in

 Fig. 2c and d. Mice implanted with C3 tumors were
treated with mCPA starting 8 days after implantation.
After 1 week of treatment, on study day 15, mice were
vaccinated with DPX-R9F. Anti-PD-1 was administered
on study days 15, 18 and 21. This treatment was repeated
again 2 weeks later, starting on study day 22. Anti-PD-1 in
combination with DPX-R9F/mCPA immunotherapy re-
sulted in a significant delay in tumor growth and a signifi-
cant increase in mouse survival compared to mice treated
with DPX-R9F/mCPA. Similar results were obtained using
two other tumor models, B16-F10 and HLA-A2+ ovarian
tumors (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
Anti-PD-1 increased the systemic immune response to
DPX vaccination with mCPA
To determine if anti-PD-1 enhanced the efficacy of treat-
ment by increasing the immunogenicity of the vaccine,
we performed an IFN-γ ELISpot assay using C3 tumor
bearing mice. To ensure that mice would have tumors at
the time of evaluation, we started treatment with mCPA
2 weeks after implantation and provided a single vaccin-
ation on day 21 and anti-PD-1 treatment on day 27.
Mice were euthanized on study day 31, which was
10 days after vaccination. In order to characterize the
vaccine-induced immune response, splenocytes, vaccine
draining inguinal lymph node cells and tumor draining
inguinal lymph node cells were assessed separately. The
immune responses detected in the spleen were signifi-
cantly higher when mice were treated with DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1 compared to when mice were treated with
DPX/mCPA (Fig. 3a). In the vaccine draining lymph
nodes, a trend of higher immune responses in the DPX/
mCPA/anti-PD-1 treatment group was observed, but
this increase was not significant (Fig. 3b). In the tumor
draining lymph nodes the immune responses were the
same in the two vaccinated groups (Fig. 3c), suggesting
that a similar occupancy of vaccine induced CD8+ T
cells was achieved in the tumor draining lymph nodes
despite having a higher systemic immune response in
the triple combination treatment group.
Anti-PD-1 did not enhance accumulation of TILs induced
by DPX vaccination and mCPA
As the tumor draining lymph nodes did not exhibit the
same increase in antigen-specific IFN-γ response as
detected in the spleen, we postulated that perhaps they
were being routed into the tumor where they could ac-
cumulate. We thus evaluated the TIL population using
flow cytometry of dissociated tumor cells. We found that
anti-PD-1 treatment alone did not increase the infiltra-
tion of C3 tumors with CD45+ TILs over those of un-
treated or isotype control treated mice (Fig. 4a). The
combination of DPX-R9F and mCPA treatment resulted
in a significant increase in CD45+ cells (25.3 %) as com-
pared to that of anti-PD-1 treatment alone (9.8 %). Infil-
tration higher with DPX-R9F, mCPA and anti-PD-1
(34.1 %), but was not significant compared to DPX-R9F/
mCPA (Fig. 4a). A similar trend was observed for
CD8α+ T cells (Fig. 4b). These results were consistent
with expression patterns detected by immunohistochem-
istry of tumor sections using anti-CD45 and anti-CD8α
(Additional file 1: Figure S2).
R9F antigen-specific CD8α+ T cells were detected
using a multimer reagent. As shown in Fig. 4c, the num-
bers of R9F-specific CD8α+ T cells in the untreated,
isotype treated and anti-PD-1 treated groups were
consistently low (<1.5 % of CD45+ cells). The number of
antigen-specific
CD8α+
T cells
was
higher
in
the
DPX-R9F/mCPA treated group (4.0 %) compared to that
in the anti-PD-1 (0.5 %). The highest accumulation of
R9F-specific CD8α+ T cells was detected in the group
treated with the DPX-R9F/mCPA/anti-PD-1 combin-
ation (10.8 %), a significant increase compared to that in
the DPX-R9F/mCPA treated group.

 Anti-PD-1 did not significantly increase the activity of
tumor infiltrating antigen-specific CD8α+ T cells induced
by DPX vaccination and mCPA
The flow cytometry data suggested an expansion of R9F-
specific CD8α+ T cells in response to treatment with
DPX-R9F, mCPA and anti-PD-1. We used RT-qPCR to
determine if there was a correlating increase in cytotox-
icity genes within the TME (Fig. 5). We looked for expres-
sion of the following genes associated with cytotoxicity:
Cd8a (CD8α, Fig. 5a), Gzmb (Granzyme B, Fig. 5b), Ifng
(IFN-γ, Fig. 5c), and Prf (Perforin, Fig. 5d). We also
assessed the level of the Th1 transcription factor Tbx21
(T-bet, Fig. 5e) and Cd4 (CD4, Fig. 5f). None of these
genes were increased by anti-PD-1 treatment over un-
treated or isotype control treated mice. However, they
were all increased by DPX/mCPA compared to anti-
PD-1 alone. Expression of Gzmb was significantly
higher in the DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 group compared
to that in the DPX/mCPA group, and in general the
expression of each gene tended to be highest in the
group treated with DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 combination,
which is consistent with the flow cytometry analysis of
TILs in the TME.
The most striking increase in mRNA observed was for
Pdcd1 (PD-1, Fig. 5g). For this gene, the level of mRNA
was significantly increased by 27.7 times that of the
untreated control by DPX/mCPA treatment, and then
further increased to 77.7 times that of the untreated
control by DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 combination treat-
ment. Although expression of Cd274 (PD-L1, Fig. 5h)
was increased by DPX/mCPA treatment relative to that
of anti-PD-1 only, it was not further increased by DPX/
mCPA/anti-PD-1.
Finally, we assessed the expression of the Th2 tran-
scription factor Gata3 (GATA-3, Fig. 5i). Although there
were some variations in expression between the different
treatment groups, the magnitude of these fluctuations
was low (maximum 5-fold).
We noted that for five of the nine genes analysed
(CD8a, Gzmb, Ifng, Prf, Tbx21, and CD4) the DPX/
mCPA/isotype control group seemed to have reduced
expression compared to DPX/mCPA. Although not
significant, this could be an indication that the isotype
control (rat anti-mouse) may be having some antigen-
non-specific effect on the immune response.
Anti-PD-1 facilitated the clonal expansion of T cells
induced by DPX vaccination and mCPA within the TME
Tumor samples taken from clinical trial subjects treated
with anti-PD-1 suggested that anti-PD-1 can increase
clonality of the TIL populations [19]. Our results thus
far have indicated that in combination with DPX and
mCPA treatment, anti-PD-1 leads to high levels of
antigen-specific CD8α+ T cells and increased CTL gene
expression within the TME. To determine what effect
anti-PD-1 treatment may have on clonal expansion
within the TME in the context of an active and tar-
geted immune response, we applied next generation
sequencing to analyze intratumoral TCRβ populations
using total tumor genomic DNA. These results are
shown in Fig. 6.
The total number of TCRβ productive template mole-
cules detected in each sample is a quantitative measure-
ment of the total number of T cells in each sample. As
shown in Fig. 6a, treatment with DPX/mCPA increased
the number of TCRβ productive template molecules
compared to those with anti-PD-1 treatment, and this
was not further increased by treatment with DPX/
mCPA/anti-PD-1. Although these TCRβ template mole-
cules represent both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, they are
consistent with the flow cytometry analysis of the
CD8α+ TIL population (Fig. 4b) and the mRNA levels of
CD8α (Fig. 5a) and CD4 (Fig. 5f). Clonality is a compos-
ite measure of both proliferation (frequency) and diver-
sity (uniqueness) of the TCRβ repertoire, and is shown
in Fig. 6b. The clonality of the untreated (average 0.069)

 and anti-PD-1 treatment groups (average 0.085) were
low, indicating a highly diverse population of T cells
with relatively low clonal proliferation. The clonality of
the DPX/mCPA treated group was significantly higher
(average 0.258), and the clonality of the DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1
treated
group was
the
highest
(average
0.407). The cumulative frequency of the top ten most
expanded clones in the group treated with DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1 (Fig. 6c) was also the highest, indicating that
the
top
ten
most
expanded
clones
in
the TME
accounted for 46.5 % of all the TILs, whereas this popu-
lation accounted for 25.5 % in the DPX/mCPA treated
group and 14.7 % in the anti-PD-1 treated group. Al-
though the difference between DPX/mCPA and DPX/
mCPA/anti-PD-1 are significant, they are not signifi-
cant between DPX/mCPA/isotype and DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1. We have already demonstrated that the iso-
type antibody does not increase the antigen-specific
response induced by DPX/mCPA (Fig. 4c), and the RT-
qPCR data for the DPX/mCPA/isotype control group
indicated that the isotype antibody may be having some
effect (Fig. 5). Therefore, we think that since the clonal-
ity data is based on a single experiment with n = 5 the
DPX/mCPA is a more relevant control.
It is not possible to identify the antigen-specificity of
the clones by sequence alone. To create a library of pos-
sible R9F-specific clones, we vaccinated three C3 tumor
bearing mice with DPX-R9F and purified the R9F-spe-
cific CD8α+ T cells from the spleens 8 days later using
FACS; purity of the R9F-specific population was on average
85 %. TCRβ sequencing of these cells revealed 26 unique
clones across all three samples with a frequency greater
than 1 %, we considered this the threshold for clones that
were likely R9F-specific (Additional file 1: Table S2). We
screened the TIL populations from the previous experi-
ment using the R9F-clone library. No R9F-specific clones
from the library were identified in the untreated control
or anti-PD-1 treated groups (Fig. 7a). Mice treated with
DPX/mCPA and DPX/mCPA/isotype control had on
average 2.2 and 2.0, respectively, unique R9F-specific
clones. The highest number of unique clones was
detected in the DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 combination
treated group, which had on average 3.6 R9F-clones in
the TME. The cumulative frequency of these R9F-
specific clones in the DPX/mCPA and DPX/mCPA/iso-
type controls groups ranged from 0.000 to 6.285 %,
whereas in the DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 treated group
they ranged from 1.690 to 13.852 % (Fig. 7b).
Discussion
In summary, we have demonstrated that the use of anti-
PD-1 in combination with a potent vaccine-based im-
munotherapy provides effective control of advanced C3
tumors. Delving into the mechanism, we found that
anti-PD-1 treatment enhanced clonal expansion of T
cells induced by DPX vaccination and mCPA treatment
within the TME. Our results indicate that anti-PD-1
treatment enhances the expansion of antigen-specific
CD8α+ T cells, and therefore provides a rationale for the
combination of PD-1 blockade with active, targeted
immune therapy.
Blockade of the PD-1:PD-L1 signaling axis using mono-
clonal antibodies to either PD-1 or PD-L1 has shown
remarkable efficacy in several clinical trials [17, 27]. How-
ever, not all patients benefit from treatment, and it is diffi-
cult to get consistent responses in different animal tumor
models [28]. Although positive PD-L1 expression in the
TME is highly correlated with responses to PD-1 blockade
[29, 30], approximately 15 % of PD-L1 negative patients
also respond to treatment [31]. The difficulty in relying on
Fig. 7 Anti-PD-1 increases the diversity and frequency of antigen-
specific clones induced by DPX vaccination and mCPA. A R9F-clone
library was created by purifying the R9F-specific CD8α + T cells clones
from the spleens of vaccinated, C3 tumor bearing mice (n = 3) using
FACS and performing TCRβ sequencing. From the three mice, 26
different clones were identified at a frequency >1 % and considered
R9F-specific. These clones were screened for in tumor TCRβ data

 PD-L1 expression is that there can be temporal and spatial
expression variations within a tumor [30], as well as in-
consistencies in expression profiles depending on the anti-
body used for detection. Cancers with high mutational
burden and increased TILs have had the most benefit
from treatment with PD-1 blockade [17, 21], but many
cancer types are not associated with high mutational loads
and may not experience the same improvement after anti-
PD-1 treatment [32]. The C3 model used in this study has
low expression of PD-L1 and TIL infiltration in the ab-
sence of treatment; therefore it serves as a useful model
for anti-PD-1 treatment of tumors with a negative prog-
nostic profile. Indeed, the C3 tumor was non-responsive
to anti-PD-1 treatment. On its own, anti-PD-1 had a min-
imal effect on increasing infiltrates of CD45+ or CD8α+
TILs in the TME. Similarly, it did not increase R9F-
specific T cells and at the mRNA expression level there
was also no increase in four cytotoxic specific genes. A
major finding of these experiments was that even in this
anti-PD-1 refractory tumor, anti-PD-1 was able to further
increase tumor infiltration with antigen-specific R9F cells
and T cell clonality expansion in the TME initiated by
DPX-R9F and mCPA. Similar findings were also reported
by Karyampudi and colleagues using the anti-PD-1 refrac-
tory TUBO tumor model, treating with a peptide vaccine
and anti-PD-1 [23]. They postulated that anti-PD-1 may
encourage epitope spreading, and our results indicate that
this may indeed be a factor.
As in other models, in this study we showed that
anti-PD-1 in combination with DPX vaccination and
mCPA provided enhanced protection against tumor
growth [24, 33]. We observed similar results in B16 melan-
oma and MOSE ovarian tumor models (Additional file 1:
Figure S2), however these results do not conclusively dem-
onstrate a significant improvement. This may be in part at-
tributed to the aggressive nature of these tumors. Certainly
slower growing tumors may be more likely to respond to
treatment, as there is more time for the tumor to interact
with the immune system, and also for the immune therapy
to stimulate the immune system sufficiently. This is an im-
portant consideration for clinical trial design. The transla-
tional relevancy of the mouse anti-PD-1 reagents may also
contribute to reduced efficacy. The commonly used anti-
PD-1 clones for mouse research, RMP1-14 (used in this
study) and J43 are rat and hamster antibodies, respectively.
However, human anti-PD-1 reagents are human. Repeated
injections of foreign antibodies may induce anti-rat anti-
bodies by the murine host, thereby reducing efficacy in
long term experiments. All the short term experiments
performed in this study used only a single injection of anti-
PD-1 so are less likely to be impacted by this effect. How-
ever, the inconsistent responses observed in the DPX/
mCPA/isotype control group may be another indication
that some non-specific effects are occurring.
Our efforts to deduce if this therapeutic benefit could
be attributed to more potent immune responses to the
vaccine prompted us to examine the antigen-specific
IFN-γ responses by ELISpot in the spleen, vaccine drain-
ing lymph node and tumor draining lymph node. We
did see an enhancement of immune responses in the
spleen, however the responses in the vaccine draining
and tumor draining lymph nodes did not show any
significant enhancement to vaccine responses with anti-
PD-1 treatment. Others have also reported an enhance-
ment of immune responses in the spleen of vaccinated
mice also treated with anti-PD-1, but these studies have
not also looked at immune responses in the lymph
nodes. Recent studies have reported that immune re-
sponses assessed in patient PBMCs may not be the best
representation of immune responses within the TME,
which is arguably the most important site for immune
evaluation [20, 34]. Our data also suggest that immune
responses can vary within different mouse tissues in
response to treatment, and thus may not be useful for
correlating to immune responses within the TME.
Therefore,
we
concentrated
on
evaluating
immune
responses in the TME using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR
and TCRβ sequencing.
Treatment with DPX/mCPA increased TILs compared
to anti-PD-1 alone as measured by flow cytometry, and
total CD8α+ T cells, as measured by RT-qPCR. Combin-
ing these therapies resulted in significantly high levels of
antigen-specific CD8α+ T cells in the TME, yet the accu-
mulation of TILs and CD8a+ TILs was not significantly
increased. These results indicate that the DPX/mCPA/
anti-PD-1 treatment was most efficient in expanding
antigen-specific populations of CD8α+ T cells within the
TME. In the DPX/mCPA/anti-PD-1 treated group, we
also detected the highest levels of PD-1 mRNA, which is
consistent with a previous report that documented in-
creased PD-1 expression with anti-PD-1 treatment and
that likely coincided with retention of T cell functionality
and proliferative capabilities within the TME [35].
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a pre-
clinical model to investigate the effects of vaccination,
mCPA and anti-PD-1 combination therapy on the clonal-
ity of T cells within the TME. We have found that the C3
model is useful for studying immune modulation of
antigen-specific immune responses and their effect on
tumor growth. Our previous work with this tumor model
provided insight into immune modulatory effects between
DPX vaccination and mCPA, which were applied in de-
signing scheduling and immune monitoring in our
clinical trial. In this study, the tumor model has indi-
cated that next generation sequencing to evaluate T
cell clonality may be a useful tool to evaluate the com-
bination of vaccination with PD-1 blockade. Increased
clonality has recently been indicated as a predictive

 biomarker of response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy in a
clinical trial [36] and PD-1+CD8+ TIL population has
been shown to consist of clonally expanded, tumor-
reactive T cells [20]. Our results indicate that combin-
ing anti-PD-1 with vaccination increases the clonal
expansion of select clones, resulting in a less diverse T
cell population represented by a few highly expanded
clones. Therefore, clonality may be a useful biomarker
to assess immune responses in clinical trials after anti-
PD-1 and vaccination therapy.
We attempted to identify R9F-specific clones by cre-
ating a clone library using R9F-specific CD8α+ T cells
purified from three DPX-R9F vaccinated mice. From
these three mice, a total of 26 putative R9F-specific
clones were identified, but only three of these clones
were detected in all three mice and at different fre-
quencies. Due to the poor correlation of highly fre-
quent clones between the three populations, we must
conclude that the library generated was not an exten-
sive representation of all R9F-specific clones. The vari-
ation observed in this small population suggests that
the expansion of antigen-specific clones is unique to
individual mice, and a larger population would be
necessary in order to obtain a complete library. How-
ever, this degree of variation that we observed among
syngeneic mice vaccinated with an immunodominant
epitope also suggests that identification of antigen-specific
clones
in
a
genetically
diverse
human
population
would be difficult. Therefore, the clonality measure-
ment of whole tumor gDNA may be a more compar-
able statistic to use when evaluating the effect of
immune therapy on T cell expansion. Clonal analysis
is an important tool that can be used to understand
complex immune responses using limited sample ma-
terial. Future directions for this work could involve more
extensive investigation into the antigen-specificity of
specific clones in order to identify the higher affinity
clones and then track their development following im-
mune therapy. Combinations with the vaccine and
other clinical antibody candidates, such as anti-OX40
and anti-GITR, may be interesting comparators to anti-
PD-1 as they promote T cell activation by directly pro-
viding stimulation, rather than blocking suppression.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that anti-PD-1 therapy compli-
ments the strong antigen-specific, cytotoxic immune
responses induced by DPX vaccination and mCPA. This
combination may improve responses in subjects that
are non-responsive to anti-PD-1 treatment alone, or
have low pre-existing intratumoral PD-L1 expression.
PD-1 blockade promotes effective immune responses
within the TME by enhancing the clonal expansion of
antigen-specific CD8α+ T cells.
