Abstract
Background: Many people live with dogs but not all walk with them regularly. This study examines the
demographic and behavioural factors that contribute towards owners reporting having a strong sense of
encouragement and motivation to walk provided by their dogs, which we call ‘the Lassie effect’.
Methods: Data was collected from 629 dog owners participating in the RESIDE cross-sectional survey in Perth,
Western Australia. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of factors associated with two separate outcome survey
items ‘Dog encouragement to walk’ (how often dog encouraged me to go walking in last month) and ‘Dog
motivation to walk’ (Having a dog makes me walk more).
Results: Owning a larger dog; having an increased level of attachment to dog; knowing dog enjoys going for a
walk; believing walking keeps dog healthy; and having high social support from family to go walking, were
positively associated with both outcomes ‘dog encouragement to walk’ and ‘dog motivation to walk’. Conversely,
reporting the presence of children at home; that the child is the main person who walks with the dog; and
perceiving dog-specific barriers to walking with dog daily; were negatively associated with both outcomes. In
addition, ‘Dog motivation to walk’ only was positively associated with a belief walking reduces barking, and
negatively with owning a dog that is overweight or a dog that is too old/sick. Reporting that the spouse/partner is
main person who walks with the dog was also negatively associated with ‘dog motivation to walk’, as was
increased perceived access to public open spaces with dog-supportive features.
Conclusions: There are both dog and owner factors that are associated with an owner’s sense of encouragement, and
motivation to walk the dog, which in turn has been found to be associated with dog waking behaviour. These factors
may be targeted in future interventions to increase and maintain physical activity levels of both people and pets.

Background
Dog ownership is associated with increased physical ac-
tivity through walking [1]. The benefits arising from
owning and walking a dog are of particular public health
interest due to their potential for a positive and long-
term sustainable effect on the maintenance of physical
activity behaviour [2–4] and associated reduction in car-
diovascular risk [5]. Considering the significant propor-
tion of people who own or have access to dogs (for
example up to 47 % of households own dogs in the US
[6], 25 % in the UK [7], and 39 % in Australia [8]), dog
walking is a sustainable preventive medicine strategy
with wide reach. Further, a recent review of the associ-
ation between dog ownership and physical activity iden-
tified that approximately 40 % of people who live with a
dog are not walking with them, and more could be walk-
ing with their dog more regularly [1]. In view of the con-
siderable investment in physical activity interventions,
investigation of the mechanisms through which dogs
facilitate increased physical activity is required to iden-
tify feasible dog walking intervention strategies.

 A review of the correlates of dog walking found that
the key factor associated with people walking with their
dog centres around the dog-human relationship [9],
however studies have used inconsistent methodology to
measure this. For example, Japanese dog walkers had
higher levels of ‘attachment’ to their dogs than owners
who did not walk their dog [10], as did UK children
[11], and in a sample of Australian owners and dogs,
higher scores on a dog-owner interaction scale was asso-
ciated with more frequent exercise [12]. A construct
called ‘dog obligation’ has also been used as a measure
to describe an owner’s sense of obligation and/or re-
sponsibility to walk their dog regularly and a feeling that
their dog pressures them to take it for a walk [13], and
has been shown to mediate the relationship between dog
ownership and physical activity [13, 14]. However the
term ‘obligation’ suggests that dog walking is only done
out of sense of duty, rather than dog walking being a
more positive motivating experience. Supporting this,
the authors who originally introduced the idea of ‘dog
obligation’ have more recently suggested that it is better
termed ‘responsibility’ [15]. Whilst the idea of feeling
‘obliged’ or ‘responsible’ to walk your dog may indeed
include feelings of guilt [16], it might also encompass
constructs such as valuing exercise for the dog [17].
Other studies found that dog owners who perceive that
their dog provides motivation and/or social support for
walking [16, 18, 19], or similarly, feel that the dog pro-
vides encouragement to walk [14], are more likely to
walk regularly with the dog. This motivation provided by
the dog to walk may also prove to be an important inter-
vention strategy because targeting the canine need for
exercise, rather than the human need, may have greater
success in increasing owner activity [20].
Overall, there appears to be something special relating to
the motivation, encouragement, obligation or social support
(however described in previous studies) for walking that a
pet dog can provide compared to other types of motivators
or social support mechanisms for physical activity. These
concepts describe an aspect of the dog-human relationship
that we refer to as ‘the Lassie effect’ due to the iconic televi-
sion character’s ability to perform life-saving acts.
Whilst there is mounting evidence of the positive in-
fluence of the Lassie effect on dog walking behaviour it
is not known what factors facilitate or are barriers to the
Lassie effect in supporting human physical activity [1, 9].
One issue with the research so far is the lack of associ-
ation observed between dog walking and dog demo-
graphic and behavioural factors (e.g., size, presence of
behavioural problems, and number of dogs owned) that
we might expect to affect walking. Previously it has often
been found that once the Lassie effect measures are in-
cluded in any modelling, dog demographic and behav-
ioural factors are no longer associated with dog walking
[9], not even ‘knowing that the dog enjoys going for a
walk’ [18, 19].
We hypothesised that these dog demographic and
behavioural factors are important, but act upon dog
walking behaviour through their ability to create the
Lassie effect, which then positively affects walking be-
haviour. A conceptual model relating to our proposed
dataset is presented in Fig. 1. Understanding the factors
that contribute to the Lassie effect will help inform the
design of interventions that use the pet dog to initiate,
increase and maintain walking behaviour. Thus the aim
of this study was to re-examine a well-characterised
dataset regarding dog ownership and physical activity,
and model dog-related factors that contribute towards
this strong sense of encouragement and motivation to
walk the dog.
Methods
The study dataset has been previously reported in detail
[4, 18, 19, 21, 22]. In brief, the RESIDential Environment
(RESIDE) project is a longitudinal natural experiment of
1813 people building homes in 73 new housing develop-
ments across metropolitan Perth, Western Australia (re-
cruited Sep 2003-Mar 2005). Further information on
RESIDE methods are available elsewhere [23, 24]. The
validated Dogs And Physical Activity (DAPA) Tool [22]
was included as part of the second RESIDE survey. A
total of 629 dog owners were included in our new ana-
lyses. Ethical approval was provided by the University
of Western Australia, and all participants provided
written consent. Ethical approval for this new analysis
was obtained in 2013 and analysis performed in 2014.
Lassie effect outcome variables
Although these may appear similar concepts, 1) ‘Dog
provides motivation to walk more’; and 2) ‘Social sup-
port provided by dog to walk’
, have both been shown in
previous studies to be independent predictors of dog
walking outcomes, indicating inherent differences [18, 19].
Therefore both were chosen to be modelled in this study,
this time as outcomes.
The construct ‘social support provided by dog to walk’
that has previously found to be associated with dog walk-
ing [18, 19, 22] includes two items relating to how often
the dog ‘went walking with me’ and ‘gave me encourage-
ment to go walking’ in the past month. This format was
developed in line with other standard social support vari-
ables. For this new analysis we chose to use only the item
‘dog gave me encouragement to go walking’ (5 point
Likert scale never to very often-3 or more times per week),
because this separated the part of the construct that refers
specifically to the feelings of encouragement. The new
outcome has been named ‘Dog encouragement to walk’
and recoded as a 2 level variable; ‘Very often’ (3 or more
Westgarth et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:1019 
Page 2 of 12
 times per week) versus ‘Less than very often’ (less than 3
times per week).
The previous predictor variable ‘Dog provides mo-
tivation to walk more’ [18, 19, 22] was created using
findings from focus groups [16]. It was measured on a
5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly
agree) by the item ‘Having my dog(s) makes me walk
more’. The use of the word ‘make’ in the statement
suggests that this factor has similarities to the sense of
obligation or responsibility as described by other stud-
ies [13–15]. For analysis it is coded as a 2 level vari-
able; ‘disagree/neutral’ versus ‘agree’ and named ‘Dog
motivation to walk’.
Independent variables
The
independent
variables
consisted
of
dog
and
owner demographics and owner cognitive factors and
beliefs which have been described previously [18, 19]
(see Tables 1 and 2). In brief, these included dog-
related factors such as size and level of attachment to
the dog, and whether the dog was overweight or old/
sick. They also included Theory of Planned Behaviour
constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
behavioural control relating to dog-specific items. The
variable ‘Dog-specific barriers to walking daily’ consisted
of items pertaining to concerns regarding difficulty of
walking two dogs, their dog being unfriendly or difficult to
control, and fear of other people’s dogs. Perceived access
to public open spaces with dog-supportive features were
measured using survey items relating to access to areas
that are interesting, attractive, with good signage relating
to dog access and provisions to support dog walking [22].
Objective measures of access to public open space for dog
walking was measured using a modified version of the
Public Open Space Tool [25] with the addition of dog
litter bags and dog-related signage [18].
Statistical analysis
Chi-squared tests or t-tests and binary logistic regression
analyses were used to conduct univariable analyses. Vari-
ables were then entered into the multivariable model if
P < 0.1 in the univariable analysis. Findings are presented
adjusted for the other variables.
Results
Forty-five percent of owners reported that their dog
‘very often (3+ per week)’ ‘encouraged them to walk’ in
the past month and 66 % of owners reported that they
agreed with the statement ‘Having my dog(s) makes me
walk more’.
Univariable analysis
Variables associated with ‘Dog encouragement to walk’
on univariable analysis are presented in Table 1 and vari-
ables associated with ‘Dog motivation to walk’ are pre-
sented in Table 2.
Multivariable analysis
Each Lassie effect outcome was modelled both with and
without the presence of the other as an independent

 variable. When the other outcome variable was included
in the multivariable model, many of the other factors be-
came non-significant. This is to be expected as the out-
comes were highly associated (OR = 10.55, 95 % CI =
6.72–16.56, P < 0.001). Therefore the final models are
presented non-adjusted for the other outcome (Table 3).
For information, size remained in both models when the
other Lassie effect variable was included. A conceptual
map of the findings is presented in Fig. 2.
Dog encouragement to walk
There was evidence for an independent association be-
tween the outcome ‘Dog encouragement to walk’ and
dog size (medium/large vs small OR = 1.81, 95 % CI =
1.24–2.63, P = 0.002) and level of attachment to dog
(high vs medium/low OR = 1.70, 95 % CI = 0.99–2.92, P =
0.05) (Table 3). Associated dog-related cognitive factors
included: knowing dog enjoys going for a walk (‘likely mo-
tivation to walk with dog daily’ vs ‘ambivalent-unlikely
motivation to walk with dog daily’ OR = 1.87, 95 % CI =
1.21–2.90, P = 0.01); keep dog healthy (‘likely motivation
to walk with dog daily’ vs ‘ambivalent-unlikely motiv-
ation to walk with dog daily’ OR = 2.07, 95 % CI = 1.17–
3.68, P = 0.01); and perceived dog-specific barriers to
walking with dog daily (‘unlikely to discourage’ vs
‘ambivalent-likely to discourage’ OR = 1.65, 95 % CI =
1.15–2.38, P = 0.01) (Table 3). There was also an associ-
ation with: presence of children at home <18 years (no
vs yes OR = 1.68, 95 % CI = 1.16–2.45; P = 0.01); child
main person in household who walks with dog (no vs yes
OR = 2.46, 95 % CI = 1.13–5.33, P = 0.02); and social sup-
port from family to go walking in past month (average/
good vs poor OR = 1.76, 95 % CI = 1.19–2.58, P = 0.004)
(Table 3).
The model for encouragement found that inclusion of
motivation accounted for all other variables except size.
Dog motivation to walk
There was evidence for an independent association
between the outcome ‘Dog motivation to walk’ and: dog
size (medium/large vs small OR = 2.06, 95 % CI = 1.33–
3.17, P = 0.001); level of attachment to dog (high vs
medium/low OR = 2.12, 95 % CI = 1.21–3.74,P = 0.01);
owns an overweight dog (no vs yes OR = 1.76, 95 % CI =
1.01–3.07, P = 0.05); and affected by poor health or age of
dog (no vs yes OR = 1.58, 95 % CI = 1.00–2.49, P = 0.05).
Other dog-related cognitive factors associated with dog
motivation to walk were: knowing dog enjoys going for a
walk (‘likely motivation to walk with dog daily’ vs ‘ambiva-
lent-unlikely motivation to walk with dog daily’ OR = 2.84,

inclusion rendered the other variables insignificant ex-
cept size, knowing dog enjoys going for a walk, spouse/

child main person in household who walks with dog,
children at home <18 years, and social support from
family to go walking in past month.
Discussion
Our findings elucidate how the motivation, encourage-
ment, obligation or social support for walking that an
individual pet dog can provide is important to under-
standing dog walking behaviour. Both Lassie effect out-
comes ‘Dog encouragement to walk’ and ‘Dog motivation
to walk’ appear to be associated with the key variables of:
dog size; level of attachment to dog; perceived dog-
specific barriers to walking with dog daily; knowing dog
enjoys going for a walk; belief walking keeps dog healthy;
children at home <18 years; the child being the main
person who walks with the dog; and social support from
family to go walking in past month. In addition, ‘Dog mo-
tivation to walk’ only was positively associated with the
belief that walking reduces barking, and negatively with;
dog overweight; dog too old/sick; spouse/partner main
person who walks with the dog; and increased perceived
access to public open spaces with dog-supportive features.
Thus this supports our hypothesis that dog-related factors
influence the dog-human relationship through the encour-
agement and motivation certain dogs provide for walking,
which in turn (based on existing studies) influences dog
walking behaviour.
Our findings suggest that larger dogs appear to encour-
age and motivate dog walking compared with smaller
dogs. Likewise having a strong attachment to the dog is
associated with feelings of encouragement and motivation
to walk the dog. A few other studies have also found that

 dog size (larger vs smaller) [26, 27] and stronger attach-
ment [10] are associated with higher levels of dog walking
behaviour. However, the majority of other studies explor-
ing dog-related factors found no association with walking
[9]. Here we demonstrate this is because the mechanism
through which dog size and attachment influence dog
walking behaviour is through the Lassie effect.
The belief that walking with a dog daily keeps the dog
healthy was associated with both increased motivation
and perceived encouragement provided by the dog for
walking. This supports other evidence showing that
owner’s perceptions about the benefits of dog walking
for their dog has a role to play in the pathway to chan-
ging dog walking behaviour [16, 20].
We found that perceived dog-specific barriers to walk-
ing with a dog daily was negatively associated with both
Lassie effect outcomes. Perceived dog specific barriers to
daily dog walking includes difficulties in walking two dogs
(as opposed to one), owners’ fear of other dogs and con-
cerns a person’s own dog will be unfriendly and difficult
to control while walking. These perceived barriers reduce
feelings of encouragement and motivation to walk the
dog. This agrees with other studies showing that dog
behaviour problems can negatively influence walking [9],
however our findings highlight that the pathway is
through reduced encouragement and motivation to walk
the dog. Interestingly, some aspects of dog behaviour such
as fear that a person’s own dog may attack other dogs, or
perceiving positive behavioural outcomes from walking
the dog, were not associated with either ‘Lassie’ effect
outcome. This area requires deeper investigation.
Interestingly, people who experienced the Lassie effect
from their dogs also perceived that their family provided
social support for walking, suggesting that they may enjoy
walking together as a family unit. There has been little
research into the influence of social support from family
members or friends on dog walking behaviour [9]. One
Australian study reported that 68 % of dog-owning chil-
dren’s families reported walking the dog as a family at least
once a month [28]. Perceived social support for walking
provided by other family members appears to positively
influence an owner’s perceived social support and motiv-
ation/obligation to walk their dog and suggests that the
support that a dog and a family member provide for walk-
ing may be entwined. However, we also observed that if
someone else in the household reported being the main
person walking the dog (e.g., a partner/spouse or child)
this was associated with lower odds of reporting the Lassie
effect outcomes. This is logical as encouragement and
motivation for dog walking is unlikely to be felt if some-
body else in the household usually does the dog walking
without you. This highlights that future studies should
determine not just dog ownership but who walks the dog
and how this is shared with other family members.
Finally, we found that having children at home may
be a barrier to experiencing the Lassie effect. This may

 be due to the heightened perceived lack of time for
physical activity of parents of children [29, 30]. Previ-
ous studies have shown mixed findings of the effect of
increased household size/or having dependents on dog
walking behaviour [9]. Further research is needed to
understand the relationships between the factors asso-
ciated with the Lassie effect and dog walking behaviour
in families with children.
While many factors were associated with both dog
encouragement and motivation to walk, there were some
differences between these measures of the Lassie effect.
The belief that walking with a dog daily reduces the risk
of barking was associated with increased motivation/ob-
ligation but not perceived encouragement for dog walk-
ing. This supports other evidence showing that owners
perceive a number of dog behaviour benefits from walk-
ing their dog [16] and this can be an incentive to walk-
ing with your dog. However it is unknown why it might
affect perceived motivation but not encouragement pro-
vided by the dog to walk. A plausible explanation may
be that reduced barking is a benefit of dog walking that
is only realised once walking is established. Thus it may
be a construct of the motivation to maintain dog walking
over time rather than initially feeling encouraged to take
the dog out for a walk. Similarly, the influence of old/
sick dogs was associated with reduced motivation but
not perceived encouragement to walk the dog. This sug-
gests that having a sick/old dog is a barrier to feeling
motivated or obliged to walk the dog, regardless of how
much encouragement or perceived social support for
walking the presence of a dog may provide. Owners of
overweight dogs also showed reduced motivation to walk
their dog.
Overall, these differences highlight that the two outcomes
of The Lassie effect modelled may refer to different aspects
of dog walking, or alternatively, the difference in findings
may be reflecting differences in the wording of the two
question answers and they are essentially measuring the
same construct. However, two previous studies have shown
that the two constructs were found to be independently as-
sociated with dog walking outcomes [18, 19]. In the current
study where we modelled motivation and encouragement
as outcomes (rather than dog walking as per previous stud-
ies), the addition of motivation to the encouragement
model rendered many of the other variables obsolete. How-
ever when the encouragement construct was added to the
motivation model, a number of variables remained. This
suggests that the encouragement and motivation variables
do not simply replace each other in the models. This could
plausibly suggest that the wording of the ‘motivation’
construct partly includes the idea of encouragement but
also something more, we suggest being that extra sense of
‘obligation’ or ‘responsibility’ adding to encouragement to
provide specific motivation for walking with a dog.
Looking closer at differences in the data provides fur-
ther support for this. Knowing that your dog also enjoys
the walking experience was associated with both out-
comes, however comparison of the models with and
without the other Lassie effect variable suggests that
knowing the dog enjoys going for a walk may be more
important to motivation to keep walking than encour-
agement to go walking. This may be because you have to
already be walking the dog before you can perceive that
it enjoys it. Comparison of the models with and without
the other Lassie effect variables also suggested that the
role of spouses or children walking the dog may be more
directed to motivation than encouragement. This could
be explained by the idea that a dog may behave in a way
that encourages walking but in reality someone else will
do it. Further studies are required to examine whether
the differences in our two Lassie effect outcomes may
relate to initiation (encouragement) and maintenance
(motivation) of dog walking. Importantly, further re-
search is required to understand and assist with consist-
ent terminology associated with the effect of dog-related
variables on the initiation (encouragement) and main-
tenance (motivation) of dog walking.
In addition, perceived access to public open space
with dog supportive features contributed to perceived
motivation but not encouragement to dog walk. Even
more interestingly, the direction of the effect was opposite
to what might be expected, with a higher perceived access
to places with dog supportive features (e.g., ‘poo’ bins and
dog-related signage) associated with lower odds of report-
ing high motivation to dog walk. We hypothesise that
perceived access to areas with dog-supportive features
may be less relevant if the motivation to walk the dog is
already high, as the dog will be walked regardless of
whether there are places with dog-supportive features to
walk. In fact those who feel having a dog makes them walk
more may perceive that their local walking areas are actu-
ally not very dog supportive because they observe them
directly when they are out walking.
Our findings have a number of implications for the fu-
ture design of interventions to increase dog walking and
community levels of physical activity. Findings confirm
that dog-specific and dog-human relationship factors are
important to perceptions regarding the need to walk the
dog. Interventions should aim to target the perceived en-
couragement and motivation the pet dog can provide for
walking. This may be through changing perceptions of
the amount of exercise smaller and older dogs require,
and how much dogs enjoy walking. Interventions may
also be able to target the attachment to the dog, perhaps
by increasing this through participation in training exer-
cises or activities with the dog. Furthermore, tackling
dog-specific behavioural barriers through dog and owner
education and training may also naturally have this
Westgarth et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:1019 
Page 10 of 12
 effect of strengthening the owner-dog relationship as
well as addressing specific barriers to walking. Interven-
tions could also perhaps specifically be targeted at
owners of small dogs and dogs with walking-related
behavioural problems. They could also be directed at
families with children who are likely to feel less encour-
aged/obligated to walk the dog because of time pres-
sures, as these may be hard to reach groups but with
the most to gain. It is clear that for the success of such
interventions, interdisciplinary collaboration between
health promotion practitioners, veterinarians and dog
behaviour experts is key.
This study appears to be the first to unpack how dog
and owner-related factors influence the single largest
factor correlated with dog walking behaviour – the per-
ceived encouragement/social support/motivation/obli-
gation provided by the dog to walk. Another strength
of this study is that the sample is population rather
than convenience-based. However it is limited by its
specificity to people who had recently moved into new
housing areas, and thus may not be representative of all
dog owners. Factors not measured in this study such as
dog breed and training, as well as socialization, could
be relevant and should be considered in future re-
search. Why factors such as dog size and age influence
beliefs about exercise requirements requires further
exploration. The hypothetical pathway to dog walking
behaviour described requires confirmation using medi-
ation analyses. Finally, future studies may wish to
examine if and how the perceived social support/motiv-
ation/obligation provided by a dog to walk changes
according to the initiation and maintenance of dog
walking behaviour.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a pathway where dog and owner
factors affect the dog-owner relationship in terms of
encouragement and motivation to walk the dog, which
then affects dog walking behaviour (as shown in previ-
ous studies). Interventions should target owners of
small dogs and dogs with behavioural problems when
walking, and families with children who are likely to
feel less encouraged/motivated to walk the dog. Future
studies need to investigate in more detail how the
dog-owner relationship of different dog and owner
demographics leads to walking behaviour. They should
also investigate whether initiation and maintenance of
dog walking is affected by different factors. Further in-
vestigation is also required into the life stage of fam-
ilies and how this affects the dog-owner relationship
and dog walking behaviour. Future studies should be
prospective and use objective measures of walking
where possible.
