Early-life antibiotic use is associated with increased risk for metabolic and immunological
diseases, and mouse studies indicate a causal role of the disrupted microbiome. However,
little is known about the impacts of antibiotics on the developing microbiome of children.
Here we use phylogenetics, metagenomics and individual antibiotic purchase records to show
that macrolide use in 2–7 year-old Finnish children (N ¼ 142; sampled at two time points) is
associated with a long-lasting shift in microbiota composition and metabolism. The shift
includes depletion of Actinobacteria, increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, decrease
in bile-salt hydrolase and increase in macrolide resistance. Furthermore, macrolide use in
early life is associated with increased risk of asthma and predisposes to antibiotic-associated
weight gain. Overweight and asthmatic children have distinct microbiota compositions.
Penicillins leave a weaker mark on the microbiota than macrolides. Our results support the
idea that, without compromising clinical practice, the impact on the intestinal microbiota
should be considered when prescribing antibiotics.

 A
ntibiotics are the most commonly used drugs in the
pediatric populations of western countries1,2. Early-life
antibiotic
use
is
associated
with
increased
risk
for inflammatory bowel disease3, overweight4–6 and asthma7.
Experimental mouse studies have linked early-life administration
of antibiotics with metabolic and immune-related diseases,
possibly via changes in the intestinal microbiome8–11. However,
studies with mice are hard to extrapolate to human because of
marked differences in metabolism, diet and microbiome12.
In trials with human adults, oral intake of antibiotics has been
shown to markedly affect the intestinal microbiota, reducing the
diversity and altering the composition13,14. However, these
studies are limited by small sample size (3–4 individuals) and
are complicated by large inter-individual variation in microbiota
composition.
In
neonates,
the
early
development
of
the
microbiota differs between antibiotic-treated and non-treated
infants15,16, but nothing is currently known about the long-term
associations between lifetime antibiotic use and the intestinal
microbiome in children. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is of
major public health concern globally and is expected to become
an increasingly serious obstacle in the treatment of infections17.
To better understand the health implications of early-life
antibiotic use, it is important to consider how different types
of antibiotics influence the intestinal microbiome. In Finland,
the Social Insurance Institute maintains a national database
on prescription drug purchases and eligibility for special
reimbursement
due
to
chronic
diseases
linked
with
personal identification information of the patient18. Here we
utilize
this
unique
database
and
pyrosequencing
of
fecal
microbiomes to investigate the short- and long-term effects of
antibiotics on pre-school children’s intestinal microbiome and
health.
We show that antibiotic use in childhood is associated with
marked changes in the intestinal microbiota composition, which
persist for over 6 months. Macrolides, particularly, appear to
modify
the
microbiota
and
their
functions,
being
the
strongest driver of inter-individual differences in microbiota
composition
in
our
cohort.
Among
the
children
who
received macrolides in early life, we find a positive correlation
between overall lifetime antibiotic use and body mass index
(BMI), as well as an increased risk of asthma, suggesting that
macrolide use may alter the microbiota in infants in a way that
predisposes to antibiotic-associated weight gain and asthma in
later childhood.
Results
Microbiota composition correlates with macrolide use. Our
cohort consists of 236 Finnish children aged 2–7 years (median
age 5 years), attending day care at the time of the study. A total
of
257
fecal
samples
were
obtained
from
142
children
(Supplementary Fig. 1) who donated either a single sample
(27 children) or two samples (115 children; samples were taken
7 months apart). The fecal samples were grouped based on
antibiotic use (Supplementary Table 1). As the control group, we
selected samples from children who had not used antibiotics for
42 years and whose total lifetime antibiotic use was o1 course
per year on average. The microbiota composition of the other
groups was compared with that of the control group.
Although the indications for penicillin and macrolide courses
were the same—both were prescribed mainly for respiratory
infections—macrolide use specifically was associated with a clear
shift in the microbiota composition (Fig. 1). The group M6
(exposed to macrolides within 6 months) had a distinct
microbiota composition evident even at the phylum level
(Fig. 1a). The abundance of Actinobacteria, which includes
Bifidobacterium as the dominant genus, was reduced in this
group, in many cases to below detectability, and the abundances
of the Gram-negative phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria
were increased. These changes were largely resolved in the M12
and M24 groups, indicating that the phylum-level balance of the
microbiota recovered within 1 year after a macrolide course. The
penicillin-user groups (P6, P12 and P24) did not have a distinctly
different phyla composition. The genus-level principal coordi-
nates analysis (PCoA) indicated that the main driver determining
the overall microbiota composition was macrolide use: most of
the M6 samples clustered together with low scores on component
1, whereas the rest of the samples showed less clear patterns
(Fig. 1b). The time since the last macrolide course correlated with
component 1 (r ¼ 0.36, Po0.001), indicating that the beta
diversity among these samples was associated with recovery from
the most recent macrolide course. Penicillin use was not strongly
associated with the principal components. The same patterns
were evident in both the 2–4- and 5–7-year-old children,
indicating that the dominant effect of macrolide exposure on
the microbiota was not age-dependent. Furthermore, the pattern
was evident regardless of previous antibiotic exposure back-
ground. We thus conclude that macrolides appear to set the
microbiota
to
a
certain
state,
regardless
of
the
baseline
composition.
Long-lasting microbiome shifts after antibiotic use. Antibiotic
use, and macrolide use in particular, was associated with a
long-term reduction in microbial richness, which did not reach
the level of the control samples even 12–24 months after the
course (Fig. 2a). The age-adjusted maturity index (Supplementary
Table 2) was also reduced in the samples exposed to macrolides
within 2 years, and in group P6, indicating that the age-associated
aspects of the microbiota recovered within 6–12 months after a
penicillin course, but did not fully recover from a macrolide
course even after 2 years (Fig. 2b).
After controlling for age, BMI z-score and health (asthma,
allergic dermatitis or parent-reported allergies), 18 of the 48
genera and 7 of the 14 orders that were detected in 430% of the
samples were significantly associated with recent antibiotic use,
that is, were significantly different in the groups M6 or P6 as
compared with the control group (Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Four of the six commonly detected genera
belonging to Actinobacteria were associated with macrolide use:
one increased 10-fold (Eggerthella) and three decreased 4–10-fold
(Bifidobacterium, Collinsella and unassigned Coriobacteriaceae) in
the group M6. Of these, Collinsella was significantly reduced in all
groups compared with the control group, suggesting that this
genus is strongly affected by antibiotics. Among the Bacteroidetes,
Bacteroides
was
twofold
elevated
in
the
group
M6
and
Parabacteroides in the groups M6, M12, P6 and P24. Among
the
other
Gram-negative
bacteria,
a
twofold
increase
in
Proteobacteria in the group M6 was notable, but apparently
distributed among several genera with a member of Enterobacter-
iaceae as the most significantly affected (P ¼ 0.05 in a generalized
linear model). Among the Firmicutes, bacteria from the order
Gemellales were significantly and consistently reduced in the
penicillin-user groups. The order Lactobacillales was increased in
all macrolide user groups. This was largely owing to an increase in
Streptococcus, whereas Lactobacillus was decreased. Lactobacillus
was also decreased in the groups P6 and P12. Erysipelotrichales as
an order, and its member genus Eubacterium, were elevated in the
group M6. An unassigned member of Clostridiales, a member
related to Christensenella, and Anaerostipes were reduced in the
group M6, whereas the genera Clostridium and Dorea were
increased.

 In addition to stratifying the children by the most recent
antibiotic course, we investigated the possibility of cumulative
effects of lifetime antibiotic exposure (number of antibiotic
courses per year of life). Recent antibiotic use correlated with
lifetime use: all antibiotic user groups had higher lifetime use
than the control group, as the control group was selected partly
based on low lifetime antibiotic use (Po0.001 in a generalized
linear model). Hence, after controlling for recent antibiotic
use, the cumulative lifetime use had a minimal association with
the microbiota composition. Four genera, all in the order
Clostridiales, were significantly positively associated with total
lifetime macrolide use (Blautia, P ¼ 0.002; Dorea, P ¼ 0.002;
Dialister, P ¼ 0.004; and Megamonas, P ¼ 0.006). Megamonas was
also positively associated with lifetime penicillin use (P ¼ 0.003).
Microbial richness was not associated with lifetime antibiotic use
after controlling for the most recent antibiotic course.
Based on the metagenomic analysis, we discovered that
macrolide resistance was high in the recently macrolide-exposed
microbiomes, and bile-salt hydrolases were reduced (Fig. 3a,b).

 same pattern: macrolide resistance was initially elevated after a
macrolide course but declined linearly until it reached a low
baseline level at ca. 6–12 months after the course (Fig. 3c).
Moreover, a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay on 130 fecal
samples showed that the abundance of ermF and ermB also
correlated
negatively
with
time
since
the
last
macrolide
course (r ¼ � 0.31, P ¼ 0.005 in Pearson correlation test).
There was a clear positive correlation between qPCR-measured
abundance of bsh genes and time since the last macrolide course
(Fig. 3d).

was

associated with frequent macrolide use during the first 2 years of
life: odds ratio for the group that received 42 macrolide courses
(N ¼ 32) compared with the non-exposed (N ¼ 116) was 6.11
(95% confidence interval: 1.53–26.58, P ¼ 0.004 in Fisher’s test).
We also observed a strong correlation between total lifetime
antibiotic use and the BMI z-score in the children with 42
macrolide courses before the age of 2 years (Supplementary
Fig. 3), but not in the non-exposed children.
We compared the microbiota compositions of asthmatic
(N ¼ 8) and overweight (N ¼ 9) children with those of matched
healthy and normal-weight controls. The asthmatic cases were
distinguished from the healthy controls by a set of three bacterial
genera with significantly different abundances: Blautia, Rothia
and Coprobacillus (Supplementary Fig. 4A). The overweight cases
were distinguished from the matched normal-weight controls by
a set of four bacterial groups: Clostridium (Erysipelotrichaceae),
Clostridium
(Clostridiaceae),
Akkermansia
and
Enterococcus
(Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Discussion
Our results show that macrolide use in childhood is associated
with long-term distortions in the composition, function and
antibiotic resistance of the intestinal microbiota. The use of
penicillin-type
antibiotics
was
not
associated
with
large
microbiome-wide functional or compositional changes in the
microbiota.
We observed clear differences in the microbiota composition in
the antibiotic-treated children as compared with those who were
not exposed to antibiotics for 42 years. Some aspects of the
microbiota, such as the abundance of Bifidobacterium and
Bacteroides, and macrolide resistance, normalized within 12
months after a macrolide course. However, the abundances of
Collinsella, Lactobacillus and Anaerostipes, as well as the total
richness and maturity of the microbiota, remained reduced for up
to 2 years after a macrolide course. A full recovery of the
microbiota from an antibiotic course thus appeared to take longer
than the average interval between courses (the children received
on average 1.8±1.5 courses per year). When antibiotics are used
annually or more frequently, the microbiota may not have time to
recover and the antibiotic-associated microbiota composition
may persist.
The children receiving antibiotics had infections, whereas those
not receiving antibiotics did not have bacterial infections,
requiring antibiotic treatment—although they may have had
viral infections— and hence we considered the possibility that the
microbiota changes could be attributed to the infections.

 However, both macrolide and penicillin antibiotics were pre-
scribed mostly for respiratory infections, but were associated with
clearly different, even opposite, changes in the microbiota.
Furthermore, it has previously been shown that fever does not
alter the microbiota composition of children19. This indicates that
infections alone do not explain all of the observed changes.
Finally, the strong correlation between macrolide use and
macrolide resistance suggests a causal relation with the used
antibiotics. Experimental studies with animals8,9,20 and with adult
humans13,14 have shown that the intake of antibiotics alters
the intestinal microbiota. In a recent experiment with mice11,
early-life macrolide and penicillin treatment was shown to cause
very similar effects on the microbiota as we observed, strongly
suggesting causality in our cohort as well.
In an earlier mouse study, it was shown that although the
microbiota recover when antibiotic administration is ceased, the
metabolic changes persist10. Our results confirm corresponding
patterns in human children: the children with heavy early-life use
of antibiotics but no antibiotics for at least 2 years before sample
donation had a microbiota similar to those with low lifetime
antibiotic
use.
Nevertheless,
early-life
use
of
macrolides
predisposed to overweight and asthma. These results suggest
that even transient microbiome disturbance in early life may have
long-term effects on the metabolic and immunological health of
the child.
We found a strong positive association between recorded
antibiotic use and BMI z-scores, specifically in a group of children
that were exposed to macrolides in early life. The growth-
promoting effect of antibiotics in animals21 and in children of
low-income countries22,23 have been linked with a reduction in
subclinical infections, although a role for the intestinal microbiota
was proposed already in the 1950s (ref. 22). In western
children4,24, a reduction in subclinical infections is unlikely to
explain the association between antibiotic use and BMI z-scores.
Furthermore, it does not explain why priming specifically with
macrolides predisposes to the antibiotic-associated weight gain.
Rather, the weight gain is likely to occur via macrolide-associated
changes in the microbiota, which promote excessive weight gain,
as demonstrated experimentally with mice11. Early-life macrolide
treatment in mice lead to reduced level of ghrelin, changes in
hepatic gene expression and an inability of the microbiome to
adapt to dietary changes11. For the first time in human children,
we demonstrate antibiotic-associated changes in the microbiome,
which
have
previously
been
associated
with
metabolic
diseases and obesity: reduced diversity25, increased abundance
of endotoxin-producing (Gram-negative) organisms, such as
Proteobacteria26, as well as depletion of Bifidobacterium27,
Christensenella28 and bile-salt hydrolase producing organisms29.
Bile acid metabolism is one of the key functions performed
by the intestinal bacteria, with strong effects on host energy
metabolism30. Bacterial bile-salt hydrolases de-conjugate primary
conjugated bile acids, rendering them susceptible for further
bacterial modification into secondary and tertiary forms31.
Bile-salt hydrolases are enriched in the human intestinal
microbiome32,
indicating
their
importance
in
the
human
digestive system. Modified bile acids function as metabolic
regulators, and bile-salt hydrolase activity of the microbiota has
been shown to reduce host weigh gain, insulin resistance and
blood cholesterol via FXR-a and TGR5 signalling29,33.
Previous birth-cohort studies and large international studies
have found an association between asthma and early-life
antibiotic use34, particularly with respect to cephalosporins35
and macrolides36. Increased risk of allergic disease has been
associated with deviations in the microbiota characteristics
in
early
life,
such
as
depletion
of
Lactobacillus
and/or
Bifidobacterium37–39, colonization with Bacteroides fragilis40
and members of Proteobacteria41, as well as low diversity42.
All of these characteristics were present in the recently macrolide-
treated children in our cohort, suggesting that macrolide use
alters the microbiota in a way that disrupts the healthy immune
system development. Furthermore, other factors, which alter
the microbiota in a similar manner, such as Caesarean section,
lack of breastfeeding and pre- and perinatal stress, predispose
to asthma43. A specific case is the 10-fold increased levels
of Eggerthella spp. observed after macrolide exposure. Most
Eggerthella
spp.
are
pathogens44
and
may
promote
an
inflammatory response. Experimental evidence from animal
models
shows
that
antibiotics
in
early
life
disrupt
the
microbiota
and thereby the development of the immune
system, leading to airway hyper-responsiveness in susceptible
individuals9,45.
To conclude, macrolide use was associated with microbiota
characteristics that have previously been associated with the risk
of immunological and metabolic diseases, as well as obesity.
Furthermore, macrolide use promoted a marked increase in
macrolide resistance of the microbiota. Our results confirm and
extend previous results from mouse experiments10,11 and indicate
that macrolide use may have undesired effects on the developing
microbiota of children, which may compromise the development
of a healthy immune system and metabolism.
Methods
Study cohort. Our cohort consists of 236 Finnish children aged 2–7 years (median
age 5 years), attending the same day-care centres at the time of the study. Register-
based information and full background information was available for all children;
142 children donated fecal samples. The children are part of a larger cohort
originally recruited for a probiotic trial46. Details on the recruitment and exclusion
criteria are available in the original publication presenting the cohort46. Written
informed consent was obtained from the parents and the local ethical committees
approved the study. The children attended a health check in the beginning of the
study, during which weight and height were measured. Based on the weight and
height, BMI z-scores were calculated according to the LMS parameters obtained
from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Data on allergies were
obtained from questionnaires filled out by the parents. Nearly all (495%) of the
children had received breastfeeding (470% for at least 6 months), as this is highly
promoted in Finland where mothers obtain leave of absence for up to 3 years with
job guarantees. All children that developed asthma had received breastfeeding, and
all but one received it for 6 months or more. The children received three daily
meals at the day-care centre; the majority of their diet was thus largely similar.
Furthermore, income inequality in Finland is low compared with other western
countries47, suggesting that socio-economic differences were fairly small. A total of
257 fecal samples were obtained from 142 children who donated either a single
sample (27 children) or two samples (115 children; samples were taken 7 months
apart; Supplementary Fig. 1). This sub-cohort was utilized to analyse the
association between antibiotic use and the intestinal microbiota.
Antibiotic purchase and chronic illness data. In Finland, antibiotics are only
available by prescription. Information on antibiotic purchases was obtained
from the records of the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, which subsidizes
health-care costs. We collected data on all antibiotics purchased for the study
children from the date of birth to the date of donation of the last fecal sample.
Individuals with chronic illnesses are eligible for special reimbursement of their
drug purchases, and the eligibility information is stored in the national database.
We collected data on diagnosed asthma and allergic dermatitis (until the end
of 2012), the most common developing chronic illnesses in the study cohort.
The antibiotics were grouped into penicillins (amoxicillin with or without
clavulanic acid and penicillin V), macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin),
first-generation cephalosporins and sulphonamide–trimethoprim. The latter two
groups of antibiotics were very seldom used, and therefore we focused on the
penicillin and macrolide use. Azithromycin and clarithromycin became available in
Finnish ambulatory care in 1994 and 1996, respectively, that is, before the birth of
the study children. In our cohort, 50% of all antibiotic purchases were penicillins,
24% macrolides and the rest cephalosporins and sulfonamide–trimethoprim.
These figures correspond to the population level data from Finland48 and other
countries as well49.
Based on the parent-reported symptoms during the 7-month interval, we were
able to assign potential indications for the use of antibiotics during the interval
period. Respiratory infections were the most common apparent indication,
occurring in association with 88% of the courses; other infections (mainly of the
urinary tract) were associated with 5% and no concurrent reported symptoms with

 7% of the courses. The antibiotic courses were not prescribed for gastrointestinal
infections; pediatric gastrointestinal infections in Finland are nearly always viral
and hence not treated with antibiotics. According to the physician in charge of the
study, concurrent symptoms, indications for the antibiotics, symptom severity or
disease history of the children receiving macrolides during the interval period did
not differ from those receiving penicillins. Macrolides were typically prescribed due
to presumed penicillin allergy or parents’ request owing to easy administration or
previous experience.
Associations between health and antibiotic use were analysed using the full
cohort of 236 children. Associations between antibiotic use and BMI z-score were
assessed using Pearson correlations. Associations between antibiotic use during the
first 2 years of life and asthma (N ¼ 15), and allergic dermatitis (N ¼ 5) were
assessed using the Fisher’s test.
Processing of the fecal samples. The fecal samples were collected at home and
transported immediately to the study centre for storage in � 70 �C. DNA was
extracted from the fecal samples using the Promega Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification Kit as described50. Concentration of DNA was measured with
NanoDrop and adjusted to 10 ng ml � 1.
Sequencing. Bacterial composition was investigated using 454 Titanium
sequencing of the V4–V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene (primers S-D-Bact-0564-a-
S-15/S and Univ-1100-a-A-15 that have been recommended for pyrosequencing51).
The sequences were filtered for chimeras with the Uchime programme52. Reads
shorter than 501 bp were filtered out. We discarded four samples with o1,000
reads. Read numbers were not equalized by rarefying as this procedure causes a
significant and unnecessary loss of data53. After pre-processing, we had a total
of 2,262,107 reads from 257 samples (on average 8,801 reads per sample, range
1,469–14,653 reads per sample). De novo operational taxonomic unit (OTU)
picking was done using Qiime version 1.8.0 (ref. 54). The Uclust method was used
to map the OTUs to the Greengenes 13.8 taxonomy. To avoid a batch effect, we
normalized the data following a method we have developed earlier55. The number
of reads was controlled for by keeping it as a covariate in all relevant models.
Number of reads was not associated with observed diversity or richness
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform was
conducted on 14 samples derived from children, which were all treated with
macrolide antibiotics during the 7-month interval period. Analysis of the antibiotic
resistome was conducted as detailed previously56. In brief, by using the MOCAT
pipeline, Illumina sequencing reads, following trimming and quality control, were
mapped to a catalogue of 3.3 M gene sequences, previously assembled from
publically available human gut microbial metagenomes. Out of these reference
genes, we identified members of the antibiotic-resistant gene families annotated in
the ARDB database. This was done by first augmenting database with further
homologues from an in-house collection of 3,496 bacterial genomes from
GenBank, and then identifying homologues of the resulting gene set among the
reference genes using the ARDB family-specific sequence identity thresholds for
family assignment, using NCBI BLAST. As a result, the abundance of sequence
material coming from reads mapping to members of each antibiotic-resistant gene
family could be quantified. Reference gene sequences were similarly mapped to
functional modules from the KEGG database to allow testing for changes in the
relative abundance of genes encoding different metabolic pathways.
Culture-based antibiotic sensitivity testing. Phenotypic antibiotic-resistant
analysis was conducted by cultivating bacteria anaerobically from 80 fecal samples as
mixed cultures. Bacteria were grown as dilution series on Brain-Heart Infusion agar
(Oxoid) with or without 10mgml � 1 erythromycin (a macrolide antibiotic). Colo-
nies were counted on each plate after 2-day incubation at 37 �C, and the fraction of
resistant colonies was calculated as the number of colony-forming units (c.f.u.’s) per
1 g of sample on the antibiotic plate divided by the c.f.u. on the control plate.
Real-time PCR analysis. The metagenomic analysis indicated that apart from an
increase in macrolide resistance, macrolide use was associated with a decrease in
bile-salt hydrolase genes. We therefore conducted qPCR analyses to quantify the
abundances of these genes in a total of 130 DNA samples from 117 children.
Quantification of bacterial genes bsh, ermB and ermF were performed with primers
specified in Supplementary Table 4. The primers for ermB and ermF genes have
been previously published57. We designed the bsh primers to target this gene in the
dominant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. We focused on species that have
confirmed bile-salt hydrolase activity and no penicillin V amidase activity32
to avoid co-amplification of these highly homologous genes. Hence, we
designed primers for amplification of bsh genes encoded by Bacteroides ovatus,
Ruminococcus obeum and Eubacterium ventriosum based on sequence data
obtained from GenBank using BLAST. The optimal primer concentrations and
annealing temperatures were determined for each assay, and the specificity of the
primer pairs was verified by melting curve analysis as well as agarose gel
electrophoresis to confirm the correct product size. Reactions were run in triplicate
on iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) in a volume
of 25 ml. Each reaction contained 1 � HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix Plus
(Solis Biodyne, Estonia.), 0.5 mM of each primer and 25 ng of fecal DNA. The
amplification protocol involved one cycle at 95 �C for 5 min for initial denaturation
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 �C for 20 s, primer annealing for 20 s,
extension at 72 �C for 30 s and an additional incubation step at 80–82 �C for 30 s to
collect the fluorescence data. The mean Ct value per sample (after excluding
replicates with Ct values that differed 40.5) was used as a proxy for relative
abundance of the target gene.
Antibiotic use study groups. The fecal samples were grouped based on antibiotic
use (Supplementary Table 1). The control group (group C) included samples from
children that had not used antibiotics for a minimum of 2 years, and whose total
lifetime antibiotic use was o1 course per year. The children who had not used
antibiotics for at least 2 years but had a high total lifetime use (at least 1 course per
year of life on average), that is, had used antibiotics frequently during early life but
not recently, were assigned to the early-life group (E). The group M6 consisted of
samples from children that had used macrolide antibiotics within 6 months before
sample donation. The group M12 consisted of samples from children that had used
macrolide antibiotics within 6–12 months before sample donation. The group M24
consisted of samples from children that had used macrolide antibiotics within
12–24 months before sample donation. The group P6 consisted of samples from
children that had used penicillin antibiotics within 6 months before sample
donation. The group P12 consisted of samples from children that had used
penicillin antibiotics within 6–12 months before sample donation. The group
P24 consisted of samples from children that had used penicillin antibiotics within
12–24 months before sample donation.
Indices calculated based on the microbiota. Microbiota richness was calculated
as the number of species-level OTUs (97% similarity cutoff) detected. Microbiota
diversity was calculated as the inverse Simpson diversity index based on the
species-level data. PCoAs were conducted using the genus-level data and
Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. The associations of the first principal components
with background variables such as antibiotic use were visualized by inverse
distance-weighted interpolation of the variable values over the component space.
Microbiota maturity index, which has previously been shown to differentiate
between healthy children and those with health issues58,59, was calculated as the
first principal coordinate from a PCoA using only significantly age-associated
genus-level taxa in the control and early-life groups (Supplementary Table 2).
The group differences in microbial richness (counts of taxa) were evaluated using
negative binomial models and the differences in microbiota maturity (normally
distributed) using analysis of variance.
Association between antibiotic use and bacterial genera. Generalized linear
models with negative binomial distribution (function glm.nb in the library MASS
in R) were used to identify individual bacterial taxa that were associated with
antibiotic use, either as being significantly different in the antibiotic user groups
compared with the control group or significantly linearly associated with the total
lifetime number of macrolide or penicillin courses (per years of life). We focused
only on the 48 genera that we detected in 430% of the samples, in order to avoid
unnecessary P value testing and unreliable results. The detected abundance of rare
genera is likely to be influenced considerably by chance and therefore less reliable
than the abundance of common genera. The main focus of interest was to assess
how the different groups (Supplementary Table 1) differ in their microbiota
composition. However, to control for potentially confounding factors, we included
in all models the following covariates: number of sequencing reads, age of the child,
BMI z-score of the child (which is likely to reflect lifestyle and diet at home), health
status (parent-reported or diagnosed allergies, diagnosed asthma or no known
diseases) and lifetime antibiotic use (when comparing antibiotic user groups) or
antibiotic user group (when assessing the cumulative effect of lifetime antibiotic
use). False disovery rate (FDR)-corrected P values60 were used to correct for
multiple testing. Bacterial taxa, whose abundance was significantly different (FDR-
corrected P value o0.15) from the control group after controlling for all the above-
mentioned variables, were considered potentially influenced by antibiotic use.
Microbiota–health association analysis. To determine whether the asthmatic
cases had distinct features in their microbiota composition, we selected the samples
from all cases with current or developing asthma (N ¼ 8), and two age- and
antibiotic use history-matched healthy controls for each (N ¼ 16). For analysis of
the microbiota–overweight association, we selected the samples from all cases with
BMI z-score 42 (N ¼ 9) and two (if available) age and antibiotic use history-
matched normal-weight controls for each (N ¼ 16). For two overweight indivi-
duals, only one matching control case was available. For the asthma association
analysis, we calculated the average microbiota composition between the first and
second time point samples, if two samples were available. For the overweight
analysis, we used only the first time point sample, as the weight and height were
only recorded once at the beginning of the study. To find the bacterial groups that
best distinguished asthma or overweight cases from healthy or normal-weight
cases, we first fitted binomial models with asthma or overweight as the response
variable, and each genus-level bacterial group separately as an explanatory variable.
We used P values from these models as indicators of discriminating potential, and

 selected all bacterial groups with Po0.2 for further analysis. These groups were
combined as explanatory variables in one model. AIC-based stepwise model
selection was then used to find the set of bacterial groups that best discriminated
between the asthma/overweight and healthy/normal-weight cases.
All statistical analyses were conducted with the programme R (ref. 61) by using
the packages vegan62 for the ordinations and diversity analyses, and MASS63 for
negative binomial models.
