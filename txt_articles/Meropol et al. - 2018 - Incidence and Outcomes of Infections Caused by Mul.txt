Background. The escalating incidence of invasive disease caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative enteric 
Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-GNE) is a global concern. Scant published studies in which the epidemiology of these infections in chil-
dren is described exist; previous studies focused mainly on adults, described circumscribed populations, or lacked clinical detail. 
The objective of this study was to examine and describe the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes associated with MDR-GNE 
infection in children.
Methods. In this cohort study, we used data from 48 children’s hospitals maintained by the Pediatric Health Information System. 
We documented the proportion of MDR-GNE diagnoses among children’s hospital patients aged 0 to <18 years who were diagnosed 
with an Enterobacteriaceae-associated infection between January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2015, and we analyzed the association 
between MDR-GNE infection and hospital length of stay and death before discharge.
Results. During the study period, 107 610 discharges included a diagnosis code for Enterobacteriaceae infection, 724 (0.7%) 
of which included MDR-GNE infection. The incidence of MDR-GNE, and the proportion of infections with Enterobacteriaceae 
organisms that were MDR-GNE increased over the study period; from 0.2% in 2007 to 1.5% by 2015 (test for trend < .001). Almost 
one-quarter (23%) of the infections in children hospitalized for MDR-GNE were nosocomial. Increased odds of MDR-GNE infec-
tion were associated with older age and comorbid illnesses. Lengths of stay in patients with MDR-GNE infection were increased 20% 
(95% confidence interval, 9.9%–30.5%; P < .001) over those without MDR-GNE infection; the increased odds for death did not reach 
statistical significance (1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.98–2.18]; P = .06). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions. The incidence of pediatric MDR-GNE infection increased during 2007–2015. MDR-GNE infection was associ-
ated with increased length of stay, and we found a trend toward increased risk of death. Infections with Gram-negative enteric bacilli 
are becoming increasingly difficult to treat; considering the global burden of these antimicrobial-resistant organisms, interventions 
to curtail or even reverse this trend are needed urgently.

Escalating antibiotic resistance limits treatment options, worsens 
clinical outcomes, and is an evolving global public health crisis. 
The development of new wider-spectrum antibacterial drugs, 
especially those appropriate for children, remains relatively stag-
nant [1–7]. Since the introduction of effective vaccination against 
Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza type B and an 
increase in the prevalence of chronic complex medical conditions, 
Gram-negative enteric bacteria are responsible for an increasing 
proportion of serious bacterial infections in children [8, 9].
The Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of Gram-negative 
enteric bacilli. The US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention called attention to the rising incidence of infections 
caused by Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to almost all 
β-lactam antibiotics, termed here multidrug-resistant Gram-
negative Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-GNE) [10]. These organisms 
include bacteria that express any one of a family of β-lactamases 
that hydrolyze the antibiotic β-lactam ring and confer resis-
tance to penicillins, cephalosporins (including third-generation 
cephalosporins), and monobactams [11]. Genetic material that 
confers multiple resistance mechanisms can be spread among 
bacteria and even among species via mobile genetic elements 
such as plasmids, which then can be transmitted between 
patients and to family and community members [4, 12, 13].
MDR-GNE infection is increasingly prevalent world-
wide, especially in less-developed countries, where antibi-
otics are often available over the counter. Between 2008 and 
2010, 11.4% of Gram-negative bacilli associated with pediatric

 Multi-Drug Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Infections • JPIDS 2018:7 (March) • 37
intra-abdominal infections worldwide were caused by MDR-
GNE (2.5%, 8.8%, and 27% in Europe, Latin America, and 
Asia and the Pacific, respectively) [4, 14–18]. Factors typically 
reported to be associated with a higher risk of MDR-GNE infec-
tion are younger age, female sex, recent antibiotic exposure 
(particularly to fluoroquinolones), recent steroid exposure, 
and comorbid conditions, especially neurologic conditions [4, 
11, 18–23]. Children are at increased risk from adverse out-
comes related to MDR-GNE infection, because only a limited 
number of broad-spectrum antibiotics have been approved for 
pediatric use [11].
Data describing MDR-GNE infections in US children are 
limited. Several reports described outbreaks of MDR-GNE in 
non-US settings and/or in a single US state or city [20–27]. 
Infection outbreaks usually have occurred in intensive care 
units (ICUs); more recently, community-acquired infections 
have become increasingly prevalent [4, 18, 20, 21, 23, 27, 28]. 
Results of studies using US surveillance data suggest that the 
incidence of MDR-GNE infection is rising, but these studies 
included few clinical data [28, 29].
The objectives of this study were to characterize the current 
epidemiology of infection with MDR-GNE in hospitalized US 
children and to assess the relationships between infection and 
resulting length of stay and death.
METHODS
Population
Data for this multicenter retrospective cohort study were 
obtained from the Pediatric Health Information System 
(PHIS), an administrative database that contains inpatient, 
emergency department, ambulatory surgery, and observation 
encounter-level data from 48 children’s hospitals in the United 
States and is affiliated with the Children’s Hospital Association 
(Overland Park, KS). Discharge/encounter data are deidenti-
fied at the time of submission and include demographics, up 
to 41 diagnoses per encounter, and resource utilization (eg, 
drugs, disposition, devices, laboratory testing, procedures). 
Data are updated quarterly and are subjected to a number of 
quality, reliability, and validity checks by the Children’s Hospital 
Association, Truven Health Analytics (Ann Arbor, MI), and 
participating hospitals before being included in the database 
[30]. Not all hospitals joined the PHIS at the same time, and so 
the first year of available data varies among them.
Data on inpatient and observation hospitalizations between 
January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2015, from 48 PHIS hospi-
tals were included in this analysis. The organisms of concern 
were the Enterobacteriaceae. Using demographic data and 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-
9), codes, we identified patients aged 0 to <18 years with a 
primary or secondary discharge diagnosis corresponding to a 
specific Enterobacteriaceae bacterium (Table 1). ICD-9 codes 
have been shown to have good accuracy for identifying hos-
pitalizations that include similar diagnoses (eg, hospitaliza-
tions related to urinary tract infection [31]). Discharges with 
multiple ICD-9 codes for Enterobacteriaceae were counted 
only once.
Outcome and Exposure Variables
Exposure
We were interested in Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to 
third-generation cephalosporins, including MDR organisms 
that expressed extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and 
resistance conferred by other mechanisms (eg, carbapene-
mases, AmpC cephalosporinases) [11, 32]. As we were unable 
to measure this directly, as a surrogate for overall nonspecific 
antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, we defined 
MDR-GNE as the subset of these Enterobacteriaceae dis-
charges that also included the ICD-9 codes: V09.81 “Infection 
with microorganisms with resistance to multiple  drugs” or 
V09.91 “Infection with drug-resistant microorganisms, unspec-
ified, with multiple drug resistance” (Table 2).
We assessed the accuracy of our MDR-GNE diagnosis codes 
in 2 ways. To assess their positive predictive value, for all dis-
charges we identified with an MDR-GNE diagnosis in 2011, 2 
investigators independently reviewed all of the discharge diag-
noses associated with that encounter and their timing (whether 
present on admission). Potential discrepancies were discussed 
with 2 coding specialists from our institution and resolved 
between the 2 investigators. We also compared our results to pub-
licly available 2007–2012 data from the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 
Kids’ Inpatient Database (HCUP-KID). The KID samples data 
from US hospitals to provide national estimates of hospital use 
by US children. We used HCUPnet [33], the HCUP online 
query system, to identify in the KID discharges from chil-
dren’s hospitals with the same ICD-9 diagnosis codes we used 
to query the PHIS database for Enterobacteriaceae organisms. 
We then queried HCUPnet for the V09.81 and V09.91 codes 
for MDR infection. The unit of analysis for this database is the 
diagnosis code, not discharges; thus, the same discharge can 
be included more than once in the query, depending on the 
number of identified diagnosis codes. Therefore, discharges 
with MDR Enterobacteriaceae should have been identified at 
least twice, once with an Enterobacteriaceae code and again 
with either V09.81 or V09.91. Accordingly, we estimated the 
proportion of MDR Enterobacteriaceae as follows: % MDR-
GNE = (MDR Enterobacteriaceae)/(Enterobacteriaceae – MDR 
Enterobacteriaceae).
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were length of stay, measured in days, and 
death before discharge. Our secondary outcome was either 
death or discharge to hospice care.

Covariates
Covariates included age (age in years and age category), sex, 
race, ethnicity, discharge year, insurance payer, the pres-
ence of a comorbidity, pediatric or neonatal ICU stay, and 
US geographic region (Northeast, South, Midwest, or West). 
Interaction terms between discharge year, age, and race were 
considered. Race was dichotomized as black versus nonblack, 
and insurance payer was dichotomized as commercial versus 
public and other, which included Medicaid, Tricare, uninsured, 
and unknown [34]. Individual comorbidities are defined in the 
PHIS as described previously [35]; each comorbidity was con-
sidered separately, and all of them were considered together as 
“any comorbidity,” designating whether any one of the comor-
bidity flags was present.
ANALYSIS
Individual characteristics were summarized using means, 
medians, and percentages for categorical and continuous vari-
ables, as appropriate. We compared characteristics of children 
with versus those without MDR-GNE infection by using bivar-
iate analyses using the χ2 test or nonparametric tests, as noted. 
Approximate χ2 tests based on the score statistic were used to 
test adjusted and unadjusted linear trends of odds. All regres-
sion models adjusted for clustering according to hospital and 
used robust standard errors. Multivariable 0-truncated negative 
binomial regression was used to model the length-of-stay out-
come and to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) [36]. Binary 
logistic regression was used to model the odds of death and 
death-or-hospice outcomes. Model fit was evaluated by using 
the Wald test, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian infor-
mation criterion. Analyses were performed using Stata SE 12.1 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Sensitivity Analyses
The PHIS uses encrypted patient identifiers; to assess for bias 
caused by clustering according to patient, we repeated the pri-
mary analyses using only each patient’s first discharge during 
the study period. Multivariable analysis was also repeated, strat-
ifying according to whether patients had an ICU stay during 
that admission. To assess the effect of missing data on the mor-
tality outcome, we used chained equations to impute the data 
and create 9 imputed data sets; multiple-imputation multivari-
able analysis was repeated to assess the principal outcome using 
all 10 data sets [37]. We also repeated the multivariable anal-
ysis using conditional fixed-effects regression to obtain with-
in-practice estimates of the effect of MDR-GNE on the primary 
death outcome.

 Multi-Drug Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Infections • JPIDS 2018:7 (March) • 39
RESULTS
Our cohort included a total of 107 610 hospital discharges, 
including 94 258 different patients, with a diagnosis of 
Enterobacteriaceae infection in the PHIS database during 
the study period. Table 3 lists the characteristics of patients 
included in this cohort. The mean age was 4.1 years (median, 
1 year [IQR, 0–17 years]). Of all the hospitalizations, 724 (0.7%) 
were associated with MDR-GNE. Although the number of dis-
charges with Enterobacteriaceae-associated infection remained 
relatively stable between 2007 and 2015, the proportion of those 
with MDR-GNE infection rose from 0.2% in January 2007 to 
1.5% by March 2015 (P < .001, test for trend) (Figure 1). This 
trend of increasing odds of MDR-GNE across study years was 
robust to adjustments for age, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 
surgery and surgical complications, mechanical ventilation, 
malignancy, and metabolic, hematologic, respiratory, gastroin-
testinal, and cardiac conditions (P < .001). MDR-GNE infec-
tions were more prevalent in the western United States and were 
similar among the remaining US geographic regions (P < .001). 
Over the course of the study period, MDR-GNE infections were 
increasingly more likely to be associated with hospitalizations 
including an ICU stay; this trend persisted after adjusting for 
age and insurance payer (commercial vs public or uninsured, 
P = .03) (Figure 2).
Sixty-three percent of our cohort overall, and 76% of 
those with MDR-GNE infection, had an Enterobacteriaceae-
associated infection documented on admission; infection tim-
ing could not be determined for 26% of overall admissions or 
10% of admissions with MDR-GNE infection. For 685 of the 
724 MDR-GNE-associated discharges with only 1 documented 
Enterobacteriaceae infection, 525 (77%) were present on admis-
sion; for the remaining 39 discharges with more than 1 docu-
mented Enterobacteriaceae infection, at least 26 (67%) were all 
present on admission, which suggests that at least 551 (76%) 
of the MDR-GNE infections were present on admission. The 
timing of MDR-GNE infection could not be determined using 
PHIS discharge data when Enterobacteriaceae infection diag-
noses were recorded with discordant onsets. Of the 107 610 
discharges in the study period, 27 875 (26%) were missing infor-
mation on diagnosis timing.
In unadjusted analysis, without including covariates 
(Table 3), black patients had lower odds of MDR-GNE infection 
than did white patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.75 [95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.576–0.99]; P = .49); patients of other or mixed 
races had higher odds than did white patients (OR, 1.57 [95% 
CI, 1.29–1.91]; P < .001). The multivariable model adjusted for 
age; sex; discharge year; black race; insurance payer; any ICU 
stay; intravenous nutrition; operating room use; mechanical 
ventilation; malignancy, metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascu-
lar, hematologic/oncologic, and gastrointestinal comorbidities; 
and clustering according to hospital; in this adjusted model, 
the lower odds for black patients was no longer statistically sig-
nificant (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.58–1.03]; P = .08) but remained 
so for patients of other or mixed races (OR, 1.73 [1.42–2.10]; 
P < .001). In the adjusted model, MDR-GNE infection was also 
associated with older age (P < .001), TPN (P = .002), and sur-
gery (P = .027) comorbidity flags but not with sex, metabolic or 
gastrointestinal comorbidities, or public insurance (P = .80, .06, 
.22, and .14, respectively).
Validation of MDR-GNE Coding
Of 84 discharges with an ICD-9 code indicating an MDR-GNE 
diagnosis in 2011, 5 were of indeterminate accuracy: 1 included 
both E coli infection and streptococcal septicemia (unspecified 
type); 1 included Klebsiella, E coli, and Haemophilus influenza 
(unspecified type) infections; 1 included E coli, streptococcal, 
and H influenza infections; 1 included E coli and Pseudomonas 
infections; and 1 included both Klebsiella and Pseudomonas 
infections. Even if all 5 of these diagnoses were incorrect, our 
positive predictive value would be 79/84 (at least 94%).
Comparison With HCUP KID Data
The HCUP-KID–estimated proportions of MDR-GNE–related 
infections were 0.8% in 2006 and 1.7% in 2012 for all children’s 
hospitals and 0.8% in 2006 and 1.9% in 2012 for freestanding 
children’s hospitals.
Length of Stay
The length-of-stay distribution was skewed to the right (median, 
4 days [IQR, 2–23]). In an unadjusted analysis, the mean length 
of stay for patients hospitalized with an MDR-GNE–related 
diagnosis was 21.4 days versus 17.3 days for patients without 
an MDR-GNE–related diagnosis (median, 7 vs 4 days, respec-
tively; P < .001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Table 4 and Figure 3).
In unadjusted 0-truncated negative binomial regression 
analysis, the IRR for length of stay for patients with versus 
those without MDR-GNE infection was 1.235, which indicates 
that patients with MDR-GNE infection had a 23.5% increased 
length of stay compared with patients without MDR-GNE 
infection (Table 4). The fully adjusted final multivariable model 
included age; black race; any chronic condition; TPN; surgery; 
mechanical ventilation; malignancy; neonatal ICU stay; and 
metabolic, hematologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and car-
diac conditions; patients with MDR-GNE infection had a 19.8% 
increased mean length of stay (95% CI, 9.9%–30.5%; P < .001). 
This increased length of stay depending on MDR-GNE status 
was unchanged across the study years (<1% change in IRR; P = 
.81 for the interaction term). Black patients had an 11.2% higher 
mean length of stay compared with nonblack patients.
Patients with any ICU stay experienced, on average, a slightly 
lower impact of MDR-GNE infection on their length of stay 
than patients without an ICU stay when we adjusted for all other 
covariates (20.7% [95% CI, 11.6–30.6] increased length of stay for

ICU patients vs 21.5% [95% CI, 8.4–36.3] increased length of stay 
for those without an ICU stay); this interaction did not reach sta-
tistical significance. Results of analysis using only each patient’s 
first admission during the study period were essentially the same; 
patients with MDR-GNE infection experienced an increased 
mean length of stay of 21.8% (95% CI, 9.4–35.7; P < .001).
Death Before Discharge
As shown in Table 3, 1882 patients died before discharge, and 
2048 either died or were discharged to hospice care; disposition 
data for 14.2% of the discharges were missing.
Patients who were diagnosed with an MDR-GNE infection had 
a higher crude risk of death before discharge compared with those 
without MDR-GNE infection (2.9% vs 1.7%; P < .001) (Table 3). 
In the regression models, adjusted only for clustering according 
to hospital, the OR for death for patients with versus those with-
out MDR-GNE infection was 1.54 (95% CI, 0.99–2.4; P = .058). 
The multivariable fully adjusted model included age; year; TPN; 
surgery and surgical complications; mechanical ventilation; any 
ICU stay; insurance payer; malignancy; hematologic, metabolic, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions; and 
the interaction between any chronic condition and year; the OR 
for death before discharge in a comparison of patients with versus 
those without MDR-GNE infection was 1.46 (95% CI, 0.98–2.18; 
P = .06). Results from the sensitivity analysis, the multiple-impu-
tation analysis, and an analysis using only the first discharge of 
each patient were essentially unchanged from the primary analysis 
(Table 4).
The adjusted OR for the composite variable death or dis-
charge to hospice was similar to that for death before discharge 
at 1.35 (0.89–2.06; P = .16). Results from the multiple impu-
tation analysis, in which we used only the first discharge of 
each patient and conditional within-practice analysis, were 
unchanged from the primary analysis (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
To the extent of our knowledge, this study was the first to exam-
ine the epidemiology of MDR-GNE infection across US chil-
dren’s hospitals. We found that the incidence of infection with 
MDR-GNE has increased over the past 8 years from 0.2% in 
2007 to 1.5% by March 2015; the rise has been even faster for 
patients admitted to an ICU.
Few previous study reports have described the chang-
ing epidemiology of pediatric MDR-GNE infection in the 
United States. Logan et al [28], who used US surveillance data, 
characterized Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 368 398 chil-
dren older than 1 year and found an increasing incidence of 
MDR-GNE between 1999 and 2011. In 2011, 2% and 0.5% of 
Enterobacteriaceae isolates expressed third-generation ceph-
alosporin resistance and ESBL-related resistance, respectively. 
Although the PHIS did not provide culture data and so we can-
not report patterns or mechanisms of resistance to specific anti-
biotics, our MDR-GNE definition should identify organisms 
relatively comparable to their organisms of interest, so it is reas-
suring that their estimates are similar to our findings.
KID data estimated 0.8% of Enterobacteriaceae infections 
to be MDR-GNE for all children’s hospitals and freestanding 
children’s hospitals in 2006 and 1.7% and 1.9% for all children’s 
hospitals and freestanding children’s hospitals, respectively,

in 2012. Our MDR-GNE rates were 0.2% in 2007 and 0.8% in 
2012, relatively consistent with the KID results, considering the 
different unit of analysis in the HCUPnet. The HCUPnet pro-
vides only aggregate data, has limited demographic and clini-
cal information, and uses diagnosis code as the unit of analysis; 
thus, discharges including multiple queried diagnosis codes (ie, 
multiple Enterobacteriaceae infections) are counted more than 
once, and admission rates can be overestimated. In addition, the 
cohort of HCUPnet discharges coded with our multidrug-resis-
tance codes can include some patients infected with organisms 
that were not Enterobacteriaceae.
We found that older children, children with comorbidities, 
and those in the western United States were more likely to be 
infected with MDR-GNE, but we found no differences based on 
sex or insurance coverage. We found inconsistent risks based 
on race (lower risks of MDR-GNE infection for white and black 
children than for those of other races and those of mixed race). 
Reasons underlying these disparities are unknown. Consistent 
with our results, Logan et al [28] reported that children with 
underlying comorbidities had the highest proportion of MDR-
GNE isolates; their findings that younger children, girls, and 
children in the central United States were also at higher risk dif-
fered from our results.
MDR-GNE infections are associated with poor outcomes in 
adults yet this has been inconsistently shown in children [20, 23, 
26, 38]. We found that MDR-GNE infections were associated 
with longer lengths of stay and a trend toward a higher mortal-
ity rate. Point estimates and CIs of unadjusted versus adjusted 
models were similar for both mortality outcomes, death before 
discharge and death or discharge to hospice. Our results suggest

that if there is an increased risk of death for patients with MDR-
GNE infection, the difference is too small to be detected, even 
with our large sample size.
This study had limitations. Our organisms of interest were 
those in the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae associated with 
pediatric bacterial infections in the United States for which there 
were specific ICD-9 codes [11]. The results do not generalize to 
children in other countries or to those with an infection caused 
by other organisms. The results do not necessarily generalize to 
pediatric discharges from hospitals other than children’s hospi-
tals. Although the PHIS data have certain limitations, they offer 
researchers an opportunity to examine a rare but concerning 
diagnosis of interest across a large number of US children’s hos-
pitals. We believe that there are no previous studies that used 
the codes we used to identify MDR-GNE; however, we found 
that these codes had a high positive predictive value for iden-
tifying admissions of pediatric patients with an infection asso-
ciated with MDR Enterobacteriaceae. There was no way for us 
to directly identify third-generation cephalosporin resistance 
or specific mechanisms of resistance (eg, ESBLs, carbapene-
mases, AmpC cephalosporinases). Gauging the sensitivity of 
these codes was beyond the scope of this study. It is conceiva-
ble that, over the course of the study period, the increasing rate 
of MDR-GNE infection reflected increasing sensitivity of diag-
nosing and coding for these infections and/or that discharges 
including more severe outcomes might have been more likely 
to have been identified as MDR-GNE related; similar limita-
tions afflict any observational study in which claims data are 
used. The PHIS does not include culture data, and we did not 
have the resources to obtain culture data from PHIS hospitals; 
thus, isolate resistance patterns and mechanisms of resistance 
are not included here. To our knowledge, timing of infection 
in the PHIS has not been validated; this variable was missing 
for more than one-quarter of our diagnoses, and for children 
with more than 1 Enterobacteriaceae diagnosis, we could not 
always ascertain the timing of the particular MDR-GNE infec-
tion. We also were not able to determine whether the patients 
had unrecorded risk factors (eg, chronic health conditions and 
social determinants of health) before admission that put them 
at higher risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This

information could be difficult to tease out; we would not want 
to treat variables as confounders if they are truly mediators, and 
we would not necessarily want to adjust for them if they could 
be in the causal chain between MDR-GNE infection and the 
outcome. Our similar results using only the first admission of 
each child are reassuring in that results are not necessarily dif-
ferent for children with multiple admissions. The high propor-
tion of community-acquired infections needs to be confirmed 
using other data sources. It would be ideal to have preadmis-
sion data on antibiotic exposure, which might put a child at 
greater risk of a resistant infection. The missing disposition data 
could have biased our results; it is reassuring that our results 
were robust to reanalysis using imputed data. Sicker patients are 
likely to receive more antibiotics, to be at risk of colonization 
and infection with resistant organisms, to experience longer 
hospitalizations, and to have adverse outcomes. To the extent 
that they were measured, our models adjusted for confounding 
by comorbidities; however, future studies will need to address 
residual confounding, the underlying causal relationships, and 
their directionality among these clinical variables.
In conclusion, we found that infections with MDR-GNE 
have increased by more than 700% between 2007 and 2015 
for pediatric patients admitted to children’s hospitals and are 
associated with an increased length of stay and a trend toward 
a higher mortality rate. Previously described as mostly noso-
comial, most MDR-GNE infections in this recent cohort were 
present on admission. Hospital surveillance cultures, strict 
cohorting, limited use of third-generation cephalosporins, and 
restricted agricultural antibiotic use have been recommended 
for reducing MDR-GNE colonization and related infection [11]. 
The march of escalating antibiotic resistance seems inexorable; 
however, thoughtful and thorough efforts to reverse this trend 
can be successful [2, 39, 40]. Considering the global skyrocket-
ing incidence of MDR-GNE infection, we must be vigilant and 
do everything possible to curtail, or even reverse, this process.
