Despite critical roles of the hypothalamic arcuate neurons in controlling the growth and
energy homeostasis, the gene regulatory network directing their development remains
unclear. Here we report that the transcription factors Dlx1/2 and Otp coordinate the balanced
generation of the two functionally related neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus,
GHRH-neurons promoting the growth and AgRP-neurons controlling the feeding and energy
expenditure. Dlx1/2-deficient mice show a loss-of-GHRH-neurons and an increase of AgRP-
neurons, and consistently develop dwarfism and consume less energy. These results indicate
that Dlx1/2 are crucial for specifying the GHRH-neuronal identity and, simultaneously, for
suppressing AgRP-neuronal fate. We further show that Otp is required for the generation of
AgRP-neurons and that Dlx1/2 repress the expression of Otp by directly binding the Otp
gene. Together, our study demonstrates that the identity of GHRH- and AgRP-neurons is
synchronously specified and segregated by the Dlx1/2-Otp gene regulatory axis.

1234567890():,;
 T
he hypothalamus is a central regulator of the homeostatic
processes that are essential to survival and reproducton1,2.
Among the multiple hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate
nucleus (ARC) is particularly receptive to various peripheral cues
because it is located in proximity to the blood stream. Thus, in the
central nervous system, the ARC serves as a primary gatekeeper
and processor for the peripheral signals in directing the growth,
energy balance, and reproductive behaviors in response to such
cues1,2. Numerous investigations for the past decades1,2 sig-
nificantly enhanced our understanding of physiological roles of
the ARC. The highly interconnected actions among the arcuate
neurons in striking the body homeostasis raise the possibility that
the distinct arcuate neuronal types are generated in a coordinated
manner during hypothalamus development. However, the gene
regulatory network that orchestrates their production remains
poorly understood.
The ARC is composed of many different types of neurons that
express specific sets of neuropeptides and elicit disparate phy-
siological actions3. These include the agouti-related protein
(AgRP)-neurons and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-neurons,
which play crucial roles in maintaining energy homeostasis1. The
AgRP-neurons secrete AgRP and neuropeptide Y (NPY), both of
which increase food intake and decrease energy expenditure. In
contrast,
the
POMC-neurons
express
both
cocaine
and
amphetamine-related
transcript
(CART)
and
melanocyte-
stimulating hormone-α (αMSH), which is derived from the pre-
cursor peptide POMC. The αMSH released from POMC-neurons
decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure1. Thus,
the AgRP- and POMC-neurons exhibit the opposing activities in
determining the levels of food intake and energy consumption.
Interestingly, 17~25% of AgRP-neurons are derived from POMC-
expressing cells4, indicating a close developmental link between
AgRP- and POMC-neurons. Another critical neuronal type in the
ARC is the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)-neu-
rons that release GHRH2. The GHRH triggers the secretion of the
growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland2. GH
then triggers expression in the liver of insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF1). IGF1 regulates bone epiphyses, growth plate develop-
ment, muscle and adipose tissue development, and glucose
homeostasis2. The control for nutritional status and linear growth
needs to be coupled. Supporting this notion, it has been well-
established that GH/GHRH levels are inversely correlated with
the circulating level of the anorexic hormone leptin that targets
arcuate neurons to control the energy balance5–7. Given the
physiological importance of the tight linkage between the energy
balance and linear growth, it is possible that the production of
GHRH-neurons is coordinated with the generation of AgRP-
and/or POMC-neurons. To date, however, little has been known
about whether and how the development of growth-promoting
GHRH-neurons is connected to the formation of AgRP- or
POMC-neurons that regulate the energy homeostasis.
Distal-less homeobox-1 (Dlx1) and its homolog Dlx2 are the
homeodomain transcription factors that play important and
redundant roles in the fate specification of GABA+ and tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons in the forebrain8–12. The immuno-
chemical analyses with a pan-Dlx antibody detecting multiple Dlx
factors revealed that Dlx factors are expressed in TH+ neurons
and non-AgRP-neuronal type GABA+ neurons in the ARC13.
Adult Dlx1-null mice show a twofold reduction in the number of
TH+ neurons in the ARC13; whereas, the role of Dlx2 in the
hypothalamus remains unexplored. We found that Dlx1 and Dlx2
are robustly expressed in the embryonic ARC by analyzing the
three datasets, www.brain-map.org, www.genepaint.org, and the
seminal work of Blackshaw and colleagues14, consistent with the
earlier report15. This expression pattern suggests a possible role of
Dlx1 and Dlx2 in the fate specification or differentiation of
arcuate neurons. Orthopedia (Otp) is the homeodomain tran-
scription factor that is expressed in the several hypothalamic
nuclei including the ARC16. Otp-null mice die perinatally and
lack somatostatin (Sst)+ arcuate neurons16, suggesting a role of
Otp in the ARC development. Interestingly, Otp and Dlx1 are
expressed in alternating domains in the embryonic hypothala-
mus16–18, and Dlx1 expression domain is expanded in pre-
sumptive paraventricular nuclei (PVN) in Otp-null mice16,
suggesting an antagonistic relationship between the two tran-
scription factors. However, the role of Dlx1/2 and Otp in the fate
specification of arcuate neurons and how Dlx1/2 and Otp are
linked in the gene regulatory network that governs the production
of distinct arcuate neuronal types remains poorly understood.
Here our studies revealed that Dlx1/2 and Otp are required for
the specification of GHRH- and AgRP-neurons, respectively.
Furthermore, we found that Dlx1/2 suppress AgRP-neuronal fate
by directly binding and repressing the Otp gene, uncovering a
novel Dlx1/2-Otp gene regulatory axis critical for the segregation
of GHRH- and AgRP-neuronal fates. Together, our data provide,
for the first time, the evidence that GHRH- and AgRP-neuronal
fates are interconnected, and suggest that the Dlx1/2-Otp axis
plays a role in producing a balanced ratio of AgRP- to GHRH-
neurons in the hypothalamus.
Results
Dlx1/2 are expressed in the developing ARC. To understand the
role of Dlx1 and Dlx2 in ARC development, we investigated their
expression pattern in the developing murine hypothalamus. We
found that both Dlx1 and Dlx2 are highly enriched in the ARC at
E16.5 (Fig. 1a). Consistently, the publically available datasets
(www.brain-map.org, www.genepaint.org and Shimogori et al.14)
show that Dlx1 and Dlx2 are highly expressed in the mediobasal
hypothalamus, from which the ARC is derived, at E11.5, and that
Dlx1/2 continue to be expressed in the ARC in the mature brain.
These overlapping expression patterns suggest that Dlx1 and Dlx2
may function redundantly in the ARC, similarly to their roles in
the developing forebrain11.
We next analyzed the expression of Dlx1 in GHRH-, AgRP-,
and POMC-neurons, the three major types of ARC neurons that
control the growth and energy balance. In the embryonic ARC,
Dlx1 was expressed in most GHRH-neurons (Fig. 1b), whereas it
was not expressed in POMC-neurons that are visualized by the
Pomc-eGfp transgenic allele19 (Fig. 1c). As AgRP expression in
the ARC begins only perinatally, we labeled AgRP-neurons in the
embryonic ARC using the Npy-hrGfp transgenic mice20, in which
GFP is expressed in embryonic AgRP-neurons before the
induction of AgRP. At E14.5 and E17.5, Dlx1 was mostly
excluded from GFP+ neurons (Fig. 1d), although 12~15% of
GFP+ neurons that express GFP at a low level were co-stained
with Dlx1 (arrows in Fig. 1d).
We also examined the expression of Dlx1 in other cell types in
the ARC. Our results revelaed that Dlx1 is expressed neither in
KNDy-neurons (which express Kiss1) (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b)
nor tanyctes in the ARC (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We also found
that Dlx1 is expressed in neither Olig2+ oligodendrocytes nor
GFAP + astrocytes in the ARC (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
Taken together, these results suggest that Dlx1 may play a role
in the development of GHRH-neurons, but less likely in the
formation of POMC-neurons, AgRP-neurons or other arcuate
cell types.
Dual roles of Dlx1/2 in GHRH-/AgRP-neuronal fate decision.
To inactivate both Dlx1 and Dlx2 in the developing ARC, we
generated conditional Dlx1/2-null mice (Dlx1/2cKO) in which the
genomic region encompassing Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes is deleted by

 Nkx2.1-Cre, which broadly deletes genes in several cell types of
the developing ARC (e.g., GABA+, NPY+, POMC+, TH+ neu-
rons)21,22. Our immunostaining analysis confirmed that Dlx1
expression was eliminated in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Fig. 3a). The overall shape of ARC was compar-
able between Dlx1/2cKO embryos and their controls. Interesingly,
the size of the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice became smaller than their
controls at postnatal stages, but the numer of NeuN+ neurons
were not different (Supplementary Fig. 3b), suggesting that the
ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice may have a non-neuronal issue such as a
decrease in extracellular matrix. Importantly, GHRH-neurons
were lost in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice at E15.5 and P28 (Fig. 2b,
c). TH+ neurons were also significantly reduced in the ARC of
Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 2a). Given that ~76% of GHRH-neurons
express TH23, a loss-of-GHRH-neurons in Dlx1/2cKO mice likely
contributes to the reduction of TH+ neurons. In addition, the
expression of Gsx1 and Hmx2, which drive the expression of
GHRH and Gsx1, respectively24,25, was significantly reduced in
E15.5 Dlx1/2cKO ARC in comparison to their controls (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3c). These results indicate that Dlx1/2 are required
for the production of GHRH-neurons during hypothalamus
development.
Next, we asked whether the removal of Dlx1/2 affects other
ARC neuronal types. Strikingly, we observed a marked increase in
NPY expression in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice at E15.5 (Fig. 2b).
Although it was difficult to count the exact number of NPY+
cells, more cells were labeled with NPY in Dlx1/2cKO mice
(Fig. 2b). These results raise an interesting possibility that the
generation of AgRP-neurons increase in the absence of Dlx1/2.
Consistent with this idea, the number of neurons expressing Bsx1,
the transcription factor critical for AgRP gene induction26, was
also increased in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 2a). Also more
cells (as determined by enhanced ISH signal density as well as a
larger area of ISH signals) appear to be labeled with Sst in the
ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 2b). Considering that a subtype of
AgRP-neurons express Sst3, increased Sst+ neurons together with
the increase in the number of Bsx+ neurons (Fig. 2a) can be, at
least partly, attributed to an increase in the number of AgRP-
neurons. In the postnatal hypothalamus, similar observations
were also made for NPY and AgRP in Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 2c).

 Consistent
with
the
report
that
most
AgRP-neurons
are
GABAergic27, we also observed an increased expression of
glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1), a GABAergic neuronal
marker (Fig. 2c). In contrast to NPY/AgRP, POMC expression
did not show a significant difference between Dlx1/2cKO and
control mice (Fig. 2b, c). Together, in the absence of Dlx1/2, the
formation of AgRP-neurons is likely facilitated and, interestingly,
these aberrantly generated AgRP-neurons persist at postnatal
stages in Dlx1/2cKO mice.
Our results also revealed that the expression of Kiss1, a marker
for KNDy-neurons in the ARC, was not significantly altered in
Dlx1/2cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a), consistent with the lack
of Dlx1 expression in KNDy-neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).
Taken together, our results suggest that Dlx1/2 are needed for
the generation of GHRH-neurons and the suppression of AgRP-
neuronal fate in the developing ARC. Our data suggest that Dlx1/
2 play a role in striking a balance between the formation of
GHRH- and AgRP-neurons.
Defects in growth and energy expenditure in Dlx1/2-null mice.
A remarkable change in GHRH- and AgRP-neurons in Dlx1/2cKO
mice prompted us to ask how this alteration in ARC neuronal
composition affects the growth and energy balance in mutant
mice. While Dlx1/2cKO mice were born according to the Men-
delian ratio, ~47% of male and ~85% of female Dlx1/2cKO mice
died within 3 months after birth (Fig. 3a), indicating that they are
vulnerable to death. Notably, the surviving Dlx1/2cKO mice were
dwarf as evident from their shorter body length and smaller body
weight than the littermate controls at P28 (Fig. 3b, c). To
investigate the activity of ‘hypothalamic GHRH → pituitary GH →
hepatic IGF1’ axis, we monitored the expression of IGF1 in the
liver and blood glucose levels. Dlx1/2cKO mice displayed a drastic
decrease in hepatic IGF1, as well as significantly reduced blood
glucose levels compared to their littermate controls (Fig. 3c). Our
data suggest that the hypothalamic GHRH signaling is likely
impaired in Dlx1/2cKO mice.
The two major actions of AgRP-neurons are to increase food
intake and to reduce energy expenditure1. Thus we analyzed if
Dlx1/2cKO mice, which appear to possess more AgRP-neurons in
the hypothalamus, show any changes in these aspects. Intrigu-
ingly, by 3~4 months of age, Dlx1/2cKO mice became obese and
displayed significantly higher fat mass than the littermate controls
despite their smaller body weight (Fig. 3d). This accumulated fat
mass in Dlx1/2cKO mice were even more evident when the
reduced body weight was taken into consideration (right panel in
Fig. 3d). In contrast, the lean mass decreased in Dlx1/2cKO mice
compared to their control mice (Fig. 3d). This obesity phenotype,
along with increased AgRP expression in the hypothalamus,
suggests that Dlx1/2cKO mice may take more food and/or
comsume less energy. However, Dlx1/2cKO and their control
mice did not significantly differ in food intake throughout the
diurnal cycles (Fig. 3e), suggesting that the orexigenic aspect of
AgRP-neuronal action was not augmented in Dlx1/2cKO mice (see
discussion). We next monitored the energy expenditure by
measuring oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.
Dlx1/2cKO mice showed a significantly lower energy consumption
than their littermate controls (Fig. 3f). These results suggest that
the energy saving aspect of AgRP-neuronal action was enhanced
in Dlx1/2cKO mice and that this at least partly contributed to the
obese phenotype. Two of the major mechanisms for AgRP
neurons to suppress energy consumption is to block locomotor
activity28 and thermogenesis29–31. Interestingly, Dlx1/2cKO mice
showed strikingly reduced overall activity (Fig. 3g). Moreover
Dlx1/2cKO mice became sicker and died even earlier when housed
individually than when accommodated as a group, pointing to the
possibility that Dlx1/2cKO mice are impaired in maintaining the
core body temperature. Indeed, Dlx1/2cKO female mice showed a
significantly lower body temperature than their controls at room
temperature, and Dlx1/2cKO male mice also displayed a similar
trend for lower body temperature without reaching statistical
significance (Fig. 3h). Also, the body temperature of Dlx1/2cKO
female mice dropped more quickly than their controls upon the
cold
exposure
(5 °C)
(Supplementary
Fig.
3d).
When
we
measured the expression of Ucp1, the major thermogenic factor
in the brown adipocytes, 60 min after the cold exposure, when the
body
temperature
of
Dlx1/2cKO
female
mice
was
lowest
(Supplementary Fig. 3d), Ucp1 expression was significantly lower
in Dlx1/2cKO female mice relative to control female mice
(Supplementary Fig. 3e). Moreover, under the same condition
(60 min post cold exposure), brown adipocytes of Dlx1/2cKO
female mice showed hypertrophy in comparison to control female
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3f). Together, Dlx1/2cKO mice, which
appear to possess an increased number of AgRP-neurons in the
hypothalamus, showed suppressed energy consumption but not
increased food intake.
Collectively, our analyses revealed that Dlx1/2cKO mice exhibit
physiological changes in growth and energy balance in agreement
with a loss-of-GHRH-neurons and a gain-of-AgRP-neurons in
the hypothalamus.
Dlx1/2 directly bind and repress the Otp gene. To elucidate the
molecular mechanism by which Dlx1/2 control the formation of
GHRH- and AgRP-neurons in the developing hypothalamus, we
performed ChIPseq analyses with our anti-Dlx1 antibody (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5) in E16 mouse hypothalami. We obtained a
total of 932 Dlx1-bound ChIPseq peaks (p < 0.001), including a
peak (P27) encompassing the previously reported Dlx1/2-bound
binding site32 in the intergenic region of Dlx5 and Dlx6 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6a, Supplementary Data 1, GSE104372). Inter-
estingly, ~80% of Dlx1-bound ChIPseq peaks were located in
intergenic or intronic regions, whereas only ~11% of the peaks
were found in the promoter region (Fig. 4a). De novo motif
analysis revealed that two motifs are significantly enriched in
Dlx1-bound genomic regions; Dlx1/2- and NHLH1-binding
motifs (Fig. 4b). Both motifs were located around the summit
of Dlx1-bound peaks (Fig. 4c), suggesting that they serve as the
sequences recruiting Dlx1 to the motif-bearing genomic regions.
Among putative direct target genes of Dlx1 that our ChIPseq
analyses identified, Otp is a good candidate for mediating the
action of Dlx1 in the ARC, given that Otp is expressed in the ARC
and it is important for the formation of Sst+ neurons in this
region16. Dlx1 was recruited to a peak located at ~4 kb
downstream region of Otp, named Otp-P29 (Fig. 4d). Our ChIP
assays in E16.5 hypothalami further validated the binding of Dlx1
to Otp-P29 (Fig. 4e). Otp-P29 contains multiple Dlx1/2-binding
motifs that are evolutionarily conserved, but not NHLH1-binding
motifs (Supplementary Fig. 6b). To test how Dlx1/2 influence the
transcriptional activity of Otp-P29, we constructed a luciferase
reporter whose luciferase expression is directed by Otp-P29. We
also generated another luciferase reporter containing the known
Dlx1-binding site in the Dlx5/6 intergenic region32 (Dlx5/6-P27,
Supplementary Fig. 6a). Dlx1 and Dlx2 enhanced the transcrip-
tional activity of Dlx5/6-P27 in luciferase assays in HEK293 cells;
whereas, the DNA-binding-defective mutant form of Dlx2 (Dlx2-
QE, Supplementary Fig. 5a) failed to do so (Fig. 4f, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7a), consistent with the report that Dlx1/2 activate the
expression of Dlx5/6 by binding to Dlx5/6-P27 region32. In
contrast to Dlx5/6-P27, Dlx1 and Dlx2 repressed the transcrip-
tional activity of Otp-P29, whereas Dlx2-QE did not (Fig. 4f,
Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that Dlx1/2 directly bind to

 Dlx1/2-response elements and inhibit the transcriptional activity
of Otp-P29. To further test the effect of Dlx1 on Otp-P29 in vivo,
we generated a GFP reporter whose GFP expression is driven by
Otp-P29, and electroporated this Otp-P29:GFP reporter with Dlx1
expression vector or control vector in chick neural tube using an
in ovo electroporation technique. Dlx1 inhibited GFP expression
driven by Otp-P29 in the neural tube (Fig. 4g), indicating that
Dlx1 binding to Otp-P29 leads to transcriptional repression
in vivo (Fig. 4h). Interestingly, the ectopically expressed Dlx1 also
suppressed the endogenous expression of Otp, but not that of Isl1,
in the ventral neural tube (Supplementary Fig. 7b), further
demonstrating that Dlx1 inhibits Otp expression in vivo.
To test the regulatory relationship between Dlx1/2 and Otp in
the ARC, we examined their expression profile in the developing
ARC. Dlx1 and Otp were expressed in a mutually exclusive
pattern in the ARC of E13.5/14.5 WT mice (Fig. 4i). Interestingly,

 Otp+ neurons markedly increased in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice
at E13.5-P28 (Supplementary Fig. 3a, Fig. 4j), further supporting
the idea that Dlx1/2 suppresses Otp expression.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that Dlx1/2 bind their
binding sites located at ~4 kb downstream of the Otp gene and
inhibit the expression of Otp in the developing ARC.
Otp is critical for the formation of AgRP-neurons. The iden-
tification of Otp as a downstream target gene of Dlx1/2 in the
hypothalamus led us to ask if Otp plays any role in the devel-
opment of GHRH- and AgRP-neurons for which Dlx1/2 play
important roles. In the embryonic ARC of Npy-hrGfp mice, Otp
was expressed in most GFP+ neurons (Fig. 5a, b). In contrast,
most GHRH-neurons did not express Otp (Fig. 5c). We also
found that KNDy-neurons, tanycytes, oligodendrocytes, astro-
cytes and TH+ neurons in the ARC do not express Otp (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a, c; Supplementary Fig. 2, a-c). These results
suggest a role for Otp specifically in AgRP-neuronal development.
Indeed, NPY+, AgRP+, and Sst+ neurons were entirely lost in the
ARC of Otp-null mice at E16.5 and E18.5 (Fig. 5d, Supplementary
Fig. 4b). Also Gad1 ISH intensity was significantly reduced in
Otp-null mice at P0 (Supplementary Fig. 4a), consistent with the
loss-of-AgRP-neurons that are mostly GABAergic27. These
results suggest that Otp is required for the generation of AgRP-
neurons. Consistently, the neurons that express GR and Bsx, the
two transcription factors that are important for the expression of
AgRP and NPY in the ARC26,33, were greatly reduced in the Otp-
deficient mice (Fig. 5e). In contrast, POMC+ and GHRH+ (as
determined by ISH signal intensity) and TH+ neurons (as
determined by the number of TH+ neurons) did not show a
significant change in Otp-null ARC (Fig. 5d, e), suggesting that
Otp is dispensable for the development of POMC- and GHRH-
neurons. Consistent with the latter idea, the number of Dlx1+
neurons did not change significantly in Otp-null mice (Fig. 5e).
These results also show that, in the developing ARC, Otp does not
repress the expression of Dlx1/2, while Dlx1/2 inhibits Otp
expression. Interestingly, despite the lack of Otp expression in
KNDy-neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1a), Kiss1 expression was
reduced in Otp-null mice at E18.5 (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Taken together, our data highlight an essential role of Otp in
directing the generation of AgRP-neurons.
Dlx1/2 inhibits AgRP-neuronal fate via suppression of Otp.
The increased Otp expression in Dlx1/2cKO ARC, combined with
the critical role of Otp in AgRP-neuron formation, begs the ques-
tion of whether the de-repressed Otp in the absence of Dlx1/2
drives the gain-of ectopic AgRP-neurons in Dlx1/2cKO mice. If this
is the case, the reduction of Otp levels in Dlx1/2cKO mice will
normalize AgRP-neuronal generation, but it will not restore
GHRH-neuronal formation. To test this idea, we deleted a single
copy of Otp in Dlx1/2cKO mice (Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/−) and monitored
the development of AgRP- and GHRH-neurons. Remarkably, the
aberrant gain-of AgRP-neurons in Dlx1/2cKO mice was corrected
when Otp levels were lowered in Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/− mice, but
GHRH-neurons remained missing in Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/− mice
(Fig. 6). These results establish that Dlx1/2 suppress AgRP-neuronal
fate by inhibiting Otp expression during ARC development.
Discussion
In this paper, we present a novel gene regulatory axis consisting
of the homeodomain transcription factors Dlx1/2 and Otp, which
operates in the developing ARC. We propose that this Dlx1/2-
Otp axis is critical for striking a balance between the embryonic
generation
of
GHRH-
and
AgRP-neurons,
and
that
this
mechanism may contribute to a coordinate control of growth and
energy homeostasis at postnatal stages (Fig. 7).
Given the interdependence between nutritional/energy status
and linear growth5–7, it is possible that the development of energy
homeostasis-controlling
AgRP-/POMC-neurons
and
growth-
promoting GHRH-neurons is synchronized, which may involve
the differentiation of common precursors to related but distinct
neuronal types. Our findings that the Dlx1/2-Otp gene regulatory
axis is essential for the segregation of GHRH- and AgRP-
neuronal fates indicate that the developmental pathways for
GHRH- and AgRP-neurons are interconnected. In this regard, it
is noteworthy that Npy-GFP+ cells can be divided into Otp+ and
Otp− populations. While a majority (~86%) of Npy-GFP+ cells
express Otp in E14.5 ARC, ~14% of Npy-GFP+ cells do not
(Fig. 5a). Interestingly, ~14% of Npy-GFP+ cells express Dlx1 in
E14.5 ARC (Fig. 1d). Combined with the finding that Otp and
Dlx1 expression is mutually exclusive in the embryonic ARC
(Fig. 4i), these data raise the intriguing possibility that Npy-GFP+
population is composed of Otp+/Dlx1− and Otp−/Dlx1+ cells,
which give rise to AgRP- and GHRH-neurons, respectively. On a
related note, in the developing ARC, POMC+ precursors generate
several neuronal types, including POMC-, AgRP-, and fertility-
regulating KNDy/Kiss1-neurons4,34. Future investigation into the
ontogeny of arcuate neurons, such as the relationship among
POMC+ and Npy-GFP+ precursors and their progeny, will reveal
how different types of arcuate neurons are produced in the right
ratio during development to perform highly interconnected
functions at postnatal stages.
Our data suggest that Dlx1/2-mediated repression of the Otp
gene is the key to consolidating the GHRH-neuronal identity and
keeping the number of AgRP-neurons in check. In Dlx1/2-null
ARC, the number of Otp+ AgRP-neurons appeared to be
increased at the expense of Otp− GHRH-neurons (Figs. 2 and 4j;
Supplementary Fig. 3a). Given the total number of neurons did
not change significantly in Dlx1/2-null ARC (Supplementary
Fig. 3b), the presumptive GHRH-neurons might have adopted
AgRP-neuronal fate in the absence of Dlx1/2. It is also possible
that, in addition to GHRH-neurons, some non-GHRH-neuronal
types that normally express Dlx1/2 (Fig. 1b) convert to AgRP-
neurons in Dlx1/2-null ARC. The deletion of a single copy of the

 Otp gene in Dlx1/2-null mice was sufficient to prevent the for-
mation of ectopic AgRP-neurons (Fig. 6). Combined with a
complete loss-of-AgRP-neurons in Otp-null mice (Fig. 5d), these
results suggest that Otp plays an instructive role in AgRP-
neuronal fate specification and that Dlx1/2 inhibit the AgRP-
neuronal fate mainly by repressing Otp, whose erroneous
expression can divert the precursors to AgRP-neuronal fate.
Notably, we and others have shown that Dlx1 and Otp exhibit a
complementary expression pattern in multiple regions of the
hypothalamus (Fig. 4i)16–18, pointing to the possible cross-
repressive interactions between Dlx1 and Otp. Indeed, Otp was
de-repressed in the ARC of Dlx1/2cKO mice (Fig. 4j), but Dlx1
expression did not alter in Otp-null ARC (Fig. 5e), indicating that
Dlx1/2 repress Otp, but not vice versa in the developing ARC. In
contrast, in the PVN, the deletion of Otp resulted in the expan-
sion of Dlx1 expression domain16. Thus, different repressive

 mechanisms may operate to generate the boundary between
Dlx1/2- and Otp-expressing cells in a cell context-dependent
manner.
AgRP-neurons are activated by food deprivation, and the sti-
mulation of AgRP-neuronal circuitry promotes food intake and
suppresses energy expenditure1. The recent single-cell tran-
scriptome analyses in the adult ARC revealed that AgRP-neurons
are divided into the two molecularly distinct subtypes, Sst-
expressing AgRP-neurons (Sst+AgRP+) and Sst-negative AgRP-
neurons (Gm8773+AgRP+)3. However, it remains unclear if Sst
+AgRP+ and Gm8773+AgRP+ subtypes play distinct roles in
controlling energy balance and apetite. In light of the finding of
AgRP-neuronal subtypes, it is noteworthy that an AgRP-neuronal
subtype expressing CRFR1 plays a regulatory role in adapting to
cold stress29. When this CRFR1+ AgRP-neuronal subtype was
hyper-activated by the deletion of CRFR1, the female mutant
mice showed lower body temperature with no change in food
intake under basal conditions and dropped body temperature
significantly more rapidly than control mice when exposed to 5 °
C, but the male mutant mice did not show body temperature
changes29. These data suggest that CRFR1-expressing AgRP-
neuronal subtype is involved in controlling body temperature,
and needs to be inhibited to enable cold-induced thermogenesis.
According to the gene expression profile studies in the adult
ARC3, CRFR1+ AgRP-neurons are the Sst+AgRP+ subtype.
Intriguingly, we found that Dlx1/2cKO mice showed the increased
levels of AgRP- and Sst-neurons in the ARC (Fig. 2). Similarly to
the condition that hyper-activates CRFR1+ AgRP-neuronal sub-
type29, Dlx1/2cKO female mice exhibited significantly lower body
temperature and were more susceptible to the cold stress than
control mice without a change in food intake (Fig. 3e, h; Sup-
plementary Fig. 3d), suggesting that the activity of CRFR1-
expressing Sst+AgRP+ subtype is augmented in Dlx1/2cKO mice.
The increased cold-susceptibility in female Dlx1/2cKO mice may
be responsible, at least partly, for the higher death rate of female
mice (Fig. 3a), particularly given that the standard temperature of
our animal room (22 °C) could provide constant cold stress to
mice35,36. Dlx1/2cKO mice also showed a reduced energy expen-
diture as monitored by oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production (Fig. 3f), as well as a significantly decreased locomotor
activity (Fig. 3g), both of which were likely reflected in a late-
onset obesity (Fig. 3d). Taken together, in Dlx1/2cKO mice, only
an AgRP-neuronal subtype suppressing the energy consumption,
but not the subtype stimulating the feeding behavior, may have
been selectively increased. Alternatively, it is also possible that
both AgRP-neuronal subtypes were aberrantly gained in Dlx1/
2cKO mice, but only a specific subtype (i.e., CFRF1+/Sst+ AgrP-
neurons) was able to form the functional neuronal circuitry. A
better understanding of AgRP-neuronal subtypes at the mole-
cular, connectivity, physiology, and functional levels will help
resolve this issue. Yet another possibility for future investigation
is a possibility of GHRH-neurons interplaying with AgRP-
neurons in food intake control. Although, GHRH-null mice
showed enhanced food intake37, it is possible that the entire loss-
of-GHRH-neurons themselves (which could be the case with our
Dlx1/2cKO mice) may differently alter the feeding behavior, par-
ticularly given the inverse correlation between GH/GHRH levels
and the circulating level of the anorexic hormone leptin5–7.
Our finding that Dlx1/2cKO mice show dwarfism, an absence of
GHRH-neurons, and dysregulated GH signaling (Fig. 3b, c)
establish Dlx1/2 as essential players in the gene network directing
the development of GHRH-neurons. Notably, the deletion of Otp
in Dlx1/2-null mice failed to recover GHRH-neurons although it
rescued the aberrant gain-of AgRP-neurons (Fig. 6), indicating
that the Dlx1/2-Otp axis is not involved in promoting the GHRH-
neuronal fate. Instead, in driving GHRH-neuron development,
Dlx1/2 may act as an upstream activator of Hmx2/3 and
Gsx124,25, given the marked downregulation of Hmx2 and Gsx1
in Dlx1/2-null ARC (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Hmx2/3 are needed
for the expression of Gsx124, which directly binds and triggers the
transcription of the GHRH gene25. Together, these findings
propose the gene regulatory cascade, Dlx1/2-Hmx2/3-Gsx1-
GHRH, which promotes the GHRH-neuronal identity in the
developing ARC. Considering our results that Dlx1/2 can func-
tion as either transcriptional activator or transcriptional repressor
depending on a gene context in the same cell type (Fig. 4f,
Supplementary Fig. 7a), it is interesting to postulate that Dlx1
triggers the Dlx1/2-Hmx2/3-Gsx-GHRH cascade via its tran-
scriptional activator function, while repressing Otp as a tran-
scriptional repressor in segregating the fates for GHRH- and
AgRP-neurons in the precursors (Fig. 7). The future investigation
is needed to understand the molecular basis for the gene context-
specific dual roles of Dlx1/2.
Methods
Animals. All mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under a normal
12 h light, 12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to normal chow and water, unless
otherwise noted. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Oregon Health and Science University. Npy-hrGfp (#006417),
Pomc-eGfp (#009593) and Nkx2.-Cre (#008661) mice were purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory. Otp+/− and Dlx1/2f/f mice were kindly provided by Dr. Dario
Acampora and Dr. Magdalena Petryniak, respectively.
Body temperature measurements. Anesthetized mice were implanted with
Implantable Programmable Temperature and Identification Transponder (IPTT-
300; Bio Medic Data Systems). Body temperature was measured using DAS-7009
reader (Bio Medic Data Systems).
Metabolic studies and food intake. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production were measured using the indirect calorimetry system Oxymax
(Columbus instruments). Data were collected after 72 h of acclimation with singly
housed mice. Whole-body composition of 3–4-month-old mice were analyzed with
EchoMRITM system. Intake of food was analyzed by weighing the amount of food
in each cage at 6 am and 6 pm for two consecutive days. The mice were weighed on
the second day and the food intake was analyzed per mouse and per g of body
weight. For measuring locomotor activity, circadian home cage activity was con-
tinuously measured using a home cage sensor system and mLog software (BioB-
Serve, Germany). Mice were singly housed and given food and water ad libitum in

were averaged into 30 min bins for analysis.
Chick in ovo electroporation. The P29 ChIPseq peak region and Dlx1 were
subcloned into CMV-GFP reporter and RCAS expression vectors, respectively.
Chicken eggs were incubated in a humidified chamber for 48–52 h. DNA con-
structs were injected into the lumen of chick embryonic spinal cord at HH stage
11–13. Electroporation was performed using a square wave electroporator (BTX).
Incubated chicks were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 3 days after
electroporation.
ChIP. E16/E16.5 WT mouse hypothalami were dissected out and homogenized
before being cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature,
followed by quenching with 125 mM glycine. The cells were washed in PBS, and
lysed in cell lysis buffer (5 mM PIPES, pH 8, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40) and nuclear
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitor),
followed by sonication. Cell lysates were redissolved in dilution buffer (0.5% Triton
X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated with IgG and protein A
agarose beads for 1 h for immunoclearing. The supernatant, collected after quick
spin-down, was immunoprecipitated by our home-made anti-Dlx1 antibody or
control IgG (Santa Cruz) overnight, followed by incubation with protein A agarose
for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were sequentially washed with RIPA (0.1% SDS, 1%
NP40, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate),
high salt buffer (same as RIPA except 500 mM NaCl) and LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl,
1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 10 min
at each step. The beads were subsequently washed with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-
HCl, 1 mM EDTA) three times. The protein/chromatin complexes were eluted in
elution buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaHCO3, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
and reverse cross-linked by incubating at 65 °C overnight, followed by incubation
at 50 °C for <2 h with proteinase K. The DNA was extracted with phenol/
chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation and solubilization in water.
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Anesthetized mice were per-
fused transcardially with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were
removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS, and
incubated with 30% sucrose. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
incubated in 30% sucrose. Brain sections (12 μm thick) were prepared with a
cryostat and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and followed by
1–2 h incubation with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Jack-
son Immuno Research). To cover the representative ARC areas, we used at least
three sections that are located ~144–168 μm from each other. For ISH, antisense
RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C overnight.
Hybridized sections were washed in 4× SSC and 0.2× SSC solution, and incubated
with anti-digoxigenin-AP antibody (11093274910, Roche Diagnostics; 1:4000)
overnight. The sections were subjected to color reaction with NBP/BCIP. The
VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (PK-6101, Vector Labs) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instruction for immunohistochemistry assay following ISH. The

Fig. 6 Dlx1/2 inhibits AgRP-neuronal fate via suppression of Otp. In ISH analyses, the expression of NPY and Sst in E15.5 Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/− embryos (n =
5) was significantly lower than that observed with their littermate Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/+ embryos (n = 3) and rather comparable to that observed with Dlx1/2 f/
f;Otp+/+ (n = 3) and Dlx1/2 f/f;Otp+/− (n = 11) embryos. In contrast, the expression of GHRH was comparable between Dlx1/2cKO;Otp+/+ and Dlx1/2cKO;
Otp+/− embryos. Quantification was performed with multiple embryos as indicated and at least three sections from each embryo, and representative
images for only one side of the ARC are as shown. Scale bars, 100 μm. Student’s t-test results are as indicated: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and

 probes for αMSH, AgRP, NPY, Sst, GHRH, Gad1, and Dlx1 were described pre-
viously38. The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry are anti-GR (SC-1004,
Santa Cruz; 1:500), anti-Isl1 (home-made; 1:3000), our home-made anti-Dlx1
(antibody), our home-made anti-OTP (using the 183–325 aa region of mouse Otp
as the antigen), anti-Bsx33 (1:2000), rabbit anti-NeuN (Ab177487, Abcam; 1:2000),
rabbit anti-TH (AB152, Millipore; 1:500), and anti-GFP (GFP-1020, aves labs;
1:2000) antibodies.
Image analysis and quantification. A length of 12 μm brain sections covering the
entire arcuate nucleus were placed onto a series of slides with 4–5 sections on each
slide. The distance between sections in single slide is 144–168 μm. One slide from
each mouse that contains matched sections was used to compare controls and
mutants. Zeiss Axio imager 2 with apotome was used to image in situ hybridization
and immunohistochemistry result. Integrated density measurement in Image J
software was used to analyze densitometry. For cell counting, analyze particles
measurement in image J was used to count specifically immuno-stained cells in the
arcuate nucleus.
Co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase assay. Dlx1 and Dlx2 WT or Dlx2-QE
mutant were subcloned into pcDNA3 plasmid with N-terminal triple Flag tag.
ChIPseq peak P27 and P29 regions were cloned into TK-luciferase vector and used
for luciferase assays. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For co-immunoprecipitation
assay, cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes and transiently transfected with either
Dlx1 or Dlx2 expression vector using the standard calcium phosphate method.
Anti-Flag M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma) was used for immunoprecipitation (1 μg)
and immunoblotting (1:3000), and a full size image with size markers is presented
in supplementary Fig. 5. For luciferase assays, cells were seeded into 48-well plates
and transiently transfected with luciferase reporter and Dlx1/2-expression vectors
using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The actin-β-
galactosidase plasmid was co-transfected for normalization of the luciferase results.
Data are shown in relative luciferase units (mean ± s.d.).
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Total RNAs were extracted
from a piece of mouse liver using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using
Thermo Scientific Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase. The following primers
were used with SYBR Green kit (Thermo Scientific Luminaris Color Higreen,
#K0371) for quantitative RT-PCR of IGF1: 5′-TCATGTCGTCTTCACACCTCT-3′
and 5′-TCCACAATGCCTGTCTGAGG-3′.
Statistical analyses. Statistical differences were determined by Student’s t-test.
Statistical significance is displayed as follows: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. The p-values for the CO2/VO2 measurements, as well as the
body temperature measurement in the cold room were also analyzed using two-
way ANOVA test. The home cage activity and food intake during the light and
dark periods were analyzed separately using repeated-measures ANOVA with
genotype as the between-subjects factor.

Fig. 7 Our working models. a A balanced production of AgRP- and GHRH-
neurons is directed at least in part by the Dlx1/2-Otp gene regulatory axis,
by which Dlx1/2 suppress Otp expression in developing GHRH-neurons. It
remains to be determined if a similar gene regulatory axis that functions to
block developing AgRP-neurons from adopting a GHRH-neuronal fate also
exists. Also unclear is how Dlx1/2 and Otp control GHRH- and AgRP-
neuronal genes, respectively. b Schematic representation of dysregulated
production of AgRP- and GHRH-neurons in Dlx1/2cKO and Otp−/− mice
