Abstract
Background: The economic burden of physical inactivity in Canada is estimated at Can $6.8 billion (US $5 billion) per year.
Employers bear a substantial proportion of the economic costs, as they pay more for inactive workers in health care and other
organizational costs. In response, many Canadian employers offer wellness programs, though these are often underutilized. While
financial health incentives have been proposed as one way of increasing participation, their longer term effects (ie postintervention
effects) are not clear.
Objective: The objective of this paper is to outline the methodology for a randomized control trial (RCT) examining the longer
term impact of an existing physical activity promotion program that is enhanced by adding guaranteed rewards (Can $1 [US
$0.74] per day step goal met) in a lower active hospital employee population (less than 10,000 steps per day).
Methods: A 12-week, parallel-arm RCT (with a 12-week postintervention follow-up) will be employed. Employees using
Change4Life (a fully automated, incentive-based wellness program) and accumulating fewer than 10,000 steps per day at baseline
(weeks 1 to 2) will be randomly allocated (1:1) to standard care (wellness program, accelerometer) or an intervention group
(standard care plus guaranteed incentives). All study participants will be asked to wear the accelerometer and synchronize it to
Change4Life daily, although only intervention group participants will receive guaranteed incentives for reaching tailored daily
step count goals (Can $1 [US $0.74] per day; weeks 3 to 12). The primary study outcome will be mean proportion of participant-days
step goal reached during the postintervention follow-up period (week 24). Mean proportion of participant-days step goal reached
during the intervention period (week 12) will be a secondary outcome.
Results: Enrollment for the study will be completed in February 2017. Data analysis will commence in September 2017. Study
results are to be published in the winter of 2018.
Conclusions: This protocol was designed to examine the impact of guaranteed rewards on physical activity maintenance in
lower active hospital employees.

Introduction
There is a substantial economic burden associated with physical
inactivity in Canada [1,2]. According to Janssen [1], the cost
of inactivity is Can $6.8 billion (US $5.0 billion) per year,
posing a significant threat to the sustainability of the Canadian
health care system. On the other hand, the projected cost savings
of increasing the proportion of Canadians who meet physical
activity guidelines (ie, 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous
physical activity [MVPA] per week, or roughly 10,000 steps
per day) by just 1% is Can $2.1 billion (US $1.6 billion) per
year [3]. Notably, significant reductions in health risk and
associated costs and improvements in quality of life are seen
when inactive (<5000 steps per day) and low active (5000 to
7499 steps per day) adults become a little more active (eg, 1000
more steps per day) [3,4]. The workplace is an ideal setting for
physical activity promotion since Canadian jobs are increasingly
desk-based and sedentary [5].
Not surprisingly, Canadian employers bear a significant
proportion of the inactivity burden because they pay more for
lower active (<10,000 steps per day) workers in health care
expenses [6]. For instance, while Canadian provincial and
territorial governments cover hospital- and physician-related
medical costs, employers in Canada often subsidize other
medical expenses, one of the costliest being chronic
disease–related medications [6]. A study by Wang and
colleagues [7] helps to illustrate the economic benefit of a more
physically active employee population. This study found that
moderately active (1 to 2 times per week) and very active (3 or
more times per week) employees had Can $250 (US $185) less
paid health care costs annually when compared to their sedentary
counterparts (0 times per week). In addition, wellness initiatives
that increase employees’ physical activity have been shown to
reduce absenteeism, presenteeism, and turnover [8-11]. Finally,
according to health care surveys by Towers Watson [12] and
Sanofi [6], Canadian employers have a vested interest in
employees’ physical activity levels given the positive effects
on organizational costs (eg, health care expenses) and
performance (eg, presenteeism).
As a result, the majority (72%) of large Canadian companies
now offer wellness programs to help reduce overall health care
spending and increase productivity [6]. For participating
employees, such programs have been associated with a reduced
risk of chronic illness and lower medical claim costs [13,14].
However, these programs are chronically underutilized. In
Canada, wellness program participation rates are extremely low,
less than 10% [6]. This means that more than 90% of eligible
Canadian workers are not reaping the benefits of
company-sponsored 
wellness 
programming. 
Behavioral
economics, a new branch of economics that is complemented
by insights from psychology, has stimulated renewed interest
in financial health incentives as a means to increase wellness
program participation [5,15-17].
Behavioral economics recognizes that human decisions are
biased in systematic ways and that that these “decision biases”
can be leveraged to facilitate healthy decision making [18]. For
example, according to behavioral economics, increasing the
immediately rewarding aspects of a healthy behavior (eg, with
a financial incentive) may offset the so-called “present bias”
where people tend to overweigh the immediate costs (and
discount the future benefits) of those behaviors (eg, time out of
a busy schedule to exercise) [19]. Systematic reviews by
Mitchell et al [20] and Strohacker et al [21] support the theory
suggesting that incentives generally stimulate physical activity
in the short-term (less than 3 months) and while incentives are
in place. These reviews also suggest that not enough studies
have examined the longer term (ie, postintervention) impact of
incentives on physical activity to draw conclusions about
sustained effects [20,21]—an issue of particular interest to
Canadian employers looking to deliver cost-effective
incentive-based wellness programs [5,6].
Of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have recently
examined this issue [22-26], 4 have observed a regression to
baseline behaviors after incentive removal [22-24,26] and only
1 has demonstrated persisting physical activity [25]. One reason
for this may have to do with the limited application of health
behavior change theories in the design of incentive programs
[19]. It is increasingly suggested that for incentives to both
stimulate and sustain health behavior change they should be
grounded in theory [19,27,28]. In the single “positive” study,
behavioral maintenance (ie, 16-week follow-up) was driven
entirely by the lower active subgroup (ie, university students
visiting 
the 
gym 
fewer 
than 
once 
per 
week 
at
baseline)—possibly because exposure to the new behavior (ie,
gym attendance) led to increased confidence to perform that
behavior 
[25]. 
This 
presumption 
aligns 
well 
with
self-determination theory, a global theory of motivation focused
on the extent to which behaviors are done volitionally, which
suggests that incentive programs designed to increase a person’s
confidence are more likely to foster self-determined (or intrinsic)
motivation [29,30]—a key driver of sustained physical activity
[30].
Realizing the potential of incentives to promote sustained
physical activity, therefore, will be contingent on research that
improves the understanding of theoretical (eg, self-determined
motivation) and contextual (eg, target group characteristics)
factors that may influence incentive program effectiveness. The
purpose of this protocol is to outline the design of an RCT that
will examine the longer term effects of an existing physical
activity promotion program that is enhanced by guaranteed
incentives for lower active employees only in a real-world,
ecological setting. We hypothesize that targeting lower active
employees with incentives for tailored daily step goals (in
addition to the generic, one-size-fits-all approach to goal setting
that is typically used) may be more likely to create mastery

 experiences, increase confidence, and promote physical activity

Methods
Study Design
A 12-week, parallel-arm RCT with a 12-week postintervention
follow-up will be employed to examine the impact of an
enhanced (Can $1 [US $0.74] per day) incentive program on
objectively measured physical activity among lower active
employees (<10,000 steps per day) within a large Canadian
hospital network. See the study flow chart in Figure 1, including
an overview of the enrollment process and assessments.
Figure 1. Study flowchart.
Study Population and Recruitment
This study will specifically target lower active employees
(<10,000 steps per day). Hospital employees (including health
care professionals and administrative and business support
personnel) enrolled in the Change4Life program will be invited
to participate via website notifications and hospital newsletters.
Only data from participants who accumulate less than 10,000
steps per day during the “2-Week Run-In” period will be
included in the analysis. Further eligibility criteria will include:
18 years of age or older, English speaking, ready Internet access,
and without medical conditions exacerbated by physical activity
as assessed by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
Plus. Eligible participants will be asked to provide their
expressed consent using the online consent form.
Change4Life
Change4Life, a Web- and incentive-based health education and
behavior change program, was launched in May 2015 at the
hospital network. The hospital network is offering Change4Life
to 6500 full-time employees across 8 worksites. Specifically,
the Web-based wellness program offers educational information

 relating to chronic disease prevention via learning modules (ie,
series of short articles and quizzes). All employees who sign
up for Change4Life are rewarded with points for completing
these modules as well as for setting health-related goals,
self-reporting health behaviors/outcomes, identifying barriers,
and creating action plans—self-regulatory behaviors that have
been theorized and empirically proven to promote sustained
health behavior change (see the Change4Life Steps Study
calendar in Figure 2) [29,30]. Using points, employees may
“purchase” ballots in the Change4Life reward store and enter
into drawings for health-promoting products (eg, groceries,
exercise equipment). At the hospital network, Change4Life
operates as a minimal chance-based incentive program (low
frequency, low magnitude rewards), where participants have
less than a 1 in 100 chance of winning reward drawings that
generally range in value from Can $5 to $20 (US $3.70-$14.80).
Figure 2. Change4Life Steps Study calendar (ie, tracking page).
Standard Care Group
Standard care group participants will have access to
Change4Life and will receive the standard minimal chance-based
incentives (ie, less than 1 in 100 chance of earning Can $5 to
$20 [US $3.70-$14.80] vouchers) for completing learning
modules and health tasks. In addition, standard care participants
will be asked to wear the accelerometer, which tracks steps and
10-minute bouts of MVPA per day, synchronize the device to
the Change4Life program daily, and reach tailored daily step
count goals for 10 weeks (weeks 3 to 12). Standard care
participants will be instructed to increase their daily step counts
by 1000 steps above their baseline average every 2 weeks until
they reach the target goal of 3000 extra steps at week 7 (see
Table 1). Change4Life will automatically calculate the average
baseline value in the early hours of day 1, week 3 using data
uploaded the previous 2 weeks (the Run-In period)—days with
step counts less than 100 or greater than 50,000 will not be
included in calculations [31]. This tailored and graded approach
to setting step goals is more realistic than the traditional 10,000
step target (ie, the average Canadian adults accumulates only
about 5000 steps per day) [32], may increase chances of
intervention success (versus offering a lofty 10,000 step per day
goal for everyone), and has worked well in employee
populations in the past [33].

Intervention Group
The only difference between the standard care and intervention
groups will be the addition of the guaranteed incentive (Can $1
[US $0.74] per day). During the intervention period (weeks 3
to 12), intervention group participants will be eligible to earn
Can $1 (US $0.74) in vouchers (eg, groceries, coffee, or movies)
each time tailored daily step goals are achieved. The total
amount available over the intervention period will be Can $70
(US $51.82). Previous research suggests that as little as Can
$6.75 (US $5) per week may be sufficient to produce favorable
lifestyle health behavior changes [34], thus Can $7 (US $5.18)
per week (Can $1 [US $0.74] per day) was chosen as the size
of the incentive. During the study follow-up period (weeks 13
to 24), intervention participants will no longer receive the per
day reward for reaching daily step goals.
Outcome Measures
The primary study outcome will be the mean proportion of
participant-days that step goals are achieved during week 24
(the postintervention follow-up assessment period, T3). Mean
proportion of participant-days that step goals are achieved during
week 12 (intervention end point, T2) and volume of steps and
10-minute bouts of MVPA per week at T2 and T3 will be
secondary outcomes. Physical activity will be objectively
assessed using the StepsCount Piezo Rx accelerometer
(StepsCount Inc, Deep River, ON, Canada). The Piezo Rx is a
medical-grade device with a single axis piezoelectric sensor.
This device has been found to be valid in calculating step counts
and MVPA among adult participants [35,36]. Standard care and
intervention participants will be encouraged to wear their
accelerometer and synchronize it to the Change4Life program
during the baseline 2-Week Run-In period (T1), as well as at
the intervention end point (T2), and follow-up assessment (T3)
with Can $10 (US $7.40) study retention vouchers; these
vouchers for assessment completion will help minimize dropout
and will not be contingent on step goal achievement.
The adherence outcome variables will be mean number of
missing step count entries per week as well as mean number of
Change4Life website log-ins in general. Participants’
self-determined motivation to exercise will be examined using
the Behavioral Regulation to Exercise Questionnaire-3
(BREQ-3) [37,38]. Participants’ walking self-efficacy will be
assessed using a modified version of the Self-Efficacy for
Exercise Scale (SEE Scale) [39]. The BREQ-3 and the SEE
Scale will be administered online at baseline (T1), intervention
end point (T2), and during the follow-up assessment period
(T3). The differential impact of the Can $1 (US $0.74) per day
incentive on the various physical activity outcomes will be
explored. For instance, we may find that while the guaranteed
incentives stimulate step goal achievement at T2, they also
undermine self-determined motivation and thus the prospect
that people will continue to exercise after the incentive is
removed.
Sample Size
Sample size calculations indicate that a final sample of 158
participants (79 per group) ensures 80% power (P<.05; 2-tailed)
to detect a 0.20 difference in the mean proportion of
participant-days step goals are reached between intervention
and standard care groups for week 24 [24]. This calculation
assumes that the mean proportion of participant-days step goal
achieved in the intervention group in week 24 will be 0.40 (vs
0.20 in the standard care group) [24]. On the basis of data
published by Patel et al [22] this difference translates into a
relative effect size of 0.40. The participant enrollment target
will be increased to 174 to account for a potential 10% dropout
rate, a rate that has been reported by other similar studies
[22,26].
Randomization and Blinding
Employees accumulating fewer than 10,000 steps per day during
the baseline period (study weeks 1 and 2) will be randomized
using a single, constant allocation ratio (1:1) to standard care
or intervention groups. Randomization will occur using an online
random number generator [40]. Participants will not be blinded
to study group allocation. The research analysts will be blinded
to group allocation until after the study is completed.
Statistical Analyses
For each participant on each day of the study (participant-day
level) continuous step count data will be obtained and screened
for outliers (less than 100 steps per day, more than 50,000 steps
per day) [31]. If participants did not synchronize their
accelerometer for at least 3 separate workdays at T2 and T3,
the last observation will be carried forward using T1 or T2
means [33]. This procedure conservatively assumes no change
in variables and allows analysis by intention-to-treat. The step
count data will then be dichotomized at the participant-day level
to create a binary variable where participants achieved (value
= 1) or did not achieve (value = 0) their step goal. Using this
binary variable, the mean proportion of participant-days where
step goals were achieved at week 24 will be compared.
SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp) will be used to fit a generalized
linear model with participant random effects, a random intercept,
time-fixed effects (T1-T3), and treatment-fixed effects (by study
group). A binomial distribution with logit link for models using
the binary outcome will be used to estimate the adjusted

 difference in the proportion of participant-days step goal
achieved, and the bootstrap procedure and resampling of
participants will be used to obtain 95% confidence intervals and
P values. Comparisons across study groups will be adjusted for
mean steps per day (baseline), age, gender, and income since
these have moderated incentive-effects in the past [41]. The
same procedures will be used to analyze T2 (ie, intervention
end) binary data.
For continuous step count (ie, mean steps per day) and bout
minutes (ie, total minutes of MVPA in 10-minute bouts per
week) data at T2 and T3, a generalized linear model will be
used, as above, except the difference in steps per day and MVPA
bout minutes between groups will be obtained using
least-squares means. Also, a repeated measures analysis of
variance using linear mixed models with first order
autoregressive covariance structures will be used to compare
changes in self-determined motivation and self-efficacy between
groups. Adherence will be analyzed using t tests comparing the
mean number of missing step count entries per week and mean
number of website log-ins per month between groups. This
protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT02638675].
Results
Enrollment for the study will be completed in February 2017.
Data analysis will commence in September 2017. Study results
are to be published in the winter of 2018.
Discussion
Overview
Physical activity maintenance is critical for controlling the
human and economic burden of chronic disease [1,2]. While
incentives have stimulated physical activity behaviors in the
past [20-26], only 1 RCT to our knowledge has produced longer
term, postintervention improvements [25]. The primary aim of
this protocol is to outline the design of an RCT to test whether
adding theoretically informed guaranteed incentives to an
existing physical activity promotion program can drive physical
activity for 12 weeks after guaranteed incentives are removed
in a workplace context. Since one of the risks with incentives
is that they damage self-determined motivation and thus people’s
potential for sustained change [42], the theoretical considerations
in this study extend beyond behavioral economics (which merely
describes how incentives may be used as a catalyst for change)
[19] to include insights from self-determination theory (which
describes the conditions under which incentives may produce
sustained change) [29]. The literature examining the
undermining effect of incentives has mostly considered simple
tasks for which initial intrinsic motivation is high, although
these findings should not be generalized to lifestyle health
behaviors like physical activity where initial intrinsic motivation
can be low [43]. In addition, incentive schemes vary greatly in
their design and can differentially moderate the undermining
effect [43]. While more research is needed, schemes that target
less active adults for realistic behavioral outcomes are theorized
to support the internalization process and promote quality
behavior change [29,30].
According to self-determination theory, incentives may help to
build self-determined motivation primarily through their action
on self-efficacy, especially for lower active people who exhibit
fewer intrinsic motives to begin with (less motivation to crowd
out) [44,45]. Regarding physical activity, one hypothesis is that
incentives may increase a person’s self-efficacy to become more
active by exposing them to a form of physical activity for the
first time [29,30,44,45]. Especially if the activity is an
achievable one (eg, walk 1000 more steps per day vs walk
10,000 steps per day), individuals may find their confidence to
be more active increases after just a few weeks [29,30,44,45].
To align with self-determination theory, then, we decided to (1)
target lower active employees only (because they have less/little
self-determined motivation to crowd out) [23,24,29] and (2)
offer incentives contingent on tailored/realistic step goal
achievements (to maximize mastery experiences and increase
self-efficacy) [45]. The main theoretical contribution of this
protocol therefore is in its application of self-determination
theory to the design of the incentive intervention (ie, realistic
behavioral targets) and program evaluation (ie, tracking
motivation throughout).
The practical implications of this research are also important
given the growing popularity of incentive-based wellness
programs [42]. First of all, we hope the results of this RCT
encourage others to incorporate a simple but important incentive
program design nuance by offering rewards contingent on
tailored, rather than generic, physical activity goals. The
pervasiveness of wearable physical activity monitors in general
(eg, smartphones with built-in accelerometers) may make it
easier for interventionists or employers to individualize physical
activity goals in the context of a health rewards system (by
setting goals based on an individual’s own physical activity
pattern). Another practical implication of this study may be in
encouraging employers to consider guaranteed rewards systems
for higher-risk, higher-cost employees only versus the traditional
(and largely ineffective) approach of offering low-frequency,
low-magnitude chance-based rewards to everyone. To manage
budgets, employers often opt for the seemingly more affordable
chance-based reward scheme even though there is limited
evidence of its effectiveness [20]. Finally, if incentives are not
amenable to employees, the intervention will almost certainly
fail [46]. Employers deploying incentives should therefore
consider any unintended consequences of this novel approach,
including (1) perceived unfairness (eg, Why should only lower
active employees be rewarded to exercise?), (2) opportunity
cost concerns (eg, Should we really be spending money on
this?), (3) gaming/cheating (eg, I will cheat by getting my friend
to track my activity for me), and (4) low overall acceptability
(eg, I don’t want my employer telling me what to do) [47-49].
One way of circumventing the perceived unfairness issue may
be in offering minimal chance-based rewards to all employees
regardless of physical activity level as well as an enhanced
incentive program to employees qualifying as lower active or
higher-risk. Supporting such an approach with empirical data
may alleviate concerns around unfairness, opportunity cost, and
acceptability as well [47-49].

 Limitations
This study protocol is not without limitations. First, given that
only employees already enrolled in Change4Life (less than 10%
of the eligible employee population) will be assessed for
eligibility and invited to participate in the study, the results may
not be generalizable. By recruiting only lower active
Change4Life enrollees, we will learn more about how a higher
risk employee population responds to incentives. Since the
hallmark of Web-based health interventions is low engagement
[49], there is potential for significant study dropout as well
(ceasing daily device synchronization and not participating in
assessments), especially among standard care participants. Both
intervention and standard care participants will be encouraged
to participate in all scheduled assessments (baseline, intervention
end point, follow-up) with Can $10 (US $7.40) vouchers. Given
the low participant burden and potential for lower active
individuals to experience improved health, however, this
voluntary incentive-based wellness program may be met with
relatively high levels of engagement. Finally, participants will
not be blinded to study group allocation, which could
contaminate the results. Knowledge of group allocation will be
assessed using a study exit survey to monitor this potential
confounder.
Conclusion
The objective of this study is to improve the longer term
maintenance of physical activity through a better understanding
of how to structure and evaluate incentive programs. Incentives
are not a panacea, of course, and may not work for all people,
but as part of broader package of interventions and under certain
conditions incentives may have a role to play in driving
sustained health behavior change.
