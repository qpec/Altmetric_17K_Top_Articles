dependent long-term potentiation [t-LTP]) during synapse formation, then switch to a Hebbian form of STDP. Here we show that
TCA-cortical plate synapses exhibit robust t-LTP in neonates, whose magnitude decreased gradually after P4-P5. After L2/3 is differen-
tiated, TCA-L2/3 gradually switched to STDP with only depression (t-LTD) after P7-P8, whereas TCA-L4 lost STDP. t-LTP was dependent
on NMDA receptor and PKA, whereas t-LTD was mediated by Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) probably located at TCA terminals,
revealed by global and cortical excitatory cell-specific knock-out of CB1R. Moreover, we found that administration of CB1R agonists,
including �9-tetrahydrocannabinol, caused substantial retraction of TCAs. Consistent with this, individual thalamocortical axons exu-
berantly innervated L2/3 at P12 in CB1R knock-outs, indicating that endogenous cannabinoid signaling shapes TCA projection. These
results suggest that the developmental switch in STDP and associated appearance of CB1R play important roles in the formation and
refinement of TCAs.

Introduction
Despite evidence that coordinated patterns of neuronal activity
influence the organization of circuits throughout the brain, how
activity is translated into structural changes remains unclear
(Katz and Shatz, 1996; Catalano and Shatz, 1998). Long-term
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) have been

Significance Statement
It has been shown that neural activity is required for initial synapse formation of thalamocortical axons with cortical cells,
but precisely what sort of activities in presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are required is not yet clear. In addition, how
activity is further translated into structural changes is unclear. We show here that the period during which spike timing-
dependent long-term potentiation and depression (t-LTP, t-LTD) can be induced closely matches the time course of synapse
formation and retraction, respectively, at the thalamocortical synapse. Moreover, administration of cannabinoid agonists,
which mimic t-LTD, caused TCA retraction, suggesting that cannabinoids translate physiological changes into morpholog-
ical consequences.

 explored as candidate mechanisms (Kimura et al., 1989; Katz and
Shatz, 1996; Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Malenka and Bear,
2004); however, causal links between LTP/LTD and anatomical
rearrangements remain tentative. We have previously shown
that, during synapse formation, L4-L2/3 synapses exhibit spike
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with only LTP (timing-
dependent long-term potentiation [t-LTP]) for 1 week; this is
switched to standard Hebbian STDP with LTP and LTD at P13-
P15 (Itami and Kimura, 2012). During synapse formation, the
spiking order between presynaptic and postsynaptic cells is un-
stable or even random, due to weakness or absence of synaptic
connections. t-LTP rule would be suitable for strengthening weak
synaptic connections under such unregulated presynaptic and
postsynaptic activity because only close temporal correlation, re-
gardless of spiking order, is required for strengthening synapses
under t-LTP. One week before L4-L2/3 synapse formation,
thalamocortical axons (TCAs) start to form synapses with the
cortical plate (CP), which later differentiates into L4 and L2/3.
TCA projections to future L2/3 appeared to be largely transient
(Senft and Woolsey, 1991; Rebsam et al., 2002), and the innerva-
tions are eventually confined to L4, the main target layer of TCAs.
In the present study, we first asked whether TCA-CP synapses
exhibit t-LTP during synapse formation. If so, how about TCAs
to L2/3 while possible retraction is going on, and TCAs to L4? The
results indicated that TCA synapsing to CP cells showed t-LTP,
and TCA to differentiated L2/3 cells changed into t-LTD, whereas
TCA to differentiated L4 lost STDP. We also identified that
t-LTD was mediated by cannabinoid receptors (CB1R). We then
attempted to mimic these morphological changes by exogenous
administration of agonists or antagonist of CB1R, which pro-
duced physiological effects. Finally, we found that endogenous
CB1R signaling also played an important role in shaping the TCA
axons during development by examining TCAs in CB1R�/�. Our
results indicate that CB1R may provide a causal link between
synaptic and morphological consequences.
Materials and Methods
Experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the animal
welfare committees of the Saitama Medical University, Baylor College of
Medicine, Hokkaido University, and Osaka University Graduate School
of Medicine.
Animals. Global CB1R-KO (CB1R�/�) mice and CB1R-floxed
(CB1Rfl/fl) mice on a C57BL/6 background were generated as described
previously (Marsicano et al., 2002, 2003). NEX-Cre mice were generated
by inserting the Cre gene into the NEX locus (Goebbels et al., 2006).
NEX-Cre/� mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 background for five
generations. CB1R�/� males were mated with CB1R�/� females to gen-
erate CB1R�/�, CB1R�/�, and CB1R�/� mice. NEX-Cre/�; CB1Rfl/fl
males were mated with CB1Rfl/fl females to produce NEX-Cre/�;
CB1Rfl/fl (Cx-CB1R-KO) and �/�; CB1Rfl/fl; (control) mice.
To generate a TCA-green fluorescent protein (TCA-GFP) reporter
line, we generated a double-transgenic retinoid-related orphan receptor
(ROR)�Cre-TaumGFP line (designated TCAmGFP) by crossing ROR�Cre
mice with TaumGFP mice. ROR�Cre mice were generated by inserting an
IRES-cre expression cassette into the 3� noncoding region of the ROR�
gene. TaumGFP is a Cre-reporter line containing a floxed “stop transcrip-
tion” sequence in front of membrane anchored GFP (mGFP) and an
IRES-NLS-lacZ gene in the Tau locus (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005). This
reporter line allows the detection of neurons with Cre-mediated recom-
bination events by the presence of nuclear �-galactosidase (�-gal) and
membrane-anchored GFP. Mouse colonies were maintained in a
pathogen-free environment with a 14/10 h light/dark cycle (lights on at
06:00) with access to food and water ad libitum. All experiments and data
analyses were performed by experimenters who were blinded to the ge-
notype information. Animals were treated in compliance with guidelines
set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
Genotyping. Tail lysates were prepared by immersing the tail pieces in
tail digestion buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, Triton X-100, 0.1
mg/ml proteinase K, pH 9.0) and vortexing gently for 3 h at 60°C to lyse
the tail. Tail lysates were heated to 94°C for 10 min to denature by the
proteinase K, and then centrifuged at 16,000 �g for 15 min. The super-
natants were used as DNA templates for PCRs. For the CB1R allele, PCRs
were conducted with a mixture of primers CB50: 5�-GCTGTCTCTGGT
CCTCTTAAA-3� and CB51: 5�-GGT GTCACCTCTGAAAACAGA-3� to
detect the CB1R-WT allele (400 bp); or CB50 and CB54: 5�-CCTACC
CGGTAGAATTAGCTT-3� to detect the CB1R-KO allele (300 bp).
For the CB1R-floxed allele, PCRs were conducted with a mixture of
primers CB50 and CB51 to detect the CB1R-WT allele (400 bp) and
flox-inserted allele (500 bp). For Nex-Cre, PCRs were conducted using
primers that have been described previously (Ballester-Rosado et al.,
2010).
Slice preparation. Mice were deeply anesthetized with Ethrane (Abbott
Laboratories) and decapitated. The brain was rapidly transferred to ice-
cold slicing ACSF consisting of the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl,
1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 26 NaHCO3, bubbled
with 95% O2-5% CO2, and balanced at pH 7.4 (295–305 mOsm).
Thalamocortical slices (350–400 �m) were prepared from P1-P19 from
C57BL/6J mice and mutants using a rotor slicer or vibratome, as de-
scribed previously (Agmon and Connors, 1991; Itami et al., 2001). Then,
slices were immediately transferred to a holding chamber where they
remained submerged in oxygenated ACSF for at least 1 h until being
transferred to a recording chamber that was placed on the stage of an
upright microscope.
Electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch pipettes (5–7 M�) were used to
record the membrane voltage from visually identified cells in cortical
plate, L4, and L2/3 in response to ventrobasal nucleus of thalamus (VB)
or L4 stimulation under differential interference optics with upright
stage-fixed microscopes (BX51WI, Olympus, or Axioskop 2 FS plus,
Zeiss), as described previously (Kimura et al., 2010; Itami and Kimura,
2012). The temperature was maintained at 27°C–30°C. Micropipettes
were pulled from borosilicate, thick-walled glass capillary tubing (Sutter
Instruments). The pipette solution contained the following: 130 mM
K-methane sulfonate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM K-EGTA, 5 mM
Mg-adenosine triphosphate, 1 mM Na-guanosine-5�-triphosphate, 10
mM Na-phosphocreatinine, pH 7.3 (295 mOsm). Responses were re-
corded using a MultiClamp 700B or an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molec-
ular Devices) in current-clamp mode. Signals were low-pass filtered at
3–5 kHz, digitally sampled at 10–20 kHz, and monitored with the
pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices). Upon inserting the electrode in
the bath, the stray pipette capacitance was compensated, as was the
bridge balance, through a built-in circuit of the amplifier. The bridge
balance was checked repeatedly and readjusted when necessary. A con-
centric bipolar stimulating electrode (Frederick Haer) was placed in L4
or in the VB area of the thalamus, through which electrical stimuli con-
sisting of square pulses for 100 �s, up to 0.5 mA, were applied every 7500
ms (0.133 Hz), unless otherwise specified. Upon establishing whole-cell
recording of synaptic responses in response to afferent stimulation,
monosynaptic nature was examined by short (typically �4 ms from VB,
depending on age) (for details, see Kimura et al., 2010) constant latency,

 following 1 Hz afferent stimulations without failure or latency jittering.
To avoid responses resulting from antidromic activation of corticotha-
lamic axons, only EPSPs with paired pulse depression that displayed no
supernormality were adopted (Beierlein and Connors, 2002; Kimura et
al., 2010).
Induction protocol for STDP. Single postsynaptic action potentials
(APs) were evoked by somatic current injection using the smallest cur-
rent possible (typically �1.5 nA for 5–10 ms). The stimulus intensity to
presynaptic cells, either in L4 or in the thalamus, was also adjusted to
evoke EPSPs with a single component, without notches in the rising or
decaying phases. The pairing interval was defined from the onset of
EPSPs to the peak of each AP. A total of 90 pairings was applied to
presynaptic and postsynaptic cells with fixed delays, except in random
stimulation experiments (see Fig. 6). Stimulation patterns were con-
structed using a custom program written by LabVIEW (National Instru-
ments) running on a Windows computer and delivered through an
interface (USBX-I16P, Technowave) by the stimulator. In Gaussian
random-delay timing stimulation, the computer generated 90 random
numbers with a Gaussian distribution, with a mean of 0 and 99.7% (3
SD) of the numbers occurring within �50. These numbers were then
taken as the value of AP-EPSP delay in milliseconds.
Drugs and drug injection. WIN 55, 212–2 (WIN) mesylate, AM251, and
AM281 were obtained from Tocris Bioscience. Ifenprodil was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. WIN (1 or 0.1 mg/kg) was suspended in vehicle
solution (10% or 1% DMSO, respectively) and vortexed immediately
before intraperitoneal injection. AM281 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) was sus-
pended in vehicle solution (4%, 8%, or 10% DMSO, respectively) and
vortexed
immediately
before
intraperitoneal
injection.
� 9-
Tetrahydrocannabinol (� 9-THC) was obtained from the National Insti-
tute on Drug Abuse (Rockville, MD), dissolved in 100% ethanol (100
mg/5 ml) and diluted to final concentration (1 or 0.1 mg/kg), and then
injected (i.p.). All stock solutions were kept at �80°C.
Triple immunofluorescence for CB1R and neurochemical markers. Un-
der pentobarbital anesthesia (100 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.), C57BL/6,
CB1R�/� and TCA-reporter (ROR-GFP) mice were perfused transcardi-
ally with 4% PFA in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After addi-
tional immersion in the same fixative for 4 h, the sections (50-�m-thick)
were prepared with a microslicer (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems). All
incubations were done at room temperature, and PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100 was used as an antibody diluent and washing solution.
After blocking with 10% normal donkey serum for 20 min, the sections
from CB1R�/� and CB1R�/� were subjected to triple immunofluores-
cence for guinea pig anti-CB1R (Fukudome et al., 2004), goat or rabbit
anti-vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT), anti-vesicular
glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1), and anti-VGluT2 (Miyazaki et al.,
2003). The sections from ROR-GFP mice were subjected to triple immu-
nofluorescence staining using guinea-pig anti-CB1R, goat anti-GFP
(Takasaki et al., 2010), and rabbit anti-VGluT2. Sections from different
genotypes were treated simultaneously, incubated overnight in a mixture
of primary antibodies raised in different species. After several washes, the
sections were incubated for 2 h in a mixture of 1:200 diluted species-
specific secondary antibodies linked to Alexa-488 (Invitrogen), Cy3, or
Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Image acquisition and analysis of CB1R immunoreactivity. Images of
single optical sections were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning mi-
croscope (FV1000, Olympus). All images were obtained by restricting the
width of the emission wavelength using spectral slits, and by using se-
quential laser scanning to minimize fluorescence cross talk. Confocal
images from sections of different genotypes stained with the same anti-
body combinations were obtained using the same acquisition settings.
Intensity of CB1R immunoreactivity was measured using MetaMorph
software (Molecular Devices). In brief, images were separated into indi-
vidual channels and converted to grayscale. Then, VGluT1, VGluT2, or
VIAAT signals from each channel that were above the threshold were
automatically identified as objects. Subsequently, corresponding regions
were created using the Create Regions Around Objects tool. CB1R inten-
sity in individual puncta was measured using the Region Measurements
tool for each region. In each mouse, 500–1000 puncta for each class of
terminals were analyzed and averaged. Statistical significance among
multiple groups was assessed using a one-way ANOVA with post hoc
Bonferroni’s test.
Immunohistochemistry for VGluT2 staining in thalamocortical slices.
Under isoflurane anesthesia (2%–4% for induction), C57BL/6 mice were
perfused transcardially with 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4. Brains were post-
fixed with the same fixative overnight at 4°C; then, the thalamocortical
sections (100 �m thick) were prepared with a microslicer (VT-1000S,
Leica Microsystems). Six floating sections (per animal) were used for all
of the subsequent steps. Sections were washed with PBS with 0.01%
Triton X-100 (PBST) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 20 min and then washed again with PBST. Nonspecific reactions were
blocked with 3% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h. Sections were
incubated with anti-VGluT2 antibodies (Millipore Bioscience Research
Reagents; 1:5000) in PBST containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 1% normal goat
serum at 4°C overnight. Sections were washed with PBST and then incu-
bated with AlexaFluor-647-conjugated anti-(guinea-pig immunoglobu-
lin G) goat antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:1000) in PBST. DAPI
(Invitrogen) staining (1:10,000) was also performed for 1 h to identify L4
areas and barrel borders. All processes were performed at room temper-
ature, unless otherwise described.
Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan2 Imaging
MOT with 2.5�/0.12 and 5�/0.25 Zeiss objectives (magnification/NA),
and were analyzed with AxioVision software.
Immunohistochemical enhancement of GFP for TCA-reporter mice
(ROR-GFP). To confirm the expression pattern of the reporter gene in
the ROR-GFP mice, double immunohistochemical staining of the GFP
fluorescence and �-gal was performed. Thalamocortical sections were
prepared like those for VGluT2 immunohistochemistry. A chicken anti-
GFP antibody was used to enhance the GFP fluorescence (Sigma;
1:1000), together with the rabbit anti-�-gal antibody (Sigma; 1:1000).
For blocking nonspecific responses, sections were first incubated with
3% normal goat serum with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, and then
transferred to a solution containing rabbit anti-GFP antibody overnight
at 4°C. Sections were washed with PBS 3 times for 10 min each, and then
incubated with a solution containing Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-
chicken antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:1000) and Alexa-647-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:1000) for 1 h. After being
washed with PBS, sections were mounted on slides and imaged with a
Zeiss AxioImager M1 system with 2.5�/0.8 and 5�/0.16 objectives, with
the same exposure time for all sections.
Analysis of fluorescence intensity. In the thalamocortical slices from the
right hemisphere, four or five barrels representing the left side of whis-
kers were selected. For each barrel, fluorescence intensity along a vertical
line through the center of the barrel was analyzed from the pia surface to
the white matter by using densitometry in the ImageJ software. For com-
parison across slices, differential values at each point from internal stan-
dard points at white matter (or in some cases, just below the pia surface)
were obtained. Mean � SEM values from each slice were calculated and
plotted as a function of the distance from the pia surface.
Staining thalamocortical afferents with 1,1�-dioctadecyl-3,3,3�,3�-
tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) crystals. For morphological
characterization of the thalamocortical afferents, living thalamocortical slices
(350–400 �m) were prepared from P12 CB1R�/�, CB1R�/�, and
CB1R�/� mice in exactly the same way as the slices prepared for electro-
physiology. Slices were kept in a holding chamber in oxygenated ACSF.
One or two tiny crystals of DiI (Molecular Probes) were chosen and
inserted into the VB region of the thalamus with a 30 gauge needle under
a dissection microscope. The slices containing DiI crystals were fixed by
immersion into 4% PFA containing 4% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for 1–2 d
(overnight). Slices were moved to PBS with 0.01% NaN2 and kept in the
dark for 4–8 weeks at room temperature for dye diffusion.
To identify the L4 barrel pattern, DAPI staining was also performed as
described above. Stained axons were carefully checked, and only those
running deep from and in parallel with the section surface were selected
to avoid incomplete representation of axonal arbors by slicing processes.
The arborization patterns of identifiable single DiI-labeled axons were
acquired in stacks of 1-�m-interval images using either Zeiss LSM 710
confocal microscope with 20�/0.8/0.55 (Plan-Apochromat) and 10�/
0.3/5.2 (EC Plan-Neofluar) objectives (magnification/NA/working dis-

FLUOTAR) and 25�/0.95/0.17 water-immersion (HCX IRAPO L) ob-
jectives. Single thalamocortical axons were identified and reconstructed
above the layer V/VI boundary, and all the arbors found within layers I-V
were traced using the NeuronJ software. For quantitative analysis of ax-
onal arbor density, a region of interest covering all parts of the axonal
arbor was first determined by connecting the most external axonal tips or
axonal parts to a bifurcating point occurring just below layer 4. This was
done to ensure that the region of interest area is as low as possible. The
density of the axonal arbor was defined by length/area of the region of
interest (�m/�m 2).
Statistical analysis. All values in the text and figures are presented as
mean � SEM, unless otherwise specified. Student’s paired and unpaired
t tests were performed. For comparison of multiple groups, ANOVA was
first performed, and significance was determined by a post hoc test when
necessary. A p value of �0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Target-dependent developmental switch in STDP at
thalamocortical synapses
In the barrel cortex, L5 and L6 are already differentiated from the
CP at birth (P0), whereas the rest of the layers (L2–4) are not
(Rice and Van der Loos, 1977). At this stage, TCAs can be found
in L5–6, and some have reached the CP (Rebsam et al., 2002).
Thereafter, TCAs continue to invade the CP, and transient exten-
sion of TCAs reaches near the pial surface around P2-P4 (Senft
and Woolsey, 1991; Rebsam et al., 2002). These largely retract
later, although portions of axons remain in L2/3 at P5 (Agmon et
al., 1993). To examine whether the plastic property of synapses at
TCAs to cortical cells changes during extension and retraction of
axons, whole-cell recordings were made from cells above the
L4-L3 border. Because L4 is differentiated from CP at P3-P4, the
L4-L3 border becomes clearer at this age, whereas L2/3 is not well
differentiated until around P4 (Rice and Van der Loos, 1977;
Senft and Woolsey, 1991); cells above L4-L3 border were desig-
nated as CP cells until P4. We showed previously that L4-L2/3
synapses exhibit t-LTP during axon extension and synapse for-
mation (Itami and Kimura, 2012); here we tested whether
TCA-CP synapses exhibit similar properties. Consistent with
previous work, stimulation of the VB elicited EPSPs with a large
decay constant, which was sensitive to D-AP5, a selective antago-
nist against the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (Agmon and
O’Dowd, 1992; Crair and Malenka, 1995; Isaac et al., 1997; Itami
et al., 2003; Yanagisawa et al., 2004). Pairing stimulation with
pre-before-post timing (75 ms, positive timing delay; � timing)
induced clear long-term potentiation (t-LTP) (Fig. 1A). By test-
ing various timing delays, including positive and negative (150 to
�200 ms) values, we found that only t-LTP was induced, but the
magnitude of t-LTP changed in a timing-dependent manner (Fig.
1B), similar to L4-L2/3 synapses at P7-P13 (Itami and Kimura,
2012). t-LTP at L4-L2/3 synapse during the second postnatal
week requires NMDA receptors and activation of PKA (Itami and
Kimura, 2012). We found that pairing-induced t-LTP at
thalamocortical synapses during the first postnatal week was also
dependent on NMDA receptors because D-AP5 (50 �M) success-
fully blocked the induction of t-LTP (Fig. 1C,E; p � 0.01, n � 8,
25 ms timing delay, one-way ANOVA). Similarly, involvement of
PKA in the t-LTP induction was confirmed by experiments with
Rp-cAMP-S, an inhibitor of cAMP cascade, which blocked t-LTP
induction when applied to postsynaptic cells directly from re-
cording pipettes (50 �M, Fig. 1D,E; p � 0.05, n � 16, 25 ms
timing delay, one-way ANOVA). We then examined whether
properties of t-LTP changed with ages as L2/3 differentiated from
CP. Recordings were made from L2/3 cells on and after P5 and
STDP of TCA to L2/3 cells was tested by applying negative timing
stimulation (�10 ms, post-before-pre). We found that the mag-
nitude of t-LTP decreased gradually after P5, at which point de-
pression began to be induced. After P7-P8, only depression was
induced (Fig. 1F).
Next, we tested whether TCA-L4 synapses were capable of
inducing STDP of any type because the canonical target layer of
TCAs is L4. One previous study demonstrated that simple pairing
of afferent stimulation and postsynaptic depolarization (from
�10 to 0 mV) induced LTP at the VB-L4 synapse, but only until
P7 (Crair and Malenka, 1995). We tested the spike timing stim-
ulation (�25 ms) at VB-L4 synapses and found that t-LTP was
unable to be induced after P8 (Fig. 1G,H). Indeed, none of the
timing stimulations ranging from �200 to 150 ms caused poten-
tiation or depression at VB-L4 synapses after P8 (Fig. 1I; n � 33).
These results demonstrate that the properties of STDP at
thalamocortical synapses changes during development, depend-
ing on the target layers and age.
Thalamus to L2/3 projections possess CB1Rs at the terminal
during the second postnatal week
We next investigated what caused t-LTD at TCA-L2/3 after P7-
P8. Because the LTD component of Hebbian STDP with LTP/
LTD at the L4-L2/3 synapse after P13-P15 is mediated by CB1R
(Sjo
¨stro
¨m et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2006; Nevian and Sakmann,
2006; Itami and Kimura, 2012), we examined whether TCA-L2/3
synapses possess functional CB1Rs. Application of WIN, a CB1R
agonist, suppressed VB-evoked EPSPs (5 �M; Fig. 2B), as sum-
marized in Figure 2F (CB1R�/�, VB ¡ L2/3, 69.3 � 4.1% of
control, n � 8, p � 0.01, t test, second from right). However,
because CB1Rs are reportedly localized at L4 terminals to L2/3
cells at least after P16 (Sjo
¨stro
¨m et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2006;
Nevian and Sakmann, 2006; Itami and Kimura, 2012), it is pos-
sible that WIN suppression was disynaptically induced, and TCA
terminals may not possess functional CB1Rs. To rule out this
possibility, we used both global CB1R-KOs (CB1R�/�) and cor-
tical
glutamatergic-specific
CB1R-KO
mice
(NEX-Cre�/�;
CB1Rfl/fl) to confirm the localization of CB1Rs responsible for the
suppression of EPSPs at the thalamic terminals. Using global
KOs, we confirmed that WIN suppression was mediated by
CB1Rs because WIN application did not suppress VB-evoked
EPSPs in L2/3 cells (Fig. 2C,F; CB1R�/� VB ¡ L2/3, 99.7 � 1.5%
of control, n � 10, p � 0.85, t test). Then, we found that WIN
suppressed VB-evoked EPSPs in NEX-Cre�/�;CB1Rfl/fl, in which
CB1Rs were knocked out only in cortical excitatory cells (Fig.
2D,F; NEX-Cre�/�;CB1Rfl/fl, VB ¡ L2/3, 80.6 � 2.9% of control,
n � 15, p � 0.0001, t test). This was recapitulated in control
flox/flox mice (Fig. 2E,F; CB1Rfl/fl, VB ¡ L2/3, 77.7 � 6.5% of
control, n � 10, p � 0.01, t test) to a similar extent (p � 0.66,
unpaired t test). These results suggest that the CB1Rs responsible
for WIN suppression were located directly on thalamic terminals.
We showed that negative, as well as positive timing delay stim-
ulation at the VB-L4 synapse did not exhibit t-LTD during the
second postnatal week (Fig. 1H,I). This suggests that thalamic
terminals to L4 cells do not possess CB1R during the second
postnatal week. To address this, we tested WIN sensitivity and
found that VB-L4 synapses were not sensitive to applied WIN (5
�M) (Fig. 2F; CB1R�/�, VB ¡ L4), which is consistent with other
morphological studies indicating the lack of CB1R localization at
L4 (Bodor et al., 2005; Yoneda et al., 2013). These results suggest
that differential expression of functional CB1R, depending on the
target layers, underlies the expression of t-LTD.

Itami et al. • STDP Switch and CB1R at Thalamocortical Projection
 Immunohistochemical localization of CB1R at
thalamocortical terminals during the second postnatal week
Next, we conducted morphological tests to determine whether
thalamocortical terminals possess CB1Rs. We investigated the
expression pattern of CB1Rs in L2/3 using triple-labeling immu-
nofluorescence with several neuronal markers. Consistent with
previous reports, CB1R labeling demonstrated fibrous structures
(Bodor et al., 2005; Kawamura et al., 2006) (Fig. 3A–C). At a
higher magnification, intense CB1R labeling was frequently asso-
ciated with VIAAT-positive terminals (Fig. 3B, arrowheads).
Low- to moderate-intensity CB1R staining overlapped with
VGluT1-positive terminals (Fig. 3C, arrowheads) and VGluT2-
positive terminals (Fig. 3B,C, arrows), the latter of which co-
rrespond to thalamocortical terminals (Fremeau et al., 2001;
Fujiyama et al., 2001). In contrast, we observed practically no
staining in CB1R�/� mice (Fig. 3D), confirming the specificity of
the antibody. We quantified the fluorescence intensity of CB1R
staining and found that it was significantly higher in VGluT1- or
VGluT2-positive terminals in L2/3 in CB1R�/� mice than in
CB1R�/� mice (Fig. 3B–D,H), although it was much lower than
that found in VIAAT-positive structures (Fig. 3B,H). We further
confirmed CB1R immunoreactivity in thalamocortical terminals
using TCA-reporter mice (ROR-GFP), which express GFP in tha-
lamic axons (Fig. 3E) (Nakagawa and O’Leary, 2003). We found
weak but significant CB1R immunoreactivity in VGluT2- and
GFP-positive terminals (Fig. 3F,G, arrows), which was also sig-
nificantly higher than that observed in CB1R-KO mice (Fig. 3H).
These results indicate that low, but significant, CB1R expression
occurs in thalamic terminals in L2/3 of the barrel cortex at P10.
Because some thalamic terminals express both VGluT1 and
VGluT2 at this age (Nakamura et al., 2007), we could not deter-
mine whether L4 terminals possessed CB1Rs.
t-LTD at thalamus-L2/3 synapses is mediated by CB1R, and
induced in both positive and negative timing delays during
the second postnatal week
We then examined whether CB1R was involved in the induction
of t-LTD at VB-L2/3 synapses. Post-before-pre stimulation (�25
ms) at VB-L2/3 synapse consistently induced t-LTD (Fig. 4A), as
summarized in Figure 4D (VB ¡ L2/3, post-before-pre, 55.6 �
6.3% of control, n � 18, p � 0.05, t test). AM251 (5 �M), a CB1R
inverse agonist, successfully blocked the induction of t-LTD (Fig.

experiments using WIN (Fig. 4C,D; VB ¡ L2/3 WIN � post-
before-pre, 101.4 � 3.1% of pre-pairing after WIN treatment,
n � 9, p � 0.64, t test). In contrast, we confirmed that, at
L4-L2/3 synapses, post-before-pre stimulation resulted in
modest LTP (114.4 � 6.4% of control, range 57.0%–175.7%)
during the second postnatal week, as shown in Figure 4D (left
column) and consistent with a previous study (Itami and
Kimura, 2012).
We then examined the timing dependence of t-LTD, i.e.,
whether the magnitude of the depression changes depending on
the spike timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. When
tested with various pairing stimulation timing, we found that
pre-before-post, as well as post-before-pre, timing led to a vari-
able magnitude of depression in a timing-dependent manner: that
is, the shorter the timing difference, the larger the depression (Fig.
4E).ThisSTDPprofileisoppositetothatobservedinL4-L2/3during

 Localization of CB1Rs responsible for t-LTD using global and
cortical excitatory cell-specific CB1R-KOs
The requirement of CB1Rs in t-LTD at VB-L2/3 synapses during
P9-P13 was confirmed by the lack of t-LTD in global CB1R-KOs
(Fig. 5A,C; CB1R�/�, 97.9 � 1.4%, n � 10), in contrast to the
modest and robust t-LTD formation in CB1R heterozygotes (Fig.
5C; CB1R�/�, 85.4 � 2.7%, n � 23, p � 0.008, t test) and in CB1R
wild-type mice (Fig. 5A,C; CB1R�/�, 77.2 � 4.5%, n � 13, p �
0.001, t test). However, t-LTD at VB-L2/3 was induced in cortical
glutamatergic-specific CB1R-KOs (Fig. 5B,C; NEX-Cre�/�;
CB1Rfl/fl, 78.9 � 6.5%, n � 12, p � 0.01, t test) to the same extent
as in their littermate control flox/flox mice (Fig. 5B,C; CB1Rfl/fl,
77.7 � 6.6% of baseline, n � 10, p � 0.01, t test). These results
indicate that t-LTD at VB-L2/3 synapses was mediated by CB1Rs
that were most likely localized at thalamic terminals, but not at
cortical cells. On the contrary, we confirmed that t-LTD at L4-
L2/3 after P15 was mediated by CB1Rs located at cortical cells,
consistent with the previous studies (Bender et al., 2006; Itami
and Kimura, 2012). During P15-P19, global KOs failed to exhibit
t-LTD at L4-L2/3 synapses (Fig. 5D,F; CB1R�/�, 103.6 � 4.2%,
n � 10, p � 0.41, t test), as did the cortical glutamatergic cell-
specific KOs (Fig. 5E,F; NEX-Cre�/�;CB1Rfl/fl, 101.1 � 3.4%,
n � 14, p � 0.62, t test). t-LTD was induced in control flox/flox
mice (Fig. 5E,F; CB1Rfl/fl, 77.9 � 5.1%, n � 14, p � 0.001, t test).
These results indicate that t-LTD at L4-L2/3 synapses is mediated
by CB1Rs located at cortical glutamatergic neurons, most likely at
L4 cell terminals to L2/3 cells after P15.
Together, our results demonstrate that thalamic terminals to
L2/3 pyramidal cells possess functional CB1Rs and that these
receptors most likely mediate t-LTD during the second postnatal
week.

Itami et al. • STDP Switch and CB1R at Thalamocortical Projection
 and age. Before CP is differentiated to L4, L2/3, TCA-CP exhib-
ited t-LTP in both pre-before-post and post-before-pre timing.
After L4 and L2/3 are differentiated, TCA-L2/3 synapses exhib-
ited t-LTD in both pre-before-post and post-before-pre timing,
whereas TCA-L4 lost STDP (Fig. 6A). Thus, thalamocortical
STDP switched its direction from strengthening to weakening
with the emergence of L4, L2/3. We previously demonstrated
that, under t-LTP mechanism, random firing of presynaptic and
postsynaptic cells within a short time window (e.g., �50 to 50
ms) strengthened the synaptic connection (Itami and Kimura,
2012). A developmental switch of STDP from t-LTP (Fig. 1B) to
t-LTD (Fig. 4E) predicts that closely associated firing of presyn-
aptic and postsynaptic cells would result in a transition from
strengthening (LTP) to weakening (LTD) of synaptic connec-
tions during development. We tested whether such a transition
actually occurs at thalamocortical synapses. Computer-generated
random-delay timing stimulation (Fig. 6B–D) was applied to pre-
synaptic and postsynaptic cells. We found that this random-delay
stimulation led to potentiation (126.4 � 9.1% of control, n � 5)
in P5-P6 animals, whereas depression (54.4 � 6.8% of control,
n � 8) was induced in P8-P13 animals (Fig. 6E). This result
indicates that correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity
leads to a stronger connection during the first postnatal week, but
a weaker connection during the second postnatal week, regard-
less of spiking order. A similar transition was demonstrated at
L4-L2/3, when STDP was shown to switch from t-LTP to Heb-
bian STDP at P13-P15 (Itami and Kimura, 2012).
Exogenous administration of cannabinoid agonist leads to
morphological attenuation of thalamocortical projections
Next, we asked whether continuous physiological changes due to
an activation of CB1R could lead to any morphological changes
in thalamocortical projections. To test this, we observed mor-
phology following chronic administration of CB1R agonists or
antagonist. In this experiment, we again used TCA-reporter mice
(ROR-GFP), which express GFP in thalamic axons (Nakagawa
and O’Leary, 2003). Our finding that the magnitude of t-LTP
gradually decreased from P4-P5 and switched to t-LTD after
P7-P8 (Fig. 1F) raises the possibility that t-LTD begins around

 P4-P5. In support of this, WIN adminis-
tration (1 mg/kg, P2-P3 to P7, i.p. injec-
tion, daily) strongly suppressed thalamic
innervation in the cortex at P7 (Fig. 7A,
bottom). In contrast, AM281 administra-
tion (15 mg/kg, P5 to P12, i.p. injection,
daily) slightly enhanced thalamic innerva-
tions (Fig. 7C, bottom). Quantitative
analyses of the WIN and AM281 effects
were performed with VGluT2 staining,
which confirmed that both effects were
dose-dependent (Fig. 8A–D). We further
tested � 9-THC, another CB1R agonist
and an active ingredient of marijuana, on
thalamic axons. � 9-THC injection (10
mg/kg, P2-P7, i.p., daily) strongly sup-
pressed normal thalamic innervation, as
visualized by GFP (Fig. 7E,F). This sup-
pression was also dose-dependent, as con-
firmed by VGluT2 staining (Fig. 8E,F).
From these results, we concluded that
exogenous administration of CB1R ago-
nists attenuated thalamocortical innerva-
tion. Therefore, physiological changes due
to CB1R activation could be linked to mor-
phological alterations.
Endogenous cannabinoid signaling
regulates thalamocortical projections
The next question we addressed was
whether endogenous cannabinoid sig-
naling participates in the regulation of
thalamocortical projections. To explore
this, we stained individual TCAs with DiI
in thalamocortical slices from CB1R�/�,
CB1R�/�, and CB1R�/� mice at P12, and
compared morphologies between the ge-
notypes. TCAs are known to be confined
under the L4-L2/3 border and within a
single barrel in L4 in matured cortex (Ber-
nardo and Woolsey, 1987). In support of
this, individual TCAs labeled with DiI ter-
minated within each barrel at P12 (Fig.
9A,C) in CB1R�/� animals. In contrast,
in CB1R�/� and CB1R�/� animals, a
number of TCAs persisting in L2/3 could
be observed, and they seemed to ignore
the barrel borders (Fig. 9B,D,E). Quanti-
tatively, the total axon length and the
number of branches in L4-L2/3 areas were
not significantly different between the genotypes (Fig. 10A,B;
p � 0.102 and 0.936, respectively, one-way ANOVA). However,
the proportion of the axon length found in L2/3 compared with
the total length found in L4-L2/3 was significantly larger in
CB1R�/� and CB1R�/� (Fig. 10C; p � 0.001, one-way ANOVA).
In addition, we measured the density of the axonal arbor within an
arborization area to quantify the diffuseness of the branching. We
foundthatthearborizationofaxonsinCB1R�/�andCB1R�/�mice
wassignificantlylessdensethanthatofCB1R�/�mice(Fig.10D;p�
0.001, one-way ANOVA). These results are consistent with the idea
that CB1R signaling regulated thalamic axons in L2/3 to be confined
within L4. This implies that endogenous CB1R signaling participate
in the regulation of thalamocortical projections.
Discussion
Differential expression of CB1Rs at thalamocortical terminals
to L4 and L2/3 cells
We found that thalamic projections to L2/3 express CB1Rs and
show t-LTD, while thalamic projections to L4 do not express
functional CB1Rs, nor do they show STDP during the second
postnatal week. These findings seem to indicate that the thalamic
neurons projecting to L4 are distinct from those projecting to
L2/3, as it is likely that different terminals of the same neuron
express the same presynaptic receptors (Kimura and Baughman,
1997). However, the opposite case can also occur, in which the
expression of presynaptic receptors (Shigemoto et al., 1996; Sun
and Dobrunz, 2006), or other presynaptic properties, such as

Itami et al. • STDP Switch and CB1R at Thalamocortical Projection
 release probabilities (Reyes et al., 1998;
Rozov et al., 2001), is distinct across termi-
nals of the same neuron and determined
by the postsynaptic identity. Thus, we can-
not rule out the possibility that distinct
branches of the same thalamic axons proj-
ect to L4 and L2/3 cells, whereas only those
terminating onto L2/3 cells express CB1Rs
during the second postnatal week.
Site of action of cannabinoids
We used both a NEX-Cre animal and a
global knock-out of CB1R and demon-
strated that t-LTD at L4-L2/3 synapses is
not induced in either animals. We thus
concluded that the sites of action of canna-
binoids responsible for t-LTD at L4-L2/3
synapses are most likely the cortical syn-
apses of L4 cell terminals onto L2/3 cells.
This is important, as a previous study
claims that CB1Rs in astrocytes are re-
sponsible for cortical t-LTD (Min and
Nevian, 2012). We also demonstrated that
t-LTD at VB-L2/3 synapses was induced,
even in NEX-Cre�/�;CB1Rfl/fl mice, sug-
gesting that the CB1Rs responsible for this
t-LTD are likely to be at TCA terminals.
Strictly speaking, however, we could not
completely rule out the possibility of the
involvement of astrocytes or inhibitory
interneurons, which express abundant
CB1Rs (Bodor et al., 2005; Min and Nev-
ian, 2012). Similarly, we demonstrated
morphological reorganizations following
systemic administration of WIN, AM281,
and � 9-THC. Although not a very likely
possibility, we again could not exclude the
possibility that these substances acted on
CB1Rs at inhibitory cells, astrocytes, or
further trigeminal cells. One possible ex-
periment to address this issue would be to
use animals in which CB1Rs are knocked
out in the thalamus. Experiments using
such animals are expected to further eluci-
date the precise site of action of cannabi-
noids for producing the physiological and
morphological effects observed here.
Molecular mechanisms leading to
afferent retraction: cannabinoids
versus semaphorins
A recent study identified semaphorins (Se-
mas) as retrograde signals that are in-
volved in regulating the elimination of
early formed redundant fibers in the cere-
bellum (Uesaka et al., 2014). Sema7A facil-
itates this process and Sema3A suppresses
the elimination of multiple immature
climbing fibers, thus shaping the network
into the adult type with only single inner-
vations. Interestingly, Sema7A is ex-
pressed in the barrel cortex, although not
in L2/3, but rather in L4 spiny stellate cells,

 which are the main target neurons of thalamocortical afferents.
Therefore, Sema7A is unlikely to induce the elimination of affer-
ents in the barrel cortex (Roland et al., 2014). In support of this, a
previous study reported that Sema7A facilitates branching and
synapse formation in thalamocortical axons (Fukunishi et al.,
2011). It is not uncommon for the same molecules to play differ-
ent roles in different areas of the brain. For example, Sema3A
suppresses elimination in the cerebellum (Uesaka et al., 2014) but
works as a repellent molecule and inhibits axon branching in the
cortex (Dent et al., 2004).
Through what molecular mechanism does CB1R activation
cause axon disruption? The exact role of cannabinoid signaling in
the alteration of neuronal morphology is controversial, with
some studies reporting neurite retraction (Berghuis et al., 2007;
Argaw et al., 2011) and others indicating neurite outgrowth
(Mulder et al., 2008; Vitalis et al., 2008; Watson et al., 2008).

Itami et al. • STDP Switch and CB1R at Thalamocortical Projection
J. Neurosci., June 29, 2016 • 36(26):7039–7054 • 7051
 leads to rapid neural remodeling by the retraction of neurites and
growth cones. They found that CB1R activation coupled to G12/13
proteins triggers rapid nonmuscle myosin II-dependent contrac-
tion of the actomyosin cytoskeleton through a Rho-GTPase and
Rho-associated kinase (Roland et al., 2014), which may underlie
the current observations. This is also interesting because t-LTD is
most likely mediated by the G i/o protein (Castillo et al., 2012). If
thalamocortical neurons exhibit both t-LTD and retraction
through CB1R in the same cell, as suggested from the present
study, CB1R may work as a molecule that links physiological and
morphological changes by using distinct G-proteins. Further
study will be necessary to determine whether G i/o, G 12/13, and
CB1R colocalize at the same thalamic neurons.
t-LTP and t-LTD may underlie network formation
and reshaping
It has been shown that neural activity is required for initial syn-
apse formation of thalamocortical axons on cortical cells (Katz
and Shatz, 1996), but the precise activities of the presynaptic and
postsynaptic cells required were unknown. In addition, the
mechanism by which activity is further translated into structural
changes has been unclear. We have shown here that robust t-LTP
at the TCA-CP synapse can be induced until P4-P5, but its mag-
nitude decreases gradually, likely resulting from an addition of
t-LTD and reduction of t-LTP. This then switches to t-LTD after
P7-P8 at the noncanonical target layer of L2/3, and STDP is lost at
the canonical target of L4. Thus, the period during which t-LTP
and t-LTD can be induced matches closely the time of synapse
formation and retraction, respectively, at the thalamocortical
synapse. We also showed that, under t-LTP and t-LTD rule,
closely related activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic cells
caused strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections re-
gardless of spike order (Fig. 6E). These findings indicate that
STDP rule and spontaneous activity may underlie network for-
mation and reshaping at thalamocortical projections at least dur-
ing the first two postnatal weeks. t-LTP has also been suggested to
underlie synapse formation at L4-L2/3 synapse during the second
postnatal week (Itami and Kimura, 2012). Interestingly, in both
cases, t-LTP is switched to a distinct form of STDP in about a
week; t-LTP is switched to t-LTD at TCA synapses for shaping
aberrant innervations to L2/3. Similarly, t-LTP is switched to
Hebbian STDP with LTP/LTD at L4-L2/3 synapses, which is
highly relevant to the initiation of critical period of map plastic-
ity, as we have discussed (Itami and Kimura, 2012). This is be-
cause the developmental switch of STDP at L4-L2/3 synapses
coincides with the developmental establishment of sequential
“L4 followed by L2/3” spiking activity by sensory inputs, due to
the fast activation of parvalbumin-GABA cells in L4 by thalamic
inputs (Kimura et al., 2010; Itami and Kimura, 2012). Thus,
STDP and its alteration are closely related to the formation
and/or function of neuronal circuits.
What causes the developmental switch of STDP at
thalamocortical synapses?
We demonstrated that CB1R was expressed during the second
postnatal week when t-LTD could be induced. It is most likely
that the expression of CB1R caused the developmental switch of
STDP. Future immunohistochemical studies identifying devel-
opmental changes in the CB1R expression at TCA terminals or
studies using quantitative PCR to assess CB1R mRNA levels at the
VB nucleus are needed. The production of endocannabinoids
may well be developmentally regulated. However, there are as yet
no studies exploring the developmental changes in the amounts
of endocannabinoids or their synthesizing enzymes.
We show that t-LTP is dependent on NMDA receptors (Fig.
1C,E). Although we have not performed the testing, NMDA re-
ceptors may also be involved in the induction of t-LTD (Sjo
¨stro
¨m
et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2006). Are there changes in the activa-
tion of NMDA receptors that may be relevant to a developmental
switch or an extinction of STDP? The dominant subunit compo-
nents of NMDA receptors change from NR2B to NR2A at
TCA-L4 synapses during the first postnatal week (Barth and
Malenka, 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Yanagisawa et al., 2004). Although
there are currently no studies regarding such a subunit change at
TCA-L2/3 synapses, it was shown that suppressing the emergence
of the NR2A subunit is unable to block the extinction of pairing-
induced LTP at TCA-L4 synapses in NR2A-knock-out mice (Lu
et al., 2001). This change in the properties of NMDA receptors
may not be relevant to the developmental changes of STDP.
CB1R signaling and disruption of the neural network
We have demonstrated that endogenous CB1R signaling is re-
quired for the formation of normal thalamocortical projections.
We also showed that exogenously applied CB1R ligands disrupt
the normal formation of thalamocortical projections. CB1R is
one of the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptors in the
brain and is prevalent throughout the CNS. Our findings predict
that CB1Rs may play an important role in network formation in
other areas of the brain. This hypothesis should be explored in
more detail in future work, as the abuse of substances that change
cannabinoid signaling may cause serious disruptions in neural
projections. Considering that most CB1R ligands are highly lipo-
philic and easily pass the blood–brain barrier, the use of canna-
