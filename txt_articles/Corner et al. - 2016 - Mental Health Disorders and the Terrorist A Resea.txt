ABSTRACT
Recent research on lone-actor terrorism has found a high prevalence of
mental health disorders among these offenders. This research note
addresses two shortcomings in these existing studies. First, it
investigates whether selection effects are present in the selection
process of terrorist recruits. Second, it builds on the argument that
mental health problems and terrorist behavior should not be treated
as a yes/no dichotomy. Descriptive results of mental health disorders
are outlined utilizing a number of unique datasets.
Academic research on the link between mental health problems and terrorist activity has had
a long, inconsistent, occasionally frustrating, and well-documented history. Early studies
highlighted very specific mental disorders like psychopathy1 or personality disorders such as
narcissism.2 Later, highly influential literature reviews were correct to question the data qual-
ity, assumptions, and methodological rigor of many of these early “studies.”3 These reviews
were nuanced, well argued, and offered a roadmap ahead for future research. However, over
the past ten years, many of the citations that these reviews accrued made three fundamental
misconceptions that have each impaired the study of mental illness and terrorist involve-
ment. Collectively these misconceptions led to the false idea that mental health problems
have nothing to do with terrorism. In reality, what the reviews illustrated was the lack of evi-
dence to suggest that very specific forms of mental illness caused terrorism.
The first fundamental misconception is that the citations treat terrorism, and more
importantly what it means to be a terrorist, in an aggregated, often generic fashion. They fail
to acknowledge that being a bomb-maker may be different than being a bomb-planter; that
being a foreign fighter may differ from being a terrorist attacking the homeland; that being a
terrorist financier may be different than being a gunman; and that being a lone-actor may be
different than being a group-actor. Their roles, functions, expectations, and experiences may
differ in terms of recruitment, (self-)selection, routine activities while “being” a terrorist, and
ultimately disengagement.4 This is a surprising, almost universally adopted position
and occurred despite Victoroff’s argument that “terrorist groups typically exhibit hierarchi-
chal organization, with various roles … [that] … may attract individuals with different

 predispositions who perhaps play their roles because of profoundly different psychological
factors” and that “any empirical study claiming to characterize ‘the psychology of terrorists’
might be very misleading if it fails to stratify its findings according to level and role.”5
Second, they treat mental disorder in a similarly static and dichotomous fashion. The very
earliest studies spoke of very specific mental disorders. The reviews were also equally careful
in their terminology. The citations of the latter were simply not. Instead, arguments that the
terrorist is mentally ill or is not abounded. There is next to no acknowledgment that clinical
diagnoses of mental health problems span a wide range, from common mental health disor-
ders such as depression to severe pathology such as schizophrenia as well as disorders of
personality and neurodevelopment.6
Third, the citations assume that because of the flaws inherent in the early studies, there is
no relationship. What the reviews show is the lack of scientific rigor and not scientific evi-
dence to the contrary. Instead they point towards factors explaining why mental health prob-
lems may not be so prevalent (e.g., selection effects in the recruitment process). Merari sums
up this misconception brilliantly:
By and large, the opinion that terrorists do not have a common psychological profiles rests on
the absence of research rather than on direct findings. A scientifically sound conclusion that ter-
rorists have no common personality traits must be based on many comparative studies of terro-
rists from different countries and functions, using standard psychological tests and clinical
interviews. As such studies have not been published, the only scientifically sound conclusion for
now is that we do not know whether terrorists share common traits, but we cannot be sure that
such traits do not exist.7 (emphasis in the original)
Recent research on lone-actor terrorists has begun to overcome the first fundamental
error. Several studies now highlight that mental disorder is more common in lone-actor ter-
rorists than group-actors.8 Corner and Gill9 also demonstrated that lone-actor terrorists
with a mental health disorder were just as likely to engage in a range of rational attack plan-
ning behaviors as those lone-actors without mental health disorders. This ran contrary to
speculation within the wider literature that irrationality, spontaneity, and incapability would
be more heavily associated with terrorist attacks attributed to lone-actors with mental health
disorders.
This research note attempts to address the other two fundamental errors. First, it investi-
gates whether selection effects are present. Second, it builds on the argument that mental
health problems and terrorist behavior should not be treated as a yes/no dichotomy.
Descriptive results of mental health disorders are outlined utilizing a number of unique
datasets.
Selection Effects
Many reviews of the literature on terrorist psychology speculate that selection effects play a
large role in why there is very low prevalence of mentally disordered terrorists within terror-
ist groups.10 This rests on a few core assumptions. First, wanting to be a terrorist is not
enough to become a terrorist. Second, terrorist groups are selective in who they recruit.
Third, they prioritise certain traits that correspond to what they believe makes a good recruit
(e.g., trustworthiness, ability to follow instructions, discretion). Fourth, individuals with
mental disorders are identifiable in the recruitment stage. To varying degrees, these assump-
tions are plausible. Indeed illustrative examples correspond with some of them.11

 We are interested in whether this selection effect plays out over much larger samples than
isolated illustrate examples. While Corner and Gill12 and Gruenewald et al.13 illustrate that
mental health disorders are more likely in lone-actors than group-actors, this research note
disaggregates even further. It looks at mental health prevalence across five actor types14
including lone-mass murderers (who kill four or more people in a 24-hour period absent of
a motivating ideology),15 lone-actor terrorists, solo-actor terrorists (who conducted an act of
terrorism by themselves but were directed and controlled by a larger terrorist organization),
lone-dyads (a group of two terrorists), and terrorist group members. These five actor types
therefore encompass a continuum of actors; from loners without an ideology and fictive kin,
to loners with an ideology and fictive kin, to loners who have had some interaction with ter-
rorist groups, to those who act in combination with only one co-offender to those who have
acted within and alongside a wider group structure. Figure 1 examines the rates of mental
disorder across these five groups. It illustrates a negative association between mental disorder
and the degree to which the individual co-offends. In other words, the more isolated the
individual is in terms of the number of co-offenders and support networks, the more likely
that individual will also have mental health problems. Group-actors demonstrate signifi-
cantly lower levels of mental disorder than would be expected within a general population.16
This appears to affirm the selection effect mechanism.
Disaggregating Mental Health Problems
Despite empirical advancements in terrorism research, mental disorder as a variable for
explaining terrorist behavior remains dichotomous; a trait long discarded in psychopatho-
logical research of related crime disciplines. Following deinstitutionalisation, the prevailing
belief was that mental disorder had been criminalized, and those with a mental disorder
were more dangerous and criminally inclined.17 Hiday and Burns18 assert that the dispro-
portionately high levels of anti-social personality disorder and substance abuse or depen-
dence in prison settings distort this observation. However, multiple different disorders have
been linked to violence and criminality. Brugha et al.19 highlight that weighted prevalence of
psychosis in prisons was over ten times greater than the general population (52 per thousand
compared to 4.5 per thousand). Elbogen and Johnson20 statistically demonstrated that

 schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder were only reliable predictors
of violence when there was substance abuse/dependence co-morbidity. In a cross sectional
survey of disorder prevalence across nonviolent men, violent men, and gang members, Coid
et al.21 noted prevalence differences across six disorder groups (psychosis, anxiety, depres-
sion, alcohol dependence, drug dependence, anti-social personality disorder). Gang mem-
bers bore the highest prevalence across all disorder groups. Prevalence differences between
violent men and gang members ranged between 11.2 percent for depression, and 56.6 per-
cent for anti-social personality disorder. Fazel, Doll, and Langstr€
om22 performed a system-
atic meta-analysis of 25 surveys concerning mental disorder prevalence in juvenile detention
settings, observing gender differences in prevalence of four disorder groups. Psychotic illness
and conduct disorder held equal prevalence across genders, however, major depression (29.2
percent compared to 10.6 percent) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
(18.5 percent compared to 11.7 percent) were more frequently identified in females. These
investigations highlight the importance for terrorism research in expanding beyond dichoto-
mous reasoning.
While Corner and Gill23 outlined the importance of looking at mental health disorders
across the spectrum they neglected to (a) outline the prevalence of each disorder within their
lone-actor terrorist sample and (b) compare this to a base rate of the general population.
This research note attempts to address these shortcomings. Fortunately, mental disorders
are now reliably categorized by international systems and have led to detailed information
about their prevalence in the general population. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (DSM) operationalized models include the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and
the Epidemiological Catchment Area Programme. The World Health Organization (WHO)
followed suit in the late 1980s with a measure based on International Classification of Dis-
eases (ICD) criteria, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).24 Unlike the
DSM–designed measures, subsequent surveys utilizing the CIDI include more information
regarding role impairments and disability, hold international representation, and subsequent
inferences regarding prevalence, correlates, and patterns of mental disorder are deemed
more valid.25
Surveys that utilize the CIDI present multiple facets of data concerning mental disorders,
including prevalence, age of onset, disorder life course, distribution of severity, proportion
of those treated, time difference between onset and treatment, and treatment patterns. The
surveys highlight that a substantial proportion of each included population meet criteria for
one or more mental disorders during their life. These disorders are often pervasive, with
early onset, and cause significant impairment.26 Kessler and €
Ust€
un27 note, that due to con-
straints in measuring mental disorder (exclusion of population with high proportions of
severe mental disorders, e.g., homeless, survey nonresponse due to refusal by the mentally
disordered, and systematic non-reporting following errors or failures) bias in prevalence
underestimations mean that data are often considered conservative. Such constraints affect
reporting, particularly influencing the few terrorism-based studies that use open source
data.28 Kessler and €
Ust€
un demonstrate cross-national differences in surveys in their analysis
of World Mental Health surveys in 17 countries. Prevalence for any disorder ranged from
12.0 percent (Nigeria) to 47.4 percent (United States) with an average prevalence of 27.43
percent.29
To overcome these constraints, this research note utilized multiple psychiatric epidemio-
logical studies to calculate the average prevalence rates of multiple disorders in the general

 population.30 We then compared these rates to the same listed mental disorders in the lone-
actor and group-actor terrorist populations examined in Corner and Gill.31
The descriptive statistics highlight inherent differences in the types of mental disorders
suffered by terrorists—particularly lone-actors—as compared to a general population. There
are only three disorders that have a substantially higher prevalence in the lone-actor popula-
tion (see Figure 2), the most noteworthy being schizophrenia. Schizophrenia has long been
accepted as having a prevalence of 1 percent (upper end)32 in general populations, and has a
contentious link to violent behavior.33 Delusional disorders also hold a litigious link with
violence.34 Those with delusional disorders hold stringent beliefs, seen by others as incon-
ceivable. Parallel to this, lone-actors show high preponderance of single-issue ideologies;
highly personal grievances linked to political aims. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) also
show a higher than expected prevalence in the lone-actor sample. Although individuals with
ASD are not linked to violent behaviors, social interaction deficits impair an individual’s
ability to maintain functional relationships. However, these individuals often foster intense
online relationships,35 a trait noted in lone-actors with ASD.36 Depression is also often
quoted in the media as being a cause of disaffected individuals “snapping” and going on a

 violent rampage. The comparably low prevalence in these descriptive statistics, alongside evi-
dence that mental disorder is rarely attributed as a direct cause of violence,37 however, sup-
ports Corner and Gill’s38 assertion that lone-actor motivation is embedded in an ideological
cause, developed over time, alongside a myriad of other proximal and distal risk factors not
just mental disorder. Phrases such as “loon wolf” that imply the mental disorder was the
(often irrational) driving force should therefore be avoided.39
In order to understand how to counter, prevent, or disrupt a problem, we first need to
understand the problem itself. The only way to understand such complex problems is by
moving toward finer-grained interpretations and testing data. This research note provides a
further call for terrorism researchers to be more exact; both in terms of the types of terrorist
they are researching and by what exactly they mean by mental health problems. These calls
are not new. They were all more or less mentioned within the seminal literature reviews
mentioned earlier. However, they were simply overlooked. The contention of the main liter-
ature reviews that some mental disorders do not play a leading role in causing terrorist
involvement holds true. However, there is a large gap between identifying something as not
causal and dismissing it as irrelevant. It is in this gap that a rigorous, data-driven, behavior-
ally oriented scientific study of the terrorist can prosper. Disaggregated and comparative
approaches, as proposed here, have the potential for major practical and conceptual benefits
for the field of research moving forward.40 Future research must delve deeper into issues
around selection-effects via first-hand interviews, investigate how mental health problems
co-occur with other risk factors, analyse how these co-occurrences are sequenced in the indi-
vidual’s pathway toward violent action, and whether the symptoms of the mental health dis-
order were prevalent at the time of the offending. They must also attempt to understand
whether and how mental health problems can be a by-product of terrorist engagement
rather than a driving force compelling people to engage in terrorism in the first place. The
study of the individual terrorist and mental health disorders appeared to be unnecessary a
few years ago. It now looks to have an exciting future due to a growth in (a) how we concep-
tualize “the terrorist” and (b) granular level datasets of terrorist behavior.
