Background
Amyloidoses are a progressive, systemic disease caused
by the accumulation in tissues of misfolded proteins
that induces multiorgan dysfunction. The most common
hereditary form is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR),
caused by the accumulation of transthyretin protein
(TTR). There are no approved pharmacologic therapies
for ATTR in the United States, and liver transplantation
is the only disease-modifying treatment. TTR, a redun-
dant thyroxin transport protein, comprises four single-
chain monomers assembled into a tetrameric complex
in its native state. During the amyloidogenic process,
the tetramer dissociates into monomeric subunits that
then undergo conformational change, making them
more prone to aggregation and fibril formation. Com-
parison of the crystal structure of tetrameric TTR and
the monomeric TTR identified a region that is inaccessi-
ble in the tetramer but exposed upon monomer disso-
ciation. By targeting this site with a monoclonal
antibody (mAb), it might be possible to prevent TTR
monomers from assembling into fibrils without influen-
cing the function of the native tetramer. The objective
of this study was to produce mAbs targeting this
exposed epitope of monomeric TTR and to (a) demon-
strate conformational specificity toward misfolded versus
native forms of TTR and (b) determine whether they are
able to recognize TTR deposits in diseased tissue.
Methods
Mice were immunized with a multiple antigenic peptide
comprising the target sequence identified in the structural
analysis of TTR. Clones were screened for reactivity
against misfolded TTR fibrils and counter-screened
against native tetrameric TTR. Selected mAbs were char-
acterized by sandwich ELISA, SPR, and Western blot.
Immunohistochemistry was performed in combination
with Congo red and thioflavin-T staining to demonstrate
specificity to TTR-amyloid in ATTR patient-derived tissue
sections.
Results
Four mAbs were identified that bind to the target epi-
tope on monomeric and nonnative conformations of
TTR. These mAbs bound nonnative forms of TTR (KD
values 7.7-18.6 nM) but, importantly, did not recognize
native tetrameric TTR. These mAbs also recognized
TTR deposits in a variety of ATTR heart tissues. They
did not recognize control heart tissue (normal or AL
amyloidosis) or the native tetrameric TTR present in
human liver tissue.
Conclusions
Conformation-specific mAbs immunoreact with an amy-
loidogenic epitope of TTR but not with native tetrameric
TTR. These mAbs specifically recognize TTR deposits in
ATTR heart tissue, not in control tissue (normal and AL
amyloidosis). These novel mAbs may be useful in pre-
venting deposition and/or enhancing clearance of TTR
amyloid in ATTR patients.
