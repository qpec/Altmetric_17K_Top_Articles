Letter
The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated behaviors 
across mammalian species1–3. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity, prefrontal projection 
neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward seeking behaviors, such as 
the ventral striatum and midline thalamus4. While connectivity among these structures 
contributes to appetitive behaviors5–13, how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode 
reward-relevant information to guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-
photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons during an 
appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these neurons display diverse 
activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive cues. Furthermore, recordings 
from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual corticostriatal 
neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive cues, such that excitatory cue responses 
are amplified across learning. In contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new, 
primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Finally, 
bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation of 
corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward seeking after learning, while activity in 
corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the acquisition and expression of conditioned 
reward seeking. These data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-
seeking behavior through the opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations.

 Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) respond diversely to reward-predictive cues14–17, 
although how this cue encoding fits into a broader circuitry to guide reward seeking is 
unknown. To address this, we designed a Pavlovian conditioning task that allows two-photon 
imaging of deep cortical tissue during behavior. Head-fixed mice were trained to associate 
one conditioned stimulus (CS+), but not another (CS−), with sucrose (Figure 1a,b). 
Following multiple training sessions, mice behaviorally discriminated between the cues by 
displaying anticipatory licks to the CS+ but not CS− (Figure 1c), confirming that the cue-
reward contingencies had been established by the late sessions (Figure 1d,e; Extended Data 
Fig. 1). To monitor neural activity during this task, we injected a virus into dorsomedial PFC 
for delivery of a calcium indicator18 under the control of the calcium/calmodulin dependent 
protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) promoter (AAVdj-CaMKii-GCaMP6s; Figure 1f), which 
putatively targets cortical excitatory neurons19. Ex vivo brain slice recordings revealed that 
fluorescent deflections of GCaMP6s-expressing PFC neurons reliably tracked elevations and 
reductions in action potential frequency, whereas hyperpolarization from rest alone did not 
influence GCaMP6s-mediated fluorescence (Extended Data Fig 2). Next, we implanted 
optical cannulae ~2.2mm beneath the surface of the brain, allowing chronic optical access to 
hundreds of dorsomedial PFC neurons in each awake, behaving mouse (Figure 1g–i; 
Supplementary Video 1). Collectively, we recorded from GCaMP6s-expressing PFC neurons 
before learning (n=1,473) and after learning (n=1,571), and found that while many of these 
neurons displayed increased activity in response to reward-predictive cues, other neurons 
exhibited inhibitory cue responses (Figure 1j,k,n,o). These responses were most prevalent 
during presentation of the CS+, but not the CS−, after learning (Figure 1l,m,p,q; Extended 
Data Fig. 3a,b; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Thus, the responses of many individual PFC 
neurons could be used to decode whether the CS+ or CS− was presented on any given trial 
after learning (Extended Data Fig. 4d).
We found that many dorsomedial PFC neurons encoded cues after learning; however, both 
inhibitory and excitatory responses were common. Considering this, it is possible that 
distinct populations of neurons in the PFC have opposing cue-encoding properties. Two 
major projection targets of the PFC are the nucleus accumbens (PFC-NAc) and 
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PFC-PVT)4. Furthermore, studies examining 
reward seeking in rodent addiction models have found that PFC-NAc neurons express 
immediate early genes following cue-induced relapse21,22, and inhibition of these cells can 
prevent drug seeking6–8,12. Additionally, reward-predictive cues may influence the activity 
of PVT neurons23, and such activity is thought to modulate cue salience24 and conditioned 
behaviors25,26. Thus, we hypothesized that PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons encode reward-
predictive stimuli to orchestrate appetitive learning. To test this hypothesis, we first 
determined whether PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons are distinct or overlapping 
populations of neurons. We injected retrograde cholera toxins conjugated to different 
fluorophores into NAc and PVT of the same mice. Electrophysiological recordings and 
histological analysis revealed that PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons are physiologically 
distinct and anatomically segregated within dorsomedial PFC (Extended Data Fig. 5), such 
that PFC-NAc neurons are in layers II/III and V (46% layer II/III, 51% layer V, 4% layer VI) 
whereas PFC-PVT neurons are in layer VI (0% layer II/III, 20% layer V, 79% layer VI). 
These data are consistent with anatomical studies, as corticostriatal projection neurons reside

 in layers II/III and V in rats, whereas layer VI is specific for corticothalamic neurons27,28. 
Furthermore, using a retrograde rabies-tracing strategy to sparsely label PFC-NAc or PFC-
PVT neurons as well as their afferent inputs, we found that these cell populations have both 
shared and unshared afferent connectivity (Extended Data Fig 6). Finally, PFC-NAc and 
PFC-PVT neurons express CaMKii (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d), collectively revealing that 
these neurons make up two non-overlapping subpopulations of CaMKii-expressing 
projection neurons.
We next targeted PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. 
Cre-inducible GCaMP6s (AAVdj-DIO-GCaMP6s) was injected into dorsomedial PFC, and 
in the same surgery a retrogradely transported virus, canine adenovirus-2 encoding cre-
recombinase (Cav2-cre), was injected into either the NAc or PVT (Figure 2a,g). This 
resulted in projection-specific GCaMP6s expression in PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons 
(Figure 2b,h; Extended Data Fig. 7e–j). Next, mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning with 
simultaneous head-fixed two-photon calcium imaging. Data revealed that after learning, but 
not before learning, PFC-NAc neurons primarily displayed excitation to the CS+, whereas 
fewer neurons responded to the CS− (Figure 2c–e; Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). In contrast, 
PFC-PVT neurons primarily displayed inhibition to the CS+ after learning, whereas fewer 
neurons responded to the CS− (Figure 2i–k; Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Finally, we found that 
activity in either PFC-NAc neurons (Figure 2f) or PFC-PVT neurons (Figure 2l) could be 
used to decode whether the CS+ or CS− was presented on any given trial after learning.
We found that PFC-NAc neurons and PFC-PVT neurons show distinct cue encoding profiles 
after learning, but how these response properties emerge across learning was unclear. To 
examine this, we identified individual PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons whose activity could 
reliably be monitored throughout training (Figure 3a,d). We found that many PFC-NAc 
neurons initially displayed low amplitude, phasic calcium transients to both the CS− and CS
+, such that there was little cue discrimination (Figure 3b). However, across learning the 
responses of individual PFC-NAc neurons became selective, such that responses to the CS+ 
were amplified, whereas responses to the CS− were diminished (Figure 3b,c). In contrast to 
this response tuning in PFC-NAc neurons, PFC-PVT neurons showed little response to 
either the CS+ or CS− before learning, but instead many neurons acquired new inhibitory 
responses after learning (Figure 3e,f). Thus, responses of PFC-NAc, but not PFC-PVT, 
neurons after learning could be predicted based on responses before learning (Figure 3c,f, 
correlations). Collectively, corticostriatal and corticothalamic neurons showed distinct 
functional plasticity across appetitive learning, such that PFC-NAc neurons adjusted their 
activity to allow cue discrimination, whereas PFC-PVT neurons gradually acquired 
responses for cue discrimination.
Our data reveal that projection-specific PFC neurons show distinct cue encoding properties 
across appetitive learning. However, whether this activity controls the acquisition of 
conditioned reward seeking is unclear. To test this, we targeted PFC-NAc or PFC-PVT 
neurons for optogenetic manipulation by injecting Cav2-cre into the NAc or PVT, and cre-
inducible channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP), halorhodopsin (AAV5-DIO-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP), or control (AAV5-DIO-eYFP) into dorsomedial PFC (Figure 4a–c, j–l). 
Next, we optogenetically manipulated these cells during cue delivery throughout Pavlovian

 conditioning (sessions 1–8; Figure 4d–f, m–o), and tested the effects on acquisition of this 
task during a subsequent test without laser. Data reveal that activation (in PFC-NAc::ChR2 
mice) or inactivation (in PFC-NAc::eNpHR3.0 mice) of PFC-NAc neurons did not influence 
CS+-evoked anticipatory licking during the no-laser test (Figure 4g–i), implying that these 
cells do not control the acquisition of anticipatory licking. In contrast, optogenetic activation 
of PFC-PVT neurons (in PFC-PVT::ChR2 mice) reduced CS+-evoked anticipatory licking 
during the no-laser test, whereas optogenetic inactivation of PFC-PVT neurons (in PFC-
PVT::eNpHR mice) increased anticipatory licking during the no-laser test (Figure 4p–r). 
Thus, inhibitory cue encoding in PFC-PVT neurons, but not PFC-NAc neurons, contributes 
to the acquisition of conditioned reward seeking.
Although activity in PFC-NAc neurons did not control the acquisition of conditioned reward 
seeking, differences in licking behavior were apparent between groups during the laser 
conditioning sessions (sessions 1–8; see Figure 4g,h). Thus, one possibility is that PFC-NAc 
neurons control the expression of conditioned reward seeking, rather than acquisition. To test 
this directly, we next performed the optogenetic manipulations after conditioning in separate 
groups of mice. We found that optogenetic activation of PFC-NAc neurons during the CS+ 
increased anticipatory licking (Figure 5a,d; Figure 5c,f), whereas inactivation of PFC-NAc 
neurons reduced anticipatory licking (Figure 5b,e; Figure 5c,f). In contrast, optogenetic 
activation of PFC-PVT neurons during the CS+ reduced anticipatory licking (Figure 5g,j; 
Figure 5i,l) whereas inactivation of PFC-PVT neurons had no effect (Figure 5h,k; Figure 
5i,l). The lack of effect for PFC-PVT inactivation is likely due to CS+-evoked inhibition of 
these cells (see Figures 2 and 3), as neuronal hyperpolarization from sub-threshold potentials 
should not result in further adjustment of neuronal output. Collectively, activation of PFC-
NAc neurons and inhibition of PFC-PVT neurons supports the expression of conditioned 
reward seeking.
In addition to encoding the reward-predictive stimulus after learning, some PFC-NAc and 
PFC-PVT neurons displayed CS− encoding (see Figure 2). Considering this, we also 
evaluated how projection-specific cells influenced licking during the CS−. We found that 
optogenetic perturbations of PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons during the CS− did not 
influence the acquisition of CS− licking (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). In contrast, inactivation 
but not activation of PFC-NAc neurons reduced the expression of CS− licking, whereas 
optogenetic manipulations of PFC-PVT neurons had no effect on the expression of CS− 
licking (Extended Data Fig. 8g–l). Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of PFC-NAc or 
PFC-PVT neurons during random time epochs outside of cue delivery had no effect on 
licking (Extended Data Fig. 9), nor did optogenetic manipulations produce a real-time place 
preference or aversion (Extended Data Fig. 10). Thus, activity in PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT 
neurons specifically during the cue period is critical for conditioned reward seeking.
Here we found that the opposing population dynamics of prefrontal output circuits 
orchestrates conditioned reward seeking. In addition to divergent population encoding, 
subsets of cells in both corticostriatal and corticothalamic circuits have response profiles that 
are opposite to the population overall (i.e., some PFC-NAc neurons have inhibitory CS+ 
responses, whereas some PFC-PVT cells have excitatory CS+ responses). Although the 
cause and function of such heterogeneity is unclear, it is possible that subpopulations of cells

 within each group may have distinct cell-type specific targets, afferent inputs, and spatial 
locations. Thus, while it remains unclear how all cells in PFC function to orchestrate reward 
seeking, our data suggest that projection-specific and anatomically segregated prefrontal 
neurons can have opposing activity dynamics, plasticity profiles, and functional control of 
conditioned reward seeking.
Methods
Subjects and surgery
Adult male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) or Ai9 reporter mice (Cg-
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)HzeIJ; Jackson Laboratories) were group housed (25–35g; 
6–8 weeks old) with littermates until surgery. For all experiments, mice underwent surgery 
during which they were anesthetized with 0.8–1.5% isoflurane vaporized in pure oxygen 
(1L/min) and placed within a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Ophthalmic 
ointment (Akorn) and a topical anesthetic (2% Lidocaine; Akorn) were applied during 
surgeries, and subcutaneous injections of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl in water) were 
administered to prevent dehydration. During surgeries, virus injections were administered 
unilaterally (for two-photon microscopy experiments) or bilaterally (for optogenetics or 
anatomical experiments) targeting dorsal medial PFC (specifically prelimbic cortex; 500nl/
side; relative to bregma: AP, +1.85mm; ML, ±0.60mm; DV, −2.50mm), bilaterally targeting 
NAc (500nl/side; relative to bregma: AP, +1.42mm; ML ±0.73mm; DV, −4.80mm), and/or 
on the midline targeting PVT (300nl; relative to bregma: AP, −1.46mm; ML −1.13mm; DV, 
−3.30mm; 20° angle). The UNC Vector Core packaged all viruses except canine 
adenovirus-2 encoding cre (Cav2-cre; Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier, 
France). For two-photon imaging experiments, an optical cannula (Inscopix, CA) was 
implanted above the PFC injection site (relative to bregma: AP, +1.85mm; ML −0.8mm; DV, 
−2.2mm; see Resendez et al., 2016 for details using similar surgical protocols for imaging 
experiments)29. For optogenetic experiments, custom-made optical fibers30 were implanted 
bilaterally ~0.5mm above the PFC injection sites (relative to bregma: AP, +1.85mm; ML 
±0.83mm; DV, −1.93mm; 10° angle). For experiments involving head-fixed behavior, a 
custom-made ring (stainless steel; 5mm ID, 11mm OD) was attached to the skull during 
surgery to allow head fixation (see Figure 1a). Following surgeries, mice received 
acetaminophen in their drinking water for two days, and were allowed to recover with access 
to food and water ad libitum for at least 21 days. After recovery, mice were water restricted 
(water bottles taken out of the cage), and 0.6mL of water was delivered every day to a dish 
placed within each home cage. Behavioral experiments began when mice weighed less than 
90% of free drinking weight (~10 days for all experiments). To ensure good health and 
weight maintenance, mice were weighed and handled daily. This protocol resulted in weight 
stabilization between 85–90% of free-drinking weight during each experiment. No mouse 
was given more or less than 0.6mL of water for weight concerns during water restriction 
procedures, nor did any health problems related to dehydration arise at any point from these 
protocols. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health), and were approved by 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina a 
priori.

 Head-fixed behavior
Following recovery from surgery, mice were habituated to head fixation for 3 days, during 
which unpredictable drops of sucrose (10% sucrose in water; 2.0–2.5µL) were delivered 
intermittently for one hour (~60 drops/hour) through a gravity-driven, solenoid-controlled 
lick tube. Once the mice displayed sufficient licking (>1000 licks per session), they 
underwent Pavlovian conditioning. During each conditioning session, two cues (3kHz 
pulsing or 12kHz constant tones, 2 seconds, 70dB) were randomly presented 50 times before 
the delivery of sucrose (CS+, 10% sucrose in water; 2.0–2.5µL) or no sucrose (CS−), such 
that there was a one second trace interval between delivery of the CS+ and sucrose (see 
Figure 1b). The cue contingencies were counterbalanced across cohorts of mice to ensure 
that mice acquired conditioned licking in response to either tone when paired with sucrose. 
The inter-trial interval between the previous reward delivery (CS+) or withholding time (CS
−) and the next cue was chosen as a random sample from a uniform distribution bounded by 
40s and 80s. Cue discrimination was quantified using the area under a Receiver Operating 
Curve (auROC) formed by the number of licks during the CS+ versus CS− trace intervals. 
For both two-photon and optogenetic behavioral experiments, we classified sessions as 
‘Early’ or ‘Late’ in learning, defined by both behavioral performance (Early, auROC < 0.65; 
Late, auROC > 0.66) and session number (Early, sessions 1–5; Late, sessions 7 or later). 
These criteria were used as post-hoc analysis revealed that an auROC > 0.66 approximates 
high performance in a phase space formed by behavioral performance across sessions. 
Finally, behavioral data is displayed and analyzed throughout the manuscript as the change 
in lick rate (“ΔLick Rate”) between each 3-second cue period and 1-second baseline period 
(baseline period is immediately before each cue). In addition, we show raw lick rates during 
both the cue and baseline periods for all imaging experiments (see Extended Data Fig 1). 
Baseline lick rates remained relatively low across all experiments, and therefore for 
optogenetics studies only “ΔLick Rate” is shown and analyzed (see Figures 4, Figure 5; 
Extended Data Fig. 8, Extended Data Fig. 9).
Two-photon microscopy
Experimental design—Two-photon microscopy was used to visualize activity dynamics 
of PFC neurons in vivo. A virus encoding the calcium indicator GCaMP6s18 (AAVdj-
CaMKiiα -GCaMP6s; 5.3×1012 infectious units/mL) was injected into PFC (see subjects 
and surgery). For imaging projection-specific neurons, a virus encoding the cre-dependent 
calcium indicator GCaMP6s (AAVdj-ef1α-DIO-GCaMP6s; 3.1×1012 infectious units/mL; 
from Karl Deisseroth) was injected into PFC, and the retrogradely transported canine 
adenovirus encoding cre-recombinase31,32 was injected into either NAc or PVT (Cav2-cre; 
4.2×1012 infectious units/mL). After a minimum of 8 weeks to allow virus transport and 
infection, mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning during which GCaMP6s-expressing 
neurons were visualized using two-photon microscopy.
Data acquisition, signal extraction, and analysis—A two photon microscope 
(FVMPE-RS) was equipped with the following to allow imaging of PFC in vivo: a hybrid 
scanning core set with galvanometers and fast resonant scanners (allows up to 30Hz frame-
rate acquisition; set to 2.5 Hz), multi-alkali PMT and GaAsP-PMT photo detectors with 
adjustable voltage, gain, and offset features, a single green/red NDD filter cube, a long

 working distance 20× air objective designed for optical transmission at infrared wavelengths 
(Olympus, LCPLN20XIR, 0.45NA, 8.3mm WD), a software-controlled modular XY stage 
loaded on a manual z-deck, and a tunable Mai-Tai Deep See laser system (Spectra Physics, 
laser set to 955nm, ~100fs pulse width) with automated four-axis alignment. Before each 
conditioning session, a particular field of view (FOV) was selected by adjusting the imaging 
plane (z-axis), and each FOV was spaced at least 50µm from one another to prevent 
visualization of the same cells across multiple FOVs. During each conditioning session, two-
photon scanning was triggered for each trial 7s before cue delivery, and a 20s video was then 
collected for each trial. Data were both acquired and processed using a computer equipped 
with FluoView (Olympus, FV1200) and cellSens (Olympus) software packages. Following 
data acquisition, videos were motion corrected using a planar hidden Markov model (SIMA 
v1.3)33 and regions of interest (ROIs) were hand drawn around each cell using the standard 
deviation projection of the motion-corrected video using ImageJ. Next, calcium transient 
time series data were extracted with SIMA and analyzed using custom Python data analysis 
pipelines written in the lab (by VMN). For analysis, data were split into two groups (Early 
and Late) that were defined based on behavioral performance and the day of conditioning 
(see head-fixed behavior). Next, each recorded neuron was defined as having an excitatory 
response, inhibitory response, or no response. Significant responses represent significant 
two-tailed auROC comparing average fluorescence (Δf/f) of the trace interval (1s after CS 
offset) versus baseline (1s before CS onset) where p<0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg false 
discovery rate correction. Each p-value for auROC was defined by calculating the p-values 
for the corresponding Mann-Whitney U statistic. Chi-squared tests were then used to 
compare the number of CS+ responders to CS− responders for each group. For additional 
decoding analysis (e.g. Figure 2f,l), we tested whether the identity of the cue on any given 
trial could be decoded from the mean trace interval response on that trial using support 
vector machines. To this end, we used the Python module, scikitlearn, with GridSearchCV 
and a support vector classification (SVC) estimator with a radial basis function kernel, 
optimizing across the following parameters: γ: {10−2, 10−1, 100, 101, 102}, C: {10−2, 10−1, 
100, 101, 102}. Quantification of performance was done using 10-fold validation34 For each 
neuron, the highest accuracy score across these parameters was used as the metric of 
accuracy. In order to determine whether the population of accuracy scores across all neurons 
was significantly different from that expected by chance, we performed a single shuffle per 
neuron by randomizing the cue identity on every trial. The population of shuffled accuracy 
scores across one shuffle was then compared to the population of unshuffled accuracy scores 
using a two-tailed Welch's t-test. Note that since the metric of accuracy was optimized across 
parameters, the mean accuracy score expected by chance is not 0.5, but is instead closer to 
0.55 (Figure 2f,l and Extended Data Fig. 4d). We also further tested whether the mean 
activity during the trace interval on a given trial for one neuron could be used to decode the 
number of licks in the trace interval. This was performed using support vector regression 
(SVR) in scikitlearn with GridSearchCV with a radial basis function kernel, optimizing 
across the following parameters: C: 5 logarithmically equidistant points between 10−3 and 
103 {10−3, 3.16×10−2, 100, 3.16×102, 103}, ε: 5 logarithmically equidistant points between 
10−3 and 103 {10−3, 3.16×10−2, 100, 3.16×102, 103}, γ: 10 logarithmically equidistant 
points between 10−6 and 106 {10−6, 2.15×10−5, 4.64×10−4, 10−2, 2.15×10−1, 4.64, 102, 
2.15×103, 4.64×104, 106}. Quantification of performance was done using 10-fold validation

 of the R2 metric (note that this metric can be infinitely negative, indicating arbitrarily poor 
performance, but is bounded on the positive end at 1, indicating perfect decoding). We found 
that as a population, the number of anticipatory licks during the trace interval could not be 
decoded in the late sessions in CaMKii-expressing neurons (mean R2=−1.21), PFC-NAc 
neurons (mean R2=−0.92) or PFC-PVT neurons (mean R2=−0.39). These negative numbers 
reflect the absence of a relationship between licking and calcium activity in each cell 
population.
Optogenetics
Behavioral optogenetics were performed as described in detail (see Sparta et al., 2011)30. 
Briefly, during surgery a virus encoding cre-inducible channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV5-EF1α-
DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP; 5.0×1012 infectious units/mL), halorhodopsin (AAV5-EF1α-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP; 8.0×1012 infectious units/mL), or control (AAV5-EF1α-eYFP; 6.0×1012 
infectious units/mL) was injected into PFC; and the retrogradely transported canine 
adenovirus encoding cre-recombinase31,32 was injected into either NAc or PVT (Cav2-cre; 
4.2×1012 infectious units/mL). After a minimum of 8 weeks to allow sufficient virus 
transport and infection, mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning.
For acquisition experiments (e.g., Figure 4), mice underwent 8 daily conditioning sessions 
with laser followed by a test session (no laser). For photoactivation manipulations in ChR2 
or control mice, the laser (473nm; 8–10mW) was turned on for 5ms pulses (20Hz) during 
80% of the cue trials, starting at the cue onset and ending at the reward delivery. For 
photoinhibition manipulations in eNpHR3.0 or control mice, the laser (532nm; 8–10mW) 
did not pulse. Because there was no effect of laser in the control mice, these data were 
collapsed across PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT groups. For expression experiments (e.g., Figure 
5), after mice reached high performance criterion (‘Late’, auROC>0.66), they underwent 6 
daily conditioning sessions. Furthermore, every other session was selected for optogenetic 
manipulations, during which the laser was presented for 3s during either the cue and trace 
interval or at random time epochs outside of cue or reward delivery. Because there was no 
effect of laser in the ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 control mice, these data were collapsed for PFC-
NAc groups and PFC-PVT groups. In addition, for expression experiments subsets of 
control mice were used twice, once as ChR2 controls (blue light), and again as eNpHR3.0 
controls (green light). Following experiments, histological verification of fluorescence and 
optical fiber placements were performed as described previously35.
Behavioral data (ΔLick Rate, see above) was analyzed based on a priori comparisons of 
interest (effect of laser on ChR2/eNpHR animals versus effect of laser in eYFP animals). For 
acquisition experiments (Figure 4; Extended Data Fig. 8a–f), we analyzed data from the no 
laser test day only, and specifically compared the ΔLick Rate between the ChR2 or eNpHR 
groups versus the eYFP group. To correct for the double comparison (ChR2 or eNpHR 
versus eYFP), we performed a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. For 
expression experiments (Figure 5; Extended Data Fig. 8 g–l; Extended Data Fig. 9), in each 
pair of sessions (no laser, laser) we calculated the difference in mean lick rate between the 
two in order to obtain a statistical measure of the “effect of laser” per session pair. Next, we 
compared the effects of laser from the ChR2 or eNpHR groups versus the corresponding

 effect of laser in the eYFP group. To correct for the double comparison (ChR2 or eNpHR 
versus eYFP), we again performed a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. 
Considering this, for optogenetics experiments all p-values (which are two-tailed throughout 
the manuscript) have been corrected for multiple comparisons.
Retrograde tracing
The anatomy and electrophysiological properties of PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons were 
evaluated through retrograde tracing36. Specifically, during surgeries the retrograde tracer 
cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to Alexa Fluor (CtB-488, CtB-594; Molecular Probes) 
was injected bilaterally into NAc (500nl/side) and on the midline in PVT (300nl; color 
counterbalanced across mice). Ten days following surgery, animals were sacrificed for 
histology (n=3 mice) or slice electrophysiology (n=3 mice). For anatomical experiments, a 
student blind to all experiments (E.P.M.) and conditions counted the number of CtB-488 
positive, CtB-594 positive, and double-positive neurons in prelimbic medial prefrontal 
cortex (a subregion of dorsal medial PFC). The distance of each cell from the midline and 
the layer specificity of each cell were then measured using ImageJ. For electrophysiological 
experiments, mice were euthanized ten days following surgeries for patch-clamp recordings 
ex vivo (see below for details).
Rabies tracing
The monosynaptic afferents to PFC-NAc and PFC-PVT neurons were identified using a 
glycoprotein-deleted rabies strategy37 in combination with Cav2-cre targeting of projection-
specific neuron populations. Specifically, during the first surgery a cocktail containing the 
cre-dependent starter viruses encoding the G-protein and TVA were injected into PFC (3:1 
of AAV5-FLEX-RG and AAV5-FLEX-TVA-mCherry; 300nl/side), and Cav2-cre was 
injected into either NAc (500nl/side) or PVT (300nl). Five weeks later, mice were given a 
second surgery in which the G-deleted rabies virus was injected into PFC (1:5 diluted EnvA-
Rabies-GFP). Finally, 8 days after the rabies injection each mouse (n=3/group) was 
sacrificed for histology and cell quantification. Our rabies protocol led to sparse labeling of 
PFC projection neurons, allowing quantification of individual cells in each brain section 
(40µm thick). Each ROI was selected based on previous PFC tracing experiments38, as well 
as the fluorescence intensity observed in our experiments. Next, out of all tissue collected 
for each ROI in each mouse, we selected the 3 sections containing the most cells per region, 
and used confocal microscopy to get cellular-resolution images of all cells in each of those 
sections. For each section, we quantified all individual input neurons (GFP+) and starter 
cells (both GFP+ and mCherry+). Considering that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was 
close to the PFC injection site, some sections containing ACC also had starter cell labeling. 
Thus, because we were interested in long-range inputs from ACC only, only sections that did 
not have mCherry labeling were used for ACC input quantification. Finally, rabies-tracing 
data were analyzed by comparing the number of cells in each section across groups (raw 
neuron count), and by comparing the percentage of input neurons per starter cell for each 
particular mouse.

 Patch-clamp electrophysiology
Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50mg/kg) before transcardial perfusion with ice-
cold sucrose cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 225 sucrose, 119 NaCl, 1.0 
NaH2P04, 4.9 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1.25 glucose, 305 mOsm. Brains were then 
rapidly removed, and coronal sections 300µm thick were taken using a vibratome (Leica, VT 
1200). Sections were then incubated in aCSF (32°C) containing the following (in mM): 119 
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 NaH2P04, 1.3 MgCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 26.2 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, ~306 mOsm. 
After an hour of recovery, slices were constantly perfused with aCSF (32°C) and visualized 
using differential interference contrast through a 40× water-immersion objective mounted on 
an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI). Whole-cell recordings were obtained using 
borosilicate pipettes (3–5 ΜΩ) back-filled with internal solution containing the following (in 
mM): 130 K gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 2 ATP, 0.2 GTP (pH 7.35, 
270–285 mOsm).
Current-clamp recordings were obtained from GCaMP6s-expressing neurons to identify how 
action potential frequency correlated with GCaMP6s fluorescence. Specifically, to determine 
how elevations in action potential frequency influence GCaMP6s fluorescence, a 1 second 
train of depolarizing pulses (2nA, 2ms) was applied at a frequency of 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20Hz. 
To determine how attenuations in action potential frequency influence GCaMP6s 
fluorescence, a 3 second pause was applied after a 10 second baseline train of depolarizing 
pulses (2nA, 2ms; 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20Hz). Finally, to determine if hyperpolarization influences 
GCaMP6s fluorescence in the absence of action potential frequency modulation, a 3 second 
hyperpolarizing step (150pA) was applied in neurons that were held either below or above 
resting membrane potential. During electrophysiological recordings, GCaMP6s fluorescence 
dynamics were visualized using a mercury lamp (Olympus, U-RFL-T) and microscope-
mounted camera (QImaging, optiMOS). Imaging data were acquired using Micro-Manager, 
and extracted through hand-drawn ROIs for each recorded neuron using ImageJ.
Current-clamp recordings were also obtained to identify the intrinsic properties of PFC-NAc 
and PFC-PVT neurons in retrograde tracing experiments, as previously described39. First, 
action potential firing was examined by applying a series of long depolarizing sweeps 
(800ms) at +25pA steps (0–450pA). Next, rheobase (the minimum amount of current 
required for an action potential to fire) was measured by applying a series of short 
depolarizing sweeps (50ms) at +10pA steps (starting at 0pA) until the recorded neuron fired 
an action potential. For all patch-clamp experiments, data acquisition occurred at 1 kHz 
sampling rate through a MultiClamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A digitizer 
(Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices).
Data Collection
The nature of all imaging and behavioral experiments yields high-power data sets, as we can 
test responses to reward-predictive cues hundreds of times within a single session. Thus, 
although the experiments themselves require rigorous experimentation, the number of mice 
that are required for each experiment is generally 3–6 per group, depending on the effect 
size (which was not predetermined for these experiments). Mice were randomly picked for 
each group in each experiment, by alternating the surgery for each mouse in a cage. During

 data collection, investigators were only blind to the conditions for rabies tracing cell 
counting and CtB cell counting. The only mice excluded from final analysis were those that 
died before or during the experiments (n=3). For optogenetics experiments, mice were 
excluded if histology confirmed ectopic virus expression outside of PFC (n=1), or if cannula 
placements were not in dorsomedial PFC (n=0). For data analysis, equal variance was not 
assumed for behavioral optogenetics or imaging datasets. Equal variance was deemed 
equivalent and was therefore not assumed for cell counting experiments and 
electrophysiological experiments.

data showing example excitatory (j) or inhibitory (k) responses from example neurons 
during cue delivery after learning. l, Population data of all neurons showing few excitatory 
(red) or inhibitory (blue) cue responses (p<0.05 after correction; see Methods) to the CS+ 
and CS− during early sessions (CS+ versus CS−: χ2(2)=9.06, p=0.01). m, Population data

 Figure 3. PFC projection neurons show distinct functional plasticity across learning
a, Representative images show the same PFC-NAc::GCaMP6s neurons tracked from early 
(left) to late (right) sessions (n=37 neurons; n=4 mice). b, Traces from individual example 
neurons averaged across trials during early (left) and late (right) sessions. c, Cue responses 
of PFC-NAc::GCaMP6s neurons during early conditioning sessions could be used to predict 
responses during late conditioning sessions (CS+, r=0.73, p<0.001; CS−, r=0.70, p<0.001).

GCaMP6s fluorescence to the CS+ across learning, and reduced (white) GCaMP6s 
fluorescence to the CS− across learning (χ2(1)=8.07; p<0.005). d, Representative images 
show the same PFC-PVT::GCaMP6s neurons tracked from early (left) to late (right) sessions 
(n=61 neurons; n=3 mice). e, Traces from individual example neurons averaged across trials 
during early (left) and late (right) sessions. f, Cue responses of all PFC-PVT::GCaMP6s 
neurons during early Pavlovian conditioning sessions could not be used to predict 
subsequent responses during late conditioning sessions (CS+, r=0.08, p>0.05; CS−, r=0.24, 
p>0.05). f,inset, Bar graphs showing that most PFC-PVT::GCaMP6s neurons showed 
reduced (white) GCaMP6s fluorescence to the CS+ across learning, whereas equivalent 
numbers of neurons showed elevated (gray) and reduced (white) GCaMP6s fluorescence to 
the CS− across learning (χ2(1)=6.73, p<0.01). Vertical dotted lines refer to timing of sucrose
