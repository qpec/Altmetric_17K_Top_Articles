IMPORTANCE A key factor in assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a prevention strategy is the absolute risk of HIV transmission
through condomless sex with suppressed HIV-1 RNA viral load for both anal and vaginal sex.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the rate of within-couple HIV transmission (heterosexual and men
who have sex with men [MSM]) during periods of sex without condoms and when the
HIV-positive partner had HIV-1 RNA load less than 200 copies/mL.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The prospective, observational PARTNER (Partners of
People on ART—A New Evaluation of the Risks) study was conducted at 75 clinical sites in 14
European countries and enrolled 1166 HIV serodifferent couples (HIV-positive partner taking
suppressive ART) who reported condomless sex (September 2010 to May 2014). Eligibility
criteria for inclusion of couple-years of follow-up were condomless sex and HIV-1 RNA load
less than 200 copies/mL. Anonymized phylogenetic analysis compared couples’HIV-1
polymerase and envelope sequences if an HIV-negative partner became infected to
determine phylogenetically linked transmissions.
EXPOSURES Condomless sexual activity with an HIV-positive partner taking virally
suppressive ART.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of within-couple HIV transmission to the
HIV-negative partner
RESULTS Among 1166 enrolled couples, 888 (mean age, 42 years [IQR, 35-48]; 548
heterosexual [61.7%] and 340 MSM [38.3%]) provided 1238 eligible couple-years of
follow-up (median follow-up, 1.3 years [IQR, 0.8-2.0]). At baseline, couples reported
condomless sex for a median of 2 years (IQR, 0.5-6.3). Condomless sex with other partners
was reported by 108 HIV-negative MSM (33%) and 21 heterosexuals (4%). During follow-up,
couples reported condomless sex a median of 37 times per year (IQR, 15-71), with MSM
couples reporting approximately 22 000 condomless sex acts and heterosexuals
approximately 36 000. Although 11 HIV-negative partners became HIV-positive (10 MSM; 1
heterosexual; 8 reported condomless sex with other partners), no phylogenetically linked
transmissions occurred over eligible couple-years of follow-up, giving a rate of within-couple
HIV transmission of zero, with an upper 95% confidence limit of 0.30/100 couple-years of
follow-up. The upper 95% confidence limit for condomless anal sex was 0.71 per 100
couple-years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among serodifferent heterosexual and MSM couples in which
the HIV-positive partner was using suppressive ART and who reported condomless sex, during
median follow-up of 1.3 years per couple, there were no documented cases of within-couple
HIV transmission (upper 95% confidence limit, 0.30/100 couple-years of follow-up). Additional
longer-term follow-up is necessary to provide more precise estimates of risk.

S
everal studies have demonstrated that HIV-positive
people taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) who have low
plasma HIV-1 RNA load have markedly reduced infec-
tiousness for sexual transmission.1-4 In particular, the HPTN
052 study, conducted primarily in heterosexual serodifferent
couples, demonstrated a 96% reduction in HIV transmission
risk in HIV-positive adults randomized to early ART initiation
compared with the group that deferred treatment.4 As a re-
sult, World Health Organization guidelines now recommend
that ART should be offered to all HIV-positive people, irre-
spective of CD4 cell count, to reduce risk of transmission.5
There are, however, a number of gaps in currently avail-
able evidence. The most significant issue is that no data are
available concerning transmission rates for anal sex when
the HIV-positive partner is taking suppressive ART, even
though per-act estimates of HIV transmissibility without ART
are approximately 10 times higher for anal intercourse6-9 com-
pared with vaginal sex.10 In addition, in all the transmission
studies in heterosexual couples published to date, including
HPTN 052, most of the observed couple-years of follow-up
have been in the context of reported consistent condom use
(up to 93%),2-4,11-13 which also effectively prevents HIV
transmission.14,15 Study results therefore demonstrate the
added benefit of ART in addition to the use of condoms, not
just from use of ART alone. Condomless sex (sexual activity
in which condoms are not used) was reported for only 330
couple-years of follow-up across all previous studies
combined,2-4,11-13 which is insufficient follow-up to give pre-
cise estimates for transmission in the context of ART alone
when condoms are not used.14 The absolute risk of sexual HIV
transmission from condomless sex for a person taking stable
suppressive ART therefore remains uncertain.
The primary aim of the PARTNER (Partners of People on
ART—A New Evaluation of the Risks) study was to follow se-
rodifferent partnerships that have penetrative sex without
using condoms in which the HIV-positive partner is taking ART
withaplasmaHIV-1RNAloadlessthan200copies/mL,tostudy
risk of HIV transmission through anal and vaginal sex in the
absence of condom use.
Methods
Study Design
The PARTNER study was an observational multicenter study
of serodifferent couples, heterosexual and men who have sex
with men (MSM), in which the HIV-positive partner is taking
ART. The methods for the PARTNER study have been
published.16
Ethics Approvals
Prior to the initiation of the study at each clinical research site,
the protocol, all informed consent forms, and the participant
information materials were submitted to and approved by the
site’
s ethics committee (institutional review board or institu-
tionalethicscommittee).IntheUnitedKingdom,thestudywas
reviewed and approved by the North West London REC 2 eth-
ics committee (EC reference number 10/H0720/55). Ethics ap-
proval was obtained in-country for all other European sites in-
volved in the study. In addition, any amendments to the study
protocol were submitted and approved by each site’
s ethics
committee (institutional review board or ethics committee).
Study Population and Eligibility Criteria
From September 2010, we recruited serodifferent couples
from 75 clinical sites in 14 European countries. HIV-positive
people taking ART and older than 18 years were eligible to
take part with their HIV-negative partners. The HIV-positive
partner was expected to continue taking ART, and the part-
nership met the following criteria: (1) the partners reported
penetrative sex without using condoms (condomless sex)
together in the month before enrollment (during which
period the HIV-negative partner was aware of the HIV status
of the HIV-positive partner) and (2) the partners expected to
have sex together again in the coming months.
Study Procedures
Participating clinics asked HIV-positive patients taking ART
about condomless sex with HIV-negative partners and if they
wished to take part in an HIV transmission study. If both the
positive and the negative partners agreed to take part, they
signed separate informed consents, which included partner
identification by name. The informed consent also included
explicit reference to the fact that HIV-negative partners knew
their partner was HIV-positive and that there was a transmis-
sion risk from condomless sex. Clinic staff were asked to rec-
ommend consistent condom use at each study contact.
Follow-up was stopped if the partnership ended, the part-
ners moved away, or either person in the partnership with-
drew consent, but not for changes in sexual behavior or use
ofART(althoughsuchchangescouldleadtothefollow-uptime
not being eligible for the main analysis). Follow-up in hetero-
sexual couples ended on May 31, 2014, and remains ongoing
forMSMcouples.Follow-upinthisreportwascensoredonMay

Data Collection
Study data were collected on standardized case report forms
after consent at baseline and then every 4 to 6 months. De-
tailed information was collected on sociodemographics (in-

Key Points
Question What is the risk of HIV transmission though condomless
sex from an HIV-positive person taking suppressive ART?
Findings In this observational study in HIV-serodifferent
heterosexual and MSM couples having ongoing condomless sex
over 1238 couple-years of follow-up, there were no cases of
within-couple HIV transmission (upper 95% confidence limit of
0.30/100 couple-years of follow-up).
Meaning This study provides estimates of the risk of HIV
transmission though condomless anal and vaginal sex with use of
suppressive ART.

categories defined by the investigators] to consider a pos-
sibleassociationbetweenrace/ethnicityandtransmissionrate);
self-reported adherence to ART, rated from 0% to 100% over
the previous month (positive partner); sexual activity be-
tween the partners (since last visit), frequency of inter-
course, type of intercourse (receptive or insertive; vaginal or
anal) and whether ejaculation occurred; sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) and the presence of symptoms suggestive of
an STI; and use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or postex-
posure prophylaxis (PEP). Injection drug use was assessed and
if needles, syringes, or any part of injection equipment was
shared.
HIV-negative partners were also asked if they had had con-
domless sex with anyone other than their HIV-positive part-
ner since their last visit, the number of other partners, and if
any were HIV-positive or of unknown serostatus. For the HIV-
positive partner, data on ART, CD4 cell count, and current and
recent plasma HIV-1 RNA load were recorded through a clini-
cal case report form.
Laboratory Testing and Phylogenetic Analysis
The HIV-negative partner was asked to test for evidence of HIV
seroconversion every 6 to 12 months. Where possible, a com-
bined antigen/antibody test was used to increase diagnostic
sensitivity in early infection. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was mea-
sured in the HIV-positive partner according to routine care ev-
ery 6 to 12 months; testing was undertaken at the local diag-
nostic laboratory. If at any time the HIV-negative partner was
found to have become HIV-positive, a venous blood sample in
EDTA was taken from both partners to determine genetic re-
latedness of HIV-1 pol and env sequences.
Details of the methodology used for sequencing and
analysis are reported in the Supplement. Briefly, following
Sanger sequencing of either plasma HIV-1 RNA or cellular
HIV-1 DNA,17 maximum-likelihood and Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inferences, as implemented in
RAxML-HCP2 v8 and MrBayes v3.2.6, respectively, were
determined as previously described.18 Controls comprised
the 10 closest sequences identified through BLAST searches
of GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Replicate
partners’sequences (obtained from different sampling points,
differentspecimentypes,orrepeattestingofthesamesample),

methodology.19,20 Sequences showing a genetic distance of

Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was estimation of the rate of transmis-
sion, calculated as the number of HIV infections that oc-
curred during eligible couple-years of follow-up (see defini-
tion below) divided by eligible couple-years of follow-up,
excludinginfectionsshowntobephylogeneticallydistinctfrom
the index patient’
s virus (ie, transmission has not been from
the original HIV-positive index partner). Couple-years of
follow-up were determined as periods delimited by HIV tests,
and corresponding questionnaires on sexual behavior, in the
HIV-negative partner. These were eligible for inclusion in this
analysis if (1) couples had condomless sex during the period
(reported at the end of the period by the HIV-negative partner
or,ifthispartnerdidnotreply,bythepositivepartner);(2)there
was no report of PrEP or PEP use; (3) latest plasma HIV-1 RNA
load in the positive partner was less than 200 copies/mL and
not dated older than 12 months; and (4) follow-up occurred be-
fore May 31, 2014 (ie, the censoring date).
A sensitivity analysis included periods of follow-up time
in which the HIV-RNA load was suppressed at the beginning
of the period but during which the load became elevated. This
allows inclusion of periods during which a couple may con-
tinuehavingcondomlesssexuntiltheyknowtheHIVRNAload
is elevated. Exact Poisson methods were used to calculate con-
fidence intervals for the incidence rate of transmission.
The rate of within-couple transmission was calculated re-
stricting to couple-years of follow-up during which a certain
type of sex (eg, receptive anal sex with ejaculation) was re-
ported (note that it was not required that this was the only type
of sex the couple was having). However, in sensitivity analy-
sis the rate and confidence interval were calculated taking a
hierarchical approach to classifying transmission risk with
types of sex. Having defined such a hierarchy of risk, in refer-
ring to a specific sex act, the upper limit of the rate was esti-
mated if this type of sex was the highest-risk sex being per-
formed. The hierarchy (from highest to lowest risk) was
receptive anal sex with ejaculation, receptive anal sex with-
outejaculation,insertiveanalsex,vaginalsexwithejaculation,
and vaginal sex without ejaculation.
To assess whether there were differences in the character-
istics among HIV-negative and HIV-positive people across the
different groups (heterosexual men, heterosexual women, and
MSM), the 2-sided Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continuous
variables and 2-sided χ2 tests for categorical variables.
P < .05 was used as the threshold of statistical signifi-
cance. Missing data were not imputed, and the analysis was
performedonlyontheavailabledata.Datawereanalyzedusing
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Sample Size Calculation
In planning the sample size it was known that the transmis-
sion rate was low,3 and the aim was to generate a more pre-
cise estimate of the rate than was available. The sample size
was based on a hypothesized transmission rate of 1 per 1000
couple-years of condomless sex, with the choice of this very
low rate based on arguments laid out in the Swiss
Statement.21 Under this hypothesis, 2000 couple-years of
follow-up were required to have an 85% chance that the
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the transmis-
sion rate is less than 0.44 per 100 couple-years of follow-up
(0.2 per 100 couple-years of follow-up, with a transmission
rate of zero). The executive committee stopped follow-up of

concentrate resources on MSM couples. Phase 2 with MSM

Eligible Couple-Years of Follow-up Accrued
From the 1166 couples enrolled by May 31, 2014, a total of
1004coupleshadatleast1follow-upvisitbythecensoringdate
and 888 couples (548 heterosexual and 340 MSM) contrib-
uted 1238 eligible couple-years of follow-up; 1251 when in-
cluding periods of follow-up time in which the HIV-RNA load
wassuppressedatthebeginningoftheperiodbutduringwhich
the load became elevated. The main reasons for couples pro-
viding no eligible couple-years of follow-up (n = 116) among
thosewithatleast1follow-upvisitwerenoHIVtestinthenega-
tive partner (n = 20), use of PEP/PrEP (n = 9), no condomless
sex reported (n = 15), plasma HIV-1 RNA load greater than
200 copies/mL (n = 55), and plasma measurement not avail-
able (n = 17). Participants who contributed eligible couple-
years of follow-up (compared with those who did not) were
slightly older, more likely to have undertaken vocational edu-
cation (among heterosexual participants), more likely to have
reported sex with other men rather than “other” as HIV ac-
quisitionroute(amongMSM),hadbeenhavingcondomlesssex
for longer (among MSM), and more likely to have a CD4 cell
countgreaterthan350/mm3(amongheterosexuals)(seeeTable

(interquartilerange[IQR],0.8-2.0).Theestimateddropoutrate
was 18 per 100 couple-years of follow-up when considering all
the couples enrolled (n = 1166) and 11 per 100 couple-years of

broke up (n = 69 [41%]), moved away (n = 15 [9%]), consent
withdrawn/did not want to continue (n = 18 [11%]), and other/
not clear (n = 65 [39%]). Among couples contributing eligible
couple-years of follow-up, 340 were MSM, 269 heterosexual
in which the male partner was HIV-positive (male positive/
female negative) and 279 heterosexual in which the female
partnerwasHIV-positive(malenegative/femalepositive).Over-
all, 94% of the eligible couple-years of follow-up were during
periods of very low plasma HIV-1 RNA load (<50 copies/mL);
the other 6% were during periods with HIV-1 RNA loads be-
tween 50 and 200 copies/mL.
Baseline Couple Characteristics
Characteristics at baseline of the participants who contrib-
utedtoeligiblecouple-yearsoffollow-uparereportedinTable1.
Median age was 40 to 45 years in all participant groups. HIV-
negativeMSMreportedhavingcondomlesssexwiththeirposi-
tive partners for a median 1.4 years (IQR, 0.5-3.5 years) prior
toenrollment.Forheterosexualcouplesthiswas2.8years(IQR,
0.6-7.5 years) for male-negative/female-positive couples and
3.6 years (IQR, 0.7-11.4 years) for male-positive/female-
negative couples.
At baseline, HIV-positive partners had been taking ART a
median of 7.5 years (IQR, 3.3-14.2 years) among heterosexual
women, 10.6 years (IQR, 4.3-15.6 years) among heterosexual
men, and 4.8 years (IQR, 1.9-11.4 years) among MSM. Self-
reported adherence with taking ART was high across all HIV-
positive groups, with 93% of heterosexual men, 94% of het-
erosexualwomen,and97%ofMSMreportinggreaterthan90%
adherence to ART and very few reporting they missed taking
ART for more than 4 consecutive days, although this was more
common in heterosexual participants (6% men, 8% women)
than in MSM (3%). MSM were also more likely to correctly self-
report a suppressed HIV load (94% of MSM, compared with
84% of heterosexual men and 87% of heterosexual women).
The majority in all groups had CD4 cell count greater than 350
mm3 at baseline.
Follow-up Clinical and Behavioral Data
During prospective follow-up, 17% of HIV-negative MSM and
18%ofHIV-positiveMSMreportedbeingdiagnosedwithanSTI
at some point; among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive het-
erosexual men and women, 6% reported being diagnosed with
an STI (Table 2).
Thirty-three percent (n = 108) of HIV-negative MSM and
4% of HIV-negative heterosexual men (n = 11) and women
(n = 10)reportedcondomlesssexwithotherpartners.Veryfew
HIV-negative partners reported injecting drugs during
follow-up (3% [n = 10] MSM, 2% [n = 5] heterosexual men, and
1% [n = 2] heterosexual women).
Couples reported frequent condomless sex during follow-
up, as illustrated by the number of condomless sex acts re-
ported during follow-up (Table 3). The median number of con-
domless sex acts per year within the partnership reported by
the HIV-negative partner were similar across all groups dur-
ing eligible couple-years of follow-up, with MSM reporting a
median of 42 condomless acts per year (IQR, 18-75) com-
pared with 35 (IQR, 14-68) for heterosexual men and 36 (IQR,
13-71) for heterosexual women. Overall, all groups reported
large numbers of condomless sex acts during follow-up, with
morethan22 000condomlesssexactsamongMSMand36 000
among heterosexual couples.
Data on prevalence of the type of condomless penetra-
tive sex (with the HIV-positive partner) reported by the HIV-
negative partner are shown in Figure 1. By definition, couples
contributing eligible couple-years of follow-up reported con-
domless penetrative sex at some point during follow-up.
Among heterosexual couples, 99% reported vaginal sex with
or without ejaculation and 11.1% reported anal sex. For MSM,
67% of negative partners had receptive anal sex without
ejaculation, 45% had receptive anal sex with their partner
ejaculating inside them, and 92% reported insertive anal sex.
The main reasons reported by HIV-negative partners for
not using a condom were a belief that the risk of HIV trans-
mission was very low (57% heterosexual men, 52% hetero-
sexual women, 63% MSM) and that sex was more enjoyable

became infected, 10 were MSM and 1 was heterosexual; of
these, 8 (73%) reported that they had had recent condomless
sex with others apart from their study partner.
Viral sequences were recovered successfully from all
couples, comprising 22 of 22 individuals (100%) for pol and 20
of 22 individuals (91%) for env. Samples collected from the 2
partners of each couple were a median of 0 months apart (IQR,
0.0-5.9). The partners who were initially HIV-positive had sub-
type B infection in all cases. The partners who seroconverted
during the study acquired subtype B infection in 9 of 11 cases;
1 person (couple 5) acquired subtype A1, and a second person
(couple 6) acquired CRF14_BG (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
In the phylogenetic analyses, none of the partners’ se-
quences clustered together, with consistent results observed
acrossanalyses(Figure2;eFigure1andeFigure2intheSupple-
ment). The partners’sequences showed pairwise genetic dis-
tances consistently greater than 0.040. With couple number
7, the pairwise genetic distances of pol sequences were 0.043

c Participants who reported an STI since last visit were asked whether it was
syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, acute genital herpes, chronic genital herpes,
lymphogranuloma venereum, bacterial vaginosis, or other. None reported
being diagnosed with acute genital herpes or syphilis. The following
STIs did not have a frequency above 5 and so were grouped together
as “
Other STI”: chlamydia, chronic genital herpes, lymphogranuloma
venereum, bacterial vaginosis, and “
other.”Participants who replied “yes”to
the question “Since your last visit, have you had a STI”but did not reply to the
question “If yes, which STI?”were categorized as “not specified.”
dNever replied to this question during follow-up.
e Only people that reported condomless sex with other partners were asked this
question. For this variable “missing”is treated as “no,”and the denominator
used to calculate the percentages is the number of participants who reported
whether they had “[condomless] sex with other partners.”
f Only sex acts within couples are included.
g The denominator is the total group-specific eligible couple-years of follow-up.

and 0.040 for different sample types; however, there was no
phylogenetic evidence of linked clustering (Figure 2; eFigure
1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Positive control se-
quences showed median genetic distances of 0.004 (IQR,
<0.001-0.008) (eTable 2 in the Supplement) and were closely
linked on monophyletic branches with bootstrap values 0.98
or greater and posterior probabilities of 1.00.
Given that there were no linked transmissions (even when
considering periods during which the HIV-RNA load became
elevated [representing a total of 13 couple-years of follow-up]),
the estimated rate for transmission through any condomless
sexwiththeHIV-positivepartnertakingARTwithHIVloadless

limit of 0.30 per 100 couple-years of follow-up (0.29 when in-

confidence limit was 0.97 per 100 couple-years of follow-up
for male-positive/female-negative couples, and 0.88 per
couple-years for female-positive/male-negative couples. In
MSM the upper confidence limit for all sex was 0.84 per 100
couple-years of follow-up. For anal sex, the upper 95% confi-
dence limit was 0.71 per 100 couple-years of follow-up (het-
erosexual and MSM data combined), and for receptive anal sex
with ejaculation it was 2.23 per 100 couple-years of follow-up
(heterosexual and MSM data combined) and 2.70 per 100
couple-years of follow-up (MSM only). The upper limit of the
95% CI was higher for anal sex owing to the lower number of
couple-years of follow-up accrued to date.
When considering a hierarchical approach (ie, the act-
specific rates were restricted to couple-years of follow-up in
which that type of act was the highest-risk type of sex re-
ported), the upper 95% confidence limit was higher: for re-
ceptive anal sex without ejaculation, the upper limit in-
creased from 8.14 to 11.95 per 100 couple-years of follow-up
for heterosexual women and from 1.68 to 3.06 per 100 couple-
years of follow-up for MSM; for vaginal sex, the upper limit in-
creased from 0.59 to 0.69 per 100 couple-years of follow-up
(heterosexual men and women combined) (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). A table detailing the rates and upper 95% con-
fidence limits using this approach has been included in the

3 nonlinked HIV-1 infections occurred among partners report-
ing condomless sex with other partners.
Discussion
This study provides the first estimate to our knowledge of HIV
transmission risk through condomless anal sex in which the
HIV-positivepartneristakingARTwithsuppressedplasmaHIV
viral load and also provides an estimate of the absolute rate
ofHIVtransmissionthroughcondomlessheterosexualsex.The
estimate of the overall transmission rate, and the transmis-
sion rate for anal sex, was zero. However, 95% confidence lim-
its suggest that with eligible couple-years accrued so far, ap-
preciablelevelsofriskcannotbeexcluded,particularlyforanal
sex and when considered from the perspective of a cumula-
tive risk over several years.
Only couples that continued to have condomless sex were
included in this study, to enable focus on situations in which
transmission risk without ART is highest. This contrasts with
other transmission studies, including HPTN 052, in which re-
ported condom use was high (93%)4 and the low absolute rate
of transmission in the ART group reflects both ART and con-
dom use, thus assessing 2 prevention strategies in combina-
tion, not just ART alone. It is important to know how low
the risk of transmission was with the use of ART alone without
simultaneous use of condoms, and this study contains more
than 3 times the couple-years of follow-up for condomless
sexthanalltheotherpreviousstudiescombined,includingmore
than 500 couple-years of follow-up of condomless anal sex.14
BothMSMandheterosexualcouplesinthisstudyreportedregu-
larly having sex without a condom during follow-up. Based on
the number and type of sex acts and the cumulative probabil-
ity of HIV transmission, more than 100 transmissions would
have been expected in the MSM group alone (see Supplement)
if the HIV-positive partner had not been taking ART.10
Although these results cannot directly provide an answer
to the question of whether it is safe for serodifferent couples
to practice condomless sex, this study provides informative
data(especiallyforheterosexuals)forcouplestobasetheirper-
sonal acceptability of risk on. In the absence of ART, recep-
tive anal sex with ejaculation is recognized as carrying a higher
risk than other forms and, despite an observed transmission
rate of zero for this risk behavior, a clinically important rate
of less than 2.2 per 100 couple-years of follow-up cannot be
excluded. This translates into an upper limit estimate of 20%
risk over 10 years. Because the upper limit of the 95% confi-
dence interval is a function of the amount of couple-years of
follow-up for that sexual act, additional follow-up in MSM is
therefore needed through the second phase of the PARTNER
study(PARTNER2)toprovidemorepreciseestimatesfortrans-
mission risk in MSM in the context of ART. These data are
needed to provide equality of evidence between MSM and het-
erosexual couples, to inform both policy and also individual
choice on condom use.
AlthoughnolinkedHIVtransmissionswithincoupleswere
detected, 11 unlinked HIV transmissions occurred during eli-
gible follow-up. One-third of HIV-negative MSM in this study
reported having condomless sex concurrently with other part-
ners outside the main relationship. A high prevalence of sexual
concurrency and in particular concurrent condomless anal sex
has been reported in other studies in MSM.22,23 Related to this,
HIV-negative MSM were also relatively commonly diagnosed
with an STI. Acquisition of an STI was not associated with risk
of HIV-1 transmission within the couples under study, al-
though power was limited to exclude a possible true effect.
This study has several limitations. The original design
aimedtoobserve2000couple-yearsoffollow-up,butonly1238
couple-years were eligible for the primary analysis. Because
the primary analysis involves the estimation of a rate with a
95% confidence interval, this does not substantially affect the
interpretation. In addition, although there was a moderate de-
gree of dropout of study participants, the reasons for dropout
do not suggest that those who dropped out would have expe-
rienced a higher transmission rate while virally suppressed
when taking ART. The follow-up time was relatively short, al-
though at study entry couples reported having condomless sex
with their current partner for several months to years. Direct
evidence that some individuals are particularly susceptible to
early acquisition of HIV infection is currently lacking, but it re-
mains possible that the transmission rate is higher in the ini-
tial period of condomless sex between a couple. Moreover, al-
though the transmission rate was also zero in the 23% of
couples in the study in which the partnership was relatively
recent (< 6 months), the risk of HIV transmission in very new
partnerships could not be determined.
Conclusions
Among serodifferent heterosexual and MSM couples in which
the HIV-positive partner was using suppressive ART and who
reported condomless sex, during median follow-up of 1.3 years
per couple, there were no documented cases of within-
coupleHIVtransmission(upper95%confidencelimit,0.30/100
couple-years of follow-up). Additional longer-term follow-up
is necessary to provide more precise estimates of risk.
