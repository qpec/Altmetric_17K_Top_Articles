Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogenic flavivirus currently circulating in numerous countries in South America, the Carib-
bean, and the Western Pacific Region. Using an unbiased metagenomic sequencing approach, we report here the first complete
genome sequence of ZIKV isolated from a clinical semen sample.

S
ince October 2013, an outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has af-
fected 68 countries across South America, the Caribbean, and
the Western Pacific Region (1). Nearly half a million confirmed
and suspected cases have been reported; while transmission to
humans typically occurs via the bite of an infected mosquito, 11
countries have reported cases of non-mosquito-borne transmis-
sion (1, 2). ZIKV RNA has been identified in semen from infected
males, including detection at more than two months post onset of
symptoms (3–5). However, to date, no ZIKV sequence greater
than 300 bases long from semen has been made publically avail-
able.
A diagnostic semen sample provided 13 days post onset of
symptoms from a patient returning from Guadeloupe was identi-
fied as positive for ZIKV RNA with a high copy number. ZIKV was
isolated from the clinical semen sample in the C6/36 cell line.
Isolation was not successful directly in the Vero cell line; however,
infected C6/36 supernatant did propagate in Vero cells and pro-
duced cytopathic effect. Supernatant was removed for metag-
enomic analysis on days 5 and 7 in C6/36 cells and on day 3 in Vero
cells. Eighty microliters of supernatant was inactivated in 320 �l of
AVL buffer (Qiagen) and purified using the EZ1 virus minikit
version 2.0 (Qiagen).
RNA extracts were DNase digested and purified as described
previously (6). cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the
method of Greninger et al. (7), with the amendment that an alter-
native polymerase was used in round B (35 �l of water, 5 �l of 10�
reaction mixture, 1 �l of 100 �M primer B, 1 �l of dimethyl
sulfoxide [DMSO], 2.5 �l of 12.5 mM dinucleoside triphosphate
[dNTP], 0.5 �l of Sigma Aldrich AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase,
and 5 �l of round A-labelled cDNA). The reaction conditions
were 98°C for 30 s; 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 20 s, and
68°C for 5 min; and 68°C for 10 min. cDNA (1.5 ng) was prepared
for sequencing, according to the Illumina Nextera XT protocol,
and the 2 � 150-bp paired-end library run on an MiSeq (Illu-
mina).
Reads were quality trimmed to a minimum score of Q30 across
the read. BWA version 0.7.5 (8) was used to map 913,794 reads
from the day 3 Vero sample to the ZIKV PF13/251013-18 genome
(GenBank accession no. KX369547), of which 2.4% mapped to
the reference, giving 99.3% genome coverage at a minimum depth
of 5�, from which a consensus genome sequence was produced.
All analyses were performed using a local instance of the Galaxy
Project (9–11). Significant genome coverage was also achieved for
C6/36 samples, although only 77% of bases had a depth of five
reads or greater; all callable bases were homologous to Vero data.
Sequence data for the virus isolated from a clinical semen sam-
ple align well with other sequences of ZIKV from the outbreak,
including those from the Caribbean region, where the patient ac-
quired the infection. The characterization of ZIKV isolated from
semen samples will help improve our understanding of possible
viral polymorphisms resulting from infection in different cellular
environments. The isolated virus will be available imminently
from the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (12) and the
European Virus Archive (13).
Accession number(s). The complete genomic sequence has
been deposited in GenBank under accession no. KX673530.
