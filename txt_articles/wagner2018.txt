Spinal cord injury leads to severe locomotor deficits or even complete leg paralysis. Here we introduce targeted spinal 
cord stimulation neurotechnologies that enabled voluntary control of walking in individuals who had sustained a spinal 
cord injury more than four years ago and presented with permanent motor deficits or complete paralysis despite extensive 
rehabilitation. Using an implanted pulse generator with real-time triggering capabilities, we delivered trains of spatially 
selective stimulation to the lumbosacral spinal cord with timing that coincided with the intended movement. Within 
one week, this spatiotemporal stimulation had re-established adaptive control of paralysed muscles during overground 
walking. Locomotor performance improved during rehabilitation. After a few months, participants regained voluntary 
control over previously paralysed muscles without stimulation and could walk or cycle in ecological settings during 
spatiotemporal stimulation. These results establish a technological framework for improving neurological recovery and 
supporting the activities of daily living after spinal cord injury.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts communication within the nervous 
system, leading to the loss of essential neurological functions. At pres-
ent, activity-based therapies are the only medical practices that can be 
used to enhance recovery1–3. The volitional production of active move-
ments during training promotes reorganization of neuronal pathways 
and thereby augments recovery4,5. However, the most affected patients, 
who fail to produce active movements voluntarily, experience minimal 
benefits from these therapies1.
This situation has prompted the development of multifaceted 
 
neurotechnologies6, such as lower limb exoskeletons, bodyweight support 
 
systems, functional electrical stimulation of muscles, and spinal cord 
neuromodulation therapies, all of which share the same goal: to enable 
 
patients to sustain active movements during training to enhance the 
reorganization of neuronal pathways4. Three decades of clinical research 
using these neurotechnologies suggested that epidural electrical 
 
stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord may be pivotal to achieve this 
goal7–10. EES not only enables the brain to exploit spared but func-
tionally silent descending pathways in order to produce movements 
of paralysed limbs11,12, but also improves the ability of the spinal cord 
to translate task-specific sensory information into the muscle activity 
that underlies standing and walking9,10,12–16.
To harness the therapeutic potential of EES, we studied its underlying 
mechanisms. We found that EES activates motor neurons by recruiting 
proprioceptive circuits within the posterior roots of the spinal cord17–20. 
This understanding translated into EES protocols that target individual 
posterior roots to access the motor neuron pools located in the spinal 
cord segment innervated by each root21. To engage motor neurons at the 
appropriate time, spatially selective EES trains are delivered with timing 
that coincides with the intended movement. Compared to empirical 
stimulation protocols, spatiotemporal EES enhances the potency of 
leg movements, which enabled weight-bearing locomotion in animal 
models of leg paralysis21–23. When combined with overground loco-
motor training enabled by a gravity-assist device24, this stimulation 
promotes extensive reorganization of residual neural pathways that 
improves locomotion with and even without stimulation21,25,26.
Here, we report the development of targeted neurotechnologies for 
delivering spatiotemporal EES during overground locomotor training 
with a gravity-assist device in humans27. We hypothesized that spatio-
temporal EES would immediately enable voluntary locomotion despite 
chronic paralysis, and that the ability to sustain active movements during 
 
training would promote meaningful functional improvements with 
and even without stimulation.
Targeted neurotechnologies and surgery
We developed a wireless environment that allows real-time control over 
independently adjusted EES trains to the spinal cord during overground

walking (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 1). A gravity-assist applied 
multidirectional forces to the trunk to provide personalized bodyweight 
support in a safe workspace27. A recording platform allowed real-time 
processing of whole-body kinematics, ground reaction forces and electro-
myographic (EMG) activity of leg muscles. To deliver stimulation, we 
upgraded an implantable pulse generator commonly used for deep brain 
stimulation with wireless communication modules23 that enabled real-
time control over EES parameters (Extended Data Fig. 1). EES sequences 
could be pre-programmed in an open loop or triggered in a closed loop 
on the basis of external signals21,22. The lumbosacral posterior roots were 
targeted using a 16-electrode paddle array designed for pain therapy.
We enrolled three males with a chronic cervical SCI who displayed 
severe lower limb deficits or complete paralysis that prevented them 
from walking overground (Extended Data Table 1).
To target the posterior roots that project to motor neuron pools 
 
that innervate leg muscles (Fig. 2a), we developed a surgical protocol 
 
consisting of pre-operative imaging combined with intraoperative 
 
electrophysiology and radiology that guided the precise placement of 
the paddle array (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
EES enables control of paralysed muscles
We aimed to identify electrode configurations that target the posterior 
roots that project to spinal cord regions, containing motor neurons 
involved in mobilizing the hip, knee and ankle joints.
We compiled an atlas of motor neuron activation maps underlying 
flexion or extension of each joint in healthy individuals. We projected 
the EMG activity from leg muscles onto the expected anatomical loca-
tions of the associated motor neuron pools28,29. We obtained consistent 
motor neuron activation maps. For example, hip flexion involved the 
activation of upper lumbar segments, whereas ankle extension activated 
motor neuron pools restricted to upper sacral segments (Fig. 2b).
To identify electrodes that could target the posterior roots that pro-
ject to the spinal cord regions associated with these motor neuron 
activation maps, we performed simulations using hybrid computa-
tional models of EES18. Each model was personalized using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scans. 
Simulations estimated the relative recruitment of each posterior root 
by each electrode of the array (Fig. 2c).
These simulations guided the identification of optimal electrode 
configurations. While participants laid supine, we delivered mono-
polar pulses of EES at increasing intensities through the electrodes 
that had the highest probabilities of activating the targeted posterior 
roots (Extended Data Fig. 2). Projection of muscle response amplitudes 
into circular plots described the spatial selectivity of each electrode, 
which we quantified with an algorithm (Fig. 2d). If the selectivity was 
insufficient, we steered the electrical field with multipolar electrode 
configurations (Extended Data Fig. 2).
For all participants, computer simulations and electrophysiological 
 
experiments confirmed high correlations between the identified 
 
electrode configurations and the recruitment of the posterior roots that 
project to each of the targeted spinal cord regions involved in mobiliz-
ing hip, knee and ankle joints (Extended Data Fig. 3).
We next tested whether spatially selective EES could facilitate force 
production from the targeted muscles. While seated, participants 
were asked to produce an isometric force restricted to a single joint. 
Participant 1 (P1) failed to produce hip flexion and ankle extension 
torques with his paralysed leg (Fig. 2e, f). EES immediately enabled 
voluntary activation of the targeted muscles to produce the desired 
torque. These observations were repeated for all targeted joints and 
participants (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Without any voluntary contribution, EES induced minimal muscle 
contraction (Extended Data Fig. 4). At the amplitudes used, EES aug-
mented the excitability of the targeted motor neurons, which enabled 
residual but functionally silent descending inputs to activate muscles.
EES modulates cortical activity
These results opened the possibility that the recruitment of proprio-
ceptive pathways with EES modulates cortical excitability, which may 
facilitate movement30.
To study this hypothesis, we recorded electroencephalographic 
(EEG) activity when participants attempted to produce knee extension 
torques without and with EES (Extended Data Fig. 5a). EES triggered 
a robust response in the sensorimotor cortex (latency: 90–140 ms, 
Extended Data Fig. 5b), probably resulting from the recruitment of 
proprioceptive afferents.
Attempts to activate knee extensor muscles triggered event-related 
desynchronization (ERD) of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex in 
β
-band frequencies, both without and with EES. This cortical activity 
has been linked to movement execution, and is followed by event- 
related resynchronization (ERS) after movement termination31. Previous 
 
studies showed that the amplitude of ERS decreases in proportion to 
severity of SCI31. Voluntary activation of paralysed muscles during EES 
led to an increase in ERS amplitude (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). These 
results suggest that EES enhances cortical excitability, promoting more 
natural dynamics during movement execution30.
Spatiotemporal EES enables walking
Walking involves reproducible sequences of muscle activation (Fig. 3a). 
The underlying motor neuron activation maps involve a succession of 
hotspots for which the migration reflects body mechanics28, ensuring 
weight acceptance, propulsion and swing (Fig. 3b).
Targeted EES effectively activated the regions embedding these hot-
spots (Fig. 3c). To configure EES sequences (Fig. 3d, e), we fine-tuned 
the timing of each spatially selective stimulation train using a closed-
loop controller that triggered EES on the basis of foot trajectory21,22,32. 
We adjusted the onset and duration of each train to approach the motor 
neuron activation maps of healthy individuals (Extended Data Fig. 6). 
Relatively small changes in the timing of each train altered performance 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b). Once optimized, EES could be delivered in 
an open loop: participants regulated the timing of their movements

to pre-programmed EES sequences, which improved gait consistency 
(Extended Data Fig. 6c).
To tune muscle activity, we adjusted EES amplitudes and frequen-
cies (Extended Data Fig. 6). As observed in animal models21,22, we 
found a monotonic relationship between EES frequency and flexor 
muscle activity (Fig. 3f), such that increasing frequency proportion-
ally enhanced flexion (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Unexpectedly, extensor 
motor neuron pools responded inversely. Proprioceptive afferents elicit 
strong monosynaptic responses in extensor motor neurons, whereas 
these afferents primarily engage flexor motor neurons through polysyn-
aptic circuits33. In humans, monosynaptic projections are highly sensi-
tive to low-frequency depression34, which may explain the decrease in 
extensor motor neuron activation with increasing frequency.
Within five days, this procedure led to EES sequences (Fig. 3d, e) that 
enabled robust EMG activity in otherwise quiescent muscles during 
stepping on a treadmill (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Participants were then asked to walk overground using the gravity- 
assist and spatiotemporal EES. The stimulation enabled all partic-
ipants to walk voluntarily until the stimulation was stopped. They 
could resume locomotion as soon as the stimulation was reintroduced 
(Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Video 2).
We next investigated participants’ ability to adjust leg movements. 
First, we asked them to produce exaggerated step elevations without 
changing EES parameters. All participants were able to enhance their 
step elevation three-to-fivefold compared to regular steps (Fig. 4b and 
Extended Data Fig. 8b). Second, we asked them to adjust their stride 
to varying speeds. Not only were the participants able to adjust their 
stride length, but they also could stop locomotor movements despite 
the treadmill belt motion and ongoing stimulation (Extended Data 
Fig. 8b, e).
Finally, we asked participants to walk on a treadmill for one hour. 
All participants sustained more than 1,200 steps, covering distances as 
long as 1.0 km without showing muscle exhaustion or gait impairments 
(Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8c).
These results show that spatiotemporal EES not only enabled com-
pletely or partially paralysed individuals to walk overground, but also 
allowed them to adjust leg movements to stand and walk over a range 
of speeds for durations as long as one hour.

Continuous EES is poorly effective
Recent studies have shown that continuous EES enabled overground 
walking after nearly one year of intense training9,10. As spatiotemporal 
EES enabled locomotion within one week, we evaluated whether con-
tinuous EES could achieve similar efficacy.
We delivered widespread stimulation targeting the posterior roots 
associated with flexor motor neuron pools, as previously recom-
mended10. However, we did not further optimize the stimulation. 
Continuous EES enhanced muscle activity, but was poorly effective in 
facilitating locomotion overground. All participants reported a loss of 
limb position awareness combined with co-activation across muscles 
(Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Video 3). These detrimental 
outcomes are due to the cancellation of proprioceptive information 
during continuous EES35.
Rehabilitation improves walking with EES
Participants followed a rehabilitation program four to five times per 
week for five months (Fig. 1b), focused on walking on a treadmill and 
overground; this was complemented with muscle strengthening and 
standing, each of which was enabled by task-specific EES (Extended 
Data Fig. 10a).
With spatiotemporal EES, all participants improved their 
 
walking capacities following a reproducible chronology (Extended 
 
Data Fig. 10b): non-ambulatory participants initially required crutches 
and the gravity-assist to walk overground. After one to three months, 
they could walk hands-free when provided with hip support in the 
gravity-assist. Eventually, P1 and P2 regained independent walking 
while 35% of their bodyweight was supported against gravity. P3 
needed a walker to progress overground with EES (Supplementary 
Video 4).
Neurological recovery without EES
Improvements were not limited to walking with EES. Rehabilitation 
promoted neurological recovery that translated into improvements 
without EES.
P1 and P2 could transit from sitting to standing and walking 
independently with crutches (Fig. 5a). P1 could even walk with-
out an assistive device for several steps (Supplementary Video 5). 
Consequently, P1 and P2 increased their WISCI (walking index for 
spinal cord injury) scores from 13 to 16 and 6 to 13, respectively. They 
displayed substantial improvements in clinical evaluations such as 
ten-metre and six-minute walking tests without EES (Fig. 5b). Several 
months after completing the rehabilitation program, both participants, 
who continued practicing once or twice per week with EES, maintained 
or further improved their performance.
Participants also recovered voluntary leg movements without EES. 
For example, P1 and P3 could sustain a full extension of their previously 
paralysed legs against gravity (P3, lying only; Extended Data Fig. 11c 
and Supplementary Video 5). Quantified measurements revealed that 
P1 and P2 improved their ability to produce a torque at each joint of

both legs (Fig. 5c). This recovery translated into an increase of 16 and 
11 points in lower extremity motor scores, respectively (Fig. 5d). Both 
participants had previously followed extensive conventional rehabilita-
tion without showing neurological recovery. The lower extremity motor 
score increased by 4 points in participant P3, but without EES this 
recovery was insufficient to produce measurable forces when seated. 
However, force production improved during EES (Fig. 5c). He showed 
a considerable increase in mass and quality of thigh and trunk muscles 
(Extended Data Fig. 11). P1, P2 and P3 also showed improvements in 
upper limb motor scores of 1, 2 and 2 points, respectively.
Support of activities in the community
Recovery of functional leg movements during spatiotemporal EES sug-
gested that practical stimulation technologies could support activities 
of daily living. For this purpose, we engineered a solution based on a 
tablet to enable the selection of EES sequences that are switched on or 
off with a voice-controlled watch (Fig. 6a). To enable standing, walk-
ing or cycling, EES sequences must be synchronized to the intended 
movements. We conceived algorithms that trigger and adjust the timing 
of EES trains in a closed loop based on real-time acquisition of signals 
from wearable inertial measurement units.
Robust event-triggered detection allowed participants to transit from 
sitting to standing and walking freely in ecological settings (Fig. 6b and 
Extended Data Fig. 12). A stimulation program specific for cycling 
permitted participants to ride an adapted trike powered with the arms 
and legs (Supplementary Video 6).
Discussion
We developed targeted EES neurotechnologies that immediately 
restored voluntary control of walking in individuals with severe or 
complete paralysis. The electrode configurations targeted propriocep-
tive circuits through the recruitment of selected posterior roots17–19,36. 
This strategy was pivotal to enable the immediate control of walking 
despite chronic paralysis. This framework guided the rapid personaliza-
tion of spatiotemporal EES sequences that continuously coincided with 
intended movements. Consequently, EES augmented the excitability of 
motor neuron pools that were concomitantly engaged by the natural 
flow of sensory information and residual supraspinal commands. This 
spatiotemporal convergence enabled more robust and natural control 
of leg movements compared to empirical stimulation paradigms such 
as continuous EES9,10.
We hypothesize that this spatiotemporal convergence is responsible 
for the neurological recovery observed in all participants without EES. 
We showed that mice lacking proprioceptive circuits exhibit defective 
rearrangement of descending pathways after SCI, which abolishes 
recovery37. Conversely, we propose that the spatiotemporal contin-
gence between residual supraspinal commands and proprioceptive 
circuit activations with EES may increase the strength and number of 
terminals from spared descending projections through bidirectional 
spike-timing-dependent plasticity38,39. Electrophysiological studies have 
documented such plasticity in humans with SCI40,41. This interpretation 
is consistent with the pronounced reorganization of cortico-reticulo-spi-
nal circuits observed in rodents when EES enables gait training despite 
paralysis25,26. As we observed in humans, rodents regained cortical con-
trol of leg movements that persisted without EES25 when rehabilitation 
commenced early after SCI. We therefore anticipate that this therapy 
will be even more efficacious early after SCI in humans, when the poten-
tial for plasticity is elevated and the neuromuscular system has not yet 
undergone the atrophy that follows chronic paralysis42. Furthermore, 
improvements in muscle mass and other physiological functions43,44 
suggest that EES may help to counteract these deteriorations.
Clinical trials starting early after SCI will require a stratification of 
 
participants who may benefit from the therapy, combined with statistical 
models that predict their potential for recovery45. Here, we validated our 
neurotechnologies in a few individuals. This proof-of-concept stresses the 
urgency of developing neurotechnologies that not only harness targeted 
EES to enable movement, but also provide the usability features to support 
rehabilitation in clinical settings and use in the community.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Surgical procedure and technological 
framework. a, Surgery. Step 1: high-resolution MRI for pre-surgical 
planning. The entry point into the epidural space is based on the position 
of the conus. Step 2: placement of subdermal and intramuscular needle 
EMG electrodes for key leg muscles and paraspinal (PS) muscles. A 
subdermal needle is inserted over the sacrum and used as a return 
electrode for stimulation. Bottom, schematic of the 16-electrode 
paddle array. Step 3: surgical openings based on pre-surgical planning, 
typically between the L1 and L2 vertebrae, which are identified through 
intraoperative X-ray. The mediolateral positions of the paddle array 
are evaluated with X-ray and recordings of EMG responses following 
single pulses of EES delivered to the most rostral or most caudal midline 
electrodes. Step 4: the rostrocaudal position of the paddle array is 
optimized using EMG responses to single-pulse EES delivered to the 
electrodes located at each corner of the paddle array. The aim is to obtain 
strong ipsilateral responses in hip flexors with the most rostral electrodes 
and strong ipsilateral responses in ankle extensors with the most caudal 
electrodes. Step 5: implantable pulse generator (IPG) placed within the 
abdomen. Once connected to the paddle array, the impedance of the

connected. Step 6: post-surgical CT scan showing the location of the 
paddle array with respect to the vertebrae in each participant.  
b, Technological framework and surgical procedure. Step 1: participants 
wear reflective markers that are monitored using infrared cameras. 
An algorithm assigns the markers to the joints in real-time. Step 2: the 
spatiotemporal trajectory of the foot around a calculated centre of rotation 
(centroid, updated every 3 s) is converted into angular coordinates that 
trigger and terminate EES protocols when a user-defined threshold is 
crossed. Step 3: EES commands are transmitted to the IPG via Bluetooth 
(1) to a module that converts them into infrared signals (2), which are 
then transferred to the stimulation programmer device (2′
). Step 4: the 
stimulation programmer transmits EES commands into the IPG (4) via 
induction telemetry, using an antenna (3) taped to the skin and aligned to 
the IPG. EES is delivered through the paddle array (5).

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Identification of electrode configurations 
to target selected posterior roots. Step 1: single-pulse EES and EMG 
recording setup. Step 2: motor neuron pools are located in specific 
segments, which provides information on the relative recruitment of 
each posterior root with EES. For example, electrodes targeting the 
L3 or L4 posterior roots will elicit the strongest EMG responses in the 
knee extensors. A personalized computational model of EES allows the 
performance of simulations that evaluate the relative activation of a given 
posterior root with a given electrode over the entire amplitude range. Each 
curve corresponds to an electrode. The highlighted curve corresponds 
to the electrode selected after steps 3–5. Step 3: single pulses of EES are 
delivered through the subset of electrodes identified by simulations. 
The EMG responses are recorded over a broad range of EES amplitudes. 
Step 4: the EMG responses are concatenated and averaged across n = 4 
repetitions for each EMG amplitude, and the peak-to-peak amplitude 
of the average responses is calculated to elaborate a recruitment curve 
for each recorded leg muscle (black traces: targeted muscles). Step 5: the 
circular plots display the normalized EMG responses (greyscale) when 
delivering single-pulse EES at increasing amplitudes (radial axis), where 
the white circle highlights the optimal EES amplitude and the polygon 
quantifies the relative muscular selectivity at this amplitude (median 
response taken over n = 4 EES pulses). The motor neuron activation maps 
are shown for the optimal amplitudes. Step 6: decision tree to validate or 
optimize electrode configurations. The selected electrode is tested during 
standing as the position of the spinal cord with respect to the paddle array 
can change between supine and standing. In this example, the selectivity 
improves during standing. When the selectivity is deemed insufficient, the 
current is steered towards the targeted posterior roots using multipolar 
configurations. The example shows the increased selectivity of a 
multipolar configuration with two cathodes surrounded by three anodes, 
compared to the two corresponding monopolar configurations. These 
results were verified experimentally and with computer simulations.

schematics) experimentally selected to target the left and right posterior 
roots associated with hip flexion (L1), knee extension (L3), ankle flexion 
(L4) and ankle extension (S1) for the three participants. The circular 
plots and motor neuron activation maps use the same conventions 
as in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2 (median of n = 4 pulses). The 
normalized selectivity index is reported above each motor neuron 
activation map. This index represents the percentage of posterior root 
selectivity for the electrode configuration selected experimentally, with 
respect to the maximum posterior root selectivity that can be achieved 
among all monopolar configurations (all selectivity indices obtained 
from computational simulations). Note that in P2, the electrode selected 
experimentally to target the right S1 root was located on the midline and 
resulted in bilateral activation within computational simulations, which 
resulted in a normalized selectivity index of zero.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Single-joint movements enabled by targeted 
EES. Step 1: participants are placed in standardized positions to allow 
assessment of voluntary torque production at a single joint (isometric 
contractions) without and with targeted EES. Step 2: EES protocols 
elaborated from single-pulse experiments (Extended Data Figs. 2, 3) are 
optimized for each task using multipolar configurations and adjustments 
of EES amplitude and frequency. Step 3: sequence of each trial. 
Participants were asked to produce a maximal voluntary contribution, 
but failed in most cases, as evidenced by the absence of EMG activity 
during this period. While they continued trying to activate the targeted 
muscle, EES was switched on. After a few seconds, participants were 
instructed to stop their voluntary contribution. After a short delay, EES 
was switched off. For each sequence, the produced torque and EMG 
activity of the key agonist and antagonist muscles acting at the targeted 
joint were calculated over the four indicated phases of the trial. Plots 
report the measured torques and EMG activity during the various phase of 
the trial for the left legs of all participants for the four tested joints (cyan, 
flexor; magenta, extensor), together with EES parameters and electrode 
configurations. All measurements were performed before rehabilitation, 
except for hip extension in P1 and P2 (not tested before), and ankle 
extension in P3 (no capacity before rehabilitation), which were carried 
out after rehabilitation. Targeted EES enabled or augmented the specific 
recruitment of the targeted muscle, which resulted in the production of the 
desired torque at the targeted joint, except for ankle extension of P2. Plots 
show quantification of the EMG activity and torque for n = 3 trials per 
condition. Note that hip flexion can be enabled or augmented with EES 
targeting L1 and/or L4 posterior roots (heteronymous facilitation of flexor 
motor neuron pools).

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Configuration of spatiotemporal EES to enable 
walking. a, Spatial configuration. Step 1: select electrode configurations 
from single-pulse experiments to target the three hotspots underlying 
the production of walking in healthy individuals (weight acceptance: 
L3; propulsion: S1; swing: L1/L4). Step 2: optimize EES amplitude and 
frequency while delivering EES during standing. Multipolar configurations 
can be used to refine selectivity of EES protocols. Example shows 
continuous EES targeting the right L3 posterior root to facilitate right knee 
extension during standing, and trains (500 ms) of EES targeting the right 
L1 posterior root stimulation to facilitate hip flexion. Two EES frequencies 
are shown (P3). b, Temporal configuration. Step 3: decision tree to select 
the best strategy to configure the temporal structure of EES protocols. If 
the participant is able to initiate leg movements consistently, use closed-
loop EES based on real-time processing of foot trajectory. If the participant 
is not able to initiate consistent leg movements but can feel when EES 
is applied, use open-loop EES. If the participant is not able to generate 
movement and cannot feel EES, use closed-loop EES combined with 
physiotherapist assistance to move the legs. Step 4: real-time monitoring 
of the spatiotemporal trajectory of the feet. The trajectory is modelled as a 
foot rotating in space around the centroid of the movement (updated every 
3 s). Angular thresholds determine the onset and end of EES protocols. 
Step 5: example showing the effect of three different angular thresholds 
on the onset of EES and resulting kinematics and EMG activity, including 
the quantification of kinematics for each step and condition that enables 
selecting the optimal onset of EES trains (P1). The same approach is 
used to optimize the duration of each train. c, Comparisons between 
closed-loop and open-loop EES. Plots show the vertical displacements 
of the left and right feet and successive step heights during walking with 
spatiotemporal EES delivered in closed loop versus open loop, showing the 
reduced variability of step height during pre-programmed EES sequences 
(P1). d, Resulting EMG patterns. Step 6: example of the progressive 
addition of EES protocols targeting specific hotspots. Plots show the 
quantification of EMG activity for the displayed muscles (n = 7 gait cycles 
for no EES and n = 9 gait cycles for each stimulation condition, P2). Step 
7: EES amplitudes and frequencies are adjusted to avoid detrimental 
interactions between the different EES protocols and thus obtain the 
desired kinematic and EMG activity. Plots report the modulation of EMG 
activity and kinematics with increases in EES amplitude and frequency 
(mean ± s.e.m.; amplitude data: n = 10, 12, 12, 30, 19, 12, 11, 10 gait cycles 
for amplitudes in increasing order, P2; frequency data: n = 20, 15, 16, 17, 
15, 16, 15 gait cycles for frequencies in increasing order, P3).

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Targeted modulation of muscle activity 
during walking. Each panel reports the same representative data and 
quantification for one participant. Left, EMG activity of leg muscles during 
walking on a treadmill without EES (EES OFF) and with spatiotemporal 
EES (EES ON) while applying 50%, 45% and 70% body weight support 
for participants P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Stance and swing phases are 
indicated by grey and white backgrounds, respectively. The personalized 
spatiotemporal EES sequence (open loop) is schematized at the top right. 
The colours of each EES protocol refer to the targeted hotspots: weight 
acceptance (salmon), propulsion (magenta) and swing (cyan). These 
colours are used in the EMG traces to indicate the temporal window 
over which each targeted EES protocol is active. The bar plots report 
the amplitude of muscle activity without EES and with spatiotemporal 
EES, for which the quantification was performed over the entire burst 
of EMG activity and during each temporal window with targeted EES. 
The temporal windows are labelled with a number that refers to the 
spatiotemporal EES sequence. These results show the pronounced increase 
in the EMG activity of the targeted muscles (P1, no EES: n = 7 gait cycles, 
EES: n = 11 gait cycles; P2, no EES: n = 9 gait cycles, EES: n = 9 gait 
cycles; P3, no EES: n = 10 gait cycles, EES: n = 57 gait cycles). The average 
spatiotemporal trajectories of both feet with respect to the hip in the 
sagittal plane are shown for walking without EES and with spatiotemporal 
EES. The presence of targeted EES is indicated with the same colour code. 
Plots at bottom right show the relationships between EES frequency and 
the modulation of the EMG activity of flexor (blue) and extensor (magenta 
or salmon) muscles and maximum amplitude of hip movements during 
walking (mean ± s.e.m.; P1: n = 14, 17, 15, 19 gait cycles for increasing 
frequencies; P2: n = 13, 16, 10, 17, 12 gait cycles for increasing frequencies;

suppress the effects of EES and stand during one cycle of open-loop 
spatiotemporal EES sequence, highlighted in brown (SKIP), whereas he 
actively contributed to the production of movement the rest of the time. 
Plots report the quantification of step height and TA EMG activity during 
walking and when skipping steps for each participant (P1, n = 13 normal

Extended Data Fig. 11 | Changes in muscle mass and quality and 
recovery of voluntary movements with and without EES in participant 
P3. a, Skeletal muscle mass and quality were assessed at the pre- and 
post-rehabilitation time points using X-ray attenuation from CT images 
obtained at the abdomen (L3 vertebra) and mid-thigh (25 cm above 
femorotibial joint space). Muscle mass was determined by measuring the 
cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of muscle tissues, while muscle quality was 
reflected by CT attenuation numbers (in Hounsfield units, HU) within the 
CSAs. Muscle segmentations were performed semi-automatically using 
ImageJ and muscle-specific HU thresholds (–29 to 150 HU). Plots report 
the substantial changes in muscle mass at mid-thigh, for both flexor and 
extensor muscles, and of trunk muscles. Muscle quality was also improved 
at both levels: total mid-thigh, left: 52.9 to 56.1 HU, right: 51.9 to 56.7 
HU; total L3, 45.9 to 48.3 HU. This increase in CT attenuation numbers 
between the baseline CT scan and the follow-up imaging reflected the 
decrease in muscle fibre lipid content at the mid-thigh and abdomen. 
These evaluations were part of a protocol amendment obtained when 
enrolling P3. b, Assessment of voluntary torque production at the ankle

The zoomed window shows the relationship between the movement and 
the EMG activity, indicated with the numbers. This participant presented 
flaccid paralysis, and had thus no control over leg muscles before the 
surgery. This movement was observed repeatedly at the end of the 
rehabilitation period (at least two days per week for several weeks).

Extended Data Fig. 12 | Performance of closed-loop spatiotemporal EES 
to enable walking and cycling outside the laboratory. a, P1 and P2 were 
asked to walk freely overground with a walker (no body weight support) 
for 6 min. The concomitant vertical displacements of the foot show the 
consistency of EES triggering events despite variable foot kinematics and 
voluntary breaks. The trajectory of the centre of mass is shown from a 
top view to illustrate the ability to steer locomotion along any desired 
path. EES protocols took into account the deficits of each participant 
(cyan, EES targeting hip flexion; magenta, EES targeting knee and ankle 
extension). Histograms indicate the number of detected foot-off events 
for the represented leg as a function of the latency with respect to real 
foot-off events. The confusion matrix associated with these detections is 
represented below, as a percentage of the real events that were correctly or 
incorrectly classified. Detections were considered valid if they occurred 
between 400 ms before and 100 ms after real foot-off events, as highlighted 
in green on histograms (P1, n = 49 gait cycles; P2, n = 79 gait cycles).  
b, Closed-loop spatiotemporal EES was delivered in P3 using an electric 
trike powered by hand and foot pedals. Traces show EMG activities of 
the targeted hip flexor and knee extensor muscles on one leg together 
with the tangential acceleration of the pedal and power generated at the 
foot pedal. Plots report the quantification of flexor and extensor EMG 
activities, peak tangential accelerations and generated power without and 
with EES. Successive ankle trajectories during cycling are shown together 
with the timing of EES protocols targeting the hip flexor and knee extensor 
muscles. The histograms and confusion matrices report the performance 
of the controller following the same conventions as in a, except that the 
correct detection window was restricted to 50 ms before and 100 ms after 
the desired crank position (P3: n = 73 pedalling cycles). ***P < 0.001.

Sample size
We report proof-of-concept results in three patients who contributed to a First-in-Man study. No previous data existed to predetermine 
sample size. Previous studies employing spinal cord stimulation or novel implanted neurotechnologies (e.g. brain machine interface) in 
individuals with spinal cord injury reported their results in 1 to 4 participants.

No data were excluded from the analyses.
Replication
Reproducibility of the experimental findings was verified across several steps, several recording sessions and between all 3 participants.
Randomization
Randomization was not sought in the present study. Each participant served as his own control (stimulation off vs. on conditions; evaluations 
at different points over time throughout the rehabilitation training period)
Blinding
Investigators were not blinded. Their expertize was required to optimize the intervention and to apply the intervention during evaluations. 
Furthermore, the effects of the intervention were obvious, acutely producing changes in the kinematics and muscle activities of the 
participants during walking.

- Patient who has any active implanted cardiac device such as pacemaker or defibrillator. 
- Patient who has any indication that would require diathermy. 
- Patient who has any indication that would require MRI. 
- Patient that have an increased risk for defibrillation 
- Severe joint contractures disabling or restricting lower limb movements. 
- Haematological disorders with increased risk for surgical interventions (increased risk of haemorrhagic events). 
- Participation in another locomotor training study. 
- Congenital or acquired lower limb abnormalities (affection of joints and bone). 
- Women who are pregnant (pregnancy test obligatory for woman of childbearing potential) or breast feeding or not willing to 
take contraception. 
- Known or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse. 
- Spinal cord lesion due to either a neurodegenerative disease or a tumour. 
- Patient has other anatomic or co-morbid conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the patient's ability to 
participate in the study or to comply with follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the study results. 
- Patient is unlikely to survive the protocol follow-up period of 12 months.
