Abstract: 
The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the 
European Confederation of Medical Mycology and the European Respiratory 
Society Joint Clinical Guidelines focus on diagnosis and management of 
major forms of aspergillosis. Only a few of the numerous recommendations 
can be summarized here. The performance of a chest computed 
tomographic scan as well as a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL) in patients with suspicion of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (IA) is 
strongly recommended. For diagnosis, direct microscopy preferably using 
optical brighteners, histopathology and culture are strongly recommended. 
Serum and BAL galactomannan is recommended as accurate marker for 
the diagnosis of IA. PCR should be considered in conjunction with other 
diagnostic tests. Pathogen identification to species level by molecular 
methods is strongly recommended for all clinical relevant Aspergillus 
isolates; antifungal susceptibility testing should be done in patients 
unresponsive to treatment, or in regions with a high prevalence of azole 
resistance. Isavuconazole and voriconazole are the preferred agents for 
first line treatment of pulmonary IA, followed by liposomal amphotericin B. 
In refractory disease we strongly recommend a personalized approach 
considering therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), reversal of predisposing 
factors, switching drug class and surgical intervention. Primary prophylaxis 
with posaconazole is strongly recommended in patients with 
haematological malignancy, secondary prophylaxis in high risk patients. 
TDM is strongly recommended for patients receiving posaconazole 
suspension or voriconazole for IA treatment. Combinations of antifungals 
as primary treatment options are not recommended. We strongly 
recommend treatment duration based on clinical improvement, degree of 
immunosuppression and response on imaging.

Abstract 
146 
The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the European Confederation 
147 
of Medical Mycology and the European Respiratory Society Joint Clinical Guidelines focus on 
148 
diagnosis and management of major forms of aspergillosis. Only a few of the numerous 
149 
recommendations can be summarized here. The performance of a chest computed tomographic scan 
150 
as well as a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with suspicion of pulmonary 
151 
invasive aspergillosis (IA) is strongly recommended. For diagnosis, direct microscopy preferably using 
152 
optical brighteners, histopathology and culture are strongly recommended. Serum and BAL 
153 
galactomannan is recommended as accurate marker for the diagnosis of IA. PCR should be

considered in conjunction with other diagnostic tests. Pathogen identification to species level by 
155 
molecular methods is strongly recommended for all clinical relevant Aspergillus isolates; antifungal 
156 
susceptibility testing should be done in patients unresponsive to treatment, or in regions with a high 
157 
prevalence of azole resistance. Isavuconazole and voriconazole are the preferred agents for first line 
158 
treatment of pulmonary IA, followed by liposomal amphotericin B. In refractory disease we strongly 
159 
recommend a personalized approach considering therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), reversal of 
160 
predisposing factors, switching drug class and surgical intervention. Primary prophylaxis with 
161 
posaconazole is strongly recommended in patients with haematological malignancy, secondary 
162 
prophylaxis in high risk patients. TDM is strongly recommended for patients receiving posaconazole 
163 
suspension or voriconazole for IA treatment. Combinations of antifungals as primary treatment 
164 
options are not recommended. We strongly recommend treatment duration based on clinical 
165 
improvement, degree of immunosuppression and response on imaging.

Introduction 
168 
This is the third fungal diagnosis and management clinical guideline published in cooperation with 
169 
various European scientific societies. This part of the guideline regarding invasive and chronic 
170 
aspergillosis, despite its lengthiness, is a condensation of all the recommendations made by the 
171 
group and are put into tables for easier and faster reading. More details on how the 
172 
recommendations were arrived at will follow in a supplementary publication. This Aspergillus 
173 
guideline will follow the style of other guidelines by including diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. 
174 
Guidelines on this topic have been published previously by other scientific groups and all follow the 
175 
common goal to provide clinicians with best guidance in their everyday working environment. Our 
176 
goal was to provide a comprehensive European guideline focusing on the life-threatening diseases 
177 
caused by Aspergillus spp. 
178 
 
179 
Methods 
180 
Author panel recruitment and organisation is similar as done previously [1]. In brief, experts in the 
181 
field were defined and approved by the three societies ESCMID, ECMM, and ERS. The total of 54 
182 
authors were grouped into their special fields of expertise. Subgroup coordinators were responsible 
183 
for the first draft of recommendations. There were two face-to-face meetings followed by numerous 
184 
electronic exchanges. Some of the first recommendations were presented at ECCMID 2014. This 
185 
summary was reviewed and approved by all participating authors and sent to the ESCMID guideline 
186 
director for public review. Then the final version was submitted to the Journal of Clinical 
187 
Microbiology and Infection for additional peer review and subsequent publication. Only the rationale 
188 
of the chronic pulmonary aspergillosis guideline was published ahead of time [2]. 
189 
Questions were predefined and modified were appropriate and the strength of recommendation and 
190 
quality of evidence was slightly modified (Table 1).

Diagnostic Procedures 
194 
Early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a challenge and should be based on the integration of 
195 
clinical, radiological and microbiological data. 
196 
In patients at risk for IA with fever of unknown origin or clinical symptoms of lower respiratory tract 
197 
infection who remain febrile despite broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment, thin-section chest 
198 
computed tomography (multidetector (MDCT), multislice (MSCT), spiral CT, high resolution CT) at 
199 
optimized dose (according to ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle) is the imaging 
200 
modality of choice (AII) [3-13]. Pulmonary CT angiography may be of interest in the early diagnosis of 
201 
IA by depicting directly vessel occlusion at the level of a suspicious fungal lesion with a potential high 
202 
negative predictive value regarding imaging evaluation [14-16], and is required in case of 
203 
haemoptysis (AII). In selected patients where CT is not wanted or feasible, MRI of the lungs may 
204 
represent an alternative imaging to thin-section MSCT [17-22], PET-CT being of modest interest in 
205 
the diagnostics of IA [23, 24]. 
206 
No CT scanning technique is 100% sensitive or specific for IPA [25-27]: Classical CT findings of 
207 
angioinvasive aspergillosis including macronodule(s) >1 cm, which may be surrounded by a halo of 
208 
ground-glass attenuation (halo sign, early phase, inconstant) [26, 28-30], pleural based wedge-
209 
shaped areas of consolidation [31], alveolar consolidations [26, 32, 33], masses (especially in SOT 
210 
recipients) [5, 28], internal low attenuation[34], reverse halo sign [35], cavity or air-crescent sign 
211 
(delayed finding), ground glass opacities and pleural effusion [7, 25, 36]. Bronchoinvasive forms may 
212 
appear as tracheal or bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules with tree in bud appearance [4] 
213 
in 
a 
patchy 
distribution, 
predominant 
peribronchial 
areas 
of 
consolidation 
[37] 
or 
214 
bronchopneumonia [36]. 
215 
 
216 
Other diagnostic procedures include early bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (AII) [38-44], guided by CT-
217 
findings [45, 46], and less frequently CT-guided transthoracic biopsies, video-assisted thoracoscopic 
218 
surgery (VATS), open lung biopsies, transbronchial biopsies [18, 47-59] or convex endobronchial

ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), the latter technique appearing to be a 
220 
promising procedure in this setting [60-62]. 
221 
Moreover, according to clinical symptoms, paranasal CT, CT or MRI of the CNS as well as abdominal 
222 
CT may also be required (Table 2). In particular, findings of sinusitis with bone erosion may be 
223 
observed, intracranial and/or intraorbital extension of the disease being best evaluated by MRI [63-
224 
65]. In the brain, due to direct spread from paranasal sinuses or haematogenous dissemination, 
225 
meningeal enhancement or empyema, cerebral abscess, mycotic aneurysms as well as haemorrhagic 
226 
lesions and rarely stroke may be seen (Table 2) [66-69]. 
227 
Both microscopy and culture should be attempted on appropriate specimens from patients at risk for 
228 
IA with a priority for culture in case insufficient material is available (AII). Demonstrating tissue 
229 
invasion by hyphae through microscopic examination of biopsy or autopsy material provides a 
230 
diagnosis of proven invasive fungal infection. However, the sensitivity of microscopy for IA is 50% at 
231 
best. Specimens may be examined as a wet mount preparation with or without the addition of 10% 
232 
potassium hydroxide. Fluorescent dyes such as Calcofluor white or Blankophor have the advantages 
233 
of relatively high sensitivity, rapid turnaround time, and broad applicability but are not specific (AII). 
234 
Gomori's methenamine silver stain (GMS) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) can be applied to histological 
235 
sections and smears and should be conducted in all cases in which IA is considered a diagnostic 
236 
possibility (Table 3). Respiratory secretions from patients with suspected aspergillosis must be 
237 
processed rapidly for culture to prevent overgrowth by bacteria and yeasts. To achieve optimal 
238 
recovery of Aspergillus from BAL fluid, centrifugation of the sample is advised with investigation of 
239 
the sediment (AIII). It is recommended that high volume untreated sputum and BAL cultures are 
240 
performed as opposed to culturing small volumes of digested, liquefied samples [70] (Table 4). 
241 
Specific media for fungal culture are recommended (Table 5). Galactomannan (GM) detection in 
242 
fluids (especially BAL) is more sensitive than culture for diagnosis of IA. GM is reported as optical 
243 
density index (ODI). In serum samples an ODI cut-off of 0.5 (currently under review by the 
244 
EORTC/MSG-ERC) results in high sensitivity in haematological patients in the absence of mould-active

prophylaxis (AI) (Table 6). Serial screening for GM in prolonged neutropenia and in allogeneic stem 
246 
cell transplantation recipients during the early engraftment phase has an excellent sensitivity and 
247 
negative predictive value (NPV) for IA (AII) [71]. It is not recommended in patients on mould-active 
248 
prophylaxis [72]. Sensitivity of serum GM testing is significantly lower in non-neutropenic versus 
249 
neutropenic patients [73]. Decrease of the GM index during the first two weeks of antifungal therapy 
250 
is a reliable predictor of a satisfactory response in cancer patients [74]. GM detection in BAL 
251 
specimens has an excellent performance with evidence that GM index of 0.5–1.0 has decreased 
252 
predictive values compared with results of >1.0 [75] (AII) (Table 7). (1-3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) is a 
253 
constituent of the cell wall of many species and genera of fungi and is released into body fluids in 
254 
association with fungal infection. A limited role is given for the exclusive testing of the BDG in 
255 
diagnosing IA (BII) (Table 8), however, the combination with GM or PCR improves specific 
256 
detection[76]. The Aspergillus lateral flow LFD assay can be performed on serum and on BAL 
257 
samples. However, at the time of writing this test kit is not yet commercially available. According to 
258 
the evidence so far, the recommendation to perform the LFD assay on BAL samples is moderate (CIII) 
259 
[77] (Table 9). Aspergillus PCR has been applied to blood and BAL fluid, and is currently being 
260 
considered by the EORTC / MSG-ERC for inclusion into the definitions of invasive fungal disease. For 
261 
both sample types, a combination with other biomarkers increases the likelihood of IA [78, 79]. The 
262 
performance of serum PCR is not significantly different from that of whole blood [80]. Prospective 
263 
screening of high-risk haematological patients by a combination of GM and PCR improves the 
264 
diagnostic accuracy and is associated with an earlier diagnosis [81, 82] (Table 10 and 11). 
265 
Molecular detection of fungi in biopsy samples is more sensitive on hyphal positive samples 
266 
compared to hyphal negative samples (AII) (Table 12). Recommendations for storage of original 
267 
samples and isolates are given in table 13. Antibody detection test are only marginally supported for 
268 
the diagnosis of IA (CII) (Table 14).

Resistance to antifungal agents is an increasing problem in Aspergillus diseases [83, 84]. Aspergillus 
272 
species can be intrinsically resistant to polyenes and azoles [85], or may acquire resistance following 
273 
exposure to azole compounds [86]. Resistance may develop during azole therapy, and mainly occurs 
274 
in patients with chronic (cavitary) pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), especially those with aspergilloma 
275 
[87, 88]. Individual Aspergillus colonies from a single specimen may harbour different resistance 
276 
profiles [89]. Resistance may also develop through exposure to azole fungicides in the environment 
277 
[90-93]. As resistant spores are present in ambient air, patients may present with azole-resistant 
278 
Aspergillus disease without previous azole therapy [94, 95]. Acquired resistance to azoles is mainly 
279 
found in Aspergillus fumigatus and is reported globally [83, 84, 96-99] (Table 15). 
280 
In clinical laboratories, species identification to complex level is recommended for all clinically 
281 
significant isolates (BIII). Some species are intrinsically resistant to either azoles or amphotericin B 
282 
(AmB) (Table 16 and 17). 
283 
 
284 
Aspergillus fumigatus species complex 
285 
It is recommended that the MIC should be determined for all clinically relevant Aspergillus isolates 
286 
(AIII) (Table 15), specifically if grown from patients previously exposed to or on antifungal therapy. If 
287 
MIC-testing is not available, routine agar screening can be used to detect azole resistance, but there 
288 
are no validated assays (Table 16). If growth is observed on the screening agar, the isolate should be 
289 
referred to a mycology reference laboratory for MIC testing. Periodic MIC testing of at least 100 A. 
290 
fumigatus is recommended for determination of local epidemiology of azole resistance (Table 15). 
291 
Clinical breakpoints for interpretation of azole and AmB MICs against Aspergillus are currently 
292 
available for European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) microdilution 
293 
method but remain undetermined for Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methodology. 
294 
Accordingly, EUCAST (AII) or CLSI broth microdilution methods (BII) can be used for determination of 
295 
routine MICs for clinical guidance and for epidemiological resistance surveillance (AII). Low to 
296 
moderate correlation between Etest® and CLSI method has been reported, and in-house validation

and confirmation by reference method is warranted if Etest™ is used. Both itraconazole and 
298 
voriconazole (AII) should be tested to ensure detection of the voriconazole-resistance mutation 
299 
TR46/Y121F/T289A (Table 3). Posaconazole resistance without itraconazole resistance has not been 
300 
reported (Table 17). EUCAST (BIII) or CLSI broth microdilution methods (CIII) can be used to 
301 
determine AmB MICs, but a correlation between MIC and clinical outcome is generally lacking, with 
302 
exception of A. terreus and A. flavus (Table 17). 
303 
Voriconazole and isavuconazole are recommended for the treatment of IA due to species showing 
304 
high AmB MICs (Table 18). Liposomal AmB (L-AmB) or AmB lipid complex (ABLC) are recommended 
305 
for species with intrinsic high azole MICs (Table 19 and 20). In aspergillosis due to A. fumigatus, 
306 
voriconazole is recommended if the isolate is voriconazole susceptible (EUCAST MIC ≤1 mg/l) (AI). If 
307 
resistant (voriconazole MIC >2 mg/l), L-AmB therapy is recommended (AIIu). It is unknown if patients 
308 
infected with A. fumigatus with voriconazole MIC 2 mg/l (intermediate), respond less well to 
309 
voriconazole monotherapy. These patients may have an increased probability of failing voriconazole 
310 
monotherapy, and combination therapy with an echinocandin or L-AmB monotherapy should be 
311 
considered for invasive disease (AIII) (Table 20). In azole-resistant chronic pulmonary aspergillosis 
312 
(CPA), L-AmB or micafungin can be considered (BII) if surgical intervention is precluded [2]. Inhaled 
313 
AmB is an option for azole-resistant airway aspergillosis. In settings with environmental azole 
314 
resistance, no change to the primary regimen for IA is recommended when resistance rates are <10% 
315 
(AIII). If azole resistance rates are >10%, primary therapy with voriconazole plus echinocandin (BIII) 
316 
or L-AmB (BIII) is recommended. 
317 
 
318 
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) 
319 
Patients with IA often have multiple conditions associated with their underlying disease and its 
320 
treatment that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance of antifungal 
321 
medications [100]. As a result, standardized dosing recommendations for antifungals used in the 
322 
prevention or treatment of IA may not achieve effective or safe drug exposures in all patients.

Moreover, a subset of patients with severe infections or difficult to treat sites (e.g. CNS) or infections 
324 
caused by Aspergillus spp. with elevated MICs may require higher drug exposures. Therapeutic drug 
325 
monitoring (TDM) is often the most direct laboratory approach for identifying patients at jeopardy 
326 
for treatment failure or toxicity because of inadequate or excessive drug exposures, and can be used 
327 
to fine-tune antifungal dosing to improve the probability of optimal outcomes (Table 21). 
328 
 
329 
For itraconazole, a serum trough of 0.5-4 mg/L (measured by HPLC) is recommended for prophylaxis 
330 
(AII [efficacy], BII [safety]) and a trough of 1-4 mg/L is recommended during the treatment of IA (AII 
331 
[efficacy], BII [safety]) [101-106]. Itraconazole has an active metabolite, OH-itraconazole that is 
332 
present in similar (1:1) concentrations as the parent itraconazole compound when patients are at 
333 
pharmacokinetic steady state. OH-itraconazole concentrations may be reported separately when 
334 
samples are analysed by HPLC or LC/MS/MS, but will included in the overall report of “itraconazole” 
335 
concentrations if samples are analysed by bioassay [107, 108]. Therefore, the target range for 
336 
itraconazole is higher when reported by bioassay (i.e. 3-17 mg/L) but may vary by lab depending on 
337 
the reference standards used. Samples should be acquired within 5-7 days of starting therapy, and 
338 
repeated as clinically indicated if there are changes in the patient’s clinical condition, concomitant 
339 
medications, or suspected toxicity (Table 22). Steady-state concentrations can often be predicted 
340 
from earlier (non-steady) state samples through pharmacokinetic models or computerized dosage-
341 
assistance. In centres where these tools are available, sampling before day 5-7 may be preferable. 
342 
Repeat TDM is recommended the following week to confirm the patient remains in the therapeutic 
343 
range. 
344 
A plasma trough concentration of 1-6 mg/L is considered adequate for most patients receiving 
345 
voriconazole prophylaxis or treatment (AII, safety and efficacy) [109-114]. However, a trough of 2-
346 
6 mg/L (AII, safety and efficacy) is recommended in patients treated for severe infections (multifocal 
347 
or disseminated disease, CNS infections, infection with pathogen with elevated MICs) [111, 112]. 
348 
TDM is strongly recommended in paediatric patients due to the much higher rates of drug

elimination and potential for underdosing, especially with the lower voriconazole doses 
350 
recommended in the past (AII) [115, 116]. Plasma levels should be monitored between 2-5 days after 
351 
initiation of therapy, and ideally repeated the following week to confirm the patient remains in the 
352 
therapeutic range. Repeated monitoring is indicated if there are changes in the patient’s clinical 
353 
condition, concomitant medications, or suspected toxicity (Table 23). 
354 
For patients receiving posaconazole suspension, a plasma trough of >0.7 mg/L is recommended 
355 
during prophylaxis (BII efficacy) [117, 118]; and a trough of >1 mg/L is recommended if the patient is 
356 
receiving treatment for suspected or documented IA (AII efficacy) [119]. Currently, no studies have 
357 
defined an upper plasma target that is associated with toxicity, although pharmacokinetic studies 
358 
supporting the registration of the new posaconazole tablet formulation with the EMA used a 
359 
provisional cut-off of 3.75 mg/L [120-122]. Posaconazole plasma trough levels should be monitored 
360 
on day 5 of therapy or soon thereafter, and repeated as clinically indicated. 
361 
For most patients prescribed posaconazole, we recommend using the newer tablet formulation (or 
362 
intravenous formulation if indicated) rather than the suspension (AII), as tablets are more likely to 
363 
consistently achieve target plasma levels and are less affected by GI-dependent drug interactions 
364 
[120]. Currently, there is limited evidence to suggest that all patients receiving posaconazole tablets 
365 
or IV formulation for prophylaxis require routine TDM; however, our opinion is that when treating 
366 
suspected or documented Aspergillus infections, TDM could still be useful if the pathogen has 
367 
elevated MICs, is unresponsive to treatment, or in the event of unexplained toxicity (BIII). Until 
368 
further data are available, we recommend using TDM monitoring strategies and plasma trough 
369 
targets as detailed above suggested for the suspension formulation (Table 22). 
370 
Although dose-response and plasma concentration-response relationships for isavuconazole have 
371 
been reported in animal models, limited data are currently available to define a target through 
372 
therapeutic range or support the need for routine TDM for this agent [123]. Our opinion is that TDM 
373 
could still be useful in the clinical assessment or monitoring of patients receiving isavuconazole 
374 
therapy (CIII) if patients are unresponsive to treatment, have unexpected toxicity, pharmacokinetic

drug-drug interactions, or if isavuconazole is being used to treat pathogens with elevated MICs or 
376 
sanctuary sites such as the CNS. In the absence of well-defined therapeutic targets, documentation 
377 
of a plasma trough in the range of 2-3 mg/L (mean concentration range from phase II/III clinical 
378 
studies) after day 5 (including loading doses) suggests adequate drug exposure (Table 24). 
379 
In rare circumstances, flucytosine may be used in combination with other antifungals for the 
380 
treatment of triazole-resistant Aspergillus spp. In this scenario, weekly measurement of peak serum 
381 
concentrations 2 hours following an oral dose (AII) are needed to confirm that peak concentrations 
382 
are 50-100 mg/L in order to reduce the risk of toxicity. Trough concentrations of 25-50 mg/mL are 
383 
required for efficacy [124, 125]. 
384 
 
385 
IA in the paediatric population 
386 
Presenting symptoms, distributions and patterns of diseases and vulnerability to IA are similar 
387 
between children and adults. However, differences exist in epidemiology and underlying conditions, 
388 
usefulness of newer diagnostic tools, pharmacology of antifungal agents and evidence from 
389 
interventional phase III studies. Recommendations for paediatric patients are based on efficacy in 
390 
phase II and III trials in adults (corresponding to adult ESCMID recommendation), the availability of 
391 
paediatric pharmacokinetic data, safety data and supportive efficacy data. In addition, regulatory 
392 
approval is considered as well. Therapeutic drug monitoring is always recommended when mould-
393 
active azoles are used as prophylaxis or treatment. 
394 
Primary antifungal prophylaxis may be indicated in paediatric patients at ‘high risk’ for developing 
395 
invasive fungal diseases, and specifically IA. A natural incidence rate of IFDs of ≥10% is usually 
396 
considered as high risk. High-risk populations include children with de novo or recurrent leukaemia 
397 
(e.g. AML, ALL depending on treatment protocol), bone marrow failure syndromes with profound 
398 
and persistent neutropenia (e.g. MDS, VSAA), allogeneic HSCT recipients, patients with chronic 
399 
granulomatous disease and those undergoing lung transplantation. For patients with haematological 
400 
disorders, the mould-active oral azoles are the first choice to prevent IA in children, although both

itraconazole and posaconazole are not licensed for use in patients <18 years of age. Due to the lack 
402 
of paediatric data, recommendations for lung and high-risk liver transplant patients correspond to 
403 
those made for adults [126, 127]. Secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of IA when risk 
404 
factors are persisting is recommended with an antifungal targeted at the previous Aspergillus 
405 
species, which caused the first episode (Table 26). 
406 
Diagnostic procedures used in children are not different from those used in adults but their 
407 
performance may differ. Typical abnormalities (e.g. halo sign, air crescent sign) on CT-chest as 
408 
described in adults are less common in children in which unspecific masses or infiltrates predominate 
409 
[128-130]. The GMI test on blood and BAL samples has a similar sensitivity and specificity profile 
410 
compared to adults [131-139]. The BDG test is not specific for Aspergillus and is not validated in 
411 
children. Higher baseline levels are reported in healthy children and therefore the cut-off is yet 
412 
unknown [140-144]. 
413 
General management principles of IA are consistent with those in adults and include prompt 
414 
initiation of antifungal therapy, control of predisposing conditions (e.g. reduction or discontinuation 
415 
of glucocorticosteroids in immunosuppressed, administration of colony-stimulating factors in 
416 
neutropenic patients), and surgical interventions on a case by case basis using a multidisciplinary 
417 
approach. Voriconazole is recommended as the first line agent to treat IA in all paediatric patients 
418 
except for neonates (AIIt). L-AmB is first choice for neonates (AIII) and may replace voriconazole as 
419 
first line treatment in areas or institutions with a high prevalence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus. 
420 
Upon diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis thorough evaluation for further sites of infection 
421 
is required and should include the CNS. The optimal duration of therapy is determined by the 
422 
resolution of all signs and symptoms and reversal of the underlying deficit in host defences. For 
423 
salvage therapy and breakthrough infections, a switch to a different class of antifungals is 
424 
recommended [104, 113, 119, 145-154] (Table 27). 
425 
If a fever-driven (empiric) strategy is used in at risk paediatric haematological patients, caspofungin 
426 
or L-AmB are recommended until resolution of fever and neutropenia [155-157]. Treatment

recommendations for a diagnostic-driven (pre-emptive) strategy correspond to those made for

targeted treatment [158-161]. 
429 
 
430 
Aspergillosis in haematological malignancies including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
431 
In patients treated for haematological diseases, prolonged severe neutropenia is the most important 
432 
risk factor for the development of IA. T cell depleted grafts, glucocorticosteroids and other immune 
433 
suppressive drugs have been identified as further risk factors for IA in the later course after HSCT, 
434 
even in non-neutropenic patients [162]. In fact, up to two thirds of patients with IA diagnosed after 
435 
allogeneic HSCT are not neutropenic [163], and the median time of diagnosis of IA after allogeneic 
436 
HSCT is 82 days (range, 3 - 6542 days) [164]. 
437 
 
438 
Environment 
439 
Standards for the hospital environment in this patient population (adults and paediatric) requires 
440 
special attention. Patients need to be segregated from construction or renovation (AIIh), potted 
441 
plants (BII), and flowers in wards and in patients’ rooms (CIII) [165-170]. Published data support the 
442 
recommendation to accommodate patients in special hospital rooms with positive air pressure and 
443 
HEPA filters (BII) or laminar airflow (BIIh). However, data were with historical controls, 
444 
underpowered, or described by multivariate analysis describing high-risk situations for IA [171-174]. 
445 
Protective masks for patients are proven not to be effective outside of the protected area (CII) [175], 
446 
filters for water supply especially in showers are recommended (BII) [176-180]. No data are available 
447 
to support the regular environmental air sampling to prevent infections. However, indoor sampling is 
448 
advisable to monitor filter efficacy (BIII) [181, 182].

Treatment

Providing a definite diagnosis of IA is a continuously challenging endeavour for clinicians. The EORTC

definitions are only designed for clinical studies. For clinical decision-making, these definitions could

have a deleterious outcome since confirmation of a proven or probable diagnosis would delay the 
454 
start of therapy [183]. Any patient at risk considered by the responsible clinician as having IA should 
455 
receive therapy (AIII) (Tables 28-29). A consensus statement was made regarding duration of 
456 
therapy. Physicians should consider IV to oral switch in stable and PK-reliable patients. Treatment 
457 
duration depends on clinical response and on immune reconstitution or recovery from graft-versus-
458 
host disease (GvHD). Good partial or complete remission (radiographic imaging) requires no clinical 
459 
(by radiographic imaging: scarring allowed) or microbiological evidence of disease. The range of the 
460 
duration of treatment (3 to >50 weeks) is huge and the evidence base to support any particular 
461 
recommendation is weak [146, 149, 184, 185]. Close monitoring (e.g. radiographic imaging [186, 187] 
462 
or, if applicable, biomarkers) is suggested once antifungal treatment is discontinued. 
463 
Additional adjunctive therapy such as the administration of G-CSF or G-CSF-primed granulocyte 
464 
infusions (data mainly from paediatric populations) received only a weak supportive 
465 
recommendation (CIII). In refractory cases, G-CSF (or IFNγ) has immunomodulatory effects [188-193]. 
466 
No controlled trials have been performed and only anecdotal data with small numbers of patients 
467 
exist. Persistent neutropenia is related with treatment failure, recovery from neutropenia enhances 
468 
the efficacy of antifungal agents. A recent Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of granulocyte 
469 
transfusions indicates no mortality difference for any kind of infection in patients with neutropenia 
470 
[194]. 
471 
 
472 
Secondary Prophylaxis 
473 
A further consensus statement regards the use of secondary prophylaxis: Secondary prophylaxis is a 
474 
treatment strategy to prevent recurrence of IA during a subsequent risk period of 
475 
immunosuppression. Patients with a history of IA previously successfully treated with antifungals 
476 
entering a subsequent risk period of immunosuppression, e.g. allogeneic HCT (early phase), 
477 
chemotherapy resulting in severe neutropenia (i.e. <500/µL and at least for 7 days), acute GvHD >I°

or extensive chronic GvHD, or T-cell suppressing therapy, including steroids, are at risk. Agents for 
479 
secondary prophylaxis are listed in Table 30. 
480 
 
481 
Other Treatment Options: Primary Prophylaxis, Fever-driven (Empiric), and Diagnostic-driven (Pre-
482 
emptive) Therapy 
483 
Two published studies by Chamilos and Sinko describe a number of patients who succumbed with IA 
484 
missed prior to death [195, 196]. Current diagnostic procedures are apparently not satisfactory. For 
485 
this reason, patients known to be at high risk for IA receive primary prophylaxis, especially patients 
486 
with profound and prolonged neutropenia or with active GVHD (Table 31). 
487 
As an alternative to prophylaxis, patients could receive the classical empirical administration of 
488 
antifungal agents during fever refractory to broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Empiric treatment 
489 
is defined as a fever-driven treatment approach. Patients who would qualify for this approach are 
490 
patients receiving induction or remission chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or MDS or conditioning 
491 
chemotherapy for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Empiric antifungal treatment is 
492 
expected to reduce morbidity [158, 159, 197-200] and mortality [201] (Table 32). In our consensus 
493 
statement the duration of empiric antifungal treatment is set by the following rules: If the patient is 
494 
afebrile and has no active infection or infiltrates, then antifungal therapy can be discontinued after 
495 
recovery of leukocyte counts. 
496 
Pre-emptive treatment is defined as a diagnostic driven procedure. In most cases, it is defined by 
497 
positive GM testing. However, (low-dose) chest CT with pulmonary infiltrates would apply as well. 
498 
The use of ß -D-glucan and PCR testing as alternative biomarkers for galactomannan have 
499 
considerable merit [202, 203], though ß-D-glucan is not specific for Aspergillus disease. Some authors 
500 
wait for Aspergillus-associated typical radiological signs (including nodules, halo sign, wedge-shaped 
501 
areas of consolidation, or air crescent signs) before starting antifungal treatment (agents 
502 
recommended as in targeted treatment).

The guideline group does not provide any recommendation, which approach is the most appropriate 
504 
since various backgrounds, histories, and epidemiology drive that decision, in a given centre. 
505 
Basically, there remain two possible ways to manage or monitor a patient besides vital signs (e.g. 
506 
fever). The two classical options are that 1) patient receives primary prophylaxis or 2) a patient 
507 
receives no prophylaxis but needs monitoring of biomarkers. The guideline group appreciates that 
508 
breakthrough fungal diseases may appear through either symptoms or a disease-identifying 
509 
biomarker or imaging result. Figure 1 depicts a consensus algorithm for patient management if the 
510 
minimum recommended diagnostic tests are positive or negative. 
511 
 
512 
Therapy for refractory disease 
513 
Refractory IA is defined as progression of disease and should be differentiated from stable disease 
514 
[204]. Patients with radiological evidence of progression and persisting elevated GM have a very high 
515 
probability of treatment failure resulting in death. Assessment of response should use composite 
516 
outcome parameters including clinical, radiological, and mycological criteria. Radiological progression 
517 
following or closely preceding neutrophil recovery should be carefully evaluated and is not 
518 
necessarily indicative of failure. Keeping this in mind, assessing response 2 weeks after treatment 
519 
initiation generally allows predicting the response, especially recognizing oncoming failure [205]. In 
520 
case of GM negative IA, early assessment of response may be trickier and could require a longer time 
521 
of therapy. If failure ascertained, look for poor vascular supply (i.e. sinusitis requiring surgical 
522 
treatment), microbiological confirmation is recommended since identification of the fungus at the 
523 
species level is pivotal. If a viable organism is recovered, susceptibility testing is recommended, 
524 
especially regarding azole resistance. On the other hand, azole concentration should be monitored as 
525 
well (see chapters on resistance and therapeutic drug monitoring within this guideline) [28, 204, 206-
526 
214]. The choices of antifungal agents in refractory disease are listed in Table 33.

Approximately 43-80% of the cases of IA appear in patients without a haematological malignancy 
530 
[42, 215-218], although these patients are rarely included in the seminal studies of antifungals [146, 
531 
149, 185]. The proportion of these patients is even increased when exposed to spore concentrations 
532 
of >25 cfu/m3 in hospital air [219-222]. The non-haematological populations at risk for IA include 
533 
among others solid organ transplant recipients (SOT), patients treated with prolonged high dose 
534 
glucocorticosteroids, or with other immunosuppressants, patients with advanced AIDS or neoplasia, 
535 
COPD, liver failure, liver cirrhosis as well as critically ill patients requiring ICU admission [42, 215-217, 
536 
223-226]. These patients frequently do not fulfil the EORTC criteria. Confirmation of diagnosis may 
537 
be delayed resulting in high mortality rates. At the same time drug-drug interactions and toxicity can 
538 
occur more frequently compared to haematological patients [42]. Physicians need to be aware of the 
539 
specific risk factors, clinical manifestations and management challenges in order to improve 
540 
outcome. 
541 
In SOT recipients the average incidence of IA ranges from 0.1 to 3% [227, 228], with the highest risk 
542 
in small bowel (11.6%) and lung (8.6%) transplant recipients, followed by patients receiving liver 
543 
(4.7%), heart (4.0%), pancreas (3.4%), and kidney (1.3%) grafts [227-229]. Half the cases will occur in 
544 
the first three months after transplantation, in patients with post-surgical risk factors. Late 
545 
aspergillosis 
is 
more 
common 
in 
elderly 
recipients, 
and 
patients 
with 
pronounced 
546 
immunosuppression due to rejection or post-transplant neoplasia or chronically impaired graft 
547 
function [228, 230]. With the exception of lung transplantation, in which universal prophylaxis is still 
548 
common, antifungal prophylaxis will target SOT recipients with additional risk factors [229]. Risk 
549 
factors for early IA in all SOT recipients – Including heart transplants – comprise renal failure 
550 
requiring replacement therapy, re-intervention, CMV disease, and high environmental exposure to 
551 
mould spores [126, 229, 231, 232]. In liver transplantation, high MELD score, transplantation in 
552 
fulminant hepatic failure, high intraoperative transfusion needs or re-transplantation are considered 
553 
indications for post-surgical prophylaxis [233-241]. In lung transplant recipients, risk factors include 
554 
previous respiratory tract colonization with Aspergillus, single lung transplant, CMV disease and

acquired hypogammaglobulinaemia [242-244]. In kidney transplantation risk factors include COPD, 
556 
delayed graft function, bloodstream infection, and acute graft rejection [245] and an 
557 
>1.25 mg/kg/day average dose of prednisone [246]. Finally, some polymorphisms in defence genes 
558 
have also been suggested to increase risk in transplant recipients [247, 248]. 
559 
The incidence of IA in HIV patients has decreased since the advent of new antiretroviral therapy (2.2 
560 
cases per 10,000/year), but mortality remains high (38%) [249]. IA typically appears in patients with 
561 
low CD4 counts and associated conditions such as neutropenia, advanced cirrhosis, liver 
562 
transplantation or glucocorticosteroid therapy [250-258]. As in other non-haematologic populations, 
563 
EORTC criteria only detect half of the IA cases diagnosed among HIV-infected patients [249] and in a 
564 
recent series of autopsies, only 12% of the patients had been diagnosed ante mortem [259] (Table 
565 
34). 
566 
IA may affect 0.3% of patients with liver cirrhosis [260]. Both acute liver failure and advanced 
567 
cirrhosis, mainly alcoholic hepatitis treated with glucocorticosteroids, have been recognized as risk 
568 
factors for IA [223, 261-263]. Low level of suspicion explains that 53% of the cases of IA in cirrhotic 
569 
patients are only recognized post-mortem [264] and that liver disease is independently associated 
570 
with IA-related mortality [217, 265]. 
571 
IA has also been described in apparently immunocompetent patients in a critical condition as a 
572 
complication of ARDS, COPD, pneumonia, burns, severe bacterial infection, surgery, and 
573 
malnutrition. Incidence is 4-6/1,000 ICU admissions and the mortality is higher than 70% in most 
574 
series [262, 266-268]. Glucocorticosteroid treatment was the major host factor [269, 270] and as in 
575 
cirrhotic or HIV positive patients delayed diagnosis is common [271, 272]. COPD patients requiring 
576 
glucocorticosteroids represent a group with especially high mortality [266, 273 , 274]. Risk factors 
577 
include admission to ICU, chronic heart failure, and antibiotic treatment and, above all, the 
578 
cumulative dose of glucocorticosteroids [273]. 
579 
Classic pulmonary and CNS aspergillosis predominates in these populations, but disseminated 
580 
disease, fulminant and atypical forms may occur [221, 231, 242, 268, 275-283]. The sensitivity of

most diagnostic methods is lower in non-haematological patients. Isolation of Aspergillus from 
582 
respiratory cultures has a much lower positive predictive value so overdiagnosis has to be prevented 
583 
[215, 284-288]. Regarding imaging findings, angioinvasive presentation included in the EORTC criteria 
584 
is uncommon in this setting [289]. Airway invasive radiological presentation was present in 37% of 
585 
heart transplant recipients and was associated with delayed diagnosis and poorer prognosis [231, 
586 
290]. In COPD and HIV-positive patients, the most common radiological presentation was an alveolar 
587 
infiltrate [289, 291, 292]. Experience with biomarkers and PCR is still scarce in these populations, but 
588 
the combination of at least two different methods appears to be the best diagnostic approach [293-
589 
301] (Table 35). 
590 
Despite no comparative studies of antifungal therapy in non-haematologic patients voriconazole 
591 
remains the first option, since it has been related to reduced mortality [233, 302-304] (Table 36). 
592 
Combination therapy is uncommon, although retrospective data was encouraging in SOT recipients 
593 
[305]. The risks of drug-drug interactions and toxicity are very important in these populations and 
594 
TDM is especially advisable [306-311]. In patients with liver insufficiency, L-AMB is usually the first 
595 
therapeutic option. Antifungal resistance is not a common problem despite prophylaxis [312, 313], 
596 
although some cases have been reported [314-316]. Finally, immune reconstitution syndrome may 
597 
occur after therapy initiation [317]. 
598 
Most lung recipients receive antifungal prophylaxis. Targeted prophylaxis is preferred in the 
599 
remaining SOT with risk factors [126, 229, 318-321]. However, significant variation in practice has 
600 
been noted [238, 320, 322, 323]. In order to avoid drug-drug interactions and toxicity, echinocandins 
601 
or inhaled amphotericin are preferentially used [324-327], although voriconazole has also 
602 
demonstrated its efficacy and safety in this setting [234, 237, 328-330]. Duration of prophylaxis is 
603 
adjusted to the presence of risk factors and, with the exception of lung recipients, is usually limited 
604 
tor 3-4 weeks [232] (Table 37).

CPA is an indolent destructive disease of the lungs usually complicating other pulmonary conditions 
608 
occurring in non- or mildly immunocompromised patients [331]. Its manifestations include chronic 
609 
cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which if left untreated may progress to chronic fibrosing 
610 
pulmonary aspergillosis (CFPA), Aspergillus nodule and single aspergilloma [2, 332]. Subacute 
611 
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (previously chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis) is also a 
612 
cavitating destructive lung disease usually found in moderately immunocompromised patients which 
613 
progresses more rapidly, typically over 1 to 3 months. The diagnosis of CPA requires a combination of 
614 
characteristics: one or more cavities with or without a fungal ball present or nodules on thoracic 
615 
imaging, either direct evidence of Aspergillus infection (culture or microscopy from biopsy) or an IgG 
616 
antibody response to Aspergillus spp. and exclusion of alternative diagnoses (especially 
617 
mycobacterial infection), all present for at least 3 months [2]. Over 90% of patients have circulating 
618 
Aspergillus antibody (precipitins) (AII) [333]. A positive culture of Aspergillus fumigatus respiratory 
619 
tract secretion (BAL, bronchoscopy aspiration) is not diagnostic because many different pathologies 
620 
are attributable to the fungus, and it may be an airway colonizing fungus or a plate contaminant in 
621 
the laboratory. 
622 
If a fungal ball is seen, then only a positive test of Aspergillus IgG or precipitins confirms 
623 
pathogenicity. Patients may have CPA and other infections concurrently (see below). 
624 
The distinctive hallmark of CCPA is new and/or expanding cavities with thick or thin walls in those 
625 
with chronic lung disease. An intracavitary fungal ball may be present, often with pleural thickening 
626 
and extensive parenchymal destruction and/or fibrosis. Patients may have CPA and other infections 
627 
concurrently, especially bacterial including Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or tuberculosis and 
628 
non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Aspergillus nodules, which may be single or multiple, are 
629 
very similar in appearance to malignancy as well as those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, 
630 
coccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection and – rarely – 
631 
actinomycosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Typically, Aspergillus nodules appear rounded, some with low 
632 
attenuation or cavitation within. Some are spiculated, a common feature of carcinoma [332].

If technically feasible single aspergilloma should be surgically removed, preferably via video-assisted 
634 
thoracic surgery technique with due consideration to risks as recommended [334]. Long term oral 
635 
antifungal therapy is strongly recommended in patients with CCPA, partly to reduce general and 
636 
respiratory symptoms [335, 336], but also to minimise haemoptysis and prevent lung destruction and 
637 
fibrosis (AII) itraconazole or voriconazole are effective for CCPA (AIII) [2]. Oral posaconazole is a 
638 
potential alternative treatment (BII) [2]. Six months of therapy is the recommended minimum (AI) 
639 
[2]. Relapse is common after discontinuation. Intravenous therapy for CPA is useful in patients who 
640 
fail or are intolerant of triazoles or have triazole resistant A. fumigatus. Prednisolone may be 
641 
considered for underlying symptom control only if patients are adequately treated with antifungals. 
642 
Mild and moderate haemoptysis usually responds to tranexamic acid; severe haemoptysis should be 
643 
arrested with bronchial artery embolization (Table 38). 
644 
 
645 
Conclusions 
646 
This executive summary is a comprehensive guideline covering many aspects of Aspergillus diseases. 
647 
It provides guidance for clinicians on prevention of disease, diagnostic procedures, resistance issues 
648 
and treatment of IA as well as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. The guideline group will provide 
649 
additional publications supporting the rational of given recommendations. 
650 
Finally, the guideline group provides comprehensive tables explaining various options for specific 
651 
situations. A follow-up manuscript is planned in approximately 5 years to update this guideline.

Examples, comments 
Populations with increased 
pharmacokinetic variability 
Impaired gastrointestinal function; hepatic dysfunction; paediatric patients, elderly patients, obese patients, 
critically-ill patients 
Changing pharmacokinetics 
Intravenous to oral switch, changing gastrointestinal function, changing hepatic or function, physiological-
instability 
Interacting medications 
Patient receiving medication known to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes especially CYP3A4, antacids, 
proton-pump inhibitors (itraconazole capsules, posaconazole suspension), antiretroviral medications. 
Patients should have medication records screened using drug interactions screening database before starting 
and stopping antifungals (example: www.fungalpharmacology.org, fungal-druginteractions.org, or 
http://www.aspergillus.org.uk/content/antifungal-drug-interactions 
Poor prognosis disease 
Extensive or bulky infection, lesions contiguous with critical structures, CNS infection, multifocal or 
disseminated infection 
Compliance concerns 
Important issue with longer-term consolidation therapy or secondary prophylaxis in outpatient setting

Therapeutic range by bioassay may vary by laboratory but 
typically fall in the range of (3-17 mg/L). 
Need for repeat determinations should be determined by 
clinical status, or change in concomitant medications; may be 
less important with suspension however compliance is a

If treatment failure or toxicity suspected, TDM may

Posaconazole exposures between 0.5-3.75 mg/L are 
well studied and considered safe and effective with 
all three formulations. 
Posaconazole plasma levels above this exposure

Limited data to support routine TDM but

treatment failure, drug interactions, or if 
toxicity is suspected. 
The long half-life of isavuconazole (130 
hours) may support use for TDM in some 
clinical situations to confirm drug 
clearance prior to starting medications 
metabolized by CYP3A4, especially 
chemotherapy agents.

One of the reasons for the increase in antifungal resistance is to pay no 
attention to the dominant species of Aspergillus in a region and doing 
empirical therapies. For example, in the Middle East among Aspergillus 
species, A. flavus is the most common cause detected. In addition, A. 
niger is nearly the second most common cause detected; Unlike most 
reports from throughout the world that A. fumigatus is the dominant and 
most frequent causative agent for fungal infections and environment 
airborne. The high frequency of A. flavus isolation from here may be 
because of the higher prevalence of the fungus in the environment, for 
example air, water, and different geographic location (1-3).

Microbiol 2015; 8(1): e13744. 
Agree that local epidemiology is a 
basis 
to 
empirical 
treatment. 
Another example is A. terreus in 
Innsbruck.

PCR; the false positive results may increase because of contamination or

In Table 32, since many of the agents listed are ‘no better than 
fluconazole”, and often more toxic, why isn’t fluconazole in the table? 
Because we strictly focus on 
aspergillosis.

Itraconazole gets only a “D” recommendation but has prophylaxis efficacy 
equivalent to voriconazole. In our experience the capsules are better 
tolerated than the suspension and many patients will get good serum 
levels, so the suspension (which has more gut side-effects) can be 
reserved for those patients who do not achieve adequate therapeutic 
levels on the capsules. Several studies have shown good tolerability of the 
suspension. Itraconazole use has the advantage of “preserving” the more 
modern azoles for use as treatment if there is persistent fever or 
suspected breakthrough infection (see for instance Clinical effectiveness 
Don’t agree. You likely refer to 
David Marks study, where there 
was 
no 
efficacy 
difference 
between 
voriconazole 
and 
itraconazole. 
Toxicity/tolerability 
though was different. No action 
taken.

In Table 33, fluconazole gets a “D” for fever-driven therapy, presumably 
because of its lack of mould efficacy. However most fungal infections in 
this setting are yeasts so – if a CT chest can be performed to exclude 
aspergillosis – it’s a perfectly reasonable choice. See for instance the 
2000 RCT by Winston which showed Fluconazole as effective but much 
better tolerated than amphotericin. 
The group consensus is D, 
because of the lack of activity 
against aspergillosis.

Regarding the reference 72 saying that “Serial screening for GM in 
prolonged neutropenic patients and allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
recipients during the early engraftment phase has an excellent sensitivity 
and negative predictive value (NPV) for IA [71] but is not recommended in 
patients on mould-active prophylaxis [72]” may cause misunderstanding. 
We should also notice that using GM testing is not recommended in 
patients on mould active prophylaxis but the test remains useful to 
diagnose patients with a clinical suspicion of invasive fungal disease in 
patients under mould active prophylaxis as noted in reference 72. It is 
recommended in figure 1 too.  
So, although not recommended routinely in surveillance, GM testing in 
patients on antimould prophylaxis is still useful for the diagnosis of IA (ref 
72). 
Agree. GM in BAL fluid is 
particularly useful in case of 
persistent fever and lung 
infiltrates on CT. This is 
addressed in the following lines.

It is generally recommended that using another class of antifungal agent

a condition as mentioned above but there is no recommendation about 
other azoles in the same table such as for itraconazole and 
isavuconazole. 
From this table, it can be misunderstood that isavuconazole or

itraconazole may be used in İA developed under mould active azole 
prophylaxis.  
I know that for the isavuconazole we have very limited clinical studies but 
the references given for voriconazole are also very poor.  I think the same 
recommendations should also be done for isavuconazole and itraconazole 
at least as an expert opinion level because we know that cross resistance 
is can be seen in Aspergillus fumigatus isolates for all mould active azoles 
(ref: Gregson L, AAC 2013). Otherwise it will be a kind of bias I think.

Table 31 
Zekaver Odabasi

Marmara University, department of

Haematological malignancies, e.g. AML with prolonged and profound 
neutropenia: For the prophylaxis there is no recommendation for 
voriconazole, although we know that there is very limited number of 
clinical studies for evaluation of voriconazole in this group of patients 
(Vehreschild JJ, A double-blind trial on prophylactic voriconazole or 
placebo during induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia 
(AML), J infect. 2007) 
Most of the other guidelines (ECIL 5, NCCN 2015 and German 
hematology etc.) recommended voriconazole as an alternative agent for 
the primary prophylaxis of IFD in AML patients.  
If you do not recommend it in AML, I think it should be noticed in table 31 
at least saying that no clinical data or no recommendation or CIII etc 
We have it in allogeneic SCT, and 
not in the neutropenic population / 
AML, added it.

which is somewhat artificial in the

Transferring the data or results from posa prophylaxis study results (ref 
525, which was performed in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute 
myelogenous leukemia or the myelo-dysplastic syndrome) to neutropenic 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients seems disrupting the 
homogeneity and reliability of this table and may be a kind of bias I think. 
The risk of aspergillosis in any kind of neutropenia then accepted as a 
good candidate for posa prophylaxis by this data extraction from ref 525. 
Even risk factors in Allo BMT cases for aspergillosis changes according to 
type of BMT, match or mismatch condition, age, underlying disease etc. 
I see the point, but I don’t follow. 
The group stays in line with the 
grading system by downgrading 
from A to B.

infectious diseases Istanbul, Turkey 
Table 32 is for empirical antifungal therapy of IFD in febrile neutropenic 
patients. Considering the Walsh study on comparison of caspo vs LamB, 
caspo was better with treatment of baseline IFI, especially in cases with 
aspergillosis. So you accepted caspo as AI. I would like to ask that how 
many people in your group accept the caspo as the first choice agent for 
the treatment of IA.  
I think initially the committee must vote for the value of the fever based 
treatment of IA and made a recommendation for this kind of approach 
even by using data of the C cordonier, Girmenia and L pagano studies. 
Even recommendations in this table have great discrepancies with figure 1 
which is the guideline group’s recommended diagnostic approach. 
We did not vote on caspofungin 
first line, and there are arguments 
and data to support its use.

CT imaging is one of the most important diagnostic tool for IA, as 
guideline group made a strong recommendation on it (AII). CT is also 
noticed as major determinant of therapy in Figure 1. 
I think it is necessary to add another table to table 2 or somewhere else, 
and make recommendations or grading on CT findings of invasive 
aspergillosis (nodule with or without halo, cavity,  etc). 
We need a recommendation on frequency of CT imaging too (2 weeks etc 
?) 
And also we need recommendations on therapeutic success or failure 
indicators in CT imaging especially for pulmonary aspergillosis:  for clinical 
studies there are definitions for success, stable or progressive disease as 
ref 201. 
Very challenging, but it is indeed 
separate papers we work on. The 
paper for public consultation is the 
executive summary only.
