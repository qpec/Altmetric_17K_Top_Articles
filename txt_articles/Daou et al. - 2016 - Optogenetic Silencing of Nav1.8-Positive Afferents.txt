Abstract
We report a novel transgenic mouse model in which the terminals of peripheral nociceptors can be silenced
optogenetically with high spatiotemporal precision, leading to the alleviation of inflammatory and neuropathic
pain. Inhibitory archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) proton pumps were delivered to Nav1.8� primary afferents using the
Nav1.8-Cre driver line. Arch expression covered both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors and yellow light
stimulation reliably blocked electrically induced action potentials in DRG neurons. Acute transdermal illumination
of the hindpaws of Nav1.8-Arch� mice significantly reduced mechanical allodynia under inflammatory conditions,
while basal mechanical sensitivity was not affected by the optical stimulation. Arch-driven hyperpolarization of
nociceptive terminals was sufficient to prevent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated mechanical and thermal
hypersensitivity in double-transgenic Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mice. Furthermore, prolonged optical silencing of
peripheral afferents in anesthetized Nav1.8-Arch� mice led to poststimulation analgesia with a significant
decrease in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity under inflammatory and neuropathic conditions. These
findings highlight the role of peripheral neuronal inputs in the onset and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity,
demonstrate the plasticity of pain pathways even after sensitization has occurred, and support the involvement
of Nav1.8� afferents in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Together, we present a selective analgesic
approach in which genetically identified subsets of peripheral sensory fibers can be remotely and optically
inhibited with high temporal resolution, overcoming the compensatory limitations of genetic ablations.

Significance Statement
Selective activation and/or inhibition of peripheral nociceptors allow us to control pain transmission and
modulate pain perception. Here, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line in which optical activation of
archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) proton pumps efficiently silenced the activity of Nav1.8� nociceptive afferents.
Acute and prolonged transdermal illumination of the hindpaws of Nav1.8-Arch� mice reduced mechanical
and thermal hypersensitivity under inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, underlining the contribution of
the peripheral neuronal component, particularly Nav1.8� fibers, in the transmission of evoked pain as well
as the development and maintenance of chronic pain. This optogenetic approach can be applied to
functionally investigate other subsets of sensory neurons with high temporal precision, and safe genetic
delivery of inhibitory opsins may prove useful for clinical applications.

 Introduction
Nociceptors are the primary transducers of noxious
and/or potentially damaging stimuli from the periphery to
the CNS. Nav1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel ex-
pressed in this subpopulation of primary sensory neurons
(Shields et al., 2012). Nav1.8 channels play an important
role in the generation and propagation of action poten-
tials, thus altering their activity affects neuronal excitability
(Garrison et al., 2014; Han et al., 2016). Moreover, Nav1.8-
expressing neurons have been identified as major players
in pain onset and hypersensitivity under chronic condi-
tions. Pharmacological and genetic tools have been used
either to interfere with Nav1.8 channel functionality (Laird
et al., 2002; Gaida et al., 2005; Jarvis et al., 2007; Yu et al.,
2011) or to ablate the Nav1.8� population in order to
assess its role in a variety of pain conditions (Abrahamsen
et al., 2008). These studies confirmed the involvement of
this neuronal population in pain hypersensitivity under
inflammatory conditions, while its role in neuropathic pain
has remained controversial (Gaida et al., 2005; Nassar
et al., 2005; Villarreal et al., 2005; Joshi et al., 2006; Jarvis
et al., 2007; Abrahamsen et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2011).
Pharmacological approaches lack temporal control
over drug activity, and target selectivity is a challenge due
to the high homology between subtypes of voltage-gated
sodium channels. Genetic tools such as knockouts and
ablation strategies do not account for compensation at
the cellular and circuit levels.
An optogenetic approach might fill these gaps, ensuring
a precise spatiotemporal control of the activity of Nav1.8-
expressing neurons and allowing a peripheral interference
with nociceptive transduction. In rats, the expression of
archaerhodopsin-3T (ArchT) pumps in the fast-conducting
myelinated A-� high-threshold mechanoreceptors allowed
the silencing of these fibers, showing their involvement in
withdrawal behaviors under normal and neuropathic (par-
tial sciatic nerve ligation) conditions (Boada et al., 2014).
In mice, optical activation of ArchT pumps, expressed
under the control of the transient receptor potential vanil-
loid 1 promoter, resulted in reduced mechanical and ther-
mal sensitivities under normal conditions (Li et al., 2015).
However, the latter study did not investigate the analgesic
effect of ArchT activation under chronic pain conditions.
In another study (Iyer et al., 2014), following viral delivery
of halorhodopsin (NpHR) pumps to a subset of small-
diameter C-fiber neurons, transdermal yellow light illu-
mination increased sensory thresholds under normal
conditions and decreased pain hypersensitivity caused by
chronic constriction injury (CCI). Yet, NpHR-mediated an-
algesia was assessed only in the CCI model, and the
neuronal population transduced by the virus was not
genetically defined.
Based on our Nav1.8-ChR2� mouse model (Daou et al.,
2013) using the Nav1.8-Cre knock-in construct (Stirling
et al., 2005), we specifically delivered inhibitory opsins to
Nav1.8� neurons to silence the activity of their peripheral
terminals with high temporal precision, to assess their
involvement in several pain conditions without any abla-
tion, and to validate the analgesic potential of optogenetic
actuators. Following the functional assessment of Arch
pumps in vitro, acute and prolonged transdermal yellow
light stimulation of the hindpaws of Nav1.8-Arch� mice
were used to evaluate Arch-mediated analgesia under
inflammatory and neuropathic conditions. Our results
show that acute blockade of Nav1.8� terminals reduces
pain transmission, and that prolonged inhibition of periph-
eral input causes short-term analgesia outlasting the op-
tical stimulation. Both strategies support the involvement
of Nav1.8� afferents in inflammatory and neuropathic
pain, and the latter highlights the plasticity of the nocice-
ptive circuit under sensitized conditions. This optogenetic
approach provides useful tools to interrogate specific
components of the peripheral sensory pathways as well
as a promising basis for gene therapy to treat chronic
pain.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and mouse lines
Five- to sixteen-week-old C57BL/6 mice of both sexes,
weighing 20–35 g, were used in this study. All animal
procedures were performed in accordance with the
McGill University Animal Care Committee regulations. Ho-
mozygous Nav1.8-Cre mice (Stirling et al., 2005) were
crossed with homozygous Ai35 mice (The Jackson Lab-
oratory) carrying the floxed stop-Arch-EGFP gene in the
ROSA26 locus (Madisen et al., 2012), to generate the
Nav1.8-Arch� mouse line. Similarly, mice carrying Tau-
EGFP in the ROSA26 locus (from Dr. Ulrich Boehm, Uni-
versity of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany) were crossed
with homozygous Nav1.8-Cre mice to generate Nav1.8-
Tau� control mice. Heterozygous Nav1.8-ChR2� mice
were crossed with homozygous Ai35 mice to generate the
Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� double-transgenic mouse line.
Immunofluorescence
Mice were intracardially perfused with 50 ml of saline
(0.9% NaCl), followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 30
min. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), spinal cord, and glabrous
skin were extracted and postfixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at
4°C. Tissue was then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in

 PBS overnight at 4°C. To study the spinal cord and gla-
brous skin, 40-�m-thick sections were cut at �20°C us-
ing a cryostat (Leica). All sections were collected as free
floating in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). As
for the DRGs, sectioning at 14 �m thickness was per-
formed directly onto gelatin-subbed slides. Sections were
initially permeabilized with 50% ethanol for 30 min fol-
lowed by 1 min of incubation in a 0.3% hydrogen peroxide
solution. Sections were washed in PBS-T for 30 min
between all incubations. Nonspecific binding of the sec-
ondary antibody was blocked by pretreating the sections
for 1 h at room temperature in 10% normal goat and
donkey serum (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS. The sections
were then incubated at 4°C for 24 h with a rabbit anti-
calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP) antibody (Sigma-
Aldrich) and a guinea pig anti-purinoceptor P2X3 antibody
(Neuromics) at a dilution of 1:2000 and 1:25,000, respec-
tively. After several rinses in PBS-T, sections were incu-
bated for 90 min at room temperature with a biotin-
conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS, followed by fur-
ther signal amplification via tyramide (1:75; PerkinElmer)
for 7 min. The sections were incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with a mixture of streptavidin conjugated to
Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200; Molecular Probes) and highly
cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 647 (1:800; Molecular Probes) in 5% normal goat
and donkey serum in PBS-T. Finally, the sections were
washed, mounted on gelatin-subbed slides (spinal cord
and glabrous skin), air dried, and coverslipped with
antifading mounting medium (Aqua PolyMount, Poly-
sciences). Slides were stored at 4°C until examination
under a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope.
Cell culture and DRG preparation
DRGs were extracted from adult Nav1.8-Arch� mice or
adult Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mice and kept in sterile ice-
cold 1� HBSS (Invitrogen) throughout the dissection.
DRGs were then incubated in 5 ml of HBSS containing 1.4
mg/ml dispase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.1 mg/ml collage-
nase type II (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37°C. Following
the enzymatic reaction, DRGs were washed twice with 10
ml of culture media [F-12 media (Invitrogen), containing
10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% strep-
tomycin] and then mechanically triturated using fire-
polished Pasteur pipettes. The dissociated neurons were
finally plated onto five 35 mm culture dishes (2 ml/dish;
Sarstedt) previously coated with laminin (BD Biosciences)
and poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated
for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 prior to electrophysiological
recording.
Whole-cell electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on DRG neurons
were conducted at room temperature, 24 h after plating.
The internal solution (pH 7.2) of the pipette contained the
following (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5
EGTA, 3 MgATP, and 0.4 GTP. The bath solution, pH 7.4,
contained the following (in mM): 152 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2,
1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose. Patch pipettes had
a tip resistance of 5–10 M�. Electrophysiological record-
ings were conducted using an Axopatch 200B amplifier,
digitized with a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instru-
ments). Traces were acquired and analyzed using pClamp
8.2 software (Axon Instruments). Recordings were low-
pass filtered at 2 and 5 KHz in voltage- and current-clamp
configurations, respectively. Multimode optic fibers (200
�m diameter; Thorlabs), coupled to diode-pumped solid-
state lasers of specific wavelengths (473 nm blue laser,
Laserglow Technologies; or 589 nm yellow laser, Dragon
Lasers), were used for optical stimulation of DRG neu-
rons. Stimulation parameters are specified in each condi-
tion. Light intensities were measured using a PM100A
power meter coupled to a S130C photodiode sensor
(Thorlabs) and analyzed using LabVIEW 8.5 software.
Behavioral experiments under normal and
inflammatory conditions
Due to the nature of the experiments, particularly the
use of visible light, trials were not conducted blindly. Mice
were habituated for 1 h prior to testing. Thermal sensitivity
was measured using the radiant heat paw-withdrawal
test. A blue filter (True Blue #196, Lee Filters) was placed
on the light source to filter out the orange-yellow compo-
nent and prevent nonspecific activation of Arch pumps.
Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using an automated
von Frey fiber (dynamic plantar aesthesiometer, Ugo
Basile) applied to the mid-plantar hindpaw. The non-
treated hindpaw was used as a control.
The analgesic effect of acute optical stimulation was
assessed under normal and inflammatory conditions.
Yellow light was applied to the plantar surface of the
hindpaw simultaneously with the mechanical or thermal
stimulus. The light was administered continuously using
a 1 mm optic fiber (Prizmatix) coupled to a 589 nm
laser.
Two inflammatory conditions were used to assess the
effect of yellow light stimulation on mechanical hyper-
sensitivity in Nav1.8-Arch� mice, as follows: an intra-
dermal injection of 10 �l of capsaicin (0.05%; Sigma-
Aldrich) into the right hindpaw, leading to mechanical
allodynia lasting at least 60 min postinjection, and an
intraplantar injection of 20 �l of zymosan (1 mg/ml;
Sigma-Aldrich) into the left hindpaw, leading to me-
chanical allodynia lasting up to 24 h postinjection. Con-
trol Nav1.8-Arch� mice were injected with inflammatory
compounds, but no optical stimulation was applied
while assessing mechanical sensitivity.
To test the effect of prolonged silencing of Nav1.8�
fibers on inflammatory pain, mechanical and thermal sen-
sitivities were assessed before and after a prolonged (1 h)
yellow light stimulation of the injected hindpaw. The hour-
long stimulations were conducted under 2% isoflurane
anesthesia with a 3 s ON, 1 s OFF pulsing frequency. The
light beam (0.3–0.45 mW/mm2) covered the entire plantar
surface. Control Nav1.8-Arch� mice were injected with the
inflammatory compound and placed under isoflurane for
1 h without any optical stimulation. Mechanical and ther-
mal measurements were taken at least 1 h poststimulation
to give the mice enough time to recover from anesthesia.
An intraplantar injection of 20 �l zymosan (1 mg/ml) was

 used to investigate the mechanical modality, while an
intraplantar injection of 25 �l of emulsified complete
Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; 0.5 mg/ml; EMD Millipore) was
used to study the thermal modality, because CFA pro-
duced more consistent and reproducible thermal hyper-
sensitivity than zymosan. Zymosan-induced mechanical
hypersensitivity was measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h
postinjection, while CFA-mediated thermal hypersensitiv-
ity was assessed at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h postinjection.
Behavioral testing on the double-opsin mouse line
To determine whether yellow light can prevent blue
light-induced ChR2-mediated hypersensitivity, the left
hindpaw of Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mice was stimulated
either with blue light alone (“Ipsi-Blue”) or with blue and
yellow light simultaneously (“Ipsi-Blue � Yellow”) (blue, 2
Hz at 2.3 mW/mm2; yellow, 3 s ON, 1 s OFF at 0.3–0.45
mW/mm2; 30 min for mechanical, 1 h for thermal). Ther-
mal and mechanical sensitivities were measured before,
and 1, 3, and 24 h post-stimulation. All stimulations were
performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and right hind-
paws were used as controls.
Spared nerve injury and mechanical allodynia
Six-week-old mice were deeply anesthetized using 2%
isoflurane. The left anterior thigh of the animal was shaved
and disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. To induce
the spared nerve injury (SNI) neuropathy, an incision was
made through the anterior surface of the left thigh to
expose the sciatic nerve at the trifurcation level. The
common peroneal and tibial nerves were tightly ligated
with 6.0 silk and sectioned distal to the ligation. The sural
nerve was left intact. Sham surgery involved exposing the
nerve without damaging it. The skin was closed using
interrupted sutures (6.0 silk). A 1 ml subcutaneous saline
injection (0.9%) was administered to replenish fluids, and
the mouse recovered on a heating pad until it was ambu-
latory and was then returned to the cage. An eye ointment
(Tears Naturale PM) was applied to keep the eyes lubri-
cated during the procedure.
Mechanical sensitivity of both hindpaws was measured
up to 9 weeks postsurgery, using von Frey monofilaments
(Stoelting). Monofilaments allow the precise targeting of
the lateral part of the hindpaw. At 3, 4, 6, and 9 weeks
postsurgery, the neuropathic paw was exposed to a pro-
longed (1 h, 3 s ON, 1 s OFF, 0.3-0.45 mW/mm2) yellow
light stimulation under 2% isoflurane anesthesia (“SNI-
Light”). Mechanical sensitivity was measured up to 24 h
poststimulation. To control for the isoflurane effect, neu-
ropathic Nav1.8-Arch� mice were placed under isoflurane
for 1 h without optical stimulation (“SNI-Iso”). To control
for any nonspecific yellow light effect, sham Nav1.8-Arch�
mice were submitted to the same optical stimulation as
the neuropathic mice, and their mechanical sensitivity
was followed over a similar time course poststimulation.
Statistical analysis
All data are represented as the mean � SEM. All sta-
tistical tests were performed in GraphPad Prism version 6,
and statistical significance was set at p � 0.05.
For testing under normal conditions, measurements on
both hindpaws were combined and averaged across an-
imals for each intensity/stimulation paradigm. Compari-
son was performed with the baseline measurements
using the paired Student’s t test (Table 1).
For experiments with the double-opsin mice and all the
inflammatory tests (capsaicin, zymosan, CFA), data were
averaged for each hindpaw at each time point across
animals, and comparison was performed between the
“Ipsi-Light” (ipsilateral hindpaws stimulated optically) and
“Ipsi-Control” (ipsilateral hindpaws not stimulated) condi-
tions (for inflammatory tests) and between “Ipsi-Blue” and
“Ipsi-Blue � Yellow” (for double-opsin experiments) at
each time point, using repeated-measures two-way
ANOVA followed by the Sidak post hoc test (Tables 2, 3).
Regarding the SNI experiments, data were averaged for
each hindpaw at each time point across animals, and
comparisons were performed between the “SNI-Light”
and “SNI-Iso” conditions, using repeated-measures two-
way ANOVA followed by the Sidak post hoc test
(Tables 2, 3), and between each post-light (“Post”) time
point and before light (“Pre”) in the SNI-Light group, using
repeated-measures one-way ANOVA followed by the
Dunnett’s post hoc test (Tables 4, 5).
Results
Distribution and functionality of Arch-EGFP in
sensory pathways
To assess the expression profile of transgenic Arch-
EGFP pumps in the peripheral pathways of Nav1.8-Arch�
mice, we determined their colocalization with the pepti-
dergic and nonpeptidergic markers CGRP and P2X3, re-
spectively. In DRG neurons, almost all P2X3- and CGRP-
immunopositive cells were EGFP-positive, with the P2X3
and CGRP signals being mutually exclusive (Fig. 1A).
EGFP fluorescence was further detected in superficial
laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, indicating
the efficient trafficking of Arch pumps to their central
targets. It colocalized with CGRP labeling in laminae I and
IIo, and P2X3 labeling in lamina IIi, and extended ventrally
to lamina III, which is innervated by myelinated fibers (Fig.
1B). Transgenic opsins were effectively transported to the
periphery, where EGFP fluorescence overlapped with
P2X3 and CGRP labeling in the deep and superficial layers
of the glabrous skin bordering the dermal–epidermal
junction (Fig. 1C).
The functionality of Arch-EGFP was then tested in cul-
tured
DRG
neurons.

 nm) stimulation, leading to significant and reproducible
membrane hyperpolarizations (�24.15 � 3.51 mV; Fig.
1D). Light-evoked hyperpolarizations were sufficient to
block electrically induced action potentials in DRG neu-
rons (Fig. 1E), showing the ability of Arch pumps to inhibit
Nav1.8� nociceptor activity in vitro. Taking a closer look at
Arch-mediated photocurrents, we detected small inward
currents at the beginning of light application (Fig. 1D, left).
However, these acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC)-like cur-
rents (Zeng et al., 2015) did not translate into depolariza-
tion, as shown in the current-clamp trace (Fig. 1D, right).
Also, both the size and duration of the depolarizing
currents were significantly smaller than those of the Arch-
mediated photocurrents and hyperpolarizations. Alto-
gether, although a decrease in extracellular pH can be
depolarizing, the overall effect of optical stimulations is
inhibitory.
Analgesic effects of acute optical stimulation
in vivo
We next tested whether acute optical silencing of Nav1.8�
afferents interferes with sensory perception in behaving
Nav1.8-Arch� mice. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed
under normal and inflammatory conditions. Transdermal
yellow light illumination of the hindpaw was applied simul-
taneously with the mechanical stimulus. We found that
mechanical thresholds were not altered under normal
conditions, using a range of light intensities (0.25-0.43
mW/mm2; Fig. 2A; n � 8–17 mice/condition; paired Stu-
dent’s t test used to compare “No light” vs “0.25 mW/
mm2” measurements, p � 0.0707a; Table 1). However,
optical stimulation (0.25 mW/mm2) significantly reduced
capsaicin- and zymosan-induced mechanical allodynia
[Fig. 2B,C; for capsaicin, n � 6 mice/condition, compar-
ison between Ipsi-Light and Ipsi-Control was performed
using repeated-measures two-way ANOVAb (Table 2); fol-
lowed by the Sidak multiple-comparisons test at 30 min,
p � 0.0018k; and at 60 min, p � 0.0424k (Table 3); for
zymosan, n � 12–13 mice/condition, comparison be-
tween Ipsi-Light and Ipsi-Control was performed using
repeated-measures two-way ANOVAc (Table 2); followed
by the Sidak multiple-comparisons test at 2 h, p �
0.0001l; at 4 h, p � 0.0104l; and at 6 h, p � 0.0036l
(Table 3)], indicating effective Arch-mediated analgesia
under inflammatory conditions. These findings are con-
sistent with the role of Nav1.8� neurons in mediating
inflammatory pain but not in setting basal mechanical
sensitivity under normal conditions (Abrahamsen et al.,
2008).
The effect of acute yellow light stimulation on the ther-
mal modality was also investigated. Unfortunately, simul-
taneous application of laser light with the light from the
Hargreaves device increased thermal sensitivity in an
intensity-dependent manner (data not shown). This was
also the case on control Nav1.8-Tau� mice, showing that
this effect is Arch-independent (data not shown). This is
most likely due to additive heating, making this approach
inappropriate to assess Arch-mediated analgesia for the
thermal modality.
The analgesic effect observed under inflammation was
significant but partial. This can be due to insufficient
Arch-driven hyperpolarizations of peripheral afferents to
completely block nociceptive transmission. Alternatively,
the absence of Arch expression in subpopulations of
sensitized terminals may explain the partial reversal of
mechanical allodynia. For instance, the presence of Arch-
negative nociceptors would allow the transduction and
transmission of nociceptive inputs from the periphery de-
spite the optical stimulation. Furthermore, low-threshold
A� mechanoreceptors play an essential role in mediating
mechanical
allodynia
under
inflammatory
conditions.
Thus, the absence of Arch pumps in these fibers enables
them to normally transmit mechanical stimuli to the CNS,
accounting, at least partially, for the pain hypersensitivity.
Another factor that could explain this partial analgesia is a
limited penetration of light into the skin, leading to incom-
plete inhibition of deeper primary afferent terminals. To
address these possibilities, we generated the double-
opsin Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mice, in which ChR2 chan-
nels and Arch pumps are coexpressed in the same
Nav1.8� neurons, overcoming the limitation of having
Arch-negative sensitized terminals. Also, the use of blue
light to induce and yellow light to prevent sensitization
ensures the targeting of the same afferents since both
stimuli have the same physical nature. We have shown
that prolonged blue light stimulation of the hindpaw of
anesthetized Nav1.8-ChR2� mice induces mechanical as
well as thermal hypersensitivity lasting up to 24 h post-
stimulation (Daou et al., 2013). Using either blue light
alone or blue and yellow light together on Nav1.8-ChR2�-
Arch� mice, we assessed the ability of Arch pumps to
prevent ChR2-mediated hypersensitivity. When used
alone, blue light induced a significant reduction in with-
drawal thresholds and latencies lasting up to 24 h; how-
ever, this sensitization was completely prevented in the
presence of yellow light in both mechanical and thermal
modalities [Fig. 2D,E; for mechanical, n � 6–12 mice/
condition: comparison between Ipsi-Blue and Ipsi-Blue �
Yellow was performed using repeated-measures two-way
ANOVAd (Table 2); followed by the Sidak multiple-
comparisons test, at 1 h, p � 0.0034m; and at 3 h, p �
0.0215m (Table 3); for thermal, n � 6–13 mice/condition:

consistent with our in vitro recordings in cultured DRG
neurons from Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mice, in which Arch-
mediated hyperpolarizations suppressed ChR2-induced ac-
tion potentials in the same neurons (Fig. 2F). These
findings support the effectiveness of Arch pumps in si-
lencing peripheral afferents and preventing the onset of
sensitization when expressed with high penetrance in the
target neurons. Also, the Nav1.8-ChR2�-Arch� mouse
line provides a transgenic model in which Nav1.8� neu-
rons can be bidirectionally controlled with high spatiotem-
poral precision.

 Prolonged silencing of Nav1.8� afferents leads to
poststimulation analgesia
We further tested the effect of a prolonged inhibition of
peripheral sensory pathways on inflammatory and neuro-
pathic pain hypersensitivity. Anesthetized Nav1.8-Arch�
mice were subjected to hour-long yellow light stimulations
at different time points after the induction of inflammation
or nerve injury. Mechanical thresholds and thermal laten-
cies were measured at least 1 h after light exposure. This
approach allowed us to overcome the complications re-
sulting from the simultaneous application of yellow light
and thermal stimulus, and to assess the analgesic effects
of prolonged peripheral silencing.
Under zymosan-induced inflammation, optical stimula-
tion delayed the onset of mechanical allodynia when ap-
plied right after injection, while it caused a significant and
transient reduction of allodynia when applied 2 and 4 h
after zymosan injection (Fig. 3A, left, n � 7 mice/condi-

mice/condition). In all panels, comparison between Ipsi-
Light and Ipsi-Control was performed using repeated-
measures two-way ANOVAf,g,h (Table 2) followed by the
Sidak multiple-comparisons test (Fig. 3A, left: at 2 h, p �

0.0001p; right, at 6 h, p � 0.0007q; Table 3). In the latter
cases, the analgesia peaked at 1 h and returned to control
levels 3 h after optical stimulation.
Arch-mediated analgesia was milder when evaluating
thermal hypersensitivity under CFA-induced inflamma-
tion. No analgesia was detected when light was applied
right after CFA injection, yet, a transitory increase in ther-
mal latencies was measured when light was applied 24 h
postinjection [Fig. 3B, right; n � 7 mice/condition; com-
parison between Ipsi-Light and Ipsi-Control was per-
formed
using

two-way
ANOVAi
(Table 2); followed by the Sidak multiple-comparisons
test, at 24 (�1) h, p � 0.0331r (Table 3)]. No redness,
edema, or sign of neurogenic inflammation was detected
following hour-long stimulations of the hindpaw. Further-
more, prolonged exposure to yellow light did not alter
thermal sensitivity of naive Nav1.8-Arch� mice (Fig. 3C).
Also, the effect of yellow light under hyperalgesic condi-
tions (CFA) was controlled for using the control transgenic
Nav1.8-Tau� mouse line, where CFA-injected Nav1.8-
Tau� mice were exposed to hour-long light exposure 24 h
postinjection. No effects on CFA-mediated thermal hyper-
sensitivity were detected in these mice (data not shown),
indicating that the transitory effect observed in Nav1.8-
Arch� mice (Fig. 3B, right) is Arch-mediated.
The partial reversal in both mechanical and thermal
modalities can be attributed to (1) the possibility that
Arch-negative afferents play an important role in the onset
and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, (2) the incom-
plete blockade of peripheral inputs due to limited light
penetration or potency of the stimulus, and/or (3) central
sensitization mechanisms independent of peripheral in-
puts.
To investigate whether Arch pumps desensitize during
prolonged optical stimulations, we conducted in vitro re-
cordings on cultured DRG neurons from Nav1.8-Arch�
mice, using the same stimulation protocol (3 s ON, 1 s
OFF) as that used in vivo. Ten-minute-long recordings
under sustained optical stimulation showed that Arch-
mediated hyperpolarizations are consistent and replicable
over time, indicating that (1) prolonged illumination does
not alter the activity and recovery of Arch pumps (Fig. 3D),
and (2) neuronal excitability and input resistance remained
unchanged. This further suggests that the analgesic ef-
fects observed in behavioral experiments are not due to
the decreased excitability of peripheral afferents but
rather to central plasticity where the blockade of periph-
eral inputs to the spinal cord reduces central sensitization,
leading to decreased pain hypersensitivity.

 Using the SNI model to produce a neuropathic condi-
tion, we tested whether prolonged inhibition of Nav1.8�
fibers can reduce mechanical allodynia. Hour-long illumi-
nations of the hindpaw markedly decreased mechanical
hypersensitivity at 3, 4, and 6 weeks after SNI surgery,
with a transient effect lasting up to 24 h poststimulation

and gradually decreased at 4 and 6 weeks after SNI (Fig.

optical stimulation was applied 9 weeks after SNI (data
not shown), indicating that the peripheral inhibition of
Nav1.8� nociceptors becomes less efficient in reducing
mechanical pain at later stages of neuropathy. By show-

 ing that silencing the activity of their peripheral terminals
alleviates mechanical allodynia, especially at the early
stages of neuropathy, these results clearly demonstrate
the involvement of Nav1.8� nociceptors in SNI-induced
neuropathic pain.
Discussion
Taking advantage of the Nav1.8-Cre mouse line, we de-
livered the inhibitory pump Arch to Nav1.8� afferents,
generating a novel transgenic model in which interference
with peripheral nociceptive transmission can be optoge-
netically achieved with high spatiotemporal precision.
This silencing strategy allowed us to specifically manipu-
late the Nav1.8� neuronal subpopulation while overcom-
ing the compensatory effects encountered using other
genetic strategies such as knockdowns, knockouts, or
cell ablation.
The Nav1.8� population covers peptidergic and non-
peptidergic nociceptors as well as a subset of low-
threshold mechanoreceptors. Under inflammatory and
neuropathic conditions, central sensitization and plasticity
as well as disinhibition in the spinal cord occur; input from
low-threshold A� fibers can now be relayed to nociceptive
circuits in the dorsal horn, leading to pain perception. This
phenomenon accounts, at least partially, for the mechan-
ical allodynia in chronic pain conditions. Thus, optoge-
netic silencing of Nav1.8� myelinated A-fibers would
further reduce pain hypersensitivity, which is in accor-
dance with the analgesic effects we observe.
Acute yellow light illumination of the hindpaws of
Nav1.8-Arch� mice did not alter their mechanical thresh-
olds under normal conditions. These results fit with those
showing that von Frey thresholds were unaffected when
the whole Nav1.8� subpopulation of neurons was elimi-
nated (Abrahamsen et al., 2008), indicating that these
neurons are not essential in setting basal mechanical
sensitivity. The same transdermal optical stimulation re-
duced mechanical allodynia induced by capsaicin and
zymosan, demonstrating that a brief and acute silenc-
ing of Nav1.8� fibers is sufficient to alleviate inflammatory
pain. Furthermore, a prolonged inhibition of Nav1.8� af-
ferents delayed the onset and/or transiently reduced in-
flammatory mechanical allodynia. This shows that Arch-

 mediated
inhibition
of
the
terminals
of
peripheral
nociceptors is effective in decreasing inflammatory pain,
confirming the involvement of the Nav1.8� subpopulation
in mediating hypersensitivity under inflammatory condi-
tions. The mechanisms of inhibition in the two stimulation
protocols may be different: under acute light stimulation,
analgesia may be mediated by direct hyperpolarization
of the sensory fibers transducing the mechanical stim-
ulus since both stimuli are applied simultaneously; follow-
ing long illumination, synaptic changes in the spinal
circuitry may occur due to peripheral silencing of nocice-
ptive inputs, leading to decreased central sensitization
and reduced allodynia. Hour-long yellow light stimulations
of CFA-injected Nav1.8-Arch� mice led to a transitory
increase in thermal latencies when applied 24 h postin-
jection, but not right after injection. These findings indi-
cate that Arch pumps are not capable of blocking or
delaying the onset of CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia.
This apparent discrepancy with the zymosan results might
be explained by the difference in the sensory modality
investigated or by the strength of the CFA stimulation that
could not be reversed as effectively.
Under neuropathic conditions, the role of Nav1.8� neu-
rons remained unclear (Nassar et al., 2005; Joshi et al.,
2006; Jarvis et al., 2007; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). Using
the SNI model, we showed that prolonged hyperpolariza-
tion of Nav1.8� afferents produces a significant and tran-
sient alleviation of mechanical allodynia at 3 and 4 weeks
after surgery, proving the contribution of the Nav1.8�
population and demonstrating the analgesic effectiveness
of our optogenetic strategy in neuropathic pain. Analgesia
may be explained by Arch-mediated blockade of the
spontaneous hyperactivity of peripheral nociceptors, pre-
sumably leading to a modified sensitivity of their terminals
and/or altered spinal connectivity affecting central sensi-
tization. Interestingly, the analgesic effect of yellow light
decreased over time after surgery, suggesting that pe-
ripheral inputs in general, and specifically inputs from the
Nav1.8� population, are not essential for the maintenance
of mechanical allodynia.
Arch pumps extrude protons from the cell. This can lead
to changes in intracellular and/or extracellular pH affect-
ing neuronal activity. Previous reports have shown that
changes in intracellular pH (pHi) following Arch activation
in cultured neurons do not exceed 0.1–0.15 U. Alkaliniza-
tion of the intracellular space is very limited, most likely
due to intrinsic stabilization mechanisms in the neuron
(e.g., transporters, exchangers), preventing the develop-
ment of proton gradients and a further increase in pHi
(Chow et al., 2010, 2012). Furthermore, during in vivo
recordings in mice and macaques, spike waveform and
frequency were not affected before and after prolonged
(several minutes) Arch-mediated inhibition (Chow et al.,
2012). Extracellularly, proton efflux can lead to a transient
decrease in pH and therefore the activation of proton-
gated channels. A recent study (Zeng et al., 2015) showed
that Arch activation induces ASIC currents in HEK293
cells and cortical neurons overexpressing ASIC1a. This
was detected as an inward deflection in voltage-clamp
recordings in vitro under green light illumination. These
inward currents were also detected in our DRG recordings
under yellow light stimulation, yet their amplitudes were
smaller and did not cause any significant depolarization.
This difference in current size is normal since the levels of
expression of endogenous acid-sensitive channels are
lower than those observed in overexpression systems.
Thus, although the decrease in extracellular pH can be
sensitizing for peripheral terminals, the overall effect of
the optical stimulations is analgesic, indicating that the
inhibitory component of Arch activation overcomes any
sensitizing or excitatory effect of transient acid-evoked
currents.
In conclusion, the Nav1.8-Arch� mouse line represents
a constitutive model in which silencing of peripheral no-
ciceptors is achieved remotely with high spatiotemporal
precision. We can predict that such an optogenetic ap-
proach will be implemented using next-generation inhib-
itory opsins such as ChloC (Wietek et al., 2014) or the
newly identified GtACR anion channels (Govorunova
et al., 2015), possibly leading to more pronounced anal-
gesia. Moreover, considering the large heterogeneity of
sensory neurons revealed by recent molecular profiling
studies (Goswami et al., 2014; Flegel et al., 2015; Usoskin
et al., 2015), our silencing strategy will be beneficial for
selective targeting and functional interrogation of other
subsets of sensory neurons, including non-nociceptive
populations. Selective delivery of inhibitory opsins to ge-
netically identified neurons will allow the control of pain
circuits in vivo, setting the stage for a potential use in
humans for the treatment of intractable chronic pain.
