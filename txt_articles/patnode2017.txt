IMPORTANCE Unhealthful dietary patterns, low levels of physical activity, and high sedentary
time increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of behavioral
counseling for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults without known
cardiovascular risk factors to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
PsycINFO for studies published in the English language between January 1, 2013, and May 25,
2016, and ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through March 24, 2017. Studies
included in the previous review were reevaluated for inclusion.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions targeting improved
diet, increased physical activity, decreased sedentary time, or a combination of these among
adults without known hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction
by 2 reviewers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiometabolic health and intermediate outcomes,
behavioral outcomes, and harms related to interventions.
RESULTS Eighty-eight studies (N = 121 190) in 145 publications were included. There was no
consistent benefit of the interventions on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity
(4 trials [n = 51 356]) or health-related quality of life (10 trials [n = 52 423]). There was evidence
of small, statistically significant between-group mean differences for systolic blood pressure
(−1.26 mm Hg [95% CI, −1.77 to −0.75]; 22 trials [n = 57 953]), diastolic blood pressure
(−0.49 mm Hg [95% CI, −0.82 to −0.16]; 23 trials [n = 58 022]), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level (−2.58 mg/dL [95% CI, −4.30 to −0.85]; 13 trials [n = 5554]), total cholesterol
level (−2.85 mg/dL [95% CI, −4.95 to −0.75]; 19 trials [n = 9325]), and body mass index (−0.41
[95% CI, −0.62 to −0.19]; 20 trials [n = 55 059]) at 6 to 12 months as well as small-to-modest
associations with dietary and physical activity behaviors. There was no evidence of greater
incidence of serious adverse events, injuries, or falls in intervention vs control participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Diet and physical activity behavioral interventions for adults
not at high risk for cardiovascular disease result in consistent modest benefits across a variety
of important intermediate health outcomes across 6 to 12 months, including blood pressure,
low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels, and adiposity, with evidence of a
dose-response effect, with higher-intensity interventions conferring greater improvements.
There is very limited evidence on longer-term intermediate and health outcomes or on
harmful effects of these interventions.

espiteevidencethathealthfuldietarypatterns,physicalac-
tivity, and limited sedentary time are associated with re-
duced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,1-4 most US
adults are not meeting national recommendations for these
behaviors.5 Counseling within primary care and interventions re-
ferredthroughprimarycaremaybeonestrategytoimprovethesebe-
haviors and subsequently prevent poor cardiovascular outcomes.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has several
recommendations related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) preven-
tion, including guidance on healthy lifestyle counseling6,7; screen-
ing and treatment for obesity,8 hypertension,9 and abnormal
blood glucose levels10; aspirin11 and statin12 use; and tobacco ces-
sation interventions.12 The purpose of this review was to update
the USPSTF review on the benefits and harms of behavioral coun-
seling interventions for healthful diet, physical activity, and/or sed-
entary behavior for the primary prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease among adults without known CVD or those with known
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose.
This review will help the USPSTF update their 2012 C grade recom-
mendation that clinicians may choose to selectively counsel adults
about healthful diet and physical activity.7
Methods
Scope of Review
This review addressed 4 key questions (KQs) as shown in Figure 1.
Methodological details (including study selection, a list of
excluded studies, and description of data analyses), as well as
more detailed results (including detailed descriptions of all of the
interventions and data on effect modification and subpopulation
results), are publicly available in the full evidence report at https:

Data Sources and Searches
This review was designed as an extension of 2 prior systematic
reviews conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates
Evidence-based Practice Center for the USPSTF that focused on
healthful diet and physical activity counseling for cardiovascular
disease prevention among individuals with14 and without15 known
CVD risk factors (ie, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or
impaired fasting glucose). As such, relevant studies from those
reviews were reevaluated for potential inclusion. Then, the follow-
ing databases were searched for new relevant English-language lit-
erature published between January 1, 2013, and May 25, 2016:
MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher-supplied records only), PsycINFO,
and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (eMethods
in the Supplement). Collectively, the literature searches encom-
passed literature published from 1966 through May 25, 2016. The
database searches were supplemented by reviewing bibliogra-
phies from other relevant literature and from expert suggestions.
ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials.
Since May 2016, ongoing surveillance was conducted using
searches of a subset of core clinical journals identified by the
USPSTF to identify major studies published in the interim that may
affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and there-
fore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance
was conducted on March 24, 2017, and identified no new studies.
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently reviewed all identified titles and
abstracts and relevant full-text articles against prespecified inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Discrep-
ancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Eligible
studies were fair- and good-quality randomized clinical trials that
evaluated the effectiveness of primary care–relevant interventions
focused on improving dietary habits, increasing physical activity,
and/or reducing sedentary time with the primary aim of CVD pri-
mary prevention among adults 18 years or older. Studies were
excluded from this review if they (1) targeted persons with known
CVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, impaired fasting
glucose or glucose tolerance, or a combination of these factors;
(2) targeted persons categorized as high risk based on a cardiovas-
cular risk–assessment tool; or (3) generically stated that partici-
pants must have 1 or more CVD risk factors to be included. In con-
trast, studies in adults who may be at elevated risk for CVD based
on factors such as age, race/ethnicity, family history of CVD, over-
weight or obesity, high-normal blood pressure, or history of gesta-
tional diabetes, as well as those conducted among unselected
samples or samples selected because of suboptimal behavior
(eg, did not meet national physical activity guidelines) were
included. Eligible interventions were those conducted in primary
care or referred from primary care, or those deemed feasible for
primary care or referral given the nature of the intervention deliv-
ery (eg, face-to-face counseling, telephone support), behavior
change techniques (eg, goal setting, self-monitoring), or setting
(eg, home, community). Studies had to report a behavioral out-
come (ie, diet-, physical activity–, sedentary time–related mea-
sure), intermediate outcome (eg, blood pressure, lipid levels,
weight, incidence of hypertension), or health outcome (ie, mor-
bidity, mortality, health-related quality of life) or report adverse
events related to the intervention.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological qual-
ity of all eligible studies, using criteria outlined by the USPSTF
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).13 Each study was assigned a final
quality rating of good, fair, or poor; disagreements between the
investigators were resolved through consensus after discussion
and consultation with additional investigators. Studies were rated
as poor quality and excluded if they had several important major
risks of bias, including very high attrition at 6 to 12 months (eg,
greater than 40%), differential attrition between intervention
groups (eg, greater than 20%), lack of baseline comparability
between groups without adjustment for those variables, or other
issues in the conduct, analysis, or reporting of results of the trial
that were judged to considerably bias the results (eg, possible
selective reporting, inappropriate exclusion of participants from
analyses, and questionable validity of randomization and alloca-
tion concealment procedures). One reviewer completed primary
data abstraction, and a second reviewer checked all data for accu-
racy and completeness.

 Data Synthesis and Analysis
Summary tables were created for study characteristics, population
characteristics,interventioncharacteristics,andoutcomes.Thedata
on health outcomes (KQ1) and adverse events (KQ4) did not allow
for pooled analyses and so were summarized descriptively. For in-
termediatehealthoutcomes(KQ2)andbehavioraloutcomes(KQ3),
random-effectsmeta-analysesusingthemethodofDerSimonianand
Laird were run to calculate the pooled differences in mean changes
(for continuous data) and pooled odds ratio (for binary data).16
Thebetween-groupdifferenceforeachoutcomeasreportedbyeach
respective study was pooled favoring adjusted over unadjusted re-
portedeffectestimates.Ifabetween-groupeffectestimateandvari-
ance were not provided, a crude effect estimate was calculated.
Within each study, 1-year outcome data were chosen for meta-
analyses if available; otherwise, the point closest to 1 year was cho-
sen. If a trial had more than 1 active intervention group, data for the
most intensive group or the group that was the most similar with
other interventions included in the analysis were plotted. Methods
consistent with the previous review15 were used to estimate and
categorizetheintensity(totalcontactinminutes)ofeachinterven-
tiongroupaslow(�30minutes),medium(31-360minutes),orhigh
(>360 minutes). Results at all other points and for all intervention
groups within each trial were reported in tabular format.
Statistical heterogeneity among the pooled studies was exam-
ined using standard χ2 tests, and the proportion of total variability
in point estimates was approximated using the I2 statistic.17
Visualdisplayswerefirstusedtoinvestigatewhetherthehetero-
geneity among the results was associated with any prespecified
populationorinterventioncharacteristics;meta-regressionwasthen
used when indicated. To evaluate small-study effects, funnel plots
andtheEggertest18(forcontinuousoutcomes)orPeterstest19(for
dichotomous outcomes) were used. Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp)
was used for all quantitative analyses. All significance testing was
2-sided,andresultswereconsideredstatisticallysignificantatP < .05.
The strength of the overall body of evidence for each KQ was
graded as high, moderate, low, or insufficient based on established
methods20andaddressedtheconsistency,precision,reportingbias,
study quality, and dose response related to each outcome.
Results
A total of 10 045 titles and abstracts and 351 articles were re-
viewed to determine if they met the prespecified inclusion criteria,
and 88 trials (87 randomized clinical trials [n = 121 106] and 1 non-
randomizedclinicaltrial[n = 84])reportedin145publicationswere

Evidence reviews for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) use an
analytic framework to visually display the key questions that the review will
address to allow the USPSTF to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a
preventive service. The questions are depicted by linkages that relate
interventions and outcomes. A dashed line indicates a relationship between an
intermediate outcome and a health outcome that is presumed to describe the
natural progression of the disease. Further details are available in the USPSTF
procedure manual.13
a High risk of cardiovascular disease includes adults with hypertension,
dyslipidemia, diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance,
or a combination of these factors.

Effects of Interventions on Health Outcomes
Key Question 1. Do primary care behavioral counseling interven-
tions to improve diet, increase physical activity, and/or reduce sed-
entary behavior improve health outcomes in adults?
Twelve of the 88 included trials reported health
outcomes.52,63,69,76,82,96,97,121,146,147,151,154Only2ofthesetrials62,154
were identified as part of the update, and both reported quality-
of-life outcomes. Four trials (n = 51 356) reported all-cause or
CVD-related mortality,82,146,147,151 of which 3 also reported cardio-
vascular events.146,147,151 All 4 of these trials focused on high-
intensitydietinterventions.Overall,fewdeathswerereported,and
nodifferenceswereobservedbetweentreatmentandcontrolgroups
over 3 to 15 years of follow-up. The 3 trials that reported cardiovas-
cular events or composite CVD outcomes showed some beneficial
results, although results were mixed. The Women’
s Health Initia-
tive dietary modification trial (n = 48 835) showed no difference in
majorcoronaryheartdiseaseevents(ie,nonfatalmyocardialinfarc-
tion [MI] or coronary heart disease death) (adjusted hazard ratio
[HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.05]) or fatal and nonfatal stroke
(adjusted HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.17]) among women without a
history of CVD between those randomized to low-fat diet counsel-
ingandthoseinausual-caredietgroupover8.1yearsoffollow-up.81
Similarly,abroadercompositeCVDoutcomecomprisingnonfatalMI,
coronary heart disease death, and coronary artery bypass graft
surgery/percutaneous coronary intervention showed no signifi-
cantdifferencebetweentreatmentgroups(adjustedHR,0.94[95%
CI, 0.86 to 1.02]).81 In contrast, long-term observational follow-up
from the Trial of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) phase I and II
(n = 2415) showed a significant difference in CVD (defined as MI,
stroke,revascularization,orCVDdeath)betweentreatmentgroups
over10to15yearsoffollow-up(HR,0.70[95%CI,0.53to0.94]).48
When revascularization was excluded from the definition, how-
ever,significancewaslost(adjustedHR,0.72[95%CI,0.50to1.03]).

Effects of Interventions on Intermediate Health Outcomes
Key Question 2. Do primary care behavioral counseling interven-
tions to improve diet, increase physical activity, and/or reduce sed-
entarybehaviorimproveintermediateoutcomesassociatedwithcar-
diovascular disease (CVD) in adults?
Thirty-four of the included trials (n = 75 793) reported the ef-
fects of behavioral interventions on at least 1 intermediate outcome
(ie, blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose levels, or adiposity mea-
sures); nearly half of the trials were of good quality.21,26,31,32,38,39,
47,52,63,67,71,76,78,79,82,85,86,88,89,91,96,98,102,118,130,132,136,146,147,
149-151,153,161 When trials were pooled, healthful diet, physical activity
interventions,orbothwereassociatedwithsmallbutstatisticallysig-
nificant improvements in systolic blood pressure (22 trials), diastolic
bloodpressure(23trials),low-densitylipoproteincholesterol(LDL-C)
level(13trials),totalcholesterollevel(19trials),andadipositymeasures
(20 trials), compared with controls at 6 months or more (Table 1).
Pooledbetween-groupmeandifferenceswere−1.26mmHg(95%CI,
−1.77to−0.75)forsystolicbloodpressure,−0.49mmHg(95%CI,−0.82

totalcholesterollevel—allinfavorofinterventionvscontrolgroupswith
follow-up times of 6 months or more. For adiposity outcomes, inter-
ventions were associated with improvements in body mass index
(meandifference,−0.41[95%CI,−0.62to−0.19];calculatedasweight
inkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared),weight(meandif-
ference, −1.04 kg [95% CI, −1.56 to −0.51]), and waist circumference
(mean difference, −1.19 cm [95% CI, −1.79 to −0.59]), with consider-
ablestatisticalheterogeneity(I2 > 90%)inallanalyses.Therewasno
evidence of an association between healthful diet, physical activity

outcome), compared with the results of combining trials of all in-

 consistent and generally showed no benefit, with the exception of
the outcome of weight. There was insufficient evidence (only 1-4
trials per outcome) to assess the association between low-
intensity interventions and intermediate outcomes.
Meta-analysesstratifiedbydiet-onlymessages,physicalactivity–
onlymessages,orcombineddietandphysicalactivitymessageswere
consistent with those seen in analyses stratified by intensity (re-
sults available in the full evidence report). Healthful diet interven-
tions(withorwithoutphysicalactivitymessages)(7-16trialsperout-
come),whichweremostlyhigh-intensityinterventions,consistently
showedstatisticallysignificantfavorableassociationswithinterme-
diate outcomes. No such benefit was seen when limiting the analy-
ses to physical activity–only trials, which were largely of low inten-
sity, although there were far fewer trials included in these analyses
(4-8trialsperoutcome).Therewasnoevidenceofeffectmodifica-
tion based on whether the intervention was linked to primary care
(independent of intervention intensity), the number of interven-

Effects of Interventions on Behavioral Outcomes
Key Question 3. Do primary care behavioral counseling interven-
tions to improve diet, increase physical activity, and/or reduce sed-
entary behavior improve associated health behaviors in adults?
All but 232,153 of the 88 included studies (n = 117 589) reported
theeffectsofabehavioralinterventionondietary,physicalactivity,
and/or sedentary behavior outcomes. More than one-third of the
studies that reported behavioral outcomes (36/86 studies) were
newly identified as part of this update. Almost all of the behavioral
outcomeswerebasedonself-report;3trialsmeasuredurinarysodium
excretion, and 11 trials used accelerometers or pedometers to cap-
tureobjectivemeasuresofphysicalactivity.Theinstruments,modes
ofadministration,andsummarymeasureswerehighlyvariableacross
trials that measured behavioral outcomes through self-report.
Overall, there was evidence that behavioral interventions gen-
erallyimprovedparticipants’

ventiongroup)(16trials);between-groupdifferencesingramsoffi-

reported dietary intake) ranged from −380 mg/d to −1380 mg/d
(6 trials). Only 9 trials reported the effects of the interventions on
dietary outcomes at greater than 12 months of follow-up (ie, 1.5 to
6 years of follow-up), with a lack of effect or slightly attenuated ef-
fect being seen over time.
Physical activity interventions (with or without dietary mes-
sages) were associated with a 35-minute (95% CI, 22.0 to 47.0) in-
creaseinphysicalactivityperweekcomparedwithcontrolsinpooled
analyses at 6 to 12 months of follow-up (27 trials). The standard-
ized effect size when pooling 46 trials that reported any continu-
ous measure of physical activity (eg, minutes per day, minutes per
week, metabolic-equivalent minutes per week, score) was a mean
difference of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.26) in favor of the interven-
tion group. Additionally, meta-analysis indicated that intervention
groupparticipantshadanoddsratioof1.32(95%CI,1.12to1.56)for

in the control group (16 trials). Data on physical activity outcomes

inclusion to participants with suboptimal levels of physical activity
at baseline (eg, below the recommended level of 150 minutes per
week)resultedingreaterincreasesinphysicalactivitycomparedwith
those that did not limit inclusion based on baseline physical activ-
ity levels. In contrast to findings for intermediate outcomes, there
was no evidence of effect modification based on intervention in-
tensity.Likewise,therewasnoevidenceofadifferenceineffectsfor
interventions focused only on physical activity messages vs those
focused on both physical activity and healthful diet messages.
Only 4 trials reported measures of sedentary behavior inde-
pendent of physical activity behavior. Of these 4 trials, 2 found sta-
tistically significant group × time effects on self-reported minutes

Harms of Interventions
Key Question 4. What adverse events are associated with primary
care behavioral counseling interventions to improve diet, increase
physical activity, and/or reduce sedentary behavior in adults?
Harms of included interventions were sparsely reported and
were inconsistently defined. Fourteen of the included trials
(n = 8220) specifically mentioned the occurrence of harms or lack
of harms.22,32,35,41,44,52,73,78,95,97,102,121,132,150 Across these studies,
there were no serious adverse events related to the interventions
reported,althoughnonewerehypothesized.Sevenphysicalactivity–
focused trials (n = 3565) reported the incidence of injuries, frac-
tures, or falls; only 1 trial among women aged 40 to 74 years re-
portedsignificantlymoreinjuries(19%vs14%,P = .03)andfalls(37%
vs29%,P < .001)amongparticipantsintheinterventiongroupthan

Discussion
This systematic review was conducted to assist the USPSTF in up-
dating its 2012 recommendation on healthful diet and physical ac-
tivitycounselingfortheprimarypreventionofCVDinpersonswith-
out CVD risk factors (ie, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or
impaired fasting glucose). Eighty-eight unique trials, nearly one-
half of which (38 trials) were published since the previous USPSTF
review, were included. The pooled estimates found in this updated
systematic review were generally consistent in magnitude with the
2010 review on this topic15 and slightly lower in magnitude com-
pared with the associations seen in the 2014 review among per-
sons at high risk for CVD14 (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Table3summarizesthefindingsforthisevidencereview.Health-
fuldietandphysicalactivitybehavioralinterventionsinpersonswith-
outtraditionalCVDriskfactorswereassociatedwithmodestreduc-
tions in blood pressure, levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C, and
adiposity measures at approximately 6 to 12 months of follow-up,
compared with control conditions. The interventions varied con-
siderably across the studies, such as in their behavioral focus (diet
only, physical activity only, or diet plus physical activity messages),
theirdeliverymode(groupandindividualin-personcounseling,tele-
phone counseling, print-based, or technology-based), and their in-
tensity (number of sessions, length of sessions, and duration of the
intervention).Therewasevidenceofadose-responserelationship,
with increasing intervention intensity being associated with larger
improvements in intermediate outcomes, but there was insuffi-
cient evidence to assess the effects of low-intensity interventions
aloneonintermediateoutcomes.Therewasconsiderablymoreevi-
dence for behavioral outcomes, with 86 trials reporting the effects
ofcounselinginterventionsondietaryintake,physicalactivity,and/or
sedentary behaviors. The direction of effects for all behavioral out-
comes were reasonably consistent and suggested generally a small
benefitfordietaryoutcomesandamoderatebenefitforphysicalac-
tivity. However, there was substantial variation in outcome mea-
sures and insufficient evidence on the effects of interventions on
sedentary behaviors.
The evidence for the effects of interventions on longer-term
healthoutcomes,includingall-causeandCVD-specificmortality,CVD
events,andhealth-relatedqualityoflife,aswellasintermediatecar-
diometabolicoutcomespast1year,wassparseandinconsistent,pre-
cluding a robust conclusion. Likewise, a limited number of trials re-
ported on harms of the interventions, and none of these studies
found any serious adverse events related to the interventions.
In the context of sparse randomized clinical trial evidence for
the effect of healthful diet and physical activity interventions on
health outcomes, observational evidence from very large, indi-
vidual participant–data meta-analyses of prospective cohort stud-
ies can be used to estimate and bound the potential benefit of pro-
portional differences in intermediate outcomes on the risk of
morbidity and mortality. Such evidence suggests that small differ-
encesinbloodpressure,bloodcholesterollevels,andbodymassin-
dex can translate into small differences in important health out-
comes (see full evidence report).166-168

 This review represents only a subset of the literature on di-
etary and physical activity counseling. Trials focused on dietary
orphysicalactivitycounselinginpersonswithknowncardiovas-
cular risk factors or to prevent or manage other health risks and
conditions (eg, falls, cognitive impairment, cancer), as well as
those focused on weight loss or weight management, were ex-
cluded. Many of these topics are the focus of other USPSTF re-
views and recommendations.169-173
Limitations
With complex interventions such as these, describing and syn-
thesizinginterventioncharacteristicsisdifficult.Theincludedin-
terventionsvariedconsiderablyintermsofthenatureofthead-
vice, mode of delivery, and delivery schedule. Details of each
intervention were abstracted, and an established taxonomy for
describing the behavior change techniques used in the
interventions174 was used. Consistent rules were used to esti-
mate the total minutes of contact and to categorize each inter-
vention group by intensity. Despite these attempts, there is a
need for better reporting of intervention characteristics to fa-
cilitate evaluation and dissemination of evidence-based prac-
tices. As outlined by Krist et al,175 research on behavioral coun-
seling interventions such as the type synthesized here would
benefit from an application of checklists and frameworks, such
as the Template for Intervention Description and Replication
(TIDierR); Research, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
and Maintenance (RE-AIM); and the Pragmatic-Explanatory
Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS), to assess the feasibil-
ity and applicability of interventions as well as to improve repli-
cation and dissemination.
This review found no evidence of a difference in effects
by the focus of the message, but analyses were highly con-
founded by the intensity of interventions. Also, only 1 of the
included studies targeted reductions in sedentary behavior
(ie, sitting time) as the main focus of the trial, and only 3 trials
reported the outcomes of sedentary behavior. More research
on the effects of counseling to reduce sedentary behavior in
adults on behavioral and intermediate health outcomes is
warranted. Very few studies explored whether effectiveness
of the intervention varied among important subpopulations
(older adults, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with
lower socioeconomic status). Such a priori analyses could assist
in identifying groups of adults who might benefit more from
such interventions.
Additionally, most of the trials relied on self-reported di-
etary and physical activity measures, with variable levels of evi-
dence of the reliability and validity of the measures. Dietary in-
takewasmostoftenmeasuredbyfoodfrequencyquestionnaires
(suchasthefull-lengthorshorterversionsoftheBlockfoodfre-
quency questionnaire176,177), entries in food diaries, or 24-hour
food recalls. The tools and summary variables used to measure
physical activity were even more inconsistent. Physical activity
was summarized in terms of total physical activity, leisure-
specific physical activity, moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity
physical activity, walking behaviors, and multiple other indica-
tors; in addition, the results were expressed in different units
acrossstudies(eg,minutesperweek,metabolicequivalenttask–
minutes per week, steps per day, summary “scores”). Each of

dardization of behavioral outcome measurement.179
Studies that were heterogeneous with respect to clinical and
demographic characteristics, interventions, and settings were in-
tentionally pooled. For most outcomes, the statistical heteroge-
neity of pooled analyses was unimportant (I2 < 40%) or moderate
(I2 = 30%-60%) and therefore still reasonable to allow for inter-
preting of pooled estimates. However, given the clinical heteroge-
neity,interpretingthe95%confidenceintervalsinsteadofthesum-
