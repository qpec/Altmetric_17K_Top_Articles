Abstract
Adolescent mental health problems are associated with poor health and well-being in adulthood. 
This study uses data from a birth cohort of children born in large U.S. cities (N=2,264) to examine 
whether neighborhood collective efficacy (social cohesion and control) is associated with 
improvements in adolescent mental health. We find that children who grow up in high collective 
efficacy neighborhoods experience fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms during adolescence 
than similar children from low collective efficacy neighborhoods. The magnitude of this 
neighborhood effect is comparable to the effects of depression prevention programs. Findings do 
not vary by family or neighborhood income, indicating that neighborhood collective efficacy 
supports adolescent mental health across diverse populations and urban settings. We recommend 
greater emphasis on neighborhood environments in individual mental health risk assessments and 
greater investment in community-based initiatives that strengthen neighborhood social cohesion 
and control.

 Introduction
Adolescent mental health problems are a strong predictor of future health and wellbeing, 
including suicide attempts, substance dependence, educational underachievement, 
unemployment, and early parenthood (1,2). Understanding how community environments 
influence adolescent mental health is therefore important to health and wellbeing throughout 
the life course. Research has documented wide health disparities across U.S. counties and 
metropolitan areas (3), and a strong link between neighborhood socio-economic 
characteristics and children's wellbeing (4–6). Less is known, however, about the social and 
institutional processes through which place of residence influences children's development 
(7,8). One potential mechanism is neighborhood collective efficacy. Collective efficacy 
theory joins two social processes: social cohesion, the extent to which residents get along 
and share common values (the “collectivity” component); and shared expectations for social 
control, the extent to which neighbors can be counted on to take action when everyday 
challenges arise (the “efficacy” component) (9).
Neighborhood mechanisms of social cohesion and control are expected to empower 
communities to solve common problems. In particular, collective efficacy theory was 
developed to explain differences in neighborhood crime (10). Communities where residents 
share similar values about local norms and intervene when these norms are violated (e.g., 
children fighting on the street) are believed to collectively discourage violent and delinquent 
behavior. Thus, related empirical work on child development has primarily focused on 
juvenile delinquency and risky health behaviors (e.g., aggression, rule-breaking, multiple 
sexual partners). As hypothesized, these studies have shown that neighborhood collective 
efficacy is associated with fewer problem behaviors net of individual, family, and 
neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (11–14).
Neighborhood collective efficacy is also expected to support individual mental health: 
directly, through social support, solidarity, and trust shared among community members 
(15,16); and indirectly, through reduction of violent and delinquent behaviors that are 
stressful to neighborhood residents. However, little research has focused on whether 
neighborhood collective efficacy protects against adolescent depression and anxiety. This 
limitation is noteworthy, given that 14% of adolescents in the U.S. have experienced a 
depression/mood disorder and 8% have experienced an anxiety disorder with severe 
impairment (17).
Prior research on neighborhood collective efficacy and children's mental health is based on a 
small number of studies that are geographically limited. Most notably, the Project on Human 
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) conducted an intensive study of Chicago 
neighborhoods followed by a series of longitudinal studies of children and families. Joining 
data from these studies, researchers found that young children from neighborhoods with 
higher levels of collective efficacy experienced fewer parent-reported internalizing behaviors 
(depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic problems), controlling for neighborhood 
socio-economic conditions and children's earlier internalizing behaviors (18). In a related 
PHDCN study, neighborhoods with high collective efficacy increased the protective effect of 
family support on adolescent suicidal behaviors (19). Beyond Chicago, one prospective

 study of children in Baltimore also found that neighborhood collective efficacy was 
associated with fewer parent-reported internalizing behaviors, but only in low-income 
communities (20). However, given the single-city design of these studies, the extent to which 
findings can be generalized to other places and populations remains in question.
In this study, we use data from twenty large U.S. cities to examine how childhood exposure 
to neighborhood collective efficacy is related to symptoms of adolescent depression and 
anxiety. We test whether associations vary by characteristics previously shown to moderate 
neighborhood effects, including family income, child gender, and neighborhood 
disadvantage (7,11,20). The study design adopts a life course perspective (21), whereby 
cumulative social support experienced throughout childhood influences health outcomes 
during the transition to adulthood (22). To our knowledge, ours is the first study of 
adolescent mental health to measure neighborhood collective efficacy over time and use 
population-based data on children from multiple cities.
Data and Methods
Data
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) is a population-based, birth 
cohort study of approximately 4,800 children born in large U.S. cities between 1998 and 
2000. The study sampled births (one per household) in twenty cities from all regions of the 
U.S. (23). The design called for an oversample of births to unmarried mothers, which 
resulted in a large sample of children from low-income families. Mothers were first 
interviewed at the hospital following the birth of their child; follow-up interviews with 
parents and children were conducted when children were approximately ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 
15.
The analytic sample in this study includes 2,264 children who evaluated their mental health 
at age 15 and whose parents assessed neighborhood collective efficacy when children were 
ages 3, 5, and 9. The analytic sample is socio-demographically comparable to the sample of 
families interviewed at birth with one notable exception. Due to the disproportionate attrition 
of immigrant families, the analytic sample has a smaller percentage of Hispanic families and 
low educated mothers than the baseline sample (Appendix A compares all characteristics) 
(24).
Adolescent mental health
Adolescents reported the severity of their depressive and anxiety symptoms when they were 
age 15. Measuring symptom severity on a continuum from none to severe, rather than a 
binary measure of clinical diagnosis, is supported by research that links subthreshold 
depression and anxiety commonly experienced during adolescence and increased disease 
and suicide in adulthood (25).
The depressive symptoms scale is based on five items taken from the twenty-item Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (26). As compared with the full scale, the 
five-item scale is a more valid cross-cultural assessment of depressive symptoms 
experienced across diverse adolescent populations (27). Referencing the previous four

 weeks, respondents indicated their level of agreement on a four-point scale to the following 
statements: “I feel I cannot shake off the blues, even with help from my family and my 
friends”; “I feel sad”; “I feel happy” (reverse coded); “I feel life is not worth living”; “I feel 
depressed”(α=.75).
The anxiety symptoms scale is comprised of six items adapted from the Brief Symptom 
Inventory 18 (BSI 18) (28). Respondents indicated their level of agreement on a four-point 
scale to the following statements in reference to the past four weeks: “I have spells of terror 
or panic”; “I feel tense or keyed up”; “I get suddenly scared for no reason”; “I feel nervous 
or shaky inside”; “I feel fearful”; and “I feel so restless I can't sit still” (α=0.76).
Neighborhood collective efficacy
Parents evaluated neighborhood collective efficacy when children were ages 3, 5, and 9 on 
two sub-scales adapted from earlier research (29). The first sub-scale assessed neighborhood 
social cohesion based on respondent's level of agreement on a four-point scale to: “People 
around here are willing to help their neighbors”; “This is a close-knit neighborhood”; 
“People in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other” (reverse coded); and 
“People in this neighborhood do not share the same values” (reverse coded). The second 
sub-scale assessed neighborhood social control based on the respondent's expectation on a 
four-point scale of the likelihood that neighbors would “intervene” or “get involved” if 
“children were skipping school and hanging out on the street”, “children were spray painting 
buildings with graffiti”, “children were showing disrespect to an adult”, “a fight broke out in 
front of the house”, and “the fire station closest to the neighborhood was threatened and its 
budget cut”.
Following prior research (18), the two correlated sub-scales (r=0.63) are combined into a 
single measure of neighborhood collective efficacy. At each wave, all nine items are summed 
to create a composite index of neighborhood collective efficacy (α=0.86 across three waves). 
We use the mean of the three wave-specific composite indices to construct an overall 
measure of children's cumulative exposure to neighborhood collective during early and 
middle childhood (between ages 3 and 9) (30).
Control variables
At the neighborhood level, we construct an index of neighborhood socio-economic 
disadvantage that includes seven highly correlated, Census tract indicators of concentrated 
disadvantage: percent of residents who are poor, unemployed, receiving welfare, without a 
high school degree, with a Bachelor's degree (reverse coded), percent of workers with 
professional/managerial occupations (reverse coded), and percent of households headed by a 
female (31). Census tract data from the 2000 Census and the 2005-2009 American 
Community Surveys are linearly interpolated across calendar years and merged to 
respondents' residence at each wave. The index corresponds to mean levels of disadvantage 
children experienced between ages 3 and 9, standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard 
deviation of 1 across the national distribution of all U.S. Census tracts (32).
At the household level, we also control for the average annual household income at ages 3, 5 
and 9 (logged) and the number of residential moves between ages 3 and 9. Additional

 control variables measured at birth include: number of children in household, relationship 
between biological parents (married, cohabiting, single), and mother's education, race/
ethnicity, immigrant status, and age. All models also include controls for child gender and 
age at the mental health assessment.
Finally, we control for the mental health history of children, parents, and grandparents. At 
age 3, parents assessed children's anxious and depressed behaviors based on 11 survey items 
from the Anxious/Depressed sub-scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (33) (α=0.69). At 
ages 1 and 3, we also measured whether children's mothers met clinical thresholds for a 
Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) over the 
previous year; both measures are derived from the Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview - Short Form (34). Measures of maternal grandmother's mental health include 
symptoms of depression and anxiety based on survey questions from the National 
Comorbidity Survey (35); at age 3, the child's mother reported whether her biological 
mother ever had periods “lasting two weeks or more when she was depressed, blue, or down 
in the dumps most of the time?”, and “of a month or more when she was constantly nervous, 
edgy, or anxious?”.
Analyses
Statistical analyses estimate associations between children's exposure to neighborhood 
collective efficacy (measured at ages 3, 5 and 9) and adolescent mental health (measured at 
age 15) using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and controlling for the socio-
demographic and mental health history variables discussed above. Models also include 
fixed-effects for the city in which children were born (range of 46 to 189 children per city). 
Sub-group estimates are obtained by interacting sub-group variables with neighborhood 
collective efficacy. Missing information on control variables are imputed using multiple 
imputation by chained equations (M=40) (36).
Limitations
This study presents associations between parents' reports of neighborhood collective efficacy 
and adolescents' self-assessment of their mental health. Several noteworthy limitations 
should be considered when interpreting these findings.
First, unlike an experimental study, non-random assignment of families into neighborhoods 
limits our ability to identify causal effects. Because families have some choice in where they 
live, associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual outcomes are 
particularly vulnerable to selection biases (37). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility 
that associations presented are due to unobserved characteristics of families or communities, 
rather than the causal effect of neighborhood collective efficacy.
Second, our measure of neighborhood collective efficacy is based on parents' assessments, 
rather than a more objective measure of neighborhood quality. As a result, neighborhood 
ratings may be affected by reporter characteristics unrelated to the neighborhood 
environment. In some prior studies, collective efficacy has been measured by aggregating 
reports from a diverse sample of neighborhood residents and adjusting ratings based on 
Donnelly et al.

 reporter characteristics (18). Unfortunately, these methods were not possible in this study 
because families were not sufficiently clustered within small geographical units that could 
proxy for neighborhood boundaries. For example, the average number of respondents per 
Census tract at each wave was less than 1.3; only 2% of respondents within the analytic 
sample shared the same Census tract residence with another respondent at ages 3, 5 and 9.
In order to mitigate these limitations, we use different reporters for neighborhood collective 
efficacy and adolescent mental health (parents and adolescents, respectively). We also 
control for a wide range of individual and neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics, 
including the mental health histories of children, parents, and grandparents. Our findings are 
robust to a variety of alternative measurement and model specifications, including a count 
measure of the number of waves children resided in high collective efficacy neighborhoods 
(Appendix B) and the regression of scale scores using negative binomial regression models 
(Appendix C) (24).
Results
Description of variables
Exhibit 1 presents descriptive statistics of all variables used in this study. At age 15, children 
report mean levels of depressive symptoms of 2.98 on the adapted CES-D scale (range of 0 
to 15) and mean levels of anxiety symptoms of 4.88 on the adapted BSI 18 scale (range of 0 
to 18). Parents report average levels of neighborhood collective efficacy of 18.3 on the scale 
ranging from of 0 to 27 (slightly above a 3 on a 4-point scale of agreement) with a standard 
deviation of 4.5.
On average, children in the analytic sample are from disadvantaged socio-demographic 
backgrounds. They grow up in neighborhoods that are two thirds of a standard deviation 
above the national mean on the neighborhood socio-economic disadvantage scale and in 
households with an average annual household income of $41,000. Nearly a third of the 
mothers have less than a high school degree (30%), half are African American, and around 
one quarter are Hispanic (23%). Approximately 74% of children were born to unmarried 
mothers (mean age of 25.3).
Factors affecting adolescent mental health
We conducted a series of nested OLS regression models predicting levels of adolescent 
depressive and anxiety symptoms, first using only collective efficacy (averaged over ages 3, 
5 and 9) as a predictor (Model 1), then adding socio-demographic variables (Model 2), and 
finally adding mental health history variables (Model 3). To ease interpretation, the 
depressive and anxiety scales are standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1; 
thus, results are standardized to show the effect on depressive and anxiety symptoms 
(relative to the standard deviation) of a one unit change in the individual covariates. Full 
model results are available for both outcomes in Appendix D and E (24).
In the bivariate models, one standard deviation change in collective efficacy was associated 
with a 0.11 and 0.10 standard deviation reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, 
respectively (p<0.01 for both outcomes). For both outcomes, this association was attenuated

 but remained statistically significant after socio-demographic and mental health history 
variables were added to the models.
Exhibit 2 presents selected results from the full model specifications. Net of all socio-
demographic and mental health history variables, one standard deviation change in collective 
efficacy is associated with a decrease in both depressive and anxiety symptoms of 0.07 
standard deviations (p<.01 for both outcomes). These associations can be translated into 
effect sizes comparable to treatment evaluations. For example, adolescents who grow up in a 
high collective efficacy neighborhood (75th percentile in sample) report 0.10 of a standard 
deviation less depression and anxiety than comparable adolescents who grow up in low 
collective neighborhoods (25 percentile in sample) (38). This standardized mean difference 
is comparable in size to the effects of prevention programs aimed at general or at-risk 
adolescent populations (39).
In the full model specifications, neighborhood socio-economic disadvantage is not predictive 
of adolescent depression or anxiety. Household income is associated with less of both 
symptoms (p<.05 and p<.10, respectively) and female adolescents report substantially more 
symptoms of depression (0.20 standard deviations, p<.01) and anxiety (0.12 standard 
deviations, p<.01) than male children. Maternal depression and early childhood anxious/
depressed behaviors are both associated with more symptoms of adolescent mental health 
problems. Adolescents whose mothers were depressed during childhood report levels of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms that are 0.10 and 0.13 standard deviations higher than 
comparable adolescents whose mothers were not depressed (p<0.10 and p<.05, 
respectively). One standard deviation increase in anxious/depressed behaviors during early 
childhood is associated with a 0.05 and 0.07 standard deviation increase in adolescent 
depression and anxiety, respectively (p<.05 for both outcomes).
Results by sub-groups
Exhibit 3 shows the estimated effects of neighborhood collective efficacy on adolescent 
mental health by neighborhood socio-economic disadvantage, household income, and child 
gender. Marginal effects are estimated from models that interact neighborhood collective 
efficacy with sub-group variables, controlling for all variables shown in Exhibit 1, including 
city of birth. Results compare the estimated neighborhood collective efficacy effect between 
male and female children, children from low- and moderate-income families, and children 
from neighborhoods of average and disadvantaged socio-economic status (one standard 
deviation more disadvantaged than the average U.S. neighborhood).
Overall, higher levels of neighborhood collective efficacy are associated with lower levels of 
adolescent depression and anxiety for all sub-groups analyzed. For both outcomes, the fully 
standardized associations range from around -.05 to -.09 across sub-groups, similar in 
magnitude to the -.07 association found for the full sample (Exhibit 2). The interacted 
models indicate that none of the sub-group differences in associations presented in Exhibit 3 
are statistically significant (nor when all interactions are estimated in a single model).

 Discussion
Findings from this study show that children who grow up in neighborhoods with higher 
levels of collective efficacy experience lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms 
during adolescence, even after controlling for a wide variety of socio-demographic and 
mental health history variables. We estimated that adolescents from high collective 
neighborhoods report 0.10 of a standard deviation fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms 
than comparable adolescents from low collective neighborhoods. Although a 0.10 
standardized mean difference is notably smaller than an effect size (e.g., 0.50) commonly 
reported for many psychological and pharmacological interventions aimed at adolescents 
diagnosed with clinical disorders (40,41), this estimate is similar to the average effect size of 
prevention programs aimed at general or at-risk adolescent populations (39). Moreover, our 
estimate of effect size is similar to well-established individual risk factors, such as family 
depression and child behavioral problems.
Finally, our findings provide evidence that the protective effects of neighborhood collective 
efficacy reported in previous studies for particular cities extend to diverse populations and 
urban settings throughout the U.S. Results from this study also show that associations 
between neighborhood collective efficacy and adolescent mental health hold regardless of 
neighborhood socio-economic disadvantage, household income, and child gender.
Although our findings can be generalized to a broader population than prior studies, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that the associations we observe are at least partially spurious. 
In order to rule out that possibility, experimental research involving neighborhood level 
interventions is needed. Replication of this observational study using additional analytic 
methods, such as statistical matching or marginal structural models, would provide evidence 
on the robustness of these findings. Our findings are also limited by our measure of 
neighborhood collective efficacy, which is based on reports by children's parents averaged 
over three time points between ages 3 and 9. Future studies are needed that examine 
trajectories in children's exposure to neighborhood conditions from birth through 
adolescence. We also recommend that research doing population studies conduct 
supplemental community surveys or adopt geographical cluster sampling designs in order to 
develop more objective measures of neighborhood social processes.
Our findings have several important implications for policy. First, we find that neighborhood 
collective efficacy is an important predictor of adolescent mental health. Thus, we 
recommend that neighborhood collective efficacy be used alongside other known ecological 
risk and protective factors when assessing the mental health risks of individuals. Second, 
insofar as the associations we observe are causal, we recommend greater policy efforts to 
strengthen neighborhood social cohesion and control, especially in disadvantaged 
communities where residents are at increased risk for poor health. Promising strategies to 
increase neighborhood collective efficacy include adolescent-centered health education 
programs that focus on empathy and communication (42), and police policies that focus on 
community collaboration, trust, and relationship building (43). More broadly, prior research 
highlights reciprocal links between neighborhood collective efficacy, concentrated 
disadvantage, and the density of and participation in community-based organizations (9).

 Therefore, polices that promote greater socio-economic integration and increase investments 
in community organizations may improve neighborhood collective efficacy and ultimately 
adolescent mental health.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that neighborhood collective efficacy is associated 
with adolescent depression and anxiety. While more research is needed to confirm a causal 
link, robust associations observed across many cities and demographic sub-groups add to 
growing evidence that neighborhood social processes influence child health and well being. 
Given these findings, we recommend that health practitioners consider the collective efficacy 
of neighborhoods when evaluating adolescent risk for depression and anxiety. Finally, 
policies that invest in community organizations and strengthen partnerships between 
residents and local institutions are likely to simultaneously support neighborhood collective 
efficacy and adolescent mental health.

Source: Authors' analysis of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. 
Notes: Results of full model specification predicting adolescent depressive and anxiety 
symptoms with 95% confidence intervals (full results available in Appendix E and F). 
Models control for all socio-demographic and mental health history variables present in 
Exhibit 1, including sample city at birth. Results show the effect on depressive and anxiety 
symptoms (relative to the standard deviation) of a one unit change in the individual 
covariates. Units are shown in parentheses.

Source: Authors' analysis of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Notes: Marginal effects for each sub-group are obtained by 
interacting sub-group variables with the neighborhood collective efficacy scale. Continuous variables are used for neighborhood disadvantage 
(national z-score) and family income (income-to-needs ratio); marginal effects are estimated at the values shown in parentheses. Models control for 
all socio-demographic and mental health history variables present in Exhibit 1, including sample city at birth.
