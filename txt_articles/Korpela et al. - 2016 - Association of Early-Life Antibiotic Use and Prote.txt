IMPORTANCE Long duration of breastfeeding is known to reduce the frequency of infections
and the risk of overweight, both of which are prevalent health problems among children, but
the mechanisms are unclear.
OBJECTIVES To test whether early-life antibiotic use in children prevents the beneficial
long-term effects of breastfeeding on weight development and lifetime antibiotic use, and to
investigate whether the duration of breastfeeding is associated with long-term microbiota
development.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study, conducted from June 2015
to December 2015, of the association between the duration of breastfeeding and lifetime
antibiotic use by children as well as body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) z score in a cohort of 226 healthy children aged 2 to
6 years attending day care at the study area in northern Finland and participating in a
probiotic trial from October 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010. Fecal microbiota composition
analysis was performed in a subcohort of 42 of these children.
EXPOSURES Duration of breastfeeding and the number of different antibiotic courses
purchased for the child.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The BMI z score, lifetime antibiotic use after weaning, and
fecal microbiota composition.
RESULTS A total of 226 children (mean [SD] age, 55 [1.4] months; 54% male) were included in
the study. Among the 113 children with no antibiotics before weaning, each month of
breastfeeding decreased the mean number of postweaning antibiotic courses by 5% (95% CI,
2% to 8%; P = .001) and mean BMI z scores by 0.08 unit (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.11; P < .001).
Among the 113 early-life antibiotic users, the effect of breastfeeding on postweaning
antibiotic use was borderline significant (estimated 4% decrease per month; 95% CI, 0% to
7%; P = .04) and the effect on BMI z score disappeared (estimated 1% increase; 95% CI,
−3% to 5%; P = .50). In the subcohort of 42 children with fecal microbiota composition
analysis, the children with short breastfeeding duration (0-6 months) and no early-life
antibiotic use or with long breastfeeding duration (8-16 months) and early-life use of
antibiotics had a significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium (by 55%; 95% CI, 43% to
87%; P = .006; and 39%, 95% CI, 30% to 68%; P < .001, respectively) and Akkermansia (by
71%; 95% CI, 28% to 87%; P = .008; and 69%; 95% CI, 22% to 90%; P = .02, respectively)
compared with those with long duration of breastfeeding and no early-life antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antibiotic use in a child during breastfeeding may weaken the
beneficial effects of long breastfeeding duration. The results suggest that particularly the
long-term metabolic benefits of breastfeeding are conveyed by the intestinal microbiota.

reastfeeding is known to protect against infections
in early life, and long duration of breastfeeding has
also been shown to reduce the risk of overweight in
children.1 The benefits of breastfeeding are likely related to the
early development of the intestinal microbiota,2 which is
strongly dependent on the infant’
s diet.3 Human milk con-
tains considerable amounts of complex fucosylated and si-
alilated glycans that are nonnutritious to the host but used as
energy sources by Bifidobacterium species,4 which are abun-
dant in the breastfed infant’
s intestine.5
Mouse studies indicate a causal role for the intestinal mi-
crobiota regulating the development of growth, energy me-
tabolism, fat accumulation, and susceptibility to diet-induced
adiposity,6,7aphenomenontermedmicrobiota-inducedobesity.8
Intestinal microbiota composition in infancy9,10 as well as fre-
quent antibiotic use in early childhood11 have been repeatedly
associated with subsequent excessive weight development in
children. The early-life microbiota composition also influ-

tween breastfeeding and the metabolic and immunological de-
velopment of the infant. Most important, antibiotic use may be
amodifyingfactorintherelationshipbetweenbreastfeedingand
infant weight development, which may explain inconsisten-
cies in previous studies.
We hypothesize that the protective effects of breastfeed-
ing are partly due to the influence of breastfeeding on the in-
testinal microbiota, which may be disrupted by antibiotic use.
Wetestedthishypothesisinaretrospectivecohortstudyof226
children aged 2 to 6 years. Furthermore, as it is currently un-
known whether the duration of breastfeeding has any long-
term effects on the microbiota, we investigated this issue by
analyzing the microbiota of a subcohort of these children in
relation to the duration of breastfeeding and antibiotic use by
the child during breastfeeding.
Methods
The study cohort consisted of 226 children who participated
in a probiotic trial from October 1, 2009, through April 30,
2010.14 The original trial was approved by the Ethics Commit-
tee of Joint Authority of Kainuu Region (clinicaltrials.gov iden-
tifier NCT01014676). The parents provided written informed
consent. The original trial involved a larger cohort (501 chil-
dren), from which a subset of 226 children with full records
of breastfeeding duration, weight, height, and consent to re-
trieveantibioticpurchaseinformationwasselectedforthecur-
rent study, conducted from June 2015 to December 2015. Of
the 226 children selected for the study, 142 children provided
fecal samples for microbiota analysis. This retrospective study
involving antibiotic purchase records received approval from
the ethical committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and
Uusimaa.
Exclusion criteria in the original study were milk allergy,
lactose intolerance, congenital heart disease requiring regu-
lar medication, malignant diseases, cytostatic treatment, use
of biological rheumatic medication, continuous microbial
medication, regular use of oral corticosteroids, diabetes, and
simultaneous participation in other clinical trials. All chil-
drenattendeddaycareandresidedinthesameregioninnorth-
ern Finland at the time of the study. They were therefore ex-
posed to a shared environment and diet. They were also
ethnically highly homogeneous, almost exclusively of
Finnish background.
Information on the total duration of breastfeeding was col-
lected in a questionnaire completed by the mothers at the be-
ginning of the trial, when the children were aged 2 to 6 years.
Informationonthedurationofexclusivebreastfeedingwasnot
available. In the beginning of the trial, the children were mea-
sured for weight and height. These were used to generate body
mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) z scores according to LMS para-
meters obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention; z scores higher than 2 indicated overweight, and
z scores lower than −2 indicated underweight. Lifetime anti-
biotic use records, a proxy for bacterial infections, for the study
children were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution
of Finland, which maintains a database of all reimbursed pre-
scription drug purchases and eligibility for special reimburse-
ment due to physician-diagnosed chronic disease, in this
cohort asthma or allergic dermatitis.
The Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze the differ-
ence in antibiotic use per month per child during breastfeed-
ing and during the year after weaning. Antibiotic use during
the first year of life and lifetime antibiotic use (calculated as
antibiotic use after 4 months following weaning) were mod-
eled using generalized linear models, assuming the negative
binomial distribution. In the model for lifetime antibiotic use,
the age of the child was used as an offset. For the analyses of
lifetime antibiotic use and BMI z score, the children were di-
vided into 2 equal-sized groups based on their antibiotic use
before or immediately after weaning: children who did not re-
ceive antibiotics during breastfeeding through 4 months af-
ter weaning (n = 113; no early-life antibiotics) and those who
received antibiotics during breastfeeding through 4 months af-
ter weaning (n = 113; early-life antibiotic users). Groupwise
characteristics are presented in the Table. In the lifetime
antibiotic use and BMI z score models, the interaction be-
tween early-life antibiotic use and the duration of breastfeed-
ing was assessed, after which the effect of breastfeeding du-
ration was analyzed separately in both antibiotic use groups.
We further subdivided the early-life antibiotic users into those
Key Points
Question Does antibiotic use in children during breastfeeding
influence the long-term health benefits of breastfeeding?
Findings Breastfeeding decreased the number of postweaning
antibiotic courses and decreased body mass index in later
childhood. The protective effect of breastfeeding against high
body mass index in later childhood was evident only in the
children with no antibiotic use during the breastfeeding period.
Meaning The results suggest that the metabolic benefits of
breastfeeding are largely conveyed by the intestinal microbiota,
which is disturbed by antibiotic treatment.

receivingpenicillin-typeantibiotics(mainlyamoxicillin,n = 78)
during early life and those receiving other antibiotics (macro-
lides, cephalosporins, or sulfonamide-trimethoprim, n = 35),
and we tested for the interaction between antibiotic type and
breastfeeding duration. No adjustment variables were in-
cluded in the univariate models, as we did not have informa-
tion on potentially important background variables such as
maternal BMI, birth mode, or socioeconomic status.
We have previously analyzed the fecal microbiota com-
position in the cohort and found that antibiotic use is an ex-
tremely strong driver of microbiota composition.15 In addi-
tion, BMI and asthma diagnosis were associated with the
microbiota composition. Hence, to eliminate the overriding ef-
fect of different antibiotic use histories, BMI, and asthma or
atopy, for the analysis of the association between duration of
breastfeeding and the microbiota we selected a subcohort con-
sisting of 42 children. We excluded all children who had used
antibiotics within 6 months prior to sample donation, had re-
ceived more than 10 antibiotic courses in their lifetime, had
never used antibiotics (2 cases excluded to avoid different an-
tibioticusebackgroundsinthedifferentbreastfeedinggroups),
had asthma or atopy, had a BMI z score less than −2 (under-
weight) or greater than 2 (overweight), or had fewer than 6610
DNA sequencing reads. If both fecal samples collected from a
child fulfilled the criteria, we calculated the average micro-
biota composition over the 2 samples. Children with interme-
diate breastfeeding duration (7 or 8 months) were excluded to
classify the children into distinct categories: short duration of
breastfeeding(0-6months)withantibioticusebythechilddur-
ing breastfeeding (n = 0); short duration of breastfeeding
(0-6 months) without antibiotic use by the child during breast-
feeding (n = 19); long duration of breastfeeding (8-16 months)
with antibiotic use by the child during breastfeeding (n = 11);
or long duration of breastfeeding (8-16 months) without anti-
biotic use by the child during breastfeeding (n = 12). We com-
pared the microbiota composition of those with long breast-
feeding duration and no antibiotic use (12 children) with that
of the composition in the group with short breastfeeding du-
ration and no antibiotic use (19 children) and the group with
long breastfeeding duration and antibiotic use (11 children) to
analyze the influence of the duration of breastfeeding and
antibiotic use during breastfeeding on the microbiota.
The fecal samples were collected at home and trans-
ported immediately to the study center for storage at −70°C
or were initially stored in the home freezer for 0.5 to 78 hours
(mean [SD], 19 [11] hours) before being transported to the study
center. The DNA was extracted using the Promega Genomic
Wizard DNA Purification Kit, followed by 454 Titanium py-
rosequencing on a GS FLX instrument (Roche Diagnostics)
of the V4 to V6 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (prim-
ers S-D-Bact-0564-a-S-15/S and Univ-1100-a-A-15). The
sequences were filtered for chimeras with the UCHIME
program.16 Reads shorter than 501 base pairs were filtered out.
After preprocessing, we had a mean (SD) of 8801 (1704) reads/
sample (range, 1469-14653 reads/sample). De novo opera-
tionaltaxonomicunitpickingwasdoneusingQIIMEsoftware.17
To avoid batch effects, we normalized the data following a

Results
Protective Effects of Breastfeeding
Are Weakened by Antibiotic Use
We analyzed the associations between the duration of breast-
feeding,antibioticuse,andBMIzscoresinacohortof226Finn-
ish children aged 2 to 6 years (mean [SD] age, 55 [1.4] months;
54% male) (Table). Almost all children (97%) were breastfed
for at least 1 month. The mean (SD) duration of breastfeeding
was 8 (4.4) months (range, 0-18 months; median, 8 months;
interquartile range, 5-12 months). By ages 1 and 2 years, 57%
and88%ofthechildrenhadreceivedatleast1antibioticcourse,
respectively. Among the 226 children included in the study,
113 had no antibiotic use before weaning and 113 had early-
life antibiotic use.
Breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in antibi-
otic use, ie, a reduction in bacterial infections. The frequency
of antibiotic use before weaning (mean [SD], 0.06 [0.1] course/
month, or 0.7 [1.3] course/year) was significantly lower than
during the year after weaning (mean [SD], 0.21 [0.2] course/
month, or 2.5 [2.7] courses/year) (odds ratio of antibiotic use
afterweaningvsbeforeweaning,7.5;95%CI,4.9-11.2;P < .001).
Each month of breastfeeding was associated with a 6% reduc-
tion in the number of antibiotic courses during the first year
of life (95% CI, 2%-10%; P = .003), amounting to a 72% reduc-

tion in antibiotic courses in infants breastfed for the whole first
year compared with those not breastfed.
Lifetime antibiotic use, defined as the number of antibi-
otic courses purchased for the child after 4 months following
weaning,wasnegativelyassociatedwiththedurationofbreast-
feeding, and the association was stronger among the children
with no early-life antibiotic use. In this group, each month of
breastfeeding was associated with a 5% reduction in lifetime
antibiotic use (95% CI, 2%-8%; P = .001), translating to a 60%
reduction in lifetime antibiotic use in children breastfed for 12
months (Figure 1). Among the children who had received an-
tibiotics before weaning, the relationship was only border-
line significant (P = .04) (Figure 1), and each month of breast-
feeding was associated with a 4% (95% CI, 0%-7%) reduction
in antibiotic use. There was no evidence for an interaction be-
tween breastfeeding and antibiotic group (P = .53), as the same
negativetrendwasobservedinbothgroups.Breastfeedingwas
estimated to have a 1.6% weaker effect on antibiotic use in the
early-life antibiotic users (95% CI, 6% weaker effect to 3%
stronger effect). Similarly, among the early-life antibiotic us-
ers, the antibiotic type did not significantly modify the rela-
tionshipbetweenbreastfeedingandlifetimeantibioticuse.The
effect of penicillin use was estimated to be 5% weaker than the
use of other types of antibiotics (95% CI, 14% weaker to 3%
stronger; P = .27).
The duration of breastfeeding was negatively associated
with BMI z scores among the children who did not receive an-
tibiotics during early life: each month of breastfeeding was as-
sociated with a 0.08-unit reduction in BMI z scores (95% CI,
0.04 to 0.11; P < .001) (Figure 2), translating to a whole z score
unit reduction in children breastfed for 12 months compared
with the nonbreastfed children. However, among the chil-
dren who received antibiotics during early life, the duration
of breastfeeding showed no association with BMI z scores (es-
timated 1% increase; 95% CI, −3% to 5%; P = .50) (Figure 2).
Eachmonthofbreastfeedingwasestimatedtohavea9%stron-
ger reduction in BMI z scores among the children with no early-
life antibiotics compared with those with early-life antibiot-
ics(95%CI,4%to14%strongerreduction;P = .002),supporting
the modifying role of early antibiotic use in the relationship
between breastfeeding and BMI z score. The antibiotic type re-
ceived in early life did not significantly modify the relation-
ship between breastfeeding and BMI z score; the duration of
breastfeedingwasestimatedtohavea6%weakereffectonBMI
z scores in the children with early-life penicillin courses com-
pared with children with other antibiotic courses in early life
(95% CI, 16% weaker effect to 4% stronger effect; P = .22).

eralizedlinearmodelP = .36).Thedistributionswerealsofairly
similar between the groups (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
As is evident from the clustering of the different groups
by colors (Figure 3A), the major driver of interindividual dif-
ferences in microbiota composition was the early-life antibi-
otic use and duration of breastfeeding, regardless of age. The
children with long breastfeeding duration with no antibiotic
use during breastfeeding separated from the other groups,
especially clearly from the group with long breastfeeding du-
ration and antibiotic use. Principal coordinates analysis com-
ponent 1, which explained 26% of the variance, mostly differ-
entiated the groups and correlated negatively with the
abundance of Akkermansia (r = −0.51; 95% CI, −0.71 to −0.25;
P < .001) and Bifidobacterium (r = −0.43; 95% CI, −0.65 to
−0.15; P = .004) species. The group with long breastfeeding
duration and no early-life antibiotic use had a significantly
higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria in relation to
Firmicutes compared with the other groups (Figure 3B and
eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The ratio of Actinobacteria to
Firmicutes was 76% lower in the children with long duration
of breastfeeding and early-life antibiotics (95% CI, 117% to
36%lower;P < .001)and57%smallerinthechildrenwithshort
duration of breastfeeding (95% CI, 93% to 20% smaller;
P = .003) compared with the group with long duration of
breastfeeding and no antibiotics. The ratio of Verrucomicrobia
to Firmicutes was 89% lower in the children with long dura-
tion of breastfeeding and early-life antibiotics (95% CI, 152%
to 26% lower; P = .007) and 84% smaller in the children with
short duration of breastfeeding (95% CI, 140% to 28% smaller;
P = .004) compared with the group with long duration of
breastfeeding and no antibiotics.
In more detailed analysis it was evident that children with
short breastfeeding duration (0-6 months) and no early-life an-
tibiotic use or with long breastfeeding duration (8-16 months)
and early-life use of antibiotics had a significantly lower abun-
dance of Bifidobacterium (by 55%; 95% CI, 43% to 87%;
P = .006; and 39%; 95% CI, 30% to 68%; P < .001, respec-

and 2.2-fold; 95% CI, 1.3- to 3.8-fold; P = .006, respectively)
(Figure 4). The abundance of Bacteroides species was signifi-
cantly higher in the group with early-life antibiotic use com-
pared with both groups without early-life antibiotic use (4.2-
foldhighercomparedwiththechildrenwithlongbreastfeeding
duration and no early-life antibiotic use; 95% CI, 2.0- to 9.2-
fold; P < .001) (Figure 4). To confirm that these patterns were
not restricted to the subcohort, we tested for group differ-
ences in the identified organisms among the 142 children. The
same patterns were evident (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), al-
though they were mostly not significant owing to the various
confounding factors such as differences in antibiotic use
history, BMI z score, and asthma or atopy.
Discussion
We combined a detailed data set of a cohort of children aged 2
to 6 years by including questionnaire information, weight and
height measurements, register information on drug pur-
chases, and next-generation sequencing–based analysis of fe-
cal microbiota composition. This data set enabled a thorough
andcontrolledanalysisoftheassociationsbetweenbreastfeed-
ingduration,microbiota,andhealthindicators.Ourresultsshow
that the duration of breastfeeding was associated with long-
term development of the intestinal microbiota, lifetime antibi-
otic use, and risk of overweight, and the association persisted
at least until age 7 years. A major finding was that the protec-
tive effects of breastfeeding against infections and overweight
were weakened or completely eliminated by early-life antibi-
otic use. Furthermore, the apparent promotion of a protective
microbiota by long breastfeeding was also eliminated by anti-
biotic use during breastfeeding. These results suggest that par-
ticularly the long-term metabolic benefits of breastfeeding are
conveyed by the beneficial effects of breast milk on the intes-
tinal microbiota, which are disrupted by antibiotic use.
Both early-life antibiotic use11 and short duration of
breastfeeding1 have independently been shown to increase
weight gain in children but, to our knowledge, their interac-
tive effects have not been assessed. We found that the weight-
increasing effect of early-life antibiotic use overshadows the
protection against overweight endowed by long breastfeed-
ing. This may explain some of the inconsistent results regard-
ing the protection against overweight in previous large
studies where antibiotic use was not analyzed.21
Breastfed children have better satiety and appetite regu-
lation than formula-fed children,22 which could be partly due
to the differences in microbiota, as the short-chain fatty ac-
ids produced by bacteria in the intestine influence gut hor-
mones related to satiety and energy homeostasis.23,24 In ad-
dition, short-chain fatty acids are involved in the epigenetic
programming of metabolism-regulating genes.25 Bacterial me-
tabolism of bile acids has a significant role in the metabolic
regulation of the host.26 Bile acid modification by the intesti-
nal bacteria influences hepatic lipid and sugar metabolism and
regulates the host’
s energy homeostasis and weight.27 The

secondary bile acids produced by bacteria are strong activa-
tors of TGR5, which increases basal energy expenditure.26
Bifidobacterium species and Akkermansia muciniphila,
both of which were reduced in relative abundance in the chil-
dren with short duration of breastfeeding or early-life antibi-
otic use, are known to specialize in host glycan use and are ca-
pable of growing in breast milk.28,29 Both Bifidobacterium and
Akkermansiahavebeenassociatedwithprotectionagainstdiet-
induced obesity and related metabolic effects in rodents,23,30
and supplementation with a bifidogenic synbiotic has been
shown to reduce weight in overweight children.31 In humans,
obesityandrelatedmetabolicmarkershavebeenshowntocor-
relate negatively with the abundance of Bifidobacterium and
Akkermansia.32,33Thebeneficialmetaboliceffectsofthesespe-
cies are thought to arise at least partly from improved gut bar-
rier function, which reduces metabolic endotoxemia.23,30
Furthermore, many Bifidobacterium species carry bile salt hy-
drolase genes (bsh) and are able to perform the first step in
bacterial bile acid metabolism.34
Several bacteria belonging to the large group of
Clostridia, whose relative abundance was increased in the chil-
dren with early weaning or early-life antibiotic use, special-
ize in the degradation of plant-derived polysaccharides. In
infants, the increased abundance of the polysaccharide-
fermenting Firmicutes and decreased abundance of bifido-
bacteria after weaning have been associated with increased
weight gain and adiposity.10,35 Increased abundance of
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been observed in obese chil-
dren aged 10 to 15 years compared with lean children aged 10
to 15 years.36 A reduced Actinobacteria to Firmicutes ratio has
been observed in response to genetic and diet-induced obe-
sity in mice.37 Overall, the results suggest that a prematurely
adult-like microbiota in childhood, consisting largely of
Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, may promote weight gain. A
microbiota dominated by human milk oligosaccharide–using
bifidobacteria and Akkermansia may be associated with
enhanced gut barrier development, reduced circulating lipo-
polysaccaride and inflammation, and increased bile acid me-
tabolism,leadingtoincreasedamountsofsecondarybileacids,
increased energy expenditure, and possibly slower growth.
Long breastfeeding duration has been shown to protect
against infections in early life.1 According to our results, the
protectionwasstillevidentatage6years,especiallyinthechil-
dren with no antibiotic use during early life. The relationship
appeared weaker among the early-life antibiotic users, sug-
gesting that microbiota may contribute to but not fully ex-
plain the protective effects of breastfeeding against infec-
tions in later life. However, early-life antibiotic use did not
statistically significantly modify the association between
breastfeeding duration and lifetime antibiotic use.
We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the ob-
served effects of breastfeeding may have been due to poten-
tial confounding effects of birth mode, infant birth weight, life-
style,diet,maternaleducation,ormaternalBMI.Furthermore,
if the mothers of the infants who needed antibiotics in early
life reported the breastfeeding duration less accurately than
those of healthy infants, some of the results may have been
caused by recall bias. We cannot exclude the possibility of se-
lection bias affecting the results. We were unable to include
the entire cohort of 501 children owing to missing informa-
tion and denial of consent to retrieve the drug purchase data.
Furthermore, the exclusion criteria in the original study as well
as the selection of samples for the analyses may reduce the
generalizabilityoftheresults.Themicrobiotaresultsapplyonly
to children with no recent and moderate lifetime use of
antibiotics, normal BMI, and no asthma or atopy.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that short duration of breastfeeding and
antibiotic use before weaning are associated with microbiota
development toward a composition that may increase
weight gain. Promoting the natural development of the
microbiota may be an effective way to improve long-term
health in children.
