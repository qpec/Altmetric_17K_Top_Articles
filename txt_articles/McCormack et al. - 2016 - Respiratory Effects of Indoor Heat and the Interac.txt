Abstract
Rationale: There is limited evidence of the effect of exposure to heat
on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) morbidity, and
the interactive effect between indoor heat and air pollution has not
been established.
Objectives: To determine the effect of indoor and outdoor heat
exposureonCOPDmorbidityandtodeterminewhetherairpollution
concentrations modify the effect of temperature.
Methods: Sixty-nine participants with COPD were enrolled in a
longitudinalcohortstudy,anddatafromthe601participantdaysthat
occurred during the warm weather season were included in the
analysis. Participants completed home environmental monitoring
with measurement of temperature, relative humidity, and indoor air
pollutants and simultaneous daily assessment of respiratory health
with questionnaires and portable spirometry.
Measurements and Main Results: Participants had moderate
to severe COPD and spent the majority of their time indoors.
Increases in maximal indoor temperature were associated with
worsening of daily Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale scores
and increases in rescue inhaler use. The effect was detected on the
same day and lags of 1 and 2 days. The detrimental effect of
temperature on these outcomes increased with higher
concentrations of indoor fine particulate matter and nitrogen
dioxide (P , 0.05 for interaction terms). On days during which
participants went outdoors, increases in maximal daily outdoor
temperature were associated with increases in Breathlessness,
Cough, and Sputum Scale scores after adjusting for outdoor
pollution concentrations.
Conclusions: For patients with COPD who spend the majority of
their time indoors, indoor heat exposure during the warmer months
represents a modifiable environmental exposure that may contribute
to respiratory morbidity. In the context of climate change, adaptive
strategies that include optimization of indoor environmental
conditions are needed to protect this high-risk group from the
adverse health effects of heat.

2125
 Understanding the health effects of climate
change has been identified as a research
priority by the American Thoracic Society
and other leading health organizations
(1–7). The anticipated increases in
temperature represent one aspect of climate
change that has been associated with adverse
health consequences. Global average
temperatures are projected to increase by
1.4–5.8% by the end of the century, and heat
waves are projected to be more frequent,
intense, and longer lasting (8). It is critical to
understand the health implications of heat
exposure to protect those at greatest risk (9).
Previous population-level studies have
demonstrated that heat waves are associated
with increases in mortality (10, 11) and that
certain populations, including those with
underlying respiratory and cardiac disease,
are likely to be at increased risk (12, 13).
Studies investigating the impact of heat
on morbidity using hospitalization and
emergency visit records have also identified
high-risk subgroups (14–17). To date,
disease-specific indicators of morbidity
have not been assessed, and studies have
rarely used individual-level exposure
assessment (18). Few studies have
investigated the effect of indoor
temperature on respiratory health, and
the interactive effect between indoor
temperature and indoor air pollution is
unknown. It is important to understand the
effects of the indoor environment because
individuals spend the majority of their time
indoors and this is projected to increase in
the context of climate change (8, 19).
Furthermore, actions such as using air
conditioning, cooling centers, and energy-
efficient building designs can reduce indoor
heat exposure, and these can be deployed
immediately at the individual and local
levels.
To develop strategies to protect
individuals from the adverse consequences
of heat exposure, it is necessary to improve
our understanding of the specific health
consequences among high-risk groups. In
this study, we sought to understand the
health effects of heat among individuals with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), using disease-specific respiratory
health outcomes. We hypothesized that
(1) increases in indoor and outdoor
temperature during the warmer months
would be associated with increases in
daily respiratory symptoms and rescue
medication use and decreases in lung
function among participants with COPD,
and (2) increases in air pollution exposure
would modify the effects of temperature,
enhancing the detrimental effects of
increases in temperature on these daily
indicators of COPD morbidity.
Methods
Participant Recruitment and
Study Design
Participants provided written informed
consent, and the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutional Review Board approved the
protocol. Participants and methods have
been described previously (20). Briefly,
participants were former smokers with
COPD who were recruited from the
Baltimore area and studied at baseline and
at 3 and 6 months as part of the COPD and
Domestic Endotoxin Study. To determine
the health effects of heat, we restricted
analysis to the warm weather season,
defined as the time between the first and
last day that the maximal outdoor
temperature exceeded 908F in Baltimore for
each calendar year. Sixty-nine of 84
participants were monitored during this
warm weather season. Fifty-four were
monitored for 1 week, and 15 were
monitored for 2 weeks. Participants
completed health and demographic
questionnaires, and spirometry was
performed according to American Thoracic
Society criteria (21, 22).
Environmental Monitoring of Heat and
Air Quality
A home environmental assessment was
completed; this included a home inspection
and continuous environmental monitoring
over a 1-week period to capture daily indoor
temperature and humidity and weekly
particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen
dioxide (NO2). Participants completed
a daily activity diary during the
environmental monitoring period. Air
sampling occurred in the main living area,
identified as a room other than the
bedroom where the participant reported
spending the most time. Additional
methods are provided in the online
supplement and in a prior publication (20).
Outdoor temperature, humidity, and
pollution concentrations (PM, NO2, and
ozone) were obtained from publicly
available data sets provided by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
and the Environmental Protection Agency
(see Table E1 in the online supplement)
(23, 24).
COPD Daily Respiratory
Health Outcomes
Participants completed daily questionnaires
and performed spirometry during home
environmental monitoring. The validated
Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale
(BCSS) contains three questions, each of
which assesses a symptom using a Likert-
type scale ranging from 0 to 4. A change in
total score of 0.3–0.4 is considered mild,
whereas a change of 1.0 is considered
substantial (25). Handheld spirometry was
also performed daily (PiKo-1; nSpire
Health, Inc., Longmont, CO). Frequency of
rescue inhaler medication use was captured
in a daily diary as zero, one, two, three, or
four or more times daily.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were analyzed using
Spearman correlations, chi-square tests, and
t tests. At each time point, daily maximal
temperature was used as the primary
exposure variable in generalized estimating
equation models to account for repeated
measures. Models for indoor and outdoor
temperature were run separately and were
adjusted for age, sex, education, visit
(baseline or 3 or 6 mo), and baseline
percent predicted FEV1. Pack-years of
smoking were used to account for disease
severity for models in which the primary
outcome was lung function.
Models were constructed to account for
pollutant concentrations; models of indoor
temperature included indoor daily average
humidity and weekly average indoor PM2.5
and NO2. Models of outdoor temperature
included daily average outdoor humidity,
PM2.5, NO2, and ozone. Lag terms were
created to assess same-day and subsequent-
day health effects. To assess effect
modification, interaction terms were
created between pollution and temperature
variables. To illustrate the temperature
effects at given pollution concentrations,
models were used to calculate the outcomes
of interest for pollutant concentrations at
the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, using
average or mode values for other variables.
Interaction terms and stratified models
were created to investigate whether time
spent outdoors modified the effect of
outdoor temperature on COPD. Sensitivity
analyses were performed using the 95th
percentile values of temperature, rather than

 the maximal values, and excluding extreme
outliers. Analyses were performed with Stata
SE statistical software, version 11.0 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX). Statistical
significance was defined as a P value ,0.05.
Results
Study participants were older individuals
with moderate or severe COPD and
impaired pulmonary function (Table 1).
Between 2009 and 2011, there were 601
participant study days in the warm
weather season. Participants spent a
substantial amount of time indoors and
only went outdoors on 46% of these days.
On the days during which participants
went outdoors, the mean (SD) time
outdoors was 2.0 (2.1) hours. The mean
(SD) daily maximal indoor and outdoor
temperatures were 80 (7)8F and 85(9)8F,
respectively (Figure 1). There was only
moderate correlation between daily
indoor and outdoor maximal
temperatures (Spearman’s r = 0.44,
P , 0.01).
Eighty-five percent of participants had
either central air conditioning or window
units. Central air conditioning was reported
to have been used on 50% of the study days,
and window air conditioning unit use was
reported to have been used on 18% of the
study days. Participants reported that they
did not use air conditioning at all on 37% of
the study days that occurred during the
warm season. The maximal indoor
temperature was lower on days on which
participants reported using central air
conditioning compared with days on which
they did not (mean [SD], 81.4 [6.4] vs. 79.0
[7.0]8F, respectively, P , 0.01)
Effect of Indoor Temperature on
COPD Morbidity
Increases in maximal daily indoor
temperature were associated with increases
in symptoms as measured using the BCSS,
and with increases in the frequency of rescue
inhaler use. These associations persisted
even after accounting for indoor pollutant
concentrations, including indoor NO2 and
indoor PM2.5. For example, a 108F increase
in indoor temperature was associated with a
0.38 increase in BCSS score (95% CI,
0.01–0.67; P = 0.01), even after adjustment
for indoor relative humidity, PM2.5, and
NO2. Inclusion of lag terms in these
models suggested that increases in indoor
temperatures had an immediate (same-day)
effect, as well as an effect that was
detectable 1–2 days after exposure.
We found no detectable effect of daily
changes in indoor temperature on daily
measurements of lung function, using either
morning or evening FEV1 (evening values
are shown in Table 2). Sensitivity analyses
conducted excluding extreme temperature
outliers (.1108F) and using the 95th
percentile value of daily indoor temperature
yielded similar results (Table E2). An
evaluation of interaction terms and
stratified models suggested an enhanced
effect of indoor temperature on the use of
rescue inhalers among participants who
had more advanced COPD (coefficient
0.27, P = 0.06 for FEV1 <50% predicted;
coefficient 0.01, P = 0.816 among those
with FEV1 >50% predicted; P for
interaction = 0.048) but did not suggest that
disease severity influenced the effect of
indoor heat on symptoms. Stratified models
also suggested an enhanced effect of indoor
temperature on symptoms and rescue
inhaler use on days during which
participants did not go outdoors (Table E3).
Interactive Effect of Indoor Pollution
and Indoor Temperature
In models investigating the effect of indoor
temperature on BCSS and on rescue inhaler
use, significant positive interactions were
detected between PM2.5 and temperature
(interaction term P , 0.001 in both
models). Similarly, significant positive
interactions were detected between indoor
NO2 and temperature (interaction term
P , 0.05 in the BCSS model and ,0.001 in
the rescue inhaler model).
To illustrate the positive interactive
effect, Table 3 provides estimates of the
effect of a 108F increase in temperature at
given percentiles of indoor pollutant
concentrations and demonstrates that the
effect of temperature is greater with
increasing indoor pollutant concentrations.
For example, a participant residing in a
home that had an indoor PM2.5
concentration at the 25th percentile of the
study homes (5 mg/m3) would experience
an increase of 0.4 in BCSS score (indicative
of a mild increase in symptoms) for every
108F increase in indoor temperature,

 whereas an individual in a home at the 75th
percentile (16 mg/m3) would experience an
increase of 1 in BCSS score (indicative of a
severe increase in symptoms) (25). Models
investigating lung function as the outcome
did not demonstrate an interactive effect
between indoor temperature and pollutants.
Effect of Outdoor Temperature on
COPD Morbidity
Daily maximal outdoor temperature was
not significantly associated with
respiratory symptoms, rescue medication
use, or lung function in the overall cohort
(Table 4). Because participants reported
going outdoors on fewer than one-half
of the study days in the warm weather
season, we performed analyses stratified
by days on which participants reported
going outdoors and assessed for
interaction by time outdoors. Stratified
models suggested a significant association
between increasing outdoor temperature
and respiratory symptoms on days during
which participants went outdoors.
There were no statistically significant
interactions between outdoor
temperature and outdoor air pollutants,
including PM2.5, NO2, and ozone (data
not shown).
Discussion
This study is among the first to describe the
effect of heat exposure on disease-specific
morbidity outcomes in those with COPD, a
group that has been identified as at a high
risk of the detrimental health effects of
heat, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is
the first to report an interactive effect
between indoor temperature and indoor
pollution.
In a cohort of participants with
moderate to severe COPD, we found that
increases in home indoor temperature
during warmer weather were associated with
increases in daily indicators of COPD
morbidity, including respiratory symptoms
and rescue inhaler medication use.
There was a positive interaction between
temperature and indoor air pollution,
including PM2.5 and NO2, such that the
effect of indoor heat was greater in the
presence of higher indoor air pollutant
concentrations.
In this study population, participants
spent a great deal of time indoors and
ventured outdoors on only one-half of the
study days. Outdoor temperature was
associated with increased respiratory
symptoms on these days. In the context
of the anticipated increase in temperatures
related to climate change, these findings
suggest that adaptive strategies targeting the
indoor environment provide an opportunity
to minimize the health risks for those with
COPD.
Our results are consistent with and
extend previous findings that have
demonstrated adverse health consequences
of heat exposure. Previous studies have
largely used ambient data to assign exposure
and have linked this to population health

 effects with compelling results. Such studies
have identified elderly individuals and those
with underlying cardiac and respiratory
diseases, including COPD, as at an increased
risk of adverse health effects of heat
exposure (12, 15, 26–29).
For example, a time series study
across 12 cities in the United States
demonstrated increases in deaths
attributable to COPD during hot weather,
with differences between hot and cold
cities. In cold cities, hot temperatures were
associated with an increase in the risk of
death attributable to COPD by as much
as 25% (12) with immediate, same-day
effects. In hot cities, the effect of hot
temperatures was attenuated and delayed,
with a 6% increase in COPD deaths at
lags of 3 and 4 days.
A study in New York City examined
COPD morbidity using hospitalization data
and found that the same-day risk of COPD
hospitalization increased by 7.6% for every
one-degree Celsius increase above a
threshold temperature of 298C (17), and
that there was a detectable but smaller
association between temperature and
respiratory hospitalization when applying a
1-day lag.
Other studies have used Medicare
data to provide estimates of effect that are
representative of a broader portion of the
population of the United States (15, 30).
In a study that included 12.5 million
elderly individuals in 213 urban counties
in the United States, there was a 4.7%
increased risk of hospitalization for
COPD for every 108F increase in ambient
temperature, and the findings were not
attributable to air pollution health
effects (15). Heat and respiratory
hospitalizations were associated most
strongly on the day of exposure in this
study; the effect was still present and
significant at a lag of 1 day and no longer
detectable at 2 days. The ecologic design
of such studies and the potential for
bias caused by measurement error in
exposure assignment have been
limitations; these limitations are
addressed in this study, which provides
individual-level data.
Researchers who previously
investigated the interactive effect of
temperature and air pollution have
reported mixed results, with little evidence
for differences in COPD outcomes. For
example, in a study conducted in Brisbane,
Australia, PM10 modified the effect of
temperature on respiratory hospital
admissions, but there was no interactive
effect for respiratory emergency visits
(31). Basu and colleagues examined
temperature and mortality in California
and did not find that pollution modified
the effect of temperature (32). In a study
of nine European cities included in the
EuroHEAT project, the effect of heat on
overall mortality and cardiovascular
mortality was increased on high-PM10
and high-ozone days, but the interactive
effect of these pollutants and heat on
respiratory mortality was less
evident (33).
Ren and colleagues (31) analyzed data
from 98 urban communities in the U.S.
National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air
Pollution Study and found that ozone
modified the risk of cardiovascular
mortality. However, their results did not
include respiratory mortality as an
outcome measure. Zanobetti and Schwartz
studied nine cities in the United States
during the warm season and did not find
evidence that outdoor PM2.5 or ozone
modified the relationship between
increasing outdoor temperature and risk of
death (34).
In the current study, we did not find
an interaction between the effects of
outdoor temperature and ozone or PM.
However, there was a consistent signal
demonstrating that increases in indoor
pollution enhanced the adverse effect of
increasing indoor temperature on COPD
symptoms and rescue medication use. To
our knowledge, this is the first study to
report interactive effects of indoor
temperature and air pollution on COPD
morbidity.
Previous studies linking outdoor heat
with hospitalization or death have
demonstrated same-day health effects of
heat exposure or lag times of 1 day (15). Our
findings suggest the health effect of indoor

The estimated effect of a 108F increase in temperature becomes larger with increasing indoor pollutant concentrations (NO2 and PM2.5), demonstrated
for given percentiles. Models used to predict estimated effect included age, sex, education, baseline FEV1, indoor humidity, and either indoor
PM2.5 or indoor NO2.

 heat exposure is immediate and may persist
for 1 to 2 days. Although the mechanisms
of health effects in COPD remain
incompletely understood, proposed
mechanisms include both thermoregulatory
responses (35) and bronchoconstrictive
effects of heat.
Patients with COPD may have an
impaired ability to respond to heat stress. It
has been proposed that heatstroke leads to
increases in intravascular coagulation
caused by the release of IL-1 or IL-6 into the
systemic circulation with activation of
microvascular thrombosis, which may
trigger a respiratory distress syndrome
(36, 37). Studies in asthma suggest that
breathing hot humid air may result in
bronchoconstriction and increased airways
resistance that is mediated via cholinergic
pathways (38, 39). We did not detect an
association between indoor heat and
FEV1. This suggests either that
bronchoconstriction did not affect the
airways resistance captured by the FEV1
outcome measurement or that
bronchoconstriction was not the
mechanism by which participants were
affected by the heat.
Limitations
Because this study was limited to the
Baltimore region, the results may not be
generalizable to other areas of the
country. We used education as an
indicator of socioeconomic status
because household income was not
reflective of socioeconomic status in our
largely retired population, and this
approach may have resulted in some
misclassification of socioeconomic
status. Indoor air monitoring did not
include ozone because previous studies
in Baltimore city have documented
that this exposure is typically low in
homes (40).
Although each participant provided
comprehensive and daily characterization
of the indoor environment and
COPD health outcomes, outdoor
measurements of temperature and
pollutant concentrations were obtained
from central site monitors, which may
have resulted in measurement error in
assigning outdoor exposure to each
individual. This may have contributed
to the weaker associations between outdoor
temperature and COPD morbidity, although
the daily activity diary data would suggest
that the short amount of time spent outdoors
was also a key contributing factor.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that
additional indoor cooling may improve
COPD respiratory health during the
warmer months and that consideration
should be given when traveling outdoors in
warmer weather. Furthermore, our finding
that increases in indoor air pollution
exaggerated the adverse health effects of
indoor heat exposure highlights the
opportunity to improve COPD health
through optimization of the indoor
environment. The participants with COPD
in this study spent the overwhelming
majority of their time indoors during warm
weather days.
Although 86% of the participants had
some form of air conditioning available, air
conditioning was not used on 37% of the
study days. We did not find that education
level was associated with the use of air
conditioning; however, we were limited in
our ability to understand the extent to which
the use of air conditioning was influenced by
financial hardship.
Addressing barriers to air
conditioning use may have potential health
benefits for those with COPD, and future
studies may be needed to fully elucidate
the impact of air conditioning use on
respiratory health in COPD. However,
although air conditioning may provide a
short-term solution for this high-risk group
(41), it is not without consequences.
The use of air conditioning ultimately
contributes to the cycle that perpetuates
climate change and the steady rise in
outdoor temperatures (42). Furthermore,
the associated costs are problematic for
disadvantaged populations in the United
States and around the world.
Ultimately, in addition to adaptive
strategies at the individual and population
level, mitigation strategies are needed
at a policy level to intercept the
alarming rise in outdoor temperatures.
To effectively address this and to provide
the foundation for such policy will require
the interdisciplinary work of urban
planners, public health officials,
engineers, economists, and climate
scientists, in addition to medical
practitioners. n
