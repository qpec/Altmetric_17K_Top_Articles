Abstract: Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on groundwork, joint locks, and
chokeholds. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of injuries sustained during
BJJ training. A 27-question research survey was e-mailed to 166 BJJ gyms in the United States.
Demographic information, belt level, weight class, training hours, competition experience, and injury
prevalence data were collected. The majority of respondents were Caucasian (n = 96) males (n = 121)
with an average age of 30.3 years. Overall, the most common injury locations were to the hand and
fingers (n = 70), foot and toes (n = 52), and arm and elbow (n = 51). The most common medically
diagnosed conditions were skin infections (n = 38), injuries to the knee (n =26), and foot and toes
(n = 19). The most common non-medically diagnosed injuries occurred to the hand and fingers
(n = 56), arm and elbow (n = 40), and foot and toes (n = 33). In general, athletes were more likely to
sustain distal rather than proximal injuries. Athletes reported more frequent medically diagnosed
injuries to the lower extremity and more frequent self-diagnosed injuries to the upper extremity.
Upper extremity injuries appear to be more frequent but less severe than lower extremity injuries
with the opposite being true for lower extremity injuries.

1. Introduction
Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on groundwork, joint locks, and chokeholds
instead of kicks and punches. The sport has Japanese roots, and is specifically influenced by the
technical aspects of Kodokan judo [1]. BJJ came into the spotlight when Royce Gracie won the 1st
and 2nd Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) tournaments in the early 1990s [1,2]. Today, BJJ
tournaments continue to increase in popularity [3]. The graduation system in BJJ rewards athletes
with different colored belts to represent their progress in experience and knowledge. According to the
International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), the belt progression after the age of 17 is as follows:
White, Blue, Purple, Brown, Black, Red and black, Red and white, and Red. Each belt has a minimum
age requirement, and after receiving a blue belt, adults must hold each belt for a specified amount of
time before progressing to the next. The maximum weight allowed in each weight class depends upon
the athletes’ age and sex. The IBJJF weight classes for adults are as follows: Rooster (Male = 57.6 kg,
Female = 48.5 kg), Light Feather (M = 64.2, F = 53.5), Feather (M = 70.1, F = 58.5), Light (M = 76.2,
F = 64.2), Middle (M = 82.3, F = 69.2), Medium Heavy (M = 88.5, F = 74.2), Heavy (M = 94.3, F = 79.4),
Super Heavy (M = 100.7, F = No maximum), Ultra Heavy (M = No maximum) [3].
Athletes within the same weight class and belt level compete against one another. During competition,
matches are overseen by a referee who enforces the rules and regulations of the sport while
simultaneously awarding points. Athletes can score points via takedowns, sweeps, and obtaining

positional control over their opponents. Matches last 2–10 min depending on athlete age and belt level.
These matches may end early via submission, loss of consciousness, athlete disqualification, referee
stoppage, or random pick (if both athletes become injured). If no winner is determined before the
match ends, victory is awarded by point score or referee decision [3].
Prior studies in similar grappling sports, such as wrestling and judo, have shown the impact
of injuries to practitioners [4,5]. Despite an increased interest in BJJ, minimal research regarding the
prevalence of injuries during competition has been conducted [6,7], and no research to our knowledge
has evaluated the prevalence of injuries during training. The purpose of our study is to add to the
available knowledge of injury prevalence in BJJ by investigating injuries that occur during training.
2. Materials and Methods
The Institutional Review Board at our academic center reviewed and approved this project.
A 27-question research survey was e-mailed to 166 BJJ gyms publicly listed as members of the IBJJF
and/or the Gracie Academy. Athletes over the age of 18 with or without injuries sustained in the last
year were included in this study. Eight participants were excluded from the study for not meeting
this inclusion criteria. Demographic information, belt level, weight class, training hours, competition
experience, and injury prevalence data were collected. Athletes were asked to select injuries sustained
within the prior year that occurred during BJJ specific training but not competition or conditioning.
Respondents could indicate more than one injury but were asked to list each individual injury only
once. Survey participants were incentivized by entrance into a random drawing to receive one of four
$25.00 pre-paid credit cards.
3. Results
To analyze the training injuries of BJJ athletes, we reviewed questionnaire results from 140 survey
participants who reported 487 total injuries; 120 of 140 (85.7%) participants reported an injury while
20 denied being injured. Complete athlete demographic information is shown in Table 1. The majority
of the respondents were Caucasian (n = 96, 68.6%) males (n = 121, 87.1%) with an average age of
30.3 years and age range from 18 to 55 years. The distribution of athletes by weight class is shown in
Figure 1. The two most common weight classes were Light (n = 30, 21.4%) and Middle (n = 25, 17.9%)
weight. The distribution of athletes by belt level is found in Figure 2. Individuals with less experience
were more likely to respond, with most athletes having White belts (n = 60, 42.2%) and Blue belts
(n = 45, 32.4%). No respondents had obtained a Red and black, Red and white, or Red belt.

Figure 2. Distribution of athletes by belt level. 
Athletes selected their level of participation in BJJ as one of the following: non-competitor who 
uses BJJ as a form of exercise (n = 36, 25.7%), non-competitor who trains for defense (n = 21, 15.0%), 
amateur competitor (n = 77, 55.0%), and professional competitor (n = 6, 4.3%). The average athlete 
participates in BJJ-specific training 3.7 days per week (StDev 1.56, median 4, range 7), totaling 7.63 
hours per week (StDev 4.87, median 6.25, range 39), and competes in 2.18 competitions per year 
(StDev 2.57, median 2, range 14).  
Injuries were differentiated as medically diagnosed or self-diagnosed. Medically diagnosed 
injuries are those evaluated by a medical professional. Self-diagnosed injuries are self-reported 
injuries the athlete did not seek medical attention for. Self-diagnosed injuries were only included in 
this study if they prevented the athlete from participating in BJJ training for at least one week. This

4. Discussion
BJJ is an increasingly popular martial art but little is known about the incidence and prevalence
of injuries in the sport [3]. Prior research has identified the incidence rate of injury in competition
but has not addressed training injuries [6,7]. This is the first study to our knowledge that addresses
the prevalence of injuries during BJJ training. Discovering the prevalence of injuries in training is
important because athletes spend more time in training than in competition. As evidenced by our
study, the average athlete participates in BJJ specific training approximately four days per week but
only competes in two tournaments per year. Athletes, coaches, and medical professionals may use this
information to better understand what injuries are more likely to occur in training.
Overall, the most common injuries occurred to the distal extremities. The two most common
injuries occurred to the hands and fingers and the foot and toes. The third and fourth most injured
locations were slightly more proximal and occurred to the arm and elbow and the knee. This pattern
of increased distal injury potentially has a sport-specific etiology. The hands and fingers have much
contact time with the opponent and are used to grasp the opponent’s clothing and body to maintain
control, increasing the potential for injury. The feet and toes of the BJJ athlete may be at an increased
risk of injury because athletes are barefoot when they train. Moreover, both fingers and toes can get
caught in the opponent’s clothing or the gym mat the athletes train on.
Skin infections were the most common medically diagnosed injury. We hypothesize that athletes
tend to seek medical treatment for skin infections more frequently than other injuries due to concern of
spreading a potentially contagious infection to their training partners; other injuries would not directly
affect other athletes. However, skin infections may simply be more prevalent.
Our study indicates that athletes were more likely to seek medical attention for lower extremity
injuries. Injuries to the knee and foot/toes were the second and third most common body parts to
be injured. In contrast, the most common self-diagnosed injuries involved the upper extremities:
hands/fingers, and arm/elbow. Injuries to the upper extremities occur more frequently in training
but are not significant enough to warrant medical attention, while lower extremity injuries occur less
frequently but are more severe. However, athletes may perceive lower extremity injuries as more
significant causing them to seek medical care.
Scoggin et al. found elbow injuries to be the most prevalent orthopedic injury during BJJ
competition [7]. Similarly, Kreiswirth et al. found elbow and knee injuries to have the same rate
of injury in competition [6]. However, our study found that the hand/fingers followed by foot/toes
were the most commonly injured body locations in training. The difference is likely due to the
differing goals of training and competition. In competition, athletes can win a match via submission.
Athletes apply extreme stress to their opponent’s joints to force them to “tap-out” and resign the match.
This may result in injury especially if the opponent refuses to tap-out. In contrast, during training
athletes are less likely to put equivalent stress on their opponent’s joints via submission to avoid
injuring their training partner.

Wrestling and judo are grappling sports similar to BJJ. Agel et al. found the most common injuries
in collegiate wrestling practice to be skin infections (17.2%), knee injuries (14.8%), and ankle injuries
(7.3%) [4]. This is comparable to our finding that skin infections and knee injuries are the most common
medically diagnosed injuries. In the sport of Judo, Green et al. found finger and knee injuries to be
the most prevalent injuries in competition; data on training injuries is not available[5]. This finding
is consistent with our data that hand and finger injuries were the most common overall injuries in
BJJ training.
The goal of this research is to help practitioners of BJJ prevent injury. Coaches can focus their
education and develop their athletes with our results in mind. They can emphasize teaching students
how to avoid the most common injuries with proper technique. Similarly, the athlete can better
recognize the potential for injuries if a certain body part is being manipulated by an opponent.
For example, the athlete can tap-out faster while training to avoid injury. Also, skin infections were the
most common medically diagnosed condition; spread of such infections can be reduced if awareness
is increased.
This study has potential limitations. We sent our survey to BJJ gym directors via publicly available
e-mail addresses and asked them to forward our survey to their adult students. Therefore, we do not
know how many athletes ultimately received our survey and are unable to calculate a response rate.
Recall bias may have affected this study because respondents were asked to list injuries that occurred
within the last year. Determining the etiology of each individual injury was beyond the scope of this
study. A prospective study following a cohort of BJJ athletes would be helpful in determining both the
etiology and incidence rate of injuries in practice. Despite the limitations of this study, we believe it
contributes useful information on training injuries in BJJ athletes across the United States.
5. Conclusions
The goal of this epidemiological study is to determine the prevalence and most common
injuries sustained during BJJ training. Respondents were allowed to report medically diagnosed
and self-diagnosed injuries. Overall, the most common injuries occurred to the hands, fingers, feet,
and toes. This finding indicates athletes were more likely to sustain distal rather than proximal injuries.
Skin infections were the most common medically diagnosed condition, while the most common
self-diagnosed injuries were to the hands and fingers. Athletes reported more frequent medically
diagnosed injuries to the lower extremity and more frequent self-diagnosed injuries to the upper
extremity. Upper extremity injuries appear to be more frequent but less severe when compared to
lower extremity injuries in the BJJ athlete.
