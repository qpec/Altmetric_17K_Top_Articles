Abstract
Aflatoxin, a mycotoxin found commonly in maize and peanuts worldwide, is associated with
liver cancer, acute toxicosis, and growth impairment in humans and animals. In Tanzania,
sunflower seeds are a source of snacks, cooking oil, and animal feed. These seeds are a
potential source of aflatoxin contamination. However, reports on aflatoxin contamination in
sunflower seeds and cakes are scarce. The objective of the current study was to determine
total aflatoxin concentrations in sunflower seeds and cakes from small-scale oil processors
across Tanzania. Samples of sunflower seeds (n = 90) and cakes (n = 92) were collected
across two years, and analyzed for total aflatoxin concentrations using a direct competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For seed samples collected June-August
2014, the highest aflatoxin concentrations were from Dodoma (1.7–280.6 ng/g), Singida
(1.4–261.8 ng/g), and Babati-Manyara (1.8–162.0 ng/g). The highest concentrations for
cakes were from Mbeya (2.8–97.7 ng/g), Dodoma (1.9–88.2 ng/g), and Singida (2.0–34.3
ng/g). For seed samples collected August-October 2015, the highest concentrations were
from Morogoro (2.8–662.7 ng/g), Singida (1.6–217.6 ng/g) and Mbeya (1.4–174.2 ng/g).
The highest concentrations for cakes were from Morogoro (2.7–536.0 ng/g), Dodoma (1.4–
598.4 ng/g) and Singida (3.2–52.8 ng/g). In summary, humans and animals are potentially
at high risk of exposure to aflatoxins through sunflower seeds and cakes from micro-scale
millers in Tanzania; and location influences risk.
Introduction
Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus
parasiticus, which commonly infect food crops such as maize, peanuts, and tree nuts. They
cause liver cancer and aflatoxicosis in humans and animals. The fungi produce four main
types of aflatoxin: aflatoxin B1 [AFB1], B2 [AFB2], G1[AFG1], and G2 [AFG2]. AFB1, the most

 carcinogenic mycotoxin, is typically produced in higher quantities than its counterparts. The
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified “naturally occurring mixes
of aflatoxins” as a Group 1 human carcinogen: known to cause cancer in humans [1].
Chronic exposure to aflatoxin contributes to increased incidence of liver cancer cases
worldwide. It has been estimated that 25,000–155,000 humans die each year of liver cancer
associated with chronic exposure to aflatoxins, through consumption of contaminated
maize and peanuts [2]. Furthermore, chronic exposure to dietary aflatoxin is associated
with immuno-suppression, stunted growth in children, and acute aflatoxicosis at high doses
[3–5]. In the past, human and animal exposure to dietary aflatoxins in Sub-Saharan Africa
was considered to be mainly through consumption of maize and groundnuts. However,
consumption of oilseeds such as sunflower, sesame, and cotton may also contribute signifi-
cantly to the overall human and animal exposure to aflatoxins through food and feed [6–8].
In Tanzania, sunflower is an oilseed crop that provides animal feed and cooking oil. The
Central Sunflower Corridor (CSC), comprised of Mbeya, Iringa, Morogoro, Dodoma, Singida,
Manyara and Karatu-Arusha leads in sunflower farming and sunflower micro-scale oil milling
activities. A report by the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperative
(MAFSC) indicates that annual production in 2008 was approximately 350,000 metric tons
[9]. In 2015, production had increased about tenfold from 2008, due to an increased sunflower
seed market. Therefore, the sunflower industry is an important contribution to the economics
of Tanzania.
Small-scale sunflower farmers make a living by selling sunflower seeds to processors, who
extract cooking oil and produce seed cakes, which consist of the seed residue following extrac-
tion of oil. In 2015, a 70-kg bag of sunflower seeds sold for 60,000 Tanzania Shillings (Tshs)
(US$30) from which one can produce approximately 45 kg of cakes and 20 liters of crude oil
for sale. A 5-kg loss might be due to the poor efficiency of the milling machines. Whereas
humans eat roasted and salted seeds as a snack food, the cakes are used as animal feed for
chickens, dairy cows, and goats. Dodoma, Singida, Arusha and Manyara are the major sun-
flower cake-producing regions in Tanzania; producing approximately 100,000 metric tons of
sunflower cakes per year, which serve as a reliable source of animal feed for livestock in North-
ern Tanzania and Kenya.
Aflatoxin in animal feedstuffs has been a growing concern in the dairy industry due to the
prevalence of aflatoxin M1 (hydroxylated form of AFB1) in dairy products from animals con-
suming AFB1-contaminated feed. Researchers in Kenya found 72% of 439 cow-milk samples
they collected from urban Kenya contaminated with aflatoxin M1 [8]. Researchers in Tanzania
also found aflatoxin M1 contamination in fresh cow milk retailed in Dar es Salaam [10] and in
Singida [11]. Although aflatoxin M1 is less carcinogenic than aflatoxin B1, it also has demon-
strated toxicological effects [12], and infants weaned on contaminated milk may be at high risk
of exposure to aflatoxin M1 and its associated carcinogenic actions. Hence, the United States
Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has set an action level for aflatoxin M1 in milk of
0.5 ng/g, while its action level for total aflatoxins (aflatoxin B1 + B2 + G1 + G2) is 20 ng/g for
human food and dairy-animal feed [13]. Dairy cows fed with feedstuffs and nursing humans
fed with food contaminated with total aflatoxin levels higher than 20 ng/g will likely produce
milk contaminated with aflatoxin M1 levels higher than 0.5 ng/g [14, 15]. However, total afla-
toxin concentrations in sunflower seeds and cakes produced in Tanzania have not been ana-
lyzed or reported leaving questions such as to what magnitude of the risk to human and
animal health from consumption of sunflower products. Therefore, the aim of the present
study was to survey total aflatoxin levels in sunflower seed and cake samples collected from
multiple micro-scale sunflower oil mills across Tanzania.

 Materials and methods
Collection of samples
Permission to collect sunflower seeds and cakes from sunflower processors in the following
towns of Tanzania was granted by a local authority known as Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO). Neither human nor animal subjects were involved in this survey.
In the year 2014 harvest season (June–July), a total of 86 samples (~200 g each sample) of
sunflower seeds (S) and cakes (C) were collected from sunflower processing facilities across
Tanzania. The seed samples (S = 42) and seed cake samples (C = 44) were randomly collected
from individual sunflower oil extractors in the following towns: Mbeya (S = 7; C = 7), Iringa
(S = 7; C = 7), Morogoro (S = 5; C = 5), Dodoma (S = 7; C = 7), Singida (S = 6; C = 6), Babati-
Manyara (S = 6; C = 7), and Karatu-Arusha (S = 4; C = 5).
In year 2015 (September–October), a total of 96 samples (~200 g each sample) were col-
lected. The seed samples (S = 48) and seed cake samples (C = 48) were randomly collected
from sunflower oil extractors in the following towns: Mbeya (S = 9; C = 9), Iringa (S = 7;
C = 7), Morogoro (S = 6; C = 6), Dodoma (S = 7; C = 7), Singida (S = 7; C = 7), Babati-Manyara
(S = 7; C = 7) and Karatu-Arusha (S = 5; C = 5).
All samples were placed in polyethylene bags and taken to Sokoine University of Agricul-
ture for aflatoxin analysis. All samples were stored at -20˚C prior to analysis.
Materials and chemicals
Sunflower seeds and cakes were analyzed using the Veratox1 for aflatoxin ELISA kit (Cat. No.
8030, Neogen Corporation, Glasgow, UK) consisted of aflatoxin standards 0, 5, 15, 50 ng/g; anti-
body wells, conjugate, substrate, and stop reagent; Veratox1 Mycotoxin Starter Kit (9271A);
Mycotoxin Extraction Kit (8052); and Neogen 4700 Micro-well Reader (9303). These materials
were purchased from NeogenEurope Corporation (Reg. No. 18634, St Stephen’s House, 279, Bath
Street, Glasgow, G2, 4JL, UK). HPLC–grade methanol (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as received.
Stock AFB1 standard (10 μg in 10 ml methanol) was purchased from (Trilogy Analytical Labora-
tory Inc. (870 Vossbrink Drive, Washington, MO 63090, USA). De-ionized water was obtained
from Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania).
Aflatoxin analysis
Extraction.
Aflatoxins from the seed and cakes were extracted using an AOAC-approved
method (AOAC-RI 050901) as recommended by Neogen Corporation. A representative sam-
ple (~200 g) of seeds or cakes was thoroughly ground into fine powder using a mill grinder
(IKA1 A11 Basic 07.028450, IKA1 Works, Inc., 2635 North Chase, NC 28405–7419, Wil-
mington, USA). Then, 50 mL of methanol/deionized water (70:30 v/v) were added to the pow-
dered sample (10 g) in a mycotoxin extraction cup (250 mL) to make a suspension, which was
vigorously shaken for 3 min. The suspension was allowed to incubate until all particles settled
to the bottom. The supernatant solution was then decanted, and filtered into a sample tube
using a syringe filled with cotton wool filter. The pH values of all sample solutions ranged
from 6.7 to 7.4.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The extracts were assayed for aflatoxins using
Veratox1 Direct Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in a micro-well
format as indicated by the manufacturer (Neogen Corporation, Glasgow, UK) and Manjula
and coworkers [16]. The lower limit of detection (LOD) of this assay was 1.4 ng/g. Sample con-
centrations below the LOD were reported as not detected (n.d.). Sample concentrations that
exceeded 50 ng/g (the highest concentration of aflatoxin standard) were further diluted. The

 diluted sample concentration was multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the actual concen-
tration of total aflatoxin in the original sample. All samples were analyzed in triplicate to obtain
mean concentrations and standard deviations.
Recovery of AFB1. The sensitivity of the method was determined by calculating percent
recovery of aflatoxin for the seeds and cakes. Using a Hamilton-syringe–fixed needle (Lot
719446; Hamilton Company, P.O. Box 10030, Reno, Nevada), aflatoxin-free sunflower seeds
and cakes powders (among the samples) (10 g) were spiked with AFB1 standard at 10 and 25
ng/g concentrations. AFB1-spiked samples were extracted according to AOAC-RI 050901
method to recover AFB1. The spiked samples were analyzed in triplicate for each spiked con-
centration and averages and standard deviations were determined.
Statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The SAS procedures used were PROC QLIM for multifacto-
rial tobit analysis (allowing for left-censoring at 1.4 ng/g) on aflatoxin concentrations and
PROC GLIMMIX for all multifactorial logistic regression analyses of incidence rates, with
factors including location, year and their interaction [17]. To render sample concentrations
to be more nearly normally distributed for tobit analysis, aflatoxin concentrations were log-
log transformed for analyses, with estimates subsequently back-transformed (antilog-anti-
log) to the scale of observation (i.e, ng/g). Similarly, estimated log odds ratios using logistic
regression analyses on incidence rates were back-transformed to incidence rates with
approximate standard errors determined using the delta method as provided by the PROC
GLIMMIX software. Differences between locations and between years were declared if
P<0.05.
Results
Recovery of AFB1
All recoveries of AFB1 were greater than 70% (Table 1) indicating the suitability of the
approved AFB1 extraction protocol (AOAC-RI050901).

(Morogoro, 0.7 ng/g; Mbeya, 0.2 ng/g; and Karatu, 1.8 ng/g). Dodoma, Babati, and Singida
showed higher ranges (1.7–280.6, 1.8–162.0, and 1.4–261± ng/g, respectively) than Morogoro

samples collected from Iringa. Of seven samples from Dodoma, five were contaminated (71%)
and one of the five samples had highest concentration of 280.6 ng/g. Of six samples from Sin-
gida, five were contaminated (83%) and one sample contained a maximum concentration of
261.8 ng/g, while 83% of the six samples from Babati were contaminated and the maximum
concentration was 162 ng/g. Of seven samples from Mbeya, only one sample (14%) was con-
taminated (1.4 ng/g). Karatu had only four samples of which three were contaminated and the
maximum concentration was 2.7 ng/g.

Sunflower cakes were collected from the same locations indicated in Table 2. The aflatoxin
concentrations, mean aflatoxin concentrations, and tobit model mean estimates of aflatoxin
concentrations in sunflower cake samples are indicated in Table 3. It should be noted that cake
samples collected and reported in Table 3 were residues of seeds that were different from the
seed samples reported in Table 2. Sunflower cakes from Dodoma, and Mbeya had higher aver-
age aflatoxin concentrations (33.5, and 28.8 ng/g, respectively) than the other locations (Sin-
gida, 13.2; Morogoro, 10.8; Babati, 6; Iringa, 2.9; and Karatu, 1.5 ng/g). The concentrations
ranged from 1.9 to 88.2 and 2.8 to 97.7 ng/g in Dodoma and Mbeya, respectively. Lower ranges
of aflatoxin concentrations were observed in Singida (2.0–34.3), Morogoro (2.2–31.9), Babati
(1.7–17.8), Iringa (1.7–5.3) and Karatu (1.5–2.2 ng/g). The highest aflatoxin concentration (98
ng/g) was observed in one of the 6 samples collected from Mbeya. One out of seven samples
from Dodoma was highly contaminated (88.2 ng/g). All cake samples from Dodoma, Singida,
Babati and Iringa were contaminated, whereas sample contamination frequencies from Moro-
goro, Mbeya and Karatu, were 80, 86 and 80%, respectively. Locations in which nearly all

tively) than Iringa (5.7 ng/g), Karatu (1.6 ng/g), Babati (1.2 ng/g) and Dodoma (0.5 ng/g). Fifty
percent (3/6) of the samples from Morogoro were contaminated and one sample (16.7%)
showed a very high concentration (663 ng/g). Eighty-six percent (6/7) of the samples from Sin-
gida, were contaminated with concentrations ranging from 1.6–217.6 ng/g. Eighty-nine per-
cent (8/9) of the samples from Mbeya were contaminated and the highest concentration was
174 ng/g (range: 1.4–174.2 ng/g). Eighty-six percent (6/7) samples from Iringa were contami-
nated (range: 1.5–28.6 ng/g). Dodoma had the lowest range (1.6–20 ng/g) and 29% (2/7) of the
samples were contaminated. Sixty-percent (3/6) of the samples from Karatu were contami-

 ng/g), Mbeya (7.1 ng/g), Babati (3.7 ng/g), Iringa (2.2 ng/g), and Karatu (1.8 ng/g). Based on
their ranges, Dodoma (13.3–598.4 ng/g), Morogoro (2.7–536 ng/g), Mbeya (1.4–20.3 ng/g),
and Singida (3.2–52.8 ng/g) were the only locations that showed maximum concentrations in
their cakes above the action level of 20 ng/g. Iringa, Karatu, and Babati had lower ranges of
1.5–12, 1.7–11.2, and 1.5–13.8 ng/g in cakes, respectively; while all of the samples from Moro-
goro were contaminated with very high aflatoxin concentrations with one having a maximum
concentration of 536.0 ng/g. Fifty-seven percent of the samples from Dodoma were contami-
nated with a maximum concentration of 598.4 ng/g.
Statistical analysis
Our statistical analysis indicated no evidence of interaction in aflatoxin incidence rates in
cakes between year and location. However, there was a strong overall location effect across the
two years. Interestingly, there was a significant interaction between locations and years for
aflatoxin incidences in sunflower seeds. The statistical data showing the incidence rates of afla-
toxin contamination in location and across the two years are shown in Table 6.
Discussion
Sunflower is an important oilseed crop in Tanzania that comprises about 36% of the total
cooking oil consumed in the country each year [9]. Besides cooking oil, sunflower seeds are a
source of sunflower cakes used for dairy and beef cattle and poultry feedstuffs. Tanzanians also
consume roasted and raw sunflower seeds as a food snack. There are a few reports in the litera-
ture indicating that A. flavus and A. parasiticus can infect sunflower and cause aflatoxin accu-
mulation in seeds and cakes [18, 19, 20, 21]. However, there are no reports on potential
aflatoxin contamination of sunflower seeds and cakes grown in Tanzania. The available afla-
toxin reports focus mainly on aflatoxin contamination of agricultural commodities such as
maize, cassava, and market-cured fish [16, 22, 23]. The present study aimed at determining

Aflatoxin in sunflower seeds and cakes in Tanzania
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175801
April 18, 2017

 aflatoxin levels in sunflower seed and cake samples collected from micro- and small-scale sun-
flower oil processors in various locations within Tanzania.
To investigate the extent and recurring nature of aflatoxin contamination in sunflower
seeds and cakes, two surveys were carried out across the country in two consecutive years.
Whereas the overall aflatoxin incidence rate in cakes was greater in 2014 than 2015 (Table 6),
there was no any significant difference in overall aflatoxin incidence rate in seeds between the
two years (P>0.05). The aflatoxin concentrations presented in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 clearly dem-
onstrate that many sunflower seed and cake samples collected in 2014 and 2015 were contami-
nated particularly those from Singida, Dodoma, Morogoro and Babati, which whose many
samples were contaminated with high aflatoxin concentrations above the regulatory limit of 20
ng/g. Singida and Dodoma are in lowland central Tanzania where local climate patterns are
characterized by semi-arid, warm and drought conditions, which are favorable environments
for growth of aflatoxigenic molds [24]. Although there is not a semi-arid climate in Morogoro,
high temperature, high humidity, and drought characterize this location and make it favorable
for aflatoxigenic mold colonization. The climatic features of these locations shown in the sup-
plementary local meteorological data (S1 Fig) indicate that between January and May (the sun-
flower cultivation months) of 2014, Singida and Dodoma had received less rainfall than the
rest of the study locations, suggesting drought conditions. Drought causes stress to plants in
the field, thus rendering them more susceptible to fungal infestation and insect damage,
and exacerbating aflatoxin accumulation in seeds [25, 26]. Moreover, harsh climatic condi-
tions influence the distribution, density, and the structure of A. flavus and A. parasiticus
communities and susceptibility of crop plants to such communities [24, 27, 28]. Thus, per-
haps these harsh conditions may have orchestrated the aflatoxin contamination of the sun-
flower seeds in the field and carried over to the storage facilities before processing and to
cakes after processing.
In contrast, lower aflatoxin incidence rates occurred in regions with moderate climatic con-
ditions, higher altitude, and adequate rainfall; growth of aflatoxin-producing fungi are less
favored in such conditions. These considerations may explain why the aflatoxin means esti-
mates in highland locations such as Iringa, Mbeya, and Karatu were relatively lower (Tables 2,
3, 4 and 5 and S1 Fig) as compared to Singida, Manyara, Dodoma and Morogoro. However,
poor storage facilities and poor post-harvest handling of seeds and cakes are additional risk
factors for increased aflatoxin accumulation in stored crops and can offset the advantages of
moderate climatic conditions [25, 29]. For example, despite its moderate temperature, Mbeya
had high mean estimate of aflatoxin concentration in cakes collected in both years and in
seeds collected in 2015 (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Thus, the findings for Mbeya, Morogoro, Dodoma
and Singida could be due to a collection of risk factors, which are probably poor storage facili-
ties, post-harvest handling and drought.
Inadequate rainfall received during the sunflower growing season of 2014 between March
and April (S1 Fig), the critical period when sunflower flowering and seed maturation usually
occurs, might have caused sunflower plants and seeds to become susceptible to fungal infec-
tions, colonization and consequent aflatoxin contamination in the field. The harvested seeds
entering the storage facilities from the field may also have microflora and insects, which can
introduce respiratory activity and raise moisture content of the seeds. Consequently, molds
carried over with the seeds from the field to the storage facilities may have continued to grow
and accumulate aflatoxin in the seeds prior to processing. Although Morogoro is characterized
by high temperature and relative humidity (S1A Fig and S1C Fig), the adequate rainfall (S1B
Fig) it received in 2014 could have alleviated the severity of fungal contamination and aflatoxin
levels. If Morogoro had received less rainfall in 2014, perhaps the extent of aflatoxin contami-
nation would have been similar to that of Dodoma since these regions are contiguous. This

 assumption was true for Morogoro findings of 2015 (Tables 4 and 5) because this location
overall received less rainfall in 2015 than 2014.
The preliminary findings in 2014 prompted us to carry out another survey in 2015 to inves-
tigate the recurrence of aflatoxin contamination in sunflower seeds and cakes in the same loca-
tions where samples were collected in 2014 (Tables 4 and 5). Overall, there was significantly
(P<0.05) more aflatoxin contamination of sunflower cakes in 2015 than in 2014, but there
were no significant differences in the overall incidence rates of aflatoxin contamination in sun-
flower seeds between the two years. However, there were significant differences in aflatoxin
incidence rates in seeds and cakes between locations in each year. These differences between
locations exist because climatic conditions and post-harvest practices vary from location to
location. In addition, sanitation and ventilation conditions of the storage facilities vary from
one processing oil mill to another within one location, and from one location to another.
When we compare the aflatoxin incidence rates in seeds and cakes collected from various
locations in 2015 to those collected from the same locations in 2014 (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5), we
observe that the mean estimates of aflatoxin concentration for locations of Singida, Dodoma,
Morogoro and Mbeya appear repetitively and significantly higher than the rest of the locations
in both years. However, there is considerable inconsistency which may have been caused by
variability in sanitation practices among processing plants within a location and among loca-
tions in the two years. The small number of samples is probably another contributing factor
for such inconsistency. Also, it is possible that these high mean estimates of aflatoxin concen-
trations above 20 ng/g, in large part could be attributed to drought caused by semi-arid climate
in Singida, and Dodoma, and high temperatures and humidity in Morogoro [24, 29, 30, 31].
This attribution cannot hold true for Mbeya because this location has moderate temperature,
humidity and fairly adequate rainfall. Perhaps other risk factors such as poor post-harvest stor-
age of the seeds and cakes could account for its higher mean estimates across the two years.
Storage duration could be another important factor that might account for higher aflatoxin
contamination in cakes in year 2015 than 2014. While the samples collected in year 2014 had
stayed in storage for 3 months (May–July 2014) prior to sample collection, a subset of samples
collected in 2015 had been in storage for 5 months (May–September 2015), which suggests
that the longer the storage period of seeds or cakes, the higher incidence rates of aflatoxin con-
tamination becomes. This factor is likely enhanced by poor storage facilities and conditions.
The current problem of climate change may increase the risk of aflatoxin contamination in
susceptible crops in the near future [24, 27, 28, 32]. A. flavus and A. parasiticus distribution is
predicted to increase with global warming [33]. Drought, high humidity and high temperature
cause stress to plants and reduce production of phytoalexins, the chemicals used by plants to
resist fungal infection [34]. When such conditions prolong, crop plants in the field weaken
and are rendered susceptible to fungal infection [24, 35]. It has been reported that Dodoma
and a large part of Central Tanzania is often characterized by drought due to inadequate,
unpredictable rainfall and increase in temperature [31]. The semi-arid climatic conditions in
Central Tanzania (Dodoma, and Singida) might have contributed to the observed high levels
in such locations because these conditions are conducive to aflatoxigenic molds to thrive.
Deforestation, wild fires and charcoal production on Uluguru mountains in Morogoro have
resulted in gradual micro-climate change manifested by lower precipitation and higher tem-
peratures [36]. This may likely expand the ecological environment of aflatoxigenic molds in
Morogoro as well.
Like seeds, cakes are vulnerable to aflatoxin contamination. In the two surveys, 80% of 92
sunflower cake samples were contaminated with aflatoxin ranging from 1.4 to 598.4 ng/g,
compared to only 59% of 90 sunflower seed samples contaminated with aflatoxin ranging
from 1.4 to 662.7 ng/g illustrating that generally more cake samples were contaminated than

 seeds. This may be because aflatoxin contamination is concentrated in a small number of seeds,
which may have not been sampled; but when the highly-contaminated seeds are ground into
cakes, aflatoxin becomes detectable. This could be considered as a “concentration effect” of seed
pressing. For example, aflatoxin could not be detected in sunflower seed samples from Iringa in
2014, but was detected in its sunflower cake samples (mean = 2.9 ng/g and range = 1.7–5.3 ng/g)
although in low levels (Tables 2 and 3). Additionally, since the cakes and seeds are stored in the
same storage warehouse, there is likely cross-contamination of spores from the seeds and the
floor of storage facility to the cakes, which may be stored longer than the seeds.
These surveys were not without a challenge. It was hard to obtain samples from sacks situ-
ated deep in the interior of sack piles in the stores [37]. We obtained samples only from the
sacks peripherally located in each store. The small sample size per region was also a limitation.
Larger sample numbers would provide more accurate information on the incidence and extent
of aflatoxin contamination, and provide a better measure of variability in aflatoxin levels from
one region to another. We therefore recommend that future survey studies should address
these limitations. However, despite these limitations, the results still indicated significant inci-
dence rates of aflatoxin contamination in sunflower seeds and cakes particularly from loca-
tions of central Tanzania.
The results for seven locations of Tanzania (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5) corroborate reports from
Sudan [6], Pakistan [19], Spain [20], Iran [21], and India [38, 39], which indicated that sun-
flower seeds and cakes were susceptible to aflatoxin contamination. The high aflatoxin levels
in samples obtained from Dodoma, Morogoro, Babati and Singida towns may have resulted
from a combination of drought and sub-optimal postharvest handling and storage of seeds
and cakes [24, 31, 36]. Anecdotal information from the sunflower oil processors (buyers of the
sunflower seeds) revealed that unscrupulous sellers might adulterate sound seeds with moldy
seeds to increase the weight of the packed sunflower seed bags for economic profit. Unfortu-
nately, smaller quantities of moldy seeds in the midst of sound seeds may serve as reservoirs
for increasing aflatoxin contamination in storage.
Climatically, the eastern and central provinces of Kenya and the central regions of Tanzania
may have similar semi-arid conditions, which are favorable for the S-strain of A. flavus impli-
cated with the eastern and central Kenya aflatoxicosis outbreak in 2004 [40, 41]. This wild
strain is known for its ability to produce high quantities of aflatoxins and it is more prevalent
in such stressed environments [40, 41]. However, prevalence of this fungal strain in central
Tanzania is not known and it is a potential gap for future study.
To summarize: In our study, 59% of 90 sunflower seed samples and 80% of 92 cake samples
collected from sunflower oil processors across Tanzania were contaminated with total aflatox-
ins. Moreover, 14% of seed samples and 17% of cake samples were contaminated with total afla-
toxin concentrations above the action level of 20 ng/g, with several samples having in the
several hundred ng/g of aflatoxin. These high aflatoxin levels in a commodity frequently con-
sumed by the Tanzanian population indicate that local authorities must implement interven-
tions to prevent and control aflatoxin contamination along the sunflower commodity value
chain, to enhance food and feed safety in Tanzania. Follow-up research is needed to determine
intake rates of sunflower seed products in humans and animals, to inform exposure assessments
and to better understand the role of sunflower seeds and cakes as a dietary aflatoxin source.
