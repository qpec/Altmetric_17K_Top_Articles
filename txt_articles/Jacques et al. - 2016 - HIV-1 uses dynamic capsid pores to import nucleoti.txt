Abstract
During the early stages of infection, the HIV-1 capsid protects viral components from cytosolic 
sensors, such as cGAS, and nucleases, such as TREX, while allowing access to nucleotides for 
efficient reverse transcription1. Here we show that each capsid hexamer has a size-selective pore 
bounded by a ring of six arginine residues and a ‘molecular iris’ formed by the N-terminal β-
hairpin. The arginine ring creates a strongly positively charged channel that recruits the four 
nucleotides with on-rates that near diffusion limits. Progressive removal of pore arginines results 
in a dose-dependent and concomitant decrease in nucleotide affinity, reverse transcription and 
infectivity. This positively charged channel is universally conserved in lentiviral capsids despite 
the fact that it is strongly destabilising without nucleotides to counteract charge repulsion. We also 
describe a channel inhibitor, hexacarboxybenzene, which competes for nucleotide binding and 
efficiently blocks encapsidated reverse transcription demonstrating the tractability of the pore as a 
novel drug target.
There is increasing evidence that the HIV-1 capsid remains intact as it traverses the 
cytoplasm of a newly-infected cell. Prematurely-uncoated viruses trigger innate immune 
sensing2, assembled capsid proteins are required to properly engage the nuclear pore 
complex3, and intact capsids have been observed at the nuclear envelope4. Reverse 
transcription has been postulated to occur within the HIV-1 virion during cytoplasmic

 transit, yet structural analyses of the HIV-1 capsid have not defined a pore through which 
small molecules such as dNTP’s might pass. One possible location for a pore would be the 
6-fold axis at the centre of each capsid protein (CA) hexamer, but this is not evident from 
existing hexamer structures as it is obscured by the N-terminal β-hairpin. By comparing all 
the available CA crystal structures with resolved β-hairpins5–11, including monomeric 
crystal forms, we observed that the β-hairpin can adopt alternate conformations that differ 
by up to 15 Å (as measured by the displacement of Q7) (Fig. 1a). When reconstructed in the 
context of a hexamer, several of these β-hairpin conformations result in a pore about the six-
fold axis (Fig. 1b). The different β-hairpin conformations are the result of a pivoting 
movement of up to 37.5° about the N-terminal proline, an essential capsid residue that forms 
a salt-bridge with D5112 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Video 1). In structures where the pore 
would be open, D51 also participates in a second salt-bridge interaction with H12. 
Conversely, in structures where the pore would be closed, including all previously solved 
disulfide-stabilised hexamers (CAHexamer), a water molecule has displaced the H12 side-
chain and coordinates a tetrahedral hydrogen-bond network between H12, T48, Q50 and 
D51. We hypothesized that the protonation state of H12 may be crucial in determining 
which arrangement is favored and therefore that the conformation of the β-hairpin in 
published structures will have been influenced by the pH at which they were solved. 
Remarkably, when the relative displacement of the β-hairpin (Q7 Cα) is plotted against 
crystallization pH the structures resolve into two groups; at pH < 7 an open pore β-hairpin 
conformation is observed whereas at pH > 7 a closed pore conformation is favored (Fig. 1c, 
Extended Data Table 1). The same correlation is observed when the distance between D51 
and H12 is plotted against pH (Fig. 1d,e), confirming the importance of H12 in determining 
β-hairpin conformation. Structures solved at pH 7 display the greatest β-hairpin variability, 
consistent with maximum pore flexibility occurring under physiological conditions. The 
likely reason why a pore has not been detected in published CAHexamer structures is because 
they were solved at a basic pH where H12 is deprotonated and a closed pore is favored. To 
test this hypothesis and demonstrate that the pore can open in the context of an assembled 
hexamer, we sought to crystallise CAHexamer under acidic conditions. We obtained a 
previously unreported crystal form at pH 5.5, the structure of which contains a β-hairpin in 
the open conformation and an exposed pore (Fig. 1b, far right).
Using all available CA structures to define a range of movement for the β-hairpin, we 
observed that the pivoting about P1 results in an iris-like motion, which creates an aperture 
on the outer surface of the capsid (Fig. 2a). In the open state, a chamber 25 Å deep and 3240 
Å3 in volume is revealed, which culminates in a ring of six arginine side-chains from residue 
18 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Video 2). This cluster of basic residues in close proximity results 
in highly electropositive foci at the centre of each hexamer. The R18 residues adopt multiple 
conformations (Extended Data Fig. 1a) to give a maximum pore diameter of 8 Å, sufficient 
to allow transit of a dNTP molecule. We therefore reasoned that this feature might provide 
an efficient means to recruit dNTP’s into the capsid interior whilst excluding larger 
molecules. We therefore tested whether CAHexamer can interact with dNTP’s by fluorescence 
anisotropy and found that all four nucleotides bind with remarkably high affinity of between 
6-40 nM (Fig. 2c). All biophysical measurements were undertaken in an ‘intracellular 
buffer’ (see Methods) that is designed to match salt concentrations in the cell. We also

 observed that physiological concentrations of inorganic phosphate had little effect on dNTP 
binding and that the pore could not distinguish between dNTP’s and rNTP’s (Extended Data 
Fig. 2) consistent with the observation that rNMP’s are often incorporated into newly-
synthesised viral DNA13. Analyzing the kinetics of interaction by stopped-flow revealed 
that binding is driven by an extremely rapid on-rate of > 2x108 M-1 s-1, although this is 
likely an underestimate as the reaction becomes immeasurably fast at increasing reactant 
concentrations (Fig. 2d&e). Separate dissociation experiments in which fluorescent dCTP 
was displaced with excess unlabeled dCTP determined that the off-rate is also fast at >12 s-1 
(Fig. 2f), equivalent to a half life of 58 ms. Calculation of on-rates for all four nucleotides 
based on their steady-state affinities and off-rates confirms that HIV-1 hexamers achieve 
association rates between 108-109 M-1 s-1. These are unusually rapid association kinetics, 
typically found in enzymes that have achieved so-called kinetic perfection. Such ultra-rapid 
enzymes are rare because of the strong fitness advantage needed for their selection over 
merely very fast equivalents14. The rapid on-rate of dNTP recruitment that HIV achieves 
may be the result of an electrostatically assisted association binding mechanism, as has been 
described for barnase/barstar15. Importantly, the combination of fast on and off rates 
suggests that while the HIV-1 capsid may recruit dNTP’s extremely efficiently, these 
nucleotides quickly dissociate to become available as substrates for reverse transcription.
To test our hypothesis that it is the ring of arginine residues that is responsible for nucleotide 
recruitment, we solved the structure of HIV-1 CAHexamer in complex with dATP and found 
that it binds as predicted in the center of the arginine ring via its phosphate groups (Fig. 2g). 
While there is electron density for the phosphates, the position of the base can only be 
modeled, likely because hexamer rotational symmetry allows the dATP base to occupy six 
equivalent positions, averaging its density over a large volume (Extended Data Fig. 1). 
Comparison with a structure solved under identical conditions, but in the absence of dATP, 
confirms that the observed density corresponds to the nucleotide. To further investigate the 
importance of R18 in the recruitment of dNTP’s, we produced R18G and R18A CAHexamer 
mutants. Neither R18G nor R18A affected the overall structure of the protein and neither 
displayed measurable nucleotide binding (Fig. 3a&b). To determine whether formation of 
the arginines into a ring is required, we performed binding experiments on wild-type protein 
in the presence of DTT, which reduces the disulphide bonds that stabilise the hexameric 
construct, resulting in monomeric CA. No binding was observed to monomeric CA 
demonstrating that once the pore is disassembled, the capsid can no longer recruit dNTP’s 
(Fig. 3b).
The concentration of positive charge provided by the R18 ring is an unusual feature and 
might be expected to exert a destabilizing influence on the capsid lattice. Conversely, it has 
been calculated that arginine pairs can stabilize protein interfaces16, while arginine clusters 
have been postulated to have a stabilizing effect17. We performed differential scanning 
fluorimetry (DSF) to compare the relative stability of CAHexamer with and without the 
electropositive pore. We observed a remarkable stability of the R18G hexamer relative to 
wild-type complex, corresponding to a surprisingly large increase in Tm of 4 °C (Fig. 3c, 
Extended Data Fig. 3). A similar increase in stability was observed in wild-type hexamer in 
the presence of dNTP’s, while no stabilization was observed when dNTP’s were added to 
R18G hexamer (Fig. 3d). Taken together, these results suggest that the pore is indeed a

 destabilising feature that is tolerated by the capsid lattice in order to facilitate nucleotide 
binding. An alignment of capsid sequences predicts an electropositive pore to be conserved 
across retrovirus genera, with the exception of the gammaretroviruses (Extended Data Fig. 
4). While there appears to be no R18-equivalent in gammaretroviruses, analysis of the 
published MLV capsid structure reveals a large channel running down the six-fold axis with 
an inward facing Arg residue at position 3 (Mortuza et al. 2008). This residue may have a 
role in attracting dNTP’s, but it is unlikely that the MLV capsid has the same size-selectivity 
as the HIV capsid as the pore is much wider.
The observation that HIV-1 has evolved the fastest possible rate constant for nucleotide 
recruitment suggests that dNTP import may be a limiting factor in reverse transcription and 
infectivity. To determine how the efficiency of nucleotide recruitment impacts on these 
measures of viral fitness, we constructed a matched set of chimeric WT:R18G CAHexamer 
and viruses (see Extended Data Fig. 5 for chimera controls). R18G was chosen as its capsid 
morphology has previously been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from WT19. 
Furthermore, R18G was able to saturate the activity of capsid-binding restriction factor 
TRIM5α, confirming that assembled capsids enter the cytoplasm20 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). 
We tested our chimeric hexamers for dNTP binding and found that an incorporation ratio of 
5:1 (5 arginines to 1 glycine) had a minimal impact on affinity (Fig. 3e). However, as the 
proportion of glycine residues was increased, there was a dose-dependent decrease in dNTP 
binding. Testing HIV-1 GFP VSV-G pseudotyped chimeric viruses for infectivity revealed a 
similar pattern of R18 dependence, in which there was little change in infectivity at a ratio of 
5:1 but a dominant negative effect at higher G18 ratios (Fig. 3f). Assuming a binomial 
distribution of arginines and glycines in viral hexamers, the data fit a model in which 
removal of two or more arginines from the pore is detrimental to the virus (Extended Data 
Fig. 6b,c), which is consistent with the observation that removal of one arginine has little 
impact on dNTP affinity. Importantly, there is close correlation between chimera infectivity 
and nucleotide affinity, consistent with the recruitment of dNTP’s impacting directly on viral 
infection (Fig. 3g). Such a mechanism would be expected to influence infection at the level 
of reverse transcription and indeed a similarly close correlation is observed between chimera 
affinity and the production of early reverse transcripts (Fig 3h).
We propose that reverse transcription takes place within the protected environment of the 
capsid by recruiting nucleotides through a strongly electropositive pore at the center of each 
capsid hexamer. In order to explore this further we performed endogenous reverse 
transcription (ERT) assays in which HIV-1 capsid cores were purified from virions21 and 
their reverse transcriptase activity quantified in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 7). Efficient 
strong-stop reverse transcription (the first DNA synthesis step) was observed upon 
incubation of cores with dNTP’s. Moreover, addition of DNase I, RNase A or the 
promiscuous nuclease Benzonase failed to prevent encapsidated reverse transcription (Fig. 
4a, Extended Data Fig. 7e). This demonstrates that dNTP’s can access the interior of the 
capsid but larger nucleases cannot, supporting the notion of a size selective pore. 
Processivity beyond strong-stop was observed but at lower efficiency, in agreement with 
published data22.

 If the R18 pore is responsible for dNTP import, it is conceivable that capsid mutations that 
affect the movement of the β-hairpin may also affect the efficiency of reverse transcription. 
Of the residues primarily responsible for the hairpin movement (Fig 1a), P1 and D51 are 
invariant, with mutations at these positions resulting in non-infectious particles due to 
defective capsid assembly12. His12 is also highly conserved, however, in ~2% of sequences 
it has been replaced by a tyrosine. As tyrosine is not titratable over physiological pH’s, we 
hypothesised that the H12Y mutation would result in the β-hairpin favouring one 
conformation. Solving the crystal structure of this mutant revealed that under the high-pH 
condition, Y12 displaces the bound water molecule and makes a hydrogen-bond contact 
with Asp51 (Fig. 4b). Despite contacting D51 directly, the larger sidechain of Y12 relative to 
H12 causes the β-hairpin to favour the closed conformation (Fig. 4c). Importantly H12Y 
does not completely shut the pore because residues 4-9 do not occupy a single defined state 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). The β-hairpin therefore retains a degree of flexibility despite 
rigidification about the P1-D51 ‘hinge’. Nevertheless we predicted that favouring the closed 
conformation should result in H12Y having reduced RT kinetics while retaining some 
infectivity and this is what we observe (Fig. 4d).
To provide further evidence that nucleotides are being recruited through the R18 pore to 
allow ERT, we sought a small molecule inhibitor that would block the pore. Small 
polyanionic compounds have been used previously to block analogous arginine-rich 
pores23. We found that the hexacarboxybenzene series (which are polyanionic at 
physiological pH) bound to CAHexamer and competed for nucleotide binding as measured by 
fluorescence anisotropy and DSF, respectively (Fig. 4e&f, Extended Data Fig. 3). Activity 
broadly increased with the number of negative charges present within the compound, with 
hexa- or pentacarboxybenzene being the most effective. DSF indicated that the compounds 
did not bind in the absence of R18 or when hexamers were reduced by DTT, and the crystal 
structure of the hexacarboxybenzene-bound CAHexamer confirmed that the compound was 
co-ordinated by R18 within the central pore (Fig. 4f&g). At sufficiently high concentration, 
tetra-, penta- and hexacarboxybenzene fully inhibit reverse transcriptase, presumably by 
competing with dNTP’s (Extended Data Fig. 7f). However, in ERT assays, when reverse 
transcriptase is enclosed within an intact viral capsid, tetracarboxybenzene has no effect on 
reverse transcription, with only a small effect observed for pentacarboxybenzene (Fig. 4h). 
In contrast, hexacarboxybenzene inhibited ERT almost completely. The failure of 
tetracarboxybenzene to inhibit ERT demonstrates that a compound sufficiently small to pass 
through the channel is still efficiently excluded from the capsid interior if it cannot bind the 
pore. This result emphasises the chemical selectivity of the pore and its role in dNTP import 
during reverse transcription.
As a semi-permeable reaction chamber, the HIV-1 capsid is reminiscent of bacterial 
microcompartments – primitive ‘organelles’ that utilize a protein coat to isolate toxic 
reaction intermediates from the cytoplasm24. Microcompartments import substrates through 
a size-selective pore to be consumed by enzymes located inside a chamber25. Similarly, 
dNTP’s translocated inside the HIV capsid will be hydrolysed by encapsidated reverse 
transcriptase. Coupling import with hydrolysis may create a local chemical gradient, 
promoting interior movement despite the release of captured dNTP’s on either side of the 
pore. Appositely, a subset of microcompartments, carboxysomes, contain positively charged

 amino acids that are thought to selectively transport bicarbonate and ribulose-1,5-
bisphosphate over uncharged CO2 and O226. Some microcompartment structures have gated 
channels located at the six-fold axes in their protein lattice, to control substrate entry and 
product release. The fact that a similar ‘gate’ potentially exists in the HIV-1 capsid, provided 
by the ‘molecular iris’ of the β-hairpin, suggests that the virus could use this as a mechanism 
to regulate reverse transcription. In addition, the regulation of capsid stability through dNTP 
recruitment, and possibly DNA synthesis, provides a model whereby HIV-1 may co-regulate 
DNA synthesis and uncoating to facilitate cytoplasmic DNA synthesis that remains invisible 
to cytoplasmic DNA sensing. Finally, the high degree of conservation of R18 coupled with 
the fact that the pore can be obstructed chemically identifies the pore as a novel target for 
drug development.
Methods
Protein production and purification
The CA N-terminal domain and the disulfide-stabilised CAHexamer were expressed and 
purified as previously described8,27. The R18G mutation was introduced by QuikChange 
site-directed mutagenesis. Chimeric CAHexamers were produced by mixing the desired ratio 
of pre-assembled WT and R18G CAHexamer (16 mg/ml) followed by a four-step dialysis: i) 
Disassembly in TRIS (pH 8.0, 50mM), NaCl (40 mM), β-mercaptoethanol (20 mM); ii) 
Reassembly in TRIS (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (1 M), β-mercaptoethanol (20 mM); iii) 
Oxidation in TRIS (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (1 M); Redispersion in TRIS (pH 8.0, 20 mM), 
NaCl (40 mM). In the context of the chimera experiments, WT and R18G were also 
subjected to this process so that samples were matched with the other ratios. Reassembled 
hexamers were observed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Chimeric hexamers were compared 
with mixes of homohexamers by fluorescence anisotropy (see below and Extended Data Fig. 
5) in order to demonstrate that chimeras had indeed formed.
Crystallisation, structure solution and analysis
All crystals were grown at 17 °C by sitting-drop vapour diffusion in which 100 nL protein 
was mixed with 100 nL precipitant and suspended above 80 uL precipitant. The CA N-
terminal domain (15 mg/ml) ‘open’ conformation was crystallised from PEG3350 (20%), 
Ammonium chloride (0.2 M, pH 6.3). Crystals were cryoprotected in precipitant 
supplemented with 25% glycerol. The CAHexamer (15 mg/ml) ‘open conformation’ was 
crystallised from PEG4000 (12%), NaCl (0.1 M), MgCl2 (0.1 M), sodium citrate (0.1 M, pH 
5.5). Crystals were cryoprotected in precipitant supplemented with 20% MPD. The 
remaining CAHexamer structures (apo, dATP-bound, R18G and hexacarboxybenzene-bound) 
were all obtained from 10-12 mg/ml protein mixed with PEG550MME (13-14%), KSCN 
(0.15 M), TRIS (0.1 M, pH 8.5) and cryoprotected with precipitant supplemented with 20% 
MPD. For the dATP-bound structure, the protein was supplemented with 10 mM dATP 
immediately prior to crystallisation; while for the hexacarboxybenzene structure, the protein 
was likewise supplemented with 1 mM hexacarboxybenzene (TRIS-buffered to pH 8.0). All 
crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and data collected either in-house using Cu Kα 
X rays produced by a Rigaku FR-E rotating anode generator with diffraction recorded on a 
mar345 image plate detector (marXperts), or at beamline I02 at Diamond Light Source. The

 datasets were processed using the CCP4 program suite28. Data were indexed and integrated 
with IMOSFLM29 and scaled and merged with either POINTLESS and SCALA30 or 
AIMLESS31. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER32 and 
refined using REFMAC533. Between rounds of refinement, the model was manually 
checked and corrected against the corresponding electron-density maps in COOT34. Solvent 
molecules and bound ligands were added as the refinement progressed either manually or 
automatically within COOT and were routinely checked for correct stereo-chemistry, for 
sufficient supporting density above a 2Fo-Fc threshold of 1.0σ and for a reasonable thermal 
factor. The quality of the model was regularly checked for steric clashes, incorrect 
stereochemistry and rotamer outliers using MOLPROBITY35. Final figures were rendered 
in The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC. Surface 
electrostatics were calculated using the APBS PyMOL plugin36 and cavity volume 
measurements with 3V37. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in 
Extended Data Table 2. The ‘fullerene cone’ model of an HIV-1 virion is based on 3J3Q38 
but using the inter-hexamer packing from 4XFY39 and an open β-hairpin conformation.
Fluorescence Anisotropy
Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed at 22 °C on a Cary Eclipse 
Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent). Fluorescein-labelled dNTP’s were obtained from 
Perkin Elmer and used for saturation binding experiments at a concentration of 2 nM 
prepared in ‘Intracellular Buffer’: potassium gluconate (110 mM), KCl (25 mM), NaCl (5 
mM), MgCl2 (2 mM), HEPES (10 mM), final pH 7.2. CAHexamer disassembly was achieved 
by the addition of DTT (4 mM), and was performed routinely at the conclusion of each 
saturation binding experiment to confirm the absence of non-specific binding. It was found 
that the triphosphate was not stable over the timescale of the competition binding 
experiments; so fluorescein-labelled dNTP’s were substituted for a non-hydrolysable 
BODIPY-labelled GTP-γ-S (ThermoFisher Scientific). Saturation binding experiments 
determined that this non-hydrolysable analogue bound with unchanged affinity to the 
CAHexamer (Kd = 14 nM). 200 mM stock solutions of hexacarboxybenzene (Sigma), 
pentacarboxybenzene (MP Biomedicals), 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxybezene (Sigma), and 1,3,5-
tricarboxybenzene (Fluka) were prepared in 50mM TRIS and adjusted to pH 8.0. For 
competition binding experiments, the competitor was titrated into a mix of CAHexamer (28 
nM) and BODIPY-GTP-γ-S (2 nM). All fluorescence anisotropy measurements are 
representative of at least two experiments. Each point is measured in quadruplicate and 
plotted as mean ± standard deviation. In many cases error bars lie within the datapoint. 
Saturation binding and competition binding curves were fit using GraphPad Prism 
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Rapid reaction kinetics
Experiments were carried out using a dual-channel fluorescence TgK single-mix SF-61SX2 
stopped-flow spectrometer. All samples were prepared in Intracellular Buffer. Mixing was 
performed 1:1, using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a 520 nm cutoff filter. 
Association experiments were carried out at 0.25 µM dCTP and a range of µM CAHexamer 
concentrations. Dissociation experiments were carried out using 20 µM unlabeled dCTP and 
a pre-formed fluorescein-labeled 1 µM dCTP: CAHexamer complex. Relaxation rates were

 determined using a single exponential model: F = ΔF exp(-kobst) + Fe, where F is the 
observed fluorescence, ΔF is the fluorescence amplitude, kobs is the observed pseudo first-
order rate constant, and Fe is the end-point fluorescence. The bimolecular association rate 
constant (kon) was determined by fitting the linear relationship between kobs and the 
increasing pseudo-first order concentrations of CAHexamer to: kobs = kon[CAHexamer] + 
kreverse. For stopped flow experiments, every 0.5 s measurement included >2000 datapoints, 
each of which was oversampled 99 times. At least three independent mixing experiments 
were averaged for each ligand concentration.
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
DSF measurements were performed using a Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies) 
over a temperature range of 20-95 °C using a ramp rate of 2.5 °C/min. CAHexamer samples 
were prepared at a final concentration of 1mg/ml in Intracellular Buffer (+/- DTT (4 mM)). 
dNTP’s or competitors were added at 200 μM. DSF scans are single reads. Consistency 
between like points yields an uncertainty in Tm of no greater than 0.2 °C.
Cells and Viruses
All cell lines were obtained from ATCC and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. 
Replication deficient VSV-G pseudotyped HIV GFP vectors were produced in HEK293T 
cells as described previously3. Site-directed mutagenesis of CA was performed using the 
QuikChange method (Stratagene) against the Gag-Pol expression plasmid, pCRV-1. 
Chimeric viruses were produced by mixing the appropriate ratio of WT or mutant pCRV-1 
prior to transfection. Reverse transcriptase activity was quantified using a colorimetric 
ELISA assay (Roche) and was found not to vary significantly between viruses. Production 
of mature particles was confirmed by western blot for p24 from pelleted virus, with no 
observable difference between chimeras. Primary antibody used for western blotting was a 
polyclonal goat anti-p24 (Bio-Rad, product 4999-9007).
Infection Experiments
Infections of HeLa cells were performed in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene. GFP 
expressing cells were enumerated on a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) 2 days 
post-transfection after fixation of cells in 4% paraformaldehyde. Chimera infectivity was 
determined by a 6-point titration of each chimera onto HeLa cells. Values are the mean ± 
standard deviation calculated from all points for which the proportion of infected cells after 
48 h was between 1% and 50%.
TRIM5α Abrogation Assay
‘Abrogating virus’ (VSV-G pseudotyped HIV Puromycin vectors) was produced as 
described above, with the exception that the gfp gene was replaced with the pac gene to 
ensure the virus did not confer fluorescence upon infection. Virus was concentrated by 
ultracentrifugation with an SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2 h. The abrogating virus capsids 
were WT, R18G or W184A/M185A (a mutant with a known assembly defect that cannot 
compete for TRIM5α). VSV-G pseudotyped HIV GFP vectors were titrated on FRhK-4 cells 
in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene to determine the volume of virus required to achieve

 1% infection. In a separate experiment, cells were then coinfected with that amount HIV-
GFP vector and a titration of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV Puromycin vectors (the abrogating 
virus). GFP expressing cells were measured in duplicate and enumerated as above. Results 
are representative of three experiments and are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For 
many points the error bars lie within the datapoint.
Quantitative PCR
For analysis of reverse transcription products, viral supernatant was treated with 250 U/ml 
DNase (Millipore) for 1 h prior to infection. Cells were harvested 6h post infection. DNA 
was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). GFP copies were quantified 
using primers GFPF (CAACAGCCACAACGTCTATATCAT), GFPR 
(ATGTTGTGGCGGATCTTGAAG) and probe GFPP (FAM-
CCGACAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAA-TAMRA) against a standard curve of CSGW on 
an ABI StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Chimera reverse

Preparation of HIV-1 cores
HIV-1 capsid cores were prepared using a protocol based on21 with modifications. 90ml 
HEK293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 GFP was pelleted over 20% 
sucrose dissolved in core prep buffer (CPB; 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
MgCl2) in an SW28 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C. Pellets were gently resuspended 
at 4 °C in CPB for 1 h with occasional agitation. Resuspended pellets were treated with 
DNase I from bovine pancreas (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h at 200 μg/ml at room temperature to 
remove contaminating extra-viral DNA. Virus was subjected to spin-through detergent 
stripping of the viral membrane as follows. A gradient at 80-30% sucrose was prepared in 
SW40Ti ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid with 250 μl 1% Triton X-100 in 15% sucrose, 
followed by 250 μl 7.5% sucrose. All solutions were prepared in CPB. 750 μl DNase-treated, 
concentrated virus was layered on top of the gradient and subjected to 32,500 rpm at 4 °C 
for 16 h. The preparation was fractionated and the location of cores was determined by 
ELISA for p24 (Perkin Elmer). Core-containing fractions were pooled and snap frozen 
before storage at -80 °C.
Endogenous reverse transcription assays
Viral cores were diluted to 400 μg/ml p24 with 60% sucrose in CPB and pre-treated with 
nucleases for 1h before addition of dNTPs. Final concentrations of dNTP’s were 100 μM 
each, DNase I and RNase A were at 100 μg/ml and Benzonase was at 250 U/ml. 20 μl 
reactions were incubated at room temperature for 16 h unless indicated otherwise and were 
stopped by shifting to -80 °C. DNA was prepared using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit 
(Qiagen) after addition of 200 μl PBS with of 50 μg/ml salmon sperm carrier DNA to each 
sample. Reverse transcript products were detected using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Mix 
(ABI) and RU5 primers to detect strong stop DNA40 (RU5 fwd

TACTCACCAGTCGCCGCC and 2ST probe FAM-TCGACGCAGGACTCGGCTTGCT-

with NaOH and added to reactions at a final concentration of 20mM. In order for dNTP 
concentration to be limiting, these reactions were performed in the presence of 1 μM each 
dNTP and reactions were stopped 5 h after their addition. ERT experiments were performed 
in experimental triplicate and are representative of several experimental replicates. Data are 
represented as mean ± sem

 851 nM, demonstrating that inorganic phosphate can compete for the pore. However, given 
that the intracellular [dNTP] is approximately 100 μM, under intracellular conditions dNTP 
binding would dominate. b, Titration of CAHexamer into BODIPY-labelled rGTP-γ-S and 
fluorescein-labelled dTTP. Each binds with the same affinity suggesting that the R18 pore is 
unable to discriminate between ribose and deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates. The 
difference in the magnitude of the fluorescence anisotropy signals is due to differences in 
fluorophore excited state lifetimes. KD values are indicated by a dotted line.

of 1:5 homohexamer mix and the equivalent chimera. The 1:5 WT:R18G mix experiences a 
six-fold loss of apparent Kd, as expected for a 6-fold dilution of WT with a non-binding 
mutant. In contrast, the 1:5 chimera chimera has a 58-fold decrease in Kd, demonstrating 
that chimeric hexamers had indeed formed.

 Extended Data Figure 6. Effects of HIV-1 CA R18G on viral infectivity.
a, R18G is capable of abrogating TRIM5α-mediated restriction. Rhesus TRIM5α provides a 
potent block to infection of HIV in FRhK-4 cells. Titration of a non-GFP-expressing virus 
can compete for TRIM5α-binding and relieve the restriction of a GFP-expressing virus only 
if it delivers an assembled capsid into the cytoplasm. R18G abrogates restriction but 
W184A/M185A, which is incapable of forming assembled capsids due to loss of the CTD-
CTD dimerization interface, does not. b, Binomial distribution model for the relative 
proportion of capsid hexamers carrying a discrete number of glycines at position 18 at

replacing arginine 18 with glycines. Each model assumes a different number of glycines is 
required to render the pore defective. The data from WT:R18G chimeric virus measurements 
(solid line) is consistent with a model in which four or more arginines (i.e. 2 or fewer 
glycines, green) are required to maintain a functional pore.

 Figure 1. HIV-1 capsid hexamers have a pore at the 6-fold symmetry axis.
a, Superposition of N-terminal domains from solved capsid structures. A detailed view of 
the boxed region shows that the β-hairpin toggles between closed (green) and open (pink) 
states as a result of the hydrogen-bond network about P1, H12, and D51. b, β-hairpin 
(coloured) conformations dictate the presence of a pore at the 6-fold axis. Hexamers of CA 
N-terminal domain (CA-NTD) structures have been assembled using symmetry operators 
from CAHexamer structures. c,d Displacement of Q7 or H12-D51 distance as a function of 
crystallization pH. e, Correlation of Q7 displacement with H12-D51 distance.

 Figure 2. The HIV-1 capsid pore is strongly electropositive and recruits dNTP’s with rapid 
association and dissociation kinetics.
a, Model of an HIV-1 virion with hexamers in an open conformation reveals that the capsid 
is porous. Surface electrostatic potential shows that the pores are highly electropositive. b, 
Cross sections through the closed (β-hairpin green) and open (β-hairpin pink) CAHexamer 
showing a central chamber that is accessible in the open state. R18 (cyan) creates a 
bottleneck at the base of the chamber underneath the β-hairpin. c, Fluorescence anisotropy 
measurements of dNTP’s binding to CAHexamer. d, Example of pre-steady state association
