BACKGROUND
The preferred timing of umbilical-cord clamping in preterm infants is unclear.
METHODS
We randomly assigned fetuses from women who were expected to deliver before 
30 weeks of gestation to either immediate clamping of the umbilical cord (≤10 sec-
onds after delivery) or delayed clamping (≥60 seconds after delivery). The primary 
composite outcome was death or major morbidity (defined as severe brain injury 
on postnatal ultrasonography, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing entero-
colitis, or late-onset sepsis) by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Analyses were per-
formed on an intention-to-treat basis, accounting for multiple births.
RESULTS
Of 1634 fetuses that underwent randomization, 1566 were born alive before 30 
weeks of gestation; of these, 782 were assigned to immediate cord clamping and 
784 to delayed cord clamping. The median time between delivery and cord clamp-
ing was 5 seconds and 60 seconds in the respective groups. Complete data on the 
primary outcome were available for 1497 infants (95.6%). There was no significant 
difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between infants assigned to 
delayed clamping (37.0%) and those assigned to immediate clamping (37.2%) (relative 
risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.13; P 
= 
0.96). The mortality was 6.4% 
in the delayed-clamping group and 9.0% in the immediate-clamping group 
(P 
= 
0.03 in unadjusted analyses; P 
= 
0.39 after post hoc adjustment for multiple 
secondary outcomes). There were no significant differences between the two groups 
in the incidences of chronic lung disease or other major morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS
Among preterm infants, delayed cord clamping did not result in a lower incidence 
of the combined outcome of death or major morbidity at 36 weeks of gestation than 
immediate cord clamping. (Funded by the Australian National Health and Medical

elaying the time of umbilical-
cord clamping costs nothing and may 
benefit preterm infants by increasing the 
amount of placental blood received1 or the time 
for the physiological transition from fetal to 
newborn life.2 In the past, immediate cord 
clamping was normal practice in preterm in-
fants because of concerns about harm from de-
layed resuscitation, hypothermia, hyperbilirubi-
nemia, or polycythemia.3-6 However, increasing 
evidence suggested that immediate clamping 
may be harmful. Systematic reviews of random-
ized, controlled trials showed that in infants born 
before 37 weeks of gestation,1,5 delayed clamping 
improved blood pressure1,5 and reduced the inci-
dences of blood transfusion,1,5 intraventricular 
hemorrhage,1,5 necrotizing enterocolitis,1 and in-
fection.1 Furthermore, a systematic review of 12 
randomized, controlled trials involving 531 very 
preterm infants (<32 weeks of gestation) con-
cluded that enhanced placental transfusion — 
through delayed clamping, cord milking (milk-
ing the contents of the cord), or a combination 
of both — resulted in lower mortality and lower 
incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis and infec-
tion than immediate clamping.7 Whether de-
layed clamping alone has benefits with respect 
to mortality or the incidence of neurodevelop-
mental disability remains unknown.8,9 Various 
professional guidelines recommend delays of 
more than 30 seconds,10 30 to 60 seconds,4,11 at 
least 60 seconds,12,13 or 30 to 180 seconds,14 all if 
resuscitation is unnecessary4,10,11,14 Nevertheless, 
delayed clamping is not universally performed, 
owing to continuing anxiety about the risks of 
delayed resuscitation or hyperbilirubinemia.15,16 
We performed an unblinded, randomized, con-
trolled trial comparing delayed versus immediate 
clamping with respect to a composite outcome of 
death or major morbidity in preterm infants.
Methods
Patients
A randomized pilot trial of the effects on hemo-
globin concentration 6 hours after delivery of 
delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, milking 
the contents of the cord after delayed clamping, 
immediate cord clamping, or milking the con-
tents of the cord after immediate clamping in 
infants born before 32 weeks of gestation was 
prospectively registered on May 12, 2009, and 
began on October 21, 2009 (Australian and New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, 
 
ACTRN12609000248268). In May 2010, among 
the 38 infants for whom hemoglobin data were 
available, there were no significant differences 
among the randomized groups. The trial man-
agement committee made the decision to com-
pare only delayed versus immediate clamping in 
the main Australian Placental Transfusion Study 
(APTS), which was prospectively registered on 
August 2, 2010, and began on December 8, 2010.
APTS aimed to enroll 1600 fetuses from 
women expected to deliver before 30 weeks of 
gestation. A total of 9 infants from the pilot 
trial who were delivered before 30 weeks of ges-
tation and were randomly assigned to delayed or 
immediate clamping (without milking the cord) 
were included in APTS, with investigators un-
aware of clinical outcomes other than hemoglo-
bin concentration until data analysis began after 
May 25, 2017.17 Recruitment to APTS closed on 
January 6, 2017, with 25 centers in seven coun-
tries. Fetuses were eligible if obstetricians or 
maternal–fetal medicine specialists considered 
that they might be delivered before 30 weeks of 
gestation. Exclusion criteria included fetal hemo-
lytic disease, hydrops fetalis, twin–twin transfu-
sion, genetic syndromes, and potentially lethal 
malformations.
Participants were randomly assigned to im-
mediate clamping, defined as clamping within 
10 seconds after delivery, or delayed clamping, 
defined as clamping 60 seconds or more after 
delivery, with the infant held as low as possible 
below the introitus or placenta and without pal-
pation of the cord. Variations in procedure were 
permitted in the interests of mother, infant, or 
both. If the infant was nonvigorous (heart rate 
<100 beats per minute, low muscle tone, or lack 
of breathing or crying), clinicians used discretion 
in conducting the intervention. No cord milking 
was intended in either group. A clock in the re-
suscitation room was used for timing. Infants of 
multiple births underwent randomization indi-
vidually. Randomization was performed centrally 
when the operating theater was booked for cesar-
ean section or when vaginal delivery was consid-
ered to be inevitable, with the use of an interac-
tive voice-response system with minimization and 
with stratification according to gestational age 
(<27 weeks vs. ≥27 weeks), center, and multiple-
birth status (singleton birth vs. multiple birth).

Delayed vs. Immediate Cord Clamping in Preterm Infants
An ethics committee for each center approved the 
trial. A parent provided written informed consent. 
All the authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of data from their centers, and the au-
thors from the National Health and Medical Re-
search Council Clinical Trials Centre vouch for 
the analysis and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol. The protocol and statistical analysis 
plan are available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death 
or major morbidity, which was initially defined by 
the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Net-
work Data Dictionary18 as severe brain injury on 
postnatal ultrasonography, severe retinopathy of 
prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset 
sepsis, or chronic lung disease, each diagnosed by 
36 completed weeks of postmenstrual age. How-
ever, in March 2014, the trial management com-
mittee, which was monitoring pooled event rates 
with blinding to results according to treatment 
group, decided to remove chronic lung disease 
from the primary outcome. This followed recog-
nition in November 2013 that the pooled primary 
outcome rate was 64%, much higher than the ex-
pected pooled rate of 26%, because more infants 
than expected met the trial definition of chronic 
lung disease18,19 owing to a higher-than-expected 
rate of the use of continuous positive airway pres-
sure by means of nasal cannula until 36 weeks of 
postmenstrual age, without supplemental oxy-
gen.20,21 This decision was communicated to the 
independent data and safety monitoring commit-
tee, which supported this recommendation. The 
protocol was amended in July 2016 to reflect the 
updated primary outcome of death, severe brain 
injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necro-
tizing enterocolitis, or late-onset sepsis.
Severe brain injury on postnatal ultrasonogra-
phy was defined as intraventricular hemorrhage 
of grade 3 or 4 or late cerebral abnormality on 
ultrasonography. Late cerebral abnormality on ul-
trasonography was defined as echodense intrapa-
renchymal lesions, periventricular leukomalacia, 
porencephalic cysts, or ventriculomegaly between 
14 days after birth and a postmenstrual age of 
36 completed weeks. Severe retinopathy of pre-
maturity was defined as stage 4 retinopathy of 
prematurity or treatment for retinopathy of pre-
maturity by 36 completed weeks. Late-onset sep-
sis was defined as a positive culture in blood, 
cerebrospinal fluid, or urine between 48 hours 
from birth and 36 completed weeks in infants 
who died or who survived after at least a 5-day 
course of antibiotics. Chronic lung disease18,22 
was defined as the use of supplemental oxygen 
or assisted ventilation with or without supple-
mental oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual 
age.18,19 Detailed definitions are provided in the 
protocol. Infants who survived but had missing 
data for a component of major morbidity were 
excluded from the primary analysis. For practi-
cal reasons, no attempt was made to make staff 
who were diagnosing these morbidities unaware 
of the timing of cord clamping.
Secondary outcomes included death by 36 
completed weeks of postmenstrual age, death or 
severe brain injury on postnatal ultrasonography, 
severe brain injury, late cerebral abnormality on 
ultrasonography, intraventricular hemorrhage (all 
grades, grade 3 or 4, and grade 4 only), severe 
retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing entero-
colitis, late-onset sepsis, treated patent ductus 
arteriosus, and chronic lung disease,18,22 defined 
as above.18,19 Additional secondary outcomes of 
death, disability, and death or disability by 3 years 
are not reported here.
Tertiary outcomes (analyses of which were con-
sidered to be hypothesis generating) included 
birth weight, the number of red-cell transfusions 
by 36 weeks, the temperature of the infant on 
admission, the peak bilirubin level in the first 
week, the peak hematocrit in the first week; the 
duration of hospital stay if the infant was dis-
charged alive, maternal blood transfusion for 
postpartum hemorrhage, the use of uterotonic 
drugs, and exchange transfusions by 36 weeks 
of gestation. Because rates of endotracheal intu-
bation at delivery can vary considerably among 
centers23 and may not correlate with the rate of 
morbidity,20,23 they were not recorded. A 5-minute 
Apgar score of less than 4 was considered to be 
a better index of initial risk than endotracheal 
intubation.24,25 The Apgar score at 1 minute and 
5 minutes and an Apgar score of less than 4 at 
5 minutes were prespecified as tertiary outcomes 
in the statistical analysis plan.
Statistical Analysis
The original sample was 1600 infants, yielding 
90% power (two-sided P 
= 
0.05) to detect an ab-
solute difference in the incidence of the primary

outcome of 8 percentage points between the two 
groups (30% in the immediate-clamping group 
vs. 22% in the delayed-clamping group; relative 
difference, 27%), with the assumption of 10% 
nonadherence. If the rate of nonadherence to the 
intervention and loss to follow-up reached 20%, 
there was more than 80% power to detect this 
difference. After the change in the primary out-
come to exclude chronic lung disease, the pooled 
rate of the new primary outcome (36.7%) al-
lowed the detection of an absolute difference of 
9.9 percentage points (41.6% in the immediate-
clamping group vs. 31.7% in the delayed-clamp-
ing group; relative difference, 24%) in 1500 in-
fants with 80% power and 30% nonadherence.
An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee conducted three interim analyses with 
the use of the Haybittle–Peto method.26,27 The com-
mittee charter28 (provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org) expressed the 
view that a difference of at least 3 SD (i.e., P<0.003) 
in a major outcome suggesting net clinical benefit 
may be needed to advise that the trial manage-
ment committee consider stopping the trial pre-
maturely. This allowed the use of an unadjusted 
significance test to compare the final results.26,27
Data on infants born alive before 30 weeks of 
gestation were analyzed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. Analyses were prespeci-
fied in the trial protocol or the statistical analy-
sis plan before investigators were made aware of 
the results according to treatment group. Primary 
and secondary outcomes were assessed by means 
of generalized estimating equations with a log-
link function and compound symmetric correla-
tion structure accounting for multiple births.29 
Our analysis plan specified no adjustment for 
multiple outcomes. We performed post hoc ad-
justment (Benjamini–Hochberg procedure)30 for 
13 prespecified secondary outcomes (3 of which 
were to be assessed at follow-up). Treatment ef-
fects were summarized with the use of relative 
risks and 95% confidence intervals. The denomi-
nator for events was the number of infants for 
whom each outcome was known. Short-term sec-
ondary outcomes were analyzed with the use of 
chi-square tests, two-sample t-tests, or Wilcoxon 
tests as appropriate. Tests for interaction were 
used to detect heterogeneity for the primary out-
come in three prespecified subgroups: gesta-
tional age (<27 weeks vs. ≥27 weeks), sex, and 
method of delivery (cesarean section vs. vaginal 
delivery). An exploratory analysis was undertak-
en with randomization ignored and clamping 
time included as a continuous predictor. Another 
exploratory analysis, in relation to clusters of sites 
ordered according to adherence to treatment, is 
outlined in the statistical analysis plan; results 
are not reported here. Two-sided P values of less 
than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical 
significance. Statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute).
Results
Trial Infants
Of 1634 fetuses that underwent randomization, 
54 were born after 30 weeks, 10 were stillborn, 
and 4 had consent withdrawn (Fig. 1). A total of 
1566 infants were born alive before 30 weeks of 
gestation and were eligible for evaluation. Of these, 
782 were assigned to immediate cord clamping 
and 784 to delayed cord clamping. Of all infants, 
65.7% were born by cesarean delivery, 24.9% 
were of multiple births, and 56.4% were male 
(Table 1). The 54 infants who were born after 30 
weeks were treated off-protocol according to the 
usual practice of the trial site, and outcomes are 
unknown. Data on infants who were screened for 
eligibility were not recorded and are not shown in 
Figure 1.
Treatment Adherence
The median time between delivery and cord clamp-
ing was 5 seconds (range, 0 to 360) for immediate 
clamping and 60 seconds (range, 0 to 94) for 
delayed clamping. The rate of adherence to ran-
domized treatment was 94.9% in the immediate-
clamping group and 73.2% in the delayed-clamp-
ing group (Table 2). In the immediate-clamping 
group, nonadherence mostly reflected imple-
mentation issues (in 14 of 34 infants [41%]) or a 
slightly longer than specified time between de-
livery and cord clamping (in 13 of 34 infants 
[38%]); in the delayed-clamping group, the pri-
mary reason was clinical concerns about infant 
well-being (in 146 of 209 infants [69.9%]).
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
There was no significant difference in the inci-
dence of the primary outcome at 36 weeks between

Delayed vs. Immediate Cord Clamping in Preterm Infants
delayed clamping (37.0%) and immediate clamp-
ing (37.2%) (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.13; P 
= 
0.96) (Table 3). Death 
by 36 weeks occurred in 6.4% of the infants in the 
delayed-clamping group versus 9.0% of those in 
the immediate-clamping group (relative risk, 0.69; 
95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.03 unadjusted and 0.39 
after post hoc adjustment for multiple secondary 
comparisons). There was no significant differ-
ence between the two groups in other secondary 
outcomes. In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, 520 
of 756 infants in the delayed-clamping group 
(68.8%) and 498 of 748 infants in the immediate-
clamping group (66.6%) met the original defini-
tion of the primary composite outcome, which 
included chronic lung disease (relative risk, 1.03; 
95% CI, 0.96 to 1.10; P 
= 
0.45). In post hoc sen-
sitivity analyses with imputation of missing val-
ues as either an event of death or major morbidity 
or no event, the results were materially unchanged 
from those of the primary analysis (Table S2A in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Analyses of Prespecified Subgroups
The effects of delayed clamping versus immedi-
ate clamping on the primary outcome did not 
differ significantly according to sex, gestational 
age (<27 weeks vs. ≥27 weeks), or method of de-
livery (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery) (P≥0.10 
for all interactions) (Fig. 2).
Tertiary Outcomes
There were no significant differences between 
the two groups in median Apgar scores at 1 min-
ute and 5 minutes or in the percentage of infants 
with an Apgar score of less than 4 at 5 minutes 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
mean temperature on admission was lower by 
0.1oC in the delayed-clamping group than in the 
immediate-clamping group (P<0.001). The aver-
age peak hematocrit was higher by 2.7 percent-
age points (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.5) in the delayed-
clamping group than in the immediate-clamping 
group (P<0.001). There were no significant dif-
ferences between the two groups in the peak bili-
Figure 1. Randomization and Follow-up.
Immediate cord clamping was defined as clamping within 10 seconds after delivery, and delayed cord clamping was 
defined as clamping 60 seconds or more after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of death or major 
morbidity (defined as severe brain injury on postnatal ultrasonography, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necrotiz-
ing enterocolitis, or late-onset sepsis) by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. A total of nine infants (four in the immedi-
ate-clamping group and five in the delayed-clamping group) from a pilot trial were included in this trial.17

rubin level, the need for exchange or partial 
exchange transfusions, the number of blood 
transfusions received by 36 weeks, the length of 
hospital stay, the number of maternal blood 
transfusions, or the use of uterotonic agents (Ta-
bles S1 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Sensitivity and Additional Exploratory 
Analyses
In a prespecified sensitivity analysis, the relative 
risk of death or major morbidity was not sig-
nificantly lower in the delayed-clamping group 
than in the immediate-clamping group after 
adjustment for gestational age, sex, and method 
of delivery (Table S2A in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In an exploratory analysis, the relative 
risk of death or major morbidity was not sig-
nificantly reduced with each 10-second delay in 
clamping (Table S2B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). There were no significant differences 
between the two groups in rates of intraven-
tricular hemorrhage or late cerebral abnormality 
on ultrasonography (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). More infants in the delayed-
clamping group than in the immediate-clamp-
ing group had polycythemia (defined as a peak 
hematocrit of either ≥65% or ≥70%), and fewer 
infants in the delayed-clamping group received 
red-cell transfusions (52.1%, vs. 60.5% in the 
immediate-clamping group; P 
= 
0.001) (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Among infants 
who were assigned to delayed clamping, those 
who had a delay of less than 60 seconds before 
clamping were of a younger mean gestational 
age, had a lower mean birth weight, and had 
lower Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes 
than those who had a delay of 60 seconds or more 
(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this large, multicenter, randomized trial, we 
found no significant difference in the primary 
composite outcome of death or major morbidity 
at 36 completed weeks of postmenstrual age be-
tween infants assigned to delayed cord clamping 
and those assigned to immediate cord clamping. 
There was also no significant difference in the 
primary outcome according to sex, gestational 
age, or method of delivery (Fig. 2) or in the 
originally defined primary composite outcome 
of death or major morbidity, which included 
chronic lung disease.
Fewer infants in the delayed-clamping group 
than in the immediate-clamping group died by 
36 weeks (unadjusted P 
= 
0.03).31 However, this may 
be a chance finding, because death by 36 weeks 
was 1 of 13 prespecified secondary outcomes that 
we analyzed, 10 of which are included in the pres-
ent report; in post hoc analyses with adjustment 
for multiple comparisons, the difference was not 
significant (P 
= 
0.39). A previous systematic review 
of randomized, controlled trials showed lower 
mortality with placental transfusion than with-
out it, although that report included trials of de-

Delayed vs. Immediate Cord Clamping in Preterm Infants
layed clamping or milking of the umbilical cord.7 
Whether delayed clamping reduces mortality re-
quires clarification in an updated systematic re-
view.32 No trials of delayed versus immediate 
cord clamping, including the present one, have 
been powered for mortality. To yield 90% power 
to detect a 20% difference in the risk of death 
(8.0% in the immediate-clamping group vs. 6.4% 
in the delayed-clamping group), a trial would need 
more than 11,000 patients, probably requiring in-
ternational collaboration and a greater integration 
of clinical research with routine care.33
We found no significant difference in the rates 
of major morbidity between the randomized 
groups (Table 3). This finding contrasts with those 
of earlier systematic reviews involving smaller 
populations,1,5 which concluded that delayed 
clamping reduced intraventricular hemorrhage,1,5 
necrotizing enterocolitis,1 and late-onset sepsis1 
— evidence that underpins current recommen-
dations for delayed clamping.4,10-14 Discrepancies 
between past and current evidence might be ex-
plained if the infants in APTS were less severely 
ill than earlier cohorts. Although we did not 
have detailed clinical data on infants in the trial 
overall, all 266 infants in the APTS echocardio-
graphic substudy (see the protocol) received an-
tenatal glucocorticoids, and their average systemic 
blood flow was higher than in infants enrolled in 
previous studies.34 The difference of 2.7 percentage

60 seconds, and infants in either group whose cord was milked.
§  
The protocol specified a time between delivery and cord clamping of no more than 10 seconds in the immediate-
clamping group and of at least 60 seconds in the delayed-clamping group as well as no cord milking in either group.
¶  
Implementation issues included miscommunication and logistic issues.

Delayed vs. Immediate Cord Clamping in Preterm Infants
points in peak hematocrit in the first week be-
tween the delayed-clamping group and the imme-
diate-clamping group (P<0.001) is consistent with 
placental transfusion (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Although the number of 
transfusions overall did not differ significantly 
between the two groups, an additional analysis 
that was prespecified in the statistical analysis 
plan showed that a smaller percentage of infants 
in the delayed-clamping group than in the imme-
diate-clamping group received any red-cell trans-
fusions. However, these analyses were considered 
hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted 
cautiously.
The high rate of nonadherence to delayed 
clamping reflects widespread concern about the 
possible hazards of delayed resuscitation in pre-
term infants.15,16 We found no significant differ-
ence between the two groups in the risk of a low 
Apgar score at 5 minutes, and previous trials 
comparing delayed clamping versus immediate 
clamping showed no significant differences in 
rates of intubation at delivery.7 However, among 
infants who were assigned to delayed clamping, 
those who underwent earlier clamping (<60 sec-
onds) were more premature and had lower Apgar 
scores than those who underwent clamping af-
ter 60 seconds or more; some may have needed, 
and benefited from, rapid resuscitation. The 
preferred care of infants who are judged to need 
immediate resuscitation remains unknown.
This pragmatic trial minimized data collec-
tion to maximize enrollment.17,35,36 We did not 
collect data for this trial on antenatal glucocor-
ticoids, heart rate, oxygen saturation, the fraction 
of inspired oxygen, time to onset of breathing, 
and intubation rates. We include only short-term 
outcomes in the present report; follow-up in 
childhood is planned.8,9
In conclusion, among infants in our trial 
population, delayed clamping of the umbilical 
cord did not result in a lower incidence of the 
primary outcome of death or major morbidity by 
36 weeks of postmenstrual age than immediate 
clamping.
