ABSTRACT Infection with Listeria monocytogenes during pregnancy is associated
with miscarriage, preterm birth, and neonatal complications, including sepsis and
meningitis. While the risk of these conditions is thought to be greatest during the
third trimester of pregnancy, the determinants of fetoplacental susceptibility to in-
fection, the contribution of gestational age, and the in vivo progression of disease at
the maternal-fetal interface are poorly understood. We developed a nonhuman pri-
mate model of listeriosis to better understand antecedents of adverse pregnancy
outcomes in early pregnancy. Four pregnant cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicu-
laris) received a single intragastric inoculation between days 36 and 46 of gestation
with 107 CFU of an L. monocytogenes strain isolated from a previous cluster of hu-
man listeriosis cases that resulted in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fecal shedding,
maternal bacteremia, and fetal demise were consistently noted within 7 to 13 days.
Biopsy specimens of maternal liver, spleen, and lymph node displayed variable in-
flammation and relatively low bacterial burden. In comparison, we observed greater
bacterial burden in the decidua and placenta and the highest burden in fetal tissues.
Histopathology indicated vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, and thrombosis of the decid-
ual spiral arteries, acute chorioamnionitis and villitis in the placenta, and hematoge-
nous infection of the fetus. Vascular pathology suggests early impact of L. monocyto-
genes infection on spiral arteries in the decidua, which we hypothesize precipitates
subsequent placentitis and fetal demise. These results demonstrate that L. monocyto-
genes tropism for the maternal reproductive tract results in infection of the decidua,
placenta, and the fetus itself during the first trimester of pregnancy.
IMPORTANCE Although listeriosis is known to cause significant fetal morbidity and
mortality, it is typically recognized in the third trimester of human pregnancy. Its im-
pact on early pregnancy is poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that exposure
to L. monocytogenes in the first trimester poses a greater risk of fetal loss than cur-
rently appreciated. Similarities in human and nonhuman primate placentation, physi-
ology, and reproductive immunology make this work highly relevant to human
pregnancy. We highlight the concept that the maternal immune response that pro-
tects the mother from serious disease is unable to protect the fetus, a concept rele-
vant to classic TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes)
infections and newly illuminated by current Zika virus outbreaks. Studies with this
model, using the well-understood organism L. monocytogenes, will permit precise

significance to both recognized and emerging infections in the setting of pregnancy.
L
isteria monocytogenes is an environmentally ubiquitous bacterium that causes
foodborne illness. While infection in healthy individuals is generally not associated
with significant disease, it poses a substantial risk for specific populations, including
immunocompromised, elderly, or pregnant individuals. Listeriosis during pregnancy is
generally associated with a spectrum of adverse outcomes during the third trimester,
including miscarriage, preterm labor, stillbirth, and neonatal infection (1). Inflammation
of fetal membranes and placental villitis are noted in these cases (2), but the actual
course of events at the maternal-fetal interface that cause fetal demise are poorly
understood. In the clinic, human placental tissues generally are not available until after
an adverse outcome, at which point fetal infection has progressed for an indeterminate
period of time. In vitro studies with tissue explants from human first (3) or third (4)
trimester placentas concluded that either extravillous trophoblasts (3) or syncytiotro-
phoblasts (4) are likely the primary route of placental infection. However, in vitro studies
are limited in reproducing the physiological and immunological complexity at the
maternal-fetal interface, and it is unclear how infection proceeds in vivo. Growing
recognition of the impact of microbial infections on fetal well-being (e.g., Zika virus or
TORCH [toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes] infections) (5, 6)
underscores the importance of gaining a better mechanistic understanding of such
events. The aim of this study was to establish a nonhuman primate model to map the
outcome of infection with L. monocytogenes during early pregnancy. Like humans,
macaques and other nonhuman primates have villous hemochorial placentas and
invasive extravillous fetal trophoblasts that actively remodel maternal spiral arteries in
the decidua. Their similar endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems make nonhu-
man primates a highly relevant model for examining the interplay of maternal and fetal
responses to infection during pregnancy. Remarkably, first trimester inoculation of
cynomolgus macaques consistently resulted in maternal and fetal infection followed by
fetal death within 7 to 13 days postinoculation. This contrasts with the general
assumption that listeriosis is of greatest concern during the third trimester of preg-
nancy. Microbial analysis of collected tissues revealed that the decidua basalis and
placental bed as well as the placenta had significant bacterial burden. These findings
suggest that maternal infection affects both the placenta—the presumptive target of
listeriosis during human pregnancy—and the maternal reproductive tract.
RESULTS
Physiological responses to L. monocytogenes inoculation. Table S1 in the sup-
plemental material summarizes the infection schedule, dose, and vital signs of each
animal. Four cynomolgus macaques were inoculated in early gestation. Each animal
received ~107 CFU of L. monocytogenes in 10 ml of whipping cream through a soft
intragastric feeding tube while under sedation. This strain of L. monocytogenes was
associated with a listeriosis outbreak that resulted in adverse pregnancy outcomes in 11
pregnant women (7). Following inoculation, animals were observed to ensure bacteria
were not lost due to emesis. Subsequently, animals were monitored for changes in
behavior, defecation, and food intake. There were no notable behavioral changes
associated with L. monocytogenes administration. Two of the animals that received
L. monocytogenes had mild fever (body temperature of �38.89°
C) in the days prior to
fetal demise.
Fecal shedding. L. monocytogenes was not detectable in any fecal samples prior to
inoculation and was first detectable in the stool between 1 and 5 days postinoculation
in 3 out of 4 animals. In 2 animals, there was intermittent shedding of bacteria with
detection of colonies up to 3 weeks postinoculation (Fig. 1A and B). L. monocytogenes
was not detected at any date in feces from one animal (cy25), although this animal had

 both bacteremia and fetal demise. Control animals did not shed L. monocytogenes at
any time.
Bacteremia. Peripheral blood samples were collected to monitor bacteremia pre-
and postinoculation. There was no detectable growth in preinoculation samples.
Bacteremia was detectable in all animals in at least one sample within 4 to 14 days of
inoculation (Fig. 1A and B).
Hematology. Complete blood cell counts were within reference ranges for female
cynomolgus macaques, except for elevated numbers of monocytes near the day of
surgery (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). One animal that received L. mono-
cytogenes had elevated lymphocytes, and 2 of the 4 animals had elevated basophils in
comparison to control animals, but there were no statistically significant differences
between pre- and postinoculation levels of any leukocyte subset within individual
animals. The differences observed among subjects most likely relate to individual
variation in a genetically diverse animal model rather than response to infection.
Pregnancy outcome. Fetal demise occurred within 7 to 13 days postinfection in all
four pregnancies. Figure 1 summarizes each animal’
s gestation day at inoculation,
postinfection fecal shedding of L. monocytogenes, peripheral blood bacteremia, day of
surgical collection of tissues when loss of fetal heartbeat was detected by ultrasound,
and estimated day of fetal death based on the date of the last documented fetal
heartbeat and the degree of autolysis observed during histological examination.
Tissue bacterial burden. Bacteriological analysis of maternal biopsy specimens and
fetal tissue homogenates demonstrated remarkable similarity across all pregnancies
(Fig. 2), with average bacterial burdens of �105 CFU/g in maternal nonreproductive
tissues of lymph node, spleen, and liver, 2 � 106 CFU/g in placental bed/myometrium,
2 � 107 CFU/g in umbilical cord and amniotic fluid, 1 � 108 CFU/g in decidua and
placenta, and �108 CFU/g in fetal tissues.
Control inoculations. Two dams in the first trimester of pregnancy were fed 10 ml
of whipping cream without L. monocytogenes to serve as gestational age-matched
negative controls and were monitored by the same parameters as Listeria-inoculated
animals. Uterotomy was performed at gestation days 51 (cy27) and 55 (cy26) for
removal of the fetoplacental unit. Maternal and fetal tissues were processed in the same
manner as experimental animals. L. monocytogenes was not detected in feces, blood,
maternal tissues, or fetal tissues.

 Gross examination. At surgery, the placental discs from infected animals were
noted to be mottled yellow-white to red-purple with focal to multifocal areas of
hemorrhage and coalescing areas of pallor (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).
Umbilical cords were edematous, with vessels visible through the serosal surface. Fetal
tissues were variably edematous and fragile, especially the liver. The lungs were mildly
mottled. The fetus of one animal, cy19, had mild to moderate fetal tissue autolysis
compatible with fetal demise approximately 18 to 24 h prior to collection. No pathol-
ogies were noted in control animals.
Histopathology at the maternal-fetal interface. Placental bed and decidual spec-
imens demonstrated significantly greater bacterial burden than other maternal tissues,
which correlated with histologic lesions of multifocal suppurative endometritis and
deciduitis (Fig. 3A) with sporadic Gram-positive intralesional bacteria (Fig. 3B). Decidual
tissues from all animals demonstrated vascular pathology on histologic examination
(Fig. 3C). Decidual spiral arteries, normally remodeled by endovascular trophoblasts,
demonstrated vasculitis, necrotic fibrosis, and thrombosis highly atypical for early
pregnancy (8) (Fig. 3D). Gram-positive rods were observed within maternal spiral
arteries (Fig. 3B). Suppurative necrosis and edema within the decidua basalis were
marked, in contrast to control tissues (Fig. 3E and F). The cytotrophoblastic shell that
anchors the placenta and demarcates the boundary between maternal decidua basalis
and fetal villi (9) demonstrated neutrophilic infiltration, multifocal necrosis of anchoring
villi and syncytium, and multiple microabscesses (Fig. 4A and B). Histologic examination
of placental specimens included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gram stain, and Listeria-
specific immunofluorescence. There was mild to severe multifocal necrosuppurative
villitis, intervillositis (Fig. 4C and D), and vasculitis with necrosis of villous vessels and
intralesional bacteria. Fetal membranes contained Gram-positive and listeria O antigen-
positive rods with severe diffuse necrotizing and suppurative chorioamnionitis with
moderate edema (Fig. 5A to D; see Fig. S3C in the supplemental material). The umbilical
cord had moderate diffuse edema, mild multifocal neutrophilic and plasmacytic vasc-
ulitis and perivasculitis, thrombophlebitis, and mild multifocal vascular fibrinoid necro-
sis with intralesional bacteria (Fig. 5E).
Maternal extrauterine histopathology. Maternal extrauterine tissue biopsy spec-
imens demonstrated variable and relatively low levels of infection as determined by
bacteriological assay (Fig. 2). Tissue CFU per gram ranged between 0 and 105 in liver
and between 102 and 104 in lymph node and spleen. cy19 and cy22 had moderate
diffuse neutrophilia in the red pulp of the maternal spleen and mild diffuse suppurative
hepatitis with single-cell necrosis, focal vasculitis, and mild diffuse glycogen vacuoliza-

DISCUSSION
While it is recognized that adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal
listeriosis typically include placental infection, the precise pathogenesis of placental
infection and subsequent fetal infection remains incompletely described. This study
demonstrates that within 7 to 13 days following first trimester intragastric inoculation,
there is modest infection of maternal extrauterine tissues with extraordinarily high
numbers of L. monocytogenes in the decidua and placenta. In addition, degenerative
changes in spiral arteries were associated with the implantation site within 8 days
postinoculation. These results reveal a remarkable tropism, attack rate, and consistent
pathophysiology in first trimester listeriosis.
It was previously reported that adverse outcomes occurred in approximately 30% of
macaques infected with L. monocytogenes at approximately day 110 of gestation (10).
Animals with stillbirth shed L. monocytogenes from the gastrointestinal tract for a longer
period of time than animals with normal birth. These authors estimated that the fetal
50% lethal dose (LD50) was 1 � 107 organisms. Consistent with our study, these authors
did not observe outward signs of maternal illness or significant changes in blood cell
counts. In contrast to these third trimester experimental infections, all four animals

 infected in the first trimester of pregnancy in the present study rapidly progressed to
fetal demise. Three animals displayed fecal shedding of L. monocytogenes, and all
animals had positive blood cultures in conjunction with fetal demise. It is possible that
the strain of L. monocytogenes employed in the present study is more virulent than
strains used in prior macaque studies. However, our observation of unremarkable
pregnancy progression and lack of fetal or placental infection following a third trimes-
ter (day 110) inoculation with this strain suggests that gestational age may influence

 maternal-fetal susceptibility to infection. Thus, it appears that the maternal-fetal inter-
face in early pregnancy in the macaque is exquisitely sensitive to listeriosis.
Only a few reports of pregnancy outcome in nonhuman primates with listeriosis are
available (11), and none examined early gestational experimental infection. Similarly,
there are few reports of pregnancy outcome in early gestation with human cases of
listeriosis (1, 12, 13). Because the majority of case reports come from third trimester and
neonatal infections, listeriosis is often characterized as a concern for late pregnancy (14,
15). We suggest that the number of first trimester miscarriages due to infection by
L. monocytogenes is underreported because maternal listeriosis is often asymptomatic
and unlikely to raise suspicion of infection (16). As maternal complications and fetal loss
in late pregnancy will require medical attention, they are more likely to be reported.
The ability to study early pregnancy loss in a nonhuman primate model with
placentation and gestation highly similar to those of humans is invaluable. Collection
of discrete tissue samples and monitoring of maternal and fetal biomarkers throughout
pregnancy are not possible in human studies, and the prolonged incubation periods
seen in human outbreaks (17, 18) make it difficult to accurately determine exposure
dose or timing of infection. Controlling these parameters in a nonhuman primate
model allows precise monitoring of disease progression. Subsequent studies to char-
acterize immune cell activation at the maternal-fetal interface, ontogeny of pathogen-
esis, and consequences of reexposure to L. monocytogenes will shed additional light on
mechanisms of fetal loss in listeriosis.
How L. monocytogenes enters the placenta remains incompletely understood. As a
foodborne pathogen, L. monocytogenes trafficks from the maternal gastrointestinal
tract to maternal organs, including the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, before coloniz-
ing the reproductive tract. Nonpregnant women without comorbidities are as resistant
to infection as other healthy individuals; however, even healthy pregnant women have
an increased risk of listeriosis (19, 20). Bakardjiev et al. demonstrated in a guinea pig
model that only a few bacteria need reach the placenta to proliferate and then
disseminate back to the maternal organs, because the placenta provides an immune-
privileged reservoir for replication (21). Placentitis is a hallmark of listeriosis, but it is
possible that the placenta may be an organ of collateral damage as well as a proximal
target of L. monocytogenes. Poulsen et al. previously reported that LM2203 colonizes
the uteri of nonpregnant as well as pregnant mice and suggested that fetal loss may
be a consequence of preferential trafficking to the uterus (22). Early in gestation,
fetus-derived extravillous trophoblast cells invade the decidua and remodel the ma-
ternal vasculature to ensure a sufficient exchange of nutrients and oxygen between
mother and fetus. These structural changes may facilitate colonization of the uterus and
potentially give entry to the fetal vasculature that underlies the syncytiotrophoblast,
which itself has been found to be restrictive to infection (23, 24). As in humans,
nonhuman primate placentas are comprised of cotyledons, or lobules, which contain a
main stem villus with its branches (25). Remarkably, in animal cy19, the placental
cotyledon associated with an individual disrupted spiral artery (Fig. 3C) had concomi-
tant villitis.
One means of bacterial entry into the placenta may be through degeneration of the
syncytiotrophoblast layer during the acute inflammatory response to L. monocytogenes
at the maternal-fetal interface. The nonpregnant endometrium and pregnant decidua
contain a resident maternal immune cell population that has been found to regulate
L. monocytogenes infection in murine models of early pregnancy (26). In mice, bacterial
burden was associated with restriction of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages from the
decidua, suggesting that maternal immune tolerance toward the fetus may allow for
unchecked bacterial proliferation. A distinct advantage of this nonhuman primate
model is that macaque and human decidua contain highly similar subsets of NK cells,
macrophages, and regulatory T cells, which are thought to play crucial roles in
remodeling of decidual spiral arteries and maintenance of maternal tolerance toward
fetal tissues (27–30). Given the extensive neutrophilic infiltrate noted in our study, we
propose that L. monocytogenes elicits a strong proinflammatory response in the non-

 human primate decidua that resolves maternal infection but results in damage to the
integrity of the maternal-fetal interface, thus allowing L. monocytogenes to traverse the
placental barrier and access the fetus. An overview of the macaque maternal-fetal
interface during the first trimester is presented in Fig. 6.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to document the outcome and histopa-
thology of early pregnancy L. monocytogenes infection in a nonhuman primate model.
From the present findings, we conclude that listeriosis in first trimester pregnancy leads
to damage to decidual, placental, and fetal tissues followed by rapid fetal demise. In
addition, the presence of bacteria within intervillous spaces (maternal circulation),
villous capillaries, the umbilical cord, fetal liver, and fetal lungs (fetal circulation) is
highly suggestive of a hematogenous route of fetal infection. Since it was not possible
to determine the relative timing of decidual and placental infection in the present
study, future studies tracing the spatiotemporal movement of L. monocytogenes
through the nonhuman primate maternal-fetal interface will be useful in defining the
pathogenesis of bacterial transmission to the fetus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and breeding. Adult female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were purchased
from commercial vendors and maintained at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center. All
experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines for care and use of
laboratory animals and under the approval of the University of Wisconsin Graduate School Animal Care
and Use Committee. Female monkeys were cohoused with compatible males and observed daily for
menses and copulation. Pregnancy was detected by ultrasound examination of the uterus approximately
18 to 20 days following the predicted day of ovulation. The day of gestation when pregnancy was
detected was estimated based on previous experience and published data describing cynomolgus
macaque fetal size during gestation (31). Ultrasound examination of the uterus was done weekly or
biweekly until the day of inoculation with L. monocytogenes and after inoculation on schedules described
below.
Inoculation with L. monocytogenes. At varied days of gestation in the first trimester (days 36, 39,
40, and 46 [term is day 165]), monkeys were sedated, the uterus was examined by ultrasound to confirm
a viable pregnancy, and approximately 107 CFU log-phase cells of strain LM2203 (alternative designation,
WS1) from a 2000 outbreak of listeriosis among pregnant women in Winston-Salem, NC (7), were
administered in 10 ml of whipping cream via a soft intragastric feeding tube as previously described (32).
Two monkeys were given a Listeria-free whipping cream inoculum in an identical manner at gestation
days 38 and 41 and were included as uninfected controls for histological and physiological comparison.
A portion of the inoculum was diluted, plated on blood agar, and incubated at 37°
C to confirm precisely
the CFU per milliliter of L. monocytogenes given to each animal.

 Fecal shedding. Before and after inoculation, fecal samples were collected from cage pans for
analysis of fecal shedding of L. monocytogenes. Schedules of sample collection are described in the
legends to Fig. 1 and 2. Serial dilutions of fecal samples were plated in duplicate on modified Oxford agar
plates (33), and the number of colonies was determined using ImageJ colony-counting software after 24
to 48 h of incubation at 37°
C.
Bacteremia monitoring. Peripheral blood samples were collected periodically for aerobic and
anaerobic culture to detect bacteremia as previously described (34) and processed on a BD Bactec 9050
blood culture system (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) in the Clinical Pathology Laboratory at the
University of Wisconsin—Madison School of Veterinary Medicine. Aseptically inoculated pediatric Bactec
Peds Plus/F blood culture bottles (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) were incubated until a positive
signal was observed or for a maximum of 5 days. Bottles that were not positive at the end of 5 days were
Gram stained and subcultured to verify the absence of bacterial growth.
Surgery and tissue processing. Ultrasound examination of the uterus was done 1 to 3 times per
week after L. monocytogenes dosing to monitor fetal well-being and confirm fetal heartbeat and umbilical
blood flow. When fetal demise was indicated by absence of heartbeat, fetal and maternal tissues were
surgically collected at laparotomy. These were survival surgeries for the dams. For products of gestation,
the entire conceptus (decidua, placenta, fetal membranes, umbilical cord, amniotic fluid, and fetus) was
removed by uterotomy. Biopsy specimens of the placental bed (uterine placental attachment site
containing deep decidua basalis, myometrium, and uterine serosa), maternal liver, spleen, and a
mesenteric lymph node were collected aseptically. The fetus was dissected into 3- to 4-mm coronal
segments, and alternating segments were fixed and embedded for histology (see below), or homoge-
nized for bacteriological analysis on blood agar plates as previously described (35).
Histology. Dissected tissues were fixed in 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 to 72 h, rinsed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored in 70% ethanol until processed and embedded in paraffin.
Paraffin sections (5 �m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gram stained using standard
methods. Fetal trophoblasts in the decidua were visualized by chromogenic immunohistochemistry with
anticytokeratin (CAM 5.2; 1 �g/ml [Becton, Dickinson]) using previously reported methods (36).
Statistical analysis. Analysis of the data for fecal and tissue CFU per gram was performed using
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For maternal vital signs and peripheral
blood leukocyte data, means � standard deviations (SD) were calculated for each group, and the
statistical significance of the differences between pairs of groups was assessed, as well as the differences
within individual preinfection versus postinfection measurements, using a mixed-effects logistic regres-
sion model with statistical consult at the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.
