BACKGROUND
The effect of a restrictive versus liberal red-cell transfusion strategy on clinical out-
comes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains unclear.
METHODS
In this multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 5243 adults 
undergoing cardiac surgery who had a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk 
Evaluation (EuroSCORE) I of 6 or more (on a scale from 0 to 47, with higher scores 
indicating a higher risk of death after cardiac surgery) to a restrictive red-cell 
transfusion threshold (transfuse if hemoglobin level was <7.5 g per deciliter, start-
ing from induction of anesthesia) or a liberal red-cell transfusion threshold (trans-
fuse if hemoglobin level was <9.5 g per deciliter in the operating room or intensive 
care unit [ICU] or was <8.5 g per deciliter in the non-ICU ward). The primary com-
posite outcome was death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-
onset renal failure with dialysis by hospital discharge or by day 28, whichever came 
first. Secondary outcomes included red-cell transfusion and other clinical outcomes.
RESULTS
The primary outcome occurred in 11.4% of the patients in the restrictive-threshold 
group, as compared with 12.5% of those in the liberal-threshold group (absolute 
risk difference, −1.11 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.93 to 0.72; 
odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.07; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Mortality was 
3.0% in the restrictive-threshold group and 3.6% in the liberal-threshold group 
(odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.16). Red-cell transfusion occurred in 52.3% of 
the patients in the restrictive-threshold group, as compared with 72.6% of those in 
the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.47). There were no 
significant between-group differences with regard to the other secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at moderate-to-high risk for death, 
a restrictive strategy regarding red-cell transfusion was noninferior to a liberal strat-
egy with respect to the composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial in-
farction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis, with less blood transfused.

T
he avoidance of unnecessary blood 
transfusion is a high priority; therefore, 
determining safe thresholds for transfu-
sion is imperative.1,2 Among the highest recipients 
of red-cell transfusion are patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery,2-6 with a substantial proportion 
of the total blood supply used by this group.7,8 
Whether a restrictive approach to intraoperative 
and postoperative transfusion in cardiac surgery 
safely achieves outcomes similar to those achieved 
by means of a more liberal approach remains 
unclear.9-12
The infectious and noninfectious risks asso-
ciated with transfusion support a restrictive trans-
fusion practice in several clinical settings.13-15 
However, anemia, particularly in the periopera-
tive setting, may also be detrimental.16-19 Patients 
who are at high perioperative risk may be more 
susceptible to anemia-induced tissue hypoxia,20 
potentially exposing them to an increased risk of 
complications and death if a restrictive approach 
is used.21 We conducted a multicenter, random-
ized, controlled trial to determine whether a re-
strictive transfusion strategy applied throughout 
the perioperative period would be noninferior, 
in terms of major morbidities and mortality, to 
a liberal approach among patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery who had a moderate-to-high risk 
of death.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery 
(TRICS) III trial was an international, open-label, 
randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial that 
compared restrictive and liberal red-cell transfu-
sion strategies in adults undergoing cardiac sur-
gery with cardiopulmonary bypass who had a 
moderate-to-high predicted risk of death accord-
ing to the European System for Cardiac Operative 
Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE I; scores are on a 
scale from 0 to 47, with higher scores indicating 
a higher risk of death after cardiac surgery).22,23 
An appropriately authorized ethics committee ap-
proved the trial in all the participating centers.
The trial was supported by the Canadian In-
stitutes of Health Research, the Canadian Blood 
Services–Health Canada, the National Health and 
Medical Research Council of Australia, and the 
Health Research Council of New Zealand. The 
funders had no role in the trial design or conduct; 
in the collection, management, analysis, or inter-
pretation of the data; or in the preparation or 
review of the manuscript or the approval of the 
manuscript for submission. The trial was designed 
by the executive committee and carried out by the 
TRICS investigators (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org). The first author and the last four 
authors vouch for the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (available 
at NEJM.org).
Participants
We enrolled participants 18 years of age or older 
who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery 
with cardiopulmonary bypass and who had a pre-
operative additive EuroSCORE I of 6 or higher. The 
EuroSCORE I has been validated previously and 
has been shown to be predictive of an in-hospital 
mortality of 4% or more (see the Supplementary 
Appendix for a list of the EuroSCORE I compo-
nents).24,25 We excluded patients if they were un-
able to receive blood products, declined blood 
products, were involved in a preoperative autolo-
gous donation program, were undergoing heart 
transplantation, were having surgery solely for the 
insertion of a ventricular assist device, or were 
pregnant or lactating. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all the participants before 
enrollment.
Randomization and Intervention
Before surgery, eligible patients were randomly 
assigned to one of two red-cell transfusion strat-
egies, in a 1:1 ratio with the use of a concealed 
centralized, Web-based system, stratified accord-
ing to center, with computer-generated random 
permuted blocks of varying sizes from two to six. 
Patients who were randomly assigned to the re-
strictive transfusion strategy received a red-cell 
transfusion if their hemoglobin concentration was 
less than 7.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively or 
postoperatively. Patients who were randomly as-
signed to the liberal transfusion strategy received 
a red-cell transfusion if their hemoglobin concen-
tration was less than 9.5 g per deciliter intraop-
eratively or postoperatively in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) or if the hemoglobin concentration was 
less than 8.5 g per deciliter when the patient was 
in the non-ICU ward. Attending physicians had 
to follow the assigned transfusion strategy from 
induction of anesthesia for the index cardiac sur-

gical procedure until either hospital discharge or 
28 days after surgery, whichever came first.
The hemoglobin level was to be measured at 
least at the following intervals: preoperatively, be-
fore cardiopulmonary bypass, during cardiopul-
monary bypass, after cardiopulmonary bypass, 
on arrival in the ICU, and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 
and 11 while the patient was still hospitalized. 
If the hemoglobin concentration fell below the 
appropriate threshold at any time, 1 unit of red 
cells was administered at a time and was followed 
with a reassessment of the hemoglobin concen-
tration. Red-cell transfusion was to be adminis-
tered as soon as possible after the threshold-relat-
ed hemoglobin concentration was measured and 
had to be initiated within the following maximum 
time frames: 2 hours for patients during an opera-
tion; 18 hours in the ICU, including step-down 
units; or 40 hours on the non-ICU hospital ward. 
The protocol allowed physicians to recheck bor-
derline measurements of the hemoglobin concen-
tration before transfusion and to suspend the red-
cell transfusion protocol temporarily in patients 
who had rapid blood loss or hemodynamic in-
stability due to blood loss. The protocol was re-
sumed as soon as hemostasis was achieved or at 
a maximum of 24 hours after suspension. Other 
blood products could be administered in accor-
dance with published guidelines and local prac-
tice on the basis of the presence of ongoing bleed-
ing and documented measurement of abnormal 
coagulation.
Nonadherence to the assigned red-cell trans-
fusion strategy was considered to have occurred if 
a red-cell transfusion was given without a protocol-
defined hemoglobin threshold being met; or if a 
red-cell transfusion was not initiated after a trig-
ger was met, or a repeat hemoglobin value above 
the trigger was not measured, within the protocol-
defined time period. All other aspects of care were 
left to the discretion of the attending clinicians. It 
was not possible to use formal blinding of the 
assigned transfusion strategy with regard to the 
participants and medical staff. However, partici-
pants were not actively informed about the treat-
ment assignment, and outcome adjudicators were 
unaware of the trial-group assignments.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death 
from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis, oc-
curring during the index hospitalization from the 
start of surgery until either hospital discharge or 
28 days after surgery, whichever occurred first. 
The prespecified secondary outcomes included the 
components of the primary outcome, blood-prod-
uct (including red-cell) transfusion, lengths of stay 
in the ICU and in the hospital, duration of me-
chanical ventilation, prolonged state of low cardiac 
output, infection, bowel infarction, acute kidney 
injury, seizure, delirium, and encephalopathy. Def-
initions of the primary and secondary outcomes 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. All 
the deaths were verified centrally, and an adjudi-
cation committee whose members were unaware 
of the trial-group assignments evaluated all the 
other components of the primary outcome, as well 
as all reported instances of infection and bowel 
infarction.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the trial was to determine 
whether a restrictive transfusion threshold was 
noninferior to a liberal transfusion threshold. We 
initially planned that a sample of 3592 patients 
would provide the trial with 85% power to detect 
noninferiority at a one-sided alpha of 0.025, with 
the use of a noninferiority margin of 3 percent-
age points for the risk difference and assuming 
an event rate of the primary composite outcome of 
10%, with one interim analysis with a Haybittle–
Peto stopping rule (P 
= 
0.0001, one-sided). In No-
vember 2016, we increased the sample to 5000 
participants without inspecting the accumulated 
data in order to increase the power to 90%. In ad-
dition, we planned to include in the analysis all 
the participants who had undergone randomiza-
tion in our pilot trial (TRICS II; ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01484639), and we kept these data 
blinded until the completion of the TRICS III trial. 
Specific features of the TRICS II trial, such as the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, hemoglobin-con-
centration triggers, and outcome definitions, are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
The prespecified primary analysis of the pri-
mary outcome was a per-protocol analysis that 
included all the participants who had undergone 
randomization and who underwent surgery with 
cardiopulmonary bypass, except for patients who 
had a protocol adherence of less than 90%, pa-
tients who were withdrawn from the trial by the 
treating physician at any time, and patients who 
withdrew consent. We compared the risk differ-

ence for the primary outcome between groups 
against the noninferiority margin with a one-sided 
z-test at a one-sided alpha of 0.025. Confidence 
intervals for the primary and secondary outcomes 
are all two-sided 95% confidence intervals. We 
performed modified intention-to-treat and adjust-
ed analyses of the primary and secondary out-
comes to examine the consistency of the treatment 
effect. The modified intention-to-treat population 
included all the patients who underwent random-
ization except for those who did not undergo the 
planned surgical procedure and those who with-
drew consent preoperatively.
For binary outcomes, analyses were adjusted 
with the use of a logistic-regression model that 
included age, sex, preoperative renal function, pre-
existing chronic pulmonary disease (defined as the 
long-term use of bronchodilators or glucocorti-
coids for lung disease), preoperative left ventricu-
lar function, history of diabetes, type of surgery 
(coronary-artery bypass grafting [CABG] only, 
CABG plus another procedure, or other, non-CABG 
procedure), and preoperative hemoglobin con-
centration. Outcomes regarding length of stay in 
both the ICU and the hospital were analyzed with 
the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. We 
undertook prespecified, exploratory subgroup anal-
yses of the primary outcome to determine whether 
the effect of the transfusion strategy varied ac-
cording to prespecified subgroups. Primary anal-
yses were not stratified according to center. Ad-
ditional sensitivity analyses aimed to determine 
whether specific subgroups of patients that were 
defined according to protocol adherence, trans-
fusion exposure, and hemoglobin levels and the 
use of a mixed-effects model to account for varia-
tion between sites would yield similar results. 
Analyses were performed with the use of the 
 
R statistical package, version 3.2.4 (R Core Team 
[2016], www

Results
Participants
From January 20, 2014, to March 20, 2017, a to-
tal of 5035 patients underwent randomization at 
73 sites in 19 countries (for a complete list, see 
the Supplementary Appendix). An additional 208 
patients underwent randomization in the multi-
center pilot trial. Of the total of 5243 patients 
who underwent randomization, 54 did not have 
surgery, 63 did not have cardiopulmonary bypass, 
and 34 withdrew before surgery or were exclud-
ed for other reasons, which left 5092 patients in 
the modified intention-to-treat population. A to-
tal of 4860 patients (2430 in each group) were in-
cluded in the per-protocol analysis (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were similar in the two groups (Table 1); addi-
tional characteristics of the patients in the per-
protocol population and the baseline character-
istics of the patients in the intention-to-treat 
population are shown in Tables S1 and S2, re-
spectively, in the Supplementary Appendix. The 
mean (±SD) age of the patients was 72±10 years, 
35.4% of the patients were women, and the mean 
EuroSCORE I was 7.8±1.9. The distribution of type 
of surgery was CABG only (26.1%), CABG with 
another procedure (27.7%), and other, non-CABG 
procedure (46.2%).
Hemoglobin Concentrations  
and Transfusions
Overall, the mean hemoglobin concentration of 
the patients at baseline was 13.1±1.8 g per deci-
liter. During surgery, the hemoglobin concentra-
tion decreased in each group. Postoperatively, the 
concentrations in the two groups separated by 
approximately 1 g per deciliter and remained sepa-
rated from ICU admission through day 28 (Fig. 1).
In the restrictive-threshold group, 52.3% of 
the patients received a red-cell transfusion after 
randomization, as compared with 72.6% of those 
in the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 0.41; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.47; P<0.001) 
(Table 2). Patients who had a transfusion received 
a median of 2 units (interquartile range, 1 to 4) 
of red cells after randomization in the restric-
tive-threshold group, as compared with 3 units 
(interquartile range, 2 to 5) in the liberal-thresh-
old group (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.88) 
(Table 2).
Clinical Outcomes
Table 3 presents the primary and secondary clini-
cal outcomes according to the per-protocol analy-
sis. The percentage of patients who had a pri-
mary composite outcome event was 11.4% in the 
restrictive-threshold group, as compared with 
12.5% in the liberal-threshold group (absolute risk 
difference, −1.11 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.93 
to 0.72; odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.07). The

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Data from the per‑protocol population (all the participants who had undergone 
randomization and who underwent surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, except for patients who had a protocol adher‑
ence of less than 90%, patients who were withdrawn from the trial by the treating physician at any time, and patients 
who withdrew consent) are presented here. Details on additional baseline characteristics of the per‑protocol population 
and baseline characteristics of the intention‑to‑treat population are provided in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, in the Sup‑
plementary Appendix. The restrictive transfusion threshold was less than 7.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively and postopera‑
tively, and the liberal transfusion threshold was less than 9.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively or postoperatively in the inten‑
sive care unit (ICU) or less than 8.5 g per deciliter on the non‑ICU ward. There were no significant differences between the 
two groups in any of the baseline characteristics shown. Data on the preoperative hemoglobin concentration were missing 
for one patient in the restrictive‑threshold group and for two in the liberal‑threshold group; and data on the duration of 
cardiopulmonary bypass were missing for three and two, respectively. CABG denotes coronary‑artery bypass graft.
†  
Data on the body‑mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) were missing for 
one patient in the liberal‑threshold group.
‡  
The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) I provides an estimate of the risk of death 
among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The lowest risk is denoted by a score of 0, and the highest risk by a score 
of 47; a EuroSCORE I of 6 is predictive of increased risk. Data were missing for two patients in the restrictive‑threshold 
group and for three in the liberal‑threshold group.
§  
Left ventricular function was defined according to the following categories: good (left ventricular ejection fraction, 
≥51%), moderately reduced (31 to 50%), poor (21 to 30%), and very poor (≤20%).
¶  
Renal function was defined according to the following categories: normal (creatinine clearance, >85 ml per minute), 
moderately impaired (50 to 85 ml per minute), severely impaired (<50 ml per minute), and use of dialysis (regardless 
of creatinine clearance).

risk difference was within our noninferiority mar-
gin of 3 percentage points (P<0.001 for noninfe-
riority). The modified intention-to-treat analysis 
confirmed the noninferiority of the restrictive 
transfusion threshold to the liberal transfusion 
threshold (12.3% in the restrictive-threshold group 
vs. 12.9% in the liberal-threshold group; absolute 
risk difference, −0.60 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−2.38 to 1.27; odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81 to 
1.12). There were no significant differences be-
tween the treatment groups with regard to the 
individual components of the composite outcome 
in either the per-protocol analysis or the modified 
intention-to-treat analysis (Table 3, and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Mortality was 3.0% in the restrictive-threshold 
group and 3.6% in the liberal-threshold group 
(absolute risk difference, −0.53 percentage points; 
95% CI, −1.54 to 0.47; odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.62 to 1.16). The causes of death are listed in 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Approximately 40% of the patients had a pro-
longed low-output state after surgery (40.9% in 
the restrictive-threshold group and 40.6% in the 
liberal-threshold group; odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 
0.90 to 1.14) (Table 3). The median duration of 
mechanical ventilation was 0.38 days (interquartile 
range, 0.22 to 0.75) in the restrictive-threshold 
group and 0.36 days (interquartile range, 0.22 to 
0.71) in the liberal-threshold group (Table 3). The 
median length of stay in the ICU was 2.1 days 
(interquartile range, 1.0 to 4.0) in the restrictive-
threshold group and 1.9 days (interquartile range, 
1.0 to 3.9) in the liberal-threshold group, and the 
median hospital stay was 8.0 days (interquartile 
range, 7.0 to 13.0) and 8.0 days (interquartile 
range, 7.0 to 12.0), respectively. The rates of all the 
other outcomes were similar in the two groups 
(Table 3).
Subgroup analyses did not show a significant 
interaction with treatment, except with regard to 
age. The restrictive transfusion strategy was as-
sociated with a lower risk of the composite out-
come than the liberal strategy among patients 
75 years of age or older (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 
0.54 to 0.89) but not among younger patients 
(odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.50; P 
= 
0.004 
for interaction) (Fig. 2). This effect was consistent 
in an analysis according to decades of age (begin-
ning at age <45 years) or with age as a continuous 
variable with the use of restricted spline model-
ing (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

sion to control for age, sex, status with respect

gery, and statuses with respect to preoperative re-
nal function, anemia, and pulmonary disease were 
consistent with the primary analyses (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Additional sensi-
tivity analyses that included patients who had 
higher or lower adherence levels or that excluded 
patients who had a protocol suspension, who 
never received a red-cell transfusion, or whose 
hemoglobin concentration was never measured 
below 9.5 g per deciliter also yielded results that 
were consistent with those of the primary outcome 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).

noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy with 
regard to the composite primary outcome of death 
from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
new-onset renal failure with dialysis. This find-
ing was consistent in both the per-protocol and 
modified intention-to-treat analyses as well across 
subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Fewer pa-
tients in the restrictive-threshold group than in 
the liberal-threshold group received a red-cell 
transfusion, and patients in the restrictive-thresh-
old group had fewer units of allogeneic red cells 
transfused.
Clinicians have been adopting restrictive trans-
fusion strategies in cardiac surgery with increas-
ing frequency, largely on the basis of the known 
risks of blood transfusions and of observational 
studies linking transfusion with increased mor-
tality and major morbidity.5,6,26,27 However, there 
has been some discrepancy between randomized 
trials on the one hand and observational studies 
on the other hand.28,29 The Transfusion Indica-

Red-Cell Transfusion for Cardiac Surgery
than with a liberal threshold, aroused concerns 
within the medical community over the adoption 
of a restrictive transfusion strategy.30 Patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery have borderline car-
diovascular reserve and are exposed to intraop-
erative hemodilution, which decreases the hemo-
globin concentration, thus potentially increasing 
the risk of anemia-induced tissue hypoxia.20 How-
ever, randomization in the TITRe2 trial did not 
occur until the postoperative period, and mor-
tality was a secondary outcome.30 The TRICS III 
trial provides compelling evidence that a restric-
tive transfusion strategy is as effective and safe as 
a liberal strategy in patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery.
Our findings are consistent with those observed 
in other fields of medicine. Restrictive transfusion 
strategies have been shown to be noninferior to 
liberal strategies in patients in the ICU,31,32 patients 
having hip surgery,28 and patients with gastroin-
testinal bleeding.33 A meta-analysis involving 
patients undergoing noncardiac surgery showed

The solid gray vertical line indicates the overall treatment estimate for the primary outcome in the primary analysis cohort (per‑protocol 
population), and the dashed lines the 95% confidence interval. The size of the circles is proportional to the statistical precision of the 
estimates. An arrow indicates that the 95% confidence interval is outside the range shown. Data were missing for two patients in the re‑
strictive‑threshold group and for one in the liberal‑threshold group. To convert the values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply 
by 88.4. Chronic pulmonary disease was defined as the long‑term use of bronchodilators or glucocorticoids for lung disease. Left ven‑
tricular function was defined according to the following categories: good (left ventricular ejection fraction, ≥51%), moderately reduced 
(31 to 50%), poor (21 to 30%), and very poor (≤20%). CABG denotes coronary‑artery bypass grafting.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
similar conclusions.34 Uncertainty remains regard-
ing appropriate transfusion thresholds in patients 
with acute coronary artery disease,21,35 and a mul-
ticenter trial assessing transfusion thresholds in 
patients with acute coronary syndromes is cur-
rently ongoing (Myocardial Ischemia and Trans-
fusion [MINT] trial, NCT02981407).
The TRICS III trial has limitations. Blinding 
is not feasible in a transfusion study; the lack 
of blinding could introduce bias in outcome 
detection and reporting. As has occurred in 
similar studies, the between-group difference 
in the hemoglobin concentration was lower 
than the difference in the triggers.30,36,37 This 
situation could have been related to trial de-
sign, patients not reaching the specified thresh-
old, protocol nonadherence, or an imbalance in 
protocol suspensions that may have minimized 
any potential differences between groups. The 
trial was designed to be pragmatic and reflec-
tive of standard practice in order to enhance its 
generalizability, but it did not include low-risk 
patients. Similarly, this trial does not answer 
the question of whether even lower transfusion 
thresholds might also be as safe as the thresh-
olds used in this trial, nor did it specifically 
test the efficacy of transfusion. The trial design 
and unadjusted confidence intervals also do not 
allow us to draw definitive conclusions about 
the noninferiority of the restrictive strategy 
with regard to any of the secondary outcomes. 
Finally, we found an interaction with age that 
challenges current beliefs and that may be con-
sidered to be hypothesis-generating; at a mini-
mum, it highlights that a restrictive transfusion 
strategy appears to be safe in elderly patients.
In conclusion, this trial showed that a restric-
tive red-cell transfusion strategy (hemoglobin 
threshold of <7.5 g per deciliter) was noninferior 
to a liberal strategy (hemoglobin threshold of 
<9.5 g per deciliter in the operating room or ICU 
and <8.5 g per deciliter on the non-ICU ward) with 
regard to death and major disability (including 
myocardial infarction, stroke, and new-onset re-
nal failure with dialysis) among patients under-
going cardiac surgery who had a moderate-to-
high risk of death. These outcomes were achieved 
with fewer units of blood being transfused.
