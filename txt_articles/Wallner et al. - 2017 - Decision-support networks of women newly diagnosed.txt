BACKGROUND: Little is known about the size and characteristics of the decision-support networks of women newly diagnosed with
breast cancer and whether their involvement improves breast cancer treatment decisions. METHODS: A population-based sample of
patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and 2015, as reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiol-
ogy, and End Results registries, were surveyed approximately 7 months after diagnosis (N 5 2502; response rate, 68%). Network size
was estimated by asking women to list up to 3 of the most important decision-support persons (DSPs) who helped them with locore-
gional therapy decisions. Decision deliberation was measured using 4 items assessing the degree to which patients thought through
the decision, with higher scores reflecting more deliberative breast cancer treatment decisions. The size of the network (range, 0-3 or
more) was compared across patient-level characteristics, and adjusted mean deliberation scores were estimated across levels of net-
work size using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Of the 2502 women included in this analysis, 51% reported having 3 or more
DSPs, 20% reported 2, 18% reported 1, and 11% reported not having any DSPs. Married/partnered women, those younger than 45
years, and black women all were more likely to report larger network sizes (all P <.001). Larger support networks were associated
with more deliberative surgical treatment decisions (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most women engaged multiple DSPs in their treatment
decision making, and involving more DSPs was associated with more deliberative treatment decisions. Future initiatives to improve
treatment decision making among women with breast cancer should acknowledge and engage informal DSPs. Cancer 2017;123:3895-

INTRODUCTION
Patient-centered care supports engaging patients to make decisions that are both informed and concordant with values
and preferences. This can be challenging in breast cancer because of the complexity and number of decisions faced by
newly diagnosed patients. To help facilitate decision making, women often seek guidance from multiple source, including
family and friends.1-6 although many studies have examined the roles played by family and friends in caring for patients
with cancer,7-9 there is surprisingly little research on the specific contribution of informal supporters to the decision-
making process. Indeed, most women diagnosed with breast cancer have an informal support person in the room with
them during the first encounter with a surgeon. Our prior work suggests that partners positively appraised their participa-
tion in these treatment decisions,10 and a recent study indicated that both patients and caregivers believed family involve-
ment was helpful in their cancer treatment decision making.11 However, who patients involve in these decisions, the

 extent to which they are involved, and whether or not
their participation influences the quality of these treat-
ment decisions remains largely unknown.
In addition, very little is known about the decision-
support networks themselves and how they may vary for
different patient groups. For instance, prior research sug-
gests that the involvement and influence of informal
decision-support persons (DSPs) may vary by race/ethnic-
ity,3,10 but much of the research has been limited by small
sample sizes with insufficient racial/ethnic diversity and
by the inclusion of only spouses/partners.4-6 Although cli-
nicians have long been recommending that patients bring
someone with them to their appointments, clinicians may
benefit from a better understanding of the size and charac-
teristics of the networks on which patients rely during
their decision making. Such understanding may help cli-
nicians to better incorporate DSPs into treatment discus-
sions and would help guide the development of decision
tools that include patients’ informal DSPs, with the goal
of improving patient-centered care. In particular, estab-
lishing whether informal decision-support networks con-
tribute to greater deliberation over treatment options
would allow clinicians to provide more evidence-based
recommendations that patients use their network of infor-
mal supporters when making their breast cancer treatment
decisions.
To fill this gap in research on the process of breast
cancer treatment decision making, we conducted a study
to characterize the size and variation of informal decision-
support networks for women newly diagnosed with early
stage breast cancer. We further sought to determine
whether network size was associated with patient charac-
teristics and patients’ appraisal of their decision-making
process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The Individualized Cancer Care (iCanCare) Study is a
large, population-based survey study of women with
breast cancer. We identified and accrued 3930 women,
ages 20 to 79 years, with newly diagnosed, early stage
breast cancer (stages 0-II) as reported to the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries of
Georgia and Los Angeles County in 2014 and 2015.
Patients were ineligible if they had stage III or IV disease,
had tumors larger than 5 cm, or could not complete a
questionnaire in English or Spanish (N 5 258). Of the
remaining 3672 eligible women who were mailed surveys,
2502 completed the survey (response rate, 68%) and are
included in this analysis.
Patients were identified by rapid case ascertainment
from surgical pathology reports. Surveys were mailed
approximately 2 months after surgery (the median time
from diagnosis to survey completion was 7 months). We
provided a $20 cash incentive and, as in prior work,12-14
used a modified Dillman approach to encourage patient
recruitment.15 This approach allows for a flexible mode of
respondent follow-up, which included postcard and tele-
phone reminders with the option to complete the survey
during a phone interview in either Spanish or English. All
materials were sent in English and Spanish to those with
Spanish surnames.3,13 Survey responses were then merged
with clinical data provided by the SEER registries. The
study was approved by the University of Michigan Institu-
tional Review Board and the state and institutional review
boards of the SEER registries.
Measures
Questionnaire content was developed based on a concep-
tual framework, which hypothesized variability in the size
and
influence
of
decision-support
networks
across
patient-level characteristics.1-3 We used standard techni-
ques to assess content validity, including expert reviews,
cognitive pretesting, and pilot studies, in selected clinic
populations. Respondents were queried about the num-
ber, influence, and importance of DSPs using adapted
measures developed and validated to identify disease man-
agement support for patients with chronic diseases16,17
(see online supporting information: Measures From the
Patient Survey).
Measuring Decision-Support Networks
To our knowledge, this is the first study to ask patients to
report about specific individuals involved in their cancer
treatment decision making. We used a unique methodol-
ogy in which patients were asked: 1) to indicate up to 3
specific decision-support individuals (using initials only
to avoid identification), 2) to indicate each person’s rela-
tionship to them (eg, partner, daughter, friend), and 3) to
rate the importance of, and satisfaction with, each per-
son’s involvement in treatment decision making.
Size of the Decision-Support Network
The decision-support network size was determined by
assessing the number of individuals indicated by each
patient, ranging from 0 to 3 or more. Although it was
rare, respondents who did not answer the decision-
support
questions
entirely
(n 5 256;

 categorized as having a decision-support network size of
zero. This categorization was based on prior work and
responses to other questions supporting the justification
that patients likely did not answer because they did not
have a person to name. However, to confirm our findings,
we also performed the analyses with these respondents
excluded, which yielded very similar results.
Patient Satisfaction With and Importance of
DSPs
For each individual listed, respondents reported on how
important the opinion of each DSP was in treatment deci-
sion making and how satisfied they were with the level of
involvement (each on a 5-point scale, from “not at all” to
“very”). Overall mean scores (across all DSPs reported by
each patient) were then estimated for both importance
and satisfaction and were categorized into high (scores of
4 or greater) versus low/moderate (scores less than 4). We
chose this cutoff based on prior research3,10 and our desire
to assess the highest levels of patient-reported involvement
and satisfaction.
Patient-Reported Network Involvement
Respondents also were asked how often their DSP(s)
attended their appointments, took notes during appoint-
ments, talked to them about their treatment options, and
shared information with them from other sources about
their treatment options (on 5-point scales, from “not at
all” to “often”), as we have done in prior studies.3 Overall
mean scores were then estimated for each item and catego-
rized into often/always (scores of 4 greater) versus never/
rarely (score less than 4).
Patient Appraisal of Decision Making
We used a measure of “treatment decision deliberation”
using a 5-item scale derived from measures of public
deliberation adapted for cancer treatment-related deci-
sions.18-20 These items assessed the extent to which a
patient weighed the pros and cons, talked to other family
members and friends, talked to other patients with breast
cancer, and thought through and spent time thinking
about the decision (on 5-point Likert-type scales, from
“not at all” to “very much”). An overall deliberation score
was created using the mean of the responses to the 5 items
(range, 1-5) (Cronbach a 5 .85), with higher scores repre-
senting more deliberation.
Patient Characteristics
Survey items assessed demographics, including age, edu-
cational attainment (high school graduate or less, some
college, or college degree or more), insurance status
(private, Medicaid/Medicare/Veterans Administration, or
none/missing), and the number of comorbid health con-
ditions (0, 1 or more). The level of acculturation among
Latinas was assessed using the Short Acculturation Scale
for Hispanics, as done in our prior studies.21 We also
asked patients to report their treatment, as done in prior
work,12 including primary surgical treatment modality
(lumpectomy, unilateral mastectomy, bilateral mastec-
tomy), receipt of chemotherapy (yes/no), and receipt of
endocrine therapy (yes/no). Breast cancer stage (0, I, II)
was obtained from the SEER record.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses incorporated weights to account for
differential probabilities of sample selection across patient
subgroups and nonresponse. Weighting assures that sam-
ple distributions resemble those of the target population
and reduces the potential bias because of nonresponse.22
The overall distributions of network characteristics (size,
relationship), DSP involvement, and patient-reported sat-
isfaction with and influence of the DSP were estimated.
The distributions of network size across levels of patient
demographic and clinical characteristics were compared
using Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Because of the antici-
pated inherent association between network size and mar-
ital status, we then estimated the associations between
patient factors (age, race/acculturation) and network size,
stratified by marital status, and compared them using
Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Multivariable linear regression
was used to estimate the adjusted mean deliberation scores
for each level of network size, adjusting for age, race/accul-
turation, insurance, partner status, comorbidity, surgical
treatment, and stage. All analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with 2-sided
tests, and P values < .05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Network Size
Table 1 displays the characteristics of the sample of 2502
women both overall and by level of informal decision-
support network size. More than one-half of the women
(51%) listed 3 DSPs during their treatment decision mak-
ing, 20% listed 2 DSPs, 19% listed 1 DSP, and 10% had
a network size of zero. Network size decreased with
increasing age (P < .001). Variation in network size also
existed across race/acculturation (P < .001). Both African
American and Latina women reported larger network sizes
compared with white women, because 58.3% of African
American women and 52.3% and 56.4% of high-

 acculturated and low-acculturated Latina women reported
a network size of 3 or more, compared with 48% of white
women (P < .001). Marital status, as expected, was posi-
tively associated with network size: Among women who
were partnered/married, 51.6% reported a network size of
3 or greater compared with 49.3% of women who were
not married or partnered (P < .001) (Table 1).
Figure 1 displays the size of decision-support net-
works across age and race, stratified by partner status.
Very little heterogeneity was observed in the association
between age and network size across partner status.
Among both partnered and nonpartnered women, a
greater proportion of younger women reported a larger
network size compared with older women, although these
associations did not reach statistical significance (not part-
nered, P 5 .06; partnered, P 5 .10) (Fig. 1A,B).
The association between race/acculturation and net-
work size varied noticeably across partner status. Among
women who were partnered, race/acculturation was sig-
nificantly associated with network size (P < .001), because
63% of black women, 56% of high-acculturated Latina
women, 60% of low-acculturated Latina women, and
48% of white women reported a network size of 3 or
more (Fig. 1D); however, this association was mitigated
among women who were not partnered (P 5 .80)
(Fig. 1C).

all and stratified by married/partnered status. Of the

 were children, followed by partners/spouses (21.2%),
friends/other (18.8%), siblings (11.3%), other family
members (7.4%), and parents (6.1%). Partnered/married
women most often reported their partner as their main
DSP (37.9%), whereas nonpartnered/unmarried women
most often reported children as their main DSP (38.4%).
In addition, women who were not partnered or married
more often reported siblings (15.5%) or friends (22.3%)
as their DSPs compared with partnered/married women
(P < .001).
Satisfaction With and Involvement of Networks
Overall, women reported that their DSPs participated in
key activities related to their decision making. The
majority of women reported that their DSPs often/
always talked to them about their treatment options
(74.2%) and frequently attended their appointments
(73.3%), and these activities were more common among
partnered women compared with nonpartnered women
(P < .001 for both). However, women overall were less
likely to report that their DSPs had taken notes (50.5%)
or shared treatment information with them from other
sources (56.8%).
The majority of women were highly satisfied with
their DSP being involved in their treatment decisions
(76.5%) and greater than two-thirds (68.6%) believed
that their DSP was very important in their treatment deci-
sion making. However, both satisfaction and importance
were significantly different across partner status; partnered
women were more likely to be highly satisfied and per-
ceive that their DSP was of high importance compared
with nonpartnered women (P < .001 for both). In addi-
tion, younger women, black women, Latina women, and
those with less education were more likely to perceive that
their DSP was highly important (results not shown)
(Table 2).
Association With Decision Deliberation
There was a significant association between network size
and treatment deliberation scores after adjustment for
age, race, insurance, partner status, comorbidity, SEER
stage, and surgical treatment. Mean treatment delibera-
tion scores were lowest among women who had a network
size of zero (mean deliberation score, 3.04) and were high-
est among those with a network size of 3 or more (mean
deliberation score, 3.59; P < .001) (Fig. 2).
Figure 1. The distribution of network size according to partner status is illustrated by age among (A) nonpartnered women

 DISCUSSION
In this study, for which we used a unique methodology to
understand how family and friends contribute to the treat-
ment decisions made by patients with breast cancer, most
reported having a large, informal decision-support net-
work and also believed that their supporters were both
important and influential. Women with larger networks
also reported more deliberative surgical treatment deci-
sions, which is a promising outcome, particularly at a time
when there is concern that patients may be rushing into
making breast cancer treatment decisions.23-25 Our results
suggest that engaging DSPs in the treatment decision pro-
cess may be an important mechanism for slowing these
decisions down, potentially allowing patients to more
deeply consider them.

 Our findings confirm prior work demonstrating
that most women do not make their breast cancer treat-
ment decisions on their own and, instead, heavily involve
other support people in these emotional and difficult deci-
sions.1-6,11,26 Our study extends this work by revealing
that the decision-support network for patients with newly
diagnosed breast cancer is larger than previously under-
stood. In fact, we observed that the majority of patients
with breast cancer reported having large networks, which
we defined in this study as having 3 or more informal
DSPs, and we further discovered that these supporters
often included family members and friends beyond just
partners or spouses. In our large sample of nonmarried/
nonpartnered women—which have not previously been
well represented in studies of informal support—we
observed that children and friends were commonly con-
sidered key DSPs. Yet, we also demonstrated that, even
among married/partnered women, children and friends
played an important DSP role. These results underscore
the need to recognize the significant impact of informal
DSPs—partners, children, friends—in the treatment
decision-making process and choices of patients with
breast cancer.
We did observe some variation in network size
among different patient subgroups, as expected, with
younger and minority women indicating that they had
larger decision-support networks. Prior research suggests
that racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to rely on
family for emotional/spiritual support and caregiving
functions,1,27 but the current study is 1 of the first to dem-
onstrate that this is also the case specifically for decision
support. In addition, although African American women
tended to be partnered/married at lower rates in our sam-
ple, they still had large networks that supported their deci-
sion
making.
Likewise,
Latina
women
with
low
acculturation also reported larger network sizes, under-
scoring that, for minorities who have potential language
barriers that make communication with their physicians
more challenging,13,14 the inclusion of DSPs offers
another opportunity to educate patients about their treat-
ment options. Efforts by clinicians to engage with the
DSPs of minority women and to recognize that women
often have DSPs beyond their spouses or partners may be
beneficial in ensuring that information is communicated
in a culturally sensitive and understandable manner.
Our results also suggest that informal DSPs are
actively engaged with patients throughout their treatment
decision making and that there may be a real benefit to
having a decision-support network during this process. In
addition to the strong association between the number of
supporters and more treatment deliberation, the majority
of women in this sample also reported that they were
highly satisfied with their DSP’s level of involvement and
believed the DPS played an important role in their treat-
ment decision making. Prior work from Shin and col-
leagues also suggests that patients and caregivers value
family involvement in cancer treatment decision mak-
ing.11,26 Our findings that the majority of women also
reported having DSPs who often attended their appoint-
ments, took notes, discussed their treatment options, and
shared information with them from other sources suggests
that support networks are also highly involved throughout
the decision process. This involvement may be particu-
larly helpful around the time of diagnosis, when patients
are struggling to absorb information while simultaneously
coping with their cancer diagnosis. It also suggests that
there may be a benefit to addressing decision supporters
within structured tools, or decision aids, designed to
improve treatment decision making. Although there are
many decision aids available for patients with breast can-
cer, none of them currently address the role of informal
supporters in helping women navigate these treatment
decisions, and none directly engage supporters. Therefore,
future decision aids and other interventions focused on
improving breast cancer decision making should address
the role of the DSP more directly.
Taken together, the results from this study suggest
that the involvement of informal supporters in breast can-
cer treatment decisions provides an opportunity for clini-
cians to better incorporate them into these treatment
decisions. Clinicians should be aware that women who
include more informal supporters in their treatment deci-
sions may take longer to fully weigh treatment options
and require additional time to make value-concordant
and preference-concordant decisions. Therefore, clini-
cians might discuss with patients the availability of infor-
mal DSPs and encourage their involvement early in the
treatment consultation process. Clinicians should also
anticipate delivering treatment information to at least 1
person beyond the patient and should also realize that,
among married/partnered women, the spouse/partner is
not necessarily the family member that the patient consid-
ers to be her informal decision-support person. Equally
important, however, is recognizing that women who do
not have an informal support person—as reported by
10% of patients in our sample, including a small propor-
tion of women who were married/partnered—may be vul-
nerable to lower quality treatment decisions and thus may
require additional decisional support.

 Although the current study was a large, population-
based survey in a diverse sample with a high survey
response rate, there are some potential limitations that
merit consideration. This was a cross-sectional survey;
therefore, inferences regarding causality are limited. We
relied on patient report of their DSPs, including their
influence and importance, which may be subject to recall
bias. However, we captured this information on average
only 2 months after surgery, thus minimizing the poten-
tial for this bias. We only asked women to identify up to 3
DSPs, thus our estimates about the size of the decision-
support networks are most likely conservative. Finally,
this sample only included women wo received treatment
for breast cancer in Georgia and Los Angeles; therefore,
the generalizability of our findings may be limited.
CONCLUSIONS
Although prior research on breast cancer treatment deci-
sion making has tended to focus on the patient, our study
is 1 of the largest to date that highlights the need to con-
sider patients in the context of their informal decision-
support networks. Patients turn to others, including
spouses, children, and friends, to help support them in
these difficult and complicated decisions, and these others
are actively involved in helping patients make their deci-
sions. The effectiveness of future initiatives to improve
treatment decision making among patients with breast
cancer, including decision-support tools, may be limited
if they do not acknowledge and engage informal decision
supporters.
