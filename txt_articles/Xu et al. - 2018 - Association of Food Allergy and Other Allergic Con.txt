Abstract
IMPORTANCE The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in US children has increased
during the past decades. Immunologic dysfunction has recently emerged as a factor associated with
ASD. Although children with ASD are more likely to have gastrointestinal disorders, little is known
about the association between food allergy and ASD.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of food allergy and other allergic conditions with ASD in US
children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based, cross-sectional study used data
from the National Health Interview Survey collected between 1997 and 2016. The data analysis was
performed in 2018. All eligible children aged 3 to 17 years were included. Food allergy, respiratory
allergy, and skin allergy were defined based on an affirmative response in the questionnaire by a
parent or guardian.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reported ASD diagnosed by a physician or other health
professional.
RESULTS This analysis included 199 520 children (unweighted mean [SD] age, 10.21 [4.41] years;
102 690 boys [51.47%]; 55 476 Hispanic [27.80%], 97 200 non-Hispanic white [48.72%], 30 760
non-Hispanic black [15.42%], and 16 084 non-Hispanic other race [8.06%]). Among them, 8734
(weighted prevalence, 4.31%) had food allergy, 24 555 (12.15%) had respiratory allergy, and 19 399
(9.91%) had skin allergy. A diagnosis of ASD was reported in 1868 children (0.95%). The weighted
prevalence of reported food, respiratory, and skin allergies was higher in children with ASD (11.25%,
18.73%, and 16.81%, respectively) compared with children without ASD (4.25%, 12.08%, and 9.84%,
respectively). In analyses adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family highest education level, family
income level, geographical region, and mutual adjustment for other allergic conditions, the
associations between allergic conditions and ASD remained significant. The odds ratio (OR) of ASD
increased in association with food allergy (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.87-2.81), respiratory allergy (OR, 1.28;
95% CI, 1.10-1.50), and skin allergy (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.28-1.77) when comparing children with these
conditions and those without.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a nationally representative sample of US children, a significant
and positive association of common allergic conditions, in particular food allergy, with ASD was
found. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the causality and underlying mechanisms.

 Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits
in social interaction, language, and communication, as well as the presence of restricted repetitive
behaviors. The prevalence of ASD in US children has steadily increased over the past decades.1-4 The
Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network reported that the estimated prevalence
of ASD increased from 0.67% in 2000 to 1.46% in 2012.1 A recent study using data from the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) found that the prevalence of ASD in US children aged 3 to 17 years
was 2.24% in 2014, 2.41% in 2015, and 2.76% in 2016.3 A similar upward trend in ASD prevalence has
been observed in many other developed and developing countries worldwide.5 The etiology of ASD
involves both genetic and environmental risk factors,5,6 and it is estimated that up to 40% to 50% of
variance in ASD liability might be attributed to environmental risk factors.7
Immunologic dysfunction is a potential link between environmental risk factors and ASD.8-10
Symptoms of immune function abnormalities, such as frequent infections and increased prevalence
of autoimmune conditions, were frequently reported among children with ASD.5,6,11 Moreover,
maternal infection, inflammatory cytokines, and autoimmune diseases during pregnancy were also
associated with ASD in children in some studies.5 Available evidence has shown that early-life
immune activation can adversely influence certain neurodevelopmental processes, such as neuron
growth, through multiple pathways, including altered expression of cytokines and chemokines.12
Allergic conditions, including respiratory allergy, skin allergy, and food allergy, are common
medical conditions of immunologic dysfunction in children.13 Among US children, while there was no
significant change in respiratory allergy prevalence from 1997 to 2011, the prevalence of food and
skin allergies has increased steadily.13 A few previous studies have examined the association between
allergic conditions and ASD. However, their results have been inconsistent and inconclusive, and
most of those studies focused on respiratory allergy and skin allergy.14,15
Animal studies have reported that food allergy in mice can induce autistic-like behavioral
changes, including reduced social interaction, increased repetitive behavior, and impaired spatial
memory.16,17 Although gastrointestinal disorders are more common in children with ASD than those
with typical development,18 epidemiologic evidence for the association between food allergy and
ASD in humans is sparse.11 Limited and suggestive evidence indicates that food allergy is related to
increased irritability and poorer functional outcomes in ASD19 and that exclusion of hyperallergenic
foods might improve behavior in children with ASD.20,21 Therefore, in this study, we analyzed
nationally representative data to examine the associations of food allergy and other allergic
conditions with ASD in US children. We hypothesized that children with food allergy may have a
higher risk for ASD than children without food allergy.
Methods
This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.22
Study Population
The NHIS is a continuous, ongoing, nationally representative annual health survey in the United
States.23,24 It is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1957, the NHIS has become the principal source of information
on health conditions in the US population.25 The NHIS is a survey of a nationally representative
sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, with survey information collected via an
in-person household interview. It uses a multistage probability sample design. A detailed description
of the survey design, methods, and sample weights in the NHIS was published elsewhere.23,24
Annual sample size of the NHIS is about 35 000 households containing about 87 500 persons. In the
NHIS from 1997 to 2016, the total household response rate ranged from 67.9% to 91.8%, and the

 conditional response rate for the sample child component ranged from 85.6% to 93.3%. The NHIS
was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the NCHS and the US Office of Management
and Budget. All respondents provided oral informed consent prior to participation. Data from NHIS
are released annually and are publicly available online. The University of Iowa institutional review
board determined that the current study was exempt based on the use of deidentified data.
Ascertainment of Variables
The NHIS collected data on a broad range of health topics for all household members, including
children. For each interviewed family in the household, 1 sample child (if any children aged �17 years
were present) was randomly selected by the field representative’
s computer.24 Detailed health-
related information, including information on physical and mental health, was collected for the
sample child. This information was provided by an adult, usually a parent, who was knowledgeable
about the child’
s health.
We included all the children aged 3 to 17 years in the NHIS whose information about allergic
conditions and ASD was available. Allergic conditions were defined based on an affirmative response
to the following questions13: during the past 12 months, has your child had (1) any kind of food or
digestive allergy; (2) any kind of respiratory allergy; (3) eczema or any kind of skin allergy? Autism
spectrum disorder was defined based on an affirmative response to a question asking whether the
sample child received a diagnosis of ASD from a physician or other health professional.2,3 From 1997
to 2013, this question was asked as part of a 10-condition checklist. In 2014 onward, the question
became a stand-alone item and the wording was revised to name specific conditions, including
autism, Asperger disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, and ASD.2 Over the 20-year period
from 1997 to 2016, 99.82% of participants responded to the question about food allergy; 99.71%,
respiratory allergy; 99.86%, skin allergy; and 99.94%, ASD.
Demographic data, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, family income, and geographic
region, were collected using a standardized questionnaire during the interview. Race and Hispanic
ethnicity were self-reported and classified based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget
Standards. Family highest education level was classified into less than high school, high school, and
college or higher. Family income levels were classified according to the ratio of family income to
federal poverty level (<1.0, 1.0-1.9, 2.0-3.9, and �4.0).
Statistical Analysis
We used survey weights, strata, and primary sampling units created by the NCHS and provided along
with the NHIS data in all the analyses, unless otherwise specified, so that the results are nationally
representative of the US population. Briefly, survey weights used 4 weighting factors: inverse of the
probability of selection, household nonresponse adjustment, first-stage ratio adjustment, and
second-stage ratio adjustment.
Comparisons of characteristics among children with and without ASD were performed using a t
test for continuous variables and a χ2 test for categorical variables. We estimated the odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of ASD according to the presence of allergic conditions using
multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family highest education level,
ratio of family income to federal poverty level, and geographic region. These factors are known to
be associated with both allergic conditions and ASD. Because children with food allergy are more
likely to have asthma and other allergies compared with children without food allergies,26 we
performed a mutual adjustment for other allergic conditions.
To evaluate effect modification, we performed subgroup analyses according to age (3-11 or 12-17
years), sex (boys or girls), and race/ethnicity (white or nonwhite). Interactions between these factors
and allergic conditions were tested by adding their multiplicative interaction terms in the
multivariable models.
All data analyses were conducted using survey procedures of SAS statistical software version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided value of P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

race/ethnicity, family highest education level, family income level, and geographical region, the OR
of ASD was more than doubled (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 2.26-3.28; P < .001) among children with food
allergy compared with those without food allergy. The magnitude of association with ASD was lower
for respiratory allergy and skin allergy, but the associations were still statistically significant, with an
OR of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.32-1.78; P < .001) for respiratory allergy and an OR of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.55-2.09;

significant after mutual adjustment for other allergic conditions, with ORs of 2.29 (95% CI, 1.87-2.81)
for food allergy, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.10-1.50) for respiratory allergy, and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.28-1.77) for skin
allergy (Table 2). The adjusted OR of ASD was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62-2.04; P < .001) among children with

In subgroup analyses, the association between food allergy and ASD was significant in all
subgroups by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (Table 3). Respiratory allergy was not significantly
associated with ASD in children aged 3 to 11 years, girls, or white children (Table 3). Skin allergy was
not significantly associated with ASD in children aged 12 to 17 years or girls (Table 3). There was a
significant interaction between race/ethnicity and respiratory allergy, with a stronger association in

(eTable in the Supplement).
Discussion
In a nationally representative sample of US children, we found a significant and positive association
of food allergy, respiratory allergy, and skin allergy with ASD. The association persisted after
adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic variables and other types of allergic conditions. In
addition, the association between food allergy and ASD was consistent and significant in all age, sex,
and racial/ethnic subgroups.
Little is known about the association between food allergy and ASD. A previous case-control
study among California children in the CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks From Genetics and the
Environment) study suggested that food allergy and sensitivities may be more common in children
with ASD.11 Similar findings on food allergy and ASD were reported in another case-control study in
northern California.27 Previous studies on allergic conditions and ASD have focused mainly on
respiratory allergy and skin allergy. Several, but not all, of those studies reported a positive
association of respiratory allergy (eg, asthma15,28-30) and skin allergy (eg, atopic dermatitis14,31,32)
with ASD. The heterogeneity in previous studies may be partly due to limited sample size and
statistical power.
In this large population-based study, all of these common allergic conditions were significantly
associated with ASD. This indicates a possible presence of shared mechanisms (eg, immunologic
dysfunction8-10) among these allergic conditions in relation to ASD. Indeed, immunological studies
found that IgA, IgG, IgM, and total IgE were increased in children with ASD,33 and imbalance in T-cell
subsets (low numbers of TH1-type interferon-γ and IL-2 positive cells) was also observed.34 Previous
studies have shown increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the postmortem brains of
patients with ASD, and increased autoantibody production has also been observed.8,35-39 It is
possible that the immunologic disruptions may have processes beginning early in life, which then
influence brain development and social functioning, leading to the development of ASD. In addition,
there may also be shared genetic and nongenetic risk factors influencing both allergy and ASD.
Interestingly, the association between food allergy and ASD appeared stronger and more robust
than the association of respiratory or skin allergy with ASD. The prevalence of both food allergy13 and
ASD2,3 has increased over the past 2 decades. Although the underlying mechanisms for the observed
association between food allergy and ASD remain to be elucidated, the gut-brain-behavior axis could
be one of the potential mechanisms. Previous studies found higher prevalence of gastrointestinal
symptoms among children with ASD.40-42 In addition, parents of autistic children reported more
frequently their children having food allergies.43,44 Food allergy may involve alterations in the gut
microbiome,45 allergic immune activation, and impaired brain function through neuroimmune
interactions, which may finally affect the enteric nervous system and central nervous system leading
to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.16 Of note, our results showed that the associations of
respiratory allergy and skin allergy with ASD differed by population demographic characteristics,
which may help explain the heterogeneous findings reported in previous studies.14,15,28-32
One major strength of this study is the use of nationwide population-based data with a large
sample size and multiracial/multiethnic population. The nationally representative sampling strategy
of the NHIS facilitates generalizing the findings to a broader population. In addition, the NHIS has a
relatively high response rate,25 which reduces the concern of selection bias.
Limitations
There are several limitations in this study. First, both allergic conditions and ASD were ascertained
based on self-reported and retrospectively reported information, which may be subject to recall bias
and misreporting. However, the prevalence of each allergic condition and ASD in this study was
comparable to the numbers in other nationwide studies in similar years.1,4,43 In addition, clinical

 guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend ASD-specific screening at age 18 to 24
months for all US children, which improves the identification of children with suspected ASD
symptoms at a young age. Nonetheless, we could not rule out the possibility that some parents of
children with ASD might overreport allergies in their children and some parents of children without
ASD might underreport allergies in their children. Second, we did not know the onset timing of the
allergic conditions or the timing of ASD diagnosis. Therefore, we cannot establish temporal
relationship and causal inference from the current study. However, experimental evidence supports
the notion that food allergy may increase the risk of ASD.16,17 Large prospective cohort studies
starting from birth or early life are needed to confirm our findings. Third, the NHIS does not have
laboratory data on specific IgE antibodies for the allergic conditions and therefore we were unable to
determine the specific immunologic pathways for the observed associations.
Conclusions
Based on nationally representative data in large cross-sectional surveys, we found a significant and
positive association between common allergic conditions, especially food allergy, and ASD in US
children. These findings warrant confirmation in prospective cohort studies. The underlying
mechanisms for the association of food allergy and other allergic conditions with ASD remain to be
elucidated.
