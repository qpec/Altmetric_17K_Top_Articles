Full-term pregnancies reduce a woman’s long-term breast cancer risk, while abortions have
been shown to have no effect. The precise minimal duration of pregnancy necessary to lower
a woman’s breast cancer risk is, however, unknown. Here we provide evidence which point to
the protective effect of pregnancy on breast cancer risk arising precisely at the 34th preg-
nancy week. Using a cohort of 2.3 million Danish women, we found the reduction in breast
cancer risk was not observed for pregnancies lasting 33 weeks or less, but restricted to those
pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or longer. We further found that parity, socioeconomic status,
and vital status of the child at birth did not explain the association, and also replicated our
finding in data from 1.6 million women in Norway. We suggest that a distinct biological effect
introduced around week 34 of pregnancy holds the key to understand pregnancy-associated
breast cancer protection.

reast cancer is the most common malignant cancer in
women and a major cause of disease burden worldwide1.
Both the number and timing of a woman’s childbirths have
long been known to influence her breast cancer risk2, but how
these factors influence breast cancer etiology is not well under-
stood. Previously, full-term pregnancies in early life (<30 years)
have consistently been associated with a long-term reduced risk of
breast cancer3,4. Conversely, a transient increased breast cancer
risk immediately following full-term pregnancies have been
observed5. Induced abortions and other pregnancies of short
duration have, on the other hand, been shown not to influence
breast cancer risk6,7. We hypothesized that by investigating
pregnancies of intermediate to long duration in early life
(including stillbirths, preterm, and term livebirths) we could
determine the minimal duration of pregnancy associated with a
reduced risk of breast cancer and thereby potentially point to
underlying mechanisms of the protective effect.
Taking advantage of the Danish national registries on child-
births and cancer, we established a nationwide cohort including
2.3 million women with detailed information on reproductive
history from 1978 to 2014, and assessed the association between
the duration of a pregnancy and the long-term risk of breast
cancer. We replicated this analysis in an equivalent Norwegian
cohort of 1.6 million women.
Results
Cohort description and age at pregnancy. The Danish cohort
consisted of 2,311,332 women, with altogether 3,275,559 child-
births. The women were followed for 46,128,328 person-years
(average 20.0 years follow-up per woman) and 61,349 (2.7%)
developed breast cancer. We focused on follow-up from 10 years
or more after pregnancy, to highlight the long-term effect of
pregnancy on breast cancer risk. Table 1 shows number of breast
cancer events and follow-up time according to number of
childbirths, age at first childbirth, and duration of latest
pregnancy.
Figure 1 shows the long-term relative risk (RR) of breast cancer
after first childbirth by age at delivery, adjusted for different
socioeconomic variables. Overall, we found a first childbirth
before 30 years of age to decrease the long-term breast cancer
risk. Further, to investigate the effect of both first and subsequent
childbirths in early age on long-term breast cancer risk, we
estimated the effect of first, second, and third childbirth,
compared with one childbirth less (Supplementary Fig. 1). For
childbirths before 30 years of age, women’s long-term breast
cancer risk was reduced for the first childbirth (on average 5.0%
(95% CI: 2.1% to 7.8%)), the second (on average 6.4% (95% CI:
3.9% to 8.8%)), and the third childbirth (on average 9.4% (95%
CI: 6.4% to 12.2%)). For childbirths at 30 years or later, we did
not observe a consistent, overall reduced long-term breast cancer
risk (first birth: −8.7% (95% CI: −12.8% to −4.8%), second birth:
3.4% (95% CI: 0.7% to 6.0%), third birth: 5.3% (95% CI: 2.7%
to 7.8%)).
Pregnancy duration and breast cancer risk. We speculated
whether the observed reduced long-term breast cancer risk fol-
lowing any birth at an early age varied by pregnancy duration. To
study this, we included information on pregnancy duration.
Figure 2a shows the long-term RR of breast cancer after an early
age childbirth compared with one childbirth less, by pregnancy
duration. We noted a distinctive difference in the cancer risk
associated with pregnancies lasting 34 weeks and longer com-
pared with pregnancies lasting 33 weeks or less. Whereas preg-
nancies 33 weeks or less were not associated with long-term
breast cancer risk (on average 2.3% (95% CI: −10.0% to 13.2%)
risk reduction per birth), pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or longer
were associated with a substantially reduced risk (on average
12.9% (95% CI: 11.4% to 14.3%) risk reduction per birth).
Additionally, to examine the role of breastfeeding, we investigated
the effect of stillbirths, which are not breastfeed, and found that
both live births and stillbirths were associated with reduced breast
cancer risk, but only if delivered at week 34 or later (Table 2).
We replicated the analyses in a similar cohort of 1,635,839
Norwegian women with altogether 2,420,518 pregnancies identi-
fied in the National Registry and the Norwegian Medical Birth
Registry. The women were followed for 35,171,205 person-years,
in which 24,095 developed invasive breast cancer.
Figure 2b illustrates the long-term RR of breast cancer after an
early age childbirth compared with one childbirth less, according
to duration of pregnancy, in the Norwegian cohort. As shown, we
found a pattern identical to the results obtained in the Danish
cohort. In the Norwegian cohort, the average reduction in long-
term breast cancer risk associated with a pregnancy lasting
33 weeks or less were 2.9% (95% CI: −7.7% to 12.6%), whereas
the reduction with pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or more were
14.5% (95% CI: 13.1% to 15.8%).
When we combined the Danish and Norwegian cohorts
(Fig. 2c), the reduction in long-term breast cancer risk associated
with early childbirth was 2.4% (95% CI: −5.6% to 9.7%) for
pregnancies lasting 33 weeks or less and 13.6% (95% CI: 12.6%
to 14.5%) for pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or longer. The reduced
risk of breast cancer for pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or more
could have been modified by the number of previous pregnancies
lasting 33 weeks or less, but the risk reduction was similar for no
previous births <34 weeks, 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5% to 14.5%); one
previous birth <34 weeks, 16.9% (95% CI: 10.2% to 23.1%); or two
or more previous births <34 weeks, 37.7% (95% CI: 7.5%
to 58.1%). Furthermore, to avoid a possible distinct effect of a
woman’s first childbirth on cancer risk, we focused on the effect
of a second, third, or any additional childbirth, among women in
Denmark and Norway (Supplementary Fig. 2), and found that the
reduction in long-term breast cancer risk associated with early
age childbirth was 1.2% (95% CI: −11.2% to 12.4%) for
pregnancies lasting 33 weeks or less and 16.3% (95% CI: 14.9%
to 17.8%) for pregnancies lasting 34 weeks or longer.
We performed additional sensitivity analyses to evaluate the
association between a specific duration of a pregnancy and a
woman’s long-term breast cancer risk (see Supplementary Fig. 3
for effect of relative birthweight and Supplementary Fig. 4 for
effect of induced abortions and childbirths). Adjusting for
individual-level socioeconomic differences, we found no strong
confounding effect of socioeconomic factors on breast cancer risk
in the analysis of pregnancy duration (Supplementary Fig. 5). In
analysis of threshold models, where all risk reduction occur in
pregnancies lasting longer than a specific duration, we further-
more found the best fit of data for a threshold of 34 weeks
duration of pregnancy (Supplementary Fig. 6A). The same
conclusion was reached when allowing the protective effect in
the models to vary by parity and country (Supplementary Fig. 6B
and Supplementary Fig. 6C).
Discussion
The strongest known modifier of a woman’s breast cancer risk is
her reproductive history. Thus, early age full-term pregnancies
and an increasing number of childbirths3,4 result in a lowered
breast cancer risk, whereas abortions do not influence breast
cancer risk6,7. Previous studies on preterm birth and breast cancer
risk have nevertheless not had statistical power to show any
specific effect of pregnancy duration on breast cancer risk8–11. In
the present study, we provide evidence that the protection

 introduced by a pregnancy takes place around a specific preg-
nancy week. Using Danish nationwide registers, we found the
minimal pregnancy length associated with a substantial reduced
risk of long-term breast cancer to be 34 weeks, whereas a preg-
nancy length of 33 weeks or less did not confer a reduction in
risk. The exact same result was obtained in a Norwegian repli-
cation cohort based on similar nationwide register data.
It has been hypothesized that a woman’s first pregnancy has a
special influence on mammary tissue structural remodeling12,
and that this might explain the reduced risk of breast cancer later
in life. It has specifically been suggested that pregnancy-induced
differentiation of breast cells at this first pregnancy might make
them less sensitive to influences from external carcinogenic sti-
muli13. However, we found that additional childbirths further
reduce breast cancer risk and that the effect observed by these
additional births is at a similar level as observed for the first birth.
In addition, the specific effect of a pregnancy lasting 34 weeks or
longer on later breast cancer risk was also evident in subsequent
pregnancies. Taken together this gives little support to the
hypothesis of a decisive and particularly distinct effect on
mammary tissue caused by the first pregnancy that associates
with later breast cancer risk.
Multiple studies have pointed to persistent changes in gene
expression14,15, epigenetic structure16–20, and epithelial stem cell
composition18,21 in the mammary gland following pregnancy.
However, the mechanisms proposed for pregnancy-induced
breast cancer protection have neither been substantiated or
replicated. Our novel finding that pregnancy-induced breast
cancer protection is obtained within a narrow time window, late
in pregnancy, will enable a meticulous investigation of the causal
factor behind this striking effect. Furthermore, a precise char-
acterization of the factor responsible for the effect will be helped
by our observation that each early age pregnancy offers cumu-
lative protection against breast cancer. Altogether, our results can
open a path to explore the specific biological mechanism behind
the impact of pregnancies on subsequent breast cancer risk.

 Our observations are in line with findings from mammalian
breast cancer models that show a protective effect of pregnancy
introduced close to term22. In theory, late-pregnancy stimuli that
transform the breast tissue to a stage represented by a lowered
breast cancer risk could originate from both the mother and the
fetus. However, findings by us and others provide little evidence
for a fetal involvement since infant sex23, infant absolute
birthweight10,24 or, as we show, fetal growth restriction and vital
status of the infant at birth do not influence the long-term breast
cancer risk.
Breastfeeding, and in particular the total breastfeeding dura-
tion, has been proposed to protect against breast cancer25 and
could potentially explain the association with pregnancy length.
However, at least two of our findings strongly argue against this
being the case. First, we found an equivalent protective effect on
breast cancer risk of stillbirths and live births from the 34th
gestational week. Second, the pregnancy-induced risk reduction
of breast cancer was restricted to young women below 30 years of
age at childbirth, whereas the total breastfeeding duration is
shortest for mothers younger than 30 years26 and does not vary
markedly by gestational length of pregnancy27.
High levels of alcohol consumption are found to be associated
with an increased risk of breast cancer28,29, and there are reports
of an association between heavy alcohol consumption and pre-
term birth30,31, why alcohol consumption could be a potential
factor in the association between pregnancy duration and breast
cancer risk. There are however large differences in alcohol con-
sumption between Denmark and Norway, with studies of
drinking patterns finding that this is the case both with regards to
drinking frequency and volume32,33, with differences in alcohol
consumption being especially pronounced during pregnancy30,34.
Given the marked differences in alcohol consumption between
Denmark and Norway, and the identical findings on the asso-
ciation between pregnancy duration and breast cancer risk, we
find it unlikely that alcohol consumption serves as a major

tion and maternal breast cancer risk.
Using prospective national registers ensured high validity,

of
women’s number of childbirths, and timing of these births. In
addition, the gestational duration of pregnancy is determined by
medical professionals at the time of pregnancy which ensures
proper classification of the pregnancy duration. The long follow-
up and the nationwide scope of the study furthermore provided
high statistical power, and the replication using Norwegian
national registers underlined the validity of the findings. Finally,
socioeconomic status and other potential confounding factors did
not explain the association of minimal pregnancy duration and
long-term breast cancer risk.
In conclusion, we found that each pregnancy in early age, and
not only the first, is associated with a significant long-term pro-
tective effect against breast cancer. Furthermore, only pregnancies
lasting 34 weeks or longer were associated with a reduction in
breast cancer risk. The reduction in breast cancer risk was present
regardless of whether the pregnancy ended in stillbirth or live
birth, and therefore cannot be explained by breastfeeding. This
suggests that a specific biological effect operating around week 34
of pregnancy induces long-term breast cancer protection.
Methods
Population registries. We established a population-based cohort of Danish
women by linking data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) with data from
the Medical Birth Registry and the Danish Cancer Registry. The CRS contains
detailed demographic information on all Danish residents, including linkage of
women to their children’s dates of birth. Since April 1, 1968, all Danish residents
who were alive or born thereafter have been assigned a unique identification
number in the CRS. This number permits information from different national
registries to be linked together. All live and stillbirths in Denmark, with dates of
birth, have been registered since 1973 in the Medical Birth Registry. Since 1978,
gestational week at time of birth has been recorded. For sensitivity analyses, we
obtained information on induced abortions in Denmark from the National Registry
of Induced Abortions, where induced abortions have been mandatory reported to
since 1939.
Information on breast cancer diagnoses was retrieved from the Danish Cancer
Registry, which contains information on all cancers diagnosed in Denmark since
1943 and is considered close to complete35. From Statistics Denmark we acquired
time-varying, individual-level socioeconomic data to address covariates potentially
associated with reproduction and breast cancer36; educational attainment (since
1970), employment status (since 1976), and disposable household income (since
1990).
In Norway, we linked data from the National Registry, the Medical Birth
Registry of Norway, and the Cancer Registry of Norway. The Medical Birth
Registry has registered all births (including gestational week of delivery) since
196737 and the Cancer Registry is considered accurate and close to complete with
regard to cancer diagnoses from 195338.
The research project was approved by institutional review for inclusion on
Statens Serum Institutes permit for research projects given by the Danish Data
Protection Agency (permit No. 2015-57-0102) and approved by the Regional Ethics
Committee of Western Norway (permit 252.06).
Subjects. We established a cohort of all Danish women born between January 1,
1935 and December 31, 2002. Using the CRS number, we linked information on
each woman’s childbirths with the corresponding pregnancy duration (gestational
week of delivery), and information on whether she developed invasive breast
cancer. We furthermore established a cohort of all Norwegian women born
between January 1, 1935 and December 31, 1994, with equivalent information on
reproductive history and breast cancer.
Statistical analyses. Incidence rate ratios (in the following termed RR) of breast
cancer by pregnancy history were estimated by log-linear Poisson regression in the
Danish cohort, the Norwegian cohort, and the combined cohort. In Denmark, each
woman was followed from January 1, 1978, or from her 12th birthday, whichever
came later, until breast cancer, death, emigration or December 31, 2014, whichever
came first. In Norway, each woman was followed from January 1, 1967, or from her
12th birthday, whichever came later, until breast cancer, death, emigration or
December 31, 2006, whichever came first. All analyses were adjusted for effects of
current age and time period in 5-year categories.
Pregnancy history was modeled by time-dependent variables as described
previously4. Thus, instead of describing history by the total number of childbirths
(i.e., RR of cancer in women with 1, 2, 3, or 4 births compared with women with 0
births), pregnancy history was evaluated by the RR for women with n births
compared with women with n−1 births (i.e., RR of cancer for 1 birth compared
with 0, 2 births compared with 1, and 3 births compared with 2). This
reparameterization allows for a focus on the effect of each additional birth on
cancer risk. The RRs were assumed to be the same regardless of birth number, and
the presented RRs are therefore RRs for each additional birth. To allow for a
different short-term and long-term effect of pregnancy, RRs were allowed to vary
according to time since birth (<10 years, ≥10 years) for parous women. In the
presentation of the model we focused on the parameters related to the long-term
effect of pregnancy. We furthermore allowed RRs to be different for childbirths at
younger (<30 years) and older maternal age (≥30 years) to focus on early age
pregnancies which have previously been associated with long-term reduced risk of
breast cancer3,4. The previously used method (4) was extended to include
pregnancy duration. In the previous approach the effect of each birth was stratified
according to time since birth and age at childbirth, but in this extended approach it
was further stratified by pregnancy duration. Thus, RRs were allowed to vary by
duration of the pregnancy in weeks, by the following categories: 20–27, 28–29, 30,
31, …, 41, 42–45 weeks, missing duration of pregnancy, duration of pregnancy not
reported, extremely early births (<20 weeks), and extremely late births (>45 weeks).
The four last categories are further described in Table 1, Supplementary Table 1,
and Supplementary Table 2.
In the analysis of pregnancy duration, all parameters described above were
included simultaneously. For example, for biparous women whose first birth
occurred in early age at week 38 and whose second birth occurred in late age at
week 40, their pregnancy history was modeled by four parameters: the short-term
and long-term effect of an early age birth at week 38, and the short-term and long-
term effect of a late age birth at week 40. Thus, when estimating the long-term
effect of the early age pregnancy at week 38, the model also included the short-term
effect of an early age pregnancy at week 38, the short-term effect of an late age
pregnancy at week 40, and the long-term of an late age pregnancy at week 40.
The analysis of pregnancy duration was based on follow-up time from January
1, 1978 in Denmark, and from January 1, 1967 in Norway, when the respective
Medical Birth Registers began recording gestational week of birth. Childbirths
registered in civil registrations systems were incorporated in the analyses to adjust
for the effects of pregnancies before start of the Medical Birth Registers.
In analysis of the effect of age at childbirth on breast cancer risk, RRs were
allowed to vary according to age at delivery in the categories <20, 20–21, 22–23,
24–25, 26–27, 28–29 and ≥30 years. In analyses of the adjustment effect of
socioeconomic status, each socioeconomic variable was added as an additional
variable.
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and procedure GENMOD.
Socioeconomic factors and risk of breast cancer. Using nationwide registries
from Statistics Denmark on educational attainment, employment and disposable
household income starting from respectively 1970, 1976, and 1990, we were able to
create a time-varying, three factor adjustment for socioeconomic status. The fol-
lowing categories of the three variables for socioeconomic status were used:
Educational attainment: primary schooling; high school; high school with
technical or mercantile focus; short basic education; higher education of short
duration; higher education of intermediate duration; academic bachelor degree;
academic master’s degree; and academic doctoral degree or equivalent educational
degree.

Birthweight and maternal risk of breast cancer. In order to investigate the effect
of birthweight relative to gestational age in pregnancies of different duration, we
combined data on gestational age and birthweight from the Danish Medical Birth
Registry compiled from 1978 and onwards. We defined a birth small for gestational
age (SGA) if the birthweight was below the 10th percentiles of births at the given
gestational week, in the corresponding 5-year period. We then stratified by weight
category (SGA vs. 10–100th percentile of birthweights at same week) and assessed
risk of breast cancer after a pregnancy of given duration, grouped into the following
lengths of pregnancy: week 20–33, week 34–36, week 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and week
42 or longer. To estimate RR of breast cancer by both relative birthweight and
gestational period, we extended the model so that the pregnancy effect also varied
by relative birthweight.
Threshold model analysis of pregnancy duration and risk of breast cancer.
Our estimates of the effect of an early age pregnancy stratified by the duration of
pregnancy (Fig. 2c) suggest that pregnancies lasting 34 gestational weeks are
necessary to obtain a long-term reduced risk of breast cancer. To substantiate this
conclusion we compared the observed pattern in Fig. 2c with week-specific
threshold models, where breast cancer risk reduction is achieved only by preg-
nancies with a specific minimal duration or longer. The threshold model with the
least difference in fit from the observed pattern in Fig. 2c is interpreted as providing
the best estimate for the critical length of pregnancy necessary for the long-term
breast cancer risk reduction.
The model used in Supplementary Figure 6 is in the following termed Mfig2C. In
this model, the long-term effect of each early age pregnancy with duration of the
pregnancy w, is modeled as βw, with w noting the gestational week categories
described in the paper. We compared Mfig2C with simple week-specific threshold
models (Mthreshold(w0)) by which a certain threshold of pregnancy duration is
associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. In that model the long-term effect
of each early-age pregnancy according to the duration of the pregnancy w is
modeled as β∙I(w ≥ w0), i.e., by one parameter. With regard to the other parameters
in the model, the two models are similar, i.e., a total difference of 14 parameters.
We furthermore compared models that allowed for difference in the pregnancy
effect according to parity (primiparity, multiparity) and country (Denmark,
Norway). All models were compared by the deviance (i.e., the difference in
−2∙loglikelihood between two models).
Supplementary Figure 6 shows the deviance between Mfig2C and the week-
specific MThreshold(w0) models for different threshold values (in gestational weeks),
w0, when using the simple week-specific threshold model (Supplementary Fig. 6A),
when allowing for difference in effect according to parity (Supplementary Fig. 6B)
and when further allowing for difference in effect according to both parity and
country (Supplementary Fig. 6C). The best fit were in all three situations found
using a threshold value of 34 weeks.
