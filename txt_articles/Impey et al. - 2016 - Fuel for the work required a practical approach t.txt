Abstract
Using an amalgamation of previously studied “train-low” paradigms, we tested
the effects of reduced carbohydrate (CHO) but high leucine availability on
cell-signaling responses associated with exercise-induced regulation of mito-
chondrial biogenesis and muscle protein synthesis (MPS). In a repeated-mea-
sures crossover design, 11 males completed an exhaustive cycling protocol
with high CHO availability before, during, and after exercise (HIGH) or alter-
natively,
low
CHO
but
high
protein
(leucine
enriched)
availability
(LOW + LEU). Muscle glycogen was different (P < 0.05) pre-exercise (HIGH:
583 � 158, LOW + LEU: 271 � 85 mmol kg�1 dw) but decreased (P < 0.05)
to comparable levels at exhaustion (�100 mmol kg�1 dw). Despite differences
(P < 0.05)
in
exercise
capacity
(HIGH:
158 � 29,
LOW + LEU:
100 � 17 min), exercise induced (P < 0.05) comparable AMPKa2 (3–4-fold)
activity, PGC-1a (13-fold), p53 (2-fold), Tfam (1.5-fold), SIRT1 (1.5-fold),
Atrogin 1 (2-fold), and MuRF1 (5-fold) gene expression at 3 h post-exercise.
Exhaustive exercise suppressed p70S6K activity to comparable levels immedi-
ately post-exercise (�20 fmol min�1 mg�1). Despite elevated leucine availabil-
ity post-exercise, p70S6K activity remained suppressed (P < 0.05) 3 h post-
exercise in LOW + LEU (28 � 14 fmol min�1 mg�1), whereas muscle glyco-
gen
resynthesis
(40 mmol kg�1
dw h�1)
was
associated
with
elevated
(P < 0.05) p70S6K activity in HIGH (53 � 30 fmol min�1 mg�1). We con-
clude: (1) CHO restriction before and during exercise induces “work-efficient”
mitochondrial-related cell signaling but; (2) post-exercise CHO and energy
restriction maintains p70S6K activity at basal levels despite feeding leucine-
enriched protein. Our data support the practical concept of “fuelling for the
work required” as a potential strategy for which to amalgamate train-low
paradigms into periodized training programs.
Introduction
Traditional nutritional strategies for endurance athletes
have typically advised high carbohydrate (CHO) availabil-
ity before, during, and after training sessions in order to
support high daily training volume and intensities (Burke
et al. 2011). However, in the last decade, accumulating
data demonstrate that strategic periods of reduced CHO
availability (the so-called “train-low” paradigm) actually
augments selected skeletal muscle markers of training
adaptation (Hawley and Morton 2014; Bartlett et al.
2015).

 enzyme activity and protein content (Yeo et al. 2008;
Morton et al. 2009; Van Proeyen et al. 2011), increases
both whole body (Yeo et al. 2008) and intramuscular
lipid
oxidation
(Hulston
et al.
2010),
and
in
some
instances, improves exercise capacity and performance
(Hansen et al. 2005; Cochran et al. 2015; Marquet et al.
2016). The augmented training responses observed when
“training low” are thought to be mediated via the com-
plex regulation of cell signaling pathways with potent
roles in modulating an oxidative phenotype. Indeed, when
exercise protocols are matched for work done, CHO
restriction augments both AMPK (Wojtaszewski et al.
2003) and p38MAPK activation (Cochran et al. 2010)
that ultimately converge on downstream transcription fac-
tors and coactivators such as PGC-1a (Psilander et al.
2013), p53 (Bartlett et al. 2013), and PPARd (Philp et al.
2013). In the context of nutrient-gene interactions, it is
therefore apparent that the acute molecular regulation of
cell signaling processes provides a theoretical basis for
understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning
chronic training adaptations.
The research designs that have been used to study both
acute and chronic train-low adaptations thus far, have
largely adopted twice per day training protocols (Hansen
et al. 2005; Yeo et al. 2008; Hulston et al. 2010), fasted
training (Van Proeyen et al. 2011), and CHO restriction
during (Morton et al. 2009) and/or post-exercise (Pile-
gaard et al. 2005). More recently, a “sleep-low, train-low”
model has also been developed in which athletes perform
an evening training session but sleep with reduced post-
exercise CHO intake, followed by completion of a fasted
training session on the subsequent morning. Using this
model, we (Bartlett et al. 2013) and others (Lane et al.
2015) observed enhanced activation of acute cell signaling
pathways and expression of genes with putative roles in
regulating training adaptation. Furthermore, when per-
formed chronically as part of a periodized nutrition strat-
egy,
this
model
of
CHO
restriction
also
enhanced
submaximal
cycling
efficiency,
high-intensity
cycling
capacity, and improved 10 km run time in already well-
trained triathletes (Marquet et al. 2016).
Despite the emergence of the aforementioned train-low
paradigms, the optimal approach for which to practically
apply with athletic populations is not currently known.
Such limitations are most well recognized for the potential
reductions in absolute training intensity associated with
reduced CHO availability (Widrick et al. 1993; Yeo et al.
2008; Hulston et al. 2010), perturbations to immune func-
tion and associated increases in muscle protein degradation
(Lemon and Mullin 1980; Howarth et al. 2010), all of
which could be detrimental to long-term training and ath-
letic performance. Furthermore, in the real-world training
environments of elite endurance athletes, it is likely that
athletes practice an amalgamation of the aforementioned
train-low paradigms (either through default of their cur-
rent training structure or via coach and sport scientist-led
practices), as opposed to undertaking one potential strategy
in isolation. The complexity of practical train-low models
is also exacerbated by the observations that many endur-
ance athletes (especially cyclists) also practice day-to-day or
longer term periods of energy periodization (as opposed to
CHO per se) in an attempt to reduce both body mass and
fat mass in preparation for key competitive events (Stelling-
werff 2012; Vogt et al. 2005; J.P. Morton, unpublished
observations). Indeed, the performance improvements
observed by Marquet et al. (2016) were also associated with
a 1 kg reduction in fat mass induced by the periodized
sleep-low model. When taken together, such data highlight
the requirement to study train-low paradigms that may be
more reflective of real-world athletic practice (i.e., both
CHO and energy restriction) and that are representative of
an amalgamation of the train-low protocols previously
studied in the research setting.
With this in mind, we therefore examined the effects of
high CHO versus low CHO availability on the modula-
tion of those skeletal muscle cell-signaling pathways with
putative roles in the regulation of both mitochondrial
biogenesis and muscle protein synthesis (MPS). We
employed a repeated-measures crossover design whereby
healthy active males performed an exhaustive cycling-
based protocol in conditions of high CHO availability
(i.e., “best” nutritional practice of CHO loading and
CHO feeding during and after exercise) versus a nutri-
tional protocol representative of both low CHO and
energy availability (as achieved via 36 h of reduced CHO
intake and omission of CHO intake before, during, and
after exercise). In an attempt to compensate for the nega-
tive effects of energy deficit on muscle protein degrada-
tion and synthesis (Pasiakos et al. 2010, 2011, 2013;
Breen et al. 2011; Areta et al. 2014), our low CHO proto-
col was also completed with leucine-rich protein availabil-
ity before, during, and after exercise. We specifically
hypothesized that reduced CHO availability would impair
exercise capacity but nonetheless, would induce compara-
ble or superior mitochondrial-related signaling thereby
inducing a work-efficient training and nutritional train-
low paradigm. We further hypothesized that high leucine
availability would up-regulate markers of protein synthe-
sis and reduce markers of muscle protein breakdown.

put (PPO) for the cohort were 53.6 � 7.0 mL kg�1 min�1
and 285 � 20 W, respectively. None of the participants
had a history of neurological disease or skeletal muscle
abnormality and none were under pharmacological inter-
vention during the course of the study. All subjects pro-

sinki (2008). The study was approved by the local Research
Ethics Committee of Liverpool John Moores University.
Design
In a repeated-measures crossover design separated by 7–
9 days, subjects completed two exhaustive exercise trials in
conditions of high CHO availability (HIGH) or reduced
CHO availability but with leucine-enriched protein feeding
before, during, and after exercise (LOW + LEU). At 36–
40 h prior to the main experimental trials, all subjects per-
formed a glycogen depletion protocol followed by 36 h of
high or low CHO intake so as to manipulate pre-exercise
muscle glycogen content prior to the exhaustive exercise
protocol. Subjects in HIGH then completed the exhaustive
exercise protocol in conditions considered as best nutri-
tional practice, that is pre-exercise meal consisting of both
CHO and protein, CHO intake during exercise and both
CHO and protein intake post-exercise. In contrast, subjects
in LOW + LEU commenced the exhaustive exercise proto-
col with reduced pre-exercise muscle glycogen and only
consumed leucine enriched whey protein before, during,
and after exercise. As such, this trial represented conditions
of reduced CHO and absolute energy availability, but high
protein availability throughout. Muscle biopsies were
obtained from the vastus lateralis immediately before,
post-, and at 3 h post-exercise. An overview of the experi-
mental protocol is shown in Figure 1.
Experimental Protocol
Assessment of maximal oxygen uptake
At 7–10 days prior to the experimental trials, all partici-
pants were initially assessed for peak oxygen consumption
(VO2peak) and peak aerobic power (PPO) as determined
during an incremental cycle test performed on an electro-
magnetically braked cycle ergometer as described previ-
ously (Impey et al. 2015).
Day 1 – Glycogen depletion protocol
Participants arrived at the laboratory on the evening
(1900 h) of the first experimental day having avoided
alcohol and vigorous physical activity for the previous
24 h. Nude body mass was recorded and a heart rate
(HR) monitor (Polar FT1, Finland) was fitted. Subjects
then performed an intermittent glycogen-depleting cycling
protocol lasting ~120 min, as described previously by our
group (Taylor et al. 2013). The activity pattern and total
time to exhaustion were recorded, and water was con-
sumed ad libitum throughout exercise. These parameters
were repeated exactly during the second experimental
condition and all cycling protocols were conducted on a
fully adjustable electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer
(SRM, Julich, Germany). Following the depletion exercise
protocol, participants in HIGH consumed high carbohy-
drate at a rate of 1.2 g kg�1 body mass (BM) carbohy-
drate per hour for the first three hours in a mixture of
bars and fluids (GO Bars/Go Energy, Science in Sport,
Nelson, UK) and 22 g of whey protein immediately post-
exercise (REGO Protein, Science in Sport, Nelson, UK).
In
contrast,
when
participants
completed
the
LOW + LEU trial, they consumed no carbohydrate within
the 3 h recovery period, but did consume the same bolus
of 22 g whey protein (REGO Protein, Science in Sport,
Nelson, UK) immediately post-exercise.
Day 2 – Nutritional protocols
During day 2, subjects in the HIGH trial consumed
8 g kg�1 BM carbohydrate as a mixture of foods and
sports supplements designed to maximize muscle glyco-
gen replenishment, whereas in the LOW + LEU trial, sub-
jects consumed 3 g kg�1 BM carbohydrate in order to
minimize muscle glycogen replenishment. In both trials,
subjects
also
consumed
2 g kg�1
BM
protein
and
1 g kg�1 BM fat. In this way, it was expected that subjects
would commence the main experimental trial on the
morning
of
day
3
with
high
(HIGH)
or
low
(LOW + LEU) muscle glycogen while also having con-
sumed identical protein and fat intake and completed the
same exercise loading patterns.
Day 3 – Main experimental trial
On the morning of the Day 3, subjects reported to the
laboratory in a fasted state and an indwelling cannula
(Safety Lock 22G, BD Biosciences, West Sussex UK) was
inserted into the anticubital vein in the anterior crease of
the forearm and a resting blood sample drawn. After a
resting blood sample was taken, the cannula was flushed
with ~5 mL of sterile saline (Kays Medical supplies, Liver-
pool, UK) to keep the cannula patent and sterile, this
procedure was repeated after each subsequent blood draw.
Following blood sampling, subjects in HIGH received a
standardized breakfast containing 2 g kg�1 BM CHO and

 an absolute dose of 22 g whey protein and 15 g fat at 2 h
prior to commencing the exhaustive exercise protocol.
Two hours were provided postprandial so as to allow suf-
ficient time for digestion prior to commencing exhaustive
exercise. In contrast, subjects in the LOW + LEU trial
consumed a leucine-enriched protein drink that is not
commercially available (Science in Sport, Nelson, UK)
containing a total of 22 g protein of which 6.3 g was leu-
cine at 45 min prior to commencing exercise. The leu-
cine-enriched protein was given 45 min prior to exercise
(as opposed to 2 h prior) so as to ensure sufficient circu-
latory amino acid availability during the exercise protocol
(Impey et al. 2015). Additionally, these timings and dos-
ing strategies are in accordance with nutritional practices
of professional road cyclists and as such, it was our aim
to examine a real-world nutritional protocol (J. P. Mor-
ton, unpubl. data). Subjects then completed a prescribed
cycling protocol consisting of 4 9 30 sec high-intensity
intervals (HIT) at 150% PPO interspersed with 2.5 min
active recovery at 40% PPO followed by 45 min steady
state (SS) cycling at 50% PPO so as to examine the effects
of altered substrate availability on standardized exercise
responses (i.e., RPE, HR, substrate utilization). During
the HIT and steady-state component, subjects in HIGH
ingested a 6% CHO solution providing 20 g of CHO
(GO Electrolyte, Science in Sport, Nelson, UK) at 20 min
intervals so as to provide 60 g in the first 60 min of exer-
cise, thereby in accordance with current nutritional rec-
ommendations for CHO intake during exercise. Subjects
in
LOW + LEU
ingested
one-third
of
the
leucine-
enriched protein mix providing 7.3 g of protein at the
same 20 min intervals as the feeding strategy in HIGH, so
as to provide 22 g protein per hour in an attempt to
maintain high circulatory amino acid availability during
exercise (Impey et al. 2015). Following the steady-state
cycle, 5 min of active recovery was provided and subjects
then commenced an exercise capacity test consisting of
intermittent “1 min efforts” corresponding to 80% PPO
Figure 1. Schematic overview of the experimental protocol. On the evening of day 1, subjects completed a glycogen depleting protocol
followed by 3 h of best practice recovery nutrition (HIGH) or sleep-low (LOW + LEU). Throughout the entirety of day 2, subjects consumed a
high CHO diet (HIGH) or alternatively, a low CHO and low energy dietary protocol (LOW + LEU) that was matched for both protein and fat
intake. During the main experimental trial on day 3, subjects performed an exhaustive cycling protocol in conditions of best practice nutrition
(HIGH) in which high CHO intakes were consumed before, during, and after exercise. In contrast, in the LOW + LEU trial, subjects consumed
leucine-enriched protein only. In this way, the LOW + LEU trial represented 3 days of an amalgamation of train-low strategies consisting of
sleep low (day 1), low dietary CHO intake (day 2), and omission of CHO intake before, during, and after exercise (day 3). Muscle biopsies were
obtained immediately pre-exercise, at the point of exhaustion (Exh) and at 3 h post-exhaustion. *denotes leucine-enriched protein.

 interspersed with 1 min recovery periods at 40% PPO.
This intermittent protocol was followed until the subjects
reached volitional fatigue. Physiological and perceptual
measures were recorded at regular intervals throughout
exercise and substrate utilization was assessed during the
steady-state component of the exercise protocol using
online gas analysis (CPX Ultima, Medgraphics, Min-
nesota) and the equations of Jeukendrup and Wallis
(2005). At the point of exhaustion, subjects in HIGH
received the same 1.2 g kg�1 BM CHO feeding strategy as
following the depletion ride and an absolute dose of 22 g
whey
protein
immediately
after
whereas
subjects
in
LOW + LEU consumed 22 g of the leucine enriched pro-
tein only immediately after exercise (Fig. 1). In this way,
subjects in HIGH undertook and recovered from exercise
having ingested 6.3 g kg�1 BM CHO across the duration
of the experimental trial along with a total of 44 g of pro-
tein, which contained 4.6 g of leucine. In comparison,
subjects in LOW + LEU consumed a total of 66 g of pro-
tein of which 18.9 g was leucine across the duration of
the
main
experimental
trial.
Laboratory
conditions
remained constant across all experimental trials (19–21°C,
40–50% humidity) and an overview of the nutritional
feeding protocol is shown in Figure 1.
Blood analysis
Blood samples were collected in vacutainers containing K2
EDTA, lithium heparin, or serum separation tubes, and
stored on ice or at room temperature until centrifugation
at 1500 g for 15 min at 4°C. Serum and plasma were ali-
quoted and stored at �80°C until analysis. Plasma glucose,
lactate, FFA, glycerol, b-hydroxybutyrate, and amino acids
were analyzed as previously described (Impey et al. 2015).
Muscle biopsies
Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus
lateralis immediately before exercise, at the point of fati-
gue, and at 3 h post-completion of the exercise protocol.
Muscle biopsies were obtained from separate incision sites
(2–3 cm apart) from the lateral portion of the vastus lat-
eralis
muscle.

Samples were obtained (approximately 50 mg) under
local anesthesia (0.5% marcaine) and immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80°C for later analysis.
RNA extraction and analysis
Muscle samples (~20 mg) were immersed and homoge-
nized in 1 mL TRIzo (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).
RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA concentration and purity were assessed
by UV spectroscopy at ODs of 260 and 280 nm using a
Nanodrop 3000 (Fisher, Rosklide, Denmark). A quantity
of 70 ng RNA was used for each PCR reaction.
Primer design
Primer sequences were identified using Gene (NCBI,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.gene)
and
designed
using
Primer-BLAST (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast). Sequence homology searches ensured speci-
ficity; all primers had no potential unintended targets fol-
lowing a blast search. The primers were ideally designed
to yield products spanning exon–exon boundaries to pre-
vent any amplification of gDNA. Three or more GC bases
in the last five bases at the 30 end of the primer were
avoided. Secondary structure interactions (hairpins, self-
dimer, and cross dimer) within the primer were avoided.
All primers were between 16 and 25 bp, and amplified a
product of between 141 and 244 bp; primers were pur-
chased from Sigma (Suffolk, UK).
Reverse transcriptase quantitative Real-
Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qRT-
PCR)
RT-qRT-PCR
amplifications
were
performed
using
QuantiFastTM SYBR� Green RT-PCR one-step kit on a
Rotogene 3000Q (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) supported by
rotogene software (Hercules, CA). RT-qTR-PCR was per-
formed as follows: hold 50°C for 10 min (reverse tran-
scription/cDNA synthesis), 95°C for 5 min (transcriptase
inactivation and initial denaturation step), and PCR steps
of 40 cycles; 95°C for 10 sec (denaturation), 60°C for
30 sec (annealing and extension). Upon completion, dis-
sociation/melting curve analyses were performed to reveal
and exclude nonspecific amplification or primer–dimer
issues (all melt analysis in this study presented single
reproducible peaks for each target gene suggesting ampli-
fication of a single product). Following initial screening
of suitable housekeeping genes, GAPDH showed the most
stable Ct values across all RT-PCR runs, subjects, and
regardless of experimental condition (25.5 � 1.01), and
was selected as the reference gene in all RT-PCR assays.
The relative gene expression levels were calculated using
the comparative Ct (DDCt) equation (Schmittgen and
Livak 2008) where the relative expression was calculated
as 2�DDct a where Ct represents the threshold cycle.
mRNA expression for all target genes was calculated rela-
tive to the reference gene (GAPDH) within same subject
and condition and to a calibrator of HIGH condition
pre-exercise.

 quantified immediately post-exercise given that many tar-
get genes are only up-regulated in the hours in recovery
from exercise.
Muscle glycogen concentration
Muscle glycogen concentration was determined according
to the acid hydrolysis method described by van Loon
et al. (2000) with glucose concentration quantified using
a commercially available kit (GLUC-HK, Randox Labora-
tories, Antrim, UK). Glycogen concentration is expressed
as mmol kg�1 dry weight (dw) and intra-assay coeffi-
cients of variation was <5%.
[c�32P] ATP kinase assay
A quantity of 30 mg of muscle tissue was used for the
measurement of p70S6K1 and AMPKa1 and a2 activity as
previously described (McGlory et al. 2014).
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical
Package
for
the
Social
Scientist
(SPSS
version
21).
Descriptive statistics were produced for all data sets to
check for normal distribution indicated by Kolmogorov–
Smirnov. Changes in exercise capacity were analyzed
using Student t-test. Changes in physiological and molec-
ular responses between conditions (i.e., muscle glycogen,
circulatory metabolites, amino acids, mRNA transcription,
and activity of signaling molecules) were analyzed using
two-way repeated-measures general linear model, where
the within factors were time and condition. If Mauchley’s
test of sphericity indicated a minimum level of violation,
as assessed by a Greenhouse Geisser epsilon (e) of ≥0.75,
data were corrected using the Huynh-Feldt e. If Mauch-
ley’s test of sphericity was violated, data were corrected
using Greenhouse Geisser e. Where a significant main
effect was observed, pairwise comparisons were analyzed
according to Bonferroni post hoc tests in order to locate
specific differences. An alpha value of P < 0.05 was uti-
lized for all tests and all data in text, figures, and tables
are presented as mean � SD.
Results
Skeletal muscle glycogen content and
exercise capacity
Muscle glycogen content was significantly higher pre-exer-
cise (P = 0.003) in the HIGH trial compared with the
LOW + LEU trial (Fig. 2A). Exhaustive exercise also sig-
nificantly reduced (P < 0.001) muscle glycogen stores to
comparable levels (<120 mmol kg�1 dw) with no differ-
ence
observed
between
conditions
(P = 0.278).
As
expected,
post-exercise
CHO
feeding
significantly
increased (P = 0.003) muscle glycogen in the HIGH trial
to approximately 200 mmol kg�1 dw, whereas no glyco-
gen resynthesis was observed in the LOW + LEU trial. In
accordance with distinct differences in CHO availability,
exercise capacity was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in
the HIGH
trial
(158 � 28 min)
compared
with
the
LOW+LEU trial (100 � 17 min), an effect that was
apparent in all 11 subjects (range: 4–113 min, 95% CI
differences: 38–79 min) (Fig. 2B).

However, in accordance with differences in CHO avail-

Discussion
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of high
CHO versus low CHO availability on the modulation of
those skeletal muscle cell-signaling pathways with putative
roles in the regulation of both mitochondrial biogenesis
and muscle protein synthesis. We adopted a train-low
model that represents an amalgamation of previously
studied train-low paradigms (incorporating both CHO
and energy restriction) and that we consider representa-
tive of the real-world practices often adopted by elite level
endurance athletes. Confirming our hypothesis, we pro-
vide novel data by demonstrating that although reduced
CHO availability impaired exercise capacity, our CHO
restriction protocol induced comparable AMPK-PGC-1a
signaling,
thus
inducing
“work-efficient”
signaling
responses. In contrast, refraining from CHO intake in the
post-exercise period (despite the intake of leucine-rich
protein) maintains p70S6K activity at basal levels. When
taken together, these data have practical implications by
suggesting that: (1) CHO restriction before and during
exercise induces work-efficient cell signaling related to
mitochondrial biogenesis but furthermore; (2) complete
CHO and energy restriction in the post-exercise period
reduces the activation of key signaling proteins regulating
skeletal muscle modeling processes. As such, these data
suggest that although athletes may benefit from carefully
scheduled periods of reduced CHO availability before and
during exercise so as to enhance mitochondrial-related
cell signaling, they should consume both CHO and pro-
tein post-exercise so as to restore the activation of MPS-
related signaling. Furthermore, our data lend support for
a potential “fuel for the work required” train-low para-
digm in which athletes could strategically reduce CHO
availability prior to completing predetermined training
workloads that can be readily performed with reduced
CHO availability, thereby inducing a “work-efficient”
approach to training. Alternatively, when the goals of the
training session are to complete the highest workload
possible over more prolonged durations, then adequate
CHO should be provided in the 24 h period prior to and
during the specific training session.
To
achieve
our
model
of
CHO
restriction,
we
employed a protocol consisting of an amalgamation of
previously studied train-low models. For example, having
completed an initial glycogen depletion protocol on the
evening of day 1, subjects adhered to a dietary protocol
consisting of reduced CHO and energy intake for the sub-
sequent 36 h prior to arriving at the laboratory on the
morning of day 3 for the main experimental trial. This
initial approach is thus representative of an acute sleep-
low model (i.e., CHO restriction in the initial hours fol-
lowing completion of the depletion protocol on day 1)
followed by consumption of a low CHO diet for the
entirety of day 2. This approach was successful in induc-
ing marked differences in pre-exercise muscle glycogen
content (�600 mmol kg�1 dw vs. 300 mmol kg�1 dw in
HIGH and LOW + LEU, respectively) on the morning of
the main experimental trial commenced on day 3 (see
Fig. 2). Consistent with the effects of post-exercise CHO
restriction on regulation of gene expression (Pilegaard

CHO Restriction And Cell Signaling
S. G. Impey et al.
 et al. 2005; Bartlett et al. 2013; Lane et al. 2015), we also
observed marked effects on the expression of genes associ-
ated with regulatory roles in mitochondrial biogenesis.
Indeed, subjects arrived at the laboratory on the morning
of day 3 with higher pre-exercise mRNA content of p53,
SIRT1, and Tfam in the LOW + LEU trial (see Fig. 4), all
of which are thought to be regulators of mitochondrial
biogenesis (Gurd et al. 2010; Saleem et al. 2013; Bartlett
et al. 2014, 2015). The observation of enhanced p53
mRNA following post-exercise CHO restriction is consis-
tent with previous data from our group demonstrating
that the exercise-induced phosphorylation of p53Ser15 is
enhanced with CHO restriction before, during, and after
exercise (Bartlett et al. 2013). On this basis, it is possible
that sustained p53 activation in recovery from the glyco-
gen depletion exercise protocol in conjunction with no
CHO intake in the LOW + LEU trial may be a common
signaling axis regulating the aforementioned gene expres-
sion responses. Indeed, p53 is known to autoregulate its
own expression (Deffie et al. 1993) as well as both basal-
and exercise-induced Tfam mRNA levels (Saleem et al.
2013). Furthermore, previous work in cell culture models
of nutrient deprivation has shown transcriptional regula-
tion of SIRT1 is mediated through p53 binding to the
SIRT1 promoter (Nemoto et al. 2004).
In relation to the main experimental trial on day 3, sub-
jects also refrained from CHO intake before, during, and
after the exercise protocol (but consumed leucine-rich
protein), thereby representative of an amalgamation of
“fasted (i.e. CHO restricted)” train-low protocols (Van
Proeyen et al. 2011) and “protein only” training sessions
(Taylor et al. 2013; Impey et al. 2015). As expected, we
observed distinct differences in substrate availability and
fuel utilization during the steady-state exercise protocol, as
evidenced by b-OHB levels comparable with nutritional
ketosis (Cox and Clark 2014), as well as greater levels of
circulating NEFA, glycerol, and lipid oxidation in the
LOW+LEU trial compared with the HIGH trial. Consis-
tent with the well-documented effects of both endogenous
and exogenous CHO availability on exercise performance
(Hawley et al. 1997; Stellingwerff and Cox 2014), we also
observed reduced exercise capacity in our LOW+LEU trial
compared with the HIGH trial, an effect that was evident
in all eleven subjects. Such data therefore reiterate the
obvious necessity for high CHO availability before and
during those training sessions in which prolonged high-
intensity workloads are required to be completed.
From a biochemical perspective, it is well-accepted that
reduced muscle glycogen stores induce greater skeletal
muscle cell signaling when compared with “matched-
work” exercise protocols (i.e., completion of identical
duration and intensity) undertaken with high glycogen
stores (Bartlett et al. 2015). For example, AMPKThr172
phosphorylation (Yeo et al. 2010; Lane
et al. 2015),
ACCSer79 phosphorylation (Bartlett et al. 2013), AMPK-a2
activity (Wojtaszewski et al. 2003), and the nuclear abun-
dance of AMPK-a2 protein content (Steinberg et al.
2006) are all up-regulated to a greater extent when acute
exercise is completed with reduced pre-exercise muscle
glycogen stores, an effect likely mediated via the presence
of a glycogen-binding domain on the b-subunit of the
AMPK heterotrimer (McBride et al. 2009). Furthermore,
exogenous CHO feeding during exercise attenuates AMPK
activity only when muscle glycogen sparing has occurred
(Akerstrom et al. 2006). The present data extend these
findings as we show for the first time comparable cell sig-
naling effects despite the completion of significantly less
work completed. Indeed, although we observed no effects
of exercise on AMPK-a1 activity (as reported by others,
Fuji et al. 2000), we observed similar increases in AMPK-
a2 activity and PGC-1a mRNA expression at comparable
levels of absolute glycogen, despite mean differences of
60 min less work completed in LOW + LEU versus
HIGH conditions. Such data therefore support the “glyco-
gen threshold” hypotheses (Philp et al. 2012) surmising
that a critical absolute level of glycogen must be exceeded
in order for significant AMPK signaling to occur during
prolonged endurance exercise protocols.
Given the effects of reduced CHO and energy deficit
on muscle protein degradation and protein synthesis
(Lemon and Mullin 1980; Howarth et al. 2010; Pasiakos
et al. 2010, 2013; Areta et al. 2014), we also chose to feed
leucine-enriched whey protein before, during, and after
the main experimental trial on day 3. In accordance with
the role of leucine availability in modulating MPS (Karls-
son et al. 2006; Churchward-Venne
et al. 2014), we
observed higher
pre-exercise
p70S6K activity
in
our
LOW + LEU trial when compared with the HIGH trial,
though we acknowledge that differences in timing of pre-
exercise feeding between trials may also have contributed
to this finding. The effects of acute endurance exercise on
regulation of p70S6K are not well established (and are
typically limited to measures of phosphorylation status)
with some studies reporting increases (Mascher et al.
2007, 2011) and others, no change (Coffey et al. 2006;
Vissing et al. 2013). Nevertheless, consistent with the
notion that exercise suppresses MPS during exercise
(Rennie et al. 1980; Rose and Richter 2009), we observed
significant reductions in p70S6K activity immediately
post-exercise to almost identical levels between trials. To
the best of our knowledge, we are only the second group
to directly quantify p70S6K activity in response to endur-
ance type exercise protocols and our data conflict with
Apro et al. (2015) who observed no change in response
to 5 9 4 min cycling at 85% VO2max. Such discrepancies
between studies are likely most related to the exhaustive

 and energy restricting nature of our exercise protocol.
While it is difficult to directly compare the total energy
expenditure between this study and the data of Apro
et al. (2015), the exercise interventions used here elicited
considerably lower muscle glycogen concentrations of
~100 mmol kg�1 dw versus 350 mmol kg�1 dw in the
study of Apro et al. (2015). The mechanism(s) behind
suppressed p70S6K activity following exhaustive exercise
likely involve a large number of signaling mechanisms
and regulators within skeletal muscle. Indeed, AMPK
mediated inhibition of mTOR through TSC2 (Sanchez
et al. 2012) or via interaction with v-ATPase-Ragulator at
the late endosomal/lysosme surface (Zhang et al. 2014), as
well as p53-REDD1-mediated inhibition of mTOR (Feng
and Levine 2010; Keller et al. 2013) are all potential can-
didates. Further studies are now required to test these
hypotheses in human skeletal muscle.
In relation to post-exercise feeding, we observed that
the co-ingestion of carbohydrate and whey protein feed-
ing was sufficient to rescue p70S6K activity in the HIGH
trial,
whereas
p70S6K
remained
suppressed
in
the
LOW + LEU trial despite the intake of “leucine-enriched”
whey protein feeding. While it is difficult to readily ascer-
tain the precise mechanism(s) underpinning these data, it
is noteworthy that we did observe increased upstream sig-
naling of PKB (Akt) in our HIGH condition, an effect
that may be simply related to insulin-mediated activation
given the repeat 90 g intakes of CHO immediately post
and at 1 and 2 h post-exercise. In addition, the potential
reduced PKB-mediated activation of p70S6K may be due
to the presence of low muscle glycogen per se given previ-
ous data demonstrating that the post-exercise (albeit in
resistance exercise) activation of Akt phosphorylation is
suppressed (independent of post-exercise feeding) when
muscle glycogen levels are comparable to that observed in
this study, that is <150 mmol kg�1 dw (Creer et al.
2005). Alternatively, the reduced activation of p70S6K in
the LOW + LEU trial could be due to high circulating
NEFA concentrations given that high fat availability can
impair MPS. Indeed, infusion of intralipid and heparin to
elevate circulating NEFA concentrations (to comparable
levels seen here) attenuates MPS in human skeletal muscle
in response to ingesting 21 g amino acids under eug-
lycemic hyperinsulemic clamp conditions (Stephens et al.
2015). Furthermore, Kimball et al. (2015) also reported
that high fat feeding impairs MPS in rat liver in a manner
associated with reduced p70S6K phosphorylation (but not
PKB phosphorylation).
The functional relevance of such divergent responses
cannot be ascertained from this study given that we did
not directly quantify MPS. Indeed, previous data have
suggested that low muscle glycogen availability (during
resistance
exercise
protocols)
does
not
have
any
measurable effect on post-exercise MPS (Camera et al.
2012), whereas the recovery from endurance exercise
when glycogen levels remain low results in negative pro-
tein balance (Howarth et al. 2010). As noted previously,
however, the experimental protocol adopted here was a
deliberate manipulation of both CHO and energy avail-
ability. Indeed, consistent with the effects of acute energy
deficit on skeletal muscle proteolysis (Carbone et al.
2013), we also observed increased resting mRNA expres-
sion of Atrogin 1 in the LOW + LEU trial when com-
pared with the HIGH trial. Furthermore, given that acute
energy deficit also impairs MPS in a manner associated
with reduced PKB (Pasiakos et al. 2010) and p70S6K
phosphorylation (Pasiakos et al. 2013), the divergent sig-
naling responses observed here may indeed manifest as
functional reductions in MPS and negative protein bal-
ance. From a practical perspective, our data suggest that
while there may be benefits of restricting CHO intake in
the post-exercise period in terms of enhancing mitochon-
drial signaling, it is also necessary to consume sufficient
CHO intake in the immediate post-exercise period so as
to replenish muscle glycogen to sufficient levels per se
and/or obtain upstream signaling effects associated with
feeding, the result of which could maintain the activity of
those signaling proteins with putative roles in regulating
MPS and skeletal muscle remodeling.
It is, of course, beyond the scope of the present paper
to offer definitive guidelines on how best to periodize
CHO restriction into an overall athletic training pro-
gram. Nevertheless, in accordance with the work of Lane
et al.
(2015),
we
consider
the
signaling
responses
observed herein to offer further mechanistic support for
the performance improvements observed by Marquet
et al. (2016) while adopting the 3-week sleep low-train-
ing
paradigm.
In
essence,
the
theme
that
emerges
appears to be the concept of both “day-to-day” and
“meal-by-meal” CHO periodization in accordance with
the upcoming training workloads that have been pre-
scribed. In practice, this approach of forward planning
could represent an amalgamation of train-low paradigms
and is perhaps best communicated by the principle of
“fuel for the work required”. Careful day-to-day peri-
odization
(as
opposed
to
chronic
periods
of
CHO
restriction) is likely to maintain metabolic flexibility and
still allow for the completion of high-intensity and pro-
longed duration workloads on heavy training days, for
example, interval type workouts undertaken above lactate
threshold. Intuitively, train-low sessions may be best left
to those training sessions in which the intensity and
duration of the session is not likely to be compromised
by reduced CHO availability, for example, steady-state
type training sessions performed at intensities below the
lactate threshold.

CHO Restriction And Cell Signaling
S. G. Impey et al.
 In summary, we have utilized an amalgamation of pre-
viously studied train-low paradigms (considered represen-
tative of real-world athletic practice) to demonstrate for
the first time that CHO restriction before and during
exhaustive exercise induces “work-efficient” cell signaling
related to mitochondrial biogenesis. However, in the
absence of CHO feeding and absolute energy intake in
the 3 h post-exercise period, p70S6K activity remains sup-
pressed despite consuming leucine-rich protein immedi-
ately post-exercise. When taken together, these data
allude to a potential muscle glycogen threshold hypothesis
surmising that reduced pre-exercise muscle glycogen may
not only enhance the activation of those pathways regu-
lating mitochondrial biogenesis but also suggest that
keeping glycogen and energy intake at critically low levels
may impair the regulation of post-exercise muscle protein
synthesis. Furthermore, our data lend support for a
potential “fuel for the work required” train-low paradigm
in that athletes could strategically reduce CHO availability
prior to completing predetermined training workloads
that can be readily performed with reduced CHO avail-
ability, thereby inducing a “work-efficient” approach to
training. Alternatively, when the goals of the training ses-
sion are to complete the highest workload possible over
more prolonged durations, then adequate CHO should be
provided in the 24 h period prior to and during the
specific training session. Future studies should now exam-
ine the functional relevance of the signaling responses
observed here, not only in terms of acute muscle protein
synthesis but also the chronic skeletal muscle and perfor-
mance adaptations induced by long-term use of this feed-
ing strategy.
