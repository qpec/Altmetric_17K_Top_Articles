Currently 23 million U.S. adults have been diagnosed with 
diabetes (1). The two most common forms of diabetes are 
type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoim-
mune destruction of the pancreas’s beta cells, which produce 
insulin. Persons with type 1 diabetes require insulin for survival; 
insulin may be given as a daily shot or continuously with an 
insulin pump (2). Type 2 diabetes is mainly caused by a com-
bination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency 
(3). A small proportion of diabetes cases might be types other 
than type 1 or type 2, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the 
young or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (3). Although 
the majority of prevalent cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
are in adults, national data on the prevalence of type 1 and 
type 2 in the U.S. adult population are sparse, in part because 
of the previous difficulty in classifying diabetes by type in 
surveys (2,4,5). In 2016, supplemental questions to help 
distinguish diabetes type were added to the National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS) (6). This study used NHIS data from 
2016 to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among 
adults by primary type. Overall, based on self-reported type 
and current insulin use, 0.55% of U.S. adults had diagnosed 
type 1 diabetes, representing 1.3 million adults; 8.6% had 
diagnosed type 2 diabetes, representing 21.0 million adults. 
Of all diagnosed cases, 5.8% were type 1 diabetes, and 90.9% 
were type 2 diabetes; the remaining 3.3% of cases were other 
types of diabetes. Understanding the prevalence of diagnosed 
diabetes by type is important for monitoring trends, planning 
public health responses, assessing the burden of disease for edu-
cation and management programs, and prioritizing national 
plans for future type-specific health services.
NHIS is an annual, cross-sectional household interview 
survey conducted by CDC that gathers health-related data in a 
nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized U.S. population (6). The 2016 NHIS Sample Adult Core 
consisted of 33,028 adults aged ≥18 years, with a final response 
rate of 54.3%. Each respondent was randomly selected among 
all adults aged ≥18 years in each household. During face-to-face 
interviews, respondents were asked whether a doctor or health 
care professional had ever told them that they had diabetes, 
other than during pregnancy. Among those who said they 
had diabetes, questions were asked regarding age at diagnosis 
and insulin and oral hypoglycemic medication use. In 2016, 
respondents were also asked to report whether they had type 1, 
type 2, or another type of diabetes. Virtually all patients with 
type 1 diabetes require insulin to survive, and very few persons 
who use insulin do not report using it (5). Previous studies 
have found that self-reported diabetes type alone is not a valid 
method for classifying diabetes type in surveys because some 
patients are not aware of their diabetes type (5,7). Therefore, for 
this analysis, type 1 diabetes was defined as current insulin use 
and self-report of type 1 diabetes. Adults who reported having 
type 1 diabetes but reported not using insulin were classified 
as having type 2 diabetes, as were persons who reported type 2 
diabetes, unknown diabetes type, or who would not report 
diabetes type. Respondents who reported having another 
diabetes type were classified as having “other type.”
Crude prevalence estimates of diagnosed diabetes by type 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the 
overall population and by selected sociodemographic charac-
teristics. P values were calculated from chi-squared tests and 
were considered significant at <0.05. Final survey weights were 
applied to the data to adjust for various probabilities of selec-
tion and household nonresponse. Statistical software was used 
to account for NHIS’s complex sampling design.
A total of 3,519 respondents aged ≥18 years reported hav-
ing diabetes, including 211 classified as having type 1; 3,210 
classified as having type 2 (including 182 who reported having 
type 1, but not taking insulin; 2,897 who reported having 
type 2; one who reported an unknown type; and one refusal); 
and 98 classified as having “other” type. In 2016, the overall 
crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among U.S. adults 
was 9.44% (95% CI = 9.01–9.88). The prevalences of type 1 
diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other diabetes types were 0.55%, 
8.58%, and 0.31%, respectively (Table). The weighted percent-
ages of all diagnosed diabetes cases that were type 1 and type 2 
were 5.8% and 90.9%, respectively; the remaining were other 
types. Based on the weighted NHIS population, the estimated 
numbers of adults with type 1, type 2, and other diabetes types 
were 1.3 million, 21.0 million, and 0.8 million, respectively.
Estimated crude prevalence of type 1 diabetes among U.S. 
adults did not significantly vary by age group (p = 0.54) or 
education (p = 0.14) (Table). The prevalence of type 1 dia-
betes was higher among men (0.64%) than among women

(0.46%) (p<0.05) and higher among non-Hispanic whites 
(whites) (0.67%) than among Hispanics (0.22%) (p<0.01). 
By age group, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was highest 
among adults aged ≥65 years and lowest among adults aged 
18–29 years (p<0.001), and by race/ethnicity, was higher 
among non-Hispanic blacks (11.52%) than among non-His-
panic Asians (6.89%), whites (7.99%), and Hispanics (9.07%) 
(p<0.001) (Table). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes decreased 
with higher levels of educational attainment (p<0.001).
Discussion
In 2016, the estimated prevalences of diagnosed type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes were 0.55% (corresponding to 1.3 million 
U.S. adults) and 8.6% (corresponding to 21.0 million U.S. 
adults), respectively. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes accounted for 
approximately 6% and 91% of all cases of diagnosed diabetes, 
respectively. Because the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is so 
much higher than that of type 1, current diabetes surveillance 
data that do not distinguish diabetes type are more reflective 
of persons with type 2 diabetes. Recent analysis of diagnosed 
diabetes prevalence indicates a plateauing among adults aged 
20–79 years (8), but it is not known whether this trend might 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The two most common forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. 
Previous national diabetes prevalence estimates did not 
distinguish between types among U.S. adults.
What is added by this report?
New data allowed estimation of diagnosed diabetes by type. In 
2016, the prevalence of diagnosed type 1 diabetes was 0.55%, 
representing 1.3 million U.S. adults; the prevalence of diag-
nosed type 2 diabetes was 8.6%, representing 21.0 million U.S. 
adults. Non-Hispanic white adults had a higher prevalence of 
diagnosed type 1 diabetes than did Hispanic adults. Non-
Hispanic blacks had the highest prevalence of diagnosed type 2 
diabetes. Diagnosed type 2 diabetes prevalence estimates 
increased with age and decreased with increasing levels of 
educational attainment.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Knowledge about national prevalence of diagnosed diabetes by 
type might be helpful in monitoring trends, assessing the 
burden of disease for education and management programs, 
and guiding and prioritizing national plans for future type-
specific health services.
differ for type 1 diabetes. Because the etiology, treatment, and 
outcomes of diabetes vary by type, it is important to distinguish 
between them.
There is no reference standard for classifying prevalent type 1 
diabetes or type 2 diabetes cases in public health surveillance. 
The presence of autoantibodies against the beta cells of the pan-
creas and the lack of endogenous insulin secretion are biologic 
markers of type 1 diabetes. However, beta cell autoantibodies 
disappear with time and might even be absent at the time of 
type 1 diabetes diagnosis (2). Insulin secretion tests are difficult 
to perform and interpret, making these tests unsuitable for use 
in cross-sectional surveys. In administrative health databases 
and electronic medical records, adults with diabetes frequently 
have International Classification of Diseases codes for both type 1 
and type 2 diabetes. For this reason, disease coding has been 
combined with other information (e.g., current prescriptions 
for insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication) when estimat-
ing diabetes type in these data (9,10). Using type 1 diabetes 
self-report and current insulin use to classify diabetes type, 
the percentage of all diabetes cases that were type 1 diabetes 
fell reasonably within the range of results from other studies 
(approximately 5%–10%) (3–5,9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, the data were self-reported and underestimate the 
total number of adults with diabetes. Second, data were not 
validated, which could have led to misclassification of diabetes 
type. Adults with self-reported type 1 diabetes who did not 
report insulin use were reclassified as having type 2 diabetes,

which might have resulted in misclassification if they actually 
used insulin but did not report use. However, self-reported 
use of insulin is highly specific: <0.02% of persons who 
reported insulin in a medication log failed to report using it 
when asked (5). Some insulin users with type 2 diabetes might 
have incorrectly reported type 1 diabetes, assuming that tak-
ing insulin meant they had type 1 diabetes (5). In addition, 
because self-reported cases of unknown type were reclassified 
as type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes might 
have been overestimated. However, according to a Canadian 
survey-based algorithm to distinguish diabetes types, 99% 
of adults who self-reported unknown type would have been 
classified as type 2 diabetes (7). Finally, the small sample size 
of some subgroups limited precision.
Despite these limitations, this first study to estimate the 
prevalence of diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes based on 
self-report and current insulin use among U.S. adults provides 
information to track prevalence of diabetes by type to moni-
tor trends and assess the burden of disease for education and 
prevention programs. Knowledge about national prevalences 
of type 1 and type 2 diabetes might facilitate assessment of the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of public health interventions and 
policies aimed at improving diabetes management and help to 
prioritize national plans for future type-specific health services.
