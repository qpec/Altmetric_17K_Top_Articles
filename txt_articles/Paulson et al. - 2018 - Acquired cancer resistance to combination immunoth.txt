Understanding mechanisms of late/acquired cancer immunotherapy resistance is critical to
improve outcomes; cellular immunotherapy trials offer a means to probe complex
tumor–immune interfaces through defined T cell/antigen interactions. We treated two
patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma with autologous Merkel cell polyomavirus
specific CD8+ T cells and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. In both cases, dramatic remissions
were associated with dense infiltration of activated CD8+s into the regressing tumors.
However, late relapses developed at 22 and 18 months, respectively. Here we report single
cell RNA sequencing identified dynamic transcriptional suppression of the specific HLA genes
presenting the targeted viral epitope in the resistant tumor as a consequence of intense CD8-
mediated immunologic pressure; this is distinguished from genetic HLA-loss by its reversi-
bility with drugs. Transcriptional suppression of Class I loci may underlie resistance to other
immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, and have implications for the design of
improved immunotherapy treatments.

mmunotherapy has recently entered the cancer mainstream
with the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs)1–4. However, despite many impressive responses, the
majority of cancers treated are either unresponsive or develop
late/acquired resistance5–7. Understanding resistance is critical
but complex, as tumor–immune interfaces include multiple cell
populations and many target antigens8. Among the small number
of cancers for which resistance mechanisms have been con-
clusively determined, genetic loss of antigen presentation to CD8
+ T cells has often been identified9. Intriguingly, a recent report
suggested that, in low antigen burden tumors, genetic loss of a
single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele is associated with
checkpoint inhibitor resistance, supporting the concept that
T cells recognizing very few epitopes may mediate an immu-
notherapy
response10.
However,
most
tumors
resistant
to
checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy lack a readily identifiable
genetic means of resistance, suggesting transcriptional (and
potentially reversible) escape mechanisms may be at play.
Adoptive cellular immunotherapy for solid tumors offers a
defined T cell population and a defined antigen, and we thus
hypothesized that detailed longitudinal investigation of patients
who developed late/acquired resistance to autologous endogenous
T cell therapy combined with ICIs might help broadly inform
immunotherapy resistance. We focused on patients with Merkel
cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive skin cancer typically caused
by the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)11–13, because of the
immunotherapy responsiveness6,14,15, exceptionally low muta-
tional/neoepitope burden16–18 and highly expressed, defined
conserved viral antigens11,19,20. We first interrogated tumors
from a discovery/index patient: a 59-year-old man with widely
metastatic heavily pre-treated MCC whom we treated with
autologous ex vivo expanded CD8+ T cells recognizing a newly
described HLA-B restricted allele of MCPyV followed by check-
point inhibitors. After a 22 month response, tumors relapsed. The
targeted antigen, infused T cells, and immunohistochemistry
staining for pan-HLA-ABC were all present, rendering the
mechanism of escape occult. We then performed single cell RNA
sequencing that revealed selective loss of HLA-B at the time of
acquired resistance, which we found to be transcriptional and
reversible. In a second validation patient, treated with HLA-A
restricted CD8+ T cells and ICIs, MCC relapsed after an
18 month response with transcriptional loss of HLA-A, sup-
porting the reproducibility of this escape. Transcriptional sup-
pression of Class I loci may underlie resistance to other
immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, and has
implications for the design of effective immunotherapy combi-
nations to rescue patients from late/acquired immunotherapy
resistance.
Results
Treatment of discovery patient with MCPyV-specific T cells.
Using a peptide pool based screening approach, we identified a
novel HLA-B*3502-restricted epitope in MCPyV sT-Ag onco-
protein (MCPyV-sT83-91; Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1)20. A
59-year-old man expressing HLA-B*3502+ (referred for simpli-
city as discovery patient, 2586-4) presented with widely meta-
static MCPyV-associated MCC that was refractory to >5 prior
therapies, including one infusion of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-
1 ICI6. The patient underwent leukapheresis, from which
MCPyV-sTAg-specific polyclonal endogenous CD8+ T cells
were expanded by stimulation with autologous dendritic cells
pulsed with the MCPyV-sT83-91 (NCT01758458; Supplementary
Fig. 2)21. Several metastases were irradiated to upregulate pan
class I HLA (Methods; Supplementary Fig. 3)21,22, with remain-
ing disease unmanipulated for monitoring. MCPyV-specific
CD8+ T cells were infused (1010 cells per m2) on day 0 and
again 33 days later. Toxicities included transient fevers lasting
<24 h, requiring only supportive care on the general ward (Sup-
plementary Table 1). Since his tumors enlarged, pembrolizumab
and ipilimumab23, an anti-CTLA-4 ICI, were added, followed by
regression (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Fig. 3). Tumors shrank by
>90%, with symptomatic improvement, and the patient returned
to work. Twenty-two months after T cell infusion and in the
context of ongoing ICI therapy, the patient relapsed, indicating
late/acquired immunotherapy resistance.
Infused CD8+ T cells persisted in peripheral blood at relapse.
During the clinical response, infused, virus-specific CD8+ cells
persisted in the peripheral blood (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 4)
and no other virus-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells recognizing
alternate epitopes in MCPyV were detected (Supplementary
Fig. 5)19,20. At relapse, antigen-experienced MCPyV-specific CD8
+ cells abundantly persisted in the peripheral blood (>25% of
CD8+ cells) and their immunophenotype was similar to the time
of response (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 4).
Tumor resistance mechanism remained unclear by standard
evaluations. Biopsy of a relapsed tumor (new tumor on lower leg;
day + 832; not previously irradiated) revealed preserved expres-
sion of HLA-ABC and of MCPyV oncoproteins by immunohis-
tochemistry (Fig. 1d). DNA sequencing (whole exome and
MCPyV) detected several tumor-associated/somatic mutations
(e.g., PTEN) in the pre-treatment tumor, but no additional
mutations explaining immune escape at acquired resistance,
including no mutations or loss of-heterozygosity in the HLA-B
gene, sequenced HLA-B promoter region, or targeted MCPyV
epitope (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Table 2).
Given the absence of an identifiable genomic basis, we explored
transcriptional regulation as a mechanism for tumor escape.
scRNAseq of blood revealed T cell activation at response. We
first assessed the activity of infused T cells by performing single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) with whole-transcriptome
expression analysis on serial PBMCs using the 10x Genomics
platform24 (n = 11,021 cells; Methods). Overlay of analyses at
four time-points (pre-treatment, early post treatment day + 27,
responding post treatment day + 376, relapse/acquired resistance
post treatment day + 614) revealed overlap of all clusters, indi-
cating similarity between the processed cells and endogenous
CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Unsupervised clustering
distinguished CD8+, CD4+, NK, B, and dendritic cells, and
monocytes (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 7)25. Three CD8+ T cell
clusters were identified: naïve/central memory, effector memory/
effector, and an activated effector population significantly enri-
ched at response, which overexpressed glycolysis (GAPDH,
mitochondrial RNAs) and other activation (IL32; actin) tran-
scripts relative to the effector memory/effector cells (Fig. 2b–d;
Supplementary Table 3)26–28, while maintaining an expression
profile otherwise consistent with traditional effector CD8+ T cells
(expression of granzymes and perforins without CCR7 or IL7R
expression; Supplementary Fig. 7).
Activated CD8+ T cells infiltrated the responding tumor. In
tumor biopsies at time of treatment response and concurrent to
the presence of activated CD8+ cells in blood (day + 349), CD8+
T cells expressing the activation marker HLA-DR newly infil-
trated the previously T cell “cold”, now shrinking MCC (Fig. 3a,
b)29,30. The dominant CD8+ cell clonotype in the infusate
identified by its unique CDR3-beta was also dominant in
regressing metastases (Fig. 3c)31, implicating infused CD8+ cells

 as the likely mediators of tumor regression. At a later biopsy after
acquired resistance (day + 832), CD8+ T cells were absent from
the relapsing tumor. This finding, combined with the presence of
quiescent T cells in the peripheral blood identified by scRNAseq,
suggests tumor specific CD8+ T cells were no longer encoun-
tering antigen (Figs. 2 and 3).
scRNAseq of relapsed tumor revealed HLA-B downregulation.
To define the mechanism of late/acquired resistance, scRNAseq
was performed on viably frozen tumor digests (Fig. 4a; n =
7431 cells), from pre-treatment and acquired resistance (D + 615)
time points. Although bulk/unsorted cells were assessed together,
scRNAseq tSNE unsupervised clustering permitted segregation
and simultaneous analysis of tumor, macrophage, B lymphocyte,
T lymphocyte, fibroblast and endothelial populations (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8). The transcriptome of non-tumor clusters before
and at late/acquired resistance were superimposable, implying
changes in these microenvironment cells were not driving
immune evasion. In contrast, MCC tumor cells demonstrated
marked transcriptional change, visualized by distinct spatial
separation of pre-treatment and relapsed tumor cells in tSNE
plots (Fig. 4a, b), with 255 differentially expressed genes (Meth-
ods; Supplementary Data 2). These included many expected to be
overexpressed in a multiply-recurrent cancer (e.g., cell cycle), but
also defined the immune escape. Specifically, MCC tumor sig-
nificantly downregulated HLA-B, but not HLA-A at acquired
resistance (Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary Fig. 9). This implies intense
immunologic and selective pressure from the transferred HLA-
B*3502-restricted CD8+ cells. HLA-B loss was exclusive to tumor
cells and undetectable by standard HLA-ABC immunohis-
tochemistry (Fig. 1d). To exclude sampling bias, tumor from a
second post-resistance biopsy (day + 832) was obtained and
qPCR reaffirmed HLA-B downregulation (Fig. 4e).
HLA-B transcription was restored with hypomethylating
agents. We next sought to determine whether transcriptional

 downregulation of HLA-B was reversible. We were able to suc-
cessfully establish short term ex vivo cultures but not a cell
line. In ex vivo cultures, HLA-B loss was reversible with either
pharmacologic doses of interferon-γ or the hypomethylating
agent
5-azacitadine,
consistent
with
transcriptional
downregulation22,32.
Identification of and clinical course of second validation
patient. To validate our findings, we sought to perform similar
analyses on a second patient, preferably treated with MCPyV-
specific T cells restricted to a different class I HLA. Out of all
patients previously treated at our institution with both MCPyV-
specific T cells and ICIs, we identified one additional patient with
early response and late/acquired immunotherapy resistance.
Patient 9245-3, referred to as validation patient for simplicity, was
treated with MCPyV-specific CD8+ T cells and checkpoint
inhibition, this time with T cells restricted to HLA-A2 and ave-
lumab (anti-PD-L1) as checkpoint inhibition (Supplementary
Fig. 10; NCT0258482)14,15. This validation patient had an
18 month response to combined immunotherapy, during which
he achieved complete regression by radiographic and pathologic
assessment. However, at the 18 month time point, he relapsed at a
single tumor site, and tumors were excised (day + 565 post-
treatment). Resistant tumor expressed MCPyV T antigen and had
detectable pan-HLA-ABC by immunohistochemistry (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10).
T cells infiltrated tumor during treatment response in the
validation patient. We interrogated the T cell infiltration in the
microenvironment for the validation patient. Prior to T cell
therapy, the tumor was T cell cold (Supplementary Fig. 11).
However, during response (day + 14), the tumor became T cell
hot with intratumoral enrichment of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. 11). At acquired resistance (day + 565), CD8
+ T cells were no longer infiltrating intratumorally but instead
were excluded to the tumor periphery. At that time, infused HLA-
A2 restricted T cell persisted at low levels in the microenviron-
ment (Supplementary Fig. 11).
scRNAseq of tumor revealed HLA-A transcriptional down-
regulation. For the validation patient, tumor tissue was only
available in viably frozen format from a time of late/acquired
resistance (day + 565). Therefore, scRNAseq using the 10x
genomics
5′
platform
was
performed
on
this
resistant
tumor (n = 5397 cells), along with matched peripheral blood
(n = 5870 cells; day + 559; Fig. 4f-h, Supplementary Fig. 12) to
provide additional comparative tissue. We again observed
selective transcriptional downregulation of the targeted HLA
(HLA-A; Fig. 4g) in the tumor cells, without changes in the
HLA-A
DNA
sequence
as
determined
by
whole
exome
sequencing (Supplementary Table 4). Attempts to culture
tumor from the validation patient were unsuccessful in both
short term and long-term cultures, and thus reversibility with
interferon-γ and 5-azacitidine could not be tested.

 Discussion
Late/acquired resistance stands as a barrier to immunotherapy
cure. We performed detailed investigation on two patients who
had received T cell immunotherapy along with ICIs; these
patients both had sustained immunotherapy responses followed
by late/acquired resistance. We observed infiltration of infused
CD8+ T cells into shrinking MCC tumors, supporting T cell
mediated regression. In both cases, when tumors relapsed, there
was apparent selective transcriptional downregulation of the HLA
restricting the targeted MCPyV epitope.
Immune avoidance by genetic loss of single or all class I HLAs
has been described as a mechanism of resistance to cellular
immune therapies33 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors9,10.
Immunotherapy escape by genetic HLA loss is important to
distinguish from immunotherapy escape by transcriptional HLA
loss as we observed here. In the former, the HLA alleles are
deleted and new T cell responses must necessarily be targeted to
alternate HLAs to overcome immunotherapy resistance. In the
latter, tumor-specific HLA suppression is potentially reversible
with drug therapy. Transcriptional suppression of all class I HLA
genes in a coordinated fashion has been described previously by
our group and others for MCC22,32. This has also been described
as a mechanism of melanoma early34 and, in a single case, late
immunotherapy resistance35. Differential transcriptional sup-
pression of the targeted class I HLA genes as a mechanism of late
immunotherapy
resistance
demonstrates
immunotherapy
responses can be driven by T cells restricted to a single HLA.
Additionally, such resistance cannot be readily detected by pan-
HLA-ABC immunohistochemistry, indicating this mechanism
might have been underappreciated previously.
Our study had limitations. Attempts to generate tumor-derived
cell lines for additional functional studies were unsuccessful on
both patients. We could not differentiate if acquired resistance
represented immunoediting, i.e., outgrowth of a pre-existing
previously rare or quiescent clone, or was new transcriptional
suppression that developed after immunotherapy. In either sce-
nario, immune pressure from the transferred CD8+ T cells
revealed selective HLA downregulation that was transcriptional,
and in at least one patient reversible.
Here we employ scRNAseq on thousands of cells to demon-
strate strong immune pressure mediated by ICIs and transferred
CD8+ T cells recognizing a single tumor epitope, and identify a
novel mechanism of immunotherapy escape by selective tran-
scriptional loss of the targeted HLA under T cell pressure, which
is rendered possible based on established differential regulation of
HLA-A and -B genes36. This has therapeutic implications for
rescue as it is potentially reversible (e.g., hypomethylating agents).
Transcriptional loss of antigen presentation deserves further
evaluation in immunotherapy resistance, as these targetable
escape mechanisms are likely active in additional tumor types.
Methods
Identification of HLA-B*3502-restricted epitope of MCPyV. Tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) from a testicular metastasis of a 64-year-old man with advanced
MCC (separate from featured case) were non-specifically expanded for 2 weeks
with IL-2 and IL-15 cytokine support and screened against peptide pools (13 mers
overlapping by 9) tiling across the entirety of expressed portion of MCPyV T
antigens by Elispot20. Confirmation of reactivity to the small T antigen pool
(containing peptides spanning the C-terminal domain of MCPyV small T antigen),
identification of minimal epitope as MCPyV-sT83-91 (Supplementary Fig. 1), and
restriction to HLA-B*3502 was determined by interferon-gamma intracellular
cytokine stain, using autologous irradiated PBMC pulsed with peptide at final
concentration of 1 microgram per milliliter as antigen presenting cells. This peptide
was then confirmed to also be held by HLA-B*3501 and HLA-B*3503 alleles, which
are highly similar to HLA-B*3502. For sequence comparison analyses, all Merkel
cell polyomavirus small T antigen protein sequences available in NCBI were
downloaded on August 21, 2017 in FASTA format and aligned using MUSCLE37.
Clinical protocols. All clinical investigations were performed in compliance with
the Declaration of Helsinki principles. The first treated patient (primary focus of
manuscript, 2586-4) was enrolled on protocols #2586/NCT01758458 (T cell
infusion treatment), #6585 and #1765 (biological sample collection) at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC, Seattle, WA), all research activities
were approved by the FHCRC Institutional Review Board and the Food and Drug
Administration. The patient provided written informed consent. The second,
“validation” patient was enrolled on protocol #9245/NCT0258482 as well as the
sample collection protocols as above (9245-3). The third patient from whom the
HLA-B*3502-restricted epitope was identified was enrolled on protocol #6585
(biological sample collection) and also provided written informed consent.
The primary patient (2586-4) received hypofractionated radiation for HLA
upregulation to some but not all disease sites: 21 Gy in 6 fractions to pelvic nodes,
8 Gy in 1 fraction to retroperitoneum (previously heavily irradiated and recurrent
post radiation), 8 Gy in 1 fraction to one of the thigh tumors. Other sites of disease,
including orbit, mediastinum (bulky), bladder, lumbar spine, and other lower
extremity tumors were not irradiated. Twenty-four hours thereafter the first of his
two infusions of HLA-B3502 restricted CD8+ T cells targeting Merkel cell
polyomavirus was administered. The second infusion was 33 days after the first.
Cell dose was at 10 billion cells per m2 for a total dose of 26 billion cells. After
initial progression, pembrolizumab followed by ipilimumab were added. Please see
Fig. 1 for schematic of infusions. Tumor volumes were determined by mWHO
criteria38.
The second validation patient (9245-3) is a 59-year-old man with metastatic
MCC that had initially presented as stage IIIB disease, now metastatic at multiple
sites. He had developed multiple relapses that had previously been treated with
radiation; trial interventions were first systemic therapy. He received avelumab
(anti-PD-L1) 10 mg/kg every two weeks15, and four infusions of MCPyV-specific
T cells at dosages ranging from 0.8-3.9 billion (dose target of 1010 cells per m2 (23.5
billion) was not met for technical reasons). Two HLA-upregulation interventions
were performed as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 10 including injection of
intralesional interferon-beta 0.1 mg once into a single tumor lesion prior to first
cycle of infusions, and irradiation of a single pelvic lymph node with an 8 Gy
radiation fraction prior to second infusion. Cells were of two specificities: HLA-
B35/FPW, and HLA-A0201 recognizing the “KLL” epitope39, however only HLA-
A0201 cells persisted.
Generation of tetramer. Allophycocyanin-conjugated MCPyV-specific antigen
pMHC multimers (FHCRC Immune Montoring Core Facility) were used to con-
firm purity of the cellular product as well as detect transferred CTL in PBMCs, with
a staining sensitivity of 0.05% of total CD8+ T cells19.
Isolation and expansion of MCC-specific CTLs. For the primary patient
described (2586-4), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected by
leukapheresis, and all ensuing ex vivo manipulations were performed in the clinical
Good Manufacturing Practices Cell Processing Facility at the FHCRC. Patient
PBMCs were collected by leukapheresis and depleted of CD25+ T cells to eliminate
regulatory T cells31. Cells were cultured with cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-
21) stimulated twice for 7–10 day cycles with autologous DCs pulsed with the HLA
B*3502-restricted Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) MCPyV-sT83-91 epitope
peptide FPWEEYGTL21,23. Cultures containing >5% specific CD8+ cells (as
assessed by tetramer binding) were GMP flow-sorted and then expanded to suf-
ficient numbers for infusion using two cycles of the Rapid Expansion Proto-
col21,23,40. Cell products bound the MCPyV sT-Ag epitope MCPyV-sT83-91
peptide-HLA tetramer and secreted IFN-gamma when exposed to the cognate
antigen (Supplementary Fig. 2).
For the validation patient (9245-3), identical methods were used, with the
exception that a second culture was also performed using the MCPyV-T antigen
(sT15-23 and LT15-23) peptide KLLEIAPNC as stimulus. This is restricted to HLA
A*0201, as previously described39. Cells of both specificities were mixed together
immediately prior to infusion in a 1:1 ratio.
Flow cytometry on patient peripheral blood samples. Blood samples were
collected at the indicated time points, PBMCs isolated through the research cell
bank at FHCRC by standard Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, and viably cryopreserved.
Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after permeabilization, fixation and staining
with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to CD4 (SK3; Becton
Dickinson), CD8 (3B5; Invitrogen), CD19 (H1B19; Becton Dickinson), CD16 (3G8;
Becton Dickinson), CCR7 (G043H7; Biolegend), CD45RO (UCHL1; Becton

 mers overlapping by 9)20, and responses detected with interferon gamma intra-
cellular cytokine stain.
TCR beta CDR3 sequencing. DNA was extracted from tetramer-sorted infusion
product and unsorted PBMCs using a Qiagen DNEasy Blood and Tissue kit per
manufacturers instruction. These samples and tumor biopsies were submitted to
Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA) for DNA amplification and sequencing of
TCRB CDR3 using the immunoSEQ platform41,42.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned
and baked per standard protocol.
MCPyV large T antigen was detected using the CM2B4 antibody (Santa Cruz,
dilution 1 :50) and HLA-ABC using clone EMR8-5 (MBL, dilution 1 :1500 for
slides from discovery patient and dilution 1 :8000 for slides from validation patient;
antibody lots titered on normal tissues with endothelial cells serving as on-slide
positive control)22,43. For multiplex immunohistochemistry, slides were dewaxed
and stained on a Leica Bond Rx stainer using Leica Dewax solution, antigen
retrieval, and antibody stripping and rinsing after each step (bond wash solution).
A high stringency wash was performed after the secondary and tertiary applications
using high-salt TBST solution (0.05 M Tris, 0.3 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20, pH
7.2–7.6). OPAL Polymer HRP Mouse plus Rabbit (PerkinElmer, Hopkington, MA)
was used for all secondary applications. Antigen retrieval and antibody stripping
steps were performed at 100 °C with all other steps at ambient temperature.
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H2O2 for 8 min followed by protein
blocking with TCT buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25% Casein, 0.1% Tween
20, pH 7.6 + /- 0.1) for 30 min. The first primary antibody (position 1) was applied
for 60 min followed by the secondary antibody application for 10 min and the
application of the tertiary amplification reagent (PerkinElmer OPAL fluor) for
10 min. The primary and secondary antibodies were stripped with retrieval solution
for 20 min before repeating the process with the second primary antibody (position
2) starting with a new application of 3% H2O2. Antibodies included CD8 (clone
144B; Dako; opal fluor 520, concentration 0.2 microgram/mL), CD56 (clone 123c3.
d5; Bio SB; opal fluor 540, 1 ug/mL), CD3 (clone SP7; Thermo, opal fluor 650,
concentration 1 :400), and HLA-DR (clone EP96; Bio SB; opal fluor 690;
concentration 0.125 ug/mL). Slides were removed from the stainer and stained with
Spectral DAPI (Perkin Elmer) for 5 min, rinsed for 5 min, and coverslipped with
Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
Slides were cured for 24 h at room temperature, then representative images from
each slide were acquired on PerkinElmer Vectra 3.0 Automated Imaging System.
Images were spectrally unmixed using PerkinElmer inForm software and exported
as multi-image TIFF’s for analysis. Quantitative image analysis was performed in
HALO software (Indica Labs, Corrales, NM). For each slide, three representative
sections were scored. CD56 staining readily identified tumor. Layers were manually
drawn for intratumoral (within tumor borders) and peritumoral (edge of tumor to
100 micron beyond tumor border) regions. Three sections were counted for each
slide and comparisons between time points were made using the Student’s t test.
Exome sequencing. For both patients 2586-4 (discovery) and 9245-3 (validation),
DNA was isolated from PBMC as germline control, and from tumor time point
pre-immunotherapy and at acquired resistance as tumor specimens (DNA from
frozen tumor specimens), using a Qiagen QIAAmp DNA extraction kit under
manufacturer’s recommended conditions. Quality was confirmed with spectro-
photometry and Qubit (Fisher Biosciences). For patient 2586-4 samples were
submitted for exome sequencing through the FHCRC Genomics Core. Library prep
was performed with standard procedures using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon
V6 and sequencing performed on an illumina HiSeq 2500 per Agilent recom-
mendations. Samples were aligned to hg19 reference using annovar44 and somatic
mutations determined using MuTect45. For patient 9245-3, samples were sub-
mitted for exome sequencing through the University of Washington Northwest
Clinical Genomics Laboratory research sequencing service. Library preparation was
with xGen technology and sequencing on an illumina HiSeq 4000 at 100x coverage.
Samples were aligned to hg19 with BWA46 and variants identified with GATK47 as
per the NCGL standard pipeline.
Generation of single cell tumor digests. Tumor material not required for clinical
pathology analysis was placed in RPMI. Tumor was mechanically minced with
scissors and forceps into small pieces and then resuspended in 20 mL freshly
prepared digestion medium (20 mL RPMI plus 0.002 g DNAse (Worthington
Biochemical) plus 0.008 g collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) plus 0.002 g
hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochemical) in a 10 cm dish. Digesting tumor was
incubated in 37 degree tissue culture incubator for 3 h with occasional manual
rocking. After incubation, tumor digest was strained through a 70 micron cell
strainer, cells were centrifuged, counted, and assessed for single cellularity and
viability, and resuspended in freeze medium (50% human serum, 45% RPMI, 5%
DMSO). Cells were frozen overnight at -80C in a styrofoam sandwich then
transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). For samples from patient 2586-4, cells
were thawed, washed, and labeled in a single cell fashion using the 10x genomics 3’
Chromium v2.0 platform24 as per manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparation
was performed as per manufacturer’s protocol with no modifications. Library
quality was confirmed with illumina TapeStation high sensitivity (evaluates library
size), qubit (evaluates dsDNA quantity), and KAPA qPCR analysis (KAPA Bio-
systems, evaluates quantity of amplifiable transcript). Samples were mixed in
equimolar fashion and sequenced on an illumina hiSeq 2500 “rapid run” mode
according to standard 10x genomics protocol.
For samples from patient 9245-3, scRNAseq was performed using the 10x
Genomics 5’ V(D)J and gene expression chromium platform, with cell washing,
barcoding, and library preparation as per manufactures instruction. Library quality
was confirmed as above. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000
(gene expression) and HiSeq 4000 (V(D)J) as per 10x genomics protocol for this
instrument.
Transcriptome alignment, barcode assignment and UMI counting. The Cell
Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 for the discovery and
validation patients respectively) were used to perform sample demultiplexing,
barcode processing and single-cell gene counting (http://10xgenomics.com/). First,
raw base BCL files were demultiplexed using the Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline into
sample-specific FASTQ files. Second, these FASTQ files were processed individu-
ally using the Cell Ranger count pipeline, which made use of the STAR software48
to align cDNA reads to the hg38 human reference genome (Ensembl) and the
Merkel cell polyomavirus sequence (HM011556.1). Aligned reads were then filtered
for valid cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Cell barcodes with
1-Hamming-distance from a list of known barcodes were considered. UMIs with
sequencing quality score >10% and not homopolymers were retained as valid
UMIs. A UMI with 1-Hamming-distance from another UMI with more reads, for a
same gene and a same cell was corrected to this UMI with more reads. Tumor and
PBMC samples were, respectively, aggregated together using the Cell Ranger aggr
pipeline resulting in two gene-barcode count matrices (tumor and PBMC) to be
used for downstream analyses. A correction for sequencing depth was also per-
formed during the aggregation19.
Biostatistical analysis—data normalization and correction. UMI normalization
was performed as in Zheng et al.19. Only genes with at least one UMI count
detected in at least one cell were retained for analysis. A library-size normalization
was performed for each cell. UMI counts were scaled by the total number of UMI
in each cell and multiplied by the median of the total UMI counts across cells. The
data were then log2-transformed and corrected for unwanted sources of variation
(number of detected UMIs) using the ScaleData R function as described in the
Seurat manual49. The corrected-normalized gene-barcode matrix was used as input
for dimension reduction and clustering analysis, whereas the normalized gene-cell
barcode matrix was used for the MAST analysis as described below.
Gene expression analysis: discovery patient tumor. Following sequence align-
ment and filtering, a total of 7431 tumor cells (2243 cells before and 5188 cells after
T cell therapy) were analyzed. The corrected-normalized gene-barcode matrix was
used to perform principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding (tSNE) analyses. First, the top 873 most variable genes
selected by Seurat (log-mean expression values greater than 0.0125 and dispersion
(variance/mean) greater than 0.5) were kept for PCA. The first top 10 principal
components (PCs) were then down selected for tSNE visualization. One thousand
iterations of tSNE using a perplexity value of 30 were performed. Cell classification
and clustering were done according to the expression of established MCC tumor
markers: NCAM1, ENO2, CHGA and KRT20 and also TILs markers. There were a
total of 1984 cancer cells before, and 5131 cancer cells at the acquired resistance
time point. Differential expression analysis between tumor cells before and after T
cell therapy was performed using the R package MAST50. The normalized gene-cell
barcode was used as input. The model included the cellular detection rate (CDR) as
a covariate to correct for biological and technical nuisance factors that can affect
the number of genes detected in a cell (e.g., cell size and amplification bias). Genes
were declared significantly differentially expressed at a false discovery rate (FDR) of
5% and a fold-change >1.3.
Gene expression analysis: discovery patient PBMC. Following sequence align-
ment and filtering, a total of 12,874 cells were analyzed. As for the tumor samples,
the corrected-normalized gene-barcode matrix was used to run PCA and t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analyses. First, the top 1203
most variable genes selected by Seurat (log-mean expression values greater than
0.0125 and dispersion (variance/mean) greater than 0.5) were kept for PCA. Again,
the first top 10 PCs were then down selected for tSNE visualization. One thousand
iterations of tSNE using a perplexity value of 30 were performed. Cell clustering
was performed using a graph-based clustering method implemented in Seurat
(FindClusters R function—share nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization
based clustering algorithm). Thirteen distinct clusters of cells were identified using
the top 10 PCs with a neighborhood size of 40 and resolution of 0.6. Based on the
clustering results, we removed cells belonging to three different distinct clusters
enriched for expression of red blood cell and megakaryocyte markers that were
likely the result of blood contamination (leaving total of 11,021 cells for analysis).

 Clusters were labeled according to enrichment of specific markers (FindMarkers R
function implemented in Seurat). This analysis resulted in nine distinct clusters:
CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD8+ effector T cells, B cells, NK cells, CD14+
monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, myeloid cells and dendritic cells. Differential
expression analysis between CD8+ and CD8+ effector T cells for the third time
point was performed using the R package MAST50 as described in the previous
section. R code is attached in Supplementary Data 3. Data submitted to NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession GSE 117988.
Gene expression analysis: validation patient. The aggregated corrected-
normalized gene-barcode matrix was used to first run PCA and t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analyses. The top 2450 most variable genes
selected by Seurat (log-mean expression values greater than 0.05 and dispersion
(variance/mean) greater than 0.5) were kept for PCA. The top 10 PCs were used for
tSNE visualization. One thousand iterations of tSNE using a perplexity value of 50
were performed. As described in the previous section, cell clustering was performed
using a graph-based clustering method implemented in Seurat (FindClusters R
function). Nineteen distinct clusters of cells were identified using the top 10 PCs
with a neighborhood size of 20 and resolution of 0.6. Clusters were labeled
according to enrichment of specific markers. R code is attached in Supplementary
Data 4, and data submitted to NCBI GEO, accession 118056.
Treatment with hypomethylating agents. Ex vivo tumor was mechanically dis-
sociated, filtered and cultured for 48 h in RPMI supplemented with 20% FBS and
pen/strep antibiotics. Untreated tumor was compared to tumor treated with 5-
azacytidine (Toronto Research Chemicals, concentration 1 μM final) or gamma-
interferon (final concentration 1000 IU/mL). RNA was isolated using directzol and
reverse transcription performed. qPCR was performed using RT2 SYBR mastermix
and commercially available primer sets to the indicated genes (Qiagen). Each
condition was run in triplicate and qPCR repeated twice.

Author Contributions
K.G.P. contributed to the conception, design, and implementation of immunohistochem-
istry, flow cytometry, exome, and scRNAseq experiments, and assembly of data. K.G.P. and
A.G. Chapuis wrote the manuscript. V.V., S.J.K. and R.G. conducted the biostatistical
analyses. M.P. and F.D.W. performed flow cytometry. D.S.H., W.J.V., and J.H.B. performed,
assisted, and provided critical infrastructure and guidance for scRNAseq, respectively. C.D.
C., N.V., H.T., A.G. Colunga, M.S.M., and R.K. acquired/processed the clinical specimens
and assisted in implementation of clinical trial. J.G.I. and D.M.K. identified the MCPyV-
sT83-91 epitope. C.Y. developed the protocol for cellular product preparation. R.H.P. was
the pathologist. P.D.G. contributed immunologic expertise and critical analysis. S.B. con-
tributed to the protocol development, patient treatment, and collection of clinical samples.
P.N. and A.G. Chapuis conceived the protocol and project, designed experiments, and
served as principal investigators on the trial. Funding: NIH-5R01CA176841 and NIH-
