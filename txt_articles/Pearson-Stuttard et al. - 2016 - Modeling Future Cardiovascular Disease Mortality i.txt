A
ge-standardized cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortal-
ity rates in the United States have declined substantially 
since the 1970s.1,2 Despite this decline, CVD still accounts 
for ≈6 million hospital admissions and 800 000 deaths each 
year.2 At the same time, massive shifts in population demo-
graphics have occurred, especially by age and race/ethnic-
ity. Current projections3 suggest that the US adult population 
(age, ≥25 years) will grow by ≈19% from 208 000 000 in 2012 
to ≈248 000 000 by 2030. These projections estimate that the 
population >75 years of age will increase by as much as 78%, 
from ≈19 000 000 to 34 000 000.
Clinical Perspective on p 978
These trends are expected to continue,4 with an 89% 
increase in the group ≥85 years of age predicted by 2030. 
These combined factors influence the total national burden of 
CVD, which is itself highly relevant for determining policies 
and resource planning. The CVD burden and mortality are 
Background—Accurate forecasting of cardiovascular disease mortality is crucial to guide policy and programming efforts. 
Prior forecasts often have not incorporated past trends in rates of reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality. This 
creates uncertainties about future trends in cardiovascular disease mortality and disparities.
Methods and Results—To forecast US cardiovascular disease mortality and disparities to 2030, we developed a hierarchical 
bayesian model to determine and incorporate prior age, period, and cohort effects from 1979 to 2012, stratified by age, 
sex, and race, which we combined with expected demographic shifts to 2030. Data sources included the National Vital 
Statistics System, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) single-year population estimates, and US Bureau 
of Statistics 2012 national population projections. We projected coronary disease and stroke deaths to 2030, first on the 
basis of constant age, period, and cohort effects at 2012 values, as is most commonly done (conventional), and then 
with the use of more rigorous projections incorporating expected trends in age, period, and cohort effects (trend based). 
We primarily evaluated absolute mortality. The conventional model projected total coronary and stroke deaths by 2030 
to increase by ≈18% (67 000 additional coronary deaths per year) and 50% (64 000 additional stroke deaths per year). 
Conversely, the trend-based model projected that coronary mortality would decrease by 2030 by ≈27% (79 000 fewer 
deaths per year) and stroke mortality would remain unchanged (200 fewer deaths per year). Health disparities will be 
improved in stroke deaths but not coronary deaths.
Conclusions—After prior mortality trends and expected demographic shifts are accounted for, total US coronary deaths are 
expected to decline, whereas stroke mortality will remain relatively constant. Health disparities in stroke but not coronary 
deaths will be improved but not eliminated. These age, period, and cohort approaches offer more plausible predictions 
than conventional estimates.

also unequally distributed in the population, with substantial 
disparities by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.5 Accurate projec-
tions of the future burden of CVD mortality, including cor-
responding disparities, are consequently of great importance 
and relevance to inform efficient and equitable policy making.
Several recent projections6–8 of the CVD burden, including 
one by the American Heart Association,9 have been reported. 
These generally incorporate expected population growth and 
aging but not past and recent declining trends in CVD mor-
tality rates. Such methods could lead to substantial overes-
timates of the burden of CVD and CVD mortality in future 
years. For example, Weinstein et al10 used similar methods in 
the late 1980s based on the assumption that current coronary 
heart disease (CHD) mortality rates would remain relatively 
constant and predicted that CHD prevalence, incidence, and 
mortality would increase as much as 40% to 50% by 2010 
as a result of population aging. These increases, however, 
were not observed. In reality, CHD deaths decreased by 40%, 
attributable to both non–medically related decreases in popu-
lation level risk factors and progress in clinical management 
such as primary and secondary drug treatment of risk factors, 
emergency responses, and hospital care.11 Incorporating past 
trends in CVD mortality, including differences in these trends 
by age, time period effect, or race/ethnicity and other relevant 
factors, is crucial for more accurate forecasting.
To address these gaps, we therefore forecasted future US 
CVD mortality to 2030, incorporating prior age, period, and 
cohort (APC) trends, stratified by age, sex, and race, alongside 
stratified population projections.
Methods
The methodology for our CVD projections has been described else-
where12 for the projection of future CHD trends in England and Wales. 
Briefly, we used a hierarchical bayesian APC (BAPC) model, which 
assumes that the logit of risk of death in a particular age group and 
period is a linear combination of an intercept, an age effect, a period 
effect, and a cohort effect (see section 2.1 and Figures I–III in the 
online-only Data Supplement). This method does not model sex or 
race effects directly, but we stratified the analysis by these subgroups 
to allow different CHD and stroke trends by sex and race/ethnicity.
Modeling Scenarios
Using this methodology, we modeled 2 contrasting scenarios to provide 
projected cardiovascular mortality up to 2030, stratified by age, sex, 
race, and CVD subtype (CHD and stroke). The first step was to estimate 
the APC effects between 1979 and 2012. Then in the first scenario, we 
held each of these components relatively constant at the values in their 
last year of observation (ie, 2012). We called these conventional projec-
tions because this method can be seen as a BAPC version of the indirect 
standardization method widely used to forecast mortality.6–8
In the second scenario, the trend-based projections, we allowed 
the APC effects to continue along their last observed trends (from 
1979–2012) and extrapolated the resulting trajectory to 2030. We 
then multiplied the resulting mortality rates from both scenarios by 
age- and sex-specific population projections from Census data to give 
the number of deaths.
Data Sources
CVD Mortality
We obtained data on the number of annual CVD deaths (International 
Classification of Diseases codes I00–I09, I11, I13, I20–I51, I60–I69) 
from 1979 to 2012 from the US National Vital Statistics System,13 
with consistent use of coding system throughout this period. These 
data are available and were evaluated after stratification by sex and 
10-year age groups (25–34 years, 35–44 years, etc, until ≥85 years). 
Data stratified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, that is, non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic, were available from 1990.
Population Demographics
Midyear estimates of the US population size were obtained from 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) single-year 
population estimates.3 Projections of the population size to 2030, 
stratified by age, sex, and race, were derived from the US Bureau of 
Statistics 2012 national population projections.14
We also used the 2012 US population by age and sex as the stan-
dard population to calculate age- and sex-adjusted mortality projec-
tions for both scenarios.
Implementation and Validation
Both model scenarios were implemented in the BAPC modeling 
prediction software.15 This software uses Markov chain Monte Carlo 
processes for the model estimation. We compared both scenarios 
by re-estimating the models using past data (1979–2001) to project 
mortality from 2002 to 2011 and to compare these projections with 
observed data in terms of their predictive deviance (ie, lower values 
of predictive deviance indicate a better fit; see Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Race Analysis
We also estimated conventional and trend-based projections and gener-
ated mortality projections up to 2030 for each race group individually: 
non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics. Racial CVD 
mortality disparities between the 3 groups were estimated with the use 
of population- and age-adjusted rate ratios comparing non-Hispanic 
blacks and Hispanic with non-Hispanic whites in 2012 and 2030.
APC Analysis
Finally, using the parameter estimates from conventional projec-
tions model, we provided a descriptive analysis of the APC effects on 
CVD mortality. Parameters from the trend-based projections cannot 
be interpreted in similar manner because of the imposed constraints 
(see the online-only Data Supplement). Age is a strong determinant 
of CHD mortality; cohort effects could capture generational differ-
ences in life-course factors by year of birth, and period effects capture 
temporal change in factors associated with development. The online-
only Data Supplement gives more details on the BAPC methodology. 
Schmid and Held15 provide more details about the software. 
Results
CVD Mortality Projections
As a result of population growth and increased aging, the con-
ventional model projected increases from 2012 to 2030 in total 
US CHD and stroke deaths of ≈18% and 50%, respectively, 
from 371 000 to 438 000 CHD deaths per year (95% credible 
interval, 353 000–551 000) and from 128 000 to 192 000 stroke 
deaths per year (148 000–250 000; Figure 1 and Table 1). This 
equated to 67 000 and 64 000 additional CHD and stroke 
deaths per year, respectively.
In comparison, in the trend-based model, total US CHD 
mortality (Figure 1) declined by ≈27% to 292 000 CHD 
deaths (95% credible interval, 181 000–489 000; Figure 1 and 
Table 1). These declines were predicted despite the growing 
and aging population, and this equates to some 79 000 fewer 
annual deaths by 2030. Declines in stroke mortality were non-
significant (≈200 fewer deaths), suggesting that stroke mortal-
ity might follow a constant trend.

CVD Mortality by Age and Sex
In contrast to aggregate reductions in mortality in the trend-
based projections, worryingly, CHD mortality is projected 
to increase in middle-aged (45–54 years) men and women 
(Figure 2). Furthermore, stroke crude mortality is projected 
to persist and in some cases increase in the population ≥65 
years of age (Figure 3). Comparing the projections to 2030 
of the 2 models indicates that the trend-based method proj-
ects fewer deaths in each age and sex group except for CHD 
deaths in young (age, 25–34 years) men and women, among 
whom 3% and 8% more deaths are projected compared with 
the conventional method. The largest differences in projected 
mortality between the 2 methods were in elderly women (age, 
≥85 years) for CHD, projecting ≈28 000 fewer deaths in the 
trend-based projections. However, the largest difference in 
projected stroke deaths is in elderly men (age, 75–84 years), 
for whom the trend-based method projects some 10 000 fewer 
deaths (32%) than the conventional projections.
Projected age- and sex-adjusted CVD mortality rates for 
both conventional and trend-based projection methods are out-
lined in Table 1. Briefly, they demonstrate ≈95 000 more CHD 
and 43 000 more stroke deaths in the conventional projections 
(416 000 [95% credible interval, 327 000–537 000] total CVD 
deaths in 2030) compared with the trend-based projections 
(278 000 [95% credible interval, 156 000–571 000] total CVD 
deaths).
Race Disparities in CVD Mortality
In a comparison of conventional and trend-based models, 
the latter offers a more conservative forecast. Therefore, 
we focus on the trend-based projections to analyze race 
Figure 1. Total number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths, 1979 to 2030; observed deaths, 1979 to 2012; and conventional 
projections and trend-based projections, 2013 to 2030. Crude number of deaths stratified by CVD subtype.

disparities. The largest disparity between non-Hispanic black 
and white exists in CHD (relative risk [RR], 1.40; 95% con-
fidence interval (CI), 1.36–1.44) in 1990 persisting, albeit 
reducing, to 2012 (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16–1.20; Table 2). 
Using our trend-based projections to 2030, we project dis-
parities between non-Hispanic blacks and whites to persist to 
2030 (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.54–2.70). The disparities between 
non-Hispanic black and white stroke deaths continue from 
1990 to 2012 (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08–1.13), but we proj-
ect this to increase in 2030 to and RR of 1.30 (95% CI, 
0.45–2.44; Table 2). The Hispanic populations appear to have 
persistently lower age- and sex-standardized CHD and stroke 
mortality rate ratios throughout the period of 1990 to 2030 
(Table 2). Hispanic CHD mortality is projected to continue to 
be lower than non-Hispanic white CHD mortality, worsening 
slightly from an RR of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.41–0.42) in 2012 to 
an RR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.19–1.09) in 2030. Stroke dispari-
ties between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white population are 
also projected to persist at similar levels.
Population-Adjusted Rate Ratios
Population-adjusted mortality rate ratios between races vary 
considerably by age. Disparities existed in 2012 throughout 
all age groups for CHD and stroke for men and women except 
the elderly (age, ≥85 years; Tables 3 and 4).
The largest disparity in stroke rates between non-Hispanic 
blacks and whites was seen in the middle-aged (45 to 54 
years; RR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.58–3.08 in men; RR, 3.19; 95% 
CI, 2.94–3.47 in women). Although persisting, this disparity is 
projected to lessen, particularly in women, by 2030 (men: RR, 
2.74; 95% CI, 1.09–5.67; women: RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.91–
3.98). A similar pattern could be observed across other age 
and sex groups (except in young Hispanic men). For CHD, 
disparities are projected to persist in most age groups in men 
but to improve in elderly women (age, ≥65 years; Tables 3 and 
4). The disparities, specifically between non-Hispanic blacks 
and whites, appear to generally reduce with age (Tables 3 and 
4). Hispanic Americans appear to have lower CHD and stroke 
mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites aggregate through-
out all age groups, except in young male stroke mortality. This 
is projected to persist and in many cases improve further still 
to 2030 (Tables 3 and 4).
Validation of the BAPC Model
We used observed data from 1979 to 2002 to project CVD 
mortality for the period of 2003 to 2012 and calculated pre-
dictive deviance. This is demonstrated in Figure 4, which 
shows our trend-based projections to be a substantially bet-
ter fit than conventional projections. Likewise, the predic-
tive deviance values from the trend-based projections are 
lower compared with the conventional projections through-
out the 10-year period (Table B in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Despite this finding, however, our trend-based method 
was generally a conservative projection for mortality in 
some age groups. Specifically, the observed mortality 
decline between 2003 to 2012 was steeper in individuals 
in late middle age and in elderly men and women (65–74 
and 75–84 years old) than the trend-based scenario pre-
dicted. To further validate our trend-based projections, 
we ran the model widely used by demographers, the Lee-
Carter model,16 for this same period to see if a similar phe-
nomenon was observed. Reassuringly, this result was also 
observed with the Lee-Carter model in the projection of the 
period of 2003 to 2012 (Figure IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The Lee-Carter model was also unable to cap-
ture the rapid mortality decline in middle-aged groups dur-
ing this period. This suggests that this recent acceleration 
of decline in mortality rates could be attributable to a new

the APC model projections.
APC Effects
The detailed results of the APC effect analysis are outlined 
in the Tables III and IV in the online-only Data Supplement. 
Briefly, by far the greatest contribution to CVD mortality 
was the age effect, followed by the period effect and then the 
cohort effect. This was consistent across races and ethnici-
ties; however, the cohort effect was minimal in non-Hispanic 
blacks and Hispanics. In CHD alone, the cohort effect was 
found to be equal to the period effect.
Discussion
We evaluated our trend-based projections against more 
conventional projections for US CVD mortality projec-
tion to 2030. The conventional projections, similar to those 
used in several recent published projections,6–9 assumed 
that mortality rates simply persist unchanged from 2012 to 
2030. This conservative projection suggests a substantial 
increase in CVD deaths of ≈18% (CHD) and 50% (stroke) 
resulting from population growth and aging. This is in line 
with previous projections by Heidenreich et al,9 who, using 
the projected demographic changes, predicted that ≈40% of 
the US population will have some form of CVD by 2030.

In contrast, our more plausible trend-based projections, 
accounting for recent declines in CVD mortality rates and 
assuming a similar trend onward, predict that CVD deaths 
may in fact decrease by 27% for CHD and remain stable 
for stroke. Our trend-based projections therefore suggest 
that the potential growing burden of projected population 
growth and demographic changes forecasted for the United 
States by the US Bureau of Statistics14 could be countered 
by rapidly declining CVD mortality rates. Our projections 
further suggest that the future burden of CVD mortality in 
the United States may have been overestimated by conven-
tional methods.
Our trend-based methods project a substantially smaller bur-
den of CVD mortality than recent projections from the American 
Heart Association9 and other published works that assume a rela-
tively constant mortality rate to 20208 and 2030.6 Huffman et al8 
 
reported that if trends in risk factors and mortality remained con-
stant, absolute deaths could increase by 12% in 2020, consistent 
with our conventional projections. Similarly, the Coronary Heart 
Disease Policy Model is a complex Markov model that simulates 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality.7 This model, assuming no 
significant change in risk factors or treatment and with mortality 
rates remaining relatively constant, predicts that CHD mortal-
ity could increase as much as 56% over the coming 30 years.

 Pearson-Stuttard et al  Modeling Future CVD Mortality in the US  973
The stark contrast between these previous projections and our 
projections can be accredited to our assumption (not unreason-
able) that recent mortality rate declines (stratified by age, sex, 
and race) might continue to 2030.
Roth et al17 recently quantified global CVD mortality in 
2013 compared with 1990. During this period, global CVD 
deaths increased by ≈41% (95% CI, 36.2–46.4) compared with 
a nonstatistically significant 4.7% increase in high-income 
North America. The global increase in CVD deaths was attrib-
uted mainly to population aging (55%) and population growth 
(25%). These results suggest that although population aging 
and growth are driving CVD mortality trends globally, in high-
income North America, declining age-specific CVD mortality 
rates are counteracting these demographic changes. This is 
consistent with our projections. Furthermore, our projections 
for US CVD mortality are broadly consistent with previous 
work by our group projecting CHD mortality for England and 
Wales to 2030.12 This analysis by Guzman Castillo et al12 pre-
dicts the declining CHD mortality rate in England and Wales 
to counteract projected demography changes while also find-
ing the trend-based method to be a better fit than the exten-
sively used Lee-Carter method.
Our trend-based projections were consistently a better fit 
than conventional projections for projecting CVD mortality 
from 2003 to 2012 across the majority of age, sex, and race 
groups and comparing the projections with observed mortality. 
Despite this, our trend-based projections were unable to cap-
ture the accelerating decline in mortality in elderly men during 
this period. Likewise, the validated and commonly used Lee-
Carter method was also unable to capture this accelerating 
decline in the elderly. This suggests that an unknown factor 
outside our model parameters could be driving this acceler-
ated decline in CVD mortality from 2003 to 2012. However, 
when projecting to 2030 ,we use all observed data to 2012, so 
it is likely that this unknown factor is better captured in these 
projections to 2030 than the validation period.
Further analysis of the rapidly declining mortality rates in 
the elderly could help inform policy makers as to how best to 
tackle the projected aging population. This decline could be 
attributable to period effects as previously seen in dramatic 
fluctuations in policy and systems change such as alcohol 
drinking, declining smoking prevalence, or salt or trans fat 
intake reduction and other similar improvements in the food 
supply. Similar period effects such as large increases in the 
prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity might have a cor-
responding time lag of up to 5 to 10 years; thus, recent rises 
may not yet be fully realized in CVD mortality. The presence 
of a cohort effect in white Americans, absent in other racial 
groups, is interesting. APC models developed for Australia18 
and New Zealand19 suggested the absence of any cohort effect, 
whereas conversely, models for Singapore20 and Norway21 
contrastingly found a cohort effect.
CVD race disparities exist, particularly between non-His-
panic blacks and non-Hispanic whites. From 1990 to 2000, 
the non-Hispanic white population shrunk, whereas the non-
Hispanic black population increased by 2% and the Hispanic 
population increased by as much as 58%.22 Given the dispari-
ties in CVD mortality by race, demographic changes could

have a substantial effect on the racial composition of future 
CVD cases, with important policy implications. However, 
previous projections of racial CVD disparities have largely 
neglected recent trends in mortality rates generally and by 
racial groups specifically. Our projections suggest, however, 
that CVD disparities persist in most cases (although with 
a high level of uncertainty, as illustrated by the wide WIs), 
despite aggregate reductions in CVD mortality in both abso-
lute and relative terms, albeit with some improvement in most 
subgroups. Specifically, age-adjusted stroke mortality rate 
ratios are projected to improve across almost all subgroups 
of non-Hispanic blacks compared with whites, but despite 
this, a disparity is projected to remain. Worryingly, however, 
disparities in younger men are projected to worsen. Although 
the data suggest the absence of disparities between older 
(age, ≥85 years) non-Hispanic blacks and whites, this could 
be attributable to a “natural selection” or differential survival 
bias from the underlying demography of the US population 
whereby a larger proportion of non-Hispanic whites live to 
older age and those non-Hispanic blacks who do so may be 
more affluent. This highlights the limitations of race as a mea-
sure of socioeconomic circumstance. Given the large mor-
tality reductions in CVD over the past 3 decades, we would 
expect this to result in a reduction of absolute disparities, but 
our projections suggest this may not be the case and predict 
relative CVD disparities to worsen across all subgroups of 
non-Hispanic blacks except the most elderly. Although we 
should applaud the efforts to reduce aggregate CVD mortal-
ity substantially in previous decades, the absence of improve-
ments in racial disparities urgently needs to be addressed by 
policy makers.
Although our results of current and projected dispari-
ties between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites are surpris-
ing (substantially lower mortality rates in Hispanics and for 
this to improve further), these estimates are consistent with 
the well-described “Hispanic paradox.”23,24 These previous 
analyses have demonstrated the difficulties in estimated 
CVD mortality in this group, showing that Hispanics are 
significantly underrecorded on death certificates, which 
leads to intangibly high life expectancies within this group 
when combined with self-reported Hispanic ethnicity from 
population estimates in the Census.23,24 The apparently low 
mortality rates observed and projected in the Hispanic pop-
ulation could also be affected by a healthy migrant effect. 
Indeed, such an uncertainty exists about the reported mor-
tality rate for Hispanics that they are often excluded from 
analyses.6
Strengths and Limitations
This study and its methods have strengths. The classic APC 
model allows mortality to be presented as trends over age 
at death, year of death ,and birth cohort while also allowing 
further heterogeneity to be modeled if required. The bayes-
ian aspect of the model increases the reliability and interpret-
ability of our results by including prior data such as results of 
a previous model or expert opinion to guide inference from 
current data. Using this information, the Bayesian method 
then estimates the probability distribution of the parameters, 
resulting in a full probability model that can be used to gen-
erate a probability distribution of possible future outcomes. 
Furthermore, bayesian models are unbiased with respect to 
sample size; hence, the model still performs well with smaller 
groups such as younger age groups.25
Our projections also have weaknesses. The projec-
tions require the use of population estimates (US Bureau of 
Statistics, 2012), which themselves have inherent assump-
tions about levels of fertility, migration, and mortality. These 
can provide challenges for demographers.26 In addition, the 
short series of data for race stratification (from 1990) is a 
potential weakness and led to initial noise in the initial pro-
jections of mortality. To reduce this, we used non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic race stratifications

only and excluded the “other races” group. Furthermore, 
our projections assumed that the APC effects components 
remain unchanged through 2030. Although the American 
Heart Association policy statement9 specifically projects 
CVD prevalence rather than mortality, mortality projec-
tions themselves are a key constituent of these projections. 
These and their methods are in line with the traditional 
projections that we model in our study. Occasional unpre-
dictable high-impact phenomena can dramatically change 
mortality rates with timings that are retrospectively unpre-
dictable.27 Examples include dietary changes in Poland and 
neighboring countries in the early 1990s that resulted in 
large, rapid decreases in CVD mortality15,28 and similarly 
rapid mortality decreases in Cuba in the 1990s. Lag times 
for such diet-associated reductions in CVD mortality were 
consistently <5 years,29,30 echoed by data from the World 
Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants 
in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) project.31
Public Health Implications
Our trend forecast suggests that is likely that the gains we 
obtained in the last 4 decades will persist well in the 21st cen-
tury. However, trends are not set in stone, and rapid changes 
can quickly reverse long-standing trends.32 Although previous 
work suggested that ≈44% and 47% of the 50% decline in US 
CHD mortality rates11 between 1980 and 2000 were attributable

to changes in risk factors and treatment, respectively, we do 
not project relative contributions to the projected reductions in 
CVD mortality in our trend-based model. As CVD mortality 
rates decline further, it is likely that the relative contributions 
of prevention and treatment may change, while the smaller 
burden of mortality will mean that existing interventions will 
have lower absolute effectiveness. Therefore, cost-saving inter-
ventions such as those fiscal policies at the population level 
will have increasing importance. Therefore, to maximize the 
population exposed to future measures to reduce CVD mortal-
ity, population-wide structural policies with universal cover-
age would likely be more successful than targeted policies.33,34 
Furthermore, it will be increasingly difficult to prevent addi-
tional deaths when baseline risk is declining. Although public 
health should have the dual purpose of promoting health gains 
in the population as a whole and reducing health inequalities,35 
national policies can have various degrees of coverage across 
the entire population. Benach et al36 outlined different public 
health policy approaches to reduce inequalities. “Proportionate 
universalism,” as highlighted by the UK Marmot Review,37 
aims to strike the balance between reducing inequalities 
through population-level policies targeting primary risk factors 
and universal coverage that acts to reduce existing inequali-
ties through the baseline gradient of these risk factors. Such

policies could reduce both nominal and relative CVD dispari-
ties between racial groups in the United States. Furthermore, 
as CVD mortality rates continue to fall, preventing or delaying 
each subsequent death with individual-based approaches may 
become increasingly more difficult and costly.
Conclusions
The United States and many other developed and developing 
countries are increasingly focusing on strategies to reduce the 
combined disease and economic burdens of CVD. Accurate 
projections, incorporating projected demographic changes 
accounting for recent trends in mortality, are thus crucial to 
better inform policy makers. Our trend-based model poten-
tially provides this through using an increasingly detailed 
understanding of CVD epidemiology.
In contrast to conventional projections, we project CVD 
mortality to continue to decline and thus counteract the aging 
and growing population. However, despite the large reduc-
tions in CVD, worrying race and ethnic disparities in mortal-
ity are likely to persist.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Accurate forecasting of cardiovascular disease mortality is crucial to guide policy and programming efforts. Prior forecasts 
have often not incorporated past trends in rates of reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality. This creates uncertainties 
about future trends in cardiovascular disease mortality and disparities. We forecasted US cardiovascular disease mortality 
and disparities to 2030. We developed a hierarchical bayesian model to determine and incorporate prior age, period, and 
cohort effects from 1979 to 2012, stratified by age, sex, and race, which we combined with expected demographic shifts to 
2030. We projected coronary disease and stroke deaths to 2030, first on the basis of constant age, period, and cohort effects 
at 2012 values, as is most commonly done (conventional), and then with the use of more rigorous projections incorporating 
expected trends in age, period, and cohort effects (trend based). We primarily evaluated absolute mortality. The conventional 
model projected total coronary and stroke deaths by 2030 to increase by ≈18% (67 000 additional coronary deaths per year) 
and 50% (64 000 additional stroke deaths per year). Conversely, the trend-based model projected that coronary mortality 
would decrease by 2030 by ≈27% (79 000 fewer deaths per year) and stroke mortality would remain unchanged (200 fewer 
deaths per year). Health disparities will be improved in stroke deaths but not coronary deaths. After prior mortality trends and 
expected demographic shifts are accounted for, total US coronary deaths are expected to decline, whereas stroke mortality 
will remain relatively constant. Health disparities by race in stroke but not coronary deaths will be improved but not elimi-
nated. These age, period, and cohort approaches offer more plausible predictions than conventional estimates.
