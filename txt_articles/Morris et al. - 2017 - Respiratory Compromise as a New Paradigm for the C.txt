Summary and Recommendations
Acute respiratory compromise describes a deterioration in respiratory function with a high likeli-
hood of rapid progression to respiratory failure and death. Identifying patients at risk for respi-
ratory compromise coupled with monitoring of patients who have developed respiratory compro-
mise might allow earlier interventions to prevent or mitigate further decompensation. The National
Association for the Medical Direction of Respiratory Care (NAMDRC) organized a workshop
meeting with representation from many national societies to address the unmet needs of respiratory
compromise from a clinical practice perspective. Respiratory compromise may arise de novo or
may complicate preexisting lung disease. The group identified distinct subsets of respiratory com-
promise that present similar opportunities for early detection and useful intervention to prevent
respiratory failure. The subtypes were characterized by the pathophysiological mechanisms they
had in common: impaired control of breathing, impaired airway protection, parenchymal lung
disease, increased airway resistance, hydrostatic pulmonary edema, and right-ventricular failure.
Classification of acutely ill respiratory patients into one or more of these categories may help in
selecting the screening and monitoring strategies that are most appropriate for the patient’s par-
ticular pathophysiology. Standardized screening and monitoring practices for patients with similar
mechanisms of deterioration may enhance the ability to predict respiratory failure early and
prevent its occurrence. Key words: respiratory compromise; respiratory failure; quality improvement.

 Introduction
This monograph introduces an approach to the common
and very serious clinical problem of respiratory compro-
mise encountered in hospitalized patients. Respiratory com-
promise is a deterioration in respiratory function that poses
a high risk of life-threatening respiratory failure. Various
authors have used the phrase “respiratory compromise” to
describe intensities of respiratory dysfunction ranging from
a chronic state of respiratory insufficiency1,2 to conditions
that require emergency resuscitation with mechanical ven-
tilation.3 This work, however, focuses on hospitalized pa-
tients who are at high risk for respiratory failure or death
but for whom such devastating complications are poten-
tially avoidable. Identifying patients in respiratory com-
promise and those in whom respiratory compromise is
worsening is a critical component of in-patient hospital
care. Only if this is effectively done can appropriate in-
terventions be instituted to avoid catastrophic events.
This monograph is the result of a project that emerged
from discussions among a group of interested pulmonary
specialist members of the National Association for the
Medical Direction of Respiratory Care (NAMDRC) that
led to the organization of a sentinel workshop meeting in
2015 with representation from many national societies to
address respiratory compromise from a clinical practice
perspective. The purpose of the workshop was to establish
the groundwork for further discussion and research fo-
cused on identifying respiratory compromise early and en-
acting interventions promptly to reverse the compromise
and thereby prevent respiratory failure. The workshop par-
ticipants included physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists,
and industry partners committed to the diagnosis and man-
agement of patients at risk of or already faced with respi-
ratory compromise. However, only the clinicians at the
workshop were members of the writing committee that
authored this manuscript, whereas the industry sponsors
identified were permitted only to ask questions and inter-
act informally with the participants at the conference.
The goals of the workshop were to: (1) define respira-
tory compromise and its determinants, (2) identify types of
patients most likely to experience respiratory compromise
duringhospitalization,and(3)recommendmonitoringstrat-
egies to prevent and to detect the occurrence and severity
of respiratory compromise early in its progression. The
goals were addressed after a review of pathologic and
pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to respiratory com-
promise. An overview of respiratory compromise and the
thoughts and recommendations of the invitational work-
shop participants are presented.
This monograph presents the overall framework of the
conference and begins with a general definition of respi-
ratory compromise. A description follows of how the par-
ticipants chose to categorize subsets of patients with a
clarification of some unique features. The many ways these
patients are or become vulnerable and eventually reveal
signs and symptoms of respiratory compromise are iden-
tified and discussed. The current challenges and an outline
of detection strategies for patients with respiratory com-
promise are initially offered. An in-depth thesis of each
subset of patients is then provided with the primary phys-
iologic mechanisms and derangements for each explained,
followed by the specific most important parameters to iden-
tify and monitor in the individual subsets.
Our ultimate hope is that this report will stimulate in-
terested parties to develop proposals that result in further
research. Only then can we as clinicians and scientists
produce meaningful protocols to reduce the incidence of

Definition of Respiratory Compromise
As noted in the introduction, respiratory compromise
describes a deterioration in respiratory function in which
there is a high likelihood of decompensation into respira-
tory failure or death but for which timely specific inter-
ventions (enhanced monitoring or therapies) might prevent
or mitigate decompensation. For example, timely antibi-
otic therapy decreases mortality in patients hospitalized
with moderately to highly severe community-acquired
pneumonia,4andearlynoninvasiveventilationreducesmor-
tality in those hospitalized with severe COPD.5 Although
respiratory compromise can be a chronic stable condition
for many years, in our discussions here, we focus on re-
spiratory compromise in the acute environment, where pa-
tients are at risk for deterioration of respiratory function,
potentially leading to respiratory failure and death. Ideally,
worsening respiratory compromise would be amenable to
specific interventions (enhanced monitoring or therapies)
that would prevent or mitigate further decompensation.
Patients fall, at any particular time point, on a continuum
of illness severity and risk. Respiratory compromise sug-
gests a change in respiratory status that entails a likelihood
of increased morbidity or mortality if deterioration is not
prevented or mitigated.
Respiratory failure occurs when patients have physio-
logically deteriorated to the point at which advanced life
support interventions are unequivocally necessary for re-
covery. Respiratory compromise can de-escalate as well as
escalate, either spontaneously or in response to interven-
tion(s). Thus, efficacious and efficient monitoring is es-
sential to determine where the patient with respiratory com-
promise is on the continuum of risk for respiratory failure.
Introduction of the term respiratory compromise is intended
to focus attention on the vulnerable population of patients
for whom early intervention might have the best potential
for avoiding respiratory failure. In addition to improving
outcomes, early recognition of respiratory compromise
might allow more efficient resource utilization and more
appropriate performance evaluation of health-care sys-
tems.6-9
Patients at Risk for Respiratory Compromise
Patients in acute care hospitals, particularly those with
respiratory conditions, are at risk for developing respira-
tory compromise. Respiratory failure requiring emergency
mechanical ventilation occurs in �44,000 patients per year
in the United States.3 In postoperative patients in the United
States, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Pro-
gram reports that 1.03% of all surgical patients require an
unplanned intubation postoperatively.10
Patients hospitalized with respiratory illnesses have
higher death rates than those hospitalized for any other
common condition.11 The development of in-hospital re-
spiratory failure is associated with a mortality of nearly
40%.3 The rates of in-hospital deaths in patients with re-
spiratory failure are more than twice as high as for myo-
cardial infarction and several times higher than for cancer,
stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal failure.11 The
high mortality associated with respiratory failure highlights
the rationale for recognition of respiratory compromise
and intervention before the development of respiratory
failure.
The likelihood of suffering from respiratory failure and
death is variable and dynamic. Patients admitted to hos-
pitals with preexisting respiratory conditions have rela-
tively high mortality rates.12,13 Patients admitted with acute
pneumonia have significant mortality rates,14,15 and those
admitted with aspiration have even higher rates of death.16
Death may not be due directly to the lung infection, since
�1 in 4 patients with community-acquired pneumonia de-
velop heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.17
Higher mortality rates may occur with health care-associ-
ated pneumonia, even when considering infections without
antibiotic resistance.18 Worsening respiratory compromise
is associated with substantial increases in mortality for
patients with viral respiratory infections,19 neutropenia,20
and hematological malignancies.21 Acute respiratory fail-
ure from either acute lung injury or cardiogenic pulmonary
edema also is associated with a high risk of death in the
months after hospitalization.22
Although respiratory compromise may develop de novo
during hospitalization in patients without preexisting lung
disease, in other patients, it develops as a complication of
chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD. Patients hos-
pitalized with severe exacerbations of COPD have partic-
ularly high mortality rates.23 The tools for identifying,
monitoring, and intervening in respiratory compromise in
the setting of preexisting disease subsets may be different
from the tools used in de novo respiratory compromise.
For example, the likelihood of death during admission for
COPD exacerbation reflects the underlying disease sever-
ities24,25 as well as the presence of coexisting cardiovas-
cular diseases.25 Conversely, COPD is a common and dan-
gerous comorbidity in patients with chronic heart failure.26
A variety of non-respiratory conditions also place pa-
tients at risk for respiratory failure and death. Procedural
sedation and other anesthetic approaches entail suppres-
sion of ventilation and reduced airway protection to some
degree and, therefore, can cause respiratory compromise
during the perioperative period. Postoperative patients are
susceptible to respiratory failure from opiate-induced re-
spiratory depression and immobility-induced pulmonary

 embolus or atelectasis. Neurological impairment likewise
increases the risk for respiratory failure from reduced mo-
bility and/or altered ventilatory control mechanisms. Pa-
tients who do not have respiratory conditions upon admis-
sion to an acute care hospital can move from no risk to
respiratory compromise due to a newly developed condi-
tion, incidental procedures, or treatment.
The Current Challenge of Respiratory Compromise
Integral to the concept of respiratory compromise is the
likelihood that alterations in a patient’s normal respiratory
condition or in one’s stable chronic respiratory condition
will lead to morbidity or mortality, which depends on both
the severity of the acute illness and on its associated risks.
Although they are related, severity and risk may lead to
different strategies for surveillance, diagnosis, and treat-
ment. In this discussion, severity implies the level of de-
terioration that develops during the continuum of a disease
process. The progression of the natural history of the dis-
ease leads to adverse outcome(s) (eg, the development of
hypercarbic respiratory failure during a COPD exacerba-
tion) (Fig. 1). Risk refers to the probability of a new prob-
lem that is not currently present but to which patients’
conditions make them vulnerable (eg, aspiration pneumo-
nia in a patient treated with high-dose analgesics or sed-
atives) (Fig. 2).
Recognition of respiratory compromise on the basis of
both severity and risk is a critical step in the development
of preventive strategies and surveillance systems to iden-
tify respiratory compromise changes early and thus help to
prevent respiratory failure and death. Increased attention,
observation, and therapeutics substantially improve the
probability of survival in deteriorating patients28; delay of
such interventions for patients developing acute respira-
tory failure increases the chances of death.29 On the other
hand, most interventions (eg, aggressive respiratory secre-
tion clearance30) require additional resources that are not
feasible to provide to the majority of in-patients. It may
not be straightforward to determine which patients are in
sufficient jeopardy to warrant resource-intensive interven-
tions.
There are examples of clinically validated data to help
recognize respiratory compromise on the basis of the se-
verity of the underlying conditions and the risk of deteri-
oration. Standard clinical parameters, such as vital signs
and basic laboratory tests, are of course useful.31-33 In
addition, risk adjustment models have been validated for
predicting outcome across a broad range of patients with
and without preexisting respiratory illnesses.34-40 Because
of the especially high risk inherent to worsening of acute
respiratory compromise, data relevant to gas exchange and
the need for respiratory support are particularly applica-
ble.41
Thorough assessment of severity and risk may require
consideration of several different models. Respiratory com-
promise may affect heterogeneous categories of patients,
with or without preexisting respiratory diseases and con-
ditions. Data applicable to one condition may not predict
outcomes in a different one. For example, numerous mod-
els have been clinically validated to gauge the severity of
community-acquired pneumonia.42-48 However, the crite-
ria recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of
America and the American Thoracic Society to estimate
the severity of community-acquired pneumonia49 are much
less accurate when applied to community-acquired pneu-
monia that is related to aspiration.16 The pneumonia mod-
els differ from the clinically validated models applicable
Fig. 1. Severity in patients with respiratory compromise. COPD is
used as an example of the effect of worsening disease severity on
mortality. As the manifestations of the disease become progres-
sively more severe, the mortality continuously increases. ICU ad-
mission often occurs after the condition has deteriorated to the
extent that mechanical ventilation is necessary.27
Fig. 2. Risk in patients with respiratory compromise. Analgesia-
induced loss of airway control is used as an example of the effect
of increasing disease risk on mortality. As the condition worsens,
specific events (aspiration in this example) may occur that incre-
mentally increase mortality. ICU admission often occurs after the
catastrophic event has occurred.27

 to exacerbations of COPD,50-53 which, in turn, are dissim-
ilar from the validated models to predict outcome from
acute pulmonary embolism54,55 or hemoptysis.56 Respira-
tory problems of different etiologies may require different
models to predict the risk of death and determine which
patients are at sufficient risk to warrant intervention.
The challenge at hand is the need for early recognition
of patients who move along the continuum of severity
and/or risk into a state of respiratory compromise. If cli-
nicians fail to recognize a change in status early, patients
will probably deteriorate and perhaps experience respira-
tory failure. The time span of progression can be quite
variable, from minutes to days. Current processes that are
utilized to recognize changes in patient status are visual
monitoring, or intermittent (spot) checks, by clinicians and
continuous monitoring by electronic devices. Neither ap-
proach will prevent or mitigate worsening respiratory com-
promise in every case, but either (or both) can help in
manycases.Staffingratiosprecludecontinuousvisualmon-
itoring at the bedside in most areas of the hospital. A
patient can deteriorate rapidly in an interval between fre-
quent spot checks (eg, a patient can aspirate moments after
the clinician leaves the bedside). Although electronic de-
vices monitor continuously and emit warning signals when
preset parameters are exceeded, most devices in clinical
use today monitor only a single or very few parameters. A
pulse oximeter, for example, will not detect a rising carbon
dioxide level in an apneic patient on supplemental oxygen
therapy until oxygenation or perfusion has been seriously
compromised. On the other hand, if alarms are too fre-
quent, alarm fatigue will set in, and signals will be ig-
nored. Thus, a current challenge is to optimize approaches
to prevention and early detection of respiratory compro-
mise that benefit patients effectively and efficiently.
Rapid Response Teams
Rapid response teams were created to facilitate the rec-
ognition and treatment of patients at the highest risk of
deterioration.57 The rapid response team strategy plays a
significant role in the rescue of respiratory patients, since
a large proportion of rapid response team interventions are
respiratory in nature.58 The effect of rapid response teams
is controversial; earlier studies were disappointing,59,60
whereas later studies showed a beneficial effect on mor-
tality or other important outcomes.58 The inconsistencies
among reports may be due to the “striking degree of vari-
ation” observed in how care is delivered among systems.58
Whatever the current benefits are, there is an opportunity
to update the triggers for rapid response team activation
from the relatively simple clinical parameters commonly
used (breathing frequency, heart rate, blood pressure, men-
tal state, and the nebulous “staff worried” criterion)57 to
ones that reflect the stratification of severities and risks
characteristic of respiratory compromise in specific patient
populations.
Detection Strategies for Specific Types of
Respiratory Compromise
Effective prevention, early detection, and intervention
for respiratory compromise may be guided by an under-
standing of the varied mechanisms by which respiratory
homeostasis is maintained and by identifying the most
common mechanisms by which it deteriorates. Sophisti-
cated algorithms that monitor clinically validated data re-
flecting those mechanisms might improve the ability to
intervene early in patients with deteriorating respiratory
conditions. Individual algorithms could then be tailored
toward specific patient groups who have specific patho-
physiologic patterns and trajectories in common. We pro-
pose that monitoring and interventional strategies focus on
the patterns of deterioration that are characteristic of the
various types of respiratory compromise that we describe.
Respiratory homeostasis depends on the complex inter-
play between ventilatory patterns, lung volume, ventila-
tion/perfusion (V
˙ /Q
˙ ) matching, and right-ventricular func-
tion. Respiratory compromise occurs as a result of
dysfunction in one or more homeostatic mechanisms and
the inability of others to compensate adequately. Although
respiratory failure is caused by a heterogeneous group of
processes, there are subsets of patients who manifest sim-
ilar patterns of deterioration (Table 1). Patients within those
subsets might benefit from similar monitoring approaches
and interventions.
Respiratory Compromise Due to Impaired Control
of Breathing
Physiological Derangement
The normal ventilatory pattern arises as the brainstem
processes various inputs that affect its pacemaker function.
Neural inputs include conscious and unconscious stimuli,
stress responses, and state of alertness. The brainstem also
responds to mechanical input from lung stretch and irritant
receptors. The chemical properties of the blood affected by
gas exchange (ie, PaO2, PCO2, and pH) also have powerful
effects on breathing frequency and depth. The brainstem
output occurs through the phrenic nerves to the diaphragm
as well as through nerves that control other thoracic re-
spiratory muscles. Through intricate control of ventilatory
rate, tidal volume, flow patterns, and the resulting inspi-
ration and exhalation times, the respiratory system main-
tains adequate PO2 and pH while minimizing the metabolic
work performed.
Respiratory compromise may occur from impaired
ability to control ventilation in patients with brainstem

 dysfunction due to central nervous system injury, phar-
macologic/toxic depressants, metabolic disorders, and
sleep-associated breathing disorders. Patients with neuro-
muscular weakness due to disease, toxins, or injuries also
are unable to optimally control ventilation. In patients with
respiratory compromise due to impaired control of breath-
ing, hypoventilation, erratic breathing patterns, or both
may reduce alveolar ventilation (V
˙ A). Hypercarbia and
acidosis occur as a direct result of the fall in V
˙ A. Blood
deoxygenation occurs as hypoventilation worsens, although
supplemental oxygen may prevent hypoxemia and hinder
detection of the problem until hypoventilation is severe.
Apart from hypoventilation itself, conditions associated
with respiratory compromise due to impaired control of
breathing may be complicated by direct effects on the lung
itself. For example, immobility and loss of muscle tone
encourage atelectasis. Body malpositioning may also alter
lung perfusion patterns, causing V

poxemia.
Severe sleep-disordered breathing is a variation of re-
spiratory compromise due to impaired control of breathing
that may warrant special monitoring and therapeutic con-
siderations.Theapneasandhypopneasresultingfromsleep-
related inhibition of the central drive to breathe, develop-
ment of upper-airway obstruction, or a combination of the
two may lead to reduced V

acidosis. If the arousal reflex fails further, either as a result
of the disorder itself or because of other illnesses or med-
ications,thenhypoxemiaandrespiratoryacidosismayprog-
ress to respiratory failure and even cardiopulmonary col-
lapse.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
Due to Impaired Control of Breathing
Patients who are particularly likely to develop respira-
tory compromise due to impaired control of breathing in-
clude those with postoperative sedation, procedural seda-
tion, central nervous system injury, neuromuscular disease,
or sleep apnea (central or obstructive) and those given
opioids or related respiratory suppressant drugs. Respira-
tory compromise due to impaired control of breathing is
characterized by hypoventilation with reduced breathing
frequency and tidal volume, which results in hypercarbia
and hypoxemia. It may manifest signs of altered mental
status or behavior changes, reduction in the variability of
the breathing frequency or the heart rate, or changes in
blood pressure (up or down). Although somewhat difficult
to quantify, inappropriate somnolence and markedly de-
creased breathing effort may represent early signs of re-
spiratory compromise, so patients at risk for respiratory
compromise due to impaired control of breathing should
undergo careful physical examination at regular intervals.
Respiratory compromise in patients at risk for hypoven-
tilation may be identified most easily by the clinical fea-
tures of CO2 narcosis. Unexplained or new, even subtle
mental status change should prompt clinicians to consider
an arterial blood gas measurement. Waiting for more ex-
treme hypersomnolence is likely to next be met with un-
arousability and potential need for aggressive ventilatory
intervention, including immediate intubation. Because hy-
poventilation may sometimes be misdiagnosed as COPD,61,62
the possibility of respiratory compromise due to impaired
control of breathing should be considered in patients with
hypercarbia but without overt signs of airway obstruction.
The combination of hypoxemia and a body mass index
�35 kg/m2 is suggestive of obesity hypoventilation.63 Co-
morbidities such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonal-
coholic steatohepatitis, cardiac dysfunction, and pulmo-
nary hypertension are especially prominent among those at
highest risk for respiratory failure.62
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
Strategies for monitoring patients with respiratory com-
promise due to impaired control of breathing should ide-
ally include continuous and accurate measurement of gas
exchange. Monitoring of blood oxygenation is fairly rou-
tine; however, changes in oxygenation are often the fairly
abrupt end sequelae of compromised control of breathing.
Other available monitoring options appropriate for this
subset of respiratory compromise include continuous mea-
surement of blood pressure, electrocardiogram, transcuta-
neous PCO2 estimation, and end-tidal capnometry. How-
ever, additional tools may need to be developed for an
earlier detection of respiratory compromise. Air-flow mea-
surement by a thermistor may monitor the depth and fre-
quency of breathing. Actigraphy may provide an indica-
tion of a patient’s general activity as a surrogate for the
level of consciousness. Periodic arterial blood gas mea-
surements, although not continuous, will provide unequiv-
ocalevidenceofhypercarbiaandhypoxemia.Clinicalscales
to measure consciousness, sedation, delirium, pain, and
risk for sleep apnea may detect decreases in central ven-
tilatory drive.
Respiratory Compromise Due to Impaired
Airway Protection
Physiological Derangement
Even in the absence of overt hypoventilation, patients
with respiratory compromise due to impaired control of
breathing are in particular danger if poor airway protection
leads to aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia carries a high
risk of death, and its prevention warrants special consid-

 eration in respiratory compromise due to impaired control
of breathing, separate from the management of gas ex-
change impairment. Aspiration pneumonia incurs its own
separate mechanisms that lead to hypoxemia, acidosis, and
mechanical loading; once aspiration occurs, the patient is
more appropriately considered to be in the category of
respiratory compromise from parenchymal lung disease,
which we describe below.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
Due to Impaired Airway Protection
Patients with neurological, gastrointestinal, or upper-
airway anatomical disorders that affect the ability to prop-
erly swallow and effectively cough may be in respiratory
compromise due to impaired control of the upper airway.
These disorders are most likely to affect the ability to
properly swallow and effectively cough. Although there is
overlap in manifestations of respiratory compromise in
patients with neuromuscular depression and those with
pulmonary aspiration, the latter is associated with tachypnea,
increased breathing effort, and hypocarbia as the parenchy-
mal insult dominates.
In patients with neurologic dysfunction, respiratory com-
promise from inability to control the airway may be ini-
tially manifested as dysphagia, which is associated with
specified, localized cerebrovascular accidents. Deep cere-
bral infarcts, especially in the primary somatosensory, mo-
tor, motor supplementary, and orbitofrontal regions, are
predictive of dysphagia, as are infarcts within the caudate,
putamen, and basal ganglia.64 Awareness of stroke inci-
dence in these anatomical locations may identify those
individuals at risk and help identify those who would
benefit from additional monitoring and intervention. De-
mentia and Parkinson’s disease are also risk factors for
aspiration pneumonia because of their neuromuscular se-
quelae.65 Other neurologic disorders, such as myasthenia
gravis, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis, predispose to aspiration and subsequently aspiration
pneumonitis because of a significant reduction in respira-
tory muscle compliance and overall mobility. Dehydration
is an indicator of poor oral intake and impaired feeding
mechanisms, which may predispose this population to as-
piration.65
In addition to focal neurologic and neuromuscular dys-
functions, alterations in consciousness from medication
use and drug abuse increase the risk of aspiration. For
example, escalating doses of antipsychotic medications in-
crease the risk of swallowing difficulty.64 Chronic opioid
dependence may also result in delayed gastric emptying
and a higher risk of aspirating residual gastric contents.66
Alcoholism, seizures, anesthesia, and head trauma pro-
voke an altered level of consciousness and serve as addi-
tional risk factors for aspiration.
Respiratory compromise from inability to control the
airway may occur because of gastrointestinal risk factors,
such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Use of acid sup-
pressants enhances the risk for aspiration pneumonia in the
event of aspiration, since these medications increase bac-
terial load by reducing the acidity of the stomach. Respi-
ratory compromise from inability to control the airway
may complicate radiation treatment to the head and neck.
Radiation-induced tissue damage may cause loss of sen-
sation in the larynx accompanied with failed epiglottic
inversion and poor laryngeal elevation with failed clear-
ance of aspirate.66 Other disorders of the esophagus and
gastrointestinal tract (eg, tumors, strictures, fistulae, acha-
lasia, and obstruction) predispose individuals to aspiration.
Additional gastrointestinal disorders include vomiting, ob-
struction, ascites, gastroparesis, and ileus.
Respiratory compromise in patients following aspira-
tion may be identified by findings associated with either
aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. Aspira-
tion pneumonitis, a chemical injury with subsequent in-
flammatory response that occurs after aspiration of gastric
contents, presents clinically within hours of aspiration with
coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, tachypnea, leukocytosis, hy-
poxemia, and perhaps bloody or frothy secretions.67 As-
piration pneumonia from inhalation of oropharyngeal con-
tentsoccursin5–15%ofpatientsdiagnosedwithpneumonia
and carries an increased mortality risk of 15–21%.16,68,69
Respiratory compromise from aspiration pneumonia pres-
ents as tachypnea, cough, fever or hypothermia, tachycar-
dia, hypocarbia, and hypoxemia. Changes in breath sounds
are dependent on patient position at the time of aspiration:
If recumbent, decreased breath sounds and/or rales may be
heard in the posterior upper lobes and apical segments of
the lower lobes; if semi-recumbent or upright, altered aus-
cultation findings are likely to be heard in the basal seg-
ments of the lower lobes.67
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
Monitoring of patients in respiratory compromise due to
impaired control of the upper airway may include repeated
evaluations of the level of consciousness and the ability to
chew, seal the lips, and swallow.70 Patients with compro-
mised control of breathing may require regular assessment
of neurologic function with intervention when the patient
crosses the threshold at which risk for aspiration and loss
of airway control becomes unacceptably high. The com-
monly utilized threshold value of the Glasgow coma scale
of 8 is a fairly blunt instrument and does not account for
additional patient factors such as volume and tenacity of
airway secretions. In addition, transient episodes of respi-
ratory status deterioration, even if they are brief and self-
limited, may be warning signs of subsequent respiratory

 failure. Finally, observers such as family members may
provide important information about changes in conscious-
ness and ventilatory drive in patients with respiratory com-
promise due to impaired control of breathing.
Respiratory Compromise Due to Parenchymal
Lung Disease
Physiological Derangement
The volume of the lungs depends on both the activity of
the ventilatory muscles (or of mechanical support devices)
and mechanical factors determining functional residual ca-
pacity (FRC) (ie, volume of the lungs in the resting state).
Balance between the pressure/volume relationship (com-
pliance) of the chest wall and the same relationship within
the lung determines the volume of the FRC. Various path-
ological conditions, such as COPD, ARDS, and lung fi-
brosis impose characteristic changes on lung compliance
that affect FRC.
Gas exchange depends on V
˙ A, which is determined by
the total amount of ventilation (V
˙ E) minus the ventilation
that occurs without gas exchange (ie, dead-space ventila-
tion [V
˙ D]). Whereas the conducting airways normally ac-
count for about 2 mL/kg of “anatomic” V
˙ D, lung pathol-
ogy can substantially increase V
˙ D. Gas exchange also
depends on V
˙ /Q
˙ matching and diffusion across alveolar-
capillary membranes.
Parenchymal lung disease may cause respiratory com-
promise through a number of related mechanisms. In re-
spiratory compromise due to parenchymal lung disease,
lung compliance commonly decreases, which causes a fall
in the FRC. High metabolic work is required to overcome
the increased elastic recoil of the lung and maintain ven-
tilation. Imbalance between the work required to breathe
and the patient’s capacity for metabolic work is mani-
fested by rapid, shallow breathing. The disordered breath-
ing pattern increases the V
˙ D/V
˙ E and decreases V
˙ E. The
combination of the two may compromise V
˙ A to cause
hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. However, when pa-
renchymal lung disease causes respiratory compromise,
the predominant defect is commonly the gas exchange
impairment from the parenchymal disease itself. Alveolar
inflammation, infection, edema, and alveolar collapse cause
profound V
˙ /Q
˙ mismatch and physiological shunting. In
fact, during respiratory compromise induced by parenchy-
mal lung disease, compensatory hyperventilation (despite
the metabolic cost) may occur early and maintain blood
oxygenationtemporarily,especiallywhensupplementalox-
ygen is supplied. Maintenance of blood oxygenation in the
early stages of respiratory compromise due to parenchy-
mal lung disease may mask the increasing alveolar-arterial
oxygen gradients that portend impending respiratory fail-
ure.
Increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to alveolar
hypoxemia may complicate respiratory compromise due to
parenchymal lung disease. Right-ventricular strain and dil-
atation can decrease cardiac output. As a result, both V
˙ /Q
˙
matching and systemic oxygen delivery may be further
impaired.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
Due to Parenchymal Lung Disease
In addition to patients with preexisting parenchymal lung
disease, patients likely to develop respiratory compromise
include patients with pneumonia and with other infections
associated with the systemic inflammatory response syn-
drome. Preexisting comorbidities, such as diabetes, stroke,
heart failure, and immune compromised states, increase
the risk of respiratory compromise due to parenchymal
lung disease. In the appropriate populations, respiratory
compromise due to parenchymal lung disease may be rec-
ognized by deterioration in gas exchange or by increases
in the effort required to sustain ventilation. In the presence
of respiratory deterioration, increases in radiographic lung
opacity confirm respiratory compromise due to parenchy-
mal lung disease.
Respiratory compromise in patients with parenchymal
lung disease may be identified by the development of phys-
iologic aberrations, such as hypoxemia, needing oxygen
supplementation, and tachypnea. There are fairly well de-
fined criteria for the identification of compromised pa-
tients with acute parenchymal disease. For example, the
lung injury prediction score can identify compromised pa-
tients at risk for the development of ARDS.71 The score,
an aggregate measure of predisposing conditions, such as
sepsis and shock, with risk modifiers, such as alcohol,
smoking, hypoalbuminemia, oxygen supplementation
(�0.35), and tachypnea (�30 breaths/min), effectively dis-
criminates between high- and low-risk patients. Acute re-
spiratory decline in patients with chronic parenchymal lung
disease is characterized by worsening hypoxemia and dys-
pnea, often accompanied by a cough. A majority of pa-
tients with fibrotic lung disease hospitalized with these
findings are likely to be experiencing an exacerbation of
their underlying lung disease.72-75 These patients should be
recognized early because they have an overall high hos-
pital mortality that warrants timely and accurate prognos-
tic assessment as well as close monitoring for the devel-
opment of respiratory failure.73,74
Once respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventila-
tion or mechanical ventilation occurs, short-term mortality
becomes even higher.76 Other factors associated with in-
creased mortality include male sex, increased age, precap-
illary pulmonary hypertension, and right-heart failure.74,77
Specific underlying diagnoses, such as idiopathic pulmo-
nary fibrosis and connective tissue disease-related paren-

 chymal lung disease, also portend a worse prognosis.78
High-resolution chest computed tomography findings, such
as diffuse ground glass opacities and honeycombing, are
also associated with worse prognosis.79,80
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
Patients with respiratory compromise due to parenchy-
mal lung disease may be monitored continuously for
changes in breathing frequency and for decreases in pulse
oximetry or oxygen saturation. Because administration of
supplemental oxygen may mask the hypoxemic effects of
parenchymal lung disease, this type of respiratory com-
promise is best monitored longitudinally by considering
the increases in oxygen supplementation required to
maintain adequate oxygenation. Decreases in mental sta-
tus in the appropriate patient population may reflect the
systemic effect of lung inflammation and inadequate
oxygen delivery.
Respiratory Compromise Due to Increased
Airway Resistance
Physiological Derangement
Respiratory compromise due to increased airway resis-
tance adds greatly to the work required for ventilation.
Dynamic airway collapse in diseases such as asthma or
COPD increases resistance predominantly during exhala-
tion, which decreases tidal volume and V
˙ E. Air trapping
occurs as the balance between airway resistance and alve-
olar recoil favors retention of alveolar air at the end of
exhalation. Air trapping may in fact worsen as V
˙ E is in-
creased by tachypnea. The FRC is increased, which im-
pairs the efficiency of the diaphragm and other respiratory
musculature and decreases inspiratory capacity. V
˙ D mark-
edly increases, which, along with the decrease in V
˙ E, de-
creases V
˙ A and causes hypoxemia and respiratory acido-
sis.
The patient initially compensates by shortening the in-
spiratory time and allowing more time for exhalation. As
the condition deteriorates, the patient feels more dyspneic,
and V
˙ E must be maintained by increasing the breathing
frequency, which unfortunately increases the amount of air
trapping and V
˙ D/V
˙ E. Respiratory failure ensues as the ex-
hausted patient becomes progressively bradypneic.
The hemodynamic effects of intrinsic PEEP from alve-
olar air trapping commonly complicate respiratory com-
promise due to increased airway resistance. Positive pres-
sure within the alveoli is transmitted to the intrathoracic
vasculature, decreasing venous return and lowering right-
ventricular stroke volume. The reduction in cardiac output
further limits oxygen delivery and can result in catastrophic
cardiac failure.
A variant of respiratory compromise due to increased
airway resistance occurs if the upper airways are severely
obstructed due to edema, laryngospasm, stenosis, or col-
lapse of floppy tracheal segments. The primary problem in
this variant of respiratory compromise is the increased
work required to sustain ventilation through the narrowed
airway. The patient may appear to compensate well, since
increased work may maintain ventilation and oxygenation
despite high airway resistance. However, the situation de-
teriorates rapidly if the airway obstruction is sustained or
progressive, since a relatively small decrease in airway
diameter may raise the airway resistance to levels that are
intolerable. Unfortunately, the obstruction itself may limit
the options available for airway support if the deterioration
is untreated until this point.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
Due to Increased Airway Resistance
Patients with diagnoses of COPD, asthma, or other types
of airway obstruction who are hospitalized for any reason
are at risk for respiratory compromise due to increased
airway resistance. The likelihood to develop respiratory
compromise is highest if exacerbation of the obstructive
lung disease itself is the reason for hospitalization. How-
ever, hospitalization of obstructive disease patients for any
reason increases the risk for respiratory compromise from
increased airway resistance. This type of respiratory com-
promise can be recognized in the appropriate population
by increases above the patient’s baseline in the effort re-
quired to sustain normal ventilation. Clinical evaluation
and proper monitoring of increased ventilatory effort will
allow earlier recognition of respiratory compromise due to
increased airway resistance before the patient manifests
deteriorations in gas exchange.
The severity of a patient’s prior exacerbations is an
important clue to identify respiratory compromise in pa-
tients with an acute asthma episode. Previous ICU admis-
sions and mechanical ventilation episodes were important
predictors of respiratory failure in patients hospitalized
with asthma,81,82 whereas smoking status, duration of
asthma, presence of atopy, and types of out-patient inhaled
medications were not.81 Tachycardia upon presentation81,82
and hyperinflation on chest radiography81 are associated
with subsequent respiratory failure, as is respiratory aci-
dosis in the initial arterial blood gas measurement81,82 or
decreased oxygen saturation.82 Unfortunately, subjective
evaluation may be complicated because the ability to per-
ceive dyspnea tends to be lower among asthma patients at
high risk of respiratory failure.83 The presence of wheezes,
rales, prolonged exhalation phases of respiration, and ac-
cessory muscle use distinguished patients who required

506
RESPIRATORY CARE • APRIL 2017 VOL 62 NO 4
 hospitalization from those who did not but was not able to
predict subsequent respiratory failure.82
The patient’s previous history is also critical for the
identification of respiratory compromise in patients with
COPD exacerbation. In the case of COPD, however, the
risk of in-hospital respiratory failure depends on the pa-
tient’s baseline severity of obstruction (eg, FEV183,84 and
the modified Medical Research Council scale for chronic
dyspnea84), in addition to prior episodes of respiratory
failure.84,85 Among findings at presentation, hypoxemia or
hypercapnia,85 microbiologically confirmed respiratory
tract infection,84 and treatment with penicillins (vs fluoro-
quinolones, macrolides, and cephalosporins)84 signal a
higher rate of subsequent respiratory failure, whereas the
presence of cough is associated with lower risk.84 Other
demographic data, physiological parameters, and routinely
measured laboratory results (including the specific type of
respiratory pathogen identified) did not distinguish between
subsequent treatment failure and success.84 On the other
hand, the risk of subsequent failure does correlate mod-
estly with increases in laboratory markers of inflamma-
tion, such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, tumor ne-
crosis factor-�, and interleukin-1.84
The clinical presentation of respiratory compromise in
patients with acute large-airway obstruction can be acute
or subacute. Presenting symptoms include shortness of
breath, cough, and wheezing. Rapid deterioration in clin-
ical status can occur due to edema, secretions, or bleeding
in the setting of large-airway narrowing. Presentation will
depend on the location of the large-airway obstruction,
rate of progression of the physiologic obstruction, and
underlying cardiopulmonary status.86,87 Acute onset of
tachypnea, tachycardia, and increased work of breathing
should prompt immediate attention to airway management.
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
Patients with respiratory compromise due to increased
airway resistance are monitored by frequent heart rate,
breathing frequency, and blood pressure measurement.
Continuous oximetry and capnometry may be useful, but
each has its pitfalls. Pulse oximetry will not detect carbon
dioxide retention, the hallmark feature of respiratory com-
promise due to increased airway resistance; thus, adequate
peripheral oxygen saturation levels may give false assur-
ance that ventilation is acceptable. Supplemental oxygen
administration increases PaO2 and hemoglobin saturation,
but the resulting increases in V
˙ /Q
˙ mismatch may worsen
CO2 retention. Capnography measurement may not be
straightforward in patients with obstruction to air flow.
End-tidal PCO2 may be markedly different from arterial
PCO2,88,89 reflecting alterations in V
˙ A, in V
˙ D/V
˙ E, or in both.
Clinical scales to quantify dyspnea can be followed over
time to help detect respiratory compromise when progres-
sion of severity is gradual. Subjective scales, however,
while providing the valuable patient perspective, depend
on intact cognition for patient response. Acute respiratory
compromise due to increased airway resistance is likely to
impact cognition adversely, making such scales of ques-
tionable value in hypercarbic and/or hypoxemic patients.
Respiratory Compromise Due to Hydrostatic
Pulmonary Edema and Due to
Right-Ventricular Failure
Physiological Derangement
The right side of the heart is responsible for blood flow
through the pulmonary capillaries, and cardiac function
affects the amount and distribution of flow. Diastolic fill-
ing of the ventricle (preload) is determined by fluid status,
mean intrathoracic pressure, and compliance of the ven-
tricle. Pulmonary arterial resistance (afterload) is affected
by mean intrathoracic pressure, caliber of the pulmonary
arteries, hypoxic vasoconstriction, and adrenergic tone.
Although they have similarities, respiratory compromise
due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema has a pathophysiol-
ogy distinct from respiratory compromise due to right-
ventricular dysfunction. Respiratory compromise due to
hydrostatic pulmonary edema is manifested by decreased
cardiac output and by the parenchymal effects of pulmo-
nary edema. Pulmonary edema decreases lung compliance,
gas exchange, and FRC, which leads to hypoxemia that is
similar to respiratory compromise from parenchymal lung
disease. Decreased cardiac output adversely affects V
˙ /Q
˙
matching and decreases oxygen delivery. Respiratory fail-
ure from respiratory compromise due to hydrostatic pul-
monary edema may occur as oxygen delivery to the heart,
to the muscles of ventilation, and to other vital organs is
compromised.
In respiratory compromise due to right-ventricular dys-
function, pulmonary edema is characteristically absent.
However, because the right ventricle is much less equipped
than the left ventricle to increase its work load, this type of
respiratory compromise entails the risk of rapid deteriora-
tion and catastrophic cardiac decompensation. The right
ventricle initially maintains stroke volume through mech-
anisms such as increased diastolic filling, but respiratory
compromise occurs as the pulmonary arterial resistance
increases. The compromise worsens as further increases in
diastolic filling overdistend the right ventricle and decrease
the stroke volume. Respiratory compromise deteriorates
into respiratory failure as the cardiac output drops and
blood flow to vital organs is critically reduced. The muscle
of the right ventricle itself is especially compromised be-
cause its demand is so extreme and its internal pressure is

 high enough to limit coronary blood flow. Patients with
chronic right-ventricular strain (eg, those with pulmonary
arterial hypertension) are capable of a greater degree of
right-ventricular work than patients with more abrupt prob-
lems, such as acute pulmonary embolism. In both patient
groups, however, right-ventricular failure is the principal
danger.
Respiratory compromise due to right-ventricular dys-
function may be complicated by impaired V
˙ /Q
˙ ratios. The
most common gas exchange problem is increased perfu-
sion to underventilated lung regions that results from re-
distribution of pulmonary blood flow. Although the low
V
˙ /Q
˙ may cause hypoxemia, that particular manifestation
of right-ventricular dysfunction is particularly responsive
to supplemental oxygen. The responsiveness to oxygen is
another instance in which exclusive attention to blood ox-
ygenation may create a false sense of security in the care
of some patients with respiratory compromise.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
From Hydrostatic Pulmonary Edema
Patients with pulmonary edema are diagnosed on the
basis of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings.
Respiratory compromise from hydrostatic pulmonary
edemaisidentifiedwhenoxygensaturationdecreases,when
FIO2 requirements increase, or when the breathing frequency
and overall appearance suggest increased effort of breath-
ing. These findings reflect extravascular lung water, which
worsens gas exchange and increases lung elastance.
Respiratory compromise in patients with acute hydro-
static (cardiogenic) pulmonary edema may be identified
by findings associated with increased mortality risk. A
high proportion of in-hospital mortality with acute cardio-
genic pulmonary edema occurs on the first hospital day,90
making early prognostic assessment important. Acute myo-
cardial infarction as the precipitant for pulmonary edema
is associated with increased in-hospital mortality.91,92 Age,
hypotension, recurrence of acute pulmonary edema, and
need for inotropic therapy were the main independent pre-
dictors of hospital mortality.92 In patients without acute
myocardial infarction, the presence of atrial fibrillation
significantly increased in-hospital mortality.93 A prognos-
tic scoring system, the pulmonary edema prognostic score,
has been described with predictors of in-hospital mortal-
ity: acute myocardial infarction, hypotension, tachycardia,
and leukocytosis.94
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
The goal of monitoring during respiratory compromise
from hydrostatic pulmonary edema, as in other variants of
respiratory compromise, is to determine the trajectory of
the disease. Straightforward methods such as breathing
frequency and oxygen saturation (linked with FIO2 require-
ments) are best considered longitudinally to detect esca-
lating severity. Surveillance of ventilatory patterns, the
effort required to sustain breathing, and estimation of ex-
travascular lung water currently require frequent subjec-
tive evaluations. However, technological developments
may enhance the ability to monitor these parameters con-
tinuously and detect deterioration in a timely fashion.
Identification of Patients in Respiratory Compromise
Due to Right-Ventricular Dysfunction
Acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary arterial hyper-
tension, and other causes of right-ventricular strain require
specific diagnostic techniques. Identification of respiratory
compromise due to right-ventricular dysfunction depends
on the estimation of both the severity of the effects on the
right ventricle and on the risk of worsening. For acute
pulmonary embolism, the combination of severity and risk
is estimated with clinically validated scores, such as the
pulmonary embolism severity index.54,55,95 Respiratory
compromise in patients with acute pulmonary embolism
may be identified by findings associated with increased
mortality risk, such as high clinical severity indices (mor-
tality risk �20%)54,55,95,96; elevated markers of cardiac
strain, such as troponin or brain natriuretic peptide (mor-
tality relative risk �8)94-98; electrocardiogram evidence of
right-ventricular ischemia (mortality odds ratio �2)100-103;
or evidence of severe right-ventricular dysfunction docu-
mented by computed tomography (contrast reflux, mortal-
ity odds ratio �3)103 or echocardiogram (mortality odds
ratio �2).105,106
Monitoring Parameters Suggested After
Identification of Respiratory Compromise
Continuous monitoring of breathing frequency and ox-
ygen saturation may be helpful, although it is noteworthy
that hypoxemia from pulmonary vascular diseases may
respond well to supplemental oxygen therapy, even as
hemodynamics deteriorate. Progressive right-ventricular
failure constitutes the principal danger,107 so echocardiog-
raphy and serologic tests of cardiac strain and damage
should be checked periodically. Continuous electrocardio-
gram monitoring may detect new T-wave inversions in the
precordial leads, an ominous sign of right-ventricular wors-
ening. Capnography may detect changes in dead space
ventilation, and plethysmography may detect changes in
pulse pressure variation, although the clinical importance
of those findings in the acute setting is unknown.

 Manifestations Common to Different Types of
Respiratory Compromise
In addition to the relatively specific patterns of deteri-
oration observed for the various etiologies and mecha-
nisms of respiratory compromise, all types of severe
respiratory compromise may manifest similar effects on
non-respiratory systems. Hypoxemia adversely affects the
central nervous system, so confusion, delirium, obtunda-
tion, and other changes in level of consciousness and be-
havior may occur as hypoxemia worsens. Severe hypox-
emia can impair the function of many systemic organs and
worsen multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Hypoxemia
and severe acidosis impair cardiac function, alter vascular
tone, and can lead to hemodynamic collapse. Dyspnea and
muscle loading may encourage hormonal stress responses
and adrenergic stimulation, further jeopardizing vulnera-
ble organs.
Summary and Recommendations
Respiratory compromise is a deterioration in respiratory
function in which there is a high likelihood of decompen-
sation into respiratory failure or death but for which timely
specific interventions (enhanced monitoring or therapies)
might prevent or mitigate decompensation. Importantly,
specific interventions (enhanced monitoring or therapies)
might prevent or mitigate this decompensation. The high
incidence of respiratory failure and death among hospital-
ized patients suggests that an opportunity exists to inter-
vene at earlier stages in many patients. Although respira-
toryfailuremaycomplicateavarietyofdifferentconditions,
we have described general categories of respiratory com-
promise, each of which has its own pattern of physiolog-
ical deterioration. Classifying an acutely ill respiratory pa-
tient into one or more of these categories may help in
selecting the screening and monitoring strategies that are
most appropriate for the patient’s particular pathophysiol-
ogy. Although specific diagnostic and therapeutic inter-
ventions must be individualized, standardized screening
and monitoring practices for patients with similar mecha-
nisms of deterioration may enhance the ability to predict
respiratory failure early and prevent its occurrence.
