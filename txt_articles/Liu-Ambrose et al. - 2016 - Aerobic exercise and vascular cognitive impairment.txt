Aerobic exercise and vascular cognitive
impairment
A randomized controlled trial
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the efficacy of a progressive aerobic exercise training program on cogniti-
ve and everyday function among adults with mild subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impair-
ment (SIVCI).
Methods: This was a proof-of-concept single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing
a 6-month, thrice-weekly, progressive aerobic exercise training program (AT) with usual care plus
education on cognitive and everyday function with a follow-up assessment 6 months after the for-
mal cessation of aerobic exercise training. Primary outcomes assessed were general cognitive
function (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive subscale [ADAS-Cog]), executive
functions (Executive Interview [EXIT-25]), and activities of daily living (Alzheimer’s Disease Coop-
erative Study–Activities of Daily Living [ADCS-ADL]).
Results: Seventy adults randomized to aerobic exercise training or usual care were included in
intention-to-treat analyses (mean age 74 years, 51% female, n 5 35 per group). At the end of
the intervention, the aerobic exercise training group had significantly improved ADAS-Cog perfor-
mance compared with the usual care plus education group (21.71 point difference, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 23.15 to 20.26, p 5 0.02); however, this difference was not significant at the
6-month follow-up (20.63 point difference, 95% CI 22.34 to 1.07, p 5 0.46). There were no
significant between-group differences at intervention completion and at the 6-month follow-up in
EXIT-25 or ADCS-ADL performance. Examination of secondary measures showed between-group
differences at intervention completion favoring the AT group in 6-minute walk distance (30.35
meter difference, 95% CI 5.82 to 54.86, p 5 0.02) and in diastolic blood pressure
(26.89 mm Hg difference, 95% CI 212.52 to 21.26, p 5 0.02).
Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of 6 months of thrice-
weekly progressive aerobic training in community-dwelling adults with mild SIVCI, relative to
usual care plus education.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01027858.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for adults with mild SIVCI, an
aerobic exercise program for 6 months results in a small, significant improvement in ADAS-Cog
performance. Neurology® 2016;87:2082–2090

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alz-
heimer disease (AD).1 Cerebral small vessel disease plays a critical role in covert ischemia and the
development of sub-cortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment (SIVCI),2 the most com-
mon form of VCI. SIVCI is defined by the presence of white matter lesions (WMLs) and
lacunar infarcts, and has the clinical consequence of increased dementia risk.3,4 Aerobic exercise

 might delay the progression of SIVCI by mod-
ifying cardiovascular and metabolic risk fac-
tors.5–7
A
previous
observational
study8
demonstrated an association between physical
activity and a lower risk of mild SIVCI. How-
ever, no clinical trial has utilized aerobic exer-
cise
to
augment
cognitive
function
in
individuals with mild SIVCI. Thus, we con-
ducted a proof-of-concept single-blind ran-
domized controlled trial designed to provide
preliminary evidence of efficacy of a 6-month,
thrice-weekly,
progressive
aerobic
exercise
training program on cognitive and everyday
function among older adults with mild SIVCI.
In addition, we assessed the feasibility of deliv-
ering the exercise training program in this
population by examining rates of recruitment,
intervention compliance, and observed with-
drawal rates over the 6-month intervention
period.
METHODS Design and setting. The study involved 2
phases: a 6-month intervention phase followed by a 6-month
follow-up phase. Measurements were made at 3 times: baseline,
end of the intervention period (6 months postrandomization),
and 6-month follow-up (12 months postrandomization; figure).
The assessors were blinded to the participants’ assignments. Data
were collected at a research laboratory on the Vancouver General
Hospital campus.
This study was designed to address whether, among indi-
viduals with SIVCI, 6 months of thrice-weekly, progressive
aerobic training (AT) can improve (1) cognitive performance
as indexed by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–
Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog); (2) global executive func-
tion as indexed by the Executive Interview (EXIT-25); and (3)
performance of activities of daily living as indexed by the
Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily
Living (ADCS-ADL) scale.
This study provides Class II evidence that AT has short-term
benefits on ADAS-Cog performance because more than 2 pri-
mary outcomes were specified a priori.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Ethical approval was provided by the University of Brit-
ish Columbia’s Clinical Research Ethics Board (H07-01160). The
trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01027858). The trial
protocol has been published previously.9 Participants provided
written informed consent.
Participants. The sample consisted of adults with a clinical
diagnosis of mild SIVCI. We recruited from the University
of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Disorders, the Vancouver General Hospital
Stroke Prevention Clinic, and specialized geriatric clinics in
metro Vancouver, Canada. Clinical diagnosis of VCI was
made based on the presence of both small vessel ischemic
disease and cognitive syndrome.10 Small vessel ischemic dis-
ease was defined as evidence of relevant cerebrovascular disease
by brain CT or MRI defined as the presence of both (1)
periventricular and deep WMLs and (2) absence of cortical
and or cortico-subcortical nonlacunar territorial infarcts
and watershed infarcts, hemorrhages indicating large vessel
disease, signs of normal-pressure hydrocephalus, or other
specific
causes
of
WMLs
(i.e.,
multiple
sclerosis,
leukodystrophies, sarcoidosis, brain irradiation). In addition
to the neuroimaging evidence, the presence or a history of
neurologic signs such as Babinski sign, sensory deficit, gait
disorder, or extrapyramidal signs consistent with subcortical
brain lesions was required and confirmed by study physicians
(G.-Y.R.H. and P.E.L.). Cognitive syndrome was defined as
a baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)11 score
,26/30 and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)12
score of $20 at screening. Progressive cognitive decline was
confirmed
through
medical
records
or
caregiver/family
member interviews. For additional details on inclusion and
exclusion criteria, see the e-Methods at Neurology.org.
Sample size. No previous randomized trial has examined the
effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in mild SIVCI.
The required sample size for this study was calculated based on
predictions of 6-month changes on the ADAS-Cog. An exercise
trial among community-dwelling adults with ADAS-Cog as the
primary outcome measure demonstrated an effect size of 0.60.13
Thus, assuming a one-sided a 5 0.05, 30 participants per group
would provide 75% power to detect this effect size. We recruited
35 participants per group to accommodate a conservative 15%
dropout rate.
Descriptors. At baseline, participants underwent a clinical assess-
ment with study physicians (G.-Y.R.H. and P.E.L.) to confirm cur-
rent health status and eligibility for the study. Age in years and
education level were assessed by self-report. Standing height was
measured as stretch stature to the 0.1 centimeter per standard
protocol. Weight was measured twice to the 0.1 kilogram on
a calibrated digital scale. Waist-to-hip ratio was determined by
measuring the widest part of the hip circumference and the waist
just above the navel in centimeters. We used the Functional
Comorbidity
Index14
to
assess
the
number
of
comorbid
conditions related to physical functioning. General mobility was
assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery15 and by the
Timed Up-and-Go Test.16 Total WML volume was quantified for
a subset (n 5 38) who underwent structural 3T MRI at baseline.
Primary outcome measures. Although the study contained 3
prespecified primary outcomes, the study was powered based
on expected changes in ADAS-Cog. We determined a priori
that observing a statistically significant difference (2-tailed
p , 0.05) on any of the 3 outcomes at the end of the
intervention would be considered preliminary evidence of
efficacy of AT in this population.9 The ADAS-Cog is an
11-item assessment of memory, language, and praxis; scores
range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater
cognitive impairment.17 The ADAS-Cog has acceptable
reliability and validity and responsiveness to treatment
effects.18 The EXIT-25 assesses global executive function
over 25 items; scores range from 0 to 50, with higher scores
indicating greater executive dysfunction. Scores $15 are
indicative of clinically significant executive dysfunction.19
The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item informant-rated questionnaire
that measures an individual’s performance of activities of daily
living.20 Scores range from 0 to 78, with higher scores
indicating better performance.
Secondary outcome measures. Executive functions. Three
aspects of executive functions (EF) were assessed. Response inhi-
bition was assessed with the Stroop Test (incongruent minus

Making Tests (part B minus part A).22 Working memory was
assessed with verbal digit span tests (digits forward minus digits
backwards).23 Details on these tests are shown in the e-Methods.
General cardiovascular capacity, physical activity level,
and physiologic markers. We used the 6-Minute Walk Test
(6MWT)24 to assess general cardiovascular capacity. Meters
walked in 6 minutes was recorded. Current level of physical
activity was determined by the Physical Activities Scale for the
Elderly questionnaire.25 Body mass index was calculated using the
formula mass (kg)/height (m2). Resting systolic and diastolic
blood pressure and heart rate were taken using an automated
device (OMRON M2 HEM-7121-E, Kyoto, Japan). The mean
of 2 recordings, taken 5 minutes apart, is reported.
Randomization. The randomization sequence was generated
using the web application randomization.com with a ratio of
1:1 to AT or usual care plus education. A research team
member not involved with the study held this sequence at
a remote location. After the completion of consent and baseline
testing, the research coordinator contacted the team member
holding the list to determine the next allocation.
Experimental groups. AT group. All AT group classes were led
by instructors certified to instruct seniors. Class attendance was
recorded for each participant by the instructors throughout
the 6-month intervention. Each 60-minute class included
a 10-minute warm-up, a 40-minute walk, and a 10-minute cool
down. Walking occurred outdoors and followed predetermined

 routes around local areas. The intensity of the AT program was
monitored and progressed using 3 approaches: (1) heart rate
monitoring with an initial intensity of 40% of age-specific
target heart rate (i.e., heart rate reserve [HRR]). HRR was
calculated by subtracting resting heart rate from maximum
heart rate (using the formula 206.9 2 0.67 3 age26) and was
recalculated each month. Participants progressed over the first
12 weeks to the range of 60%–70% of HRR. Once the target
HRR of 65% was achieved, it was sustained for the remainder
of the intervention period; (2) subjective monitoring using
the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)27 with a target
RPE of 14–15; and (3) the “talk” test,28 starting at a walking
pace allowing comfortable conversation and progressing to
a walking pace where conversation was difficult. For partici-
pants taking b-blocker medication (7 in each group; table 1),
subjective measures of intensity were prioritized.
The AT group was also given a pedometer to serve as both an
incentive and monitoring tool. Participants recorded the number
of steps each day taken outside the AT classes on standard logs
provided by the research team. Table e-1 provides descriptive
information on the number of steps recorded across the interven-
tion period.
Usual care plus education group. Participants in the usual
care plus education (CON) group received usual care as well as
monthly educational materials about VCI and healthy diet. How-
ever, no specific information regarding physical activity was

pants on a monthly basis to maintain contact and to acquire
research data.
Feasibility. To assess feasibility, we calculated the recruitment
rate, intervention compliance (determined by percentage of the
total AT classes attended), and the withdrawal rate (determined
from active requests to withdraw from the study) over the
6-month intervention period. The AT intervention was deemed
feasible if the following 3 conditions were achieved: (1)
a recruitment rate .15%; (2) a withdrawal rate ,15%; and
(3) an average compliance of 60% for the AT classes.
Adverse events monitoring. All participants were instructed
to report any adverse effects due to the AT exercises to our
research coordinator, such as falls or musculoskeletal pain per-
sisting longer than 48 hours. Participants were also questioned
about the presence of any adverse effects, such as musculoskel-
etal pain or discomfort, at each exercise session. All instructors
also monitored participants for symptoms of angina and short-
ness of breath during the exercise classes. External experts from
our safety monitoring committee reviewed all adverse events
reported on a monthly basis.
Statistical analysis. Primary analyses were conducted in the
statistical package SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY) and evaluated between-group differences (AT vs CON)
on the outcomes of interest using mixed models. Time was
considered
as
a
repeated,
categorical
variable
and
was
included as a fixed effect in addition to group, group-by-time
interaction, and baseline MoCA score. The intercept was
specified as a random effect. The covariance matrix was
specified
as
first-order
autoregressive
to
account
for
correlations
among
within-subject
residuals
across
time
points. By including group and baseline MoCA score in all
models, it was assumed that data were missing at random
(See table e-2 for information on missing data). Analyses
were
based
on
intention-to-treat,
restricted
maximum
likelihood estimation using all available data from the
randomized participants (n 5 70). For the primary outcome
measures,
complete
case
analyses
were
also
conducted,
including only those participants who completed the 6-
month follow-up assessment (n 5 58). Furthermore, per
protocol
analyses
were
conducted,
in
which
only
AT
participants with $60% class attendance were included (27
out of the 35 randomized). These analyses replicated the
intention-to-treat analyses (table e-3).
A final set of analyses determined whether changes in ADAS-
Cog performance correlated with changes in other outcomes,
independent of treatment group and baseline MoCA score. These
correlation analyses were limited to variables that showed a signif-
icant between-group difference over time.
RESULTS Seventy-one individuals were recruited
between December 2009 and April 2014. The final
follow-up measurements were made in April 2015.
After randomization, one AT group participant was
deemed ineligible due to the diagnosis of mixed
dementia
and
was

 were also observed for EXIT-25 and ADCS-ADL at 6
months and 12 months but none were statistically sig-
nificant (table 2). Complete case analysis produced sim-
ilar results to those described above.
Secondary outcome measures. Table 3 provides the esti-
mated between-group and within-group differences
over time in the secondary outcomes. There were
significant between-group differences in 6MWT
and in diastolic blood pressure favoring the AT
group. Both effects did not persist at the 6-month
follow-up. There were no between-group differences
in the 3 specific EF measures or in other secondary
measures. During the 6-month intervention period,
improvements in ADAS-Cog correlated with reduced
resting diastolic blood pressure (partial r 5 0.32, p 5
0.01) but not with improvements in 6WMT distance
(partial r 5 20.17, p 5 0.22).
Feasibility. Based on the 440 participants who could
be contacted and screened by telephone and deemed
eligible, our observed recruitment rate was 16% (i.e.,
71/440). Based on the 122 individuals who were
screened in person, 84 were deemed eligible; our
observed recruitment rate was 85% (i.e., 71/84; fig-
ure). Of the 70 participants who were randomized
and included in our analyses, the withdrawal rate
during the 6-month intervention period was 17% (i.
e., 6/35) in the CON group, 3% (i.e., 1/35) in the AT
intervention group, and 10% (i.e., 7/70) in the
overall
sample.
One
participant
from
each
experimental group missed their trial completion
assessment
(figure).
The
average
exercise
compliance observed in the AT group was 68%.
Adverse events. Two study-related adverse events
were reported in the AT group and one in the
CON group. All 3 were nonsyncopal falls. One
of the falls in the AT group resulted in a broken
tooth and required assessment in the Hospital
Emergency Department; the remaining 2 did not
result in injury.
DISCUSSION This proof-of-concept randomized trial
suggests engaging in AT may benefit cognitive
function
and
reduce
cardiovascular
risk
in
community-dwelling
adults
with
mild
SIVCI,
a population at risk for dementia and functional
decline. We found a small difference in change in
cognitive function, as measured by the ADAS-Cog at
the end of the intervention, relative to usual care
with education. We also found that AT significantly
improved general cardiovascular capacity and reduced
resting diastolic blood pressure. Further, our data
suggest
identification
and
recruitment
of
this
population is feasible and a thrice-weekly AT can be
delivered to this target population with an acceptable
level of compliance.

 The observed effects on ADAS-Cog aligns with
our previous study,29 which demonstrated that 6
months of progressive aerobic exercise significantly
improved memory (both verbal and spatial), but
not EF, in women with probable mild cognitive
impairment aged 70–80 years. Memory is a key
cognitive domain assessed by ADAS-Cog and has
been shown to be particularly impaired in persons
with small subcortical strokes.30 In the current
study, the difference of 1.71 points observed on
the ADAS-Cog between AT and control groups
falls within the range observed in previous pharma-
ceutical trials among individuals with vascular
dementia or mild SIVCI (i.e., 1–2 points)31–33;
however, the difference was less than that deemed
to be the minimal clinically important difference (3
points).34
In contrast, AT did not produce improvements
in EF. A previous study demonstrated that 6
months of AT significantly improved EF in older
women with amnestic MCI35 and in older adults
with glucose intolerance.36 There are differences
in both the frequency and intensity of AT between
the 2 studies (i.e., 33/week and 60%–70% of HRR
in our study vs 43/week and 75%–85% HRR in
the previous studies). In addition, on average, our
study participants were older and had lower baseline
MMSE scores. Finally, based on the average EXIT-
25 scores at baseline, the study participants did not
have substantial executive dysfunction (i.e., scores
,15/50),19 which might have reduced sensitivity to
improvement.
We found that improved ADAS-Cog perfor-
mance was associated with reduced diastolic blood
pressure. Hypertension is regarded as a key and
modifiable risk factor for SIVCI37 and it has been
suggested that the association between diastolic
blood pressure and stroke risk is J-shaped among
older adults, such that as diastolic blood pressure
either increases or decreases from 71 mm Hg, stroke
risk increases.38 Notably, we observed that AT
reduced diastolic blood pressure from approxi-
mately 80 to 75 mm Hg, which might confer pro-
tection against future stroke. Our correlational
finding also suggests that reduced blood pressure
may be a pathway by which aerobic exercise
promotes cognitive health among those with mild
SIVICI. Nevertheless, the relationship between
late-life blood pressure and cognitive function is
still poorly understood.
There are limitations. The Vascular Dementia
Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (VADAS-Cog)
may be more sensitive to modest changes in cogni-
tion in comparison to the ADAS-Cog.18 Yet data
supporting the use of the VADAS-Cog data were
limited when the current study was begun. The
number of participants who withdrew during the
6-month intervention was different between the 2
groups (2 vs 10); future studies will need to address
this problem to maximize retention. Moreover,
compared with those who completed the 6-month
intervention, individuals who withdrew had lower
baseline cognitive function, as measured by the
MMSE, MoCA, and ADAS-Cog. Thus, our current
results may not apply to those who were at a more
severe stage of SIVCI. While this study used well-
defined clinical criteria for SIVCI diagnosis that
include neuroimaging,10 the clinical presentation
may include mixed pathology such as concomitant
AD.2 Significant between-group differences were
only observed in 1 of the 3 primary outcomes
(ADAS-Cog). Although this met our prespecified
criteria for preliminary efficacy,9 future studies with
larger sample sizes and application of biomarkers are
needed to rigorously evaluate the role of aerobic
exercise on cognitive function among older adults
with mild SIVCI. Further, all positive effects of 6
months of AT dissipated after a 6-month follow-up
period, which suggests that strategies to increase the
sustainability of these effects are needed. This might
entail a longer intervention period (e.g., 12 months)
or the inclusion of behavioral components (e.g.,
self-monitoring or incentive schemes) to facilitate
maintenance of this frequency and intensity of
walking upon intervention cessation. Finally, the
16% recruitment rate observed in this study empha-
sizes potential feasibility challenges that may exist
among future trials that include older adults with
SIVCI.
Despite these limitations, our proof-of-concept
study provides preliminary evidence that a 6-month
program of thrice-weekly progressive AT promotes
cognitive function and reduces cardiovascular risk in
older adults with mild SIVCI.
