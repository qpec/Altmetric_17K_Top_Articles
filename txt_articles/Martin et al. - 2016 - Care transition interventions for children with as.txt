Abstract
The Emergency Department (ED) is a critical point of identification and treatment for some of the 
most high risk children with asthma. This review summarizes the evidence regarding care 
transition interventions originating in the ED for children with uncontrolled asthma, with a focus 
on care coordination and self-management education. While many interventions on care transition 
for pediatric asthma have been tested, only a few were actually conducted in the ED setting. Most 
of these targeted both care coordination and self-management education but ultimately did not 
improve attendance at follow up appointments with primary care providers, improve asthma 
control, or reduce healthcare utilization. Conducting any ED-based intervention in the current

 environment is challenging due to the many demands on ED providers and staff, poor 
communication within and outside of the medical sector, and caregiver/patient burden. The 
evidence to date suggests ED care transition interventions should consider expanding beyond the 
ED to bridge the multiple sectors children with asthma navigate, including health care settings, 
homes, schools, and community spaces. Patient-centered approaches may also be important to 
ensure adequate intervention design, enrollment, retention, and evaluation of outcomes important 
to children and their families.

Introduction
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases among children in the United States 
(US), affecting over 7 million children and costing more than 50 billion in direct health care 
costs annually.1–3 Not all children with asthma are affected equally. The health burden from 
asthma is disproportionately high among non-Hispanic black and Puerto Rican children, 
which have substantially higher prevalence of asthma (13.4% and 23.5%, respectively, 
versus 7.6% for non-Hispanic white).3 The risk of hospitalizations is also higher for non-
Hispanic black (12.9%) versus non-Hispanic white (3.4%) children.4 These disparities exist 
despite decades of research to develop and implement strategies that target health disparities 
in asthma.5–7
The emergency department (ED) is where many patients with asthma seek and receive care.8 
Respiratory disorders are the most common reason for ED visits in children after injuries 
and poisonings.9 In 2010, children with asthma in the US experienced over 900,000 asthma-
related ED visits.9 Asthma disparities are obvious in the ED;10–12 non-Hispanic black 
children have been shown to have an ED visit rate more than four times higher than the rate 
for non-Hispanic white children.13 Medicaid recipients also have a greater number of 
asthma-related ED visits when compared to non-Medicaid insured recipients.10,14 Because 
the majority of patients receiving ED care experience symptoms of uncontrolled asthma in 
the weeks and months prior to their ED visit, ED utilization rates for asthma can be 
attributed to patient-level issues such as under-recognition of symptoms or challenges 
implementing treatment plans.15 On a system level, these rates serve as a barometer for 
inaccessible, and perhaps lower quality, ambulatory care options for asthma care.
Caring for asthma in EDs is costly both for families and the healthcare system.16 Some 
children that present to the ED for asthma care have severe asthma that is difficult to control 
under the best of circumstances, while other children have uncontrolled asthma due to 
improper management at home or in the ambulatory setting.8,10 In all situations, families 
require education and support while in the ED to safely and effectively transition their care 
to the ambulatory setting and home.14 With the shift from volume to value-based payment 
models for healthcare in the US, there is increasing interest among health systems to identify 
and adopt strategies that improve the quality and outcomes of care transitions following ED

 discharge for asthma. The objective of this review was therefore to summarize the evidence 
regarding care transition interventions originating in the ED for children with uncontrolled 
asthma.
Care Transitions from the ED to Home and Ambulatory Settings
Care transitions are defined as the movement of patients between health care practitioners, 
settings, and home as their need for healthcare evolves over time.17 The primary barriers to 
effective care transitions are inadequate communication, patient education, and 
accountability.17–19 ED providers frequently do not have access to ambulatory health records 
and cannot effectively coordinate management or arrange follow-up care. Patients and their 
caregivers often receive incomplete, confusing or conflicting recommendations regarding 
care plans during health care transitions. This becomes even more challenging when patients 
lack a sufficient understanding of the disease or how to care for it. Accountability for the 
disease management falls either on the ambulatory provider or the patient/caregiver, both of 
whom often have incomplete information, limited resources to coordinate care, and may not 
communicate effectively with each other.
While chronic diseases like asthma are influenced by many factors within the health care 
system and the communities where patients live,20 approaches to care transitions from the 
ED can be grouped into two domains: care coordination and self-management education. 
Care coordination is defined as “the deliberate organization of patient care activities between 
two or more participants (including the patient) to facilitate the appropriate delivery of 
health care services.21 Care coordination can be achieved through a range of modalities 
including designated care coordination staff, written materials, emails, phone calls, text 
messages, and open access scheduling. The goal is to address access and resource gaps 
through communication processes. Self-management education targets the skills that patients 
and caregivers require to monitor, treat and control asthma.22 This education can happen in 
many different environments and can be delivered using a variety of modalities.
Care Transition Interventions in the ED for Pediatric Asthma
Care coordination is usually not a typical part of ED services, yet many patients in the ED 
are there primarily because of failures in coordinating quality care in the ambulatory 
setting.8,10 Incomplete access to patients’ full health information in the ED coupled with 
limited skills training and general capacity for care coordination has motivated the 
development of interventions to transition patients out of the ED and link them back into 
primary care. In 2012, Katz et al. published a review of care coordination interventions in 
the ED.23 Of the 14 randomized controlled trials identified, four targeted pediatric asthma 
interventions that were delivered in the ED.24–27 (Table 1) Another review of ED-based care 
transition interventions for pediatric patients published by Abraham et al.28 in 2016 
identified nine care coordination interventions for children with asthma, but only five of 
these were actually conducted in the ED.24,26–27,29–30
Three of the six interventions identified in these reviews demonstrated improvements in 
follow-up with primary care providers, mainly using strategies that focused on patient

 reminders and appointment scheduling.24–25,30 One study achieved improvements in care 
coordination by providing families with allergen skin testing in the ED as a way to generate 
tailored asthma management plans and encourage families to seek follow-up care.30 Care 
coordination can also be achieved through decision support tools. A randomized controlled 
trial in Canada provides an example of a provider-level intervention that achieved 
improvements in care coordination by aiming to reduce practice variation.31 The study 
tested the effects of a structured paper template to promote guideline-consistent ED 
discharge practices versus usual care. The treating ED physicians completed the paper 
template at ED discharge and made all decisions about the dosage and duration of 
medications prescribed, verbal instructions, and recommendations for medical follow-up. 
Results indicated that the intervention significantly increased ED physician adherence to 
guideline recommendations for arranging follow-up visits with medical providers and that 
caregivers were also more likely to attend a follow-up visit with a medical provider.31
Self-management education for asthma has been shown to improve patient outcomes and be 
a cost-effective component of asthma care in a variety of settings.22,32–33 However studies of 
asthma self-management education interventions in the ED are limited. In an Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) review of self-management interventions for 
pediatric asthma through 2006, none of the 75 interventions identified in the review that 
directly targeted self-management and patient education were conducted in the ED.34 A 
Cochrane review of educational interventions for pediatric asthma in the ED included 38 
studies but only four of these interventions actually occurred in the ED.26,29,35–37 (Table 1) 
While the Cochrane review reported that educational intervention was strongly associated 
with a reduced risk for subsequent ED visits,35 only one of the four studies that delivered the 
educational intervention in the ED setting reported some improvements in healthcare 
utilization.37
Several of these studies incorporated both self-management education and care coordination 
into their interventions. One example, Emergency Department Allies, combined education 
with care coordination in two academic EDs. The study utilized a randomized 3-arm clinical 
trial design.26 Usual care consisted of an educational video, peak flow and inhaler 
instruction, instructions on how to make a follow-up appointment and a written asthma 
action plan. Group 2 received usual care plus enhanced care coordination that included 
specific outreach and communication to the primary care provider. Group 3 received all that 
Group 2 did, plus six home visits from a case manager that performed asthma and 
environmental needs assessments, education, personalized care plans, and social service 
referrals. Neither intervention arm was associated with decreases in the frequency of 
subsequent ED visits or improvements in asthma quality of life or controller medication use. 
The reasons for the lack of effect of either intervention were unclear although the usual care 
condition was more robust than what is often seen in busy EDs. Also, the training of the case 
managers and their oversight for quality and consistency was not described; perhaps it was 
not as strong or specific as needed to improve the outcomes.
Zorc et al. also tested a combined care coordination and education intervention for children 
with asthma.27 The control group received standard discharge instructions to follow-up in 3–
5 days with their primary care provider (PCP). Intervention group participants received an

 educational video in the ED and if they screened positive for persistent asthma, they also 
received a letter to bring to their PCP stating their screening result. After discharge, they 
were sent a postcard reminding them to follow-up with their PCP. PCP follow-up rates at 4 
weeks were similar between groups. Secondary outcomes of symptoms, asthma quality of 
life, and subsequent ED visits were also similar between study groups. While this 
intervention demonstrated adequate feasibility, perhaps a one-time general-audience video 
was not robust enough to change behavior. Other educational video interventions that 
tailored their videos demonstrated slightly better outcomes.37
A Patient-Centered Approach to ED Pediatric Asthma Interventions
The Coordinated Healthcare Interventions for Childhood Asthma Gaps in Outcomes 
(CHICAGO) Plan is a multi-centered randomized controlled trial funded by the Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to test evidence-based strategies to improve 
the care and outcomes of African-American and Latino children with uncontrolled asthma 
presenting to EDs in Chicago.38 The CHICAGO Plan builds on the strengths and lessons 
learned from these previous studies, and also incorporates a new element—patient-
centeredness. The Institute of Medicine defines patient-centered care as: “Providing care that 
is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and 
ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.”18 To ensure the study is patient-
centered, the CHICAGO Plan is guided by a team of stakeholders and a community advisory 
board. Formative work conducted in preparation for the trial defined the outcomes and 
interventions, while ongoing input from stakeholders supports study implementation and 
results interpretation. CHICAGO Plan recruits children ages 5–11 years old presenting to an 
ED with uncontrolled asthma. Children are randomized to receive a patient-centered ED 
discharge tool, a patient-centered ED discharge tool plus community-health worker (CHW) 
home visitation, or usual care. CHWs are defined as frontline public health workers who are 
trusted members of and/or have an unusually close understanding of the community 
served.39
Care coordination is achieved in two ways in the CHICAGO Plan. The first is through the 
CHICAGO Action Plan after Emergency department discharge (CAPE), adapted from 
Ducharme et al.31 The CAPE is a personalized paper asthma management plan. The CAPE 
was designed using a process of contextual inquiry that engaged ED providers and 
administrators, ambulatory care providers, caregivers of children with asthma, and CHWs.40 
This formative work also concluded that the completion of the CAPE by existing ED staff 
and providers would not be feasible. The CAPE is therefore generated by ED coordinators 
hired specifically by the trial to serve as discharge coordinators, in consultation with both the 
ED providers and the patients’ caregivers. Care coordination is also achieved through the 
integration of CHWs in one arm of the study. CHWs work with participants to develop 
tailored strategies for more effective navigation of the health care system.
The CHICAGO Plan delivers self-management education in three ways. First, all study 
participants receive ED inhaler education using Teach-To-Goal.41–42 Second, the CAPE 
provides families with information on their specific medications, triggers, and follow-up 
care in a format they can refer back to when they leave the ED. The written information in

 the CAPE is also orally presented to the patient by the ED coordinator, along with inhaler 
technique education. This process allows for discussion and questions regarding the content 
and accommodates multiple learning styles. Third, in the home, CHWs support families to 
learn asthma symptoms, how medications work, when medications should be used, proper 
inhaler technique, and how to reduce triggers.
Another domain targeted by the CHICAGO Plan in the CHW arm is home environmental 
remediation. Home-based environmental trigger interventions have been shown to reduce 
indoor allergens, asthma symptoms and improve quality of life,43–45 but home 
environmental remediation is typically not a primary focus in the ED. To test the potential 
importance of triggers in the home, the CHW home visitation arm of the CHICAGO Plan 
takes a proactive approach toward identification of environmental issues and remediation. 
The environmental triggers targeted in the CHICAGO Plan included cockroach and mouse 
allergen as children with asthma are commonly sensitized to these allergens and high levels 
of exposure are found in inner city homes.46–51 In the CHICAGO Plan, CHWs teach and 
support families to implement integrated pest management and green cleaning strategies to 
reduce environmental trigger exposures in the home. CHWs also work with the city housing 
authority and an independent non-profit housing advocacy organization to assist families in 
obtaining structural repairs or to change housing when repairs are not adequate.
The CHICAGO Plan is ongoing and is expected to report results in the winter of 2017. 
Outcomes include measures of asthma control, caregiver quality of life, and several process 
measures (e.g., prescription of guideline-recommended medications in the ED and 
arrangement of follow-up appointments prior to ED discharge).
Gaps, Challenges and Opportunities Moving Forward
In studies examining strategies to improve care transitions among children presenting to the 
ED with asthma exacerbations, the focus to date has been to provide self-management 
education and care coordination support both during and after the ED visit to improve 
ambulatory follow-up and asthma control. This should be an effective strategy, as the ED 
setting represents a point of enhanced receptivity to information and support for behavior 
change52 and ED-based care transition interventions that include all pediatric diseases have 
been shown to improve the probability of follow-up visits with primary care.28 However 
when we look at pediatric asthma interventions alone, we see the limited evidence suggests 
poor effectiveness of asthma-specific care transition interventions for children in the 
ED.23,28 These asthma interventions include elements that have been shown to be effective 
in other settings. What they do not include are robust multi-sector interventions that address 
the needs of children where they live, play, learn, and receive health care.
Care transitions from the ED to the ambulatory setting and the home rely on effective care 
coordination but this care coordination cannot occur only in the ED. Ideally, it should link 
within the medical sector (hospital, ED, ambulatory setting, and pharmacy) as well as 
connect with the community, home, and family in such a way that the burden of 
accountability does not fall solely on the patient or caregiver as demonstrated in the Figure. 
Many care coordination tasks currently exist because the sectors do not have functioning

 systems of communication. Electronic health records from hospitals and EDs frequently do 
not connect with each other and with ambulatory settings. This limits the ability of clinicians 
to provide optimal health care and also imposes challenges on the scheduling of follow-up 
outpatient care.53 Outside of the medical sector, almost no infrastructure exists to support 
communication of health information between schools, families, and housing agencies.
The ultimate solutions to these problems reside in large-scale system and policy changes 
which will not happen quickly. Therefore we must define how and by whom care transitions 
in our current system can be most effectively achieved. As the studies presented 
demonstrate, care coordination in the ED can be conducted by a variety of staff. Care 
coordination staff supported by written tools and technology-driven materials hold potential 
for connecting care plans across sectors. Yet we are far from the implementation of such 
tools. In the Abraham et al. review of ED-based care coordination interventions, none were 
integrated into the electronic health record or utilized health information technology.28 As 
these technology tools grow in feasibility and implementation, we need to consider the 
interaction of the human element with written/electronic materials. Are both necessary? 
Qualitative work and a needs assessment conducted for the CHICAGO Plan suggest that 
urban, low income, minority populations appreciate written/electronic resources as sources 
of reference and tools to communicate across sectors, but rely on the human connection for 
initial delivery of the information, assistance with navigating the healthcare system, and 
long-term support of asthma management.
Self-management education for the caregiver/patient may be an important component of 
effective care transitions from the ED but the evidence remain limited. Traditionally self-
management education was provided through written materials or delivered by the providers, 
but newer evidence supports delivery of this education by CHWs and technology platforms 
for high-risk populations.54–56 Education can be delivered in any setting and it remains 
unclear which settings optimize behavior change. The ED presents a unique opportunity to 
identify patients at high risk for poor asthma outcomes and to use the experience of the ED 
visit as a teachable moment. Families might be primed for education and behavior change by 
the ED experience, but the evidence to date also suggest that the opposite might be true. 
Families might be too overwhelmed by the ED experience to effectively respond to 
education and support. It also remains unclear how much or how frequent self-management 
education needs to occur. Likely there is no one-size-fits-all recommendation; some patients 
will require more time and resources to implement change, while others will require less.
Home environmental remediation remains a difficult to address component of care 
transitions and recent evidence call into question the overall efficacy of this intervention.57 
Environmental remediation frequently requires actions and partnerships with agencies 
outside of the healthcare system and one way to achieve that in the current environment is 
CHWs. CHWs move between the healthcare system and patients’ homes and are therefore 
uniquely positioned to facilitate home remediation efforts. Larger policy efforts may also be 
needed such as enforcement of existing building codes, smoke-free housing, idling laws and 
enforcement, industry zoning modifications, and financial assistance for low income 
landlords and home-owners.58

 A final area for consideration in the success of ED care transitions is the possible need for 
patient-centered interventions. In a 2009 review of asthma interventions, Clark et al. 
reported successful interventions recognized the multifaceted nature of asthma management 
for patients, assessed needs and risk for each patient, and tailored program elements to those 
needs and risks.33 Engaging patients and other stakeholders in the design process is one way 
to achieve this. Due to strong interest from funders, payers, and the public for patient-
centered interventions, evidence regarding the efficacy of patient-centered interventions on 
clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization has been growing. However, evidence on the 
role of patient-centered interventions in the ED does not exist and presents an opportunity 
for future studies.
Conclusions
The ED remains a critical point of identification and treatment for some of the most high 
risk children with asthma. Providing these children and their families with the education and 
care coordination services they need to effectively manage their asthma at home with the 
support of an ambulatory provider is no easy task. Conducting any ED-based intervention in 
the current environment is challenging due to existing ED staff and provider responsibilities, 
poor communication within and outside of the medical sector, and caregiver/patient burden. 
The existing evidence on care transition models from the ED suggests that multi-sector 
studies for children with uncontrolled asthma can be initiated in the ED but then need to 
consider all the sectors children with asthma navigate which include not just the hospitals, 
EDs, and clinics, but also their homes and schools and community spaces. Once we develop 
care models that connect across all these sectors, we can perhaps finally reduce the burden 
of asthma borne by our most disadvantaged children and vulnerable sectors of our society.
