Abstract
Background: Risk appropriate prenatal care has been asserted as a way for cost effective delivery of prenatal care. A virtual care
model for prenatal care has the potential to provide patient-tailored, risk-appropriate prenatal educational content and may
facilitate vital sign and weight monitoring between visits. Previous studies have demonstrated safe reduction of frequency of in
person prenatal care visits in low risk patients, but have noted a reduction of patient satisfaction.
Objective: The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a mobile prenatal care app to facilitate a reduced in-
person visit schedule, for low risk pregnancies, while maintaining patient and provider satisfaction.
Methods: This controlled trial compared a control group receiving usual care to an experimental group receiving usual prenatal
care plus a mobile prenatal care app.   The experimental group had a planned reduction in the frequency of in-person office visits
while the control group had the usual number of visits. The trial was conducted at two diverse outpatient obstetric practices that
are part of a single academic center in Washington, DC, USA.  Women were eligible for enrollment if they presented to care in
the first trimester, were between the ages of 18 and 40, had a confirmed desired pregnancy, were not considered “high-risk,” and
had an iOS or Android smartphone that they used regularly. We measured the effectiveness of a virtual care platform for prenatal
care via the following measured outcomes: (1) the number of in-person Obstetric (OB) visits during pregnancy; (2) patient
satisfaction with prenatal care; (3) and provider satisfaction.
Results: 88 patients were enrolled in the study, 47 in the experimental group and 41 in the control group. For patients in the
experimental group, the average number of in-person OB visits during pregnancy was 7.8 and the average number in the control
group was 10.2 (P=0.01204).  There was no statistical difference in patient satisfaction or provider satisfaction in either group.
Conclusions: The use of a mobile prenatal care app was associated with reduced in-person visits and without a reduction in
patient or provider satisfaction.

Introduction
Background 
In the United States, there are nearly four million live births each year. This makes prenatal care one of the
most widely utilized preventative care health services [1, 2]. Despite its widespread use, the effectiveness and
organization of standard prenatal care has been debated [3, 4, 5].  Rigorous scientific evidence of the
effectiveness of standard prenatal care, including effects on maternal and infant outcomes, healthy-related
behaviors, and health care costs is limited [2]. In the early mid-1980s, an expert panel recommended
stratifying women into high and low-risk categories, with high-risk women receiving more intensive prenatal
care and low-risk women following a reduced visit frequency schedule [6].    The rationale for this
recommendation was that unnecessary visits for low-risk patients consume health care resources that could be
applied more judiciously to women with higher risk pregnancies.  However, despite these recommendations,
the standard model of prenatal care with high-frequency visits has persisted.  Almost a third of low-risk
women receive more visits than recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG) [7]. The barriers cited by providers for not reducing visits for low-risk pregnancies include:  concern
about decreased patient satisfaction; need for frequent weight and blood pressure monitoring; and concern
about  reduced  transmission  of  educational  information  regarding  health  and  lifestyle  choices  during
pregnancy. 
Goal of This Study 
The primary objective of this study was to determine if a mobile prenatal care app facilitates a reduced in-
person prenatal care visit schedule while maintaining patient and provider satisfaction.  Mobile health apps
have the potential to address many of the perceived barriers to reducing in-person visits [8].  The application
of smartphone technology has been shown to improve disease management for diabetes self-care activities,
HIV infection medication adherence and sickle cell anemia medication adherence [9-11]. We hypothesize that
a similar approach using a mobile app and connected monitoring devices may also be beneficial to manage
prenatal care.  A pilot trial with eight patients was performed. This trial ensured the platform and devices

Marko et al
functioned appropriately, any blood pressure and weight triggers were identified and managed, a reduced visit
schedule was achieved on a small scale, and the platform was satisfactory to patients. The feedback from the
pilot guided this investigation [12].
Methods
Study Design
This pragmatic controlled trial compared an experimental group that received a mobile app for prenatal care
and an integrated Wi-Fi connected blood pressure and weight scale to a control group that received usual care.
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval has been obtained from the George Washington University IRB
(IRB#: 015422). 
Study Setting
The educational components and clinical triggers were developed and refined at the George Washington
University (GWU) in Washington, DC (United States) working in conjunction with local mobile health
technology firm 1EQ and their product Babyscripts™ [13]. The clinical trial occurred in two Obstetric and
Gynecology (OB/GYN) offices in the United States: one in downtown Washington, DC and one in suburban
Maryland.  Prenatal care is provided at both locations by OB / GYN physicians and nurse midwives. Low-risk
women are cared for by Obstetrician Gynecologists at both locations and all deliveries take place at the
George Washington University Hospital in Washington, DC. Enrollment occurred between July 2015 and
March 2016. 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Eligible participants were women between 18 and 40-years-old, presenting for a first-trimester (up to 13
weeks gestational age) verification of pregnancy or new OB visit, and who were considered low-risk.  Low-

risk was defined as a singleton pregnancy with no previous diagnosis of essential hypertension, diabetes, renal
disease, collagen-vascular disease, maternal substance abuse, or other previously documented condition
posing a high risk of poor pregnancy outcome.  Drop-out criteria for the study included the antepartum
diagnosis  of  fetal  abnormalities,  placenta  previa,  intrauterine  growth  restriction,  pregnancy-induced
hypertension, gestational diabetes, or premature rupture of membranes.  Participants were also required to
regularly use a smartphone and be fluent in English. 
Allocation
Allocation into experimental group versus control group was based on the operating system of the patient’s
smartphone.  Patients with iOS-based smartphones (i.e. iPhones) were allocated to the experimental group;
patients with Android or Windows operating systems were allocated to the control group.  This allocation
system was chosen as a practical solution to the challenges of randomization and blinding.  Additionally, the
app had yet to be developed on the Android platform. Allocation was concealed until after consent was
obtained.
Study arms 
Participants who were assigned to the experimental group were instructed to download the mobile app and set
up the connected monitoring devices at the time of enrollment. Participants incurred no additional costs for
the app or connected devices. Participants allocated to the control arm were not given access to the mobile
app. The experimental group was also placed on an alternative prenatal care schedule of 8 expected visits as
compared to the typical 12-14 expected visits in the control group (Table 1.) The experimental visit schedule
was based on Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs Uncomplicated Pregnancy Guidelines [14]. For all
participants, prenatal care met established guidelines for management of uncomplicated pregnancies.

Data Collection
Patient demographics were obtained by self-report at the time of enrollment. Detailed patient characteristics
were also collected at the time of enrollment, including age, race, insurance status and ethnicity.  The primary
outcome of the study was the number of in-person prenatal care visits as assessed by patient chart review. As a
secondary outcome, all patients were evaluated for satisfaction with their prenatal care experience and
pregnancy outcomes. Patient satisfaction surveys were administered to participants at gestational weeks 16,
20, 25, 30, 35 and two weeks postpartum. Satisfaction survey consisted of sixteen questions using a four-point
Likert scale modified from HCAHPS survey instrument (http://www.hcahpsonline.org Centers for Medicare
&  Medicaid  Services,  Baltimore,  MD.  12/1/2017  accessed.)  In  addition,  six  questions  specific  to  the
Babyscripts platform were submitted to participants in the experimental group.  Participants who completed
all six surveys and responded to all related questionnaires were compensated with a $20 gift card to
Amazon™ at completion of the study.  An additional secondary outcome was obtained via a chart review for
significant clinical outcomes -- preeclampsia, eclampsia, NICU admissions, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, other
serious outcome per investigator judgment and route of delivery including Cesarean delivery rate. Chart
reviews were completed using trained abstractors with defined data collection sheets. 
Statistical Analysis 
We  compared  outcomes  between  study  arms  using  t-tests  for  continuous  outcomes  and  χ 2 tests  for
dichotomous outcomes. For differences in baseline characteristics between the two study groups, we used a
hierarchical generalized logistic or linear regression model that includes an indicator for the study arm. We
conducted descriptive heterogeneity of treatment effect analyses by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and highest
attained maternal education level. 
Description of Mobile App
The Babyscripts™ app was designed with two major goals: to deliver educational content via a mobile app
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/10520
[unpublished, non-peer-reviewed preprint]
Page 13/21
 JMIR Preprints
Marko et al
and to remotely monitor blood pressure and weight.  The educational content was based upon American
College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) standards and refined by a committee of four board-
certified obstetricians at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Medicine. Input from a variety
of other stakeholders including patients, midwives, and administrators was also obtained.  The mobile app
sends educational content to the expectant mother at gestation-appropriate times throughout pregnancy. This
information encompasses material covering pregnancy progression, pre-existing risk hazards such as alcohol
intake,  smoking  or  drug  abuse,  advice  to  address  these  risk  hazards,  dietary  and  nutritional  content,
breastfeeding  information,  guidelines  for  appropriate  weight  gain  and  warning  signs  for  pregnancy
complications. In addition, the app integrates with a Wi-Fi-connected scale and blood pressure cuff to provide
both feedback and alerts depending on the readings. The alerts were created to provide early warnings to
patients and providers about aberrant data points with the hope of providing early detection of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy and abnormal weight gain, indicating an increased risk of gestational diabetes,
nutritional deficiency, or edema associated with preeclampsia. 
Results
User Statistics 
181 women met inclusion criteria and were screened for enrollment.  Of those, 118 met screening criteria and
agreed to participate.  60 women were allocated to the experimental group and 58 women were allocated to
control group (Figure 1.) Of those, 13 participants in experimental group and 17 in control group discontinued
involvement in the study because they transferred care (n=11), developed high-risk characteristics (n=7),
experienced  a  miscarriage  (n=5)  or  requested  to  no  longer  participate  (n=2)  or  other  reasons  (n=5).
Ultimately, 47 participants in the experimental group and 41 in the control group were retained in the study
until completion and were analyzed.  There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics (Table 2.)
Evaluation Outcomes 
The experimental group had significantly fewer prenatal care visits (7.9 visits) than patients in control group
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/10520

Page 14/21
 JMIR Preprints
Marko et al
(10.2 visits), (P=0.012). (Table 2; Figure 2) Patient satisfaction measured over several intervals demonstrated
no difference in satisfaction between the experimental and control group. Satisfaction scores are aggregated
for all 16 questions that were asked of both control and experimental group at each time point during
gestation. For data visualization, the scores were normalized from 0 to 1 and then compared for statistical
differences  at  each  time  point.  Provider  surveys  demonstrated  aggregate  scores  demonstrating  highly
perceived quality and satisfaction with the virtual care platform. There was no statistical difference in patient
satisfaction (P>0.05) or provider satisfaction (P>0.05) in either group (Figure 3.)
 
Although maternal and fetal outcomes were tracked, the study was not powered to demonstrate the effect of
the virtual care platform on maternal or fetal outcomes. We identified one adverse fetal event of stillbirth at 38
weeks  gestation.  Investigation  of  the  case  revealed  patient  had  an  uncomplicated  pregnancy  and  was
compliant with prenatal care schedule of experimental group. Her obstetrician saw her in person within three
days of the fetal demise at which time normal fetal movement and fetal heart tones were identified. Workup
revealed a likely fetal-maternal hemorrhage unrelated to study protocol.
Discussion 
Principal Results
Pregnant women represent a promising target for digital health applications. Unlike digital health apps that
target chronically ill or elderly populations, pregnant women are a young and healthy population.  A mobile
health app that targets pregnant women may facilitate integration of prenatal care into other aspects of their
family and professional life. In addition, pregnancy is a unique period of life when healthy behaviors
including exercise, diet and sleep take on greater importance.  As such, women are highly engaged with their
health care decisions during pregnancy and may be more receptive to educational programs that can be
delivered through a mobile health app. Finally, the majority of prenatal care visits are scheduled to exchange
educational information to the patient or weight and blood pressure data to the provider.  Both of these
exchanges are especially amenable to communication via mobile technology or remote monitors.  Ultimately,
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/10520

the app does not replace in-person visits but may replace some of the current activities that occur at each visit.
If the app can communicate basic educational components of prenatal care, the in-person visits may allow for
more individualized discussions. 
As part of this study, several important elements emerged as critical to the success of a mobile prenatal care
app. First, the initial assessment is critical to identifying high-risk versus normal-risk on initial assessment;
second, accurate communication of patient data to the provider is necessary to assess for early signs of
pregnancy complications; third, educational information must be provided at the appropriate time-period
during pregnancy; fourth, educational information should be targeted to individual patient (e.g., not all women
need regular reminders about the importance of smoking cessation); and fifth, a clear explanation that the role
of the mobile app is to augment and not replace the obstetrician or midwife. 
Limitations
There are several limitations to our study. First, the use of a quasi-randomization scheme where participants
were allocated by type of phone creates potential confounders, as it is possible that iOS users differ from non-
iOS users.  However, there was no significant difference in age, race, education level, gravity or parity
between the cohorts.  We did not collect data on differences in household income, a possible confounder. The
second risk concerns the possibility of contamination across groups.  It is possible that by reducing visits in
the experimental group, physicians were more likely to reduce the visits in all patients. However, given there
was a statistically significant difference in visit schedule this was unlikely to confound this cohort. Third, the
mobile prenatal care app was prescribed as part of the reduced care schedule and it is unknown if a reduced
care schedule might have been effective without the mobile care app or with a different solution.  Finally, we
have limited information regarding emergency visits or phone calls that may have occurred outside of the
chart review or the direct patient calls.  It is possible that there were some therapeutic interactions missed in
both control and experimental group. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, satisfaction was unchanged and visits were reduced through the use of prenatal mobile care
