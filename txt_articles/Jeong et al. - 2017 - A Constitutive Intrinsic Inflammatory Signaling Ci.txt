SUMMARY
Androgen deprivation therapy is the most effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer, 
however, almost all cancer eventually become castration-resistant, and the underlying mechanisms 
are largely unknown. Here, we show that an intrinsic constitutively activated feed-forward 
signaling circuit composed of IκBα/NF-κB(p65), miR-196b-3p, Meis2, PPP3CC is formed during 
the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This circuit controls the expression 
of stem cell transcription factors that drives the high tumorigenicity of CRPC cells. Interrupting 
the circuit by targeting its individual components significantly impairs the tumorigenicity and 
CRPC development. Notably, constitutive activation of IκBα/NF-κB(p65) in this circuit is not 
dependent on the activation of traditional IKKβ/NF-κB pathways that are important in normal 
immune responses. Therefore, our studies present deep insight into the bona fide mechanisms 
underlying castration-resistance and provide the foundation for the development of CRPC 
therapeutic strategies that would be highly efficient while avoiding indiscriminate IKK/NF-κB 
inhibition in normal cells.

 INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy, and the second-leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality in men in Western countries (Amaral et al., 2012; Karantanos et al., 
2013). In tumors confined to the prostate, radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are 
effective, however, for late stage disseminated disease, current therapies are merely palliative 
(Amaral et al., 2012). Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical survival pathway for 
prostate cancer cells, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an initial systemic therapy 
for advanced PCa and is also used as an adjuvant to local therapy for high-risk diseases. 
Although a majority of patients initially respond to ADT, the responses in advanced disease 
are transient and almost all eventually develop castration resistance (Alibhai et al., 2006; 
Amaral et al., 2012; Karantanos et al., 2013). Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is 
associated with a very poor prognosis, and the treatment of which remains a serious clinical 
challenge (Alibhai et al., 2006; Amaral et al., 2012; Karantanos et al., 2013). Understanding 
the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of castrate resistance is therefore needed to 
develop novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.
Inflammatory signaling has been linked to various cancers. However, how it is constitutively 
activated and maintained in cancer cells and its difference from normal immune responses 
are largely unknown (Coussens and Werb, 2002; Grivennikov et al., 2010; Iliopoulos et al., 
2009; Rokavec and Luo, 2012; Rokavec et al., 2012). NF-κB transcription factors play 
essential roles in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, inflammation, and 
cell survival (Delhase and Karin, 1999). A number of stimuli activate NF-κB, mostly 
through IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the 
IκB inhibitory proteins. The IKK complex consists of two highly homologous kinase 
subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a nonenzymatic regulatory component, IKKγ/NEMO 
(Ghosh and Karin, 2002). There are two NF-κB activation pathways. The classical NF-κB 
activation pathway is triggered in response to microbial and viral infections and exposure to

 proinflammatory cytokines that activate the tripartite IKK complex leading to 
phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBs. This pathway depends mainly on the IKKβ 
catalytic subunit (Ghosh and Karin, 2002; Luo et al., 2005). The alternative pathway leads to 
selective activation of p52:RelB NF-κB dimers by inducing processing of the NF-κB2/p100 
precursor that binds to the RelB NF-κB subunit in the cytoplasm (Ghosh and Karin, 2002; 
Luo et al., 2005). As NF-κB plays important roles in tumorigenesis, progression, and 
metastasis, it has been regarded as one of the most important targets for cancer therapy 
(Karin, 2006; Luo et al., 2005; Perkins, 2012). However, the application of IKK/NF-κB 
inhibitors for the treatment of human cancer is impeded by severe side effects related to 
immunosuppression, due to the indiscriminate inhibition of IKK/NF-κB in normal immune 
cells. Therefore, the strategies that specifically targeting NF-κB activity only in tumor cells 
while sparing NF-κB immune response in normal cells would be highly desirable.
Here, by investigating the primary cells directly isolated from mouse primary or castration-
resistant allograft/xenograft prostate tumors and analyzing human prostate tumors, we report 
that a constitutively activated signaling circuit composed of IκBα/NF-κB(p65), 
miR-196b-3p, Meis2, PPP3CC is formed intrinsically in prostate cancer cells during the 
emergence of CRPC. This constitutive signaling circuit drives the high tumorigenicity and 
aggressiveness of CRPC. Importantly, although IκBα/NF-κB(p65) are included in this 
signaling circuit, the constitutive activation of NF-κB in the circuit is not dependent on 
traditional IKKβ/NF-κB activation pathways. Thus, our studies provide the foundation for 
the development of therapeutic strategies that target constitutive NF-κB specifically in tumor 
cells while avoid NF-κB inhibition in normal immune cells.
RESULTS
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells are much more tumorigenic than 
primary prostate cancer (PPC) cells
To investigate the mechanisms underlying castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
development, we employed a prostate cancer (PCa) allograft mouse model that mimics 
human CRPC development (Ammirante et al., 2010; Watson et al., 2005). In this model, an 
androgen-dependent (AD) mouse prostate cancer cell line, Myc-CaP, which was isolated 
from a c-Myc transgenic prostate cancer mouse with PCa (Watson et al., 2005), was 
employed. Myc-CaP cells can grow as tumors in immune competent FVB mice in an AD 
manner, when host mice are castrated, Myc-CaP allografts shrink, and later re-grow and 
become AR-positive CRPC (Figure S1A). To compare the tumorigenicity of CRPC cells and 
primary prostate cancer (PPC) cells, primary cells from PPC and CRPC tumors were 
isolated. Cells with different dilutions were then inoculated into FVB male mice for tumor 
development (Figure 1A). We found that five CRPC cells were enough to initiate a tumor at 
about 30 days after inoculation, while mice inoculated with five cells of cultured Myc-CaP 
or PPC cells did not develop tumor during 2-years of observation time. Although all mice 
inoculated with 10 cells of CRPC, PPC, or cultured Myc-CaP cells developed tumor, the 
tumor onsets for each cell type were very different, with CRPC cells developing tumors at 
about 30 days, PPC cells at about 60 days, and cultured Myc-CaP cells at about 100 days 
after inoculation (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C). These results suggest that primary cells

 isolated from CRPC are much more tumorigenic than the primary cells from PPC. 
Consistently, CRPC cells proliferated and migrated much more rapidly (Figure 1B and 1C), 
and formed much more colonies in soft agar (Figure 1D) and tumor spheres in suspension 
culture (Figure 1E) than PPC cells.
It should be emphasized that the primary cells from PPC had much stronger tumorigenicity 
than the cultured Myc-CaP cells, suggesting cultured tumor cell lines have lost some 
properties of original tumor cells in the tumor mass. Therefore, Cancer cells directly purified 
from PPC or CRPC tumors (thereafter called PPC cells or CRPC cells) are much more 
representative than cultured Myc-CaP cell line. All our experiments were carried out in PPC 
and CRPC cells, and cultured Myc-CaP cell line was used for control purpose.
CRPC cells express much higher levels of stem cell markers than PPC cells
As tumorigenicity is related to stemness of cancer cells, we analyzed the expression of the 
prostate cancer stem cell markers, CD49f and Sca-1 (Mulholland et al., 2009; Xin et al., 
2005), in PPC and CRPC cells by qRT-PCR, and found that the expression of CD49f and 
Sca-1 mRNA in CRPC cells were significantly higher than PPC cells (Figure 1F). We also 
measured the percentage of positive CD49f and Sca-1 cells in PPC and CRPC cells by FACS 
analysis, and found that about 99% CRPC cells while only about 5% PPC cells were both 
CD49f and Sca-1 positive (Figure 1G and S1D). These results indicate CRPC cells have 
much more cancer stem-like cell populations than PPC cells.
IKKβ-independent NF-κB (p65) constitutive activation drives the tumorigenicity of CRPC 
cells
To understand the underlying mechanisms by which CRPC cells are more tumorigenic than 
PPC cells, we employed a kinase inhibitor library to identify kinase(s) that promotes the 
tumorigenicity in CRPC cells. We found that CRPC cells were much more sensitive than 
PPC cell to the treatment of inhibitors, BAY11-7082 or Celastrol, which can inhibit IκBα or 
NF-κB (Figure 2A and S2A). However, PPC, CRPC, and cultured Myc-CaP cells had 
similar sensitivities to other kinase inhibitors, including SC 514 that can inhibit IKKβ 
(Figure 2A and S2A). We found that the phosphorylation of IκBα and the activity of NF-κB 
(p65) were increased in CRPC cells as compared with PPC cells (Figure 2B, 2C, and S2B–
D). Although both SC 514 and BAY 11-7082 blocked LPS-induced expression of p-IκBα in 
both PPC and CRPC cells (Figure S2E), BAY 11-7082 decreased the basal levels of p-IκBα 
expression and NF-κB DNA binding activity while SC 514 had no such effect in CRPC cells 
(Figure S2E and S2F). Furthermore, IKKβ and IKK complex immunoprecipitated from PPC 
and CRPC cells had similar activity in the phosphorylation of GST-IκBα (1–54) in vitro 
(Figure S2G).
Consistently, inhibition of IκBα and NF-κB by inhibitors or p65 knockdown by p65 siRNA 
significantly decreased CRPC cells’ viability (Figure 2A, S2H, and S2I), colony formation 
in soft agar (Figure 2D, S2H, and S2J), and tumor sphere formation in suspension culture 
(Figure 2E, S2H, and S2K) while inhibition of IKKβ by inhibitor or IKKβ knockdown by 
IKKβ siRNA had no such effects on CRPC cells (Figure 2A, S2H–K). We also found that 
NF-κB/p65 stable knockdown did not affect the initiation and development of primary

 tumors (PPC) (Figure 2F, and S2L), whereas p65 knockdown significantly suppressed CRPC 
development (Figure 2F, and S2O–Q). In contrast, IKKβ knockdown neither affected the 
initiation and development of PPC nor the development of CRPC (Figure 2G, S2M–N, S2R, 
and S2S). These results indicate that constitutive activated NF-κB (p65) drives CRPC 
development, which is not dependent on IKKβ.
Previous reports suggest that nuclear IKKα plays a crucial role in prostate cancer 
progression and metastasis (Ammirante et al., 2013; Ammirante et al., 2010; Luo et al., 
2007). A recent report suggests that a fraction of phosphorylated and sumoylated IκBα 
binds to the chromatin and regulates a subset of polycomb target genes in keratinocytes 
(Mulero et al., 2013). We found that although the expression of nuclear IKKα and nuclear p-
IKKα/β was increased in CRPC cells, IκBα did not translocate to nuclei of both CRPC and 
PPC cells (Figure S2T and S2U), suggesting that nuclear IKKα is not related to the 
increased p-IκBα in CRPC cells.
Constitutive NF-κB (p65) activation in CRPC is controlled by PPP3CC-mediated down-
regulation of p-IκBα
The NF-κB (p65) activation is usually regulated by IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IκBs 
(Luo et al., 2005). However, our results suggest that the constitutive IκBα phosphorylation 
and NF-κB (p65) activation in CRPC cells are not dependent on IKKβ (Figure 2A, 2D, 2E, 
S2E–K, and S2U). To investigate how IκBα/NF-κB(p65) is constitutively activated in 
CRPC cells, a phosphatase inhibitor library was employed to screen the phosphatase(s) that 
contribute to the constitutive IκBα phosphorylation in CRPC cells. We found that treatment 
with the phosphatase inhibitors, Cypermethrin and Deltamethrin, which inhibit serine/
threonine-protein phosphatase 2b (PP2B), increased p-IκBα expression and p65 activity in 
PPC cells (Figure 3A, 3B, and S3A). However, the increased phosphorylation of IκBα after 
PP2B inhibition is not dependent on IKKβ (Figure S3B).
PP2B, also called Calcineurin (CN), consists of a catalytic subunit (CNA) and a regulatory 
subunit (CNB) (Shi, 2009). CNA has three isoforms: CNAα (PPP3CA), CNAβ (PPP3CB), 
and CNAγ (PPP3CC), while CNB has two isoforms: CNBα (PPP3R1) and CNBβ 
(PPP3R2). We found that the expression of PPP3CC mRNA (Figure S3C) and protein 
(Figure 3C) was down regulated in CRPC cells as compared with PPC cells, whereas there 
were no differences in the expression of other PP2B catalytic isoforms between PPC and 
CRPC cells (Figure S3C). Furthermore, we found that PPP3CC knockdown significantly 
increased the expression of p-IκBα (Figure 3D) and enhanced the activity of p65 in PPC 
cells (Figure 3E), while overexpression of PPP3CC resulted in decreased p-IκBα expression 
(Figure 3F) and reduced p65 activity in CRPC cells (Figure 3G). In addition, PPP3CC can 
directly dephosphorylate p-IκBα in vitro (Figure 3H). These results suggest that PPP3CC 
down-regulation contributes to the constitutive IκBα phosphorylation and p65 activation in 
CRPC cells (Figure S3D).
Importantly, we found that overexpression of PPP3CC in CRPC cells decreased while 
knockdown of PPP3CC in PPC cells increased colony formation in soft agar (Figure 3I, 3K, 
and S3E–J) and tumor sphere formation in suspension culture (Figure 3J, 3L, and S3K). 
Overexpression of p65 restored the colony and tumor sphere formation capability of

 PPP3CC-overexpression CRPC cells in soft agar (Figure S3L and S3M) and in suspension 
culture (Figure S3N). We also found that stable overexpression of PPP3CC significantly 
suppressed CRPC development in FVB allograft mouse models (Figure 3M and S3O–P). 
These results suggest that PPP3CC functions as a tumor suppressor in CRPC development.
Constitutive NF-κB (p65) induces the expression of miR-196b-3p in CRPC
We screened miRNA expression in Myc-CaP, PPC, and CRPC cells by miRNA array 
analysis, and found that the expression of a group of miRNAs had more than two times 
difference between CRPC and PPC cells (Figure 4A, S4A, and S4B). To examine whether 
the differential expression of these miRNAs is related to constitutive NF-κB (p65) activation 
in CRPC cells, p65 was knocked down in CRPC cells by p65 siRNA and the expression of 
these miRNAs were examined. We found that knockdown of p65 significantly decreased the 
expression of both primary and mature miR-196b-3p while the expression levels of other 
miRNAs were not significantly changed (Figure 4B and S4C). Consistently, overexpression 
of p65 in PPC cells increased the expression of primary and mature miR-196b-3p (Figure 
4C and S4D). Furthermore, we found that the expression of primary and mature 
miR-196b-3p was significantly decreased in castration-resistant allograft tumors derived 
from p65 stable knockdown Myc-CaP cells (Figure 4D and S4E). These results indicate that 
constitutively activated p65 controls the expression of miR-196b-3p in CRPC cells.
To examine whether p65 binds to the promoter of miR-196b, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in PPC and CRPC cells (Table S1). We 
found that the binding of p65 to miR-196b promoter at −592 ~ −422 region was significantly 
increased in CRPC cells as compared with PPC cells (Figure 4E and S4F), suggesting that 
p65 binds to miR-196b-3p promoter and regulates its expression in CRPC cells.
Since our findings showed that PPP3CC suppressed IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB 
(p65) activation (Figure 3D–G), we asked whether PPP3CC also regulates the expression of 
miR-196b-3p in CRPC. As expected, knockdown of PPP3CC in PPC cells increased 
miR-196b-3p expression (Figure S4G), while overexpression of PPP3CC in CRPC cells 
decreased miR-196b-3p expression (Figure S4H). We then asked whether the regulation of 
PPP3CC on miR-196b-3p is mediated by p65. PPC cells were transfected with PPP3CC 
siRNA to knock down PPP3CC, followed by transfection with p65 siRNA, 48 hr later the 
expression of miR-196b-3p were examined. We found knockdown of PPP3CC in PPC cells 
increased the activity of p65 and the expression of miR-196b-3p, knockdown of p65 blocked 
the induction of miR-196b-3p (Figure 4F). Similarly, we found that overexpression of 
PPP3CC in CRPC cells decreased the activity of p65 and the expression of miR-196b-3p, 
restoring the p65 activity by overexpression of p65 blocked the reduction of miR-196b-3p 
expression (Figure 4G). These results suggest that PPP3CC controls p65-directed induction 
of miR-196b-3p (Figure S4I).
Furthermore, we found that miR-196b overexpression cells formed more colonies in soft 
agar (Figure 4H, S4J, and S4K) and had more tumor sphere formation than control cells 
(Figure 4I). MiR-196b overexpression cells developed CRPC much more rapidly than 
control cells in castrated FVB mice (Figure 4J, S4L, and S4M). These results indicate that 
miR-196b-3p promotes CRPC development.

 The expression of Meis2, a target of miR-196b-3p, is controlled by PPP3CC-directed 
inhibition of IκBα/p65/miR-196b
We employed DIANA-microT v5.0 program (Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013) to screen the 
gene candidates targeted by miR-196b-3p. Top candidates were further validated by their 
differential expression in PPC and CRPC cells (Figure S5A). We found that the expression 
of Meis2, a strong target candidate of miR-196b-3p, was significantly decreased in CRPC 
cells (Figure 5A and S5B). Overexpression of miR-196b in PPC cells resulted in significant 
decrease of Meis2 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 5B and S5C), while inhibition of 
miR-196b-3p in CRPC cells increased Meis2 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 5C and 
S5D). Furthermore, the expression of Meis2 was significantly decreased in allograft tumor 
tissues derived from miR-196b-overexpression Myc-CaP cells (Figure 5D and S5E). These 
results suggest that miR-196b-3p suppresses Meis2 expression.
Furthermore, we found that Meis2 was also regulated by PPP3CC and p65. Knockdown of 
PPP3CC or overexpression of p65 in PPC cells decreased the expression of Meis2 (Figure 
S5F), while overexpression of PPP3CC or knockdown of p65 in CRPC cells increased the 
expression of Meis2 (Figure S5G). MiR-196b-3p inhibitors could block PPP3CC-
knockdown or p65 overexpression-mediated reduction of Meis2 expression in PPC cells 
(Figure 5E), while miR-196b overexpression could block PPP3CC overexpression or p65 
knockdown-induced Meis2 expression in CRPC cells (Figure 5F). These results suggest that 
the expression of Meis2 is controlled by PPP3CC-directed inhibition of IκBα/p65/
miR-196b-3p (Figure S5H).
Meis2, a member of Meis family, is a homeodomain transcription factor. A gene array study 
showed that the expression of Meis2 was reversely correlated with the prognosis of prostate 
cancer patients (Chen et al., 2012). We found that knockdown of Meis2 in PPC cells 
significantly increased while overexpression of Meis2 in CRPC cells significantly decreased 
the colony formation in soft agar and tumor sphere formation in suspension culture (Figure 
5G–J and S5I–O). Meis2 stable overexpression cells developed CRPC in FVB mice much 
slower than control cells (Figure 5K, S5P, and S5Q). These results suggest that Meis2 
suppresses CRPC development.
Meis2, PPP3CC, p65, and miR-196b form a feed-forward circuit in CRPC
Interestingly, we found Meis2 also regulate PPP3CC in CRPC cells. Knockdown of Meis2 in 
PPC cells by siRNA decreased PPP3CC mRNA (Figure S6A) and protein expression (Figure 
6A). ChIP assay showed that the binding of Meis2 to the endogenous PPP3CC (−500/−341) 
promoter was decreased in CRPC cells as compared with PPC cells (Figure 6B, S6B, and 
Table S1), suggesting that Meis2 regulates the transcription of PPP3CC.
Given the findings that PPP3CC directs the inhibition of IκBα/p65/miR-196b, we predicted 
that Meis2 may also regulate p65 activity and miR-196b expression. As expected, 
knockdown of Meis2 in PPC cells increased p65 activity and miR-196b expression (Figure 
S6C and S6D), while overexpression of Meis2 in CRPC cells decreased p65 activity and 
miR-196b expression (Figure S6E and S6F). Furthermore, We found that the regulation of 
Meis2 on p65 and miR-196b was mediated by PPP3CC. Knockdown of Meis2 in PPC cells

 decreased the expression of PPP3CC and induced the expression of miR-196b-3p and p65 
activity, restoring the expression of PPP3CC blocked the induction of p65 activity and 
miR-196b-3p expression (Figure 6C and 6D). Similarly, overexpression of Meis2 in CRPC 
cells induced the expression of PPP3CC and reduced the expression of miR-196b-3p and 
p65 activity, knockdown of PPP3CC blocked the reduction of p65 activity and miR-196b-3p 
expression (Figure 6E and 6F). These results suggest that Meis2 controls PPP3CC-directed 
inhibition of IκBα/p65/miR-196b-3p. Therefore, Meis2, PPP3CC, IκBα/p65, and miR-196b 
form a feed-forward signaling circuit, and the constitutive activation of this signaling circuit 
in CRPC is not dependent on traditional NF-κB activation pathways (Figure 6G).
The constitutive signaling circuit drives the expression of cancer stem cell transcription 
factors in CRPC
We showed that CRPC cells were more cancer stem cell-like than PPC cells (Figure 1E–G). 
To examine which stem cell transcription factors are related to this phenotype, the 
expression of a group of stem cell transcription factors was analyzed by qRT-PCR in PPC 
and CRPC cells. We found that the expression of Fosl1, Gli3, Wwtr1, Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, 
and Nanog were increased in CRPC cells as compared with PPC cells (Figure S6G). 
Furthermore, knockdown of p65 or inhibition of miR-196b-3p in CRPC cells decreased 
(Figure 6H, 6I, and S6H) while the overexpression of p65 or miR-196b in PPC cells 
increased the expression of Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog (Figure S6I and S6J). Whereas, 
knockdown of PPP3CC or Meis2 in PPC cells increased (Figure S6K and S6L) while 
overexpression of PPP3CC or Meis2 in CRPC cells decreased the expression of Twist2, 
Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog (Figure 6J and 6K). Consistently, the expression of Twist2, Sox2, 
Oct4, and Nanog protein was highly increased in CRPC cells (Figure S6M). The expression 
of Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog was decreased in allograft tumors derived from p65 
knockdown (Figure 6L), PPP3CC overexpression (Figure 6M), or Meis2 overexpression 
(Figure 6N) Myc-CaP cells while increased in allograft tumors derived from miR-196b 
overexpression (Figure 6O) Myc-CaP cells. These results suggest that the constitutive 
signaling circuit drives the expression of stem cell transcription factors, Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, 
and Nanog in CRPC cells.
Since p65 and Meis2 are two transcriptional factors in this constitutive signaling circuit, we 
asked whether p65 and/or Meis2 directly regulate the expression of stem cell transcription 
factors, Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog in CRPC cells. ChIP assays showed that the binding 
of p65 to Twist2 promoter at −47 ~ +79 region (Figure S6N), to Sox2 promoter at +735 ~ 
+905 region (Figure S6O), to Oct4 promoter at +282 ~ +386 region (Figure S6P), and to 
Nanog promoter at −531 ~ −381 region (Figure S6Q) in CRPC cells was significantly 
increased as compared with PPC cells. However, no binding of Meis2 to the promoters of 
these stem cell transcription factors was found (Figure S6R–U). These results suggest that 
constitutive p65 in CRPC cells directly regulates the expression of stem cell transcription 
factors, Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog in CRPC cells.
To analyze if the constitutive p65 regulates the classical NF-κB target genes in CRPC cells, 
we examined a group of known cancer relevant NF-κB targets, including cytokines, 
chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and apoptosis related regulators (Pahl, 1999) by qRT-

 PCR. We found that the expression of some of these genes was increased in CRPC cells as 
compared with PPC cells (Figure S6V). Knockdown of p65 in CRPC cells decreased the 
expression of CD44, Icam1, Ltb, Traf2, Vcam1, and Xiap (Figure S6W). The expression of 
some NF-κB target genes, for instance Cxcl15, were highly increased in CRPC cells, but 
were not decreased in p65 knocked-down CRPC cells, suggesting these genes are not 
regulated by constitutive NF-κB in CRPC cells.
The constitutive signaling circuit is recaptured in human prostate cancer xenograft mouse 
models
To exclude the possibility that the constitutive signaling circuit formed in CRPC cells is 
mouse model-specific, we established a human PCa xenograft mouse model. In this model 
an androgen-sensitive human PCa cell line, LNCaP, was inoculated into Rag1−/− mice to 
generate androgen-dependent primary tumors (LN-PPC), when the tumor size reached 
around 500 mm3 mice were castrated, the tumor shrank and regrew. When the tumor size 
reached around 500 mm3 mice were euthanized and castration-resistant tumors (LN-CRPC) 
were collected (Ammirante et al., 2010). We analyzed the p65 activity and the expression of 
p-IκBα, IκBα, PPP3CC, Meis2, and miR-196b-3p in LN-PPC and LN-CRPC cells. We 
found that the expression of miR-196b-3p and p-IκBα protein and the p65 activity were 
increased while the expression of IκBα, PPP3CC, and Meis2 protein was decreased in LN-
CRPC cells as compared with LN-PPC cells (Figure 7A–C, and S7A). We also found that 
the expression of the stem cell transcription factors, Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog, in LN-
CRPC cells was significantly increased as compared with LN-PPC cells (Figure 7D). These 
results indicate that the constitutively activated feed-forward signaling circuit identified in 
Myc-CaP allograft mouse models also exists in human PCa LNCaP xenograft model.
The constitutive signaling circuit is manifest in human prostate tumors
To test whether the constitutive signaling circuit identified in mouse models is relevant to 
clinical human prostate cancer, the expression of p-IκBα protein was detected by Western 
blot and the expression of primary miR-196b, PPP3CC, and Meis2 mRNA was examined by 
qRT-PCR in 80 cases of human prostate cancer tissues. We found that the expression of p-
IκBα protein in human prostate cancer tissues was positively correlated with the expression 
of miR-196b (Figure 7E), while reversely related to the expression of PPP3CC (Figure 7F) 
and Meis2 (Figure 7G). Consistently, the expression of miR-196b in human prostate cancer 
tissues was reversely correlated with the expression of PPP3CC (Figure 7H) and Meis2 
(Figure 7I), and the expression of PPP3CC was positively correlated with the expression of 
Meis2 (Figure 7J). Similarly, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of paraffin-embedded 
human prostate tumor tissue sections showed that prostate cancers with high expression of 
p-IκBα and nuclear p65 had low expression of PPP3CC, Meis2, and IκBα, while prostate 
cancers with low expression of p-IκBα and nuclear p65 had high expression of PPP3CC, 
Meis2, and IκBα (Figure S7B). These results suggest that the constitutive signaling circuit 
is manifested in human prostate cancer.
Importantly, survival time was much longer in patients having tumors with low levels of p-
IκBα and miR-196b and high levels of PPP3CC and Meis2 expression 
(pIκBαLowmiR-196bLowPPP3CCHighMeis2High) than patients having tumors with high

 levels of p-IκBα and miR-196b and low levels of PPP3CC and Meis2 expression 
(pIκBαHighmiR-196bHighPPP3CCLowMeis2Low) (Figure 7K, 7L, and S7C). Furthermore, 
the expression of Twist2 (Figure S7D), Sox2 (Figure S7E), Oct4 (Figure S7F), and Nanog 
(Figure S7G) was significantly higher in tumors with p-
IκBαHighmiR-196bHighPPP3CCLowMeis2Low than tumors with p-
IκBαLowmiR-196bLowPPP3CCHighMeis2High. These results support that the constitutive 
signaling circuit drives tumorigenicity and advanced prostate cancer development.
DISCUSSION
Several cellular and molecular mechanisms are reported related to CRPC development, 
including an increase in intratumoral androgen biosynthesis, aberrant AR activation, 
crosstalk with other oncogenic pathways, reactivation of EMT processes, and upregulation 
of genes that regulate stemness and self-renewal (Dutt and Gao, 2009; Karantanos et al., 
2013). In the present study, we show that a constitutively activated inflammatory signaling 
circuit composed of IκBα/NF-κB(p65), miR-196b-3p, Meis2, PPP3CC is emerged in PCa 
cells during the progression from androgen-sensitive PCa to CRPC. This constitutive 
signaling circuit drives the high tumorigenicity of CRPC, and is correlated with the poor 
prognosis of prostate cancer patients.
Considerable evidences indicate that IKK/NF-κB signaling pathways are involved in 
carcinogenesis, cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance, and therefore NF-κB 
has been regarded as one of the most important targets for cancer therapy (Karin, 2006; Luo 
et al., 2005; Perkins, 2012). However, the application of IKK/NF-κB inhibitors for the 
treatment of human cancer is impeded by severe side effects due to the indiscriminate 
inhibition of IKK/NF-κB in normal immune cells. Although certain onco-viral proteins, 
cancer-associated chromosomal translocations, mutations, autocrine and paracrine 
production of proinflammatory cytokines or chronic infections can activate NF-κB in tumor 
cells, the mechanisms that cause and maintain the constitutive NF-κB activation in tumor 
cells are largely unclear, and the difference between constitutive NF-κB signaling in tumor 
cells and the NF-κB immune (response) signaling in normal immune cells is unknown 
(Rokavec and Luo, 2012; Rokavec et al., 2012). Our studies demonstrate that constitutive 
NF-κB activation in CRPC cells is emerged and maintained by a feed-forward signaling 
circuit, where the constitutive IκBα/NF-κB(p65) drives the expression of miR-196b-3p that 
inhibits the expression of Meis2 and PPP3CC, down-regulated PPP3CC is unable to 
suppress p-IκBα, leading to constitutive IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. 
Notably, the constitutive activation of NF-κB in CRPC cells is not dependent on traditional 
IKK/NF-κB activation pathways, and it is the constitutively activated NF-κB signaling 
circuit in PCa cells that drives CRPC development. Therefore, selective inhibition of the 
constitutive NF-κB in tumor cells by targeting the individual non-IκBα/NF-κB components 
of the constitutive signaling circuit will keep the strong anti-cancer efficacy of NF-κB 
inhibition while avoid NF-κB suppression in normal (immune) cells that would be highly 
efficient and relatively low or free of toxic side effects related to indiscriminate IKK/NF-κB 
inhibition.

 MiR-196b is a member of the miR-196 sub-family, which comprises miR-196a and 
miR-196b (Chen et al., 2011). Accumulating studies demonstrates that miR-196 plays 
critical roles in normal development and in the pathogenesis of human diseases such as 
cancer (He et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2014). Our studies demonstrate that miR-196b-3p is one of 
the key components of the constitutively activated signaling circuit, where the expression of 
miR-196b-3p is driven by constitutively activated NF-κB (p65) in CRPC cells. Inhibition of 
miR-196b-3p suppresses while overexpression of miR-196b-3p promotes CRPC 
development in vitro and in mouse models. Several genes have been reported as the direct 
targets of miR-196b, including HOX-A in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Schotte et al., 
2010), HOX-C8 in breast cancer (Li et al., 2010), and NME4 (Nucleoside Diphosphate 
Kinase 4) in oral cancer (Lu et al., 2014). Our studies demonstrate that Meis2 is the major 
target of miR-196b-3p in CRPC, NF-κB-directed expression of miR-196b-3p downregulates 
Meis2 in CRPC cells.
Meis2 is an essential developmental gene in mammals (Kondo et al., 2014). Meis2 has been 
reported highly expressed in human neuroblastoma cell lines and is required for 
neuroblastoma cell survival and proliferation (Zha et al., 2014), whereas strong nuclear 
Meis2 expression is related with a better overall survival of ovarian cancer patients (Crijns et 
al., 2007). In human prostate cancer, Meis2 is decreased in poor-prognosis tumors (Chen et 
al., 2012). Our studies demonstrate that Meis2 is one of the important components of the 
constitutively activated signaling circuit, where it mediates NF-κB/miR-196b-3p-induced 
suppression of PPP3CC in CRPC cells. Overexpression of Meis2 disrupts the constitutive 
signaling circuit and significantly inhibits CRPC development.
It has been reported that calcineurin (also called protein phosphatase 2B or PP2B) can either 
increase or inhibit NF-κB activity at specific conditions in different cell-types (Pons and 
Torres-Aleman, 2000; Trushin et al., 1999). Our studies show that the down-regulation of 
PPP3CC, the calcineurin catalytic subunit γ-isoform, is related to the constitutive IκBα 
phosphorylation and NFκB activation in CRPC cells, PPP3CC can directly dephosphorylate 
p-IκBα in vitro. The role of PPP3CC in cancer is unclear. Prostate cancer tissue microarray 
data show that decreased expression of PPP3CC in prostate tumors is associated with 
prostate cancer recurrence (Hornstein et al., 2008). Our studies demonstrated that PPP3CC is 
one of the important components of the constitutive signaling circuit, where IκBα/NF-
κB(p65)/miR-196b-3p/Meis2-mediated suppression of PPP3CC leads to constitutive IκBα 
phosphorylation and NF-κB(p65) activation in CRPC cells. Overexpression of PPP3CC 
disrupts the constitutive signaling circuit and significantly inhibits CRPC development.
Although it is still in debate regarding the role of cancer stem cells in primary tumorigenesis, 
it has been believed that one or a few cancer stem cells can generate a secondary tumor 
(Beck and Blanpain, 2013; Kreso and Dick, 2014). In our studies we found that the 
differences of tumorigenicity between PPC and CRPC cells were much bigger in allograft 
mouse models when mice inoculated with low cell numbers. Although there are big 
differences of cancer stem-like cell populations between PPC and CRPC cells, when 
inoculated more than 100 cells, the numbers of cancer stem cells in PPC cells is enough to 
generate a secondary tumor in a similar speed to CRPC cells, while when inoculated low cell

 numbers (10 or 5 cells), the amount of cancer stem cells in these number of PPC cells is not 
enough to generate a secondary tumor in a similar speed to CRPC cells.
This highly tumorigenic feature of CRPC cells is mediated and maintained by the 
constitutive inflammatory feed-forward signaling circuit that controls the expression of a 
group of stem cell transcription factors, including Twist2, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. 
Disrupting this circuit by targeting any of its individual components blocks the expression of 
these transcription factors and significantly impairs CRPC development, suggesting that by 
riding on this constitutive signaling circuit the “power” of each individual component of this 
circuit is significantly amplified. Therefore, disrupting this circuit by targeting any of its 
individual components would be a powerful way for the suppression of CRPC.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cells and reagents
Myc-CaP, an androgen sensitive prostate cancer cell line derived from c-Myc transgenic 
mouse, and LNCaP, a human prostate carcinoma cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 
medium supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 
and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosp here containing 5% CO2. The inhibitors used 
in the experiments were purchased from Calbiochem or Enzo Life Science. Details on cells 
and reagents can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Preparation of primary cancer cells from prostate cancer mouse models
FVB and Rag1−/− mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained under 
specific pathogen-free conditions with phytoestrogen-free food and water ad libitum. The 
mouse experimental protocols were approved by the Scripps Florida IACUC, and were 
followed the guidelines of the National Institute of Health. Details on preparation of primary 
cancer cells can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Prostate cancer development in animal models
FVB male mice (6 week-old) were used for allograft model. To determine the tumorigenicity 
of Myc-CaP, PPC, and CRPC cells, cells with series of dilution were mixed with GFR 
Matrigel and inoculated into FVB mice subcutaneously. Details on prostate cancer 
development in animal models can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using Student’s t test. 
All p values are two-tailed, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
