Background: More than 20% of colorectal cancers are diagnosed following an emergency presentation. We aimed to examine
pre-diagnostic primary-care consultations and related symptoms comparing patients diagnosed as emergencies with those
diagnosed through non-emergency routes.
Methods: Cohort study of colorectal cancers diagnosed in England 2005 and 2006 using cancer registration data individually linked
to primary-care data (CPRD/GPRD), allowing a detailed analysis of clinical information referring to the 5-year pre-diagnostic period.
Results: Emergency diagnosis occurred in 35% and 15% of the 1029 colon and 577 rectal cancers. ‘Background’ primary-care
consultations (2–5 years before diagnosis) were similar for either group. In the year before diagnosis, 495% of emergency and
non-emergency presenters had consulted their doctor, but emergency presenters had less frequently relevant symptoms
(colon cancer: 48% vs 71% (Po0.001); rectal cancer: 49% vs 61% (P ¼ 0.043)). ‘Alarm’ symptoms were recorded less frequently in
emergency presenters (e.g., rectal bleeding: 9 vs 24% (P ¼ 0.002)). However, about 1/5 of emergency presenters (18 and 23% for
colon and rectal cancers) had ‘alarm’ symptoms the year before diagnosis.
Conclusions: Emergency presenters have similar ‘background’ consultation history as non-emergency presenters. Their tumours
seem associated with less typical symptoms, however opportunities for earlier diagnosis might be present in a fifth of them.
According to international data, between 14 and 33% of colorectal
cancers are diagnosed as emergencies (Gunnarsson et al, 2014).
Despite some recent progress, in England a diagnosis of cancer
following an emergency presentation still occurs in as many as 22%
of colorectal cancers, with significant socio-economic inequalities
(NCIN, 2015). Emergency presenters are less often treated with
curative intent (McArdle and Hole, 2004), even after controlling
for stage at diagnosis (McPhail et al, 2013), and they have poorer
survival (Elliss-Brookes et al, 2012; Downing et al, 2013).
Moreover, emergency presentations are associated with worse
patient-reported outcomes (Quality Health, 2014) and disruptions
to hospital services (Goodyear et al, 2008). Reducing emergency

 presentations could therefore lead to more efficient and appro-
priate use of health services, and substantially improve health
outcomes.
However, studies examining potentially modifiable risk factors
and circumstances surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis are
limited (Mitchell et al, 2015a). Some studies have shown an
increased risk of emergency colorectal cancer diagnosis for women
(Abel et al, 2015), older (Mitchell et al, 2015a) and more deprived
people (Raine et al, 2010; Mayor, 2012), but the findings are not
always consistent. Few studies have examined colon and rectal
cancers separately (McArdle and Hole, 2004; Rabeneck et al, 2006;
Gunnarsson et al, 2013, 2014; Abel et al, 2015), even though these
two cancer sites often have distinct clinical presentations and the
prevalence of emergency diagnosis is markedly different (31% for
colon and 15% for rectal cancers; Abel et al, 2015). Only very
limited evidence is available on symptoms and health-care use
before emergency cancer diagnosis. According to one Swedish
study on colon cancer (Gunnarsson et al, 2014) and two UK
studies on colorectal cancers diagnosed in London (Sheringham
et al, 2014) and Exeter (Cleary et al, 2007) most patients have seen
their doctor during the 6 months before diagnosis, often with
non-specific symptoms. Case note reviews within clinical audits
(Rubin et al, 2011), qualitative studies (Black et al, 2015) and
patient surveys (Lyratzopoulos et al, 2012) have also provided
some insights into potential opportunities to diagnose cancer
earlier, but they are often limited by participation and recall bias,
due to retrospective data collection after patients received a cancer
diagnosis.
Some emergency diagnoses can be regarded as unavoidable,
such as in the case of cancers with a sudden clinical presentation
with minimal or no prior symptoms (Lyratzopoulos et al, 2014).
Other cases are potentially avoidable and these include: (a) patients
who, despite having symptoms, did not seek help promptly due to
psycho-social factors or health-care system barriers (in this case
public education and removing barriers to health care are
necessary); (b) patients who sought help for symptoms, but
opportunities were missed due to atypical symptoms, or deficien-
cies in investigations or other factors. The proportion of patients
falling into each of the above categories is unknown.
In order to provide a population-level picture of symptomatic
presentations during the months and years before the cancer
diagnosis and to identify opportunities for reducing emergency
diagnoses we used national cancer registration data individually
linked to clinical data prospectively collected in primary care
within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD—previously
GPRD). CPRD is a large database of anonymised primary-care
records from over 600 general practices. It is validated and
extensively used for epidemiological research and is considered to
be representative of the UK population (Khan et al, 2010; Dregan
et al, 2012; Tsang et al, 2013; Chu et al, 2015; Din et al, 2015).
The database is particularly suited for the present study as it
provides details on the medical history of patients, including
prospectively recorded patient-level information on each episode
of illness, symptom occurrences, all significant clinical contacts,
diagnoses and abnormal test results.
The objectives of our study were to examine patterns of
presentation in primary care with symptoms/signs potentially
related to colon and rectal cancer during the years and months
before the cancer diagnosis. In particular, we aimed to compare
patients with a cancer diagnosis following an emergency
presentation
with
patients
diagnosed
after
non-emergency
referrals, taking socio-demographic factors into account, in
order to identify opportunities for reducing emergency pre-
sentations. This will be useful for providing evidence that can
inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing
emergency cancer diagnosis, and for improving quality of care
and cancer outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sample and data sources. We have conducted a cohort
study using data from the population-based National Cancer
Registry linked to CPRD/GPRD data for patients with an incident
colon
or
rectal
cancer
(ICD10
codes
C18
and
C19–C20,
respectively). We included cancers diagnosed in England in 2005
and 2006, as this represents the latest cohort with linked CPRD
data available to us, providing information on signs and symptoms
for up to 10 years before the cancer diagnosis (Ethics approval:
ISAC-Protocol
08_031R;
NHS
Health
Research
Authority
Confidentiality
Advisory
Group
(PIAG
1–05(c)/2007)).
The
present study focused on the 5-year pre-diagnostic period, as an
initial examination of consultation patterns going back to 10 years
showed no relevant variations in consultation rates 5–10 years
before the cancer diagnosis.
Inclusion criteria were age 25 years or older, no previous
diagnosis of cancer at any site, at least 1 year of CPRD records
before cancer diagnosis. Individuals with a previous cancer
diagnosis were not included as they probably have different help-
seeking behaviour and health-care use (due to increased cancer
awareness and possibly regular follow-up visits) compared with
primary-care patients overall. Doctors might also be more prone to
consider cancer as a possible explanation for symptoms presented
by these patients. This subgroup merits to be examined separately,
but this was not possible in the present study due to small
numbers.
The CPRD includes an ‘up-to-standard’ date, indicating when
the data meet pre-defined quality criteria in over 80 variables. We
included only records meeting these criteria in order to reduce the
risk of missing or inaccurate data.
Of the 58 359 incident colon and rectal cancer patients identified
in the National Cancer Registry, 1922 patients were linked to
CPRD (3.3%). This was in line with expectations, considering that
about half of all GP practices included in CPRD (covering B7% of
the population in England) participate in the data-linkage scheme.
Non-participation in the linkage scheme is mostly due to non-
response rather than active refusal. After applying the study-
exclusion criteria a total of 1606 patients were included in the final
study sample (Figure 1). On average, each GP practice contributed
to 8 cancer patients over the total study period.
Variable definitions. Our outcome of interest was an emergency
cancer diagnosis, defined according to the ‘routes to diagnosis’
algorithm based on several routine data sets and provided by
NCIN (Elliss-Brookes et al, 2012; NCIN, 2013). In particular, an
emergency diagnosis is defined as a diagnosis of cancer following
presentation to an Accident and Emergency Unit, or following a GP
emergency referral or following emergency pathways for in/out-
patients (Elliss-Brookes et al, 2012; NCIN, 2013). Non-emergency
cancer diagnoses include routine
GP referrals, 2-week
wait
GP referrals (introduced in 2000 to allow GPs to refer suspected
cancer patients urgently, so that they can see a specialist within
2 weeks), elective inpatient/outpatient and screening. For the
purpose of our study focusing on emergency presentation, and
similarly to previous research (McPhail et al, 2013), after an initial
description of the different routes we have grouped patients into two
categories:
emergency
and
non-emergency
cancer
patients
(the latter including all the non-emergency routes).
Our main explanatory variables were signs and symptoms
recorded in primary care prior to the cancer diagnosis. On the
basis of the published literature (Sheringham et al, 2014; Din et al,
2015)
and
guidelines
(NICE
Guidelines,
2015),
we
have
operationally defined signs/symptoms potentially relevant for
colorectal cancer. Our preliminary list has been reviewed by
clinical experts and a final list has been compiled (Supplementary

 Material 1). Examples of relevant signs/symptoms are as follows:
rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits, palpable rectal mass, iron-
deficiency anaemia, abdominal pain and weight loss. Read codes
for relevant symptoms have been identified and applied to records
in CPRD (Supplementary Material 1). The Read codes included in
the final list are as comprehensive as possible, considering that
different codes can be used for similar symptoms (e.g., 16 different
codes were included for identifying patients with diarrhoea). It was
based on codes used in previous studies (Sheringham et al, 2014)
and further expanded following a detailed revision by clinical
experts, as well as an examination of the data and the Read Code
hierarchy (see Supplementary Material 2 for details on the
development of the list of signs/symptoms).
In order to account for patient characteristics we also examined
age, gender and deprivation, based on the income domain of the
Index of Multiple Deprivation for England (Department for
Communities and Local Government, 2008, The English Indices
of Deprivation, 2007 London).
Statistical analysis. We initially described the socio-demographic
characteristics, number, type and timing of symptoms before the
cancer diagnosis separately for patients with emergency and non-
emergency presentation. Colon and rectal cancers were examined
separately throughout.
We then examined predictors of emergency diagnosis in
univariable analyses, and assessed significance using w2-test
(or test for trend for ordered categorical variables). To compare
the median number of consultations for any reason 424 months
before
cancer
diagnosis
in
emergency
and
non-emergency
presenters we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Similarly,

 consultations for any reason during the year before cancer
diagnosis have been examined. As events occurring shortly before
diagnosis might be related to the diagnostic episode itself, rather
than represent opportunities for earlier diagnosis, the 30 days
before diagnosis have been examined separately throughout.
We examined the proportions of patients with at least one
relevant symptom and with each specific symptom in different
time periods before the cancer diagnosis (Figure 1) and we
compared these proportions between emergency and non-emer-
gency presenters using w2 statistics. Consultation rates with
relevant symptoms over the 5-year time period have been
calculated and divided in bi-monthly, six-monthly and yearly time
periods, in order to examine changes in consultation rates over
time. We have examined whether consultation rates with relevant
symptoms significantly varied by emergency presentation status
using Poisson regression. The models included age, sex and
deprivation, and were fitted for each time period separately,
focusing on the 6 months and the year before diagnosis, as well as
13–24 months and 25–36 months before diagnosis. Random effects
were included to account for patient-level clustering of sympto-
matic presentations.
Finally, multivariable logistic regression was used for examining
the risk of emergency diagnosis according to type and timing of
symptoms, and taking into account the number of consultation for
any reason during the year before diagnosis and socio-demo-
graphic characteristics. The final model included variables thought
a priori to be potentially important explanatory variables based on
previous evidence and clinical reasoning (i.e., socio-demographic
factors and number of consultations), and the specific symptoms
that were associated with emergency presentation at univariable
analysis. As observations within GP practices are not independent
(mean 8 observations per practice, range 1–26) robust standard
errors were calculated.
Interactions between the variables included in the final model
were examined (e.g., interaction between each symptom recorded
the year before diagnosis and the same symptom in earlier time
periods, and between symptoms and socio-demographic factors),
but power was limited due to sparse data.
STATA14 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) was
used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS
Socio-demographic characteristics and emergency cancer diagnosis.
Among the 1606 included patients 52% of colon and 58% of rectal
cancer patients were men and the median age was 74 years
(interquartile range (IQR) 65–81) and 73 years (IQR 63–80).
The demographic characteristics of our study cohort were comparable
with those of colorectal cancer patients in the 2005 and 2006 Cancer
Registry not linked to CPRD. Among the study cohort, 35% of colon
and 15% of rectal cancer patients had an emergency cancer diagnosis.
An emergency diagnosis was more frequent in women (P ¼ 0.04
for both colon and rectal cancers), and older patients, particularly
ages 80 years and above (P ¼ 0.04 for colon and P ¼ 0.003 for rectal
cancers); it was also more frequent among socio-economic
deprived patients for rectal cancers only (Po0.001; Table 1).
Consultations for any reason before the cancer diagnosis. The
great majority of the study cohort had primary-care information
for the whole of the 5-year pre-diagnostic period, with only 2% of
the cohort having primary-care records covering o2 years before
diagnosis.
GP consultation rates per year for any reason during the time
period 2–5 years before diagnosis were not significantly different
between diagnostic routes, with 88% of both colon and rectal
cancer patients having seen their GP at least once a year (Table 2);
the median number of consultations per year was 5 (IQR 2–10) for
non-emergency and emergency colon cancer patients; and 5
for both non-emergency and emergency rectal cancer patients
(IQR 2–9 and 2–12, respectively). Consultations for any reason
increased for all patients during the 13–24 months before diagnosis
and even more so during the year before diagnosis. Specifically, as
shown in Table 2, during the year before diagnosis consultations
were significantly higher for non-emergency colon cancer patients
(median 12; IQR 7–18) compared with emergency presenters
(median 10; IQR 5–19). Non-emergency rectal cancer patients had
fewer consultations during the year before diagnosis (median 9;
IQR 5–13) compared with emergency presenters (median 12; IQR
6–20). Only a small minority of patients (2.4 and 3.1% of colon and
rectal cancers, respectively) have never seen their GP during the
year before diagnosis, with minimal differences between emergency
and non-emergency presenters.
Consultations for relevant symptoms before the cancer diagnosis.
The majority of patients had at least one consultation with a relevant
symptom recorded during the year before diagnosis (80 and 84%
among colon and rectal cancers, respectively; Table 3). However, the
proportion of patients with at least one relevant symptom was
significantly lower in emergency compared with non-emergency
presenters, particularly when excluding the 30 days before diagnosis
(colon: 48 vs 71%, Po0.001; rectal cancers: 49% vs 61%, P¼ 0.043).
‘Background’ consultation rates with a potentially relevant
symptom were very low and remained stable during the 5-year
period up until B12–17 months before diagnosis (Figure 2). For
both colon and rectal cancer patients, consultation rates increased
markedly during the year before diagnosis, particularly during the
last 6 months, with no apparent differences by emergency
presentation status. Using Poisson regression and controlling for
socio-demographic variables showed that consultation rates during
the year before diagnosis were not significantly different for
emergency vs non-emergency presenters (incidence rate ratio
(IRR) for colon cancer ¼ 0.86; 95% CI 0.7–1.1; P ¼ 0.182; rectal
cancer ¼ 1.26;
95%
CI
0.9–1.8;
P ¼ 0.210).
However,
when
restricting to the last 6 months before diagnosis, emergency
presenters with colon cancer had a significantly lower consultation
rate (IRR ¼ 0.76; 95% CI 0.6–0.9; P ¼ 0.039).
Specific relevant symptoms before the cancer diagnosis. The
potentially relevant symptoms/signs most frequently recorded
during the year before diagnosis (excluding the 30 days) were
abdominal pain (25.1%), anaemia (19.2%), diarrhoea (9.9%) and
rectal bleeding (9.4%) among colon cancer patients, and rectal
bleeding (21.5%), change in bowel habits (11.6%), diarrhoea (12%)
and abdominal pain (9.4%) in rectal cancers patients (Table 3).
However, symptoms were different according to emergency
presentation status, particularly for colon cancers where ‘red-flag
symptoms’ were more prevalent among non-emergency presenters
compared with emergency presenters: anaemia (23.2 vs 11.9%;
Po0.001), rectal bleeding (12.6 vs 3.6%; Po0.001) and change in
bowel habits (6.7 vs 3.3%; P ¼ 0.022). Among rectal cancer
patients, only rectal bleeding was significantly more prevalent in
non-emergency presenters (23.7 vs 9.2%; P ¼ 0.002). Overall, 31.8%
of colon cancer and 36.4% of rectal cancer patients had at least one
of the above-mentioned ‘red-flag’ symptoms recorded between
30 days and 12 months pre-diagnosis. Non-emergency presenters
had a higher prevalence of at least one red-flag symptom compared
with emergency presenters (colon: 39.5 vs 17.5%; Po0.001; rectal
cancer: 38.8 vs 23%; P ¼ 0.005).
Among patients with at least one relevant symptom, 47% of
colon and 43% of rectal cancer patients had multiple visits with the
same symptom during the period between 30 days and 12 months
pre-diagnosis, without statistical evidence for variation in this
proportion by emergency presentation status (data not shown).

 Examining potentially relevant symptoms recorded in more
distant years (i.e., between 25–60 months pre-diagnosis) has shown
that emergency rectal cancer patients had more frequently a past
record of anaemia (8.1 vs 2.0%; P ¼ 0.002) and change in bowel
habits (2.3 vs 0.4%; P ¼ 0.050) compared with non-emergency
presenters. Among colon cancer patients, emergency presenters
had less frequently a past record of rectal bleeding (1.7 vs 3.9%;
P ¼ 0.049) than non-emergency presenters. Overall, the prevalence
of at least one red-flag symptom was much lower during the
more distant time periods compared with the year before diagnosis

 (e.g., 5.9 and 4.7% among colon and rectal cancers, respectively,
13–24 months before diagnosis) without apparent differences by
emergency presentation status.
Multivariable analysis examining the effect of symptomatic
presentations and socio-demographic factors on emergency
cancer
diagnosis. Multivariable
logistic
regression
analysis,
including socio-demographic factors and relevant symptoms into
the model, has shown that in the period from 30 days to 12 months
pre-diagnosis the risk of emergency colon cancer diagnosis was
significantly
lower
for
patients
with
a
record
of
anaemia
(OR ¼ 0.38; 95% CI 0.3–0.6), change in bowel habits (OR ¼ 0.47;
95% CI 0.3–0.9) or rectal bleeding (OR ¼ 0.22; 95% CI 0.1–0.4;
Table 4). On the other hand, emergency diagnosis was more likely
in women (OR ¼ 1.37; 95% CI 1.0–1.8) and people aged 80 years
and older (OR ¼ 1.84; 95% CI 1.2–2.7), independently of symptom
history. For rectal cancers, only rectal bleeding during the year
before diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of emergency
presentation
(OR ¼ 0.25;
95%
CI
0.1–0.6).
Socio-economic
deprivation was associated with a higher risk of emergency
presentation for rectal cancer, independently of symptoms (e.g.,
most deprived category OR ¼ 3.47; 95% CI 1.5–8.0). Increasing
number of consultations for any reason during the year before
diagnosis somewhat increased the risk of emergency presentation
for rectal cancer (OR ¼ 1.03; 95% CI 1.0–1.1). This was also
confirmed after excluding outliers, that is, patients with a very high
number of consultations (upper 5th percentile, corresponding
to 432 consultations during the year before diagnosis; data not
shown). There was some indication that change in bowel habits
(OR ¼ 12.0; 95% CI 1.6–92.1) and anaemia (OR ¼ 2.67; 95%
CI 0.8–8.9) recorded 25–60 months pre-diagnosis might increase
the risk of emergency rectal cancer but confidence intervals were
wide, reflecting the small number of individuals with such records.
DISCUSSION
Main findings. Linked cancer registration and primary-care data
allowed for a detailed description of clinical presentations in
primary care before a cancer diagnosis, comparing patients
diagnosed as an emergency
with those diagnosed through
non-emergency
routes.
The
longitudinal
data
have
shown
that consultation patterns between 12 months and up to 5 years
pre-diagnosis were very similar in emergency and non-emergency
presenters. Consultation rates increased significantly in the last
months before diagnosis independently of the diagnostic route.
Emergency presenters are not a uniform category and they can be
divided into different groups according to their consultation
history. Only a very small minority of emergency presenters have
never consulted for any reason during the year before diagnosis.
However, less than half of emergency presenters have clinical
records of relevant cancer symptoms, which is significantly lower
than among non-emergency presenters. Nevertheless, approxi-
mately a fifth of emergency presenters had typical ‘alarm’
symptoms and 16% had 3 or more consultations with relevant
symptoms, suggesting possible opportunities for earlier diagnosis.
Comparison with other studies and possible explanations for
our findings. Our findings are in line with previous studies
showing that most emergency presenters have primary-care
consultations during the months before the cancer diagnosis
(Cleary et al, 2007; Gunnarsson et al, 2014; Sheringham et al,
2014). Our results are also in agreement with a study based on
direct record reviews reporting that 60% of emergency colorectal
cancer patients had relevant symptoms 1 month or more before
diagnosis (Cleary et al, 2007).
Abdominal pain and rectal bleeding are the most frequent
symptoms among colon and rectal cancer patients, respectively,
(Hamilton et al, 2013) and similarly to previous research, we found
a lower risk of emergency presentation for patients with rectal
bleeding,
a
well-recognised
symptom
of
colorectal
cancer
(Cleary et al, 2007; Gunnarsson et al, 2014; Sheringham et al,
2014). Earlier research highlighted an increased risk of emergency
diagnosis in case of abdominal pain and constipation (Sheringham
et al, 2014), diarrhoea and weight loss (Cleary et al, 2007).
Concordantly, we found that these symptoms/signs were all associated
with emergency diagnosis, but only when focusing on the last 30 days
before diagnosis. These symptoms/signs can be an indication of
progression towards occlusion, which may explain their higher
prevalence among emergency presenters shortly before diagnosis.
Anaemia and change in bowel habits, typical red-flag symptoms
generally leading to prompt investigations, were also associated
with a lower risk of emergency colon cancer diagnosis. Anaemia
and change in bowel habits recorded 2–5 years pre-diagnosis might
increase the risk of emergency presentation, but sparse data limited
our analyses. These sign/symptoms might have been initially
dismissed as benign and subsequently neglected by patients and/or
doctors, as suggested by previous research (Mitchell et al, 2015b;
Renzi et al, 2016).
Importantly, our study has highlighted that during the year before
diagnosis one in five emergency presenters had at least one red-flag
symptom, suggesting opportunities for earlier diagnosis in these cases.
Opportunities are probably even more prevalent, considering that
symptoms are likely to be under-recorded, as suggested by the fact
that one out of three non-emergency presenters had no relevant
symptom recorded the year before diagnosis.

 On the basis of international data, missed opportunities can
occur in 1 out of 3 colorectal cancer patients, with older age,
comorbidities and belonging to ethnic minority groups increasing
the risk (Singh et al, 2009). Multiple factors are often implicated,
including
patient,
doctor
and
health-care
system
factor
(Lyratzopoulos et al, 2015).
We found that between 16 and 22% of colon and rectal
cancer patients had three or more consultations with relevant
symptoms during the year before diagnosis, which is consistent
with UK audit data (Rubin et al, 2011). Our study has
highlighted that consultation rates overall and consultations
with relevant symptoms increased substantially during the
months before diagnosis among emergency and non-emergency
presenters. In the case of rectal cancers the risk of emergency
presentation increased with increasing number of consultations
for any reason. This is in contrast with previous studies
(Sheringham et al, 2014), but differences between colon and
rectal cancers, and changes in the patterns of symptoms during
the last 30 days before diagnosis were previously not taken into
account.

Consultations before emergency colorectal cancer diagnosis
872

 Our study has shown that in some cases despite specific
symptoms, cancer was only diagnosed after emergency pre-
sentation, and this more likely occurred in some subgroups.
Women, older and more deprived individuals have been
previously shown to be at higher risk of emergency diagnosis
(Raine et al, 2010; Mayor, 2012; Abel et al, 2015; Mitchell et al,
2015a), and our data indicate that these subgroups are at higher
risk
independently
of
symptomatic
presentations.
Further
research is warranted to understand the role played by patient
factors (e.g., missed follow-up visits), health-care factors (e.g.,
delays in diagnostic work-up, previous borderline/normal test
results), as well as clinical and tumour factors complicating the
diagnosis (comorbidities, proximal cancers). For example, in-
depth quantitative and qualitative studies would be necessary
examining the role of comorbidities (Barnett et al, 2012;
Mitchell et al, 2015b), their effect on patients’ interpretation
and reporting of cancer symptoms, as well as their effect on
doctors’ decision-making regarding differential diagnosis, refer-
rals and testing.
The bowel cancer screening programme started in 2006 in
England and limited evidence is available on a possible positive
effect of screening and other early diagnosis/cancer awareness
initiatives (NICE Guidelines, 2015; Be Clear on Cancer, 2016)
on emergency presentations (Goodyear et al, 2008; Mansouri
et al, 2015). Due to socio-economic differences in screening
uptake (von Wagner et al, 2011), inequalities in emergency
presentations
and
cancer
outcomes
may,
however,
persist.
Dedicating particular attention to higher-risk groups will therefore
remain paramount.
Strengths and limitations. The strengths of the study include
the
use
of
prospectively
recorded
population-based
data
comparing emergency and non-emergency cancer diagnoses
defined according to validated methodologies (Elliss-Brookes
et al, 2012; NCIN, 2013). Thanks to the high quality of the data
sources, missing information on routes to diagnosis and socio-
demographic characteristics were negligible. Moreover, our study
cohort was comparable in terms of demographic characteristics
to colorectal cancer patients in the Cancer Registry not linked
to CPRD. Our study provided specific clinical insights for
colon and rectal cancers regarding the pre-diagnostic period.
By simultaneously evaluating the role of symptomatic presenta-
tions and patient characteristics we identified subgroups at
higher risk of missed opportunities and emergency diagnosis,
who could benefit from increased clinical and public health
efforts. The study demonstrates the usefulness of linked cancer
registration and primary-care data (such as CPRD) for early
diagnosis research.
Our study will need to be extended to more recent cohorts of
cancer patients with individually linked primary-care data. However,
although some changes occurred since the study period in guidelines,
clinical practice and patient awareness of symptoms (Moffat et al,
2015), the natural history of colorectal cancer and the disease
processes determining the occurrence of signs and symptom will not
have changed. It is also noteworthy that emergency presentations have
remained stable over recent years for rectal cancers with a slight
decrease for colon cancers (Abel et al, 2015); moreover, socio-
demographic inequalities in emergency presentations (Abel et al,
2015) and cancer survival (Ellis et al, 2012) are still relevant (NCIN,
2015). We have performed sensitivity analyses evaluating whether our
results differed for patients diagnosed in 2005 and 2006, which
showed that the overall findings were not affected by the year of
diagnosis in our sample.
Our results have to be interpreted with caution as the examined
symptomatic presentations are based on clinical records and do not
fully reflect all symptoms experienced by patients. However, this
can be assumed to apply equally to emergency and non-emergency
presenters. Moreover, clinical data were recorded prospectively by
4200 GP practices before the cancer diagnosis, and emergency

 and non-emergency patients had similar records regarding their
background consultation history.
Although routine data sources may contain inaccuracies, the
validity of diagnostic coding and consultation rates in CPRD
has been extensively confirmed (Khan et al, 2010; Dregan
et al, 2012). CPRD are electronic versions of case notes and
therefore include data reported by patients and considered
relevant by doctors. It should be noted that sometimes doctors
record clinical information only in free-text format rather than
READ codes (Price et al, 2016). We did not have access to free-
text information, which might have led to an underestimation
of symptoms. Interviews with patients/doctors could verify
the validity and improve accuracy, but this is beyond the
purpose of the present work. Similarly, we lacked data on patient
experience which can provide important insights. The possibility
of linking CPRD records to patient experience data is an area
that would merit future consideration in order to overcome
this limitation.
Implications of findings. This study has shown that emergency
presenters have similar ‘background’ consultation history as non-
emergency
presenters
and
their
consultation
rates
increase
markedly the year before diagnosis. Even though their tumours
seem associated with less typical symptoms, opportunities for
earlier diagnosis might be present in a fifth of them. In order to
reduce emergency presentations, multi-disciplinary system-wide
approaches are needed (Lyratzopoulos et al, 2015) addressing
critical points along the diagnostic process, as well as targeting
different
patient
subgroups
(Borowski
et
al,
2016).
More
specifically, our findings underscore the importance of dedicating
particular attention to patients consulting more frequently than
usual, even if their symptoms are not immediately suggestive of
cancer. In these cases, and in particular if patients belong to
categories at higher risk of emergency diagnosis, such as the
elderly, women and socio-economically deprived individuals, a
variety of approaches could be employed. Specifically, these
can include more pro-active and systematic symptom elicitation
(Birt et al, 2014; McLachlan et al, 2015) and symptom monitoring
ensuring a holistic approach (Mitchell et al, 2015b), possibly with
the support of alternative health-care providers. Considering that a
typical GP will only have around 10 min per appointment
(Independent Cancer Taskforce, 2015), a specifically trained nurse
could support the GP during the initial diagnostic phases and for
subsequent follow-up visits and safety-netting. Pre-booked follow-
up visits could be particularly useful for patients belonging to
higher-risk groups (Mitchell et al, 2015b). Moreover, closer
interaction and easier access to specialist advice for GPs would
be important, in addition to the development of multi-disciplinary
diagnostic
centres
(Independent
Cancer
Taskforce,
2015).
Clinicians and public education campaigns should not only
emphasise the importance of discussing symptoms with the doctor
when they first appear, but also encourage and support subsequent
monitoring of symptoms facilitating prompt re-evaluation if
symptoms do not improve.
Regarding the subgroup of patients presenting with relevant
symptoms, more systematic use of safety-netting, and prompt
specialist referrals and diagnostic investigations would help to seize
the opportunities for earlier diagnosis.
Reducing emergency presentations will allow more efficient and
appropriate use of health services, improve patient experience of
care and increase survival for cancer patients.
