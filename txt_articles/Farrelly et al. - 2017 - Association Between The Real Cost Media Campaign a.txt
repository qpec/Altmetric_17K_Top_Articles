In the United States, approximately 900,000 youths smoke 
their first cigarette each year (1). Health communication 
interventions are evidence-based strategies for preventing the 
initiation of tobacco use, promoting and facilitating cessation, 
and changing beliefs and attitudes about tobacco use (2,3). This 
report describes the association between the Food and Drug 
Administration’s (FDA’s) first national tobacco public educa-
tion campaign, The Real Cost, and rates of smoking initiation 
among youths in the United States from 2014 to 2016. A 
nationally representative cohort study of youths (N = 5,185) 
was conducted during November 2013–March 2016. Results 
from a discrete-time survival model indicate that, among 
youths who reported never having smoked a cigarette in the 
baseline survey, the odds of reporting smoking initiation at 
follow-up were lower among youths with frequent exposure to 
campaign advertisements than among those with little or no 
exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.70, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.55–0.91). Based on the results of the model, 
The Real Cost is associated with an estimated 348,398 U.S. 
youths aged 11–18 years who did not initiate smoking during 
February 2014–March 2016. Sustained youth-focused tobacco 
education campaigns, such as The Real Cost, can help speed 
progress toward preventing tobacco use among youths in the 
United States.
FDA’s The Real Cost was based on behavior change 
theories and designed to prevent the initiation of cigarette 
smoking among youths who have never smoked and dis-
courage further smoking among youths who have previously 
experimented with smoking (4) (RTI International and FDA, 
unpublished data, 2016). Since February 2014, the campaign 
has aired tobacco education advertising designed for youths 
aged 12–17 years on national television, radio, the Internet, 
and in out-of-home displays, as well as in magazines and movie 
theaters (4). The central theme of the campaign is “Every ciga-
rette costs you something.” In the first 3 years of advertising, 
campaign themes focused on the cosmetic effects of smoking, 
loss of control caused by addiction, and the dangerous mix 
of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke.* To monitor campaign 
awareness levels (4) and evaluate the impact of The Real Cost 
on changes in smoking-related beliefs (RTI International and 
FDA, unpublished data, 2016) and behaviors, FDA conducted 
a national representative cohort study of U.S. youths. Youths 
aged 11–16 years at baseline were randomly selected from 
within 75 U.S. media markets and, after obtaining parental 
permission and youth assent, were interviewed in person at 
baseline during November 2013–March 2014. Data collec-
tions for the three follow-up surveys were conducted during 
July–October 2014, April–July 2015, and December 2015–
March 2016 and consisted of online or in-person interviews.† 
This report used data from the baseline survey and the first 
three follow-up surveys to determine whether campaign expo-
sure was associated with preventing smoking initiation among 
youths who had never smoked at baseline (never smokers). 
The analytic sample consisted of 5,185 eligible youths, and 
the model included 11,145 observations across the surveys.§
Self-reported campaign media exposure was assessed with 
a validated measure (5) at each follow-up survey via video 
stream embedded within the survey. After viewing each 
advertisement, respondents reported their frequency of expo-
sure to the advertisement on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very 
often). Respondents viewed all advertisements airing during 
the 3 months preceding each follow-up survey (a total of four 
advertisements at first and second follow-ups, and six advertise-
ments at third follow-up). The frequency of exposure to all ads 
in each survey were summed, resulting in a score ranging from 
0 to 16 at first and second follow-ups and from 0 to 24 at third 
follow-up. A dichotomous exposure measure was then created, 
defined as either low campaign exposure (<4) or high campaign 
exposure (≥4). Smoking initiation was defined as first trial of a 
cigarette among youths who had never used cigarettes.¶

†  All youths aged 11–16 years in selected households were eligible for the baseline 
survey. Youths were selected within 75 Nielsen Designated Market Areas using 
2010 Census Bureau block groups as the secondary sampling unit. At baseline, 
the unweighted household-level response rate was 48%, and follow-up response 
rates ranged from 87% to 91% (American Association of Public Opinion 
Research Response Rate #3 formula).
§ The analytic sample included youths who reported they had never smoked 
(never smokers) at baseline and completed at least one follow-up survey (91% 
of respondents were never smokers at baseline and of these, 87% responded to 
at least one follow-up survey).
¶ “Never use” of cigarettes was examined using the measure: “Have you ever tried 
cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs?” including response options of “Yes,” 
“No,” and “Don’t Know.” Youths who had never used cigarettes were coded as 
respondents who said “No.”

A discrete-time survival model (6,7) was estimated using 
logistic regression and controlling for confounding influences, 
similar to other longitudinal media studies (8).** Because the 
delivery of advertisements is not explicitly random, the model 
included four types of potential confounders: demographic 
characteristics, individual risk factors for smoking cigarettes, 
self-reported exposure to other national campaigns (CDC’s 
Tips From Former Smokers and Truth Initiative’s truth 
campaign), and media market and state-level variables. The 
estimated number of youths prevented from initiating smok-
ing was calculated using the difference between the predicted 
risk for initiation by age with actual exposure to The Real 
Cost campaign and the predicted risk for initiation by age in 
a hypothetical scenario where self-reported exposure to the 
campaign is either absent or low nationwide. The difference 
in initiation rates was then applied to the national population 
of nonsmoking youths at each age (2010 Census), and the 
resulting estimated numbers of youths potentially prevented 
from initiating smoking at each age were summed. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to examine the influence of electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other tobacco products on smok-
ing initiation. An additional model examined the relationship 
between campaign exposure and using marijuana, a risky 
behavior unrelated to campaign messaging. This additional 
analysis was conducted to ascertain whether campaign effects 
were specific to smoking behaviors and not a general association 
between campaign exposure and risky behaviors.
High campaign exposure was associated with a 30% decrease 
in the risk for smoking initiation (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55–
0.91) (Table). The decrease in the risk for smoking initiation is 
illustrated by the difference between the risk for initiation with 
actual exposure to The Real Cost and the risk for initiation in 
a hypothetical scenario where there is no or low self-reported 
exposure to The Real Cost nationwide (Figure 1). Based on 
the results of the survival model, an estimated 348,498 youths 
aged 11–18 years were potentially prevented from initiating 
smoking nationwide during February 2014–March 2016 (95% 
CI = 331,825–365,168) (Figure 2).
The association between campaign exposure and youth 
smoking initiation remained unchanged in survival models 
that accounted for youths’ use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco 
products during the study period. In a similar survival model, 
exposure to The Real Cost was not associated with a change 
in the likelihood of marijuana initiation.
Discussion
The findings from this analysis indicate that exposure to The 
Real Cost campaign was associated with preventing an estimated 
348,398 U.S. youths aged 11–18 years from initiating smoking 
during 2014–2016. Most tobacco dependence begins during 
adolescence (3), and youth-focused campaigns to prevent smoking

estimates the risk for smoking initiation as they age. Once the event of interest 
(initiation of smoking) occurs, the youth is dropped from subsequent time 
periods, thus allowing calculation of the probability that a youth will initiate 
smoking at each age, given that the youth had not previously begun smoking.

in subsequent surveys (4). The Real Cost was also found to posi-
tively influence tobacco-related risk perceptions and beliefs spe-
cific to campaign messages after 15 months (RTI International 
and FDA, unpublished data, 2016). These results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of a national campaign that focused on the 
harmful effects of smoking and delivered salient messages that 
resonated with youths.
These findings align with previous research that found targeted 
mass media campaigns, delivered with sufficient intensity and 
duration, can decrease smoking initiation and prevalence (2,9). 
A comprehensive tobacco control approach that emphasizes 
proven strategies, such as The Real Cost, can result in reductions 
in smoking among youths today, and such reductions can lead to 
decreased future rates of smoking-attributable mortality, health 
care costs, and lost workplace productivity (3,9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, measurements were self-reported and are subject 
to bias. Specifically, selective attention could bias the results, 
such that nonsmoking youths at risk for future smoking might 
be more likely to both pay attention to campaign messages 
and experiment with smoking. However, such a positive 
association would be expected to lead to smaller observed 
campaign effects on initiation. In addition, social desirability 
bias might have led to underreporting of initiation and over-
reporting of campaign exposure. To address the concerns of 
using self-reported exposure, future research that examines 
potential campaign exposure based on measures of market-
level media delivery (i.e., target rating points††) is warranted. 
initiation, such as The Real Cost, can have long-term effects on 
future rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality (9).
Findings from this report support previous studies that indi-
cate The Real Cost meets or exceeds guidelines for effective 
health communication interventions (2). FDA conducted for-
mative research to develop campaign advertisements for The Real 
Cost, including qualitative and quantitative testing of campaign 
messages and draft advertisements (RTI International and FDA, 
unpublished data, 2016). Since its launch, campaign advertising 
has occurred with high frequency across multiple media chan-
nels targeting youths. Research indicates that approximately 9 
of 10 youths reported seeing The Real Cost advertisements after 
7 months, with more youths reporting awareness of advertising 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Public education campaigns are evidence-based strategies for 
positive public health outcomes such as preventing the 
initiation of tobacco use, promoting and facilitating cessation, 
and shaping social norms related to tobacco use.
What is added by this report?
This study is the first to examine the association between the 
Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) youth-specific national 
media campaign, The Real Cost, and adolescent smoking in the 
United States. Approximately 350,000 youths aged 11–18 years 
were prevented from smoking nationwide during 2014–2016 as 
a result of FDA’s youth-specific public education campaign.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The findings indicate that youths’ self-reported exposure to the 
campaign was associated with a reduction in smoking initiation 
from 2014 to 2016. Sustained campaigns such as The Real Cost 
can speed progress toward a tobacco-free future.

Second, although the model controls for youths’ exposure 
to other tobacco-related media campaigns, this might not 
fully account for the independent or synergistic effects of the 
other campaigns. Third, sample attrition might result in bias. 
However, attrition analyses indicate the baseline and follow-
up samples were similar across demographics, susceptibility 
to smoking cigarettes, and household tobacco use. Finally, 
because of sample size limitations, only initiation to smoking 
was examined, not progression to established or daily smoking. 
Future analyses could examine the campaign’s effect on youth 
smoking prevalence and further explore the campaign’s effect 
among demographic subgroups.
The Real Cost is the first federally funded U.S. youth-focused 
tobacco education campaign, and these findings indicate that 
youths’ self-reported exposure to the campaign was associated 
with a reduction in smoking initiation during the evaluation’s 
2014 to 2016 time frame. Sustained tobacco education cam-
paigns such as The Real Cost can encourage U.S. youths to 
abstain from tobacco use and accelerate progress toward future 
tobacco-free generations.
