Melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R)-expressing neurons modulate food intake and preference
in rodents but their role in human food preference is unknown. Here we show that compared
with lean and weight-matched controls, MC4R deficient individuals exhibited a markedly
increased preference for high fat, but a significantly reduced preference for high sucrose food.
These effects mirror those in Mc4r null rodents and provide evidence for a central molecular
circuit influencing human macronutrient preference.

 N
eural circuits involving the hypothalamus, brainstem and
mesolimbic system play a pivotal role in the regulation
of eating behaviour in response to changes in nutritional
state
and
meal
consumption1,2.
Primary
leptin-responsive
neurons
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
expressing the anorectic peptide pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)
or the orexigen agouti-related peptide (AgRP) project to the
paraventricular
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
where
they
synapse with neurons expressing the melanocortin 4 receptor
(MC4R) to regulate food intake3,4. Targeted disruption of
melanocortin signalling in Pomc, Agouti and Mc4r null mice
leads to an increase in food consumption and more specifically to
increased
preference
for
a
high
fat
diet
in
food
choice
experiments5–7.
Studies
in
Mc4r � / �
mice
and
rodents
harbouring a point mutation in Mc4r, suggest that disruption
of melanocortin signalling paradoxically reduces consumption of
high sucrose solutions and food6,8, an effect that is not seen
with the non-nutritive sweetener sucralose, and is not explained
by
conditioned
taste
aversion6.
Interestingly,
live
optical
recording of AgRP and POMC neurons in awake mice has
revealed direct activation/inhibition of these neurons by a
highly palatable diet offered in the energy-deficient state9.
While there is considerable data regarding the contribution of
central melanocortin signalling to food preference in rodent
models, the relevance of these findings to food preference in
humans has not been explored. Highly penetrant loss of
function MC4R variants in humans are rare (1–5% of people
with severe obesity), but as the phenotype of human MC4R
deficiency closely parallels that seen in mice lacking Mc4r10,
studies in genetically characterized individuals allow us to
directly test whether disruption of melanocortin signalling alters
food preference in humans. We tested whether MC4R deficient
individuals have an altered preference for foods of varying fat and
sucrose content. We found that compared with obese and
lean controls, individuals with MC4R mutations show an
increased
preference
for
high
fat
food
but
a
decreased
preference for sucrose containing food.

Fat
preference
test.
We
tested
whether
MC4R
deficient
individuals have an altered preference for foods of varying fat
and sucrose content, compared with obese and lean controls.
We developed a three choice, ad libitum meal paradigm in which
fat content was covertly manipulated to provide 20 (low),
40 (medium) and 60% (high) of the total caloric content (Table 1;
Methods), critically without altering appearance, texture or taste.
Twenty lean controls (BMI 23.1±0.3 kg m � 2), 20 obese controls
(BMI 34.1±1.1 kg m � 2) and 14 adults with heterozygous loss of
function MC4R variants (BMI 38.8±2.2 kg m � 2; Table 2)
participated; BMI did not differ significantly between the obese
and MC4R groups. Results were analysed using either ANOVA
analysis (with interaction terms for study group and study meal)
with Tukey’s HSD post-hoc comparisons for the fat preference
study. Significance was set at P ¼ 0.05.
Participants were initially provided with ‘tasters’ (15 g) of the
3 meals, and liking/disliking ratings obtained using visual
analogue scales (VAS) before and after meal consumption. Liking
ratings for the low/medium/high fat meals were similar before
and after meal consumption for all three groups (Fig. 1a,b).
Although liking scores for the high-fat meal were comparable to
those for the low and medium fat meals, MC4R deficient
individuals consumed 95% more of the high fat meal than lean,
and 65% more than obese controls (Fig. 1c,d; P ¼ 0.0222). There
was no difference in total intake collapsed across fat level
(mean±s.e.m.; g) between lean controls (488.5±43.1), obese
controls
(551.0±48.8)
and
MC4R
deficient
individuals
(561.5±60.6); P ¼ 0.53 for the group comparison.
Sucrose preference test. In the second study, we investigated
sucrose preference in a further 20 lean (BMI 22.5±0.4 kg m � 2)
and 20 obese controls (BMI 35.9±1.2 kg m � 2) and 10 adults
with heterozygous loss of function MC4R variants (Table 2,
BMI 41.3±3.2 kg m � 2). The test dessert provided 8 (low),
26 (medium) and 54% (high) sucrose; to avoid interference from
fat preference in this paradigm, the energy content from fat was
clamped at B30% (Table 3).
We found that lean and obese volunteers liked the high sucrose
meal more than the low or medium sucrose meals in keeping with
previous studies of sucrose preference in volunteers11 (Fig. 2a,b).
In MC4R deficient individuals, although liking ratings for low
and medium sucrose meals were comparable with the lean and
obese groups, liking ratings for the high sucrose meal were
significantly
reduced
(Fig.
2a,b;
P ¼ 0.0252).
Individuals
with MC4R variants also consumed significantly less of all three
sucrose
meals
compared
with
lean
and
obese
controls
(Fig. 2c,d; P ¼ 0.0064). In summary, our findings in MC4R
deficient individuals indicate that central melanocortin circuits
play a key role in modulating fat and sucrose preference in
humans.
Sensory discrimination test. It is well recognized that oral
perception can affect food preference11. To test whether there
was a perceptible sensory difference between the low (20%; A)
and high (60%; B) fat test meals, we employed a sensory
discrimination test (Triangle Test). We found that 41 out of
the 78 panellists we tested, correctly identified the odd sample in
the test. According to international standards for this test

in
a
study
with
78
panellists (a ¼ 0.001) at least 40 correct responses are required
to reject the null hypothesis (that is: that there is no difference
between the meals). Since we observed 41 correct responses, we
cannot conclude that the two meal types are the same, although
these results are suggestive. As we were not able to perform
this test in a comparable number of people with MC4R
deficiency due to the rarity of this disorder, we cannot formally
exclude the possibility that attenuated perception of fat may have
contributed to the effect that we observed. However, it is
noteworthy that on debriefing, participants did not report
differences between the foods and were unaware that we had
manipulated fat content.
Discussion
Although common genetic variants in the fatty acid translocase
CD36 have been associated with liking of high-fat foods in
African Americans12 and common obesity-associated variants
have been associated with diary reports of food choices in a
number of studies13,14, this is to our knowledge one of the first
experimental studies to show a direct association between
macronutrient preference (other than alcohol) and a specific
genetic/molecular mechanism in humans. Additional studies
using a forced choice paradigm which makes a direct comparison
between fat and sucrose will be needed to test whether disruption
of melanocortin signalling primarily alters sucrose or fat sensing
or the reward from these stimuli.
The potential neural mechanisms involved in fat and sucrose
preference have been explored in rodent studies. Fat preference
may in part be mediated by MC4R-expressing neurons in the
amygdala where injection of AgRP acutely increases15, whereas
the
agonist
Melanotan-II
decreases16,
fat
consumption
in
rats. The central nucleus of the amygdala receives and provides
projections to the parabrachial nucleus, a region which responds
to gustatory and visceral signals, is involved in sucrose preference
and is connected to excitatory MC4R-expressing hypothalamic
neurons17–19. Previous studies have shown that pre-prandial
gut hormone levels (total ghrelin, PYY and GLP-1), as well as
plasma
insulin
and
glucose
are
comparable
in
MC4R
deficiency
and
weight-matched
controls20–22.
Although
postprandial
total
ghrelin
suppression
was
attenuated
in
MC4R-deficient individuals compared with lean controls in a
previous study22, as this difference emerges 30 min after meal
initiation, it is unlikely to contribute to the effects on food
preference seen in this study.
The
additional
experimental
flexibility
afforded
by
investigating humans in this study enabled us to dissociate
consumption
from
subjective
liking.
Interestingly,
the
increased consumption of high fat food in MC4R deficient
individuals did not appear to be related to increased subjective
liking.
One
possible
explanation
is
that
the
motivating
effect of high fat content is implicit and non-conscious, consistent
with a theoretical distinction between ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’23.
However, a failure to observe an effect on rated (subjective) liking
may be an issue of power and/or reflect the choice of scaling
method used.
What is the potential physiological relevance of these findings?
In free living (nutritionally replete) humans, food preference is
complicated by the fact that sweet foods are often also high fat

 energy dense foods, thus the choice is rarely between a high
fat food and a high sucrose food. We hypothesize that the
preference for energy-dense high-fat foods in animals and
humans may represent part of the adaptive response to
nutritional deprivation. Fasting/starvation leads to a fall in leptin
levels which triggers physiological and behavioural responses to
restore energy homoeostasis24. In keeping with this hypothesis,
leptin-deficient ob/ob mice provided with single energy-source
diets self-select a higher proportion of energy from high-fat (94%)
and a lower proportion from high-carbohydrate food (3%)
(ref. 25). Critical to mediating the response to fasting/starvation is
an increase in the endogenous MC4R antagonist AgRP, which
potently stimulates food intake26, increases fat preference and
reduces carbohydrate intake when administered centrally27. Thus,
the preference for fat (which delivers twice as many calories/gram
as carbohydrates or protein and can be readily stored in adipose
tissue), at the expense of sugars/carbohydrates may represent an
advantageous behaviour
that is
expressed
in the face
of
nutritional depletion. Further studies of food preference in the
weight reduced/partially-leptin deficient state will be needed to
test this hypothesis. The detailed behavioural study of humans
with naturally occurring mutations affecting specific central
signalling
pathways
provides
a
powerful
tool
to
link
contemporary advances in the understanding of the molecular
control of energy balance to the biology underpinning food
preference in humans.
Methods
Recruitment and ethical committee approval. All studies were approved by the
Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee (03/103) and undertaken after
informed consent. Lean and obese individuals were recruited from the local
population by advertisement and MC4R deficient individuals were recruited from
our existing cohort (the Genetics of Obesity Study20). Exclusion criteria were the
use of any medication, any medical or psychiatric disease and food allergies/
intolerances.
Fat preference test. We developed a three choice, ad libitum meal paradigm
(Chicken Korma and Rice) in which fat content was covertly manipulated
(by adding rapeseed oil) to provide 20 (low), 40 (medium) and 60% (high) of the
total caloric content (Table 1), critically without altering appearance, texture or
taste. The test was conducted 4 h after a standardized breakfast which provided
20% of individual energy requirements. Participants were initially provided with
‘tasters’ (15 g) of the three meals and liking/disliking ratings obtained using VAS
before meal consumption. We then provided large dishes containing the
low/medium/high fat chicken korma curry and rice (finely chopped and mixed to
prevent selection of specific components) in excess (10 MJ; B2,390 kcal).
Participants were encouraged to try the three dishes without explicitly stating that
the three meals were different and instructed to eat until they were comfortably full.
The amount consumed was covertly weighed. After the meal, liking ratings were
measured as before.
Sucrose preference test. The test dessert consisted of Eton mess (sweet British
pudding consisting of yoghurt, cream, meringues and strawberries) to provide 8%
(low) sucrose (Table 3). We then added caster sugar (sucrose) to increase the
energy content from sucrose to 26 (medium) and 54% (high). To avoid interference
from fat preference in this paradigm, the energy content from fat was clamped at
B30% (Table 3). Participants were admitted to the Clinical Research Facility at
3:00 pm after a standardized breakfast and lunch. Participants were initially
provided with ‘tasters’ (15 g) of the three desserts and liking/disliking ratings
obtained using VAS before and after consumption. Participants were invited to try
all three desserts, provided in excess, and eat until they were comfortably full.
The amount consumed was covertly weighed.
Sensory discrimination test. To test whether there was a perceptible sensory
difference between the low (20%; A) and high (60%; B) test meals, we
employed a Triangle Test using the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standard protocol28. Seventy-eight healthy volunteers received a triad of
samples (15 g) coded with a three-digit random number. Each set had two identical
samples and one odd sample, presented simultaneously in a predetermined
counterbalanced order. Assessors were asked to record which they believed to be
the ‘odd’ sample. If the participant was unable to determine which sample was
different, they were asked to guess, since there was a possibility that they were not
consciously aware that they could taste the difference. Samples were randomly
presented to avoid positional bias since the middle sample is usually chosen as odd.
Possible combinations of samples were: AAB, ABA, BAA, BBA, BAB and ABB.
Between tasting samples, participants were asked to take a sip of water to avoid
sensory fatigue.
Statistical analysis. Results were analysed using either ANOVA analysis
(with interaction terms for study group and study meal) with Tukey’s HSD
post-hoc comparisons for the fat preference study or a linear mixed-effects model
