BACKGROUND: Differences in NICU quality of care provided to very low birth weight (<1500 g) 
infants may contribute to the persistence of racial and/or ethnic disparity. An examination 
of such disparities in a population-based sample across multiple dimensions of care and 
outcomes is lacking.
METHODS: Prospective observational analysis of 18 616 very low birth weight infants in 134 
California NICUs between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. We assessed quality of 
care via the Baby-MONITOR, a composite indicator consisting of 9 process and outcome 
measures of quality. For each NICU, we calculated a risk-adjusted composite and individual 
component quality score for each race and/or ethnicity. We standardized each score to the 
overall population to compare quality of care between and within NICUs.
RESULTS: We found clinically and statistically significant racial and/or ethnic variation in 
quality of care between NICUs as well as within NICUs. Composite quality scores ranged by 
5.26 standard units (range: −2.30 to 2.96). Adjustment of Baby-MONITOR scores by race 
and/or ethnicity had only minimal effect on comparative assessments of NICU performance. 
Among subcomponents of the Baby-MONITOR, non-Hispanic white infants scored higher 
on measures of process compared with African Americans and Hispanics. Compared with 
whites, African Americans scored higher on measures of outcome; Hispanics scored lower 
on 7 of the 9 Baby-MONITOR subcomponents.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial and/or ethnic variation in quality of care exists between and 
within NICUs. Providing feedback of disparity scores to NICUs could serve as an important 
starting point for promoting improvement and reducing disparities.

 Closing the persistent racial and/or 
ethnic gap in care and outcomes of 
newborn infants has been a longtime 
policy priority.1 Disparity in health 
care delivery has been defined as 
racial or ethnic differences in the 
quality of health care that are not 
because of access-related factors 
or clinical needs, preferences, and 
appropriateness of intervention.2 
Disparity in quality of care provided 
in the NICU setting may manifest 
in 2 ways. First, African American 
and Hispanic infants may be more 
likely to receive care in poor-quality 
NICUs.3, 
 
4 Second, in a given NICU, 
African American and Hispanic 
infants may receive inferior care. In 
previous work, we demonstrated 
NICU-level racial disparities in rates 
of antenatal steroid and human 
breast milk feeding at discharge from 
hospitals in California.5, 
 
6 However, 
a multidimensional assessment 
of differences in quality of care 
delivery does not exist. Composite 
indicators allow for multidimensional 
measurement of quality by combining 
2 or more individual measures into a 
single score.7 Their primary appeal is 
that they allow researchers to simplify 
and summarize otherwise complex 
issues and to provide global insights 
and trends about quality of care.
The goal of this population-
based study was to provide a 
multidimensional appraisal of 
racial and ethnic differences in the 
quality of NICU care delivery given 
to very low birth weight (VLBW; 
<1500 g) infants in California. For 
this purpose, we used the Baby-
MONITOR composite indicator and 
its subcomponents.8 The Baby-
MONITOR aggregates 9 risk-adjusted 
measures (2 process measures, 6 
morbidities, and mortality) that span 
the birth hospitalization.9

Overview
We performed a retrospective 
population-based analysis of clinical 
data obtained from the California 
Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative 
(CPQCC) data registry.12 More 
than 90% of California NICUs are 
members of the CPQCC, covering 
more than 95% of all very low birth 
weight (VLBW) births in the state. 
We used CPQCC clinical data to 
compute a Baby-MONITOR score for 
each NICU. We then aggregated and 
compared race- and/or ethnicity-
specific Baby-MONITOR scores 
across NICUs.
sample
This study included data recorded 
between January 1, 2010, and 
December 31, 2014. CPQCC assures 
high data quality through training 
of local personnel, range and logic 
checks, and auditing of records with 
excessive missing data. Data for 
infants transferred to other CPQCC-
member NICUs are linked. We used 
multiyear analyses because of a small 
sample in some institutions.
 
Figure 1 shows a flowchart of our 
patient sample. A detailed description 
of the patient-selection criteria has 
been published elsewhere.9 In brief, 
our goal was to create a relatively 
homogenous and unbiased sample 
of VLBW infants for comparison 
across NICUs. To ensure that patient 
outcomes reflected the care of the 
NICU under observation, we excluded 
infants who died before 12 hours of 
life and those with severe congenital 
anomalies. We also restricted the 
analysis to infants born after 24 
completed weeks of gestation to 
avoid systematic treatment bias 
at the threshold of viability.13 For 
harmonization with Vermont Oxford 
Network data, minor changes with 
inconsequential effects on NICU 
rankings have been made to variable 
definitions (SAS code available on 
request).
Patient transfers may bias NICU 
performance assessments. Therefore, 
we developed algorithms to 
minimize undue credit or penalty 
for care delivered elsewhere (details 
available on request):
1. only infants with, at most, 
3 admission records from 2 
hospitals are included;
2. if the birth hospital transfers an 
infant by 3 days of age (day 1 
is the day of birth), subsequent 
relevant outcomes (eg, chronic 
lung disease) accrue to the 
receiving hospital (counted as 
missing for birth hospital); and
3. if the birth hospital transfers 
an infant after 3 days of age, 
subsequent relevant outcomes 
accrue to the birth hospital 
(counted as missing for receiving 
hospital).
Sensitivity analyses have shown 
these assumptions to be robust to 
alternative scenarios.8,

Measures
Outcome Variable
Baby-MONITOR: Measures for the 
composite were selected via a formal 
Delphi process11 and affirmed in a 
clinical sample.10 CPQCC collects 
clinical data in a prospective fashion 
by using the standard definitions 
developed by the Vermont Oxford 
Network. The measures were 
expressed as binary variables at the 
patient level and as proportions at 
the unit level. They include: (1) any 
antenatal steroid administration; 
(2) moderate hypothermia (<36°C) 
on admission; (3) nonsurgically 
induced pneumothorax; (4) health 
care–associated bacterial or 
fungal infection; (5) chronic lung

 disease (oxygen requirement at 36 
weeks’ gestational age); (6) timely 
eye examination (retinopathy of 
prematurity screening at the age 
recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics); (7) any 
human breast milk at discharge from 
the hospital; (8) mortality during the 
birth hospitalization, and (9) growth 
velocity (less or more than the 
median of 13.1 g/kg per day). Growth 
velocity was determined according to 
a logarithmic function.15
Variable of Interest: Racial and Ethnic 
Background
This variable is reported on the 
basis of maternal race. The CPQCC 
race classification scheme (1) 
includes non-Hispanic white, African 
American, and Hispanic groups; 
(2) combines Asian and Pacific 
Islander groups and American 
Indian or Alaskan Native groups; 
and (3) includes a residual “Other” 
category. For this analysis, we 
collapsed the American Indian or 
Alaskan Native group with the Other 
category. Henceforth, we label these 
groups as white, African American, 
Hispanic, and Asian American. The 
classification scheme allows for only 
a single choice. Local data collectors 
are encouraged to retrieve this 
variable based on the Automated 
Vital Statistics System, which is used 
in all birthing hospitals in California 
to produce paper and electronic birth 
certificates. The Automated Vital 
Statistics System collects ethnicity 
and race data in a manner consistent 
with new state and federal standards 
for multiple race reporting. Assigning 
maternal ethnicity and race on the 
basis of appearance, language, or 
other personal attributes or without 
the direct assistance of the informant 
is discouraged. If multiple races 
are recorded in the Automated 
Vital Statistics System, the race that 
appears first in the hierarchy is 
recorded.
Additional Covariates: Clinical Variables
We applied CPQCC standard 
operational definitions for all 
variables, including prenatal care, 
sex, weight for gestational age 
below the 10th percentile, birth at 
a different hospital, multiple birth, 
5-minute Apgar score and cesarean 
delivery. Gestational age at birth was 
categorized into gestation groups of 
25 weeks to 27 weeks and 6 days; 
28 weeks to 29 weeks and 6 days; 
and 30 weeks or more on the basis 
of similar patient numbers among 
groups. Each Apgar score was 
categorized as <4, 4 to 6, and >6.
analyses
Baby-MONITOR Scores
Derivation of Baby-MONITOR scores 
has been described elsewhere.8 
In brief, subcomponents of the 
composite are individually risk 
adjusted. Variables are aligned 
so that a higher value represents 
a better outcome. Measures are 
standardized by using the Draper-
Gittoes method specifically developed 
for benchmarking and validity with 
small sample sizes.16 With this 
method, a standardized observed 
minus expected z score is calculated. 
Each z score is then equally weighted 
and averaged to derive a Baby-
MONITOR score for each NICU. 
Scores are expressed in standard 
units. The meaning of a 1-standard-
unit change is nonlinear across the 
distribution; for example, if a NICU 
raises its standardized score on a 
component of the Baby-MONITOR 
from 0 to +1, this NICU would move 
from the 50th percentile of the NICU 
distribution to the 84th percentile, 
whereas a move from +1 to +2 in 
standard units corresponds to going 
from the 84th percentile to the 98th 
percentile. Broadly speaking, an 
increase of 1 in standardized score is 
large in clinical terms for any NICU 
whose standardized score before the 
move was anywhere from −2 to +2.
Objective 1
The first objective was to calculate 
the variation in Baby-MONITOR  
and component scores and the  
effect of adjustment by race and/or  
ethnicity on NICU rankings. We 
computed risk-adjusted scores for 
the Baby-MONITOR and each of its 
subcomponents for each racial and/or  
ethnic group (standardized to the 
entire sample) and used analysis 
of variance to assess differences in 
quality scores. We also evaluated 
NICU performance with and without 
adjustment for race and/or  
ethnicity. Adjustment was done at 
the individual-measure level by 
following National Quality Forum 
recommendations.17 The rationale 
for this approach is that quality 
measurement must adequately 
account for the social risk; without 
such adjustment, providers who 
serve high-risk populations would be 
treated unfairly. We tested whether 
NICU ranks differed significantly with 
adjustment for race and/or ethnicity 
and evaluated the contribution 
of each race and/or ethnicity to 
rankings.
Objective 2
The second objective was to measure 
the racial and/or ethnic disparity 
at the NICU level. For each NICU, 
we calculated Baby-MONITOR 
scores for white, African American, 
Hispanic, and Asian American infants 
separately and referenced scores 
for each subgroup against white 
infants. Each group’s scores were 
standardized to the overall California 
population. With this approach, each 
NICU’s performance is stratified by 
each racial and/or ethnic subgroup. 
Stratification allows performance to 
be displayed by subgroup without 
providing a quality assessment 
benefit to a hospital for serving high-
risk populations.

 Results
sample characteristics
This study included 18 616 VLBW 
infants with 19 661 hospital records 
(5010 white, 2530 African American, 
8191 Hispanic, 2357 Asian American, 
474 Other, and 54 of unknown race 
and/or ethnicity) in 134 NICUs. Of 
these NICUs, 26 self-designated as 
Level II, 88 as Level III, and 20 as 
Level IV.18
 
Table 1 shows population and NICU 
characteristics for the combined 
VLBW sample. Hispanics represent 
the largest group of infants in 
California. Hispanic and African 
American infants are born at 
significantly lower gestational ages. 
Most infants, irrespective of race 
and/or ethnicity, access prenatal 
care. White infants, and to a lesser 
degree Asian American infants, are 
more likely to experience a multiple 
birth or a birth at advanced maternal 
age. African Americans had lower 
Apgar scores. Hispanic infants were 
most likely to require transfer after 
birth.
Regarding unadjusted components 
of quality in the Baby-MONITOR, 
compared with white infants, African 
American and Hispanic infants 
were less likely to receive antenatal 
steroid therapy, a timely retinopathy 
examination, or any human breast 
milk at discharge from the hospital. 
Both groups were also more likely 
to acquire a health care–associated 
infection. On the other hand, African 
American infants were slightly less 
likely to suffer a pneumothorax and 
achieved better growth.
Objective 1: Variation in baby-
MOnItOR and component scores 
and the effect of adjustment by Race 
and/or ethnicity on nIcu Rankings
The variation in performance 
between NICUs is notable, spanning 
5.26 (range −2.30 to 2.96) standard 
units across all NICUs. Individual 
racial and/or ethnic subgroup 
scores varied similarly: −1.93 
to 2.48 (whites), −1.04 to 1.54 
(African Americans), −1.68 to 2.16 
(Hispanics), and −0.94 to 1.66 (Asian 
Americans). Overall unadjusted 
mean (SD) Baby-MONITOR scores 
were 0.19 (0.96) standard units 
and changed little after adjustment 
(0.17 [0.95]). Figure 2 shows NICU 
performance on the Baby-MONITOR 
with and without adjustment for race 
and/or ethnicity. Scores >0 indicate 
better than expected performance, 
and scores <0 indicate worse than 
expected performance. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient between 
adjusted and unadjusted Baby-
MONITOR scores was (r = 0.995,  
P < .001).
For the overall population, mean 
Baby-MONITOR scores differed 
by racial and/or ethnic groups. 
Compared with whites (0.24 [0.6]), 
Hispanics (0.09 [0.7]; P < .023), and 
Other races and/or ethnicities  
(0.09 (0.4); P < .036) had significantly 
lower quality scores. Scores for 
African Americans (0.2 [0.5]; P = .550)  
and Asian Americans (0.28 [0.5]; 
P < .556) were not significantly 
different from those of whites. We 
also found significant variation 
among racial and/or ethnic groups 
across individual subcomponents 
of the composite. Figures 3 and 4 
show subcomponent scores by race 
and/or ethnicity. These analyses 
revealed interesting patterns. 
First, compared with white infants, 
African American infants had higher 
chronic lung disease, pneumothorax, 
and growth velocity scores and 
lower any-human-milk-at-hospital-
discharge scores. In comparison 
with Hispanic infants, white infants 
achieved equal or significantly higher 
scores across all subcomponents 
except the subcomponent measuring 
pneumothorax rates. Second, whites 
generally appeared to score higher 
on measures of process considered 
indicative of high-quality care, which 
should not differ by race and/or 
ethnicity. These included antenatal 
steroids, hypothermia on admission 
(although not significantly different), 
timely eye examination, health care–
associated infections, and any human 
breast milk at discharge from the 
hospital (we construe the latter 2 as 
markers of care process, recognizing 
that they could be understood 
as process-intense outcomes). 
Regarding outcome measures, 
African Americans tended to score 
higher than whites. Hispanics’ scores 
were similar to those of whites, 
except Hispanics scored significantly 
higher for pneumothorax rates 
yet lower for growth velocity (see 
Supplemental Table 2).
Objective 2: Racial and/or ethnic 
Disparity at the nIcu level
In Figs 5–8, we exhibit composite 
scores stratified by race and/or 
ethnicity. Overall Baby-MONITOR 
scores are recorded on the x-axis, and 
each NICU’s white, Asian American, 
African American, or Hispanic 
infants, respectively, are shown on 
the y-axis. Ideally, a NICU would fall 
in the right upper quadrant with high 
overall scores and little racial and/
or ethnic difference between scores. 
Stratification reveals intriguing 
insights into the relation between 
NICU-level disparity and quality. 
Although we found only small 
differences between racial and/or 
ethnic groups in infant-level analyses, 
wide differences exist at the NICU 
level. In Fig 5, we show a significant 
positive correlation between overall 
and race-specific Baby-MONITOR 
scores between African American 
and white infants across NICUs 
(Pearson, r [white] = 0.88, r [African 
American] = 0.70, both P = < 0.001; 
see also Supplemental Fig 9). In 
NICUs that provide poor overall 
quality of care, the disparity is small, 
or even inverted (white infants 
fare worse than African American 
infants). As quality scores rise, 
whites tend to perform better than 
African Americans. However, African 
Americans in high-performing 
NICUs often fare better than African 
Americans in low-performing

 NICUs. Figure 6 compares white 
and Hispanic infants. With some 
exceptions, white infants appear to 
fare better than Hispanic infants in 
most NICUs, irrespective of overall 
performance (r [Hispanic] = 0.89, 
P = < .001). In Fig 7, we compare 
white and Asian American infants 
and show similar results, although 
the correlation is not as strong. Even 
in low-performing NICUs, Asian 
American infants fare well and often 
better than white infants. In most 
NICUs, care for these 2 groups is quite 
similar (r [Asian American] = 0.69,  
P = < .001). In Fig 8, we show 40 
NICUs with a minimum of 10 infants 
in each of the 4 racial and/or ethnic 
groups. Asian Americans and whites 
predominate in achieving the highest 
scores across the NICUs.
DIscussIOn
The main findings from our study are 
(1) that large racial and/or ethnic 
differences in quality exist between 
and within NICUs, (2) that the 
quality deficit among disadvantaged 
populations is concentrated on 
modifiable measures of quality, 
and (3) that stratification rather 
than risk adjustment for racial and/
or ethnic background appeared 
more informative for performance 
assessments of NICUs.
Significant racial and/or ethnic 
differences in quality between and 
within NICUs are a troubling finding. 
Reasons for worse quality scores 
for disadvantaged populations 
may arise from a variety of factors,

 including biologic, social, and 
organizational considerations. 
Although it is tempting to attribute 
these results to social risk, we note 
that our sample includes NICUs 
that predominantly serve high-risk 
populations yet achieve excellent 
performance.
Although some variation is expected, 
the difference between highest- 
and lowest-performing NICUs 
was extremely large overall (5.26 
standard units). This heterogeneity 
is important because it suggests 
opportunities for improvement 
beyond preexisting social risk. Others 
have noted similar opportunities. 
Howell et al4 showed that raising the 
level of quality at minority-serving 
hospitals may eliminate up to a third 
of the disparity between African 
Americans and whites. Morales et al3  
found significantly higher risk-
adjusted neonatal mortality rates at 
minority-serving hospitals for both 
white and African American infants. 
Others showed that fewer minority 
infants were born at hospitals that 
achieved Magnet status and that 
infants at non-Magnet hospitals 
had significantly higher rates of 
morbidity and mortality.19
Another important finding of this 
article is that some of the disparity 
among disadvantaged populations 
is created by inferior performance 
among modifiable measures of 
process rather than outcome, 
suggesting a critical role for quality 
improvement efforts. Targeted,

 culturally competent care maybe 
highly effective in bridging the 
quality gap for these populations. 
This is particularly salient because 
efforts to reduce VLBW birth rates 
have mostly failed.20 In contrast, 
through quality improvement efforts, 
hospitals have demonstrated the 
ability to decrease disparities: Lee 
showed that Hispanic mothers were 
less likely than white mothers to 
receive antenatal steroids, 
4 but 
after a CPQCC collaborative project 
and efforts by individual NICUs, 
this difference disappeared.21 The 
authors of another study showed 
substantially improved breast milk 
feeding rates among VLBW infants 
in an urban NICU.22 Thus, we argue 
that the disparity in risk that infants 
of disadvantaged populations acquire 
during pregnancy should be regarded 
as a malleable risk to be addressed 
through robust individualized 
process engineering.
In measuring both performance and 
disparity, researchers can motivate 
improvement efforts by highlighting 
differences in care and outcomes 
across hospitals. In our analyses, 
adjusting measures of quality by race 
and/or ethnicity did not substantially 
boost information content. However, 
with stratification by race and/
or ethnicity, we provided NICUs 
with meaningful information about 
disparity within their own unit 
and in comparison with others. For 
example, several NICUs exhibited 
large differences in quality between 
racial and/or ethnic subgroups. And 
although, in some high-performing 
NICUs, whites had higher scores 
than African Americans or Hispanics, 
those African American and Hispanic 
infants still out-scored African 
Americans or Hispanics in lower-
performing hospitals. On the other 
hand, in several low-performing 
NICUs, African American and 
Hispanic infants had higher scores 
than white infants. The reasons for 
this finding require more study but 
may include biological vulnerability, 
unmeasured social risk, or care 
delivery in settings primarily serving 
vulnerable populations.
The results of this study must 
be viewed in light of its design. 
Although the Baby-MONITOR was 
developed in a rigorous and explicit 
fashion and has been shown to be 
robust and suitable for researchers 
to use to discern overall quality of 
care among NICUs,

 requires additional validation. 
Furthermore, in this study, we relied 
on local abstractors to follow CPQCC 
standards in retrieving maternal 
race and/or ethnicity, and although 
the CPQCC conducts extensive data 
training, misclassification cannot 
be excluded. Other limitations 
include reliance on a single choice 
of maternal race and/or ethnicity, 
which excludes multiracial and/or 
ethnic births, and nonabstraction 
of paternal race and/or ethnicity, 
which may also influence infant 
outcomes. It is possible that these 
limitations may have biased our 
results, although the direction of 
the bias is unknown. In addition, 
there are many unmeasured factors 
(social, maternal, hospital, and 
infant) that may account for our 
findings. We are working to better 
understand these factors in more 
detail through linkage of state-based 
data sources. Moreover, in our 
multiyear study, we do not account 
for time trends. It is possible that 
with general improvements in 
patient care (51 of CPQCC NICUs 
participated in a collaborative to 
improve delivery room care), 
25  
disparities across the overall 
composite or subcomponents may 
have decreased. Finally, although 
we only examine NICUs from 1 state 
in this study, our study reflects 
population-based results across the 
nation’s most populous state, which 
has broad racial and/or ethnic and 
geographic diversity.
cOnclusIOns
Wide racial and/or ethnic differences 
in quality of care delivery do 
exist between and within NICUs. 
Stratification, rather than risk 
adjustment for race and/or  
ethnicity appeared to reveal 
more informational content for 
performance assessment.
