IMPORTANCE Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in preventing recurrent
Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). However, it is not known whether clinical efficacy differs
by route of delivery.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether FMT by oral capsule is noninferior to colonoscopy delivery
in efficacy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Noninferiority, unblinded, randomized trial conducted
in 3 academic centers in Alberta, Canada. A total of 116 adult patients with RCDI were
enrolled between October 2014 and September 2016, with follow-up to December 2016.
The noninferiority margin was 15%.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to FMT by capsule or by colonoscopy
at a 1:1 ratio.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients
without RCDI 12 weeks after FMT. Secondary outcomes included (1) serious and minor
adverse events, (2) changes in quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form Survey on a scale
of 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life), and (3) patient perception on
a scale of 1 (not at all unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant) and satisfaction on a scale
of 1 (best) to 10 (worst).
RESULTS Among 116 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 58 [19] years; 79 women [68%]),
105 (91%) completed the trial, with 57 patients randomized to the capsule group and 59 to
the colonoscopy group. In per-protocol analysis, prevention of RCDI after a single treatment
was achieved in 96.2% in both the capsule group (51/53) and the colonoscopy group (50/52)
(difference, 0%; 1-sided 95% CI, −6.1% to infinity; P < .001), meeting the criterion for
noninferiority. One patient in each group died of underlying cardiopulmonary illness
unrelated to FMT. Rates of minor adverse events were 5.4% for the capsule group vs 12.5%
for the colonoscopy group. There was no significant between-group difference in
improvement in quality of life. A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving
capsules rated their experience as “not at all unpleasant”(66% vs 44%; difference, 22%
[95% CI, 3%-40%]; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not
inferior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent infection over 12 weeks.
Treatment with oral capsules may be an effective approach to treating RCDI.

lostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the main cause of
health care–associated infectious diarrhea. In a meta-
analysisofprimarystudiespublishedin2002and2007,
the annual cost of CDI in the United States adjusted to 2012
dollars was estimated at $1.5 billion.1 Following a course of an-
tibiotic therapy for CDI, 10% to 30% of patients will experi-
encearecurrence,withtheriskapproaching60%afterthethird
episode. Managing recurrent CDI (RCDI) remains a major chal-
lenge. Fidaxomicin can reduce the risk of recurrence; how-
ever, studies to date only included patients with primary or
first recurrent infections.2 Bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal anti-
body against C difficile toxin B, is efficacious at reducing RCDI
compared with placebo.3 However, the absolute risk reduc-
tion is modest, with the number needed to treat to prevent a
recurrence being 10.
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the most effec-
tive therapy for RCDI, with reported efficacy between 60% and
90% after a single treatment.4-8 Furthermore, frozen-and-
thawed FMT is noninferior to fresh FMT in treating RCDI.9
FMT can be delivered by various modalities, with higher
likelihood of preventing RCDI when administered by colonos-
copy (90%) compared with the upper gastrointestinal route
(80%) based on uncontrolled studies.10-13 To compare clini-
cal efficacy, this randomized trial was designed to test the hy-
pothesis that given the same amount of donor stool, FMT by
oral capsule is noninferior to delivery by colonoscopy.

Study Design and Treatment
This randomized, noninferiority trial compared FMT delivered
bycapsulewithcolonoscopy.Potentialparticipantswereenrolled
between October 2014 and September 2016, with follow-up to
December2016at3academiccentersinEdmontonandCalgary,
Alberta, Canada. Eligible patients were randomized to FMT by
capsuleorcolonoscopyata1:1ratiobycomputer-generatedran-
dom numbers in blocks of 4, stratified by age (≥65 vs <65 years)
and immunosuppression. This study was not blinded owing to
the practical barriers to masking. A data and safety monitoring
board monitored the trial to completion.
Following 10 or more days of vancomycin at 125 mg by
mouth 4 times a day until symptom resolution, patients were
treated with vancomycin, 125 mg, by mouth twice a day until
24 hours prior to FMT. No proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was
given prior to FMT; patients taking a PPI discontinued it after
screening. All patients received 4 L of GoLYTELY (polyethyl-
ene glycol) the night before FMT and remained fasting until
the scheduled treatment. Patients randomized to the colonos-
copygroupreceived360mLoffecalslurryinthececum.Those
randomized to the capsule group swallowed 40 capsules un-
der direct observation. All patients had clinic visits at weeks
1, 4, and 12 after FMT, with a telephone follow-up at week 2.
In the event of diarrhea recurrence, C difficile testing was re-
peated. If test results were positive, patients were treated with
vancomycin prior to the second FMT by the same delivery mo-
dality, with identical follow-up.
Serial stool samples were collected and frozen at −80°C
prior to FMT and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after FMT. A subset of
23 capsule and 23 colonoscopy recipients was randomly cho-
sen to proportionally represent the study cohort for micro-
biome profiles. Stool microbial DNA was extracted using the
FastDNA Spin kit for Feces (MP Biomedicals) for whole-
genome shotgun sequencing. Metagenome libraries were con-
structed using the Nextera XT (Illumina) protocol. Libraries
were sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq using a paired-end
300-cycleprotocol.Taxonomicclassificationofsequenceswas
conducted with Kraken against a customized database that in-
cluded full-genome sequences of bacteria, archaea, viruses,
fungi, protozoa, and the human genome assembly GRCh38.15
Re-estimation of bacterial abundance was carried out with
Bracken (eMethods 1 in Supplement 2).

Key Points
Question Does the clinical efficacy of fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection (RCDI) depend on the route of delivery?
Findings In this noninferiority randomized clinical trial that
included 116 adults with RCDI, the proportion without recurrence
over 12 weeks was 96.2% after a single treatment in a group
treated with oral capsules and in a group treated via colonoscopy,
meeting the noninferiority margin of 15%.
Meaning FMT by oral capsules may be an effective approach
to treating RCDI.

Stool Donor and FMT Manufacturing
Sevenhealthyvolunteerstooldonorsprovidedstoolforallpar-
ticipants. Donor inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening, and
testing followed recommendations proposed by Kelly and
colleagues.16 Each fresh stool donation, weighing 80 g to 100
g, was received by laboratories within 12 hours of collection.
Each collection was processed separately without pooling, by
mixing in 200 cc of 0.9% normal saline and filtered using a
stomacher bag to produce 180 cc of fecal slurry. The slurry was
mixed with 20 cc of 100% glycerol and kept frozen at −70°C
for up to 2 months. When required, the frozen slurry was
thawed at 4°C overnight and reconstituted with 160 cc of 0.9%
normal saline. For capsule manufacturing, the fecal slurry
(approximately 200 cc) was mixed with 40 cc of 100% glyc-
erol and centrifuged (Sorvall Legend RT+; Thermo Scientific)
at room temperature at 400g for 20 minutes.
After decanting the supernatant, it was centrifuged at
10 000g for 30 minutes at 4°C to 8°C using a high-speed cen-
trifuge (Avanti J-30 I; Beckman Coulter). The supernatant
was discarded and the final sediment (approximately 12 cc,
estimated to contain 1013 microbes) was mixed to incorporate
residual liquid to allow pipetting into capsules. Using either a
microtiter template or by individual handheld half capsules,
No. 1 gelatin capsules (1889-02; Medisca) were filled, then over
encapsulated twice with No. 0 (2009-02; Medisca) and No. 00
(1109-02; Medisca) capsules, flash frozen at −55°C on dry ice
and stored at −70°C for up to 2 months. Forty capsules were
manufactured from 1 donation.
Study End Points
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients without
RCDI 12 weeks after FMT in each group. Secondary outcomes
included (1) serious adverse events (infections and mortality
related to FMT, colonic perforation) and minor adverse events
(nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fevers), (2) changes
in quality of life assessed by SF-36 on a scale of 0 (worst pos-
sible quality of life) to 100 (best possible quality of life),
(3) patient perception on a scale of 1 (not at all unpleasant) to
10 (extremely unpleasant) and satisfaction on a scale of 1
(best) to 10 (worst) in each group. Cost of intervention, micro-
bial composition changes, and IBD flares after FMT were ex-
ploratory outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
To determine noninferiority of FMT administered by capsule
compared with by colonoscopy, a sample size of 49 in each
group was required to achieve 80% power to detect a nonin-
feriority margin of −15% in success rates between the 2 groups
at 5% significance level, assuming a 90% success rate for the
colonoscopy group, as reported in the literature,10 and no dif-
ference in success rates between the capsule and colonos-
copy groups. Data comparing upper gastrointestinal vs colo-
noscopyadministrationofFMTwerelimited.Forexample,one
study reported a success rate of 74% (28/38) following 1 FMT
administrationbyduodenalinstillation17comparedwitha92%
success rate with 1 FMT delivered by colonoscopy by Kelly and
colleagues.10 The proposed −15% noninferiority margin was
chosen based on investigators’judgment that FMT adminis-
tration by capsule was noninvasive and relatively inexpen-
sive compared with colonoscopy, an invasive and costly pro-
cedure. Assuming a 15% attrition rate, a sample size of 58
patients in each group was needed.
The per-protocol population consisted of all patients who
strictly adhered to the study protocol and had completed the
planned 12-week follow-up. The primary outcome was ana-
lyzed using the per-protocol approach based on the 2-sample
binomial noninferiority test at the 5% significance level.
The noninferiority was established when the 1-sided 95% CI
for the difference in 12-week success rate was −15% or greater.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the noninferi-
orityofthecapsulesconsideringtheworst-casescenario,where
all patients excluded from the primary analysis were as-
sumedtohaveCDIrecurrenceiftheywereinthecapsulegroup
and no recurrence if they were in the colonoscopy group.
For secondary outcome comparisons, between-group differ-
ences and 95% CIs were reported, along with 2-sided P values
from the Wilcoxon rank sum test for changes in SF-36 scores
between screening and week 4 and Fisher exact test for pa-
tient satisfaction using a 2-sided significance level of 5%.
Because secondary end points were not adjusted for multiple
comparisons, these findings should be considered explor-
atory. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute).
Cost estimation of colonoscopy was based on an aggre-
gate value previously reported, which accounted for all di-
rectcosts.18ThecostsofFMTmanufacturinganddeliverywere
based on aggregate costs during the conduct of this study.
Microbial composition analyses and principal coordinates
analysis (PCoA) were conducted with EMPeror.19 Shannon di-
versity indices, the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, PCoA, and the
permutational multivariate analysis of variance were con-
ducted with the Scikit-bio 0.5.1.
Results
Patients
Of 213 patients assessed for eligibility, 97 patients were ex-
cluded. The remaining 116 underwent randomization (mean
[SD] age, 58 [19] years; 79 women [68%]; 105 [91%] com-
pleted the trial): 57 in the capsule group and 59 in the colo-
noscopy group (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were not sig-
nificantly different between the groups (Table 1). Seventeen
patients, 10 randomized to the colonoscopy and 7 to the cap-
sule group, were immunosuppressed (eTable 1 in Supplement
2). In the end, 53 in the capsule group and 52 in the colonos-
copy group were included in the per-protocol analysis for pri-
mary outcome; numbers of patients included for secondary
analyses varied by outcomes (Figure 1).

 both in the capsule group (51/53) and the colonoscopy group
(50/52) after a single treatment as per-protocol analysis, with
a rate difference of 0% (1-sided 95% CI, −6.1% to infinity;
P < .001), resulting in rejection of the null hypothesis that FMT
by capsule was less effective than FMT by colonoscopy by at
least −15%. Sensitivity analysis assuming the worst-case
scenario had a similar finding. With a success rate of 89.5%
(51/57) for the capsule group and 96.6% (57/59) for the colo-
noscopygroup,theratedifferencewas−7.1%witha1-sided95%
CI of −14.9% to infinity (P = .048), demonstrating the nonin-
feriority of the capsule group. Site differences in efficacy are
presented in eTable 3 in Supplement 2. Two patients in each
group developed RCDI and were successfully treated with
a second FMT by the same modality.
Secondary End Points
Changes in Quality of Life
Quality of life before FMT and 4 weeks after FMT were not
assessed for 13 patients: 4 did not receive the assigned treat-
ment, 2 withdrew before 4 weeks, 1 died, and 6 did not com-
plete the SF-36 questionnaire at 4 weeks. Among the remain-
ing 103 patients, the domains of role limiting due to physical
and emotional health problems scored lowest among all do-
mains, both with a median of 0 before FMT. Four weeks
after FMT, the domains of role physical and role emotional had
improved significantly, with an increase of 25 and 33 in the me-
dian scores, respectively. Other domains also had signifi-
cantly higher scores at 4 weeks compared with baseline. How-
ever, these changes were not significantly different between
the 2 groups (Table 2).
Patient Perception and Satisfaction
Post-FMT perception was not assessed in 6 patients, all of
whom either did not receive the assigned treatment or with-
drew early. Participants most frequently characterized FMT as
“innovative treatment” (63% of patients), “natural remedy”
(41%), and “unpleasant, gross, or disgusting” (30%). Factors
reported most frequently to influence preference for FMT

 delivery method were effectiveness (91%), safety (62%), phy-
sician’
s recommendation (45%), aesthetics (29%), and cost to
health care system (18%). A total of 79% of participants re-
ported the unpleasantness experienced to be the same or less
than anticipated and 97% indicated they would undergo the
assigned delivery method again if needed. A significantly
greaterproportionofparticipantsreceivingcapsulesratedtheir
experience as “not at all unpleasant” (66% vs 44%; differ-
ence, 22% [95% CI, 3%-40%]; P = .01).
Adverse Events
Adverse events were assessed for all but 4 patients (n = 112)
who did not receive the assigned treatment. One patient in
each group died of underlying cardiopulmonary illness,
unrelated to FMT, within 12 weeks of FMT. A woman in her
mid-70s with underlying lupus taking low-dose prednisone,
complete heart block requiring pacemaker, and congestive
heart failure received FMT by colonoscopy after the fourth
episode of CDI. She developed confusion between the time of
screening and FMT, a new development not communicated
to the study team. Although the colonoscopy was unevent-
ful, the patient died of congestive heart failure 3 days later. A
woman in her early 80s who had chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrilla-
tion received FMT by capsule after the fifth episode of CDI.
She did well after FMT but developed pneumonia and
Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia 10 weeks after FMT
and died of sepsis 1 week later. No infectious complication
related to FMT was seen in any of the study participants. No
colonic perforation occurred. Minor adverse events occurred
in 5.4% of the capsule group and 12.5% in the colonoscopy
group (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory End Points
Cost of Intervention
The cost of administering FMT via colonoscopy was CAD $1120
(US $874) per patient. In comparison, the cost of administer-
ing FMT by capsule was CAD $395 (US $308) per patient
(eResults 1 in Supplement 2).
Exacerbation of Underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Duringfollow-up,2patientswithIBDinthecolonoscopygroup
developed exacerbation of their underlying disease, requiring
adjustmentintreatmentregimens(eResults2inSupplement2).
Microbial Composition Analysis
Prior to FMT, patients with RCDI had decreased diversity as
measured by the Shannon diversity index compared with do-
nors (Figure 2). Following FMT, diversity increased signifi-
cantly in both the capsule and colonoscopy groups to values
not significantly different from donors. This increased diver-
sity was maintained in both groups up to 12 weeks following
the FMT. PCoA of the patients with RCDI showed a signifi-
cantly different microbial community structure before and af-
ter FMT (permutational multivariate analysis of variance
P = .001) (Figure 3). Patients with RCDI clustered apart from
donors prior to FMT and moved toward the donor profiles and
persisted to week 12 after FMT. Taxonomic composition of the
patient and donor microbiota is shown in the eFigure in
Supplement 2.
Discussion
Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not infe-
rior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent in-
fection over 12 weeks.
The success rate with FMT capsules in this study was
higher compared with other studies. Most studies admin-
istering FMT by the upper route provided a relatively small
fecal inoculum derived from a mean of 25 g of donor stool to
the stomach compared with a mean of 93 g delivered by
colonoscopy.20 Following a 48-hour vancomycin washout pe-
riod and without bowel lavage, Youngster and colleagues8
reported a response rate of 70% when 15 capsules were ad-
ministered per day for 2 consecutive days. A randomized clini-
cal trial comparing frozen-and-thawed or fresh FMT by en-
ema, derived from 17 g of donor stool, showed efficacy at
approximately 60% following a single treatment in both

 groups.9 A small randomized clinical trial showed that FMT
by colonoscopy vs vancomycin prevented recurrent infec-
tion in 90% of patients using a mean of 152 g of donor stool.21
The higher efficacy observed in this study suggests a dose-
dependent response to FMT, and a benefit of bowel lavage
prior to FMT, because residual vancomycin was detected up
to 8 days despite its discontinuation.22
Currently, most patients with RCDI are referred to gastro-
enterology or infectious diseases, and the method and route
in which FMT is administered are specialty dependent.

PCoA is a method to visualize similarities or dissimilarities in high-dimensional
data. In this case, it assigns each patient’
s microbial composition to a location in
a 2-dimensional graph indicated by principal coordinate 1 (30.9%; x-axis) and
principal coordinate 2 (8.4%; y-axis) where the distance between any 2
samples is a measure of their similarity (smaller distance for higher similarity).
The microbial composition of patients with recurrent C difficile infection
(red circles and triangles) was significantly different from donors (black
squares) before fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) but shifted toward the
donor profiles 1 week after FMT (permutational multivariate analysis of variance
P = .001). At 12 weeks, a few individuals appeared to revert back toward
pre-FMT profiles (gold circles and triangles).

The Shannon diversity index represents the relative abundance and evenness of
bacterial species in a community. The index is highest in communities with large
numbers of species with near equal representation, and lowest in communities
with low numbers of species with skewered distribution. Shannon diversity
index was significantly different between patients with recurrent C difficile
infection in the capsule or colonoscopy groups and the donors before fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) (P < .001) and between each group of
patients before and after FMT at 1, 4, and 12 weeks (P < .01). There was
no difference between the capsule and colonoscopy groups at any point.
Some donors had provided 2 samples for the microbial composition analysis.

 Although colonoscopy delivery is more invasive, resource in-
tensive, costly, and inconvenient for patients, it has the ad-
vantage of identifying alternative diagnoses. Conversely,
when FMT is given by oral capsules, it can be adminis-
tered in an office setting, which could substantially reduce
cost and wait time. Complete economic evaluations are
needed to understand the value and efficiency of FMT by
oral capsule.
In this study, 15% (2/13) experienced an IBD flare follow-
ing FMT delivered by colonoscopy. Although this associa-
tion has been previously reported at 13% (9/67)23 and 25%
(11/43),24 it remains unknown whether IBD exacerbation in
this setting is caused by FMT, RCDI, or natural progression
of IBD.
The theoretical need to prevent gastric acid from de-
stroying the transferred microbes during FMT has led to the
practice of using PPIs and/or acid-resistant capsules.8,25,26
However, in this study, PPIs or histamine antagonists were
not used prior to FMT. If a patient was taking a PPI at the
screening visit, PPI was discontinued because it is a known
risk factor for CDI. Furthermore, the gelatin capsules used
were not acid resistant. To counteract the lack of acid sup-
pression, the microbial inoculum used in this study may
have been sufficient to overcome the potential microbial loss
in the stomach. Observing similar microbial composition in
colonoscopy- and capsule-administered FMT supports the po-
sition that microbes alone can restore integrity to the intesti-
nal ecosystem.
Strengths
This study has several strengths. First, only patients with
a propensity for RCDI within a short period of treat-
ment completion were included in this study (median of
4 CDI episodes over a 4-month period and median anti-CDI
treatment duration of 2.4 months). Second, patient-
reported outcomes were captured by SF-36 and satisfaction/
preference questionnaires before and after FMT. Third, IBD
and immunosuppressed patients were included, although
the numbers were too small to determine the safety profile.
Fourth, using a small number of stool donors minimized the
risk of potential disease transmission, screening costs, and
wait time.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, by not including a
placebo group in this study, it was not possible to measure
the magnitude of effect of FMT administered by each route.
In a recent FMT vs placebo trial in the treatment of RCDI, the
placebo response rate was 45%.27 In this study, patients knew
that they received FMT regardless of randomization and this
knowledge may have inflated the response rate. At the same
time, the placebo effect would have existed in both groups.
Assuming similar placebo effect, the result of this study still
provides a valid comparison of the efficacy between the 2
treatment modalities. Second, there was no blinding.
Although technically possible, blinding would have required
patients randomized to the capsule group to undergo an
invasive and expensive procedure. Furthermore, blinding
would not have allowed for assessing a potential difference in
patient preference or adverse events based on method of
FMT delivery. Third, the generalizability of these findings
was limited by the enrollment criteria as patients with severe
and complicated CDI were excluded. Fourth, the cost com-
parison did not include donor screening, cost from a societal
perspective, or FMT program infrastructure or liability. Addi-
tionally, the cost of colonoscopy is lower in Canada than in
the United States. Therefore, the cost difference between
FMT by capsule compared with colonoscopy may be larger in
the United States. Fifth, strain typing was not performed in
this study cohort, although the NAP1/ribotype 027 strain is
estimated to be 20% in Calgary and 30% in Edmonton based
on recent provincial surveillance data.
Conclusions
Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not infe-
rior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent in-
fection over 12 weeks. Treatment with oral capsules may be
an effective approach to treating RCDI.
