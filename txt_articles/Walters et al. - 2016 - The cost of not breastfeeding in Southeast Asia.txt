Abstract
Rates of exclusive breastfeeding are slowly increasing, but remain suboptimal globally despite the
health and economic benefits. This study estimates the costs of not breastfeeding across seven
countries in Southeast Asia and presents a cost-benefit analysis of a modeled comprehensive
breastfeeding strategy in Viet Nam, based on a large programme. There have been very few such
studies previously for low- and middle-income countries. The estimates used published data on
disease prevalence and breastfeeding patterns for the seven countries, supplemented by informa-
tion on healthcare costs from representative institutions. Modelling of costs of not breastfeeding
used estimated effects obtained from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Modelling of cost-
benefit for Viet Nam used programme data on costs combined with effects from a large-scale cluster
randomized breastfeeding promotion intervention with controls. This study found that over 12 400
preventable child and maternal deaths per year in the seven countries could be attributed to in-
adequate breastfeeding. The economic benefits associated with potential improvements in cogni-
tion alone, through higher IQ and earnings, total $1.6 billion annually. The loss exceeds 0.5% of
Gross National Income in the country with the lowest exclusive breastfeeding rate (Thailand). The
potential savings in health care treatment costs ($0.3 billion annually) from reducing the incidence
of diarrhoea and pneumonia could help offset the cost of breastfeeding promotion. Based on the
data available and authors’ assumptions, investing in a national breastfeeding promotion strategy
in Viet Nam could result in preventing 200 child deaths per year and generate monetary benefits of
US$2.39 for every US$1, or a 139% return on investment. These encouraging results suggest that
there are feasible and affordable opportunities to accelerate progress towards achieving the Global
Nutrition Target for exclusive breastfeeding by 2025.

 Introduction
Despite the crucial benefits that breastfeeding provides, we have
failed to create an environment whereby optimal breastfeeding is the
social norm, and thus rates remain well below coverage targets set by
the World Health Organization (Editorial 2014). Optimal breast-
feeding for children includes early initiation of breastfeeding within 1
h of birth, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months, and continued
breastfeeding to 2 years and beyond, accompanied with nutritionally
adequate and safe complementary foods (UNICEF 2011). Moreover,
breastfeeding is a child’s right. The United Nations Convention on
Rights of the Child states that governments have the responsibility
‘to ensure that all segments of society, in particular parents and chil-
dren, are informed, have access to education and are supported in the
use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition, the advantages
of breastfeeding, hygiene and environmental sanitation and the pre-
vention of accidents’ (United Nations 1989).
Between 1995 and 2010, the proportion of infants 0–5 months
exclusively breastfed across low- and middle-income countries rose
slightly from 33 to 39% overall. The greatest gains were achieved in
Africa, while rates in Asia only rose by three percentage points to
41%. The gradual increase is positive, but the differences among
countries, and within countries, are substantial. East Asia and the
Pacific (excluding China) was the only UNICEF region that experi-
enced a decline over the 15-year period—the exclusive breastfeeding
rate decreased from 31 to 29% (Cai et al. 2012).
Breastfeeding rates, however, tend to decline as national income
rises, although some countries have succeeded in reversing that trend
(Victora et al. 2016). Breastfeeding to 6 months (even if not exclu-
sive) confers important cognitive benefits. The cognitive losses asso-
ciated with not being breastfed to 6 months are estimated globally
as 0.49% of world Gross National Income (Rollins et al. 2016)
National policy can make a difference: breastfeeding rates increased
by 1% per year, or twice as fast as the global average, in countries
with pro-breastfeeding social policies (Rollins et al. 2016).
In addition to a set of interventions to protect, promote, and sup-
port breastfeeding, the WHO and UNICEF global strategy for infant
and young child feeding (IYCF) includes pro-breastfeeding policy
initiatives that have gained traction globally in recent decades
(WHO and UNICEF 2003). First, the International Code of
Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (BMS) adopted in 1981 aims
to protect against the consequences of unethical promotion of BMS
by the baby food industry (UNICEF and WHO 1981). The Code
and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions
prohibit the advertisement or promotion of these products to the
general public or through the health care system. By 2015, only 43
of 192 countries have national regulations covering all of the provi-
sions of the international Code, while a further 48 have national
measures covering most of the provisions of the Code (UNICEF
2015). Code implementation is recommended by the Committee on
the Rights of the Child and is part of nutrition relevant legislation
under the Scaling Up Nutrition movement.
Second,
the
International
Labour Office (ILO) Protection
Convention 2000 number 183 entitles women to a minimum of 14
weeks of paid maternity leave, and recommends extending the paid
leave to a minimum of 18 weeks (International Labour Office
2014). Maternity leave policies are widespread globally with only a
few exceptions, but the level of entitlements, length of leave, and
spousal benefit entitlement, and source of pay (social security or em-
ployer) vary by country. Employed mothers are entitled to one or
two paid breastfeeding breaks per working day, although actual
practice differs. Notably, maternity and parental leave policies do
not cover women working in the informal sector or in family busi-
nesses, or those who are self-employed. Third, the Baby-friendly
Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was launched by UNICEF and WHO in
1991 to encourage health facilities to institutionalize the WHO Ten
Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (WHO and UNICEF 2009). Over
20 000 hospitals in 156 countries were certified as baby-friendly at
some point since inception, although it is likely many no longer
meet the criteria. Many countries are currently incorporating the
WHO Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding requirements into their
regular hospital standards and accreditation process, rather than a
separate process in an effort to reduce cost and increase breastfeed-
ing coverage. These policy actions can be complemented by breast-
feeding counselling and support for individual mothers, and by
social marketing campaigns that promote breastfeeding behaviours
and help shift social norms.
Previous studies (Bertran et al. 2001; Bartick and Reinhold
2010; Bartick et al. 2013; Pokhrel et al. 2014) have shown that inad-
equate breastfeeding is associated with significant human and eco-
nomic costs. We use the term inadequate here to describe limited
breastfeeding according to various indicators, some of which corres-
pond to less than ‘optimal’ breastfeeding as defined by WHO and
UNICEF (UNICEF 2013). In the USA, it was estimated that 911
child lives and $13 billion could be saved if 90% of mothers could
breastfeed exclusively for 6 months instead of the current rate of
12.3% (Bartick and Reinhold 2010). Breastfeeding for <2 years
over a woman’s lifetime is estimated to result in 4981 maternal
breast cancer deaths and US$17.4 billion in annual costs related to
Key Messages
•
Inadequate breastfeeding results in substantial human loss and monetary costs for families and governments in
Southeast Asia.
•
Every year, over 12 400 child and maternal deaths can be attributed to inadequate breastfeeding in the seven Southeast
Asian countries. Breastfeeding can prevent 50% of child deaths due to diarrhoea and pneumonia and 10% of deaths due
to breast cancer.
•
Savings in health care treatment costs from reductions in pneumonia and diarrhoea from increased breastfeeding could
help offset the additional cost of breastfeeding promotion.
•
The potential improvements in cognition alone, through higher IQ and earnings, could amount to as much as 0.5% of
Gross National Income globally.
•
Based on findings from a programme implemented in 15 of 63 provinces and municipalities, a modeled breastfeeding
promotion strategy at national scale in Viet Nam could yield a benefit-cost ratio of $2.39:1 or a return on investment of
139%.

 premature death (Bartick et al. 2013). Betran et al. (2001) estimated
that exclusive breastfeeding to 3 months could prevent 52 000
deaths in Latin America. In the UK, Pohkrel et al. found that:
Supporting mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding at 1 week
to continue breast feeding until 4 months can be expected to re-
duce the incidence of three childhood infectious diseases and save
at least £11 million annually, and doubling the proportion of
mothers currently breastfeeding for 7–18 months in their lifetime
is likely to reduce the incidence of maternal breast cancer and
save at least £31 million annually. (Pokhrel et al. 2014)
There were no estimates of the cost of not breastfeeding in
Southeast Asia published. Given the expected large economic costs
associated with inadequate breastfeeding however, a cost-benefit
analysis is an appropriate method to use to analyse the priority of
breastfeeding promotion among health and other government prior-
ities. A cost-benefit approach values the benefits of a health pro-
gramme in terms of monetary units (e.g. health cost savings,
economic productivity benefits) in order to facilitate direct compari-
son with costs (Drummond et al. 2005). Cost-effectiveness analysis,
on the other hand, is appropriate when the primary outcomes are
expressed in health terms (e.g. reduced mortality, reduced time lived
with disability or impaired health). The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is
used to measure the economic returns from each dollar invested in
the intervention (Drummond et al. 2005). No evaluations were
found on cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses of breastfeeding
promotion interventions for a low- or middle-income country since
2000 in the peer-reviewed literature in English (although Rajkumar
et al. 2012 provide a cost-benefit analysis of breastfeeding promo-
tion in Ethiopia, in a World Bank publication). Only one other
country study was located since 1990 (Horton et al. 1996).
Our study, therefore, aims to fill a gap in the literature by esti-
mating the cost of suboptimal breastfeeding in seven countries in the
Southeast Asia region and the cost-benefit associated with a mod-
eled comprehensive breastfeeding strategy at national-scale in one
country, Viet Nam, using effectiveness results from a large-scale op-
erational programme.
Context in Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is a region of fast economic growth and, in countries
such as Thailand, women’s labour market participation rates are
amongst the highest in the world. Given the above-mentioned de-
cline in breastfeeding rates in the region, this study concentrated on
seven
countries
in
Southeast
Asia:
one
low-income
country,
Cambodia; five lower-middle-income countries, Indonesia, Laos,
Myanmar, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam; and one upper-middle-
income country, Thailand (World Bank 2015).
The rates of exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months in this group
of countries range from 15.1 to 17.0% in Thailand and Viet Nam,
respectively up to 73.5% in Cambodia (Figure 1). Higher exclusive
and any breastfeeding rates in this region are more common in
smaller, lower income countries (General Statistical Office 2011;
National Institute of Statistics et al. 2011; UNICEF 2011; National
Statistical Office et al. 2013). Most infants in the region do; how-
ever, receive some breastmilk during the first 6 months. The percent-
ages of infants receiving some breast-milk range between 88.5% in
Indonesia and 97.5% in Timor-Leste, except for Thailand at 61%
(Statistics Indonesia et al. 2013).
The baby food industry has increased marketing of BMS for chil-
dren under 2 years of age, particularly in emerging economies,
where potential markets have grown due to increases in disposable
incomes and the large child populations (Rollins et al. 2016). Yet,
only five out of the seven countries have legislated the Code of
Marketing of BMS to some degree, either partially or fully. The lack
of enforcement mechanisms and resources is a common gap that
limits the effectiveness of the laws. Thailand and Timor-Leste have
only drafted legislation but not yet fully enacted it into law
(Table 1). Viet Nam and Myanmar have recently updated national
codes to align with the latest WHA resolutions.
The percentage of hospitals in the region ever-certified as Baby-
Friendly ranged from an estimated 5% in Laos to 75% of hospitals
and maternity facilities in Myanmar (WHO and UNICEF 2009;
Labbok 2012). Myanmar did not undertake this programme. The
duration of legislated maternity leave in this group of countries ranges
between 12 and 14 weeks in duration. The exception is Viet Nam,
which has recently implemented 6 months (26 weeks) of paid mater-
nity leave (International Labour Office 2014). Less than 6 months of
maternity leave creates significant barriers for working mothers to
sustain exclusive breastfeeding until infants are 6 months of age.
Indonesia and Myanmar both require that 6 weeks of maternity leave
be taken before delivery, thereby limiting further support for breast-
feeding. Maternity leave is funded entirely by social security in Viet
Nam and Laos, as recommended by ILO, in contrast to the partial or
sole funding required by employers in other countries.
Most of the countries have not implemented a national comprehen-
sive strategy to support and promote breastfeeding—Viet Nam is an

 exception. Between 2010 and 2014, the Alive & Thrive breastfeeding
promotion programme was implemented in 15 of 63 provinces and
municipalities (Nguyen et al. 2014). The programme required
US$1.2m in start-up costs and US$4.64m in recurrent costs for 1-year
of implementation, policy development, monitoring, mass media cam-
paigns and social franchising of IYCF counselling. The programme
covered 599 013 women between January 2012 and September 2014
through social franchising of IYCF counselling from the third trimester
of pregnancy until children reached 2 years of age. The mean number
of visits in the last 6 months was 1.7 and 1.3 for mothers with children
under 6 and 6–23 months, respectively. The breastfeeding-counselling
package was estimated to cost �US$1.5 per visit. It was envisaged that
up to 15 counselling sessions per mother and child pairing would be
required per birth, but actual usage was �5.8 visits per mother from
birth of child until 2 years of age (Alive & Thrive 2013).
At the same time the government scaled extension of maternity
leave from 4 to 6 months across the whole country. In early 2013,
the new Advertisement Law banning the marketing of BMS for
young children <2 years of age and complementary foods for infants
<6 months came into effect. In the same year, Viet Nam institution-
alized the WHO 10 Steps for Successful Breastfeeding into the over-
all standards and accreditation systems for all public and private
hospitals with costs covered by health system and hospital budgets.
The control and intervention areas had baseline rates of exclusive
breastfeeding similar to the national average of 17.0% (General Statistics
Office 2011). The breastfeeding initiatives’ evaluation suggests that the
targeted breastfeeding strategy and underlying trends raised the rate of
exclusive breastfeeding in infants 0–5 months from 18.9 to 57.8% from
baseline to end line in the intervention sites as compared a change from
17.8 to 28.9% in the control sites. This suggests a difference-in-difference
estimated change of 28.3% over the 5-year period (Rawat et al. 2015).
Although exclusive breastfeeding rates improved, there was no change in
the rate of continued breastfeeding to 2 years. For further details of the
evaluation design (a randomized, geographically clustered, difference-in-
difference methodology, comparing 20 intervention communes to 20
similar controls, in 4 provinces) see Menon et al. (2013).
Methods
This study analysed both the costs of not breastfeeding in seven
countries in Southeast Asia and the cost-benefit of a modeled na-
tional breastfeeding promotion strategy in Viet Nam.
Costs of not breastfeeding
We estimate six components of the costs of inadequate breastfeeding
(see Figure 2) relative to counterfactual scenarios of optimal breast-
feeding. The human costs of inadequate breastfeeding include pre-
mature mortality both for children under the age of 2 as well as
mothers. Economic costs include reduced cognition, health system
treatment costs for selected illnesses in children under the age of 2
(diarrhoea and pneumonia), and the costs of BMS. In addition, we
estimate indirect costs borne by families seeking treatment for their
child’s illness in one country, Indonesia that could have been averted
by optimal breastfeeding.
The costs are relative to the counterfactual scenario where 100%
of children receive some breastmilk up to the age of 6 months (cog-
nition costs). 100% of children are exclusively breastfed to age 6
months and then continue to receive some breastmilk to age 2 years
(child mortality and health treatment costs), and 90% of women
breastfeed cumulatively for 2 years over their lifetime (maternal
mortality). This counterfactual is consistent with WHO breastfeed-
ing recommendations (allowing for the fact that not all women have
children), but we note that the highest national rate for exclusive
breastfeeding to 6 months 2008–12 was only 85% (UNICEF 2015).
The costing analyses included cost components from the govern-
ment and societal viewpoints, which measures cost to health system,
households and society, for a 1-year timeframe, but is not exhaustive
in capturing all possible social costs. Breastfeeding rates and disease
prevalence and incidence data were calculated from the latest
Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple-Indicator Cluster
Surveys (MICS) for Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia et al. 2013),
Myanmar
(Ministry
of
National
Planning
and
Economic
Development and Ministry of Health Myanmar 2011), Thailand
(National Statistical Office et al. 2013) and Viet Nam (General
Statistical Office 2011). Population data for children’s age groups
were retrieved from UNICEF statistics (UNICEF 2015).
The estimation of cognitive losses attributed to inadequate
breastfeeding assumes that some breastfeeding up to 6 months of
age is associated with an increase in IQ of 2.6 points (0.17 SDs) as
compared with no breastfeeding (Victora et al. 2015). This rate is
based on the nine studies, which controlled for maternal IQ, from a
systematic review, which identified 16 studies, of which 14 were
from high-income countries. A one SD increase in IQ is in turn asso-
ciated with an increase in labour earnings of 16% in low- and mid-
dle-income countries (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008) and labour
earnings constitute half of national income on average.

 Inadequate breastfeeding is one of the largest contributors to the
global burden of childhood disease due to the higher relative risk of
frequency of infection and mortality from diarrhoea and pneumonia
(Lopez and Murray 1998; Das et al. 2014). Exclusive breastfeeding
to 6 months substantially reduces the risk of mortality from diar-
rhoea and respiratory disease, compared with predominant, partial
and no breastfeeding, and continued breastfeeding to 2 years of age
reduces the risk compared with no breastfeeding. In order to esti-
mate the projected child mortality attributable to inadequate breast-
feeding behaviours, published relative risks by either the diarrhoea
or pneumonia infection pathway (Black et al. 2008) were multiplied
by the percentage of households in each breastfeeding behaviour cat-
egory (from DHS and MICS), and then multiplied by the total mor-
tality for each disease for the corresponding age group from WHO
Global Health Observatory data (World Health Organization
2013). This method was applied for each of the neonatal, under 6
months, and 6–23 months’ age groups separately.
The health system costs for the treatment of cases of diarrhoea
and pneumonia in children under the age of 2 attributed to inad-
equate breastfeeding were calculated using a similar methodology as
for mortality. The incidence of illness calculated was multiplied by
percentages for health-seeking behaviour by type of facility (from
DHS and MICS data) to determine the number of annual cases
treated in each type of facility. Since data on health seeking behav-
iour for the treatment of diarrhoea were not available for Myanmar,
Thailand and Viet Nam, regional averages or the best proxy avail-
able in published literature were used for those countries (Lamberti
et al. 2012; Aung et al. 2013). The estimate of the number of cases
treated in each type of facility was then multiplied by treatment unit
costs estimates.
The economic cost analysis used unit costs data collected be-
tween 2013 and 2015 since centralized national data sources on
costs were not available in these countries. Unit cost data for inpa-
tient and outpatient treatment for children with diarrhoea and pneu-
monia in both under 6 months and 6–23 month age groups were
collected through consultations with government agencies, health
facilities and non-governmental organization sources. Specific unit
costs were from Pracharak Referral Hospital and Pak Kret
Community Hospital in Thailand; Yangon Children’s Hospital, a
rural health centre and Population Service International clinics in
Myanmar; and Da Nang Hospital in Viet Nam. For Indonesia, the
authors (AS and PP) conducted an in-depth survey of health facilities
including one health post, one primary health centre, one public hos-
pital and one private hospital, and used DHS data to weight the
costs in order to generate an average for inpatient and outpatient
costs weighted by usage pattern. All costs for these four countries
were reported in 2015 US dollars. Similar data were drawn from
previous
studies
on
the
cost
of
malnutrition
in
Cambodia
(Council for Agriculture and Rural Development et al. 2013) Laos
PDR (Bagriansky and Voladet 2013) and Timor-Leste (Bagriansky
2014).
Breastfeeding also has protective benefits for mothers—it reduces
the maternal risk of breast cancer (Victora et al. 2016). The method
used for estimating the mortality of breast cancer attributed with no
breastfeeding follows the approach of Pokhrel et al. (2014) in the
UK, which is based on the fact that lifetime duration of breastfeed-
ing reduces the relative risk of morbidity from breast cancer and as-
sumes that the effect on mortality is the same magnitude. Pokhrel
et al. (2014) use an effect size based on a large collaborative reanaly-
sis from 47 studies in 30 countries. Data on breast cancer mortality
by country come from GLOBOCAN 2012 data (International
Agency for Research on Cancer 2012).
The costs of BMS purchased by families of children aged under
the age of 2 months is estimated as a proportion of household in-
come and as a proportion of GDP per capita. Data on the cost of
economy brands of infant formula were collected from local markets
in Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam and paired with ag-
gregate market size information from a Euromonitor study commis-
sioned by the WHO (Rollins et al. 2016). Data on national GDP
were retrieved from the World Bank Open Data (World Bank 2014)
and data on earnings was obtained from the International Labour
Office statistics (ILO 2015).
Last, the authors (A.S. and P.P.) conducted a survey of patient
families, in Indonesia only, in order to estimate indirect costs. A
total of 200 accompanying family members of children-seeking care
for diarrhoea or pneumonia, 50 from each of four different types of
health facilities, were surveyed about the amount of indirect costs
incurred for transportation costs, travel time, uninsured medical
costs and caregiver time.
Cost-benefit analysis for Viet Nam
Having analysed costs, a cost-benefit analysis was undertaken for
one country, Viet Nam, comparing the estimates of benefits of
improved breastfeeding with the costs of the implementation of a
modeled comprehensive breastfeeding promotion strategy at na-
tional-scale. This was undertaken using a prevalence-based method-
ology that compared the recurrent costs of a programme to promote
breastfeeding with the annual losses, which could potentially be
averted by the intervention. A limitation of prevalence-based studies
is that they assume a steady state, which applies to breastfeeding
rates in this study. This approach, however, is simpler to implement
than incidence-based methods, which have their own limitations
such as strong assumptions regarding the rate of growth of wages
several decades in the future and the social rate of discount.
The monetary benefits included the estimated cognitive losses
averted and reduced health system treatment costs. Although we
also acknowledge the human benefits related to averted child and
maternal deaths attributed to increased breastfeeding, we do not
take the step of attributing an economic value to the loss of life be-
cause this method is somewhat controversial [see e.g. Zweifel et al.
(2009)]. Neither do we include cost savings from reducing BMS pur-
chases, which would be partially offset by increased maternal food
consumption. In addition, indirect costs borne by families are not
included in this analysis since we do not have these data for Viet
Nam.
The costs of a comprehensive, national breastfeeding programme
were extrapolated from the Alive & Thrive initiative’s 5-year pro-
gramme implemented in 15 of 63 provinces and municipalities in
Viet Nam (Alive & Thrive 2013). The programme model included
monitoring and policy development, mass communications and
interpersonal counselling of women on IYCF. The calculation of the
recurrent costs of breastfeeding promotion rely on programme cost
estimates. These do not necessarily capture all social costs, e.g. if
market prices do not reflect opportunity costs of all resources. The
evaluation of this programme estimated its effect on increasing ex-
clusive breastfeeding rates and other indicators compared with con-
trol provinces (Nguyen et al. 2014).
We assumed that the costs of programme implementation in the
15 provinces could be extrapolated to the national scale (63 prov-
inces), and that maintaining the programme would also generate the
same effectiveness in increasing both partial and exclusive breast-
feeding rates to 6 months. We also included the cost estimates of ex-
tending maternity leave from 4 to 6 months, event though this

 occurred in all provinces across the country (Viet Nam Social
Insurance 2012). We assumed no change in continued breastfeeding
rates to 2 years, since this was not observed in the 15-province
intervention.
Results
Costs of not breastfeeding
We present the results for the estimates of the six cost components
here, in the same sequence as in Figure 2. The key driver for the cost
of ‘cognitive’ losses is the percentage of babies under 6 months that
are neither partially nor exclusively breastfed. As a result, the cost of
lower cognitive scores ranged from 0.03% of GNI in Timor-Leste
where 97.5% of infants under 6 months of age receive some breast-
milk to 0.54% of GNI in Thailand where only 61% of infants do so
(see Table 2). The combined total of estimated losses due to lower
cognition is �US$1.63 billion per year across the seven countries.
The majority of losses occurred in the more populous countries but
most of all US$1.34 billion for Indonesia (Table 2).
In terms of ‘infant and child mortality’, there were an estimated
10 718 annual deaths of children under the age of 2 from diarrhoea
and acute respiratory infection (ARI), a proxy for pneumonia, at-
tributable to inadequate breastfeeding in the seven countries in the
study (Table 4). ARI accounts for �70% of child deaths attributed
to inadequate breastfeeding (n ¼ 7529) and 52% of deaths in chil-
dren under the age of 2 are in the first 6 months (n ¼ 5570).
Indonesia alone accounted for nearly half of the region’s attributable
deaths (n ¼ 5377) followed by countries with relatively high mortal-
ity rates such as Viet Nam (n ¼ 2011) and Myanmar (n ¼ 1636).
Cambodia, Laos and Timor-Leste also had high mortality rates, but
a low absolute burden due to smaller population sizes.
The ‘maternal mortality’ losses are due to breast cancer, which
kills �33 164 women annually in the seven countries in this study. It
is estimated that current breastfeeding rates help prevent 1749
deaths per year from breast cancer, and there is potential to avert
another 1706 annual deaths if 90% of mothers breastfeed for 2
years (Table 3). Countries with low breastfeeding rates—specifically
Thailand (n ¼ 406) and Viet Nam (n ¼ 371)—had a disproportion-
ately high mortality from the disease.
The key drivers for ‘health treatment costs’ for the treatment of
children under the age of 2 with diarrhoea or pneumonia attributed
to inadequate breastfeeding are the disease prevalence, the propor-
tion of children that seek care in health facilities, and the health fa-
cility treatment fees. Costing data collected from several countries
produced rough estimates for average unit costs of inpatient and
outpatient treatment of diarrhoea and pneumonia. Unit costs for
treatment vary by level of care, between countries and between pub-
lic and private facilities. The average costs per child treated in
Myanmar (US$4.8 for diarrhoea and US$3.3 for pneumonia) and
Cambodia (US$9.4 for diarrhoea and US$5.3 for pneumonia) were
noticeably lower than in the other five countries, which were mostly
in the US$13–15 range for diarrhoea and US$14–19 range for pneu-
monia. Indonesia had the highest costs per child at US$22.5 for diar-
rhoea and US$19.7 for pneumonia in part due to higher costs in the
private healthcare system. Predictably, due to the population size,
Indonesia had the highest absolute health system treatment cost
(Table 2). The overall health system costs attributed to inadequate
breastfeeding in the seven countries was US$293.5 million.
In addition to the health system costs, families incur ‘indirect
health costs’ associated with seeking treatment for children with
diarrhoea and pneumonia. For 88 024 children in Timor Leste,
Bagriansky (2014) estimated a total annual cost of US$357 251 for
travel time to health facilities and child care for families. From a sur-
vey of 200 mothers in Bandung City, West Java, Indonesia, the au-
thors’ survey (A.S. and P.P.) estimated the average indirect costs
borne by families with children seeking treatment per episode
treated—some children may be treated more than once in a year.
Estimates ranged from US$0.81 for diarrhoea, US$2.02 for ARI and
US$2.71 for children suffering from both at a health post. The indir-
ect cost was twice as high for treatment at primary health centres,
which are generally further away, ten times as high at public hos-
pitals and thirty times as high at private hospitals. Indirect costs
added another 25% to the treatment costs, which is consistent with
similar estimates for Timor Leste (Bagriansky 2014).
The ‘cost of formula’ for infants is significant for average work-
ing families in low- and middle-income countries, and unaffordable
for households in the lowest wealth quintiles. The surveyed unit cost
per 400 g can of an economy brand of infant formula from markets
in the seven study countries ranges from US$2.53 in Indonesia to
US$13.22 for the equivalent size in Myanmar. Based on 54 cans
(400 g) of formula being consumed if infants up to 6 months exclu-
sively received formula (ENN et al. 2004), the cost of consumption
of infant formula (no breastfeeding) represents an estimated 13.8%
of mean nominal monthly earnings of employees in Indonesia,
20.5% in Thailand and 47% in Viet Nam.
Countries with rapidly growing economies have the highest sales
of infant and child formula in this region—a reflection of families
having increases in disposable incomes. A study by Euromonitor
(Rollins et al. 2016), reported that the value of milk annual formula
sales nationally for children under the age of 3 was estimated at
US$2400m in Indonesia, US$800m in Thailand and US$1,100m in
Viet Nam in 2014. For Myanmar, the authors estimated the total
value of sales of infant formula for children under the age of 2 to be

 �US$182 million per year. These national costs of formula repre-
sent the equivalent of between 0.22% GNI in Thailand to 0.7%
GNI in Viet Nam. Although we present these data, we note that the
entire cost of BMS is not saved by breastfeeding since mothers need
to consume additional food to account for the additional caloric re-
quirements. Exclusively breastfeeding mothers should increase their
intake by �500 kcal per day in the first 6 months (FAO 2001).
Cost-benefit analysis for Viet Nam
We estimate that the cost of the national strategy extrapolated from
annual recurrent costs of the Alive & Thrive programme plus the
costs to Social Security of improved maternity leave benefits would
be US$30.13 million per year (see Table 5). The primary monetary
benefits in the form of health systems savings due to reduced treat-
ment of child illnesses and cognitive losses averted totaled US$72.14
million. Overall, this scenario would generate human benefits of
200 child deaths averted and a BCR of $2.39 for every $1 invested,
or a 139% return on investment. Since no improvement in contin-
ued breastfeeding to 2 years occurred, there were no benefits in
terms of reduced maternal mortality from breast cancer.
Discussion
Our study finds that the costs of inadequate breastfeeding in a group
of low- and middle-income countries are substantial but differ from
estimates in the US and UK (Bartick and Reinhold, 2010; Bartick
et al. 2013; Pokhrel et al. 2014). Differences are likely due to dispar-
ities in breast cancer and childhood disease prevalence and factors
related to wealth between settings. We included cognitive losses in
the analysis for Southeast Asia, whereas others have not.
The estimated cost of a national-scale breastfeeding strategy cost
of US$30.13 million in Viet Nam is much lower than the recent esti-
mates by the World Breastfeeding Costing initiative (WBCi), a global
costing analysis. The WBCi included costs for policy development,
monitoring, legislating and implementing the international code,
training of health workers, for media promotion, community out-
reach and mother support, implementation of BFHI and maternity
entitlement for women below the poverty line. The WBCi estimates
of US$121.1 million for a comprehensive strategy in Viet Nam, or
US$52.9 million without the maternity stipends for women below
the poverty line, may be overestimated (Holla-Bhar et al. 2015).
BFHI accreditation and maternity stipends for low-income women
might increase breastfeeding rates still further, but were not included
in our studies’ cost-benefit analysis because these interventions were
not part of Alive & Thrive’s programme in Viet Nam.

 The BCR we identify is lower than those estimated elsewhere for
reducing stunting and for micronutrient interventions. Hoddinott
et al. (2013) showed that the BCR for the reduction of stunting
prevalence ranged from US$4 to US$53 per dollar invested across
18 countries. For micronutrient interventions, the BCR similarly
ranged from US$8 to US$46 (surveyed in Horton and Levin
Forthcoming 2016). Interventions involving behaviour change may
have somewhat lower BCR than those for interventions involving a
commodity such as vaccines or micronutrient supplementation or
fortification. The BCR we obtain is also lower than that estimated
for breastfeeding promotion in Ethiopia (Rajkumar et al. 2012) in
part this is because the Ethiopian study includes a monetary value
for lives saved, which we do not. Our estimate may also be conser-
vative since we included the costs of extending maternity leave to 6
months, which took place across the country, and we did not include
potential benefits from potential reduced household spending on in-
fant formula or indirect costs.
Overall, our findings on the BCR of breastfeeding promotion in
Viet Nam likely still support the Copenhagen Consensus conclusion
that the SDGs focused on reducing malnutrition reducing newborn
mortality were among the best value for money goals (Kydland et al.
2014). The encouraging results from a comprehensive breastfeeding
strategy in Viet Nam suggest that there are feasible and affordable
opportunities
to
accelerate
progress
towards
achieving
the
Sustainable Development Goal indicator and the World Health
Assembly’s Global Nutrition Target on exclusive breastfeeding by
2025.
Our estimates have some limitations. They should be updated
with new DHS and MICS datasets to be released for Viet Nam and
Myanmar. We have used effect sizes (on IQ, wages, child mortality
and morbidity and maternal mortality) derived from systematic re-
views and meta-analyses from a range of countries not just in
Southeast Asia. Cost estimates could be strengthened with more
comprehensive surveys of health care costs at various levels of care.
Notably, none of the countries had the capacity to provide national
data on health care treatment costs. We have relied on programme
costs as measured by the government, and not attempted to estimate
the full social cost of the intervention. We have not attempted to
monetize the value of child lives lost, and we were not able to obtain
data on indirect costs of health care treatment for Viet Nam. We
also did not undertake a sensitivity analysis: our estimates are par-
ticularly sensitive to the effectiveness of the breastfeeding promotion
intervention.
Conclusion
The health and economic consequences of inadequate breastfeeding
are substantial, not only for children and their families but also for
governments and the economy. This study found that up to 50% of
child deaths from diarrhoea and pneumonia and 10% of breast can-
cer deaths are due to inadequate breastfeeding—over 12 400 pre-
ventable child and maternal deaths annually in seven countries in
the Southeast Asia region. The savings in health care treatment costs
from pneumonia and diarrhoea can help offset the additional cost of
breastfeeding promotion strategies. Increased breastfeeding will re-
duce household indirect costs for treatment of childhood diseases. It
should be noted that improvements in cognition alone, through
higher IQ and earnings, potentially amount to as much as 0.5% of
Gross National Income in countries with the lowest breastfeeding
rates below 6 months.
Based on the data available and educated assumptions, this study
estimated, conservatively, that investing in a national breastfeeding
promotion strategy in Viet Nam could result in saving over 200
child lives annually and generate monetary benefits of US$2.39 for
every US$1, or a 139% return on investment. The effect of the strat-
egy may vary from country to country based on determinants of
breastfeeding and other factors including prevalence and mortality
rate of childhood illnesses, strength of health system, level of BMS
industry penetration and the nutrition policy context. Countries
with lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding are likely to have a
greater BCR. The Alive & Thrive programme success in Viet Nam
suggests that interventions need to occur at all levels—national pol-
icy, mass communications, in the workplace and in one-on-one
counselling of mothers in the community and health facilities.
