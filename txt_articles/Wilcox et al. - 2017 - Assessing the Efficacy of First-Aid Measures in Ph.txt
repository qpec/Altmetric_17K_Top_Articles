Abstract: Stings from the hydrozoan species in the genus Physalia cause intense, immediate skin pain
and elicit serious systemic effects. There has been much scientific debate about the most appropriate
first aid for these stings, particularly with regard to whether vinegar use is appropriate (most current
recommendations recommend against vinegar). We found that only a small percentage (≤1.0%) of
tentacle cnidae discharge during a sting event using an ex vivo tissue model which elicits spontaneous
stinging from live cnidarian tentacles. We then tested a variety of rinse solutions on both Atlantic and
Pacific Physalia species to determine if they elicit cnidae discharge, further investigating any that did
not cause immediate significant discharge to determine if they are able to inhibit cnidae discharge in
response to chemical and physical stimuli. We found commercially available vinegars, as well as the
recently developed Sting No More® Spray, were the most effective rinse solutions, as they irreversibly
inhibited cnidae discharge. However, even slight dilution of vinegar reduced its protective effects.
Alcohols and folk remedies, such as urine, baking soda and shaving cream, caused varying amounts
of immediate cnidae discharge and failed to inhibit further discharge, and thus likely worsen stings.

1. Introduction
Cnidarian envenomation represents a significant medical burden worldwide. Envenomation
involves the triggering and discharge of hundreds to thousands of specialized cells, called cnidocytes or
nematocytes. Certain cnidocytes contain penetrant cnidae; these microscopic venom-injecting capsules
are called nematocysts. Upon contact, nematocysts can deliver a potently toxic chemical cocktail into
unsuspecting prey or human victims [1]. Pelagic cnidarian species that possess long tentacles armed
with cnidocytes are colloquially known as “jellies” or “jellyfish”, and represent the most dangerous
members of the phylum. Jellyfish envenomation can range from mild to life threatening, depending
on the species involved, and the amount of venom delivered [2–4].
The marine siphonophores Physalia utriculus (Indo-Pacific; commonly called bluebottle) and
P. physalis (Atlantic; referred to as Portuguese man o’ war) are dangerous marine organisms commonly
found in tropical oceans. Each consists of an above-water float (pneumatophore), various specialized
feeding and reproductive structures and long, stinging tentacles used for capturing prey. These marine

stingers are often found in large groups or “armadas” that can be blown onshore by strong winds.
While deaths from Physalia stings are rare [5,6], stings can be excruciating and lead to systemic
complications, including headache, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea [1–4,7–9]. Their penetrant
cnidae (nematocysts) have long tubules, which can deliver venom nearly 1 mm into tissues and remain
embedded, likely causing secondary immunological reactions [10]. A recent study has described
a marked increase in Physalia stings along the French Atlantic coasts [11], further stressing the urgency
of standardized, evidence-based care for Physalia stings.
While vinegar dousing has been recommended historically [12], there is no universally accepted
first aid for Physalia stings, and first-aid approaches have recently become increasingly controversial [13].
Because studies have shown that physiological responses to all cnidarian envenomation are
dose-dependent, and only a small portion of available cnidae discharge upon initial contact [14], one
of the key first steps in first aid is to ensure the safe removal of adherent tentacles and undischarged
cnidae (which are capable of firing for at least two weeks after their separation from the tentacle [15]).
Thus, a critical initial first-aid goal is to remove stinging material without increasing the amount of venom
injected or the number of cnidae discharged into the skin, and thus rinse solutions that irreversibly
inhibit cnidae discharge are preferred. Rinses that trigger functional cnidae discharge to effect further
impalement of the epidermis with venom deposition cause more harm than good, potentially turning
a mild or moderate sting into a severe one. In a somewhat counter-intuitive manner, however, certain
rinses such as sea water which may appear at first consideration to be “inert” and represent a “do no
harm” type of approach, simply allow the tentacles, as well as dissociated intact cnidae, to be moved
further on the surface of the skin at which point the tentacle cnidae or isolated intact cnidae sting,
thus “spreading” the sting area and increasing the “venom load”. Further, another potential area of
unexpected contradiction is the finding that while some rinses induce discharge of cnidae along an isolated
tentacle on a microscope slide, the discharged cnidae are not functionally capable of impaling skin and/or
the venom is immediately inactivated. These two findings caused us to carefully re-examine the extant
literature. The prevailing premise has been that microscope slide assays of tentacle responses to potential
rinse solutions directly correlate to venom load and thus utility in sting management. The finding that
this is not the case [16] is pivotal in efforts to develop optimal sting management protocols.
The few investigations on potential rinse solutions for Physalia stings have been fraught with
inconsistent and contradictory results. Initial studies reported that alcohols cause massive cnidae
discharge, while discharge is absent or inhibited in the presence of weak acetic acid solutions (~5%, in
distilled water), or household vinegar [17], a finding confirmed in another hydromedusan species,
Olindias sambaquiensis [18]. Some reduction in pain was also noted with vinegar application on Physalia
stings in a prospective controlled clinical trial (N = 20) [19]. However, microscopic examination in
another study [20] found moderate cnidae discharge in the presence of vinegar (an average of “2”
out of “5”, with 5 being “maximal” discharge), and a more recent paper [21] observed what they
described as a relatively high degree of discharge among the data observed (nematocysts per 1 mm of
linear tentacle; roughly double the discharge observed after exposure to 1:10 dilution of 70% ethanol)
from Physalia physalis tentacles with the application of dilute (1:10) 5% acetic acid. Because of the
variability in laboratory-based results, it was suggested in the 1980s that vinegar use for Physalia stings
be discontinued [20,22]. This suggestion has become standard; medical doctors warn of vinegar’s
danger, even calling its use “forbidden” in the case of Physalia stings [23] (p. 86), and national and
international organizations often question or warn against the use of vinegar if Physalia is implicated
(e.g., [24–26]). The recommendation has stuck despite the fact that the combined evidence from the
highest-quality studies supports vinegar as the best course of first aid [27].
In this study, we sought to investigate the degree of cnidae discharge during a sting event. We then
sought to re-examine potential rinse solutions previously tested by other investigators, as well as popular
folk remedies (such as urine), to rigorously determine which solutions inhibit Physalia cnidae discharge
to determine the best choices for first-aid use. We compared the results for Atlantic and Pacific Physalia
species to look for species-specific responses, as well as determine whether there is likely to be a universally

applicable solution for Physalia species. Lastly, we examined whether the results of solution-based methods
that evaluate cnidae discharge correlate to functional measures of venom load (in a blood agarose-based
model), to further evaluate whether solution-based studies are clinically relevant.
2. Results
2.1. Envenomation Model and Cnidae Discharge
We previously reported the development of a spontaneous sting model [14], in which live tentacles
sting agarose containing suspended live red blood cells; the rate of cnidae discharge per unit tentacle
length in these modeled stings is indistinguishable from actual human envenomations. We used the
same methods to model P. utriculus stings and estimate the number and percent of total large and small
penetrant cnidae or nematocysts (specifically, heterotrichous anisorhizas [10]) that discharge per length
of stinging tentacle as well as the number of anisorhizas left upon point contact with the blood agarose
(all results in this section are presented as mean ± standard error). As a first approximation of the
potential maximal number of nematocysts per unit length of stinging tentacle, large anisorhiza packing
density on the dactylozooid tentacle was quantified from microscopic examination prior to stinging
(868 ± 25 cnidae per mm2; see Figure 1). The calculated cnidae density was applied to the surface
area of each nematocyst cluster or “bead” (which was estimated using two methods to be ~1.54 mm2;
see Figures 1A and A1), for a total bead cnidae count of 1337 ± 38. The number of beads per stinging
millimeter of tentacle was determined from microscopic images (4 beads per mm, contracted tentacle
length, while stinging), to yield a value of 5347 ± 154 cnidae per mm of stinging tentacle.
After a 10-minute sting, 412 ± 34 cnidae per mm of tentacle remained on the agarose, which
was 5.2 ± 1.5% of the tentacle’s available cnidae. Most of the adherent cnidae were undischarged;
only 11.8 ± 2.8% of cnidae on the agarose were discharged (24 ± 4 per mm of stinging tentacle).
Thus, during the sting event, only 0.5 ± 0.1% of tentacle large anisorhizas fired.
When slight pressure (2.5 g per cm2) was applied using a weighted microscope slide over the
adherent cnidae, the percent discharge roughly tripled from 11.8 ± 2.8% to 32.3 ± 7.2% (Figure 1C,D).
Tubules from these additionally discharged cnidae were observed penetrating into the agarose, leading
to observable increases in hemolysis.

these animals live in seawater, we used the response to seawater (0.45 μm filtered) as a baseline; not

* Degree of discharge seen in solution-only test significantly greater than seawater (comparison of solutions only: one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post-hoc tests, p < 0.05), therefore
inhibition tests were not necessarily performed. For each solution, the mean percent discharge ± standard error, are listed; sample sizes (N) were between 3 and 6. Significant differences in
test solution direct effect was observed (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Significant increases in discharge (post-hoc Sidak p < 0.05) are noted with an asterisk. Significant differences between
solutions in response to pressure were also found (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Significant reductions in pressure-induced discharge from seawater pressure-stimulated (post-hoc Sidak
p < 0.05) are noted with †. Discharge increase from pressure calculated as the solution only discharge subtracted from pressure stimulated discharge; increases in discharge with the
application of pressure of more than ten percent (indicated with italics) represent particularly dangerous options if any form of scraping or rubbing is used to remove the tentacles
and cnidae.

Solutions differed significantly in their induction of discharge (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001).
Several readily available solutions frequently recommended, including urine, shaving cream, baking
soda, and lemon juice, induced significant discharge (Tables 2 and A2). Differences were also found in
our inhibition tests (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). While vinegar irreversibly inactivated cnidae, most
solutions, including vinegar dilutions, did not completely inhibit discharge. Some solutions appeared
to partially reduce discharge, as they had significantly less pressure-induced discharge than seawater
but more than seawater alone (Sidak post-hoc comparison of solution + pressure to seawater + pressure
p < 0.05; Tables 2 and A2). However, both urine and lemon juice caused significant discharge initially,
and thus have the potential to increase the number of penetrant stinging cnidae even without pressure.
All vinegars tested as well as 5% acetic acid and Sting No More® Spray prevented pressure-induced
discharge (Sidak post-hoc comparison to solution-only p > 0.05).
2.3. Evlauation of Potential Rinse Solutions Using the Tentacle Blood Agarose Assay
To further examine solutions with promise based upon the TSA results and authenticate or
“ground-truth” the use of the TSA in evaluating first-aid solutions, functional activity assays were
conducted using live tentacles in ex vivo Tentacle Blood Agarose Assays (TBAA) to evaluate whether
a subset of the rinse solutions tested in the TSA as well as post sting topical hot-, ambient- or cold-pack
exposure led to increases or decreases in hemolytic zone formation. Live red blood cell hemolysis is
a direct venom activity assay and a functional metric of various venom constituents including venom
cytolysins, proteases, and lipases.
Temperature treatments had significant impacts on the size of the hemolytic zone 24 h after the
sting, a time dependent indicator of both venom amount and activity (Kruskal–Wallis Test, p < 0.0001
for P. physalis and one-way ANOVA, p = 0.0097 for P. utriculus; Figure 3). While the application of cold
packs has been considered a “do no harm” first aid, a marked increase in hemolytic zone was observed,
which continued to enlarge over time. Specifically, after 24 h, P. utruculus stings treated initially with
instant cold packs for 20 min, similar to those commonly carried by emergency personnel, were an
average of 2.3 times worse than stings left at room temperature and 9.2 times worse than those treated
with reusable instant hot packs, differences which were significant (post-hoc Fisher’s LSD; p = 0.0290
and p = 0.0034, respectively), while P. physalis stings treated with ice packs for 40 min were 13% worse
than those left at room temperature and more than 100-fold worse than those treated with hot packs
for the same time (Dunn’s multiple comparisons, p = 0.3964 and p < 0.0001, respectively).
The application of potential rinse solutions also had a significant impact on hemolytic zone size
for both species (Kruskal–Wallis Test, p = 0.0162 for P. physalis and one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001
for P. utriculus; Figure 4). Three solutions—soda, freshwater and ethanol—increased the size of the
hemolytic area from P. utriculus tentacles after 24 h when compared to tentacles removed by pulling
(a no solution control; 3.0, 2.6 and 2.0 times larger hemolytic zones; Fisher’s LSD, p = 0. 0007, p = 0.0065,
and p = 0.079, respectively). Vinegar pretreatment reduced the hemolytic zone area (6.4 times smaller
at 22 h; p = 0.1259). Similarly, vinegar and Sting No More® Spray pretreatment reduced the hemolytic
zone area of P. physalis tentacles, although the results were not significant.

3. Discussion
The integrated structural and functional approach taken in this study demonstrates a potential
explanation for the level of controversy in the literature related to sting first aid management.
Based upon our findings in cubozoa [15] and other species including the current study of the
siphonophore Physalia, it appears that TSA-based physical data and the presence or absence of
discharged cnidae, is not a useful predictor of sting severity, i.e., a functional metric of venom induced
tissue damage. In summary, this study further supports the use of cnidae-inactivating rinse solutions
as a primary step in the cnidarian envenomation first aid. We found that roughly 0.5% of tentacle
cnidae discharged within the first 10 min of tentacle contact to the blood agar blood cell tissue
model; in previous work, stinging of this proxy was indistinguishable from an authentic human
sting [14]. A maximum of about 50% discharge was elicited when tentacles were stimulated chemically
or mechanically (Tables 1 and 2), indicating that there may be a biological constraint on the total
amount of cnidae available to discharge. Given that cnidae are spent and replenished during feeding,
this observation makes sense, as its very likely many cnidae may be immature. If we assume that
our maximal inducible discharge represents the maximum available cnidae during a sting, then we
would estimate that about 1% of available cnidae discharge during the initial sting event. Many
of the undischarged yet available cnidae could be shed during tentacle contact, as we found large
numbers of undischarged cnidae on the agarose surface. Many of these cnidae were able to fire when
gently pressed, and thus should be considered active and dangerous. Between the tentacle itself and
the contact area, nearly 100 times the number of stinging cnidae may be available to discharge into
an unfortunate sting victim, and thus safe and effective removal of adherent tentacles and undischarged
cnidae should be considered a first-aid priority.
Overall, we found strong similarities in the responses of both species to various solutions. In two
cases, however, we saw slight differences in vitro: the Pacific P. utriculus was less responsive to both
urine and tap water than the Atlantic P. physalis. These discrepancies may be due to differences in
collection method rather than representing species-specific responses. All Pacific Physalia used in the
TSAs were collected after they washed ashore and were beached for some time (<2 h beached, but
exactly how long for each individual was unknown). The Atlantic specimens used for the TSAs, on
the other hand, were collected live from the Gulf Stream using nets. As such, they would not have
experienced any period of time out of water or dehydration or depletion due to rolling contact with
sand and may thus have been more sensitive to certain solutions, especially aqueous ones.
To our knowledge, this study represents the first laboratory test of shaving cream on Physalia
tentacles, which is often suggested by authoritative web sources (e.g., [28,29]) including the United
Kingdom National Health Service [25] to be used in combination with a razor or credit card to “shave”
away adherent cnidae. As scraping the skin would undoubtedly act to apply pressure to any adherent
cnidae and therefore increase discharge [15] (in our test, slight site pressure increased adherent discharge
by three fold; see Figure 1C,D), we tested the ability of shaving cream and other compounds to prevent
cnidae discharge regardless of whether they induce discharge. No readily available solutions outside of
vinegars fully inhibited pressure-induced discharge, and many showed large increases in discharge
after pressure application (Table 2), thus our data would suggest scraping the site should not occur
unless the area is doused with vinegar first.
These results strongly supported the use of vinegar as a rinse solution; vinegars acted as
potent inhibitors of both chemically-induced and pressure-induced cnidae discharge (Tables 1 and 2).
We found that several varieties of vinegar as well as laboratory-made dilute acetic acid solutions
inhibited cnidae discharge in both species no matter the stimulus (P. physalis results can be found in
Table A1). Further, the pre-treatment of tentacles for 30 s with vinegar significantly reduced their
ability to sting (Figure 3). These results are concurrent with Burnett et al., 1983 [17], but contrast
three other studies [20–22]. However, a closer examination of the methods used in the contrasting
studies may explain the apparent discrepancies in results. Exton [20] rated discharge from vinegar,
methylated spirits and water relative to the “maximal” (a score of 5) and “minimal” (a score of 0)
 Toxins 2017, 9, 149
9 of 17
discharge seen; vinegar scored 2/5, spirits scored 5/5, and water scored 0/5. It is difficult to compare
these results with our own as the scale is unclear and there was no indication of variability or error;
at best, we can say that in their study vinegar was substantially better than ethanol, which would be
consistent with our results. Birsa et al. [21] found that “5% acetic acid” induced discharge in P. physalis;
the addition of acetic acid led to nearly double the amount of discharge of cnidae as “70% ethanol”
(100 and 53 ± 26 nematocysts per mm of tentacle, respectively). Their alcohol results contrast Exton’s
as well as the results presented here, as we found 70% ethanol induced dramatically more discharge in
both species tested (Table 1). However, Birsa et al. [20] noted that their discharge metric—the number
of nematocysts discharged per millimeter of tentacle length—was flawed due to the variability of
nematocyst density on tentacles, and thus they ”suggest that at best it is a semi-quantitative” (p. 427).
It is unclear why they did not count undischarged cnidae to obtain a standardized value, but since
there is no indication of how variable the cnidae density was between tentacles or what the average
density was, it is unclear whether the count for 5% acetic acid is comparable to the other counts in
their table, or what degree of discharge their counts represent (if our tentacle counts of cnidae density
were used, then 100 cnidae per mm would translate to 1.8% discharge, as compared with our findings
of 0.5% for 5% acetic acid and 1.7% for 0.5% acetic acid). However, perhaps most confounding is that
Birsa et al. [20] also reported in their methods that they added 100 µL of their test solution to a well
containing 1 mL of seawater and the tentacle, which would have resulted in a final concentration of
0.5% acetic acid rather than 5% and 7% ethanol rather than 70%. Further complicating comparisons is
that acetic acid appears to have been only counted once (the value for acetic acid does not have error
margins while values for their other solutions do), thus it is impossible to determine if that count of
discharged cnidae is representative of the animals’ response. We found in our studies that the dilution
of acetic acid solutions completely abolished their protective effects, and that diluted solutions could
even induce slight discharge (Table 2); meanwhile, dilute alcohol solutions induced markedly lower
discharge than concentrated alcohols (Table 1). Based on microscope images alone, it appears that very
little discharge was induced in P. physalis overall, as only a few isolated tubules can be seen (p. 428,
Figure 1A for acetic acid, Figure 1D for ethanol)—which would be consistent with the results presented
in Table 2 for diluted solutions. The only other paper to report discharge from vinegar in Physalia
had methods too vague to compare [22]. Fenner et al. stated that in their experiments, discharge
occurred in “up to 80% of nematocysts”, but that this only occurred in “some, not all of the specimens”
and that “conflicting results were obtained if other parts of the tentacles were tested, even from the
same jellyfish”, and that “approximately 30%...showed some discharge” [22] (p. 499). Studies on
other hydrozoans have found limited or no discharge induced by vinegar and strong discharge from
alcohols, similar to our results [18,30].
The inhibition of discharge by vinegar was not due to its acidic nature alone, as other solutions
with similar pH were unable to prevent discharge. Vinegar and dilute acetic acid solutions have long
been used to preserve food and fix tissues [31]. Vinegar or ~5% acetic acid causes marked swelling of
collagen by increasing the absorption of water [31]. It has long been documented that vinegar exposure
“fixes” nematocysts rendering them incapable of functional discharge. This is likely due to the fact that
nematocyst capsule walls are comprised of collagen and that acetic acid-induced swelling irreversibly
alters the structural features required for functional firing [10]. We found strong evidence against the
use of ethanol and freshwater, as these solutions significantly increased cnidae discharge (Table 2)
and worsened stings in the TBAA model (Figure 3). In addition, our results do not support the use
of the most infamous sting treatment: urine. It is unclear exactly when the use of urine for jellyfish
stings became popular (certainly, a scene featuring the treatment method in the sitcom “Friends” aided
its spread [32]), but it has become one of the most persistent myths in toxinology. Urine induced
significant discharge in both species of Physalia tested, with discharge on par with ethanol application
for P. physalis, the larger and more dangerous species. While urine did not cause significant increases in
hemolysis in our functional assay, we did not have the opportunity to test P. physalis using the TBAA.
Furthermore, even with the less-responsive species, we did detect an increase in the hemolytic zone
 Toxins 2017, 9, 149
10 of 17
size after 22 h, which was not statistically significant perhaps due to the small sample sizes (N = 5).
Further investigations into the effects of urine in both solution-based and functional assays should be
conducted, and, in the meantime, its use for treating stings discouraged.
Although we did not see a significant increase in discharge from the application of soda in the TSA
(Table 2), it most strongly increased hemolysis in the TBAA (Figure 4). Why soda caused such damage
in the ex vivo model is unclear; soda alone did not cause hemolysis. It is possible that sugars or other
compounds present or carbonation acted to enhance cnidae discharge in the presence of perceived
prey (blood cells). Further tests are required to examine the basis of the increase in hemolysis triggered
by the addition of soda. However, perhaps more importantly, this discrepancy highlights the need for
investigating potential first aid approaches using multiple methods, as a lack of induction of discharge
in the TSA does not consistently correlate with the functional metric of venom activity, hemolysis, and
thus is of questionable value as a determinant of efficacy of first aids. Live tentacle cnidocytes are
known to be associated with sensory hair cells [33], and cnidae triggering involves both chemo- and
mechano-sensory input. From a methodological standpoint, the effects of solutions on a tentacle laying
on an inert glass surface differ from tentacle contact to the epidermis of live prey. Thus, the TSA does
not necessarily predict potential changes in cnidae triggering in the presence of human cells, nor can it
account for the physical movement of the tentacle or cnidae that may be induced by the application
of a first-aid. For example, rinsing with an “inert” solution (defined as not triggering discharge in
the TSA) may have deleterious effects in functional models, as the act of rinsing could cause tentacles
to shift or roll. Such movements could place more cnidae in contact with the skin locally, increasing
stinging, as well as move the stinging cells to previously untouched patches of skin, increasing the
size of the sting site. Experimentally, this has been demonstrated to occur with cubozoans; seawater
rinsing was found to worsen stings even though it does not directly induce discharge [15]. While the
TSA can be used as a preliminary screen to look for potent cnidae triggers, which can be dangerous to
apply to stings (such as ethanol), or effective inhibitors of discharge (such as vinegar), it should not be
considered a conclusive test for efficacy and safety, especially for solutions which neither trigger nor
inhibit cnidae discharge in vitro.
Lastly, these results bolster previous studies that support the use of heat in the treatment of Physalia
stings [34,35], as the application of heat significantly reduced hemolysis in the TBAA (Figure 3A,
red line versus black line). The application of cold not only failed to reduce hemolysis, it worsened
stings (Figure 3, blue lines). While it is possible that the application of cold increased discharge of
shed cnidae, thus directly increasing venom load, we posit an alternative possibility. These results
suggest that while the physical trauma of a sting and initial pain are acute events, venom pathogenic
mechanisms may have a protracted kinetic course. The enzyme kinetics have yet to be carefully
elucidated but time course studies (data not shown) reveal that the lipase reaction kinetics exhibit
substrate to product conversion over 12 h comparable to other cnidarian lipases [36]. The effects of
initial temperature treatments on such kinetics are not known; however, it is reasonable to believe
that cold treatment could enhance venom activity, as previous studies have found that activity is
preserved at cold temperatures and abolished by hot ones (for a review, see [37]). Further, anecdotal
accounts have noted increases in pain or “reawakening” (rebound) of the sting upon rewarming after
the application of cold [38,39]. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative report of both acute and
protracted harm from the use of cold packs, and warrants immediate reevaluation of the use of cold
packs in the treatment of cnidarian envenomations. Studies evaluating the possible injurious effects of
cold pack application in more lethal species should be conducted expediently.
4. Conclusions
It is noteworthy that the number of cnidae discharging in a Physalia sting represents a small
fraction of the packed cnidae along the tentacle surface (≤1.0% of available cnidae). For this reason,
the method of tentacle and shed undischarged cnidae removal or rinsing has the potential to
dramatically increase the sting area and thus the sting severity. We found that while various types
 Toxins 2017, 9, 149
11 of 17
of vinegar-inhibited discharge in both Physalia species, even a slight dilution of vinegar markedly
reduced inhibitory effects or led to partial cnidae discharge. Further, a 30-second treatment of vinegar
reduced stinging in our blood agarose model. The inhibition of discharge was not simply a function
of pH, as other acidic solutions did not have these results. Alcohols strongly induced discharge
in a concentration-dependent manner, and resulted in clear evidence of increased hemolysis, and
thus should be avoided. Other possible first aids, including urine, baking soda, shaving cream, dish
soap, lemon juice, and regular cola, failed to prevent pressure-induced discharge, and most elicited
discharge upon contact. This study demonstrates the need to utilize both physical reactive assays
such as the assessment of cnidae discharge as well as functional assays of venom activity in order
to more fully explore the efficacy of potential first aid approaches. The effects of carbonated soda
beverage in particular highlighted the need for multiple avenues of investigation when evaluating
first aids, as it was relatively inert in vitro but caused the greatest increase in the area of hemolytic
zone. Based on these findings, vinegar use is highly supported as the primary rinse solution for
Physalia stings, returning to recommendations made over thirty years ago. Since vinegar is already the
go-to rinse solution for other cnidarian stings, removing the Physalia caveat will simplify treatment
recommendations making them easier for the general public and first responders to remember and
apply correctly. In addition, the temperature results underscore the need for proper evaluation of
first aids prior to the adoption of their use, as cold packs severely exacerbated stings. If cold or ice
pack application results in similar increases in venom activity that has been shown with more lethal
species [16], then it could be a contributing factor to morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Urine was freshly collected from a willing volunteer prior to use and 0.45 µm filtered. The vinegar

5.1. Animal Collection
Live P. utriculus were collected after sustained strong winds from Kailua Beach on the eastern
side of Oahu (21◦23�47.7” N 157◦43�29.2” W). Animals were placed in individual containers with
ample seawater and kept cool until use. Live P. physalis for solution-based assays were collected from
gulfstream waters off Miami’s South Beach (25◦50�48.3” N 79◦48�57.7” W). Animals were netted and
bagged in gallon Ziploc bags with ample seawater and kept cool until use. Animals were warmed
to room temperature in 0.45 µm-filtered seawater before their tentacles were used. All experiments
were conducted within 72 h of collection. Live P. physalis for blood agar assays were also collected
from several beaches (Derrynane, Co. Kerry, Youghal, Co. Cork and Ardmore, Co. Waterford, all in
Ireland) during periods of strong southwesterly winds. The majority of specimens were collected
within a few hours of stranding and several were collected from the incoming tide. The specimens
 Toxins 2017, 9, 149

were typically small, with pneumatophore lengths of 60 mm to 150 mm. They were kept in ample
amounts of ambient seawater for up to 24 h, before having their fishing tentacles excised. Tentacles
were excised close to the pneumatophore using a pair of dissecting scissors and were handled with
a fine forceps before being immediately used in the experiments.
5.2. Envenomation Modeling
The Physalia cnidome consists of several cnidae types, including two nematocysts: large and small
heterotrichous anisorhizas [10,40]. Given their size and the length of their tubules (up to 1 mm long), the
most important nematocysts for venom delivery are the bigger anisorhizas; we thus sought to quantify
the discharge of these large, penetrant cnidae during a sting event. We utilized live human RBC from
normal donors (approved protocol CHS#12561, University of Hawaii Committee on Human Studies)
and low melting point agarose (Nusieve GTG Agarose, Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) to constitute a live
red blood cell agarose, a proxy for human tissue described in [14]. To calculate tentacle cnidae and
cnidae discharge, approximately 1 cm of freshly cut tentacle was weighed, placed on a cover slip, and
imaged for total length and width as well as bead length and width at 0.7× magnification (Olympus
model SZX16, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Tentacle cnidae before stinging were imaged from
below using an inverted scope at 10× magnification (Olympus model CKX41SF, Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). Tentacles were then placed on blood agarose and allowed to sting spontaneously for
10 min, with images for stinging length taken at 5 min into the sting duration. Images for length
and width measurements as well as cnidae density were taken again post-sting. Adherent cnidae
were photographed at 11.5× magnification (Olympus model SZX16, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). All tentacle measurements and cnidae counts for density and discharge were determined from
microscope images using ImageJ (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Method 1: Test for induction of discharge: Freshly cut tentacles (length 1–2 cm) were placed on
clean, dry microscope slides and examined quickly for discharge; any lengths with notable discharge
were discarded. 60 µL of the test solution was then added to the tentacle. After one minute of incubation,
a cover slip was gently placed over the tentacle. Preliminary tests with seawater confirmed that
coverslip addition did not induce significant discharge.
Method 2: Test for inhibition of chemically induced discharge: tentacles were treated as Method 1,
but after 1 min of incubation, the test solution was carefully removed, and 60 µL of 100% ethanol was
added. A coverslip was carefully placed after one minute of incubation with ethanol.
Method 3: Test for inhibition of pressure-induced discharge: tentacles were treated as Method 1,
but after the 1-minute incubation and addition of the cover slip, the slide-tentacle-slip sandwich was
pressed upon by hand for 30 s.
All photos were taken of the tentacles ten minutes after the various treatments through the
coverslip using a dissecting microscope at 10× magnification (Olympus model CKX41SF, Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Counts of discharged and undischarged cnidae were performed in ImageJ,
and statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism ver. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA).
5.4. Tentacle Blood Agarose Assay
Effect of solutions and temperature treatments on sting severity was evaluated using a variation
of the Tentacle Blood Agarose Assay (TBAA) ex vivo envenomation model outlined in [14]. Briefly, for
P. utriculus studies, red blood cells were collected from normal human donors (approved protocol
CHS#12561, University of Hawaii Committee on Human Studies) and suspended in a low melting
point agarose to create an envenomation model where the area of hemolysis serves as a proxy for
venom load. The agarose was comprised of 1% RBC and 1.5% Nusieve GTG Agarose (Lonza, Rockland,
ME, USA) in modified RPMI (“YRPMI”: 23.81 mM NaHCO3, Fisher; 102.67 mM NaCl, BDH; 5.37 mM
 Toxins 2017, 9, 149
13 of 17
KCl, Fisher; 0.41 mM MgSO4·7H2O, Fisher; 25 mM HEPES, Fisher; 6.67 mM NaH2PO4, Fisher; 0.42 mM
Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Fisher). For P. physalis studies, premade sheep’s blood agar plates were used instead
(Remel™, Lenexa, KS, USA). The two different media types used reflect the availability of appropriate
laboratory space for work with human blood products.
For P. utriculus, blood agarose lengths (75 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm) were placed on glass slides and
stung with whole fishing tentacles (~70 mm length) from freshly caught specimens. A 5-slide weight
was then added to increase stinging. For rinse solution tests, the weight was removed after 5 min
of stinging and 200 µL of the test solution was added to the tentacle; the weight was then replaced
and the tentacle was allowed to sting for another 5 min. For temperature tests, the tentacles were
allowed to sting for 10 min, with the weight briefly lifted at the 5-minute mark to mimic the rinse
solution variant. After a total of 10 min of stinging, the weights and tentacles were removed, and
saran-wrapped temperature packs were placed carefully over the slides and a mercury thermometer
(Hot packs: Heat Wave XT reusable hand warmer, Bent Grass Concepts LLC, Greenwood Village, CO,
USA; Cold packs: CVS Instant Cold Pack, CVS Pharmacy Inc., Woonsocket, RI, USA). For the room
temperature replicates, a non-initiated hot pack was placed on the slides. Temperatures under the
packs were recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min. All slides were incubated at room temperature
overnight, with photos taken at 5 and 24 h after the sting.
For P. physalis, standard 5% sheep’s blood agar plates were stung with 2- to 3-inch sections of
fishing tentacles from freshly caught specimens. A glass slide was added as weight to increase stinging.
For pretreament tests, tentacles were first incubated in test solutions for 2 min and rinsed twice for
2 min in seawater prior to 5 min of stinging. For temperature tests, the tentacles were allowed to sting
for 5 min. After the tentacles were removed, and hot water packs (~45 ◦C) or ice packs were placed
carefully over the plates. All plates were incubated at room temperature overnight, with photos taken
at 3, 18 and 24 h after the sting.
Images were recorded using a dissecting microscope (Olympus model SZX16, Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or a digital SLR camera (Fujifilm FinePix S4800, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
The area of the zone of hemolysis was calculated using ImageJ. Briefly, scale was set using the known
slide width and subsections (50 mm × 20 mm or 50 mm × 15 mm) were taken from each replicate for
analysis to remove edge effects. Controls were used to set the color threshold for no hemolysis. The total
area of the hemolytic zone was taken directly from the “analyze particles” function. Hemolytic zone
was evaluated as the area exhibiting >80% hemolysis. Outliers were defined using the median absolute
deviation (MAD) method detailed in [41], with the level of decision set conservatively at 3; any replicates
which were outliers at all time points were removed. Shapiro–Wilk normality tests were conducted
on all data sets from the 24-hour timepoint; if the data from 1/3 or more of the treatments was not
normally distributed, then Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare means. Otherwise, one-way
ANOVAs were used. All statistical analyses and post-hoc multiple comparisons were conducted in
GraphPad Prism vers. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
