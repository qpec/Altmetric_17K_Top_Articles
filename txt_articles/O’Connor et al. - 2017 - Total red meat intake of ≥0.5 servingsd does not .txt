ABSTRACT
Background: Observational associations between red meat intake
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are inconsistent. There are lim-
ited comprehensive analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
that investigate the effects of red meat consumption on CVD risk
factors.
Objective: The purpose of this systematically searched meta-analysis
was to assess the effects of consuming $0.5 or ,0.5 servings of
total red meat/d on CVD risk factors [blood total cholesterol (TC),
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, ratio of TC to
HDL cholesterol (TC:HDL), and systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures (SBP and DBP, respectively)]. We hypothesized that the con-
sumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d would have
a negative effect on these CVD risk factors.
Design: Two researchers independently screened 945 studies from
PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases and extracted
data from 24 qualified RCTs. Inclusion criteria were 1) RCT, 2)
subjects aged $19 y, 3) consumption of $0.5 or ,0.5 total red
meat servings/d [35 g (1.25 ounces)], and 4) reporting $1 CVD
risk factor. We performed an adjusted 2-factor nested ANOVA
mixed-effects model procedure on the postintervention values of
TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, SBP, and DBP; calculated overall effect sizes of
change values; and used a repeated-measures ANOVA to assess
pre- to postintervention changes.
Results: Red meat intake did not affect lipid-lipoprotein profiles or
blood pressure values postintervention (P . 0.05) or changes over
time [weighted mean difference (95% CI): 20.01 mmol/L (20.08,
0.06 mmol/L), 0.02 mmol/L (20.05, 0.08 mmol/L), 0.03 mmol/L
(20.01, 0.07 mmol/L), and 0.04 mmol/L (20.02, 0.10 mmol/L);
20.08 mm Hg (20.26, 0.11 mm Hg); and 21.0 mm Hg (22.4,
0.78 mm Hg) and 0.1 mm Hg (21.2, 1.5 mm Hg) for TC, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, TC:HDL cholesterol,
SBP, and DBP, respectively]. Among all subjects, TC, LDL choles-
terol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and
DBP, but not SBP, decreased over time (P , 0.05).
Conclusions: The results from this systematically searched meta-
analysis of RCTs support the idea that the consumption of $0.5 serv-
ings of total red meat/d does not influence blood lipids and lipoproteins
or blood pressures.

INTRODUCTION
The effects of red meat consumption on cardiovascular disease
(CVD)3 are inconsistent throughout the literature. CVD has been
the leading cause of death in the United States since the 1950s
and is currently attributable to 610,000 US deaths each year (1).
Historically, epidemiologic cohort data support associations
between high red meat intake and CVD-related events (2, 3) and
mortality (4–6). This notion is currently being challenged due to
data collection methods that group red meat with processed
meat and/or inconsistent nomenclature and classification of red
meat throughout the literature (7, 8). Regardless of contradicting
evidence, an observational study design is unable to show cau-
sality such as with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). There is
a paucity of literature that systematically and comprehensively
assesses the effects of total red meat consumption amounts on
CVD risk with data from RCTs (9).
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically search
the literature to assess the effects of total red meat consumption
on indexes of CVD risk. The search included studies with an RCT
design that measured blood lipids, lipoproteins, and/or blood
pressures. We hypothesized that the consumption of $0.5
servings of red meat/d (or w3.5 servings/wk) would negatively
affect blood lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressures. Our hy-
pothesis was based on a current prospective cohort analysis that
estimated that 8.6% and 12.2% of CVD-related deaths in men
and women, respectively, would be preventable if participants
consumed ,0.5 servings of total red meat/d (5).

 METHODS
Search strategy and data extraction
We followed the same systematic search protocol as the 2015
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee from the Nutrition
Evidence Library (10). The PICOS (Population, Intervention,
Comparator, Outcome, Study design) criteria used to define our
research question are listed in Table 1. Inclusion criteria
consisted of the following: 1) use of an RCT study design, 2)
subjects aged $19 y, 3) an intervention group or phase with
consumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d compared
with a control group or phase with consumption of ,0.5 serv-
ings of total red meat/d, and 4) reporting of $1 CVD risk factor
as a dependent variable [i.e., blood total cholesterol (TC), LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio (TC:
HDL), triglycerides, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP)]. Our meta-analysis followed the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) guidelines (11).
The original search took place in May 2015 but was updated in
May 2016. We identified studies via a computerized search of 3
databases: 1) PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), 2)
Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com), and 3) Scopus
(http://www.scopus.com). We reviewed reference lists of the iden-
tified studies and found 10 additional potential studies. Search terms
and results are identified in Table 2. All of the database searches
were completed independently by the primary author (LEO) and the
secondary author (JEK). A research librarian assisted both reviewers
(see Acknowledgments) in database and search term selection to
optimize the search process and to reduce the chance of bias.
We excluded 865 of 945 studies from our search for the following
reasons: 1) the study design was not an RCT, 2) the population was
,19 y of age or pregnant, 3) the control and intervention diets did
not differ in total red meat consumption amounts, or 4) the re-
searchers did not report the dependent variables of interest (see
Figure 1). The primary and secondary authors independently read
80 potentially eligible studies to further assess inclusion criteria and
to avoid selection bias. We contacted corresponding authors when
clarification or unpublished data were needed. We excluded 56 of
the 80 studies from the analysis for the following reasons: 1) we
were unable to determine the amount of red meat consumed, 2) the
control and intervention diets did not meet our requirements of
$0.5 or ,0.5 servings/d or $3.5 or ,3.5 servings/wk of total red
meat, or 3) we were unable to obtain the dependent variables of
interest in a usable data format. The primary and secondary authors
independently extracted data from the final 24 studies including the
following: 1) author name, 2) publication year, 3) population size
and description, 4) intervention duration, 5) protein source com-
parison consumed by the control group, and 6) the amount of total
red meat intake, dietary patterns, method of diet administration,
assessment of dietary compliance, and pre- and postintervention
values and net changes in blood TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL

 cholesterol, TC:HDL, triglycerides, SBP, and DBP for both the
control and intervention groups.
Definitions
For this meta-analysis, we used the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans (DGA) glossary definition of red meat (or “meat”)
and processed meat: “all forms of beef, pork, lamb, veal, goat, and
non-bird games (e.g. venison, bison, elk)” and “preserved by
smoking, curing, salting, and/or the addition of chemical preserva-
tives,” respectively (12). Unprocessed meat refers to meat that is
preserved by refrigeration or freezing only (13). However, all meat
available for purchase is processed to an extent (e.g., slaughtering
and packaging) so the term “minimally processed” will be used in
this meta-analysis to further describe the red meat consumed by
research subjects. Blood TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
TC:HDL, triglycerides, SBP, and DBP are common modifiable
biomarkers of CVD risk regularly assessed by physicians and
therefore are the dependent variables assessed in this meta-analysis.
Calculations, bias assessment, and statistical analyses
We obtained or calculated the amount of red meat consumed by
each group from the dietary data available in the study and contacted
authors for clarification or raw data when needed. According to the
American Heart Association, a serving size of cooked meat is 2–3
ounces (14); therefore, we considered 1 serving and 0.5 servings of
red meat to be equivalent to 2.5 and 1.25 ounces, respectively. With
the use of ProNutra software version 3.3 (Viocare, Inc.), we cal-
culated that 1.25 ounces of red meat was equivalent to 35 g. The
cutoff of 0.5 servings/d is supported by a 2012 prospective cohort
analysis that estimated that 8.6% and 12.2% of CVD-related deaths
in men and women, respectively, were preventable if subjects
consumed ,0.5 servings of total red meat/d (5).
We converted all blood lipid and lipoprotein data to mmol/L
[TC, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol conversion: mg/dL O
38.67; triglycerides conversion: mg/dL O 88.57 (15)]. We
extracted pre- and postintervention means, SDs, change values,
and SDs of the change values from the studies when available. If
not available, we calculated values, when appropriate, either from
raw data obtained from the researchers or from information that
was provided in the study and calculated change-value SDs by
using a correlation factor representative of the change-value SDs
that were available from the other studies (16). We evaluated the
risk of selection, performance, and detection biases by using the
modified Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool (17).
When discussing “studies” throughout this meta-analysis, we
are referring to the entirety of each publication. Some studies
contained .1 intervention or control group or phase. In this

 case, these interventions are presented separately and treated as
independent trials to account for within-study differences (18).
Crossover trials were included in this meta-analysis; the present
results and figures show crossover trial means and SDs incor-
porated into the data set as if they were parallel designs (19).
This approach uses a correlational factor of 0 for all trial SDs.
We recognize that this approach is conservative and causes
crossover studies to be underweighted; therefore, we conducted
secondary analyses to approximate a paired analysis for each
variable by imputing missing SDs with the use of a correlational
factor of 0.99 for all crossover design studies (20).
With the use of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), we performed
a repeated-measures ANOVA to assess pre- to postintervention
changes in TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL, tri-
glycerides, SBP, and DBP. We performed a 2-factor, nested ANOVA
mixed-effects model procedure on the postintervention values of
each dependent variable after adjustment for baseline values, age,
sex, BMI, length of intervention, and whether energy restriction was
or was not included in the protocol (21). These results are reported
as adjusted least-squares means. We analyzed the change values by
using STATA/IC 14 (StataCorp) and calculated the overall effect
size by using the metaan function (intervention group or phase
change value minus control group or phase change value). We used
a random-effects model when heterogeneity was indicated by
a significant chi-square test; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was
used (22, 23). These results are reported as weighted mean dif-
ferences and 95% CIs. Studies in Figures 2–8 are organized in
descending order from smallest to largest amounts of total red meat
consumed per day by the intervention group or phase. Significance
was set at P , 0.05. A statistical consultant approved all calcu-
lations and analyses (see Acknowledgments).
We performed traditional sensitivity analyses by removing 1
study or trial at a time and reconducting the analyses. We per-
formed additional sensitivity analyses by removing clusters of

 studies containing design features that had the potential to
confound results, including weight-loss diets (27, 29), heart-
healthy diets (25, 26, 28, 34, 35, 39, 42, 43), diseased populations
[hypertensive (26, 28, 38), hypercholesterolemic (34, 35, 42),
and/or diabetic (32)], studies that resulted in significant weight
loss (25, 27–29, 35), inclusion of processed meat (45), studies
that did not specify the degree of meat processing (24, 25, 27,
32, 36, 40, 43, 46, 47), and studies that used different amounts of
protein intake in the control and intervention group or phase (29,
32, 38, 43). We also performed post hoc analyses by dividing the
studies into specific quantities of red meat consumption [1.0–1.9
servings of red meat/d (24–29), 2.0–2.9 servings of red meat/d
(30–37), or $3.0 servings of red meat/d (38–43)] and re-
conducted the analyses in STATA.
RESULTS
Study features and subject characteristics
Twenty-four studies were included in the statistical analyses
(see Figure 1); some contained .1 control group or phase (29–
32, 36, 42, 43) and are reported as separate studies. Details of
each study are shown in Table 3. The median total red meat
servings per day in the control and intervention groups were
0 servings/d (range: 0–0.4 servings/d or 0–30 g/d) and 2 servings/d
(or 140 g/d; range 1.0–7.1 servings/d or 68–500 g), respectively.
Two of the selected studies included a weight-loss diet (27, 29), 8
studies included a heart-healthy dietary pattern (25, 26, 28, 34,
35, 39, 42, 43), the subjects self-selected their diet similar to their
habitual intake in 9 studies (24, 30, 31, 36–38, 46, 40, 41), and 5

 of the selected studies were unclear about the diet other than the
predominant protein source (32, 33, 44, 45, 47). Only minimally
processed meats were consumed in 15 studies (25, 26, 28, 29, 30,
31, 33–35, 37–39, 41, 42, 44), highly processed meats were
consumed in 1 study (45), and the extent of meat processing was
unclear in the remaining 8 studies (24, 27, 32, 36, 40, 43, 46, 47).
Intervention lengths varied from 2 to 32 wk.
Quality and bias of selected studies
Due to clear reporting of randomization methods, we deemed 5
studies at low risk of selection bias (24, 25, 29, 38, 46). Re-
searchers disclosed allocation concealment methods in 2 studies
(24, 25), but the rest were unclear about allocation methods. Three
studies were at low risk of performance bias [2 investigator-blinded
studies (34, 38) and 1 double-blind study (45)] but the rest did not
report blinding. Detection bias was unclear in all of the studies
except for 3 that were blinded for outcome assessment (25, 34, 38)
(see Supplemental Table 1). In 16 articles, the researchers pro-
vided food to the subjects (mainly protein-rich foods) (24, 26–29,
31, 33, 37–45), but the rest did not provide food or did not specify
if they provided food to the subjects. Researchers assessed dietary
compliance in numerous ways, which are shown in Table 3, in-
cluding dietary counseling, interviews, or questionnaires (24–27,
33–35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 46); food records, logs, or menus (26, 28–
32, 34–36, 38, 40, 43, 46); and/or urinary markers such as urinary
3-methyl histidine (45), urinary electrolyte excretion (26), and
24-h urinary urea nitrogen output (28, 32). Most studies showed
the use of .1 of these methods of dietary compliance.

ANOVA). The results showed no differences in postintervention
values between the groups who consumed $0.5 or ,0.5 servings
of total red meat/d for any of the dependent variables (2-factor
nested ANOVA mixed-effects model; P . 0.05 for all variables;
see Table 4). Our analysis of the change values suggested no
difference in responses over time between the groups who
consumed $0.5 or ,0.5 servings of total red meat/d in TC, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL, triglycerides, SBP, or
DBP (fixed- or random-effects model; see Figures 2–8). There
was no indication that consumption of progressively higher red
meat amounts influenced these CVD risk factors (see Figures

 2–8; the amount of red meat consumed progressively increases
from top to bottom of each figure). Results from imputing SDs of
crossover designs with 0.99 as the correlational factor did not differ
from the original results with the use of 0 as the correlational factor.
More than 99% of the traditional sensitivity analyses showed no
significant change in results. No cluster sensitivity analyses sig-
nificantly changed results when we removed studies that included
weight-loss diets, heart-healthy diets, significant weight loss, dis-
eased populations, consumption of processed red meats or no
specification of the degree of meat processing, and studies that used
different amounts of protein intake in the control and intervention
group/phase. Post hoc analyses of red meat consumption amounts
showed no differences in change values between the control and
intervention group, whether consuming 1.0–1.9, 2.0–2.9, or $3.0
servings of red meat/d, with the exception that HDL cholesterol
was higher when $3.0 servings of red meat/d was consumed
(weighted mean difference: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.16). (See
Supplemental Table 2 for results of all sensitivity analyses.)
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematically
searched meta-analysis to assess the consumption of $0.5
servings of total red meat/d on blood lipids, lipoproteins, and
blood pressures by using data from RCTs. This serving size is
consistent with the dietary patterns recommended by the 2010–
2015 DGA and the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee. Our results indicate that the
consumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d does not in-
fluence these clinically relevant and commonly measured mod-
ifiable CVD risk factors. These results do not support our
hypothesis, which was based on a 2012 observational cohort
study that estimated that the consumption of $0.5 servings of
total red meat/d would increase CVD mortality (5). Our results
align with a previous meta-analysis of 8 studies, which concluded
that changes in blood lipids and lipoproteins did not differ when
lean, unprocessed beef was consumed compared with poultry or
fish (9). Our meta-analysis of 24 studies is more generalizable
because it was inclusive of a variety of red meat types and also
assessed blood pressure. It is important to emphasize that our
conclusions do not support a cardioprotective effect of higher red
meat consumption, such as is shown with fatty fish (48), but that
the consumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d does not
affect changes in blood lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressures.
Although the median daily total red meat intake in the in-
tervention group or phase was 2 servings, almost double what the
average American consumes [w1.2 servings/d (49)], the range
was large (1.0–7.1 servings/d). There is no visual threshold of
total red meat consumption that indicates an apparent negative
effect on blood lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressures, as
shown by the nondescript dispersal of the data in Figures 2–8.
Although we used the cutoff of 0.5 servings of total red meat/d
(5), we performed post hoc analyses to test if the studies with
lower red meat consumption were washing out the effects of
higher red meat consumption. The highest category of red meat
consumption (.3 servings of red meat/d) showed no negative
effects on blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and blood
pressures and resulted in higher HDL concentrations. Because
substituting protein for carbohydrate and adopting a “heart
healthy” diet are shown to improve blood lipid and lipoprotein

 concentrations and blood pressure (50–53), we performed cluster
sensitivity analyses to assess studies without these characteristics.
This did not influence our conclusion that consuming $0.5
servings of red meat/d does not affect changes in blood lipid and
lipoprotein concentrations and blood pressures. Therefore, this
meta-analysis compared protein sources rather than macronutrient
compositions within the context of a variety of diets.
The Mediterranean-style and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension) dietary patterns are “heart healthy” diets that
include ,0.5 servings of red meat/d. The Mediterranean-style
dietary pattern is predominantly modeled on observational cohort
studies (54–57) and 1 large-scale RCT (58) that indicate a lower
incidence of CVD-related events, mortality, and lower CVD risk
with the consumption of this dietary pattern. However, these
studies reported red meat consumption of .0.5 servings of red
meat/d [range: w2–3.5 servings/1000 kcal; see Figure D1.59 in
the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee (59) for a graphic summary of these studies, with the
exception of our reference 57]. Therefore, it is unclear what
studies are supportive of this recommendation for red meat in the
context of a Mediterranean-style diet. The DASH diet, by design,
limits red meat consumption to ,0.5 servings/d (60). However,
current RCTs showed that the DASH diet has equivalent effec-
tiveness to reduce blood lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressures
when it contains .0.5 servings of red meat/d [1.6 or 2.2 servings
of beef (61, 62) or 1.7 servings of pork (28) daily]. Collectively,
these studies suggest that the consumption of .0.5 servings of
red meat/d in the context of these recommended dietary patterns
does not hinder improvements in CVD risk factors.
The conflicting literature creates ambiguous conclusions in
dietary guidance pertaining to red meat consumption amounts.
The Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee concluded that “lean meats” can be incorporated into
a healthy diet in relatively small amounts, but there is no
specificity to the type or amount of lean meat. Communication
to the general public from the 2015–2020 DGA combines red
meat with the “meat, eggs, and poultry” recommendation rather
than its own food group (12), as done in previous DGAs (63).
Dietary recommendations based on the 2010–2015 DGA, with
support from the 2015 Advisory Report, suggest that red meat
consumption should be limited to w0.5–0.7 servings/d or
w3.5–5 servings/wk (59, 63); this varies because the serving
size range is 2–3 ounces. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee search process has strict criteria that limit the in-
clusion of data from available RCTs (64), so this conclusion is
based predominantly on epidemiologic associations (63). This
restricts the conclusions to be mainly based on associative
conclusions of morbidity and mortality rather than cause and
effect of disease risk, both of which need to be considered in
determining dietary guidance and public policy.
A strength of this systematically searched meta-analysis is the
use of RCT designs, which allows our conclusions to be based on
the principle of causation. These RCTs assessed the effects of
consumption of total red meat on CVD risk factors for relatively
short periods of time (2–32 wk). In contrast, epidemiologic studies
have assessed the association between total red meat consumption
and CVD-related morbidity and mortality that typically require
years or decades of follow-up and are not suitable to determine
causality. Thus, results from RCTs support that the consumption
of red meat does not influence CVD risk factors, whereas epi-
demiologic studies support that the consumption of red meat is
associated with higher incidences of CVD-related morbidity and
mortality. Future efforts and research by academic, industry, and
government leaders are needed to improve the scientific founda-
tion and communication to the public about the effects of red
meat on diet quality and human health by including evidence
from both types of study designs.
Another strength of this meta-analysis is the high external
validity because we did not restrict our search to certain dietary
patterns, populations, or types of red meat (65). Although this
created heterogeneity among data within each blood lipid and
lipoprotein variable (indicated by the I2 scores; see Figures 2–6),
the extensive sensitivity analyses did not affect overall findings
when potential modifiers were excluded. Data from other CVD
risk factors, such as endothelial cell function and inflammation,
were not collected for this meta-analysis. These factors can
progress to CVD when traditional risk factors are unchanged
(66) and therefore may be a limitation of this analysis. We did
not exclude studies based on the criteria used by the Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (64) and recognize that a meta-
analysis is only as strong as the empirical evidence included.
We raise concern about the unclear bias reporting, which was

 common in the studies included in this meta-analysis, and urge
researchers to comprehensively report study design characteris-
tics. We are also aware that there are other potential human and
environmental health risks associated with higher red meat intake,
which are beyond the scope of this review, and include but are not
limited to cancer (67) and environmental sustainability (68, 69).
In conclusion, the results from this systematically searched meta-
analysis of RCTs support that the consumption of $0.5 compared
with ,0.5 servings of total red meat/d does not influence blood
lipids, lipoproteins, and/or blood pressures, which are clinically
relevant CVD risk factors. These results are generalizable across
a variety of populations, dietary patterns, and types of red meat.
These results are inconsistent with much of the observational
evidence related to red meat consumption and CVD, which
prompts the need for future research to reconcile the apparent
disconnect between RCT and observation-based conclusions.
