T
he increase in cesarean delivery over the past several 
decades has occurred concomitantly with a decline in 
operative vaginal deliveries. In the United States, opera-
tive vaginal delivery rates decreased from 9.4% in 1995 to 3.1% 
of all deliveries in 2015, whereas cesarean delivery rates 
increased from 20.8% to 32.0%.1,2 In Canada as well, rates of 
operative vaginal delivery followed the same downward trajec-
tory, from 16.8% of all vaginal deliveries in 1995 to 13.2% in 
2014,3,4 whereas cesarean delivery rates increased from 17.6% to 
27.3% of all deliveries. This inverse relationship has led to recom-
mendations for increasing rates of operative vaginal delivery as a 
solution for addressing the high rates of cesarean delivery.5
Such recommendations for addressing increases in cesarean 
delivery are premised on the assumption that operative vaginal 
delivery has greater relative safety compared with cesarean deliv-
ery. However, recent studies6–9 have shown higher rates of severe 
perinatal and maternal adverse outcomes after operative vaginal 
delivery. In particular, our previous work6,7 showed substantially 
higher rates of obstetric trauma among midpelvic forceps and vac-
uum deliveries, compared with cesarean deliveries (adjusted rate 
ratio [ARR] 8.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.22–9.96 and 6.90, 
95% CI 5.86–8.13, respectively). The ARRs for severe birth trauma 
were 4.33, 95% CI 2.31–8.11 for forceps and 3.16, 95% CI 1.65–6.05 
for vacuum versus cesarean delivery.7 Nevertheless, the population-
level impact of increasing the rate of operative vaginal delivery on 
obstetric and birth trauma rates has not been quantified.
We sought to characterize temporal trends in obstetric trauma 
and severe birth trauma in Canada, by mode of delivery, by opera-
tive instrument (i.e., forceps or vacuum) and by pelvic station 
(outlet, low or midpelvic). We also aimed to quantify the associa-
tions between population rates of operative vaginal delivery and 
obstetric trauma and severe birth trauma.
Methods
We obtained data on all hospital deliveries in 4 Canadian provinces 
— Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan — from the Canad-
ian Institute for Health Information’s Discharge Abstract Database.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Increased use of opera-
tive vaginal delivery (use of forceps, vac-
uum or other device) has been recom-
mended to address high rates of 
cesarean delivery. We sought to deter-
mine the association between rates of 
operative vaginal delivery and obstetric 
trauma and severe birth trauma.
METHODS: We carried out an ecological 
analysis of term, singleton deliveries in 
4 Canadian provinces (2004–2014) using 
data from the Canadian Institute for 
Health Information. The primary expos-
ure was mode of delivery. The primary 
outcomes were obstetric trauma and 
severe birth trauma.
RESULTS: Data on 1 938 913 deliveries 
were analyzed. The rate of obstetric 
trauma was 7.2% in nulliparous women, 
and 2.2% and 2.7% among parous 
women without and with a previous 
cesarean delivery, respectively, and 
rates of severe birth trauma were 2.1, 
1.7 and 0.7 per 1000, respectively. Each 
1% absolute increase in rates of opera-
tive vaginal delivery was associated 
with a higher frequency of obstetric 
trauma among nulli 
parous women 
(adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.06, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.06), parous 
women without a previous cesarean 
delivery (ARR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.13) 
and parous women with a previous 
cesarean delivery (ARR 1.11, 95% CI 
1.07–1.16). Operative vaginal delivery 
was associated with more frequent 
severe birth trauma, but only in nullipa-
rous women (ARR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–
1.07). In nulliparous women, sequential 
vacuum and forceps instrumentation 
was associated with the largest increase 
in obstetric trauma (ARR 1.44, 95% 
CI 1.35–1.55) and birth trauma (ARR 
1.53, 95% CI 1.03–2.27).
INTERPRETATION: Increases in popula-
tion rates of operative vaginal delivery 
are associated with higher population 
rates of obstetric trauma, and in nullipa-
rous women with severe birth trauma.

We excluded deliveries that occurred in the other provinces and ter-
ritories in Canada because of a lack of detailed information on par-
ity. Trained health records personnel abstracted information from 
medical records in the Discharge Abstract Database using standard-
ized definitions, and data accuracy was ensured through routine 
quality assurance checks. Information in the database included 
details regarding medical history, maternal characteristics, labour 
and delivery, and neonatal condition, and details of diagnoses and 
interventions or procedures. Diagnoses and procedures in the data-
base (e.g., obstetric trauma, forceps delivery) represent notations in 
the medical chart made by physicians and were coded using the 
Canadian version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-
10-CA) and the Canadian Classification of Interventions. The accu-
racy of perinatal information in the database has been validated.10,11 
In particular, maternal morbidity, such as severe perineal lacera-
tions, had a high sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity for third- and 
fourth-degree perineal lacerations was 97.1% and 94.7%, respec-
tively, and the specificity for both diagnoses was 99.9%).10 Further-
more, a 2015/16 Discharge Abstract Database reabstraction study 
showed high agreement for obstetric trauma indicators (97.0% 
agreement, 95% CI 95.4%–98.6%).11 Severe perinatal morbidity in 
the neonate, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, had a sensitivity 
of 88.9% and a specificity of 100%, and fracture of the clavicle had a 
sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 100%.10
All hospital deliveries between 37 and 41 weeks’ gestation 
that resulted in a singleton live birth between April 2004 and 
March 2015 were included in the study (fiscal years 2004–2014). 
We grouped operative vaginal deliveries into 3 categories based 
on pelvic station: outlet, low-pelvic and midpelvic.12
The 2 primary outcomes were obstetric trauma and severe 
birth trauma. Obstetric trauma included severe perineal lacera-
tions (third- and fourth-degree), cervical and high vaginal lacera-
tions, pelvic hematoma (perineum, vagina or vulva), obstetric 
injury to the pelvic organs, pelvic joints or ligaments, injury to the 
bladder or urethra, laceration to the broad ligament of the uterus, 
extension of the uterine incision, wound dehiscence and other 
obstetric trauma. Severe birth trauma included intracranial hem-
orrhage and laceration, skull fracture, severe injury to the central 
or peripheral nervous system, fracture of the long bones and 
injury to the liver or spleen. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
confounders and outcomes are listed in Appendix 1 (available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171076/-/DC1).
Statistical analysis
We categorized women by parity and obstetric history into 
3 strata: nulliparous women, parous women without a previous 
cesarean delivery and women with a previous cesarean delivery. 
Within each of these strata, we assessed temporal trends in 
obstetric and severe birth trauma by mode of delivery, operative 
instrument and pelvic station using the Cochran–Armitage test 
for linear trend in proportions by year and by comparing rates in 
2014 with those in 2004. We estimated ARRs and 95% CIs using 
ecological random-intercept Poisson regression models to quan-
tify the associations between rates of operative vaginal delivery 
and obstetric trauma and severe birth trauma, while addressing 
clustering of observations at the province-year level. We used 
stratified analyses to quantify the effects of instruments (forceps, 
vacuum, sequential instrumentation) and the pelvic station at 
which the operative vaginal delivery was attempted, while adjust-
ing for confounders — namely, maternal age, hypertensive disor-
ders, diabetes, labour induction, macrosomia and year of deliv-
ery. Each province-year represented 1 unit of analysis, resulting in 
44 units in each of the 3 strata (n = 132). The number of cases of 
obstetric trauma (or severe birth trauma) in each province-year 
served as the outcome and these were offset by the number of 
live births in that province-year. We conducted all analyses using 
SAS version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Ethics approval
Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Clinical Research 
Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia (H14–02746). 
Results
The study population included 1 938 913 term, singleton deliveries. 
Temporal trends in the rates of operative vaginal delivery, obstetric 
trauma and severe birth trauma over the study period are shown in 
Appendix 2 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.171076/-/DC1). The rates of operative vaginal delivery and 
cesarean delivery were 18.2% and 26.6%, respectively, in nulli 
parous 
women; 5.5% and 6.7%, respectively, in parous women with no pre-
vious cesarean delivery; and 3.4% and 81.9% in women with a previ-
ous cesarean delivery (Table 1). The rate of obstetric trauma was 
7.2% among nulliparous women, 2.2% among parous women with-
out a previous cesarean delivery, and 2.7% among women with a 
previous cesarean delivery, and the rate of severe birth trauma was 
2.1, 1.7 and 0.7 per 1000 deliveries in the 3 groups, respectively 
(Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.171076/-/DC1). Most cases of obstetric trauma among opera-
tive vaginal deliveries were a result of severe perineal lacerations 
(86.3%), and injury to the bladder or urethra (44.5%) and repair 
required for the uterine incision (27.3%) constituted the most fre-
quent obstetric traumas among cesarean deliveries (Table 2). Severe 
birth trauma after operative vaginal delivery was mostly a result of 
brachial plexus injury among both operative vaginal deliveries 
(64.9%) and cesarean deliveries (30.4%; Table 3). Injury to the femur 
or humerus was also common among cesarean deliveries (22.7%).
Temporal trends in obstetric trauma
Obstetric trauma rates increased significantly among nulliparous 
women, from 6.6% of deliveries in 2004 to 7.2% in 2014 (p < 0.001), 
and among women with a previous cesarean delivery, from 2.5% to 
3.0% (p < 0.001; Figure 1A). The increased rate of obstetric trauma 
was most pronounced among operative vaginal deliveries, with 
rates increasing from 16.6% to 19.4% among nulliparous women 
(p < 0.0001; Figure 1B) and from 13.8% to 18.7% among women 
with a previous cesarean delivery (p = 0.0001; Figures 1B–1D).
Obstetric trauma rates stratified by operative instrument showed 
the largest increases among forceps deliveries in nulliparous women 
(19.4% in 2004 to 26.5% in 2014; p < 0.0001; Appendix 4, supplemen-
tal Figure S2A, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/

delivery (10.3% to 14.3%; p = 0.0001; Appendix 4, supplemental Fig-
ure S2B) and parous women with a previous cesarean delivery 
(16.6% to 25.5%, p = 0.02; Appendix 4, supplemental Figure S2C). The 
rate of obstetric trauma increased significantly at low-pelvic station 
among all groups, regardless of parity or obstetric history (p < 0.0001 
for all 3 groups; Appendix 5, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.171076/-/DC1).
Temporal trends in severe birth trauma
Overall rates of severe birth trauma did not change appreciably in 
nulliparous or parous women (Figure 2). However, among women 
who had an operative vaginal delivery, the rate of severe birth 
trauma increased significantly among nulliparous women (from 4.5 
in 2004 to 6.8 per 1000 deliveries in 2014; p = 0.0001; Figure 2B) and 
parous women without a previous cesarean delivery (from 6.5 to 10.6 
per 1000 deliveries; p < 0.01; Figure 2C). In nulliparous women, the 
increase in severe birth trauma was most pronounced among deliv-
eries with sequential instrument application (7.4 in 2004 and 14.3 per 
1000 deliveries in 2014; p = 0.01; Appendix 6, supplemental Figure 
S4A, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.171076/-/DC1) and among operative vaginal deliveries at outlet 
pelvic station (2.1 to 9.2 per 1000 deliveries; p = 0.04; Appendix 7, sup-
plemental Figure S5A, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.171076/-/DC1). Linear trends in the rate of severe 
birth trauma by operative instrument and pelvic station were not sig-
nificant among parous women (Appendix 6, supplemental Figures 
S4B and S4C, and Appendix 7, supplemental Figures S5B and S5C).
Association between operative vaginal delivery and 
obstetric trauma
In nulliparous women, the rate of operative vaginal delivery was pos-
itively associated with obstetric trauma (ARR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05–1.06;

Table 4). This association was significantly stronger in parous women 
with and without a previous cesarean delivery (ARRs 1.11, 95% CI 
1.07–1.16 and 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.13, respectively).
The ARR expressing the association between the rate of forceps 
and obstetric trauma in nulliparous women was 1.09 (95% CI 1.08–
1.10), and the ARR for vacuum delivery was 1.06 (95% CI 1.05–
1.07). Among parous women, the ARRs for the association 
between forceps or vacuum and obstetric trauma were similar to 
those in nulliparous women. However, deliveries after the use of 
sequential instruments were not significantly associated with the 
rate of obstetric trauma in either group of parous women. Opera-
tive vaginal deliveries at outlet, low-pelvic and midpelvic station 
were positively associated with obstetric trauma in nulliparous 
and parous women (Table 4).

Calculations based on the number of term, singleton live births 
in Canada in 2015–1613 showed that a 1% increase in the rate of 
operative vaginal delivery would result in about 708, 360 and 
158 excess cases of obstetric trauma per year in nulliparous women, 
parous women without a previous cesarean delivery, and parous 
women with a previous cesarean delivery, respectively (Table 4).
Association between operative vaginal delivery and 
severe birth trauma
Operative vaginal delivery rates were positively associated with 
severe birth trauma only in nulliparous women (ARR 1.05, 95% CI 
1.03–1.07) and only with sequential instrumentation (ARR 1.53, 
95% CI 1.03–2.27; Table 4). Pelvic station–specific rates of opera-
tive vaginal delivery were positively associated with severe birth 
trauma at low-pelvic station (ARR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12) and mid-
pelvic station (ARR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07; Table 4). The absolute 
increase in the rate of severe birth trauma per 1% increase in the 
rate of operative vaginal delivery was 0.11 per 1000 deliveries to 
nulliparous women, which would result in about 18 excess cases of 
severe birth trauma in Canada annually.13
Interpretation
Our study showed that the rate of obstetric trauma has increased 
in Canada in recent years. This increase was concentrated 
among operative vaginal deliveries, particularly in forceps deliv-
eries among nulliparous women and women who had a previous 
cesarean delivery. The rate of severe birth trauma also increased 
among operative vaginal deliveries in nulliparous women and 
parous women without a previous cesarean delivery. 
Additionally, our study showed positive associations between 
the rate of operative vaginal delivery and obstetric trauma after

Canada, 2004–2014. Using the Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend in proportions, p < 0.001 for overall obstetric trauma trend among nulliparous and 
parous women (with and without a previous cesarean delivery); p < 0.001 for obstetric trauma trend among operative vaginal delivery in all 3 groups; 
p < 0.0001, 0.03, and 0.01 for obstetric trauma trend among spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women, parous women without cesarean deliv-
ery, and women with a previous cesarean delivery, respectively; and p = 0.2, 0.07 and < 0.0001 for these trends in cesarean delivery among the same 
3 groups, respectively. Note: CD = cesarean delivery, OVD = operative vaginal delivery, SVD = spontaneous vaginal delivery.

adjustment for known confounders. The associations between 
operative vaginal delivery and obstetric trauma were significantly 
stronger among parous than among nulliparous women. The rate 
of operative vaginal delivery was also positively associated with 
severe birth trauma in nulliparous women, but not in parous 
women. These findings show the potential population-level impact 
of attempts to increase the use of operative vaginal delivery.
Third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, or obstetric anal 
sphincter injury, represented most of the obstetric trauma cases 
among women with operative vaginal delivery. Quality-of-life 
impairments after obstetric anal sphincter injury include perineal 
pain, dyspareunia and sexual dysfunction, abscess formation, 
wound breakdown and rectovaginal fistulae.14 Perhaps the most 
disabling complication is anal incontinence, and obstetric anal 
sphincter injury is the most common cause of anorectal symptoms 
in women.15 The reported rates of anal incontinence after the pri-
mary repair of obstetric anal sphincter injury range between 15% 
and 61%, with a mean of 39%,15 and these rates increase with time, 
up to 54% at 3–8 years after delivery.16 Moreover, there is accumu-
lating evidence of a positive association between the rate of opera-
tive vaginal delivery and subsequent rates of surgery for pelvic 
organ prolapse.17 The benefit versus risk profile of operative vaginal 
delivery may therefore require re-evaluation in light of these long-
term effects.
Comparison with other studies
The rates of obstetric trauma in our study are consistent with rates 
reported from other provinces of Canada,18 as well as from the 
United Kingdom.19 The temporal increase in obstetric trauma we 
observed in this study did not parallel obstetric trauma trends in 
the US; the obstetric trauma rate in Washington state decreased 
from 6.7% in 1987 to 2.5% in 2009, and the operative vaginal deliv-
ery rate declined from 6.3% to 3.9%.17 The increase in obstetric 
trauma among operative vaginal deliveries in our population

occurred concomitantly, with an 11% decline in the rate of opera-
tive vaginal delivery in Canada over the study period.20 The tem-
por 
al increase in adverse maternal outcomes among operative 
vagin 
al deliveries suggests that the safety of these procedures is 
declining in Canada, especially after forceps use. This trend may 
be due to a decline in expertise, to poor selection of candidates for 
operative vaginal delivery,21 or perhaps to operative vaginal deliv-
ery being reserved for the most severe cases.
Limitations
The limitations of our study include those that are typical of large 
database studies (such as data transcription errors). Also, our analy-
ses were based on an ecological design and the quantified relation-
ships are susceptible to the ecological fallacy. However, an ecological 
design is appropriate for assessing associations at the population 
level,22,23 and individual-level studies also show that operative vaginal 
deliveries cause obstetric and birth trauma.6–9 Measurement of pelvic

station can be subjective and can be affected by moulding and fetal 
head position.24,25 Our estimates reflect the average trauma rates for 
outlet, low- and midpelvic procedure, as carried out under current 
norms of diagnosis by contemporary maternity care providers. 
Although we adjusted for rates of common pregnancy complications 
(viz., hypertension and diabetes), some uncommon complications 
may have been overrepresented in the cesarean delivery group. We 
did not have information on long-term outcomes, such as morbid pla-
centation after cesarean delivery, which is particularly important for 
women planning large families. We were not able to account for clus-
tering by multiple deliveries to the same woman, which may have had 
a small effect on the precision of our estimates. Finally, we were not 
able to adjust for trends in important maternal characteristics such as 
pre-pregnancy obesity, for which our data source lacked information.
Conclusion
The rates of obstetric trauma and severe birth trauma have 
increased among operative vaginal deliveries despite an overall 
decline in the use of operative vaginal delivery. There is a positive 
association between the population rate of operative vaginal deliv-
ery and population rates of obstetric trauma, and severe birth 
trauma in nulliparous women. Recommendations to reduce cesar-
ean delivery rates by increasing rates of operative vaginal delivery 
should be tempered by the understanding that such actions may be 
associated with higher rates of obstetric trauma. Continued con-
certed efforts toward improving the recognition and management 
of obstetric anal sphincter injury are warranted.
