This study examined factors associated with suicide attempts among those with schizophrenia (ùëõ = 101) versus those without
(ùëõ = 21,643) in a representative sample of noninstitutionalized Canadians. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts among
persons with schizophrenia was 39.2% versus 2.8% of nonafflicted individuals. After adjusting for sociodemographics, childhood
adversities, substance abuse/dependence, depression/anxiety, and chronic pain, those with schizophrenia had 6 times the odds
(OR = 6.47) of attempting suicide. Among persons with schizophrenia, suicide attempts were associated with female gender (OR =
4.59), substance abuse/dependence (OR = 6.31), depression (OR = 4.93), and childhood physical abuse (OR = 5.75). Community-
dwelling persons with schizophrenia appear to be at high risk for suicide attempts.
1. Introduction
In conjunction with the complexities and difficulties of the
symptoms of schizophrenia, individuals with schizophre-
nia are more likely to attempt suicide than those without
schizophrenia [1]. The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts
in those with schizophrenia ranges from 20% to 40% [2‚Äì6]. A
meta-analysis estimated that one in every 20 individuals with
schizophrenia will commit suicide [7]. The average age at sui-
cide is younger among those with schizophrenia than those
without the disorder [8]. It is unclear whether men or women
with schizophrenia are more likely to attempt suicide with
some sources stating that men and women are equally likely
[9] while others indicate that women with schizophrenia are
more likely to attempt suicide as compared to men with
schizophrenia [10]. As will be elaborated below, the direct
relationship between schizophrenia and suicide attempts may
be attenuated when adjusting for several factors including
socioeconomic status, pain, substance use, depression, anx-
iety, and early adversities.
The evidence concerning the relationship between schiz-
ophrenia and socioeconomic status (SES) is mixed [11].
Some studies have demonstrated that growing up in a
low income home is associated with increased rates of
schizophrenia [12, 13]. In contrast, other studies report an
association between growing up in a higher income home
and increased rates of schizophrenia [11, 14]. Higher levels
of education have been associated with a greater likelihood
of suicide completion among those with schizophrenia [15].
The association between social class and suicide completion
amongst those with schizophrenia is inconclusive with some
studies indicating high social class as a risk factor, while
others find homelessness as a risk factor [15].
It is well documented that individuals with schizophrenia
experience pain differently compared to the general popula-
tion [16, 17]. A systematic review found that when there is a
clear medical cause for pain, individuals with schizophrenia
report a lower prevalence and intensity of pain as compared to
the general population [17]. Other studies, both experimental
and population-based, support the idea that individuals with
schizophrenia experience a decrease in pain sensitivity [16,
18].
A strong association between substance abuse disorders
and schizophrenia has been documented [19, 20]. Almost
half of Americans with schizophrenia have had some form of
substance abuse disorder [21]. A systematic review indicated
that for individuals with schizophrenia, alcohol and drug
misuse increased the risk of suicide [15].

Schizophrenia Research and Treatment
Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common among
individuals with schizophrenia [15, 22, 23]. It is estimated
that approximately 50% of individuals with schizophrenia
also experience comorbid depression [24]. As in the general
population, individuals with schizophrenia who experience
depressive symptoms have an increased risk of suicide [5, 15].
A recent systematic review estimated that one in ten (9.8%) of
those with schizophrenia had Generalized Anxiety Disorder
(GAD) [23]. In the schizophrenia population, individuals
with a concurrent social anxiety disorder are more likely
to have attempted suicide and to have a greater lethality of
suicide attempts than those with schizophrenia without an
anxiety disorder [25]. In addition, suicide among those with
schizophrenia seems to be less likely a reaction to life events
as compared to those without schizophrenia [26].
Early physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as
neglect, have been associated with the development of adult
onset psychosis and schizophrenia [27‚Äì29]. In a systematic
review, childhood adversity was indicated as a risk factor for
the development of schizophrenia as compared to nonpsychi-
atric populations [28]. Physical and emotional abuse in child-
hood are also significantly associated with the development of
disassociation symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and
psychotic disorders [29]. Patients with schizophrenia who
have a history of child maltreatment can experience worse
peer relationships, difficulties in school, and more hospital
visits at younger ages than those with schizophrenia without
a history of child maltreatment [30]. Possibly because of
these issues, those with schizophrenia who were maltreated in
childhood are more likely than individuals without a history
of maltreatment to express intentions of suicide and report
depressive symptoms [30]. Childhood trauma in individuals
with schizophrenia is associated with an increase in suicide
attempts [31, 32], which is similar to findings of studies of the
general population [33].
There are several gaps in the current literature. Most stud-
ies attempt to understand the relationship between suicidal
behaviors and schizophrenia using clinical samples [4, 31,
34, 35]. Studies using representative samples of community
dwellers are important too because they can provide informa-
tion about individuals with schizophrenia who are relatively
high functioning, rather than focusing only on those who are
institutionalized and tend to be at the more extreme end of the
illness continuum. However, the few population-based stud-
ies that do exist often use data from outside of North America
[36, 37]. One Canadian population-based study found that
schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of suicide,
particularly within the first 90 days of diagnosis [38]. An
increased risk of suicide in those with schizophrenia has also
been demonstrated immediately after discharge from hospi-
tals [39].
A few population-based studies have been conducted
with those diagnosed with schizophrenia outside of North
America. For example, a Danish cohort study found that low
birth weight, low IQ, and low socioeconomic status are asso-
ciated with the development of psychiatric illnesses as well as
drug and alcohol abuse in men later in life [40]. This drug
and alcohol abuse was related to poorer survival rates [40].
A population-based study in Denmark found that younger
people (<35) were most at risk for suicide as compared to
other age categories [41]. This was true for both genders [41].
A Swedish population-based study concerning violent behav-
ior and suicide indicated that, for men, alcohol use, drug
use, previous self-harm, and previous violent offenses all
increased suicide risk [42]. For women, self-harm was found
to be associated with an increased suicide risk [42].
Another gap in the literature is that most studies analyze
suicide risk, suicidal ideation, or suicide in general [1, 15, 43]
and, thus, there is less known about suicide attempts, which
are strongly associated with both future attempts and com-
pleted suicides [1, 3, 34]. To our knowledge, no studies have
examined the role of witnessing parental domestic violence
and its relationship to schizophrenia and suicide attempts. As
witnessing domestic violence has been associated with several
negative outcomes in adults, research to better understand its
role and relationship to schizophrenia and suicide attempts
is needed [44]. Our hypotheses are as follows: (1) noninsti-
tutionalized people with schizophrenia will have higher odds
of suicide attempts than those without the disorder, and this
association will be partially attenuated when adverse child-
hood experiences, sociodemographics, and mental health
and substance abuse are accounted for in the analysis and (2)
among community-dwellers with schizophrenia the odds of
suicide attempts will be associated with each of the three types
of childhood adversity (childhood physical abuse, childhood
sexual abuse, and witnessing parental domestic violence),
substance abuse, depression, and anxiety disorders.
2. Methods
Data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-
Mental Health (CCHS-MH) were analyzed in the current
study. The CCHS-MH is a cross-sectional survey that collects
information about the factors, influences, and processes
that contribute to mental health through a multidisciplinary
approach focusing on health, social, and economic determi-
nants [45]. While the survey covers the population of individ-
uals at age of 15 and older living in the 10 provinces, residents
of the three territories, those living on reserves or other abo-
riginal settlements, full-time members of the armed forces,
and the institutionalized population were excluded. The latter
groups represent less than 3% of the target population [45].
2.1. Sample. Respondents for the CCHS-MH were sampled
using a three-stage design, which began with selecting indi-
viduals from geographical areas and then households within
each geographical area. Out of all eligible respondents, one
individual within each household was randomly selected
according to varying selection probabilities [45]. Based on
the selected units, 36,443 were in-scope for the survey and, of
these, 29,088 households agreed to participate in the survey,
resulting in an overall household-level response rate of 79.8%.
From responding households, 29,088 persons were selected to
participate and 25,113 provided a valid questionnaire, which
yielded an overall person-level response rate of 86.3%. At the
national level, these figures result in a combined response rate
of 68.9%.

The analysis for the current study is based on two subsam-
ples of the full CCHS-MH. More specifically, the first analysis
was restricted to those with complete data on each of the mea-
sures in the analyses (ùëõ = 21,744). It only contains respon-
dents at age of 20 and older because younger respondents
were not asked questions about adverse childhood experi-
ences. The second analysis was a subsample of the first analy-
sis restricted to respondents who reported that they had been
diagnosed with schizophrenia (ùëõ = 101).
2.2. Measures. Schizophrenia was assessed based upon a list
of ‚Äúconditions diagnosed by a health professional that are
expected to last or have already lasted 6 months or more.‚Äù
Those with a positive response to the question ‚Äúdo you have
schizophrenia?‚Äù were coded as such.
Suicide attempt was ascertained by a positive response to
the question: Have you ever ‚Äúattempted suicide or tried to
take your own life?‚Äù The questions were found in a section of
the CCHS-MH that focuses specifically on suicide and begin-
ning with a statement that ‚Äúthe questions may be sensitive
to some people, but we have to ask the same questions of
everyone.‚Äù
Sociodemographic variables include gender, self-identified
race (nonaboriginal White versus visible minority and/or
aboriginal), age (in decades), and Socioeconomic Position
(SEP) measured by the highest level of achieved education
(less than high school, high school graduate, some postsec-
ondary school, postsecondary diploma, or university degree).
Statistics Canada‚Äôs measure of household income as a ratio
related to the national low-income cut-off, divided into
deciles, was also used to assess SEP. This variable takes into
account the number of people in the household and the size
of the community.
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) included the fol-
lowing.
(i) Witnessing Parental Domestic Violence (PDV). Individuals
were determined as having been exposed to intimate partner
violence if they reported they had seen or heard 11 or more
times one of their ‚Äúparents, step-parents, or guardians hit each
other or another adult‚Äù aged 18 or over in their home.
(ii) Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA). Childhood sexual abuse
was measured by the question ‚ÄúHow many times did an adult
force you or attempt to force you into any unwanted sexual
activity, by threatening you, holding you down, or hurting
you in some way?‚Äù This variable was coded never versus ever.
(iii) Childhood Physical Abuse (CPA). Individuals were ascer-
tained as having been physically abused if they reported that,
before they reached the age of 16, an adult had at least once
kicked, bit, punch, choked, burned, or physically attacked
them.
Mental health factors include lifetime anxiety and depres-
sion. Individuals were coded as having an anxiety disorder
if they met the WHO-CIDI lifetime criteria for Generalized
Anxiety Disorder. Similarly, respondents were ascertained as
a depressive disorder if they met the WHO-CIDI lifetime
criteria for Major Depressive Episode. For more details please
see [45].
Chronic pain was assessed in a section of the survey focus-
ing on pain and discomfort that began with the following
statement: the next set of questions asks about the level of
pain or discomfort you usually experience. They are not about
illnesses like colds that affect people for short periods of time.
Respondents were determined to be regularly in pain if they
responded no to the question ‚ÄúAre you usually free of pain or
discomfort?‚Äù
Substance abuse was measured based on the WHO-CIDI
using a combination of the derived variables created by
Statistics Canada ‚ÄúDrug Abuse or Dependence (including
Cannabis)‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlcohol Abuse or Dependence.‚Äù Both were
derived using the lifetime algorithm. For more information,
please see the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
mental health derived variable specifications [45].
2.3. Statistical Analyses. The lifetime prevalence of suicide
attempts among those with schizophrenia was calculated in
SPSS 22. Chi-square analysis was conducted to examine gen-
der difference in the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts
among those with and without schizophrenia. Two series of
logistic regression analyses were conducted. In the first series
of analyses, the outcome was lifetime suicide attempt and the
key exposure variable was schizophrenia status. The goals of
the analyses were to document the odds of suicide attempts
among those with schizophrenia in comparison to those
without and to calculate the degree to which inclusion of the
potentially confounding factors attenuated the relationship.
Age, race, income, and education were controlled for in the
first model and each subsequent model. The second and
third model adjusted for three early adversities (witnessing
parental domestic violence, being physically abused, and
being sexually abused as a child) and chronic pain, respec-
tively. The fourth model controlled for drug and alcohol
abuse. The fifth model accounted for lifetime depression and
anxiety disorders. The sixth and final model controlled for all
the above-named factors simultaneously.
A second series of logistic regression analyses was com-
pleted using the subsample of those diagnosed with schizo-
phrenia (ùëõ = 101). The first model controlled for childhood
adversities only, the next adjusted for gender and substance
abuse/dependence, and a third accounted for mental health
factors. A final model controlled for all the above-named
variables simultaneously. Data from all the analyses were
weighted to adjust for the probability of selection and nonre-
sponse. Sample sizes are reported in their unweighted form.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported.
3. Results
In our population-based sample of noninstitutionalized
Canadians, the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts among
those with schizophrenia was 39.2% compared to 2.8% of
individuals without schizophrenia. One-third of males (33%)
with schizophrenia had attempted suicide in contrast to 2.2%
 4
Schizophrenia Research and Treatment
of males without schizophrenia (ùëù < 0.001). Almost half of
women (47.3%) with schizophrenia had attempted suicide in
comparison to 3.5% of women without schizophrenia (ùëù <
0.001).
When the data were adjusted for age, race, income, and
education, noninstitutionalized individuals with schizophre-
nia had 15 times the odds of attempting suicide (OR:
15.74, 95% CI = 9.84, 25.2) in comparison to those without
schizophrenia (please see Table 1). We conducted a series of
logistic regression analyses all of which included the above
variables in addition to several different clusters of risk factors
that we anticipated would attenuate the association between
schizophrenia and suicide attempts. When three early adver-
sities (witnessing parental domestic violence, being physically
abused, and being sexually abused as a child) were added to
the equation, the odds of suicide attempts among those with
schizophrenia declined to 12.92 (OR: 12.92, 95% CI = 7.96,
21.753). When drug and alcohol abuse were included, people
with schizophrenia still had 13 times the odds (OR: 13.06)
of attempting suicide as compared to individuals without
schizophrenia. When pain was added to the sociodemo-
graphic variables, people with schizophrenia had 14.5 times
the odds of attempting suicide (OR: 14.5, CI = 8.91, 23.74).
The greatest attenuation in the schizophrenia-suicide attempt
association was due to the inclusion of lifetime depression
and anxiety disorders. Inclusion of these mental health
characteristics reduced the odds of suicide attempts among
those with schizophrenia to 7.22 (95% CI = 4.22‚Äì12.36). After
adjusting for all of the factors discussed above, individuals
with schizophrenia had 6 times the odds (OR: 6.47) of
attempting to suicide as compared to individuals who did
not have schizophrenia. Among the variables controlled for,
mental health factors explained the largest share of the rela-
tionship between schizophrenia and suicide attempts at 58%,
followed by childhood adversities at 20% and substance use
at 18%. All the factors together accounted for 63% of the
association.
In order to identify the key factors associated with suicide
attempts among those with schizophrenia, we conducted
additional analyses restricted to the 101 respondents in the
CCHS-MH data set who reported that they had been diag-
nosed with schizophrenia by a medical professional (please
see Table 2). In a model adjusting for all variables simulta-
neously, we found that suicide attempts were associated with
female gender (OR = 4.59), substance dependence (OR =
6.31), depression (OR = 4.93), and a history of physical abuse
in childhood (OR = 5.75). When only early adversities were
included, exposure to chronic parental domestic violence was
associated with almost 7 times the odds of suicide attempts
(OR = 6.95). After adjustments for gender, substance abuse,
and depression and anxiety, this number decreased to non-
significance (OR: 2.58, 95% CI = 0.65, 10.30). Among those
with schizophrenia, early adversity accounted for 24% of the
variability in suicide attempts (Nagelkerke ùëÖ2 = 0.24). When
gender, drug and alcohol abuse, and lifetime anxiety and
depressive disorders were added to the analysis, 38% of the
variability in suicide attempts was accounted for (Nagelkerke
ùëÖ2 = 0.38).
4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
between suicide attempts and schizophrenia using rep-
resentative community-based data. In individuals with
schizophrenia, 39.2% had attempted suicide as compared to
2.8% of individuals without schizophrenia. Previous studies
have estimated the prevalence of suicide attempts in indi-
viduals with schizophrenia to range from 20 to 40% [2‚Äì6].
Although the percentage of individuals with schizophrenia
who attempted suicide fell between previously estimated
rates, it was theorized that, with population-based data
of noninstitutionalized individuals, these numbers would
be lower than in studies using clinical samples. The data
suggest, however, that rates of suicide attempts in those with
schizophrenia living within the community may be similar to
those found in clinical settings.
We found that the odds of suicide attempt were over 6
times higher among those with schizophrenia compared to
those without, even when accounting for lifetime depression
and anxiety disorders, substance use, childhood adversities,
pain, and sociodemographics. Among the latter factors,
depression and anxiety explained the largest share of the rela-
tionship between schizophrenia and suicide attempts, which
is consistent with research showing that as much as half of
individuals with schizophrenia suffer from depressive symp-
toms and that these symptoms are associated with an increase
in suicide attempts [5, 15, 24]. Among those with schizophre-
nia, we found that depression was associated with 7 times the
odds of a suicide attempt and that depression and anxiety
together explained 17.5% of the variability in suicide attempts.
These findings suggest that it is important for health care
professionals working in the community to be aware of the
need to assess for the presence of other mental health prob-
lems alongside the symptoms of schizophrenia. Developing
best practices to support individuals who are experiencing
schizophrenia comorbid with other mental health conditions
could help decrease the prevalence of suicide attempts among
those living in the community.
Interestingly, in the fully adjusted model, those with an
anxiety disorder were 69% less likely to attempt suicide. Rapp
et al. [46] found that individuals with schizophrenia who also
had anxiety demonstrated higher verbal IQ, better problem
solving, attention, and verbal fluency. Possessing these qual-
ities might indicate that individuals with both schizophrenia
and anxiety may be more likely to have the necessary skills
to express themselves verbally and communicate with those
around them should they be experiencing suicidal ideation,
increasing the chances of a successful intervention. More
research is required to understand the differences in charac-
teristics between those with schizophrenia with an anxiety
disorder and those with schizophrenia without an anxiety
disorder.
In the general population, women are more likely to
attempt suicide than men [47]. Some research has also identi-
fied this trend for women with schizophrenia [10], which is in
keeping with what we found in our data. When only sociode-
mographics and substance abuse history were included in the
analysis, women‚Äôs odds of suicide attempts were elevated

but failed to reach statistical significance (OR = 2.13; 95%
CI = 0.91, 4.98). However, these odds increased and became
statistically significant when histories of depressive disorders
and anxiety disorders were included (OR = 3.10; 95% CI = 1.19,
8.04). In the final model we were surprised by the magnitude
of the association in our sample: women with schizophrenia
had four times the odds of suicide attempts compared to men
with schizophrenia when adjustments were made for adverse
childhood experiences, sociodemographics, substance abuse,
depression, and anxiety disorder (OR = 4.59; 95% CI =
1.21, 17.35). It appears that women with schizophrenia are
particularly at risk, even independent of these comorbid
conditions. One potential factor to explain this is that females
with schizophrenia tend to present with symptoms later than
males [10, 47], and individuals with later onset schizophrenia
have been shown to have an increased risk of suicide [48, 49].
Among those with schizophrenia, 24% of the variability in
suicide attempts was explained by a history of early adversity.
When only early adversities were used to predict suicide
attempts among those with schizophrenia, those who had
been exposed to chronic parental domestic violence had
approximately seven times the odds of attempting suicide.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
role of exposure to parental domestic violence in those with
schizophrenia and its relationship to suicide attempts. Our
findings are in keeping with data from the general popula-
tion which has shown that individuals who are exposed to
parental domestic violence have an increased risk of suicide

attempts [50]. Childhood physical abuse was associated with
2.66 higher odds of suicide in those with schizophrenia;
however, it only reached borderline significance (model 1:
ùëù < 0.065). After adjustments for demographics, substance
abuse, and history of depression and anxiety disorders, the
relationship between parental domestic violence and suicide
attempts decreased to nonsignificance but childhood physical
abuse reached statistical signficance. Our findings are in
contrast to a recent clinical study of suicide attempts before
and after first episode of schizophrenia which found no
association between childhood traumas and suicide attempts
[51]. There were numerous design differences between Togay
et al.‚Äôs study [51] and this study which may have led to the
different findings including source of sample (clinical sample
of first episode clients versus representative population-based
study), study location (Turkey versus Canada), period of sui-
cide attempts (average of 5 years after first episode versus life-
time), and different measures of early adversities (combined
measure of 5 types of abuse using a standardized scale versus
separate inclusion of 3 specific types of childhood adversi-
ties). Physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect, and wit-
nessing parental domestic violence have been associated with
an increased risk in suicide attempts in the general population
[31, 32]. In our Canadian study, early childhood adversities
explained a large portion of the variability in suicide attempts
among those with schizophrenia. These findings reinforce the
need to develop targeted programs for individuals with schiz-
ophrenia who have experienced early childhood abuse [31,
32].
In the fully adjusted model, substance abuse/dependence
was associated with 6 times the odds of suicide attempts
among those with schizophrenia. Both in the general pop-
ulation and in the schizophrenia literature drug abuse and
addictions have been associated with increased risk of
suicide attempts [19, 20, 52, 53]. Interestingly, substance
abuse/dependence explained just 7% of the variation in sui-
cide attempts. A potential explanation for the finding rests in
exploring the self-medication hypothesis [54]. It is theorized
that part of the reason individuals with schizophrenia have
such high rates of substance abuse is that they try to alleviate
the pain and suffering they feel as a result of the symptoms
of schizophrenia by using substances [54, 55]. It is possible
that, due to our use of population-based data of noninstitu-
tionalized individuals, our sample may not be experiencing
the same level of intensity of symptoms as one would see in a
clinical sample and, thus, is less likely to be using substances
to cope and, subsequently, turn to attempting suicide.
There are a several limitations present in this study. It is
possible that recall bias may have occurred considering the
retrospective nature of reporting suicide attempts as well as
early adversities. There has been a lack of research aimed at
establishing the validity and reliability of self-report measures
related to suicide attempts [56]. In the general population,
the evidence concerning the validity and reliability of retro-
spective reporting of child maltreatment is mixed, with some
studies finding the self-reports an accurate way of assessing
child maltreatment [57], while others are finding significant
instability in retrospective reports of child maltreatment [58].
In individuals with schizophrenia, concerns about memory
and cognition could be cited as a potential challenge to relying
on self-report data [59]. Although slower recall and deficits
in recalling emotion laden memories have been reported in
individuals with schizophrenia, most of these studies have
relied on clinical samples, thus potentially skewing the under-
standing of memory deficits in those with schizophrenia [60‚Äì
62]. Other research has found good validity in self-report
measures of childhood abuse among patients with mental
disorders [63]. There are some potential risk factors for sui-
cide attempts in individuals with schizophrenia that were not
included in our analysis. These include insight into disease,
poor adherence to treatment, schizophrenia symptom profile,
housing conditions, marital status, and living alone. The
absence of these important potential confounds could have
biased our findings.
Questions have also been raised as to whether self-report
of a medical diagnosis of schizophrenia is a reasonable
method to assess the presence or absence of this condition.
Self-reports of a medical diagnosis of schizophrenia are a
prominent technique used in large, population-based data
sets [64]. The prevalence of schizophrenia based on self-
report of a medical diagnosis in the current sample was
in keeping with the systematic review by Saha and col-
leagues [65] which estimated that the lifetime prevalence of
schizophrenia was approximately 0.44%. However, alterna-
tive techniques for assessing schizophrenia status, such as
screening tools and self-report measures, also carry the risk
of missing cases of psychiatric illnesses [66]. There is particu-
larly the potential for missing those with negative symptoms
[66, 67]. In a previous study using an earlier wave of the
CCHS, self-report of a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia
was found to be a reasonable way to assess the existence of
schizophrenia [64]. There have been few studies examining
this phenomenon, and it has been suggested that more
research is to be conducted using diagnostic interviewing
as a comparison to produce better, more reliable data [64].
Although the overall response rate of 68.9% was quite good
for a large population-based survey, it is possible that those
with schizophrenia, particularly those with more severe
symptoms, may be less likely to participate in a survey such as
this. If the most severe cases are most likely to have had sui-
cide attempts, it is likely that such an underrepresentation of
these individuals would result in our analyses underestimat-
ing the magnitude of the relationship between schizophrenia
and suicide attempts. Additionally, it is possible that the
question ‚ÄúHow many times did an adult force you or attempt
to force you into any unwanted sexual activity, by threatening
you, holding you down, or hurting you in some way?‚Äù does
not adequately capture all types of sexual abuse, specifically
forms that would be subtler in nature. Consequently, our
study might underestimate the history of sexual abuse.
Our nationally representative sample suggests noninsti-
tutionalized individuals with schizophrenia are 6 times more
likely than individuals without schizophrenia to attempt
suicide. The presence of depressive symptoms, as well as early
childhood adversities, played significant roles in explaining
the high rates of suicide within the schizophrenia population.
With this information, it is important to recognize that indi-
viduals who are experiencing psychosis are also vulnerable

to other serious mental health issues, which are related to
suicide attempts. This, alongside targeted programs for those
with schizophrenia who have experienced early adversity,
could help reduce the suicide attempts by individuals with
schizophrenia living in the community.
