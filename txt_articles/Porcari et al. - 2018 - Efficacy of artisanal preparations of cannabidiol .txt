Medically refractory epilepsy continues to be a challenge worldwide, and despite an increasing number of
medical therapies, approximately 1 in 3 patients continues to have seizures. Cannabidiol (CBD), one of many con-
stituents of the Cannabis sativa or marijuana plant, has received renewed interest in the treatment of epilepsy.
While highly purified CBD awaits Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, artisanal formulations of CBD
are readily available and are seeing increased use in our patient population. Although randomized controlled tri-
als of CBD are ongoing and promising, data regarding artisanal formulations of CBD are minimal and largely an-
ecdotal. Here, we report a retrospective study to define the efficacy of artisanal CBD preparations in children with
epilepsy. Given the known interaction between CBD and clobazam, we also conducted a subgroup comparison to
determine if clobazam use was related to any beneficial effects of CBD. Additionally, we compared response rates
with CBD and with clobazam alone within an overlapping patient cohort. A pediatric cohort with epilepsy of 108
patients was identified through a medical record search for patients using CBD oil. The addition of CBD resulted in
39% of patients having a N50% reduction in seizures, with 10% becoming seizure-free. The responder rate for
clobazam was similar. No patients achieved CBD monotherapy, although the weaning of other antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) became possible in 22% of patients. A comparable proportion had AED additions during CBD ther-
apy. With concomitant use of clobazam, 44% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizures upon addition of CBD
compared with 33% in the population not taking clobazam; this difference was not statistically significant. The
most common reported side effect of CBD was sedation in less than 4% of patients, all of whom were also taking
clobazam. Increased alertness and improved verbal interactions were reported in 14% of patients in the CBD
group and 8% of patients in the CBD and clobazam group. Benefits were more marked in the CBD alone group,
in contrast to the CBD and clobazam group, but this difference was not statistically significant. In summary,
these findings support efficacy of artisanal CBD preparations in seizure reduction with few significant side effects.
The response to CBD was independent of concurrent clobazam use, although clobazam may contribute to the se-
dation seen with concurrent CBD use.

1. Introduction
Despite continued development of new medications for the treat-
ment of epilepsy, nearly 1 in 3 patients remain drug-resistant [1,2].
While research into novel treatments of epilepsy is ongoing, we have
not yet achieved the goal of “no seizures, no side effects.”
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of
medical marijuana, or more specifically, cannabidiol (CBD)-containing
products in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. Greater
than 400 distinct chemical entities can be found in Cannabis s., including
over 60 cannabinoid compounds [3]. As has been reviewed extensively
by others, the pharmacology of individual cannabinoids is complex,
with multiple pharmacologic targets independent of the cannabinoid
1 or cannabinoid 2 receptors [4]. As such, a treatment with multiple
mechanisms of action may prove to be more effective than that of its
constituents in isolation. Cannabis-derived products have been used
medicinally since at least 2700 BCE by the Chinese and were part of
the pharmacopeia in the United States into the 1930s [5].
Excitement regarding the efficacy of CBD in the treatment of epilepsy
has grown in large part because of reports of almost miraculous suc-
cesses by the lay media. While far from being a miracle cure, published

 data increasingly suggest that CBD may be efficacious for the treatment
of epilepsy. However, concerns for bias remain. A notable study from
Colorado, one of the first states to legalize CBD oil for epilepsy treatment,
utilized surveys of patient caregivers. The responder rate was reported to
be 22% in patients originally from Colorado compared with 47% in
patients whose families had moved to the state in order to benefit
from CBD oil, a difference which suggests a reporting bias [6]. However,
recently published randomized controlled trials of a highly purified
pharmaceutical-grade CBD demonstrated efficacy in both Lennox–
Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and Dravet Syndrome, lending support for
efficacy in drug-resistant epilepsy [7,8].
In May of 2015, as part of an amendment to TN state law 39-17-402,
the State of Tennessee made legal the possession of CBD oil containing
less than 0.9% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for the treatment of epilepsy.
This local legalization has led to a rapid increase in both patient inquiries
regarding CBD oil and in the use of CBD-containing products by patients,
with and without prior consultation with their physicians. Given the lack
of high quality double-blind randomized controlled trials for artisanal
CBD preparations, studies which are unlikely to occur, we sought to
determine the efficacy of artisanal CBD preparations in our cohort of
patients with epilepsy. The hypothesis was that patients with drug-resis-
tant epilepsy would see a reduction in both seizure frequency and in
either number or overall dose of standard antiepileptic medications
with the addition of CBD-containing products. In addition, given the re-
ported interaction with clobazam, a subgroup analysis was performed
comparing response rate of those also taking clobazam with those who
were not. Lastly, given the limitations of a retrospective study, we inves-
tigated the efficacy of clobazam alone in a similar patient cohort to
support the data collection methodology.
In this retrospective study, we report that artisanal CBD is helpful in
the treatment of medically refractory seizures.
2. Material and methods
Data were collected in a retrospective manner utilizing the Synthetic
Derivative at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from January 2006
through December of 2016. Patients using CBD oil were identified
using a keyword search for the terms: “cannabis”, “cannabinoid”,
“cannabidiol”, and “CBD oil”. Upon extraction, patient information was
deidentified and saved for group analysis upon completion of data col-
lection. The study was approved upon review by the Vanderbilt
University Institutional Review Board, IRB#161821.
From within the CBD-searched cohort, a subgroup of patients who
use clobazam in addition to CBD as an epilepsy treatment were identi-
fied to determine if an interaction between CBD and clobazam contrib-
uted to efficacy or side effects (Fig. 1). As validation of the data collection
methodology, we identified patients from within the CBD-searched
cohort who used clobazam prior to addition of CBD or clobazam alone.
This allowed us to assess the clobazam responder rate in a similar
cohort of patients. Baseline seizure frequency was determined from
the documented seizure frequency most proximal to the introduction
of the new agent with responses and side effects derived from clinical
documentation in the months following addition of the treatment,
often documented in the next clinic visit.
Documented response to CBD or clobazam was organized into 7
categories: seizure-free, N75% seizure reduction, N50% but b75% seizure
reduction, b50% seizure reduction or subjective improvement, transient
response (better initially, followed by no response/worsening), no
benefit, and worsening of seizures. Responders were defined as patients
with N50% reduction in seizure frequency. We excluded 6 and 12
patients from the CBD and clobazam groups, respectively, because of
inadequate documentation of seizure frequency, treatment response,
or to being lost to follow-up.
Numeric results were compared using Student's t-test. Categorical
data were compared using z-test and with logistic regression
analysis. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (STD) or as
number (%).
3. Results
To determine the efficacy of artisanal CBD-containing products in the
treatment of medically refractory epilepsy, we utilized the Vanderbilt
Synthetic Derivative to identify a total of 329 charts where CBD was
documented out of 3,652,459. We identified 210 patients, who were

 age 18 years and below, 110 of which were taking CBD oil. Of these, 108
patients were documented as taking CBD oil for epilepsy, which
constituted the pediatric study cohort, and 2 for nonepilepsy reasons
(Table 1). In the vast majority of the remaining patients, CBD use for ep-
ilepsy was discussed and documented in the medical record, but the pa-
tient had not yet started treatment. When documented, reasons for not
taking CBD oil included the following: patient planned to but had yet
to start, excessive cost, patient was not medically refractory, and concern
for medication interactions. Two patients from this group were moving
or had recently moved to Colorado specifically for CBD therapy.
In the adult cohort, age 19 years and above, 118 patients were iden-
tified, of whom 64 were actively taking CBD-containing products. In
contrast to the pediatric cohort where over 98% of children were taking
CBD for epilepsy, only 39% of adults were taking CBD for epilepsy
(Table 1). Pain was the second most common reason for use and reported
in 20% of adults, followed by a broad range of indications, predominantly
neurologic and psychiatric in nature. Given the relatively low proportion
of adults using CBD for epilepsy specifically, our subsequent analysis
focuses only on the pediatric cohort.
We hypothesized that a clobazam cohort, obtained from patients
who had either discussed CBD or who were on clobazam prior to
starting CBD, would serve as an appropriate comparison group based
on our observations that CBD was predominately used in patients
with drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy, many of whom were also on
clobazam. Indeed, significant differences between groups were minimal
(Table 2). Together, structural and genetic etiologies accounted for 70%
of the epilepsy overall. Greater than 58% of patients in both cohorts had
abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although a significantly
higher number of charts in the CBD + clobazam cohort lacked docu-
mented MRI or reports when compared with the clobazam cohort.
Over 93% of electroencephalogram (EEG)s were abnormal across all
groups, with 20% consistent with an epileptic encephalopathy in the
clobazam group and 17% and 31% in the CBD and CBD + clobazam
groups, respectively. Focal seizures were the most common seizure
type in all groups, occurring in greater than 28% of patients. Multiple sei-
zure types were seen in greater than 17% of patients in all groups. Tonic
seizures were reported more frequently in the clobazam group than in
the CBD groups, likely due in part to a significantly greater representa-
tion of LGS in both the clobazam and CBD + clobazam groups versus
the CBD group. Average age of epilepsy onset, 3 years, in the CBD
group was significantly older than average age of onset in both the
CBD and clobazam and clobazam alone groups. The clobazam cohort
tended to have a greater incidence of treatment with a vagus nerve stim-
ulator (VNS), while exposure to diet therapy was not significantly differ-
ent between groups. The ketogenic diet was by far the most frequently
used diet therapy. Cannabidiol + clobazam and clobazam groups both
demonstrated greater numbers of patients with prior epilepsy surgery
in comparison with none in the CBD group.
Baseline seizure frequency averaged 89/month with a range from 0
to 675 seizures/month in the CBD group, 372/month with a range of
0.33 to 4680/month in the CBD and clobazam group, and 437/month
with a range from 0.25 to 10,800 seizures/month in the clobazam
group (Supplemental Fig. 1). Following addition of CBD or clobazam,
33% of the CBD group, 44% of the CBD + clobazam group, and 38% of
the clobazam group had a N50% reduction in seizure frequency. No sei-
zures were reported at follow-up in 14% of the CBD group, 9% of CBD
+ clobazam group, and in 11% of the clobazam group (Fig. 2). A small
or subjective improvement was reported in an additional 13% of pa-
tients upon addition of CBD. No change in seizure frequency was report-
ed in 33% of CBD, 37% of CBD and clobazam, and 26% of clobazam
patients. Sixteen percent of patients had increased seizures following
addition of clobazam, significantly higher than 4% in the CBD
+ clobazam group, but was not significantly different than the 6%
seen in the CBD group. Cannabidiol was added despite seizure freedom
at the time of addition in 10% of the CBD group.
Examination of responder rate by electroclinical syndrome was
complicated by a small N in many groups. In LGS, the most commonly
noted syndrome in all cohorts, responder rate was 58% with CBD, 52%
with CBD and clobazam, and 40% with clobazam alone. In patients
who could not be classified into a clearly defined electroclinical
syndrome, responder rate was 31% for CBD and 40% for both CBD and
clobazam and clobazam alone.
Alternative markers of efficacy may include the ability to wean
medications or other epilepsy therapies or may be suggested by
whether the patient is still taking the medication. Duration of treatment
may also be a marker of efficacy under the assumption that if a medica-
tion is working, it will be continued. On average, patients had been
treated with greater than 5 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prior to addition
of CBD or clobazam. Following addition of CBD or clobazam, no patients
were able to wean all other medications resulting in CBD or clobazam
monotherapy. Medication reduction was seen in 21% of CBD, 26% CBD
+ clobazam patients, and 18% of clobazam patients following addition of
CBD or clobazam (Fig. 2). Increased doses or addition of other AEDs were
seen in 15% of CBD, in 17% of CBD and clobazam patients, and 7% of
clobazam patients, values which were not statistically different. Overall,
19–33% of patients in all groups had AED reductions and additions during
treatment, reflecting the fluid nature of epilepsy management.
Duration of treatment was significantly longer in the clobazam
group with an average of 2.5 years vs 1.1 and 1.3 years in the CBD and
CBD + clobazam groups, respectively (Table 3). As duration of therapy
may be confounded by the time the treatment became available, we
also investigated the rate of continuation. On average, 71% of patients
were still taking CBD with a rate of continuation not significantly
different from 77% in the clobazam cohort. The most common reason
for stopping CBD was no benefit, whereas side effects were the most
common reason for stopping clobazam. Sedation was the most common
side effect and was significantly more frequent in the clobazam group,
reported in 36% of patients in the group versus 7% of patients in the
CBD and clobazam group and 0% of patients in the CBD group.
Treatment changes made at the time of addition of CBD or clobazam
could confound interpretation of treatment response and were also
investigated. While significantly more treatment changes were made
at the time of clobazam initiation compared with CBD initiation, a nearly
equal number of treatments were added as were removed (Table 3).
Cannabidiol has anecdotally been reported to have myriad benefits
in addition to improving seizure control [9]. Increased alertness,
improved verbal communication, better social interaction, and better
mood were the most commonly reported beneficial side effects
(Table 3). Increased alertness and improved verbal skills were reported
more frequently with CBD than with CBD and clobazam, although this
was not significantly different. Improved alertness was also reported
with the addition of clobazam.
Artisanal CBD is available from multiple companies as evident from
the use of 10 different CBD products in our cohort (Fig. 3). The origin

 of CBD was not documented in 26% of patients. Dosing in milligrams/
kilogram (mg/kg) could be determined in most cases, with the average
CBD dose of 2.9 mg/kg/day in the CBD group and 5.8 mg/kg/day
in the CBD and clobazam group. Doses ranged widely, from 0.018
to 50 mg/kg/day. In approximately 10% of total CBD patients, only
the volume of oil per dose was documented, with the dose unknown
or undocumented in 6.3% of the CBD group and 20% of the CBD
+ clobazam group (Table 3). Average daily clobazam dose was 1.5
± 1.4 mg/kg/day.
4. Discussion
Given the surge of interest and use of artisanal CBD-containing
products by patients for the adjunctive or primary treatment of epilepsy,
we set out to determine the efficacy of such products within a pediatric
population with epilepsy. Consistent with other studies, our retrospec-
tive study suggests that artisanal CBD is helpful in the treatment of med-
ically refractory epilepsy [10] with benefits that cannot be credited to
interaction with clobazam and increased levels of its active metabolite.
These data add additional support for the use of artisanal CBD in the
treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy as in our patient population. As
has recently been reported, outside of seizure control, CBD use was
also associated with increased alertness, improved verbal communica-
tion, better social interactions, and better mood, suggesting additional
benefits to use of CBD [9].
Prior to the recent randomized controlled trials for pharmaceutical
grade CBD, much of the data supporting the efficacy of artisanal CBD
have been in the form of parent-based surveys, with notable concern
for reporting bias [6,11]. Although some of these studies were designed
primarily to detail the real-world practice patterns of patients and
their families, the data have also been used to make the arguments for
efficacy and safety.
As with any retrospective study, our results may be confounded by
reporting bias, inconsistent follow-up intervals, and incomplete
documentation. Patients were being actively treated for drug-resistant
epilepsy, thus, additional interventions were added and removed at
the time CBD was started and throughout the treatment process,
potentially confounding efficacy results and limiting our ability to
draw long-term conclusions regarding efficacy. We cannot exclude
that results of efficacy for CBD-containing products include some degree
of parental bias or placebo effect. Indeed, even with severe epileptic
encephalopathies such as LGS, the placebo responder rate can range
from 10 to 30% [12]. Our inclusion of clobazam as a comparator and
our finding of a similar response rate in the clobazam and CBD groups
suggest that artisanal CBD can be of comparable benefit. Although we
cannot exclude potential bias owing to patient belief in a higher likeli-
hood of effect of CBD over clobazam given the retrospective nature of
this study, we do feel that these data are, nonetheless, accurate repre-
sentations of a population of patients that have drug-resistant pediatric
epilepsy. As blood CBD levels were not recorded in our patients, we can-
not verify the contents of the artisanal products used. However, the 10%
seizure-free rate and 33% responder rates presented here are quite sim-
ilar with the results from prior studies of artisanal CBD preparations in
patients from Colorado [6], Washington State, and California, providing
further support for efficacy of artisanal CBD products [13].
Additional confounds arise from variability in artisanal CBD prepara-
tions and incomplete and/or subjective bias in reporting of seizure fre-
quency, response to intervention, and side effects. Continued emphasis
on adoption of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice pa-
rameters will benefit future retrospective studies greatly [14].
Variability represents a key challenge and concern for the use of ar-
tisanal products for medical treatment of epilepsy, given the lack of both
regulation and verification of such products. This has previously been
demonstrated in a study of commercially available edible marijuana
products where THC content was shown to be mislabeled in 83% of
samples tested [15]. Cannabidiol content, when labeled, was mislabeled
in 100% of samples tested [15]. In contrast to the clobazam group, in
which doses were easily discerned in all patients, exact doses could
not be determined in over 25% of patients taking CBD, due to either a
lack of dose documentation overall or report of volumes administered
only. Cannabidiol was obtained through 10 different vendors with
source of CBD not documented in over 30% of patients. Even for patients

 whose exact dose was documented, this may or may not be accurate or
consistent because of limited regulation of artisanal products. A review
of consumer-facing marketing and shopping websites for different
vendors revealed a wide range of concentrations, pricing, and also dos-
ing advice provided by these companies (Table 4). A common theme
with many of the consumer-facing sites was lack of transparency re-
garding the exact manufacturing process for the CBD. Several compa-
nies purport to extract CBD from locally or, at times, internationally
grown Cannabis according to good manufacturing practice (GMP)
guidelines with third party certificates of analysis (COA) available,
while others appear to use purified CBD isolates from unidentified
wholesale manufacturers. Several companies are USA distributors for
international manufacturers. The absence of regulation creates the po-
tential for significant batch-to-batch variability in CBD concentration,
wide variations in non-CBD cannabinoid content, and potential product
impurities. This variability within and between artisanal products not
only complicates the interpretation of seizure-response rates but
also, more importantly, places patients at risk for inconsistent seizure
control.
These concerns are amplified when considered in the context of
studies evaluating generic formulations of seizure medications which
suggest that the 80 to 125% range of bioequivalence may be too broad
[16] and that transition to generic medications may increase seizure in-
cidence and medical resource utilization [17]. While some feel that the
concern regarding variability in generics is overstated [18], others rec-
ommend against switching between different generic formulations in
patients who have achieved good seizure control [19]. Thus, issues
with bottle to bottle, batch to batch, and strain to strain consistency
for a plant-based product used to treat severe epilepsy remain of great
concern.

 Despite an extensive history of cannabis use as a medication in China
back to 2700 BCE, in India in 1000 BCE, and in the US through the early
20th century, the medical use of cannabis was stunted in the US follow-
ing criminalization in the 30s [5]. Its use remains restricted because of
its status as a Schedule 1-controlled substance at the federal level, in
spite of pressure from states which have allowed legalization for both
medical and recreational use. Medical providers are tasked with using
the best evidence available in making treatment decisions, a process
which may put them at odds with family members who also want the
best for their loved ones and may favor expediency and hope over
evidence-based practice.
Given the inconsistency of the lay-information and the known drug–
drug interactions, in order to appropriately advise patients on artisanal
CBD use and side effect profile, it is critical for medical providers who
treat epilepsy to actively inquire into its use as an adjunctive treatment.
Taking a proactive approach is particularly relevant considering that
treatments patients consider to be herbal/natural remedies may be
underreported on medication lists [20]. While pharmaceutical grade
CBD may ultimately be FDA approved, the use of artisanal products
will very likely continue to expand because of biases against pharma-
ceutical products and artisanal product marketing which fosters the be-
lief that unpurified Cannabis extract will have additional health benefits
over pure CBD alone. Artisanal CBD will very likely have continued use
in patients with epilepsy. Medical providers cannot ignore its usage
and need to work with patients and their families to find the most
appropriate treatment for their epilepsy.
