O
ngoing pan-Canadian surveys such as 
the Canadian Community Health Survey 
(CCHS) and Canadian Health Measures 
Survey (CHMS) are important to evaluate the 
health of our population using representative 
national samples.1,2 Self-reported heights and 
weights replaced direct measurement during 
1978–2004, which underestimated true rates of 
overweight and obesity.3 A subsequent compari-
son of directly measured heights and weights 
during the same period showed an alarming 
increase in the prevalence of overweight or obe-
sity among Canadian children aged 2–17 years, 
from 23.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
20.5% to 26.0%) to 34.7% (95% CI 33.0% to 
36.4%) based on the new World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) definitions.1
In Canada, the definitions of overweight and 
obesity changed with the introduction of the 
2010 WHO growth charts for Canada.4,5 Previ-
ous definitions were based on body mass index 
(BMI) percentiles from the 2000 US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth 
charts.6 In addition to revising these percentile 
thresholds, the WHO charts were based on a dif-
ferent reference population; as a result, the pro-
portion of Canadian children classified as over-
weight or obese increased with the introduction 
of the new WHO charts.1,7,8 Moreover, the abso-
lute percentile thresholds now vary by age, with 
toddlers (2 to ≤ 5 yr) having higher thresholds to 
define overweight and obesity than older chil-
dren (age > 5 to 19 yr).4
Results from the United States have shown a 
decline in obesity rates among toddlers and a pla-
teau in rates among older children;9,10 stabilization 
has also been noted in other jurisdictions (e.g., 
Germany and Australia).11–16 We undertook this 
study to determine the most recent trends in the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity among

Background: Previous studies have shown an in-
crease in the prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity among Canadian children from 23.3% to 
34.7% during 1978–2004. We examined the 
most recent trends by applying current defini-
tions of overweight and obesity based on World 
Health Organization (WHO) body mass index 
(BMI) thresholds and recently validated norms 
for waist circumference and waist:height ratio.
Methods: We examined directly measured 
height and weight data from the Canadian 
Community Health Survey (2004–2005) and 
the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2009–
2013). We calculated z scores for BMI, height 
and weight based on the 2014 WHO growth 
charts for Canada, including the new exten-
sion of weight-for-age beyond 10 years. To 
calculate z scores for waist circumference and 
waist:height ratios, we used new charts from 
the reference population in the US NHANES III 
(National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey, 1988–1994).
Results: Data were available for 14 014 children 
aged 3–19 years for the period 2004–2013. We 
observed a decline in the prevalence of over-
weight or obesity, from 30.7% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 29.7% to 31.6%) to 27.0% (95% CI 
25.3% to 28.7%) (p < 0.001) and stabilization in 
the prevalence of obesity at about 13%. These 
trends persisted after we adjusted for age, sex 
and race/ethnicity. Although they declined, the 
median z scores for BMI, weight and height 
were positive and higher than those in the WHO 
reference population. The z scores for waist 
circumference and waist:height ratio were nega-
tive, which indicated that the Canadian children 
had less central adiposity than American children 
in historic or contemporary NHANES cohorts.
Interpretation: After a period of dramatic 
growth, BMI z scores and the prevalence of 
overweight or obesity among Canadian chil-
dren decreased from 2004 to 2013, which 
attests to progress against this important pub-
lic health challenge.

Canadian children using the current WHO weight 
charts for Canada applied to a representative sam-
ple of children.
Methods
Data sources
The CCHS (the result of a partnership between 
Health Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information and Statistics Canada) consists of a 
series of cross-sectional national surveys with the 
objective of providing timely information on 
health determinants, status and health system uti-
lization.17 The 2004/05 survey (cycle 2.2) was a 
nationally representative cross-sectional survey 
specifically designed to collect information about 
the nutritional status of the Canadian population 
aged 2–79 years, including directly measured 
heights and weights for almost 9000 children 
aged 3–19 years.18 The survey targeted the entire 
population except residents of the 3 territories, 
Indian reserves and military bases and had a re-
sponse rate of 76.5%.
Beginning in 2007, the annual CHMS mea-
sured height, weight and waist circumference of 
Canadian children aged 3–19 years.19,20 The tar-
get population included 96% of the Canadian 
population, excluding residents of Indian re-
serves, full-time members of the regular Can-
adian Forces, and residents in institutions and 
some remote regions. Of the households selected 
for the survey, 75.9% agreed to participate.
To permit detailed comparisons over time, we 
analyzed a decade of anthropometric data for chil-
dren aged 3–19 years from CCHS cycle 2.2 
(2004/05) and CHMS cycle 2 (2009–11) and 
cycle 3 (2012/13). Detailed descriptions of both 
surveys are available elsewhere.18,19,21 We excluded 
CHMS cycle 1 (2007/08) because it did not include 
children less than 6 years of age. We restricted our 
analysis to a comparable age range (3–19 yr) across 
survey cycles so that the post-stratification and 
inverse-probability weights provided by Statistics 
Canada could be applied to account for non-
response and underrepresentation, to permit gener-
alizability of the results to the population as a 
whole with the complex survey design. To protect 
confidentiality, data were merged by age, sex or 
race/ethnicity for some analyses and presentations.
Variables of interest
Anthropometric measurements were collected in 
the surveys using a standardized measurement 
protocol. In brief, heights were measured to the 
nearest 0.5 cm by trained staff; weight was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 kg.1,2 A snug tape mea-
sure was used to measure waist circumference to 
the closest 0.1 cm after palpating the highest 
point on the iliac crests (the so-called National 
Institutes of Health protocol).22 To ensure ade-
quate numbers and consistency across survey 
cycles, we pooled race/ethnicity categories as 
white (European-American) or nonwhite.
Although there are absolute BMI thresholds to 
define obesity and overweight in adults, direct 
comparison of absolute values is not feasible in 
children because most anthropometric measures 
vary by age and sex. To allow comparisons, pedi-
atric definitions of obesity and overweight are 
based on age- and sex-specific z scores or (equiva-
lently) BMI percentile values. For older children 
(age > 5 to < 19 yr), both the WHO and the Public 
Health Agency of Canada’s Collaborative Group 
define obesity as a BMI z score above 2 (97th per-
centile) and overweight as a BMI z score of 1–2 
(85th–97th percentiles). Although these values 
have been chosen in part to align with adult defi-
nitions at age 19 years, different cut-offs are 
applied to toddlers (age > 2 to ≤ 5 yr).
The LMS method summarizes growth data in 
terms of 3 parameters: L (skew), M (median) and 
S (coefficient of variation):23 For a given physical 
measure y, we calculated sex- and age-adjusted 
z scores using the formula z = [(y/M)L − 1]/(LS), 
with recommended modifications for z scores out-
side the range –3 to +3, where this formula does 
not apply.24 We calculated z scores for height, 
weight and BMI using the LMS table from the 
2014 WHO growth charts for Canada, which 
added weight-for-age beyond age 10 years to the 
2010 iteration of the charts, based on our re-
analysis of the original WHO reference data.7 We 
calculated z scores for waist circumference and 
waist:height ratio using recently validated LMS ta-
bles based on data from the US NHANES III (Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 
1988–1994) and the National Institutes of Health 
measurement protocol.25
We defined obesity according to the WHO cri-
teria: BMI above the 97th percentile for older chil-
dren (age > 5 to < 19 yr) and above the 99.9th per-
centile for toddlers (age > 2 to ≤ 5 yr). Similarly, 
we used 2 different BMI ranges to define over-
weight: above the 85th percentile to the 97th per-
centile for older children and above the 97th per-
centile to the 99.9th percentile for toddlers.4,5
Statistical analysis
We performed all analyses using standardized sur-
vey weights in R version 3.0 (www.R-project.org), 
standardized for specific subsamples to ensure 
agreement between weighted and actual sample 
numbers. To accommodate skew, descriptive sta-
tistics are expressed as medians with interquartile 
range (IQR), unless specified otherwise. Statistical 
significance was set at p < 0.05.

To examine the association between mean 
z score and age graphically, we plotted individual 
z scores versus age and smoothed them with 
weighted, penalized regression splines after 
smoothing degrees of freedom were selected by 
generalized cross-validation. We used linear re-
gression analysis to assess the change in mean 
z scores by survey cycle with and without adjust-
ment for the covariates sex, age group and race/
ethnicity. Using the most recent WHO definitions, 
we calculated the proportion of children who were 
overweight or obese and the proportion who were 
obese, by sex and survey cycle. We used logistic 
regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs)
to delineate further the effects of age, sex, race/
ethnicity and survey period on the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity. All regression analyses 
included an interaction term for sex:survey.
Ethics approval
Parents consented for children to be measured as 
part of the CCHS and CMHS surveys; children 
over 12 years (CCHS) or 14 years (CHMS) pro-
vided assent. Approval to undertake our analyses 
was granted by the Research Ethics Board at the 
University of Manitoba and the Statistics Canada 
Research Data Centre.
Results
Data were available for 14 014 children aged 
3–19 years during the period 2004–2013 (Ta-
ble 1). Overall, 11 233 (80.2%) of the children 
were white; the sex distribution was equal in each 
survey cycle, with 7005 girls and 7009 boys over-
all. The median z scores for BMI and weight de-
creased over the 3 survey periods, whereas the 
median z scores for height were stable (Table 2). 
The scores for all 3 measures were positive, which 
indicated that Can 
adian children were heavier and 
taller than the WHO reference population, with 
overall median z scores of 0.40 for BMI, 0.42 for 
weight and 0.20 for height. Compared with the 
NHANES III reference population, the z scores

for waist circumference and waist:height ratio 
were negative (overall median z scores −0.12 and 
−0.31, respectively).
Tables 3 and 4 show the results of the linear 
regression analysis of temporal changes in mean 
z scores, with and without adjustment for several 
covariates. The intercepts representing the mean 
z scores in the 2004/05 survey all differed signif-
icantly from zero. The unadjusted mean z score 
for BMI declined by –0.13 (95% CI –0.18 to 
–0.08) from 2004/05 to 2012/2013. The mean 
z score for weight showed a similar decline, but 
the score for height remained static (Table 3). 
After adjustment for age, sex and race/ethnicity, 
the mean z scores for BMI and weight were still 
lower in the 2012/2013 survey cycle than in the 
2004/05 cycle. Compared with toddlers, older 
children had lower BMI z scores. Girls had 
lower z scores than boys for BMI, weight and 
height. For the sex:survey interaction term, there 
was a small, selective increase in z scores for 
height among girls in the 2012/13 survey cycle 
(mean change 0.09 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.15] for 
girls v. –0.05 [95% CI –0.11 to 0.01] for boys; 
p for interaction = 0.02).
Although both measures of central adiposity 
lacked 2004/05 CCHS survey data for compari-
son (Tables 2 and 4), the mean z scores for waist 
circumference and weight:height ratio were nega-
tive in 2009–2011 (i.e., below the NHANES III 
reference population). In the 2012/13 survey 
cycle, there was an increase in mean z scores for 
waist circumference and weight:height ratio that 
persisted after we adjusted for age, sex and race/
ethnicity. Although girls had lower z scores than 
boys in the 2009–2011 survey cycle, a sex:survey 
interaction was noted for 2012/13, with girls 
effectively catching up to their male counterparts.
When we examined the mean (smoothed) 
z scores for BMI as a function of age and survey 
cycle (Figure 1), we found that young toddlers 
had higher mean z scores than older children and 
the WHO reference population. The observed 
decline in BMI z scores occurred largely among 
children 5–12 years of age.
Using the current definitions, we observed a 
significant decline in the prevalence of overweight 
or obesity among children across survey cycles, 
from 30.7% (95% CI 29.7% to 31.6%) to 27.0% 
(95% CI 25.3% to 28.7%; p < 0.001) (Figure 2 and

Table 5). In contrast, the prevalence of obesity was 
stable at about 13%. Fewer girls than boys were 
overweight or obese (Figure 2 and Table 5).
The results of the multivariable logistic re-
gression analysis are shown in Table 6. The de-
cline in the prevalence of overweight or obesity 
was statistically significant with and without ad-
justment for age, sex and race/ethnicity. In the 
unadjusted comparison, this corresponded to an 
OR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.92) for the 2012/13 
survey cycle compared with the 2004/05 cycle. In 
the multivariable model, the rate was further re-
duced among girls (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 
0.72 to 0.92). Rates were higher among nonwhite 
children than white children (adjusted OR 1.15, 
95% CI 1.06 to 1.25) and among older children 
than among toddlers (adjusted OR 3.66, 95% CI 
3.14 to 4.31). The latter observation contrasts 
with the lower BMI z scores among older chil-
dren in Figure 1. In contrast, overall obesity rates 
plateaued across survey periods, as confirmed by 
the absence of significant results in the unad-
justed and adjusted logistic regression models re-
ported in Table 6. Obesity was more prevalent 
among boys, older children and nonwhite chil-
dren than among girls, toddlers and white chil-
dren, respectively.
Interpretation
Using the current definitions of overweight and 
obesity, we found a significant decrease in the 
prevalence of overweight or obesity and a stabili-
zation in the prevalence of obesity among Can-
adian children from 2004 to 2013. This change can 
be attributed to a general decrease in z scores for 
weight and BMI, whereas z scores for height were 
stable across the survey periods. Our findings per-
sisted after adjustment for age, sex and race/ethnic-
ity. Rates of overweight or obesity and of obesity 
were lower among girls and white children than 
among boys and nonwhite children, respectively. 
Despite having higher mean BMI z scores, tod-
dlers had lower rates in both categories; this obser-
vation was explained in part by the higher BMI 
thresholds for toddlers, because obesity is defined 
as a BMI above the 97th percentile for older chil-
dren and above the 99.9th percentile for toddlers.
Unfortunately, Canadian children are still rela-
tively heavy. The median z scores for BMI and

weight in 2012/13 remained above those for the 
WHO growth charts. Although our study was un-
able to identify the mechanism for the observed de-
cline in BMI z scores and rates of overweight or 
obesity, the introduction of BMI growth charts in 
2000 may have encouraged health care providers to 
discuss children’s overweight or obese status more 
openly with families.6 In addition, numerous weight 
management programs, both regional and national, 
have been implemented (for review, see Ball and 
colleagues26), and increasing media scrutiny may 
have increased public awareness of the health is-
sues. Failure to observe a corresponding reduction 
in obesity rates over time may reflect greater impact 
of such interventions among children who are over-
weight or, alternatively, a lack of statistical power 
given the smaller numbers in the obese category.
These findings are difficult to compare directly 
with many past Canadian reports because of the 
new criteria introduced with the 2010 WHO 
growth charts for Canada4 and different age 
ranges. Our analysis of the CCHS data from the 
2004/05 cycle is similar to that of Shields and 
Tremblay,1 although we specifically extended the 
ages studied to include children between 17 and 
19 years old to conform to the WHO charts. Com-
pared with earlier analyses of CHMS data,2 we 
were able to add younger children (3–5 yr) and 
provide additional time points to examine secular 
trends. Moreover, our recent extension of WHO 
weight-for-age norms to older children (> 10 yr) 
and NHANES III reference charts for waist cir-
cumference and weight:height ratio permitted a 
novel and perhaps more nuanced analysis than 
was previously possible, by allowing us to calcu-
late z scores for weight, waist circumference and 
waist:height ratio.7,25 These data based on up-to-
date thresholds and growth-chart percentiles are 
therefore important benchmarks for the analysis 
of future surveys examining temporal trends.
In the US, the prevalence of obesity among 
children has remained static over the same study 
period, at about 17%, with the exception of chil-
dren aged 2–5 years, among whom there was a 
decline to about 8%.9 The overall US rate of over-
weight or obesity remained at about 30%.27 
Importantly, the US definitions use CDC cutoffs; 
if these data were re-analyzed using WHO cri-
teria, the rates of overweight or obesity and of 
obesity in the US would be about 8%–10% 
higher.1 Thus, Canada appears to be faring better 
than the US in the war on obesity.9,10
Other jurisdictions (e.g., Poland, Australia, the 
Netherlands, Germany and Denmark) have shown 
variable changes with either small declines or pla-
teaus in obesity rates.11–15 Some developing coun-
tries are undergoing the same surge in obesity wit-
nessed in Canada from 1978 to 2004.16 Other 
investigators have identified higher rates of obesity 
among Canadian boys using self-reported mea-
sures.28 As we found, nonwhite children in many 
countries have increased odds of being overweight 
or obese.15,29,30 In contrast, a recent study involving 
immigrant and nonimmigrant Canadian children 
aged 12–18 years reported a lower rate of obesity 
among immigrant children (18% v. 22%) using 
self-reported metrics.28 These differences may be 
attributed to socioeconomic status or other factors 
that we could not explore.29–31
Although others have directly compared Can-
adian and US rates of overweight or obesity and 
obesity using BMI thresholds,1,27 we were further 
able to study 2 measures of central adiposity 
(z scores for waist circumference and weight: 
height ratio) using data for the NHANES III refer-
ence population.25 Compared with the reference 
population, our overall median z scores for both 
measures were –0.12 and –0.31, respectively, 
which confirms that Canadian children have less 
central adiposity than American children in the

1988–1994 reference population. In contrast, in a 
contemporary American cohort aged 5–19 years, 
we reported mean z scores of 0.33 (95% CI 0.30 to 
0.36) for waist circumference and 0.35 (95% CI 
0.32 to 0.38) for weight:height ratio,25 which are 
significantly different from the z scores in Tables 
2–4. These results are particularly reassuring in 
light of our recent study showing that z scores for 
these measures of central adiposity are better pre-
dictors of cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., hyper-
cholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic 
syndrome) than z scores for BMI, at least among 
North American children.25
Limitations
Our findings are not without limitations. Because 
of the need to protect confidentiality and the 
smaller size of the annual CHMS surveys, not all 
data could be cross-tabulated by year, sex and 
age. Moreover, given the relatively small num-
bers, we could not examine regional or racial dif-
ferences. Despite the use of survey weights, non-
responder biases may have been present. In 
addition, the data are cross-sectional in nature 
and cannot be used to infer causality or predict 
future trends. Nonetheless, our study is important 
in providing a glimpse of trends since the last

Conclusion
Despite a welcome decline in the prevalence of 
overweight or obesity and a plateau in the preva-
lence of obesity among Can 
adian children, we 
must continue ongoing surveillance and control 
measures for all children. Using the latest defini-
tions and tools to describe anthropometric measure-
ments in Canadian children, this study should be 
considered a benchmark for future comparisons.
