Summary
Background Rotavirus is a major contributor to child mortality. The effect of rotavirus vaccine on diarrhoea mortality 
has been estimated in middle-income but not low-income settings, where mortality is high and vaccine effectiveness 
in reducing admissions to hospital is lower. Empirical population-based mortality studies have not been done in any 
setting. Malawi introduced monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) in October, 2012. We aimed to investigate the impact 
and effectiveness of the RV1 vaccine in reducing diarrhoea-associated mortality in infants aged 10–51 weeks.
Methods In this population-based cohort study, we included infants born between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, in 
Mchinji, Central Malawi and analysed data on those surviving 10 weeks. Individual vaccination status was extracted 
from caregiver-held records or report at home visits at 4 months and 1 year of age. Survival to 1 year was confirmed at 
home visit, or cause of death ascertained by verbal autopsy. We assessed impact (1 minus mortality rate ratio following 
vs before vaccine introduction) using Poisson regression. Among vaccine-eligible infants (born from Sept 17, 2012), 
we assessed effectiveness (1 minus hazard ratio) using Cox regression.
Findings Between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, we recruited 48 672 livebirths in Mchinji, among whom 38 518 were 
vaccine-eligible and 37 570 survived to age 10 weeks. Two-dose versus zero-dose effectiveness analysis included 
28 141 infants, of whom 101 had diarrhoea-associated death before 1 year of age. Diarrhoea-associated mortality 
declined by 31% (95% CI 1–52; p=0·04) after RV1 introduction. Effectiveness against diarrhoea-mortality was 34% 
(95% CI –28 to 66; p=0·22).
Interpretation RV1 was associated with substantial reduction in diarrhoea-associated deaths among infants in this 
rural sub-Saharan African setting. These data add considerable weight to evidence showing the impact of rotavirus 
vaccine programmes.

Introduction
Diarrhoea causes 17% of post-neonatal infant deaths 
globally.1 Despite impressive survival gains from improved 
sanitation and case management, rotavirus—the greatest 
contributor to this mortality—still caused 215 000 child 
deaths in 2013, 121 000 of these in Africa.2 Subsequently, 
with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, many 
African countries with the highest mortality burdens have 
introduced live attenuated rotavirus vaccines.3
Vaccine impact (ie, population reductions in disease 
burden following vaccine introduction) upon, and 
vaccine effectiveness (individual protection afforded by 
vaccin 
ation) against, rotavirus gastroenteritis hospital-
isation have been shown4–7 in high-income, middle-
income, and low-income countries. Vaccine efficacy 
against laboratory-proven rotavirus in clinical trials is 
lower in low-income, high-mortality countries than in 
high-income, low-mortality countries.8 Therefore, to 
support widespread imple 
mentation, evidence of the 
impact of rotavirus vaccine on population-level mortality 
and real-world effectiveness on individual risk of death 
is crucially important. Vaccine impact on mortality 
has been shown9–11 through analysis of administrative 
datasets from middle-income countries in Central and 
South America. However, no direct mortality benefit of 
rotavirus vaccination has been documented at population 
level from a low-income, high-burden setting.
Malawi, a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa, 
with year-round rotavirus transmission, has made 
sustained efforts to reduce child mortality and in 2015 
had reached the Millennium Development Goal target 
of reducing child mortality by two-thirds from 
1990 levels. In Malawi, health centres and community-
based health surveillance assistants (HSAs; the

community health-care workers and vaccinators in 
Malawi) routinely provide oral rehydration solution and 
zinc for diarrhoeal disease, which are widely available. 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was intro-
duced into Malawi’s National Immunisation Programme 
with three doses given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age on 
Nov 12, 2011. Monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, 
RV1) was introduced on Oct 29, 2012, at the WHO 
recommended schedule of 6 and 10 weeks, without 
catch-up. We have shown6,7,12,13 RV1 efficacy (49%; 95% CI 
19–68), effectiveness (64%; 95% CI 24–83), and impact 
(43%; 95% CI 18–61) on severe laboratory-confirmed 
rotavirus gastroenteritis in Malawian infants, and have 
shown that RV1 is highly cost-effective in this setting.
We aimed to assess population-level impact and 
individual-level effectiveness of RV1 against diarrhoea-
associated mortality using a large prospective population-
based birth cohort in a rural population in Mchinji district, 
central Malawi (site 1). To support our estimate of RV1 
programme impact, we also planned for a concurrent 
prespecified impact assessment in a smaller separate 
population in Chilumba, northern Malawi (site 2; 
appendix).14 We present results from the two sites in turn.
Methods
Before study commencement, extensive community 
engagement and consultation activities were undertaken 
with Traditional Authorities, village chiefs, health 
committees, women’s groups, district and environmental 
health officers, health-centre managers, and HSAs to 
ensure the study was welcome in communities and 
households.
Malawi’s 
National 
Health 
Sciences 
Research 
Committee (#837) and the London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine (#6047) provided ethics approval.
Site 1: data collection and management 
To assess population-level impact and individual-
level effectiveness, we did a large scale, prospective, 
population-based birth cohort study. Site 1 (in Mchinji 
district) population was 456 516 persons in the 2008 
national census, with a crude birth rate of 32 births per 
1000 population and postneonatal infant mortality rate 
of 28 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2015.15,16 The district 
is rural and borders Zambia and Mozambique. Its 
sparsely populated villages and agricultural estates 
are interspersed with semiurban trading centres. The 
economy is based on subsistence maize farming. 
Electricity is available in 3·3% of households.16 This 
district was the location of a previous cluster randomised 
trial,17 with strong community support for research. It 
had the requisite infrastructure to expand to district-
wide mortality surveillance and allowed us to do this 
type of study.
We did a baseline district-wide census in March, 2012, 
to 
obtain 
household 
membership 
and 
create 
community-held household registers. To establish 
prospective household surveillance in 1832 census-
enumerated villages within all 354 HSA clusters, we 
used a cadre of 1059 village-based key informants who 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Rotavirus vaccine (RV) has been introduced in many low-
income countries with high mortality, supported by Gavi, but 
mortality impact or effectiveness estimates are absent from 
these settings. We searched PubMed using the terms “rotavirus 
vaccine [Title/Abstract]” AND “mortality [Title/Abstract]” OR 
“death [Title/Abstract]” NOT “review [Publication Type]” NOT 
“cost-effectiveness [Title]”. 185 citations arose from the search 
and NB-Z and CK reviewed the articles independently, excluding 
review articles and secondary publication of data. 13 studies, all 
from middle-income countries, were identified. A study in 
Botswana reported reductions in case fatality of infants in 
hospital of 48% and another one in Panama 45%, but neither 
reported on population mortality. All other studies (Bolivia, 
n=1; Brazil, n=5; Mexico, n=3; combined South American 
countries n=2) used time-series analyses of national 
administrative datasets to estimate mortality reductions 
following introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. These studies 
reported reductions in infant diarrhoeal-mortality of 
between 21% and 41%, with higher estimates noted within 
rotavirus season than outside the season. We did not identify 
any mortality impact data from low-income countries. To our 
knowledge, prospective, population-based studies 
investigating rotavirus vaccine impact on mortality have not 
been published from any country. In southern Malawi, RV1 
introduction was associated with a 43% reduction in hospital 
admissions of infants with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus, with 
vaccine effectiveness of 64%, and it was highly cost-effective.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this large population-based birth cohort 
study is the first to report rotavirus vaccine-associated infant 
mortality reductions from a low-income country using the 
WHO recommended Expanded Programme on Immunisation 
schedule of 6 and 10 weeks, and shows an association between 
coverage achieved and mortality impact gained. Additionally, 
this study shows a possible added benefit on diarrhoeal 
mortality of vaccine introduction in the context of enhanced 
water, hygiene, and sanitation improvements.
Implications of all the available evidence
In addition to morbidity impact and high cost-effectiveness, 
countries with national or localised areas of high diarrhoeal 
mortality should consider introducing rotavirus vaccines for 
survival benefits. Vaccine implementation combined with 
improvement in water and sanitation might provide 
maximum impact.

were selected by village health committees. Key 
informants did continuous household surveillance and 
maintained updated paper-based household registers 
for about 100 households each, recording all preg-
nancies, birth outcomes, and deaths of children 
younger than 5 years, and of women of childbearing 
age. Key informants were supervised by and reported 
data monthly to 50 enumerators, who electronically 
scanned the updated registers. Enumerators did home 
visits to all liveborn infants at 4 and 12 months of age to 
record vaccination status and confirm survival. The 
system was supervised by eight monitoring and 
evaluation officers (MEOs). Deaths reported by infor-
mants were verified and specially trained MEOs 
determined cause of death by verbal autopsy captured 
electronically at the household, completed as culturally 
appropriate at least 2 weeks after death, by using the 
WHO 2012 verbal autopsy instrument (Open Data Kit 
software).18 We have published a detailed description of 
this surveillance system.14
Vaccine status was obtained from a scanned image of 
a vaccine record (health passport, which is held by the 
caregiver) issued by the government and caregiver 
report (completed during household visits by enumer-
ators when infants were 4 and 12 months of age or by 
MEOs following death). Caregivers were asked directly 
about the receipt and date of each dose of every vaccine 
for which the child was age-eligible under the National 
Immu 
nisation Programme. Vaccine status was cross 
checked against vaccination centre registers in a subset 
of records for quality assurance. Final vaccine status 
was determined per criteria outlined in the appendix. 
To compare reported versus recorded vaccine receipt, 
throughout recruitment mothers were interviewed by 
MEOs after infant vaccination at randomly allocated 
clinics. Additionally, throughout recruitment, enumer-
ators collected socio 
demo 
graphic data on maternal 
vitals, marital status, and educational level obtained, 
and data on house, water source, and sanitation quality. 
Quality controls were embedded in the database, which 
automatically triggered field checks in case of error or 
anomalous runs of data (eg, no births in a catchment 
for 3 months). MEOs met monthly to review data 
quality and timeliness and address field challenges.
Infants surviving to at least 10 weeks of age who were 
born between Jan 1, 2012, and Sept 16, 2012, constituted 
the prevaccination cohort. Those born between 
Sept 17, 2012 (ie, eligible for first dose of RV1 on the date 
of vaccine introduction), and June 1, 2015, constituted 
the vaccine-age eligible cohort. Impact analysis 
compared both cohorts, whereas analysis of individual 
survival for effectiveness was done in the vaccine-
eligible cohort only. Livebirths were followed up when 
the child had reached 1 year of age or death, or were 
excluded if they migrated. 1-year follow-up concluded 
on June 1, 2016. Diarrhoea-associated death was defined 
as any deceased child whose caregiver reported 
non-bloody diarrhoea in the illness preceding death 
upon direct closed questioning at verbal autopsy.
Site 1: statistical analysis
We derived vaccine programme impact as 1 minus 
diarrhoea-associated mortality rate ratio in the vaccine-
eligible cohort versus prevaccination cohort using 
Poisson regression adjusted for sociodemographic co-
variates (table 1). The relative brevity of the prevaccine 
introduction period at site 1 precluded adjustment by 
year. We also restricted analysis to between January and

June, months with known high rotavirus prevalence in 
Blantyre, Malawi.19 To examine the association between 
population vaccine coverage and mortality, we did a 
Poisson regression of the mortality rate against two-dose 
vaccine coverage (proportion of two-dose-eligible infants 
in the population who actually received both doses) over 
time and by HSA cluster.17 For HSA cluster analysis of 
mortality versus vaccine coverage, we also adjusted for 
cluster-specific means of household level sociodemo-
graphic covariates, but we had no data on communal 
assets such as state of roads or public infrastructure. 
When plotting mortality rates over time, we used locally 
weighted moving average smoothing (appendix). 
We calculated two-dose versus zero-dose effectiveness 
as 1 minus hazard ratio using Cox proportional hazards 
modelling of diarrhoea-associated death occurring at 
10–51 completed weeks of life. Because children might 
die from causes other than diarrhoea, we also did 
competing risks–survival analysis. We used multivariable 
modelling to adjust for sociodemographic covariates 
using complete-case analysis (table 1). We have previously 
published20 the primary analysis plan and justification. 
In case of violation of the proportional hazards 
assumption and to better understand how effectiveness 
might be related to age, we did a fully parametric 
survival analysis using Royston-Parmar modelling.21 We 
examined whether cluster-level deter 
minants influence 
individual level mortality hazard using random effects 
hierarchical models.
In our sentinel hospital in Blantyre, rotavirus prevalence 
in severe gastroenteritis was 35% overall and 51% in peak 
periods; we therefore presumed rotavirus prevalence 
of 45% in diarrhoea-associated deaths.6,22 Given that our 
published effectiveness against rotavirus gastroenteritis in 
Malawian infants in hospital was 64%, we assumed that 
effectiveness against very severe rotavirus gastroenteritis 
(leading to death) would be higher at 70–80%. Applying a 
presumed 76% reduction to the 45% of deaths presumed 
attributable to rotavirus, gave an effectiveness of 34% 
against all-cause diarrhoea-associated death. Based on our 
established surveillance before RV1 introduction, we 
expected 1500 births per month and a postneonatal infant 
mortality rate of 18 per 1000 livebirths, of which six were 
diarrhoea-associated. We assumed 60% mean vaccine 
coverage over the recruitment period. Inflating for 
12% loss to follow-up, we required 36 293 infants who 
survived to 10 weeks to obtain 80% power to detect 
effectiveness of more than 34%.
Site 2: data collection and management
A demographic surveillance site (DSS) covering 
35 000 individuals has operated in the remote lakeside 
region of Chilumba, northern Malawi since 2002.23 
Crude birth rate was 30·8 per 1000 population in 2015, 
postneonatal infant mortality was 15 per 1000 livebirths, 
and electricity was available in 8·7% of households.16 
This longstanding DSS provided robust data on 
historical mortality rates in infants before vaccine intro-
duction from 2004 and was therefore considered useful 
for independent impact assessment. Individual survival 
analysis was precluded by the small total population. 
For this site, births, deaths, and migrations were 
reported monthly by village informants and validated in 
a rolling annual census (previously described).23 Verbal 
autopsies were done during home visits, as locally 
culturally appropriate, at least 2 weeks after death. 
Socio 
demographic covariates and vaccine status were 
collected for age-eligible children at the time of census 
visit, with vaccination date transcribed from caregiver-
held records (health passport) or caregiver reports. We 
used Poisson regression to test monthly diarrhoea-
associated mortality rate among 10–51-week-old infants 
against vaccine coverage, adjusting for year to account 
for long-term trend.24 Unbeknown to us at planning 
phase, the Red Cross implemented rapid, widespread, 
and sustained water and sanitation interventions 
(WASH) across the DSS area alongside national vaccine 
introduction.25 Site 2 could therefore no longer serve 
its intended validation function, but afforded an

Results
For site 1, we registered 48 672 live births. Of these, the 
prevaccination cohort comprised 10 154 infants (born 
between Jan 1, 2012, and Sept 16, 2012), among whom 
7818 infants survived to 10 weeks and were included in 
the analysis (appendix). The vaccine-eligible cohort inc-
luded 38 518 infants (born between Sept 17, 2012, and 
June 1, 2015), among whom 37 570 infants survived to 
10 weeks. 29 085 infants were included in the analysis, 
with 108 infants who died wtih diarrhoea before 1 year of 
age (figure 1). In the vaccine-eligible cohort, mean age at 
diarrhoea-associated death was 34 weeks, and 27 weeks for 
non-diarrhoea associated death (t test, p<0·001). Two-dose 
RV1 coverage was 90·6% overall, 90·8% in survivors, 
and 84·3% in deceased infants. Health passports were 
seen in 90% of infants overall, but ascertainment differed 
by survivorship—91% in survivors and 40% among 
the deceased. Sociodemo 
graphic factors were similar in 
survivors and deceased infants, except for maternal 
marital status or maternal death (table 1). Before RV1 
introduction, compared with baseline assumptions (see 
Methods section), monthly births were 1112, postneonatal 
infant mortality rate was 18·8 per 1000 livebirths, 
diarrhoea-associated mortality was 5·6 per 1000 livebirths, 
and loss to follow-up was 18%. Post-hoc exploratory 
analysis found that infants lost to follow-up, compared 
with those who remained in the study, had younger (mean 
age: 25 vs 27 years) but more educated mothers (15% vs 
12% secondary education) who were more likely to be 
unmarried (86% vs 89% married) and have slightly better 
housing quality (11% vs 9% best quality).
Before vaccine introduction in the prevaccination 
cohort, 44 (mortality rate [MR] 5·6 per 1000 livebirths; 
figure 2A) of 7818 infants who survived to 10 weeks died 
with diarrhoea before 1 year of age. In the vaccine 
age-eligible cohort, 108 (MR 3·7 per 1000 live births) of 
29 085 infants who survived to 10 weeks died of diarrhoea 
before 1 year of age. Unadjusted Poisson regression 
estimated vaccine impact on diarrhoea-associated 
mortality at 34% (95% CI 6–53; p=0·03; N=36 900) 
and sociodemographically adjusted Poisson regression 
estimated mortality at 31% (1–52; p=0·043; N=36 770). 
For equivalent January to June periods, assumed to 
represent peak rotavirus prevalence, in the postintro-
duction years 2013–15, the diarrhoea-associated mortality 
was 3·7 per 1000 in 2013 (impact 39% [95% CI 10–59]; 
p=0·013), 2·1 in 2014 (76% [58–86]; p<0·001), and 2·6 in 
2015 (68% [47–81]; p=<0·001; table 2). All-cause mortality 
rate reduction post RV1 introduction was 25% (95% CI 
8–39; p=0·008).
In 354 HSA clusters of approximately 1300 persons 
each,17 mean postneonatal infant mortality was 12·3 per 
1000 (SD 14·0; range 0–76·9) and diarrhoea-associated 
mortality was 3·6 per 1000 (SD 8·4; range 0–64·5). 
Two-dose vaccine coverage ranged from 63·6% to 100% 
across clusters; each percentage point increase in vaccine 
coverage was associated with a 1·6% (95% CI 0·8–2·5) 
lower diarrhoea-associated mortality rate (appendix). 
Adjusting for sociodemographic covariates, the reduction 
was 1·1% (95% CI 0·9–1·3)

Of 26 352 fully RV1-vaccinated infants, 91 (0·4%) 
died with diarrhoea. In 1789 unvaccinated infants, 
ten (0·6%) died with diarrhoea (figure 3A). Unadjusted 
Cox modelling gave two-dose effectiveness against 
diarrhoea-associated mortality of 39% (95% CI 
–16 to 68) and for adjusted Cox modelling gave 
effectiveness of 34% (–28 to 66; table 1). Adjusting for 
HSA catchment area using a random effects hier-
archical model gave an effectiveness of 36% (95% CI 
–24 to 67; likelihood ratio test p<0·001). Analysis of 
Schöenfeld residuals showed no evidence of violation 
of the proportional hazards assumption (p=0·23). 
Competing risks regression gave an effectiveness 
of 28% (95% CI –43 to 67). Effectiveness estimates 
derived from a Royston-Parmar model showed high 
effectiveness in early infancy, which declined after 
6 months of age (figure 3C). Further sensitivity 
analyses and effectiveness against all-cause mortality 
are presented in the appendix.
For site 2, between Jan 1, 2004, and June 1, 2015, 
15 394 livebirths were recorded. Of these 3531 were 
eligible for RV1, with 3433 infants surviving to 10 weeks. 
Follow-up was completed on June 1, 2016, for 3249 infants, 
with 3235 infants surviving to 1 year. Of the 14 deceased 
infants, three died with diarrhoea.
All-cause and diarrhoea-associated deaths have been 
declining since 2006, but were substantially lower since 
RV1 introduction and the Red Cross WASH interventions 
(figure 2B). Adjusting for year, to account for long-term 
trend, Poisson regression of raw data on monthly 
diarrhoea-associated mortality before and after these 
interventions gives a mortality-rate reduction of 46% 
(95% CI 26–60; p<0·001).
Discussion
In this study, national introduction of RV1 was associated 
with a 31% reduction in diarrhoea-associated mortality 
in infants surviving to at least 10 weeks of age, and the 
degree of impact was strongly associated with vaccine 
coverage. Point estimate for individual protection from 
diarrhoea-associated mortality was 34%, though too 
few cases of diarrhoeal death occurred after introduction 
of vaccine to achieve sufficiently precise confidence 
bounds. In the context of published RV1 impact (43%) 
and effectiveness (64%) estimates against laboratory-
confirmed rotavirus hospitalisation from Blantyre in 
southern Malawi, our estimates of impact (31%) and 
effectiveness (34%) against aetiologically non-specific 
diarrhoea-associated death have validity.6 The high 
effectiveness observed in months known to have high 
rotavirus prevalence (January to June) and the association 
between vaccine coverage and impact further attest to 
causal plausibility. These data from a low-income, high-
burden setting therefore provide compelling evidence of 
RV1 impact on diarrhoea-associated infant mortality.
The estimates of mortality impact in site 1 are similar 
to those found in previous analyses of administrative 
datasets in middle-income countries.9–11,26 For example, 
RV1 introduction in Mexico was associated with 
diarrhoeal-mortality rate reduction in infants of 41% and 
in Brazil of 21%.9,10,26 A study in Botswana, a sub-Saharan 
middle-income country, reported a 48% (95% CI 11–69) 
reduction in fatality among patients with gastroenteritis 
in hospital during the rotavirus season, and similar 
findings have been reported from a study in Panama; 
however, neither study measured population mortality.27,28 
The similar levels of protection found in our low-income 
sub-Saharan African setting is encouraging because 
children from this region account for more than half of 
global diarrhoea deaths, and with 31 African countries 
thus far introducing rotavirus vaccine, the absolute 
impact on mortality is likely to be substantial. 2,3
The cohort design allowed us to estimate hazard and 
effectiveness by age—a metric that has been approximated 
in case-control studies.29 The observed hazard by age 
mimics the age at laboratory-confirmed rotavirus hospital 
admissions seen in our sentinel surveillance site in 
Blantyre (figure 2B). The apparent decline in effectiveness 
with age is unlikely to be due to individual immunological 
waning before 12 months, but it could be explained by 
changes in the force of infection through indirect effects.13 
If rotavirus prevalence is declining (table 2), the hazard 
for unvaccinated infants declines so the measurable 
protection afforded by vaccine direct effects is thereby 
reduced. Survivorship bias might also contribute to lower 
effectiveness estimates in older infants since survivors 
who happen to receive vaccination late do not contribute 
their prevaccination survival time to the unvaccinated 
cohort, and survivors are implicitly more robust.
The greater individual level effectiveness against 
all-cause mortality than against diarrhoea-associated 
mortality (appendix) in site 1 is explained by confounding. 
Infants who did not receive RV1 had a greater likelihood 
of not receiving other Expanded Programme on 
Immunisation vaccinations, in particular pneumococcal 
vaccine that was introduced 10 months before RV1. 
Moreover, such children had greater association with

other sociodemographic risk factors for mortality 
(appendix). Children from households with fewer assets 
had increased mortality hazard (table 1; appendix). We 
have previously published data30 from site 2 showing 
that sociodemographically vulnerable infants are at 
greater risk of both vaccine non-receipt and of death 
than those less vulnerable.
Our study has several limitations. First, on the one 
hand, vaccination population-impact evaluations are 
subject to temporal and secular biases, particularly for 
aetiologically non-specific endpoints. On the other hand, 
individual effectiveness estimates might be biased by 
access to vaccination or choice to vaccinate. We thus 
sought to determine both impact and effectiveness, 
and took account of sociodemographic confounding. 
However, successful vaccines with strong impact on 
disease incidence challenge sufficient accumulation of 
cases for individual-level analysis of adequate power, 
because deaths become rarer events. Thus, although the 
impact and effectiveness point estimates were similar, 
impact was such that effectiveness had wide confidence 
bounds. Second, although we inflated our sample size to 
account for anticipated loss to follow-up, it is possible that 
migrating children differed systematically from the rest 
of the population, thereby biasing vaccine effectiveness 
estimates. Single, wealthier, and more educated women 
were more mobile, but the differences, though nominally 
significant, were modest. The observed vaccine coverage 
and mortality rates in the non-migrating cohort aligned 
with our initial expectations. Third, retrospective updating 
of vaccine status might have been associated with bias 
toward higher apparent vaccine effectiveness.31 Coding

mitigate this bias, but this approach requires a high 
frequency of visits. Not only is this logistically challenging 
in a study of this magnitude, but might itself affect 
mortality outcome by increasing opportunity for illness 
recog 
nition. Fourth, we went to great lengths to minimise 
underascertainment of both unvaccinated survivors and 
vaccinated infants who died, as previously described.20 Yet 
among deceased infants, health passports were often 
buried along with the child and unavailable for review. 
We could not change this cultural practice despite 
educational campaigns by radio and through community 
engagement. We actively sought vaccination clinic 
records to obtain vaccine status of deceased children, but 
finding the correct individual records of specific infants 
was challenging. We therefore assessed the quality of 
parental reporting through quality assurance activities. 
Our maternal exit interviews following vaccine clinic 
visits showed bidirectional mis 
classification of about 4% 
(data not shown). Restricting analysis to deceased infants 
whose records were available would itself have introduced 
bias. Fifth, cause of death misclassification can affect 
effectiveness estimation. Under-reporting of diarrhoea 
among vaccinated deceased infants will bias effectiveness 
and impact estimates away from the null. However, 
validation studies from Africa have shown high sensitivity 
for diarrhoea in effectiveness, and these are relatively 
robust to recall bias since parents remember the details of 
their child’s final illness.32 Sixth, since date of vaccination 
was not always available, we could not analyse vaccination 
status as a time-varying covariate, which probably 
introduced a slight bias away from the null, since had we 
done so then the brief survival time between becoming 
eligible (we allowed 2 weeks for vaccination to be 
considered timely) and actually receiving vaccination 
would not have been included in vaccinated survival time. 
The fact that most vaccination was timely is therefore 
reassuring. Finally, other coadministered vaccines might 
also reduce diarrhoea-associated mortality, thus subtly 
increasing apparent RV1 effectiveness. Coadministration 
of other vaccines was almost universal, and we cannot 
account for this bias. In site 2, where we report a 
combined impact of RV1 introduction and a compre-
hensive WASH intervention, the magnitude of mortality 
reduction was 46%. Surveillance duration and therefore 
model adjustments differed across our two sites so 
the two results are not directly comparable. Given the 
unanticipated cointroduction of extensive improvements 
in sanitation at site 2, our result could have been biased 
away from the null because of other improvements 
in health care in this region, though in scoping with 
stakeholders we have not become aware of any other 
concurrent population interventions. Notwithstanding 
these caveats, the implication that concurrent inter-
ventions might have synergistic benefit is intriguing and 
warrants further programmatic evaluation.
Childhood diarrhoea-associated mortality in this rural 
African population has fallen during the past decade, 
in part because of improvements in sanitation and 
treatment interventions, including oral rehydration salts 
and zinc. Our large and comprehensive study shows for 
the first time, using empirically observed, population-
based surveillance, that rotavirus vaccine is associated 
with a further reduction in diarrhoea deaths in a low-
income, rural African population. These data add 
considerable weight to the WHO recommendation that 
all countries add rotavirus vaccine to existing public 
health interventions to further reduce diarrhoea deaths, 
particularly countries in south and southeast Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa.33
