Sleep is vital to human functioning and well-being; nev-
ertheless, insomnia, the persistent inability to get sleep of 
sufficient length and quality, is a common problem 
among adults and one of the most prevalent contempo-
rary health problems (Ancoli-Israel & Roth, 1999), esti-
mated to affect 12% to 15% of the adult population and 
as many as 50% of clients in primary health care settings 
(Ohayon, 2002). Insomnia is comorbid with many physi-
cal (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease) and mental ill-
nesses (including anxiety and depression; Pearson, 
Johnson, & Nahin, 2006), and individuals with insomnia 
are likely to take more medications, consume more 
health care resources, be absent from work due to illness 
more often, and have more work-related and motor vehi-
cle accidents (Ancoli-Israel & Roth, 1999; O’Keeffe, Gan-
der, Scott, & Scott, 2012), making insomnia an enormous 
health and economic burden worldwide (Taylor, 2008).
Current treatment options for insomnia include phar-
macological therapies and cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia (CBT-I). Pharmacological treatments are 
the most widely prescribed. Drugs in common use 
such as anxiolytic benzodiazepines and hypnotics (e.g., 
zopiclone) affect the GABA neurotransmitter (Sateia & 
Nowell, 2004). Limitations include daytime impairment 
and sedation due to slow drug metabolism that interferes 
with the consumer’s daily functioning, the risk of depen-
dence/addiction and unpleasant side effects, and the 
production of rebound symptoms upon discontinuation 
(Sateia & Nowell, 2004). Furthermore, there is limited evi-
dence showing that chronic use is effective long term 
(Krystal et al., 2010). Widespread concern about long-
term effectiveness, habituation, tolerance, and the poten-
tial complications of insomnia medications (Krystal et al., 
2010; Sateia & Nowell, 2004) has encouraged a search for 
alternative treatments (Kierlin, 2008). CBT-I targets appro-
priate sleep hygiene and those behaviors and cognitions 
that inhibit sleep (Blampied & Bootzin, 2013). Although 
established as effective (Belanger, Savard, & Morin, 2006; 
Morin, Culbert, & Schwartz, 1994; Morin et al., 2006), 
CBT-I relies heavily on the individual having access to a 
qualified therapist initially and then practicing CBT-I in a

Effect of Micronutrients on Insomnia in 
Adults: A Multiple-Baseline Study

Abstract
Insomnia is a debilitating condition causing psychological distress and frequently comorbid with other mental health 
conditions. This study examined the effect of 8 weeks of treatment by broad spectrum micronutrients (vitamins 
and minerals) on insomnia using a multiple-baseline-across-participants open-label trial design. Seventeen adults 
were randomized to 1-, 2-, or 3-week baseline periods (14 completed). Self-report measures were the Consensus 
Sleep Diary–Morning (CSD-M), the Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS), and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 
(DASS). Baselines were generally stable. Treatment completers reported reliable and clinically significant change in 
insomnia severity (PIRS), in depression, stress, and anxiety (DASS), and on at least two aspects of sleep measured by 
the CDS-M. All completers were treatment-compliant, and side effects were minimal. Nutritional supplementation is 
shown to be a novel, beneficial treatment for insomnia in adults. Follow-up research using placebo-controlled designs 
as well as comparisons to cognitive-behavioral and other treatments is recommended.

sustained way, a challenge for many insomnia suffers. 
Other complementary and alternative treatments are 
widely used (Pearson et al., 2006), but effectiveness is not 
yet clearly established for most (Kierlin, 2008).
Recently, the use of broad-spectrum micronutrients 
(vitamins and minerals) has emerged as an effective treat-
ment for a range of mental health problems, including 
stress, anxiety, depression, and neurodevelopmental 
problems (Adams et al., 2011; Gosney, Hammond, 
 
Shenkin, & Allsup, 2008; Kaplan, Rucklidge, Romijn, & 
Dolph, 2015; Rucklidge & Kaplan, 2013; Schlebusch 
et al., 2000; Stough et al., 2011). In the course of demon-
strating positive effects of micronutrient treatment for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults 
(Rucklidge, Frampton, Gorman, & Boggis, 2014) and chil-
dren (Gordon, Rucklidge, Blampied, & Johnstone, 2015) 
and for counteracting the psychological effects of a natu-
ral disaster (a major earthquake; Rucklidge et al., 2012; 
Rucklidge & Blampied, 2011), we encountered many 
anecdotal reports of a positive effect on insomnia, hence 
the research reported here.
The idea that micronutrient supplementation might 
benefit sleep is plausible and supported by a growing 
body of research. Kaplan and colleagues (Kaplan, 
 
Crawford, Field, & Simpson, 2007; Kaplan, Rucklidge, 
McLeod, & Romijn, 2015) have outlined several possible 
mechanisms that may explain how micronutrients 
improve psychological functioning and well-being in 
general, and possibly insomnia. Vitamins and minerals 
are well established as cofactors essential for the synthe-
sis and metabolism of neurotransmitters: For example, 
niacinamide (B3) assists the conversion of tryptophan to 
serotonin, and pyridoxal 5 phosphate (B6) is a cofactor in 
the synthesis of dopamine, GABA, and serotonin (Head 
& Kelly, 2009; Kaplan et al., 2007). Furthermore, the link 
between insomnia and stress is well established (Bootzin 
& Epstein, 2011; Wuyts et al., 2012), and vitamin and 
minerals are strongly involved in regulation of the stress 
response (Head & Kelly, 2009). Supplementation with 
nutrients may result in reductions in stress (Rucklidge 
et al., 2012) and thereby reduce insomnia. This may be 
especially important at times of high stress because such 
circumstances impose high nutritional needs (McCann & 
Ames, 2009) potentially impairing the maintenance of 
regular circadian rhythms, thereby adversely affecting 
sleep. Maintenance or restoration of adequate nutrition 
may, therefore, be particularly important for circadian 
rhythm recovery following stressful life events—a risk 
period for insomnia—and nutrient supplementation may 
be an effective option for treating anxiety and stress asso-
ciated with insomnia, given the strong evidence of the 
reciprocal link between them.
There is now considerable research supporting the 
efficacy of micronutrients in reducing stress in both 
stressed and nonstressed individuals (Carroll, Ring, Suter, 
& Willemsen, 2000; Kaplan, Rucklidge, Romijn, et al., 
2015; Kennedy et al., 2010; Rucklidge et al., 2012; 
 
Rucklidge, Johnstone, Harrison, & Boggis, 2011; 
 
Schlebusch et al., 2000; Stough et al., 2011; see Head & 
Kelly, 2009, for a review). Thus, given the wide range of 
psychological symptoms that have benefitted from micro-
nutrients and anecdotal reports of the benefit of micronu-
trients on sleep, it is plausible that insomnia may also 
resolve through the use of nutritional supplements. This 
study investigated the use of a commercial micronutrient 
formulation, Daily Self Defence (DSD), in a group of 
adults diagnosed with chronic insomnia using a single-
case, multiple-baseline-across-participants design as an 
open-label trial. DSD is a broad-spectrum formula devel-
oped for use by the general population; however, the 
composition and doses represent a revision of EMPower-
plus, the most studied nutrient combination for the treat-
ment of psychiatric symptoms (Popper, 2014). DSD 
contains all the B vitamins identified as being important 
for stress reduction (Table S1 in the Supplemental Mate-
rial available online provides a full list of ingredients). 
Data were analyzed with conventional single-case time-
series graphs and also with the Reliable Change Index 
(RCI; Jacobson & Truax, 1991) and effect size estimates 
(Lakens, 2013), consistent with a new statistics approach 
(Cumming, 2012, 2014; Klein, 2013).
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited in Christchurch, New Zea-
land, between January and November 2013 using adver-
tising on a university campus and Internet health forums 
and through community health services. Inclusion 
required participants to meet criteria for insomnia based 
on the Pittsburgh Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire 
(PISQ; see the discussion in the measures section), 
namely trouble either falling asleep or staying asleep at 
least three to four times per week; this difficulty having 
lasted at least 4 weeks; and the individual must have 
rated his or her sleep difficulty as affecting an area of his 
or her daily functioning at least “quite a bit.” In addition, 
severity of insomnia was measured using the PIRS (see 
the discussion in the measures section), and a cutoff 
score ≥ 98 was required for participation, thus identifying 
people with insomnia rated at least in the mild to moder-
ate range. Participants had to have been free of psychiat-
ric or sleep medications for at least 4 weeks. Additional 
exclusion factors (all assessed by self-report) were (a) 
sleep apnea, (b) pregnant/breastfeeding, (c) having a 
child under 2 years of age, (d) any neurological disorder 
involving brain or other central nervous system (CNS) 
 1114 
Lothian et al.
function (e.g., multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, epilepsy), 
(e) any serious medical condition for which major medi-
cal intervention was anticipated during the trial, (f) hav-
ing taken an oral antibiotic in the previous 6 weeks, plus 
(g) judged clinically to be at serious risk for suicide or 
violence upon review by a senior clinical psychologist 
(JJR). Criterion g resulted in the exclusion of one partici-
pant during baseline. Participants were not otherwise 
excluded based on the presence of a current psychiatric 
condition.
Of 51 people who completed the online screening 
questionnaire, 31 did not meet the PISQ and PIRS cutoff 
scores for insomnia and 3, who did meet these criteria, 
declined to participate, leaving 17 adults (age ≥ 18; 15 
female) with symptoms of insomnia as participants. A 
total of 14 completed the baseline phase and entered into 
the open-label treatment trial, and 12 (11 female) com-
pleted the entire trial (the flow of participants through 
the study is shown in Table S2 in the Supplemental Mate-
rials online). Mean age of the sample was 37.7 years 
(SD = 13.7), with the majority (86%) being of New Zea-
land European background. Two thirds were students; 
the other occupations listed were categorized as profes-
sional or semiprofessional. Three participants self-
reported that they had a current anxiety disorder. No 
other psychiatric disorders were disclosed.
Following a complete description of the experi-
mental nature of the trial, as well as a review of 
 
conventional treatments available, written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants. The study 
protocol was approved by the University of Canter-
bury Human Ethics Committee, and the trial was reg-
istered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials 
Registry (ACTRN12613000364774).
Measures
At baseline and at various points thereafter the partici-
pants completed the following measures online using 
QUALTRICS (www.qualtrics.com).
PIRS. PIRS is a 65-item self-report instrument used to 
assess severity of insomnia (Moul, Hall, Pilkonis, & 
Buysse, 2004; Moul, Pilkonis, Miewald, Carey, & Buysse, 
2002; Zubia, Ali, & Ejaz, 2014). Items ask about the past 
7 days, for example, “In the past week how much were 
you bothered by one or more awakenings after getting to 
sleep,” and responses range from 0 (not at all bothered) 
to 3 (severely bothered). A total score ≥ 130 identifies 
someone with “moderate” insomnia, and a score of 65 to 
130 identifies “mild” insomnia; the cutoff score of 98 is 
the midpoint between these two points. The RCI for the 
PIRS = 14.5 (calculated from data in Moul et al., 2004; 
Zubia et al., 2014). The correlation of the PIRS with the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was reported as .73 (Moul 
et al., 2002), and Cronbach’s α was .93 (Zubia et al., 
2014).
Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS, 
a 42-item questionnaire consisting of three self-report 
scales, was used to measure negative emotional states 
of depression, anxiety, and stress (P. F. Lovibond & 
 
Lovibond, 1995). Items ask about functioning or symp-
toms over the past week, for example, “Over the past 
week I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things,” 
rated 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me 
very much or most of the time; S. H. Lovibond & 
 
Lovibond, 1995). The RCI values were calculated as 
Depression = 4, Anxiety = 3, and Stress = 4, with clinical 
cutoff scores of 13, 9, and 18, respectively (from data in 
Crawford & Henry, 2003). The DASS Depression scale 
correlates with the Beck Depression Inventory in the 
range of .74 to .75 (Brown, Chorpita, Korotitsch, & 
 
Barlow, 1997; P. F. Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), the DASS 
Anxiety scale correlates with the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
in the range of .81 to .83 (Brown et al., 1997; P. F. 
 
Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), and the DASS Stress Scale 
correlates with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire at .60 
(Brown et al., 1997). Cronbach’s α was .96, .89, and .93 
for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress, respectively (Brown 
et al., 1997).
Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary for Morning 
(CSD-M). The CSD-M (Carney et al., 2012) was com-
pleted daily in baseline and intervention. Sufficient hard-
copies were provided to participants for the next phase 
at each laboratory visit. The CSD-M is an expanded ver-
sion of the Consensus Sleep Diary and has 10 items 
reporting on the preceding night’s sleep (e.g., time in 
bed, sleep onset latency, duration of total sleep time) 
plus questions about alcohol, caffeine, and sleep medica-
tion intake (Carney et al., 2012). It has a reading difficulty 
rated at the third grade level (Carney et al., 2012). The 
CSD-M does not appear to have been validated against 
objective measures of sleep such as polysomonography, 
but sleep diaries generally have been so validated 
 
(Carney et al., 2012).
PISQ. The PISQ was completed once only, at initial 
screening. It is a 13-item self-report instrument designed 
to establish a clinically relevant case definition of insom-
nia, using insomnia criteria taken from both the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th 
edition) and the International Classification of Sleep Dis-
orders (Okun et al., 2009). The PISQ assesses the pres-
ence, frequency, and severity of symptoms, e.g., “During 
the past month, how many nights or days per week have 
you had difficulty falling asleep?” and was used to 
 Insomnia and Micronutrients 
1115
determine the presence of insomnia. For Items 1 to 5, 
response options range from never to always (5–7 times 
per week). For Items 6 to 13, a Likert-type scale is used 
from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Cronbach’s α was .89, 
and the scale has diagnostic specificity > 90% (Okun 
et al., 2009).
Procedure
Once eligibility and informed consent was established, 
participants were randomly assigned to a baseline phase 
of 1, 2, or 3 weeks’ duration, followed by an 8-week 
treatment phase. Participants began completion of the 
CSD-M daily at the beginning of baseline and throughout 
intervention. They took six capsules of DSD (the manu-
facturer’s recommended daily dose) daily during the 
intervention phase as two doses of three capsules twice 
a day. Participants completed the PIRS and the DASS 
online at the beginning and end of baseline and weekly 
during the treatment phases.
Participants met in the laboratory with the researcher 
(JL) at the beginning of baseline and at the end of base-
line/beginning of intervention and then at intervention 
Weeks 4 and 8 and were given a $10 petrol voucher at 
each visit, the only financial incentive provided. At the 
intervention-phase visits, compliance was assessed and 
unused pills returned. Three months after completing the 
intervention phase, participants reported follow-up data 
by completing the DASS and PIRS online with reference 
to the preceding week and answering questions about 
whether they had chosen to continue taking the 
micronutrients.
Design and data analysis
The multiple-baseline design across participants (Kazdin, 
2010) provided for baseline assessment of sleep and 
well-being for 7 to 21 days and then a staggered entry 
into the treatment phase. The baseline phase permitted 
the stability of the measures to be assessed, different 
baseline durations permitted the detection of any cumu-
lative nonspecific effects of therapist attention and assess-
ment and the assessment of the magnitude of any 
regression to the mean, and the staggered entry into 
treatment permitted the replicated detection of changes 
when and only when treatment began.
The primary outcome measures defined a priori were 
the CSD-M and the PIRS. The CSD-M provided measures 
of sleep onset latency, frequency of night waking, total 
sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep 
quality. Individual changes in these variables across base-
line and intervention phases were analyzed using stan-
dard multiple-baseline time-series graphs. Percentage 
exceeding the median (PEM) was used as a single-case 
effect size (ES; Ma, 2006). For each variable, medians 
were calculated for each participant’s baseline phase and 
used to determine PEM in intervention, calculated as 
above or below the median to be consistent with the 
direction of therapeutic change (Ma, 2006; Parker, 
 
Vannest, & Davis, 2011). PEM was interpreted using the 
convention that 70% < PEM < 90% = a moderate ES and 
PEM > 90% = a large ES (Ma, 2009).
The PIRS provides information about the severity of 
a broad range of insomnia symptoms. Modified Brinley 
plots were used to analyze individual changes over time 
for the PIRS and for the secondary outcome measures of 
depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS). See Gordon 
et al. (2015), Jacobson and Truax (1991), and Rucklidge 
and Blampied (2011) for examples of these plots, termed 
modified Brinley plots because they show individual 
data rather than the group mean data presented by 
Brinley (1965) in his eponymously named plots. Modi-
fied Brinley plots show each individual participant’s 
score in any particular phase relative to another phase 
as a coordinate pair, with the earlier and later data 
points as the x-axis and y-axis values, respectively. 
When clinical cutoff lines and the boundaries of reliable 
change are displayed on the plot the direction (improve-
ment or deterioration), magnitude and clinical signifi-
cance of change over time can be classified as illustrated 
in Figure 1. A treatment effect is evident when scores 
deviate from the 45º diagonal line in the direction of 
positive change, that is, below the diagonal line for both 
the PIRS and DASS. Clinically significant change is 
shown when a participant’s data point lies outside the 
lower bound of both the RCI (reliable change set at p < 
.05; Jacobson & Truax, 1991) and below the clinical cut-
off for the measure.
For the PIRS and DASS, outcome was also judged using 
the ES measures Cohen’s drm and the common language 
effect size (CLES; Lakens, 2013). For the within-subjects 
design, drm adjusts the ES for the correlation between 
scores at each measurement time, and the CLES gives the 
likelihood (expressed as a percentage) that after control-
ling for individual differences any participant will have an 
improved score at the second measurement.
Results
Of the 51 individuals who were initially assessed, 34 did 
not meet eligibility criteria for sufficiently severe insom-
nia (n = 31) or withdrew (n = 3). Of the remaining 17, 
5 participants each were assigned 1- and 3-week base-
line periods, and all 10 completed the baseline and 
intervention phases. Seven were assigned a 2-week 
baseline, but only 2 completed baseline and interven-
tion, with exclusion (1) and drop-out (2) during base-
line due to perceived suicide risk and life stress, 
 1116 
Lothian et al.
respectively, and 2 dropping out during intervention 
due to headache and gastric side effects (1) and per-
ceived lack of efficacy (1). Of the 12 participants who 
began the intervention, 9 completed the follow-up 
questionnaires. Reported side effects among completers 
included mostly gastric and headache symptoms and 
were mild and transitory. Compliance with the interven-
tion was defined as consuming at least 80% of the total 
supplied capsules. Eight participants reported 100% 
capsule consumption, 2 missed three capsules, and 2 
missed consuming 10% of their capsules.
At the end of the intervention phase, complete data 
sets for the CSD-M and the PIRS and DASS had been 
supplied by 12 and 10 participants, respectively. The 
diary data were plotted for each participant each night 
as separate multiple-baseline time series (Cooper, Heron, 
& Heward, 2007) for each CSD-M variable. PEM, used to 
judge the outcomes of the intervention, showed (Table 
1) that 2 participants (P11 and P13) reported no substan-
tive effect of the intervention for any sleep diary mea-
sure. Of the rest, moderate to large effects were reported 
on sleep onset latency for 5 participants and on night 
waking and sleep quality by 6 participants. Nine partici-
pants reported moderate to large effects for total sleep 
time and sleep efficiency [sleep efficiency percentage 
 
(
%)
].

 ×100  Sleep efficiency is a com-
posite measure representing changes in both sleep 
latency and total sleep time (relative to total time in bed). 
Time-series data for all participants on this measure are 
shown in Figure 2. Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4 available in 
the Supplemental Materials online show time-series 
graphs for sleep latency, frequency of night waking, total 
sleep duration, and subjective sleep quality.
Conventionally, SE% < 85% is regarded as problematic 
(Spielman, Saskin, & Thorpy, 1987), and this threshold is 
shown in Figure 2 as a horizontal line. Only 3 partici-
pants (P1, P2, & P6) were at or above this criterion in 
baseline; these participants nevertheless showed a posi-
tive effect of intervention in that variability in SE% was 
reduced whereas high levels of SE% were maintained. 
Participants P3, P7, P9, and P14 showed positive changes 
in the level and trend of their data within the first 7 days 
of treatment, whereas P4 and P10 improved more gradu-
ally. Of the 3 who did not show substantive improve-
ment overall, P8 had baseline SE% between 80% and 
85% and maintained this in the intervention phase, and 
P11 often achieved SE% above 85% from about halfway 
through intervention; only P13 showed no beneficial 
effects of treatment on SE%. Taken together, the time-
series data summarized in Table 1 and exemplified in 
Figure 2 show that 11 out of 12 participants (90%; 65% 
on an intent-to-treat basis) experienced positive effects 
on one or more aspects of nightly sleep following treat-
ment with micronutrients.
Figure 3 summarizes the effects of micronutrient treat-
ment on insomnia symptoms as measured by the PIRS 
and the DASS. Figure 3a addresses the question of the 
stability of insomnia symptoms in baseline, and shows 
that, relative to their initial PIRS score, participants 
showed little change when PIRS scores were remeasured 
after 1, 2, or 3 baseline weeks. Three participants, all 
from the 3-week baseline group, reduced their PIRS score 
to at or just below the clinical cutoff, but for one of these 
the change was not reliable (i.e., did not fall below the 
lower RCI limit). Given that the baseline was stable, each 
participant was assigned a mean baseline PIRS score for 
further analysis, shown in Figures 3b and 3c.
Figure 3b tracks each individual’s change over time 
across each week of the intervention phase. Also shown 
for each week is Cohen’s drm and the CLES, indicating the 
percentage of improvement. Relative to the degree of 
change shown over up to 3 baseline weeks, the change 
evident after 1 week of treatment is substantial, with five 
participants showing reliable clinical change (i.e., below 
the clinical cutoff and outside the lower RCI limit). By 
Week 4 all participants showed reliable clinical change, 
with large ESs. From this week on the pattern of improve-
ment remained relatively stable, with participants show-
ing either moderate change or substantial change relative 
to their mean baseline score. Note also that from Week 3, 
the 95% CI on the y-axis mean does not cut either the 
Fig. 1. This template illustrates key features of a modified Brinley 
plot. In each plot the solid diagonal line marks the line of no effect. 
The dashed diagonal lines show the upper and lower boundaries of 
the Reliable Change Index (RCI). Vertical and horizontal lines mark 
the clinical cutoffs for each measure. Where the direction of clinical 
improvement is a reduction in the measure (indicated by the arrowhead 
on the vertical clinical cutoff line) the zones on the graph formed by 
the intersections of the line of no effect and the clinical cutoffs can be 
interpreted as shown. The upper and lower boundaries of the RCI can 
be used to determine if change is significantly (p < .05) larger than that 
expected by measurement error alone.

lower bound of the RCI nor the clinical cutoff, meaning 
that from this point on the mean response was clearly in 
the nonclinical range. Figure 3c shows that this individual 
and group improvement was sustained at follow-up, even 
though at that point only one participant (shown as a 
filled circle in Fig. 3c) continued to take micronutrients; 
the others desisted largely due to cost and difficulties 
with supply. Figure 3d (after Stunkard & Penick, 1979) 
shows change at follow-up relative to status at the end of 
treatment, and reveals that most individuals deteriorated 
slightly during the follow-up period, although they all 
remained in the nonclinical range.
Changes in depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms 
are shown in Figure 3e. An analysis of changes over 
baseline (comparable to Fig. 3a; see Fig. S6 in the Supple-
mental Materials available online) showed that depres-
sion and anxiety were stable over baseline and that only 
three participants were above the clinical cutoff. Partici-
pants’ stress was also stable in baseline, but scores clus-
tered closely about the cutoff (initial baseline stress M = 
17, SD = 3.5). Figure 3e shows change at Week 8 relative 
to initial baseline assessment, where the variability was 
slightly higher and thus the individual data points are 
somewhat more dispersed on the x-axis, making the 
graph easier to interpret (the pattern of data shown 
would change very little if mean baseline scores had 
been used instead). Depression, anxiety, and stress all 
reduced to nonclinical levels by Week 8 of treatment, 
except for one participant whose depression was reliably 
improved but remained just above the clinical cutoff. 
These improvements were largely maintained at follow-
up, except for three participants whose anxiety and stress 
had returned to clinical levels. Figures S5 and S6 in the 
Supplemental Material available online show respectively 
changes in insomnia severity (PIRS) as a function of the 
multiple-baseline design, and changes in depression, 
anxiety, and stress (DASS) over time.
Given that micronutrients had a large mean effect on 
stress (Cohen’s d = 2.53) and that there is a well-estab-
lished link between insomnia and stress, is it possible 
that changes in insomnia were in response to the reduc-
tion in stress? This was examined by calculating for 
each individual each week an improvement score for 
both insomnia symptoms and stress and taking the 
average improvement each week. The improvement 
score is the difference between the weekly score and 
the mean baseline standardized by the standard devia-
tion in baseline. At Week 1 the mean scores for insom-
nia and stress were equal, respectively 3.14 and 3.07. 
Thereafter, improvement in insomnia always outpaced 
stress, so that by Week 4 the mean scores were respec-
tively 6.16 and 4.12, and 9.46 and 5.27 at Week 8. This 
does not support the idea that changes in insomnia 
were a consequence of stress reduction because if that 
were the case we would expect stress to have improved 
first, with insomnia improvement being delayed until 
later in treatment. Figure S7 in the Supplemental Mate-
rial available online shows changes in individual and 
weekly mean improvement scores over the 8 weeks of 
treatment.

 Insomnia and Micronutrients

Discussion
This study investigated an innovative intervention for the 
treatment of insomnia in adults over an 8-week period by 
having participants consume a broad-spectrum micronu-
trient formula. No psychological therapy was provided. 
This was associated with improvements in insomnia 
symptoms, mood, stress, and anxiety during the trial. 
Specifically, the group mean insomnia severity rating (as 
measured by the PIRS) dropped from 109.8 at baseline to 
40.33 with large ES (Cohen’s d = 3.45, CLES 99%). The 
reliability of this result was further supported by 100% of 
completing participants showing reliable positive change 
(Jacobson & Truax, 1991), indicating that this treatment 
effect is unlikely to be due to measurement error.
Improvement in insomnia symptoms was also 
observed based on the daily sleep diaries in that 5 out of 
12 (42%) participants who completed treatment showed 
a moderate or large treatment effect on measures of sleep 
onset latency, 6 (50%) showed a moderate or large treat-
ment effect on frequency of night waking, and 9 (75%) 
showed a moderate or large treatment effect on total 
sleep duration. Daily sleep diary data also confirmed that 
9 (75%) treatment completers also showed a moderate or

 Insomnia and Micronutrients

large treatment effect on sleep efficiency and 6 (50%) 
showed a moderate or large treatment effect on subjec-
tive sleep quality. Micronutrient consumption was also 
associated with reduction in levels of stress, anxiety, and 
depression, with effects sizes all being classified as large 
(>.8), and the CLES all >50%. These findings are consis-
tent with other research trials showing that micronutri-
ents improve psychological functioning such as mood 
and anxiety (Gosney et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2011).
Intervention with the micronutrient supplement was 
associated with generally mild side effects, showing that 
micronutrients have a minimal side effect profile when 
compared with pharmacological treatments, which is 
consistent with other adult studies (Rucklidge et al., 2012; 
Rucklidge et al., 2014). Of the 12 completing participants, 
all were compliant with the treatment protocol.
Although the exact causes of an individual’s insomnia 
undoubtedly vary, the majority of research identifies 
heightened arousal, anxiety, worry, and rumination as 
being leading factors in sleep disruption (Bootzin & 
Epstein, 2011). Events that are emotionally stressful have 
been found to impact sleep quality and well-being, 
and are believed to do so through triggering cortical 
and emotional arousal (Wuyts et al., 2012). Anxious-
ruminative personality traits, life stressors, homeostasis-
weakening mechanisms, and CNS hyperarousal have all 
been identified as additional factors (Basta, Chrousos, 
Vela-Bueno, & Vgontzas, 2007). It is therefore plausible 
that through enhancement of the synthesis and activity of 
neurotransmitters and the continuous availability of an 
abundance of micronutrients, CNS hyperarousal may be 
reduced and the individual’s ability to process emotional 
stress may be enhanced (Kaplan & Leung, 2011; McCann 
& Ames, 2009). It is notable that the most consistent 
effect of micronutrients on the DASS measures was on 
reported levels of stress, which fits with the known recip-
rocal link between stress and insomnia (Bootzin & 
Epstein, 2011; Wuyts et al., 2012). Reduction in stress, 
however, did not directly mediate the improvement in 
sleep, as sleep improved more rapidly than did stress 
after the first treatment week.
The open-label nature of the trial and the lack of pla-
cebo control are both limitations to this study, although 
the multiple-baseline design controlled for nonspecific 
therapy effects, such as regular therapeutic input, contact 
with the therapist, and repeated assessment of symp-
toms, and the stability of symptoms in baseline precludes 
an explanation in terms of regression-to-the-mean effects. 
Both the participant and researcher were aware that they 
were in active intervention, and this can make both par-
ties susceptible to expectancy effects, although most par-
ticipants showed some delay in treatment response after 
beginning the nutrient intervention, and even those who 
showed an initial improvement mostly showed only a 
small effect, which increased in size the longer the indi-
vidual was taking the micronutrients. Furthermore, the 
ESs observed were substantially larger than those 
reported for placebo conditions in a meta-analysis 
 
(Grissom, 1996). Multiple-baseline designs can incorpo-
rate placebo control and blinding of participants and 
researchers (France, Blampied, & Wilkinson, 1999), and 
this should be done in future research.
Spontaneous remission of symptoms must also be con-
sidered; however, given that a majority of participants 
experienced a therapeutic effect despite experiencing 
chronic insomnia, it is unlikely that spontaneous remission 
is responsible for the positive effect observed. Also, the 
pattern of change observed, that is, generally stable base-
lines with improvements evident only during the interven-
tion phase, makes spontaneous remission of symptoms an 
unlikely explanation for the benefits observed.
As many people seek alternative treatments for insom-
nia and other mental health difficulties because of the lim-
ited availability and financial costs of psychotherapy and 
the side effects and long-term impact of conventional 
pharmacotherapy, further options for treating these diffi-
culties deserve exploration (Rucklidge & Kaplan, 2013). 
This study was designed to detect an intervention effect 
(Haig, 2014) rather than test hypotheses about potential 
mechanisms of action of micronutrients, hence metabolic 
levels of vitamins and minerals were not measured, 
although it would be desirable to do so in any future stud-
ies. Further research should initially attempt a direct repli-
cation with placebo control to establish the reliability and 
replicability of the research findings. Randomized con-
trolled trials, reversal trials, and effectiveness trials (where 
the intervention is tested in a clinical environment) could 
all be used to systematically establish the replicability of 
the effect found in the study. Generality should be explored 
through systematic replication, where various attributes of 
the participants (e.g., age, gender) or of the treatment 
(e.g., formulation, dosage, length of intervention) are sys-
tematically varied, and the effect on the treatment out-
come is examined. Also, because the participants were 
primarily women, we cannot confidently determine 
whether the results would apply equally to men.
Only one individual stayed on the micronutrients for 
the follow-up period, and therefore we could not estab-
lish if there was any long-term benefit of continuing with 
micronutrients. Reasons stated for not continuing taking 
micronutrients included cost, access, and life stress. The 
follow-up period, therefore, became a natural reversal 
design and showed that the majority of participants 
 
demonstrated some deterioration back toward baseline, 
although this was still only moderate after 3 months. As 
with pharmacotherapy, the current research of micronu-
trients has not yet systematically documented their long-
term safety over years and decades (Rucklidge & Kaplan, 
 1122 
Lothian et al.
2013) although there are naturalistic reports of continued 
benefit over years with no adverse effects (Simpson et al., 
2011). That the formula provided nutrients above the rec-
ommended daily allowance (RDA) may be of concern for 
some; however, although the RDA is well established as 
identifying levels required to prevent a frank nutritional 
deficiency, it may not be applicable for the treatment of 
psychological symptoms or for ensuring optimal func-
tioning (Benton, 2013). The specified upper limit of con-
sumption for a nutrient is the more important marker 
than the RDA for ensuring safety. Trialing longer inter-
vention phases and varying doses would be useful to 
investigate under which conditions the therapeutic effect 
plateaus and to determine the dose-response relation-
ship. It is certainly plausible that the optimum therapeu-
tic dose varies between individuals, and perhaps some 
would respond better at a higher dose than used in the 
current study.
