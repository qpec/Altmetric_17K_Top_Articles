Objective. To investigate the efficacy and safety
of lesinurad in combination with febuxostat in a 12-
month phase III trial in patients with tophaceous gout.
Methods. Patients
with
serum
urate
(UA)
‡8.0 mg/dl (‡6.0 mg/dl with urate-lowering therapy)
and ‡1 measurable target tophus were given febuxo-
stat 80 mg/day for 3 weeks before randomization to
receive lesinurad (200 or 400 mg daily) or placebo in
addition to the febuxostat. The primary end point was
the proportion of patients achieving a serum UA level
of <5.0 mg/dl (month 6). The key secondary end point
was the proportion of patients with complete resolu-
tion of ‡1 target tophus (month 12). Other end points
included the percentage change in total target tophi
area. Safety assessments included adverse events and
laboratory data.
Results. Patients (n 5 324) were predominantly
male, with a mean age of 54.1 years. Significantly more
patients achieved the serum UA target by month 6 with
the addition of lesinurad 400 mg (76.1%; P < 0.0001),
but not 200 mg (56.6%; P 5 0.13), to the febuxostat ther-
apy as compared with febuxostat alone (46.8%). At all
other time points, significantly more patients in the
lesinurad 200 mg group achieved the serum UA target.
The number of patients with complete tophus resolu-
tion was not different between groups. Treatment with
lesinurad (200 mg and 400 mg) plus febuxostat reduced
the total target tophi area as compared with febuxostat
alone (50.1% and 52.9% versus 28.3%, respectively;
P < 0.05). Safety was generally comparable with that of
febuxostat alone, except for higher rates of predomi-
nantly reversible elevations in the serum creatinine
level, particularly with lesinurad 400 mg.
Conclusion. Treatment with lesinurad in combi-
nation with febuxostat demonstrated superior lowering

 of serum UA levels as compared with febuxostat alone,
with clinically relevant added effects on tophi and an
acceptable safety profile with lesinurad 200 mg in
patients with tophaceous gout warranting additional
therapy.
Current rheumatology guidelines for long-term
treatment of gout recommend maintenance of serum
urate (UA) levels of ,6.0 mg/dl or ,5.0 mg/dl in
patients with greater disease severity through a combi-
nation of lifestyle management and pharmacotherapy
(1–3). The recommended first-line urate-lowering ther-
apy is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, either allopurinol or
febuxostat (1,2), to inhibit urate production (4). How-
ever, in clinical trials, only ;40% of patients treated
with allopurinol 300 mg/day achieved serum UA levels
that were ,6.0 mg/dl (5–8). With febuxostat 80 mg/day,
67–75% of patients achieved a serum UA level of
,6.0 mg/dl (5,7–9), but only 48% were able to sustain it
for 3 consecutive months (8). If target serum UA levels
cannot be achieved with an appropriate dose of xanthine
oxidase
inhibitor,
treatment
guidelines
recommend
adding a uricosuric agent to the xanthine oxidase inhibi-
tor (1,2).
Lesinurad is a novel selective urate anion reab-
sorption inhibitor approved in the US and Europe for
the treatment of gout in combination with a xanthine
oxidase inhibitor for patients in whom target levels of
serum UA are not achieved with a xanthine oxidase
inhibitor (10). Lesinurad inhibits the uric acid trans-
porter URAT1, which is responsible for most reabsorp-
tion of urate anion from the renal tubule (11). By
inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases the excretion of
uric acid and lowers the serum UA level (12). There-
fore, lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase
inhibitor provides a dual mechanism of action for lower-
ing serum UA levels by increasing renal excretion of
uric acid and reducing urate production (13,14).
A phase Ib clinical study of lesinurad plus febux-
ostat demonstrated greater reduction in serum UA lev-
els than febuxostat alone (12). The aims of the current
phase III study were to examine the benefits and risks of
lesinurad (200 mg or 400 mg oral, once daily) in combi-
nation with febuxostat 80 mg in patients with topha-
ceous gout.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients.
Men or women (ages 18–85 years; body
mass index ,45 kg/m2) with a diagnosis of gout according to
the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (15)
were eligible for the study. Eligible patients included those
receiving urate-lowering therapy currently or in the past as
well as those who had never taken a urate-lowering drug.
Serum UA levels were required to be $8.0 mg/dl in patients
not taking urate-lowering therapy and $6.0 mg/dl in those tak-
ing urate-lowering therapy. The presence of $1 measurable
tophus on the hands/wrists and/or feet/ankles that was $5 mm
and #20 mm in the longest diameter (length), as measured
using Vernier calipers (16), was required for study entry.
Exclusion criteria included an estimated creatinine
clearance of ,30 ml/minute, as calculated via the Cockcroft-
Gault formula using ideal body weight. A history of kidney
stones was not an exclusion criterion. Complete inclusion/
exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Table 1
(available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract) and were
similar to those used in recent trials of hyperuricemia and gout
treatments.
Trial design.
Treatment procedures. The Combina-
tion Treatment Study in Subjects with Subcutaneous Topha-
ceous Gout with Lesinurad and Febuxostat (CRYSTAL) was a
phase III multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled combination study evaluating the efficacy
and safety of lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg orally in combina-
tion with febuxostat 80 mg orally compared with placebo in
combination with febuxostat 80 mg (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01510769). The study, which was conducted in North
America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, included an
;35-day screening period (including a run-in period of ;21
days), a 12-month double-blind treatment period, and a follow-
up period of #3.5 months (Supplementary Figure 1, avail-
ableathttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract).
Regardless of urate-lowering therapy type at screening, all patients
began febuxostat 80 mg once daily as the sole urate-lowering
therapy along with gout flare prophylaxis on day 221. Gout
flare prophylaxis consisted of colchicine (0.5 or 0.6 mg once
daily, per protocol, and as locally available) or a nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) if patients had an intolerance/
contraindication to colchicine. Gout flare prophylaxis was contin-
ued through month 5 unless patients became intolerant or devel-
oped toxicity to prophylaxis.
After 3 weeks of febuxostat 80 mg treatment, patients
were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo plus febuxostat
80 mg, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat 80 mg, or lesinurad
400 mg plus febuxostat 80 mg. Randomization at all study sites
used a centralized Interactive Voice Response System/Interac-
tive Web Response System.
Doses of febuxostat, lesinurad, or placebo were taken
once daily in the morning with food and 1 cup of water.
Patients were encouraged to drink 2 liters of fluid/day and to
remain well hydrated, consistent with the American College of
Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout (1).
Compliance with study medication was assessed using the
medication
dispensing
records,
with
verification
of
the
returned medication packaging and any remaining medication
during each study visit. Concomitant medication use was re-
corded at each study visit.
The study was conducted in accordance with Indepen-
dent Ethics Committee E6, Good Clinical Practice, the Decla-
ration of Helsinki (October 2008), and all applicable local
regulatory requirements. Patients were permitted to withdraw
from treatment or from the study at any time. The study was
conducted between February 2012 and April 2014.

 Evaluations. The primary efficacy end point was the
proportion of patients in each treatment group with a serum
UA level of ,5.0 mg/dl by month 6. Secondary serum UA effi-
cacy end points included mean serum UA levels recorded at
each visit. Prespecified sensitivity and supportive analyses
included the proportion of patients with the following 3 condi-
tions: 1) serum UA level of ,5.0 mg/dl at the 4-, 5-, and
6-month assessments; 2) serum UA levels of ,5.0, ,4.0, and
,3.0 mg/dl at each monthly visit; and 3) a median serum UA
level of ,5.0 mg/dl, as well as the proportion of patients with a
serum UA level .5.0 mg/dl at baseline and ,5.0 mg/dl by
month 6.
Key secondary end points were the proportion of
patients with complete resolution (100% decrease in the area
of a tophus) of $1 target tophus by month 12 and the propor-
tion of patients with a best tophus response for $1 target
tophus of complete or partial ($50% decrease in area) resolu-
tion by month 12. An additional tophus end point was the
mean percentage change from baseline in the sum of the areas
of all target tophi at each visit. Tophi were measured using dig-
ital calipers to capture both the longest diameter (length) and
longest perpendicular measurement.
Other secondary end points included the proportion
of patients with gout flares requiring treatment at each
month and the mean rate of gout flares from the end of
month 6 to the end of month 12. Gout flares were reported
using a daily electronic patient diary (e-diary) that elicited
the duration and extent of pain, the presence of warmth,
swelling, and tenderness, and any change in medication used
to treat the flare.
Serum UA levels were determined at baseline (day 1),
week 2, and months 1–6, 8, 10, and 12. Tophi were measured
every 3 months.
Safety assessments included treatment-emergent ad-
verse events (TEAEs; coded according to the Medical Dictio-
nary for Regulatory Activities version 14.0), clinical laboratory
data, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram results,
and vital signs. Adverse events (AEs) of special interest
included renal and cardiovascular (CV) safety assessments.
Renal
safety
assessments
were
included
because
renal
impairment is a common comorbid condition in patients with
gout (17). Renal safety is of special interest because of the
increased uric acid excretion caused by lesinurad. Increases
in urinary uric acid excretion have the potential to induce
microcrystallization of uric acid in renal tubules and/or the
urinary system (18), which could manifest clinically as kidney
stones and/or changes in kidney function. Assessments of
renal safety included renal-related and kidney stone TEAEs
(Supplementary Table 2, available at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract) and clinical labora-
tory findings including the serum creatinine level, the urinary
protein-to-creatinine ratio, and the estimated creatinine
clearance.
Review of CV safety was conducted by an indepen-
dent Cardiovascular Events Adjudication Committee. AEs
were routinely assessed for a potential CV relationship,
with categorization into major adverse CV event (MACE)
and non-MACE end points (Supplementary Table 3, avail-
able at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/
abstract) (19).
Patients who completed the double-blind treatment
were eligible to enroll in an extension study of lesinurad plus
febuxostat. Patients who did not enter the extension study
completed a follow-up visit within 14 days of completing the
double-blind treatment.
Statistical analysis.
The study consisted of a 12-
month treatment period, with the primary end point evaluated
at month 6 and key secondary end points evaluated at month
12. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with
serum UA levels of ,5.0 mg/dl by month 6. All randomized
patients who received $1 dose of randomized study medica-
tion were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the
primary population for efficacy and safety assessments. Com-
parisons of response rates based on serum UA levels between
each lesinurad group and the febuxostat plus placebo group
were performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test
statistic, stratified according to renal function on day 27
(estimated
creatinine
clearance
$60
ml/minute
versus
,60 ml/minute) and serum UA level on day 27 ($6.0 versus
,6.0 mg/dl). A Bonferroni correction was used for the pri-
mary end point for each of the 2 treatment comparisons
with placebo at an alpha level of 0.025. Results for serum
UA response were expressed as proportions, corresponding
adjusted 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the differ-
ence between response rates, and P values. Nonresponder
imputation analysis was the primary analysis method, in
which patients who were missing their month 6 serum UA
result were considered nonresponders. If the null hypothesis
for the primary end point for 1 dose was rejected at the
0.025 level, hierarchical testing of the key secondary end
points for the surviving dose was performed at an alpha
level of 0.025.
All other efficacy end points were evaluated at the
level of a 5 0.05 (nominal P value), 2-sided without adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons. For the primary analyses of
response rates at each level, nonresponder imputation was
used for all visits. Secondary end points were analyzed by neg-
ative binomial regression (gout flares) or Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test (tophus response). Mean rates of gout flares
were adjusted for day 27 renal function and serum UA level
and duration of exposure to randomized study medication.
Safety data were listed by treatment group and were
not subjected to statistical hypothesis testing. TEAEs were
coded by system organ class and preferred term and were
listed according to the incidence, severity, relation to study
medication, and relation to discontinuation. Baseline serum
creatinine was defined as the highest value within 14 days prior
to the first dose of study medication. The relative increase in
serum creatinine levels (i.e., $1.5 times and $2.0 times the
baseline level at any time) was selected as the most clinically
relevant assessment (20,21). Resolution of serum creatinine
elevation was defined as a serum creatinine value that
returned to #1.2 times baseline.
Approximately 315 patients were planned to be re-
cruited, for an allocation of ;105 to each treatment group.
This sample size was calculated to provide .90% power to
detect a difference in response rates between treatment groups
if the placebo group had a 40% response rate and the
lesinurad groups had response rates as low as 65% using
Fisher’s exact test and adjusting for multiplicity with an alpha
level of 0.025, 2-sided, for each test.

1905
 RESULTS
Patient disposition. Of 1,045 patients screened,
330 were randomized at 102 study sites (Figure 1). The
remaining 715 patients were withdrawn prior to ran-
domization, including 667 screening failures and 48 who
withdrew consent. Of the reasons for the screening
failures, 443 were related to the inclusion criteria, 168 to
the exclusion criteria, 48 to both the inclusion/exclusion
criteria, and 8 to other. A total of 324 patients
received $1 dose of randomized study medication. A
total of 74 patients (22.8%) withdrew from the
study prior to completion: 20.2% of all patients in the
febuxostat group, 25.5% in the lesinurad 200 mg plus
febuxostat group, and 22.9% in the lesinurad 400 mg
plus febuxostat group. The most common reasons
were TEAEs (10.5%) and noncompliance/protocol
violation (9.0%). Study medication was completed by
86.2%, 82.1%, and 80.7% of patients in the respective
groups at 6 months and by 76.1%, 71.7%, and 69.7%,
respectively, at 12 months.
Baseline
demographics
and
clinical
history.
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were
similar between treatment groups (Table 1). Patients
were predominantly male (95.4%) and white (79.9%),
with a mean 6 SD age of 54.1 6 11.0 years, and a
mean 6 SD time since gout diagnosis of 14.7 6 10.9
years. Mean 6 SD serum UA levels were 8.7 6 1.6 mg/dl
at screening and 5.3 6 1.6 mg/dl at randomization (base-
line), after 3 weeks of treatment with febuxostat 80 mg.
At baseline, the mean 6 SD number of tophi was
1.8 6 1.2, and the mean 6 SD area of target tophi was
293.6 6 234.6 mm2. Patients reported the occurrence of
a mean 6 SD of 6.7 6 8.2 gout flares in the 12 months
prior to study entry.
Compliance with study medications. The over-
all proportion of patients demonstrating $80% compli-
ance with the study medications was 99.1%, 97.2%, and
92.7% in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxo-
stat, and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups,
respectively.
Efficacy assessments. Primary end point of serum
UA response and secondary serum UA end points. The
proportion of patients who achieved a serum UA level
of ,5.0 mg/dl by month 6 was 46.8% in the febuxostat
group, 56.6% in the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat
group, and 76.1% in the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxo-
stat group (Figure 2). Significantly
more patients
treated with lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat achieved
the primary end point compared with febuxostat alone
(P , 0.0001), while the difference was not significant for
the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat group (P 5 0.13).

 The mean serum UA levels by visit are shown in
Figure 3. Although the difference in serum UA levels
was
not
statistically
significantly
different
for
the
lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat group by month 6,
superior treatment effects were observed for this group
at all other time points assessed (months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,
10, and 12; P # 0.0281). In addition, prespecified sensi-
tivity and supporting analyses showed differences favor-
ing lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat versus febuxostat
alone (Supplementary Figure 2, available at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract).
These included achieving serum UA levels that were
,5.0 mg/dl for each of 3 consecutive months (months 4,
5, and 6), a median serum UA level of ,5.0 mg/dl, and
a serum UA level of ,4.0 and ,3.0 mg/dl (Figure 2
shows months 6 and 12).
Included in the prespecified analyses was the
subgroup of patients with serum UA levels $5.0 mg/dl
after 3 weeks of febuxostat treatment (n 5 161 [49.7%]).
In this subgroup, 23.5% of patients were at goal by
month 6 with febuxostat treatment alone, 44.1% with
lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat, and 70.6% with
lesinurad
400
mg
plus
febuxostat
(P 5 0.024
and
P , 0.0001 versus febuxostat alone). The proportion of
patients who achieved a serum UA level of ,5.0 mg/dl
was greater in both lesinurad plus febuxostat groups

(Supplementary Figure 3, available at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract). Also, more
patients achieved a serum UA level of ,4.0 mg/dl by
month 6 with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat (28.8%,
P 5 0.005) and
lesinurad

(56.9%, P , 0.0001) than with febuxostat (7.8%).
Key secondary and secondary end points. Tophus
resolution. The proportion of subjects with complete res-
olution of $1 target tophus was numerically greater in
both the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat (25.5%) and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat (30.3%) groups com-
pared with the febuxostat group (21.1%), although the
differences were not statistically significant (P 5 0.45 and
P 5 0.11, respectively). The proportion of patients with
complete or partial resolution of $1 target tophus also
was numerically greater in the lesinurad 200 mg plus
febuxostat (49.1%) and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat
(51.4%) groups compared with the febuxostat group
(45.9%) at month 12, but the differences were not
significant.
At months 3, 6, 9, and 12 when tophi were mea-
sured, each of the lesinurad plus febuxostat treatment
groups had a higher mean percentage reduction from
baseline in the sum of the areas of all target tophi as
compared with febuxostat alone (Figure 4). At month
12, a 50.1% and 52.9% reduction in target tophi area
was observed with the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat
and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups, respec-
tively,
compared
with
febuxostat

(28.3%)
(P , 0.05 and P , 0.01, respectively).
Gout flares requiring treatment.
The mean 6 SD
rates of gout flares requiring treatment over the
6-month period from the end of month 6 to the end of
month 12 were 1.2 6 2.7, 1.4 6 2.5, and 0.7 6 1.2 per
patient per 6 months in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg
plus febuxostat, and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat
groups, respectively (P 5 0.55 and P 5 0.04 versus febux-
ostat alone). The proportion of patients with gout flares
requiring treatment at the end of month 1 was higher in
both lesinurad plus febuxostat groups (25.5% in those
taking 200 mg and 35.8% in those taking 400 mg) than
the febuxostat group
(17.4%).
The
proportion
of
patients with gout flares requiring treatment generally
declined throughout the study, with the lowest propor-
tions at the end of month 11 to the end of month 12
(9.2% in those taking febuxostat, 10.1% in those taking

Adverse events. The pro-
portion of patients with TEAEs throughout the study
was 72.5% in the febuxostat group, 82.1% in the
lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat group, and 82.6% in
the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat group (Table 2).
The majority of patients in each group had TEAEs with
maximum severity of grade 1 or 2, based on the Rheu-
matology Common Toxicity Criteria (22). TEAEs led to
discontinuation of study medication in 8.3%, 8.5%, and
13.8% of patients in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg
plus febuxostat, and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat
groups,
respectively.
The
most
common
individual
TEAEs in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxo-
stat, and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups,
respectively, were nasopharyngitis (8.3%, 9.4%, and
13.8%), hypertension (7.3%, 5.7%, and 11.0%), head-
ache (7.3%, 9.4%, and 5.5%), extremity pain (3.7%,
5.7%, and 8.3%), and back pain (4.6%, 7.5%, and 5.5%).

 febuxostat group, and 8.3% in the lesinurad 400 mg
plus febuxostat group (Table 2). No single serious TEAE
occurred in .1 patient. One death was reported in the
lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat group (due to cardiac
arrest) and 1 in the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat
group (due to congestive heart failure).
Renal safety analyses. Renal-related AEs occurred
in 5.5% of patients in the febuxostat group, 8.5% in the
lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat group, and 10.1% in
the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat group (Table 2).
No patients in the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat
group had a renal-related serious AE, while 2 patients
in the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat group (1.8%;
renal failure acute; renal failure chronic) and 1 patient
in the febuxostat group (0.9%; acute renal failure) had
renal-related serious AEs.* All were considered by the
investigator to be either unlikely to be related or unre-
lated to the study medication. Kidney stone TEAEs
were reported in 3.7%, 0.9%, and 1.8% of the patients
in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat, and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups, respectively.
Elevations in the serum creatinine level $1.5
times the baseline values occurred in 2.8% (n 5 3),
4.7% (n 5 5), and 10.1% (n 5 11) of patients in the
febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat, and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups, respectively. A
total of 100%, 60%, and 85.7% of cases resolved with-
out interruption in study medication. Elevations in the
serum creatinine level $2.0 times baseline occurred
in 0.0%, 2.8% (n 5 3), and 5.5% (n 5 6) of the respec-
tive groups. There was only 1 unresolved elevation
in both the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups at the last study
assessment.
Mean 6 SD changes in the serum creatinine lev-
els between baseline and the last assessment were
0.00 6 0.19, 0.03 6 0.18, and 20.09 6 0.21 mg/dl in the
febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat, and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups, respectively.
There were no clinically meaningful changes in the mean
estimated creatinine clearance or protein-to-creatinine
ratio (Supplementary Table 4, available at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40159/abstract).
Cardiovascular safety analyses. TEAEs classified
as CV events were reported in 1.8%, 5.7%, and 3.7% of
patients in the febuxostat, lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxo-
stat, and lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat groups,
respectively, with serious CV events in 0.9%, 2.8%, and
3.7%, respectively. All patients reporting CV events had
$1 baseline CV comorbidity and/or CV disease history.
The Cardiovascular Events Adjudication Committee
determined that criteria for MACE were met by 1
patient (1 event) in the febuxostat group, 2 patients
(2 events) in the lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat, and 2
patients (4 events) in the lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxo-
stat. Non-MACE CV end points were reported in 0
patients, 2 patients (2 events), and 2 patients (3 events),
respectively. There were no notable changes from base-
line in electrocardiography parameters in any group.
Findings of other clinical laboratory tests and
vital signs.
Clinical laboratory test results, including
hematology, serum chemistry (excluding renal labora-
tory results reported above), and urinalysis, assessed
over time demonstrated no notable differences between
treatment groups. There were no notable changes in
vital signs, including blood pressure, from baseline dur-
ing the study in any group.
DISCUSSION
The CRYSTAL trial investigated the efficacy
and safety of lesinurad in combination with febuxostat
in patients with tophaceous gout. Lesinurad, 200 mg or
400 mg, in combination with febuxostat 80 mg increased
the proportions of patients achieving a serum UA
level of ,5.0 mg/dl by month 6 (the primary end point)
compared with febuxostat alone. The difference in
proportions was significant only for the lesinurad
400 mg group. However, additional prespecified analy-
ses showed that lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat was
effective in more patients reaching the target serum UA
level.
More importantly, in the prespecified analysis of
the subset of patients with a baseline serum UA level of
$5 mg/dl (i.e., those not at target after 3 weeks of febux-
ostat alone), the addition of lesinurad 200 mg enabled
more patients to achieve serum UA levels of ,5 mg/dl
at all time points through month 12, including month 6.
This is a clinically meaningful result because this is the
group of patients with the greatest need for additional
treatment options, as they failed to respond to febuxo-
stat 80 mg, the highest dose of febuxostat approved in
the US.
Some patients in the study achieved serum UA
levels of ,3 mg/dl. The clinical benefits and risks of
these very low serum urate levels are currently uncer-
tain. Although both clinical trial data and observational
studies have shown benefit in flare reduction and tophus
regression with very low serum urate concentrations
(16,23), the European League Against Rheumatism has

DALBETH ET AL
 recommended against lowering UA to these levels for
more than several years (2).
Lesinurad 200 and 400 mg in combination with
febuxostat resulted in increases in the proportions of
patients with complete resolution of $1 target tophus
by month 12 compared with febuxostat alone, but the
differences were not statistically significant. A similar
positive, but not statistically significant, trend was noted
for the proportion of patients with complete or partial
resolution of $1 target tophus by month 12. However,
there was an almost 50% greater reduction in target
tophi area with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat and
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat treatments compared
with febuxostat alone. This is the first study of an oral
agent to show benefits in tophus regression by month 12
of therapy.
The mean rate of gout flares requiring treatment
during the 6-month period from the end of month 6
through month 12 was reduced by nearly 50% in the
lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat group compared with
febuxostat alone, whereas the rate with lesinurad
200 mg plus febuxostat was similar to that of febuxostat
alone. The proportion of patients with gout flares
requiring treatment declined over 52 weeks, similar to
that observed in other studies with febuxostat or allopu-
rinol (5,6,8). Longer-term treatment may be needed to
further reduce gout flares, as well as to dissolve baseline
tophi, particularly to demonstrate treatment effect dif-
ferences (24,25).
Lesinurad was generally well tolerated, particu-
larly at the 200 mg dose. Although the incidence of
overall TEAEs was higher with lesinurad 200 mg and
400 mg in combination with febuxostat as compared
with febuxostat alone, the majority of events were grade
1 or 2, and the incidences of serious AEs and TEAEs
that led to study withdrawal were comparable across the
3 treatment groups. Patients treated with lesinurad
400 mg in combination with febuxostat had a higher
incidence of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of the
randomized
study
medication
as
compared
with
lesinurad 200 mg in combination with febuxostat or
febuxostat alone.
In renal safety analyses, patients treated with
lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with febuxo-
stat had a higher incidence of renal-related TEAEs
compared with those treated with febuxostat alone.
Elevations of the serum creatinine levels occurred at
higher rates in the lesinurad groups as compared with
febuxostat alone, particularly with lesinurad 400 mg, a
dosage which has not been approved for treatment. The
majority of serum creatinine elevations resolved by the
time of the next assessment; most resolved without
interruption of randomized study medication and with-
out adverse effects on renal function during the study.
The mechanism underlying elevated serum creatinine
levels has not been completely elucidated but may be
due to increased excretion and microcrystallization of
urinary UA in renal tubules. NSAIDs were allowed as
prophylaxis in patients who were not able to tolerate
colchicine, and NSAID use was low (;17% of patients).
Evaluation of CV and renal safety in this subgroup did
not demonstrate notable treatment differences. The
safety profile of lesinurad 200 mg daily in combination
with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is being further charac-
terized in a randomized controlled clinical trial with a
planned duration of 2 years.
Other therapies that inhibit URAT1 have been
associated with the development of kidney stones
(18,26). Few kidney stone TEAEs were reported during
the study. This may be explained by the fact that febuxo-
stat, through decreasing urate production, reduces the
amount of uric acid excreted by the kidneys, as previ-
ously reported for xanthine oxidase inhibitor therapies
(27,28).
When prescribing lesinurad, physicians should
take into consideration that patients with gout typically
present with comorbidities, may also be taking other
renal-acting medications, and may be poorly hydrated.
The
prescribing
information
(10)
recommends
that
patients take lesinurad with food and water and maintain
appropriate hydration via daily water intake. It also states
that physicians should monitor patients’ renal function
before they start and while they are taking lesinurad, par-
ticularly in patients with an estimated creatinine clearance
of ,60 ml/minute or with serum creatinine elevations
1.5–2 times the starting value, and evaluate for signs and
symptoms of acute uric acid nephropathy. Lesinurad
should not be started in patients with an estimated creati-
nine clearance of ,45 ml/minute.
In CV safety analyses, CV comorbidities and risk
factors were present in 74% of the patients at baseline,
reflecting the high rates of CV disease in gout patients.
Nonserious CV TEAEs were observed at low frequen-
cies in this population at high risk of a CV event, with
small increases in rates with the lesinurad treatment
groups. All patients had $1 baseline CV comorbid con-
dition or CV disease history. Independently adjudicated
MACE occurred in 1 patient in the febuxostat group
and 2 patients in each lesinurad plus febuxostat group.
Results of database analyses have indicated no change
in CV risk upon initiation of xanthine oxidase inhibitor
therapy (29) and similar risks of CV AEs for allopurinol
and febuxostat versus placebo (30,31).
LESINURAD PLUS FEBUXOSTAT TREATMENT FOR TOPHACEOUS GOUT
1911
 Limitations of CRYSTAL include the small num-
ber of women in the study and the high percentage of
patients who had already achieved serum UA levels of
,5.0 mg/dl at randomization after 3 weeks of febuxostat
treatment. However, analysis of patients whose serum
UA level was not at goal at the time of randomization
showed that lesinurad (200 or 400 mg) plus febuxostat
increased the percentage of patients at goal compared
with febuxostat alone. The relatively short length of the
study limited the potential amount of resolution of tophi
and decline in gout flares. Previous studies with febuxo-
stat or allopurinol showed that much longer treatment,
longer than 12 months, was needed to show a treatment
difference (24,25). An extension of CRYSTAL has
recently been completed that included an additional 1
year follow-up for assessment of resolution of tophi and
decline in gout flares.
For patients whose disease is not controlled with
an appropriate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor for
whom a uricosuric is recommended, there is a need for
additional treatment options. Lesinurad 200 mg is a
novel selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor approved
for treatment of gout in combination with a xanthine
oxidase inhibitor for those not at target serum UA levels
with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. Combination
therapy with lesinurad and febuxostat provides a dual
mechanism, addressing both uric acid excretion and
urate production, and may represent a treatment option
for patients with tophaceous gout who are taking febux-
ostat and warrant additional therapy.
