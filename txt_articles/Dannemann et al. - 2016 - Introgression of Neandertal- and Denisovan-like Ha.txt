Introgression of Neandertal- and Denisovan-like
Haplotypes Contributes to Adaptive Variation
in Human Toll-like Receptors
Michael Dannemann,1,2 Aida M. Andre
´s,1 and Janet Kelso1,*
Pathogens and the diseases they cause have been among the most important selective forces experienced by humans during their evolu-
tionary history. Although adaptive alleles generally arise by mutation, introgression can also be a valuable source of beneficial alleles.
Archaic humans, who lived in Europe and Western Asia for more than 200,000 years, were probably well adapted to this environment
and its local pathogens. It is therefore conceivable that modern humans entering Europe and Western Asia who admixed with them
obtained a substantial immune advantage from the introgression of archaic alleles. Here we document a cluster of three Toll-like recep-
tors (TLR6-TLR1-TLR10) in modern humans that carries three distinct archaic haplotypes, indicating repeated introgression from archaic
humans. Two of these haplotypes are most similar to the Neandertal genome, and the third haplotype is most similar to the Denisovan
genome. The Toll-like receptors are key components of innate immunity and provide an important first line of immune defense against
bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The unusually high allele frequencies and unexpected levels of population differentiation indicate that
there has been local positive selection on multiple haplotypes at this locus. We show that the introgressed alleles have clear functional
effects in modern humans; archaic-like alleles underlie differences in the expression of the TLR genes and are associated with increased
microbial resistance and increased allergic disease in large cohorts. This provides strong evidence for recurrent adaptive introgression at
the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 locus, resulting in differences in disease phenotypes in modern humans.
Introduction
Modern humans dispersing out of Africa were confronted
with new environmental challenges including novel
foods, pathogens, and a different climate. They also
encountered other human forms, and there is accumu-
lating evidence that interbreeding with Neandertals and
Denisovans contributed alleles to the modern human
gene pool.1–4 Two recent studies have provided genome-
wide maps of archaic haplotypes in present-day people
that are likely to have been introduced by introgression
from Neandertals.5,6 The discovery of introgression from
now-extinct human forms into modern humans entering
Eurasia raises the possibility that the arriving modern hu-
mans might have benefitted from the introduction of
alleles that existed in archaic humans who were well
adapted to the environment.1–3,7 A few cases of such adap-
tive introgression have been described, usually involving
genes that influence systems interacting directly with the
environment. For example, the introgression of a Deniso-
van haplotype in EPAS1 (MIM: 603349) has recently been
shown to confer altitude adaptation in Tibetans,8 and sin-
gle-locus studies have identified adaptive introgression in
genes involved in immunity and metabolism including
genes of the major histocompatibility locus (MHC),
SLC16A11 (MIM: 615765), OAS1 (MIM: 164350), and
STAT2 (MIM: 600556).9–12
Three of the ten human toll-like receptors (TLR10 [MIM:
606270], TLR1 [MIM: 601194], and TLR6 [MIM: 605403])
encoded in a cluster on chromosome 4 are among the
top 1% of genes with the highest Neandertal introgression
(Table S1). This TLR cluster is particularly interesting
because of its high introgression probability reflecting
the appreciable length and frequency of the Neandertal-
like haplotype, and because of the critical role that these
three TLRs play innate immunity. The innate immune
system provides a first line of defense against pathogens
and is involved in the early detection of micro-organisms
as well as in the activation of the adaptive immune
response.13,14 In humans, TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10 occur
on the cell surface and are known to detect bacterial,
fungal, and parasite components including flagellin and
glycolipids. They are essential for eliciting the inflamma-
tory and anti-microbial responses as well as for activating
an adaptive immune response.13 In agreement with their
crucial role, TLRs have been shown to be highly conserved,
although cell-surface TLRs are less strictly constrained than
intracellular TLRs.15 In fact, the region encompassing the
TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 genes has been shown to have some sig-
natures of recent positive selection in certain non-African
populations,15,16 suggesting that they might be involved
in local immune-system adaptation. However, the pres-
ence of introgressed archaic haplotypes confounds the
signatures of recent positive selection17 and can lead to
erroneous inference of adaptive evolution. We therefore
explored in detail both the evidence for introgression
and the evidence for natural selection at the TLR6-TLR1-
TLR10 cluster.

 Material and Methods
Identifying the Introgressed Region in Present Day
Human Genomes
To identify potentially introgressed archaic-like haplotypes in
present-day human genomes, we used the genome-wide Nean-
dertal introgression maps from Sankararaman et al.5 and Vernot
et al.6 The introgression map presented by Sankararaman et al.
provides the probability that SNPs at polymorphic positions in
modern humans arose on the Neandertal lineage and intro-
gressed into modern humans. Vernot et al. used the S* statis-
tic18 to detect putatively introgressed regions in modern humans
and compared the candidate regions to the reference Neandertal
genome to define introgressed Neandertal blocks in modern
humans.
To delineate the introgressed region of interest, we used the
per-SNP introgression probabilities from Sankararaman et al.5
for all Asian and all European individuals. In the region encom-
passing the three TLR genes and an additional region 50 kb
up- and downstream (chromosome 4: 38,723,860–38,908,438;
Figure 1), we computed the difference between the Neandertal
probabilities for pairs of neighboring SNPs relative to the distance
between them. We then defined the range of our preliminary in-
trogressed region based on the SNPs with the largest difference in
Neandertal probabilities in the introgression maps for both
Asians and Europeans. The largest increase was observed at posi-
tion chr4: 38,757,064 in both the European and Asian maps. The
largest decrease in probabilities differed between the European
and Asian maps. We used the Asian map (SNP at position chr4:
38,907,701) because it yielded the longer potentially introgressed
region. The maximum difference in the European map is at chr4:
38,821,916.
Within this region we defined potentially archaic-like SNPs as
those where the Neandertal or Denisovan genomes differ from
the 109 Yoruba individuals in the 1000 Genomes dataset.21 We
refined the putatively introgressed region by selecting the
archaic-like SNPs that are within the preliminary region and
closest to the borders of this region. The final putatively intro-
gressed
region
covers
143
kb
of
chromosome
4
(chr4:
38,760,338–38,905,731; Figure 1) and contains 61 archaic-like
SNPs. This region overlaps two haplotypes identified by Vernot
et al.6—one identified in Europeans and the other in Asians.
To further explore the extent of the introgressed haplotype, we
computed linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the 61 archaic-
like SNPs that define the introgressed region and the three nearest
neighboring archaic-like SNPs up- and downstream of the defined
143 kb region. We included in the analysis all 1000 Genomes
individuals22 that carried at least one archaic-like allele for at
least one of the 61 archaic-like SNPs within the TLR region
(Figure S1).
Introgression Scores for Each Gene
We calculated introgression summary scores for each of the 18,017
CCDS genes by averaging the posterior probabilities provided by
Sankararaman et al.5 for all sites within each CCDS gene in each
1000 Genomes individual, and then calculating an average for
all Europeans (EUR), all Asians (ASN), and the combined set of
these two populations (EUR-ASN). Genes were ranked according
to their averaged score (Table S1).
Haplotype Network Analysis
To explore the relationships between haplotypes in this locus, we
constructed a haplotype network based on the haplotypes of all
1000 Genomes individuals (phase III21) and the Altai Neandertal
and Denisovan genome sequences (Figure S2)23. We used all
1,997 SNPs that were observed in more than one chromosome
in the 1,000 Genomes dataset21 and where the Neandertal and
the Denisovan were homozygous. We excluded 11 SNPs where
either the Neandertal or the Denisovan were heterozygous. We

to 0.1 cM (HapMap, 0.1 cM; deCode, 0.04 cM; and Hinch African
American map, 0.08 cM).

 merged the resulting 2,609 unique haplotypes into core haplo-
types that differed by <150 nucleotides (i.e., ~1/1,000 base pairs
in the region was allowed to differ between two chromosomes).
This resulted in a set of seven modern human core haplotypes
(Figures 1, 2, and S2, Table S2) and two archaic haplotypes
(that are simply the Neandertal and Denisovan genome se-
quences). We generated a consensus sequence for each modern
human core haplotype by computing the majority allele at
each position.
Neighbor-Joining Tree
We computed a neighbor-joining tree for the entire 143 kb
region based on the nucleotide distance between the sequences
of the seven modern human core haplotypes together with the
Neandertal, Denisovan, chimpanzee, and orangutan sequences
using the R package ape.24 We obtained the orthologous se-
quences for chimpanzee and orangutan by using the liftover soft-
ware.25 Branch support was obtained from 1,000 bootstraps
(Figure 2A).

Diversity in Populations and Core
Haplotypes
We computed the mean pair-wise differ-
ence between all haplotype pairs within
each core haplotype and for all popula-
tions and combinations of populations
(Figure S3, Table S3).
Recombination Rates
We obtained the average recombination
rate
from
three
maps
(sex-averaged:
deCode 1.5 cM/Mb, Marshfield 2.4 cM/
Mb, Genethon 2.1 cM/Mb26–28) for the
TLR region from UCSC.25 There is consid-
erable variation in estimated recombina-
tion rates across the region. Two of the
maps28,29 show a 5- to 12-fold higher
recombination rate than the chromosome
average in the region overlapping TLR10
(Figures S5A and S5B). A third map30 based
on African genomes did not show as
extreme an increase in recombination
rate (Figure S5C), which might be partially due to the absence of
the archaic-like core haplotypes in individuals of African origin.
The Probability of a 143 kb Introgressed Segment due
to Incomplete Lineage Sorting
Recombination reduces the length of introgressed haplotypes
over time, and introgression events are quite recent when
compared with the divergence between modern humans and
Neandertals. Introgressed segments are therefore on average
longer than those that arise due to incomplete lineage sorting
(ILS). We calculated the probability that a haplotype of 143 kb
in length is not broken by recombination since the common
ancestor of modern humans and Neandertals and/or Denisovans
(i.e., is due to ILS), according to the approach described in
Huerta-Sa
´nchez et al.8 In brief, we model the expected length
of segments of ILS given the local recombination rate, time since
the divergence from the common ancestor, and generation time,
and compare this to the length of the observed introgressed
haplotype.

The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 22–33, January 7, 2016
 The variable parameters used are provided in Table S4A. For all
calculations we used a generation time (g) of 25 years and the
lowest average recombination rate estimate for the TLR region
from the available maps (r ¼ 1.5 3 10�8) because this yields longer
haplotypes and is therefore most conservative.
Estimates of branch lengths since divergence times (in years) are
taken from Pru
¨fer et al.3 and are already corrected for fossil age. To
ensure that our estimates are as conservative as possible, we always
use the lowest possible branch lengths (in years) from the esti-
mated ranges given in Pru
¨fer et al.3 because these allow the least
time for recombination.
We computed the expected length L for two recent estimates
of the human mutation rate; m ¼ 1 3 10�9 and m ¼ 0.5 3
10�9 per base pair per year: L ¼ 1/(r 3 (t1þt2)/g) and the proba-
bility of a length of at least 143 kb as 1 � GammaCDF(143000,
shape ¼ 2, rate ¼ 1/L) given these different parameters;
with GammaCDF being the gamma distribution function. The
expected lengths of haplotypes resulting from ILS and the
probabilities of observing a haplotype of 143 kb are shown in
Table S4B.
FST Analysis
In order to quantify allele frequency differences between popula-
tions, we computed pairwise FST for all genome-wide SNPs (1)
between populations from different continents (Africa, Asia,
Europe) and (2) from populations within a continent (Asia and
Europe).
FST values were computed using vcftools based on the Weir
and Cockerham calculation.31 For (1) we included 100 random
unrelated individuals (1000 Genomes phase III) representing
a sample from each continent. For (2) we used 50 unrelated
individuals per population. We compared the FST values for
two different sets of SNPs: first, the 61 archaic-like SNPs
that were present in any of the three archaic-like core haplo-
types (III, IV, VII) in the region (Table S5) and second, the four
tag SNPs presented in Barreiro et al.15 and Laayouni et al.16 (Ta-
ble S6).
To determine whether population differentiation deviates from
neutral expectations, the FST value of each SNP was compared to
the empirical distributions of FST values of (1) all genome-wide
SNPs, (2) all genome-wide archaic-like SNPs (SNPs present in one
or more non-Africans that match the Neandertal or Denisovan
genome sequences), and (3) all genome-wide archaic-like SNPs
exclusively found in Asian individuals.
We repeated the FST analyses using all 155 SNPs differentiating
the core haplotypes in the region and confirmed the results using
solely the archaic-like SNPs.
To correct for multiple testing, we computed the false discovery
rate for all comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
SNPs with Evidence for Positive Selection Presented
Previously
Because previous studies on this region did not take into ac-
count the (then unknown) archaic origin of some haplotypes,
we re-evaluated the signatures of positive selection for haplo-
type-defining SNPs reported by Barreiro et al.15 and Laayouni
et al.16 and their relationship to the core haplotypes we identi-
fied. Frequency information for SNPs presented in Barreiro
et al. and Laayouni et al. were computed using all individuals
of the 1000 Genomes dataset (phase III) and are shown in Tables
S6B–S6D.
Expression Analysis in Multiple Tissues from the GTEx
Dataset
To determine whether the archaic haplotypes have any effect on
gene regulation, we analyzed expression data from 52 tissues pro-
vided by the GTEx.32 Between 4 and 210 individuals were avail-
able for each tissue. We identified nine shared archaic-like
SNPs (chr4: 38,777,471; 38,778,903; 38,783,848; 38,802,913;
38,803,063; 38,805,983; 38,806,019; 38,806,096; 38,806,827)
from the Illumina OMNI 5M SNP Array32 used to genotype each
individual, and we used these to tag the archaic-like core haplo-
types. All nine SNPs are in perfect linkage with one another.
In each tissue, we used the DESeq2 package to test for allele-spe-
cific differential expression of TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10 between
those individuals with and without archaic-like core haplo-
types.33 The expression (in normalized counts) of each of the three
TLR genes and the corresponding differential expression p values
are shown in Figure 3 (additional information in Figures S4 and
S7 and Table S7).
Expression Analysis using a Lymphoblastoid Cell Line
Dataset
We also analyzed gene expression using data from lymphoblastoid
cell lines from 421 of the Yoruban and European individuals from
the 1000 Genomes cohort.34
We tested for allele-specific expression differential expression us-
ing the 32 archaic-like alleles that are shared by the archaic-like core
haplotypes (III, IV, VII) and not seen in the other modern-human
core haplotypes. The archaic-like SNPs private to core haplotypes
IV and VII were not polymorphic in the genomes of any of the
individuals, probably because of their lower frequency and the
absence of Asian individuals in this dataset. Of the 32 archaic-like
SNPs that are shared by the archaic-like core haplotypes (III, IV,
VII) and not seen in the other modern-human core haplotypes,
22werevariableinthe1000 Genomesindividualsfor whom expres-
sion data was available. We extracted high-quality mapped reads
(MQ > 30) from the Geuvadis RNA sequencing project. For each in-
dividual we evaluated expression of TLR10, TLR1, and TLR6 by as-
signing to each genethose reads with overlapping mapcoordinates.
We normalized the number of reads per individual with the DESeq
package35 and computed differential expression between the indi-
viduals carrying the archaic-like allele and all other individuals via
a Mann-Whitney U test. The FDR values are shown in Table S7.
Transcription Factor Analysis
We computed the number of transcription factor binding sites (ob-
tained from the ENCODE project36) in 150-kb sliding windows
with a step size of 10 kb across chromosome 4. We identified those
SNPs that are shared by the archaic-like core haplotypes (III, IV,
VII) but different from the other modern human core haplotypes
and that overlap ENCODE-defined transcription factor binding
sites (Table S8). A total of 49 binding sites for 28 different TFs over-
lap the archaic-specific SNPs.
With the ontology enrichment software FUNC,37 we tested
whether transcription factors with binding sites overlapping
archaic-like SNPs show evidence for functional enrichment in
the gene ontology compared to 124 other transcription factors
tested by the ENCODE consortium.36–38

 GWASdb39 (Table S9). We selected the two phenotypes (Helico-
bacter pylori seroprevalence and susceptiblity to allergic disease)
for which the associated SNPs show overlap with multiple
archaic-like SNPs. A principal-component analysis (PCA) was
used to cluster the seven modern human core haplotypes based
on allele sharing with these two GWAS phenotypes (Figure 4).
Results
Identifying Introgressed Haplotypes
We identified an extended region encompassing the genes
TLR10, TLR1, and TLR6 on chromosome 4 in both
genome-wide maps of Neandertal introgression5,6 (Fig-
ure 1, Table S1, Material and Methods). Because the two
introgression maps did not agree completely on the
length of the introgressed region, we used consecutive
SNPs with the largest differences in introgression probabil-
ities in the Neandertal introgression map5 to mark the
start and end of a putatively introgressed region that is
143 kb in length (hg19; chr4: 38,760,338–38,905,731;
Material and Methods). We also observe a significant
drop in LD (D0, see Figure S1) between SNPs within the in-
ferred introgressed region and SNPs outside the region,
suggesting that the introgressed haplotype common in
present-day populations does not extend beyond the
defined 143 kb region.
To determine the haplotype structure of this TLR region,
we used the inferred 1000 Genomes phase III haplotypes
for 2,535 individuals from 26 populations.21 By clustering
haplotypes that differ by fewer than 1/1,000 bases, we
identified seven distinct core haplotypes in modern hu-
mans (Material and Methods, Figure S2, Table S2).
We computed pairwise distances between these seven
modern human core haplotypes and the genome se-
quences of the Neandertal and Denisovan2,3 and found
that three of the modern human core haplotypes (III, IV,
and VII) are found almost exclusively in individuals
outside Africa (969/971 carriers are non-African) and are
more similar to the archaic genome sequences than to
any modern human core haplotype (Figures 2A and 2B).
In fact, their distances to the archaic genome sequences
are smaller than the distances between any pair of modern
human core haplotypes. This suggests a recent common
ancestor for the archaic haplotypes and modern human
haplotypes III, IV, and VII that is younger than the com-
mon ancestor of the other pairs of modern human core
haplotypes, as expected from archaic introgression.
Strikingly, this analysis also indicates that there are
three distinct archaic-like haplotypes at this locus. Of the
three putatively introgressed core haplotypes, III and
IV are most similar to the Altai Neandertal genome

 (haplotype I, Figure 2). All 49 Neandertal-like alleles that
define core haplotype III are shared with core haplotype
IV, which has 12 additional archaic-like alleles. Core
haplotype VII is most similar to the Denisovan sequence
(haplotype II, Figures 2 and S2). We find 137 individuals
homozygous for core haplotype III and two individuals
homozygous
for
core
haplotype
IV
(III:
Table
S11;
IV: HG02388, NA18625), which indicates that these
haplotypes were not introduced by errors in phasing.
We did not identify any individual that was homozy-
gous for core haplotype VII, probably because of its low
frequency.
Evidence for Introgression
An alternative explanation for the persistence of three
archaic-like haplotypes is incomplete lineage sorting
(ILS). Both introgression and ILS can result in the presence
of ancestral alleles in present-day human genomes and in a
genomic region where the haplotype phylogeny does not
match the expected phylogeny.40 The region described
here was identified in two different genome-wide maps
of Neandertal introgression via methods that are not
sensitive to normal segments of ILS.5,6 Nevertheless, we
explored a number of key signatures that allow us to distin-
guish ILS from introgression.
First, given the time since divergence between modern
and archaic humans, ILS is expected to be restricted to
short genomic regions due to the long-term effects of
recombination. We calculated the probability that a haplo-
type of 143 kb in length is not broken by recombination
since the common ancestor of modern humans and Nean-
dertals and/or Denisovans according to the approach used
by Huerta-Sa
´nchez et al.8 Using conservative estimates for
the age of divergence of the Neandertal and Denisovan
(Table S4A) we show that a 143-kb archaic-like haplotype
is highly unlikely under ILS (p value < 5.6 3 10�14; Table
S4B, Material and Methods). An unusually low recombina-
tion rate in the region is also not a plausible explanation
because the recombination rate across the region has
been estimated to between 1.5 and 2.4 cM/Mb by different
methods26–28—a rate that is higher than the genome-wide
average of 1.3 cM/Mb.41
Further, evidence in favor of introgression is provided
by the geographic distribution of archaic-like core haplo-
types III, IV, and VII. We expect that alleles present due
to ILS should be shared across human populations,
whereas Neandertal and Denisovan introgressed alleles
should be largely absent in Africa. In the 1000 Genomes
Phase III data, all three archaic-like haplotypes are largely
restricted to populations outside Africa (Figures 2A and
5A; Table S10). Core haplotype III is present in all non-
African populations, and we also observe it in two
chromosomes from two Northwest Gambian individuals
(excluding the potentially admixed African Americans).
Northwest African populations have been shown to
have experienced recent gene flow from non-Africans42
that
might
have
carried
archaic
introgressed
alleles
into these populations.43 This suggests that the presence
of this haplotype in these Gambian individuals might
be explained by recent back-to-Africa migration. Core
haplotype IV is restricted to specific Asian groups, and
core haplotype VII is present in only two South Asian in-
dividuals (Figures 2A and 5A; Table S10). Haplotypes III
and IV are also present among 271 geographically diverse
individuals from the Simons Genome Diversity Panel
with similar geographic distribution (Figure S5B, Table
S12). The geographic distribution of these archaic-like
haplotypes is consistent with recent studies that suggest
that there might have been at least two pulses of Nean-
dertal introgression: one into the ancestors of all non-
Africans, and one into the ancestors of present-day
Asians.44,45 It is also compatible with a low level of Deni-
sovan ancestry in mainland Asia.46 We note that two
early modern humans (dated to ~7,000–8,000 years before
present) from Europe (Stuttgart and Loschbour)47 also
carry TLR haplotypes similar to Neandertal core haplotype

 III and an early modern human from Asia (Ust’-Ishim,
~45,000 years)48 carries a haplotype that is most similar
to core haplotype V—the major non-introgressed haplo-
type in modern humans.
Finally, an expected signature of introgression (but not
ILS) is low diversity within the introgressed haplotypes,
because they have a recent origin—the introgression
event. To assess core haplotype diversity, we calculated
mean pairwise differences between all haplotypes within
each of the seven core haplotypes (Material and Methods;
Figure S3, Table S3). Consistent with an introgressed
origin, the three archaic-like core haplotypes (III, IV, and
VII) show lower diversity in non-Africans than the most
common modern human core haplotype (V). We also
note that core haplotype V has high diversity in Africa.
This makes it unlikely that core haplotypes III, IV, and
VIII were due to ILS and specifically lost in Africans,
because this would have reduced the overall diversity at
this locus.
A number of independent lines of evidence therefore
support
the
introgression
of
at
least
three
distinct
archaic-like haplotypes at the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 locus in
modern non-African populations.
Evidence for Positive Selection in Modern Humans
The most frequent non-introgressed haplotype (V) is at
high frequency in all 1000 Genomes populations (39%–
88%), whereas the other non-introgressed haplotypes
(VI, VIII, and IX) are present at less than 1% frequency
and are predominantly found in African individuals (Fig-
ures 2 and 5, Table S10). Among the introgressed haplo-
types, Neandertal-like core haplotype III is at intermediate
frequency in all non-African populations (11%–51%) and
Neandertal-like core haplotype IV is present at a frequency

 of 2%–10% in Asians. The Denisovan-like core haplotype
VII is present in only two Southern Asian individuals
(HG03750 and HG0411). The proportion of Neandertal-
derived ancestry in non-Africans has been estimated to
be between 1.5% and 2.1%, whereas Denisovan ancestry
in mainland Asia and Native Americans has been esti-
mated at well below 0.5%.3 The presence of three distinct
archaic haplotypes, with two of them at frequencies sub-
stantially greater than 2%, is therefore surprising and sug-
gests that the archaic-like alleles might have been advanta-
geous in modern humans.
Signatures of recent population-specific positive selec-
tion on the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 cluster were reported by Bar-
reiro et al.15 and Laayouni et al.16 based on the distribution
of allele frequencies (Tajima’s D and Fay and Wu’s H statis-
tics),49,50 population differentiation (FST),51 allele-specific
nucleotide diversity (DIND test),15 and long-range LD
(LRH test).52 However, the presence of introgressed haplo-
types was not known at that time. Introgression confounds
many of these signatures of recent positive selection
because introgressed haplotypes show particular patterns
of population differentiation and because even under
neutrality, introgressed haplotypes affect the patterns of
allele-specific diversity and allele-specific long-range link-
age disequilibrium. It is therefore necessary to re-evaluate
the signatures of selection at this locus while accounting
for introgression. To determine whether the frequencies
of Neandertal-like core haplotypes III and IV (up 10%
and 51% in certain Eurasian populations; Table S10) are
higher than expected from drift alone, we measured allele
frequency differentiation between pairs of populations us-
ing FST,53 for all 61 archaic-like SNPs. To assess significance,
we compared these to the genome-wide empirical distribu-
tion of FST values for putatively introgressed archaic-like
SNPs (Material and Methods, Table S5). The differentiation
between African and non-African populations for the SNPs
shared by haplotypes III and IV is unusually high when
compared to the empirical FST distribution of archaic-like
SNPs (p value ¼ 0.01 Africa-Asia and p value ¼ 0.04–0.05
Africa-Europe, Table S5A). Results are similar for core
haplotype IV (Table S5A). However, because divergence
between African and non-African genomes was used as
a factor in identifying the region as having high propor-
tion of Neandertal introgression,5 this high population
differentiation is not necessarily unexpected. However,
we also observe moderate population differentiation be-
tween Asians and Europeans for both core haplotype III
(p value ¼ 0.08–0.23) and core haplotype IV (p value ¼
0.11; Table S5A), which is not explained by the ascertain-
ment bias.
Perhaps most surprisingly, the frequency of the shared
SNPs common to Neandertal-like core haplotypes III and
IV also varies significantly between populations even
within continents. In Europe, a North-South gradient is
apparent with significantly high population differentia-
tion between southern Europeans (Toscani and Iberians,
with frequencies of 39.3% and 38.3%, respectively) and
all other European groups (Finnish, British, and CEPH,
with frequencies between 14.8% and 26.4%) (p value <
0.05; Tables S5B and S5C). The frequency of the intro-
gressed haplotypes is higher in the Southern European
populations (Figure 5). In Asia, the most Eastern popula-
tions (Japanese and Han Chinese, frequency 53.4% and
53.6%) show high differentiation from other Asian popula-
tions (frequency 21.7%–41.9%; p value < 0.05; Tables S5D
and S5E). In addition, the 12 SNPs defining Asian-specific
core haplotype IV show high population differentiation
when Dai and Vietnamese (with frequencies 9.4% and
9.9%) are compared to other Asian populations (fre-
quencies between 0% and 4.7%), when using putatively
introgressed SNPs present exclusively in Asia as the back-
ground (p value < 0.05, Tables S5D and S5E). Overall, the
frequency of the three introgressed haplotypes combined
ranges between 14.8% and 39.3% in Europeans and be-
tween 21.7% and 53.5% in Asian populations, although
the contribution of each haplotype (III or IV) varies sub-
stantially across Asian groups (Figure 5, Table S10).
Barreiro et al.15 previously reported signatures of positive
selection tagged by two SNPs: rs4129009 and rs5743618.
rs4129009 is a non-synonymous SNP in TLR10 that
showed signatures of positive selection in East Asians. In
our data, the putatively selected allele (C) is predominantly
found on Neandertal-like core haplotype III (707 out of
741 C carrier haplotypes belong to core haplotype III; Table
S6), and the observed signatures of selection in Barreiro
et al.15 are therefore most likely explained by positive selec-
tion on the archaic core haplotype, as described above.
rs5743618 is a non-synonymous SNP whose derived allele
(C) reduces TRL1 signaling, resulting in a 60% reduction in
the activity of NF-kB, and that in Barreiro et al.15 showed
signatures of positive selection in Europeans. In our data,
despite significant population differentiation between
African and non-African populations (p value < 0.01),
the proposed advantageous allele (C) of rs5743618 is pre-
sent in all human populations and almost exclusively
found on non-introgressed core haplotype V (994 out of
1,007 haplotypes with a C, 11 on core haplotype III, and
2 on core haplotype VI). The signatures of natural selection
reported for this SNP are thus not due simply to the intro-
gressed haplotypes. In fact, the unusually large population
differentiation remains when we investigate the frequency
of rs5743618 within only the non-introgressed core
haplotype V (p value < 0.01; Table S6). This indicates
that the signatures of selection for this SNP are in-
dependent of the changes in allele frequency of the
introgressed archaic-like core haplotypes (Material and
Methods). Additionally, Laayouni et al. reported parallel
signatures of very recent adaptive evolution of the
TLR6-TLR1-TLR10
cluster
in
Rroma
and
Romanian
populations, possibly due to adaptation to Yesinia pestis
during the plague.16 The SNP with the strongest signa-
tures of positive selection (rs4833103) is intergenic, but
three non-synonymous SNPs at the locus (rs4833095,
rs11096957, and rs5743810) were shown to influence

 cytokine production induced by Y. pestis. The derived al-
leles at these four SNPs are at their highest frequency on
non-introgressed core haplotype V (percentage of individ-
uals carrying the derived allele on haplotype V: rs4833103
[A] ¼ 99%; rs5743810 [A] ¼ 72%; rs11096957 [T] ¼ 93%;
rs4833095 [T] ¼ 95%) and show high population differen-
tiation between European and non-European populations
(Table S6). These alleles are either absent (rs4833103) or
at low frequency (rs4833095 and rs11096957) on the
archaic-like core haplotypes (III, IV, and VII), indicating
that they are not of archaic origin. We note that the signals
of selection reported by Barreiro et al.15 and Laayouni
et al.16 might not be completely independent. Both
groups
identified
SNP
rs4833095,
and
both
report
SNPs with similar geographic frequency patterns. The
absence of these apparently selected alleles on introgressed
haplotypes and the recent age of the inferred selection
on some of them16 provides evidence that there has
been selection on both archaic- and non-archaic-like
haplotypes.
Our results show that the TLR locus shows signatures of
recent positive selection even after taking the introgres-
sion into account. Strikingly, they also provide evidence
for multiple independent rounds of positive selection on
both introgressed and non-introgressed haplotypes at
the
TLR6-TLR1-TLR10
cluster
and
possibly
at
quite
different times. This region has been proposed to be a
hotspot of positive selection in other great apes54,55 and
the presence of several positively selected alleles in mod-
ern human populations is therefore perhaps not surpris-
ing. However, the fact that several of these alleles have
been acquired through adaptive introgression is quite
interesting.
Functional Consequences of the Introgressed Alleles
There are 42 SNPs that distinguish all archaic-like core hap-
lotypes from the other modern human core haplotypes. Of
these shared archaic-like SNPs, 47% are located upstream
of genes, 46% in introns, 2% in 50 UTRs, 2% downstream
of genes, 2% in non-coding exons, and 1% in 30 UTRs
(Material and Methods, Table S2). None of the archaic-
like SNPs modifies the amino acid sequence of any TLR
gene, but the 143 kb encompassing TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 is
rich in regulatory elements, falling in the top 1% of simi-
larly sized windows for transcription factor binding site
density on chromosome 436 (Material and Methods, Table
S8). In fact, the archaic-like SNPs overlap 49 well-character-
ized transcription factor binding sites, for 28 different tran-
scription factors, suggesting a putative regulatory impact
of the introgressed alleles.
To determine whether the regulatory effect is tissue spe-
cific, we obtained expression data for 52 tissues from
between 4 and 210 individuals from the GTEx project.32
Using the individual genotype data, we identified four
shared archaic-like SNPs that we used to tag the archaic-
like core haplotypes. Individuals carrying the archaic-
like haplotypes show a significantly higher expression
of all three TLR genes in EBV-transformed lymphocytes
(p < 0.05, Figure 3), whereas other tissues show differen-
tial expression of single TLR genes (Figure S4). Because
most tissues do not show an expression change between
individuals that is dependent on the archaic-like alleles,
it
seems
likely
that
the
regulatory
effect
is
tissue
specific. Using the genome sequences and expression
data from lymphoblastoid cell lines from 421 individuals
of European and African origin,34 we confirmed that all
three TLR genes show significantly higher expression
in
individuals
carrying
archaic-like
alleles
in
core
haplotype III than in individuals carrying the non-intro-
gressed modern human alleles (Figure S7, Table S7). This
is consistent with the observation made in Mayerle
et al.19 where increased expression of TLR1 was reported
for individuals carrying the alleles that we show here are
introgressed.
We further assessed the functional relevance of the
archaic-like core haplotypes by using data from genome-
wide association studies. A total of 79 SNPs, of which 13
are archaic-like and present on all three archaic haplo-
types, are significantly associated with GWAS phenotypes
within the 143 kb TLR region.39 Of the 37 SNPs signifi-
cantly associated with Helicobacter pylori seroprevalence,
13 are archaic-like;19 of the 58 SNPs associated with suscep-
tibility to allergic disease, 12 are archaic-like20 (Figure 1,
Table S9). Clustering of the seven core haplotypes based
on allele sharing with the GWAS SNPs significantly associ-
ated with these two phenotypes revealed high sequence
differentiation between all three archaic-like core haplo-
types and core haplotype V for both phenotypes (Figure 4,
Material and Methods). The largest sequence differentia-
tion is between the archaic-like core haplotype III and
all non-archaic-like core haplotypes, which differ in 23
of the 37 SNPs underlying Helicobacter pylori seropreva-
lence and in 31 of the 58 SNPs associated with allergic
disease (Table S9). Interestingly, archaic-like alleles are
consistently associated with reduced Helicobacter pylori se-
roprevalence19 and with increased susceptibility to allergic
disease.20
Discussion
Neandertals lived in Europe and Western Asia for more
than 200,000 years and were probably well adapted to
the environment and local pathogens. It is therefore
conceivable that admixture with Neandertals contributed
alleles that conferred a substantial immune advantage on
modern humans expanding into Europe and Western
Asia. The presence of not one but three distinct intro-
gressed haplotypes, whose sequences are closer to the ge-
nomes of two different archaic humans, suggests that
maintaining these introgressed alleles is likely to have
been advantageous. In fact, the high frequencies that these
alleles have reached in several human groups are inconsis-
tent with neutral processes since the admixture between
30

 Neandertals and modern humans, around 50,000 years
ago.56,57 At least two of these introgressed haplotypes
appear to have been advantageous in certain modern hu-
man populations.
Previous studies highlighted the contribution of archaic
human alleles to the immune systems of modern hu-
mans.9–12 We show here that the TLR genes, which are
critical components of the innate immune response,
have also acquired advantageous alleles by admixture
with archaic humans. These archaic alleles lead to signifi-
cantly increased expression of TLR6, TLR1, and TLR10 in
white blood cells, and in present-day people are associ-
ated with reduced Helicobacter pylori seroprevalence and
increased susceptibility to allergies.19,20 Taken together,
this suggests that the introgressed alleles might enhance
innate immune surveillance and reactivity against certain
pathogens, but that this might also have increased hy-
persensitivity to non-pathogenic allergens, resulting in
allergic diseases in present-day people. Given the evidence
for selection on multiple TLR haplotypes in humans,
including recent selection on non-introgressed haplotypes
that are associated with changes in response to Y. pestis
and Y. pseudotuberculosis,16 and also selection in other pri-
mates, it is possible that exposure to different pathogens
might have favored different haplotypes at different times,
resulting in higher overall diversity. Introgressed haplo-
types are a particularly desirable source of diversity because
they are highly divergent, viable, and perhaps even adap-
tive, in closely related populations.58 Immune-related
loci, which are also enriched among targets of balancing se-
lection,59 probably benefit substantially from the introduc-
tion of such genetic diversity.7,59 The variation introduced
by introgression from archaic humans might have been an
important factor in the adaptation of modern humans to
novel pathogens in challenging new environments.
Both adaptive introgression and local positive selection
on modern human haplotypes have contributed to the
evolution of the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 locus in some human
populations, affecting both gene expression and protein
function. We note, however, that because pathogens
evolve quickly, it is difficult to pinpoint the precise selec-
tive
force
or
forces
driving
these
changes.
Further
genome-wide screens linking Neandertal haplotypes to
modern human phenotypes will provide more insight
into how admixture with archaic humans has influenced
modern human biology.
