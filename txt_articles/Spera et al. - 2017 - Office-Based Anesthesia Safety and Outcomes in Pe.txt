The number of children with caries requiring general anesthesia to achieve comprehensive dental care and the demand
for dentist anesthesiologists to provide ambulatory anesthesia for these patients is increasing. No current published
studies examine the safety and outcomes of ambulatory anesthesia performed by dentist anesthesiologists for dental
procedures in pediatric patients, and there is no national requirement for reporting outcomes of these procedures. In
2010, the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry was developed. This Web-based database
allows providers of ambulatory anesthesia to track patient demographics and various outcomes of procedures. Our
study is a secondary analysis of data collected in the registry over a 4-year period, 2010–2014. Of the 7041 cases
reviewed, no cases resulted in serious complications, including death, anaphylaxis, aspiration, cardiovascular adverse
events, or neurologic adverse events. Of the 7041 cases reviewed, 196 (3.0%) resulted in a predischarge or
postdischarge adverse event. The predischarge adverse event occurring with the highest frequency was laryngospasm,
occurring in 35 cases (0.50%). The postdischarge adverse event occurring with the highest frequency was nausea,
reported by 99 patients (5.0%). This study provides strong clinical outcomes data to support the safety of office-based
anesthesia as performed by dentist anesthesiologists in the treatment of pediatric dental patients.

T
he use of office-based anesthesia (OBA) continues
to shape the way surgical procedures are provided
in the United States. Today an estimated 1 in every 4
elective surgical procedures is performed in the office-
based setting, accounting for over 10 million cases
annually.1 The migration of elective surgeries from
hospitals to outside venues began approximately 30
years ago, and has grown exponentially since then. In
1984, approximately 400,000 outpatient procedures
were performed in nonhospital settings.2 By the year
2000, the number of cases had grown to 8.3 million.2
Treatment
of
patients
using
ambulatory
OBA
is
associated with several advantages over hospital-based
treatment.3 These advantages include a decrease in cost
and increase in access to care when compared with
hospital-based treatment, improved patient and provid-
er convenience, greater ease and efficiency of scheduling,
and a decrease in wait time for necessary procedures.2,4
The number of children receiving anesthesia for
dental procedures in the United States is also increasing.
In 2001, it was estimated that approximately 1 million
young children required anesthetic management to
facilitate their dental treatment.5 The guidelines of the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry outline the
specific populations in which deep sedation/general
anesthesia (GA) is indicated. These include children
and patients with special needs requiring extensive
treatment and those with acute situational anxiety,
uncooperative age-appropriate behavior, immature cog-
nitive functioning, disabilities, or medical conditions
that require deep sedation/general anesthesia.6 In 2012,

 the Pediatric Oral Health Research and Policy Center7
described general anesthesia as an essential health
benefit for the treatment of early childhood caries in a
comprehensive technical report for the American
Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.
According to the American Hospital Association, in
2005, 55% of outpatient surgeries were completed in
physicians’ offices or freestanding surgical centers, and
this number continues to grow each year.8 In 2012,
Olabi et al9 identified an emerging trend in the use of
dentist anesthesiologists in pediatric dental offices in
order to expand the depth, scope, and effectiveness of
office-based sedation and anesthesia services for the
treatment of pediatric dental patients. As hospital
operating room time becomes harder for pediatric
dentists to obtain, the use of office-based general
anesthesia in the treatment of pediatric dental patients
will continue to grow.4
Despite the rise in non–operating room anesthesia,
very little is known about the extent or nature of adverse
events in these settings. In 2000, the Institute of
Medicine released a report titled To Err Is Human that
stated, ‘‘Little if any research has focused on errors or
adverse events occurring outside of hospital settings.’’10
Likewise, a 2014 review of the safety and outcomes of
OBA noted a relative paucity of outcomes research in
dental OBA, and most of the literature that currently
exists on complications following anesthesia for dental
procedures has focused on adults.11,12 Lee et al13 studied
the morbidity and mortality for children in the United
States subsequent to receiving sedation or general
anesthesia for dental treatment based on available
media reports, but noted that the most significant
limitation of the study was that no database existed to
help with estimates of these outcomes.
The need for a national database to collect informa-
tion regarding patient safety and outcomes following
OBA was addressed by the Society for Ambulatory
Anesthesia (SAMBA). In 2010, SAMBA developed the
SAMBA Clinical Outcomes Registry (SCOR), a Web-
based database that allows providers of ambulatory
anesthesia to enter information about their procedures
and track outcomes. SCOR locations include private
practice offices, freestanding ambulatory surgical cen-
ters, and hospital-based ambulatory centers. The data-
base collects information including patient medical
history, anesthetic technique used, the occurrence of
adverse events, American Society of Anesthesiologists
(ASA) status, pain control, and postoperative nausea
and vomiting (PONV) for approximately 1500 partici-
pating physician and dentist anesthesiologists.14 Provid-
ers can use the information obtained by SCOR to
identify adverse events and improve anesthesia safety.
SCOR currently contains the largest pool of data for
cases of OBA performed by dentist anesthesiologists.
The objective of this study is to examine the outcomes of
dentist anesthesiologists providing office-based general
anesthesia for pediatric dental patients, as recorded in
the SCOR database.
METHODS
The data collection instrument was a validated Web-
based program completed by volunteer dentist anesthe-
siologists from the American Society of Dentist Anes-
thesiologists over a 4-year period extending from 2010
to 2014. All personal and relevant clinical data for both
patients and providers were deidentified and approval
from the Indiana University Human Subjects Medical
Institutional Review Board was obtained. Clinical data
points were drawn from the preoperative, intraopera-
tive, and postanesthesia phases of care (Appendix 1).
Adverse events were grouped into 3 categories: those
occurring predischarge, those occurring postdischarge,
and any adverse events (including any event that
occurred predischarge or postdischarge). Adverse events
belonging to each category are found in Appendix 2.
Data were extracted and imported into Statistical
Analysis System v9.3 (SAS institute Inc, Cary, NC) for
management and data analysis. The outcome of interest
was the frequency of adverse events during ambulatory
dental anesthesia procedures in children and their
association with patient factors. The study was designed
to have 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 in the
analysis of rare adverse events (2% occurrence rate),
using a categorical patient characteristic with a 25/75
split, assuming 2-sided tests conducted at a 5%
significance level. Categorical patient characteristics
with splits closer to 50/50, continuous patient charac-
teristics, and adverse events that occurred more fre-
quently had greater than 80% power. Categorical
variables were described with counts and percentages,
and continuous variables were summarized with de-
scriptive statistics. Associations of the patient charac-
teristics with adverse events were analyzed using logistic
regression, individually for each patient characteristic
and in multiple-variable models.
RESULTS
A total of 8322 entries from 25 dentist anesthesiologists
from the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists
were identified in the SCOR. This group represented
approximately 10% of the dentist anesthesiologists in
the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists.
Entries for patients above the age of 18 were excluded,

 as were entries with missing ASA class, age, sex, case
duration, anesthesia type, and facility type, leaving 7041
cases available for analysis.
Of the 7041 children, 5960 (84.6%) were age 6 and
below, 816 (11.5%) were ages 7–12, and 265 (3.76%)
were ages 13–18 (Figure). The mean age was 4.7 years
and the mean weight was 20.8 kg. Gender distribution
was nearly equal, with 3805 males (54.0%) and 3236
females (46.0%). Greater than 99% of the patients were
classified as ASA I or II physical status classification
(Table 1). The mean anesthesia time was 58.2 minutes,
and the mean recovery to discharge time was 22.5
minutes (Table 1).
Of the 7041 cases, 52 patients (0.74%) gave a prior
history of PONV and/or motion sickness, 7 (0.10%)
reported documented obstructive sleep apnea, and 71
(1.0%) reported suspected obstructive sleep apnea. Two
hundred forty-eight (3.52%) reported a pulmonary
comorbidity.
Of the 7041 cases, 4712 patients (66.9%) received
dexamethasone, 3967 (56.3%) received a serotonin
receptor antagonist, and 4 (0.06%) received another
antiemetic either prior to or during the case. The most
common airway management technique used was nasal/
oral airway, reported in 4459 cases (63.3%; Table 2).
Of the 7041 cases, 5521 patients (74.0%) were given
local anesthetic for dental rehabilitation, 86 (1.0%) of
which were reported as via peripheral nerve block and
5435 (73.0%) via local infiltration.
A summary of the incidence of adverse events is
reported in Table 3. The predischarge adverse event
occurring with the highest frequency was laryngospasm,
occurring in 35 cases (0.50%), followed by nausea or
vomiting requiring antiemetic rescue, occurring in 28
cases (0.40%). Twelve predischarge adverse events
(0.17%) were reported as ‘‘other.’’ Over 85% (30 cases)
of the total 35 cases of laryngospasms occurred in
children 6 and below; 8.5% (3 cases) occurred in
children 7–12 and 5.7% (2 cases) occurred in the 13–
18-year-old age group. Of the 30 laryngospasm cases in
patients age 6 and below, 15 cases each were noted in the
intubated group and the nonintubated group (Table 4).
A total of 1991 patients (28.3%) were reached for
follow-up by the dentist anesthesiologist following their
procedure. Of those, 99 (5.0%) reported experiencing
nausea since discharge, 65 (3.26%) reported vomiting
since discharge, and 6 (0.30%) reported difficulty
voiding since discharge. Of the 99 patients who reported
PONV, 83% (82) were age 6 and below, and 19 of those
patients (23.1%) received a perioperative antiemetic.
Fifteen patients that reported PONV were ages 7–12,
and 5 of them (33.3%) received a perioperative
antiemetic. Two patients who reported PONV were
ages 13–18, and both of these patients received a
perioperative antiemetic (Table 5).
Multivariable analysis was performed using a stepwise
model selection procedure (Table 6). Five sets of
analyses using logistic regression were performed: any
adverse events occurring predischarge, any respiratory

 adverse events, any recovery-related adverse events, any
postdischarge adverse events, and any adverse events.
Statistically significant (p , .05) results of analyzing the
risk factors individually are reported below.
In the multivariable analysis, a reported prior history
of PONV or motion sickness resulted in 12.81 times
increased likelihood of experiencing a recovery-related
adverse event, 5.94 times increased likelihood of having
any predischarge adverse event, and 3.65 times increased
likelihood of having any adverse event compared to a
patient with no prior history of PONV or motion
sickness.
If there was a reported patient history of a pulmonary
comorbidity there was 5.13 times increased likelihood of
experiencing a respiratory adverse event, 4.04 times
increased likelihood of experiencing any predischarge
adverse event, and 2.79 times increased likelihood of
experiencing any adverse event compared to a patient
with no reported pulmonary comorbidity.
If documented obstructive sleep apnea was present,
there was 16.67 times increased likelihood of a
respiratory adverse event, 14.29 times increased likeli-
hood of any predischarge adverse event, and 8.33 times
increased likelihood of any adverse event compared to
no documented history of obstructive sleep apnea.
If the patient airway was managed with an endotracheal
tube, there was a 4.36 times increased likelihood of
experiencing a respiratory adverse event and a 6.25 times
decreased likelihood of experiencing any postdischarge
adverse event compared to a patient whose airway was not
managed with an endotracheal tube. If the airway was
managed with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) there was a
15.11 times increased likelihood of experiencing an adverse
event in recovery and a 6.32 times increased likelihood of
experiencing any predischarge adverse event compared to
airway management without an LMA. For this analysis, 3
discrete methods of airway management were considered:
endotracheal intubation, LMA, and nasal/oral airway.
The use of a nasal cannula, nasal mask, or general
anesthesia face mask was considered to be a method of
supplemental oxygen delivery.
If a serotonin receptor antagonist (eg, ondansetron)
was administered there was 2.7 times less likelihood of
experiencing an adverse event in recovery compared to
when no intraoperative serotonin receptor antagonist
was administered. Similarly, if dexamethasone was not
administered there was 2.44 times increased likelihood
of experiencing any adverse event than if dexametha-
sone was administered. If no peripheral nerve anesthetic
block was given, the likelihood of any adverse event
occurring was 1.78 times greater than if a peripheral
nerve anesthetic block was given.
In this study, if general anesthesia was administered
using an inhalation anesthetic (gas), there was 3.57 times
increased likelihood of a respiratory adverse event
occurring and 1.37 times increased likelihood of any
adverse event occurring than if propofol alone was
administered for general anesthesia. Additionally, if
general anesthesia was performed with inhalation anes-

DISCUSSION
This study is the first to examine clinical outcomes of
OBA performed by dentist anesthesiologists on pediatric
dental patients. The term pediatric patient is often
broadly defined, and can encompass patients from
neonates to age 21.15 In this study, approximately
96% of patients were 12 years of age or younger.
Patients 6 years of age and below comprised 85% of the
patients treated. A 2012 survey of pediatric dentists in
private practice reported that 41.4% of their patients
were under age 5.16 Thus, these data are particularly
relevant to pediatric dentists, whose practices typically
share the same concentration of patients in the
preschool range.16,17
In 2012, Forsyth et al4 reported a mean general
anesthesia and dentist operator time required for
pediatric dental procedures at Seattle Children’s Hospi-
tal of 110 minutes. The mean anesthesia time of 58.2
minutes reported in our study compares favorably to
this and is a significant benefit when comparing OBA to
anesthesia performed in an operating room. Rashewsky
et al18 reported similar findings in a 2012 study that
concluded that ASA I pediatric patients can receive full-
mouth dental rehabilitation utilizing GA under the
direction of dentist anesthesiologists in an office-based
dental setting more quickly than in a hospital setting.
The mean anesthesia time in this study is also
remarkably similar to that in other published studies
examining dental rehabilitation. In a study of 7945
patients, Carter and Mohammed19 reported a combined
mean operative time of 56.09 minutes for induction,
operative procedure, and emergence. Similarly, a 2007
study of OBA for children with special health care needs
reported a mean procedure time of 56.2 minutes and
compared it to a mean procedure time of 130 minutes
for cases performed in a hospital operating room.20
The outcomes reported confirm many associations
that are expected by practitioners. For example, the data
demonstrate the association between a prior history of
obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary disorders and
the increased likelihood of adverse events during

 anesthesia procedures. The association found between a
prior history of PONV and occurrence of adverse events
was also expected, and was supported in the data.
PONV is an important adverse event, and a potential
cause of morbidity in children following anesthesia. The
incidence of postdischarge nausea and vomiting reported
in this study (5.0% for nausea and 3.26% for vomiting)
compares favorably to that in other published reports. In
1991, an overall PONV rate of 13.0% was reported in a
multicenter study of 551 children returning home after
outpatient surgery.21 More recent estimates of the overall
incidence of PONV in children undergoing all procedures
range between 8.9 and 42.0%.22 The 2 main factors that
account for this wide variation are age and type of
procedure. In 2006, a cohort study of 1401 children
identified a baseline rate of PONV in children around age
3 of approximately 3.0%, which increased 0.2–0.8% per
year and continued into adolescence.23 Certain proce-
dures, such as tonsillectomy, strabismus surgery, and
otoplasty, have been reported as being associated with an
increased risk of PONV; however, controversy exists as
to whether this is due to the procedure itself or the use of
opioids as part of the anesthetic regimen for these
surgeries.24 There are no studies reporting the relative risk
of PONV following dental rehabilitation under general
anesthesia in children; however, several risk factors,
including a tendency for low-grade postoperative bleed-
ing, use of intraoperative opioids and/or nitrous oxide,
and an increased opportunity for ingestion of blood,
secretions, and foreign materials following surgery,
should be considered.
It is noteworthy that a significant amount of post-
discharge PONV occurred despite the prior administra-
tion of antiemetic agents to over half of the 7041 patients
in this study (Table 5), and this is consistent with other
published reports. Stewart et al25 reported an overall
PONV incidence of 15.6% following tonsillectomy even
after the prophylactic administration of 0.4 mg/kg of
dexamethasone and 0.1–0.2 mg/kg of ondansetron.
However, this compares favorably to an early report of
70% incidence of PONV in children undergoing tonsil-
lectomy when no antiemetic prophylaxis was adminis-
tered.26 No consensus currently exists for antiemetic
dosing guidelines prior to dental rehabilitation. PONV
continues to be a significant source of distress for
pediatric patients and their caregivers following outpa-
tient anesthesia for all procedures. Further research in
this area would be of great interest and value to both the
dental anesthesia community and the greater community
of anesthesia providers that routinely treat children. The
results reported here are limited by the general design of
the study and the 28% follow-up rate. Further studies are
needed that more specifically address the management of
PONV in this population.
Nearly 86.0% of the total number (35 cases) of
laryngospasms that occurred in this study occurred in
children ages 6 and below (Table 4). This is consistent
with several studies that demonstrate significantly
higher rates of both reactive airway and laryngospasm
in young children.27–29 The distribution of laryngospasm
also corresponds to the age distribution of the study
sample, in which 85.0% of pediatric patients seen by
American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists dentist
anesthesiologists were age 6 and younger, 12.0% were
between the ages of 7 and 12, and 4% were between the
ages of 13 and 18 (Figure). Thus, the incidence of
laryngospasm is distributed proportionally across all
ages in this sample, consistent with patterns seen in
previously published studies.
Interestingly, there was no difference in frequency of
laryngospasm found when comparing intubated to
nonintubated airways (Table 4). Providing general
anesthesia with a nonintubated airway is sometimes
thought to make the patient more prone to laryngo-
spasm. This is because secretions, blood, irrigation
fluids, and other debris can irritate a glottis that is not
protected with an endotracheal tube during the intra-
operative, or maintenance, phase of anesthesia. In
contrast, it is also known that the physical contact of
an endotracheal tube or endotracheal cuff with the vocal
cords can cause laryngospasm during light levels of
anesthesia and irritate a reactive airway.30 Laryngo-
spasms that occur when endotracheal tube airway
management is used are most expected during the
induction and emergence phases of anesthesia.31 Al-
though a statistically significant association (p ¼ .0014)
was found in this study between the use of an
endotracheal tube and respiratory adverse events, most
frequently laryngospasm, the data set in this study is not
sensitive enough to distinguish between laryngospasms
that occurred during induction, maintenance, and/or
emergence. However, the even distribution of laryngo-
spasms found between intubated and nonintubated
cases does not support the belief that anesthesia without
an endotracheal tube is inherently more prone to
laryngospasm than anesthesia with intubation. Further
studies are needed to investigate and clarify this
observation.
Regarding airway management techniques, the use of
nasal cannula, nasal mask, or face mask as a sole means
for oxygenation (ie, natural airway) is not clearly
described in these data. Overall, it appeared that 7.8%
of the cases entered used only a nasal cannula/mask for
oxygenating a natural airway. This number is slightly
inflated because of 1 outlying center that reported
29.5% of cases. All of the other centers reported rates
below 10%, with the average being 5.8%. In contrast to
this, only 0.7% reported the sole use of a GA face mask,

149
 with an average of 0.8% and none reporting more than
4%. In practical terms, these 2 categories of natural
airway techniques probably represent patients undergo-
ing mask induction for very brief procedures or
moderate/deep sedation with a nasal cannula, perhaps
being augmented by brief period(s) of GA. Further
studies are needed to address questions regarding the
preference of airway management techniques by dentist
anesthesiologists for OBA.
Similarly, an LMA for airway management was used
in less than 1% of cases in this study (Table 2). The data
collection instrument did not differentiate between
LMAs placed intentionally at the beginning of the case
and those placed intraoperatively to correct suboptimal
ventilation during nonintubated general anesthesia. For
this reason, and because of the low number of cases that
included an LMA, it is not possible to determine cause-
effect relationships between the use of an LMA and
adverse events in this study.
There have been conflicting views as to whether local
anesthetic used in conjunction with general anesthesia
improves the quality of intraoperative anesthesia and
recovery. In a randomized controlled study, Sammons et
al32 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in
pain following dental extractions if local anesthetic was
used during general anesthesia, although the decrease
was significant only for 5 minutes postprocedure.
Conversely, Al-Bahlani et al33 reported an increase in
postoperative distress in children recovering from
general anesthesia who received infiltration with local
anesthetic. In a survey of American Academy of
Pediatric Dentistry members, Townsend et al34 reported
there is no consensus among members on the use of
local anesthesia during dental rehabilitation under
general anesthesia. In a separate study, Townsend et
al35 surveyed dentist anesthesiologists and 90.0%
reported they preferred administration of local anesthe-
sia, citing benefits including stabilization of vital signs/
decreased depth of general anesthesia and improved
patient recovery. Our findings are consistent with the
survey of Townsend et al35 of dentist anesthesiologists,
showing a strong predilection for the administration of
local anesthesia to young children undergoing general
anesthesia administered by a dentist anesthesiologist for
general anesthesia. Unfortunately, the data do not
distinguish whether the dentist anesthesiologist or the
restorative dentist provided local anesthesia.
Our results are consistent with previously published
studies that demonstrate a relatively higher incidence of
postoperative adverse events associated with inhalation
anesthetics versus propofol for general anesthesia.36–38
Emergence agitation and airway excitement are known
complications of anesthesia induction and maintenance
using sevoflurane, and the use of propofol for mainte-
nance anesthesia is known to provide a smoother
recovery.36–38 The results of this study are similar to
those reported in previous studies in that compared
outcomes following inhalation-based anesthesia to
propofol-based anesthesia.36,38
The authors recognize that an inherent limitation of
this study is that outcomes are self-reported into the
SCOR database by the dentist anesthesiologist. Other
major outcomes registries in anesthesia share this
limitation. For example, the National Anesthesia
Clinical Outcomes Registry, which is the source of
many published anesthesia outcomes studies, shares this
limitation. When the SCOR database was developed, its
purpose was to help anesthesia providers track and
improve procedural outcomes in their own practices by
comparing their outcomes to other, anonymous dental
anesthesia practices. The relatively large size of this
sample of dentist anesthesiologists also supports the
notion that this subset of dentist anesthesiologists
reflects the experience of the American Society of
Dentist Anesthesiologists.
This study provides strong clinical outcomes data to
support the safety of OBA as performed by dentist
anesthesiologists. The adverse events noted here com-
pare favorably to the published outcomes studies of
comparable office-based anesthetics. Further outcomes
studies are encouraged for this emerging group of
anesthesia providers to further define their practice
and develop evidence-based best practices.
