ABSTRACT 
1 
Objective: Evidence suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean (MedDiet) or MIND diet is 
2 
neuroprotective but the association between these dietary patterns and cognition has not been 
3 
evaluated in a nationally representative population of older US adults.  
4 
Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. 
5 
Participants/setting: Community-dwelling older adults from the Health and Retirement Study (n 
6 
= 5,907).     
7 
Measurements: Adherence to dietary patterns was determined from food frequency 
8 
questionnaires using a priori criteria to generate diet scores for MedDiet (range = 0-55) and MIND 
9 
diet (range 0-15). Cognitive performance was measured using a composite test score of global 
10 
cognitive function (range 0-27). Linear regression was used to compare cognitive performance 
11 
across tertiles of dietary pattern. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between 
12 
dietary patterns and clinically significant cognitive impairment. Models were adjusted for age, 
13 
gender, race, educational attainment and other health and lifestyle covariates. 
14 
Results: Mean age of participants was 68 ± 10.8 years. Compared to those with low MedDiet 
15 
score, participants with mid and high score were less likely to have poor cognitive performance 
16 
(OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71, 1.02: P = 0.08, and OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.81: P < 0.001, respectively) 
17 
in fully adjusted models. Results for the MIND diet were similar. Higher score in each dietary 
18 
pattern was independently associated with significantly better cognitive function (P < 0.001) in a 
19 
dose-response manner (PTREND < 0.001).  
20 
Conclusion: In a large nationally representative population of older adults, greater adherence to 
21 
the MedDiet and MIND diet was independently associated with better cognitive function and lower 
22 
risk of cognitive impairment. Clinical trials are required to elucidate the role of dietary patterns in 
23 
cognitive aging.

INTRODUCTION 
26 
Dementia is a major cause of death and disability in older Americans1 and there is considerable 
27 
interest in identifying lifestyle approaches, such as diet, for prevention of cognitive decline during 
28 
aging2. 
29 
 
30 
The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts, olive oil and fish, 
31 
is proven to have vascular3 and anti-inflammatory4 benefits and may also be neuroprotective. 
32 
Greater adherence to the MedDiet is associated with slower rate of cognitive decline5-6, reduced 
33 
risk of cognitive impairment7-8 and dementia5,8 but findings are conflicting9-11 largely owing to 
34 
significant heterogeneity between studies in terms of populations studied and methods used to 
35 
assess diet and cognition. Studies from the US have limited generalizability due to a lack of 
36 
representative study populations and multiple publications from the same cohorts. Additionally, 
37 
most prospective studies have used population-specific median food intake thresholds to measure 
38 
MedDiet adherence and this approach further limits the generalizability and comparability of 
39 
findings, as similar scores reflect different eating patterns in different cohorts12. The MedDiet 
40 
score13 is a different approach which uses absolute food intake targets derived from a Greek 
41 
population and allows for more meaningful comparison between studies. Higher MedDiet score 
42 
has been associated with slower rate of cognitive decline14-16 in a small number of studies that have 
43 
used this dietary assessment method.  
44 
In summary, evidence to date is suggestive of a neuroprotective role for MedDiet but variation 
45 
between studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further investigation is needed to 
46 
determine whether the MedDiet represents an optimal dietary pattern for protection against 
47 
neurodegeneration in representative populations.  
48 
 6 
 
Another proposed neuroprotective dietary pattern, called MIND (Mediterranean-DASH diet 
49 
Intervention for Neurodegeneration Delay), has been recently described16. The MIND diet is a 
50 
modified version of MedDiet but incorporates additional foods based on current evidence in the 
51 
diet-dementia field16. In one population-based study, the MIND score was more predictive of 
52 
cognitive decline than the MedDiet score16 and higher MIND score was associated with reduced 
53 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)17. While these results in mostly older white females are encouraging, 
54 
they require confirmation in other populations.  
55 
 
56 
We aimed to determine the association between proposed neuroprotective dietary patterns 
57 
characterized by the MedDiet and MIND scores, and objectively measured cognitive performance 
58 
in a large sample of older adults from the nationally-representative population-based Health and 
59 
Retirement Study (HRS).   
60 
 
 
61 
 7 
 
METHODS 
62 
We used data from the HRS, a longitudinal, nationally representative survey in 30,000 community-
63 
dwelling adults aged > 50 years. The HRS commenced in 1992 to collect data on the antecedents 
64 
and consequences of retirement in US adults and follows approximately 20,000 participants 
65 
biennially. A detailed description of HRS has been published elsewhere18. The HRS was approved 
66 
by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan. All participants 
67 
provided their consent on enrollment.  
68 
  
69 
This present study is a cross-sectional analysis of participants from a core wave 12 survey (2014) 
70 
who completed the HRS Health Care and Nutrition (HCNS) substudy (n = 8,035). The HCNS diet 
71 
assessment was conducted between November 2013 and May 2014, and cognitive, demographic 
72 
and covariate data were drawn from the core 2014 survey. We excluded respondents who required 
73 
a by-proxy core 2014 interview and those with missing or incomplete cognitive data (n = 981). 
74 
We also excluded those who reported extreme energy intakes outside of predefined levels (<800 
75 
or >8000 kcal/d for men and <600 or >6000 kcal/d for women) (n =291) and those who reported 
76 
dementia or AD (n = 140) or stroke (n = 430), and those with missing covariates (n = 286). After 
77 
exclusions, the final analytic sample was 5,907 participants.  
78 
 
79 
Dietary assessment 
80 
Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 163-item semi-quantitative Harvard Food Frequency 
81 
Questionnaire (FFQ)19,20. Adherence to MedDiet and MIND dietary patterns was assessed by 
82 
calculating summary scores using predefined criteria13,16 (as shown in Supplementary Table S1 
83 
and S2). First, we selected FFQ food item(s) to create dietary components relevant for each dietary 
84 
 8 
 
pattern. Next, we assigned individual scores for dietary components based on the frequency of 
85 
recommended intake servings. 
86 
 
87 
MedDiet score 
88 
MedDiet score13 comprises 11 dietary components corresponding to consumption frequency of 
89 
foods consistent with the traditional MedDiet. Dietary components were scored 0–5 in agreement 
90 
with predefined frequencies of serving for each point value and then summed to obtain a total score 
91 
ranging from 0 to 55. Scores for dietary components consistent with the MedDiet (nonrefined 
92 
grains, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, olive oil) increase as consumption frequency 
93 
increases and scores for food groups not characteristic of a MedDiet (red meat, poultry, full fat 
94 
dairy products) decrease as consumption frequency increases. Alcohol intake was determined 
95 
using frequency of alcoholic drinks daily (1 drink equivalent to 150mls; approximately 12g 
96 
ethanol) and scored nonlinearly, with a score of 0 for no consumption or >4.5 drinks/day through 
97 
to a maximum score of 5 for up to 2 drinks/day. Overall, higher MedDiet score indicates greater 
98 
adherence to the traditional MedDiet.  
99 
 
100 
MIND score 
101 
MIND score16 consists of 15 dietary components in which 10 are considered brain healthy food 
102 
groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, seafood, 
103 
poultry, olive oil, and wine) and five are considered unhealthy food groups (red meats, butter and 
104 
stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried/fast food). Dietary components were scored 
105 
0, 0.5, or 1 depending on level of consumption. Olive oil use was scored 1 if intake ≥ 1 tbsp. daily 
106 
and 0 otherwise. Scores for the 10 healthy components increased monotonically with higher 
107 
 9 
 
consumption of reported servings, and scores were reversed for the five unhealthy components. 
108 
Dietary component scores were then summed to obtain an overall score ranging from 0-15, where 
109 
higher scores indicate greater adherence to the MIND diet.   
110 
 
111 
Cognitive assessment  
112 
Cognitive performance was assessed by a global cognition score comprising three items: (1) 
113 
immediate and delayed recall of 10 words from a word list randomly assigned for each participant 
114 
(0-20 points), (2) backward counting (0-2 points), and, (3) serial seven subtraction (0-5 points)21. 
115 
Possible scores ranged from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating better overall cognitive function 
116 
in domains of episodic memory, attention and working memory22. Clinically significant poor 
117 
cognitive performance was defined as ≥1 SD below the mean global cognition score.   
118 
 
119 
Covariates 
120 
Covariates of age, gender and race (white, black or other) were included. We also selected health 
121 
and lifestyle covariates previously identified as potential modifiable risk factors for cognitive 
122 
decline and dementia2: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, depression, low educational attainment, 
123 
physical inactivity and obesity. Depressive symptoms were determined using a Center for 
124 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D8) short form score (score 0-8) with active depression 
125 
symptoms defined as a CES-D8 cut point of ≥423. Low educational attainment was classified as 
126 
completing less than high school education and physical inactivity was defined as engaging in 
127 
vigorous activity less than twice weekly, as used in a previous HRS analysis24. Obesity was defined 
128 
as a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2.  
129 
Statistical analysis 
130 
 10 
 
Participant characteristics were compared with tertiles of dietary pattern scores using descriptive 
131 
statistical tests. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparison was used for continuous 
132 
variables and chi-square test was used for categorical variables, with corresponding tests for linear 
133 
trend. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to examine correlations for continuous variables. 
134 
A multivariable general linear model was applied to investigate associations between dietary 
135 
patterns (MedDiet and MIND score modelled in tertiles) and global cognition score. Participants 
136 
in tertile 1 (lowest diet adherence) were the reference group for each analysis. Models were 
137 
adjusted firstly for classic confounders age, gender, race and educational attainment (less than high 
138 
school vs high school or more), and subsequently for potential mediators total wealth as a measure 
139 
of socioeconomic status (total assets – total debt), hypertension (Yes/No), diabetes (Yes/No), 
140 
current smoking (Yes/No), depression (CES-D8 ≥4), physical inactivity (Yes/No), obesity (BMI 
141 
≥30 vs BMI <30) and total energy intake (kcals/day). The risk of poor cognitive performance 
142 
associated with adherence to each dietary pattern was estimated by using binary logistic regression 
143 
analyses with corresponding odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for 
144 
covariates using the same approach described above. Sensitivity analyses were carried out after 
145 
removal of individuals classified as demented on the global cognition score. In addition, analyses 
146 
were repeated after applying a priori defined Greek cut-points to MedDiet tertiles (0-20, 21-35 
147 
and 36-55). Analyses were performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS 
151 
The mean (SD) age of the 5, 907 participants was 68 ± 10.8 years at the core 2014 survey. Overall, 
152 
60% were women and 78% were white. Mean diet score was 27.6 ± 5.4 for MedDiet and 7.3 ± 1.8 
153 
for MIND, indicating moderate adherence for each dietary pattern. Average MedDiet score was 
154 
similar to that reported in a Greek population 26.3 ± 3.213. As shown in Table 1, participants with 
155 
highest MedDiet adherence were younger, more likely to be physically active and less likely to be 
156 
hypertensive, diabetic or obese, with higher educational attainment and fewer reported depressive 
157 
symptoms, compared with those with lowest adherence. Demographics were similar for MIND, 
158 
but there was no observed difference in diabetes across tertiles of MIND score. 
159 
 
160 
Both diet scores were positively correlated (r = 0.68, P < 0.001) and showed a fair level of 
161 
agreement in the population (Cohen’s kappa 0.36, P < 0.001).Weekly servings of wholegrains, 
162 
vegetables, fruit, fish, nuts and olive oil increased linearly across tertiles for each dietary pattern 
163 
(PTREND < 0.001) with individuals in the high tertile consuming between 2-3 times more than those 
164 
in the low tertile. Conversely, weekly consumption of red meat decreased linearly across tertiles 
165 
of diet score (PTREND < 0.001). 
166 
 
167 
Table 2 shows unadjusted and adjusted global cognition score across tertiles of dietary patterns. 
168 
Compared to participants with mid or low levels of adherence, those with high adherence to 
169 
MedDiet or MIND had significantly better cognitive performance (P < 0.001 for both dietary 
170 
patterns). In fully adjusted models, these associations were attenuated but individuals with highest 
171 
diet adherence had significantly better cognitive scores (by 1.0 and 0.8 points for MedDiet and 
172 
 12 
 
MIND respectively) than those with mid and low adherence and these associations showed a dose-
173 
response relationship (PTREND < 0.001).  
174 
 
175 
Impaired cognitive performance, defined as > 1SD (4.3 points) below the mean global cognitive 
176 
score, was found in 831 (14%) participants. Figure 1 shows the adjusted likelihood of having poor 
177 
cognitive performance with adherence to the dietary patterns. Compared to participants with low 
178 
MedDiet score, those with mid score had 15 % lower odds of having poor cognitive performance 
179 
(OR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.02: P = 0.08). The association was significantly stronger for those with 
180 
highest MedDiet score who had 35% lower odds of having poor cognitive performance compared 
181 
to those with lowest score (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.81: P < 0.001). Results were similar for 
182 
individuals with mid and high MIND score (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.70, 1.03: P =0.10 and OR 0.70; 
183 
95% CI: 0.56, 0.86: P = 0.001, respectively) when compared to those with low MIND score. In 
184 
fully adjusted linear models, each 1 SD increase (5.4 units) in MedDiet was associated with 15% 
185 
lower odds of poor cognitive performance (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.78, 0.93, P < 0.001) and each 1 SD 
186 
increase (1.8 units) in MIND diet was associated with 14% lower odds of poor cognitive 
187 
performance (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79, 0.94, P < 0.001). 
188 
 
189 
Analyses were repeated after removing participants with global cognition scores ≤ 6 (n = 143) but 
190 
no notable changes were found in observed results. We also repeated the analyses using a priori 
191 
defined cut-points for MedDiet tertiles derived from a Greek population13 and similar results were 
192 
observed. In fully adjusted models, individuals in the highest Greek MedDiet tertile had 35% lower 
193 
odds of cognitive impairment OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.98: P = 0.04) compared with those in the 
194 
lowest Greek tertile.

DISCUSSION 
196 
In this large general population of community-dwelling older adults, neuroprotective dietary 
197 
patterns characterized by MedDiet and MIND score were significantly associated with moderately 
198 
better cognitive performance in a dose-response relationship. Individuals with the highest 
199 
adherence to neuroprotective diets had a 30-35% lower risk of cognitive impairment defined as > 
200 
1SD or 4.3 points below the population mean global cognition score. While, the incidence of 
201 
clinical cognitive impairment on the global cognition score was relatively low (14%) in this 
202 
healthy population, our findings lend support to the hypothesis that diet modification may be an 
203 
important public health strategy to protect against neurodegeneration during aging.  
204 
 
205 
This study adds to the limited work done to investigate relations between dietary patterns and brain 
206 
health. Although previous prospective studies examining associations between MedDiet and 
207 
cognitive outcomes have largely reported contradictory findings, evidence is strengthened by 
208 
recent results from the PREDIMED trial sub-study which demonstrated small but significant 
209 
improvements in cognitive function in response to increasing MedDiet adherence26. To date, the 
210 
effects of MIND on cognitive health have not been evaluated, however, greater adherence to 
211 
MIND is linked with slower rates of cognitive decline16 and reduced risk of AD17. These studies 
212 
have been conducted exclusively in one older, largely female, population from the Rush Memory 
213 
and Aging Project and require replication in other cohorts. Our findings support a protective 
214 
association of MIND on cognitive performance in a general population. 
215 
 
216 
MedDiet and MIND have similar dietary profiles and recommend high intakes of plant foods, 
217 
limited meat consumption, moderate intake of alcohol (wine in particular) and use of olive oil as 
218 
 14 
 
a primary fat source. Unique to MIND are green vegetables and berries which are independently 
219 
reported to offer protection against neurodegeneration12. In contrast, the MedDiet places greater 
220 
emphasis on potatoes, fish and overall fruit and vegetable intake. Both dietary patterns are rich in 
221 
antioxidants, monounsaturated and n-3 fatty acids and low in saturated fat. These individual 
222 
nutrients have also been independently related to cognitive performance, for example, 
223 
observational evidence has shown association between monounsaturated fat and n-3 fatty acids 
224 
and a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia5, whereas increased saturated fat intake is 
225 
shown to increase risk of cognitive decline and dementia27. However, the biological mechanisms 
226 
for how dietary patterns exert neuroprotective effects are not clear. Several putative mechanisms 
227 
for the MedDiet have been proposed28, and include beneficial impacts on neuronal cell signalling, 
228 
vascular, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biological pathways, but more comprehensive 
229 
investigation is required. Furthermore, while the MedDiet and the new MIND diet have attracted 
230 
most attention in the literature, they may not reflect an optimal dietary pattern for protection against 
231 
neurodegeneration during aging.  
232 
 
233 
Strengths of this study include its large sample size and community-based population of older 
234 
adults which increases the external validity of findings. In addition, an extensively validated semi-
235 
quantitative FFQ was used to assess the dietary exposure. Furthermore, we generated dietary 
236 
scores based on predefined absolute food intake thresholds and this approach increases the ability 
237 
to meaningfully compare our findings with studies that employ a similar standardized dietary 
238 
pattern methodology. A major limitation is the cross-sectional study design meaning we were 
239 
unable to establish a causal relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive outcomes. In 
240 
addition, dietary misclassification is possible as individuals may have changed their eating 
241 
 15 
 
behavior as a result of cognitive impairment or other disease, although in our sensitivity models, 
242 
removal of those with low cognitive scores did not alter the findings. As with all observational 
243 
study, residual confounding is a possibility even though we adjusted the analyses for known diet-
244 
dementia confounders. Finally, the use of a summary cognition score allowed us to examine global 
245 
cognitive function but not individual cognitive domains which may be differentially influenced by 
246 
age and lifestyle factors.  
247 
 
248 
In conclusion, this study shows that greater adherence to MedDiet and MIND dietary patterns are 
249 
associated with better overall cognitive function in older adults and lower odds of cognitive 
250 
impairment that could have important public health implications for preservation of cognition 
251 
during aging. Given the limited evidence base and lack of clear dietary recommendations for 
252 
cognitive health, further prospective population-based studies and clinical trials are required to 
253 
elucidate the role of dietary patterns in cognitive aging and brain health.
