Brown adipose tissue (BAT) provides a means of nonshivering
thermogenesis. In humans, active BAT can be visualized by
18F-FDG uptake as detected by PET combined with CT. The retro-
spective analysis of clinical scans is a valuable source to identify
anthropometric parameters that influence BAT mass and activity
and thus the potential efficacy of envisioned drugs targeting this
tissue to treat metabolic disease. Methods: We analyzed 2,854
18F-FDG PET/CT scans from 1,644 patients and identified 98 scans
from 81 patients with active BAT. We quantified the volume of active
BAT depots (mean values in mL 6 SD: total BAT, 162 6 183 [n 5 98];
cervical, 40 6 37 [n 5 53]; supraclavicular, 66 6 68 [n 5 71]; para-
vertebral, 51 6 53 [n 5 69]; mediastinal, 43 6 40 [n 5 51]; subphrenic,
21 6 21 [n 5 29]). Because only active BAT is detectable by 18F-FDG
uptake, these numbers underestimate the total amount of BAT. Con-
sidering only 32 scans of the highest activity as categorized by a visual
scoring strategy, we determined a mean total BAT volume of 308 6
208 mL. In 30 BAT-positive patients with 3 or more repeated scans, we
calculated a much higher mean probability to redetect active BAT
(52% 6 25%) as compared with the overall prevalence of 4.9%. We
calculated a BAT activity index (BFI) based on volume and intensity of
individual BAT depots. Results: We detected higher total BFI in youn-
ger patients (P 5 0.009), whereas sex, body mass index, height, mass,
outdoor temperature, and blood parameters did not affect total or depot-
specific BAT activity. Surprisingly, renal creatinine clearance as esti-
mated from mass, age, and plasma creatinine was a significant
predictor of BFI on the total (P 5 0.005) as well as on the level of several
individual depots. In summary, we detected a high amount of more than
300 mL of BAT tissue. Conclusion: BAT-positive patients represent a
group with a higher than usual probability to activate BAT during a scan.
Estimated renal creatinine clearance correlated with the extent of acti-
vated BAT in a given scan. These data imply an efficacy of drugs
targeting BAT to treat metabolic disease that is at the same time higher
and subject to a larger individual variation than previously assumed.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ well stud-
ied in small rodent species that is able to dissipate nutrient energy
in the form of heat. Before the advent of PET combined with CT
as a diagnostic tool to detect 18F-FDG uptake, active BAT in adult
humans was considered nonexistent or negligible. In 2002, Hany
et al. for the first time reported an increased uptake of labeled
glucose (18F-FDG) into adipose tissue depots using a combined
18F-FDG PET/CT (1). The most intensive tracer uptake was iden-
tified in cervical, supraclavicular, paravertebral, mediastinal, and
rarely subphrenic locations. Because of the strong symmetry of
increased tracer uptake, these findings were not compatible with a
malignant tissue, other nonspecific changes (e.g., inflammation), or
muscular activity (2). In 2009, 3 independent studies finally reported
the unequivocal interpretation of said signals as metabolically active
BAT (3–5). In clinical practice, activated BAT disturbs diagnosis
(6). Particularly in the context of tumor diagnosis, this is a not-to-
be-underestimated problem (7–10). Knowledge about the causes
of BAT activation and its suppression are therefore of interest in
the context of clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations (11,12).
The prevalence of 18F-FDG PET/CT–detected, active BAT in
retrospective studies varies between 1% and 10% in adult patients
(13–17). However, in a study analyzing biopsies, a much higher
BAT prevalence of 84% was found (18). Obviously, the detection
of human BAT is often prevented by inactive tissue without glucose
uptake. Known factors that promote the incidence of active BAT are
age, sex, body mass, plasma glucose, time of season, outdoor tem-
perature, and certain drugs taken by the patient (8,14,19–23).
By its glucose uptake, activated BAT may lower glucose and
insulin levels in patients with extended areas of active BAT. It has
been discussed whether a high BAT activity may positively affect
glucose metabolism (24,25). The main energy source of thermo-
genic BAT, however, is fat, some of which is imported from the
blood (26). It is thus assumed that brown fat lowers blood lipids,
which may result in a positive effect on the development of ath-
erosclerotic vascular changes (27,28). Thus, the quantitative mea-
surement of active BAT is of great interest because of its potential
role as a pharmacologic target organ to treat widespread metabolic
disease including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (24–28).
In this study, we analyzed archived clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT
scans. BAT-positive subjects formed a distinct subgroup of patients
that was extensively characterized. We determined total and re-
gional brown fat mass and activity as a basis for efficacy projections
of putative BAT-activating drugs and uncovered correlating clinical

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Acquisition
We analyzed all
18F-FDG PET/CT (Biograph mCT; Siemens
Healthcare) examinations acquired between September 2011 and Au-
gust 2012 at the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Technical Univer-
sity of Munich, Germany. BAT-positive scans were defined as showing
symmetric tracer retention in projection on CT morphologic adipose
tissue (2250 to 250 Hounsfield units). All patients fasted for about
4 h before the examination. Injected activities for 18F-FDG ranged
from 148 to 493 MBq, with a mean of 357 MBq. About 88 6 15 min
after tracer injection, the examination was performed. The CT scan
protocol included a low-dose CT (26 mAs, 120 kV, 5-mm slice thick-
ness) from the base of the skull to the mid thigh for attenuation
correction followed by the PET scan and in most cases a contrast-
enhanced CT (240 mAS, 120 kV, 5-mm slice thickness) in the portal
venous phase approximately 70–80 s after contrast fluid injection.
PET scans were obtained with 5–7 bed positions of 2–3 min each.
PET data were reconstructed as 128 · 128 pixel images. Images
were reconstructed by an attenuation-weighted ordered-subsets ex-
pectation maximization algorithm (4 iterations, 8 subsets) followed
by a postreconstruction smoothing gaussian filter (5 mm in full
width at half maximum). A total of 2,854 PET examinations were
evaluated in 1,644 patients. The institutional review board (or
equivalent) approved this study, and all subjects signed a written
informed consent form.
Image Analysis
Visual evaluation of PET images was assisted by software (Osirix,
64-bit version; Aycan Digital Systems) running on a Macintosh/OS X,
version 10.10.3 platform (Apple Inc.). A semiquantitative measurement
of SUVs and activated BAT volume were evaluated on a SYNGO
workstation (Siemens). Depots showing a high metabolic activity with
at least 2.0 g per milliliter of 18F-FDG uptake in projection of fatty
tissue (2250 to 250 Hounsfield units) in the typical localizations of
CT correlation were defined as BAT-positive. For semiquantitative
SUVmean evaluation, we used a 3-dimensional volume of interest with
a growing seeded method.
Statistical Analysis
We compared BAT-positive and BAT-negative patient groups with
2-sided t tests when normally distributed (Table 1) or with a nonpara-
metric Mann–Whitney test if not normally distributed (Supplemental
Figs. 1C and 3 [supplemental materials are available at http://jnm.
snmjournals.org]).

within
groups was compared by the Fisher exact
test.
The
relationship between
age/body
mass index (BMI) and number of active
BAT depots was analyzed both by linear re-
gression using depot number as a numeric
value and by 1-way ANOVA using depot
number as categoric values (Supplemental
Figs. 1A and 1B). Correlation between
BAT activity index (BFI) and BMI, age, or
renal creatinine clearance was analyzed by
nonparametric Spearman correlation analy-
ses (Supplemental Figs. 4 and 5). Alterna-
tively, we analyzed log-transformed BFI data
with linear regression analyses and identified
the same groups to be significantly correlated
as those by the Spearman method. Analyses
were performed using software (GraphPad
Prism 6 [GraphPad Software] and SPSS
[IBM]).
RESULTS
Detection of High Amount of BAT
We found 98 scans (81 patients) with
activated BAT among 2,854 evaluated 18F-
FDG PET/CT scans. These 98 scans strongly

 varied in the extent of BAT and thus in the severity of putative
interference with tumor diagnosis. To classify 18F-FDG uptake into
clinically relevant categories, we proposed a visual scoring system of
4 scores: 1, lower than liver; 2, comparable to liver; 3, higher than
liver; and 4, comparable to brain (Figs. 1A and 1B).
Taking into account only the scan with the most intense BAT
activity for patients with multiple positive scans, this procedure
resulted in 6 patients with score 1, 14 with score 2, 29 with score
3, and 32 with score 4 (Fig. 1C). The mean SUVmean ranged from
2.27 in score 1 to 3.26 in score 4. Mean total volume of active
BAT ranged from 11.8 mL in score 1 to 308.1 mL in patients of
score 4. This volume was determined by a cutoff value, and there-
fore an underestimation due to low spatial resolution of the PET
technique is low. However, by overlooking small nests of active
brown fat cells, the true volume may be even higher.
We defined 5 different anatomic BAT
locations: subphrenic, paravertebral, me-
diastinal, cervical, and supraclavicular.
With increasing overall BAT activity, the
number of active depots increased from
cranial to caudal. Young patients tended to
activate more depots whereas BMI and sex
did not play a role (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Of 98 BAT-positive scans, all 5 depots
were active in only 26 scans, all of them
score 4. We thus assumed that score 4 does
not describe patients with unusually high
amounts of BAT, but rather patients who
have fully activated all BAT present dur-
ing the respective scan. Along this line,
the 308.1-mL mean BAT volume of 32
BAT-positive score 4 scans may be
regarded as reflecting the true total BAT
volume better than the mean volume of
162 6 183 mL of all 98 scans.
In summary, the visual score we proposed correlates well with
volume and SUV. Patients with fully active BAT (score 4) display
a surprisingly high amount of BAT.
Positive Patients Form Subgroup More Likely to Activate
Brown Fat During Scanning
The prevalence of patients with at least 1 positive scan was
4.9% (81/1,644). Age and sex displayed a striking impact on the
probability to detect active BAT as quantified in a comparison of
BAT-positive patients (n 5 81) with the remaining BAT-negative
patient population (n 5 1,563). The mean age of BAT-negative
patients in the overall cohort was much higher than in BAT-
positive patients (60 6 15 vs. 38 6 17 y; P , 0.001) (Fig. 2A).
Prevalence in women (7.1%; 54/761) differed from men (3.1%;
27/883), resulting in a different ratio of male to female patients in
the BAT-negative as compared with the
BAT-positive group (P , 0.001) (Fig.
2B). Thus, the typical BAT-positive patient
is more often female and by far younger
than a random patient of the total cohort.
From the literature, it is clear that many
more human subjects feature activatable
BAT than detected during routine clinical
18F-FDG PET/CT scans. In fact, virtually all
young subjects display BAT activity when
challenged by cold exposure (5,29). The dif-
ferent age and sex composition of BAT-pos-
itive and BAT-negative patients in our study
does therefore not imply a higher BAT inci-
dence in young females but a higher proba-
bility to activate BAT during a clinical
scan. To quantify this increased probability,
we identified 30 of the 81 BAT-positive pa-
tients with 3 or more repeated scans in our
archive (including scans outside the ini-
tially selected period of 1 y). In these 30
patients, we indeed calculated a much higher
mean probability to redetect active BAT
(52% 6 25%) as compared with the overall
prevalence of 4.9% (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
the percentage of positive scans was higher in

 male than in female patients (P 5 0.029). Although women were more
likely to be BAT-positive (Fig. 2B), those men who were BAT-positive
were more consistently so (Fig. 3, inset).
In summary, BAT-positive patients clearly represented a group with
higher than usual probability to activate BAT during a clinical scan.
Case-Control Design Reveals Effect of Temperature and
Season on Probability to Activate Brown Fat
Patients with active BAT differed markedly from the total study
population in age and sex (Fig. 2). We created a control group that
matched the BAT-positive (case) group in these 2 parameters to
possibly uncover parameters correlating to BAT activation with
lower effect size. The case group was formed by the 81 patients
with 98 BAT-positive scans during the investigation period.
Each patient of this case group was assigned a random patient
with the same age and sex, but without BAT activity. These 81
patients underwent 97 BAT-negative scans during the investiga-
tion period.
The stratified data were designed to display no difference in age
and sex distribution and, in addition, did not reveal a difference in
BMI between case and control group (Table 1). We cannot decide
whether a BMI difference was removed by the stratification or
whether it never existed in the first place, because for practical
reasons we were unable to extract BMI data for the entire collec-
tive of 1,644 patients. In any case, a possible BMI difference
between the BAT-positive group and the total collective would
have been secondary to differences in age and sex, because no
difference persisted in the case-control design (Table 1). Further
parameters tested without a significant difference between BAT-
positive case and BAT-negative control group patients included
body mass and height; waiting time between tracer injection
and scanning; administered amount of activity; and the blood
parameters glucose, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone
(not shown). Taken together, no anthropometric or procedural
parameter influenced the probability to active BAT when effects
of age and sex were removed. The same is true for disease states: a
connective, pathophysiologic element could not be identified and
thus disease state did not influence BAT activity in our dataset,
with the possible exception of thyroid carcinoma, an association to
be corroborated by future studies (Supplemental Fig. 2).
The influence of climatic factors on the probability to activate
thermogenic BAT was assessed by researching average and
minimal daily outdoor temperature at the time of each individ-
ual scan obtained from a weather station of the German weather
service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) at Munich Airport. Both
average and minimal temperatures were drastically lower in
the case group (average, 11.8�C vs. 14.7�C, P 5 0.024; mini-
mal, 1.6�C vs. 6.7�C, P , 0.0001) (Figs. 4A and 4B). This
finding led us to sort case and control group scans into an
annual distribution to dissect temperature from possibly pri-
mary photoperiod effects (30). The number of BAT-positive
scans followed a seasonal/photoperiodic profile, with a lower in-
cidence during the summer months (Fig. 4C). This pattern was
absent in the control group. To statistically distinguish influences
of temperature from those of photoperiod, we tested for differ-
ences in daily minimal temperature within the summer months June,
July, and August and within the rest of the year, respectively. In both
timespans, minimal daily temperature remained different between
case and control group (summer, P 5 0.040; rest of the year, P 5
0.001; data not shown) and is thus a predictor of BAT activation
independent of photoperiodic effects.
Taken together, we corroborated outdoor temperature as a
strong predictor of BAT activation independent of photoperiod.
Contrary to multiple earlier reports (4,5,14,23,29,31,32), we did
not detect a primary effect of BMI on the probability of BAT
activation in this case-control study.
Depot-Resolved Analysis Reveals Effects of Renal
Creatinine Clearance on Brown Fat Activity
We determined volume and SUVmean for every BAT depot lo-
cation as defined above and calculated a depot-specific brown fat
activity index by multiplying volume by intensity (Table 2). By
BFI, individual depots contributed to total BAT activity in the
following ascending order: subphrenic, paravertebral, mediastinal,
cervical, and most prominently supraclavicular BAT. Use of the
BFI allowed the search for correlating anthropometric and clinical
parameters on the total as well on the depot level.
Total BFI varied across a large range of more than 3 orders of
magnitude (3 to 3,990). We observed no sex difference in mean
BFI, neither on the total, nor on the depot level (Supplemental Fig.
3). The same was true for body mass; height; outdoor temperature;
the plasma parameters glucose, creatinine, or thyroid-stimulating
hormone; and the procedural parameters waiting time between tracer
injection and scan or injected activity (not shown). The BMI of
patients did not predict BFI on the total level nor in any individual
depot (Supplemental Fig. 4). Age was significantly correlated to total
and supraclavicular BFI, but not in smaller depots (Supplemental
Fig. 5). We calculated an estimate for renal creatinine clearance from
plasma creatinine, body mass, and age of patients (33). Surprisingly,
clearance proved the strongest predictor of BFI identified in our
study (r 5 0.344, P 5 0.007, Fig. 5), although neither body mass
nor creatinine alone displayed any correlation with BFI (not shown).
All individual BAT depots contributed to this effect in a seemingly
similar fashion, although correlation reached statistical significance
in supraclavicular and mediastinal depots only. Hence, of patients
activating BAT during a clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, patients

DISCUSSION
BAT is a mammalian organ providing a means of nonshivering
thermogenesis to defend body temperature in a cold environment.
A high glucose uptake of active BAT allows its detection in human
patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging and may at the
same time interfere with diagnostic tumor detection (6,9,10,12).
In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 2,854 archived 18F-
FDG PET/CT scans and identified 98 BAT-positive scans. We
proposed a visual score system to rapidly classify the extent of
active BAT detected in a given scan by comparison with other
tissues, that is, the liver and brain. The 4 categories provide a fast
and easy classification for the description of BAT in 18F-FDG
PET/CT imaging, thus enabling a homogeneous description of
BAT in clinical situations. Visual scoring is a quick, quantitative
measure of BAT activity that can be assessed with minimal train-
ing and technologic investment.
In scans of visual score 4, we observed a distinctly higher BAT
mass than the approximately 0.1% of body mass previously described
(mean volume, 308.1 mL) (3). Even if we mimicked the procedure of
earlier examinations and calculated the mean of all positive patients
(thereby including most scans containing invisible, inactive BAT),
we still obtained a higher volume of BAT than reported previously
(3,4,22). Our data thus imply a higher mean BAT mass in humans
than previously described, with considerable consequences on the
possibility to target human BAT in patients with metabolic disease
as proposed previously.
Earlier estimates calculated a body mass loss by fully activating
70 g of human BAT to be in the range of 4 kg fat per year (3). On
the basis of the more than 4-fold-higher BAT mass detected in this
study, this estimate may rather be a striking 18 kg. Approved obesity

 medication typically leads to an additional weight loss of 2.9 to max-
imally 8.6 kg per year (34). Thus, a body mass loss provoked by
continuous BAT activation would exceed this effect size severalfold.
Similarly, 70 g of active BAT are expected to remove about 2 g
of glucose per day from the bloodstream (assumptions, 50 mg of
BAT and 10% glucose utilization). This may be compared with
other new pharmacologic interventions to reduce hyperglycemia
such as SGLT2 inhibitors that typically achieve 50–80 g of glu-
cose clearance per day (35). A BAT volume of 308 mL as mea-
sured in this study already disposes of 9 g of glucose per day, and
the assumed power of 50 mW/g BAT may still prove a too con-
servative estimate. In summary, the larger than expected amount
of detected BAT highlights the role of this thermogenic tissue as a
plausible target structure to treat metabolic disease.
Only active BAT can be visualized by its glucose uptake. When
this phenomenon was corrected for based on the probability to
detect active BAT in repeated scans, the actual prevalence of BAT
was estimated to be much higher (64%) (14). Challenged by cold
exposure, nearly all young subjects display active BAT (5,29). In
our study, subjects with detectable BAT thus represent a subgroup
of patients with a higher than usual probability to activate BAT
during a clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Indeed, we quantified
this increased probability to be 10 times higher than in the overall
patient cohort (5% vs. 52%). We can only speculate on the nature
of the underlying, causative mechanism. An obvious candidate
seems to be an increased sympathetic tone or at least a tendency
to increase sympathetic tone to a greater extent than usual in re-
sponse to a stress situation.
We introduced a case-control design to remove the differences of
age and sex between BAT-positive and -negative patients. Surpris-
ingly, we did not observe any effects of BMI on the stratified data,
although BMI has repeatedly been described to be negatively
associated with BAT detection both in retrospective and in pro-
spective studies (4,5,14,23,29,31,32). Our finding suggests the effect
of BMI on BAT incidence to be secondary to age and sex, at least
in our dataset. The same seems to be true for most of the other
parameters we studied, including several that have been reported
to be associated with BAT activity previously, for example,
thyroid-stimulating hormone (36–39) and glucose (40,41). We
also did not detect an obvious effect of disease. Conversely, we
corroborated earlier observations of seasonal variations in BAT
detection in 18F-FDG PET/CT scans (22,30). This pattern has been
suggested to be connected rather to annual changes in day length
and therefore daylight exposure than to temperature (30). In our
data, a clear effect of daily minimum temperature persists even
at comparable day length during the summer season, suggesting a
direct, thermogenic response.
Beyond the probability to activate BAT, we studied factors that
influence the amount of BAT activated in positive scans. We
assessed overall BAT metabolic activity by calculation of a brown
fat activity index from the SUVmean of all detected BAT multiplied
by its volume. Surprisingly, this quantitative BFI did not correlate
with established predictors of BAT detection and activity, that is,
BMI and sex (4,5,23,31,32). In none of the studied 5 depots nor on
the total organismic level did these parameters influence BFI. In
contrast, BAT activity was inversely correlated with patient age,
similar to previous reports (14,23).
The strongest correlation with BFI displayed renal creatinine
clearance derived from plasma creatinine, body mass, and age of
the patients by means of an estimation formula (33). The complete
lack of correlation between BFI and body mass or creatinine alone
argues against a mathematic artifact. Creatinine is a breakdown prod-
uct of creatine phosphate, a short-term energy buffer usually associ-
ated with muscle adenosine triphosphate regeneration. Interestingly, a
creatine-driven substrate cycle has been reported to enhance energy
expenditure in rodent beige/brite adipocytes (42). Human brown
adipocytes are more similar to these brownlike adipocytes found
in white fat than to classic rodent brown fat (43). Indeed, the exis-
tence of a creatine-driven substrate cycle in human BAT is corrob-
orated by a proteomic analysis demonstrating exclusive expression
of mitochondrial creatine kinases in BAT as compared with white
fat (44). Conceivably, an increased creatine phosphate turnover in
active BAT can be detected in the form of increased renal creatinine
clearance, a phenomenon also reported to follow muscular exercise
(45–47). If verified, this finding may provide a novel, noninvasive
means to monitor human brown fat thermogenic activity.
Alternatively or additionally, a common cause may have in-
creased activity of both organs, BAT and kidney. A high sympa-
thetic tone, however, rather lowers glomerular filtration rate and
renal blood flow and is thus not a plausible, connecting mechanism
(48). Endocrine agents that influence both BAT and kidney activity
are therefore more fitting candidates. This condition applies to atrial
natriuretic peptide as well as glucocorticoids that induce the activity
of human brown adipocytes (49,50). Future studies will have to
clarify whether plasma atrial natriuretic peptide or glucocorticoids
constitute robust, causative predictors of human BAT activity.
We hypothesized both major parameters studied here—probability
to activate brown fat during a clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and
brown fat activity as measured by depot-resolved BFI—to be sub-
ject to the same causative, physiologic mechanism, for example,
sympathetic tone atrial natriuretic peptide or glucocorticoid levels.
In that case, the probability of BAT redetection in a patient would
be governed by the same underlying cause as the amount of BAT
activated and renal creatinine clearance, as outlined above. We
identified 19 patients with an overlap in all 3 relevant datasets
(i.e., redetection probability from 3 or more repeated scans, total
BFI, renal creatinine clearance). Strikingly, redetection probability
highly correlated with both total BFI (r 5 0.48, P 5 0.038, Spear-
man correlation) and renal creatinine clearance (r 5 0.51, P 5
0.026), clearly supporting a common cause (not shown).
CONCLUSION
Taken together, we determined measures of BAT activity in
archived 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. For clinical application, we rec-
ommend a categoric visual score 1–4 while a precise quantitative
assessment is possible by the proposed BFI method. Scans with
score 4 displayed activity in all 5 BAT depots that together form a
mean volume of more than 300 mL and thus exceeded the amount
reported in earlier studies, with significant consequences on the
feasibility to target BAT activity for the treatment of metabolic
diseases. We corroborated earlier findings of a high association of
age, sex, and season/temperature on the probability to detect ac-
tive BAT. Subjects with active BAT form a subgroup of patients
with an increased probability of BAT redetection during clinical
18F-FDG PET/CT scans. The amount of active BAT measured as
depot-resolved BFI was influenced by age (dominated by supra-
clavicular BAT) and correlated with renal creatinine clearance. We
hypothesized the latter to be a consequence of a creatine-driven
substrate cycle in active human BAT or subject to regulation by
atrial natriuretic peptide, a possible common cause of both detection
probability and BATactivity. Importantly, this concept implies that a

 definable subgroup of the general population will benefit from drug
treatment targeting BAT to a much greater extent than the average.
This may represent both a complication for future clinical trials of
said drugs and at the same time a great chance for a personalized
medicine approach in the treatment of metabolic disease.
