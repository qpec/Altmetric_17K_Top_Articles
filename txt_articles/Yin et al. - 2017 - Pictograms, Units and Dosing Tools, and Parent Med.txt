BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Poorly designed labels and dosing tools contribute to dosing errors. 
We examined the degree to which errors could be reduced with pictographic diagrams, 
milliliter-only units, and provision of tools more closely matched to prescribed volumes.
METHODS: This study involved a randomized controlled experiment in 3 pediatric clinics. 
English- and Spanish-speaking parents (n = 491) of children ≤8 years old were randomly 
assigned to 1 of 4 groups and given labels and dosing tools that varied in label instruction 
format (text and pictogram, or text only) and units (milliliter-only ["mL"] or milliliter/
teaspoon ["mL/tsp"]). Each parent measured 9 doses of liquid medication (3 amounts [2, 
7.5, and 10 mL] and 3 tools [1 cup, 2 syringes (5- and 10-mL capacities)]) in random order. 
The primary outcome was dosing error (>20% deviation), and large error (>2× dose).
RESULTS: We found that 83.5% of parents made ≥1 dosing error (overdosing was present in 
12.1% of errors) and 29.3% of parents made ≥1 large error (>2× dose). The greatest impact 
on errors resulted from the provision of tools more closely matched to prescribed dose 
volumes. For the 2-mL dose, the fewest errors were seen with the 5-mL syringe  
(5- vs 10-mL syringe: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.3 [95% confidence interval: 0.2–0.4]; 
cup versus 10-mL syringe: aOR = 7.5 [5.7–10.0]). For the 7.5-mL dose, the fewest errors were 
with the 10-mL syringe, which did not necessitate measurement of multiple instrument-
fulls (5- vs 10-mL syringe: aOR = 4.0 [3.0–5.4]; cup versus 10-mL syringe: aOR = 2.1 
[1.5–2.9]). Milliliter/teaspoon was associated with more errors than milliliter-only (aOR = 
1.3 [1.05–1.6]). Parents who received text only (versus text and pictogram) instructions or 
milliliter/teaspoon (versus milliliter-only) labels and tools made more large errors (aOR = 
1.9 [1.1–3.3], aOR = 2.5 [1.4–4.6], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Provision of dosing tools more closely matched to prescribed dose volumes is an 
especially promising strategy for reducing pediatric dosing errors.

WhaT’s KnoWn on This subjecT: Poorly designed labels 
and dosing tools contribute to dosing errors. Initial findings 
from the Safe Administration For Every Rx for Kids study 
identified high rates of error with cups compared with 
syringes, especially for small dose amounts, and greater 
confusion when labels included teaspoon-only instructions.
WhaT This sTudy adds: Dosing tools should be provided 
that more closely match prescribed dose volumes, such 
that there is little room to overdose and no need to measure 
multiple instrument-fulls. Pictographic instructions and 
milliliter-only labels and tools can also reduce errors.

Suboptimal drug labeling and 
medication packaging have been 
identified as key contributors to 
outpatient medication errors.1 
– 
3 
Over the past decade, most efforts to 
address this problem have focused 
on improving labeling for adult 
medications, 
4, 
5 despite high rates of 
pediatric dosing errors.6, 
 
7 The Safe 
Administration For Every Rx for Kids 
(SAFE Rx for Kids) study was initiated 
to fill gaps in knowledge regarding 
how to improve the labeling and 
packaging of pediatric medications. 
Findings from the first experiment 
supported the use of oral syringes 
over dosing cups (especially for 
smaller doses), supported avoidance 
of teaspoon terms as a strategy to 
reduce use of kitchen spoons, and 
suggested that error rates might 
be reduced when matched units on 
labels and dosing tools are used  
(ie, milliliter-only ["mL"] or milliliter/
teaspoon["mL/tsp"] on both).8, 
 
9 
Notably, error rates were significant 
even with syringes and matched 
labels and tools. This article presents 
findings from the second SAFE Rx for 
Kids experiment, which looks at the 
implications of additional strategies 
to reduce errors (specifically the 
role of pictograms and dosing-tool 
size) while continuing to examine 
implications of milliliter-only versus 
milliliter/teaspoon for additional 
dose amounts. No previous study has 
looked at these issues across a range 
of doses and with an experimental 
approach.
Pictograms represent a promising 
strategy for improving parental 
understanding of dosing instructions. 
Use of pictorial-enhanced written 
materials has been linked with 
improved comprehension 
and adherence with medical 
instructions, 
10 
– 
12 especially for those 
with low literacy.13 
– 
17 To date, no 
studies have examined the role of 
pictographic dosing diagrams on 
liquid medication prescription labels.
Many believe that moving to 
milliliter-only labels and tools would 
simplify the task of dosing liquid 
medications and reduce errors 
by parents as well as health care 
providers and pharmacists.18 
–22 
A 2015 policy statement from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommended moving to a milliliter-
exclusive system.18 Few studies have 
examined whether consistency in 
units is an equally effective strategy 
for error reduction compared 
with a milliliter-only approach; 
experiment 1 of the SAFE Rx study 
found no difference in error rates 
with matched labels and tools that 
were milliliter only compared with 
those containing both milliliter and 
teaspoon.8
Matching dosing-tool capacity to dose 
volume may further reduce errors.23 
Providing too large of a tool means 
there is more space within the tool 
to give too much medication.24, 
 
25 
Provision of a tool that is too small 
leads to the need to measure more 
than 1 instrument-full of medication. 
There has been limited previous 
study of this issue.13, 
26
To fill gaps in knowledge regarding 
best practices for the labeling 
and dosing of pediatric liquid 
medications, we examined the 
extent to which error rates could be 
reduced by: (1) inclusion of text only 
versus text and pictogram dosing 
instructions; (2) milliliter-only versus 
milliliter/teaspoon unit-concordant 
labels and tools; and (3) better 
matching of dosing-tool capacity to 
dose volume. We also investigated 
differences in impact of parental 
health literacy and language because 
low health literacy and limited 
English proficiency are factors known 
to place parents at a greater risk for 
errors.24,

Participants, Recruitment, and 
Randomization
This was a randomized controlled 
study to examine ways to improve 
medication labels and dosing tools 
and reduce parental errors in dosing 
liquid medicines (SAFE Rx for Kids 
study). Recruitment took place 
in pediatric outpatient clinics at 
NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue 
(New York, NY), Gardner Packard 
Children’s Health Center (Atherton, 
CA), and Children’s Healthcare 
of Atlanta at Hughes Spalding 
Children’s Hospital (Atlanta, GA). 
Each site’s institutional review board 
approved the study.
Research assistants (RAs) 
determined parent and/or caregiver 
eligibility during regular clinic hours. 
Eligibility was met if the parent or 
legal guardian was ≥18 years old 
with a child ≤8 years old presenting 
for care, was English- or Spanish-
speaking, and was the one who 
usually administers medications. 
Subjects were excluded if their 
visual acuity was worse than 20/50 
(Rosenbaum screener), they were 
hearing impaired, their children 
were presenting for emergency care, 
or there was previous participation 
in a medication-related study. RAs 
obtained written, informed consent.
After enrollment, subjects were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 4 
groups. Groups differed by type of 
instruction on the medication label 
and measurement units on the label 
and dosing tool: text and pictogram 
instructions on the label, "mL"-only 
label and tool (Group 1); text and 
pictogram instructions, "mL/tsp" 
label and tool (Group 2); text-only 
instructions, "mL"-only label and tool 
(Group 3); and text-only instructions, 
"mL/tsp" label and tool (Group 4) 
(Fig 1). Teaspoon-only labels and 
tools were not tested. Most dosing 
tools include milliliter units. A move 
to teaspoon only would also not be 
feasible because many prescribed 
doses are not teaspoon equivalents.  
A random-number generator, blocked 
by site, was used to randomly assign 
subjects; this was performed in sets 
of 100 with 25 subjects allocated per 
group. The lead project coordinator

developed the allocation sequence. 
RAs remained blinded to assigned 
groups until after subject enrollment 
was finished. Once RAs began to 
administer dosing assessments, 
group assignments were evident 
from the labels and tools provided.
assessments
RAs performed assessments in 
English and Spanish depending 
on parents’ preferences. After 
the dosing assessments, RAs 
administered a survey to assess 
parents’ sociodemographics and 
health literacy. A $20 gift card was 
provided after completion of the 
assessments.
dosing accuracy
Study subjects were shown their 
assigned bottle labels and tools and 
were asked to respond to questions 
and demonstrate dosing. Each 
subject participated in 9 total trials; 
they were asked to measure 3 dose 
amounts (2, 7.5, and 10 mL) using 
3 tools (5- and 10-mL–capacity 
oral syringes and dosing cups with 
15 mL as the largest marking). To 
address potential learning effects, 
the order in which caregivers were 
given each tool and dose amount 
was randomized by using a random-
number generator. Bottle labels 
were displayed in English or Spanish 
on the basis of the caregivers’ 
preferences. Tools were custom 
designed (Comar, Buena, NJ) to 
ensure that the only difference for 
each tool type across groups was the 
markings.
Caregivers were given as much time 
as they needed for the assessments. 
They were told the following: 
“Please use this [dosing tool handed 
to parent] to show me how much 
medicine the label tells you to give 
the child each time you give the 
medicine.” Caregivers dispensed the 
medication from standard bottles 
filled to the same level for each trial. 
A commonly administered pediatric 
medication (liquid suspension) was 
used for dosing assessments.
Dosing error was the primary 
outcome. To assess the magnitude 
of error, the weight of the measured 
dose (tool weight containing parent’s 
measured dose minus preassessment 
tool weight) was compared with 
a reference weight (eg, 5-mL dose 
defined as the average weight of 5 mL 
measured by 10 pediatricians using 
an oral syringe). A pharmacy-grade 
electronic prescription class II scale 
(Torbal DRX-4; Fulcrum Inc, Clifton, NJ) 
was used.
If the measured amount deviated 
from the amount listed on the label 
by >20%, the parent was considered 
to have made a clinically meaningful 
dosing error; this is an accepted 
threshold that has been used in 
previous studies.24, 
 
31 
– 
33 We also 
assessed errors of greater magnitude; 
a large dosing error was defined as 
measuring an amount more than 2 
times the labeled dose.8
sociodemographic data, health 
Literacy, and child health status
Sociodemographics assessed 
included each child’s age and sex 
and each parent’s age, relationship 
to the child, income, country of 
birth, race/ethnicity, language, and 
education. Parental health literacy 
was measured by using the Newest 
Vital Sign (NVS), which is validated in 
English and Spanish and tests prose, 
document, and quantitative literacy 
skills by using a nutrition label. 
Parents were categorized as having 
low (score 0–1), marginal (2–3), or 
adequate (4–6) health literacy.34 
Each child’s chronic disease status 
and associated medication use were 
assessed by using questions from the 
Children with Special Health Care 
Needs Screener.35
statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were  
performed by using SAS software 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC). χ2 and Fisher’s exact 
tests were conducted to compare 
parent characteristics among 
groups for categorical variables, 
and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used 
for continuous measurements. 
Similar analyses were performed to 
compare parents who did and did 
not enroll in the study.

Analyses were performed to 
compare error rates (>20% 
deviation, >2× dose) on the basis of 
(a) group and (b) tool type (model 1).  
Findings were analyzed by assigned 
group (all parents received 
assigned label and tool pairings). 
Analyses were also conducted by 
group characteristics: (a) dosing 
instruction type (text and pictogram 
versus text only) and (b) units used 
on labels and tools (milliliter only 
versus milliliter/teaspoon) (model 2).  
Multiple logistic regression was 
performed using generalized 
estimating equations to account 
for repeated measures (9 trials per 
subject). In addition to group and 
tool type, covariates selected a priori 
for inclusion in adjusted analyses 
were key study variables of dose 
amount, dosing order, health literacy, 
and label language. Stratified 
analyses and interaction tests were 
performed by using dose volume  
(ie, 2, 7.5, and 10 mL), health literacy, 
and language.
Based on previous studies, including 
our previous experiment on dosing 
errors, 
8, 
 
13, 
 
28, 
 
31 we conservatively 
estimated a sample size of 120 
patients per group or 480 total 
subjects. This sample size would 
allow us to detect an absolute 
difference of ∼15% with 80% 
power for our hypotheses related to 
pictographic dosing instructions as 
well as comparison of single versus 
multiple instrument-fulls.
ResuLTs
Between February 20, 2015 and July 
23, 2015, 493 parents enrolled and 
were randomly assigned (Fig 2). 
Characteristics did not differ between 
enrolled and nonenrolled subjects. 
Dosing assessments were completed 
for the 491 parents included in this 
analysis (Table 1).
dosing accuracy
Overall, 410 (83.5%) parents made 
at least 1 dosing error (in 9 trials); 
on average, parents made errors 
in 23.2% of trials. Overdosing was 
present in 12.1% of errors. There 
were more errors with the 2- and  
7.5-mL doses tested compared with 
the 10-mL dose (2 mL vs 10 mL:  
aOR = 3.7 [3.1–4.4]; 7.5 mL vs 10 mL: 
aOR = 1.4 [1.2–1.6]). One hundred 
and forty-four (29.3%) parents made 
at least 1 large error (>2× dose); on 
average, parents made large errors in 
4.5% of trials.
dosing instructions
Parents who received text and 
pictogram dosing instructions 
with "mL"-only labels and tools 
(Group 1) (a) had decreased odds 
of making a dosing error compared 
with parents who received  
"mL/tsp" labels and tools with 
or without pictographic dosing 
instructions (Groups 2 and 4) and 
(b) had lower odds of making a 
large dosing error compared with 
Group 4 (Table 2). No interactions 
among study groups and either 
health literacy or language were 
found to be significant.
In analyses based on group 
characteristics, parents who 
received dosing instructions that 
were text only (versus text and 
pictogram) made more large 
errors (aOR = 1.9 [1.1–3.3]); no 
statistically significant difference 
was seen for any error (P = .09). 
Parents who received units on 
labels and tools that were "mL/tsp" 
(versus "mL" only) also made more 
large errors (aOR = 2.5 [1.4–4.6]);

more errors were also seen for any 
error (aOR = 1.3 [1.05–1.6]).
dosing Tool
Error rates varied for tools depending 
on the volume of the dose tested, with 
the fewest errors present when the 
dosing-tool capacity more closely 
matched the dose volume (Table 3). 
For the 2-mL dose, the most errors 
were seen with the cup and 10-mL 
syringe (5- vs 10-mL syringe: aOR 
= 0.3 [0.2–0.4]; cup versus 10-mL 
syringe: aOR = 7.5 [5.7–10.0]). For the 
7.5-mL doses, the most errors were 
seen with the 5-mL syringe (5- vs 
10-mL syringe: aOR = 4.0 [3.0–5.4]; 
cup versus 10-mL syringe: aOR = 2.1 
[1.5–2.9]). Similar findings were seen 
for the 10-mL dose.
Impact of the dose volume to tool 
capacity relationship was greatest 
for those with low and marginal 
health literacy, particularly when 
there was a need for measurement

discussion
This study is unique in that it sought 
to identify a range of strategies to 
improve pediatric liquid medication 
labels and associated dosing tools 
by examining the role of dosing 
pictograms, matched units on labels 
and tools, and provision of dosing 
tools based on prescribed dose 
volumes. Overall, we found a high 
rate of dosing errors, with >80% of 
parents making at least 1 error  
(± >20% deviation) in 9 dosing 
trials. The greatest reduction in 
errors was seen when the dosing tool 
provided more closely matched the 
prescribed dose volume, such that 
there was little room to overdose 
and no need to measure multiple 
instrument-fulls for a single dose. 
Smaller impacts on errors were seen 
with pictograms and with a change 
in units from "mL/tsp" to "mL" only. 
Although fewer large dosing errors 
were seen (representing ∼5% of all 
trials), nearly 30% of the parents in 
our study made at least 1 large error 
(>2× deviation). Our findings suggest 
that inclusion of pictographic dosing 
diagrams and "mL"-only units on 
labels and tools may be especially 
effective strategies to reduce large 
errors.
The high rate of dosing errors 
we found is consistent with 
previous studies involving pediatric 
medications.28, 
 
36 Confusion about how 
to properly choose and use dosing 
tools as well as confusion related 
to units of measure contribute to 
errors.37 Similar to previous studies, 
we found that underdosing accounted 
for the majority of errors, 
13, 
31 although 
∼1 in 8 errors involved overdosing. 
Whereas overdosing is concerning 
with respect to toxicity, underdosing 
can contribute to poor clinical 
outcomes because of treatment 
failure.

It is well established that the use 
of standardized tools is important 
for optimal dosing accuracy and 
that use of nonstandard kitchen 
spoons is associated with errors; the 
US Food and Drug Administration 
recommends inclusion of 
standardized tools with all liquid 
over-the-counter products.3 
Consistent with previous findings, 
including those from a previous 
SAFE Rx for Kids experiment, more 
errors were associated with cups 
than with syringes.8, 
 
9, 
 
24, 
38 We found 
in this study, however, that the 
optimal dosing tool varied based 
on the dose volume tested and 
the capacity of the tool. When we 
tested a small 2-mL dose, cups were 
associated with the greatest number 
of errors, compared with both 5- and 
10-mL syringes, with most errors 
involving overdosing. For the 2-mL 
dose, having a larger syringe than 
necessary was also associated with 
more overdosing. Notably, when we 
tested larger doses (ie, 7.5 mL and  
10 mL), cups were superior to the 
5-mL syringes, which required 
parents to measure more than 1 
instrument-full; parents typically 
underdosed when given a tool that 
was too small to fit a single dose. 
Overall, the fewest errors were 
seen when the desired measured 
volume was closest to the dosing tool 
capacity without exceeding it.
Our findings support the use of a 
specific algorithm to help health care 
providers and pharmacists determine 
which dosing tool is most optimal 
to provide to parents. The current 
lack of specific guidance regarding 
dosing tools could be one reason why 
tool provision practices are often 
suboptimal. A previous study found 
in one pharmacy setting that almost 
one-third of tools given to families 
with pediatric prescription liquid 
medications required measurement 
of multiple instrument-fulls.26
Our study is unique in that it is 
the first to explore the use of 
pictographic dosing diagrams on

pediatric medication labels. We found 
that pictograms were associated with 
statistically significant reductions in 
large overdosing errors, with a trend 
for reduction in any error.
Interestingly, although we were not 
initially powered to look at under- 
and overdosing separately, secondary 
analyses which used >20% deviation 
above the dose as a cutpoint for any 
overdosing error and >20% deviation 
below the dose as a cutpoint for any 
underdosing error yielded similar 
findings to analyses involving large 
overdosing errors, which suggests 
that pictograms may be helpful for 
preventing both underdosing and 
overdosing errors. The benefit of 
pictograms, especially for preventing 
large errors, indicates that this is an 
important strategy to consider for 
reducing multifold errors. Pictograms 
visually highlight what should be 
dosed in an obvious way and can 
provide a dramatic contrast when 
the pictorially represented dose and 
what the parent measures are vastly 
different.
In this study, we found that parents 
who received labels and tools with 
only "mL" units were less likely to 
make errors compared with those 
who received labels and tools with 
"mL/tsp"; however, reductions in 
overall errors were small, with a 
similar number of underdosing and 
overdosing errors. Error reductions 
were greater for large overdosing 
errors. This is unsurprising because 
confusion between milliliter and 
teaspoon units, or misunderstanding 
of teaspoon ("tsp") as tablespoon 
("tbsp"), contributes to multifold 
errors. Interestingly, in an earlier 
study by our team, we found error 
rates to be comparable for parents 
who received labels and tools with 
"mL" only versus "mL/tsp" units.8
Parents who were categorized as 
having low health literacy were at 
greatest risk for errors, which is 
consistent with previous studies.39 
Notably, parents with the lowest 
levels of health literacy were most 
impacted by closer matching of 
dosing-tool capacity to prescribed 
dose volumes. Interestingly, the 
impact of pictograms and units on 
risk of dosing errors did not vary 
by health literacy; this suggests that 
these strategies could be used as part 
of a universal precautions approach 
to prevent medication errors.
Surprisingly, there was no impact 
of language on the overall risk 
of making errors. Furthermore, 
language had no interaction with 
tool type for errors. The potential 
for language disparities within 
our study was likely minimized 
because assessments and labels 
were provided in Spanish. Spanish-
speaking parents may have also 
had previous exposure to metric 
measurements in their native 
countries, resulting in a decreased 
risk of error.
The current study has limitations 
that are common for this type of 
controlled experiment. We employed 
a hypothetical dosing scheme, which 
might not reflect how parents dose 
medications at home. We tested 
a limited number of dosing tools 
and capacities and dose volumes. 
We used 1 label format and 1 type 
of pictogram. Because this study 
sought to examine the impact of 
multiple potential strategies to 
reduce errors, and because there 
were fewer large dosing errors in our 
study, it was difficult to obtain stable 
model estimates for subanalyses, 
including analyses by dose amount. 
Additional studies that specifically 
focus on strategies to prevent large 
errors would be helpful. Because 
we only enrolled patients from 3 
urban, university-affiliated pediatric 
clinic sites, findings may not be 
generalizable.
concLusions
Our study findings demonstrate 
that matching dosing tools more 
closely with prescribed dose 
volumes is an important strategy 
for reducing pediatric medication 
errors. Inclusion of pictographic 
dosing diagrams and milliliter-only 
units on labels and tools may be 
especially helpful in preventing large 
dosing errors. Findings are being 
used to inform the development 
of a comprehensive labeling and 
dosing strategy for pediatric liquid 
medications, which will be tested in a 
real-world randomized trial. Notably, 
even with the optimization of labels 
and tools, a significant proportion 
of parents with low health literacy 
still made errors. Thus, to ensure 
that literacy-related disparities are 
not exacerbated, implementation 
of our comprehensive labeling and 
dosing strategy will likely need 
to be combined with additional 
public health approaches, including
