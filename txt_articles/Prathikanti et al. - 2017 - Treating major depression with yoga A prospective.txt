Abstract
Background
Conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for major depression are associated
with limited adherence to care and relatively low remission rates. Yoga may offer an alterna-
tive treatment option, but rigorous studies are few. This randomized controlled trial with
blinded outcome assessors examined an 8-week hatha yoga intervention as mono-therapy
for mild-to-moderate major depression.
Methods
Investigators recruited 38 adults in San Francisco meeting criteria for major depression of
mild-to-moderate severity, per structured psychiatric interview and scores of 14–28 on Beck
Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy, antide-
pressant pharmacotherapy, herbal or nutraceutical mood therapies, or mind-body practices
were excluded. Participants were 68% female, with mean age 43.4 years (SD = 14.8,
range = 22–72), and mean BDI score 22.4 (SD = 4.5). Twenty participants were randomized
to 90-minute hatha yoga practice groups twice weekly for 8 weeks. Eighteen participants
were randomized to 90-minute attention control education groups twice weekly for 8 weeks.
Certified yoga instructors delivered both interventions at a university clinic. Primary outcome
was depression severity, measured by BDI scores every 2 weeks from baseline to 8 weeks.
Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured by scores on the Gen-
eral Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at baseline and
at 8 weeks.
Results
In intent-to-treat analysis, yoga participants exhibited significantly greater 8-week decline in
BDI scores than controls (p-value = 0.034). In sub-analyses of participants completing final

 8-week measures, yoga participants were more likely to achieve remission, defined per final
BDI score � 9 (p-value = 0.018). Effect size of yoga in reducing BDI scores was large, per
Cohen’s d = -0.96 [95%CI, -1.81 to -0.12]. Intervention groups did not differ significantly in 8-
week change scores for either the GSES or RSES.
Conclusion
In adults with mild-to-moderate major depression, an 8-week hatha yoga intervention
resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression severity.

Introduction
Major depression and its impact
Annually, nearly 7% of adults in the Unites States suffer from an episode of major depression
[1]. The World Health Organization identifies major depression as the second most disabling
medical condition in the United States, accounting for more years lived with disability than
heart disease, stroke, or diabetes [2]. Major depression contributes not only to disability, but
also to mortality. There are more than 49,000 deaths by suicide annually in the United States
[3], and it is estimated that major depression accounts for 20–35% of these deaths [4]. Major
depression also increases the risk of death from other medical conditions such as coronary
artery disease [5–8] and diabetes mellitus [9–11].
According to current diagnostic criteria [12], major depression is characterized by five or
more of the following symptoms being present concurrently for at least two weeks: 1)
depressed mood, 2) loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities, 3) feelings of inappro-
priate guilt or worthlessness, 4) recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, 5) psychomotor slow-
ing or agitation, 6) disturbance of appetite, 7) disturbance of sleep, 8) disturbance of energy,
and 9) impaired concentration. One of the five symptoms must include depressed mood or
diminished interest in previously pleasurable activities. A diagnosis of major depression may
be further categorized as mild, moderate or severe, based on the level of functional
impairment. In severe major depression, suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms such as hal-
lucinations and delusions may be present. Diagnostic criteria for major depression require it
to be distinguished from normal bereavement, as well as from other depressive disorders that
may present with low mood, such as dysthymia, cyclothymia, bipolar disorder, premenstrual
dysphoria, or affective symptoms that are the manifestation of co-morbid physical illness or
substance misuse. Left untreated, an episode of major depression typically lasts about 6 to 12
months, but 20% of episodes may last 2 years or longer [13]. Even after treatment and recov-
ery, more than half of individuals who suffer one episode of major depression have a recurrent
episode within a few years. The lengthy duration of each episode, and the tendency for epi-
sodes to recur, both contribute to the high level of disability associated with major depression.
In this paper, the term “depression” may refer to low mood of any etiology, but “major depres-
sion” will refer only to the specific mood illness meeting diagnostic criteria outlined above.

 Conventional care for major depression
Conventional care for major depression most commonly includes antidepressant medication
and/or a variety of psychological interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, interper-
sonal therapy, or supportive group therapy. However, only half of Americans annually diag-
nosed with major depression obtain any conventional care, and only one-fifth complete the
level of care that is likely to treat their major depressive episode [14]. Once initiated, both phar-
macological and psychological therapies have dropout rates ranging from 20%-47%, with the
higher rates reported in naturalistic studies that reflect “real world” treatment conditions [15–
25]. Dropout from conventional care is influenced by several factors [16–24,26], including cost
of office visits, duration of treatment, stigma regarding mental illness, insufficient therapeutic
alliance with the clinician—and in the case of medications, intolerance to side effects.
Even when guideline-congruent treatment is completed, published studies indicate both
pharmacological and psychological interventions for major depression are associated with rel-
atively low remission rates of 28% to 46% following one course of therapy [27–30]. It has been
suggested that even these remission rates may over-estimate the efficacy of conventional care
in major depression, because of bias toward publishing positive studies [31–36]. Among indi-
viduals with poor response to one trial of pharmacotherapy, additional trials of medication
and/or psychotherapy appear to increase the likelihood of remission [37–40], so that after 3 to
4 successive therapeutic trials, two-thirds of patients with major depression may ultimately
achieve remission [41,42]. However, multiple treatment courses require considerable time,
expense, perseverance and tolerance of potential side effects, and are unlikely to be pursued by
many individuals with major depression. In sum, conventional therapies for major depression
can be effective—and even lifesaving—for those who seek out care, tolerate full treatment
courses without dropout, and have responsive symptoms, but many other individuals endure
chronic functional impairment due to major depression that remains untreated, or does not
remit with conventional care [14,43,44]. Thus, it is essential to develop novel and efficacious
interventions for major depression that are safe, affordable, well accepted, and easily accessed.
The yoga tradition
Yoga originated more than 5000 years ago in India as a comprehensive life discipline to har-
monize body, mind, and spirit and to transcend suffering by developing an abiding awareness
of one’s spiritual nature [45]. Circa 200 BCE, the Hindu sage Patanjali consolidated ancient
yogic philosophy and practices into a classical Sanskrit treatise called the Yoga Sutras [45,46],
describing eight components of yoga: ethical behavior, self-discipline, body postures, breath
regulation, sensory withdrawal, and three progressively deeper meditative practices meant to
cultivate union with one’s spiritual essence. The Yoga Sutras inform the many schools of yoga
present today, although each school may emphasize different components of the classical tra-
dition. Hatha yoga [47] is the most prevalent school of yoga in western countries and empha-
sizes physical components—such as body postures, breathing and relaxation techniques, and
dietary practices. Most yoga classes available in North America are adaptations of hatha yoga,
including Iyengar, Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Integral, Sivananda, and Bikram yoga.
Yoga for depressive symptoms
In the United States, the practice of yoga is increasing markedly, with nearly 10% of the popu-
lation in 2012 reporting some participation in yoga within the previous year [48]. Yoga exer-
cises are associated with a relatively favorable risk/benefit profile [49–51], and are easily
adapted for a wide range of practitioners—including frail seniors and individuals with medical
problems for whom other physical activity may be difficult. The American public uses yoga

 not only to maintain wellness, and but also to treat specific health conditions [52–57]. Depres-
sion consistently ranks among the most common health conditions self-treated with yoga
[52,53,58–60]. Notably, other mind-body therapies frequently used by the public to self-treat
depression include breathing exercises, meditation, and relaxation techniques [58–60], all
comprising key elements of yoga practice. The appeal of yoga as a treatment for depression
may be related to its relatively low cost, ease of access, high social acceptance, and the percep-
tion that yoga “focuses on the whole person—mind, body, and spirit” [56].
Commensurate with increasing public interest in the mood benefits of yoga, the number of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating yoga for depression grew significantly in the
decade from 2005 to 2015, with several systematic reviews conducted in succession [61–67] to
evaluate these studies. In all RCTs included in these reviews, the primary intervention involved
yoga-based postures, breathing exercises, and/or techniques for meditation or relaxation. By
the end of 2015, 24 RCTs of yoga for depression [68–91] were identified via systematic reviews,
nearly a 5-fold increase from the 5 RCTs initially identified in 2005 by Pilkington et al [61].
Despite the increasing number of RCTs examining mood effects of yoga, investigation
remains at an early stage of development. While most trials report measureable mood benefits
from yoga, this collective evidence base must be interpreted with caution, as it may reflect pub-
lication bias toward positive studies. Moreover, systematic reviews [61,62,65,67] indicate that
most published RCTs on yoga for depression are hampered by methodological problems. For
example, few studies provided adequate information on methods for randomizing partici-
pants, concealing allocation schedule, blinding assessors and implementing other steps to min-
imize bias in outcomes. Blinding to the yoga allocation was typically not possible, but steps to
address performance bias were not mentioned. Individual trials have tended toward small
sample sizes and selective study populations—such as prenatal women, psychiatric inpatients,
young adults, or community seniors—raising questions about generalizability of findings to
the wider population with depression. From study to study, baseline symptoms of participants
varied considerably: in some trials, participants were healthy with no significant mood symp-
toms [76,79,86,88]; in other trials, participants reported elevated depressive symptoms but had
no diagnosed depressive disorders [73,77,80,82,91,92]; in yet other trials, participants were
diagnosed with either major depression or dysthymia [78,81,83–85,87,89,93]; and finally, in a
few trials, participants were diagnosed with only major depression [69–72,74,90]. While some
trials specifically evaluated yoga as an adjunct to conventional depression care [68,69,74,90],
others allowed some degree of co-intervention with conventional care in an unsystematic
manner, confounding potential mood effects of yoga [78,81,83–85,87,92,93]. Additionally, the
heterogeneity of yoga interventions used in various RCTs limits the ability to pool data for
meta-analysis and draw conclusions about efficacy. Nonetheless, with caveats regarding these
limitations, authors of 5 systematic reviews [61–64,67] and 2 meta-analyses [65,66] conclude
there is preliminary evidence for the efficacy of yoga in the acute treatment of depression.
On the basis of existing clinical trial data, authors of systematic reviews generally suggest
that yoga may be considered as an adjunctive therapy option in depressive disorders [63,65–
67]. However, in at least one review [62], authors suggest there is reasonable evidence to con-
sider yoga as second-line mono-therapy in major depression of mild-to-moderate severity.
This possibility is supported by 3 early RCTs from India [70–72] in which yoga interventions
were investigated as mono-therapy in major depression, and found to have significant mood
benefits. In one trial [71], the yoga intervention was even comparable to pharmacotherapy
with imipramine in achieving remission from depression. Since 2 of the trials involved psychi-
atric inpatients [71,72], and all 3 trials involved Indian participants perhaps having culture-
specific, positive expectations about the efficacy of yoga, questions have been raised about
applicability of findings to non-hospitalized, western populations with major depression.

 Pilkington et al [61] outline additional caveats in interpreting findings from these trials, but as
a group, these 3 RCTs offer persuasive data for continued examination of yoga as mono-ther-
apy for major depression.
Study aims and hypotheses
The primary aim of this pilot RCT was to investigate potential mood benefits of hatha yoga as
mono-therapy for mild-to-moderate major depression in a non-hospitalized, metropolitan U.
S. population sample. Related aims were to assess feasibility and acceptability of the specific
8-week hatha yoga program pilot-tested in this trial, and to obtain empirical data for anti-
depressant effect size estimation for a future, larger scale RCT. Our study was designed to
recruit only individuals with mild-to-moderate major depression, and to exclude those with
suicidal ideation, psychosis, or other functional impairment indicative of severe depression.
Several large meta-analyses [94–96] of placebo-controlled antidepressant medication trials
have compared mood benefits of active medication to placebo in hundreds of adults with
major depression: while benefits of pharmacotherapy over placebo appeared significant for
people with severe major depression, such benefits appeared minimal or even uncertain for
those with mild-to-moderate major depression. Psychological treatments have not appeared
any more efficacious than pharmacotherapy in this latter population [97,98]. Thus, by limiting
our study sample to those with mild-to-moderate major depression, we aimed to recruit indi-
viduals for whom conventional care may offer uncertain benefit.
Due to resource constraints, we did not aim to investigate possible biological factors medi-
ating anti-depressant effects of yoga. However, we aimed for a preliminary investigation of
self-esteem and self-efficacy as possible psychological factors mediating mood improvement
with yoga. Feelings of worthlessness (low self-esteem) and feelings of failure and powerlessness
in meeting life challenges (low self-efficacy) are among the hallmark psychological features of
major depression [99–101]. Classical yoga practice encourages compassionate, non-judgmen-
tal acceptance of one’s limitations and honoring of one’s life essence, thereby having potential
to improve self-esteem. Concurrently, classical yoga practice moves one toward gradual mas-
tery of physical and mental exercises initially perceived as difficult, so that self-efficacy may
also improve. Thus, possible increases in self-esteem and self-efficacy from yoga practice may
help to challenge and reverse the poor self-evaluation characteristic of depressive cognitions,
facilitating recovery from depression. This theory has preliminary support from RCTs suggest-
ing that self-efficacy and self-esteem tend to increase with yoga practice [102–107], and are
associated with concurrent decline in depression [108–113]. Therefore, our study aimed to
explore relationships between yoga practice and changes in depression severity, self-efficacy
and self-esteem.
We hypothesized that relative to an attention control intervention, participation in an
8-week hatha yoga program for major depression would lead to statistically significant reduction
in depression severity, our primary outcome, and statistically significant increases in self-efficacy
and self-esteem, our secondary outcomes. Per recommendations from prior systematic reviews
of yoga RCTs, we sought to reduce methodological issues in this trial by consistent adherence to
good clinical research practice [114] and to reporting guidelines for non-pharmacological trials
developed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [115].

 study protocol for this trial (CHR# H49362-35940-01). The approved protocol and corre-
sponding CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see S1 and S2 Files.
Recruitment took place from May 4, 2010 thru October 22, 2010, and the trial ended on Janu-
ary 15, 2011. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and is accessible at https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01210651. Trial registration occurred after recruitment
started, rather than prior to recruitment. The delay was due to investigators being unfamiliar
with administrative procedures for registration, especially as some institutional procedures for
registering cross-departmental trials were still being refined. The authors confirm that all
ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.
After preliminary phone screening of individuals responding to recruitment ads, those
who appeared eligible were invited to office screening visits with the principal investigator
(PI). The PI engaged each participant in a detailed informed consent discussion about the
study. Participants learned that if they met eligibility criteria and chose to enroll, they
would be opting for randomization to one of the study interventions, instead of obtaining
conventional depression care during the study. The PI explained that neither intervention is
standard depression care, and offered participants referral to standard care in lieu of study
enrollment. The PI discussed the risk of depression increasing over the 8-week study, in
which case participants would be evaluated for study withdrawal and referral to urgent psy-
chiatric care as appropriate. Only those who provided written informed consent were eligi-
ble to proceed with the rest of screening.
Overview of study design
This was a prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group pilot
trial of an 8-week hatha yoga program as mono-therapy in major depression. We recruited 38
adults from the San Francisco community who met diagnostic criteria for mild-to-moderate
major depression, per evaluation with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and
scores of 14–28 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged
in psychotherapy, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, herbal or nutraceutical mood remedies,
or any mind-body practices were excluded. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1
ratio to one of two instructor-led intervention groups: a yoga practice group assigned to
90-minute hatha yoga exercises twice weekly for 8 weeks, versus an attention control education
group assigned to 90-minute yoga history modules twice weekly for 8 weeks. Stratified block
randomization ensured that each intervention group had equal numbers of participants with
mild depression (per screening BDI scores of 14–19) versus moderate depression (per screen-
ing BDI scores of 20–28). Participants were informed at screening that anyone randomized to
the education group would be offered 16 free hatha yoga classes, upon completion of the
study, to learn the same exercises taught to the yoga practice group. Blinded assessors analyzed
outcome data. The primary outcome was depression severity, measured by scores on the BDI
every 2 weeks from baseline thru 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-
esteem, measured by scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and the Rosenberg Self-
Esteem Scale (RSES) at baseline and at 8 weeks.
Recruitment of participants
Participants were recruited via consecutive sampling of eligible individuals responding to IRB-
approved ads posted throughout San Francisco, including libraries, community centers, shop-
ping areas, online classifieds, and UCSF outpatient clinics and clinical trials websites.
Inclusion criteria for participation were: 18 years of age or older; written informed consent;
all genders; all ethnicities; English proficiency sufficient for participation; ability to attend all

 required study visits; diagnosis of current major depression per screening Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); and depression symptoms of either mild severity (per
screening BDI scores of 14–19) or moderate severity (per screening BDI scores of 20–28).
Exclusion criteria for participation were: use of antidepressant or psychotropic medication
within 2 months of screening, or plan to initiate use during study; use of herbal or nutraceuti-
cal mood remedies—such as St. John’s Wort, fish oil, SAMe, or high-dose vitamins—within 2
months of screening, or plan to initiate use during study; use of psychotherapy at screening, or
plan to initiate during study; use of yoga/mind-body practices at screening, or plan to initiate
such practices during the study, other than allocated intervention; impaired cognition per
score < 24 on screening Folstein Mental Status Exam; illicit drug use or diagnosis of substance
use disorder within 3 months of screening MINI; diagnosis of bipolar disorder or other Axis I
disorders comorbid with major depression per screening MINI; severe major depression per
score > 28 on screening BDI; history of suicide attempts, suicidal ideation or psychosis; diag-
nosis of pregnancy; history of seizure disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or carotid artery
stenosis; and acute medical or psychiatric symptoms likely to interfere with study
participation.
Randomization and concealment of allocation
Each consenting participant completed a screening assessment with the PI, who was the study
physician. The PI indicated on a Summary Form whether the participant—referenced only by
a unique, computer-generated, random identification number—was eligible to continue in the
study, and if so, whether depression severity was “mild” versus “moderate” according to
screening BDI score. The PI had no further contact with participants, barring an adverse event
requiring direct physician evaluation. Participants were assigned to intervention indepen-
dently of the PI, with assignments concealed from the PI to prevent unconscious attempts to
predict allocation schedule. For each eligible participant, the study coordinator faxed the Sum-
mary Form to the statistician, who worked remotely from the screening site and had no con-
tact with participants. Using a SAS v9.0 program for block randomization stratified by
depression severity, the statistician randomly assigned each participant to an intervention
group, such that participants with mild depression, and those with moderate depression, were
distributed equally between the two groups; block size was programmed to vary, minimizing
risk of study personnel predicting allocation schedule. The statistician faxed back the Sum-
mary Form to the study coordinator, indicating the participant’s intervention assignment in a
coded format. The study coordinator, who was not involved in delivery of interventions or
outcome assessments, communicated the allocation to each participant. All Summary Forms
were stored in locked file cabinets upon completion of fax transactions. Except the statistician,
no study personnel had access to the SAS program, stored as an encrypted, password-pro-
tected electronic file.
Interventions
Background and development of interventions.
Prior to the current trial, the PI traveled
to Bangalore, India, making site visits to two separate, well-established research centers with
special expertise in conducting clinical trials of yoga: the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Research
Foundation, and the Integrated Centre for Yoga at the National Institute of Mental Health and
Neuroscience. At both sites, the PI met with investigators involved in studies of yoga therapies
for depression, and made detailed observations of yoga protocols implemented in these trials.
Yoga postures and breathing techniques in the current pilot study were adapted from a publi-
cation of the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Research Foundation, which consolidated and

 documented, on the basis of classical yoga theory, a well-defined set of yoga practices to allevi-
ate depressive symptoms [116]. The PI pilot-tested a portion of this yoga sequence for depres-
sion in an open-label clinical trial with outpatients at a San Francisco mental health day
program [117]; see S3 File. Based on preliminary data from this open-label trial, and interviews
with several (n = 15) U.S. yoga teachers and practitioners, the hatha yoga sequence in the cur-
rent study protocol was refined and finalized.
Once components of the hatha yoga intervention were established, a major challenge lay in
selecting a suitable control intervention. Previous investigators have described the difficulties
inherent in choosing an appropriate control when studying mind-body therapies for depres-
sion [118–120]. In theory, an optimal control would account for non-specific mood effects of a
mind-body practice, but without obscuring or confounding any specific mood effects deriving
from the “active ingredient” of that practice. In reality, however, it may be difficult to distin-
guish the non-specific effects of a mind-body therapy from its specific effects, and to identify
the active ingredient(s) producing those specific effects. The RCT of yoga conducted by Rohini
et al [72] is illustrative of these difficulties: in an innovative study design, investigators
attempted to identify the active ingredient mediating anti-depressant effects of a particular
yoga sequence, and then subtracted this component to create a “partial” yoga sequence that
would serve as a credible placebo control. Yet, after 4 weeks, both the full and partial yoga
sequences appeared to produce substantial and equivalent mood benefits. Perhaps this
occurred because the partial yoga sequence still contained some portion of the active ingredi-
ent that provided a specific anti-depressant effect; alternatively, perhaps non-specific effects of
both yoga sequences were powerful in alleviating depressed mood among participants.
Since mind-body therapies generally are not amenable to placebo control, other types of con-
trol intervention must be considered carefully, bearing in mind that the choice of comparator
can significantly moderate effect size. In meta-analyses that examined yoga for depression [65],
mindfulness-based therapies for depression [121], and exercise for depression [122], the effect
size of the studied intervention decreased significantly in magnitude when the comparator
changed from waitlist control/treatment-as-usual (TAU) to a more active control. In a recent
meta-analysis of meditation RCTs, which included several yoga-based meditation interventions,
Jain et al [119] point out that even TAU and waitlist controls may not be as “inert” in their
mood effects as expected: they found that TAU/waitlist controls ranged from having moderate
negative effects (-0.60) to large positive effects (1.54). This suggests that TAU/waitlist controls
may function variably as “nocebos” with detrimental effects due to negative expectation, or as
placebos with salutary effects due to positive expectation, or even as interventions with specific
mood effects, depending on how much anti-depressant treatment occurs in the TAU arm. Jain
et al suggest that psycho-education groups may offer the best option as control interventions in
RCTs of meditation for depression, as these groups are associated with a fairly consistent range
of small, positive effect sizes (0.02 to 0.54) when used as comparators in depression trials.
We considered the option of a psycho-education group as the comparator in this trial, but
had concerns about potential nocebo effects. We reasoned that participants recruited to our
study might have a particular interest in yoga or mind-body therapies, and perhaps the pros-
pect of yoga therapy, more so than the prospect of conventional care, had finally motivated
them to address their depressive symptoms. For such participants, randomization to a conven-
tional psycho-education group, with no connection to mind-body therapies, might carry more
risk of exerting a negative effect on mood than if these individuals had not had a pre-existing
interest in alternative medicine. Therefore, in designing our control, we retained the format of
education modules associated with conventional psycho-education groups, but modified the
content to focus on yoga-related themes. Psycho-education modules for major depression typ-
ically provide information and facilitate discussion on the etiology and epidemiology of

 depression, as well as symptoms, treatment options and coping strategies. Instead, our educa-
tion modules provided information and facilitated discussion on yoga origins, history and phi-
losophy, as well as major yoga schools and teachers in India and abroad. We anticipated that
delivery of yoga-themed content to control participants, along with an opportunity to learn
hatha yoga exercises on study completion, would help defray disappointment and possible
nocebo effects related to allocation.
Intervention setting and precautions.
Both interventions took place at the UCSF Osher
Center for Integrative Medicine, and all data were collected at this site. Within one week of the
office screen, each randomized participant was assigned to begin attending his or her allocated
group sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks total. Group instructors took attendance. Sessions for
both interventions were available on a rolling basis throughout the study until the last partici-
pant completed the 8-week protocol.
It was not possible to blind either instructors or participants to the allocated intervention.
The PI took several steps to mitigate any resulting performance bias. Prior to recruitment,
when training instructors, the PI highlighted the potential of non-specific mood benefits to
result from allocation to either intervention, and stressed the importance of holding a neutral
attitude with participants regarding outcomes. Once the trial began, the study coordinator
made periodic unannounced visits to both intervention groups to monitor instruction quality
and adherence to protocol, and the PI met regularly with each instructor to discuss any issues
in delivering interventions. To minimize performance bias in participants, the PI informed
prospective participants at screening that both interventions might have positive effects on
mood due to the process of learning novel information; the PI also mentioned that for people
randomized to the education group, information gained on yoga history and philosophy
might enhance subsequent learning and practice of hatha yoga exercises during free classes
offered on study completion.
To protect participants against adverse consequences of any psychiatric decline during the
study, several safety measures were in place: (a) During the pre-recruitment phase, all study
personnel having contact with participants were trained by the PI to recognize and report
potential signs of worsening depression in participants. (b) Instructors observed participants
closely during the twice-weekly intervention sessions, monitoring for evidence of clinical
decline. (c) Formal monitoring of depression severity occurred every 2 weeks via the BDI, with
plan for direct evaluation by the PI, a Board-certified psychiatrist, should any participant indi-
cate suicidal ideation on Item 9 of the BDI. (d) Study personnel undertook vigorous follow-up
of any participant absenteeism. (e) Direct evaluation by the PI was available should any partici-
pant report suicidal ideation, psychosis or subjective worsening of depression during the study.
Attention control intervention.
Participants randomized to the attention control group
attended instructor-led, 90-minute education modules on yoga history and philosophy. The 16
modules comprising the attention control intervention were adapted from a series of commu-
nity lectures previously given by the PI; see S4 File. Since participants would join the attention
control group on a rolling basis, the education modules were designed to function as stand-
alone sessions, rather than requiring presentation in a specific sequence. The instructor was a
registered yoga teacher with additional certification by the Chopra Center as a Vedic Master
Educator in yoga philosophy. In each module, short lectures were enhanced by documentary
film clips carefully selected to focus on key historical figures and major branches of the yoga
tradition, rather than depicting details of specific yoga practices. Interactive dialogue was
encouraged between instructor and participants. Modules were intended to control for non-
specific mood benefits of the hatha yoga intervention, from factors such as attention from
study personnel, peer interaction, time spent away from routine activities, and anticipation
related to mastering novel yoga-related information.

 Hatha yoga intervention.
Participants randomized to the hatha yoga group attended
instructor-led, 90-minute practice sessions comprised of classical yoga breathing tech-
niques, mindful body postures, and final deep relaxation pose (Table 1). Several postures
featured a chest-opening element, traditionally thought to help alleviate depression. The
same hatha yoga sequence was used in all sessions. The instructor was a certified yoga
teacher and also a licensed, registered nurse with 5 years of experience in teaching hatha
yoga to adults with a range of medical issues and yoga skill levels. During sessions, yoga
practices were broken down into component elements and taught progressively to each stu-
dent in accordance with his or her ability. The nurse-instructor encouraged participants to
remain within their range of motion or comfort, and made appropriate accommodations
for those with limitations in flexibility or tolerance for any exercise. Props, such as blocks
and bolsters, were used to support participants in learning and holding yoga poses safely,
particularly backbends or inversions. In the unlikely event of injury, the nurse-instructor
was equipped to provide immediate medical triage and assistance.
Instruments and measures
Physician evaluation form. During office screens, the PI used this project-specific form
to record each participant’s demographic data, medical history, physical exam findings, and
study eligibility.
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). During office screens, the PI
administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0.0) to diagnose
major depression and to exclude co-morbid psychiatric disorders in participants. The MINI is
a validated, structured, diagnostic interview tool [123,124] with questions that parallel symp-
toms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [125]. The MINI can be
administered in 15 minutes by trained clinicians and has high diagnostic reliability with
lengthier instruments developed by the World Health Organization.
Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE).
During office screens, the PI administered
the Folstein Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) to assess cognition of participants. The
MMSE is validated and widely used instrument to evaluate cognitive status via tests of orienta-
tion, attention, memory, and basic language skills [126,127]. Total score on the MMSE ranges
from 0–30. Performance varies by age and educational level, but scores below 24 may suggest
cognitive impairment.
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI): Primary outcome measure.
The Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI) was first completed by all participants at the office screen to help determine
eligibility, and then repeated by randomized participants just prior to baseline session and just
after sessions at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. The BDI is a 21-item, validated instrument for the self-
report of depressive symptoms, appearing in hundreds of studies worldwide [128–130]. Indi-
vidual item scores are summed for a total BDI score ranging from 0–63. BDI scores from 0–13
suggest absent to minimal depressive symptoms, from 14–19 mild symptoms, from 20–28
moderate symptoms, and from 29–63 severe depressive symptoms.
General self-efficacy scale: Secondary outcome measure.
Participants completed the
General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) just prior to the baseline session and just after the 8-week
session. The GSES is a validated, 10-item, self-administered instrument [131,132] designed to
assess self-efficacy—that is, the belief that one’s actions lead to successful outcomes in coping
with difficult life demands. Individual item scores are summed for a total GSES score of 10–40.
Higher scores indicate stronger belief in one’s self-efficacy.
Rosenberg self-esteem scale: Secondary outcome measure.
Participants completed the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) just prior to the baseline session and just after the 8-week

Segment
Description
Introduction & Guidelines (5
mins)
Instructor welcomes all participants, including those joining session for first
time. Reviews guidelines for yoga practice, encouraging participants to
remain within their range of motion or comfort in performing any exercise.
Emphasizes that accommodations are available for each exercise, so that
those with limitations may still take part. Each participant settles into a
comfortable seated position with erect spine and neck, either on chair or
cross-legged on the ground.
Breath Regulation (20 mins)
Ujjayi (Victorious Breath): deep, slow breathing completed at rate of about 4
respirations/minute against mild airway resistance. Participants learn
techniques to slightly contract laryngeal muscles and partially close the
glottis to maintain mild airway resistance during inspiration and expiration.
Bhastrika (Bellows Breath): breath is forcefully inhaled and then exhaled
through nostrils at a rate of about 20–30 respirations/minute while using
strong abdominal muscle contractions.
Nadi Shodana (Alternate Nostril Breathing): relaxed breathing pattern with
inhalation and exhalation done through just one nostril at a time. Breathing
occurs at a normal rate of 12 respirations/minute.
Brahmari (Bumblebee Breath): Slow breathing is done while eyes and ears
are covered via specific placement of hands over face and external ear flaps.
There is long slow inhalation and then a gentle humming sound is made with
exhalation. Breathing occurs at a rate of about 6 respirations/minute.
Mindful Poses & Movement
(50 mins)
Ardhakati Chakrasana (Half Waist Wheel Pose): Participants stand upright
and then gently bend from waist sideways to the right as far as comfortable,
while stretching left arm upward. Returning to an upright stance, they repeat
exercise, but bending to the left while stretching right arm up.
Ardha Chakrasana (Half Wheel Pose): Participants stand upright with hands
supporting the lower back. They gently bend backwards from the lower
lumbar region as far as comfortable, allowing neck to drop slowly while
hands continue to support the lower back.
Pada Hastasana (Hands to Feet Pose): Participants stand upright with arms
raised, and gently bend forward until torso is parallel to ground; participants
flexible enough continue to bend forward until hands are touching the feet
and the head is touching the knees.
Bhujungasana (Cobra Pose): Participants lie on ground in prone position.
They gently arch the head and spine backwards as far as comfortable,
supporting the torso with arms bent at elbow and palms firmly on ground.
Dhanurasana (Bow Pose): Participants lie on the ground in a prone position.
Then, knees are bent with feet moving toward buttocks as far as possible,
and the neck gently arched backward. Participants flexible enough gently
grasp the ankles with their hands.
Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand): Participants lie on the ground in a supine
position. Participants with sufficient strength and flexibility raise legs slowly
until the legs are perpendicular to the ground; other participants position their
legs against a wall so that the legs are as perpendicular to the ground as
possible. Those with sufficient strength and flexibility then raise the buttocks
and trunk off the ground, keeping the shoulders and elbows firmly on the
ground and supporting the back with both palms while the legs remain
perpendicular to the ground.
Matsyasana (Fish Pose): Participants lie on ground in supine position.
Hands are placed palm down underneath the back, with fingers pointing
toward spine. Pressing down on palms, the chest is slowly raised and back is
arched as far as comfortable, with weight of torso supported on elbows.
Setu Bandhasana (Bridge Pose): Participants lie on ground in a supine
position. Then the knees are bent while keeping the soles of the feet on the
ground. Arms are kept alongside the torso, but with palms on the floor. The
hips are lifted off the floor towards the ceiling as far as comfortable, keeping
the feet and palms flat on the floor.

 session. The RSES is a validated self-administered 10-item scale [133,134] to assess feelings of
self-worth. Individual item scores are summed for a total RSES score of 0–30. Scores below 15
suggest possible problems with self-esteem, while scores of 15–25 suggest typical self-esteem,
and scores of 26–30 suggest high self-esteem.
Enrollment Log. Throughout the trial, the study coordinator maintained a project-spe-
cific Enrollment Log tallying the screening, accrual, allocation and attrition data depicted in
Fig 1.
Session Logs. Instructors used project-specific Session Logs to record attendance at all
intervention groups and to make notes regarding progress and engagement of individual
participants.
Adverse Events Log.
Monitoring for adverse events occurred continuously throughout
the clinical trial by study personnel having contact with participants. Any adverse event in
either intervention group was reported immediately to the PI, who maintained a written, proj-
ect-specific Adverse Events Log and provided guidance and oversight to study personnel
regarding appropriate responses.
Final Feedback Questionnaire.
The project-specific Final Feedback Questionnaire
requested study completers to disclose use of any co-interventions and to rate instructor qual-
ity, content quality, and difficulty and acceptability of the allocated intervention. Suggestions
for improvement were also solicited.
Outcome data collection
Since all primary and secondary outcome data in this trial were to be obtained from self-report
instruments (BDI, RSES and GSES), it was possible to have instruments self-administered by
Table 1. (Continued)
Segment
Description
Balasana (Child Pose): Participants kneel on ground with feet tucked under
the buttocks, if possible. Participants then bend forward at waist, bringing
chest as close to knees as possible, and resting forehead on the ground, if
flexible enough. Arms are extended on the ground, palms down.
Vakrasana (Twisted Pose): Participants sit on ground with both legs
outstretched. Then the left leg is bent at knee with sole of the left foot placed
on ground alongside the right knee. The upper part of the body is twisted to
the left as much as possible, keeping shoulders in plane with the chest and
supporting the torso on the left arm, with left hand firmly planted palm-down
on the ground. Elbow of the right arm should be straight and pressed against
the lateral surface of the bent left knee. After holding this pose, participants
return torso, arms and legs to the beginning position. Then participants
repeat pose so that right leg is bent and upper body twists to the right side.
Ustrasana (Camel Pose): Participants kneel on ground, keeping neck and
spine perpendicular to ground. Then spine is arched back gently so that
chest puffs out. Those flexible enough reach hands back one at a time to
grasp heels. Others reach back to blocks placed on either side of feet.
Final Deep Relaxation (15
mins)
Shavasana (Corpse Pose): Participants lie on ground in a supine position,
with eyes closed. Arms are stretched away from the torso, palms up. Legs
are separated about a shoulder width apart, and the feet rotate out slightly.
With calm, soft verbalizations, the instructor guides participants into deep
relaxation in this pose, as the breath gradually settles into a slow, restful
rhythm.

 participants. Five envelopes, corresponding to the 5 measurement points, were prepared for
each participant prior to group allocation. Each envelope contained blank BDI, RSES, and
GSES forms as appropriate for the corresponding measurement point. Each envelope was pre-
labeled with participant’s study ID number and time-point at which contents should be com-
pleted. At baseline session and subsequent 4 sessions comprising measurement points, partici-
pants went to a designated file box that held their 5 pre-labeled envelopes, and picked out the
envelope labeled for that time-point. In an unstaffed classroom, participants opened their
envelopes, completed enclosed forms using written instructions, sealed forms in envelopes,
and deposited envelopes into a slotted lockbox. At the end of each intervention day, all sealed
envelopes in lockbox were delivered to study personnel blind to participant allocations. Enve-
lopes were unsealed and enclosed outcome data recorded electronically on a secure drive, with
participants identified only by study ID numbers. Since hatha yoga sessions were held on the
same days as control group sessions, personnel opening sealed envelopes could not predict the
intervention group from which a given envelope originated.

 Data analysis methods
Overview and sample size.
Statistical analyses were conducted in a blinded manner, with
de-identified data provided to the statistician in electronic files labeled only as “Dataset A” and
“Dataset B.” Data were reviewed to ascertain that distributions of measures met the assump-
tions of the statistical tests to be used. Analyses were performed with Stata software, Version
14.1. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a p-value < 0.05 was set a priori as the threshold
for statistical significance.
Sample size in this pilot trial was based primarily on participant and resource availability dur-
ing the recruitment timeline. However, we aimed to collect data from a sufficient number of
study completers to estimate a Cohen’s d anti-depressant effect size of yoga relative to control.
Prior to recruitment, we calculated that a sample size of 20 participants in each intervention
group, even with 25% attrition, would still provide 80% power to detect a between-group effect
size of d = 1.0, using an independent samples t-test with two-tailed alpha = 0.05. Anti-depressant
effect sizes of this magnitude were found in prior yoga RCTs with small samples [70,73,81,86].
Evaluating feasibility and acceptability.
Feasibility and acceptability of this trial were
evaluated, in part, via accrual, retention and adherence rates tallied from the Enrollment and
Session Logs. Our target accrual rate was set at 8 randomized participants per month over 5
months, to achieve a total sample size of 40. Retention rate was defined as the percentage of
randomized participants completing 8-week study measures. Adherence rate was defined as
the percentage of allocated sessions attended by participants; adherence was examined only in
study completers, since retention data would already reflect any non-adherence due to drop-
out. Feasibility and acceptability were also evaluated via data from the Adverse Events Log and
the Final Feedback Questionnaires.
Evaluating participant characteristics.
Salient demographic and clinical characteristics
of participants were evaluated via descriptive statistics. Descriptive measures were constructed
for the sample as a whole, and also for sub-groups based on intervention assignment. Frequen-
cies were calculated for categorical variables, and means with standard deviations were calcu-
lated for continuous variables. To examine whether clinical and demographic characteristics of
randomized participants were distributed equally between the two groups, categorical variables
were compared via Fisher’s exact test and continuous variables via the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Approach to intent-to-treat analyses of depression severity.
The main analysis of
depression severity, measured by BDI scores, used an intent-to-treat approach and incorpo-
rated data from all randomized participants regardless of adherence to protocol or premature
dropout. We hypothesized that over the 8-week study period, participants in the yoga practice
group would achieve a statistically significant reduction in BDI scores compared to partici-
pants in the control group. We estimated and tested a random-effects generalized least squares
(GLS) regression model for depression severity, using BDI scores obtained at baseline, 2
weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks. Baseline BDI scores were obtained just prior to partici-
pants beginning the first allocated intervention session, and final BDI scores were obtained
just after the last intervention session at 8 weeks. For randomized participants who dropped
out before baseline BDI scores could be obtained, data imputation was done via carrying for-
ward BDI scores from screening. Trends in BDI scores across the five assessment points were
modeled for each intervention group, and maximum likelihood estimations were used to
derive an adjusted mean BDI score for each intervention group at each assessment point. BDI
scores were modeled as correlated within participants, but independent between participants.
Demographic and clinical covariates appraised at screening—such as age, gender, ethnicity,
depression severity, and so on—were each examined in the preliminary statistical model as
controls, and impact on depression outcomes was evaluated. Covariates that proved to be

 statistically non-significant were omitted in the final model. The model included effects for
intervention group, to test whether change in mean BDI scores over a given interval varied sig-
nificantly by group, and for intervention-by-time, to test whether mean BDI scores within
each group varied significantly between assessment points.
The main analysis of depression severity was followed by two additional intent-to-treat
GLS regression analyses. The first of these was a sensitivity analysis to examine an alternate
method for handling missing BDI scores at baseline. In the sensitivity analysis, we considered
each randomized participant’s BDI score from screening as the first of six repeated outcome
measures, rather than a pre-intervention covariate in the model. Results from the sensitivity
analysis were then compared to those from the main analysis. In the second follow-up analysis,
we included as a key predictor the number of assigned intervention sessions completed by ran-
domized participants at each assessment point, and examined the interaction of this variable
with intervention group and with depression outcomes.
Approach to completers analyses of depression severity.
Following intent-to-treat anal-
yses of BDI scores, we re-analyzed BDI scores in study completers (n = 25), defined as those
participants providing both baseline measures and final 8-week measures. Among study com-
pleters, we first examined the interaction of BDI scores with intervention group and with
intervention-by-time, using a random-effects GLS regression model. We hypothesized that
completers in the yoga group would have greater decline in BDI scores than completers in the
control group. Next, we evaluated the number of completers in each intervention group who
achieved remission from depression, defining remission as a BDI score � 9 at the final 8-week
assessment [135–137]. We hypothesized that study completers in the yoga group would be
more likely than those in the control group to achieve remission; we tested this hypothesis by
using Fisher’s exact test to compare remission rates in the two groups.
Approach to analyses of self-efficacy & self-esteem.
Analyses of GSES scores (measure
of self-efficacy) and RSES scores (measure of self-esteem) were limited to study completers
(n = 25), since the GSES and RSES were collected only at baseline and at 8 weeks. We hypothe-
sized that over the 8-week study, yoga participants would show greater increase in GSES scores
and in RSES scores compared to controls. Using paired t-tests, we first analyzed within each
group whether mean GSES scores differed between baseline and 8 weeks. Next, using an inde-
pendent samples t-test, we determined whether mean change in GSES scores differed between
the two intervention groups. We repeated this procedure to analyze change in RSES scores
within each group, and then between groups.
Estimating effect size.
Following tests of statistical significance, we analyzed study out-
comes for clinical significance via estimates of effect size. For this analysis, we examined out-
come data from study completers in each intervention group (n = 15 in yoga group, n = 10 in
control group). For each outcome measure, we determined the mean change score over 8
weeks, along with corresponding standard deviation. The magnitude and direction of the yoga
intervention’s effect, relative to the control, was then calculated for each outcome via the for-
mula for Cohen’s d [138], along with 95% confidence intervals. Following conventions pro-
posed by Cohen [139], we considered an effect size with an absolute value � 0.2 and < 0.5 to
be a small but appreciable clinical effect; an absolute value � 0.5 and < 0.8 to be a moderate
clinical effect; and an absolute value � 0.8 to represent a large clinical effect.
Results
Overview of enrollment
Over a 5-month recruitment period, 97 individuals were screened for eligibility (Fig 1). A total
of 59 individuals were excluded from study participation, for reasons described in Fig 1. A

 total of 38 participants met inclusion criteria and were randomized to study interventions,
with 20 participants allocated to the yoga group and 18 participants allocated to the attention
control group. Among those randomized, 8 participants never started their allocated interven-
tions (n = 2 in yoga group, n = 6 in control group), for reasons listed in Fig 1. An additional 5
participants dropped out before the final session at 8 weeks (n = 3 in yoga group, n = 2 in con-
trol group), for reasons listed in Fig 1. Thus, a total of 13 participants were lost to follow-up
(n = 5 in yoga group, n = 8 in control group). Final 8-week measures were obtained from 75%
(n = 15) in the yoga group, 56% (n = 10) in the control group, and 66% (n = 25) in the total
sample. Despite any participants lost to follow-up, all 38 randomized participants were
included in intent-to-treat analyses of depression severity, the primary outcome.
Findings on feasibility & acceptability
Accrual, retention and adherence.
The average accrual rate was 7.6 randomized partici-
pants per month, close to the target of 8 we had aimed for. Participants were drawn largely
from non-clinical community venues. Retention rate in the total sample was 66%, and the
retention rate of 75% in the yoga group and 56% in the control group were statistically compa-
rable (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 0.307). As evident from Fig 1, nearly all dropout by control
participants occurred very early in the study, after learning the intervention allocation, and
before attending the first allocated session. When we re-evaluated retention among partici-
pants (n = 30) who attended at least the first allocated session, retention rates in the two groups
were identical at 83%. Adherence rate in study completers was found to be 65%, and the adher-
ence rate of 74% in yoga group completers and 51% in control group completers were statisti-
cally comparable (unpaired t-test p-value = 0.10).
Report of adverse events.
Aside from 2 instances of musculoskeletal injury (back strain
from heavy lifting; sprained ankle from soccer) that occurred outside study sessions, there
were no serious adverse events related to participation in either intervention. In minor adverse
events, 5 of 18 participants (28%) who attended at least one yoga practice session reported
transient musculoskeletal discomfort when learning yoga poses; discomfort resolved as partici-
pants adjusted to the yoga regimen and implemented accommodations for limited flexibility.
No adverse events occurred during breathing exercises or the final relaxation segment.
Qualitative Feedback from participants.
The Final Feedback Questionnaire was
obtained from 9 of 15 study completers in the yoga group (60%) and 5 of 10 study completers
in the control group (50%). Participants in neither group reported co-intervention with phar-
macotherapy or mind-body practices outside study sessions, but 1 participant in the control
group reported co-intervention with psychotherapy. Participants in neither group felt that
depressive symptoms interfered with learning and mastering the content presented. Overall, 7
of 9 yoga participants and 4 of 5 control participants made positive comments about their
learning experience, appreciating the pace of instruction, instructor quality, and content qual-
ity. To improve the study in future, 4 of 9 yoga participants suggested increasing practice ses-
sions to 3 times weekly, and 5 of 9 yoga participants suggested optional yoga history modules
offered to those who completed the yoga practice group. There were no suggestions for change
regarding the yoga history modules, except from 1 of 5 control participants, who thought mod-
ules would be improved by emphasizing scientific studies of yoga rather than yoga philosophy.
Findings on participant characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of all randomized participants are shown in Table 2.
There were no statistically significant differences between the two intervention groups. Our
total sample was comprised of about two-thirds women and one-third men, ranging in age

 from 22 to 72 years and having a mean age of 43.4 years (SD = 14.8). While 58% of participants
were of European descent, participants of Asian, Latino, African and multi-ethnic descent
were also represented, reflecting the diversity of the San Francisco area. A large proportion
(89%) of participants were single (divorced, widowed or never married). The majority (63%)
had a 4-year college degree or higher, and another 32% had attended 2 years of college. Of the

 total sample, 53% were employed and 13% retired, with the remaining one-third either in
school or unemployed. Nearly two-thirds of the sample (64%) had some previous yoga expo-
sure—typically erratic past attendance at a few community yoga classes, rather than regular
practice; anyone engaged in yoga practice at screening had been excluded from study
participation.
The majority of our sample (79%) had depression of moderate severity; our stratified block
randomization method was successful in distributing participants with mild depression, and
those with moderate depression, in equal proportions between the two groups. The great
majority of participants had experienced previous episodes of major depression, with 58% hav-
ing one prior episode, 24% having 2 prior episodes, and 8% having 3 prior episodes. About a
third of participants had never tried antidepressant medication, while 39% had been on one
previous medication trial, and the remaining 27% had been on 2 or more medication trials. On
the Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam, participants met cognitive norms for age and education.
Results from intent-to-treat analyses of depression severity
In the main intent-to-treat GLS regression analysis of depression outcomes, BDI scores from
all randomized participants (n = 38) were evaluated from baseline thru study completion. As
none of the appraised demographic or clinical covariates of participants proved to be signifi-
cant in the preliminary model, they were omitted in the final analysis. Fig 2 depicts time-plots
of the adjusted mean BDI scores, along with 95% confidence intervals, for each intervention
group at each assessment point. As hypothesized, a statistically significant group-by-time
interaction emerged, indicating that in comparison to the control group, those in the yoga
practice group experienced a greater decline in depression symptoms over the 8-week study
(p-value = 0.034).

 The adjusted mean BDI scores and 95% confidence intervals depicted in Fig 2 time-plots
are presented in numeric form in Table 3. From baseline to final assessment at 8 weeks, the
adjusted mean BDI score in the yoga group decreased by 9.47 points [95% CI, 12.37 to 6.57];
during the same interval, the adjusted mean BDI score in the control group decreased by 2.99
points [95% CI, 6.43 to 0.45]. The difference between the two groups in these 8-week BDI
change scores is statistically significant (p-value = 0.005). However, the more conservative p-
value of 0.034 obtained from the GLS regression analysis is likely a more reliable estimate of
statistical significance when comparing depression outcomes between the two groups, since
the regression analysis takes into account the trajectory of change in BDI scores over the entire
8 weeks, rather than focusing on change between only two time-points.
Two additional intent-to-treat GLS regression analyses augmented findings from the main
analysis of depression outcomes. In the sensitivity analysis, the yoga group again showed more
decline in BDI scores over the 8-week study compared to controls; this group-by-time interac-
tion was associated with a p-value of 0.036 in the sensitivity analysis, nearly identical to the p-
value of 0.034 in the main analysis. In the second analysis, which examined BDI scores after
controlling for number of sessions attended by each participant, the yoga group continued to
show greater reduction in BDI scores by 8 weeks than did the control group (p-value = 0.045).
Results from completers analyses of depression severity
Among study completers (n = 25), GLS regression analysis of depression severity demon-
strated a statistically significant group-by-time interaction; as hypothesized, BDI scores over
the 8-week intervention period declined more significantly in the yoga group than in the con-
trol group (p-value = 0.014). In the analysis of remission, 9 of 15 completers in the yoga group
achieved remission (60% remission), while 1 of 10 completers in the control group achieved
remission (10% remission). The difference in these remission rates was statistically significant
(Fisher’s Exact Test p-value = 0.018).
Results from analyses of self-efficacy & self-esteem
Analyses of GSES scores (measure of self-efficacy) and RSES scores (measure of self-esteem)
were limited to study completers (n = 25), and are summarized in Table 4.
From baseline to 8 weeks, GSES scores among completers in the yoga group increased sig-
nificantly (p-value = 0.001). However, over the same interval, GSES scores among completers
in the control group also showed an increase, trending toward statistical significance (p-
value = 0.076). Therefore, contrary to our hypothesis, increase in self-efficacy, as measured by
GSES change scores, was comparable in both groups of completers (p-value = 0.50). From
baseline to 8 weeks, RSES scores increased significantly among completers in the yoga group
(p-value = 0.006), but not in the control group (p-value = 0.838). However, the difference

 between the two groups in RSES change scores narrowly missed the threshold for statistical
significance (p-value = 0.053). Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, increase in self-esteem, as
measured by RSES change scores, was comparable in both groups of completers.
Results on effect size
Using change score data from study completers (n = 25), the effect size of yoga, relative to con-
trol, was estimated for each outcome measure (Table 5). The Cohen’s d effect size of yoga in
reducing BDI scores was relatively large at -0.96 [95% CI, -1.81 to -0.12]. All values in the con-
fidence interval were noted to be negative, indicating that the direction of effect, at least 95%
of the time, would be toward reducing BDI scores. However, some values in the confidence
interval were noted to fall below an absolute value of 0.20, the threshold proposed by Cohen to
represent a small but appreciable clinical effect.
Yoga appeared to exert a small, positive effect of 0.29 [95% CI, -0.52 to 1.09] in increasing
GSES scores, and a large, positive effect of 0.82 [95% CI, -0.01 to 1.65] in increasing RSES
scores. However, in both cases, the 95% confidence interval for the effects included zero, leav-
ing open the possibility that any apparent effects of yoga on GSES scores and RSES scores were
simply due to chance.
Discussion
Unique aspects of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of yoga, outside of India, characterized by both of the
following features: a) all participants restricted to those with diagnosed major depression, and
b) eligibility criteria explicitly excluded co-intervention with either conventional or non-con-
ventional depression therapies. Both features are essential to an investigation of yoga as a
potential mono-therapy for major depression. As described earlier, there have been an expand-
ing number of RCTs investigating the efficacy of yoga in treating depressive symptoms. How-
ever, among such RCTs identified via published systematic reviews, there appear to be only 6
trials in which all participants were restricted to a clinical diagnosis of major depression [69–

 72,74,90]. Among these 6 trials, 3 were designed to assess yoga as an augmentation to anti-
depressant medication [69,74,90], rather than as mono-therapy. The remaining 3 RCTs exam-
ined yoga as mono-therapy for major depression [70–72], and were all conducted in India.
Thus, with our pilot RCT, the investigation of yoga as mono-therapy for major depression is
extended for the first time to a western population sample.
In the United States, our pilot study also appears to be the first RCT to evaluate acute mood
effects of yoga in a sample that included both men and women with a diagnosed depressive
disorder—whether major depression or not. One prior RCT of yoga in the U.S. recruited a
small, mixed-gender sample diagnosed with a variety of chronic depressive disorders [78];
however, in published data from this trial, depression outcomes were not reported at the time
the yoga intervention ended, so acute mood effects of yoga are unknown. To date, all other
RCTs of yoga involving U.S. participants with diagnosed depressive disorders have recruited
only women [81,83–85,87,93], and nearly all of these single-gender RCTs recruited only peri-
partum women [81,83–85,93]. Although very important to investigate yoga as a therapeutic
option in depressed peri-partum women, RCTs with such selective participant samples may
limit the ability to generalize findings to the larger population with depression. In sum,
although our sample was small (n = 12 men, n = 26 women), this pilot study contributes
important early RCT data regarding acute mood benefits of yoga in a mixed-gender U.S. popu-
lation with a clinically diagnosed depressive disorder.
This pilot trial appears distinct from many previous yoga trials by providing a relatively
detailed description of the yoga intervention. Well-documented protocols facilitate the replica-
tion studies essential to build on pilot investigations and eventually expand therapeutic
options. We selected fairly commonplace, “open source” practices from classical yoga as com-
ponents of the hatha yoga sequence, so that participants seeking to continue these yoga prac-
tices after study completion would readily find community classes, teachers, or instructional
media as needed.
Interpreting intent-to-treat analyses of depression severity
In the main intent-to-treat analysis, the yoga group exhibited greater decline in BDI scores
than controls (p-value = 0.034), supporting the hypothesis that hatha yoga practice would
reduce depression severity. In reviewing time-plots in Fig 2, BDI scores at baseline were statis-
tically comparable in the two intervention groups. At 2 weeks, participation in both groups
was associated with a sharp and statistically comparable decline in BDI scores; this finding sug-
gests that our control intervention was effective in accounting for the yoga intervention’s
potential non-specific mood benefit from factors such as instructor attention, peer interaction,
shift from routine activities, and/or anticipation about learning novel yoga-related informa-
tion. At 4 weeks and 6 weeks, BDI scores in the two groups remained statistically lower than
baseline and statistically comparable to one another, suggesting an ongoing non-specific mood
benefit of similar magnitude in both groups related to study participation.
BDI scores did not statistically differentiate the two intervention groups until the final
8-week measurement point, when depression scores in the yoga group were significantly lower
than in the control group. One interpretation of this finding is that there may be a delay in
onset of yoga-specific mood benefit, perhaps related to the time involved for participants to
learn and master the yoga exercises, and the time required for psycho-physiological factors
mediating specific mood benefits of yoga to develop and exert a measureable effect. Such an
interpretation is plausible given that other interventions for major depression have been asso-
ciated with some delay in exerting specific, measureable mood effects. For example, pharmaco-
logical interventions for major depression often have a delay of 4 weeks before exerting

 significant mood effects over placebo, and may take 12 weeks to achieve full anti-depressant
effects [140–143]. Aerobic exercise for major depression may have a delay of at least 4 weeks
before exerting significant mood effects over a comparator, and may take 16 weeks to achieve
full anti-depressant effects [144–147].
Thus, to the extent that anti-depressant effects of yoga may involve some of the same mech-
anisms of action as pharmacotherapy or aerobic exercise, it seems consistent that hatha yoga
practice may have taken 8 weeks in this trial to exert mood effects of sufficient magnitude to
differentiate the yoga group from the control group. After controlling for the number of
assigned intervention sessions attended by all randomized participants, those in the yoga
group continued to show greater decline in BDI scores by 8 weeks (p-value = 0.045), adding
support to the possibility of yoga-specific mood benefit. Since maximum anti-depressant bene-
fit from pharmacotherapy or exercise may occur several weeks after intervention-specific
effects first become appreciable, perhaps the same may be true for yoga. Future RCTs of larger
sample size and longer duration may test whether any potential yoga-specific mood effects ini-
tially detected within the intervention period become stronger over time.
Several caveats in the interpretation of our data must be considered. Given our small sam-
ple size and the single time-point at which BDI scores differentiated the two groups, the statis-
tically significant result at 8 weeks has a higher chance of being a spurious finding. For
example, the difference in BDI scores at 8 weeks may not have resulted from any yoga-specific
effects, but instead, from random mood variations in either group that fortuitously coincided
with study hypotheses at the 8-week time-point. Thus, it is critical to undertake replication tri-
als with larger sample sizes to gauge whether any yoga-specific mood effects may be found and
reproduced reliably in studies with greater statistical power. Moreover, replication trials of lon-
ger duration, such as 16 or 24 weeks, can evaluate whether any findings of yoga-specific mood
benefit persist reliably beyond just one or two measurement points. In sum, results from this
trial must be viewed with caution as early, exploratory data that may support further investiga-
tion of hatha yoga in major depression, but do not offer any conclusions on its mood effects.
Interpreting completers analyses of depression severity
Over the 8-week trial, study completers in the yoga group appeared to show greater decline in
BDI scores than those in the control group (p-value = 0.014), underscoring the same group-
by-time interaction observed in the full, intent-to-treat sample (p-value = 0.034). In addition,
completers in the yoga group appeared to have a relatively high remission rate of 60%. How-
ever, BDI scores in completers, just as in the full sample, did not differentiate the two groups
until the 8-week time-point, and the sample size of completers (n = 25) was even smaller than
the full sample (n = 38). Results from the completers’ analyses are subject to the same caveats
mentioned above regarding interpretation of outcomes in trials of small sample size. These
pilot findings are preliminary and non-conclusive, but may serve as the basis for further inves-
tigation of this hatha yoga intervention for depression.
Mechanisms for anti-depressant effects of yoga
The hatha yoga intervention in this study may be conceptualized as having several potential
therapeutic elements—such as the basic physical activity in assuming yoga poses, the mindful
way of approaching exercises with a non-judgmental attitude of observing and working with
one’s limitations, the regulation of breath in specific patterns to promote alert calmness, and
the deep relaxation and detachment from mental and physical activity in the final resting pose.
Each of these yoga elements may comprise an “active ingredient” having its own anti-depres-
sant mechanism(s) of action, triggering mood effects that may be additive or perhaps even
Treating major depression with yoga

March 16, 2017
22 / 36
 synergistic in relation to effects of another active ingredient. If so, the integrated practice of
several yoga elements may produce more mood benefit than any one element practiced alone.
This hypothesis appears to have preliminary support from one meta-analysis [66] that exam-
ined RCTs of yoga for prenatal depression; “integrated yoga” interventions that combined
yoga poses with breathing exercises, meditation or relaxation were found to be more effective
in reducing depression severity than yoga poses alone. More studies are needed to clarify
mood efficacy of different yoga elements, and optimal combination of elements to reduce
depression.
Several mechanisms of action, both biological and psychological, have been hypothesized to
underlie the anti-depressant effects of yoga practices. These effects may encompass acute, tran-
sient responses that occur during or immediately after a yoga session, as well as longer-term
adaptive responses following yoga practice for several months or more. Biological mechanisms
may include [64,82,148–155] down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
sympathetic nervous system, increase in vagal tone with activation of the parasympathetic ner-
vous system, increase in central nervous system neurotransmitters such as serotonin and
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), increase in brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF),
promotion of cerebral alpha wave activity, and increase in telomerase activity with mitigation
of depression-related cellular decline. Several psychological mechanisms have also been pro-
posed. To the extent that yoga may offer experiences of mastery and self-acceptance, feelings
of self-efficacy and self-esteem may increase [102–107] and mediate recovery from depression
[108–113]. Mindfulness aspects of yoga may reduce negative ruminations in depression
[87,156], leading to reduced feelings of distress [157–159]. Moreover, the decision to learn
yoga may facilitate behavioral activation, a psychological mechanism by which lifestyle choices
that disrupt depressive routines and lead to increased social connection or other experiences
of reward become positively reinforced, thereby mediating additional adaptive behavioral
change with further mood benefit [160–162]. Despite plausible support for several hypotheses,
much more investigation is required on how yoga may exert mood effects.
Study limitations and strategies for improvement
Several limitations of this study warrant further discussion. First, within the resource con-
straints of a pilot investigation, only a small sample size was feasible. While our study had statis-
tically significant findings and raised the possibility of yoga-specific mood benefits, no reliable
conclusions about mood effects of yoga can be drawn from such a small sample. As Button et al
[163] emphasize, “a study with low statistical power. . .reduces the likelihood that a statistically
significant result reflects a true effect.” Thus, replication studies with larger sample sizes are crit-
ical to further evaluating any potential mood effects of this hatha yoga intervention.
A second limitation was the difficulty in estimating a minimum effective “dose” of hatha
yoga to produce mood effects. Yoga completers in this trial achieved a mean adherence rate of
74% to the prescribed dose of 90 minutes of yoga practice twice weekly for 8 weeks, and this
intensity of practice may have produced sufficient yoga-specific mood benefit by 8 weeks to
differentiate BDI scores in the two groups. However, in prior RCTs of yoga mono-therapy for
major depression [70–72], yoga-specific mood benefit appeared to emerge in just 4 weeks—
perhaps because yoga sessions were assigned on a daily or near-daily basis and conducted in
residential or inpatient settings with nearly 100% participant adherence. If yoga-specific mood
benefits of this hatha yoga sequence are confirmed in future RCTs, next steps might be to test
whether increased practice intensity and/or increased adherence promote earlier manifesta-
tion of mood effects. One method to increase practice frequency (and perhaps enhance adher-
ence) would be to augment on-site group practice with home practice, using instructional

 DVDs or online sessions. A trial period of 24 weeks would clarify longer-term impact on
mood outcomes.
A third limitation related to the timing of outcome measures. Except for baseline measures,
outcome measures were obtained from each participant immediately after he or she finished
certain designated intervention sessions. While this measured the participant’s mood, self-effi-
cacy, or self-esteem just after the completed session, it is unknown whether similar responses
would have been obtained if outcome measures were done a few hours or few days later. Thus,
any potential yoga-specific mood changes detected in our trial may have reflected acute effects
of yoga practice that may or may not have any lasting impact. In future, this limitation might
be addressed via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) technology—specifically, smart-
phone apps designed for frequent self-monitoring of psychological symptoms [164,165]. Tra-
ditional psychometric instruments like the BDI are not designed to measure daily mood
fluctuations and are used no more than once weekly. In contrast, EMA technology allows
research participants to self-assess mood at several specified intervals throughout the day,
transmitting real-time outcome data that appears well-correlated with traditional psychomet-
ric scales [166–169]. In future trials, use of EMA apps, along with traditional scales like the
BDI, would provide more comprehensive assessment of intervention effects from end of one
session to start of the next. After trial completion, additional outcome data might be obtained
from participants at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year to evaluate any longer-term effects.
Finally, another limitation of this trial was that neither participants nor intervention pro-
viders could be blinded to allocation, thereby increasing risk of performance bias. To mitigate
this risk, the PI took steps (described in the Methods section) to cultivate some expectation of
benefit toward both interventions, and these efforts seemed to have some success. As per time-
plots in Fig 2, BDI scores in the control group appeared to match those in the yoga group quite
closely for the first 6 weeks, which is unlikely to have occurred unless control participants were
engaged by some expectation of benefit. Among participants (n = 30) attending at least the
first allocated intervention session, education modules appeared on par with yoga in keeping
participants engaged until study completion, per equivalent retention rates of 83%. Neverthe-
less, some residual performance bias in the two groups may have existed. Overall rates of reten-
tion and adherence in the two groups were statistically comparable, but the trend toward
lower retention and adherence in the control group may have reflected expectations of lesser
benefit. In particular, negative expectation very likely influenced the 6 of 18 control group par-
ticipants who dropped out of the study at a very early stage, before attending even the first
assigned session; this early dropout accounted for half of all attrition in the study.
We hypothesize that participants were most vulnerable to expectation-related dropout
immediately after learning of their allocation to the control group. Their initial commitment
to the study may have been diminished by disappointment or frustration about needing to
wait several weeks before learning yoga practices, and doubts regarding the benefit of the edu-
cation modules may have become heightened and influenced dropout. Assuming this hypothe-
sis is correct, then in future, one way to mitigate early dropout and improve retention rate in
the control group might be to delay disclosure of allocation until participants attend the first
assigned session. In this way, even if participants are disappointed about allocation to the con-
trol group, immediate exposure to yoga-related content of the educational modules might
counter negative expectations and encourage them to stay engaged in the study, as suggested
by the 83% retention rate in this trial among all participants attending the first allocated inter-
vention session. To obtain outcome data less affected by possible performance bias of partici-
pants, future trials might include a (blinded) clinician-administered depression measure, such
as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [170], along with the participant-
administered BDI.

 Interestingly, several participants in the yoga group, on study completion, wanted the
option to attend education modules, just as they knew participants allocated to education
modules could opt for yoga classes afterwards. Participants who completed the education
modules and subsequently took free yoga classes perceived benefit from both interventions,
mentioning a helpful “synergy” in learning the philosophy of yoga as well as its practice.
Clearly, the suggestion given to all participants at screening—that information about yoga
history and philosophy might enhance later practice of hatha yoga exercises—succeeded, to
some extent, in cultivating an expectation of benefit toward the control intervention. There-
fore, in a future trial, we hypothesize that a crossover design may allow the expectation of
benefit toward the education modules to have a more positive impact on adherence. More so
than a parallel group design, a crossover design may implicitly convey to participants that
both interventions may have substantive mood benefits, since both would be studied for-
mally in every participant. This implicit message might mitigate early dropout and improve
adherence in the control group.
Future directions
Data from early RCTs have suggested potential mood benefits of yoga for a range of depres-
sive symptoms. While these data constitute a promising evidence base from which to con-
sider further investigation, there is insufficient evidence, as yet, to advocate yoga as a first-
line treatment in any diagnosed depressive disorder. In order to advance the possibility of
yoga as a therapeutic option for major depression, it is essential to undertake carefully
designed studies that address methodological limitations in previous trials, and that replicate
and build on earlier findings. Future studies must refine our understanding of the control
interventions most suitable for ascertaining yoga-specific mood effects. Recruited partici-
pants must have well-defined depression symptomatology, so as to identify those with symp-
toms most amenable to yoga-based therapies. For example, a recent meta-analysis suggests
that mood benefit of meditation may be greater in individuals with an acute episode of major
depression, rather than chronic residual symptoms [119]. It also remains to be established
whether acute mood effects of yoga suggested by short-term RCTs, such as this pilot trial,
can be maintained in the longer term; thus far, one RCT [89] has provided follow-up data
suggesting that a yoga intervention which acutely decreased depressive ruminations may
continue to exert effects one year later.
Several populations may be particularly well served by increased research on yoga as a
non-pharmacological therapeutic option for major depression. These populations include
peri-partum women, adolescents, medically frail seniors, and those with medication
sensitivities. While investigation of yoga has increased in peri-partum women with
depression [81,83–85,93], research has been minimal in the other populations mentioned
above.
Eventually, it would be helpful to ascertain comparative efficacy of yoga therapies in rela-
tion to conventional care. Perhaps most intriguing would be a direct comparison of yoga
mono-therapy with conventional antidepressant medication in the treatment of acute major
depression; to date, there has been only one such trial [71], and while it suggested that yoga
mono-therapy may be comparable to imipramine pharmacotherapy, additional RCTs must
be conducted to replicate findings. Also important is continued investigation of yoga as an
adjunct to conventional care, bearing in mind that two disparate therapeutic modalities may
not always be compatible, and that effects may not always be additive or synergistic. Thus far,
mixed results have emerged from the few RCTs that examined yoga as an adjunct therapy to
antidepressant medication for major depression [69,74,90].

 As the biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mood effects of specific yoga
practices are better understood, this may enable development of more “targeted” yoga thera-
pies optimized for individuals with specific clinical presentations of major depression. For
example, yoga relaxation/meditation practices that promote down-regulation of the sympa-
thetic nervous system may prove particularly beneficial to individuals with features of anxious
major depression—such as motor restlessness, insomnia, and nervous ruminations. In con-
trast, the vigorous practice of yoga postures and breathing techniques that increase cardiovas-
cular and metabolic activity may prove more efficacious in individuals with melancholic
features of major depression—such as excessive hopelessness, cognitive slowing, and loss of
emotional reactivity. Moreover, as the neurobiology of major depression becomes better char-
acterized, this may lead to enhanced ability to match treatment modality to individuals who
are likely to experience benefit from that modality [171,172]. For example, very interesting
early data [173] suggest that biomarkers may predict anti-depressant response to psychother-
apy versus pharmacotherapy in individuals with major depression. Neuroimaging scans may
predict an individual’s non-response to anti-depressant treatment with either psychotherapy
or pharmacotherapy [174], raising the intriguing possibility that such individuals may be bet-
ter suited for non-conventional therapeutic modalities, such as yoga. In any case, it is impor-
tant to account for personal treatment preferences, as individuals with major depression may
experience higher recovery rates when using therapies aligned with their personal health
beliefs and expectations [175–178].
Major depression is a complex disorder, with etiology and manifestation influenced by
multiple factors, including genetic vulnerability, nature of stressors, sources of support, and
learned coping strategies. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any single therapeutic modality
will work uniformly well in all individuals with major depression. The goal in developing
novel interventions, such as yoga, is not to replace existing conventional care that may be
highly effective for some individuals, but to expand therapeutic options so that more people
may benefit from treatment.
Conclusions
This project was inspired by the need for rigorous evaluation of hatha yoga as a potential
mono-therapy for individuals with mild-to-moderate major depression, a population for
whom conventional care may offer uncertain benefit. With the rising popularity of yoga in
western countries, yoga-based interventions with proven efficacy in major depression may
provide a treatment option that is cost-effective, widely accessible, associated with high social
acceptance, and has a favorable risk-benefit profile. This pilot trial suggests that in adults with
major depression of mild-to-moderate severity, participation in an 8-week hatha yoga pro-
gram may result in statistically and clinically significant reductions in acute depression sever-
ity. Feasibility and efficacy data from this pilot study provide support for a full-scale RCT of
hatha yoga as mono-therapy for mild-to-moderate major depression in a non-hospitalized,
metropolitan U.S. population sample. If anti-depressant efficacy of hatha yoga were validated
in larger scale RCTs, this would be of enormous relevance to public health.
