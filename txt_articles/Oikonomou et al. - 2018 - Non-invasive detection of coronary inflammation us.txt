Summary
Background Coronary artery inflammation inhibits adipogenesis in adjacent perivascular fat. A novel imaging 
biomarker—the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI)—captures coronary inflammation by mapping spatial 
changes of perivascular fat attenuation on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). However, the ability 
of the perivascular FAI to predict clinical outcomes is unknown.
Methods In the Cardiovascular RISk Prediction using Computed Tomography (CRISP-CT) study, we did a post-hoc 
analysis of outcome data gathered prospectively from two independent cohorts of consecutive patients undergoing 
coronary CTA in Erlangen, Germany (derivation cohort) and Cleveland, OH, USA (validation cohort). Perivascular fat 
attenuation mapping was done around the three major coronary arteries—the proximal right coronary artery, the left 
anterior descending artery, and the left circumflex artery. We assessed the prognostic value of perivascular fat 
attenuation mapping for all-cause and cardiac mortality in Cox regression models, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular 
risk factors, tube voltage, modified Duke coronary artery disease index, and number of coronary CTA-derived high-
risk plaque features.
Findings Between 2005 and 2009, 1872 participants in the derivation cohort underwent coronary CTA (median age 
62 years [range 17–89]). Between 2008 and 2016, 2040 patients in the validation cohort had coronary CTA (median 
age 53 years [range 19–87]). Median follow-up was 72 months (range 51–109) in the derivation cohort and 54 months 
(range 4–105) in the validation cohort. In both cohorts, high perivascular FAI values around the proximal right 
coronary artery and left anterior descending artery (but not around the left circumflex artery) were predictive of 
all-cause and cardiac mortality and correlated strongly with each other. Therefore, the perivascular FAI measured 
around the right coronary artery was used as a representative biomarker of global coronary inflammation (for 
prediction of cardiac mortality, hazard ratio [HR] 2·15, 95% CI 1·33–3·48; p=0·0017 in the derivation cohort, and 
2·06, 1·50–2·83; p<0·0001 in the validation cohort). The optimum cutoff for the perivascular FAI, above which there 
is a steep increase in cardiac mortality, was ascertained as –70·1 Hounsfield units (HU) or higher in the derivation 
cohort (HR 9·04, 95% CI 3·35–24·40; p<0·0001 for cardiac mortality; 2·55, 1·65–3·92; p<0·0001 for all-cause 
mortality). This cutoff was confirmed in the validation cohort (HR 5·62, 95% CI 2·90–10·88; p<0·0001 for cardiac 
mortality; 3·69, 2·26–6·02; p<0·0001 for all-cause mortality). Perivascular FAI improved risk discrimination in both 
cohorts, leading to significant reclassification for all-cause and cardiac mortality.
Interpretation The perivascular FAI enhances cardiac risk prediction and restratification over and above current state-
of-the-art assessment in coronary CTA by providing a quantitative measure of coronary inflammation. High 
perivascular FAI values (cutoff ≥–70·1 HU) are an indicator of increased cardiac mortality and, therefore, could guide 
early targeted primary prevention and intensive secondary prevention in patients.

Introduction
Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a 
sensitive and widely used non-invasive imaging modality 
for diagnosing coronary artery disease;1,2 it is also 
used for diagnosis and management of chest pain.3 
However, coronary CTA focuses predominantly on 
identification of anatomically significant coronary artery 
stenosis, which is seen in fewer than 50% of patients 
referred for this test.1,2 Importantly, most acute coronary 
syndromes are caused by unstable but non-obstructive

atherosclerotic plaques,4 which cannot be identified by 
current non-invasive diagnostic tests detecting coronary 
luminal stenosis or stress-induced myocardial ischae-
mia.5,6 Vascular inflammation is a driver of coronary 
atherosclerotic plaque formation and is a typical feature 
of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, leading to acute 
coronary syndrome.7 Currently, no method is readily 
available to allow early detection of vascular inflammation 
in coronary arteries. Such a method would enable timely 
deployment of measures to prevent disease development 
and future heart attacks.
Signals released from the inflamed coronary artery 
diffuse to the perivascular adipose tissue, inhibiting local 
adipo 
genesis.8 This changes the composition of perivascular 
fat around inflamed arteries, shifting its attenuation on 
coronary CTA from the lipid (more negative Hounsfield 
unit [HU] values [eg, closer to –190 HU]) to the aqueous 
phase (less negative HU values [eg, closer to –30 HU]).8 We 
have developed an imaging biomarker, the perivascular fat 
attenuation index (FAI), that captures these inflammation-
induced changes in perivascular fat attenuation, enabling 
early detection of coronary inflammation using routine 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase for 
studies published before December, 2017, with the terms: 
(“epicardial adipose tissue”, “epicardial fat”, “subepicardial 
adipose tissue”, “subepicardial fat”, “cardiac adipose tissue”, 
“cardiac fat”, “pericoronary adipose tissue”, “pericoronary fat”, 
OR “perivascular fat”) AND (“coronary artery disease”, 
“coronary artery calcification”, “coronary artery calcium score”, 
“coronary stenosis”, “coronary atherosclerosis”, “myocardial 
ischemia”, “myocardial perfusion defects”, “acute coronary 
syndrome”, “major adverse cardiovascular events”, OR 
“cardiovascular disease”) AND (“computed tomography”, 
“radiodensity”, “density”, OR “attenuation”). We restricted our 
search to studies published in English. Of 910 articles 
retrieved, we identified no cohort studies investigating the 
prognostic value of perivascular fat attenuation phenotyping 
on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). 
Perivascular fat attenuation was first described in translational 
work, in which mechanistic proof-of-concept studies validated 
the hypothesis that coronary inflammation results in impaired 
lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation in adjacent 
perivascular fat. As a result, perivascular fat reduces its lipid 
content in response to inflammatory signals it receives from 
the adjacent coronary artery and provides a so-called sensor of 
coronary inflammation. We developed an imaging 
biomarker—the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI)—to 
visualise and quantify these changes in perivascular fat, by 
mapping spatial changes in perivascular fat attenuation using 
routine coronary CTA. Clinical studies also showed a 
significant association between coronary artery disease and 
higher perivascular FAI values, and dynamic changes of the 
perivascular FAI around culprit—but not stable—lesions in 
patients with acute coronary syndromes. Cross-sectional 
observational studies have also confirmed that high 
perivascular fat attenuation is linked to the presence of 
coronary atherosclerotic plaques—validated against 
intravascular ultrasound—and ruptured coronary lesions in 
acute myocardial infarction and spontaneous coronary artery 
dissection. Nevertheless, the added prognostic value of 
perivascular fat attenuation phenotyping in real-life 
cohorts of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary CTA 
remains unknown.
Added value of this study
Our study is the first to show the independent and incremental 
value of quantifying the perivascular FAI in real-life cohorts of 
patients undergoing diagnostic coronary CTA. High perivascular 
FAI values around the right coronary artery identified individuals 
at risk for all-cause and cardiac mortality, over and above 
established cardiovascular risk factors and current 
state-of-the-art coronary CTA interpretation methods, including 
coronary calcium, coronary artery disease extent, and high-risk 
plaque features. We used two independent and substantially 
different cohorts to identify and validate a perivascular FAI cutoff 
of –70·1 Hounsfield units or higher, which flags high-risk 
individuals with a fivefold to ninefold higher adjusted risk for 
cardiac death. These associations remained robust after 
appropriate sensitivity and subgroup analyses, according to 
presence or extent of disease and treatment after coronary CTA. 
Most importantly, the perivascular FAI significantly improved 
mortality risk discrimination and reclassification in both study 
populations beyond current prognostic risk models.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study validates the prognostic role of the perivascular FAI, 
the first non-invasive biomarker of coronary inflammation 
measured by traditional coronary CTA, over and above the 
presence of anatomically significant coronary stenosis or 
calcification. Most coronary CTA scans done worldwide do not 
record any relevant coronary atherosclerosis, yet half of heart 
attacks happen without substantial coronary stenosis (because of 
rupture of minor but highly inflamed or unstable atherosclerotic 
plaques). The perivascular FAI identifies these individuals and 
might guide early deployment of targeted intensive measures of 
primary prevention. Since the perivascular FAI also identifies 
vulnerable plaques in patients with established coronary 
atherosclerosis (despite optimum treatment), this biomarker 
could guide targeted deployment of intensive (and typically 
expensive) measures of secondary prevention. For example, 
patients with known coronary artery disease already receiving 
optimum treatment (eg, antiplatelet and statin therapy) who 
present with abnormally high perivascular fat attenuation could 
be candidates for treatment with new anti-inflammatory agents 
(eg, canakinumab) or PCSK9 inhibitors to target their residual 
cardiovascular and inflammatory risk.

coronary CTA.8 Although the perivascular FAI has shown 
the ability to detect coronary inflammation, its importance 
for clinical risk stratification is so far unknown.
We postulated that by quantifying coronary artery 
inflammation, the perivascular FAI could predict future 
adverse events, independent of the degree of coronary 
stenosis or other factors included in modern risk 
stratification of individuals undergoing coronary CTA, 
thus identifying high-risk patients who might benefit 
from more intensive therapeutic strategies.
Methods
Study design and participants
In the Cardiovascular RISk Prediction using Computed 
Tomography (CRISP-CT) study, we did a post-hoc 
analysis of outcome data gathered prospectively from 
two independent cohorts. The first cohort (derivation 
cohort) consisted of consecutive patients who underwent 
clinically indicated coronary CTA at Erlangen University 
Hospital, Erlangen, Germany. A subgroup of patients 
underwent further non-contrast cardiac CT to assess the 
extent of coronary calcification by the Agatston coronary 
calcium score (CCS), in line with local clinical practice.9–12 
The second cohort (validation cohort) consisted of 
consecutive patients who underwent coronary CTA at 
Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. To create a study 
population reflective of the real-life patient population 
undergoing diagnostic coronary CTA, we included all 
consecutive patients (aged 16 years or older) in the study, 
unless they were referred specifically for assessment of 
congenital heart disease.
The research protocol was approved by all local 
institutional review boards, including material and data 
sharing agreements, with waiver of individual informed 
consent.
Procedures
The primary objective was to assess the predictive value 
of the perivascular FAI for the two primary endpoints of 
all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality. Details of 
clinical data collection, definition of risk factors and 
study endpoints, event adjudication, and data analysis 
are in the appendix.
Indications for coronary CTA and presenting symptoms 
are summarised in the appendix. In both the derivation 
and validation cohorts, most patients had a low-to-mid 
pretest probability of coronary artery disease (median 
30·4% [IQR 15·4–50·4] in the derivation cohort vs 21·5% 
[9·3–38·7] in the validation cohort; p<0·0001). Coronary 
CTA protocols and image analysis methods are described 
in the appendix.
All images were anonymised locally and transferred to 
a core laboratory (Academic Cardiovascular CT Unit, 
University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) for analysis on a dedi-
cated workstation (Aquarius Workstation version 4.4.11-13; 
TeraRecon, Foster City, CA, USA) by investigators who 
were unaware of population demographics and outcomes. 
All scans were reviewed initially for quality and pres-
ence of artifacts precluding a reliable qualitative and 
quantitative evaluation. Low-quality scans were reviewed 
by at least two independent investigators before being 
excluded from subsequent analysis. We defined mild, 
moderate, and severe coronary stenoses as luminal sten-
osis of 25–49%, 50–69%, and 70% or larger, respectively.13 
We defined obstructive coronary artery disease as the 
presence of one or more coronary lesions causing luminal 
stenosis of 50% or larger, and we assessed the extent of 
coronary artery disease using the modified Duke coron-
ary artery disease index.14 We defined high-risk plaque 
features (spotty calcification, low-attenuation plaque, 
positive remodelling, and napkin-ring sign) as described 
previously (appendix).15 We measured the total epicardial 
adipose tissue volume in a semi-automated manner by 
tracking the contour of the pericardium from the level 
of the pulmonary artery bifurcation to the apex of the 
heart at the most caudal end.
To measure the perivascular FAI, we traced the proximal 
40-mm segments of all three major epicardial coronary 
vessels (right coronary artery, left anterior descending 
artery, and left circumflex artery) and defined respective 
perivascular fat as the adipose tissue within a radial 
distance from the outer vessel wall equal to the diameter 
of the vessel, as described and validated previously.8 To 
avoid the effects of the aortic wall, we excluded the most 
proximal 10 mm of the right coronary artery and analysed 
the proximal 10–50 mm of the vessel, as described 
previously.8 In the left anterior descending artery and left 
circumflex artery, we analysed the proximal 40 mm of each 
vessel. We did not analyse the left main coronary artery 
because it is of variable length. We ascertained the 
perivascular FAI by quantifying the weighted perivascular 
fat attenuation after adjustment for technical parameters, 
based on the attenuation histogram of perivascular fat 
within the range –190 HU to –30 HU, as described 
previously (appendix).8 Similar to findings of previous 
validation studies,8 technical (tube voltage, lumen attenu-
ation) and anatomical (vessel diameter) parameters were 
all associated weakly with perivascular fat attenuation, 
accounting for roughly 5% of its variation (R²=0·05, 
p<0·0001 in a multivariable model [appendix]). Intra-
observer and interobserver agreement for the perivascular 
FAI was very good (intraclass correlation coefficient 0·987 
[p<0·0001] and 0·980 [p<0·0001], respectively).
Statistical analysis
We present continuous variables as mean (SD) or median 
(range), as appropriate. We compared categorical 
variables between two or more groups with the χ² test, 
and we compared continuous variables between groups 
with either Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test (for 
two groups, as appropriate) or by ANOVA (for three 
groups). We tested correlations between continuous 
variables with either Pearson’s r (including the coefficient 
of determi 
nation R²) or Spearman’s rank correlation

coefficient, as appropriate. We tested the association 
between the perivascular FAI and technical or anatomical 
variables in multivariable linear regression models. If 
information for categorical risk factors was missing, 
we created a third group (yes, no, unknown [maxi-
mum degree of missingness 13·9%]). We assessed the 
prognostic value of the perivascular FAI for all-cause, 
cardiac, or non-cardiac mortality using multivariable Cox 
regression models, and we plotted unadjusted Kaplan-
Meier curves. We log-transformed CCS before inclusion 
in regression models (ln[CCS + 1]). We used fractional 
polynomials to model non-linear relations of the 
perivascular FAI with time-to-mortality in Cox regression 
models, and we present graphically the best-fitting 
fractional polynomial models. We selected the optimum 
cutoff for the perivascular FAI by identifying the value 
that maximised Youden’s J statistic (sum of sensitivity 
and specificity) on time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for cardiac mortality 
to ensure an optimum balance between sensitivity and 
specificity in our models. We then tested the prognostic 
value of the perivascular FAI (as a dichotomous variable) 
by multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjust-
ment for age, sex, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 
diabetes mellitus, smoking, epicardial obesity (measured 
as total epicardial adipose tissue volume), tube voltage, 
modified Duke coronary artery disease index, and 
number of high-risk plaque features. By adding the 
perivascular FAI in a baseline model consisting of 
traditional risk factors, we assessed the improvement 
in model performance and discrimi 
nation and risk 
classification by (1) comparing the C statistic (area under 
the curve [AUC]) of the two nested models (from time-
dependent ROC analysis), (2) doing a likelihood ratio 
test (in Cox regression models), and (3) calculating the 
integrated discrimination improve 
ment (IDI) and net 
reclassification improvement (NRI) indices for censored 
data. We used bootstrapping with 200 replications to 
calculate 95% CIs for AUC, NRI, and IDI.16 All models 
were independently tested in the two cohorts of the study. 
We assessed heterogeneity in further subgroup analyses 
with the I² statistic. We assessed the performance of 
the perivascular FAI for both primary and secondary 
prevention in subgroup analyses done according to the 
extent of coronary calcification (measured as CCS on 
non-contrast CT scans in the derivation cohort only),11,17 
presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, the 
extent of coronary artery disease (assessed by the 
modified Duke coronary artery disease index),14 and 
presence of high-risk plaque features on coronary CTA.15
We did statistical analyses with Stata version 14.0 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and R version 3.4.0 
(survival, survIDINRI, timeROC, survminer, and nricens). 
All tests were two-sided and α was set at 0·05.

Results
Between 2005 and 2009, 1993 consecutive patients were 
enrolled to the Erlangen study (derivation cohort) and 
underwent coronary CTA. 121 scans (6%) were excluded 
from the analysis because of technical considerations 
(appendix), therefore 1872 patients contributed outcome 
data to our study (table 1). 1178 (63%) participants in the 
derivation cohort were men and the median age of all 
patients was 62 years (range 17–89). Median follow-up 
after coronary CTA was 72 months (range 51–109) in 
the derivation cohort. 1415 patients also underwent 
non-contrast cardiac CTA to assess coronary calcification.
Between 2008 and 2016, 2246 consecutive patients were 
enrolled to the Cleveland study (validation cohort) and 
underwent coronary CTA. 206 (9%) scans were excluded 
from the analysis; therefore, 2040 patients contributed 
outcome data to this study (table 1). 1126 (55%) partici-
pants were men, and the median age of all patients in the 
validation cohort was 53 years (range 19–87). Median 
follow-up was 54 months (range 4–105).
Coronary CTA findings are presented in the appendix. 
During follow-up of the derivation cohort there were 
26 confirmed cardiac deaths, 72 confirmed non-cardiac 
deaths, and 16 deaths from an unknown cause. In the 
validation cohort, 48 deaths were classified as cardiac, 
35 as non-cardiac, and two as of unknown cause (table 1).
Perivascular fat attenuation measured around the 
proximal right coronary artery was associated strongly 
with perivascular fat attenuation measured around the 
proximal left anterior descending artery and left circumflex 
artery (appendix). In both cohorts, high FAI values in the 
perivascular fat of all three coronary vessels were 
associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of all-
cause mortality (table 2). However, high FAI values in the 
perivascular fat were only associated significantly with 
prospective cardiac mortality risk in the right coronary 
artery and the left anterior descending artery, not in the 
left circumflex artery (figure 1, table 2). In view of the 
statistical collinearity between perivascular FAI measure-
ments around the right coronary artery and the left 
anterior descending artery, the analysis was restricted to 
the proximal right coronary artery.
The perivascular FAI was normally distributed around 
a mean of –75·1 HU (SD 8·6) in the derivation cohort 
and –77·0 HU (SD 8·5) in the validation cohort. It was 
associated with neither coronary calcification (measured 
as CCS) on non-contrast CT (p=0·86) nor local calcium 
burden in the adjacent vascular segment (p=0·18; 
appendix). Adjusted fractional polynomial modelling 
showed a J-shaped relation between the perivascular FAI 
and the prospective risk of all-cause and cardiac mortality 
in both cohorts (appendix). Based on this observation, 
and to generate distinct clinical risk groups, the study 
population was dichotomised into high versus low peri-
vascular fat attenuation groups based on an optimum 
cutoff of –70·1 HU (calculated at median follow-up 
of 72 months [derivation cohort]; specificity 85·0%, 
sensitivity 67·7%, negative predictive value 99·5%, 
positive predictive value 5·9%; appendix). In the same 
cohort, after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, risk 
factors, tube voltage, modified Duke coronary artery 
disease index, and number of high-risk plaque features, 
high perivascular FAI values (≥–70·1 HU vs <–70·1 HU) 
were associated with a higher prospective risk of all-
cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2·55, 95% CI 
1·65–3·92; p<0·0001; figure 2A) and cardiac mortality

(9·04, 3·35–24·40; p<0·0001; figure 2B). High peri- 
vascular FAI values were not associated with non-cardiac 
mortality (adjusted HR 1·66, 95% CI 0·95–2·90; p=0·07). 
In the subgroup of patients in whom the extent of 
coronary calcification was measured with CCS (n=1415 
[76%]), the perivascular FAI retained its predictive value 
for both endpoints after additional adjustment for CCS 
(adjusted HR 2·03, 95% CI 1·17–3·52; p=0·0122 for all-
cause mortality and 12·83, 2·76–59·56; p=0·0011 for 
cardiac mortality). These findings were confirmed in the 
validation cohort (specificity 81·6%, sensitivity 52·9%, 
negative predictive value 98·5%, positive predictive 
value 7·0%). Perivascular FAI values of –70·1 HU or 
higher were associated with increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (adjusted HR 3·69, 95% CI 2·26–6·02; 
p<0·0001; figure 2C) and cardiac mortality (5·62, 
2·90–10·88; p<0·0001; figure 2D).
Inclusion of high perivascular FAI values (≥–70·1 HU) 
significantly improved the discriminatory value of a 
coronary CTA-based risk prediction model that included 
age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, 
hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, smoking, and adipose 
tissue volume), extent of coronary artery disease 
(modified Duke coronary artery disease index), and 
number of high-risk plaque features, for both all-cause 
and cardiac mortality (figure 3; appendix). For cardiac 
mortality, in the derivation cohort, with the addition of 
the perivascular FAI to the risk predication model, 
the AUC increased from 0·913 (95% CI 0·867–0·958) 
to 0·962 (0·940–0·983; ΔAUC=0·049; p=0·0054), and 
in the validation cohort, the AUC increased from 0·763 
(95%

to 
0·838 
(0·764–0·912; 
ΔAUC=0·075; p=0·0069; figure 3). Furthermore, the 
perivascular FAI significantly improved all-cause and 
cardiac mortality risk stratification in both study cohorts, 
contributing to substantial net reclassification improve-
ment (table 3), driven primarily by a significant reduction 
in the estimated risk for non-events, highlighting the 
high specificity and negative predictive value of the 
method and proposed cutoff. Among patients without 
events, the change in estimated risk after perivascular 
FAI-based risk stratification did not differ between 
individuals with coronary artery disease versus those 
without this disease (for all-cause mortality and cardiac

mortality, respectively: derivation cohort, p=0·09 and 
p=0·72; validation cohort, p=0·68 and p=0·40). In the 
subgroup of individuals in the derivation cohort with 
available CCS, the perivascular FAI added significant 
incremental value in risk prediction beyond an enhanced 
model that included CCS in addition to the previously 
mentioned risk factors (for all-cause mortality, χ²=5·95, 
p=0·0147 [likelihood ratio test]; for cardiac mortality, 
χ²=10·71, p=0·0011 [likelihood ratio test]).
In subgroup analyses to assess the performance of the 
perivascular FAI for both primary and secondary 
prevention, the perivascular FAI retained its positive 
association with both all-cause and cardiac mortality in 
all subgroups, with no significant heterogeneity between 
subgroups (figure 4). The validation cohort provided 
information on different ethnic groups and, in a post-hoc 
analysis, the positive association of high perivascular FAI 
values with adverse events was consistent across ethnic 
groups (appendix).
In further subgroup analyses, the association between 
high perivascular FAI values and mortality risk was 
independent of indications for coronary CTA referral, 
presenting symptoms (chest pain; appendix), or recom-
mendations after coronary CTA (appendix). However, 
among individuals who received a recommendation to 
initiate treatment with statins or aspirin after coronary 
CTA, the perivascular FAI (measured before deployment 
of the new treatment) was no longer predictive of cardiac 
mortality (adjusted HR 2·85, 95% CI 0·44–18·49; 
p=0·25). By contrast, among those who did not receive 
any recommendations for change of management after 
coronary CTA, the predictive value of high perivascular 
FAI values for cardiac mortality was retained (adjusted 
HR 18·71, 95% CI 2·01–174·04; p=0·0101), suggesting 
that the risk identified by the perivascular FAI could be 
modifiable with optimum medical therapy.
Availability of information on prospective acute myo-
cardial infarction events in the validation cohort allowed us 
to further test the prognostic role of the perivascular FAI 
for this secondary endpoint in a post-hoc analysis. After 
multivariable adjustment, high perivascular FAI values 
(≥–70·1 HU vs <–70·1 HU) were associated with increased 
risk of acute myocardial infarction (n=23 reported events; 
adjusted HR 5·08, 95% CI 1·89–13·61; p=0·0012; appen-
dix), suggesting a link between abnormal perivascular fat 
attenuation and plaque instability.
Discussion
The findings of our study show that the imaging 
biomarker perivascular FAI predicts all-cause and 
cardiac mortality over and above clinical risk factors and 
the current state-of-the-art interpretation of coronary 
CTA. By quantifying the residual inflammatory risk, the 
peri 
vascular FAI can be used for risk restratification in 
both primary and secondary prevention, dissociating 
risk prediction from the strict anatomical severity of 
coronary stenosis or the degree of myocardial ischaemia. 
These findings are validated in the CRISP-CT study in 
two large and different real-life prospective cohorts of 
patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary CTA in 
Europe and the USA. Integrating the perivascular FAI 
into modern coronary CTA interpretation will facilitate 
identification of individuals at risk of future cardiac 
death, before structural changes of the coronary wall are

visible, and will flag so-called vulnerable patients with 
inflamed coronary atheroma, who might be candidates 
for more intensive treatment.
Current risk stratification relies on traditional clinical 
risk factors, whereas imaging biomarkers such as CCS—
measured using CT—are recommended for individuals 
at low-to-middle risk.18 However, coronary calcification 
represents a non-reversible process that does not regress 
(or might even increase) in response to appropriate 
medical treatment (eg, statins), limiting its value in 
secondary prevention.19 On the other hand, inflammation 
has an important role in both atherogenesis and athero-
sclerotic plaque rupture leading to acute coronary 
syndrome.7,20 Therefore, non-invasive detection of the 
residual inflammatory coronary risk could guide more 
timely deployment of preventive measures in primary 
care.21,22 Moreover, timely detection of inflamed athero-
sclerotic plaques at risk of rupture would guide the 
application 
of 
secondary 
prevention 
measures,20–22 
including novel therapeutic agents that target inflam-
mation.23–25 After the results of the CANTOS trial,24 which 
confirmed the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis, 
a clear unmet need exists to identify patients with 
inflamed coronary arteries. Indeed, no non-invasive 
method is readily available to quantify the inflammatory 
status of coronary vessels or atherosclerotic plaques, and 
measurement of circulating biomarkers—such as high 
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)—is not specific 
for coronary inflammation.26 Detection of coronary 
micro 
calcification and inflammation using PET-CT is 
promising27 but is currently limited by clinical availability, 
and the prognostic value of this method has not been 
validated in large cohorts.28
Coronary inflammation has been shown to inhibit 
adipogenesis in perivascular fat,8 generating a concentric 
gradient of adipocyte lipid content around the inflamed 
coronary artery, with smaller, undifferentiated, and lipid-
poor adipocytes closer to the vascular wall. The imaging 
biomarker under study here (the perivascular FAI) 
was derived from analysis of standard images obtained 
by coronary CTA and tracks changes in adipocyte 
lipid content by mapping the three-dimensional adipose 
tissue attenuation changes in the perivascular space 
in a standardised and operator-independent way.8 The 
perivascular FAI changes dynamically in response to 
local plaque rupture in patients with acute coronary 
syndrome, and can be used as a so-called thermometer 
to distinguish potential culprit from non-culprit lesions.8

The information captured by the perivascular FAI 
is independent of coronary calcification (measured by 
CCS)8 or systemic markers of inflammation, such as 
hsCRP (ρ=–0·11, p=0·25, in an independent cohort 
of 107 individuals [unpublished data]). Our original 
findings8 have been supported by other studies linking 
high perivascular fat attenuation with the presence 
of stable coronary artery disease,29 coronary plaque 
rupture,30,31 and spontaneous coronary artery dissection.31 
However, the value of the perivascular FAI in identifying 
residual inflammatory risk and predicting cardiac 
mortality is unknown.
In UK clinical guidelines for management of chest 
pain,3 coronary CTA is recommended as a first-line 
diagnostic test for assessment of stable coronary artery 
disease, typical and atypical angina, and non-anginal 
chest pain with ECG changes. With the implementation 
of these guidelines, the number of coronary CTA scans 
undertaken annually in the UK alone could exceed 
350 000,32 with more than 90% excluding obstructive 
disease. In the presence of athero 
sclerotic plaques, 
coronary CTA identifies specific high-risk plaque 
features,15,33 but the current interpretation lacks the ability 
to detect small but vulnerable plaques with potential to 
either rupture or rapidly progress to obstructive disease.4 
Indeed, evidence suggests that half of acute coronary 
syndrome events happen without anatomically significant 
coronary atherosclerosis,4 due to rupture of minor but 
inflamed atherosclerotic plaques.
In our study, we quantified the perivascular FAI in 
baseline coronary CTA scans from two independent 
and substantially different prospective cohorts who 
underwent clinical coronary CTA in Erlangen, Germany 
(derivation cohort) and Cleveland, OH, USA (validation 
cohort) and who were followed up for a median of 6 years 
and 4·5 years, respectively. The clinical indication for 
coronary CTA was based on local clinical practice, which 
varied between the two cohorts, as shown by the 
significantly different clinical and medication profile of 
the two populations. This diversity provided the 
opportunity to measure perivascular fat attenuation in 
patients with a broad range of cardiovascular risk factors 
and extent of coronary artery disease, scanned using 
various hardware and during different periods. Traditional 
risk factors were less effective at predicting risk of 
mortality in the validation cohort versus the derivation 
cohort, possibly because of more aggressive pharmaco-
logical management of risk factors in the validation 
cohort. Despite these differences, we showed that a cutoff 
for the perivascular FAI of –70·1 HU or higher is a strong 
predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in 
both cohorts, over and above clinical risk factors, extent of 
coronary artery disease, number of high-risk plaque 
features, epicardial adipose tissue volume, and coronary 
calcification (measured by CCS).10–12 The perivascular FAI 
also worked well for risk stratification in individuals with 
low or high CCS, independently of the presence of 
coronary artery disease. Individuals without coronary 
artery disease, who comprise most individuals under-
going clinical coronary CTA worldwide, could benefit 
from early targeted deployment of more aggressive 
measures of primary prevention. Indeed, we present 
evidence that the residual inflammatory risk identified by 
the perivascular FAI might be modifiable by intensive 
medical treatment, calling for future randomised 
clinical trials to record this initial observation. Finally, by 
identifying patients with coronary artery disease who still 
have unstable atherosclerotic plaques despite optimum 
treatment, the perivascular FAI can guide future clinical 
trials assessing targeted treatments with modern anti-
inflammatory agents, making their use affordable in 
modern health-care systems. A clear unmet need also 
exists to identify patients who remain at risk after acute 
coronary syndrome, despite standard treatment. Future 
clinical trials will show whether the perivascular FAI is 
the long-awaited biomarker that will guide personalised 
medicine in these patients.
Our study has some limitations. First, the fairly low 
number of fatal events reported in our study could 
diminish statistical power for some subgroup analyses, 
but effect sizes on the primary endpoints were large, 
which might overcome this shortcoming. Second, 
although the spatial resolution of CT on a 128-slice 
scanner could get to a theoretical voxel size of 0·35 mm², 
this possibility is limited by coronary artery motion.34 
However, perivascular fat was defined as fat within a 
radial distance equal to the diameter of the vessel (based 
on previous histological and biological observations),8 
which exceeds the spatial resolution of coronary CTA, 
allowing for a valid assessment of the perivascular space. 
Third, although our study findings support the use of the 
perivascular FAI in symptomatic cohorts, its value in 
asymptomatic cohorts remains unclear. Therefore, the 
perivascular FAI is not intended to generate new 
indications for coronary CTA but is proposed as an 
additional readout in standard coronary CTA done under 
the current clinical indications. Finally, the goal of our 
study was to investigate the value of the perivascular FAI 
around standardised coronary segments as a marker of 
global residual cardiac risk, and future studies will be 
needed to assess the prognostic value of lesion-guided 
perivascular fat attenuation. In this regard, the non-
significant association of the perivascular FAI around the 
left circumflex artery with cardiac mortality could reflect 
the predominant localisation of culprit coronary lesions 
in the right coronary artery and left anterior descending 
artery.35 Integration of this method in future clinical trials 
or application in clinical practice will require development 
of infrastructure to deliver the perivascular FAI analysis 
on-site or off-site. 
We have shown that the perivascular FAI—a previously 
validated imaging biomarker of coronary inflammation 
derived from routine coronary CTA8—when measured 
around the right coronary artery predicts all-cause and

cardiac mortality over and above current risk stratifica-
tion approaches, including measurement of coronary cal-
cium and state-of-the-art assessment of coronary CTA. 
Integration of the perivascular FAI into standard clinical 
coronary CTA reporting has the potential to advance this 
imaging technique from a method that is used to exclude 
anatomical coronary artery disease into a dynamic 
cardiac risk-stratification tool, applicable even without 
coronary plaques or substantial calcification.
