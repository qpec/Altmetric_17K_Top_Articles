We conducted an external quality assessment of Zika virus 
molecular diagnostic tests in Brazil using a new Zika virus 
standard. Of 15 laboratories, 73% showed limited sensitiv-
ity and specificity. Viral load estimates varied significantly. 
Continuous quality assurance is required for adequate 
 
estimates of Zika virus–associated disease and determina-
tion of patient care.
T
he catastrophic Zika virus outbreak in the Americas 
has affected millions of persons. Brazil was the most 
affected country and reported ≈95% of all cases of suspect-
ed Zika virus–associated congenital disease (1). Limited 
sensitivity and specificity of tests hampers serologic detec-
tion of Zika virus–specific antibodies in tropical regions 
(2). Thus, real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) 
has been key for diagnosing acute Zika virus infection and 
for use in epidemiologic studies (3–5). However, Zika virus 
molecular diagnostic testing is challenged by short-term vi-
remia and low viral loads (3).
A recent external quality assessment (EQA) in Europe 
revealed that 60% of laboratories need to improve molecu-
lar Zika virus detection (6). Laboratories in affluent coun-
tries conduct Zika virus diagnostic testing predominantly in 
travelers returning from tropical regions. In resource-limit-
ed settings to which multiple co-circulating arboviruses are 
endemic, the diagnostic demands differ entirely. To evalu-
ate the diagnostic landscape in the region most affected by 
Zika virus, we performed an EQA of molecular Zika virus 
diagnostic testing in Brazil during 2017.
The Study
Fifteen laboratories from 7 Brazilian states participated in 
this study; these laboratories are spread across ≈2,500 km 
longitude, including the areas most affected during Brazil’s 
Zika virus outbreak (1). Participants were university labo-
ratories, hospital laboratories, federal research institutes 
supporting public health services, and a diagnostic testing 
company. We provided EQA panels to all laboratories. 
Each panel comprised 12 lyophilized samples contain-
ing inactivated full virus spiked into human plasma tested 
negative for arboviruses beforehand. The panel consisted 
of 4 Zika virus–positive specimens of 103–106 RNA cop-
ies/mL to assess sensitivity and determine viral load. Zika 
virus–negative specimens to assess specificity comprised 
dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4, Japanese encephalitis

virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yel-
low fever virus, and chikungunya virus at ≈105 50% tis-
sue culture infective dose/mL each and a negative plasma 
specimen (Table 1). Moreover, each panel included the in-
ternational World Health Organization (WHO) Zika virus 
standard for quantification (7). However, the WHO stan-
dard has limited availability. Importation of the WHO stan-
dard may be restricted by countries that perceive heat-inac-
tivated materials that derive from live virus as potentially 
infectious. Therefore, we designed and acquired a Zika 
virus armored RNA (Asuragen, Austin, TX, USA). The 
Zika virus armored RNA is a synthetic RNA covering the 
target sites of 9 Zika virus–specific real-time RT-PCRs as 
described previously (3), encapsulated into bacteriophage 
proteins. This highly stable, noninfectious, pseudoviral 
particle can be used as a universal control for the covered 
assays, shipped without biosafety concerns, and used as a 
control for both nucleic acid preparation and RT-PCR. 
We asked all laboratories to conduct molecular Zika 
virus diagnostics as routinely done with clinical samples 
and to quantify Zika virus–positive specimens using both 
standards. All but 1 laboratory used the same real-time RT-
PCR protocol developed by Lanciotti et al. (2), highlighting 
the wide dissemination of this assay in Brazil and suggest-
ing comparability of test results within this study (Table 
1). We found no significant difference between samples 
 
containing comparable quantities of the Asian and the Af-
rican Zika virus lineage, suggesting suitability of the proto-
cols for both lineages (p = 0.313 by Fisher exact test).
EQA results varied among laboratories. Of 15 labora-
tories, 4 (27%) reported correct results for all samples. Five 
(33%) reported 1 or 2 false-negative results from samples 
with low Zika virus concentrations (Table 1; Figure 1, pan-
el A). EQA participants correctly tested only the 2 samples 
containing the highest Zika virus concentrations of 8.1 × 
105 and 7.0 × 103 copies/mL (exact test of goodness-of-fit p 
= 1.00 and p = 0.14, respectively). This finding suggests a 
potential lack of sensitivity that may be problematic given 
that viral loads of 103–104 copies/mL are commonly ob-
served in Zika virus–infected patients (3).
Six (40%) laboratories reported >3 false results, includ-
ing at least 2 false-positive detections of Zika virus–nega-
tive specimens. No heterologous flavivirus was particularly 
affected by false-positive detection, suggesting that false-
positive results did not result from unspecific binding of as-
say oligonucleotides (Table 1). Instead, false-positive results 
hint at the possibility of laboratory contamination potentially 
resulting from virus isolation attempts or PCR amplicons 
generated during prior Zika virus experimentation.
EQA performance varied according to the way viral 
RNA was prepared. The 8 laboratories conducting Zika 
virus detection using automated platforms performed

*Positive samples contained different amounts of Zika virus strain MRS_OPY_Martinique_PaRi_2015 (representing the Asian lineage, including the 
outbreak strain in the Americas) or Zika virus strain MR766 (representing the African lineage). Zika virus–negative controls contained human plasma, 
CHIKV, DENV seroypes 2 and 4, JEV, SLEV, WNV, or YFV. Samples were prepared from 0.2 mL phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 20% 
human plasma and spiked with virus culture supernatants. Viruses were heat inactivated before lyophilization. Human plasma was tested negative for 
viral RNA and for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) inhibition before spiking of viral cell culture supernatants. Detection of different samples 
was analyzed by the exact test of goodness-of-fit with p>0.1 being significant. The parameter value defining the expected ratio of correct tests was set to 
0.99. Only the 2 samples containing the highest Zika virus loads were tested correctly at statistical significance (p = 1.0 and p = 0.134, respectively). 
Detection of all other samples showed p values of <0.009. All laboratories except 1 used an assay published by Lanciotti et al. (2). CHIKV, chikungunya

generally superior (n = 8; Youden index, 0.661) compared 
with the 7 laboratories conducting manual RNA extrac-
tion (Youden index, 0.446) (Table 2). This finding might 
indicate an increased risk for contamination during manual 
RNA preparation. However, automated RNA preparation 
also might represent a proxy for more affluent settings of 
those laboratories.
As previously reported (3), RNA extraction critically 
influences the clinical lower limit of detection (LOD). Al-
though all participants used highly sensitive real-time RT-
PCRs, clinical LODs varied considerably because of dif-
ferent RNA extraction protocols (Figure 1, panel B). Lack 
of detection of low-concentration EQA samples is thus 
not surprising because even a small decrease in sensitivity 
readily causes clinical LODs above the concentration of the 
lowest EQA panel specimen (Figure 1, panel C). This find-
ing highlights that optimized RNA extraction protocols are 
crucial for sensitive Zika virus diagnostics.
Quantification of Zika virus loads did not differ 
significantly between use of the armored RNA and the 
WHO Zika virus standard, with only 0.76 log10 medi-
an deviation between results (p = 0.429 by Wilcoxon 
signed rank test). This observation suggests usability of 
the armored RNA for Zika virus quantification in tropi-
cal regions. Irrespective of the standard, viral load de-
terminations among laboratories were comparable with 
0.12–0.88 log10 median deviations of viral load estimates 
among laboratories for individual Zika virus specimens. 
However, we also observed drastic deviations of up to 6 
orders of magnitude (Figure 2), suggesting that caution 
must be taken upon comparing viral load determinations 
as markers for severe Zika virus disease (8,9) among dif-
ferent laboratories.
Conclusions
Some laboratories in Brazil showed suboptimal sensitivity 
and specificity of Zika virus diagnostic testing. However, 
these laboratories performed comparably to those in Eu-
rope (6). Neither sensitivity nor specificity differed signifi-
cantly between laboratories in Brazil compared with those

in Europe (p = 0.767 and p = 0.324, respectively, by Fisher 
exact test). Similarly, the proportion of perfectly perform-
ing laboratories in this EQA (27%) was comparable with 
previous EQAs of flavivirus molecular diagnostics, includ-
ing yellow fever virus (18%), dengue virus (24%), and 
West Nile virus (27%) (10–12). Flavivirus molecular di-
agnostics are thus generally challenging and benefit greatly 
from controls, such as those provided in this EQA. This 
study underscores the need to combine RT-PCR and sero-
logic testing in Zika virus diagnostic testing, despite their 
inherent limitations (3).
Independent of the challenges of Zika virus molecu-
lar detection, because of taxation and distributor margins, 
RT-PCR reagents in Latin America are usually 100%–
200% more expensive than in affluent countries (13). 
Limited resources and relatively higher costs potentially 
force laboratories in Brazil to seek inferior, more afford-
able solutions. Enhanced access of laboratories in tropical 
regions to state-of-the-art reagents is thus an unresolved 
key component of outbreak response. Further EQAs in 
Brazil should involve state laboratories that carry a large 
proportion of Zika virus testing within the public health 
care system. Unfortunately, the state laboratories we con-
tacted for this EQA could not participate because of lim-
ited resources.
Finally, lack of sensitivity directly affects estimates 
of the absolute risk for Zika virus–induced congenital 
disease upon maternal infection during pregnancy (14). 
False-positive results potentially have dramatic conse-
quences for patients, as illustrated by a >90% increase in 
illegal abortion requests in Latin America during the 2016 
Zika virus epidemic (15). Our results emphasize the need 
for continuous quality assessments of Zika virus diagnos-
tic testing globally.
