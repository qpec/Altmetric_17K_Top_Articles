The observational fear (OF) paradigm in rodents, in which the subject is exposed to a distressed conspecific, elicits contextual fear learning
and enhances future passive avoidance learning, which may model certain behavioral traits resulting from traumatic experiences in humans.
As these behaviors affected by the OF require dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), we searched for synaptic adaptations in dmPFC
resulting from OF in mice by recording synaptic responses in dmPFC layer V pyramidal neurons elicited by repeated 5 Hz electrical
stimulation of dmPFC layer I or by optogenetic stimulation of specific interneurons ex vivo 1 day after OF. OF increased depression of
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) along IPSC trains evoked by the 5 Hz electrical stimulation, but, surprisingly, decreased depression
of dendritic IPSCs isolated after blocking GABAa receptor on the soma. Subsequent optogenetic analyses revealed increased depression of
IPSCs originating from perisomatically projecting parvalbumin interneurons (PV-IPSCs), but decreased depression of IPSCs from
dendritically projecting somatostatin cells (SOM-IPSCs). These changes were no longer detectable in the presence of a GABAb receptor
antagonist CGP52432. Meanwhile, OF decreased the sensitivity of SOM-IPSCs, but not PV-IPSCs to a GABAb receptor agonist baclofen.
Thus, OF causes opposing changes in GABAb receptor mediated suppression of GABA release from PV-positive and SOM-positive
interneurons. Such adaptations may alter dmPFC connectivity with brain areas that target its deep vs superficial layers and thereby
contribute to the behavioral consequences of the aversive experiences.

INTRODUCTION
Traumatic experiences, even those without physical pain, are a
risk factor for mental disorders (Cougle et al, 2009; Resnick
et al, 1995), but how they alter relevant neuronal circuits
remains unknown. The observational fear (OF) paradigm in
rodent models certain components of socially induced trauma
without physical pain or physical discomfort. The subject
observer animal is exposed once to a conspecific demonstrator
receiving electrical footshocks and emitting distress signals via
multiple modalities. The distress signals act as an uncondi-
tional stimulus and lead to memorization of the associated
cues and context (Chen et al, 2009; Jeon et al, 2010;
Yusufishaq and Rosenkranz, 2013). We have recently shown
that OF also enhances future learning in the passive avoidance
(PA) task and causes the formation of silent synapses in the
input from the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) to the
basolateral amygdala (Ito et al, 2015).
As dmPFC is involved in Pavlovian conditioning (Malin
et al, 2007; Malin and McGaugh, 2006) and undergoes
synaptic remodeling during contextual fear learning (Bero
et al, 2014), we hypothesized that OF also elicits plastic
changes within dmPFC, which could potentially underlie the
fear learning during OF, or the stronger PA learning in the
future. We searched for changes at synapses that target
pyramidal cells (PCs) in dmPFC layer V. These cells belong
to dmPFC major output neurons. They innervate multiple
targets including the cortex, amygdala, striatum, thalamus,
brainstem nuclei and spinal cord (Gabbott et al, 2005; Hirai
et al, 2012; Shepherd, 2013). As their apical dendrites extend
towards the superficial layer of dmPFC, the layer V PC are
positioned to integrate information from all cortical layers by
receiving inputs from local neurons and remote projections
from all over the brain (Ramaswamy and Markram, 2015).
Our analysis suggests that OF redistributes flow of that
information by reorganizing inhibitory control of inputs to
the layer V neurons by two types of interneurons that are
distinguished by expression of parvalbumin (PV) and
somatostatin (SOM).

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
C57BL/6N males were crossed with 129SvEv females to
obtain
wild-type
mice
or
with
homozygous
129SvEv
interneuron-specific Cre-driver females for interneuron-
specific expression of ChR2. Male pups were housed two
littermates per cage (Allentown, NJ) since weaning as
detailed in Ito et al (2015). All experiments were approved
by Virginia Tech IACUC and followed the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Viral Injection Surgery
ChR2-AAV pseudo-type 1 virus containing Cre-activated
ChR2 gene was prepared by the University of North Carolina
Gene Therapy Vector Core (Chapel Hill, NC) using a
plasmid pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2 (H134R)-EYFP
(Addgene
20298).
Heterozygous
male
Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr
(Hippenmeyer et al, 2005) or Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh (Taniguchi
et al, 2011) transgenic mice were injected bilaterally with
0.5 μl of the viral solution (108 viral particles) per hemisphere
in dmPFC at 1.3 mm anterior, 0.4 mm lateral from the
bregma, and 1.3 mm ventral from brain surface, as described
(Ito et al, 2015). Previous studies have demonstrated specific
expression of ChR2 in SOM-INs and PV interneurons (PV-
INs) of dmPFC using these lines and AAV vector (Kim et al,
2016; Sohal et al, 2009).
Behavior
OF procedure (Jeon et al, 2010) was performed at age of
p60–75 during light phase of the day cycle in a fear
conditioning chamber (Med Associates, St Albans, VT),
divided into two unequal compartments by a transparent
Plexiglas wall with 7 mm diameter holes, spaced at 2 cm
interval, to allow auditory and olfactory cues and whisker-to-
whisker interaction. In the larger 26 × 20 × 26 cm (depth,
width, height) compartment, a stainless-steel rod floor was
covered
with
a
white
plastic
sheet.
In
the
smaller
26 × 9 × 26 cm compartment, the rod floor was exposed.
Cagemates observer and demonstrator were placed in the
larger and the smaller compartments, respectively. After
5 min acclimation, 24 footshocks (1 mA, 2 s, every 10 s) were
delivered to the demonstrator. In the control procedure,
demonstrators did not receive footshocks. The observers (OF
or controls) were returned to the home cage and housed
alone until preparation of brain slices for physiology on the
next day.
Electrophysiology
Next day after OF training, under deep isoflurane anesthesia,
animals were decapitated. Brains were immersed in an ice-
cooled cutting solution containing (in mM) 110 Choline Cl,
2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.5 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, 0.5 CaCl2,
and 5 MgSO4, and bubbled with a 95% O2/5% CO2. Coronal
dmPFC slices, 300 μm thick, were cut using DSK Microslicer
(Ted Pella, Redding, CA) and incubated in solution contain-
ing (in mM) 120 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3,
10 glucose, 0.5 CaCl2, and 5 MgSO4, bubbled with 95% O2/
5% CO2 gas mixture at room temperature for at least 1 h
before recording. Recording chamber was superfused at
2 ml/min with ACSF equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and
containing 120 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10
glucose, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2. Whole-cell recordings were
obtained at 30 ± 1 °C with Multiclamp 700B amplifier and
Digidata 1440 A (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). Putative
layer V principle neurons in dmPFC were identified by their
pyramidal morphology under the Dodt gradient contrast
optics (custom made) at 850 nm LED illumination (Thor-
labs, Newton, NJ) and were recorded using 4–6 MΩ pipettes
filled with K+-based internal solution (in mM): 130 K-
gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 ATP-Mg, 0.1
GTP-Na pH 7.3, or Cs+-based internal solution (in mM):
120 Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.2
EGTA, 2 ATP-Mg, 0.1 GTP-Na, and 5 QX314 pH 7.3,
osmolarity 285 Osm. Series resistance (Rs) was 10–20 MΩ
and monitored throughout experiments. Data were not
included in the analysis if Rs changed > 20%. All membrane
potentials were corrected for the junction potential of 12 mV.
For electrical stimulation of layer I, 0.1 ms pulses of current,
30–80 μA range, were delivered via a 6 MΩ pipette filled with
ASCF. The current was adjusted to obtain postsynaptic
responses as described in results. Light pulses (470 nm, 1 ms)
were generated using an LED lamp (Thorlabs) and a custom
LED driver based on MOSFET, and were delivered through a
× 40 objective lens (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) at 0.3–
2.5 mW, calibrated by a photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs)
at the tip of the lens. In some experiments, to block somatic
components of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(IPSCs), picrotoxin (1 mM) was puffed on the soma of
recorded neurons via a 1–2 MΩ pipette, positioned at
~ 50 μm from the target, by three 300 ms puffs driven by
1 psi air pressure (PDES-02DX, NPI Electronic GmbH,
Tamm, Germany). The spread of picrotoxin towards apical
dendrites was minimized by directing the puffing and the
flow of ACSF from superficial to deep layers of dmPFC. In
most experiments, data from each cell were obtained from 19
to 20 stimuli sweeps separated by 20 s intervals. Baclofen and
CGP52432 were from Tocris (Bristol, UK) and remaining
chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and StatView (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Charge transfer (voltage clamp) or
EPSP time integral (current clamp) were measured as the
area under the trace during a 45 ms time window starting
1.5 ms after the stimulus artifact or stimulus onset for
electrical and blue light stimulation, respectively. Differences
were tested using the two-tailed unpaired, paired and one
sample t-test, repeated measure, one- or two-way ANOVA,
and Bonferroni multiple comparisons as appropriate, and
deemed significant with po0.05.
RESULTS
OF Training Increases Excitability of L5 PCs and Causes
EPSP Facilitation During Repetitive Stimuli
To study effects of OF on glutamatergic transmission,
dmPFC layer I was stimulated with 5 Hz trains of five

 electrical pulses and evoked postsynaptic responses were
recorded from layer V PCs (Figure 1a) maintained at
− 70 mV in current clamp mode. To examine the suscept-
ibility of neurons to generating action potentials in response
to the repeated stimulation, stimulus intensity was set to
elicit EPSPs of about 20 mV by the first pulse in the train,
which brought membrane potential to − 50 mV, near the
action potential threshold. In response to the first pulse in
the train, neurons from the OF group mice showed a
tendency, although nonsignificant (p40.05), of having a
higher probability of firing action potential than neurons
from the control group mice. The probability became
significantly higher during the second through the fifth
pulses of the train (po0.01, collapsed data for stimuli 2–5)
(Figure 1b). We next examined the EPSP dynamics along the
train of stimuli adjusted to obtain the first EPSP at 4 to
10 mV, which was below the threshold for the action
potential. In the control group, the amplitude and time
integral of the second EPSP were significantly lower than
those of the first EPSP (amplitude: po0.01, time integral:
po0.05), whereas the values for the third to fifth EPSPs were
the same (p40.05). In contrast, in the OF group, the second
EPSP did not differ from the first one (p40.05), whereas the
values for the fourth and fifth EPSPs were significantly
higher (amplitude and time integral, fourth: po0.01; fifth:
po0.001). As a result, the amplitudes of the third (po0.05)
and fifth (po0.05) EPSPs and the time integrals of the fifth
(po0.05) and fifth (po0.01) EPSPs were higher in the OF

 than in control group (Figure 1c). Including GABAa receptor
blocker picrotoxin (100 μM) in the bath prevented the
facilitation of the fourth and fifth EPSP in the OF group
(p40.05, amplitudes and time integrals compared to the
values for the first EPSP) and abolished the differences
between OF and control groups in the third through fifth
EPSPs (p40.05) (Figure 1d), suggesting that the OF effects
on EPSPs resulted from changes in GABAergic transmission.
OF Training Enhances Depression of IPSCs Recorded
from the Soma
Evoked IPSCs were elicited in L5 PCs, voltage clamped at
0 mV, using the same electrode placement and stimulus
pattern as in Figure 1, except the stimulus intensity, was
adjusted to obtain the first IPSC within 400 to 1200 pA range.
Both the IPSC amplitudes and charge transfer decreased
along the train in all cells (amplitude: control, F(4,20) = 53.2,
po0.001; OF, F(4,19) = 190, po0.0001; charge transfer:
control,
F(4,20) = 164,
po0.001;
OF,
F(4,19) = 294,
po0.0001, repeated measure ANOVA) with greatest de-
creases occurring between the first and second IPSCs. The
IPSC depression was stronger in OF group than in controls
(behavioral treatment*amplitude interaction: F(4,39) = 5.9,
po0.001; behavioral treatment*charge transfer interaction
F(4,39) = 4.5, po0.01), resulting in lower values for the
second through fifth IPSCs in OF group (amplitude: po0.01
or o0.001; charge: po0.05 or o0.01) (Figure 2a). As
GABAb auto-receptor contributes to IPSC depression in the
neocortex (Fukuda et al, 1993; Kobayashi et al, 2012), we
repeated the experiment in the presence of GABAb receptor
(GABAbR)
blocker
CGP52432
in
the
bath
(10 μM).
CGP52432 significantly attenuated the IPSC depression
along the train in OF group (CGP52432*IPSC amplitude

F(4,33) = 14.6,
po0.0001;
CGP52432*IPSC
charge interaction F(4,33) = 25.2, po0.0001), thereby elim-
inating the differences between the control and OF groups in
IPSC dynamics (behavioral treatment*amplitude interaction:
F(4,28) = 1.7, p40.05; behavioral treatment*charge transfer

(p40.05) (Figure 2b), which suggests that the effects of OF
on IPSC dynamics are mediated by changes in a GABAbR-
dependent process.
CGP52432 and Evoked Excitation
To determine how GABAbR regulates the evoked action
potentials and EPSPs, the same experiments as in Figures 1b
and c were performed first in the absence and then after
10 min perfusion with 10 μM CGP52432 (Figure 3). In the
absence of CGP52432, the OF group showed a higher
probability of total firing (po0.01) than the controls,
reproducing the findings on Figure 1b. Bath application of
CGP52432 increased the firing probabilities in both groups
during the entire train and upon stimuli 2 through 5
(po0.05) (Figure 3b), thereby eliminating the differences
between the groups. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA
showed significant interaction between behavioral treatment
and CGP52432 for total firing probability (F(1,15) = 8.7,

(F(1,15) = 11.3, p = 0.004). It indicated that the enhancing
effect of CGP52432 was weaker in the OF group, likely due to
the higher initial firing in the absence of CGP52432. In the
subthreshold EPSP experiments, CGP52432 did not change
the amplitudes of the first EPSP significantly despite of
tendencies to decreases, but enabled facilitation between the
first and second EPSPs in both groups (EPSP amplitudes,

(Figure 3d), which eliminated the differences in EPSC
dynamics between the groups described in Figure 1c.
OF Training Attenuates IPSC Depression at Distal
Dendrites
Because of the dendritic filtering and poor space clamp at
distal dendrites, the outward currents recorded in the soma
represent the IPSCs originating mainly from the soma and
proximal dendrites (Williams and Mitchell, 2008). To enrich
recording for IPSCs originating from distal dendrites, we
suppressed GABAa receptor on the soma and proximal
dendrites by puffing picrotoxin on the soma of the recorded
neuron (Figure 4a). Picrotoxin continued to inhibit GABAa
receptor after puffing was over, as indicated by a significant
reduction in frequencies (normalized frequency: po0.0001,
comparison to 100% baseline, one sample t-test) and

charge transfers for the second through fifth IPSCs in OF
group (amplitude: po0.01 or o0.001; charge: po0.05 or

effects of OF on the dynamics of evoked IPSC originating
from distal dendrites.
OF Training has Opposing Effects on Inputs from
PV- and SOM-INs
Inhibitory inputs in soma and distal dendrites of cortical
neurons are preferentially formed by the PV and SOM
interneurons,
respectively
(Freund
and
Buzsaki,
1996;
Markram et al, 2004; Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature
et al, 2008). To examine effects of OF on these inputs and
role of GABAb receptors, we recorded IPSCs evoked
in the layer V PCs by blue light stimulation of either
PV-INs (PV-IPSCs) or SOM-INs (SOM-IPSCs) expressing
channelrhodopsin-2 (Figure 5a). IPSCs from the same
neurons were recorded in the absence and then in the
presence of CGP52432, which did not change the amplitude
of the first SOM-IPSCs and PV-IPSCs in the trains
(Figures 5b and c, middle).
The PV-IPSC amplitudes and charge transfer decreased
along the train in both control and OF groups (amplitude:
control,
F(4,15) = 111,

These results suggested that GABAbR mediates effects of OF
on the dynamics of evoked IPSCs from PV- and SOM-INs in
the opposing manners.
OF Training has a Different Effect on GABAbR Control
of GABA Release from SOM- than PV-INs
To quantify GABAbR-mediated inhibition of GABA release
in inputs to the layer V PCs from PV and SOM neurons, we
examined
effects
of
a
GABAbR
agonist
baclofen
on
PV-IPSCs and SOM-IPSCs either in controls or OF cells.
Figure 6

Neuropsychopharmacology
 Five-minute perfusion with 20 μM baclofen significantly
inhibited IPSCs in all four experimental groups (IPSC
amplitude % of baseline compared to 100, po0.0001)
(Figure 6). One-way AVONA revealed significant differences
among the four groups (po0.01). Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons revealed significant differences between the PV/
Control and SOM/Control (po0.05), between SOM/Control
and SOM/OF (po0.05), but not between PV/Control and
PV/OF groups. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant
‘IPSC type’*‘behavioral treatment’ interaction (po0.01) and
Bonferroni posttest showed a significant effect of behavioral
treatment on the SOM-IPSCs (po0.01), but not on the
PV-IPSCs. Thus, under control conditions, GABAbR exerts
stronger inhibition of GABA release from SOM-INs than
from PV-INs but OF eliminates that difference by attenuat-
ing GABAbR suppression of GABA release from SOM-INs.
DISCUSSION
The key finding here is that the OF, one form of purely
emotional distress in mice, reorganizes inhibition of dmPFC
layer V pyramidal neurons by attenuating the GABAbR
control of GABA release from SOM-INs, but not from PV-
INs, which underlie mainly dendritic and somatic inhibition,
respectively. This study, however, does not rule out a
possibility of such changes on exposure to other stressors.
Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the
observed changes could be attributed to the contextual
learning during OF (Jeon et al, 2010) or to the effect of
trauma on future learning in the PA paradigm (Ito et al, 2015).
Imaging studies have demonstrated that traumatic events
alter functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex in
humans (Krause-Utz et al, 2014; Lanius et al, 2010; Long
et al, 2014; van Wingen et al, 2012) and rodents (Henckens
et al, 2015; Liang et al, 2014), but synaptic process underlying
such changes remains largely unexplored. To that end, we
examined OF-induced synaptic adaptations in PCs in
dmPFC layer V, which are one of the major outputs of
dmPFC. These cells can serve as a reporter of alterations in
multiple microcircuits within dmPFC, because their den-
drites span through all cortical layers and integrate inputs
from remote and local afferents. We electrically stimulated
dmPFC layer I, which contains axons arriving from cortex
and thalamus, as well as local ascending glutamatergic and
GABAergic axons. The 5 Hz stimulation frequency was
selected as physiologically relevant, given the ‘midline frontal
theta’ 3-7 Hz band correlation with working memory in
humans (Gevins et al, 1997; Sauseng et al, 2010) and the
predominance of the 2-5 Hz band in PFC of the rat (Fujisawa
and Buzsaki, 2011).
Dynamics of Excitation and Inhibition
OF increased the likelihood of action potentials in PCs
during the 5 Hz stimulation train, which was consistent with
the emerged EPSP facilitation along that train. The EPSP
facilitation was no longer seen in the presence of GABAa
receptor blocker picrotoxin, which indicated that GABAergic
transmission was essential for that facilitation. The stronger
decline of evoked inhibition along the train may underlie the
observed EPSP facilitation after OF.
The Role of GABAbR
Presynaptic GABAbR mediates short-term depression of
GABAergic synapses during repeated stimulation in the
somatosensory and insular cortex, particularly when the
interval between stimuli is within 150–300 ms (Fukuda et al,
1993; Kobayashi et al, 2012). Surprisingly, in our preparation
in the control group, a GABAbR blocker CGP52432 had no
significant effect on IPSC depression. However, in the OF
group, CGP52432 decreased the depression, thus abolishing
effects of OF. It indicates that OF recruits GABAbR to
enhance the IPSC depression, which is normally GABAbR
independent. The observed effects of CGP52432 on IPSCs
are unlikely to involve postsynaptic GABAbR, because
QX314, which blocks GABAbR-mediated hyperpolarization
(Andrade, 1991; McLean et al, 1996; Nathan et al, 1990), was
included in the internal solution.
In the analyses of evoked excitation in the layer 5 principal
cells, CGP52432 eliminated the differences between the OF
and control groups in both firing and EPSP dynamics, which
suggests that GABAbR is contributing to the effects of OF on
evoked excitation. This contribution could involve GABAbR
both in principal cells in interneurons because bath applied
CGP52432 blocks GABAbR in all cells.
Somatic vs Dendritic Inhibition
Given that somatic voltage clamp poorly controls voltage at
distal dendrites (Williams and Mitchell, 2008), the somati-
cally recorded IPSCs mainly represent synaptic events near
the soma and can be considered as ‘somatically enriched
IPSCs’. Then, we enriched recordings for IPSCs originating
from distal dendrites by puffing picrotoxin on the soma of
recorded neurons. The properties of the ‘dendritically
enriched IPSCs’ were different from those of the somatically
enriched IPSCs. First, in the control group, they exhibited
stronger depression, which was sensitive to CGP52432.
Second, OF training rather attenuated their depression and
decreased its sensitivity to CGP52432. These results indicate
that OF attenuates GABAbR control over GABAergic inputs
to distal dendrites, which is normally stronger than over
inputs to soma. Through these opposing effects on GABAbR
control of somatic vs dendritic IPSC, OF training may
equalize
the
dynamics
of
IPSC
depression
along
the
somatodendritic axis. Yet, our analysis does not distinguish
between
IPSCs
originating
at
the
soma
vs
proximal
dendrites, because it remains unclear at what distance from
the soma picrotoxin puff was blocking GABAa receptor.
GABAbR-Dependent Alterations in PV-IN and SOM-IN
Inputs to L5 PCs
To identify cells that underlie the observed GABAbR control
of GABA transmission, IPSCs originating from PV- and
SOM-INs (PV-IPSCs and SOM-IPSCs, respectively) were
isolated by blue light stimulation of interneurons expressing
ChR2. The effects of OF training and GABAbR blocker
CGP52432 on PV-IPSCs were very similar with their effects
on
‘somatically
enriched’
IPSCs
evoked
by
electrical
stimulation of dmPFC layer 1 in the absence of picrotoxin
puff. Conversely, effects on SOM-IPSCs resembled those on
‘dendritically enriched’ IPSCs, which were evoked by the

 same electrical stimulation, but after picrotoxin puff to soma.
Although electrical stimulation differs from the blue light
stimulation by recruiting broader neuronal networks includ-
ing several types of SOM-negative INs, such as the 5-HT
receptor 3 expressing cells that target distal dendrites, and
also GABAergic synapses between INs, such as the strong
inputs from SOM-INs to PV-INs (Marlin and Carter, 2014;
Pfeffer
et
al,
2013),
these
observations
indicate
that
picrotoxin puffs to the soma successfully shift the origin of
recorded IPSCs from the soma to distal dendrites, consistent
with the preferential targeting of PC soma by PV-INs and
distal dendrites by SOM-INs, respectively (Freund and
Buzsaki, 1996; Markram et al, 2004; Petilla Interneuron
Nomenclature et al, 2008).
The strong modulation by GABAbR appears to be a distinct
property of SOM-INs. In controls, CGP52432 strongly
attenuated the depression of SOM-IPSCs (Figure 4c), but
barely affected the depression of PV-IPSCs (Figure 4b),
indicating that GABAbR control of SOM-INs is stronger than
of PV-INs. This was consistent with the greater sensitivity to
baclofen of the SOM-IPSCs than the PV-IPSCs in control
mice, suggesting that SOM-INs naturally express more
functional GABAbR, which agrees with an earlier finding in
the hippocampus that SOM-INs have stronger GABAbR1
immunoreactivity than all other cells (Sloviter et al, 1999). The
cell-type specific differences in GABAbR function could be an
adaptation to possibly different local concentrations of GABA,
high at perisomatic basket-type synapses and low at sparse
dendritic synapses.
The attenuation of GABAbR-mediated depression of
SOM-IPSCs after OF training is readily explained by
decreased GABAbR function in SOM-INs, detected as
decreased sensitivity of SOM-IPSCs to baclofen (Figure 5).
Paradoxically, despite OF training enhanced the GABAbR-
mediated depression of PV-IPSCs, there was only a trend
towards higher sensitivity of PV-IPSCs to baclofen. This
discrepancy may reflect distinct modulation of GABAbR in
each subcellular domain: the 5 Hz stimulation is expected to
activate
GABAbRs
mostly
near
GABAergic
terminals;
whereas bath applied baclofen activates all receptors includ-
ing those on soma and dendrites. The somatic and dendritic
receptors can attenuate GABA release by preventing action
potentials and thereby mask the effect from GABAbR
upregulation at terminals after OF training.
The finding of altered GABAbR function one day after OF
indicates long-term changes in either the receptor or its
downstream targets. The possible mechanisms may involve
NMDA receptor, which often participates in long-lasting
plastic changes and has been shown to control trafficking
and surface expression of GABAbR via the CaMKII–AMPK
phosphorylation cascade (Guetg et al, 2010; Maier et al, 2010;
Terunuma et al, 2010). Changing GABAbR kinetics proper-
ties by the KCTD family of axillary proteins (Gassmann and
Bettler, 2012; Schwenk et al, 2010) or modulation via several
recently discovered interacting proteins (Schwenk et al,
2016) may also be involved. Some of these mechanisms have
been documented in dendrites of glutamatergic neurons but
remain to be tested in GABAergic terminals. Understanding
what underlies opposing regulation of GABAbR in PV- and
SOM-INs may reveal the individual role of these cells during
brain response to stress.
Rerouting Information Flows in dmPFC as a Possible
Functional Implication
We found OF to rebalance inhibitory drive along the
somatodendritic axis by changing GABAbR function in
opposing ways in PV-INs for perisomatic inhibition and in
SOM-INs for dendritic inhibition. As GABA transmission
competes with glutamatergic inputs at dendrites by suppres-
sing calcium spike (Perez-Garci et al, 2006) and local
dendritic depolarization, which determines the direction of
synaptic plasticity towards LTP or LTD (Sjostrom and
Hausser, 2006), the OF training may reroute information
flow across dmPFC by attenuating glutamatergic inputs to
distal parts of dendrites, but enhancing inputs to soma and
proximal dendrites. For intra-dmPFC communication, OF is
expected to enhance connectivity among L5 PCs, because
they receive inputs from one another mainly in the proximal
basal dendritic tree (Markram et al, 1997), but to weaken
those connections of layer 2/3 neurons, which synapse on
apical dendrites of layer 5 PCs (Thomson and Bannister,
1998). For the remote connectivity, OF is expected to
attenuate corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs that
target layer I of dmPFC, but to strengthen communication
with
areas
such
as
the
hippocampus
and
basolateral
amygdala that send abundant projections to the deep layers
(Cruikshank et al, 2010; Hoover and Vertes, 2007; Jay and
Witter, 1991; Oh et al, 2014). The consequences can be even
more interesting and complex. Studies in the hippocampus
revealed that during synchronous activity, different classes of
INs
exhibit
different
firing
patterns
during
different
behavioral
states
and
associated
forms
of
oscillations
(Klausberger
et
al,
2003).
Furthermore,
INs
targeting
different subcellular domains fire at different phases of the
oscillation cycle (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008), which was
proposed to cause temporal redistribution of inhibition along
the somatodendritic axis of PCs and thereby to maintain or
segregate cell assemblies (Somogyi et al, 2014). By modifying
that process, OF may contribute to either formation or
dissolution of cell assemblies between L5 PC and remote
neurons, depending on the somatodendritic location of their
inputs to L5 PCs, and also, on the behavioral state and the
corresponding pattern of oscillatory activity.
