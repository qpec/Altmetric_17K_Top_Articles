BACKGROUND
Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for more than 100,000 human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)–related deaths per year. We tested two treatment strategies that could be 
more sustainable in Africa than the standard of 2 weeks of amphotericin B plus 
flucytosine and more effective than the widely used fluconazole monotherapy.
METHODS
We randomly assigned HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis to receive 
an oral regimen (fluconazole [1200 mg per day] plus flucytosine [100 mg per kilo-
gram of body weight per day] for 2 weeks), 1 week of amphotericin B (1 mg per 
kilogram per day), or 2 weeks of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day). Each 
patient assigned to receive amphotericin B was also randomly assigned to receive 
fluconazole or flucytosine as a partner drug. After induction treatment, all the 
patients received fluconazole consolidation therapy and were followed to 10 weeks.
RESULTS
A total of 721 patients underwent randomization. Mortality in the oral-regimen, 
1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups was 18.2% (41 of 225), 
21.9% (49 of 224), and 21.4% (49 of 229), respectively, at 2 weeks and was 35.1% (79 
of 225), 36.2% (81 of 224), and 39.7% (91 of 229), respectively, at 10 weeks. The upper 
limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in 2-week mortality 
was 4.2 percentage points for the oral-regimen group versus the 2-week amphotericin 
B groups and 8.1 percentage points for the 1-week amphotericin B groups versus the 
2-week amphotericin B groups, both of which were below the predefined 10-percent-
age-point noninferiority margin. As a partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine 
was superior to fluconazole (71 deaths [31.1%] vs. 101 deaths [45.0%]; hazard ratio 
for death at 10 weeks, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.002). One 
week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with the lowest 10-week mor-
tality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1). Side effects, such as severe anemia, were more 
frequent with 2 weeks than with 1 week of amphotericin B or with the oral regimen.
CONCLUSIONS
One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucy-
tosine were effective as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-
limited settings. (ACTA Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN45035509.)

Antifungal Combinations for Cryptococcal Meningitis
C
ryptococcal meningitis is the most 
common form of adult meningitis in 
many regions that have a high prevalence 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec-
tion1,2 and accounts for 10 to 20% of all HIV-
related deaths, with more than 100,000 deaths 
each year.3 This high burden is driven by a high 
case fatality rate, which in sub-Saharan Africa is 
estimated to be 70% at 3 months.3,4
Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in 
 
resource-limited settings is challenging. The 
international standard induction treatment of 
2 weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus 
flucytosine5 is not available in most African 
clinical centers. Amphotericin B requires intra-
venous administration and close laboratory mon-
itoring and is associated with phlebitis, second-
ary infections, anemia, and renal impairment.6 
Flucytosine is currently unavailable, although 
the molecule is used widely as a constituent of 
emtricitabine, and generic manufacture is pos-
sible at low cost.7 Most countries therefore rely 
on generic or donated fluconazole induction 
monotherapy; however, the rate of fungal clear-
ance with fluconazole is slower than that with 
amphotericin B, even at an elevated dosage, and 
mortality associated with this treatment is 50 to 
60% at 10 weeks and is higher than 70% at 1 year 
even in study cohorts.8,9
Phase 2 studies have defined several promis-
ing treatment strategies that are associated with 
fungal clearance similar to that with 2-week 
amphotericin B regimens and that have more 
favorable safety profiles. An oral combination of 
fluconazole and flucytosine was found to be as-
sociated with a rate of clearance of infection 
similar to that with amphotericin B alone and to 
be associated with higher survival rates than 
those with fluconazole alone.10 Shorter-course 
amphotericin B had a more favorable side-effect 
profile than standard 2-week courses, with no 
diminution in the rate of clearance of infection 
in the second week, perhaps because of the long 
half-life of amphotericin B in brain tissue.11,12 The 
efficacy of shorter-course amphotericin B treat-
ment has also been shown in animal models.13
In addition, the drug of choice to combine 
with amphotericin B remains unclear. In a previ-
ous trial, amphotericin B plus flucytosine was 
associated with higher survival rates at day 70 
than amphotericin B alone.14 Amphotericin B plus 
flucytosine was not found to differ from ampho-
tericin B plus fluconazole with regard to mortal-
ity at 10 weeks, but the results of a secondary 
analysis at 6 months favored flucytosine.14 How-
ever, these results have been insufficient to drive 
wider availability of flucytosine.15
Therefore, we tested two new treatment strat-
egies that could be more readily sustainable in 
African centers than 2 weeks of amphotericin B 
and more effective than fluconazole: oral ther-
apy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucyto-
sine, and a shorter course (1 week) of induction 
therapy with amphotericin B–based treatment. 
These regimens were compared with a 2-week 
regimen of amphotericin B–based treatment. In 
addition, within the amphotericin B groups, we 
randomly assigned patients to receive either flu-
cytosine or fluconazole as the partner drug.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We conducted an open-label, phase 3, random-
ized, noninferiority, multicenter trial (Advancing 
Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa 
[ACTA]) to compare three treatment strategies 
(an oral combination regimen of fluconazole 
plus flucytosine, 1 week of amphotericin B, and 
the standard 2 weeks of amphotericin B) for the 
induction treatment of HIV-associated crypto-
coccal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole 
were also evaluated as partner drugs with am-
photericin B.
Participants were recruited from nine African 
centers: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blan-
tyre, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, and 
Zomba Central Hospital, Zomba, Malawi; Uni-
versity Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; 
Muhimbili, Amana, and Mwananyamala Hospi-
tals, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; and Hôpital 
Central, Yaoundé, and Douala General Hospital, 
Douala, Cameroon. The protocol was approved 
by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by all 
the site national research ethics committees and 
regulatory bodies. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all the patients or, in the case 
of patients with altered mental status, from the 
next of kin (consent was obtained from these 
patients after recovery).
Lateral-flow cryptococcal antigen tests were 
donated by or purchased from IMMY. Trial drugs 
were purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb (am-

cals (flucytosine), and Cipla or Medopharm (flu-
conazole). In places where the Pfizer fluconazole 
donation program was running, donated fluco-
nazole was used when available. The trial funders, 
suppliers, and drug manufacturers had no role 
in trial design; data collection, analysis, and in-
terpretation; or manuscript preparation. The au-
thors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and for the adherence of the trial to 
the protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Trial Participants
HIV-seropositive adults (≥18 years old) with a 
first episode of cryptococcal meningitis who 
tested positive on India ink staining, cryptococ-
cal antigen assay, or both in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) were included. Patients were excluded if 
they had previously received more than one dose 
of amphotericin B or more than one treatment 
dose (1200 mg) or more than seven low doses 
(200 mg) of fluconazole in the 2 weeks before 
screening, were pregnant or lactating, were tak-
ing contraindicated concomitant drugs, or had 
any previous adverse reactions to the trial drugs.
An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that 
was more than 5 times the upper limit of the 
normal range, a polymorphonuclear leukocyte 
count that was less than 500 per cubic millime-
ter, or a platelet count that was less than 50,000 
per cubic millimeter were late-exclusion criteria 
(i.e., a patient who met one or more of these 
criteria at baseline was withdrawn from the trial). 
In addition, if an elevated creatinine level remained 
above 220 μmol per liter on the day after random-
ization despite the patient receiving rehydration, 
the patient was withdrawn from the trial.
Initially, patients were excluded if they had 
previously been exposed to antiretroviral therapy 
(ART). However, because it became clear that a 
large number of patients were presenting with 
cryptococcal meningitis while taking ART or with 
previous exposure to ART, soon after commence-
ment of the trial (after 4% of total enrollment), a 
protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of these 
patients. Full details of the trial design can be 
found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.
Interventions and Randomization
We assessed three treatment strategies (the use 
of an oral regimen, a 1-week amphotericin B regi-
men, and a 2-week amphotericin B regimen), as 
well as two alternative partner drugs for ampho-
tericin B (fluconazole or flucytosine). The oral 
regimen consisted of fluconazole (1200 mg per 
day) plus flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram of 
body weight per day) given orally for 2 weeks. 
The 1-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of 
amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day ad-
ministered intravenously) plus either fluconazole 
(1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per 
kilogram per day) for 7 days, followed on days 8 
through 14 by fluconazole (1200 mg per day). 
The 2-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of 
amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day ad-
ministered intravenously) plus either fluconazole 
(1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per 
kilogram per day) for 14 days.
Patients underwent block randomization in-
dividually, stratified according to site, to one of 
the three treatment strategies and, for patients 
who were assigned to an amphotericin B regi-
men, to one of the two partner drugs. Overall, 
this strategy resulted in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio of pa-
tients assigned to receive one of the five combi-
nations of treatment strategy and partner drug 
with amphotericin B. For each site, a computer-
generated randomization list with block sizes of 
18, 24, and 30 was produced. The trial pharma-
cist and clinician were responsible for conduct-
ing the randomization by sequentially drawing 
sealed envelopes that contained the treatment 
assignment for each enrolled patient.
Patients who received amphotericin B were 
given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously daily 
in addition to usual fluid requirements and pre-
emptive potassium and magnesium (glycerophos-
phate) supplementation.16 Oral medications were 
given through a nasogastric tube if the patient 
was unable to swallow. Laboratory blood tests 
were performed regularly during the first 2 weeks 
of treatment. Baseline and day 7 electrocardio-
graphic monitoring was discontinued at the ad-
vice of the data and safety monitoring commit-
tee after 100 paired electrocardiograms showed 
no evidence of clinically significant prolongation 
of the QT interval in association with flucon-
azole at a dose of 1200 mg per day. Lumbar 
punctures were performed at baseline and on 
days 7 and 14 for quantitative cultures.17 In ad-
dition, patients with high CSF pressure under-
went daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until the 
pressure was controlled.5 Patients were followed

Antifungal Combinations for Cryptococcal Meningitis
for 10 weeks after randomization. After 2 weeks, 
fluconazole was given at 800 mg per day until 
ART was started at 4 weeks (or restarted in 
those who had discontinued ART), at 400 mg 
per day until 10 weeks, and at 200 mg per day 
thereafter. ART was prescribed in accordance 
with national guidelines.
End Points
The primary end point for comparison of the 
two experimental treatment strategies with the 
standard therapy of 2 weeks of amphotericin 
B–based treatment was all-cause mortality at 
2 weeks. Two weeks was chosen in view of the 
noninferiority design of the trial and the fact 
that mortality at 2 weeks is more likely than 
mortality at later time points to reflect deaths 
from cryptococcal meningitis.18 Secondary end 
points included 4-week and 10-week all-cause mor-
tality, the rate of decrease in the log10 CSF fungal 
count over 14 days, and clinical and laboratory-
defined grade 3 and 4 adverse events.
For the comparison between partner drugs for 
the amphotericin B regimens, the primary end 
point was all-cause mortality at 10 weeks. The 
secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 
2 weeks and 4 weeks, rate of clearance of infec-
tion, and adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
A target enrollment of 680 patients (226 per 
strategy) was set in order to achieve 90% power 
to show noninferiority with a 10-percentage-point 
noninferiority margin and under the assumption 
of 15% mortality at 2 weeks in the 2-week am-
photericin B groups. For the comparison of the 
partner drugs with amphotericin B, with the use 
of a superiority design and under the assump-
tion of a 10-week mortality of 40% with one 
partner treatment, the trial had 90% power to 
detect a 35% lower mortality with the alternative 
partner treatment.
The primary analysis was based on the inten-
tion-to-treat population. A generalized linear 
model with a binomial distribution and identity 
link function was used to calculate differences 
and upper limits of the one-sided 95% confi-
dence interval for mortality. Post-hoc analysis of 
the primary end point with a one-sided 97.5% 
confidence interval, the upper limit of which is 
equivalent to the upper limit of a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval and the use of which is 
equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction 
(α 
= 
0.025) for two comparisons, was also per-
formed. Correction for multiple comparisons was 
not applied to the analyses of secondary out-
comes. The per-protocol population excluded pa-
tients who missed more than 1 day of treatment 
within the first 2 weeks after randomization.
All-cause mortality at 2, 4, and 10 weeks was 
compared between the groups with the use of 
log-rank tests. Kaplan–Meier plots were also 
constructed, and Cox regression models with 
treatment as a predictor were used to derive 
hazard ratios and two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals. Analyses were also performed with 
adjustment for prespecified covariates: site, age, 
sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CD4+ cell 
count, CSF fungal count at baseline, and ART 
status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses of all-cause 
mortality were performed under the assumption 
that all the patients who were lost to follow-up 
had died.
The analysis of the log10 CSF fungal count 
over a period of 14 days from baseline was per-
formed with a linear mixed-effects model. For 
comparison with previous studies,17-19 linear re-
gression was also used to calculate slopes of the 
decrease in CSF fungal count for each patient, 
and the mean slopes were compared between 
the groups.
All analyses were performed with the use of 
SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Addi-
tional details are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Results
Trial Population
From January 2013 through November 2016, a 
total of 721 patients underwent randomization 
(Fig. 1). Of these patients, 43 were excluded from 
all analyses: 30 met predefined late-exclusion 
criteria, 3 immediately withdrew consent, 7 were 
negative for cryptococcal meningitis, and 3 had 
had cryptococcal meningitis previously. A total 
of 16 patients were excluded from the per-proto-
col analysis: 14 missed more than 1 day of treat-
ment within the 2-week induction period, and 
2 did not receive the correct randomly assigned 
treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar 
in the treatment groups and reflected the severity 
of immunosuppression in the population (Table 1, 
and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Ap-

pendix). In total, 59% of patients were taking 
or had previously taken ART. Patients who had 
never taken ART started the therapy at a median 
of 28 days (interquartile range, 27 to 34) after 
randomization.
Mortality
A total of 678 patients were eligible for inclusion 
in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these pa-
tients, 1 was lost to follow-up within 2 weeks and 
3 were lost to follow-up between 2 weeks and 10 
weeks. Mortality was similar in the oral-regimen, 
1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphoteri-
cin B groups: 18.2%, 21.9%, and 21.4%, respec-
tively, at 2 weeks and 35.1%, 36.2%, and 39.7%, 
respectively, at 10 weeks (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). 
The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in mortality at 2 weeks 
(primary end point) was 3.0 percentage points 
for the comparison of the oral-regimen group 
with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P<0.001) 
and 6.8 percentage points for the comparison 
of the 1-week amphotericin B groups with the 
2-week amphotericin B groups (P 
= 
0.007) (Fig. 2D). 
The upper limits of the one-sided 97.5% confi-
dence intervals (the use of which is equivalent to 
applying a Bonferroni correction for the com-
parisons) both remained below the noninferior-
ity margin (Table 2). The hazard ratios for death 
at 2 weeks, as compared with the 2-week am-
photericin B groups, were 0.82 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.54 to 1.25) in the oral-regimen 
group and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51) in the 
1-week amphotericin B groups; the correspond-
ing hazard ratios for death at 10 weeks were 0.83 
(95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 
1.21) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The results were similar in the per-protocol 
analysis, adjusted analysis, and sensitivity analy-
ses (Fig. 2D, and Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (hazard 
ratio for death at 10 weeks with flucytosine vs. 
fluconazole, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.002) 
(Table 3 and Fig. 2B). This difference was driven 
by a difference in mortality between the 1-week 
amphotericin B–flucytosine group and the 1-week 
amphotericin B–fluconazole group. The results of 
separate analyses of the five groups are shown 
in Table 4 and Figure 2C, with the 2-week ampho-
tericin B–flucytosine group as the comparator. 
The 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group had 
the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 
16.2 to 32.1), significantly lower than any other 
amphotericin B group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 
0.56 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91], and adjusted hazard 
ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96], as compared 
with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group). 
The hazard ratio for death by 10 weeks, with the 
1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group used 
as the comparator, was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.01 to 
2.42) in the oral-regimen group, 2.54 (95% CI, 
1.60 to 4.05) in the 1-week amphotericin B–flu-
conazole group, and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.17) 
in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group 
(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There was no significant difference in mor-
tality between patients who had never taken 
ART and those who had previously been exposed 
to ART (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Rate of Clearance of Infection
The rate of clearance of infection (measured as 
the decrease in log10 colony-forming units per 
milliliter of CSF per day) was similar in the 
1-week and 2-week amphotericin B groups and 
more rapid in the amphotericin B groups than in 
the oral-regimen group (Table 2). Flucytosine as 
the partner drug given with amphotericin B was 
associated with more rapid clearance than fluco-
nazole (Table 3). Results were similar when lin-
ear regression was used, as in previous studies 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Laboratory-defined side effects were less frequent 
in the oral-regimen group than in the 1-week or 
2-week amphotericin B groups (Table 5, and 
Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). Grade 
4 anemia developed in 0.9% of patients in the 
oral-regimen group, 4.9% of patients in the

1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of pa-
tients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups; the 
median decrease from baseline in hemoglobin 
level over the first 2 weeks was 0.4, 1.8, and 2.7 g 
per deciliter, respectively, and 5.5%, 10.3%, and 
20.2%, respectively, of patients in each group 
received a transfusion. A grade 3 or 4 increase in 
the serum creatinine level developed in 4.9% of 
patients in the oral-regimen group, 6.2% of pa-
tients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 
8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B 
groups. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in only 
one patient, most likely because preemptive elec-
trolyte replacement was provided for patients 
receiving amphotericin B. Grade 4 neutropenia 
was recorded in 3.2% of the patients who were 
taking a regimen that included 2 weeks of flucy-
tosine, in 0.9% of those taking 1 week of flucyto-
sine, and in 1.3% of those taking a flucytosine-
free regimen. A grade 4 increase in the alanine 
aminotransferase level developed in only two 
patients, one of whom was taking fluconazole. 
Clinical adverse events were frequent with all 
regimens, which was reflective of the severe im-
munosuppression in this patient population.
Discussion
In this trial, we recruited patients from centers 
in southern, eastern, and central Africa, where 
the burden of cryptococcal meningitis is high-
est. We found that combination oral therapy with 
higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine and 
shorter-course 1-week amphotericin B–based treat-
ment were noninferior to 2 weeks of amphoteri-
cin B–based therapy and that, as the partner drug 
with amphotericin B, flucytosine was associated 
with lower mortality than fluconazole. This latter 
difference was driven by the superiority of flucy-
tosine to fluconazole in the 1-week amphoteri-
cin B groups. Indeed, although caution is ap-
propriate in interpreting these results, given the 
secondary nature of the comparisons involved, 
1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was 
associated with higher survival rates than the 
other regimens, although the difference only 
just met the criteria for significance in the com-
parison with the oral combination and, in an 
adjusted analysis, in the comparison with the 
2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine regimen.
The results were consistent in the per-protocol 
and intention-to-treat analyses, as well as in ad-
justed and sensitivity analyses. Few patients 
(0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Patients with se-
vere disease were not excluded, so that the study 
population reflected patients presenting at cen-
ters across Africa. Also supportive of the gener-
alizability of the results was the finding that 
mortality in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluco-
nazole group (41.3% at 10 weeks) was the same 
as that seen in the placebo group of the recent 
multicenter trial of adjunctive glucocorticoids in 
which the same antifungal regimen was used.20
The results were consistent with those in 
animal models and in our phase 2 studies10-13 
and may reflect, at least in part, a balance be-
tween the rate of clearance of infection and the 
drug-related side effects. Flucytosine as the part-
ner drug with amphotericin B was associated 
with more rapid clearance of infection than 
fluconazole and had a similar side-effect profile, 
as was previously shown in a study in Vietnam.14 
Clearance of infection was as rapid in the 1-week 
amphotericin B groups as it was in the 2-week 
amphotericin B groups, and, as expected, the 
shorter regimens had fewer side effects, with, 
in particular, less anemia. Our results with 1 
week of amphotericin B–flucytosine lend further 
support to the concept of prolonged efficacy af-
ter an initial loading of brain compartments with 
amphotericin B,13,21 as was also recently shown 
with the use of a single high dose of liposomal 
amphotericin B.22 Of note, we implemented full 
preemptive management and monitoring of am-
photericin B toxic effects.16 It is likely that in 
resource-limited settings, the challenges of trans-
fusion and monitoring would further disadvan-
tage the 2-week amphotericin B regimens, as evi-
denced by the continued very high mortality rates 
reported from African centers where 2 weeks of 
amphotericin B has been used.23,24 The ampho-
tericin B–free oral combination regimen had few 
laboratory-defined side effects and also had effi-
cacy, despite slower clearance of infection.
All the best-performing regimens in our trial 
contained flucytosine. In particular, mortality in 
the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group was 
significantly lower than that in the other am-
photericin B groups, whereas mortality in the 
1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group was 
the highest. It may be that the more effective 
partner drug is particularly important in the con-
text of shorter courses of amphotericin B. In ad-
dition to rapid fungicidal activity, flucytosine may

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
also have other properties, such as a more pro-
longed postantibiotic effect than fluconazole,25 
to help explain this difference.
Despite the fact that patients in resource-
limited settings have access to ART, the incidence 
of cryptococcal meningitis is not decreasing in 
many centers.26,27 Widespread availability of gener-
ic flucytosine is urgently needed as an essential 
part of global programs to reduce HIV-related 
mortality, as is continued investigation into new 
drug therapies. Efforts by international agencies 
to make flucytosine available are gaining mo-
mentum.7,15,28,29
In conclusion, in our trial, 1 week of ampho-
tericin B plus flucytosine was the most effective 
option for induction therapy for patients with HIV-
associated cryptococcal meningitis in resource-
limited settings. Our results also suggest that in 
the absence of availability of amphotericin B or 
in conditions in which amphotericin B cannot be 
administered safely, the oral combination of 
fluconazole plus flucytosine provides an effec-
tive and sustainable alternative.
