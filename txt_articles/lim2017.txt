IMPORTANCE Thyroid cancer incidence has increased substantially in the United States over
the last 4 decades, driven largely by increases in papillary thyroid cancer. It is unclear whether
the increasing incidence of papillary thyroid cancer has been related to thyroid cancer
mortality trends.
OBJECTIVE To compare trends in thyroid cancer incidence and mortality by tumor
characteristics at diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Trends in thyroid cancer incidence and incidence-based
mortality rates were evaluated using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results-9 (SEER-9) cancer registry program, and annual percent change in rates
was calculated using log-linear regression.
EXPOSURE Tumor characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual percent changes in age-adjusted thyroid cancer
incidence and incidence-based mortality rates by histologic type and SEER stage for cases
diagnosed during 1974-2013.
RESULTS Among 77 276 patients (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 48 [16] years; 58 213 [75%]
women) diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 1974-2013, papillary thyroid cancer was the
most common histologic type (64 625 cases), and 2371 deaths from thyroid cancer occurred
during 1994-2013. Thyroid cancer incidence increased, on average, 3.6% per year (95% CI,
3.2%-3.9%) during 1974-2013 (from 4.56 per 100 000 person-years in 1974-1977 to 14.42
per 100 000 person-years in 2010-2013), primarily related to increases in papillary thyroid
cancer (annual percent change, 4.4% [95% CI, 4.0%-4.7%]). Papillary thyroid cancer
incidence increased for all SEER stages at diagnosis (4.6% per year for localized, 4.3% per
year for regional, 2.4% per year for distant, 1.8% per year for unknown). During 1994-2013,
incidence-based mortality increased 1.1% per year (95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%) (from 0.40 per
100 000 person-years in 1994-1997 to 0.46 per 100 000 person-years in 2010-2013) overall
and 2.9% per year (95% CI, 1.1%-4.7%) for SEER distant stage papillary thyroid cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients in the United States diagnosed with thyroid
cancer from 1974-2013, the overall incidence of thyroid cancer increased 3% annually, with
increases in the incidence rate and thyroid cancer mortality rate for advanced-stage papillary
thyroid cancer. These findings are consistent with a true increase in the occurrence of thyroid
cancer in the United States.

I
n the United States, thyroid cancer incidence rates have
increased by 211% between 1975 and 2013, with papillary
thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common and least-
aggressive histologic type, accounting for most of the new
cases.1 Some investigators have suggested that overdiagno-
sis, or the increased ability to detect and diagnose small indo-
lent tumors that would never otherwise cause symptoms
or require treatment, explains a substantial proportion of
the increase.2-5
However,growingevidencesupportsatrueincreaseinthe
occurrence of thyroid cancer. An analysis of Surveillance,
Epidemiology,andEndResults(SEER)cancerregistrydatafrom
1980-2005 revealed substantial increases in the incidence of
advanced-stage PTCs and PTCs greater than 5 cm in diameter;
these tumors are generally large enough to be detected via
palpation, to cause symptoms, or both.6 The rates of increase
forthelargest(>5cm)andthesmallestPTCs(≤1cm)werenearly
equal among white women, a group considered to be particu-
larly susceptible to overdiagnosis.6 Although thyroid cancer
mortality rates are much lower relative to incidence, provid-
ingtheimpressionofstabilityovertime,2-5thyroidcancermor-
tality rates have increased significantly since the late 1980s
(0.7% per year; P < .001).1 These trends are consistent with
temporal changes in the prevalence of some risk factors,
including obesity and noncurrent smoking.7
Because advanced-stage PTC is less amenable to treat-
ment than localized PTC, the increasing mortality rates may
be a direct consequence of the trends in advanced-stage PTC.
To address this question, the current analysis used SEER data
during 1974-2013 to compare thyroid cancer incidence and
mortality trends by demographic and tumor characteristics at
the time of diagnosis.
Methods
Data Sources
Thyroid cancer cases diagnosed during 1974-2013 were ascer-
tained from the SEER cancer incidence file maintained by
the National Cancer Institute.8 The file includes information
from 9 high-quality, population-based registries (SEER-9;
California [San Francisco and Oakland], Connecticut,
Georgia [Atlanta only], Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan [Detroit only],
New Mexico, Utah, and Washington [Seattle and Puget Sound
region]) that include approximately 10% of the US popula-
tion. Demographic and cancer diagnosis information was
available for each case. Data regarding nationwide and
SEER-9 thyroid cancer deaths were derived from information
recorded in death certificates and ascertained from the
National Center for Health Statistics.9
The incidence-based mortality file uses cancer registry in-
formation from the SEER-9 cancer incidence file to link char-
acteristics of the cancer at diagnosis with death certificate
information.10,11 Thus, unlike traditional mortality rates,
incidence-based mortality rates can be examined according to
variables recorded at diagnosis (eg, histology, stage, tumor
size). The incidence-based mortality analysis was restricted to
deaths during 1994-2013 and diagnoses during 1974-2013
to ensure maximum data for those deaths and to prevent un-
derestimation of the incidence-based mortality rates in the
earliest years.
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics of interest for this analysis in-
cluded sex, race, and age at diagnosis. This information was
originally abstracted from medical records and submitted to
regional or state cancer registries. Information on age at thy-
roid cancer death was abstracted from death certificates.
Tumor Characteristics
Thyroid cancer cases (International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology, Third Edition; topography code C73) were clas-
sified according to histologic type12: PTC (histologic codes
8050, 8260, 8340-8344, 8350, 8450-8460), follicular thyroid
cancer (8290, 8330-8335), medullary thyroid cancer (8345,
8510-8513), anaplastic thyroid cancer (8020-8035), and oth-
ers (including unspecified, poorly specified [eg, insular
{8337}], and others).
SEER Historic Stage A was used to classify cases according
to stage at diagnosis: localized (limited to the thyroid gland),
regional(tumorextensionbeyondthelimitsofthethyroidgland
or spread by more than 1 lymphatic or vascular supply route),
distant (extracervical metastasis), and unknown stage.13 Be-
ginning in 2004, diagnosed cases additionally were classified
as stage I-IV (or unknown) according to the American Joint
Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control
(AJCC/UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system
(AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th Edition), which accounts for
age at diagnosis (<45 and ≥45 years for PTC and follicular thy-
roid cancer), tumor size (T stage), extent of spread to the re-
gional lymph nodes (N stage), and presence or absence of dis-
tant metastases (M stage).14 Although AJCC/TNM stage
information was not available for the entire study period, it is
thestagingsystemmostusedforthyroidcancerinclinicalprac-
tice and is more readily interpretable than SEER stage.
Tumor size has been recorded in SEER since 1983 using 3
different schemes: Extent of Disease-4 codes for 1983-1987,
Extent of Disease-10 codes for 1988-2003, and Collaborative
Staging codes for 2004-2013. These codes were combined to
categorize cases diagnosed during 1983-2013 by tumor size.15
Key Points
Question What have been the trends in US thyroid cancer
incidence and mortality, and have they differed by tumor
characteristics at diagnosis?
Findings In this analysis of 77 276 thyroid cancer patients
diagnosed during 1974-2013 and of 2371 thyroid cancer deaths
during 1994-2013, average annual increases in incidence and
mortality rates, respectively, were 3.6% and 1.1% overall and 2.4%
and 2.9% for patients diagnosed with advanced-stage papillary
thyroid cancer.
Meaning Thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates have
increased for patients diagnosed with advanced-stage papillary
thyroid cancer in the United States since 1974, suggesting a true
increase in the occurrence of thyroid cancer.

Data Analysis
Only microscopically confirmed cases and the first matching
record were selected, and cases identified only from autopsy
recordsordeathcertificateswereexcluded.Incidenceandmor-
tality rates were calculated using SEER*Stat version 8.3.2.16 All
rates were age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population
and expressed per 100 000 person-years. Incidence-based
mortality rates were calculated as number of thyroid cancer
deaths among cases diagnosed in the SEER-9 registries over
person-time at risk among individuals in the SEER areas. Stan-
dardized dimensions were used for the y-axes and x-axes, in
which a slope of 10 degrees represented a change of 1% per
year.17 Rates for thyroid cancers with missing or unknown his-
tology, stage, or size were calculated and plotted separately
from the known values. Rate differences were calculated to
evaluate the degree to which reductions or increases in rates
for thyroid cancers with unknown stage or size may have af-
fected trends for thyroid cancers with known values.
The National Cancer Institute’
s Joinpoint Regression
Analysis program, version 4.2.0, was used to calculate
annual percentage changes (APCs) and 95% CIs to quantify
trends in incidence and mortality overall and by demo-
graphic and tumor characteristics using t tests to determine
whether APCs were statistically significantly different from
zero.18 The program also selected the best-fitting log-linear
regression model to identify calendar years (ie, the join-
points) when APCs changed significantly, allowing for the
minimum number of joinpoints necessary to fit the data.18
Statistical significance was assessed at an α level of P < .05,
and all hypotheses were 2-sided.
Results
Of the 79 409 thyroid cancer cases diagnosed among resi-
dents of the SEER-9 areas during 1974-2013, 77 276 (97%) met
the case definition and were included in the incidence analy-
sis (Table 1). Women (58 213 [75%]) and white patients
(63 479] 82%) comprised the majority of the cases. Mean (SD)
age at diagnosis was 48 (16) years. The most common histo-
logic types were PTC (84%) and follicular thyroid cancer
(11%). Of the eligible cases, 2371 died of thyroid cancer during
1994-2013 and were included in the incidence-based mortal-
ity analysis. Of the deaths, 57% occurred among women
and 81% among white patients. Compared with all cases,
patients who died of thyroid cancer were more likely to have
been diagnosed at older ages; with non-PTC histologies; and
with advanced-stage tumors, larger tumors, or both. Among
those who died of thyroid cancer, the median time between
thyroid cancer diagnosis and death was 25 months; 19% sur-
vived more than 10 years after diagnosis. Among PTC
patients who died of thyroid cancer, 27% survived more than
10 years after diagnosis.
Of the 77 276 cases occurring during 1974-2013, 10% were
diagnosed in years prior to the availability of tumor size data
starting in 1983, and 51% were diagnosed prior to the avail-
ability of AJCC/TNM stage information starting in 2004
(Table 1). Of the 2371 incidence-based mortality deaths occur-
ring during 1994-2013, 3% were diagnosed in years prior to
the availability of tumor size data and 66% were diagnosed
prior to the availability of AJCC/TNM stage information. Dur-
ing the years in which specific tumor characteristics were
reported to the registries, SEER stage (1974-2013) was
unknown for 2% of cases and 5% of deaths, tumor size (1983-
2013) was unknown for 13% of cases and 31% of deaths, and
AJCNN/TNM stage (2004-2013) was unknown for 5% of cases
and 6% of deaths.
A comparison of the agreement between SEER Historic
Stage A, tumor size, and AJCC/TNM stage among PTC cases
diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 by age (<45 and ≥45
years) is shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. In general,
more advanced stage was associated with larger tumor size.
There was greater agreement of SEER stage with size and
AJCC/TNM stage for patients aged 45 years and older com-
pared with younger patients, which reflects the differences in
AJCC/TNM staging guidelines for PTC patients diagnosed
before and after age 45 years.14
Trends in thyroid cancer incidence by demographic and
tumor characteristics are described in Table 2, with join-
points denoted as trends 1 to 5. Trends by selected tumor
characteristics are shown graphically in Figure 1. Thyroid
cancer incidence rates increased over the study period (from
4.56 [95% CI, 4.40 to 4.73] per 100 000 person-years in 1974-
1977 to 14.42 [95% CI, 14.20 to 14.64] per 100 000 person-
years in 2010-2013), increasing 3.6% (95% CI, 3.2% to 3.9%)
per year, on average. Rates increased 6.7% (95% CI, 6.1% to
7.2%) per year during 1997-2009, but did not increase during
2009-2013 (APC, 1.8% [95% CI, −0.7% to −4.4%]). Thyroid
cancer incidence rates increased for all sex, race, and age
groups. Significant increases were observed for PTC (APC,
4.4% [95% CI, 4.0% to 4.7%]), follicular thyroid cancer (APC,
0.6% [95% CI, 0.2% to 0.8%]), and medullary thyroid cancer
(APC, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2% to 1.1%]). PTC incidence increased
significantly for every stage and tumor size category. During
2009-2013, incidence rates did not increase significantly for
overall, localized, stage I, or small (≤2 cm) PTCs, while there
was no evidence of a reduction in the increase for regional,
distant, or large PTCs.
Thyroid cancer incidence-based mortality rates were un-
derestimated in the earliest calendar years, but consistent with
observednationwideandSEER-9thyroidcancermortalityrates
during 1994-2013 (Figure 2; eTable 2 in the Supplement). Thy-
roid cancer incidence-based mortality increased, on average,
1.1%(95%CI,0.6%to1.6%)annuallyduring1994-2013(Table3;
Figure2),from0.40(95%CI,0.36to0.44)per100 000person-
years in 1994-1997 to 0.46 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.50) per 100 000
person-years in 2010-2013. Positive APCs were observed for
most demographic subgroups and statistically significant
for patients who were female, white, black, and diagnosed af-
ter age 79 years. By histologic type, the annual increase in in-
cidence-based mortality rates was restricted to patients diag-
nosed with PTC (1.7% [95% CI, 0.6% to 2.9%). Positive APCs
were observed for PTCs of all known stages at diagnosis,
but were statistically significant only for patients with dis-
tant disease (APC, 2.9% [95% CI, 1.1% to 4.7%]), stage IV
disease (APC, 12.9% [95% CI, 7.2% to 19.0%]), or both (Table 3;

Figure 2). Positive APCs occurred for PTCs of all known sizes,
with significant increases for tumors smaller than or equal to
2 cm and tumors that were greater than 2 cm to less than or
equal to 4 cm (Table 3; Figure 2).
Rate differences were calculated for PTCs by known and
unknown values of SEER stage and tumor size (eTables 3 and
4 in the Supplement). The incidence rate for unstaged PTC
increased by 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.10) from 1974-1977 to
2010-2013, indicating that the observed increase in PTC with
known SEER stage was underestimated by this amount. PTC
with unknown tumor size declined by 0.57 (95% CI, 0.49 to
0.65) from 1994-1997 to 2010-2013, which may have overes-
timated the observed increase in PTC with known tumor size
by this amount; however, apart from PTCs greater than 4 cm,
the observed increases for PTCs with known tumor sizes
were much larger. The unstaged PTC mortality rate declined
by −0.01 (95% CI, −0.01 to 0.01) from 1994-1997 to 2010-
2013, indicating that the increase in mortality for PTCs with
known SEER stage was overestimated by this amount. The
mortality rate for PTCs with unknown tumor size decreased
by 0.02 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.04) since 1998-2001, which may
have overestimated mortality rates for PTC with known
tumor size by this amount.
The annual numbers of cases or deaths and incidence and
incidence-based mortality rates used in this analysis are pro-
vided in eTables 5-16 in the Supplement.

characteristics at diagnosis and to systematically compare
trends in thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates by these
characteristics. The main finding from this study was the sig-
nificant increase in thyroid cancer incidence-based mortality
from1994to2013(approximately1.1%peryear)forthyroidcan-
cer patients overall and for those who were diagnosed with
advanced-stage PTC (2.9% per year). This finding appears to
be associated with the increasing incidence of advanced-
stage PTC (3.5% per year since 1981).
The results of this study challenge the prevailing notion
that all of the increase in PTC incidence in the United States
is related to overdiagnosis,2,4,19 resulting from the introduc-
tion and increasing widespread use of diagnostic ultrasound
and other imaging modalities and fine-needle aspiration
biopsies that have allowed for incidental detection and diag-
nosis of mostly indolent localized cancers, small (<2 cm) can-
cers, or both.20 Such changes could account for the rapid
increases in the incidence rates for localized and small PTCs
that have been previously observed.2,4,6,19,21 Likewise, the
deceleration in rates for localized but not advanced PTC inci-
dence rates since 2009, as observed previously,19,21 may
be explained by less-aggressive diagnostic workup of small
thyroid tumors in recent years due to rising awareness of
problems associated with overtreatment of low-risk thyroid
cancers.15,19,22 However, the significant, albeit less-rapid
increase in advanced-stage and larger PTC incidence rates
and increasing thyroid cancer mortality rates among pa-
tients diagnosed with advanced-stage PTC is not consistent
with the notion that overdiagnosis is solely responsible for
the changing trends in PTC incidence. Thus, trends in PTC

incidence may be explained by 2 underlying processes: the
dominant one is overdiagnosis, and the other is a small but
actual increase in PTC incidence, possibly resulting from
changes in exposure to environmental risk factors.7
Additional epidemiological research is needed to identify
the specific environmental factors that have contributed to
increasing rates of PTC, namely, those with greater aggressive
potential. Ionizing radiation exposure in childhood is the
most established risk factor for PTC,23 and exposure has
increased in the US general population in recent decades pri-
marily because of more widespread use of diagnostic medical
examinations.24 However, studies of changes in radiation-
related somatic mutations have shown declines in the pro-
portion of PTCs with radiation signatures, such as RET/PTC
rearrangements over time; whereas point mutations, such as
BRAF or RAS, which are more likely to have a nonradiation
etiology, have increased.25-28
There is growing evidence suggesting that changes in obe-
sity and smoking prevalence have contributed to increasing
thyroid cancer rates.7 Paralleling trends in thyroid cancer in-
cidence, obesity prevalence has increased 3-fold among US
adults between 1960 and 2012, with the fastest rate of in-
crease between 1980 and 2010.29 In contrast, the prevalence
of daily cigarette smoking has significantly decreased in the
United States since 1980.30 Epidemiological studies have con-
sistently found positive associations between excess adipos-
ity in childhood and adulthood and subsequent risk of thy-
roid cancer, including PTC,31,32 whereas current smoking
consistently has been associated with a 30% to 40% reduc-
tion in thyroid cancer risk, independent of obesity and other
riskfactors.33Obesityandsmokingcouldinfluencethyroidcan-
cer development via insulin resistance, thyroid hormone, and
estrogen-related pathways.34,35 Together, these factors have
been estimated to be related to more than 40% of all new cases
of thyroid cancer annually in the United States.7
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (eg, pesticides, bisphe-
nol A) also have been suspected to contribute to thyroid can-
cer incidence trends through their effects on thyroid hor-
mone metabolism.36 However, evidence in support of a causal
associationbetweenenvironmentalchemicalsandthyroidcan-
cer risk is currently lacking, largely due to the challenges in
studying exposures that are ubiquitous and for which long-
term exposure is extremely difficult to measure accurately.
The increasing mortality rates among patients with
advanced-stage PTC suggest that for patients with these high-
risk tumors, there should be renewed focus on aggressive
transdisciplinary management that includes surgery, adju-
vant radioactive iodine, and, when indicated for the 5% to
10% of patients who develop progressive disease, systemic
therapy. Although there is continued debate about the appro-
priate extent of surgery for low-risk tumors, recent clinical
guidelines suggest that total thyroidectomy and adjuvant ra-
dioactive iodine are indicated for high-risk disease.15 Thor-

advanced, iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer in-
cluding PTC, but neither has been shown yet to afford a sur-
vival advantage, likely due to the indolent natural history of
thedisease.37,38Clinicaltrialstooptimizethedevelopmentand
use of novel systemic therapies are necessary.
This study has several important limitations. Due to the
descriptive nature of this study, it is only possible to specu-
late about potential explanations for the observed thyroid
cancer trends. Individual-level environmental exposures and
lifestyle-related factors were not captured by registries, nor
were methods of thyroid cancer detection. Although changes
in mortality and incidence-based mortality rates capture
secular trends in detection, diagnosis, case ascertainment,
and treatment and associated survival, the current study did
not evaluate the influence of treatment on these trends.
Analyses relying on tumor size and AJCC/TNM stage data
were restricted to the years in which the information was
reported to the registries. APC estimates for incidence-based
mortality by tumor size and AJCC/TNM stage may be artifi-
cially inflated because this information was only available
for cases diagnosed during 1983-2013 and 2004-2013, leav-
ing a shorter latency period between diagnosis and death;
however, the results generally agree with estimates by
SEER stage. The results of an analysis evaluating the relation-
ship of unknown data on tumor stage and size during the
study period with the observed trends suggest that the
increasing incidence rates of PTC with unknown SEER stage
information underestimated, rather than overestimated, the
true increase in PTC incidence for known SEER stages.
Unknown SEER stage data could only explain, at most,
approximately one-third of the observed increase in mortal-
ity due to advanced-stage PTC. Because specimens have
been cut more finely and smaller tumors that are incidental
findings have become better documented, the reduction in
unknown size data over time most likely overestimated the
observed trends for the smallest rather than largest PTCs.
Additionally, some results were based on small numbers of
cases or deaths. It will be important to continue monitoring
thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates over time to see
if the observed trends persist.
Conclusions
Among patients in the United States diagnosed with thyroid
cancer from 1974-2013, the overall incidence of thyroid can-
cer increased 3% annually, with increases in the incidence rate
and thyroid cancer mortality rate for advanced-stage PTC.
These findings are consistent with a true increase in the
occurrence of thyroid cancer in the United States.
