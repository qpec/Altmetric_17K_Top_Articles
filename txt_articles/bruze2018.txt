IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is a life-changing treatment for patients with severe obesity,
but little is known about its association with interpersonal relationships.
OBJECTIVES To investigate if relationship status is altered after bariatric surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Changes in relationship status after bariatric surgery
were examined in 2 cohorts: (1) the prospective Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, which
recruited patients undergoing bariatric surgery from September 1, 1987, to January 31, 2001,
and compared their care with usual nonsurgical care in matched obese control participants;
and (2) participants from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg), a prospective,
electronically captured register that recruited patients from January 2007 through December
2012 and selected comparator participants from the general population matched on age, sex,
and place of residence. Data was collected in surgical departments and primary health care
centers in Sweden. The current analysis includes data collected up until July 2015 (SOS) and
December 2012 (SOReg). Data analysis was completed from June 2016 to December 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In the SOS study, information on relationship status was
obtained from questionnaires. In the SOReg and general population cohort, information on
marriage and divorce was obtained from the Swedish Total Population Registry.
RESULTS The SOS study included 1958 patients who had bariatric surgery (of whom 1389
[70.9%] were female) and 1912 matched obese controls (of whom 1354 [70.8%] were
female) and had a median (range) follow-up of 10 (0.5-20) years. The SOReg cohort included
29 234 patients who had gastric bypass surgery (of whom 22 131 [75.6%] were female) and
283 748 comparators from the general population (of whom 214 342 [75.5%] were female),
and had a median (range) follow-up of 2.9 (0.003-7.0) years. In the SOS study, the surgical
patients received gastric banding (n = 368; 18.8%), vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 1331;
68.0%), or gastric bypass (n = 259; 13.2%); controls received usual obesity care. In SOReg, all
29 234 surgical participants received gastric bypass surgery. In the SOS study, bariatric
surgery was associated with increased incidence of divorce/separation compared with
controls for those in a relationship (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60;
P = .03) and increased incidence of marriage or new relationship (aHR = 2.03; 95% CI,
1.52-2.71; P < .001) in those who were unmarried or single at baseline. In the SOReg and
general population cohort, gastric bypass was associated with increased incidence of divorce
compared with married control participants (aHR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.33-1.49; P < .001) and
increased incidence of marriage in those who were unmarried at baseline (aHR = 1.35; 95%
CI, 1.28-1.42; P < .001). Within the surgery groups, changes in relationship status were more
common in those with larger weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In addition to its association with obesity comorbidities,
bariatric surgery–induced weight loss is also associated with changes in relationship status.

ariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity that
results in durable weight loss and positive association
with obesity-related morbidities.1,2 There has been a
worldwide increase in the number of persons undergoing this
treatment in recent years, and in 2013, nearly 470 000 bariat-
ric procedures were performed globally.3 However, while the
associations of bariatric surgery with many disease outcomes
arewell-documented,informationaboutthepsychosocialout-
comes of bariatric surgery is more limited.4,5 Available evi-
dence suggests that most aspects of quality of life are im-
proved after bariatric surgery.6,7 However, increased incidence
of alcohol and substance abuse after some types of surgery, as
well as signs of an increased risk of suicide, have been
reported.8-12
An early qualitative study reported that bariatric surgery
puts tension on the patients’family relationships and might
lead to divorce.13 Divorces after bariatric surgery were there-
after mostly attributed to poorly working marriages in which
the extra tension associated with the aftermath of surgery led
to divorce.14 A more recent and comprehensive qualitative
study15 indicates that there are additional changes in marital
and relational dynamics after the bariatric procedure. A nar-
rative review from 201516 highlights the fact that studies of
marital relations in patients who have had bariatric surgery
are few and limited in scope, and the results should be
interpreted with caution. To our knowledge, no studies
have investigated whether bariatric surgery is associated
with altered chances of finding a new partner. The aim of
this study was to analyze changes in relationship status
after bariatric surgery in 2 Swedish cohorts with long-term
follow-up.
Methods
Data used in this study are from the Swedish Obese Subjects
(SOS) study and a register linkage that combined the Scandi-
navian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg)17 with general popu-
lation comparators from the Swedish Total Population
Registry.18 The SOS study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(identifier: NCT01479452) and was approved by 7 local ethics
review boards (Gothenburg, Lund, Lindköping, Örebro, Karo-
linskaInstitute,Uppsala,andUmeå).Allparticipantsgavewrit-
ten or oral informed consent. The SOReg study was approved
by the regional ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden. All
analyses in the SOReg and general population cohort were per-
formed on deidentified data, obviating the need for informed
consent.
Study Cohorts
The SOS study is a prospective, matched intervention trial, and
its design has been described previously.19 In brief, 2010 par-
ticipantswhochosebariatricsurgeryformedthesurgerygroup,
and a contemporaneously matched control group (n = 2037)
was created using 18 matching variables (sex, age, weight,
height, waist and hip circumferences, systolic blood pres-
sure, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, smoking sta-
tus, diabetes, menopausal status, 4 psychosocial variables
[social support, life events, health perception, and psychoso-
cial functioning], and 2 personality traits [monotony avoid-
ance and psychasthenia]). In the surgery group, 265 partici-
pants (13.2%) underwent gastric bypass, 376 participants
(18.7%) underwent gastric banding, and 1369 participants
(68.1%) had vertical banded gastroplasty. The control group re-
ceived the customary treatment for obesity at their primary
health care centers.
Power calculation for the SOS study was based on the pri-
mary outcome, which was overall mortality. The inclusion cri-
teria in both surgery and control groups were an age between
37 and 60 years and a body mass index (BMI, calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of
34 or more for men and 38 or more for women. Both study
groupshadidenticalfollow-upwithphysicalexaminationsand
questionnaires at baseline and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15,
and 20 years. Participants were recruited between Septem-
ber 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001. In the current analysis, the
median follow-up time was 10 years, with follow-up exami-
nations occurring until July 1, 2015. This analysis includes 1958
patients who had gastric banding (n = 368 [18.8%]), vertical
banded gastroplasty (n = 1331 [68.0%]), or gastric bypass
(n = 259 [13.2%]) and 1912 matched, obese controls who had
known relationship status at baseline and follow-up.
Inaddition,thisstudyincorporateddatafromSOReg,apro-
spective, electronically captured register for bariatric surgery
in which data are stored as part of clinical practice. In brief,
SOReg was started in 2007 and is estimated to cover 98.5% of
all bariatric procedures in Sweden.17 In this study, we used data
from January 2007 through December 2012. In the current
analysis, all the 29 234 SOReg participants older than 18 years
who had undergone a gastric bypass operation, of whom 12 531
were married and 16 703 were unmarried at baseline, were in-
cluded. For comparisons of changes in relationship status
after bariatric surgery with a general population sample, we
matched up to 10 comparators from the Swedish Total Popu-
lation Registry18 to each included patient who had under-
gone gastric bypass, using birth year, sex, and place of resi-
dence (parish). Extended descriptions of the SOS, SOReg, and
general population groups can be found in eAppendix 1 and 2
in the Supplement.
Main Outcome Measures and Follow-Up
Relationship status was not a predefined end point in either
the SOS study or the SOReg and general population cohort. For
Key Points
Question Is there an association between bariatric surgery and
changes in relationship status?
Findings In this study of 2 large Swedish cohorts with long-term
follow-up, bariatric surgery was associated with increased
incidence of divorce and separation as well as increased incidence
of marriage and new relationship.
Meaning In addition to its associations with obesity
comorbidities, bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is also
associated with changes in relationship status.

 the current analysis, the main outcome measure in the SOS
cohort was self-reported relationship status (questionnaires
atbaselineand0.5,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,15,and20yearsafterbase-
line data collection). Relationship status was defined by re-
sponse to the questions: (1) are you currently living with a
spouse/partner? and (2) Have you gone through a divorce or
separated since the previous questionnaire? A positive reply
to the first question was interpreted as being married or in a
cohabiting relationship. The main outcome measures in the
SOReg and general population cohort were date of legal mar-
riage or divorce, as recorded in the Swedish Total Population
Registry.
In the analysis of divorce/separation, participants who
were widowed were included in the analysis until the date of
the death of their spouse and thereafter censored from the
analysis. In the SOS cohort, if no separation was reported, the
participant was censored at the most recent questionnaire.
Participants were also censored at date of emigration or
death. Participants in the SOS control group who underwent
bariatric surgery and participants in the SOS surgery group
who underwent surgical reversal to normal anatomy (eg,
band removal) were censored from analysis at the time of
surgery.
Covariates
Body mass index data were based on measured heights and
weights; these data were not available for the general popu-
lation.IntheSOScohort,educationlevelwasself-reportedand,
in the SOReg and general population cohort, data on the level
of educational attainment were retrieved from the Swedish
Register of Education. Information on previous divorce/
separationandyearslivingtogether/marriedwasbasedonself-
reported data in the SOS cohort and on data from the Swedish
Total Population Registry in the SOReg and general popula-
tion cohort. Self-reported data on perceived family relations
on a 4-grade scale (very good, good, not so good, and not good
at all) were available in the SOS cohort but were analyzed here
as a dichotomous variable by combining the 2 best and 2 worst
responses. Information on participants becoming a widow/
widower was based on self-reported data (in the SOS cohort)
and on data from the Swedish Total Population Registry (in the
SOReg and general population cohorts). Data on health care
visits for substance abuse were retrieved from the National Pa-
tient Register (which includes inpatient data from 1969 to De-
cember31,2014,andhospital-basedoutpatientdatafrom2001
to December 31, 2014) and converted into a dichotomous vari-
able, as previously described.12 Data on psychotropic drug use
before inclusion were retrieved from self-reported data (in the
SOS cohort) and from the Prescribed Drug Register (in the
SOReg and general population cohort; this register started on
July 1, 2005, and data up till September 30, 2015, were used)
and converted into a dichotomous variable, as previously
described.12
Statistical Analyses
To analyze the association of bariatric surgery with relation-
ship status, the study cohorts were divided according to
whether the participants were married or in a relationship or
not at baseline. Time to change in relationship status in the
surgery and control groups was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier
estimates of cumulative incidence and Cox proportional haz-
ard models (expressed as hazard ratios [HR] with 95% CIs). Un-
adjusted univariate analysis comparing surgical participants
with control group participants, as well as multivariate analy-
sis with adjustment for preselected baseline factors known to
influence relationship status (age, sex, BMI [in the SOS co-
hort only], education level, previous divorce/separation, time
in current relationship, substance abuse, psychotropic medi-
cation, and perceived family relation quality [in the SOS co-
hort only]) were performed.
Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata, version
14 (StataCorp) and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Two-
sided tests with a 5% α level were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Relationship Status and Characteristics at Baseline
IntheSOSstudy,2871ofthe3870includedparticipants(74.2%)
were married or living in a relationship at baseline (Table).
There were no major differences in characteristics between the
surgery and control groups, with the exception that univer-
sity education was more common and previous divorce/
separation less common in the control group compared with
the surgery group (Table).
In the SOReg cohort, 12 531 of the 29 234 included partici-
pants (42.9%) were married at baseline (Table). Use of psy-
chotropic drugs and substance abuse were more common in
thesurgerygroupcomparedwiththegeneralpopulationgroup,
both among those who were married or unmarried at base-
line. University education was more common in the general
population group compared with the surgery group (Table).
Marriages and New Relationships After Surgery
Among the 999 SOS study participants who were single at
baseline, the incidence of marriage/new relationship was
higher after bariatric surgery (n = 152 events; incidence rate/
1000 person-years, 38.0) compared with controls (n = 76
events; incident rate [IR]/1000 person-years, 19.1;
HR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.48-2.57; P < .001; Figure 1A), and this
remained statistically significant after adjustment (adjusted
HR [aHR] = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.52-2.71; P < .001; eTable 1 in the
Supplement). After 4 years, the cumulative incidence of
marriage/new relationship was 20.9% (n = 98 events) in the
surgery group compared with 11.2% (n = 47 events) in the
control group, and at 10 years, it was 34.8% (n = 146 events)
in the surgery group compared with 19.4% (n = 70 events) in
the control group.
The incidence of marriage in the SOReg and general popu-
lation cohort was higher in those who had gastric bypass
(n = 1895 events; IR/1000 person-years, 39.1) than in general
population comparison group (n = 14612 events; IR/1000 per-
son-years, 31.6; HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18.-1.30; P < .001;
Figure 1B; aHR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.28-1.42; P < .001; eTable 1 in
the Supplement). After 4 years, the cumulative incidence of

 marriage was 14.6% (n = 1771 events) in SOReg cohort com-
pared with 11.8% (n = 13661 events) in the general popula-
tion.
In both study cohorts, the multivariate analyses show that
younger age and previous divorce/separation were signifi-
cantly associated with increased incidence of marriage/new
relationship (in the SOS cohort) and marriage (in the SOReg
and general population cohort) (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
In the SOReg and general population cohort, a history of sub-
stance abuse and psychotropic medication use were associ-
ated with a decreased incidence of marriage (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).

 In the SOS surgery group, those whose 1-year weight loss
reached or exceeded the median level of 25.0% of body weight
had higher incidence of marriage/new relationship (HR = 1.94;
95% CI, 1.32-2.84; P < .001; aHR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.33-2.93;
P < .001) compared with those with weight loss of less than
the median level (Figure 2A and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
In the SOReg cohort, those whose 1-year weight loss reached
or exceeded the median level of 31.8% of body weight had a
higher incidence of marriage (HR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20-1.51;

Separations and Divorces After Surgery
Among the 2871 participants in the SOS cohort who were mar-
ried or were living in a relationship at baseline, bariatric sur-
gery was associated with increased incidence of divorce/
separation (n = 235 events; IR/1000 person-years, 16.5)
compared with controls (n = 142 events; IR/1000 person-
years, 11.1; HR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.25-1.90; P < .001; Figure 3A),
andthisremainedstatisticallysignificantaftermultivariatead-
justment (aHR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60; P = .03; eTable 1 in the

vorce/separationwas9.4%(n = 128events)inthesurgerygroup
compared with 5.5% (n = 71 events) in the control group, and
after 10 years it was 17.1% (n = 211 events) in the surgery group
compared with 11.6% (n = 126 events) in the control group.
The incidence of divorce in the SOReg and general popu-
lation cohort was higher in those who underwent gastric by-
pass (n = 1380 events; IR/1000 person-years, 37.8) than in the
generalpopulationcomparators(n = 8221events;IR/1000per-
son-years, 21.7; HR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.64-1.84; P < .001;

tivariate adjustments (aHR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.33-1.49; P < .001);

incidenceofdivorcewas14.4%(n = 1289events)inSORegcom-
pared with 8.2% (n = 7657 events) in the general population.
In both study cohorts, the multivariate analyses show that
younger age, previous divorce/separation, and shorter time in
a relationship/marriage were significantly associated with in-
creased incidence of divorce/separation (in the SOS study) or
divorce (in the SOReg and general population cohort) (eTable
1 in the Supplement). In the SOS study, poor family relations
before surgery were a strong predictor of divorce/separation
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). In the SOReg and general popu-
lation cohort, a history of substance abuse and psychotropic
medication use were associated with an increased incidence
of divorce (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
In the SOS surgery group, the association between weight
loss and incidence of divorce/separation was not statistically
significant (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.91-1.63; P = 0.18; aHR, 1.31; 95%
CI, 0.96–1.77; P = 0.08; Figure 4A; eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). However, in the SOReg cohort, those whose 1-year

 surgery, the desire to find a partner is sometimes mentioned
among other secondary motivators.20,21 Our results clearly
indicate that there is an increased incidence of marriage
(compared with the general population) and an increased
incidence of marriage/new relationship (compared
with controls with obesity) after bariatric surgery. However,
we also show an increased incidence of divorce (compared
with the general population) and increased incidence of
separation/divorce (compared with controls with obesity)
after bariatric surgery among individuals who are married or
in a relationship at the time of surgery. In addition, a large
degree of weight loss is associated with both increased inci-
dence of marriage/new relationship and increased incidence
of divorce.

 The increased incidence of marriage and new relation-
ship after bariatric surgery is in line with previous research
showingthatbariatricsurgeryisassociatedwithincreasedqual-
ity of life,6,7 positive changes in social life,22,23 and increased
romantic interest from others.22,24 These associations may be
enhanced by a large weight loss and hence contribute to the
observed increased incidence of marriage/new relationship.
However, for patients who are in a relationship at the time of
surgery, these changes, as well as the responses of spouses/
partners to these changes, may affect the dynamics of the re-
lationship. Although most postbariatric surgery patients and
their partners report an overall maintained or increased qual-
ity in the relationship,25-27 partners of patients who have un-
dergone bariatric surgery sometimes report feeling jealous or
no longer needed.15,23 Qualitative studies of bariatric surgery
point to the sense of a “joint journey”28(p54) as an important
partofsuccessfulweightlossandweightmaintenance,25,29but
also to maintain a healthy relationship.28,30 To ensure that pa-
tientsabouttoundergobariatricsurgeryandtheirpartnershave
a better chance of handling potential tensions in their rela-
tionship, they should be informed of this risk. On the other
hand, patients who have undergone bariatric surgery might be
empoweredtoleaveanunhealthyrelationship.Ithasbeensug-
gested that bariatric surgery in patients with a poorly work-
ing marriage puts extra tension on the relationship, possibly
leading to divorce.14 This is supported by our observations in
the SOS study, in which poor family relationships before sur-
gerywasthestrongestpredictorofincreasedincidenceofsepa-
ration and divorce. Hence, separation or divorce after bariat-
ric surgery should not only be interpreted as an adverse effect
of the surgery but could also demonstrate that physical and
psychological improvements after bariatric surgery might give
patients in unhealthy relationships the confidence and self-
esteem to end those relationships.
Our results are based on data from 2 large, prospective
Swedish cohorts with long-term follow-up periods. In the SOS
cohort, the data are self-reported and include romantic co-
habitation, with or without legal marriage. In Sweden, couples
often cohabit for several years before marriage or remain
unmarried,31 and information on cohabitation is therefore im-
portant. The data from SOReg and the general population co-
hort are derived from Swedish national registers. Although
these registers have almost 100% coverage, they only in-
clude legal marriages and divorces, and hence couples living
in a relationship without being married and separating from
such relationships are not captured in the SOReg and general
population analyses. This could possibly lead to an underes-
timation of the associations of bariatric surgery with relation-
ships. The SOReg cohort has more participants, more mod-
ernbariatricsurgeryprocedures(ie,gastricbypass),andawider
age span than the SOS study. Thus, the 2 cohorts complement
each other in addressing the question of relationship status af-
ter bariatric surgery. However, the matching procedures, com-
position of the control groups, and end points differ, making
direct comparisons of the results from the 2 cohorts difficult.
Limitations
A limitation of this study is that the included cohorts were not
randomized; the SOS study could not be randomized for ethi-
cal reasons, and the SOReg cohort is a register that captures
patients who undergo bariatric surgery. In addition, our
study only includes persons living in Sweden, and it is
unknown if the results can be generalized to other countries
and cultures.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that bariatric surgery–induced weight loss in-
fluences interpersonal relationships. For persons with obesity
who are single, a better chance of finding a partner might be
added as yet another positive association of bariatric surgery–
induced weight loss. Increased incidence of divorce and sepa-
