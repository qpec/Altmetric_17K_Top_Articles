ABSTRACT
Sulfur mustard (bis 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, SM) is a powerful bi-functional vesicating chemical warfare agent. SM tissue
injury is partially mediated by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species resulting in oxidative stress. We hypothesized
that using a catalytic antioxidant (AEOL 10150) to alleviate oxidative stress and secondary inflammation following exposure
to SM would attenuate the toxic effects of SM inhalation. Adult male rats were intubated and exposed to SM (1.4 mg/kg), a
dose that produces an LD50 at approximately 24 h. Rats were randomized and treated via subcutaneous injection with either
sterile PBS or AEOL 10150 (5 mg/kg, sc, every 4 h) beginning 1 h post-SM exposure. Rats were euthanized between 6 and 48 h
after exposure to SM and survival and markers of injury were determined. Catalytic antioxidant treatment improved
survival after SM inhalation in a dose-dependent manner, up to 52% over SM PBS at 48 h post-exposure. This improvement
was sustained for at least 72 h after SM exposure when treatments were stopped after 48 h. Non-invasive monitoring
throughout the duration of the studies also revealed blood oxygen saturations were improved by 10% and clinical scores
were reduced by 57% after SM exposure in the catalytic antioxidant treatment group. Tissue analysis showed catalytic
antioxidant therapy was able to decrease airway cast formation by 69% at 48 h post-exposure. To investigate antioxidant
induced changes at the peak of injury, several biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated at 24 h
post-exposure. AEOL 10150 attenuated SM-mediated lung lipid oxidation, nitrosative stress and many proinflammatory
cytokines. The findings indicate that catalytic antioxidants may be useful medical countermeasure against inhaled SM
exposure.

Sulfur mustard (SM) is a chemical warfare agent possessing strong
alkylating properties that induces inflammation and tissue necro-
sis. SM exposure produces delayed and highly incapacitating inju-
ries that can be lethal (Anderson, 2015). SM was used during
World War I and is still maintained in the chemical weapons ar-
senals of several countries (Kehe and Szinicz, 2005). A specific and
effective antidote is not available for use after SM exposure
despite research conducted for nearly 100 years (Kehe and Szinicz,
2005). The population most at risk for exposure to SM is comprised
of soldiers and individuals working or living near storage depots,
but SM is also considered to be a potential terrorist threat due to
its low cost of production and simple synthesis.
Sulfur mustard (SM) vapor adversely affects the skin, eyes,
and the
respiratory tract.

 susceptible to SM toxicity, with the majority of historical mor-
tality being attributed to pulmonary injury (Keyser et al., 2014).
Inhaled SM may cause death or the development of severe
chronic airway disorders in survivors (Poursaleh et al., 2012).
Inhaled SM causes acute sloughing of the epithelial surfaces,
formation of occlusive casts, and can lead to chronic respiratory
problems such as bronchiolitis obliterans and COPD (Ghanei
and Harandi, 2011; Veress et al., 2013). A hindrance in develop-
ing treatments for SM inhalation is due to our poor understand-
ing of its pathogenesis. Previous studies suggest that SM
induces oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, DNA dam-
age, and airway coagulation that are all known to play a role in
damage progression (Keyser et al., 2014). Many therapeutics tar-
geting these pathways have been tested and have shown some
promise in in vitro models (Weinberger et al., 2011). Replication
of therapeutic success in most physiologically relevant in vivo
models has been less successful. Expanding our knowledge of
the mechanism through which SM exerts its toxic effects is crit-
ical for further development of rescue therapies.
A major component of SM toxicity is oxidative stress. The
oxidative stress observed in SM toxicity is the result of 3 major
pathways contributing to the disturbance in redox balance.
These are the direct depletion of cellular thiols such as glutathi-
one (GSH), alkylation or oxidation of DNA strands, and lipid per-
oxidation (Dacre and Goldman, 1996; Debiak et al., 2009; Inturi
et al., 2011). DNA damage is considered to be an important as-
pect of SM toxicity and has been noted in all models of SM in-
jury. It is known that DNA can be directly alkylated by SM or its
analogs on guanine residues, and bi-functional sulfur mustard
is capable of cross linking DNA strands (Dacre and Goldman,
1996). One theory of SM toxicity holds that cellular attempts to
repair these DNA adducts/cross-linked strands results in the
over activation of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymer-
ase (PARP) leading to rapid NADþ/ATP depletion leading to cell
death (Korkmaz et al., 2006). Another theory prevalent in the lit-
erature is that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is activated
by mustard agent exposures leading to increased formation of
intracellular peroxynitrite (ONOO�) which can damage lipids,
proteins, and DNA (Sunil et al., 2012). Oxidative stress mechan-
isms may also reinforce tissue inflammation in the progression
of SM induced toxicity.
AEOL 10150 is a metalloporphyrin class of catalytic antioxi-
dants that has shown promising therapeutic potential for sup-
pressing oxidative stress in relevant SM analog, 2-chloroethyl
ethyl sulfide (CEES) models (Gould et al., 2009; O’Neill et al., 2010,
2011; Tewari-Singh et al., 2014). The aim of this study is to char-
acterize the efficacy of this catalytic antioxidant in improving
survival by attenuating the progression of oxidative stress, in-
flammation, and injury following SM inhalation. AEOL 10150
when given after SM inhalation improved survival, blood oxy-
genation, and clinical scores while diminishing markers of oxi-
dative stress and inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. The sulfur mustard agent used in these exposures
was
provided
by
the
U.S.
Army
Edgewood
Research,
Development
and
Engineering
Center
(Aberdeen
Proving
Ground, Maryland) and was military grade. The catalytic antiox-
idant AEOL 10150 (Mn(III) tetrakis(N,N’-diethylimidazolium-2-
yl) porphyrin) was administered subcutaneously as a 5 mg/ml
solution in sterile water for injection and was greater than 98%
purity
(Aeolus
Pharmaceuticals,
Mission
Viejo,
California).
Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals used were from
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri).
Animals and exposures. The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of United States Army Medical Research
Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) approved these stud-
ies. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (200–300 g) from Charles
River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts) were used.
Animals were exposed to SM or vehicle (ethanol, EtOH) at the
USAMRICD Aberdeen Proving Ground using a vapor generator
based model as previously reported (Anderson et al., 1996, 2000,
2009;; Gao et al., 2011; Malaviya et al., 2010; Veress et al., 2015).
Rats were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (80 mg/
kg, IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IM). Anesthetized rats were intu-
bated with a polished glass Pasteur pipette and a PE90 guide
tube. A glass endotracheal tube was used to minimize absorp-
tion of SM. SM (0.35 mg) in absolute ethanol (100 ml) was placed
in a water-jacketed (37 �C) glass vapor generator (Atmar Glass,
Kennett Square, Pennsylvania). The length of the glass endotra-
cheal tube (�5 cm) was determined based on length between
the larynx and the bifurcation of the trachea. Spontaneously
breathing anesthetized rats were connected to these devices
and exposed accordingly for 50 min. By the end of the exposure
period, the SM in ethanol was completely vaporized and
inhaled. This passive exposure system includes an inlet one-
way respiratory check valve (Hans Rudolph, Kansas City,
Missouri) to ensure that the only source of air for the animal
during the exposure was through the vapor generator. Exhaled
air passes through a two-way non-rebreathing Rudolph valve
and then through a charcoal-filtered bleach trap to decontami-
nate any exhaled SM. At the conclusion of the 50-min exposure,
the rats were disconnected from the vapor generator, the endo-
tracheal tube was removed, and the rats were returned to their
cage for recovery. A limitation of this exposure system is the
inability to monitor SM vapor concentrations over the 50-min
exposure period.
Animals were placed in the following treatment groups for
the
48 h
catalytic
antioxidant
dose-finding
studies;
SM/
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (n ¼ 67), SM/10150 every (q) 4 h
(n ¼ 32), SM/10150 q6 hours (n ¼ 12), SM/10150 q8 hours (n ¼ 25),
EtOH/PBS (n ¼ 6), EtOH/10150 (n ¼ 6). Animals were placed in the
following treatment groups for the 72-h study; SM/PBS (n ¼ 13)
and SM/10150 q4 hours (n ¼ 14). Animals were placed in the fol-
lowing treatment groups for 24 h studies (lungs frozen/lavage
fluid collected); SM/10150 (n ¼ 7), SM/PBS (n ¼ 8). Animals were
placed in the following treatment groups for airway cast scoring
(lungs fixed) over time 6 h SM/PBS (n ¼ 5), 6 h SM/10150 (n ¼ 5),
12 h SM/PBS (n ¼ 5), 12 h SM/10150 (n ¼ 5), 18 h SM/PBS (n ¼ 6),
18 h SM/10150 (n ¼ 6), 24 h SM/PBS (n ¼ 6), 24 h SM/10150 (n ¼ 7).
SM/PBS groups (q4 hours, q6 hours, and q8 hours) in 48 h studies
were determined to not differ statistically and were pooled for
presentation. Survival times were measured for each animal as
the time from the exposure apparatus to euthanasia. To meet
euthanasia criteria, an animal required an oxygen saturation
lower than 70% and clinical score greater than 7, as previously
described (Veress et al., 2013). For euthanasia, a cocktail of ket-
amine (75 mg/kg)/xylazine (7.5 mg/kg)/acepromazine (1.5 mg/kg)
was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Once the ani-
mal was toe-pinch unresponsive, exsanguination and collection
of blood for complete blood count (CBC) measurements pre-
ceded lung lavage or fixation. Lavage was performed with two
5 mL washes of a PBS solution containing 0.03% bovine serum
albumin (BSA). Collected lavage fluid was centrifuged at 2000 g
for 8 min; aliquots of supernatants were frozen at �80�C until

 use. Whole lung tissues were perfused with heparinized saline
delivered into the pulmonary artery, after which lungs were col-
lected and snap frozen. Left lung lobes were pulverized in liquid
nitrogen for assays requiring lung tissue.
Pulse oximetry and clinical scores. A pulse oximeter (Starr Life
Sciences, Oakmont, Pennsylvania) was used to collect heart
rates (HR) and oxygen saturation (POx) data from animals prior
to SM exposure and immediately prior to each catalytic antioxi-
dant injection. HR and POx values represent the combined
mean of 3 running average measurements recorded by the
monitoring software (Starr Life Sciences). Clinical Scores (CS)
were recorded concurrently with each of the heart rate and
pulse oximetry measurements as a subjective determination of
distress. Respiratory quality was scored on a scale of 0–6, and
activity on a scale of 0–3 using a previously described method
(Veress et al., 2013). CS represents the summation of both respi-
ratory quality and activity scores where greater distress is indi-
cated by a higher CS score. The highest score possible in a live
animal is 9, whereas a clinical score of 10 is assigned to dead
animals.
Oxidative and nitrosative stress measurements. To quantify DNA
oxidation, DNA was extracted from 25 mg of pulverized left lung
tissue using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
California). DNA yield was determined using a NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer
ND1000
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific,
Waltham, Massachusetts), digested using 4U of nuclease P1,
then 4U of alkaline phosphatase. Samples were analyzed for 8-
hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine
(8OHdG)
and
2-deoxyguanosine
(2dG)
using
HPLC-UV/EC
(CoulArray
Model
5600;
ESA,
Chelmsford, Massachusetts) as previously reported (O’Neill
et al., 2010). Lipid oxidation levels in lung tissues were quanti-
fied by analysis of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) by GC/MS as pre-
viously described (O’Neill et al., 2010). 4-HNE was extracted from
150 mg of pulverized lung tissue, spiked with 4-hydroxynone-
nal-d3 as an internal standard, and derivatized for analysis
using GC/MS. Nitrosative stress assessments were made using
the total nitrate/nitrite kit (Cayman Chemical, Cat 780001, Ann
Arbor, Michigan). Nitrate was converted to nitrite using nitrate
reductase and then Greiss Reagent was used to quantify total
nitrate/nitrite concentrations in BALF samples spectrophoto-
metrically at 540 nm. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations were
measured in lung tissue homogenized in 0.1 N perchloric acid.
Samples were then quantified using HPLC-EC as previously
described (Chandler et al., 2013).
Cytokine quantification. Analysis of proinflammatory cytokines in
BALF samples was performed with the Proinflammatory Panel
(2) rat V-Plex Multi-Spot Assay System (Meso Scale Discovery,
Rockville, Maryland). The electrochemiluminescent array was
used to simultaneously analyze each proinflammatory cyto-
kine. An ELISA assay was used for analysis of TFGb1 in BALF
(Elisa Tech, LLC, Aurora, Colorado). Briefly, 100 ml of BALF sam-
ple was acid activated with 4 ml of 1 N HCl, allowed to incubate
at room temperature for 10 min, then returned to pH 7.2 with
the addition of 4 ml 1.2 N NaOH. Samples were then analyzed for
TGFb1 using conventional ELISA methods. Multiplex and con-
ventional ELISA assays were performed according to manufac-
turer’s protocols and using supplied reagents. Sample values
appearing below the lower limit of detection for each assay
were considered to be 0 pg/ml.
Hematology. Blood samples were collected at euthanasia for
analysis of complete blood cell count (CBC). An aliquot of whole
blood was transferred to a CBC collection tube containing EDTA.
Samples were kept on a rocker until tested using a hematology
analyzer (Cell Dyne 3500, Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara,
California).
Airway cast scoring. Upon euthanasia, tracheas were cannulated
using 15 gauge Luer stub adapters and the lungs were inflation-
fixed at 20 cm H2O with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After
this time the cannula was removed and the trachea tied closed.
Lungs were stored in specimen containers filled with 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde
until
microdissection.
Lungs
were
micro-
dissected under a light microscope and major airways were
assigned cast scores as previously described (Veress et al., 2015).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were carried out with
Graphpad Prism Version 7.0 software (La Jolla, California).
Values are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean.
Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests were performed to compare sur-
vival groups. Two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons were
performed to determine differences between groups, where
applicable. Dunnetts’ post-test was performed to determine dif-
ferences between groups over time and corrected for multiple
comparisons. For 24 h analysis of oxidative stress or cytokine
markers, two-way ANOVA with Newman–Keuls post-test was
used to compare each group and corrected for multiple compar-
isons (P < .05). Data is presented as mean 6 SEM. Statistical tests
performed are described within each figure legend.
RESULTS
Sulfur mustard (SM) inhalation (1.4 mg/kg) resulted in an LD50 at
approximately 24 h post-exposure. Most of the animal deaths
due to SM exposure occurred between 12 and 24 h post-
exposure. Animals receiving subcutaneous injections of cata-
lytic antioxidant (5 mg/kg) 1-h post-SM exposure displayed
greatly improved survival over animals receiving an equivalent
volume of sterile PBS (Fig. 1A). The catalytic antioxidant rescue
effect was dose-dependent, with the q4 hours dosing regimen
(30 mg/kg/day) showing the greatest improvement in survival as
compared with the q8 hours dosing regimen (15 mg/kg/day).
The catalytic antioxidant regimens improved survival at 48 h
from 36% in the SM PBS group to 72–88% in the catalytic antioxi-
dant treatment groups. Fixed lung tissue was also collected at
euthanasia and airway casts were scored. The catalytic antioxi-
dant treatments caused a decrease in airway cast formation in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) that mirrored observed sur-
vival effects. To examine the effects of catalytic antioxidant ces-
sation following SM inhalation, an additional experiment with
all treatments stopped at 48 h following exposure was per-
formed. Continued monitoring of animals out to 72 h revealed a
sustained protective effect in the q4 hours catalytic antioxidant
treatment group (Fig. 1C).
Sham and SM exposed rats were monitored non-invasively
for changes in cardiopulmonary function by assessing blood
oxygenation using pulse oximetry, heart rate, and clinical scor-
ing every 4, 6, or 8 h, just before dosing. Clinical score assess-
ments took into consideration animal activity levels and
difficulty in breathing assessments where a higher number cor-
relates to worsening clinical outcome. SM-mediated decline in
pulse oximetry, heart rate, and clinical score assessments illus-

times and animal deaths did not allow for direct comparison of

 euthanasia if animals did not survive until the end of the study).
Each marker showed significant damage in SM PBS groups
which was rescued with antioxidant treatments in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 2B, D, and F).
Oxidative DNA damage was measured using the ratio of
8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) to 2-deoxyguanosine (2dG) as
a marker of oxidative stress in this model. Oxidative DNA dam-
age was increased 75% from sham values at 24 h post-exposure
to SM (Fig. 3A). The catalytic antioxidant treatment group
showed a small decrease in DNA damage compared with the
SM group, but this did not reach statistical significance. Lipid
peroxidation was measured at 24 h post-exposure by analyzing
4-HNE levels in lung tissue. SM exposure increased lung lipid
oxidation 3-fold and antioxidant administration was able to
reduce SM’s effect on this biomarker back to sham exposed lev-
els (Fig. 3B). Nitrosative stress can be monitored by measuring
changes in the nitrate and nitrite levels which are a surrogate
measure for nitric oxide production. Lung nitrosative stress was

(Sham) and treated with either q4 hours AEOL 10150 or q4 hours PBS. Data from sham exposed animals treated with either PBS or 10150 were pooled for comparison.
Prior to exposure (PRE) and immediately prior to each injection, animals were tested for oxygen saturation (A) and heart rates (B) using a MouseOx pulse oximeter.
Each animal was also scored at these time points for respiratory quality and activity levels, the combination of which is presented as clinical scores (C). Varying treat-
ment times and animal mortality precludes direct comparisons between groups over time (A, C, E). Statistical analysis of oxygen saturations, heart rates, and clinical
scores were performed on data collected at euthanasia (B, D, F). Data is presented as mean 6 SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA with

(Figure 3C). The catalytic antioxidant treatment greatly attenu-
ated the SM-mediated increase in nitrosative stress seen at 24 h.
Lung glutathione (GSH) levels were assessed by HPLC as an
additional indicator of oxidative stress. SM exposures signifi-
cantly diminished GSH lung levels by 55%, which were not sig-
nificantly improved with antioxidant treatment (Fig. 3D).
Sulfur

(SM)-mediated
lung
inflammation
was
assessed by measuring a panel of cytokines in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) 24 h after SM inhalation. The inflammatory
cytokine panel included IFN-Ç, IL-10, IL-13, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
KC/GRO and TNF-a. SM inhalation resulted in significant eleva-
tion of TNF-a, IL-6, KC/GRO, and IL-1b levels in BALF 24 h after
exposure compared with sham exposed groups (Fig. 4A–D). The
other cytokines measured in this array were not significantly
affected at 24 h by SM exposures (data not shown). The catalytic
antioxidant treatment significantly attenuated SM-mediated
increases
in
TNF-a,
IL-6,

at

Transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) is commonly associated
with lung injury and repair responses (Liu, 2008; Tatler and
Jenkins, 2012). TGFb1 has been implicated in the development
of pulmonary fibrosis in chronic models of SM exposure
(Aghanouri et al., 2004; Emad and Emad, 2007; Ghanei and
Harandi, 2011; Poursaleh et al., 2012). SM exposure significantly
increased BALF TGFb1 levels nearly 10-fold over Sham PBS at
24 h post-exposure (Fig. 5). The catalytic antioxidant treatment
group significantly abolished SM-mediated increase in TGFb1
BALF levels.
Sulfur mustard (SM) exposure produces a well-recognized
suppressive effect on circulating white blood cells. Analysis of
circulating white blood cells using a hematology analyzer
revealed a prolonged and pronounced leukopenia by SM expo-
sure (Fig. 6A). This effect was evident as early as 6 h after SM
exposure and remained depressed out to 48 h. The catalytic
antioxidant treatment blunted this effect over the observed
time course. Comparison of white blood cell (WBC) counts at
48 h post-SM exposure showed that antioxidant treatment
restored WBCs back to control levels. Differential cell counts

 showed that the catalytic antioxidant caused increases in neu-
trophils at several time points after exposure (Fig. 6C and D).
Circulating lymphocytes were found to be significantly sup-
pressed by SM exposure over the 48-h time course, but antioxi-
dant treatment improved lymphocyte counts (Fig. 6E and F).
Fixed rat lung tissue was micro-dissected under a light
microscope for visual assessment and scoring of cast occlusion
in major airways. SM-mediated airway occlusions were scored
for percent occlusion as previously described (Veress et al. 2015).
Airway casts were clearly visible in animals exposed to SM com-
pared with sham treatment group and were diminished in the
catalytic antioxidant treatment group (Fig. 7). SM-mediated
increases in airway cast scoring were significantly evident at 6 h
after exposure and increased linearly over 24 h (Fig. 8A). Rats
receiving catalytic antioxidant had much lower airway cast for-
mation at 6 h than the SM group and cast progression was
inhibited
over
time.

decreased by 58% at the 24-h time point in the catalytic antioxi-

DISCUSSION
Many oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways have been
associated with SM exposure and its resulting toxicity. Isolating
a single mechanism of toxicity for SM is difficult because its
high reactivity allows it to alkylate many cellular macromole-
cules that in turn can affect many biological processes. Many
diverse therapies have been tested as countermeasures against
SM toxicity including anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants,
protease inhibitors, and anti-apoptotic compounds (Keyser
et al., 2014; Tang and Loke, 2013; Weinberger et al., 2011). These
treatments have been met with mixed results, and the search
continues to find a feasible drug therapy for use in treating
humans exposed to SM. One recurring theme in SM toxicity
models is the presence of an oxidative stress component which
may be responsible for propagating the deleterious effects of SM
(Brimfield et al., 2012; Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2011). Many
antioxidants have been evaluated against different models of
SM toxicity with some beneficial effect in the treatment of SM
toxicity (Anderson et al., 2000; Bobb et al., 2005; Korkmaz et al.,

 2008; Kumar et al., 2001). It is difficult to compare many of the
results of these studies because they occur across many differ-
ent models of SM exposure, time points, toxicity endpoints, and
are often performed with surrogate SM agents such as 2-chlor-
oethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). The primary aim of these studies
was to characterize the role played by oxidative stress in injury
progression after SM inhalation and the potential of a catalytic
antioxidant, AEOL 10150, as a medical countermeasure. AEOL
10150 is a manganese-containing porphyrin which functions as
a catalytic antioxidant, capable of scavenging superoxide,
hydrogen
peroxide,
peroxynitrite,
and
lipid
peroxides
(Kachadourian et al., 2004). Catalytic antioxidants can scavenge
multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species without being
consumed in the reaction (Day, 2004). This antioxidant has
shown promising effects in other studies of SM induced toxicity
in both in vitro and in vivo models (Gould et al., 2009; O’Neill et al.,
2010, 2011; Tewari-Singh et al., 2014). This catalytic antioxidant
has also displayed therapeutic benefits in other models of lung
injury such as exposure to fractionated radiation and chlorine
gas inhalation (McGovern et al., 2011; Rabbani et al., 2007).
In our model of SM inhalation, approximately 50% of the ani-
mals exposed to SM and administered PBS q4 hours did not sur-
vive to 24 h post-exposure. Administration of the catalytic
antioxidant AEOL10150 beginning 1 h post-SM exposure pro-
duced a robust improvement in survival. The extent of survival
improvement
provided
by
antioxidant
administration
was
dose-dependent and resulted in nearly complete protection
against acute SM lethality at the highest catalytic antioxidant
dosing regimen (q4 hours, 30 mg/kg/day). The catalytic antioxi-
dant improvement in SM survival continued to 72 h even after
treatment cessation at 48 h post-SM exposure. Inhaled SM has
been recently shown to produce obstructive airways fibrin casts
and these are believed responsible for acute deaths (Veress
et al., 2010). Direct intratracheal administration of tissue plasmi-
nogen activator (tPA) has been previously shown to improve
survival of animals after exposure to CEES and SM through the
reduction of obstructive airway casts. Stoichiometric antioxi-
dants including the water soluble vitamin E analog trolox, and
the bioflavonoid quercetin have been shown to improve median
survival times in mice exposed to SM (Kumar et al., 2001; Veress
et al., 2013, 2015). This is the first published study to report sig-
nificant improvements in survival using a catalytic antioxidant
in a rat model of SM inhalation.
It is not known what the human exposures to SM have been
because they have occurred on battlefields, during terrorist
events, or due to accidental exposures. However, soldiers
exposed to sulfur mustard on the battlefield experienced similar
respiratory symptoms and airway casts as we observed in our
rat studies at the 1.4mg/kg sulfur mustard dose (Khazdair et al.,
2015). The sulfur mustard dose we used was identified previ-
ously as one that produces around an LD50 at 24 h post-exposure
in our rat model. This was necessary to satisfy FDA require-
ments of preclinical survival efficacy under the animal rule.
Any therapeutic that is intended to be developed and approved
as a medical countermeasure for chemical agents needs to
meet the requirements of the FDA animal rule. Under this rule
it is important to not only show that the countermeasure can
improve a significant outcome such as survival, but also
improve function and quality of life (Jett, 2016). Diminished
arterial oxygen saturations following SM exposure have previ-
ously been reported in this model system (Rancourt et al., 2013;
Veress et al., 2015). In addition to the pulse oximetry for live-
animal surveillance, each animal was assigned a clinical score
at each time point. The clinical scoring parameters provide a
quantitative assessment of respiratory distress and general
activity levels. Following SM exposure, there was a marked
increase in clinical scores over time in our model. Our contin-
ued monitoring of exposed animals throughout the experiment
revealed that the catalytic antioxidant treatments were able to
effectively suppress the SM induced deterioration of oxygen sat-
urations, heart rates, and adverse clinical scores over time.
Protective effects on these markers of injury have also been
reported in tPA rescue from CEES and SM inhalation (Veress
et al., 2015).
To measure oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions after
SM inhalation, several biomarkers of oxidative stress were eval-
uated. These markers included DNA oxidation (8-OHdG), lipid
peroxidation (4-HNE), reduced glutathione (GSH) concentra-
tions, and total nitrate/nitrite levels (NOx). Our results indicate
that each of these markers of oxidative/nitrosative stress was
worsened at 24 h post-exposure to SM. Treatment with the cata-
lytic antioxidant was able to significantly reduce oxidative and
nitrosative stress at 24 h, as measured by 4-HNE and NOx levels,
respectively. Antioxidant treated groups appeared to have lower
oxidative DNA damage levels than SM PBS groups, but this
effect was not significant, possibly due to the small sample size
being evaluated. Although AEOL 10150 did not appear to
improve GSH levels, this effect may be complicated by the for-
mation of SM-GSH adducts which would not have been detected
by the HPLC methods used here (Batal et al., 2015; Mol et al.,
2008). Other publications investigating oxidative stress and ves-
icants have concluded that reductions in the measured markers
of oxidative stress are linked to lowered toxicity (Gould et al.,
2009; Laskin et al., 2010; O’Neill et al., 2010; Tewari-Singh et al.,
2011; Ucar et al., 2007). Our results support the hypothesis that
AEOL 10150 lowered oxidative stress in this model, which corre-
lated with attenuating SM toxicity.
Oxidative stress and inflammation often occur together and
some propose that each enhances the formation of each other
(Conner and Grisham, 1996; Gill et al., 2010; Khansari et al., 2009;
Nathan and Cunningham-Bussel, 2013). Proinflammatory cyto-
kines which had been observed to be elevated after SM exposure

 were selected to determine if antioxidant treatments would
affect their presence in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
(Emmler et al., 2007; Malaviya et al., 2010; Ricketts et al., 2000;
Seagrave et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2014). The cytokines were ana-
lyzed using a proinflammatory multiplex panel that included
cytokines previously reported to be elevated by SM exposure. Of
the cytokines tested in this panel, only TNF-a, IL-6, KC/GRO, and
IL-1b were significantly increased by SM exposure at 24 h over
control values. For each marker tested, treatment with AEOL
10150 was able to restore BALF cytokine concentrations back to
control
values.
Published
research
linking
inflammatory
responses to injury progression after exposure to SM analogs
support the idea that an indirect reduction in inflammation
from antioxidant treatment may reinforce the protective effect
it displays against SM toxicity (Arroyo et al., 1995; Emmler et al.,
2007; Kehe et al., 2009; O’Neill et al., 2010; Ricketts et al., 2000).
It has been suggested that TFGb1 plays a role in the patho-
genesis of chronic SM toxicity (Ghanei and Harandi, 2007;
Poursaleh et al., 2012). Generation of reactive oxygen species
have been previously shown to influence expression of TFGb1
(Jain et al., 2013). TFGb1 levels were measured in BALF samples

 exposure as well as to determine if catalytic antioxidant treat-
ment can alter their expression. It was discovered that this
growth factor is elevated in the acute model of SM toxicity, and
that antioxidant dosing acutely inhibits this overexpression.
TGFb1 levels are heavily associated with the development of idi-
opathic
pulmonary
fibrosis,
and
it
has
previously
been
described that levels of TGFb1 can be upregulated long after
exposure to SM (Aghanouri et al., 2004; Tatler and Jenkins, 2012).
The antioxidant induced suppression of TGFb1 levels could indi-
cate that antioxidants may be beneficial for chronic pulmonary
conditions following SM inhalation as well as resolving acute
toxicity.
Depletion of white blood cells is a well reported facet of SM
toxicity, and it has been suggested that the SM-mediated
immune suppression may be one of the most threatening
effects of exposure (Anderson et al., 2006; Hassan et al., 2006;
Yue et al., 2015). These studies also found SM exposure to pro-
duce a leukopenia that was primarily influenced by depressed
lymphocyte counts. Catalytic antioxidant administration atte-
nuated leukopenia at each time point studied with the largest
effects on the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. The finding
that white blood cells are restored with catalytic antioxidant
treatments is highly significant due to the previous research
which has shown bone marrow to be an important target of SM
damage (Yue et al., 2015). Leukocytes are believed to have an
important role in the pathogenic response to inhaled vesicants
(McClintock et al., 2002; Weinberger et al., 2011). The protective
effect observed with antioxidant therapy on WBC counts may
be a vital component of its protective capabilities. Although sig-
nificant neutropenia was not observed in these studies, lowered
neutrophil counts have been noted in models of both SM and
nitrogen mustard (NM) injury. The elevated neutrophil counts
produced by AEOL 10150 (independent of SM exposure) may be
a beneficial outcome considering the use of granulocyte colony
stimulating factor has been recommended as a therapeutic to
increase neutrophils after injury from SM and NM (Anderson
et al., 2006).
The presence of airway casts in this model, as well as the
therapeutic benefit of their removal have been previously
reported (Veress et al., 2010, 2013). This study further these
findings by quantifying the development of the casts over time
as well as the first to show that catalytic antioxidant therapy
reduces SM-induced airway cast formation. The physical dis-
ruption of airflow into the lungs from the cast occlusions
appears to be the driving force in acute SM inhalation lethality
(Veress et al., 2010, 2015). The reduction of airway cast size, and
subsequent improvements in lung function from catalytic anti-
oxidant therapy are likely responsible for the improved pulse
oximetry values, clinical scores, and diminished biomarkers
reported herein. The mechanism by which catalytic antioxi-
dants mediated airway cast suppression is not well understood
at this time, and merits further investigation. Possible explana-
tions for a reduction in cast size may include reducing oxidant-
induced vascular permeability and thereby preventing plasma
proteins from seeping into the lung or an effect on clotting fac-
tors which may prevent coagulation (Rancourt et al., 2012, 2013).
Oxidative stress may not be the only toxic pathway involved
in SM toxicity, but also our results indicate that treatment with
the catalytic antioxidant AEOL 10150 was capable of affording
greatly improved survival against acute SM inhalation. The
extent of protection afforded to animals receiving catalytic anti-
oxidants supports that idea that oxidative stress plays a central
role in inhaled SM toxicity, and that injectable catalytic antioxi-
dants may be a viable therapeutic option for emergency man-
agement of SM exposures. The suppression of airway cast
formation and related improvements in lung function/survival
show that further research into catalytic antioxidant therapeu-
tics to treat SM toxicity is merited. Further studies are required
to investigate if catalytic antioxidants may be valuable in reduc-
ing negative outcomes in chronic models of SM injury.
