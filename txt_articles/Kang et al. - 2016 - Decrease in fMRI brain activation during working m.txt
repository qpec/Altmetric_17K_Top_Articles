The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exposure to dim light at night (dLAN) when 
sleeping on functional brain activation during a working-memory tasks. We conducted the brain 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis on 20 healthy male subjects. All participants 
slept in a polysomnography laboratory without light exposure on the first and second nights and under 
a dim-light condition of either 5 or 10 lux on the third night. The fMRI scanning was conducted during 
n-back tasks after second and third nights. Statistical parametric maps revealed less activation in the 
right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) after exposure to 10-lux light. The brain activity in the right and left 
IFG areas decreased more during the 2-back task than during the 1- or 0-back task in the 10-lux group. 
The exposure to 5-lux light had no significant effect on brain activities. The exposure to dLAN might 
influence the brain function which is related to the cognition.
Nighttime light is now considered to be one of the fastest growing pollutants, and the invasion of artificial light 
into previously unlit areas is threatening the soundness of human health and sleep. Nighttime artificial lighting in 
cities is divided into three types: sky glow, trespass, and glow. Light trespass refers to unwanted direct lighting of 
an area, and it occurs when unwanted light spills over into another property or dwelling and causes sleep interfer-
ence, negative influence on one’s well-being, and impaired visibility of evening star1.
Concerns about and distress from the ecological consequences of nighttime artificial light are increasing. 
Several studies have also shown that light pollution and shift work are tentative risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal disease, and metabolic syndrome2–5. However, systematic 
and well-controlled studies of the harmful effects of light pollution on humans are lacking.
Many countries have recently enacted laws and regulations for reducing light at night (LAN), many of 
which have been based on international guidelines, such as Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE), 
Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), and Institution of Lighting Engineers (ILE)6. The 
upper brightness limits for light trespass into residential areas in cities are 2, 3, and 5 lux in the CIE, IESNA, and 
ILE guidelines, respectively6. South Korea recently adopted a regulation setting the upper limit for light trespass 
to 10 lux in city residential areas for practical reasons, but public demands for stricter regulations (i.e., 5 lux or 
dimmer) have increased since then. For the reason that no research has been made on the intensity of dim light 
at night (dLAN) which causes health problems including sleep disturbance, discussions and debates are in slow 
progress about setting relevant regulations. The authors reported that the exposure to the dLAN (5- and 10- lux) 
while sleeping was significantly associated with an increased duration of awake time after sleep onset, increased 
N1 (stage 1) sleep, and decreased N2 (stage 2) sleep in the previous study which was performed with the same 
study design7. However, the evidence of and biological studies on effects of dim light trespass on cognition, sleep, 
and health are still insufficient. For this reason, further scientific evidence and studies regarding the effects of 
dLAN (e.g., 5 vs 10 lux) on cognition and brain activation are necessary to ensure that reasonable regulations are 
formulated to protect against adverse effects of light trespass.

While several studies have investigated the effects of light exposure on cognitive function, alertness, electro-
encephalography changes, and brain function, these have been limited to the subjects of immediate waking and 
stimulation effects after light exposure8–12. There has been little research into changes in cognitive function and 
human brain activation after LAN exposure during sleep. In particular, no previous study has used functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate changes in human brain activation after dLAN exposure dur-
ing sleep.
This study investigated the effect of dLAN (5 vs 10 lux) when sleeping on the brain activation of healthy young 
men during a working-memory (WM) task (n-back task) using fMRI.
Results
Demographic data. 
The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and baseline n-back task and nocturnal 
polysomnography (NPSG) results are given in Table 1. The age, duration of education, n-back task results, and 
NPSG results at the baseline evaluation did not differ significantly between the 5- and 10-lux groups (Table 1). 
No group difference was found either in the difference of the working memory task performance performed in 
different task difficulties using the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate the presence of a 
group × task difficulty interaction.
n-back task. 
Changes in the n-back task results between before and after the light exposure were analysed 
separately in the 5- and 10-lux groups. While the reaction time before and after the LAN was significantly dif-
ferent based on the 1 back task (t = 
 3.41, p = 
 0.007) and the 2 back task (t = 
 2.86, p = 
 0.017) of 5 lux group, the 
response accuracy was not different before and after the LAN. The reaction time as well as the response accuracy 
before and after the LAN did not show any difference based on all n back tasks of the 10 lux group, although the 
response accuracy on the 1 back task of 10 lux group tended to decline after the light exposure (p = 0.059).
With regard to the difference between the 5 lux group and the 10 lux group in their response accuracy and the 
reaction time before and after the LAN (Fig. 1), the response accuracy in the 1 back task after the LAN in the 10 
lux group decreased more than that of the 5 lux group (F = 4.75, p = 0.043). The change of the response accuracy, 
however, showed no difference in 0 back and 2 back tasks between two groups, and the change of the reaction 
time to all n back tasks did not show any significant difference between two groups, either.
fMRI findings. 
In the comparisons between pre- and postexposure to light of 10 lux for one night, the light 
exposure was associated with a decrease in brain activation. The statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of brain 
regions (paired t test; before vs after exposure to 10-lux light) revealed that the activation during the n-back task 
in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was significantly less after exposure than before exposure (T =

pFWE-corr = 
 0.014; FWE-corr refers to the family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons at cluster-level;

 (20, 40, − 
10) 
of the right IFG and a post-hoc power analysis indicated the power of 0.978. However, the exposure to 5-lux light 
did not decrease brain activation.
The fMRI activity in the right and left IFG decreased more when performing the 2-back task than the 1- and 
0-back task (2-back task > 
0- and 1-back task) after exposure to 10-lux light for one night (right IFG, T =

the 5-lux group.

We determined whether the difference in the decrease between the groups (10 vs 5 lux) was significant using 
the mixed-model ANOVA to investigate the presence of a significant group × 
 time interaction. The fMRI activity 
in the right IFG decreased more in the 10-lux group than in the 5-lux group during the n-back task (T = 
 4.04, 
 
puncorrected = 0.017, pFWE-corr = 0.083; Fig. 3, Table 2).
In the 10-lux group, there was no significant correlation of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal 
change in the right IFG after dLAN with the change of sleep efficiency (p = 
 0.332) and the wake time after sleep 
onset (p = 
 0.951). In all participants, the correlation of the BOLD signal change with the change in sleep efficiency 
(p = 0.792) and the wake time after sleep onset (p = 0.937) was not significant, either.
Discussion
Many recent studies have investigated the effects of light pollution and light trespass on humans, but there has 
been no previous study using fMRI researching into the effect of the dLAN on the WM. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first report on a decrease in brain activation detected by fMRI during an n-back task (a WM test) 
after exposure to dim light (10 lux) while sleeping. This study is meaningful because it is the first to scientifically 
identify the effect of the dLAN on human brain function and cognition. It is noteworthy that the brain activation 
was altered after only a single night of light exposure. This suggests that the chronic exposure to the LAN for 
many nights might have caused more pronounced effects on the brain and cognition.
Comparing the working memory results and fMRI results of any n back task, the response accuracy of 10 lux 
group in 1 back task after the LAN decreased more than that of the 5 lux group, which is in line with the decline

of the brain activation in fMRI result. The interesting finding in the 10 lux group, however, was the discrepancy 
between the n-back task and fMRI results. The decrease of the brain activation in fMRI in the frontal lobe with-
out significant finding in the n-back task of 10 lux group suggests that the absence of evidence of subjective or 
objective cognitive dysfunction does not necessarily mean that the brain is functioning normally. This indicates 
that certain exposure to dim light might influence brain function for cognition even if there is no significant 
impairment in subjective symptoms (or even in an objective neurocognitive function test). The reaction time at 1

back and 2 back tasks after the LAN decreased in 5 lux group while that of 10 lux group showed no significant dif-
ference. This can be deemed as evidence that decrease of BOLD signal in 10 lux group at fMRI is not attributable 
to the learning effect. If we assume that the decrease in BOLD signal is attributable to the less cognitive effort by 
learning effect, the decrease in BOLD signal should have been found rather in 5 lux group.
We observed significant decreases in fMRI activity in the right IFG after exposure to 10-lux light. The IFG is 
believed to play an executive role in the WM13,14. The decrease in the activation of the IFG during the n-back task 
after the light exposure may suggest the deterioration of brain function. The decreases in fMRI activity in both 
frontal gyri were more significant when performing the 2-back task than performing simpler tasks after exposure 
to 10-lux light. Past researches have also found a linear relationship between the task load during the n-back WM 
test and the cerebral blood flow in fMRI; specifically, an increased task load intensifies the decompensation of 
frontal lobe function15.
The decrease in brain activation might be attributable to the poor quality of sleep during exposure to the 
dLAN. In our previous study where we applied the same study design as this study7, we concluded that the expo-
sure to dLAN during sleep caused an increase in the frequency of arousal and the amount of shallow sleep, which 
we thought attributable to a change in melatonin secretion7. Ikeda showed that continuous exposure to dim light 
(0.5~1 lux) caused changes in the sleep and body-temperature patterns of adult rats: the time spent in NREM 
sleep decreased after the first night of dim light exposure, while the number of REM sleep episodes increased (i.e., 
greater fragmentation of REM sleep)16. They concluded that the amount of sleep and its structure are vulnerable 
to both short-term and prolonged exposures to dim light. Another study exposed eight healthy male volunteers 
to an ordinary room light (~180 lux), and found that this has reset the circadian melatonin and cortisol rhythm, 
countering an earlier study that indicated the phase shifting of the suprachiasmatic nucleus could be induced by 
exposure to light of moderate-intensity (i.e., 500 lux)17,18.

Previous fMRI studies have found that sleep deprivation changed certain brain function during the WM test; 
however, the results have somewhat varied19. The most consistent finding of neuroimaging studies is that the 
sleep deprivation decreases brain activation in response to WM tests in the frontal cortex20–22 and the posterior 
(parietal, occipital, and temporal) cortices21,23. On the other hand, other studies have found that the activation in 
thalamic nuclei, anterior cingulated cortex, and prefrontal area increased after sleep loss, which was interpreted 
as a compensation phenomenon for the effects of sleep deprivation20,21,23.
In the correlation analysis, no significant correlation was found between the change of the BOLD signal in 
IFG and the sleep measurements (i.e., sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset). LAN exposure might directly 
induce cognitive dysfunction, rather than indirectly via sleep disturbance. One previous study has found that 
the irregular light schedule directly impaired both learning ability and mood via melanopsin-expressing neu-
rons in mice24. Interestingly, despite their indication of normal circadian rhythm and sleep structure, the subject 
mice showed impaired long-term potentiation of the hippocampus and learning in the presence of aberrant light 
exposure24. This cognitive impairment was attributable to the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells 
(ipRGCs), which project not only to hypothalamic and preoptic areas but also to the limbic regions such as the 
lateral habenula and medial amygdala24. Bedrosian et al. argued that the dLAN might directly influence the brain 
function via a process related to the ipRGCs, and an analysis of behaviour and hippocampal morphology showed 
that exposing hamsters to dLAN (5 lux) for 4 weeks altered their neuronal structure and generated a depressive 
response25. Fonken et al. reported that exposure to 5-lux LAN for 3 weeks impaired the cognition (learning 
and memory in the Barnes maze test) and provoked depression-like responses in a diurnal rodent26. They also 
showed a reduced dendritic length in the dentate gyrus and basilar CA1 area of the hippocampus neurons in the 
rodent after exposure to dLAN. Bedrosian et al. explained that these changes in the hippocampus resulted from 
decreases in BDNF expression and highly plastic dendritic spines induced by environmental changes25,27,28.
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small and this could result in lower 
statistical power in the neuroimaging analyses. Secondly, we did not have a control subject group who spent 3 
nights without any dLAN. Thirdly, we could not control the previously accumulated potential LAN effect prior to 
the experiment. Further studies with larger samples and control subject group are therefore warranted.
The results of this study suggest that exposure to LAN during sleep reduces brain activation, which has major 
implications for further follow-up studies and the development of governmental policies. The effect of 5-lux LAN 
exposure on sleep and cognition should be investigated further, even though the reduction in brain activation was 
not statistically significant in the 5-lux group in the present study. Moreover, effects of long-term exposure to dim 
light while sleeping on brain activation, cognitive function, sleep problems, and brain morphology will also need 
to be further investigated in larger scale studies.
Methods
Subjects. 
We recruited young male healthy volunteers who had no history of sleep, psychiatric, or major 
medical disorders. The subjects were aged 19–29 years, and each provided informed written consent prior to 
the enrollment in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Korea 
University Anam Hospital (IRB number: ED 12261) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki. We enrolled only young healthy male subjects in order to better eliminate the impact of other factors 
such as age, sex, and health-related confounders.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) right handedness, (ii) no current or past sleep disorders or neurocog-
nitive disorders, (iii) no current or past medical, neurological, or psychiatric illness that may affect brain function 
or cognitive function, and (iv) have not taken any neurotropic or psychotropic medications for their life time. 
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) suspected of having sleep–wake cycle irregularity or circadian rhythm 
sleep disorders in actigraphy, (ii) suspected of having any sleep disorders in Night 1 NPSG (e.g., SE below 90%, 
apnea-hypopnea index > 
5, periodic limb movement during sleep > 
15, or presence of REM sleep without atonia), 
(iii) body mass index of > 
30 kg/m2, (iv) contraindication for 3T MRI (such as claustrophobia and pacemaker), 
and (v) structural abnormality in brain MRI.
After the initial screening of subjects’ sleeping conditions, physical health, and psychiatric health based 
on questionnaires, 35 subjects were interviewed face-to-face in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study 
by a board-certified psychiatrist (H.J.L.) majoring in sleep medicine using the semi-structured interview of 
DSM-IV-TR. Based on such interview, we excluded five subjects who were suspected to have a specific sleep 
disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, aberrant sleep–wake cycle, or obesity.
The participants were randomly divided into two groups and exposed to different light-intensity: 5 and 10 lux. 
For 1 week prior to the study, 30 participants wore an actigraph (Actiwatch-L, Mini Mitter, Bend, OR) on their 
non-dominant wrist in order for us to identify their sleep–wake cycles and screen the potential sleep–wake dis-
orders and excessive LAN. We reviewed the actigraphic data and the information of the light meter for all of the 
participants’ 1-week sleep–wake cycles, and excluded two participants whose cycles were disturbed due to being 
irregular or the presence of suspected delayed-sleep-phase syndrome. One participant withdrew the consent to 
participate in the middle of the study. After scoring and staging the NPSG results of all participants, we further 
excluded four participants with a sleep efficiency of < 
90% or an apnea-hypopnea index of > 
5 in NPSG.
Finally, 23 subjects participated in our study: 11 and 12 subjects in the 5- and 10-lux groups, respectively. The 
fMRI analysis included 20 subjects (11 and 9 in the 5- and 10-lux groups, respectively), since 3 participants were 
excluded due to missing data caused by a task-button recognition error.
Study design. 
All of the participants were requested to sleep and be awake according to standard time sched-
ule during a period from one week before the experiment through the end of this study, and were prohibited from 
napping during the daytime and consuming medicines, caffeine beverages, and alcohol. Participants were also

asked to keep their routine activity and the usual brightness of lighting. NPSG was conducted for three consecu-
tive nights (Fig. 4). During each NPSG session, the lights were turned off at 11:00 p.m. and turned on at 7:00 a.m. 
After the lights were turned off, participants were prohibited on the use of smartphones during the entire NPSG 
session. All participants underwent adaptation NPSG on the first night (Night 0) to adapt to the NPSG laboratory 
and to minimise the first-night effect of the NPSG. Subjects were instructed to sleep in the NPSG room without 
any light exposure on the second night (Night 1) and under a dim light condition of 5 or 10 lux on the third night 
(Night 2). The participants were asked to sleep in the supine position as much as possible and not to hide their 
face with a blanket. After the second and third nights, participants underwent fMRI while performing n-back 
tasks (0-, 1-, and 2-back tasks) in order to evaluate their cognitive function (Fig. 4).
For the whole period of Night 2, a light box producing a dim light with a daylight ‘cool white’ colour was 
placed on the upper part of the wall opposite to participant’s head. The box contained a light source compris-
ing wide-spectrum light-emitting diodes with an encompassing wide wavelength (dom λ 
: 501.4 nm, peak λ 
: 
463.6 nm, centre λ 
: 467.6 nm, centroid λ 
: 554.3 nm, Correlated Colour Temperature: 5779.1 K, General Colour 
Rendering index: 90). The luminous intensity was set to 5 or 10 lux according to the study group. Light sources 
were enclosed in a box, approximately 11.8 × 
 11.8 × 
 1.3 inches, with a light diffuser panel on the front. The ini-
tial light box setup was installed by an illumination expert who is affiliated with the Korea Institute of Lighting 
Technology. The luminous intensity was checked by an illuminometer (ANA-F11, Tokyo Photo, Japan) at the level 
of the participant’s eyes while supine. Participants were not informed whether the dLAN was 5 or 10 lux.
Polysomnography. 
The quality and quantity of subjects’ sleep were measured by NPSG for three consecutive 
nights (i.e., Nights 0, 1, and 2). Standard NPSG recordings were obtained using the Embla digital polysomnogra-
phy and Somnologica software (Broomfield, CO, USA). The recording montage, electrode, and sensors of general 
parameters (i.e., electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, airflow signals, respiratory-effort 
signals, oxygen saturation, body position, and electrocardiogram) were applied according to the technical specifi-
cations recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)29. The polysomnography recordings 
were analysed on a computer monitor, and sleep stages and events were scored visually by a single well-trained 
polysomnography technologist based on the criteria of the AASM29, and all of the polysomnography data were 
confirmed by a sleep-specialist medical doctor (H.J.L.). Such NPSG findings on these subjects have been reported 
previously7.
Performing n back task during functional scanning. 
Participants performed a verbal version of the 
n-back task, which is a classical test of the WM. They were asked to monitor a series of stimuli and to respond 
whenever a presented stimulus (henceforth the “target” stimulus) was the same as the one previously presented 
n trials, where n is a pre-specified integer, usually 1, 2, or 3. Participants underwent one scanning session which 
is composed by six functional runs, each of which lasts 4 minutes and 47 seconds. The presentation of the stimuli 
was performed in a blocked design. Pre-generated random sequences of letters designed to equally distribute 
the targets and conditions in each runs were used30. The adopted event-related design was used to prevent the 
habituation to each condition (n-back conditions). Each condition (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) was equally distrib-
uted in each run. Each block was separated by a baseline control block lasting 16 seconds. Stimuli continuously 
appeared and the task required participants to temporarily store each stimulus in their memory for evaluation, 
and to discard it before the appearance of the next one. For this, three different conditions were used that varied 
the WM load incrementally from zero to two items. Each item was presented for 500 msec and the inter-stimulus 
interval was for 2500 msec. In the 0-back condition, participants responded to a single pre-specified target letter; 
in the 1-back condition, the target was any letter identical to the one immediately preceding it (i.e., one trial back); 
and in the 2-back condition, the target was any letter that was identical to the one presented two trials back. In 
this manner, the WM load (storage and manipulation demands) increased incrementally from the 0-back to the 
2-back task (Fig. 5).
Figure 4. Schematic of the LAN intervention procedure. To reduce the first-night effect, we have applied an 
additional nocturnal NPSG session on the first night (Night 0) before performing the main study on the second 
and third nights (Nights 1 and 2). After Nights 1 and 2, participants underwent fMRI while performing n-back 
tasks (0-, 1-, and 2-back tasks). Abbreviations: LAN, light at night; NPSG, nocturnal polysomnography; fMRI,

The stimuli were presented using Presentation 11.0 software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, NY, USA). 
Responses of participants were collected using same software through fibre optic response pad (Current Designs, 
Philadelphia, PA).
fMRI image acquisition. 
Anatomical T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at Korea 
University Brain Imaging Center, using a 3-tesla scanner (Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) which had a 
32-channel sense head coil (sense reduction factor = 
 2). An fMRI scanning was performed during n back task 
for each and every participant between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. after PSG and we made sure that the MRI room 
used for all participants had the same light condition of 150 lux with cool-white colour. Functional images were 
acquired using gradient echo planar images with BOLD contrast and the following parameters: TR = 2000 msec, 
TE = 
 30 msec, flip angle = 
 90 degrees, field of view = 
 240 × 
 240 mm2, slice thickness = 
 4 mm, and 36 interleaved 
slices parallel to the anterior-commissure–posterior-commissure line covering the whole brain. Each scanning 
sequence comprised 164 sequential volumes. After the functional scanning, a high-resolution T1-weighted 
anatomical scan was performed on each participant with the following parameters: three-dimensional spoiled 
gradient echo sequence, 162 slices, TR = 
 1900 msec, TE = 
 2.32 msec, slice thickness = 
 1 mm, and in-plane 
resolution = 1 × 1 mm2.
Data analysis: clinical and cognitive measures. 
The behavioral performance in the n-back task was 
assessed as the ratio of accurate responses and the average time to react with correct responses. The effects of 
LAN exposure on the 0-, 1-, and 2-back conditions were analysed based on the reaction time and response accu-
racy for patients allocated to 5- or 10-lux group. We compared the change in subjects’ performance after the 
light exposure in both 5- and 10-lux groups using either the paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test and also 
compared differences in the exposure effect between the two groups using repeated-measures ANOVA. In case 
where the variance of differences in levels was not equal, the repeated-measures ANOVA was calculated using 
the Greenhouse and Geisser correction. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, and the cutoff for 
statistical significance was set as p = 0.05.
Image preprocessing and statistical analysis of fMRI data. 
Image processing and statistical analysis 
of imaging were performed using SPM version 8 (Institute of Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB 
(MathWorks, Sherborn, MA, USA). Before the image processing, board-certified neuroradiologists reviewed the 
structural MR images to check if there is any structural abnormality in their brain images. The first five volumes 
(obtained during 10 sec) of every run were discarded in order to avoid T1 equilibration effects, and all volumes 
were spatially realigned. The acquired images were spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute 
MNI152 stereotactic standard brain template according to the 12-parameter affine transformation and 16 nonlin-
ear iterations31. The realigned and unwarped T2*-weighted volumes were spatially transformed and resampled in 
3 × 
 3 × 
 3 mm3 voxels after normalisation. All functional volumes went through a spatial smoothing with an 8-mm 
full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel in order to reduce the intersubject variability.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, we adopted the whole-brain analyses instead of the region of inter-
est (ROI) analysis. Statistical maps were generated using a random-effect model implemented through a two-level 
procedure. The first level of the analysis identified participant-specific task-related activations at the baseline and 
after dLAN exposure, by using a factorial model consisting of three active conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back tasks). 
The second level of the analysis applied separate ANOVAs within SPM to contrasts of (i) 0-, 1-, and 2-back tasks 
> 
rest and (ii) 2-back task > 
0- and 1-back task. In addition to these, the data were tested for the exposure group 
 
(5 and 10 lux) × 
 time (before and after exposure) interactions (the difference of differences in before vs after 
exposure under 5 and 10 lux) in a mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA within SPM. Generic activations 
were identified in contrasts of (i) 0-, 1-, and 2-back task > 
rest and (ii) 2-back task > 
0- and 1-back task, using 
one-sample t test collapsing baseline data that were set for both groups. The resulting before- and after-exposure 
contrast values were subtracted (before minus after) in order to obtain the amount of reduction in cerebral activ-
ity from before- to after-exposure in any given region. Specifically, a positive number represents a decrease in

activation. We then performed the correlation analysis between mean BOLD signal change in the cluster with a 
significant decrease in the activation and the change in sleep variables (sleep efficiency and wake time after sleep 
onset). Data were analyzed using voxel by voxel uncorrected threshold of p = 
 0.001. Then we selected only the 
clusters with a probability of activation of p < 
 0.05 after FWE correction for each cluster (extent threshold) unless 
otherwise indicated. A post-hoc power analysis was conducted with G*Power software to determine the retro-
spective power of the key finding of this study32.
