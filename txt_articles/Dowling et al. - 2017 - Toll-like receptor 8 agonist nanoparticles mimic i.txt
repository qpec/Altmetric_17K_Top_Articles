Background: Newborns display distinct immune responses,
leaving them vulnerable to infections and impairing
immunization. Targeting newborn dendritic cells (DCs), which
integrate vaccine signals into adaptive immune responses, might
enable development of age-specific vaccine formulations to
overcome suboptimal immunization.
Objective: Small-molecule imidazoquinoline Toll-like receptor
(TLR) 8 agonists robustly activate newborn DCs but can result
in reactogenicity when delivered in soluble form. We used
rational engineering and age- and species-specific modeling to
construct and characterize polymer nanocarriers encapsulating
a TLR8 agonist, allowing direct intracellular release after
selective uptake by DCs.
Methods: Chemically similar but morphologically distinct
nanocarriers comprised of amphiphilic block copolymers were
engineered for targeted uptake by murine DCs in vivo, and a
range of TLR8 agonist–encapsulating polymersome
formulations were then synthesized. Novel 96-well in vitro assays
using neonatal human monocyte-derived DCs and humanized
TLR8 mouse bone marrow–derived DCs enabled benchmarking
of the TLR8 agonist–encapsulating polymersome formulations
against conventional adjuvants and licensed vaccines, including
live attenuated BCG vaccine. Immunogenicity of the TLR8
agonist adjuvanted antigen 85B (Ag85B)/peptide 25–loaded
BCG-mimicking nanoparticle formulation was evaluated in vivo
by using humanized TLR8 neonatal mice.
Results: Although alum-adjuvanted vaccines induced modest
costimulatory molecule expression, limited TH-polarizing
cytokine production, and significant cell death, BCG induced a
robust adult-like maturation profile of neonatal DCs.
Remarkably, TLR8 agonist polymersomes induced not only
newborn DC maturation profiles similar to those induced by

injection to neonatal mice, the TLR8 agonist–adjuvanted Ag85B
peptide 25 formulation was comparable with BCG in inducing
Ag85B-specific CD41 T-cell numbers.
Conclusion: TLR8 agonist–encapsulating polymersomes hold
substantial potential for early-life immunization against
intracellular pathogens. Overall, our study represents a novel
approach for rational design of early-life vaccines. (J Allergy
Clin Immunol 2017;140:1339-50.)

Human newborns and infants have a high frequency of
infection compared with older children and adults,1 in part
because of distinct early-life immunity with impaired host
defense against intracellular pathogens.2 On challenge with
many stimuli, including bacterial components, children less
than 2 months of age express a strong innate TH2 and
TH17 cell polarization and impaired TH1 cell and innate
antiviral type 1 interferon responses.3 Relatively low innate
TH1 cell support at birth appears to gradually increase over
the first years of life.2 Distinct newborn TH17- and infant
TH2-polarized
responses
potentially
limit
the
efficacy
of
early-life immune response against certain pathogens4,5 and
vaccines.6,7 Because birth is the most reliable point of health
care contact worldwide, neonatal vaccines, such as the live
attenuated
BCG vaccine,
achieve high
global population
penetration.
Therefore
developing
early-life
immunization
strategies, including those directed at tuberculosis, might be
highly advantageous.8
Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) that play a vital role in shaping adaptive immunity. DC
maturation begins when endogenous or exogenous danger
molecules are recognized by pattern recognition receptors
(eg, Toll-like receptors [TLRs]), triggering upregulation of
costimulatory molecules and production of immune-polarizing
cytokines.9

 TNF and IL-12p70, which are important for vaccine-induced pro-
tection against intracellular pathogens.2 Accordingly, develop-
ment of novel adjuvanted vaccine formulations that enhance
the maturation and functionality of human neonatal DCs
might enable a new generation of early-life vaccines.10,11
Unlike
agonists
of
most
TLRs
that
elicit
reduced
TH1
cytokine production by newborn leukocytes, agonists of the
endosomal TLR8,12 such as the synthetic imidazoquinoline
(IMQ) CL075 (TLR8/7 agonist), induce robust TH1-polarizing
responses from both neonatal and adult DCs.13,14
Recent advances in the nascent field of immunoengineering
might guide vaccine design15,16 by enabling targeting of DCs17
through vaccine delivery systems that mimic the size, shape,
and surface chemistry of pathogens.18 Block copolymers of poly
(ethylene glycol)-bl-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-bl-PPS) are
new macromolecular amphiphiles capable offorming a wide range
of self-assembled configurations when dispersed in water19 and
might
present
distinct
advantages
for
human
vaccine
development.20 PEG-bl-PPS aggregates can form a wide variety
of stable morphologies in aqueous solution, including spherical
or cylindrical micelles (filomicelles), as well as liposome-like
vesicles referred to as polymersomes.16 Polymersomes are
significantly more stable than liposomes and can be engineered
for bioresponsive intracellular payload delivery,16 which is highly
advantageous for the specific targeting of endosomal receptors.
Polymersomes
are
effective
adjuvant
and
antigen-delivery
systems, particularly for the induction of T cell–mediated
immunity and the encapsulation of IMQ-derived adjuvants.21,22
Induction of durable TH1-type T-cell immunity might strengthen
newborns’ defenses, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality
associated with intracellular pathogens, such as respiratory
syncytial virus, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.23,24
We undertook an immunoengineering-based16 rational vaccine
design25 approach to develop and characterize a novel polymer-
some nanocarrier encapsulating CL075, which was designated
CL075-PS. CL075 has low water solubility and is a highly potent
immunostimulant that can be systemically toxic. Accordingly, a
targeted delivery system is likely beneficial for minimization of
systemic toxicity and translational application. The in vitro
immunostimulatory activities of CL075-PS on human newborn
and adult monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were
benchmarked
against
conventional
adjuvants
and
human
vaccines, including the live attenuated BCG vaccine, which elicits
moderate TH1 immunity in neonates26 and is safe and effective at
birth.27
Here we characterize the BCG-induced human DC cytokine
and
costimulatory
molecule
expression
compared
with
conventional alum-adjuvanted vaccines and demonstrate that
CL075-PS
matches
or
exceeds
this
BCG-associated
DC
response.28
Compared
with
BCG,
CL075-PS
induced
greater production of IL-12p70, a cytokine that enhances TH1-
polarized immune responses and promotes cytotoxic T-cell prolif-
eration and survival.29 The additional loading of the model HIV-
1-Gag protein into CL075-PS did not negatively influence this
response, triggering a similar protection-associated pattern of im-
mune responses as induced by the whole bacterial vaccine BCG in
newborn human DCs and greatly exceeding BCG-induced pro-
duction of IL-12p70. When coloaded with the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
antigen
85B
(Ag85B)
peptide
25
(p25),
CL075:Ag85Bp25-PS induces Ag85B-specific CD41 T cells in
humanized TLR8 neonatal mice in vivo.
Our observations suggest a strong potential for CL075-PS to
serve as a dual antigen/adjuvant vaccine delivery system for
human neonatal vaccines. Moreover, our age- and species-
specific
approach
for
formulation
development
through
benchmarking new adjuvant formulations with respect to DC
activation and potential reactogenicity profiles of licensed
vaccine formulations30 presents a new in vitro methodology for
the rational design and testing of human newborn vaccines.
METHODS
Ethics statement
All experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant institutional
and national guidelines, regulations, and approvals. Nonidentifiable cord
blood samples were collected with approval from the Ethics Committee of
the Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts (protocol no.
2000-P-000117), and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston, Boston,
Massachusetts (protocol no. 2011P-000118). Blood samples from adult
volunteers were obtained after written informed consent with approval from
the Ethics Committee of Boston Children’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts
(protocol no. X07-05-0223). All murine studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard Medical School
and Boston Children’s Hospital (protocol nos. 3011 and 3130).
In vivo nanocarrier biodistribution
PEG-bl-PPS was amine functionalized at the end of the polypropylene sul-
fide block for conjugation to the fluorophore Dy647-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl
ester (Dyomics GmbH, Jena, Germany). After purification with Sephadex
LH-20 resin and dialysis, the fluorescent block copolymer was self-
assembled into micelles, polymersomes, or filomicelles through thin-film
rehydration. C57BL/6 mice were injected intradermally in the footpad with
30 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution of the fluorescent nanocarriers in PBS
(120 mL in total volume). After 24 hours, the mice were killed, and the popli-
teal, inguinal, axillary, and brachial lymph nodes along with the spleen were
harvested and digested with collagenase D.
Preparations of single-cell suspensions were obtained after filtration of
digested organs through a 70-mm strainer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Calif).
Cells were stained with the following antibody panels: (1) CD207–fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC), MHC class II (MHCII)–phycoerythrin (PE), CD11b-
Cy5.5, CD11c-Cy7, CD103–Pacific Blue, and CD8a–allophycocyanin Cy7
and (2) MHCII-FITC, NK1.1-PE, CD19-PE, Ly6c-Cy5.5, CD11b-Cy7, and
CD11c–allophycocyanin Cy7. Flow cytometry was performed with a CyAn
ADP analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland).
Human MoDC arrays
Heparinized human newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood was
layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM; GE Health-
care, Waukesha, Wis) to collect cord blood mononuclear cell or PBMC layers,
respectively. Monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cell fractions by
means of positive selection with magnetic microbeads, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec), with CD14 as a panmarker.
Monocyte preparations were routinely more than 95% pure, as assessed by
using flow cytometry for CD14, as previously described.13,14,31,32 Isolated
monocytes were cultured in tissue-culture dishes at 0.4 3 106 cells/mL in
RPMI 1640 medium containing fresh 10% autologous platelet-poor plasma
supplemented with recombinant human IL-4 (50 ng/mL) and recombinant
human GM-CSF (100 ng/mL; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) with 1
supplement of fresh medium and cytokines at day 3 of culture. After 5 to
6
days,

Cell viability, ELISA, and multiplex analyte assays
Supernatants derived from human DC stimulations were assayed by means
of ELISA for TNF (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif). Cytokine and
chemokine expression profiles (for IFNg, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 [p70], IL-13,
IL-1b, IL-23, IL-27, IL-28A, IL-33, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein
3a/CCL20, and TNF) in cell-culture supernatants were measured with a
customized Milliplex Human Th17 Magnetic Bead Panel, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, Chicago, Ill). Assays were read and
analyzed on the Luminex 100/200 System with xPOTENT software
(Luminex, Austin, Tex). A minimum threshold was set at the minimum
detectable concentration for each individual assay (defined as 3 SDs greater
than the mean background). Cell death of treated MoDCs was assessed based
on release of active lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into cell supernatants with a
Cytotoxicity Detection Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Diagnostics, Branford, Conn). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentra-
tions in culture supernatants were determined by using a monoclonal enzyme
immunoassay (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, Mich), with the an-
alytic tool provided by Cayman Chemical Company at www.myassays.com.
Immunizations
C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) dams and heterozygous humanized TLR8
(huTLR8Tg) male mice on a C57BL/6 background33 were bred to produce
mixed litters. All littermates from one litter were immunized with the same
formulations to eliminate the possibility of misidentification. Mice were
immunized on day 7 of life and killed 14 days later. Genotyping was per-
formed with tail clippings at 21 days of life. Mice were immunized subcuta-
neously at the scruff of the neck with either 0.2 3 106 colony-forming units
of BCG (Organon Teknika/Merck, Durham, NC) or CL075:Ag85Bp25-PS
containing approximately 8 to 10 mg of Ag85B/p25 (Biomatik, Cambridge,
Ontario, Canada) and approximately 0.1 mg/kg CL075 in a total volume of
25 mL. For flow cytometric analysis, spleens were collected, and a single-
cell suspension was generated and blocked with FcR blocking anti-mouse
CD16/CD32 mAb 2.4G2 at 48C for 10 minutes and then stained for 1 hour
at room temperature with PE-conjugated I-A(b) M tuberculosis Ag85B pre-
cursor 280-294 (FQDAYNAAGGHNAVF) or human class II–associated
invariant chain peptide (PVSKMRMARPLLMQA) tetramers (kindly pro-
duced by the National Institutes of Health MHC Tetramer Core Facility,
Emory University, Atlanta, Ga), as previously described.34 Surface staining
was performed at 48C for 30 minutes with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone
17A2), allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RMA-5), BV421-
conjugated anti-CD44 (clone IM7), and PE-conjugated anti-CD62L (clone
SB/199, all from BD Biosciences). Samples were also labeled with Live/
Dead Fixable Near IR Dead Cell Stain Kit, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). CD441 tetramer-positive (Tet1)
cells were identified after gating for singlets, forward scatter 3 side scatter
lymphocyte characteristics, live cells, and CD4 expression. About 106 cells
were stored for each sample acquired on the LSR II flow cytometer by using
BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif); data analysis was
performed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, Ore).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance and graphic output were generated with Prism
(version 5.0b; GraphPad Software) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Red-
mond, Wash) software. Statistical tests are stated in figure legends. Results
were considered significant at P values of less than .05.
RESULTS
Selection of nanocarrier morphology based on
in vivo biodistribution
We have previously demonstrated that PEG-bl-PPS block co-
polymers can self-assemble in aqueous solutions into a variety
of different morphologies by adjusting the ratios of the sizes of
the hydrophilic (PEG) and hydrophobic (PPS) blocks.19,20 Copol-
ymers with hydrophilic block weight fractions of 0.28, 0.38, and
0.48 respectively, assemble into vesicles also known as polymer-
somes, filomicelles, and spherical micelles that mimic the diverse
nanostructures of virions.21,22 We hypothesized that the use of
pathogen-mimicking nanostructures might enhance invivo target-
ing and uptake by DCs, which have evolved to endocytose and
process nanoscale materials from infective agents for the elicita-
tion and direction of immune responses.
To identify the optimal morphology for in vivo targeting of
diverse DC populations while minimizing nonspecific cellular
uptake, we compared the biodistributions of these PEG-bl-PPS
morphologies within the spleen and injection site–draining
lymph nodes, which are relevant DC-rich secondary lymphoid
organs
essential
to
vaccination.
Amine-functionalized
PEG17-bl-PPS30
block
copolymers
were
conjugated
to
fluorescent Dy647-N-hydroxysuccinimide and assembled in the
presence of block copolymers engineered to form polymersomes
(PEG17-bl-PPS30), filomicelles (PEG45-bl-PPS44), or spherical
micelles (PEG44-bl-PPS29). Cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy revealed the self-assembly of fluorescent 120-nm
polymersomes, 50-nm diameter by micron length filomicelles,
and 30-nm spherical micelles (Fig 1).
Dy647-labeled aggregates were injected subcutaneously into
the footpads of mice, and 24 hours later, leukocytes were isolated
from spleens and lymph nodes for analysis by using flow
cytometry. Noticeably, even though the surface chemistry of the
different PEG-bl-PPS aggregates is identical, different morphol-
ogies associated with drastically different monocytic cell subsets
(Fig 1, B, and see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). These results strongly indicate the influence
of physical structure and size of the various aggregates on their
cellular biodistribution, suggesting that rate of transport, accessi-
bility of the aggregates to different organs, and cell-specific
mechanisms of endocytosis affect their targeting of immune
cell subsets. Although the micelles were extensively taken up
by numerous phagocytic subpopulations in lymph nodes and
spleens, including potentially undesirable high percentages of
neutrophils and eosinophils, the filomicelles were found to
primarily target monocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the spleen (Fig 1, B). In
the spleen more than 50% of the Ly6Chi or Ly6Clo monocyte
population and up to 95% of the pDC population were fluorescent
for the filomicelles. In addition to pDCs, the polymersome
nanocarriers
targeted numerous other
DC
subpopulations,
including approximately 50% of the splenic and approximately
30% of the lymph node–resident CD81 DCs. Uptake of all
aggregates was restricted to CD451 cells, suggesting minimal
to no uptake by stromal cells. Based on these results, we selected
the polymersome nanomaterial morphology for targeting of
CL075 to key DC populations while minimizing nonspecific
uptake after subcutaneous vaccine administration.
Synthesis, loading, and characterization of CL075-PS
A range of polymersome formulations was synthesized to
assess their efficacy for DC activation, including blank (unloaded)
polymersomes and polymersomes loaded with CL075, which we
designate CL075-PS, the capsid protein antigen HIV-1-Gag,
Ag85Bp25, and both CL075 and protein/peptide simultaneously

 (Table I). CL075-PS nanoparticles were assembled by using
thin-film rehydration and purified by means of size exclusion
chromatography
(outlined
in
Fig

article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Optimal loading of
CL075 into polymersomes was observed with encapsulation
efficiencies of greater than 90% when codissolving CL075 and
PEG17-bl-PPS30 in a mutual organic solvent before desiccation
and formation of the thin-film. Analysis of size exclusion chroma-
tography elutions by means of UV/fluorescence spectroscopy
with a PBS mobile phase verified that no free CL075 was present
FIG 1. Polymersomes preferentially associate with DCs in vivo. A, Cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy revealed the self-assembly of approximately 50-nm filomicelles (F; left, PEG45-bl-PPS44),
approximately 120-nm vesicular polymersomes (PS; middle, PEG17-bl-PPS30), or approximately 30-nm
spherical micelles (M; right, PEG44-bl-PPS29). B, Flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions from
mouse lymph nodes and spleens was conducted 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of fluorescent
nanocarriers into the footpad (n 5 5-8). A heat map demonstrates percentages of key phagocyte
populations that associated with PEG-bl-PPS filomicelles (F), vesicular polymersomes (PS), and spherical
micelles (M). Amine-functionalized PEG17-bl-PPS30 block copolymers were conjugated to fluorescent
Dy647-N-hydroxysuccinimide and assembled in the presence of block copolymers engineered to generate
filamentous, vesicular, or spherical morphologies. See also Fig E1.

org). CL075-PS formulations (as illustrated in Fig 2, B) with
concentrations of up to 5.4 mmol/L CL075 were achieved with
loading efficiencies of 10 mg of CL075/1 mg of PEG-bl-PPS
(CL075:PEG-bl-PPS molar ratio of 1:9).
Loading was found to be highly stable, with no leakage of
CL075 detectable (detection limit, approximately 1 ng/mL) for
more than 1 year at 48C in PBS (see Fig E2 and data not shown).
HIV-1-Gag protein was stably loaded into polymersomes by
using previously published protocols for protein antigens.21
Each batch of polymersome was characterized with respect
to quantification of the amount of loaded protein/peptide,
PEG-bl-PPS concentration, average size, polydispersity, and
endotoxin content (Table I). Additionally, when stored in PBS
at 48C, polymersome formulations were routinely stable in size
for more than 180 days (see Fig E4 in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org), with only CL075-PS and
Gag-PS demonstrating minor size changes (approximately 120
to approximately 117 and approximately 154 to approximately
151 nm in diameter, respectively; P < .01).
CL075-PS matches or exceed BCG-induced
activation of human newborn DCs
Ninety-six-well human MoDC arrays were generated by
culturing CD14-selected monocytes with IL-4 and GM-CSF in
the presence of autologous plasma, a rich source of age-specific
soluble
immunomodulatory
factors,35
as
previously
described.14,31 Within 30 minutes after addition to DCs, both
newborn and adult immature DCs internalized fluorescent
polymersomes
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
(see
Fig E5, A, and Video E1 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org and data not show). Furthermore, polymer-
somes colocalized with late endosomal/lysosomal compartments
within 24 hours (see Fig E5, B). Next, immature newborn and
adult DCs were incubated with the adjuvant monophosphoryl
lipid A, LPS, CL075, or CL075-PS for 24 hours (Fig 3). Newborn
DCs demonstrated significantly reduced TLR4-mediated TNF
responses (P < .05) but adult-like TNF production in response to
the CL075-encapsulating polymersome formulation (Fig 3 and
see Fig E6 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org). Interestingly, encapsulation of CL075 did not interfere
with agonist activity, as evident by the concentration-dependent
activity toward both newborn and adult DCs.
Our unique 96-well MoDC array platform next enabled
comparison, for the first time, of concentration-dependent human
newborn and adult MoDC responses to BCG and alum, as well as
conventional alum-adjuvanted vaccines, such as HBV and
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV; Fig 4, A and B, and see
Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org). These induced distinct costimulatory molecule expression,
with BCG inducing greater upregulation of MHCII, CD40,
CD80, and CD86 than observed in the alum group. When
benchmarked against conventional adjuvants and licensed
pediatric vaccines in the MoDC array, CL075-PS induced greater
TNF production than the alum-containing vaccines (HBV and
PCV13), which was very similar to BCG (see Fig E6, A). The
ability of TLR8 agonist–encapsulating polymersomes to mimic
the immunomodulatory effect of the live BCG vaccine toward
neonatal DCs extended to the surface expression of costimulatory
molecules (Fig 4, A and B, and see Fig E6, B, and Table E1). In
response to CL075, CL075-PS, or BCG, a strong upregulation
of CD40, CD86, and CCR7 expression and a modest increase in
MHCII expression was observed. The upregulation of CD80
induced by both CL075-containing formulations was greater
than that induced by BCG. CL075-PS did not induce as much
LDH release as did BCG, suggesting lower potential for cell
death/cytotoxicity (Fig 4, C), whereas PGE2 production (Fig 4,
D), a potential biomarker for reactogenicity,36 was similar that
seen with the well-tolerated BCG.
We next characterized the ability of polymersomes, CL075, or
CL075-PS (the latter 2 at 0.1-10 mmol/L CL075) to induce
concentration-dependent cytokine production from newborn and
adult DCs (see Figs E7 and E8 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org). As expected, polymersomes alone did not
induce significant cytokine production for any TH cell–polarizing
cytokines, whereas CL075 and CL075-PS induced concentration-
dependent production of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF.

 CL075:Gag-PS generated markedly similar cytokine production
profiles (see Figs E9 and E10, A and B, in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org). Moreover, when bench-
marked against conventional adjuvants and vaccines, both
newborn and adult DCs treated with CL075:Gag-PS induced
cytokine responses strikingly resembling the polarization and
magnitude of those induced by BCG alone (Fig 5, A and B).
Alum and the alum-adjuvanted HBV and PCV induced limited
or no cytokine production. However, in comparing CL075:Gag-
PS with BCG, 2 differences were noted: (1) CL075:Gag-PS
induced greater production of IL-12p70 (at both 5 and
10 mmol/L, P < .01) in both newborn and adult DCs (Fig 5, C
and D, and see Fig E10, A and B), and (2) a similar pattern was
observed for IFNg at the highest concentrations tested (P < .01,
Fig 5, A; P < .05, Fig 5, B). Additionally, although LPS-induced
IL-12p70 production was higher in adult DCs, significant differ-
ences between CL075-PS–stimulated MoDCs from adults and
newborns were only evident at the 10 mmol/L concentration
(see Fig E10, C).

cells in humanized TLR8 neonatal mice
Having
demonstrated
nanocarrier
morphology-dependent
in vivo biodistribution, as well as CL075-PS–induced activation
of human DCs in vitro, we next aimed to evaluate the potential
of antigen-loaded CL075-PS formulations in vivo. Of note, eval-
uation of TLR8 agonist–adjuvanted vaccine formulations in mice
is complicated by the fact that murine TLR8 does not recognize
the same agonists as human TLR8.37 To account for this species
specificity of TLR8 function, we assessed the effect of antigen-
loaded CL075-PS on the in vitro activation of murine DCs, as
well as induction of antigen-specific immunogenicity using
neonatal humanized TLR8 (huTLR8Tg) mice.33 huTLR8Tg
mice are an excellent model to evaluate our CL075-PS formula-
tions because both the function and cellular distribution of human
TLR8 in these transgenic mice is similar to that in human sub-
jects.33 When compared with bone marrow–derived dendritic
cells (BMDCs) of WT littermates, BMDCs from 7-day-old
neonatal huTLR8Tg mice, which selectively express the gene
for human TLR8 (see Fig E11, A, in this article’s Online Repos-
itory at www.jacionline.org), had a significantly greater innate
immune response to TLR8-selective stimulation (see Fig E11,
B-D), whereas the response to a TLR7 agonist was similar (see
Fig E11, E-G). To directly assess whether CL075-PS–stimulated
murine BMDC responses align with our results observed in hu-
man MoDCs, we stimulated 7-day-old newborn-derived BMDCs
for 24 hours with fixed concentrations of monophosphoryl lipid
A (100 ng/mL), free CL075, CL075-PS (see Fig E12, A, in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), BCG, or
alum-adjuvanted vaccines before collection of supernatants for
TNF, IL-6, and IL-1b measurement (see Fig E12, B-D). These
murine BMDC data recapitulate the results from our human
MoDC experiments, suggesting that newborn huTLR8Tg mice
represent a rational model for assessing the potential of CL075-
PS in vivo.
Next, we coloaded our CL075-PS formulation with the M
tuberculosis

that CL075-Ag85Bp25-PS induced robust induction of Ag85B-
specific CD41 effector T cells in the spleens of neonatal mice
similar to BCG vaccination (Fig 6, B). CL075-Ag85Bp25-PS

and D). Importantly, no significant difference was noted between
neonatal huTLR8Tg mice vaccinated with either BCG or
CL075-Ag85Bp25-PS (P < .01; Fig 6, E), whereas significantly
more Ag85B-specific CD41 T cells were detected in the spleens
of BCG or CL075-Ag85Bp25-PS-immunized huTLR8Tg mice

 DISCUSSION
Modern adjuvanted vaccine design integrates knowledge of
formulation composition and insight into the mechanisms of
immunostimulation to generate immune responses not otherwise
achievable in relevant target populations.11,38 New adjuvant
formulations and antigen delivery systems might be key to
tailoring vaccines to match the characteristics of a given
vulnerable target population, such as newborns and infants.2
Here we have combined engineering and rational vaccine design
approaches to develop a nanoparticle-based adjuvant and antigen
delivery system designed to be active in human newborns and in-
fants that mimics and in some instances exceeds the immunosti-
mulatory effect of the live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine BCG
on
human
neonatal
DCs.
We
show
that
the
assembled
morphology of our block copolymers directed the in vivo uptake
by APCs to allow targeting of diverse DC subsets. DCs are desir-
able targets because they are highly efficient at processing and
inducing immunity against nanoscale pathogens and their compo-
nents.18 Although previous studies have linked nanoparticle size,
shape, and elasticity to enhanced circulation time and decreased
clearance by the reticuloendothelial system,39,40 to the best of
our knowledge, our data are the first to demonstrate that chemi-
cally identical but morphologically different nanocarriers can
be engineered for selective uptake by monocytic cell subsets,
with key DC populations essential for vaccination preferring
PEG17-bl-PPS30 PS.
Guided by our in vivo biodistribution results, we next devel-
oped DC-targeting PEG17-bl-PPS30 polymersomes loaded with
CL075, a highly selective thiazoloquinoline TLR8 agonist. We
have previously demonstrated that TLR8 agonists robustly
activate human newborn leukocytes in vitro13,14,41 and that
targeted delivery of TLR agonists to human and mouse DCs
can amplify their adjuvanticity.42
Here, using formulation chemistry and without the need for
extensive medicinal chemistry,43 we prepared polymersome
formulations containing high concentrations (>5 mmol/L) of
CL075 that were stable for several months. We demonstrated pre-
viously that IMQ-loaded polymersomes released their payloads
after selective uptake by DCs and intracellular disruption for
induced expression of cytokines and surface coreceptors.21 We
noted similarly favorable cellular pharmacodynamic properties
for CL075-PS, which in addition to stimulating adult DCs also
induced TH1-polarizing responses from neonatal DCs. The vast
majority of studies of newborn pattern recognition receptor
agonist responses in vitro and in vivo describe impaired produc-
tion of TH1 cytokines, such as IL-12p70, likely limiting the
immunogenicity of such candidate adjuvants invaccines targeting
intracellular pathogens.2,44 In this context our development of ad-
juvanted nanoparticle formulations with robust TH1-polarizing
activity in early life is notable and might have translational
implications Furthermore, our polymersome nanoparticle plat-
form is versatile and amenable to codelivery of different antigens
and adjuvants within the same formulation, as demonstrated by
loading of either HIV-1-Gag protein or Ag85Bp25 with CL075.
By using in vitro human and murine DC assays, we bench-
marked the immunomodulatory abilities of CL075-PS against
FIG 5. TLR8 agonist–encapsulating polymersomes match or exceed BCG’s cytokine-inducing activity,
dramatically enhancing human neonatal and adult MoDC IL-12p70 production. Newborn (A and C) and adult
(B and D) MoDCs were cultured in 10% (vol/vol) autologous plasma and stimulated for 24 hours with
increasing concentrations of CL075:Gag-PS (red; 1, 5, and 10 mmol/L), BCG (blue), PCV13 (purple), HBV
(green; each at 1:1000, 1:100, and 1:10 vol/vol), or alum (5, 50, 500 and mg/mL; orange). Concentration-
dependent cytokine production induction was measured in supernatants by using the multiplex assay.
Data represent fold change over vehicle control (black; mean 6 SEM, n 5 6). For analyses of individual
treatments (eg, control 10 mmol/L CL075:Gag-PS vs BCG 1:10 [vol/vol]), the unpaired Mann-Whitney test
was applied at each concentration, and statistical significance was denoted as follows: **P < .01. For
comparisons between overall groups (eg, CL075:Gag-PS vs BCG), significance was denoted as
follows: 11P < .01. See also Figs E9 and E10.

 several adjuvants and licensed pediatric vaccines. Although
previous studies have investigated the invitro stimulatory abilities
of vaccines on human DCs,45 ours is the first to do so using both
newborn and adult cells cultured in intact (eg, non–heat
inactivated) autologous plasma, a rich source of age-specific
immunomodulatory
factors.35
Because
injection
site
and
systemic reactogenicity are key considerations in developing
novel vaccines, in vitro human leukocyte studies might directly
de-risk formulation selection for in vivo use.46,47 We found that
a novel TLR8 agonist nanoparticle formulation mimicked the
BCG-induced adult-like maturation signature in neonatal DCs.
CL075-PS induced a similar in vitro PGE2 production profile
compared with BCG, a biomarker that might correlate with
adjuvants/adjuvanted
vaccine–associated
reactogenicity
in vivo.36 Of note, this adult-like immunomodulatory effect of
CL075-PS on neonatal DCs corresponded with lower LDH
release than BCG vaccine, suggesting reduced induction of cell
death. CL075-PS not only matched the BCG-induced pattern
for most innate DC responses measured but actually exceeded
BCG with respect to inducing production of IL-12p70 and
IFNg, suggesting a strong capacity of this novel nanoparticle
formulation to favor TH1 immunity in newborns. When coloaded
with the M tuberculosis Ag85Bp25, CL075:Ag85Bp25-PS
induced BCG-like antigen-specific CD41 adaptive immune
responses in humanized TLR8 transgenic neonatal mice in vivo.
Our
studies
suggest
that
nanoparticle
polymersome
formulations hold great promise in the development of new
early-life vaccines targeting intracellular pathogens. For example,
although BCG is largely safe and reduces the risk of disseminated
early-life tuberculosis, disadvantages of this live attenuated
vaccine include inconsistent production resulting in both
type-by-type (eg, BCG-Denmark vs BCG-India) and lot-to-lot
variability that can affect clinical efficacy,48 as well as the risk of
disseminated BCG infection (‘‘BCGosis’’) in those with certain
primary
immunodeficiencies.49
Accordingly,
novel vaccine
formulations with a more practical production path that induce
protection against disseminated tuberculosis in early life might
be of substantial public health benefit. The ability of CL075-PS
to activate neonatal MoDCs to levels similar to their adult coun-
terparts is particularly noteworthy and suggests that this
adjuvantation platform might have applicability for early-life
immunization, including development of novel vaccines against
intracellular pathogens, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.
In summary, by combining nanotechnology, age- and species-
specific in vitro modeling, and benchmarking to licensed
vaccines, our study provides a fresh paradigm for rational vaccine
design to inform development of novel age-targeted neonatal and
pediatric vaccines. We characterized the in vitro and in vivo
immunostimulatory activities of a novel polymersome-based
adjuvant
formulation
rationally
designed
for
limited
bioavailability and intracellular delivery of the thiazoquinolone
TLR8 agonist CL075 to murine and human newborn and adult
DCs. By benchmarking to licensed vaccines in vitro, we found
that CL075-PS induced adult-like responses in neonatal DCs
that matched or exceeded activation induced by BCG, an effective
in neonatal vaccine. More broadly, this study outlines a rational
