Abstract 
The heterogeneous nature of asthma has been understood for decades, but the precise categorization of asthma has 
taken on new clinical importance in the era of specific biologic therapy. The simple categories of allergic and non-
allergic asthma have given way to more precise phenotypes that hint at underlying biologic mechanisms of variable 
airflow limitation and airways inflammation. Understanding these mechanisms is of particular importance for the 
approximately 10% of patients with severe asthma. Biomarkers that aid in phenotyping allow physicians to “person-
alize” treatment with targeted biologic agents. Unfortunately, testing for these biomarkers is not routine in patients 
whose asthma is refractory to standard therapy. Scientific advances in the recognition of sensitive and specific bio-
markers are steadily outpacing the clinical availability of reliable and non-invasive assessment methods designed for 
the prompt and specific diagnosis, classification, treatment, and monitoring of severe asthma patients. This article pro-
vides a practical overview of current biomarkers and testing methods for prompt, effective management of patients 
with severe asthma that is refractory to standard therapy.

Background
Asthma remains a significant worldwide health condi-
tion in terms of both prevalence and severity within all 
regions and amongst every age group. There are an esti-
mated 235–334 million asthma sufferers worldwide [1, 2], 
Asthma is responsible for approximately 250,000 deaths 
annually [3]. In Canada, physician-diagnosed asthma 
was reported by approximately 2.4 million Canadians 
aged ≥ 12 years, corresponding to approximately 8.1% of 
the country’s population [4]. Asthma rates are higher in 
children; the National Longitudinal Survey of Children 
and Youth (from 1994/1995 to 2008/2009) determined 
an asthma prevalence of 9.8% in Canadian children aged 
2–7 years [5].
The heterogeneous nature of asthma has been well 
established with the recognition of multiple path-
ways, mediators, and systems involved in triggering the 
characteristic airway inflammation and variable airflow 
limitation of asthma. Ongoing classification of different 
asthma phenotypes is a reflection of this heterogeneity. 
Indeed, severe asthma is often recognized as a specific 
asthma phenotype rather than an extreme manifesta-
tion of more commonplace asthma variants [6–8]. Severe 
asthma is defined by the joint European Respiratory Soci-
ety/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines 
according to the following criteria [9]:
  
•
Requirement for treatment with high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller (and/or 
systemic corticosteroids) to maintain control.
  
•
Refractory to the treatment mentioned above.
  
•
Incomplete management of comorbidities such as 
severe sinus disease or obesity.
The prevalence of severe, refractory asthma is generally 
estimated to be 5–10% of the total asthma population [9–
14]. It is important to distinguish between asthma that is 
difficult to control and asthma that is truly severe. Initial 
assessment must rule out treatment confounders such as

poor patient adherence and improper device technique 
as potential causes of suboptimal treatment response [9, 
14–16]. The ERS/ATS guidelines cite reports indicating 
non-adherence as high as 32–56% [9]. Pooled data from 
18 studies (January 1980 to October 2013) using elec-
tronic measurement of adherence to ICS among children 
with asthma determined a range of mean adherence rates 
of 28–71% (14 studies) and median adherence rates of 
58–92% (4 studies) [17]. Although assessment of adher-
ence can be challenging, physicians can encourage opti-
mal self-management through open communication and 
shared decision making with the patient and family, edu-
cation about the benefits of treatment and proper usage, 
and routine verification of medication usage and inhaler 
technique [15, 16]. Treatment regimens should take 
into consideration preferences that are important to the 
patient and caregiver [15].
Biologic agents have been shown to be effective and 
safe in patients with moderate to severe asthma but with 
variable response amongst patients with different phe-
notypes [18–30]. The emergence of specific and sensi-
tive biomarkers has equipped the treating physician 
with important tools to tailor therapy towards optimal 
outcomes.
The objectives of this article are to:
  
•
Evaluate the role of biomarkers in the identification 
of specific patient phenotypes towards selection 
of the most appropriate biologic for an individual 
patient.
  
•
Describe testing options for various biomarkers 
with respect to their reliability, noninvasiveness, and 
accessibility.
  
•
Review biologic agents established as safe and effec-
tive in the management of asthma resistant to stand-
ard treatment.
Asthma phenotypes
From its origins in ancient Greek literature [31], the term 
“asthma” has evolved from a single disease entity, defined 
by a short list of clinical symptoms relating to the airway, 
to a broad term encompassing several distinct subgroups. 
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a phenotype as 
“the observable properties of an organism that are pro-
duced by the interactions of the genotype and the envi-
ronment” [32].
The establishment of a definitive list of asthma pheno-
types has been hindered by both the absence of a unified 
system of classification and by confounding comorbidi-
ties and co-existing conditions (Table 1) [33, 34]. Within 
this present uncertainty, several groups have attempted 
to identify and define the most prevalent phenotypes. The 
Asthma Phenotypes Task Force—a collaboration of the 
United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma 
and Immunology, the ERS, and the ATS—proposed nine 
asthma phenotypes in three general categories (Table 2) 
[33]. Asthma phenotypes are generally separated accord-
ing to allergy status, age of onset, and association with 
patient characteristics (e.g., exercise-induced, obesity 
related) [34–39].
Allergic asthma is widely identified as the most com-
mon phenotype [15, 33, 34, 40–43], particularly among 
children [44, 45]. Approximately 60% of asthma is consid-
ered allergic [41, 42]. Atopy was described in the NHLBI 
and National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 
(NAEPP) 2007 Expert Panel Report 3 as the “strongest 
identifiable predisposing factor” for the development of 
asthma [15]. Furthermore, multi-allergen screening to 
define atopy was cited as the sole core biomarker rec-
ommendation by an expert working group organized 
by National Institutes of Health institutes and federal

agencies [46]. Inflammation in allergic asthma is initiated 
by the activity of antigen-presenting cells that promote 
the production of type 2 T helper (Th2) cells from naïve T 
lymphocytes. Th2 cells then mediate the allergic asthma 
pathway through proinflammatory cytokines—i.e., inter-
leukins (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13—leading to the pro-
duction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) early in the cascade 
and, later, eosinophils (Fig. 1) [47]. Allergic asthma is typ-
ically identified based on sensitization, as determined by 
at least one positive skin prick test to a perennial and/or 
clinically relevant allergen or in vitro testing for IgE.
Non-allergic asthma has been shown to have one or 
more different pathways leading to airway inflammation. 
Cytokines originating in the epithelium (IL-25, IL-33, 
and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) activate type 2 innate 
lymphoid cells, from which IL-5 and IL-13 are produced 
and contribute to elevated eosinophil levels, mucus 
hypersecretion, and airway inflammation and hyper-
reactivity (Fig. 1) [47–49]. Non-allergic asthma tends to 
develop later in life and more predominantly in women 
than the allergic variety [33, 50, 51]. The prevalence of 
non-allergic asthma is generally considered to be 10–33% 
[51]. It appears to be associated with more severe asthma 
and a lower responsiveness to standard therapy [51]. 
Non-allergic asthma is diagnosed when allergic sensitiza-
tion cannot be demonstrated using skin prick or in vitro 
IgE testing.
More precise identification of phenotypes may lead to 
the classification of asthma by endotypes. Endotypes are 
described as distinct asthma entities, as found in phe-
notype clusters, that are defined by a specific biologi-
cal mechanism, providing a better understanding of the 
observable properties of that phenotype [34, 52].
Biomarkers
The identification and continued refinement of asthma 
phenotypes has given rise to a more personalized, tar-
geted management approach, particularly in patients 
with severe refractory asthma [53]. Biological markers 
aid in our understanding and recognition of phenotypes, 
help to identify other treatments most likely to be effec-
tive for the individual asthma patient with an inadequate

response to first-line pharmacotherapy, and have the 
potential to assess treatment response. The ongoing 
Assessing Biomarkers in a Real-world Severe Asthma 
(ARIETTA) study is evaluating the relationship between 
asthma biomarkers and disease-related health outcomes 
in approximately 1200 patients with severe asthma within 
more than 20 countries [54]. Other collaborations such 
as the Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Res-
piratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) project [55, 
56] and the Airways Disease Endotyping for Personal-
ized Therapeutics (ADEPT) study group [57] have also 
contributed findings on the utility of asthma biomark-
ers. Currently targeted asthma biomarkers are listed in 
Table 3.
IgE
Allergen-specific IgE is the predominant biomarker for 
allergic asthma [58–60]. Its production is stimulated 
early in the allergic asthma cascade by the release of IL-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13 through activated Th2 cells. IgE binds to 
FcεRI, which is expressed by several cells including mast 
cells, basophils, eosinophils, and B lymphocytes. The 
subsequent binding of allergens to allergen-specific IgE 
activates the release of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., 
tryptase, histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes), result-
ing in allergic symptoms [61–63]. Serum IgE levels have 
been shown to correlate closely with the presence and 
severity of asthma in adults, adolescents, and children 
[44, 58, 64–69]. It was also determined that serum IgE 
levels were associated with airway hyper-responsiveness, 
even in patients without a history of asthma symptoms or 
atopy [70].
Eosinophils
Produced in the bone marrow, eosinophils are recruited 
into areas of inflammation through complex interac-
tions among cytokines and several other molecules [71]. 
Eosinophils depend particularly on IL-5 for their matu-
ration, activation, and survival [47, 48]. Eosinophils can 
be measured in both blood and sputum; the values differ 
significantly as a reflection of the local (sputum) versus 
systemic (blood) nature of these measurement methods 
(see the sections on blood and sputum testing). As with 
IgE, the presence of significant eosinophilia is associated 
with severe asthma; [8, 72–76] however, severe asthma is 
not identified exclusively with eosinophilia [6]. Kamath 
et al. argued against eosinophil being the most impor-
tant effector cells in the pathogenesis of asthma based

on findings that demonstrated: (1) the presence of air-
way lumen eosinophilic inflammation is present in only 
50% of patients; (2) intense eosinophilic inflammation 
alone does not induce asthma; and (3) a high frequency 
of exacerbations occurs even in the absence of airway 
eosinophilia [77]. Thus, the specific role of eosinophils in 
asthma severity remains a point of controversy [78].
Neutrophils
Neutrophils are the most abundant cell type found in 
induced sputum samples, independent of asthma status 
[76, 79]. Markedly increased numbers of airway neutro-
phils were found in association with severe asthma and 
in patients experiencing acute severe exacerbations [76, 
79–82]. Neutrophils are triggered by IL-8 and produce 
enzymes and other factors that contribute to eosinophil 
activity [83]. Although it has been asserted that eosino-
philic and neutrophilic asthma are not mutually exclu-
sive conditions [77], neutrophilic inflammation has been 
shown to be associated with lower levels of forced expira-
tory volume in 1 s  
(FEV1), particularly post bronchodila-
tor use, and methacholine responsiveness independent of 
eosinophilia [76, 80].
Cytokines
As indicated in the descriptions of the previously listed 
biomarkers, both the allergic and non-allergic pathways 
of asthma inflammation are mediated at multiple points 
by the various ILs. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 originate from 
Th2 lymphocytes and mast cells, and are involved in the 
mediation of Th2 inflammation [13, 84–88]. IL-5 selec-
tively acts on eosinophils and basophils; it promotes 
eosinophil recruitment, differentiation, maturation, and 
activation [84, 89, 90], as well as the maturation, growth, 
activation, and survival of basophils [91]. IL-4 and IL-13 
are active in IgE synthesis, and mediate eosinophil 
recruitment and activation, mucus secretion, and air-
way remodelling [84, 92, 93]. IL-13 is also involved in the 
activation and proliferation of bronchial fibroblasts that 
increase in bronchial hyper-responsiveness [94, 95].
IL-9 and IL-11 have been shown to be more specifi-
cally involved in the severe asthma cascade [13, 96]. IL-9 
is derived from Th2 cells, but can also be produced by a 
host of other cells under specific conditions [97]. It is a 
significant contributor to the differentiation and prolif-
eration of mast cells [98, 99]. IL-11 has been shown to 
be involved in chronic airway remodelling [96]. IL-17 is 
another cytokine that has been correlated with severe 
asthma [100–102]. Researchers have found an associa-
tion between IL-17 and increased neutrophilic airway 
inflammation [103], as well as with the induction of IL-6 
and the production of IL-8 from fibroblasts [104].
Cytokines such as IL-25 and IL-33 are active in the 
early stages of the inflammatory cascades of both allergic 
and non-allergic asthma. IL-25 and IL-33 are involved in 
the stimulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), 
which are another source of IL-5, IL-13, and (to a lesser 
extent) IL-4 [47, 105–107]. A number of genome-wide 
association studies have identified IL-33 and its receptor 
genes as highly implicated in the development of asthma 
[108].
IL-22 appears to exhibit both pro- and anti-inflamma-
tory activity. It is found in high concentration in patients 
with severe asthma [109], and blockage of IL-22 sig-
nificantly reduces eosinophilic inflammation, eosinophil 
recruitment, mucus production, and Th2 cytokine pro-
duction in an asthmatic mouse model [110]. In the same 
study, however, IL-22 inhibition resulted in increased 
Th2 cytokine production and greater allergic lung inflam-
mation. This effect may be secondary to the inhibition of 
IL-22, with the increased production of IL-25 in lung epi-
thelial cells [111].
IL-23 is involved in the differentiation of Th17 cells and 
in the production of IL-17 and IL-22 [112–115]. It is also 
a key regulator of IL-17 [116].
Periostin
The extracellular matrix protein, periostin, has been 
found to be a downstream molecule of IL-4 and IL-13, 
which upregulate periostin expression in bronchial 
epithelial cells and fibroblasts [117–119]. IL-13-stim-
ulated epithelial cells secrete periostin into the extra-
cellular matrix. It plays a role in the regulation of 
eosinophil recruitment and tissue infiltration, accu-
mulation in Th2 mucosal inflammation, and is also 
involved in airway remodelling and increased expres-
sion of inflammatory mediators [120, 121]. Periostin 
has been proposed as a surrogate biomarker for type 2 
immunity to predict the efficacy of treatments target-
ing IL-13 and IgE [122].
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP‑4)
Little research has been published on the activity of 
DPP-4 in human asthma. Rat models have shown 
increased enzyme activity further to allergen challenge 
[123], and topical (but not oral) DPP-4 inhibition in rats 
reduced airway hyper-responsiveness [124]. In human 
subjects, IL-13 was identified as a significant inducer 
of DPP-4 [125]. DPP-4 has been found to be a stimula-
tor of proliferation of bronchial smooth muscle cells and 
human fetal lung fibroblasts, and it promotes the produc-
tion of fibronectin [126]. There is evidence that DPP-4 
may serve as a biomarker for aspirin-exacerbated respira-
tory disease [127].

Currently available tests: practical points 
for optimal use
The identification of biomarkers has been shown to pro-
vide valuable information and guidance for selecting 
therapies that can result in best patient outcomes. How-
ever, in order for this information to become actionable, 
the testing method must be sufficiently sensitive and spe-
cific. The practicality of a biomarker test is inversely pro-
portional to its invasiveness. Also, availability and cost to 
the healthcare system and/or the patient are also neces-
sary to consider for the selection of the most appropriate 
test.
The current diagnosis of asthma through a combina-
tion of clinical history with pulmonary function testing 
and methacholine or exercise challenge test [128] does 
not specifically characterize or quantify airway inflam-
mation. 
Bronchoscopy/biopsy 
and 
bronchoalveolar 
lavage continue to be useful for the assessment of the 
asthma patient and for detection of asthma biomarkers, 
and are safe even in severe asthma when proper precau-
tions are used [129–135]. However, the invasive nature of 
these procedures limits their usefulness, particularly for 
the purpose of ongoing monitoring.
As a standard approach, all patients with moderate to 
severe or difficult-to-treat asthma should undergo the 
following tests:
  
•
Aeroallergen skin prick testing.
  
•
Total IgE.
  
•
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, 
including blood eosinophil level.
These tests are reliable and are easily accessed in the 
Canadian healthcare system. Additional tests may be 
considered, depending on the specific patient profile. 
Details of available tests are presented below.
Allergy skin testing
Skin prick testing is a widely available, inexpensive, sim-
ple, and minimally invasive method to assess the patient’s 
allergic status to an IgE-mediated allergen [16, 136]. 
Another advantage is that results are generally known 
within 15–20 min of application of the reagents to the 
skin. Skin prick testing can also be used to test for atopic 
response to less common allergens for which no spe-
cific IgE antibody test is available, such as some medica-
tions [136]. The test has been found to be sensitive when 
performed by an experienced tester with standardized 
extracts, and reproducible [16, 136, 137]. In this popu-
lation, technique is as important as testing device to 
maximize accuracy of outcome [138]. The need for a con-
sensus on minimal tester standards has been highlighted 
to minimize the gap between expert recommendation 
and daily practice [139].
Blood IgE testing
Testing of a patient’s blood remains an important compo-
nent in the diagnosis of asthma; the detection of elevated 
IgE levels and eosinophils can be used to assist in iden-
tifying allergic sensitivity. Specific IgE (i.e., IgE directed 
against a specific allergen) and eosinophil count were 
confirmed as the most consistent biomarkers to measure 
the risk of asthma in children [140]. Agreement between 
in vitro specific IgE and skin prick testing was 85–90%, 
depending on the allergen and testing method [136]. In 
a comparison between the two methods to detect airway 
reactivity to house dust mite, skin prick testing was more 
sensitive but IgE testing was more specific [141]. Meas-
urement of specific and total (i.e., sum of all specific IgE 
levels) serum IgE levels can be useful in the diagnosis of 
asthma and to distinguish between allergic and non-aller-
gic asthma [61, 62, 68, 142–144]. Measurement of total 
IgE is also essential to determine suitable candidates for 
treatment with omalizumab (i.e., those with serum total 
IgE levels in the range of 30–700 IU/mL), as well as to 
establish proper dosing. Specific IgE does not improve 
reliability over skin prick testing and is more expensive; 
however, it can be advantageous to use in uncooperative 
patients, those who have extensive skin conditions, or if 
their allergy history indicated a risk of anaphylaxis [135]. 
If specific IgE is being ordered for consideration of select-
ing an appropriate biologic agent, screening for perennial 
allergens such as dust mite would have the best ration-
ale. The mean total serum IgE concentration for healthy 
adults was identified in 1969 as 250 ng/mL, compared 
with a mean level of up to 2800 ng/mL in atopic individu-
als and 1600 ng/mL for those with extrinsic asthma [145]. 
Normal total serum IgE is now understood to be age-
dependent [145, 146]. The reference intervals range from 
2 to 34 IU/mL in infants aged 6–12 months to 2–696 IU/
mL in children aged 9–12 years, and then decreases to 
2–214 IU/mL for adults aged ≥ 18 years (Table 4) [147]. 
Interestingly, total and specific serum IgE were found to 
decrease with age in patients with asthma [148].
Other blood tests
Blood eosinophil count is an accurate diagnostic indica-
tor of mild, moderate, and severe eosinophilic asthma 
[149–153]. Blood eosinophil count and the level of serum 
eosinophil protein were shown to be indicators of the 
short-term increases in asthma symptoms (wheezing, 
cough, dyspnea, and exercise-induced asthma) and bron-
chial hyper-responsiveness, reduction in  
FEV1, and the 
need for corticosteroid treatment in patients with mild to

moderate asthma [154]. Clinical trials involving mepoli-
zumab found that the rate of clinically significant asthma 
exacerbations varied according to blood eosinophil level, 
as opposed to sputum [26, 150, 151]. The normal range 
of blood eosinophil count is 30–350 cells/µL; [155] how-
ever, there is controversy with respect to the cut off level 
associated with increased risk of asthma complications. 
Mepolizumab trials employed blood eosinophil cut offs 
of ≥ 150 to ≥ 300 cells/µL [24–26, 151, 156]. This is in 
line with the findings of the Epidemiological study on the 
Genetics and Environment of Asthma group, who con-
cluded that a blood eosinophil level ≥ 250 cells/µL cor-
related with more active asthma (i.e., lower  
FEV1) [157]. 
However, several studies determined that poor asthma 
control was associated with a higher eosinophil cut off. 
A large-scale (N = 130,248) UK cohort study used nega-
tive binomial regression to identify that poorer asthma 
control and more severe exacerbations were experienced 
by patients with blood eosinophil counts > 400 cells/µL 
[158]. Zieger et al. likewise concluded that a blood eosin-
ophil count > 400 cells/µL was an independent risk factor 
for asthma exacerbations and asthma-related emergency 
department visits or hospitalizations [153].
Other useful evaluations
Serum periostin
Elevated serum levels of periostin have been associated 
with asthma activity and severity, and with the presence 
of late-onset eosinophilic asthma [159, 160]. Organizers 
of the Bronchoscopic Exploratory Research Study of Bio-
markers in Corticosteroid-refractory Asthma (BOBCAT) 
concluded that serum periostin is potentially useful for 
the selection of agents that target Th2 inflammation 
[161]. In their study, eosinophil-high and eosinophil-low 
subjects were differentiated by periostin with a posi-
tive predictive value of 93%, and serum periostin levels 
were more consistent than blood eosinophil counts. This 
group also determined that serum periostin was a sig-
nificantly better predictor of airway eosinophilia than 
other biomarkers tested, including IgE, peripheral blood 
eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and 
YKL-40 [161]. Wagener et al. concluded, however, that 
periostin did not distinguish between eosinophilic and 
non-eosinophilic airway inflammation [149]. A precise 
definition of high periostin levels has not been estab-
lished; most studies involving lebrikizumab employed the 
median periostin level across the study cohort as the cut 
off between high- and low-periostin groups [162–164]. 
The requirement of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay limits the availability of this test, and periostin lev-
els are rarely obtained outside of clinical research.
Induced sputum
Induction of a sputum sample is an effective and non-
invasive method of biomarker collection in asthma 
patients as young as 6 years of age [128, 165, 166]. This 
test produces a differential count of 400 inflammatory cell 
types, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, 
lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. Reproducibility, valid-
ity, and responsiveness have been demonstrated [167, 
168]. In a population of healthy adults in Western Can-
ada, Davidson et al. determined the following mean 
(± standard deviation) differential cell percentages: 
neutrophils 50.3 ± 23.5%; eosinophils 1.4 ± 2.3%; mac-
rophages 43 ± 22.8%; lymphocytes 2.6 ± 5.2%; and bron-
chial epithelial cells 2.2 ± 4.8% [169]. Induced sputum 
has also been instrumental in identifying four inflamma-
tory phenotypes: eosinophilic, neutrophilic, paucigranu-
locytic (i.e., normal neutrophil and eosinophil levels), 
and mixed granulocytic (i.e., elevated levels of both neu-
trophils and eosinophils) [166]. The disadvantages of 
induced sputum counts in Canada include high cost, 
technical demand, required time, and limited availability 
to only a few sites across Canada.
The Canadian Thoracic Society’s (CTS) 2012 asthma 
guidelines identified a mean differential sputum eosino-
phil count of < 2–3% as normal [128]. An elevated eosin-
ophil count is associated with symptomatic asthma. 
During a response to airborne allergen exposure [167], 
ICs were shown to reduce eosinophil count [167, 170, 
171], and a systematic review by Petsky et al. found that 
asthma treatment adjusted to sputum eosinophil count 
was associated with a significant reduction in the number 
of exacerbations [172]. The CTS guidelines suggest that 
sputum eosinophil counts be measured in adult asthma 
patients for the adjustment of anti-inflammatory treat-
ment [128], and conducted in conjunction with standard 
asthma control assessment.
Sputum periostin is associated with persistent air-
flow limitation, as well as ICS resistance in eosino-
philic asthma [173]. It is also a potential marker for 
airway remodelling [174]. Simpson et al. determined that

periostin levels are significantly lower in sputum than in 
serum, and while both sputum and serum periostin levels 
are significantly related to sputum eosinophil levels, nei-
ther exhibits a high level of prediction of the presence of 
eosinophilic asthma [175].
FeNO
The generation of nitric oxide in the airways is indica-
tive of Th2 inflammation [176, 177]. Study results conflict 
regarding the ability of FeNO to classify asthma severity 
[178–181]. In a six-year longitudinal study of patients 
with difficult-to-treat asthma, van Veen et al. determined 
that FeNO can predict accelerated decline of lung func-
tion [182]. FeNO assessed airway inflammation as accu-
rately as induced sputum analysis [183], and predicted 
asthma relapse in asymptomatic children in the month 
after ICS discontinuation [184].
The CTS guidelines have not recommended rou-
tine use of FeNO for the adjustment of ICS dose, citing 
insufficient evidence [128]. This conclusion is in line 
with guidelines published by the ERS/ATS, the NHLBI/
NAEPP, and the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Inter-
collegiate Guidelines Network [9, 15, 185]. However, 
FeNO is supported by the ATS for the detection of 
eosinophilic airway inflammation, assessing the potential 
need for and probability of response to ICS, and evalu-
ating ICS adherence [186]. FeNO is simple to perform, 
usable in infants and preschool children, and results are 
immediately available; however, its relative sensitivity 
and specificity for eosinophilic inflammation are uncer-
tain and accurate FeNO measurement is confounded by 
atopic status, smoking, and ICS use. It is available in most 
asthma clinics and some specialist clinics.
Biomarker‑guided management options
Available biologics
The advent of biologic agents has revolutionized the 
management of patients with severe refractory asthma. 
These agents target different components of the inflam-
matory cascade, and are indicated for specific patient 
phenotypes (Table 5). Their current or anticipated avail-
ability suggests a provisional role for the use of biomark-
ers in the selection of biologics for severe asthma therapy.
Omalizumab (anti‑IgE)
Omalizumab was approved in 2005 by Health Canada, 
and is indicated for the management of adult and pedi-
atric (aged ≥ 6 years) patients with moderate to severe 
persistent asthma that is uncontrolled by ICS, and who 
exhibit allergic reactivity to a clinically relevant aer-
oallergen [187]. Initial trials demonstrating the safety 
and effectiveness of omalizumab in the management 
of moderate to severe allergic asthma [18–23] are sup-
ported by long-term (≥ 52 weeks) and real-world studies 
[188–191] and more than 400,000 patient-years of expe-
rience [192]. It is recommended as Step 5 add-on treat-
ment in the 2016 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 
guidelines for patients with moderate to severe allergic 
asthma [16]. Omalizumab binds IgE with high affinity 
and competitively inhibits its interaction with FcεRI, 
leading to the reduced expression of FcεRI on mast cells, 
basophils, and dendritic cells [60, 187]. The presence of 
omalizumab:IgE complexes increases serum total IgE 
levels after the agent has been initiated and these levels 
may remain elevated for up to 1 year after omalizumab 
has been discontinued. Thus, caution is indicated against 
basing reassessment of the dosing regimen on serum 
total IgE levels taken during this time period [187]. 
Although IgE is the principal biomarker when consid-
ering the administration of omalizumab in treatment-
refractory asthma patients, other biomarkers may be 
valuable in guiding omalizumab use. Investigators of the 
EXTRA study noted that reductions in exacerbations 
associated with omalizumab use versus placebo were 
substantially greater in high- versus low-biomarker sub-
groups for all biomarkers studied: eosinophils, periostin, 
and FeNO [176]. Serum IgE and periostin levels were 
determined to be useful markers of response to omali-
zumab [193].
Mepolizumab (IL‑5 inhibitor)
Mepolizumab was approved by Health Canada in 2015 
for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult patients 
aged ≥ 18 years with severe eosinophilic asthma that is 
uncontrolled with ICS and an additional asthma agent 
[194]. Eosinophilic asthma was defined in mepolizumab 
trials as a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells/μL at 
initiation of mepolizumab or ≥ 300 cells/μL in the pre-
vious 12 months. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 with high 
affinity, disrupting the production and survival of eosin-
ophils. The agent was proven safe and effective in three 
randomized, double-blind clinical trials [24–26], and 
benefit beyond 48 months was also determined [195, 
196]. The 2016 GINA guidelines added mepolizumab to 
its recommended Step 5 treatment options for patients 
aged ≥ 12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma [16]. 
Blood eosinophil count was found to be a more reliable 
marker of mepolizumab activity than sputum eosinophil 
measurement [26, 151]. Early studies that failed to dem-
onstrate clinical improvement (airway hyperreactivity, 
peak expiratory flow, and  
FEV1) despite marked reduc-
tions in blood and sputum eosinophil count underline 
the importance of biomarker use for identification of 
appropriate candidates.

Reslizumab (IL‑5 inhibitor)
Reslizumab was approved by Health Canada in 2016. 
Like mepolizumab, reslizumab is indicated for add-on 
maintenance treatment of patients aged ≥ 18 years with 
severe eosinophilic asthma—defined in reslizumab tri-
als as a blood eosinophil count ≥ 400 cells/µL—and 
who are inadequately controlled with ICS and an addi-
tional asthma medication [197]. Reslizumab received its 
approval based on two randomized, double-blind trials 
[29]. Although blood eosinophil count is the approved 
measure for determination of eligibility to take resli-
zumab, this agent has also shown the ability to reduce 
sputum eosinophil levels [28].
Investigational biologics
Several biologics are currently being tested in Phase 
III trials to confirm their safety and efficacy in asthma 
patients.
Benralizumab binds to the α subunit of the IL-5 recep-
tor and reduces the number of IL-5Rα-producing cells 
through its antibody-directed, cell-mediated cytotoxic 
effect on eosinophils and basophils [198]. In two Phase 
III trials, benralizumab significantly reduced asthma 
exacerbations and improved pre-bronchodilator  
FEV1 
[199, 200]. Patient stratification in these two trials was 
by baseline blood eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL ver-
sus < 300 cells/μL).
Dupilumab acts on the α subunit of the IL-4 receptor 
and blocks signal transduction of both IL-4 and IL-13 
[201]. It produced a greater reduction of exacerbations 
in patients with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma 
and eosinophilia compared with placebo [202]. Eligi-
ble patients had elevated eosinophil counts according 
to blood or sputum screening; in this study by Wenzel 
et al., the specific cut-off levels were ≥ 300 cells/μL for 
blood and ≥ 3% for sputum eosinophil. In a Phase IIb 
trial, dupilumab was associated with improvements in 
lung function and severe exacerbations in patients with 
uncontrolled persistent asthma regardless of baseline 
eosinophil count [203].
IL-13 inhibition is the target of two other experimen-
tal agents, lebrikizumab and tralokinumab [204, 205]. In 
parallel Phase III trials, lebrikizumab appeared to reduce 
IL-13, but asthma exacerbations were not significantly 
reduced [206]. Further lebrikizumab trials have been 
suspended. Tralokinumab failed to meet its primary 
endpoint of a significant reduction in the rate of asthma 
exacerbations over 52 weeks in the Phase III STRATOS 
1 trial [207]. The ongoing STRATOS 2 trial is analyzing 
this same primary outcome in a subset of patients iden-
tified with periostin and DPP-4 measurement as having 
high IL-13 activity.
Conclusion
It has been established that asthma is a heterogeneous 
condition, comprising a phenotypic spectrum of patient 
populations. Under this broad term, severe asthma itself 
covers a series of subgroups with specific characteristics, 
symptom profiles, and biochemical mechanisms of dis-
ease. Biologic agents represent a significant opportunity

to administer individualized treatment for patients who 
do not respond to traditional asthma therapy. In this 
review, we have shown the importance of biomarkers to 
identify which patient phenotypes can be expected to 
derive the greatest benefit from these agents, and, for 
some, as indicators of treatment response. All patients 
with asthma in whom initiation of biologic therapy is 
being considered should undergo aeroallergen skin prick 
testing and IgE measurement to assess for the allergic 
asthma phenotype, and a CBC with differential to assess 
for elevated eosinophil levels. These biomarkers are both 
readily accessible and useful to provide accurate clinical 
information about the underlying asthma phenotype. The 
optimization of biomarker testing methods by combining 
greatest sensitivity and specificity with non-invasiveness, 
availability, and affordability is critical to the continued 
advancement of asthma control.
