Abstract 
Background: Shrimp and house dust mite (HDM) allergies are common in Canadians. Often, both of these allergies 
occur in the same patient. This may be due to homology of tropomyosin or other potentially shared proteins. The aim 
of our study was to assess the frequency of house dust mite sensitization in a shrimp allergic Canadian population.
Methods: We undertook a retrospective chart review of shrimp allergic patients at an outpatient allergy clinic in 
Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Our primary endpoint was to assess for presence of HDM sensitization in this population. 
Patients were categorized into approximate quartiles. We assessed the severity of the shrimp reactions, correlated 
shrimp skin test size to HDM skin test size, and measured the proportion of patients with atopic symptoms.
Results: We identified 95 shrimp allergic patients who were tested for house dust mite. 86 (90.5%) of these patients 
had a positive skin test to HDM. Patients with a shrimp skin test ≥5 mm were 5.31 times (95% CI, 1.55–18.14; p = 
0.008) more likely to exhibit a dust mite skin test ≥5 mm than patients with a shrimp skin test <5 mm. The odds 
of a patient with a shrimp skin test between 10 and 18 mm having a larger HDM skin test were 3.93 times (95% CI 
1.03–14.98, p = 0.045) the odds for a patient with a shrimp skin test size between 3 and 4 mm. We did not find a cor-
relation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom grade (p = 0.301).
Conclusion: In our Canadian patients, we found a large majority of shrimp allergic patients to be sensitized to HDM. 
We found that patients with a large skin test to shrimp were more likely to have a large skin test to HDM compared to 
those patients with a small skin test to shrimp. We did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp 
reaction symptom severity. Most of these patients had symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma that may have been 
caused by house dust mite allergy.

Background
Shrimp and house dust mite (HDM) allergies are encoun-
tered frequently in Canadian allergy clinics. The preva-
lence of shellfish allergy in Canada has been found to be 
1.6% [1]. There are times when both of these allergies are 
seen in the same patients, which has been an area of study.
Tropomyosin, a muscle protein, is thought to be 
responsible for the relationship between HDM and 
shrimp [2, 3]. It is a protein present in both that shares 
homology between HDM and shrimp [4]. Tropomyosin 
in shrimp, referred to as Pen a 1, is the major allergen in 
shrimp [5, 6] and has been shown to be detected in 41% 
of patients with shrimp allergy in an Italian population 
[7]. Der p 10, the tropomyosin found in HDM is present 
in a minority of patients with HDM allergy [8, 9]. In a 
study on European patients 9–18% showed IgE reactiv-
ity to Der p 10 [10], with some studies showing as low 
as 4.3% [11] and others up to 25% in adults and 30% in 
children [12]. Some have postulated these higher levels 
being in patients with HDM sensitization who live in cos-
tal location with more seafood intake [12].

The tropomyosin present in HDM and shrimp has 
shown cross reactivity [4, 13]. While both shrimp and 
HDM have tropomyosin, there is variable evidence on 
showing presence of an allergy to both in patients. There 
is also evidence which questions tropomyosin as the 
allergen responsible for cross-reactivity with shellfish, 
and that other proteins may be a factor [14]. Tropomyo-
sin also has been shown to be responsible for cross reac-
tivity between different crustacea, such as shrimp, crab 
and lobster, due to homology between the protein in 
these species [3, 5].
We undertook a retrospective chart review to assess 
for the presence of HDM sensitization (positive skin test) 
in shrimp allergic Canadians. The severity of the shrimp 
reactions was estimated based on patients’ history. We 
correlated shrimp skin test size to the clinical reaction 
severity to shrimp. Other objectives included assessing if 
those shrimp allergic patients who are sensitized to HDM 
have symptomatic HDM allergy, and for a possible corre-
lation of shrimp skin test size with the presence of HDM 
allergic symptoms.
Methods
Ethics
Ethics was obtained through the Hamilton Integrated 
Research Ethics Board.
Patient selection
The charts of patients, with clinical shellfish allergy with 
positive skin tests to shrimp, who presented to an out-
patient allergy clinic in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada were 
reviewed. The clinical history of the reaction(s), skin 
prick testing and specific IgE to shrimp and other shell-
fish was extracted from the available clinical data. Skin 
test results to aeroallergens including house dust mite 
was also recorded.
Skin prick testing
All patients with the question of shrimp allergy underwent 
skin prick testing testing to crustaceans. Most patients 
presenting with food allergy to the clinic had testing to the 
inhalant allergens, including HDM. Reagents for skin prick 
testing to shrimp were from Omega Laboratories Ltd. Skin 
prick testing for HDM was done with D. farinae and D. 
pteronyssinus at a concentration of 30,000 AU/mL (Hollis-
ter-Stier). The largest skin test wheal of D. farinae or D. pter-
onyssinus was recorded. The HDM skin test was recorded as 
negative if both species of HDM tests were negative. A posi-
tive result was considered ≥3 mm wheal compared to the 
negative control test. The results of skin testing were placed 
into groupings based on wheal diameter.
Specific IgE
For some of our patients, serum specific IgE testing was 
done in community labs by ImmunoCap®.
Diagnosing shrimp allergy
Shrimp allergy was diagnosed based on clinical history 
of an IgE-mediated reaction with positive skin prick test-
ing and/or serum specific IgE levels. The severity of the 
reaction was categorized based on previously published 
guides for grading food induced anaphylaxis [15].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS soft-
ware (Version 23; IBM, Chicago, Ill). The χ2 test for 
Independence or Fisher’s exact test for Independence, 
where appropriate, was used to analyze the association 
between 2 categorical variables. Independent-sample 
Student t test was used to compare the mean score of 
continuous data between categorical groups, namely 
patients allergic to shrimp with sensitization to dust 
mite versus patients allergic to shrimp without sen-
sitization to dust mite. Binary logistic regression was 
used to estimate the influence of shrimp allergy on dust 
mite allergy. The dependent variable was skin test to 
dust mite (≥5 mm = 1 and <5 mm = 0) and explana-
tory variable was skin test to shrimp (≥5 mm = 1 
and <5 mm = 0). To better ascertain the relationship 
between dust mite and shrimp sensitization, an ordinal 
logistic regression was used to estimate the influence 
of shrimp sensitization severity on dust mite sensitiza-
tion severity. Both shrimp and dust mite skin test val-
ues were apportioned into quartiles: Shrimp, 25th, 50th, 
and 75th at 5, 7, and 10 mm, respectively; Dust mite, 
25th, 50th, and 75th at 3, 5, and 7 mm, respectively. 
Quartered shrimp skin test values were used as the 
explanatory variable and quartered dust mite skin test 
values were used as the dependent variable. Odds ratios 
(ORs) were reported with corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs). All tests were 2-sided and p 
values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographics and diagnosis of shrimp allergy
We identified 95 patients with shrimp allergy that were 
also tested to HDM. The demographic data of these 
patients along with presence of other crustacean and 
inhalant allergies and symptoms of atopy can be found in 
Table 1. There was no significant difference between the 
size of skin test to shrimp and average of grade of symp-
toms to shrimp ingestion between those with and with-
out dust mite sensitization (Table 1).

HDM sensitization in Shrimp allergic patients
Of the 95 patients with shrimp allergy, 90.5% had posi-
tive skin testing to HDM. The correlation between HDM 
skin test size and shrimp skin test size was not signifi-
cant (r = −0.109, p = 0.293; pearson correlation). The 
relationship between HDM skin test (<3 or ≥3 mm) and 
shrimp skin test (≥5 mm and <5 mm) was not significant 
(p = 1.000). We found the odds ratio of having a HDM 
test greater than 3 mm, with shrimp skin test size ≥5 mm 
versus <5 mm, was 0.771 (95% CI 0.088–6.73, p = 0.814). 
Figure 1 shows the number of patients with a skin test 
size to shrimp ≥5 mm who have positive (≥3 mm) skin 
test to dust mite. While there is a majority of patients 
in this category, too few patients in our population had 
<3 mm dust mite skin tests for a meaningful analysis. 
Therefore, the data was further categorized into those 
patients with a HDM skin test size ≥5 mm and those 
<5 mm to determine if there was an association between 
shrimp skin test size (≥5 mm and <5 mm). The relation-
ship between HDM skin test (≥5 mm or <5 mm) and 
shrimp skin test (≥5 mm or <5 mm) was significant, χ2 
(1) = 8.12, p = 0.004. Patients with a shrimp skin test of 
≥5 mm were more likely than patients with a shrimp skin 
test of <5 mm to have a HDM skin test of ≥5 mm. We 
found that patients with a shrimp skin test ≥5 mm were 
5.31 times more likely to exhibit a HDM skin test ≥5 mm 
(95% CI 1.55–18.14, p = 0.008) than patients with a 
shrimp skin test <5 mm. Figure 2 shows the majority of 
positive HDM skin tests in patients with shrimp skin 
tests >5 mm. Interestingly, there are patients negative to 
HDM in all quartiles and there does not appear to be a 
greater number of patients with larger skin test to HDM 
in the larger shrimp skin test group.

were 5.49 times (95% CI 1.43–21.02, p = 0.013) the odds 
for a patient with a shrimp skin test size between 3 and 
4 mm. The odds of a patient with a shrimp skin test size 
between 7 and 9 mm of having a larger HDM skin test 
were 2.68 times compared to a patient with a shrimp skin 
test size between 3 and 4 mm; however, this did not reach 
statistical significance (95% CI 0.74–9.73, p = 0.134). The 
odds of a patient with a shrimp skin test between 10 and 
18 mm having a larger HDM skin test were 3.93 times 
(95% CI 1.03–14.98, p = 0.045) the odds for a patient 
with a shrimp skin test size of 3–4 mm.
Skin test size to shrimp compared to the symptom severity 
of shrimp reactions
This data also allowed us to assess the correlation between 
size of shrimp skin test and severity of shrimp reaction. 
Table 2 shows the symptom grade [15] to shrimp ingestion 
by skin test size. There are 5 extra patients included in this 
table and analysis. These patients did not have HDM test-
ing done so were not included in our primary analysis, but 
did have symptoms with shrimp and skin test to shrimp 
along with recording of atopy symptoms. The correlation 
between shrimp skin test size and shrimp symptom grade 
was not significant (r = −0.102, p = 0.301; Pearson cor-
relation). The odds ratio of having a higher shrimp symp-
tom grade, with a shrimp skin test size between 5 and 
6 mm versus 3 and 4 mm, was 1.79 (95% CI 0.54–5.93, 
p = 0.337) and not significant. The odds ratio of having a 
high shrimp symptom grade, with a shrimp skin test size 
between 7 and 9 mm versus 3–4 mm, was 1.09 (95% CI 
0.34–3.51, p = 0.337) and not significant.
The odds ratio of having a higher shrimp symptom 
grade, with a shrimp skin test size between 10 and 18 mm 
versus 3–4 mm, was 0.997 (95% CI 0.31–3.26, p = 0.996) 
and not significant.
Presence of atopic symptoms in shrimp allergic patients
Many of our patients with shrimp allergy had atopic symp-
toms. In Table 1 it can be seen that there are symptoms 
of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in both 
HDM and non-HDM sensitized shrimp allergic patients. 
There was no significant difference between the presence 
of these symptoms in those HDM versus non-HDM sen-
sitized. When breaking down all shrimp allergic patients 
into approximate quartiles (Table 2), there is no obvious 
relationship between size of allergy skin test to shrimp and 
the presence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and dermatitis.
Discussion
Shrimp allergy is seen in more than 1% of the Canadian 
population [1]. Our results demonstrate that almost all 
of our patients with shrimp allergy were also sensitized 
to house dust mite. This is similar to small studies on an

Asian population which have found a majority of patients 
with shrimp allergy have positive skin tests to HDM. 
One demonstrated that patients who identify as shrimp 
allergic, both those that react on oral food challenge and 
those who can tolerate shrimp, are almost all positive on 
skin testing to HDM [16]. Another showed that 72% of 
shellfish sensitized individuals have skin test positivity to 
HDM [17].
Alternatively when looking at shrimp sensitization in 
those with HDM positivity, the minority show positivity 
to shrimp [16]. This may be explained by the role of tro-
pomyosin in the shrimp and HDM allergies. Tropomyosin 
is the major allergen in shrimp [5, 6] and therefore, sensi-
tization to the protein would be likely found in a majority 
of shrimp allergic individuals. These patients would have 
a greater potential to cross react with Der p 10 of HDM. 
This would explain why we, along with other groups, have 
found a high frequency of HDM sensitization in shrimp 
allergic patients. When looking at patients with HDM 
allergy for shrimp sensitization, Der p 10 is not the major 
allergen in HDM allergy. Therefore, it may be expected 
that the number of patients who are HDM allergic with 
shrimp sensitization would be lower, as a minority of 
patients with HDM allergy are sensitized to the tropomy-
osin. A previous study found that HDM allergic patients 
were more likely to be Der p 10 negative with a HDM 
allergy alone compared to combined HDM and shrimp 
allergy, which did have higher levels of Der p 10 IgE [12].
We found there to be an increased odds of having a 
sizeable HDM skin test wheal size (≥5 mm) if patients 
also had a shrimp skin test wheal size (≥5 mm) compared 
to patients with a smaller shrimp skin test wheal size 
(<5 mm). Interestingly, a previous study showed there 
was a non-significant smaller wheal size to D. pteronys-
sinus in patients with seafood allergy than those with-
out seafood allergy [18]. While we did not compare the 
wheal size for HDM in shrimp allergic patients to those 
not shrimp allergic, a larger HDM skin test (≥5 mm) 
was more likely if the patient had a large shrimp skin test 
(≥5 mm).
Based on the protein homology theory, HDM allergic 
individuals would be expected to be sensitized to the 
tropomyosin component of HDM for cross reactivity to 
occur. We did not have the ability to look into the specific 
components (Der p 10 and Pen a 1) of our patients’ HDM 
and shrimp allergy to find sensitization to tropomyosin. 
Interestingly, there are studies of patients who do not 
have elevated levels of specific IgE to tropomyosin that 
are positive to dust mite who develop symptoms after 
consuming shellfish [18]. This demonstrates that there 
may be alternative allergenic proteins involved with the 
cross-reactivity between these two allergens, and some 
alternative allergens have been identified [14].
An alternative explanation for the high frequency of 
HDM sensitization in our patients may be high HDM 
exposure and coincidental HDM sensitization. Increased 
HDM exposure may result in increased sensitization to 
HDM [19]. There is variable evidence for different factors 
such as humidity or damp house environment as a cause 
of increased household HDM. A Canadian study assessed 
this idea, and while there was higher amounts of HDM 
in Vancouver (which is more humid) compared to Win-
nipeg, the relative indoor humidity level was not a sig-
nificant factor for the higher levels of HDM in Vancouver 
[20]. Our patients, from Southern Ontario, also live in an 
area of increased humidity. But based on the aforemen-
tioned evidence, increased outdoor humidity may not 
lead to increased HDM sensitization. To further charac-
terize this, we would need to compare a control group 
(perhaps patients with food allergies other than shellfish) 
to compare the levels of HDM sensitization in our area.
Our data also allowed us to look for a correlation 
between size of skin test and severity of reaction to 
shrimp. There was not a significant relationship, which 
was confirmed when looking at the shrimp skin test 
quartiles by ordinal logistic regression. These results are 
similar to previous studies which found no association 
between skin test size and clinical reaction severity in 
food allergy (shrimp was not included in this study) [21].
One limitation of our study was that it was completed 
in only one clinic in Southern Ontario with a limited 
sample size. The findings may differ in a multicenter 
study. The location of this study may be a factor as high 
humidity in Southern Ontario was likely a factor in the 
high proportion of HDM sensitization. Also, we did not 
perform oral challenges to shrimp in our patients to con-
firm shrimp allergy. It is likely that some patients would 
have passed an oral challenge so they would have been 
excluded from the analysis. And as noted previously, we 
did not perform serum shrimp specific IgE or HDM spe-
cific IgE levels on all of our patients. Further objective 
data would have been interesting to analyze.
Future research should address a number of questions 
that this study has generated. We would like to see if our 
patients would have a resolution of shrimp allergy if they 
were treated with HDM immunotherapy. There have 
been previous cases showing that food allergy symptoms 
to shrimp have resolved after HDM immunotherapy. 
There is conflicting evidence for development of shrimp 
allergy with dust mite immunotherapy. One study, where 
subcutaneous immunotherapy was given to HDM allergic 
patients who were not sensitized to shrimp, showed that 
patients did not develop positive skin test or symptoms 
with shellfish consumption [22]. Another study, assessing 
specific IgE to Pen a 1 before and after sublingual immu-
notherapy to HDM, did not find any patients who formed

antibodies to shrimp tropomyosin [23]. Alternatively, 
there is a study that showed an increase in shrimp IgE in 
some patients after receiving dust mite immunotherapy 
[24]. Other studies could assess whether different areas 
of the country have different levels of HDM sensitization 
in shrimp allergic patients. One may postulate that the 
coastal areas or more humid areas would have a higher 
proportion of these patients and dry areas fewer. Also, 
as previously mentioned, it would be fascinating to look 
at the HDM sensitization in all food allergic patients and 
compare this to shrimp allergic patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found a large majority of southern 
Ontario shrimp allergic patients to be sensitized to 
HDM. There was a correlation with having a larger 
skin test to house dust mite in patients with a larger 
skin test to shrimp. We were not able to find any rela-
tionship between skin test size to shrimp and the 
severity of shrimp reaction, which emphasizes the 
poor ability of skin test to predict reaction severity 
with food allergy.
