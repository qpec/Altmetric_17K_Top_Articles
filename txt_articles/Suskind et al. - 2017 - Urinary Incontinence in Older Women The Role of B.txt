 Participants—Women initially aged 70 to 79 years recruited from Pittsburgh, PA and Memphis, 
TN.
Measurements—Urinary incontinence was assessed by structured questionnaires. Body mass 
index (BMI), grip strength, quadriceps torque and walking speed were assessed by physical 
examination and performance testing. Appendicular lean body mass (ALM) and whole-body fat 
mass were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.
Results—Of 1475 women, 212 (14%) and 233 (16%) reported at least monthly predominantly 
SUI and UUI at baseline, respectively. At 3 years, there were 1137 women, 164 (14%) with new/
persistent SUI and 320 (28%) with new/persistent UUI. Women had increased odds of new/
persistent SUI if they demonstrated ≥5% decrease in grip strength, (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.60, 
p=0.047). Alternatively, women had decreased odds of new/persistent SUI if they demonstrated 
≥5% decrease in BMI (AOR 0.46; p=0.014), ≥5% increase in ALM corrected for BMI (AOR 0.17; 
p=0.004), or ≥5% decrease in fat mass (AOR 0.53; p=0.010). Only a ≥5% increase in walking 
speed was associated with new/persistent UUI over 3 years (AOR 1.54; p=0.040).
Conclusion—Among women 70 years and older, changes in body composition and grip strength 
were associated with changes in SUI frequency over time. In contrast, changes in these factors did 
not influence UUI. Findings suggest that optimization of body composition and muscle strength is 
more likely to modify SUI than UUI risk among older women.
Introduction
Elevated body mass index (BMI) is a strong and independent risk factor for urinary 
incontinence in young and middle-aged adults.1–3 Within this age group, there is a clear 
dose effect of weight on incontinence, with each 5-unit increase in BMI associated with a 
20% to 70% increase in incontinence risk.4 Among overweight and obese women, weight 
loss has also been shown to decrease incontinence frequency,5,6 leading to widespread 
recommendations for weight loss as a first-line treatment for this condition.7
With aging, however, the relationship between BMI and incontinence may become more 
complex, with changes in body composition and adipose tissue distribution playing an 
increasing role in determining incontinence risk. Among older adults, lower BMI can be 
paradoxically associated with an increased risk of other adverse outcomes such as disability 
and death,8–10 if the decreased weight mainly represents decreased lean muscle mass rather 
than or in addition to decreased fat mass.11 Decreased weight may in turn be associated with 
an increased risk of incontinence if it is associated with decline in upper and lower body 
strength that contributes to frailty in older adults and interferes with normal toileting 
habits.12 Low muscle mass and strength in the extremities may also be associated with lower 
pelvic floor muscle strength and function that may increase older patients’ susceptibility to 
leakage of urine.
Further, even if overweight or obese women are more likely to experience urinary 
incontinence in older age, it does not necessarily follow that weight loss will be effective in 
improving incontinence in this age group. Among older women, urinary incontinence may 
reflect the cumulative effects of increased weight on the urinary tract over their lifetime. 
These effects may not be reversible with weight loss in the 8th or 9th decades of life.

 Currently, there is little evidence to indicate that clinical recommendations for weight loss as 
a treatment for urinary incontinence in younger women are also applicable to older women, 
especially given the complex association between weight and other adverse outcomes such 
as mortality in older adults.
To advance understanding of the direction, strength and persistence of relationships between 
body composition, muscle strength, walking speed and urinary incontinence, we analyzed 
data from a large, community-dwelling cohort of older women. Our goal was to guide 
clinicians in counseling older women effectively about how changing their weight, body 
composition and muscle strength may affect their risk of developing incontinence or 
contribute to progression of incontinence over time.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a prospective, multicenter, 
biracial cohort study of body composition and aging in older adults. Study participants were 
men and women between the ages 70 to 79 years who did not have difficulty with activities 
of daily living, walking a quarter-mile, or climbing 10 steps without resting at enrollment. 
Exclusionary criteria included recent treatment for cancer, participation in a clinical trial, or 
intention to relocate from the areas of the study within 3 years. Participants were recruited 
from a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries and through community recruitment of 
Black individuals in the areas around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee.13 
All procedures were in accordance with ethical standards of the institutional review boards 
of the participating institutions and all participants signed informed consent. From this 
population, we identified all women who contributed data on urinary incontinence and 
underwent assessment of body weight, composition, muscle strength and walking speed at 
baseline (1997–1998) and 3-year follow up (2000–2001). See Supplemental Figure 1 for 
details of this cohort. Of note, all measurements were collected during the same visit, both at 
baseline and again at follow up.
Measurements
Urinary incontinence—The presence, frequency and type of urinary incontinence were 
assessed at baseline (Y1) and after three years (Y4) using structured-item questionnaire 
measures adapted from previous large-scale epidemiologic studies of older women.4 
Participants were first asked, “In the past 12 months, how often have you leaked urine?” and 
possible responses included: (1) less than once per month, (2) one or more times per month, 
(3) one or more times per week, (4) every day and (5) don’t know. To distinguish clinical 
type of incontinence, participants were then asked, “In the past 12 months, when does your 
leakage of urine usually occur?” and possible responses included: (1) with an activity like 
coughing, lifting, standing up or exercise, (2) when you have the urge to urinate and can’t 
get to a toilet fast enough, (3) you leak unrelated to coughing, sneezing, lifting or urge and 
(4) don’t know. Participants could only choose one response to each question, so that 
classifications of incontinence frequency and type were mutually exclusive. For this 
analysis, women were classified as having at least monthly predominantly stress urinary

 incontinence (SUI) if they answered that they leaked at least once per moth and that this 
leakage usually occurred with an activity like coughing, lifting, standing up or exercise. 
They were classified as having predominantly urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) if they 
answered that they leaked at least once per month and that this leakage usually occurred 
when they had the urge to urinate and couldn’t get to the toilet fast enough at least once per 
month. Women who could not classify their symptoms or who reported incontinence that 
was not predominantly stress- or urgency-type were excluded from analyses.
Body mass and composition measures—Weight in kilograms (kg) and standing 
height to the nearest mm were measured in order to calculate body mass index (BMI) in 
kg/m2 at both Y1 and Y4. Height was measured with wall-mounted stadiometers and weight 
with balance beam or digital scales per centralized study protocols.13
Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was measured by whole-body dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scans (Hologic QDR4500A with software version 8.21 for analysis, 
Hologic, Waltham, MA). The amount of lean mass was calculated, excluding fat and bone 
tissue.14 ALM was calculated as the sum of lean mass in the arms and legs. Consistent with 
the Foundations of the National Institutes of Health (FINH) guidelines for assessment of 
age-associated muscle wasting, ALM/BMI was calculated to represent a measure of ALM 
corrected for BMI.15,16 Fat was measured both in kg, expressed as total fat, and as percent 
total fat using DXA scan technology described above.
Grip strength—Maximum grip strength, as an established marker of total body muscle 
strength,17 was measured in kg using handheld dynamometers (JAMAR Technologies, Inc., 
Hatfield, PA). Two trials were performed in each hand and an average of the trials performed 
on the strongest hand was used for the analyses.18 If a participant had limitations with one 
hand, such as osteoarthritis, they used their stronger hand to measure grip strength. A 
measure of grip strength corrected for BMI was calculated as maximum grip strength/BMI, 
consistent with consensus guidelines.16
Quadriceps torque—Quadriceps torque, or concentric knee extensor torque, was 
measured on the right leg at 60 degrees per second (Kin-Con Isokinetic Dynameter, TN). If a 
participant had a knee replacement or pain on the right side, the left side was used for 
testing. Patients were excluded from torque testing if they had a history of cerebral 
aneurysm, cerebral bleeding within the last 6 months, blood pressure >199/109, or bilateral 
knee pain or joint replacement.19 A measure of quadriceps torque corrected for BMI was 
calculated as quadriceps torque/BMI based on prior literature.20
Walking speed—Walking speed was measured in meters/second over a distance of 6 
meters, where each individual was asked to walk at their usual speed.
Other variables—Participants self-rated their health as poor, fair, good, very good, or 
excellent.21,22 Participants were considered to have diabetes mellitus if they reported prior 
clinician diagnosis of diabetes. Age and race were also collected from self-report via 
questionnaire.

 Statistical analyses
Baseline distributions of age, race, general health, diabetes, body composition and grip 
strength measures were examined separately in women with at least monthly SUI, at least 
monthly UUI, and less than monthly or no urinary incontinence. We then examined the 
baseline prevalence of monthly predominantly SUI and UUI across quintiles of body 
composition and grip strength parameters at baseline (Q1 lowest to Q5 highest). Quintiles 
were chosen over quartiles or tertiles in order to show as much granularity as possible, while 
at the same time having adequate sample size per group. Prevalence figures were expressed 
as both unadjusted and as adjusted for age, race, health status and diabetes. Tests of 
heterogeneity were performed to assess for differences across quintiles at baseline.
Among women who provided data on urinary incontinence and at least one body 
composition or grip strength parameter at baseline (Y1) and after three years (Y4), we 
examined the proportion with new or persistent incontinence over three years. Women were 
considered if to have new or persistent predominantly SUI or UUI if they reported: 1) less 
than monthly incontinence at baseline but at least monthly symptoms of predominantly SUI 
or UUI at follow-up, or 2) at least monthly SUI or UUI at baseline and either equally 
frequent or more frequent SUI or UUI at follow-up.
Logistic regression models were developed to examine associations between 3-year changes 
in body composition and grip strength and the outcomes of 1) new or persistent 
predominantly SUI and 2) new or persistent predominantly UUI. For these models, women 
with ≥5% decrease and ≥5% increase in each body composition or muscle strength 
parameter were each compared to women with less than 5% change in that parameter as the 
reference group. Adjusted models included age, race, health status and diabetes, as factors 
previously identified as influencing incontinence risk in older community-dwelling women. 
Tests for interactions with race were performed for all adjusted models, and race-stratified 
analyses were performed in cases where p <0.05 for interaction by race.
Results
Baseline characteristics of 1475 women with monthly SUI, UUI, and less than monthly or 
no urinary incontinence are presented in Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1. There were 212 
women (14.4% of total) with at least monthly predominantly SUI (37.3% leaked once per 
month, 33.0% leaked once or more per week, and 29.7% leaked every day) and 233 (15.8% 
of total) women with at least monthly predominantly UUI (40.8% leaked once per month, 
36.5% leaked once or more per week, and 22.7% leaked every day). A total of 1030 women 
reported less than monthly or no urinary incontinence. Most baseline characteristics were 
similarly distributed across the three groups with the exception of race, where the proportion 
of Black women was lower among those with baseline predominantly SUI (30.7%) 
compared to those with predominantly UUI (40.3%) and neither monthly predominantly 
SUI nor UUI (52.2%).

 Baseline
The baseline unadjusted and multivariable adjusted prevalence of monthly predominantly 
SUI and UUI among women across different quintiles of body composition, muscle grip 
strength and walking speed parameters are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The 
proportion of women reporting at least monthly SUI increased with increasing quintile of 
BMI, ALM, and total fat mass (p for trend of heterogeneity = 0.006, <0.001, and 0.025, 
respectively) (Table 2). In particular, the prevalence of predominantly SUI was at least twice 
as high for women in the highest quintile of adjusted BMI, ALM, total fat mass and 
quadriceps torque compared to women in the lowest quintile of these parameters. In 
contrast, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of predominantly SUI by 
quintile of ALM corrected for BMI, percent fat mass, maximum grip strength, maximum 
grip strength corrected for BMI, quadriceps torque or walking speed corrected for BMI at 
baseline (all p’s >0.05).
The adjusted prevalence of at least monthly predominantly UUI (Table 3) also differed 
across quintiles of BMI, total body fat mass and walking speed (p=0.003, p=0.044 and 0.003 
for heterogeneity, respectively). Specifically, the prevalence of predominantly UUI was at 
least twice as high for women in the highest quintile of adjusted BMI and total fat mass and 
the fastest quintile of walking speed compared to women in the inverse quintile of these 
parameters. No significant differences in the prevalence of predominantly UUI by adjusted 
quintile of ALM, ALM corrected for BMI, percent fat mass, maximum grip strength, 
maximum grip strength corrected for BMI, quadriceps torque and quadriceps torque 
corrected for BMI were detected (all p’s >0.05).
Three-year follow-up
Of the 1475 women who provided data at baseline, 1137 women (77%) provided follow-up 
data on urinary incontinence and at least one body composition or muscle strength parameter 
at Y4. Of these women, 164 (14%) reported new or persistent SUI, and 320 (28%) reported 
new or persistent UUI (Supplemental Figure 1). Women with and without follow-up data at 
visit 4 did not differ significantly with regard to either BMI (p=0.12) or urinary incontinence 
(p=20). A higher percentage of Black women (27.7%) were lost to follow up compared to 
White women (17.6%) (p<0.001), however, further analysis did not detect evidence of race 
interactions for most associations between body composition, muscle strength, and urinary 
incontinence. Therefore, participants with missing data at visit 4 were excluded from 
longitudinal analyses.
Women who demonstrated a ≥ 5% decrease in BMI (adjusted OR (AOR) 0.46, p=0.014) or 
fat mass (AOR 0.53, p=0.010), or a ≥5% increase in ALM adjusted for BMI (AOR 0.17, 
p=0.004), were less likely to report new or persistent predominantly SUI over 3 years. In 
contrast, maximum grip strength, both by itself (AOR 1.60, p=0.047) and adjusted for BMI 
(AOR 1.94, p=0.004), was associated with new or persistent predominantly SUI after 
adjusting for age, race, health status and diabetes (Table 4). Changes in body composition, 
grip strength and quadriceps torque, however, were not associated with changes in new or 
persistent predominantly UUI in multivariate-adjusted models (Table 5), while a ≥5%

 increase in walking speed was associated with an increased odds of new/persistent UUI in 
the adjusted model only (adjusted OR 1.54, p=0.040).
No significant interactions with race were detected for any multivariate models except for 
the association between grip strength and predominantly UUI over 3 years (p=0.020), where 
the age- and race-adjusted OR for Whites were 0.93 (p=0.753) for a ≥5% decrease and 0.74 
(p=0.229) for a ≥5% increase. Likewise, for Blacks, the age and race adjusted ORs were 
1.11 (p=0.729) for a ≥5% decrease and 1.88 (p=0.031) for a ≥5% increase (data not shown).
Discussion
In this cohort of community-dwelling older women, we found that women with higher BMI 
and greater adiposity were more likely to report predominantly SUI and UUI at baseline. 
Specifically, the adjusted prevalence of predominantly SUI and UUI was at least two-fold 
higher among women in the highest quintile of BMI or fat mass, compared to the lowest 
quintile. These findings suggest that higher BMI and greater adiposity are important markers 
of risk for both predominantly SUI and UUI in older women, just as they are for younger 
women.1,23
For predominantly SUI, we found that change in BMI or fat mass over 3 years was also 
associated with change in SUI over time. That is, women who lost at least 5% of their BMI 
or fat mass were significantly less likely to experience new or persistence of their SUI over 3 
years, compared to women with less than 5% change in BMI or fat mass. These findings 
suggest that among women aged 70 years or older, the effects of increased BMI and fat mass 
on SUI risk may still be at least partially reversible through weight loss, in agreement with 
weight loss recommendations for younger women with SUI.5–7
In contrast, no changes in body composition or muscle strength were significantly associated 
with changes in predominantly UUI prevalence or frequency over 3 years. These findings 
suggest that for UUI, the effects of BMI and/or adiposity on UUI risk may not be as 
modifiable after women reach a certain age. The only statistically significant association 
found over time for new or persistent predominantly UUI was for walking speed, where a 
≥5% increase in walking speed was associated with an increased odds of new or persistent 
UUI (p=0.040). While this finding was statistically significant, we would like to emphasize 
that it was not strongly statistically significant (p=0.040) and that the association did not 
meet significance for the unadjusted model. Furthermore, these findings should be 
considered with caution. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further 
define and characterize this relationship.
Our findings may reflect important underlying differences in the role of BMI and adiposity 
in the pathophysiology of SUI versus UUI. Prior studies suggest that the increased risk of 
SUI in overweight and obese women may be mediated directly by increased abdominal 
pressure, resulting in increased intravesical pressure and urethral sphincter mobility.23 As a 
result, reduction in weight and abdominal fat may translate directly into decreased bladder 
pressure and decreased SUI in women, regardless of age. In contrast, the increased 
prevalence of UUI among older women who are overweight or obese may result from the

 sustained effects of oxidative stress over time, resulting in bladder ischemia and detrusor 
muscle instability that may not be easily reversible.24,25 As a result, late-stage weight loss or 
improvement in adiposity may not be capable of reducing detrusor muscle dysfunction and 
UUI symptoms in older age.
We detected similar trends in the relationship of grip strength, which serves as a widely 
recognized indicator of overall muscle strength,17 to SUI and UUI risk over three years. 
Decline in grip strength over three years, with or without adjustment for BMI, was 
associated with an increased risk of new persistent predominantly SUI. In contrast, changes 
in grip strength over 3 years were not associated with changes in predominantly UUI over 
time. Taken together, these findings suggest that improvements in muscle strength as 
reflected by grip strength may protect older women against development or progression of 
predominantly SUI, but may not reduce the risk of new-onset or progressive predominantly 
UUI in this age group.
This study benefits from a large, community-based, biracial cohort of women, assessment of 
both stress and urgency-type urinary incontinence, evaluation of multiple body composition 
and muscle strength parameters, and longitudinal follow-up for almost 80% of participants. 
Despite these strengths, several limitations should be considered when interpreting these 
data. First, incontinence symptoms were assessed using simple structured-item questionnaire 
measures, rather than voiding diaries or detailed histories, and participants did not undergo 
physical examination or other clinical evaluation to confirm the clinical type of 
incontinence. Based on these questions, patients had to choose their predominant type of 
urinary incontinence and could not report “equally mixed” type of urinary incontinence. 
However, these measures have been used in other large-scale epidemiologic studies of older 
adults and found to be associated with other important aging-associated factors. The items 
used to distinguish clinical type have also been shown to have generally good agreement 
with a 7-voiding diary among women with frequent incontinence.4,26 Also due to the use of 
an existing database, we were unable to include information on changes in health status over 
time including development of new medical conditions and administration of new 
medication. However, we believe that our use of self-rated health serves as a good surrogate 
measure for this issue. Second, the Health ABC study sampled only White and Black older 
adults, and results may not be generalizable to other racial/ethnic groups that may have 
different predispositions to weight loss and/or urinary incontinence in older age. Third, 
follow-up data on both incontinence and body composition were not available past 3 years, 
and thus we could not assess effects of body composition on incontinence risk over a longer 
time frame. Additionally, participants in Health ABC were generally well-functioning at 
baseline, and few of them were underweight using standard BMI thresholds. Findings may 
not be generalizable to other populations older adults with higher rates of disability or low 
body weight.
In this population of older women, changes in body composition and grip strength were 
associated with changes in predominantly SUI, but not predominantly UUI, over 3 years. 
These findings suggest that among women aged 70 years or older, optimization of body 
composition may be protective against incidence, persistence or worsening of predominantly 
SUI, but not necessarily of predominantly UUI. This information is important in counseling
