IMPORTANCE There is concern about potentially causal effects of tobacco use on psychosis,
but epidemiological studies have been less robust in attempts to minimize effects of
confounding than studies of cannabis use have been.
OBJECTIVES To examine the association of patterns of cigarette and cannabis use with
preceding and subsequent psychotic experiences, and to compare effects of confounding
across these patterns.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children, which initially consisted of 14 062 children. Data were
collected periodically from September 6, 1990, with collection ongoing, and analyzed from
August 8, 2016, through June 14, 2017. Cigarette and cannabis use data were summarized
using longitudinal latent class analysis to identify longitudinal classes of substance use.
Associations between classes and psychotic experiences at age 18 years were assessed.
EXPOSURES Depending on the analysis model, exposures were longitudinal classes of
substance use or psychotic experiences at age 12 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Logistic regression was used to examine the associations
between substance use longitudinal classes and subsequent onset of psychotic experiences.
RESULTS Longitudinal classes were derived using 5300 participants (56.1% female) who had
at least 3 measures of cigarette and cannabis use from ages 14 to 19 years. Prior to adjusting
for a range of potential confounders, there was strong evidence that early-onset
cigarette-only use (4.3%), early-onset cannabis use (3.2%), and late-onset cannabis use
(11.9%) (but not later-onset cigarette-only use [14.8%]) latent classes were associated with
increased psychotic experiences compared with nonusers (65.9%) (omnibus P < .001). After
adjusting for confounders, the association for early-onset cigarette-only use attenuated
substantially (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% CI, 1.13-8.14; adjusted OR, 1.78; 95% CI,
0.54-5.88), whereas those for early-onset cannabis use (adjusted OR, 3.70; 95% CI,
1.66-8.25) and late-onset cannabis use (adjusted OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.63-5.40) remained
consistent.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, our findings indicate that while individuals who
use cannabis or cigarettes during adolescence have an increased risk of subsequent psychotic
experiences, epidemiological evidence is substantively more robust for cannabis use than it is
for tobacco use.

annabis and tobacco are frequently used together, iden-
tifying their individual associations on mental health
is difficult but important, as this can advance under-
standing of causal mechanisms and help target preventive
interventions.
Individuals who use cannabis regularly have a 2- to 3-fold
increased risk of a psychotic outcome.1 Tobacco use is also as-
sociated with an increased incidence of psychotic disorders2-5
in cohort studies, and (less consistently) with subclinical psy-
choticsymptoms,6-8withhypothesizedcasualmechanismsin-
cluding nicotine increasing dopamine release and inducing D2-
receptor supersensitivity.5,9
However,whilearecentsystematicreviewreportedameta-
analysisestimatefordailysmokingandpsychosisthatwassimi-
lar to that for regular cannabis use, the estimate was based on
results unadjusted for confounders,5 unlike that for cannabis.1
While concern about confounding leading to overestimation of
association on psychosis also exists for cannabis,1 support for
causal effects of cannabis also comes from experimental stud-
ies showing an increase in psychotic experiences following ex-
posuretointravenousΔ9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC).10Incon-
trast, experimental studies of nicotine administration do not
support the acute onset of psychotic experiences.11
The strongest evidence of a causal effect of tobacco on
psychosis is that a genetic locus associated with heaviness
of smoking (within the nicotinic receptor CHRNA5-A3-B4
gene cluster) is 1 of the loci most strongly associated with
schizophrenia.12 However, this is also theoretically consistent
with either confounding by shared genetic effects (biological
pleiotropy) or, perhaps less plausibly, reverse causality (ie, bio-
logical risk of schizophrenia causing smoking behavior).
Associations between genetic risk for psychosis and both
cannabis use and heaviness of cigarette use are also consis-
tent with causal effects, reverse-causal effects, and pleiot-
ropy explanations.13-15
As most people who use cannabis also smoke cigarettes,
teasing out potentially causal effects of cannabis from those
of tobacco is difficult, particularly as individuals usually mix
their cannabis with tobacco, even when classing themselves
as nonsmokers.16 Measurement error can lead to incorrect es-
timates of causal effects (see Gage et al16 and Munafò et al17
forexamplesoftheimpactofmeasurementerroronconfound-
ing and main effects) and is particularly likely when using
single–time point assessments of exposure status. Thus, other
methods for teasing out causal effects of cannabis as distinct
from tobacco are required.
One approach that can help inform causal inference is to
use behavioral patterns of cannabis and cigarette use over time
to identify classes of individuals with different substance use
profiles across a developmental period rather than relying on
patternsofcannabisandcigaretteuseatasinglepointintime.18
Such methods capture additional information that may en-
able continual users of cannabis and cigarettes to be distin-
guished from those who may have experimented briefly.
In this study, we used longitudinal latent class analysis
(LLCA) to identify subgroups of individuals based on similar
patterns of cigarette and cannabis use behavior over time to
examine the association of different classes with subsequent
onsetofpsychoticexperiences,comparepatternsofconfound-
ing across these classes, and examine the association of child-
hood psychotic experiences with adolescent patterns of ciga-
rette and cannabis use.
Methods
Participants
The sample comprised individuals within the Avon Longitu-
dinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort. The initial
cohort consisted of 14 062 children born to women residing in
the former Avon Health Authority area with expected deliv-
ery dates from April 1, 1991, to December 31, 1992.19-21 All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent, and ethical ap-
proval was obtained from the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children Ethics and Law Committee and the
local research ethics committees.

Psychotic Experiences
The semi-structured psychosis-like symptom interview
(PLIKSi)22,23 was used to assess psychotic experiences at ages
12 and 18 years. The PLIKSi allows rating of 12 psychotic ex-
periences including hallucinations, delusions, and thought
interference.

Key Points
Question Are patterns of adolescent cigarette and cannabis use
differentially associated with subsequent onset of psychotic
experiences?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort study of 3328 adolescents,
there is evidence that both cannabis and cigarette use are
associated with subsequent psychotic experiences prior to
adjusting for confounders. However, after adjusting, the
associations for cigarette-only use attenuated substantially,
whereas those for cannabis use remained consistent.
Meaning While individuals who use either cannabis or cigarettes
during adolescence appear to be at increased risk of psychotic
experiences, the association of psychotic experiences is greater
with cannabis than with tobacco smoking.

Association Analyses
Psychotic Experiences as Exposure | Multinomial regression was
used to assess whether psychotic experiences at age 12 years
were associated with subsequent latent class membership, be-
fore and after adjustment for potential confounders, using a
manual implementation of the bias-adjusted 3-step method
(eAppendix in the Supplement).27 Analyses were also con-
ducted on a restricted sample omitting 455 participants who
used cannabis or cigarettes at age 12 years.
Psychotic Experiences as Outcome | Logistic regression was used
toassesswhetherlatentclassmembershipwasassociatedwith
subsequent psychotic experiences at age 18 years, before and
after adjustment for potential confounders. For these analy-
ses, derivation of classes was restricted to data from the first
to fourth time point (approximate ages 14-17 years). Other-
wise, the method used to derive classes was as previously de-
scribed. Restricting data to 4 time points had minimal impact
on latent class structure and proportions (eFigure and eTable
2 in the Supplement). Analyses were also conducted on a re-
stricted sample omitting 149 participants with definite psy-
chotic experiences at age 12 years.
Adjusting for family history of schizophrenia or depres-
sion, family history of drug use, paternal smoking during preg-
nancy, social class, IQ, experiencing bullying, childhood
trauma, and alcohol use had almost no association with re-
sults for either model previously described (eTable 3 in the
Supplement) but reduced the analysis sample size substan-
tially. We therefore only adjusted for sex, maternal educa-
tion, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and child Strengths

Missing Data
Percentage of missing data increased with time (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Participants in the analysis sample were more
likely to be female and to come from more advantaged back-
grounds (Table 1 and eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Results
Datawereavailablefor5300participants(56.1%female).Based
on model fit statistics (eTable 6 in the Supplement), there was
good agreement that a 5-class solution adequately described
the heterogeneity within the data.
The 5-class model comprised individuals with a higher
probability of early-onset cigarette-only use (4.3%), early-
onset cannabis use (3.2%), late-onset cigarette-only use
(14.8%), late-onset cannabis use (11.9%), and individuals with
a very low probability of cigarette or cannabis use (65.9%; re-
ferred to as nonusers) (Figure).
Patterns of Cigarette and/or Cannabis Use at Ages
14 to 17 Years and Psychotic Experiences at Age 18 Years
Individuals within the early-onset cigarette-only class, but not
the late-onset cigarette-only class, had greater odds of psy-
chotic experiences at age 18 years when compared with non-
users (odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% CI, 1.13-8.14; and OR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.31-2.31, respectively) (Table 2).
There was strong evidence that participants within the
early-onset and late-onset cannabis use classes also had in-
creased odds of psychotic experiences (early-onset cannabis

Sensitivity Analyses
Results of associations between class membership and sub-
sequent psychotic experiences were substantively the same
whenexcludingparticipantswhosepsychoticexperiencesonly
ever occurred within 2 hours of any drug use (eTable 8 in the
Supplement) and when examining narrower or broader psy-
chotic outcome definitions (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Psychotic Experiences at Age 12 Years and Patterns
of Cigarette and/or Cannabis Use at Ages 14 to 19 Years
Definite psychotic experiences at age 12 years were associ-
ated with increased odds of subsequent late-onset cigarette-
only use (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.01-3.10) and late-onset cannabis
use (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.94-2.91) as compared with nonusers
(Table 3 and eTable 10 in the Supplement).
There was little evidence that psychotic experiences at age
12 years were associated with increased odds of early-onset
cigarette-onlyorcannabisuse;however,theseclasseshadsmaller
membership(FigureandTable3).Adjustingforconfoundershad
minimalimpactonassociationsbetweenpsychoticexperiences
at age 12 years and classes of subsequent cannabis and/or ciga-
rette use. The effect estimates for all classes were smaller, and
evidence of association weaker (particularly for early-onset
classes), when restricting the analysis to nonusers of cigarettes
and/or cannabis at age 12 years (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Both early-onset and late-onset cannabis use classes were as-
sociated with psychotic experiences at age 18 years and were
only minimally attenuated after adjusting for potential con-
founders. In contrast, there was inadequate evidence to sup-
port an association between either early-onset or late-onset
cigarette-only use and psychotic experiences in the adjusted
analyses. There was also evidence that participants in the late-
onset cannabis use class had higher odds of psychotic expe-
riences than those in the late-onset cigarette-only use class,
the 2 most common substance use classes in our data. There
was no evidence to support a stronger association of early-
onset cannabis use compared with late-onset cannabis use on
psychotic outcomes as proposed by some, but not all, studies,1
although the relatively small size of the early-onset class has
limited power to detect small-moderate effects.
Adjusting for a broad range of potential confounders did
not alter the estimate of association for either the early- or late-
onset cannabis use class but resulted in an approximately 60%
attenuation of the estimate for the early-onset cigarette-only
class. This difference in the impact of adjustment for con-
founders indicates that the association between cannabis use
and psychotic experiences is more robust against explana-
tions of residual confounding than that for tobacco use.
In comparison, we found little evidence that psychotic ex-
periences in childhood led to increased cannabis use. As other
observational studies have indicated,28-30 the self-medication
hypothesis does not appear to adequately explain the associa-
tion between cannabis use and psychosis. Such a relationship
for tobacco use is also not well supported by our data.

clude a possible association of cigarette-only use with psy-
chotic experiences. A number of longitudinal studies have re-
ported that tobacco users are at greater risk for later psychotic

cannabis use, and while adjusting for diagnoses of drug abuse

In our previous study using the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children cohort, we reported that the associa-
tion between cannabis use and psychotic experiences was al-
tered only slightly by adjusting for early or childhood con-
founders but that interpretation of results adjusted for tobacco
use was problematic because of a strong relationship be-
tweenthesemeasures.16Inthecurrentstudy,wearebetterable
to disentangle differential effects of tobacco use from those of
cannabis use through use of data at multiple time points to de-
scribe patterns of use associated with both of these sub-
stances over time. Our findings are consistent with another
study in which adjusting for confounding using fixed-effects
regression to deal with unmeasured time-invariant effects re-
sultedinmuchgreaterattenuationofassociationbetweenciga-

We recently conducted a mendelian randomization study

tion and schizophrenia risk,36 while our mendelian random-
ization study of cannabis initiation and schizophrenia risk
provided evidence for causal pathways operating in both
directions.14 However, in both cases our analyses were

 reflect the effects of longer-term regular use. The lack of ad-
equate samples and strong genetic instruments for regular
cannabis use limit current use of mendelian randomization
studies to further inform causal inference.
Limitations
One of the strengths of our study is that we use a large, well-
characterized cohort, albeit of mostly European ancestry, with
multiplemeasuresofexposuresofinterestandpsychoticexpe-
riencedataovertime,withdataonabroadrangeofpotentialcon-
founders collected prospectively. Using information across the
entire adolescent period rather than from a single time point
means our results are much less prone to measurement error.
However,thereisconsiderableattritionovertime,althoughthe
use of a latent class method with longitudinal data allows us to
maximizeuseofdataforindividualsevenwhereparticipationand
questionresponsehavebeensporadic,andhencetominimizepo-
tential selection bias to some extent. While use of a latent class
methodconfersanumberofadvantagesoverusingmeasuresat
singletimepoints,itwasnotpossibletodefineaclassofindividu-
als who use cannabis without tobacco as most cannabis users
smoke cannabis in combination with tobacco.37 Therefore, we
cannotruleoutwhethertheassociationsobservedbetweenthe
cannabisuseclassandpsychoticexperiencesareexacerbatedby
thecombineduseofcannabisandcigarettes.Whileexperimen-
talstudiesofintravenousΔ9-THCsupportacausaleffectofcan-
nabisonacutepsychoticexperiencesintheabsenceoftobacco,10
thereissomeevidencethatsmokingcannabiswithtobaccoalso
increases the amount of THC inhaled per gram.38
Furthermore, we have previously found that a substan-
tial proportion of people who smoke cigarettes most heavily
also use cannabis, and thus the cigarette-only class might not
include those who have been most heavily exposed to to-
bacco. As the cannabis use group in our study included occa-
sional (1-3 times in the past 6 months) and frequent (daily) us-
ers, we were unable to differentiate whether our findings are
mainly driven by frequent users; including frequency of sub-
stance use data resulted in an unstable model. Our study was
also not able to examine associations of longer-term cumula-
tive cannabis and tobacco use and psychosis outcomes, al-
though these analyses may become tractable in the future.
While psychotic experiences in the population are rela-
tively poor predictors of psychotic disorder,23 they represent
the key characteristic of such disorders, and understanding
their etiology almost certainly has relevance to understand-
ing the etiology of clinically defined psychosis. However, we
were not adequately powered to investigate the effects of can-
nabis or cigarette use on psychotic disorders and cannot rule
out different effects of these substances on other psychosis-
relatedpsychopathology,suchasnegativesymptoms.Wewere
also unable to tease out associations of cannabis with chronic
vs acute psychotic outcomes, although excluding individuals
whoreportedpsychoticexperiencesonlyeveroccurringwithin
2 hours of using drugs had minimal effect on our results. Nev-
ertheless, given the long half-life of THC, the only way of de-
termining whether cannabis use can lead to chronic psy-
chotic disorders that persist long after potential effects of
exogenous cannabinoids is to study regular users of cannabis
who subsequently become abstinent.30
The one longitudinal study of which we are aware that ex-
amined this relationship reported only weak evidence of as-
sociation between ex–cannabis use and psychotic experi-
ences, although there were relatively few ex–cannabis users.30
Given the age of the participants over the course of our study,
we were not able to identify a class of ex–cannabis users to
clarify this relationship; however, long-term follow-up of this
cohort may enable us to address this question more robustly.
Conclusions
Our study found that both adolescent cannabis use and ciga-
rette use are associated with increased risk for subsequent psy-
chotic experiences. This association was greater for canna-
bis. Associations observed between tobacco use and psychotic
experiences are more likely than those for cannabis use to be
influenced by other characteristics of people who develop psy-
chotic experiences.
