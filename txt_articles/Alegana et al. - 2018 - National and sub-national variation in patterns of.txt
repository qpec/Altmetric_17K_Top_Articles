Given national healthcare coverage gaps, understanding treatment-seeking behaviour for
fever is crucial for the management of childhood illness and to reduce deaths. Here, we
conduct a modelling study triangulating household survey data for fever in children under the
age of five years with georeferenced public health facility databases (n = 86,442 facilities) in
29 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, to estimate the probability of seeking treatment for
fever at public facilities. A Bayesian item response theory framework is used to estimate this
probability based on reported fever episodes, treatment choice, residence, and estimated
travel-time to the nearest public-sector health facility. Findings show inter- and intra-country
variation, with the likelihood of seeking treatment for fever less than 50% in 16 countries.
Results highlight the need to invest in public healthcare and related databases. The variation
in public sector use illustrates the need to include such modelling in future infectious disease
burden estimation.

ebrile illness, despite being associated with several childhood
illnesses1–3, is a poorly understood feature of infectious
disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Importantly, intensity
of infection shapes the course of illness4,5, leading to variation in
the perception of disease as well as actions taken for treatment in
public health systems or privately6. This variation is key to
understanding treatment-seeking for childhood illness in the
public health sectors across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Treatment-seeking for fever, as measured in current nationally
representative household surveys, is presently the most wide-
spread surrogate method of estimating treatment of most sus-
pected childhood infectious diseases. However, despite previous
descriptive studies on treatment-seeking for fever6–9, variation in
the interpretation of what constitutes fever at individual level,
driven collectively by disease factors, perception of severity and
health system factors, makes comparisons problematic. Therefore,
there is a need for increased understanding of individual char-
acteristics related to seeking treatment for fever within health
systems in SSA, specifically on the determinants of treatment-
seeking behaviour and the mechanisms underpinning variation at
national and sub-national levels. Modelling treatment-seeking
health behaviour would support future case burden estimation at
peripheral health facilities and, in turn, improve planning of
appropriate peripheral health facilities3,10,11.
Differences in the interpretation of fever and perception of its
severity affect treatment-seeking behaviour. Person-level latent
characteristics concerning ability to seek treatment should form the
backbone of understanding collective population health behaviour.
However, previous studies did not examine latent characteristics that
are related to such person-level interpretations from surveys across
different cultures, thus, preventing quantitative comparison at the
national level. The main objectives of this study were to conduct such
a quantitative analysis from cross-sectional surveys and to translate
person-latent effects into population-level probabilistic estimates that
are comparable at national or sub-national level. Therefore, no
attempt was made to quantify fever attributable to malaria, for
example, as recently estimated here12. Bayesian item response theory
(IRT)13 was employed to quantify person-level characteristics,
namely the latent ability to seek treatment at the nearest public health
facility, adjusting for travel time and residence. These latent char-
acteristics were then used to estimate the probability of seeking
treatment for fever in the public sector based on geography.
Results
Summary of data on fever prevalence. In total, 407,218 children
under the age of 5 years were included using data from recent
nationally representative household surveys in 43 sub-Saharan
countries (household survey data summarised in Supplementary
Data 1). Of the 407,218 children included, ~99,613 reported a
fever episode 2weeks prior to the survey and, of these, 56,719
(56.9%) sought treatment in the public sector. Prevalence of fever
varied within and between countries and was highest in Nigeria

13.9% (8.4 – 16.0%), The Gambia 7.0% (6.2–9.7%) and Djibouti
4.8% (3.3–6.25%).
Fig. 1a shows the distribution of health facilities while Fig. 1b

low in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Southern
Somalia, Central African Republic and Madagascar where the
aggregated national estimate in the public sector was less than 0.1
per 1000 under 5 children (Fig. 1b). Aggregated national estimates
exceeded 10 per 1000 children in parts of Equatorial Guinea and
Gabon. Although Fig. 1b exhibits heterogeneity at the country-level,

 these aggregation-based estimates are challenging to interpret and
compare across population groups due to differences in perceptions
of fever across different populations in sub-Saharan Africa. It was,
therefore, necessary to estimate person-level latent traits related to
observed data and use these to provide probabilistic estimates at the
national or sub-national level.
Summary of assembled public health facilities. Overall, 86,442
public-based health facilities were assembled in SSA (Fig. 1a).
5250 (6.3%) of these comprised major regional and district hos-
pitals, while the rest constituted health centres (22.2%) or dis-
pensaries (71.5%). The largest number of facilities were in
Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya. Figure 2 (a–c) shows geographic
accessibility to hospitals, health centres and lower-tier health
facilities (dispensaries, clinic or health posts) based on travel time.
Geographic access varied based on density of public health
facilities and was overall congruent to population density.
Probability of seeking fever treatment in the public sector.
Fig. 3a shows national variation in the probability of treatment-
seeking for fever by travel time to the nearest public healthcare
facility (Supplementary Figure 1 shows spatial variation by facility
type). These patterns were estimated from the posterior medians
of latent parameters based on Bayesian item response theory
modelling. The shaded region and vertical lines of Fig. 3a show the
probability of seeking treatment for fever in the public sector by
travel time at 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h. The posterior median
summaries for these time intervals are presented in Table 1.
Fig. 3b shows a funnel plot of national variation in the
probability of treatment-seeking for fever at the nearest primary
healthcare facility (dispensaries, clinics or health posts). Whilst
there was variation at the national and sub-national levels,
modelled population probability of seeking treatment for fever at
the nearest primary healthcare facility within 30 min’ travel time
was low in Ethiopia (0.21, 95% Bayesian credible intervals
0.16–0.23) and Nigeria (0.37, 0.34– 0.42). In Uganda and Tanzania
there was respectively a 69% [0.69 (0.44–0.76)] and 66% [0.66
(0.43–0.72)] chance of seeking treatment at 30 min’ travel time to
the nearest primary public healthcare facility, although the
credible intervals were wider (Supplementary Data 2).
The strength of distance-decay effect varied at the country-level
and was minimal in some countries (e.g., Tanzania, Burkina Faso)
and varied more in Gabon, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Overall, the
effect suggested a reduction in the proportion of children seeking
treatment at greater travel time. The minimum threshold
probability of seeking treatment for fever at 2 h was 0.21 in
Ethiopia (95% Bayesian Credible Interval 0.20–0.26 black dashed
line) and Nigeria 0.35 (0.27–0.42), suggesting at most a 21 and
35% chance of treatment for people living more than 2 h from a
facility, respectively.
Table 1 summarises posterior median national-level treatment-
seeking for fever probability estimates at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min
time intervals to any public health facility (i.e., the shaded region
of Fig. 3a, which shows national variation). Maps of sub-national
variation are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. In 16 of the 29
countries, the posterior median (probability of seeking fever
treatment) was less than 50% at 2 h’ travel time from the nearest
facility. For example, the posterior median probability at 2 h’ travel
time for Madagascar was 0.49 (0.36–0.66), suggesting ~50% of
fever cases were not treated in the public sector at 2 h’ travel time.
Discussion
The probability of obtaining appropriate treatment for febrile
illnesses is a key factor in reducing disease morbidity and mor-
tality in SSA. Using a combination of health facility databases and

 fever, our findings show national and sub-national variation in
the probability of seeking treatment for fever in the public sector.
From the 29 countries examined, the probability of treatment-
seeking for children living 2 h from a public health facility was
less than 50% in 16 countries, which suggested that in these
countries, at least half of febrile cases were untreated or treated
outside the public sector. There was a marginally higher like-
lihood of fever treatment-seeking at a primary healthcare facility
(dispensary or clinic) compared with a major hospital. The
novelty of this study was in translating latent characteristics
related to treatment-seeking choices at individual level to prob-
abilistic metrics, so as to aid national and sub-national compar-
ability.
The
findings
are,
therefore,
not
only
useful
in
understanding patterns of service delivery, geographic coverage
gaps and utilisation, but also are applicable to future disease
burden estimation.
Health facility spatial databases form a bedrock for many
health studies. A triangulation of these healthcare information
system data with household surveys provides an insight into
public health system failures. It is not clear if estimates on
treatment-seeking quantified here for children under the age of
five reflect treatment-seeking for childhood diseases with fever
symptoms in the public sector or in other age-groups. With
declining malaria prevalence, recent evidence suggests most fever
cases in children under the age of 5 years are not due to malaria
infection12. Fever, in general, is known to be associated with other
childhood illnesses including, but not limited to, bacterial infec-
tions, parasitic infections, and upper or lower respiratory tract
viral infections1,6. The mechanisms underpinning seasonality of
these infections varies by age and geography8,14. A suggestion for
future research is to investigate the impact of both age and type of
disease on fever healthcare-seeking behaviour, in addition to
improving knowledge on aetiology of fever15. Fever cases treated
at public health facilities are just the tip of the iceberg of the
burden within the population16,17. Our findings highlight an
attributable proportion of fevers treated outside the public sector.
While this variation is expected due to factors such as proximity,
results suggest the need to increase understanding of behavioural
patterns in seeking treatment for fever in countries with a rela-
tively larger private sector18,19. This would also enable fair
comparisons between public and private sectors in different
socio-economic and cultural contexts. In countries with a rela-
tively high burden of fever and where use of the public sector is
low, such as in Mozambique and Ethiopia, such an undertaking
would be useful for improving case management practises. Cur-
rently, the recommended approach is to increase the use of
community-based programmes11,20,21 in addition to improving
physical accessibility.
There were additional data limitations based on the nationally
representative survey data used in this study. These include the
non-sampling error and a geo-location error introduced to cluster
coordinates for personal data protection22. The non-sampling
error, although unknown, varies at the country-level based on
survey quality, which varies by implementing organisation. We
also did not explore the influence of seasonality on fever treat-
ment because cross-sectional surveys provide only limited
insights into both inter- and intra-annual variability of fever
events. This is because such nationally representative household
surveys are conducted only every 3–5 years and the duration of
surveys is typically two-to-six months. While health facility
databases are fragmented and need consolidation by the respec-
tive ministries of health, the presence of private health facilities
could have impacted on observed uptake of public healthcare
facilities23. We did not model this competition, since complete
spatial databases of private healthcare providers were not avail-
able. Moreover, multiple sources of treatment could have been
used for a single fever episode24. Our findings, however, could be
extended to understand other aspects of public healthcare deliv-
ery, including estimating the probability of receiving an inter-
vention at a public health facility.

 Unlike in previous observational research on treatment prac-
tises, the methodology employed here modelled latent char-
acteristics based on the IRT framework25. IRT concepts are
common to other health applications such as psychometry and
could be applied in future household survey analyses to under-
stand the differential item functioning in population sub-groups
with similar latent traits26,27. We conducted an assessment and
generalisation of this methodology to mixed effects regression
including gender and socio-economic status13,28,29. While inclu-
sion of more regression effects in previous experiments would
have been advantageous, the resulting complexity in modelling
negatively impacted model performance and efficiency sig-
nificantly13. The strength of this methodology, however, was in
producing metrics that can be comparable at the country-level or
at the sub-national level and providing insight into public sector
service delivery. Moreover, using a Bayesian approach had the
added advantage of quantifying uncertainty related to seeking
treatment. An additional advantage of this approach was in
constraining probability estimates to control for variation in
distance to a given health facility.30
In conclusion, the accumulation of nationally representative
surveys, such as the Demographic Health Surveys, Malaria Indi-
cator Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys provides
enormous potential for understanding human health behaviour.
This possibility is further increased by the availability of fine
spatial resolution population maps as well as georeferenced health
facility databases. Health facility databases, however, require more
accurate and complete mapping at the national level. The African
ministries of health should consider conducting national censuses
to establish and update the existing lists assembled by this study.
The variation in fever-treatment patterns for children under five
estimated here suggests a need to understand healthcare utilisa-
tion outside the public sector.
Methods
Individual-level data on fever treatment choices. Data on fever treatment
choices were assembled from the most recently undertaken nationally repre-
sentative population-based household surveys in SSA. These were undertaken
predominantly in the last five years in most countries and include the Malaria
Indicator Survey (MIS) [n = 12 surveys], Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
[n = 23 surveys], Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) [n = 6 surveys], the
AIDs and Malaria Indicator Survey (AIS) in Mozambique and the 2006 South
Sudan Household Survey (SSHS). These data were not available or not georefer-
enced in 11 countries (Botswana, Cape Verde, Central Africa Republic, Guinea
Bissau, Mauritania, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, Seychelles, South
Sudan, Chad and South Africa). Individual-level data from the most recent
household surveys in Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia and Sudan were
not available in the public domain, leaving data for 29 countries available for
Bayesian analysis. Therefore, countries where georeferenced data were not available
were excluded from the analysis of probability of treatment-seeking at public
healthcare facilities. Figure 1b was, however, constructed based on a combination
of raw counts of fever cases treated from these nationally representative samples at
administrative level 1 and population estimates of children under the age of 5
years31. To maximise completeness of Fig. 1b, published national reports at
administrative level 1 from a recent round of MICS surveys were used in countries
where data were not available (in Djibouti, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Maur-
itania, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia and the one survey in South Sudan). These
surveys are internationally standardised and are usually based on a random two-
stage cluster sampling design in which clusters are first sampled based on a
probability-proportional-to-size basis and thereafter, within each cluster, house-
holds are sampled randomly14,32. Cluster sizes vary, but were ~15–30 households.
Each child’s primary carer or mother was interviewed on child febrile illness two
weeks prior to the survey as well as actions undertaken to treat the most recent
fever episode. For clarity, treatment-seeking for fever in children under 5 years was
based on the carer’s or mother’s response. This study examined individual-level
traits related to the indicator on actions taken for treatment of fever in general.
Missing data were included as NAs in the Bayesian latent trait estimation if a child

 had a fever in the period two weeks prior to the survey, but the response on
treatment was marked as don’t know.
A well-known phenomenon of fever treatment-seeking behaviour is the decay-
effect at a greater travel time or distance from the potential source of treatment13.
The phenomenon of distance- or travel time-decay has been observed in previous
studies33,34 and occurs when the usage of health facilities declines with increasing
distance in space or time35,36. Our methodology for estimating travel times has
been documented in several previous studies. In brief, a gridded raster layer of
travel time to health facility was estimated by combining, in Geographic
Information System (GIS) AccessMod 537, spatial layers on land cover or land use
characteristics with roads, elevation and location of health facilities. This spatial
modelling approach incorporated elevation to capture the influence of slope on
travel speed between different land characteristics. Estimated travel time was
included here as an explanatory variable reflecting ability to seek treatment. It is
not expected that all febrile patients in very close proximity to a public health
facility seek treatment there because some mild-fevers self-resolve, are treated
through informal care or private sector health facilities, are home managed or may
be treated at a more distant public hospital24.
Spatial databases of health facilities. An inventory of major public-based hos-
pitals in SSA has already been published elsewhere [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/
JTL9VY]38,39. In addition to the major regional and district hospitals, spatial
databases of lower-tier health facilities (dispensaries, clinics, health posts and health
centres) were assembled and georeferenced. The assembled lists consisted mainly of
public non-profit health facilities managed by governments, local authorities, faith-
based organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). A census of
health facilities (public and private) has been conducted in Namibia40 and
Malawi41 and some countries such as Sierra Leone are in the process of conducting
Service Availability and Readiness Assessments (SARA)42. In other countries such
as Kenya, a spatial database of all health facilities was published previously and
updated regularly43. Spatial health facility databases were incomplete in two pro-
vinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Guinea Bissau. For these
countries, travel times to lower-tier facilities were not computed, as shown in
Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c. In addition, the probability of seeking treatment for fever was
estimated only at major hospitals for these regions. Private or specialised health
facilities (e.g., eye clinics, TB centres, special injury units) were excluded from the
analysis because; (a) a complete list of private health facilities was not available in
these countries and (b) the specialised health facilities, in general, do not treat
uncomplicated febrile illness.
Modelled probability of seeking fever treatment. A unidimensional three-
parameter model (3PL) based on Item Response Theory (IRT)44 was used to
estimate latent individual traits for actions undertaken to treat a fever episode.
Analysis was performed separately for each country. Travel time to nearest health
facility and place of residence were extracted based on our methods demonstrated
in Refs 13,45 for Namibia and replicated for all the counties in SSA (Fig. 2a–c). This
variable as well as residence (urban or rural status) was used as an explanatory
variable for the individual ability parameter within a hierarchical Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian framework. This methodology has also been
evaluated elsewhere including the effect of residence (urban and rural)13. The
probability of seeking treatment for fever was modelled via:

Where Yij represents a dichotomous behavioural response (0 or 1) if treatment was
sought for an individual j(j=1,……,N) and i=1 on use of public healthcare for
treatment. f(θ,a,b,c) is a collection of unknown parameters with f(θ,a,b,c)=f(θ) f(a)
f(b) f(c) as the posterior density we aim to evaluate. In general, θj=θj1……,θjk,……
θjm; −∞<θjk>+∞ for k=1,……m dimensions (although only one dimension was
considered) represents the person trait (i.e., individual-level ability) and has a
central influence on discriminant and difficulty parameters. This was para-
meterised as θj=αj+β1jX1j+β2jX2j with βj representing coefficients of dependent
variables Xj exploring differences in ability. The primary focus was on the θj
parameter, rather than the coefficients. Travel time and residence (urban or rural)
were included as predictor variables on the ability parameter. This study did not
include all the possible socio-demographic variables due to the marginal compu-
tational gains from doing so, as demonstrated in previous assessments of this
methodology13. aik in Equation 1 represents the item discrimination parameters,
and is positive (aik>0), for different types of treatment centres or health facilities
used (Hospital, dispensary or health centre); bik (−∞<bik<∞) represents survey
item difficulty parameters, while ci (0<ci<1) represents the threshold (i.e., mini-
mum) probability parameter for individual i. The probability threshold parameter
and the ability parameter are most relevant for the current health application.
Given equation 1 applies to one item (i=1 and k=1) the discrimination and
difficulty parameters have a marginal influence on the overall probability. The
probability threshold parameter was constrained based on a prior distribution at
greater than zero and less than one. The posterior distribution is then expressed as
the product of the likelihood and prior distributions for unknown parameters as:
f θ; a; b; cjy

implementation was evaluated using a combination of Gelman–Rubin with
Raftery–Lewis diagnostic to check for convergence46,47 using three chains in JAGS
version 4.2.0 and the rjags package in R version 3.3.148. The sample IRT code is
included in the Supplementary Software 1. In brief, 550,000 iterations were
implemented with a burn in of 50,000 and a thinning factor of 500, resulting in a
weakly dependent sample size of n = 1000. An example of convergence diagnostics
is shown in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3. Posterior
summaries of the parameters were used to back-calculate the probability of seeking
treatment for fever (via Equation 1) and the response curve was plotted by travel
time. Country-level summaries were also produced for each type of health facility.
Validation was checked using a 10% subset dataset not included in the main
analysis in the 29 countries separately. This validation set was selected randomly
from each nationally representative survey. The remaining 90% of data were used
for the main analysis. The model was then applied to the validation set and the
predicted probability of seeking treatment for fever transformed to a binary
outcome. Model accuracy was evaluated based on the misclassification error of the
binary outcomes. Lastly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to
estimate the specificity and sensitivity of predictions when compared to observed
responses from survey data. Results of the model validation exercise are included in
the Supplementary Data 2.
