Introduction
Heat waves are a public health concern that 
is likely to grow in importance in the context 
of climate change (Huang et al. 2012; Li 
et al. 2013). The impacts of heat waves on 
mortality have been extensively documented 
(Åström et al. 2011; Basagaña et al. 2011; 
Basu 2009; Borrell et al. 2006; Bridger et al. 
1976; Ellis 1972; Jones et al. 1982; Rooney 
et al. 1998). The 1995 Chicago, Illinois, 
heat wave resulted in 700 excess deaths over 
only a few days (Semenza et al. 1996). In 
Europe, around 15,000 excess deaths were 
reported during a heat wave in the first week 
of August 2003 (Robine et al. 2008). More 
recently, approximately 55,000 excess deaths 
(including potential contributing effects of 
wildfire smoke) were associated with the 
2010 heat wave in Russia (Barriopedro et al. 
2011). In response to such events, public 
health authorities have developed programs 
aimed at reducing heat wave-related health 
effects, including heat action plans (HAPs).
HAPs include early alerts and advisories 
combined with emergency public health 
measures to reduce heat-related morbidity and 
mortality (Kovats and Hajat 2008; Kovats and 
Kristie 2006; Lowe et al. 2011; McGregor 
et al. 2015). HAPs are activated when meteo-
rological conditions meet local criteria for 
classification of hot days, each jurisdiction 
having its own precise criteria (Tong et al. 
2010). Variations exist in terminology to 
describe such public health programs (Toloo 
et al. 2013). In this paper, we use the term 
“HAPs” to refer to such programs.
The content of HAPs is generally based 
on existing empirical evidence of risk and 
protective factors for heat-related health 
impacts. In the absence of evaluations of 
actual HAP implementation, however, it 
remains unknown whether the various activi-
ties carried out in a HAP have an effect on 
heat-related mortality and morbidity. Such 
evidence would help inform future interven-
tions aimed at reducing heat-related health 
impacts. Evaluating the effectiveness of 
public health programs is essential for several 
reasons: a) to assess whether policies effec-
tively prevent and control mortality and 
morbidity; b) to evaluate whether programs 
are ethical, a good use of public resources, 
and efficient in reducing social inequalities; 
and c) to determine whether programs should 
be renewed or improved at the end of an 
initial trial period.
Very few studies have assessed the effec-
tiveness of HAPs on health. In two recent 
reviews (Boeckmann and Rohn 2014; Toloo 
et al. 2013), only seven studies worldwide 
assessed the effectiveness of HAPs in reducing 
mortality. Six studies found that fewer people 
died of heat-related complications after the 
implementation of a HAP than was expected 
had the program not been in place (Chau 
et al. 2009; Ebi et al. 2004; Fouillet et al. 
2008; Palecki et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2007; 
Weisskopf et al. 2002), whereas one study 
did not report an association (Morabito et al. 
2012). Some of these studies were descrip-
tive, using a pre–post approach to estimate 
the reduction in mortality attributable to the 
HAP by comparing the number of deaths 
on hot days before HAP implementation 
with the number after implementation. A 
pre–post approach may document varia-
tion in mortality, but, because it does not 
account for potential confounding (e.g., 
factors other than HAPs that are associated 
with heat-related mortality and have changed 
over time), does not provide evidence of 
causal effects associated with the program, 
which is fundamental to formulating and 
implementing effective HAPs. Other studies 
(Ebi et al. 2004; Morabito et al. 2012) 
used control groups (e.g., other cities) and 
controlled for measured confounders, but 
still may have been biased by unmeasured 
confounders. To deal with unmeasured 
confounders, quasi-experimental methods

Background: The impact of heat waves on mortality and health inequalities is well documented. 
Very few studies have assessed the effectiveness of heat action plans (HAPs) on health, and none has 
used quasi-experimental methods to estimate causal effects of such programs.
oBjectives: We developed a quasi-experimental method to estimate the causal effects associated 
with HAPs that allows the identification of heterogeneity across subpopulations, and to apply this 
method specifically to the case of the Montreal (Quebec, Canada) HAP.
Methods: A difference-in-differences approach was undertaken using Montreal death registry data 
for the summers of 2000–2007 to assess the effectiveness of the Montreal HAP, implemented in 
2004, on mortality. To study equity in the effect of HAP implementation, we assessed whether the 
program effects were heterogeneous across sex (male vs. female), age (≥ 65 years vs. < 65 years), and 
neighborhood education levels (first vs. third tertile). We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the 
validity of the estimated causal effect of the HAP program.
results: We found evidence that the HAP contributed to reducing mortality on hot days, and that 
the mortality reduction attributable to the program was greater for elderly people and people living 
in low-education neighborhoods.
conclusion: These findings show promise for programs aimed at reducing the impact of extreme 
temperatures and health inequities. We propose a new quasi-experimental approach that can be 
easily applied to evaluate the impact of any program or intervention triggered when daily thresholds 
are reached.

 Effects of a heat action plan on mortality

have been developed for observational studies 
as alternatives to experimental methods and 
are used to provide estimates from observa-
tional studies. The term “quasi-experiment” 
refers to the analysis of an observed treatment 
in relation to an outcome measure in which 
assignment to the treatment is not made by 
physical randomization, as in a true experi-
ment, but is instead assigned according to 
some mechanism that can be argued to be 
independent of the potential outcome of each 
experimental unit. Using the counterfactual 
framework, natural experiments can be used 
to estimate the causal effect of specific policies 
on population health.
The European heat wave of 2003 
prompted the Montreal Public Health 
Department (PHD) to develop a HAP to 
reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity 
(Price et al. 2013). Implemented in 2004, 
the HAP comprises a spectrum of interven-
tions triggered at different alert levels based 
on temperature forecasts of Environment 
Canada. Important interventions undertaken 
as part of the HAP by the Montreal PHD and 
partners are triggered at the alert level (called 
“Active watch” level in the Montreal HAP), 
when daily temperatures exceed 30°C (Price 
et al. 2013). These interventions include, for 
example, public advisories via different media 
about preventive measures, and intensified 
surveillance and implementation of preventive 
measures in health care facilities (Appendix 1). 
The alert level is followed by two other levels, 
associated with additional interventions such 
as extended operational hours of public pools 
and opening of air-conditioned shelters. The 
HAP is active on days defined as hot, and not 
active on other summer days. The program 
is automatically triggered by meteorological 
conditions, and targets the entire population 
of the Island of Montreal. Although imple-
mented in 2004, mortality attributable to 
heat continues to be observed in Montreal 
(Benmarhnia et al. 2014b), with 105 heat-
related deaths occurring during a 5-day heat 
wave in 2010 (Price et al. 2013) suggesting the 
need to evaluate this program. Evidence about 
the effectiveness of the HAP is essential to 
improve this program.
The impact of heat waves on mortality 
is uneven, and economically or socially 
disadvantaged populations are at higher 
risk for heat-related death. Potential factors 
associated with vulnerability to heat-related 
mortality, including age, sex, education, and 
neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), 
have been documented (Benmarhnia et al. 
2015a; Gronlund 2014). It is thus worth-
while to assess whether HAPs are effective 
in reducing or eliminating unequal health 
outcomes associated with heat. However, an 
assessment of the heterogeneity of potential 
benefits across subpopulations or territories 
(e.g., neighborhoods) is lacking in the policy 
evaluation literature (Bauman et al. 2014; 
Benmarhnia et al. 2014a).
The equity impact of a policy, defined as 
the differential reduction of mortality between 
vulnerable and nonvulnerable populations, 
can be assessed by using a quasi-experimental 
method to identify heterogeneity in potential 
benefits among subpopulations or territories. 
We define as “equitable” any policy that 
reduces inequality in which vulnerable popu-
lations start from a comparatively worse-off 
position. For example, a policy that reduces 
inequalities in mortality between the elderly 
and other age groups (e.g., daily mortality 
differences between the two age groups) is by 
our definition equitable, if the elderly experi-
enced higher mortality rates before its imple-
mentation. We stress, however, that one can 
employ alternative definitions of equity when 
using our method.
Using a difference-in-differences approach 
(a quasi-experimental method that can be used 
to estimate the causal effects of public health 
policies) (Angrist and Pischke 2008; Basu et al. 
2016), we aimed to estimate the causal effect of 
the HAP program on mortality in Montreal. 
We assessed whether the HAP program had 
a heterogeneous effect across sex, age, and 
 
neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES).
Methods
Data Sources
The study population included all residents of 
the Island of Montreal who died during the 
months of June, July, and August between 
2000 and 2007, inclusively, and were listed 
in the provincial death registry. We restricted 
the population to non-accidental causes of 
death, excluding deaths for International 
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) 
codes 800–999 (injury and poisoning) and 
10th Revision (ICD-10) codes S00–T98 
(injury, poisoning, and other consequences 
of external causes). Individual information 
on age, sex, date of death, and census tract 
of residence was available for each death. 
Deaths were aggregated daily. We used the 
percentage of residents > 20 years of age 
without a high school diploma in the census 
tract of residence (at time of death) to assign 
a “neighborhood SES” to each participant in 
the study; data were extracted from the 2006 
census (Benmarhnia et al. 2015b). We gener-
ated three strata of neighborhood SES by 
dividing the data into tertiles, and compared 
the first and third tertiles in the analysis.
We obtained maximum outdoor 
temperatures for the months of June through 
August between 2000 and 2007 from the 
Environment Canada meteorological obser-
vation station at the Montreal Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau International Airport (Environment 
Canada 2015). The meteorological observa-
tion station used in this study is also used for 
activation of the Montreal HAP.
Study Design and Statistical 
Analysis
We used a difference-in-differences (DID) 
design, in which daily mortality for the 
population of Montreal was compared before 
and after HAP implementation in 2004. 
Summer days (June–August) were classi-
fied as “eligible” if they were hot enough to 
have triggered an “active watch” alert level 
according to the HAP (i.e., if they would 
have been eligible for a HAP intervention), 
or as “non-eligible” otherwise, regardless of 
whether they occurred during 2000–2003 
(before the HAP was implemented) or 
during 2004–2007 (after the HAP was 
implemented). The counterfactual quantity 
of interest is the difference in the daily 
number of deaths between eligible (hot) and 
non-eligible (non-hot) days that would have 
occurred during 2004–2007 if the HAP had 
not been implemented. Therefore, the causal 
effect of the HAP on daily mortality was esti-
mated as the difference between two values: 
a) the difference in number of deaths on 
eligible (hot) days before and after implemen-
tation of the HAP, and b) the difference in 
number of deaths on ineligible (non-hot) days 
before and after implementation of the HAP. 
We thus obtained a DID estimate to repre-
sent the causal effect of the HAP program on 
daily mortality in Montreal.
The DID approach will generate a valid 
estimate of the causal effect if the imple-
mentation of the HAP was the only factor 
that might cause a change in the association 
between heat and mortality before and after 
HAP implementation. We chose a short 
interval of time (4 years before and 4 years 
after initiation of HAP), to limit potential 
confounding due to population acclimati-
zation and urban infrastructure changes 
(Petkova et al. 2014) that might reduce the 
effect of hot days on mortality during the 
post-HAP time period. We also compared the 
distributions (using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test for equality of distribution functions) of 
maximum daily temperatures on eligible and 
non-eligible days during each time period 
to determine whether, for example, higher 
maximum daily temperatures on eligible 
days during the post-HAP time period might 
bias our estimate of the effect of the HAP by 
increasing mortality on eligible days.
We estimated the HAP effect on daily 
mortality using a time series analysis in DID 
Poisson models adjusted to account for 
temporal patterns (month, week, and day). 
To calculate the daily number of deaths 
“prevented” during hot days after HAP 
implementation, we predicted the Poisson

count from the adjusted models using the 
DID estimate. The DID estimate repre-
sents the product interaction term between 
the estimated effect of eligible (hot) versus 
non-eligible (non-hot) days and the esti-
mated effect of the pre-HAP (2000–2003) 
versus post-HAP (2004–2007) time period. 
A positive value of the DID estimate gener-
ated with this method represents an estimated 
reduction of daily mortality attributable to the 
HAP, because we compared pre-HAP deaths 
to post-HAP deaths. We estimated 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the adjusted 
DID estimate by bootstrapping (1,000 
samples) (Carpenter and Bithell 2000).
As sensitivity analyses, we tested the 
validity of the causal model by conducting 
the same analyses above, but defining HAP 
at arbitrary implementation periods: a) in 
2000 and b) in 2002. We compared differ-
ences in mortality on eligible and non-eligible 
days between 4-year time periods that were 
unrelated to the HAP intervention: a) 1996–
1999 versus 2000–2003; and b) 1998–2001 
versus 2002–2005. We then tested different 
definitions of hot days (thus modifying the 
assignment of “eligible” and “non-eligible” 
days) in order to test the validity of the causal 
model. We also used a definition of hot 
days as maximum temperatures above 28°C 
and above 32°C, expecting no effect of the 
HAP on mortality reduction. We consid-
ered the cumulative heat effect (lag 0–5: up 
to 5 consecutive hot days) (Åström et al. 
2011), expecting a larger effect of the HAP on 
mortality reduction by considering consecu-
tive hot days. We selected this lag period based 
on previous studies in Montreal (Goldberg 
et al. 2011). We also calculated the DID 
estimate considering a harvesting effect. This 
is the hypothesis that some frail individuals 
who died during a hot day would have died 
in the subsequent days or weeks even without 
the hot day. These deaths are strictly speaking 
not caused by the hot day, but only hastened 
by it. To estimate this effect, we calculated a 
displacement ratio after 15 days (Saha et al. 
2014). We then multiplied the displacement 
ratio we obtained with the DID estimate to 
get a DID estimate that takes into account 
the harvesting effect. Finally, we calculated 
the DID estimate by restricting “non-eligible” 
days to maximum temperatures between 
25°C and 29°C.
Equity of Program Impact
To study equity in implementation, we 
assessed whether the HAP had a heteroge-
neous effect by sex, age, and neighborhood 
SES. We first dichotomized each of the 
variables: a) sex: men vs. women; b) age 
(≥ 65 years vs. < 65 years); c) SES: first versus 
third tertile of neighborhood education. We 
then calculated daily mortality differences 
between each of the two categories (e.g., daily 
mortality among men minus daily mortality 
among women). The HAP effect on daily 
mortality differences was estimated following 
the same method above. Thus, to assess 
heterogeneity in the program effect, we calcu-
lated differences-in-differences-in-differences 
(DIDID) estimates using a DID estimate 
(i.e., interaction term) as above, but consid-
ering as the health outcome a daily difference 
between two groups.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
During the study period (2000–2007), 
28,137 non-accidental deaths occurred 
during the months of June–August, including 
14,779 among women and 13,358 among 
men. The average number of daily deaths 
was 38.70, with a minimum of 16 deaths 
per day, and a maximum of 73 for the whole 
period. During this interval, 75 heat-wave 
days occurred, including 39 before the HAP 
and 36 after.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics 
before and after HAP implementation for 
non-eligible and eligible groups. The number 
of eligible hot days was similar between the 
two periods (39 and 36 days, respectively). 
Among eligible and non-eligible days, we did 
not find a difference in maximum temperature 
distribution between before- and after-program 
periods (Table 1). We found no difference in 
mortality distribution among non-eligible days 
before and after HAP implementation.
Estimated Effect of HAP on 
Mortality
The adjusted DID model estimated that over 
the entire population, the HAP program 
reduced mortality during hot days by 
2.52 deaths per day (95% CI: –0.34, 5.38). 
This result suggests that HAP may have 
helped reduce mortality during hot days.
Estimated Effect of HAP on Equity
Adjusted estimates for the heterogeneous 
effect by sex, age, and SES are presented in 
Table 2. We estimated that HAP reduced 
differences in mortality between the elderly 
(≥ 65 years) and non-elderly (0–64 years) 
during hot days by 2.44 deaths per day 
(95% CI: 0.27, 4.59). We also estimated that 
HAP program reduced differences in mortality 
between individuals living in neighborhoods 
with low SES and those living in neighbor-
hood with high SES (the middle tertile of 
SES was not included in the analysis) during 
hot days by 2.48 deaths per day (95% CI: 
0.69, 4.27). However we did not find much 
evidence of heterogeneity in the program

effect according to sex, with a DIDID 
estimate of 1.38 (95% CI: –1.60, 4.36).
Sensitivity Analyses
Table 3 presents the adjusted DID estimates 
in sensitivity analyses. When we compared 
4-year periods that were unrelated to HAP 
implementation, we did not find evidence 
of a difference in the effect of hot days on 
mortality between the earlier and later time 
periods based on the heterogeneity test. We 
also failed to find evidence of an effect on 
mortality when hot days were defined at a 
threshold of 28°C, thus misclassifying some 
days during which the Montreal HAP was not 
active as “eligible,” and when the threshold 
was 32°C, thus misclassifying some days when 
the HAP was active as “non-eligible. The latter 
result may be explained in part by the small 
number of hot days when using this definition 
(26 eligible days for the whole period). We 
then defined hot days according to cumulative 
heat (temperature on the day of death and 
up to the 5 days before death), and found 
that HAP program was effective in reducing 
daily mortality during hot days by 4.87 deaths 
per day (95% CI: 0.67, 8.20), a stronger 
effect, in comparison with 2.52 deaths per 
day (95% CI: –0.34, 5.38). Including a 
harvesting effect yielded a DID estimate of 
1.87 (95% CI: 0.29, 3.47). Finally, restricting 
non-eligible days to maximum daily tempera-
tures above 25°C yielded a DID estimate of 
2.23 (95% CI: –0.80, 5.27), which is close 
to the point estimate of the main analysis but 
with a wider confidence interval.
Discussion
We found some evidence that the heat action 
plan implemented in Montreal in 2004 
contributed to reduce mortality overall on hot 
days between 2004 and 2007. Furthermore, 
we observed that this program may have a 
positive effect in reducing some inequities 
in heat-related health impacts, because the 
estimated beneficial effects associated with 
the HAP were greater for elderly people and 
people living in low-SES neighborhoods. 
These findings show promise for further 
implementation of policies aimed at reducing 
the impact of extreme temperatures. Indeed, 
providing evidence about public health 
policies’ effectiveness may be useful to justify 
such investments for stakeholders/political 
leaders, and inform other jurisdictions that 
are considering implementing such policies. 
In addition, we apply this approach to policy 
impact evaluation.
To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to use a quasi-experimental method 
to estimate the causal effects associated with 
a HAP. In addition to providing relevant 
findings regarding this policy’s effectiveness 
in protecting populations, we feel that the 
quasi-experimental methodological approach 
is a major contribution to environmental 
health research. The DID approach that we 
used allows researchers to estimate a policy’s 
causal effect by using non-eligible days 
within the jurisdiction of interest, obviating 
the need for data from other cities or coun-
tries as control groups, the approach used in 
time series analyses with quasi-experimental 
methods (Cook et al. 2008). Our approach is 
distinct from previously published methods 
(Chau et al. 2009; Ebi et al. 2004; Fouillet 
et al. 2008; Morabito et al. 2012; Palecki 
et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2007; Weisskopf et al. 
2002) because it controls for unmeasured 
confounders if the assumptions of the model 
are satisfied. For the DID method, the most 
important assumptions are the adequacy 
of the control group for the counterfactual 
contrast of interest and the absence of other 
interventions contemporaneous with the 
implementation of the new policy. In our 
setting where the control group was based on 
non-hot days in the same city, the validity of 
the causal estimates requires that a) there be 
no important time trends in the outcome of 
interest in the non-eligible group before and 
after policy implementation; and b) the distri-
bution of the variable that defines the eligi-
bility (temperature in this case) should not be 
different between the before and after periods.
Quasi-experimental methods have been 
widely used in recent years as alternatives to 
experimental methods and to observational 
designs that are affected by unmeasured 
confounders. They are designed to be more 
robust than pre–post comparisons that lack 
a control group (Angrist and Pischke 2008; 
Basu et al. 2016). In addition, the DID 
approach used here is not necessarily more 
difficult to implement than methods used 
previously (pre–post approach with a control 
group), provided that DID assumptions are 
met. In addition, our approach can be applied 
to other policies in which implementation 
is based on a daily threshold. For example, 
policies aimed at reducing air pollution 
levels on “smog episode days” (Zivin and 
Neidell 2009) (e.g., adjusting speed limits, 
 
alternative-day driving) can be evaluated 
following the same approach.
We also proposed a DIDID approach 
to evaluate heterogeneity in the HAP effect, 
and its potential impact on health equity. 
Our results suggest that targeting specific 
populations vulnerable to extreme heat (or 
other hazards) may reduce health inequalities 
between vulnerable and comparison groups. 
This might be explained by various actions 
undertaken as part of the HAP (Appendix 1) 
targeting directly some populations identified 
as vulnerable, such as frequent visits to home 
care patients (including elderly individuals) 
or daily phone calls to home care patients. 
DIDID have been used in studies with other 
exposures and health outcomes (Currie et al. 
2014; Harper et al. 2014) to provide infor-
mation about heterogeneity in policy effects. 
With this method, we propose a complemen-
tary approach that can be applied to policy 
evaluation using a time-series design either 
with or without a control group, as long as the 
data meet the assumptions described above.
This study is particularly relevant 
considering recent recommendations 
noted (Woodward et al. 2014) on the need

volume 124 | number 11 | November 2016 • Environmental Health Perspectives
for evidence of effectiveness of HAPs in 
promoting health and reducing health inequal-
ities. Many countries, regions, and cities have 
recently instituted HAPs to reduce heat-related 
mortality and morbidity (Lowe et al. 2011; 
Toloo et al. 2013); however, few have evalu-
ated the effects associated with their implemen-
tation. We therefore encourage further studies 
to estimate the effect of HAPs on mortality 
in other contexts. Further, these methods can 
also be used to assess effects on other health 
outcomes, such as hospitalization for fluid 
and electrolyte disorders or heat stroke (Bobb 
et al. 2014).
There are some limitations to our study. 
First, we assessed the effect of Montreal’s 
HAP without considering the spatial vari-
ability of benefits. Other studies have shown 
intra-city variability in health impacts of 
extreme heat (Hondula and Barnett 2014), 
and it is plausible that HAP benefits had a 
spatial pattern in our case as well. Further 
studies could conduct spatiotemporal analysis 
to address this gap. Because HAP measures 
have been triggered based on forecast 
daily temperatures, it is possible that some 
observed daily temperatures did not corre-
late with forecast data (Åström et al. 2014). 
In addition, by measuring temperature at 
a single site (i.e., the airport), we were not 
able to get within-city temperature vari-
ability that would inform us about exposure 
misclassification that might be correlated with 
neighborhood SES spatial variability (through 
micro–heat islands, for example). Another 
issue is redundancy between categories in the 
equity assessment (for example, prevented 
deaths among older individuals might be 
also counted in prevented deaths among 
individuals living in low-SES neighbor-
hoods). We also did not distinguish actions 
undertaken > 30°C. Moreover, the Montreal 
HAP has been revised and updated yearly 
since 2007 (Price et al. 2013); this was not 
specifically considered in the present study. 
Further research could consider how incre-
mental changes in policies affected mortality 
reduction, if at all. In addition, we did not 
qualitatively or quantitatively explore mecha-
nisms through which the program contrib-
uted to reducing mortality during hot days. 
Implementation evaluation studies are a 
necessary complement to studies such as ours 
in producing a complete portrait of the effec-
tiveness of a complex program such as a HAP.
Evidence of the effectiveness of HAPs is 
timely because the implementation of such 
programs has increased significantly across 
the world in recent years. Here, we provide 
evidence that a local program and a quasi-
experimental methodology can help facilitate 
similar evaluations in other contexts.
