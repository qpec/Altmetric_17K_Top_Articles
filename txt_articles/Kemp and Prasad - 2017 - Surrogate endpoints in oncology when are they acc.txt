Surrogate endpoints in oncology: when are
they acceptable for regulatory and clinical
decisions, and are they currently overused?
Robert Kemp1 and Vinay Prasad2,3,4*
Abstract
Background: Surrogate outcomes are not intrinsically beneficial to patients, but are designed to be easier and
faster to measure than clinically meaningful outcomes. The use of surrogates as an endpoint in clinical trials and
basis for regulatory approval is common, and frequently exceeds the guidance given by regulatory bodies.
Discussion: In this article, we demonstrate that the use of surrogates in oncology is widespread and increasing.
At the same time, the strength of association between the surrogates used and clinically meaningful outcomes
is often unknown or weak. Attempts to validate surrogates are rarely undertaken. When this is done, validation
relies on only a fraction of available data, and often concludes that the surrogate is poor. Post-marketing studies,
designed to ensure drugs have meaningful benefits, are often not performed. Alternatively, if a drug fails to
improve quality of life or overall survival, market authorization is rarely revoked.
We suggest this reliance on surrogates, and the imprecision surrounding their acceptable use, means that
numerous drugs are now approved based on small yet statistically significant increases in surrogates of
questionable reliability. In turn, this means the benefits of many approved drugs are uncertain. This is an
unacceptable situation for patients and professionals, as prior experience has shown that such uncertainty
can be associated with significant harm.
Conclusion: The use of surrogate outcomes should be limited to situations where a surrogate has demonstrated
robust ability to predict meaningful benefits, or where cases are dire, rare or with few treatment options. In both
cases, surrogates must be used only when continuing studies examining hard endpoints have been fully recruited.

Background
The ultimate goal of all oncology drugs is to improve
patient-centered endpoints. These ‘hard’ endpoints, which
are intrinsically valuable to patients, are increased overall
survival (OS), improved quality of life (QoL), or both.
However, many drugs are approved or used based solely
on their ability to improve surrogate endpoints; outcomes
that are not inherently meaningful, but aim to predict
hard outcomes.
In oncology, the most commonly used surrogates are
response rate; a set of criteria characterizing tumor shrink-
age; and time to event endpoints, such as progression-free
survival (PFS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS). PFS and
RFS are composite endpoints where an event is defined as
either growth of tumor beyond an arbitrary threshold
(progression) or detectable recurrence of disease, or death.
While there is debate as to whether PFS is intrinsically
meaningful [1], since patients do not feel when they cross
the arbitrary threshold of ‘progression,
’ we believe that
PFS is, strictly speaking, a surrogate.
In this opinion article, we defend the position that
surrogate endpoints can and should be used for regula-
tory or clinical practice decision-making in specific cir-
cumstances, but that in current practice, they are used far
beyond what is justifiable. The proper use of surrogates

 should be confined to situations where robust valid-
ation studies demonstrate a reliable ability for a change
in a specific surrogate to predict changes in meaningful
outcomes. Such validation studies are inherently limited
to the specific tumor type, setting (adjuvant/metastatic),
line of therapy, types of agents (cytotoxic versus tar-
geted drugs), and specific surrogate–outcome pairings.
For example, we can consider whether cytotoxic drugs
that improve PFS in first-line metastatic colorectal can-
cer also improve OS. Data supporting such correlations
must be judged on the comprehensiveness and com-
pleteness of included studies. Surrogates that are not
validated may also be used in conditions that are rare,
dire, and with few treatment options. In both cases,
given the hard lessons of recent oncology history, we
request that surrogates are used only after continuing
studies measuring hard endpoints have been fully re-
cruited. Our conclusion is based on several factors.
Surrogate use is widespread
Between 2009 and 2014, the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) approved drugs for 83 oncology indications:
55 (66%) were approved on the basis of surrogate out-
comes, with 31 approved on the basis of response rate,
and 24 on the basis of PFS [2]. One hundred percent (25)
of accelerated and 51% (30) of traditional approvals were
based on treatment effects with surrogate outcomes [2].
Unlike accelerated approval, traditional approvals do not
entail further post-marketing commitments for efficacy,
and several drugs that have failed to demonstrate any sur-
vival gain remain on the market.
Surrogate use is increasing
The use of surrogates is becoming more common as the
primary endpoint of oncology randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). Overviews of oncology RCTs between
1995 and 2009 show that between 1995 and 2004, OS
was the primary endpoint in 49% of trials, but by 2005
to 2009 it had declined to 36%. Response rate declined
by 14% to 6%, but time-to-event endpoints such as PFS
more than made up the ground, rising from 26% to 43%
of primary outcomes [3].
When used, the strength of surrogates is often unknown
or weak
Despite tremendous advances in genomic and imaging
sciences, there is still no perfect surrogate that invariably
predicts the endpoint of interest. Thus, all surrogates are
judged by their ability to predict changes in hard
endpoints.
Several methods have been developed to assess the pre-
dictive value of a surrogate. However, the method most
suited for regulatory approval is trial-level surrogate valid-
ation [4]. Trial-level validation occurs by plotting a change
in the surrogate against the change in the hard endpoint
across several randomized studies. Each trial serves as one
data point. A linear regression analysis is then performed
to see if a correlation exists between a change in the sur-
rogate and change in hard endpoint, and to measure the
strength of the correlation, quantified by the R2
trial statistic.
Trial-level validation requires a meta-analysis of all trials
that have measured the effect of an intervention on both
the surrogate and the hard outcome.
Regulatory authorities have typically required verifica-
tion of a predictive level, both at the individual and trial
level. The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in
Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit
im Gesundheitswesen, IQWIG) provides guidelines for
interpreting the R2
trial value (Table 1), indicating cut-offs
where surrogates are deemed suitable for regulatory use.
These values are arbitrary, yet they provide a useful
heuristic.
IQWIG defines that a surrogate has a proven lack of
validity if the upper bound of the R-value’s 95% confidence
interval is ≤ 0.7 [5]. Although an R-value of 0.7 might
seem impressive, the corresponding R2 is 0.49, meaning
that only 49% of the variation in survival is explained by
variation in the surrogate. IQWIG considers that surro-
gates only have proven validity when the association dem-
onstrates an R-value with a lower bound of the 95%
confidence interval ≥ 0.85 [5]. One well-validated surro-
gate is disease-free survival (DFS) as a predictor of OS in
adjuvant colon cancer. This surrogate was validated by
examining 15 adjuvant RCTs. Plotting the hazard ratios
for DFS and OS gave an R2
trial value of 0.9, suggesting that
DFS was a faithful predictor for OS effects [6].
However, the reality is that many surrogates used in
clinical practice do not meet this mark. In a systematic
review of studies that attempt to validate surrogate
outcomes, 65 specific surrogate survival pairs were
identified. Of these, 52% (34) were classified as low
strength (R ≤ 0.7), 25% (16) as medium strength, and
only 23% (15) correlated highly (R ≥ 0.85) with OS [7].
This systematic review used an even more permissive
classification than IQWIG guidance, as the point esti-
mate of the R2
trial statistic, not the bounds of the 95%
confidence interval, was used to classify the correlations
as low, medium or high.

 Not only are most surrogates in oncology poor predic-
tors of survival, those used for regulatory purposes also
have a weak evidence base. Of 55 regulatory approvals
made by the FDA on the basis of improvements in surro-
gates between 2009 and 2014, 65% (36) had no trial-level
validation studies. Of the 35% (18) that were studied, only
16% (3) correlated highly with survival [2].
The FDA grants drugs traditional or accelerated
approval. Accelerated approval can be given based on a
surrogate benefit that is ‘reasonably likely to predict’ true
clinical efficacy in survival or QoL. Traditional approvals
are granted when a drug demonstrates benefit in ‘estab-
lished’ surrogate endpoints. However, of 25 drugs ap-
proved through the accelerated pathway, 84% (21/25) had
no trial-level validation studies at all. Where validation
studies were performed, correlations were demonstrated
in only 14% (4/25), with R-values ≤ 0.7. Of all traditional
approvals based on a surrogate, only 10% (3/30) were ap-
proved on the basis of a surrogate that had a correlation
with an R-value ≥ 0.85. Of the remaining 90% (27/30) of
drugs, 50% (15/30) had no trial-level validation studies,
27% (8/30) were approved on the basis of a surrogate with
an association with an R-value ≤ 0.7, and 13% (4/30) with
an association with an R-value between 0.7 and 0.85 [2].
While the R2 cut-offs used here are arbitrary, it is
notable that for most approvals, no R2 can be calcu-
lated because no validation study has ever been done.
Nevertheless, an alternative approach to validate surro-
gates is the use of the surrogate threshold effect, where
some numerical gain in the surrogate is shown to be
strongly predictive of some improvement in survival
[8]. For instance, PFS may not be an ideal predictor of
OS, but perhaps a PFS gain of greater than 5 months or
50% is reliable. These studies, however, are plagued by
multiplicity. Since, a priori, we do not know what
amount of PFS gain will be predictive, many values are
explored until one, by chance alone, yields a strong
correlation.
All surrogate–survival association studies are based on a
fragment of the evidence
Like all systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding
medical interventions, trial-level meta-analysis for surro-
gate validation should be based on an exhaustive summary
of the literature relevant to the surrogate.
However, examination of trial-level meta-analyses re-
veals that most are based on a fragment of the evidence.
Only 5/36 (14%) attempted an exhaustive literature search
including published articles, abstracts, and an attempt to
gain unpublished reports [7]. In those five cases, 684 trials
contained data relevant to validation of the surrogate out-
come, but information was available and extracted in only
51.5% of cases (352 trials). The lack of available data can
bias any attempt to validate surrogate outcomes, because
data that is easily located and included in surrogate valid-
ation may have different correlations than unavailable or
unreported data. It is partly for this reason that we believe
surrogates should only be used when confirmatory studies
are ongoing, even when the correlation with outcomes re-
mains strong. To date, no example of a surrogate valid-
ation study based on all of the relevant evidence exists.
The FDA continues to attempt to validate surrogates
based solely on data submitted to the agency [9], leaving
open the question of whether the correlation is similar for
unavailable data.
Common justifications and benefits for using surrogates
may be doubted
Surrogates are used because they are designed to be easier
and quicker to measure than the hard endpoints they pre-
dict. This ostensibly enables trials to be conducted quickly,
at a reduced cost, and to speed up the drug approval
process. The industry has frequently criticized regulatory
bodies for being too slow to grant approvals, and in-
creased acceptance of surrogate outcomes has been pro-
posed to remedy this [10].
However, the use of surrogates as a means to speed up
drug approval is uncertain, and may lead to unintended
consequences. To use validated surrogates, many trials
must first be conducted on a question to validate that
surrogate. Practically, this takes time, diminishing the
purported benefit of using the surrogate. Second, the
availability of surrogates has likely led manufacturers to
alter the way in which they test newer agents, and in
which populations they are tested, thus trading-off speed
of approval for a larger initial market share and under-
mining the value of the surrogate.
Consider this scenario: traditionally, newer agents
were tested in populations with more advanced disease
states, e.g. relapsed and refractory cancers. These popu-
lations were increasingly likely (per unit of time) to ex-
perience the event of interest, typically death, and thus
the trial duration was relatively short. Subsequent trials
would then seek to confirm activity in earlier disease
states where the event rate was lower, and thus trial
duration was longer [11]. As surrogates become widely
accepted by regulatory agencies, manufacturers have
two options:
(1)To conduct a trial in the same late-stage population
using surrogates. In this scenario, the surrogate
event will occur more quickly, meaning the trial can
be conducted more quickly, and thus approval can
be faster, as was claimed by many observers.
(2)To conduct a trial using the surrogate but in an
earlier disease state. In this scenario, the surrogate
event rate may be comparable to the hard event rate
Kemp and Prasad BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:134 
Page 3 of 7
 in the late-stage population. This means the time to
complete both study and approval is comparable.
However, the earlier disease state represents a
greater proportion of the market share, so the use
of surrogates to speed up drug approval is traded off
for grabbing a larger initial market share (Table 2).
There
are
suggestions
that
this
precise
scenario
occurred when comparing the initial approval of TDM-1
and pertuzumab, drugs tested in metastatic breast can-
cer that target HER2. TDM-1 – tested in the traditional
manner, in the second-line setting – was approved based
on an OS benefit. Between enrollment and analysis at a
pre-specified cut-off time, this took 44 months to be-
come evident [12]. In contrast, pertuzumab was initially
tested in the front-line setting with a primary outcome
of PFS, and took 40 months between enrollment and
analysis [13]. This suggests that the time taken to con-
duct the studies and approve the drugs was comparable,
but the initial market share for first-line therapy is cer-
tainly larger. This means that the use of surrogates may
be changing the way companies seek drug approval. As
companies trade off speed for market share, the role of
surrogates as speeding up the process may in fact slow it
down or at least maintain the current pace.
‘Unmet medical need’ is an overused and imprecise term
The term ‘unmet medical need’ allows the FDA to utilize
accelerated approval (i.e. approval based on a surrogate)
and other expedited pathways [14–17], and the FDA
guidance on the term is imprecise. Recently, empirical
analysis of the term in the biomedical literature suggests
that it is being overused. Lu et al. found 237 cancer indi-
cations were described as ‘unmet medical need’ [18]. In
55/237 (23%) cases, ‘unmet need’ referred to indications
with an annual incidence > 1000 cases, with ≥ 5 National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended
regimes and a 50% greater than 5-year survival. Forty-
three mentions (18%) referred to indications with an an-
nual incidence > 10 000, 10 recommended regimes, and
a 5-year survival rate of more than 50%. These results
highlight that there is little professional consensus about
unmet need. Thus, the use of surrogates through path-
ways such as accelerated approval, is likely far greater
than conditions with true unmet needs.
We have been wrong before
Recent studies have challenged the assumption that fre-
quently used surrogates can accurately predict the effect
of treatments on hard outcomes [7].
In 2008, bevacizumab was approved in combination
with paclitaxel for metastatic HER2-negative breast can-
cer on the basis it improved PFS by 5.9 months [19].
However, subsequent confirmation studies demonstrated
no benefit in OS or QoL, and found substantially in-
creased toxicity [20]. As a result, market authorization
was withdrawn in 2011.
Similar findings have been seen when pathological
complete response (pathCR) is used as a surrogate out-
come for OS. In a trial-level meta-analysis of 12 inter-
national trials, little association was found between
frequency of pathCR and OS (R2 = 0.24) [21].
However, despite this weak association, pertuzumab was
approved in the neoadjuvant setting on the basis of pathCR
rates achieved in an RCT. The adjuvant trial of pertuzumab
has now been reported, and showed a miniscule improve-
ment in invasive disease-free survival –another surrogate –
and no difference in OS [22]. At the same time, the drug is
associated with increased cardiotoxicity. For this reason, ex-
perts have been critical of the use of pertuzumab in this set-
ting [23], and pathCR may be considered a failed surrogate.
These examples emphasize that poorly validated surro-
gate outcomes can be misleading with regards to benefit.
Premature regulatory decisions can result in patients be-
ing exposed to considerable harm for no benefit.
We do a poor job of postmarketing follow up
Even uncertain surrogates may not be problematic if post-
marketing studies of drugs approved on the basis of

 surrogate endpoints subsequently and reliably demon-
strated benefits in meaningful outcomes. However, for
most approvals this is not the case. Between 2004 and
2008, 36 oncology drugs were approved on the basis of a
surrogate outcome [24]. With a median follow up of
4.4 years, 18 (50%) failed to improve OS in subsequent tri-
als, 13 (36%) drugs continued to have unknown survival
effects, and only 5 (14%) demonstrated an improvement
in OS in an RCT [24].
It is often argued that treatments that fail to im-
prove OS but do improve surrogate outcomes may
still have meaningful clinical benefit, either by im-
proving QoL, or being more cost-effective. However,
in many cases there is insufficient evidence to reliably
make such assertions. The 18 drugs approved that
failed to demonstrate a benefit in OS were examined
to see if they improved QoL. Only 1 (5%) demon-
strated improved QoL, 6 made no statistical differ-
ence, 2 were associated with worse QoL, 4 with
mixed results and 5 had no evidence concerning QoL
[25]. This meant that 47% (17/36) of the drugs ap-
proved on the basis of surrogate outcomes, which are
now routinely used in the clinic, have no clear benefit
in either OS or QoL. Only one of these drugs has
had its marketing authorization removed.
There are two major reasons why surrogates may fall
short
Surrogates may fall short in their ability to predict out-
comes in hard endpoints for two broad categories of rea-
sons: (1) technical factors in measuring the surrogate
introduce such uncertainty that their association with
the hard endpoints becomes weak; and (2) something
about the relationship between the surrogate, hard end-
point and drug weakens a direct causal link between the
surrogate and the hard endpoint.
In some cases, measuring surrogate endpoints can be
more complex than measuring hard endpoints. Factors
such as measurement error, evaluation bias, attrition bias
or informative censoring may weaken the association
between the surrogate and hard end point such that its
predictive value is lost.
The BOLERO-2 study, which examined the efficacy
of everolimus in hormone receptor-positive advanced
breast cancer, demonstrated an improvement in PFS
by 6.5 months [26], but failed to demonstrate any im-
provement in OS [27]. Informative censoring may
have occurred more frequently in the treatment arm
than in the control arm. Informative censoring means
that the probability a person was censored is related
to the probability of experiencing the outcome. Spe-
cifically, if censoring occurs more often in patients
who experience early toxicity, and if the presence of tox-
icity is more likely to be experienced by patients with
limited physiologic reserve or more aggressive cancer biol-
ogy, then censoring these patients may lead to a false over-
estimation of the Kaplan–Meier curve, as the sickest
patients are removed. If informative censoring is differen-
tial (occurs more often in the treatment than in the con-
trol group), then the efficacy of the intervention may be
falsely inferred. Informative censoring fundamentally vio-
lates the Kaplan–Meier assumption. Both informative and
differential censoring may have occurred in BOLERO-2,
as everolimus has marked toxicity and high rates of dose
reduction. Some patients censored initially on this arm
were almost surely censored for toxicity. In an independ-
ent analysis, we have shown that the PFS benefit in
BOLERO-2 can vanish if one alters the assumptions
around censoring [28].
Even if a surrogate is perfectly measured it may not
be able to predict hard endpoints if there is something
in the relationship between the surrogate, drug and
hard endpoint that undermines the drug’s benefit; for
example, the surrogate may not have a causal role in
the hard endpoint. This may arise if, for instance,
pathCR does not relate to OS because of micrometa-
static disease outside the resection areas responsible for
OS, which are not measured by the surrogate. Alterna-
tively, this might arise if an intervention has offsite tar-
get effects that are independent of the disease process.
This can affect the hard endpoint, or whether post-
protocol disease growth is accelerated, as well as other
possibilities.
Where do we go from here?
Many of the commonly used surrogates have known
the problems described above. However, improved
standardization may permit novel surrogates to be
identified that have the potential for greater predictive
power [29].
Retrospective analysis of castration-resistant prostate
cancer trials allowed a growth constant, g, to be defined
based on prostate-specific antigen-level dynamics [30].
In clinical trials, g was associated with patient survival
between arms and could predict a benefit in survival (at
80% power) with only 50 people per arm.
Robust surrogate outcomes have the potential to re-
duce the clinical, economic and time burden associated
with RCTs and drug development. However, this benefit
is only achieved if the surrogate is thoroughly validated
in establishing true surrogacy for meaningful outcomes,
and if the industry does not use the surrogate to justify a
longer study to seek a broader market share. Moreover,
validation of both existing and novel surrogates may
take years, undermining the speed of surrogates. Failure
to validate surrogates may lead to harmful drugs enter-
ing and persisting on the market.

 Conclusions
The factors outlined here lead us to conclude that sur-
rogates should lead to practice change or drug approval
only when robust validation studies demonstrate that a
change in a specific surrogate has a reliable ability to
predict changes in meaningful outcomes. Here we favor
strong correlations in line with the IQWIG thresholds.
Alternatively, surrogates may also be used when not
validated in conditions that are rare, dire, and with few
treatment options. In both cases, surrogates should be
used after studies measuring hard endpoints have been
fully recruited, and are ongoing. We believe this stand-
ard balances the benefits of surrogates with the import-
ance of strict regulatory standards. Future work should
further explore the unintended consequences of the use
of surrogate endpoints in oncology.
