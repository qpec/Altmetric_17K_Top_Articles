Abstract: Most breast cancer-related deaths from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) occur 
following metastasis of cancer cells and development of tumors at secondary sites. Because 
TNBCs lack the three receptors targeted by current chemotherapeutic regimens, they are 
typically treated with extremely aggressive and highly toxic non-targeted treatment strategies. 
Women with TNBC frequently develop metastatic lesions originating from drug-resistant 
residual cells and have poor prognosis. For this reason, novel therapeutic strategies that are safer 
and more effective are sought. Luteolin (LU) is a naturally occurring, non-toxic plant compound 
that has proven effective against several types of cancer. With this in mind, we conducted in 
vivo and in vitro studies to determine whether LU might suppress metastasis of TNBC. In 
an in vivo mouse metastasis model, LU suppressed metastasis of human MDA-MB-435 and 
MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 TNBC cells to the lungs. In in vitro assays, LU inhibited cell 
migration and viability of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Further, LU 
induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Relatively low levels (10 µM) of LU 
significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2 cells, suggesting that it has the ability to suppress a potent angiogenic and cell 
survival factor. In addition, migration of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells was inhibited upon 
exposure to an antibody against the VEGF receptor, KDR, but not by exposure to a VEGF165 
antibody. Collectively, these data suggest that the anti-metastatic properties of LU may, in part, 
be due to its ability to block VEGF production and KDR-mediated activity, thereby inhibiting 
tumor cell migration. These studies suggest that LU deserves further investigation as a potential 
treatment option for women with TNBC.

Introduction
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which comprise 15–20% of all tumors of the 
breast, are so named because they fail to express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone 
receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2/neu).1,2 Compared 
with hormone-responsive breast cancers that are stimulated by the protein–ligand 
interactions of ER, PR, and/or HER2, the TNBC phenotype is associated with a signifi-
cantly poorer clinical outcome.1,3,4 Hormone-responsive tumors are commonly treated 
with adjuvant hormone therapies, e.g., tamoxifen, that act as antagonists to disrupt 
normal hormone/receptor binding.5 In comparison, women with TNBC by definition 
do not respond to endocrine therapies and without a reliable prognostic marker rely 
on toxic chemotherapeutic drug combinations.6 TNBC represents a cancer phenotype 
that is difficult to treat, and cancers of this type that escape adjuvant treatment and

surgery generally emerge as particularly aggressive tumors. 
Perou et al7 reported that women with basal-like (specifi-
cally, triple-negative) breast cancers have an increased risk 
of tumor recurrence compared with women with other cancer 
subtypes. TNBC frequently metastasizes to the viscera (i.e., 
lung, brain, and liver) and, to a lesser extent, bone8–11; in addi-
tion, the rate of cancer recurrence 3–5 years post-therapy is 
greater in women with TNBC than in their non-triple-negative 
counterparts.10,11 For these reasons, new therapeutic options 
for TNBC that are less toxic and more effective are needed.
The increased virulence of basal-like breast cancers, 
which represent ~80% of all triple-negative tumors,12 may 
be attributed to increased vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) secretion. VEGF is a major angiogenic factor and 
promotes tumor growth and metastasis,13–16 resulting in higher 
morbidity.17–20 For this reason, VEGF-stimulated migratory 
and proliferative pathways provide capable adjunctive che-
motherapeutic options. Previous reports have established 
that VEGF, specifically VEGF165, increases migration and 
invasion potential of T47-D human breast cancer cells.21,22 
More recently, our laboratory has shown that VEGF induces 
mitogenic effects and also acts as a survival factor in TNBC 
MDA-MB-231 cells mediated through the interaction of 
VEGF165 and its receptor KDR.23 These reports suggest that 
indirectly blocking VEGF-induced migration and prolifera-
tion may decrease the metastatic potential of TNBC cells 
and potentially also destroy established metastatic lesions.
In this report, we describe studies aimed at identifying 
naturally occurring compounds with low toxicity that might 
be used chemotherapeutically to both treat and prevent the 
metastasis of TNBC cells. We previously reported on the 
ability of luteolin (LU; 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihy-
droxy-4-chromenone), a non-toxic naturally occurring plant 
flavonoid, to block progestin-driven VEGF expression and to 
suppress in vivo tumor progression in two different progestin-
associated breast cancer animal models.24,25 Because few 
clinically accepted standardized chemotherapeutic options 
to combat metastatic TNBC are available, we tested LU for 
its ability to disrupt the growth and migration of TNBC cells, 
as well as to prevent their metastasis. Our findings show that 
LU effectively suppresses the viability of TNBC cells and 
blocks their metastasis to the lungs.
Materials and methods
Reagents
LU (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4H-1-benzo-
pyran-4-one) was purchased from Tocris (Cat # 2874; Min-
neapolis, MN, USA) and dissolved in sterile-filtered dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO; Cat # D2650; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, 
MO, USA). Solutions of LU were prepared weekly, aliquoted 
for daily use, and stored at −20°C until use. Final DMSO con-
centration was 0.1% in LU- and vehicle-treated cells. Pierce 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein reagents were obtained from 
Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). hVEGF165 (AF293NA) 
and human VEGF receptor (hKDR; AF357) antibodies were 
purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Cell lines and culture
The MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 breast cancer cell line is a 
metastatic subpopulation isolated from TNBC MDA-MB-231 
cells8 and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) at 37°C/5% 
CO2. TNBC MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained from ATCC 
(Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained at 37°C in phenol 
red-free DMEM/F12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS.26 Cells 
were harvested with 0.05% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraace-
tic acid (EDTA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For all in vitro 
experiments, cells were allowed to reach 50–60% confluence, 
washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and maintained 
in DMEM/F12 or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 
24 hours prior to treatment. Incubations were carried out in 
the presence of LU at the various concentrations described 
later in a medium containing 5% FBS. Control represents 
cells treated with vehicle alone.
Cell viability assay
Viable cells were quantitated using the previously described 
sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay,27 a cell protein dye-binding 
assay. In brief, 1–1.5 × 104 cells in 100 µL 5% FBS DMEM/
F12 medium or DMEM were seeded on a 96-well plate and 
incubated at 37°C overnight in 5% CO2. Cells were subse-
quently treated for 24 or 48 hours with the indicated con-
centrations of LU. Treatments were performed in sextuplet. 
Each experiment was repeated at least twice.
Cell migration assay
Viable MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells 
were counted and plated (4 × 104 cells/well) on an Oris Pro 
Cell Migration Assay 96-well tissue culture-treated plate 
(Cat # PROCMA1; Platypus Technologies, Fitchburg, WI, 
USA) containing a bead of biocompatible gel. The plates 
were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to allow the gel to dis-
solve, leaving a circular zone of detection. Two hours later, 
once the cells were properly adhered to the plates, they were 
treated with LU and/or hVEGF165 or hKDR antibodies (or

DMSO; vehicle) for 48 hours. Images were taken at 0-, 
24-, and 48-hour intervals on an EVOS XL Cell Imaging 
System (Thermo Fisher  
Scientific,) utilizing a 4× objective. 
Migration was analyzed by determining the difference in the 
area of the detection zone between pre-migration (0 hour) 
and subsequent time points (closure), using the lasso and 
measurement tools in Adobe Photoshop CS 5.5 (San Jose, 
CA, USA) on an inductive pen-enabled Wacom touch screen. 
Inter-well coefficients of variability given by the manufac-
turer for the detection zone created by the biocompatible 
gel were ≤12%.
Apoptosis assay
LU-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells 
was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 
analysis using the Annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) binding assay (Cat # 
K101-100; BioVision, San Francisco, CA, USA). Cells were 
grown to 50–60% confluence, washed twice, and treated 
with varying concentrations of LU in 5% FBS/DMEM for 
an additional 24 hours. Final concentration of DMSO was 
0.1% in the medium with 5% FBS. Cells were harvested 
using Accutase and stained for FACS analysis as per the 
manufacturer’s protocol.
VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA)
The Quantikine human VEGF ELISA kit (Cat # DVE00) 
was purchased from R&D Systems. MDA-MB-231 (4175) 
LM2 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence, washed twice, 
treated with vehicle or LU at the indicated concentrations, 
and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. Supernatant from each 
sample was collected, and VEGF concentrations were mea-
sured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and each 
sample was analyzed in duplicate on a microplate reader. 
Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variance given by the 
manufacturer for the cell culture supernatant assay were 
5–8.5% and 3.5–6.5%, respectively.
BCA protein assay
MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells were washed twice with 
PBS, then harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in 300 µL 
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% 
Nonidet P-40). Protein concentration was determined using 
a microplate reader to measure absorbance at 562 nm with a 
bovine serum albumin standard (Cat # 23209; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and 
samples were analyzed in duplicate.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT
-PCR)
MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells were grown to 60% conflu-
ence and treated with 10, 25, or 50 µM LU for 6 hours, after 
which total messenger RNA (mRNA) was collected using 
the phenol-based extraction method (RNAzol RT; Molecular 
Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA), as per the manu-
facturer’s recommendations. Total mRNA was converted 
to complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplified using the 
Invitrogen SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Cat # 
12574-026) with the following primers:
VEGF
F 5′ - CTG TCT TGG GTG CAT TGG
R 5′ - CAC CGC CTC GGC TTG TCA CAT
GAPDH
F 5′ - ATG AGA AGT ATG ACA GCC
R 5′- TGA GTC CTT CCA CGA TAC C
PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels for 1.5 hours 
at 100 V and quantified using a Bio-Rad Laboratories imager 
and software (Hercules, CA, USA). Relative VEGF band 
intensity was determined by normalization to GAPDH signals.
TNBC lung metastasis xenograft model
All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and 
Use Committee at the University of Missouri, Columbia, 
MO, USA, and the study adhered to the guidelines of the 
US Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of 
Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training. 
Female athymic nu/nu nude mice, 6 weeks old (18–22 g), 
were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc (Indianapo-
lis, IN, USA). Mice were housed in a laminar airflow cabinet 
under specific pathogen-free conditions. All facilities were 
approved by the American Association for Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care in accordance with current US fed-
eral regulations and standards. TNBC cells were harvested by 
trypsinization and washed twice with DMEM/F12 medium 
or DMEM. Cell pellets were then suspended in medium and 
injected intravenously (iv) into the tail vein. MDA-MB-435 
and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cell lines were injected at 
2.2 × 106 and 2.0 × 105 cells per 150 µL medium without FBS, 
respectively (Figure 1). Intraperitoneal (ip) injections of LU 
began on the fifth day post-inoculation and continued every 
other day until the end of the study, though the MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2-inoculated mice received a daily loading dose of 
LU for the first week. Mice inoculated with MDA-MB-435 
cells were given ip injections of 10 or 20 mg/kg LU; those 
inoculated with MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells received

a higher LU dose of 40 mg/kg due to the highly aggressive 
nature of the MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 TNBC cell line. 
Control animals were injected with the same volume of 
vehicle (70% DMSO/30% PBS). Animals were weighed 
every 2–4 days throughout the study. Lungs were harvested 
following sacrifice of animals on Days 51 and 42 for mice 
inoculated with MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) 
LM2 cells, respectively. Lungs were collected and fixed in 
Bouin’s Fixative Solution (Cat # 1120-32; Ricca Chemical 
Company, Arlington, TX, USA), as per the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Superficial lung colonies were counted 
using a stereoscopic dissection microscope, and the results 
from two independent researchers were averaged and then 
statistically analyzed using SigmaPlot software, version 12.5 
(San Jose, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was tested using t-test or one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Newman–Keuls 
multiple comparison test to determine the difference in mean 
between groups. If normality failed, the data were tested using 
a nonparametric one-way ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal–Wallis), 
followed by the Newman–Keuls nonparametric multiple com-
parison test or Dunn’
s method in the presence of an uneven n. 
The Student’
s t-test was used to report the difference between 
two group mean; when normality failed, the Mann–Whitney 
rank sum test was used. Animal weight comparisons were ana-
lyzed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Data were 
reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For all 
comparisons, P ≤ 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant, 
and analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12.5 software.
Results
LU inhibits metastasis of human TNBC 
cells in mouse models
To determine the effectiveness of LU as an anti-metastatic 
compound that might be used to combat breast cancer, 
we utilized a xenograft metastasis model that mimics sec-
ondary-site colonization (Figure 1). Mice were inoculated 
with MDA-MB-435 cells. A dose of 20 mg/kg LU signifi-
cantly reduced the number of MDA-MB-435-derived lung 
colonies to 5.3 ± 0.5, compared with 14.1 ± 1.6 superficial 
lung colonies formed in vehicle-treated control animals. 
The lower dose of 10 mg/kg LU reduced the mean num-
ber of metastatic colonies (8.4 ± 0.9), though this did not 
reach significance (Figure 2A). No significant difference 
in animal weights was observed between vehicle-treated 
control animals and animals receiving LU throughout the 
study (Figure 2B).
Since LU reduced metastasis in the MDA-MB-435 
model, we sought to determine whether this effect was cell 
specific by inoculating mice with a particularly aggressive 
TNBC cell line (4175 LM2) that is an MDA-MB-231 vari-
ant with a molecular signature specific to lung metastasis.8 
Based on the observations by Minn et al,28 we reduced the 
number of cells used for inoculation by 10-fold and increased 
the LU dosage to one approaching the maximum reported 
in the literature. Inoculation with MDA-MB-231 (4175) 
LM2 cells increased the mean number of lung colonies in 
control animals by approximately 5-fold compared with 
MDA-MB-435 cells (67.6 ± 27.1 colonies vs 14.1 ± 1.6 
colonies, respectively), a finding that was highly significant 
(Mann–Whitney rank sum test, P < 0.001). Administration

LU suppresses metastasis of TNBC cells
of LU (40 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of lung 
colonies formed by MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells to 
22.8 ± 3.6 (Figure 2C). As in the MDA-MB-435 study, LU 
had no significant effect on animal weights (Figure 2D).
LU inhibits in vitro TNBC cell migration
Using MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells, 
we examined the effects of LU on cell migration. Cells were 
grown to 50–60% confluence, harvested, and seeded into 
96-well migration assay plates and then subjected to migra-
tion assays in the presence or absence of LU. When MDA-435 
cells were exposed to very low doses of LU for either 24 or 
48 hours, their migration capacity (represented by % closure 
values) was reduced (Figure 3A). After 24 hours, 5 µM LU 
significantly suppressed migration compared with controls 
(40.5 ± 4.7 vs 13.2 ± 6.8% closure). Treatment of cells for 
48 hours with a higher (10 µM) concentration of LU resulted 
in a significant reduction in migration (54.2 ± 5.8 vs 15.9 
± 5.5% closure). At both time points, migration was further 
suppressed in a dose-dependent manner; a concentration of 
50 µM LU completely abolished the migration of MDA-
MB-435 cells.
Low doses of LU also significantly reduced the migration 
of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells following 24 hours of 
exposure (Figure 3B). After 48 hours of exposure to 5 µM 
LU, MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells overcame the inhibi-
tory effects of the flavonoid and exhibited similar migration 
behavior as MDA-MB-435 cells. However, as concentrations 
of LU increased from 10 to 50 µM, there was a dose-depen-
dent reduction in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cell migration. 
Interestingly, we observed no significant difference in % 
closures following exposure of cells to 50 µM LU for 24 
and 48 hours (42.6 ± 2.25 vs 46.5 ± 1.8% closure; Student’s 
t-test, P = 0.189). This suggests that at high dosage (50 µM), 
the effects of LU on MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 migration 
are maximized after 24 hours.

LU reduces 
VEGF secretion in TNBC 
cells
It is well established that the potent angiogenic factor VEGF165 
increases the migration and invasion potential of human breast 
cancer cells22 and that VEGF has mitogenic effects in MDA-
MB-231 cells that are mediated through the interaction of 
VEGFA and its receptor, KDR.23 Given these previous findings 
and our data showing aggressive metastasis of MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2 cells to lungs in xenograft models, we sought to 
determine whether LU suppresses VEGF production in these 
cells. MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells were treated with 
10, 50, or 100 µM LU or DMSO for 16 hours, after which 
VEGF levels were measured in the supernatant using a Quan-
tikine human VEGF ELISA kit, which predominantly binds 
VEGF165. LU concentrations of 10 and 50 µM significantly 
reduced levels of secreted VEGF (Figure 4A). VEGF secretion 
was further reduced when cells were exposed to 100 µM LU.
LU does not reduce 
VEGF mRNA 
production by MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 
cells
In order to gain insight into the mechanism through which 
LU suppresses VEGF secretion by MDA-MB-231 (4175)

LU suppresses metastasis of TNBC cells
(4175) LM2 cells were treated with 10, 25, or 50 µM LU for 
6 hours, after which total mRNA was collected, and VEGF 
mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. LU had no effect 
on total VEGF mRNA levels (Figure 4B), suggesting that it 
suppresses VEGF secretion post-transcriptionally.
Blocking 
VEGF receptor-2 but 
not VEGF165 inhibits migration of 
MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells in the 
presence or absence of LU
VEGF increases the migration and invasion potential of 
human breast cancer cells.22 We found that 10 µM LU sup-
presses both VEGF secretion (Figure 4A) and cell migration 
(Figure 3B) in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Based on 
this finding, we used an antibody to inhibit human VEGF165 
and ascertained the effect of such treatment on the migration 
of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Migration assays of 
cells treated with 10 µM LU ± VEGF165 antibody (0.5 µg/mL) 
demonstrated that migration was not inhibited by the VEGF165 
antibody (data not shown). VEGF165 actions are potentiated 
through the VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), which is stimulated by 
VEGF isoforms.23 Therefore, we incubated MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2 cells with a human KDR antibody to determine 
how the receptor is involved in their migration. After 24 and 
48 hours, cell migration was inhibited by the KDR antibody 
and by 10 µM LU (Figure 5). Treating cells with a combina-
tion of LU and KDR antibody did not inhibit migration in an 
additive or a synergistic manner. Taken together, these results 
suggest that LU may act on KDR or its downstream effectors 
to inhibit MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cell migration.
LU reduces viability of TNBC cells
We assessed the effect on cell viability of exposing MDA-
MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells to varying 
concentrations of LU (0–100 µM) for 24 or 48 hours. The 
viability of MDA-MB-435 cells was markedly reduced by 
LU in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 6A).

Following exposure of MDA-MB-435 cells for 24 hours, the 
IC50 value for LU was between 50 and 75 µM, with minimal 
or no effect observed at 10 µM. After 48 hours of exposure, 
the IC50 value fell to ~25 µM. However, MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2 cells were less sensitive to LU; following 
24 hours of exposure, the flavonoid had minimal effect until 
concentrations exceeded 10 µM (Figure 6B). In addition, 
after 48 hours of exposure to LU, the IC50 was ~50 µM. Our 
findings demonstrate that concentrations of LU >10 µM 
significantly reduce the viability of both  
MDA-MB-435 
and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells in a dose- and time-
dependent manner.
LU induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231

Finally, using FACS analysis, we determined whether LU 
induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Cells 
were treated with LU or vehicle for 48 hours, then collected 
and subjected to FACS analysis. We found that concentrations 
of LU as low as 10 µM significantly induced apoptosis and

LU suppresses metastasis of TNBC cells
that the effect was dose-dependent (Figure 7). These studies 
show that LU initiates the process of programmed cell death 
in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells even at concentrations 
too low to influence cell viability.
Discussion
Breast cancer is a deadly disease that afflicts millions of 
women worldwide. Almost 20% of the detected tumors are 
of the TNBC type. Because no recognized targeted chemo-
therapeutic approaches exist for TNBC, patients diagnosed 
with this type of tumor have a poor prognosis.1–3,29 Many 
existing treatments for TNBC are highly toxic, and resistant 
tumors often arise and metastasize despite the use of aggres-
sive chemotherapy regimens.6 Given the urgent need for safer 
and more effective treatments for TNBC, we embarked on 
a study of LU, a naturally occurring compound, that might 
be used to block TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. Such 
compounds have the benefit of being either nontoxic or of low 
toxicity and therefore confer significant potential advantages 
over currently used drugs.
This study determined the effectiveness of LU, a naturally 
occurring plant flavonoid, to block growth and metastasis of 
TNBC cells, as well as angiogenesis-associated processes in 
those cells. Angiogenesis is a vital component for both growth 
and metastasis of tumor cells, since new blood vessels facilitate 
the delivery of nutrients to tumors as well as the dissemination 
of cancer cells to distant sites. We previously reported on the 
ability of LU to block progestin-driven tumor formation and 
growth in two different progestin-associated breast cancer 
animal models.24 In this report, we used a  
well-established 
xenograft model of lung metastasis and assessed the ability of 
LU to reduce the metastatic capacity of TNBC cells using two 
different TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-43526 and MDA-MB-231 
(4175) LM2.8 Both of these TNBC cell types are known to 
metastasize to lung, though the latter cell line is particularly 
aggressive8 and gives rise to significantly more tumors of the 
lung per animal, which is a testament to its virulence.
In the present studies, LU significantly inhibited metastasis 
of both MDA-MB-435 and MDA-231 (4175) LM2 TNBC 
cells with no observed toxicity. To our knowledge, it has never 
been reported that LU attenuates the ability of TNBC cells to 
metastasize to the lungs, though it has been suggested in other 
models that inhibition of metastasis by LU may be potentiated 
through suppression of cellular migration and neovasculariza-
tion,30 which are indispensable steps in tumor metastasis.16 Our 
findings that relatively low concentrations of LU significantly 
reduced TNBC cell migration suggest that, at low concentra-
tions, LU has the capacity to lessen colonization of metastatic 
cells at the site of metastasis. Higher concentrations of LU 
abolished migration in a manner that was dependent upon the 
particular cell line. The lesser response seen with the more 
aggressive MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells suggests that 
the ability of LU to interfere with migration is most likely an 
indirect effect, perhaps following LU-mediated suppression 
of VEGF secretion from tumor cells. Locally produced VEGF 
is known to act via VEGF receptors to promote tumor cell 
survival and migration.31–33
VEGF plays an important role in tumor cell migration, 
survival, and proliferation,14,19 and we found here that LU 
inhibited VEGF production, but not VEGF mRNA levels, in 
MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells (which were observed to 
be particularly aggressive in their colonization of lung tissue 
following injection into nude mice). In addition, it has been 
reported that VEGF165 promotes breast cancer cell migration.22 
Consequently, it is reasonable to speculate that suppression 
of VEGF bioavailability by LU is a plausible mechanism 
by which LU may modulate cell migration. We found that 
migration of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells was not 
affected by neutralization of soluble VEGF with an antibody 
against VEGF165, and no significant difference in migration 
was observed between cells exposed to both LU and VEGF165 
antibody and those exposed to LU alone (data not shown). 
The anti-migratory effects of LU may be hampered by an 
inability to block other isoforms of VEGF, such as VEGF121 
or VEGF189, or other angiogenic factors such as neuropilin, 
which continue to activate VEGF receptor-2 (KDR) in the 
absence of VEGF165. However, our VEGF antibody studies 
suggest that it is likely that LU acts downstream of the VEGF 
receptor-2 (KDR) or on the receptor itself. Evidence that LU

suppresses VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF recep-
tor-2, resulting in inhibition of prostate tumor growth,34 sup-
ports this concept. When we used a KDR-specific antibody 
to neutralize VEGFR-2, migration of MDA-MB-231 (4175) 
LM2 cells was significantly inhibited in both the presence and 
absence of LU. Although our results do not directly demon-
strate that LU is inhibiting KDR, the effects of LU on TNBC 
cell migration suggest at least a partial link between KDR 
signal propagation and cell migration capacity. Although LU 
has been demonstrated to have the capacity to inhibit func-
tions of KDR,34 the effect of LU on KDR in breast cancer 
cells needs to be studied in more detail.
Previous reports indicate that VEGF is potently mito-
genic for breast cancer cells and that its actions are medi-
ated through the interaction of VEGF165 and its receptor.23 
Furthermore, it has been reported that 10 µM LU is able 
to block VEGF-induced angiogenesis and proliferation of 
tumor cells through phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) 
inhibition.30 We found that relatively modest concentrations 
of LU (between 10 and 25 µM) effectively inhibited viabil-
ity of TNBC cells in a dose-, time-, and cell line-dependent 
manner. At higher LU concentrations (>10 µM), reduced 
viability of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells appeared to 
be associated with increased apoptosis. However, we found 
that a concentration of LU (10 µM) that did not affect MDA-
MB-231 (4175) LM2 cell viability after 24 hours was able 
to induce apoptosis in these cells after 24 hours, the latter 
of which is in accordance with previous reports in TNBC 
cells.34,35 The discrepancies between these two findings at 
low LU concentrations are likely due to the possibility that 
early effects of LU are not manifested in the SRB cell viabil-
ity assays but can be observed in the more sensitive FACS 
analysis. The precise role of VEGF165 in these processes and 
to what extent its attenuation by LU has on mediating TNBC 
cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis remain unclear.
In addition to the findings reported here, little direct evi-
dence shows that LU inhibits the metastasis of TNBC cells. 
However, in vivo reports have demonstrated potent inhibition 
of both prostate and colorectal cancer cell metastasis by LU. 
Zhou et al36 found that LU (5 mg/kg administered 3 times 
per week ip) upregulated E-cadherin and thereby prevented 
human PC-3 prostate cancer cells from  
spontaneously 
metastasizing to lungs. LU was also shown to suppress Raf 
and PI3K, thereby diminishing mouse CT-26 colorectal 
cancer cell metastasis.37 This latter finding is in agreement 
with Bagli et al30 and Pratheeshkumar et al,34 who reported 
that low concentrations of LU (10–20 µM) acted as both a 
potent PI3K inhibitor and an inhibitor of metalloproteinase 
MMP9. Additional evidence implicates  
downregulation of 
PI3K phosphorylation and MMP9 as being responsible for 
the anti-invasive capacity of LU, perhaps explaining its ability 
to reduce the invasive potential of various cancer cell lines in 
vitro.38–42 Because the VEGF-induced PI3K pathway mediates 
cell survival, migration, and proliferation, we propose that our 
findings that LU inhibits TNBC cell migration support the 
notion that it acts via multiple mechanisms likely potentiated 
through blockade of PI3K phosphorylation and/or MMP-
mediated VEGF signaling. While its precise mechanisms of 
action remain to be determined, we contend that these studies 
support the further investigation of LU as an anti-metastatic 
agent that could be used to combat early-stage, as well as 
late-stage, TNBC, including its metastasis.
