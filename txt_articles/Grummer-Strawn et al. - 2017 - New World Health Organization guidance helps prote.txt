Abstract
Written by the WHO/UNICEF NetCode author group, the comment focuses on the need to pro-
tect families from promotion of breast‐milk substitutes and highlights new WHO Guidance on
Ending Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children. The World Health
Assembly welcomed this Guidance in 2016 and has called on all countries to adopt and imple-
ment the Guidance recommendations. NetCode, the Network for Global Monitoring and Support
for Implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast‐milk Substitutes and Subse-
quent Relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions, is led by the World Health Organization and
the United Nations Children's Fund. NetCode members include the International Baby Food
Action Network, World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, Helen Keller International, Save the
Children, and the WHO Collaborating Center at Metropol University. The comment frames the
issue as a human rights issue for women and children, as articulated by a statement from the
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

INTRODUCTION
A recently published statement by United Nations' experts said
“Breastfeeding is a human rights issue for both the child and the
mother” (United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights, 2016). It declares that children have the right to life, survival,
and development and to the highest attainable standard of health, as
well as to safe and nutritious foods. Breastfeeding must be considered
an integral component of these rights. Breastfeeding is also a rights
issue for women (Galtry, 2015). A mother is not obligated to
breastfeed her child, but no one may interfere with a mother's right
to breastfeed her child (Kent, 2006). Women have the right to accu-
rate, unbiased information needed to make an informed decision about
breastfeeding and the right to an environment that enables them to
carry it out. The importance of breastfeeding is now widely under-
stood. It reduces child mortality, increases child cognition, improves
maternal and child health, and fosters economic development (Victora
et al., 2016).

 The UN statement pointed out that promotion of breast‐milk sub-
stitutes (BMS)1 by manufacturers and lack of corporate accountability
for the adverse consequences of such practices pose a major obstacle
to breastfeeding. The retail value of the infant formula market is enor-
mous and rapidly growing. Estimated at US$44.8 billion in 2014, it is
projected to increase to US$70.6 billion by 2019 (Rollins et al., 2016).
Research shows widespread BMS promotion globally. In Cambodia,
77% of mothers saw BMS ads on television (Pries et al., 2016). In Sen-
egal, 35% of stores selling infant foods had BMS promotions
(Champeny et al., 2016). Half of mothers in Nepal reported receiving
a recommendation from a health worker to give a BMS (Pries et al.,
2016). Reports from the International Baby Food Action Network have
documented
numerous
misleading
nutrition
and
health
claims
attempting to create perceptions that BMS are “close to breast‐milk”
(Yeong, 2016). New studies also show that milks designed for older
children are being heavily promoted, frequently in ways intended to
market the same brand's infant formulas (Pereira et al., 2016). Such
marketing
tactics
provide
a
substantial
barrier
to
improving
breastfeeding and young child feeding practices, and to reducing
under‐five child mortality and ending malnutrition (Baker et al., 2016).
What can we do to safeguard women and children's rights and
protect them from such misleading practices? The 69th World Health
Assembly took an important step toward further protecting women
and children's rights when it adopted a resolution that calls on coun-
tries to implement the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance
on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young
Children (WHO, 2016). This new Guidance was developed in response
to continuous lack of compliance with the International Code of
Marketing of Breast‐milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant WHA
resolutions (the Code) and increasing evidence that the promotion of
BMS and some commercial complementary foods for infants and
young children undermines optimal breastfeeding and young child
feeding (WHO, 2015). Here is what is new about the Guidance:
1. Clarifies that “follow‐up formula” and “growing‐up milks” that are
marketed up to the age of 36 months fall under the scope of the
Code and should not be promoted.
2. States that messages on complementary foods should always
include a statement on the need for breastfeeding to continue
through 2 years and that complementary foods should not be
fed before 6 months.
3. Says that labels and designs on complementary foods need to be
distinct from those used on breast‐milk substitutes to avoid cross‐
promotion.
4. Recognizes that any donations to the health care system (includ-
ing health workers and professional associations) from companies
marketing BMS and foods for infants and young children repre-
sent a conflict of interest and should not be allowed.
5. Emphasizes that sponsorship of meetings of health professionals
and scientific meetings by companies selling BMS and foods for
infants and young children should not be allowed.
The UN rights statement on breastfeeding pointed out that gov-
ernments have an obligation under the Convention on the Rights of
the Child and other relevant UN human rights instruments to respect,
protect, and fulfill children's rights to health and to nutritious foods and
women's rights to be protected from harmful interference by non‐
State actors, particularly the business sector, and to have skilled sup-
port to enable them to breastfeed. Therefore, governments must take
legislative action to fully adopt and implement the Guidance to ensure
that infants and young children get the right nutrition and that mothers
have support and access to accurate information about foods for their
children. Without action, poor infant and young child feeding practices
will continue to compromise maternal and child health and hold chil-
dren, communities, and countries back.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to thank NetCode members for their efforts to ensure
all sectors of society are protected from the inappropriate and uneth-
ical marketing of breast‐milk substitutes and other products covered
by the scope of the International Code and relevant WHA resolutions.

CONTRIBUTIONS
LMG‐S, WHO, lead author: reviewed and provided substantial revisions
on multiple versions, including reframing. EZ, HKI: contributed to
writing the commentary, reviewed every version and made substantive
contributions, authored some papers cited in commentary. MS, WHO:
1“A breast‐milk substitute should be understood to include any milks (or prod-
ucts that could be used to replace milk, such as fortified soy milk), in either liquid
or powdered form that are specifically marketed for feeding infants and young
children up to the age of 3 years (including follow‐up formula and growing‐up
milks)” (WHO, 2016).
Key messages
• Breastfeeding is a human rights issue for both children
and mothers.
• The retail value of the infant formula market is
enormous and rapidly growing.
• Research shows high prevalence of promotion of breast‐
milk substitutes.
• The International Code of Marketing of Breast‐milk
Substitutes prohibits the promotion of breast‐milk
substitutes.
• New Guidance on Ending Inappropriate Promotion of
Foods for Infants and Young Children welcomed by the
World Health Assembly in 2016 builds on the Code and
includes technical guidance and recommendations on
how
countries
can
strengthen
their
policies
and
programmes to protect mothers of children under
3 years of age from promotion of breast‐milk substitutes.
