 of adult cigarette smokers from the general population beginning September 2014 through August 
2015. Of 2149 smokers who enrolled, 88% completed the trial. No participants withdrew owing to 
adverse events.
INTERVENTIONS—We randomly assigned participants to receive on their cigarette packs for 4 
weeks either text-only warnings (one of the Surgeon General’s warnings currently in use in the 
United States on the side of the cigarette packs) or pictorial warnings (one of the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act’s required text warnings and pictures that showed harms of 
smoking on the top half of the front and back of the cigarette packs).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary trial outcome was attempting to quit 
smoking during the study. We hypothesized that smokers randomized to receive pictorial warnings 
would be more likely to report a quit attempt during the study than smokers randomized to receive 
a text-only Surgeon General’s warning.
RESULTS—Of the 2149 participants who began the trial (1039 men, 1060 women, and 34 
transgender people; mean [SD] age, 39.7 [13.4] years for text-only warning, 39.8 [13.7] for 
pictorial warnings), 1901 completed it. In intent-to-treat analyses (n = 2149), smokers whose 
packs had pictorial warnings were more likely than those whose packs had text-only warnings to 
attempt to quit smoking during the 4-week trial (40% vs 34%; odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 
1.09–1.54). The findings did not differ across any demographic groups. Having quit smoking for at 
least the 7 days prior to the end of the trial was more common among smokers who received 
pictorial than those who received text-only warnings (5.7% vs 3.8%; OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.02–
2.29). Pictorial warnings also increased forgoing a cigarette, intentions to quit smoking, negative 
emotional reactions, thinking about the harms of smoking, and conversations about quitting.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Pictorial warnings effectively increased intentions to 
quit, forgoing cigarettes, quit attempts, and successfully quitting smoking over 4 weeks. Our trial 
findings suggest that implementing pictorial warnings on cigarette packs in the United States 
would discourage smoking.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02247908
Reducing smoking prevalence is a top public health priority because smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable death globally.1 Clinical approaches to smoking cessation, including 
nicotine replacement2 and pharmacotherapy,3 and behavioral approaches, including 
counseling and financial incentives,4 are effective for the smokers that they reach.5 Policy 
approaches are also useful because even those with a small effect on a single person can 
have a large effect across the population.6 Policy approaches to discourage smoking 
initiation and encourage cessation include raising prices, clean indoor air laws, restricting 
tobacco marketing, and requiring warnings on cigarette packs.7
In 1966, the United States led the world by becoming the first to require warnings on 
cigarette packs.8 Since then, the United States has fallen far behind other countries by 
allowing pack warnings to become stale and ineffective.9 The World Health Organization 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, an international treaty, recommends that 
cigarette packs have pictorial warnings to communicate the harms of smoking; the United 
States has not ratified this treaty.7 Currently, 77 countries and jurisdictions require pictorial

 cigarette pack warnings.10 Through the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act, US law now requires these warnings.11 However, implementation of pictorial 
warnings in the United States has been stalled by a 2012 lawsuit by the tobacco industry, in 
which the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the 9 
pictorial warnings proposed by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The court 
dismissively stated that FDA had “not provided a shred of evidence” that pictorial warnings 
reduce smoking.12
A large body of research indicates that pictorial warnings are more effective than text-only 
warnings.13–19 Experimental research shows that pictorial warnings draw attention, elicit 
cognitive and affective reactions, and increase intentions to quit smoking,13 but few 
experiments have included longitudinal assessments of smoking behavior. Some 
observational studies have found increases in cessation-related behaviors,16–19 but the 
absence of randomization prevents these studies from ruling out the influence of 
confounders. To address these gaps, we conducted a large randomized clinical trial to assess 
the effect on smoking behavior of adding pictorial cigarette pack warnings to the front and 
back of cigarette packs.
Methods
Our research group has previously published a detailed description of the study protocol 
(NCT02247908) that we pilot tested in July and August 2014 with 56 adult smokers in 
North Carolina (Supplement 1).20,21 The University of North Carolina institutional review 
board approved all study procedures, and all participants provided their written informed 
consent.
Participants
We conducted a between-participant (or parallel-group) randomized clinical trial with adult 
smokers in North Carolina and California. We chose these 2 areas because they have 
populations that are diverse with respect to many of the disparities associated with smoking. 
Participants were 18 years or older, English speakers, and current smokers (defined as 
having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and now smoking every day or 
some days). We excluded pregnant women, people who smoked only roll-your-own 
cigarettes, people concurrently enrolled in a smoking cessation trial, people who smoked 
fewer than 7 cigarettes per week, and people who at baseline reported living in the same 
household as another study participant. We chose the cutoff of 7 cigarettes per week to 
exclude very light smokers who might not purchase their own packs. We recruited 
participants from September 2014 to August 2015 through Facebook, Craigs list, email lists, 
in-person recruitment, referrals from local retailers, flyers, yard signs, and bus and 
newspaper advertisements.

 Findings
In this randomized clinical trial that included 2149 adult smokers, 40% of smokers in the 
pictorial arm made a quit attempt compared with 34% in the text-only arm, a significant 
difference.
Meaning
Implementing pictorial warnings on cigarette packs could increase quit attempts among 
smokers.
Procedures
We screened smokers for eligibility online or by phone. We used responses to screening 
questions to estimate eligible smokers’ usual cigarette consumption and instructed them to 
bring an 8-day supply of cigarettes to the baseline visit, at which smokers enrolled and 
provided written informed consent. At this time, we informed participants that the study was 
examining how smokers understand the labels on their cigarette packs. At this visit, we 
assigned participants to receive 1 of 8 warnings using simple randomization based on a 
single allocation ratio. Using a random number generator, we created a randomly ordered, 
pre-populated list of study conditions and, as participants enrolled in the study, we assigned 
them to the next study condition on the list. Four pictorial warnings contained text required 
by the Tobacco Control Act and a picture to illustrate a health harm of smoking selected 
from the FDA’s originally proposed set of images22 (Figure 1). We chose these 4 warning 
images because they performed well in a previous internet study and avoided many of the 
criticisms in the lawsuits (eg, using a cartoon or a rare health harm of smoking).23 We 
removed the quit line number from the images, which was a source of contention in 
litigation against the warnings.12 Four text-only control warnings used the US Surgeon 
General’s warning statements that have been required on the side of cigarette packs since 
1985. Participants attended 4 follow-up visits spaced 1week apart, bringing an 8-day supply 
of cigarettes to all but the final visit.
Participants completed 2 computer surveys at the baseline visit and 1 survey at each visit 
thereafter. While participants completed the surveys at these appointments, research staff 
placed the assigned warnings on participants’ cigarette packs. Participants who missed visits 
completed the computer survey remotely and did not have their packs labeled that week. For 
smokers assigned to receive pictorial warnings, research staff removed the package 
cellophane and applied the self-adhesive labels to the top half of the front and back panels of 
participants’ cigarette packs, in accordance with the proposed FDA requirements.11 For 
participants with flip top packs, research staff cut through the label to allow the top to open 
freely. For smokers assigned to receive text-only warnings, research staff removed the 
package cellophane and applied the self-adhesive labels on the side of the packs covering the 
existing US Surgeon General’s warnings. We applied the new warning labels on top of the 
existing warnings to control for the effect of putting a label on smokers’ packs. Participants 
received an incorrect label at 0.1% (11 of 7384) of visits during which packs were labeled, 
but in all cases remained within their assigned trial arm (eg, one pictorial warning instead of 
another).

 Participants received a cash incentive at the end of each visit, up to a total of $185 in North 
Carolina and $200 in California, depending on the number of surveys completed. 
Participation incentives were higher in California owing to the higher cost of living there. At 
the end of the final follow-up appointment, participants received information about local 
smoking cessation programs.
Outcome Measures
We used validated items and cognitively tested24 newly developed survey items with 15 
adult smokers prior to finalizing the survey instrument. The baseline prelabeling survey 
assessed quit attempts in the last month and most secondary outcomes (eTable 1 in 
Supplement 2), and the baseline post labeling survey assessed demographic characteristics.
The primary trial outcome was attempting to quit smoking during the study. At week 1, 
week 2, week 3, and week 4 follow-up visits, we asked participants “During the last week, 
did you stop smoking for 1 day or longer because you were trying to quit smoking?” At 
week 4 follow-up, we also asked “Since you started the study, did you stop smoking for 1 
day or longer because you were trying to quit smoking?” We considered participants to have 
made a quit attempt if they answered “yes” to any of the quit attempt questions.
We used the message impact framework (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2), a taxonomy of 
variables that pictorial warnings may affect,13 to guide the selection of secondary outcomes. 
Secondary outcomes were measured at week 4 follow-up: cognitive elaboration (thinking 
about the warning message and thinking about the harms of smoking); fear elicited by the 
warning and negative affect (eg, disgust, anger); perceived likelihood of harm from smoking; 
positive and negative smoking reinforcement attitudes; quit intentions; number of 
conversations in the past week about the warning, health risks of smoking, and quitting 
smoking; number of times forgoing a cigarette in the past week; and quitting smoking 
(defined as not smoking cigarettes in the 7 days before the week 4 follow-up visit). 
Participants who had quit smoking did not answer questions about quit intentions and 
forgoing a cigarette.
Statistical Analysis
Power analyses indicated that the target enrollment of 2250 smokers would provide 80% 
power to detect a 3% or larger difference in quit attempts, assuming an α = .05. We 
examined baseline differences between trial arms using χ2 tests for categorical variables and 
independent-samples t tests for continuous variables. We examined differential attrition 
using logistic regression models.
Intent-to-treat analyses of trial outcomes included all participants randomized.25 Analysis of 
the primary trial outcome of quit attempts used logistic regression to examine the association 
with trial arm, controlling for any variables that differed at baseline between arms or for 
which we found differential attrition. To examine if warning effects differed by participant 
characteristics, we added participant characteristics and their interaction with trial arm to a 
separate logistic regression model for each characteristic. To understand whether any effects 
of warnings emerged over time, exploratory analyses examined differences in quit attempts 
during the trial by each follow-up visit. For continuous secondary outcomes, we used

 independent samples t tests, examining whether the outcomes differed by trial arm. Analyses 
of continuous outcomes using nonparametric tests yielded an identical pattern of statistical 
significance. Analyses of secondary outcomes used the last observation available. We did 
not plan or conduct interim analyses. Analyses used SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). We set 
critical α = .05 and used 2-tailed statistical tests.
Results
Participant Characteristics
From October 2014 to September 2015, we enrolled 2149 adult current smokers, 101 
smokers fewer than the enrollment target owing to recruitment challenges. The study flow 
diagram shows the number of people who underwent eligibility screening, enrolled in the 
trial, and completed the study (Figure 2). Briefly, of the 2149 participants who began the 
trial (1039 men, 1060 women, and 34 transgender people; mean [SD] age, 39.7 [13.4] years 
for text-only warning, 39.8[13.7] for pictorial warnings), 1901 completed it. Trial 
participants were diverse, including a substantial number of African American, sexual 
minority, low-education, and low-income smokers (Table 1). Randomization successfully 
created 2 trial arms (1078 smokers received text-only warnings, and 1071 received pictorial 
warnings) that did not differ with respect to participant characteristics (Table 1). Participants 
had their cigarette packs labeled for an average of 85% of their time in the trial (some 
participants missed study visits).
Analyses of attrition showed that 12% of participants did not complete the week 4 follow-up 
survey. A total of 188 participants were lost to follow up, and 60 participants withdrew from 
the study, mostly owing to lack of interest. Attrition did not differ by trial arm (12.0% in the 
text-only arm vs 11.1% in the pictorial arm; P = .25), and we did not find any evidence of 
differential attrition by demographic characteristics across trial arms. Participants were less 
likely to complete the week 4 survey if they enrolled at the California site (13.1% vs 9.7%; P 
= .01), smoked more cigarettes per day (10.4 vs 8.9 cigarettes per day; P = .01), or were 
younger (35.2 vs 40.3 years old; P = .01). During the trial, 28 participants reported living in 
the same household as another study participant, a finding that did not differ by trial arm (11 
in the text-only arm vs 17 in the pictorial arm; P = .25); our intent-to-treat analyses included 
these participants.
Primary Outcome: Quit Attempts
Smokers who received pictorial warnings were more likely to report a quit attempt lasting 1 
day or longer during the trial than were smokers who received text-only warnings (40% vs 
34%; odds ratio [OR], 1.29 [95% CI, 1.09–1.54]) (Table 2). The effect of pictorial warnings 
on quit attempts did not differ among demographic subgroups we examined or cigarettes 
smoked per day (P > .12 for interaction for all comparisons; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). In 
exploratory analyses, the effect of warnings appeared by week 2 follow-up (eFigure 2 in 
Supplement 2).

 Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of secondary outcomes indicated that having quit smoking for at least the 7 days 
immediately prior to their last visit was more common among smokers with pictorial than 
text-only warnings (5.7% vs 3.8%; OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.02–2.29]). Pictorial warnings also 
more often led to forgoing a cigarette (P = .04) and greater intentions to quit smoking (P < .
001) than text-only warnings (Table 3). Pictorial warnings led to more thinking about the 
warning message (P < .001) and harms of smoking (P = .01); fear (P < .001) and negative 
affect (P < .001); and conversations about the warnings (P < .001), health risks of smoking 
(P < .001), and quitting (P = .01). Perceived likelihood of harm from smoking, positive 
smoking reinforcement attitudes, and negative smoking reinforcement attitudes did not differ 
by trial arm. Participants reported no adverse events during the trial.
Discussion
Our randomized clinical trial with a diverse sample of 2149 adult smokers found that 
pictorial cigarette pack warnings increased quit attempts from 34% to 40%, an absolute 
increase of 6%. In relative terms, this is an 18% increase. Pictorial warnings were equally 
effective for diverse population subgroups, including lower-education, lower-income, racial-
minority, and sexual-minority smokers, supporting prior research suggesting that pictorial 
warnings would be unlikely to exacerbate smoking disparities.26,27 The warnings also 
increased intentions to quit smoking and forgoing cigarettes, both of which are predictors of 
subsequent quit attempts.16 Despite the relatively short duration of the trial, 5.7% of smokers 
exposed to pictorial warnings had quit smoking for at least 1 week by the end of the trial 
compared with 3.8% of those exposed to text-only warnings, translating to an absolute 
increase of 1.9%. In relative terms, this is a 50% increase.
The effects we observed appear modest, but they could have a substantial benefit across the 
population of US smokers. The recent Tips from Former Smokers campaign generated only 
an absolute increase of 3.7% in quit attempts, and yet this small change translated to an 
estimated 1.64 million quit attempts and 220000 smokers who quit smoking.28 Unlike 
national campaigns such as Tips, that cost $54 million for a 3-month flight of ads,29 pictorial 
warnings cost little to sustain once the work to develop and defend them against tobacco 
industry litigation is complete. Moreover, supplementing the introduction of pictorial 
warnings with a synergistic media campaign to reinforce their message may further increase 
their effect.30
These findings fill an important gap in the empirical literature on pictorial warnings. Our 
group’s recent meta analysis of controlled experiments,13 which typically presented 
warnings on a computer screen, found pictorial warnings were more effective than text-only 
warnings in improving 20 of 25 psychosocial outcomes. However, the meta analysis 
identified only 1 experiment that examined smoking behavior as an outcome. Among 56 
adult smokers exposed to a single pictorial or text-only warning a week for 4 weeks, no 
change in smoking behavior was found, likely owing to inadequate power.31 Another 
experiment with 202 smokers, published after the meta-analysis search, also showed no 
effect on behavior.32 Most large observational studies evaluating smoking behavior before 
and after warning exposure have found increases in quit attempts and reductions in smoking

 prevalence in countries that implemented pictorial warnings,18,19 although some studies 
have not33; other studies indicate that some of the effects of warnings may partially wear out 
over time.34,35 Such studies support only limited inferences about effect, however, because 
countries often change several policies at the same time; secular trends and historical events 
are difficult to account for; and potential comparison countries may differ in other important 
ways.36 Experimental studies such as ours have the benefit of providing controlled 
conditions that in many ways mimic what smokers might experience after the adoption of a 
national policy. Smokers potentially see the warnings every time they smoke, which would 
equate to around 600 views in a month for a pack-a-day smoker.
The study of warning effects has generated many ideas, but few solid answers, about 
psychological processes by which pictorial warnings may change behavior. The message 
reactions hypothesis suggests that pictorial warnings elicit stronger initial affective and 
cognitive reactions, such as fear and thinking about the harms of smoking, more effectively 
motivating quitting.13,37,38 Support for this hypothesis comes from the findings of the 
present trial as well as our group’s earlier meta-analysis13 of the pictorial warnings 
literature. These findings suggest that negative emotional reactions were more generalized 
than just fear. The warnings may have had an even larger effect had we included the quit line 
number39 because research has shown that fear dissipates quickly, so providing a concrete 
way to take immediate action would prompt the healthy fear to motivate beneficial 
behavior.40,41 Future studies could quantify the added value of including the quit line 
number on pictorial warnings.
Other theories on the mechanisms by which warnings trigger behavior change include the 
social interaction hypothesis, which suggests that the warnings encourage conversations that 
reinforce the warnings’ effect.21,38,42 This is consistent with our trial findings and a 
promising area for future research; no studies in our group’s meta-analysis examined the 
dynamics of social interactions about pictorial warnings.13 The risk reappraisal hypothesis 
suggests that pictorial warnings may make smoking seem more dangerous, which motivates 
quitting.43,44 This hypothesis was not supported in our trial, nor in our group’s recent meta-
analysis,13 which may be unsurprising— many interventions fail to change risk appraisals.44 
Finally, the tarnishing hypothesis suggests that unpleasant images in the warnings may make 
smoking less enjoyable,45,46 a hypothesis that received some support in our group’s meta-
analysis13 but not in the present main trial outcomes: smoking reinforcement attitudes did 
not change.
Study strengths include a large and diverse sample of smokers who received the warnings on 
the cigarette packs they used every day. The generalizability of the findings across the many 
diverse subgroups is encouraging.
A limitation is that the trial examined the potential effect of adding pictorial warnings to 
cigarette packs as well as implementing other label formatting changes required by the 2009 
Tobacco Control Act compared with the present text-only warnings in the United States. 
Examining these changes together leaves open the possibility that the differences in smoking 
behaviors we observed may be owing to the combination of adding pictures and changing 
the warning format. Also, we do not know what effects pictorial warnings would have over a

 longer period of time, when applied universally to cigarette packs without necessitating 
removal of the cellophane, or when used in a different context (eg, in rural areas or replacing 
existing pictorial warnings with new ones).
Other limitations include the following: The pictorial warnings in this trial obscured the logo 
of certain cigarette brands (eg, Newport), and manufacturers might choose to move the 
branding elements should pictorial warnings be implemented as a national policy. The self-
reported main trial outcome of quit attempts and secondary behavioral outcomes may have 
been subject to motivated participant responses if participants inferred the purpose of the 
study. Studies of longer duration may be able to confirm smoking cessation as a primary end 
point by cotinine testing.47 Participant self-selection could have led to a study population 
with greater interest in quitting smoking than the general population. Assessments as part of 
our study may have led participants to think more about their smoking, something that 
appeared to also happen in the text-only warning arm. Despite these limitations of our 
experimental pack-labeling protocol,20 we believe it allowed us to gather important evidence 
of the effect of pictorial warnings and offers a useful way to evaluate new warnings as they 
are developed.
Conclusions
Implementation of pictorial cigarette pack warnings in the United States is on hiatus.48 Our 
trial findings provide timely and important information as the United States and other 
countries consider requiring pictorial cigarette pack warnings. The World Health 
Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control now recommends pictorial 
warnings but stops short of requiring them.7 Our trial findings support strengthening the 
treaty to require pictorial warnings on cigarette packs.
