Abstract
Triclocarban (TCC) is among the top 10 most commonly detected wastewater contaminants
in both concentration and frequency. Its presence in water, as well as its propensity to bioac-
cumulate, has raised numerous questions about potential endocrine and developmental
effects. Here, we investigated whether exposure to an environmentally relevant concentra-
tion of TCC could result in transfer from mother to offspring in CD-1 mice during gestation
and lactation using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). 14C-TCC (100 nM) was adminis-
tered to dams through drinking water up to gestation day 18, or from birth to post-natal day
10. AMS was used to quantify 14C-concentrations in offspring and dams after exposure. We
demonstrated that TCC does effectively transfer from mother to offspring, both trans-pla-
centally and via lactation. TCC-related compounds were detected in the tissues of offspring
with significantly higher concentrations in the brain, heart and fat. In addition to transfer from
mother to offspring, exposed offspring were heavier in weight than unexposed controls dem-
onstrating an 11% and 8.5% increase in body weight for females and males, respectively.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to examine changes in
gene expression in liver and adipose tissue in exposed offspring. qPCR suggested alter-
ations in genes involved in lipid metabolism in exposed female offspring, which was consis-
tent with the observed increased fat pad weights and hepatic triglycerides. This study
represents the first report to quantify the transfer of an environmentally relevant concentra-
tion of TCC from mother to offspring in the mouse model and evaluate bio-distribution after
exposure using AMS. Our findings suggest that early-life exposure to TCC may interfere
with lipid metabolism and could have implications for human health.

 Introduction
Triclocarban (TCC) is an antimicrobial found in many personal care products including
deodorants and antibacterial soaps [1], and is a common contaminant in wastewater [2]. TCC
has been detected in U.S. water at a mean concentration of 670 picomolar (pM, 213 ng/L) with
maximum concentrations in the nanomolar range (6750 ng/L) [2]. With the widespread
occurrence of TCC in the environment, bioaccumulation has been observed in organisms
including earthworms, algae, European starling eggs, plants and snails [3, 4] and reproductive
effects have been noted as a result of low level exposure [5, 6].
At higher concentrations, deleterious reproductive effects have been observed in rodents;
evidence of endocrine disruption and lower testes/body weight ratios have been shown in rats
(~170mg/kg/d) [7] and reduced offspring survival has been noted for rats when exposed to
TCC in their chow (0.2–0.5% w/w) during lactation [8]. Interaction with endogenous hor-
mones to potentially affect development of sex organs and interfere with reproduction has also
been reported [9–12]. In cells, exposure to TCC at micromolar concentrations has been shown
to enhance estradiol or testosterone dependent activation of estrogen and androgen responsive
genes [9]. This amplification effect was also demonstrated in castrated rats where administra-
tion of TCC and testosterone increased all male sex accessory organs [10]. More recently, at
environmentally relevant concentrations (nM), TCC has been shown to exert estrogenic activ-
ity in kidney cells [11]. Therefore, due to potential risk for human exposure, TCC has raised
concerns regarding its effects on human health.
Exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC), such as TCC during development
may pose a serious health risk to the developing embryo and fetus, as they are more sensitive
to perturbations in hormone levels which may result in changes that are often irreversible [13].
Additionally, protective mechanisms that are present in adults such as the blood-brain barrier,
liver metabolism, detoxifying enzymes, DNA repair mechanisms and a competent immune
system are not fully functional during development. These deficits along with an increased
metabolic rate may make the developing organism more susceptible to damage induced by
exposure to EDCs [14]. In humans, TCC has been detected (μg/L) in both urine (86.7%) and
cord blood (22.9%) of mother/child pairs from Brooklyn, New York [15]. The potential risk of
TCC exposure during development and the contribution of exposure to diseases developed
later in life have not yet been thoroughly investigated, especially at concentrations that humans
commonly encounter in their environment. To date, there are no data on the effects of TCC
exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations, its ability to exchange between mother
and offspring during development, and consequently the potential risk posed by this exposure
during development to human health.
The aim of this study was to determine whether an environmentally relevant concentration
of TCC transferred from mother to offspring through consumption of contaminated drinking
water. We investigated whether TCC (100 nM) crossed the placental barrier, and given the fat
solubility of TCC, investigated whether TCC could transfer from mother to offspring during
neonatal exposure through breast milk. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), an ultrasensi-
tive measurement technique that measures rare, long-lived isotopes [16] at attomolar (amol)
concentrations was used in this study to quantify 14C-TCC transfer to offspring after exposure
through gestation day 18 (GD18) and after lactational exposure through postnatal day 10
(PND10). The sensitivity of AMS enables the long-term study of environmentally relevant
concentrations of potentially toxic compounds. In a long-term study, TCC exposed neonatal
offspring were carried out to six weeks to investigate whether neonatal exposure had an effect
on offspring through maturity.

 Materials and methods
Chemicals
14C-Triclocarban (TCC) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA) with a specific
activity of 1.11x1012 Bq/mol (30 mCi/mmol) and a radiochemical purity of 98.8%. TCC was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to dilution into drinking water; the percent of
DMSO in drinking water was less than 0.001%. Water aliquots for dose determination were
added to Universol cocktail (VWR, International, Radnor, PA) before scintillation counting.
Bottle preparation and stability
14C-TCC demonstrated high adsorption in traditional animal water bottles synthesized of rub-
ber and plastic materials; 40–70% of the initial dose was lost within hours. Therefore, custom-
made stainless steel water bottles were used for all water dosing studies. Stability of 100nM
14C-TCC in water was tested (n = 2) for these bottles over two weeks with liquid scintillation
counting (LSC) (Perkin Elmer). An aliquot from each bottle was counted at the initial time
point (1 hour) and each subsequent time point; data is expressed as percent of activity lost (S1
Fig). Based on the average loss observed (~30%), 130 nM 14C-TCC water bottles were prepared
for all in vivo exposures (1.04 nCi/mL). Bottles were stabilized for two days before dosing; once
administered to animals, bottles were changed every 4–5 days. For each dosing bottle, an ali-
quot was taken before and after administration and counted with LSC. While in use, bottles
were weighed to estimate water consumption by each dam. Both consumption amount and
14C-TCC activity measured by scintillation counting were used to estimate ingested dose (ID).
Animals
All animal experiments were conducted following the guidelines and regulations set by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, including IACUC approval. CD-1 female (8–10 weeks) and male
mice (10–12 weeks) were used for all studies (Harlan, Livermore, CA). Mice were housed individ-
ually in polystyrene cages containing hardwood bedding and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle in a
ventilated room maintained at 24˚ C. Food and water were provided ad libitum.
14C-TCC dosing and sample collection
For TCC exposures, females were housed with males (4 females, 1 male per cage) and monitored
daily for vaginal plugs (gestation day 0). For in utero exposure, dams were given 14C-TCC drink-
ing water starting on the day of plug visualization through gestation day 18 (GD18). At GD18,
dams were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Fetuses were removed and separated from the pla-
centa, rinsed three times in 1X PBS and stored at -80˚C until analysis. Maternal and fetal placen-
tal tissues were isolated on ice, rinsed three times in 1X PBS and stored similarly to fetal tissue.
The numbers of fetuses were 11.67 ± 1.99 for the control group (n = 6 litters) and 15.17 ± 1.11
(n = 6 litters) for the TCC group; no significance was determined for litter sizes between groups
(p = 0.15). For the lactation exposure group, dams were given standard drinking water until lit-
ters were born (Day 19/20). On the day of litter delivery, 14C-TCC drinking water was given to
dams for the first 10 days of lactation. On postnatal day 10 (PND10) offspring were euthanized,
weighed and rinsed three times in 1X PBS before storing at -80˚C until AMS analysis. The num-
bers of offspring were 21.50 ± 2.5 for the control group (n = 2 litters) and 12.88 ± 1.20 for the
TCC group (n = 8 litters). For each exposure group, control dams with standard drinking water
were run in parallel for comparison. Due to significant differences in litter sizes for the lactation
exposure group (p = 0.01), litter was used as the unit for Fig 1 (GD18, PND10 groups); mean
body weights were calculated for each litter.

 For the long-term lactation study, dams were dosed with 14C-TCC drinking water similar
to the lactation exposure described above, starting on the day of litter delivery to PND10. On
PND10, dams were administered standard drinking water through weaning. An untreated
control group was run in parallel for comparison. The numbers of offspring were 11.60 ± 0.4
(n = 5 litters) for the control group and 11.83 ± 0.75 (n = 6 litters) for the TCC treated group.
Offspring were weighed every five days starting at postnatal day 1. At PND21, offspring were
separated into males and females and sex specific body weights were measured through
PND56. A subset of offspring (n = 20 for TCC, n = 20 control) was sacrificed at PND42 for
bio-distribution analysis using AMS and gene expression; these offspring were randomly cho-
sen from all litters in both groups. At PND56, the remaining offspring were euthanized after
weighing. Tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, lungs, heart, brain, inguinal fat, gonadal/ovarian fat,
retroperitoneal fat, uterine fat, uterus, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, colon, adrenals, thymus,
ovaries and testes) were collected from all offspring and stored at -80˚ C until analysis. Dams
were euthanized on the day of offspring weaning (PND21). Tissues (as above) were collected
and stored at -80˚ C until AMS analysis. Data were analyzed with the unit as the individual off-
spring for this study; litter sizes between groups were not significant (p = 0.80). Peirce’s crite-
rion was used to eliminate outliers [17].
AMS analysis
All tissues for AMS analysis were homogenized prior to analysis using a previously established
method [18]. Samples were incubated in 1–2 ml of collagenase buffer overnight at 37˚C with
gentle agitation; after digestion, samples were vortexed to break up the tissue in solution.
Plasma samples were analyzed neat, no digestion was necessary. A small aliquot of each sample
(10–100 ±l, depending on tissue carbon content) was used for analysis. For litter analyses (Fig
1A) samples were pooled to analyze a representative sample for each litter. For tissue specific
organ analyses, each tissue from each offspring and dam was measured. Prior to AMS analysis,
samples were converted to graphite as previously described [19]. Each measured 14C/C ratio
for tissues was converted to pmol of TCC/g of tissue or ml of plasma using the specific activity
of TCC and the carbon content of the tissue (10–15% for tissue, 3.8% plasma) as described pre-
viously [20]. Peirce’s criterion was used to eliminate outliers [17] in this data set.
For high performance liquid chromatography analysis of TCC content in offspring, repre-
sentative samples from three litters were used after exposure through PND10. Homogenized
samples were extracted with 50/50 methanol/acetone added to samples (5:1) for 24 hours with
agitation [4]. Samples were then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 800 x g. The resulting superna-
tant was dried under vacuum using a Savant Speedvac SPD2010 (Thermo Scientific) and
resuspended in 0.5mL of nanopure water. Analytes were extracted using 60mg 0.33 ±m poly-
meric reversed phase cartridges (Strata-X, Phenomenex). Cartridges were preconditioned with
1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of nanopure water. Samples were then passed through and car-
tridges were washed with 1 mL of 5% methanol. Analytes were then eluted using 1 mL of ace-
tonitrile. The resulting solutions were then dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 20 ±l of
acetonitrile. UPLC analysis was performed using a Waters Acquity system (Waters, Milford,
MA). Separation was performed on a BEH C18 column with dimensions of 2.1 X 50 mm and a
day 10 (PD10) (n = 8 litters). Data is expressed as the average percent ingested dam dose/gram tissue (%ID/
g) ± SEM with AMS measurements for homogenates of each individual litter. (B) Average offspring weight for

 particle size of 1.7 ±m. A binary gradient with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min of water was used.
Mobile phase A consisted of nanopure water and mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile. The
gradient was as follows: B = 2% for 11 min which increased to 100% by 12 minutes. The eluent
was collected in one minute fractions and each fraction was analyzed for 14C content by AMS
utilizing 1 ±L of tributyrin delivered in capillary tubes as the carbon carrier to bring the carbon
content to 0.6 mg/sample (necessary for efficient conversion of samples to graphite for AMS
measurement).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
For gene expression analysis, representative offspring were randomly selected across five
litters at PND42 for both male and female TCC treated and control litters from the long-term
lactation exposure study as described above. Total RNA from liver and adipose tissues was
extracted from PND42 offspring tissue homogenates in Qiazol lysis reagent (Qiagen) using
RNeasy minikit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription was per-
formed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qPCR) was then performed on the
resulting cDNA with SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) on an Applied Biosystems
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with primers listed in Table 1. Qua-
druplicate biological samples were analyzed per condition and each sample was analyzed from
triplicate reactions. All qPCR data was analyzed using the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) for
relative quantification and β-Actin was used as the reference gene.
Hepatic triglyceride analysis
Liver tissue from representative offspring at PND56 was randomly selected across 4–5 litters
for both male and female TCC treated and control litters. Liver triglycerides were measured
in duplicate with a commercially available colorimetric kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI). Liver tissue was prepared for analysis by mincing and mechanically homogenizing tissue
(200mg) in the standard diluent buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich). Homo-
genates were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4˚C. The resulting supernatant was
stored at -80˚C until analysis. Samples were diluted 1:5 with diluent buffer; each sample (10μl)
and standard was run in duplicate. Absorbance was read at 540nm using a Spectramax Plus
384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Statistical analysis
Data is expressed as the average value ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Peirce’s criterion
was used to eliminate outliers [17] and is noted where used. Statistical analysis was performed

 using a student’s t-test (two-tailed) unless otherwise indicated; litter was used as the funda-
mental unit of comparison when appropriate and is noted in the experimental methods. The
effect of TCC on offspring weight gain over time was analyzed via a hierarchical mixed effect
statistical model (Laird and Ware 1982). Additional details for this statistical analysis is in S1
Appendix. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests.
Results
We first investigated whether an environmentally relevant concentration of TCC could trans-
fer from mother to fetus when the dams were exposed through drinking water up to gestation
day 18 (GD18). Subsequently transfer of TCC to offspring through lactation was assessed
when dams were exposed through drinking water from offspring birth to postnatal day 10
(PND10). 14C-TCC concentrations in litter homogenates were quantified using AMS. TCC
was detected at low concentrations in offspring for both in utero and lactation exposure groups
(Fig 1A). At GD18, 0.005% ± 0.001 of the ingested dose per gram (%ID/g) was detected in the
fetus; higher concentrations were present in fetal (0.011%ID/g ± 0.001) and maternal placenta
tissue (0.007%ID/g ± 0.001) confirming translocation across the placental barrier. A 3-fold
higher concentration of TCC was detected in offspring homogenates at PND10 after exposure
solely through lactation (0.015% ID/g ± 0.002, p = 0.003) compared to the in utero exposure
demonstrating that TCC transfers readily through breast milk. We also observed a ~33%
increase in body weight for the PND10 lactation exposure group relative to controls (Fig 1B),
although this increase was not statistically significant. At PND10, TCC exposed offspring
weighed 5.98 g ± 0.42 (n = 8 litters, p = 0.09) and their control counterparts weighed 4.22 g ±
0.67 (n = 2 litters). No significance differences (p = 0.89) in fetus weight were observed for the
GD18 in utero TCC exposed group (1.26 g ± 0.02, n = 6 litters) when compared to controls
(1.29 g ± 0.17, n = 6 litters) (Fig 1B).
To identify whether the signal measured by AMS was from parent 14C-labeled TCC, we
analyzed representative offspring homogenates from our PND10 lactation group using ultra-
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). A chromatogram showing the retention times
for a TCC standard and the major hydroxylated metabolites, 2’-OH-TCC and 3’-OH-TCC, is
shown in Fig 2A. The radio-chromatogram for extracted analytes from offspring homogenates
is shown in Fig 2B. From three representative litter homogenates, the peak eluting at 10 min
accounted for 29.07% ± 17.29% of the total recovered 14C activity and had the same retention
time as the TCC authentic standard. The peak at a retention time of 6 min accounted for
70.93% ± 17.29% of the 14C activity but did not correspond to TCC or the 2 major hydroxyl-
ated metabolites 2’-OH-TCC or 3’-OH-TCC. This peak is presumably a glucuronide conjugate
of OH-TCC since it has been shown that 2’-OH-TCC and 3’OH-TCC readily undergo uri-
dine-5’-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase catalyzed glucuronidation to form an O-glucuro-
nide-TCC conjugate for renal and biliary elimination [21].
Given the observed weight increase at PND10 for offspring exposed to TCC during lacta-
tion, we examined a second group of TCC-exposed offspring through eight weeks of age to
determine whether elevated body weight persisted through maturity, and whether neonatal
TCC exposure affected organ development. Offspring were exposed to TCC during lactation
from birth to PND10. From birth through weaning (PND21), both baseline weight (p = 0.07)
and the rate of weight gain (p = 2.34E-5) for the TCC exposed offspring were higher than that
of the control group (Fig 3A). For PND21-56, TCC exposed offspring had a statistically signifi-
cant increase in weight (p = 0.016) compared to the control group (Fig 3B).
To determine TCC tissue distribution, harvested tissues were homogenized and 14C content
was quantified in each tissue homogenate with AMS. 14C was found in all organs examined

 (Fig 4A) for both male and females at postnatal day 42 (PND42). Higher concentrations were
detected in brain tissue compared to other tissues assayed with approximately 14% and 18% of
total recovered 14C concentration found in female and male offspring brain tissues, respec-
tively. Significantly higher 14C concentrations (p<0.05) were detected in female offspring’s
gonadal fat, gonads, muscle and heart tissue compared to littermate males.
The bio-distribution of TCC in the dams exposed during lactation was also determined at
offspring weaning (PND21). TCC and its metabolites were primarily distributed to major
organs such as the lung, liver, spleen, heart and kidney; approximately 75% of total recovered
14C concentrations were localized in these organs (Fig 4B). In relation to these organs, 14C con-
centrations in the brain (<1%), muscle (~1%) and heart (~7%) of exposed mothers were much
lower, unlike the higher percentages found in tissues of exposed offspring (14–18%, ~7%, and
~12% respectively).
The brain, muscle, heart and fat are all organs involved in lipid metabolism and energy
homeostasis [14, 22, 23]. Given the higher accumulation of 14C in these tissues and the overall
greater body weights observed for TCC offspring, we investigated whether changes in specific
organ masses also occurred in TCC treated offspring. Total organ weights normalized per unit
body weight were analyzed for all groups of offspring at postnatal day 56 (PND56) (Fig 5A and
5B) and exposed dams (Fig 5C). Common for all TCC exposed groups was a reduction in
brain size. A reduction of approximately 9% (p = 0.01 males, p = 0.005 females) of brain weight
was noted in all offspring, while a ~13% reduction was found in exposed dams (p = 0.03). Uter-
ine weight was reduced in TCC female offspring by ~14% (p = 0.02). Individual fat pads were
collected to investigate whether TCC exposure had an effect on fat mass. Significance was
found for the female group only with both inguinal and retroperitoneal fat having, on average,
22.97% (p = 0.0.043) and 39.66% (p = 0.001) greater mass respectively, compared to controls
(Fig 5A). Additionally, a 13.56% increase in thymus weight was noted for female offspring
(p = 0.02).
Other endocrine disrupting compounds have been associated with increases in offspring
weight and have been shown to disrupt lipid metabolism [14, 24, 25]. To determine whether
TCC exposure and increased fat pad weights correlate with alterations in genes involved in
lipid metabolism, we quantified the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabo-
lism in adipose and liver tissue using qPCR at PND42 (Fig 6). Significant down-regulation of
genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids was found in the liver of TCC
exposed female offspring (Fig 6B); PPARα (0.59 fold, p<0.05), CPT1A (0.31 fold, p<0.001)
and CPT2 (0.58 fold, p<0.05) were all significantly lower in TCC females relative to their con-
trols. We also observed significant down regulation for leptin (0.50 fold, p<0.05) and adipo-
nectin (0.43 fold, p<0.001) in adipose tissue (Fig 6A). There was no significant change in
mRNA expression levels in any of the measured genes from the male offspring.
We subsequently investigated whether or not these changes in mRNA expression were

Discussion
The present study provides evidence that maternal exposure to concentrations of TCC compa-
rable to levels found in the US water supply causes measurable effects in exposed offspring.
We have shown that exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of TCC results in
TCC crossing the placental barrier and being transferred to the developing fetus. Additionally,
exposure of offspring solely through breastfeeding during lactation, was shown to promote an
increase in offspring body weight and widespread biodistribution of TCC-related compounds.
Significant weight gain persisted throughout maturity even after TCC exposure through lacta-
tion was withdrawn. Neonatal exposure to TCC through breast milk also resulted in TCC

 distribution and accumulation in organs involved in lipid metabolism, such as the brain, fat,
heart and muscle. This bio-distribution differed from the TCC exposed dams, in which major
organs of the reticuloendothelial system such the lung, liver, heart and spleen contained higher
concentrations of TCC and its metabolites. We observed a dramatic difference in total recov-
ered 14C in brain tissue for offspring (14–18%) when compared to dams (<1%). The develop-
ing brain has been shown to be more susceptible to toxin exposure compared to adults due to
increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability [26, 27]. Therefore, higher total recovered
14C in the brain tissue after neonatal exposure may have been a result of increased BBB perme-
ability. Although a higher percentage of recovered 14C was in brain tissue for exposed off-
spring, dams exhibited a greater decrease in tissue mass compared to offspring suggesting
greater toxicity in brain tissue in dams. This is likely due to the differences in TCC dose for
dams and offspring; TCC dams were exposed to 100nM TCC, whereas offspring on average
were exposed to a much lower dose, which equated to ~1nM TCC-related compounds.
While both TCC exposed male and female offspring demonstrated increases in weight gain
throughout maturity, we found that female offspring were more susceptible. The higher weight
gain in female offspring (compared to males) was accompanied by significant downregulation
in genes involved in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Leptin and adiponectin both
stimulate PPARα gene expression and fatty acid oxidation by activating AMP-activated pro-
tein kinase (AMPK) [22, 28]; AMPK is expressed in many tissues with high expression of

 subunits (α1,γ2) in tissues that regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, such as the
heart, muscle, brain and liver [22]. In liver, PPARα, CPT1A and CPT2 are involved in β-oxida-
tion of fatty acids. Potential disruption of fatty acid metabolism for female offspring was fur-
ther supported by a three-fold increase in hepatic triglycerides. Collectively, these data indicate
that lipid metabolism may be affected for TCC exposed female offspring as suggested by the
downregulation of genes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids in adipose and liver tissue.
Our findings showing effects for female offspring after TCC exposure are in agreement
with other perinatal exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) with estrogenic
activity such as bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), which have been shown to sig-
nificantly affect female offspring and lipid metabolism after low dose exposures. Exposure to
BPA (~4 μM) during gestation and lactation in rats resulted in higher body and adipose tissue
weights with increased adipogenesis in only female offspring [25]. Neonatal exposure to DES
(ng/day) also resulted in increased offspring weight and body fat in exposed female offspring
at six weeks of age with elevated levels of leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and insulin in serum after
exposure [14]. TCC has been shown to have estrogenic activity in vitro [11] and is structurally
similar to other estrogenic compounds such as triclosan, which may explain why female off-
spring were more affected than males in our study. While shown to have estrogenic activity in
vitro, we did not observe an increase in uterine weight for our TCC exposed female offspring
in this study. This could be due to several factors; in addition to dose concentration, route of
exposure and species or strain may influence uterotrophic responses [29, 30]. Additionally,
uterine fluid imbibition is a result from estrogen exposure and care must be taken to preserve
the integrity of the uterine tissue to avoid fluid loss during collection [31, 32]. The uterotropic
effects of TCC were not the focus of this study, therefore, loss of fluid may have occurred dur-
ing uterine tissue removal.
Early life exposure to EDCs such as TCC has the potential to cause irreversible outcomes
due to the fragile nature of organ systems and protective mechanisms in developing organisms.
In this study, we did note differences in TCC bio-distribution in exposed developing offspring
when compared to TCC exposure as an adult, which further highlights the need to evaluate the
risk of early life exposure to chemicals such as TCC. Taken together, these results are of great
relevance given the documented presence of TCC in wastewater and its observed endocrine
disruption capabilities. Future studies are needed to fully evaluate the long-term health effects
of TCC exposure during development.
