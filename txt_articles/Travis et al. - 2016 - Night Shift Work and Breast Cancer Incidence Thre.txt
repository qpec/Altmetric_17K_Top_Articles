Abstract
Background: It has been proposed that night shift work could increase breast cancer incidence. A 2007 World Health Organization
review concluded, mainly from animal evidence, that shift work involving circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to
humans. We therefore aimed to generate prospective epidemiological evidence on night shift work and breast cancer incidence.
Methods: Overall, 522 246 Million Women Study, 22 559 EPIC-Oxford, and 251 045 UK Biobank participants answered ques-
tions on shift work and were followed for incident cancer. Cox regression yielded multivariable-adjusted breast cancer inci-
dence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for night shift work vs no night shift work, and likelihood ratio tests
for interaction were used to assess heterogeneity. Our meta-analyses combined these and relative risks from the seven previ-
ously published prospective studies (1.4 million women in total), using inverse-variance weighted averages of the study-
specific log RRs.
Results: In the Million Women Study, EPIC-Oxford, and UK Biobank, respectively, 673, 28, and 67 women who reported night
shift work developed breast cancer, and the RRs for any vs no night shift work were 1.00 (95% CI ¼ 0.92 to 1.08), 1.07 (95%
CI ¼ 0.71 to 1.62), and 0.78 (95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 1.00). In the Million Women Study, the RR for 20 or more years of night shift work
was 1.00 (95% CI ¼ 0.81 to 1.23), with no statistically significant heterogeneity by sleep patterns or breast cancer risk factors.
Our meta-analysis of all 10 prospective studies included 4660 breast cancers in women reporting night shift work; compared
with other women, the combined relative risks were 0.99 (95% CI ¼ 0.95 to 1.03) for any night shift work, 1.01 (95% CI ¼ 0.93 to
1.10) for 20 or more years of night shift work, and 1.00 (95% CI ¼ 0.87 to 1.14) for 30 or more years.
Conclusions: The totality of the prospective evidence shows that night shift work, including long-term shift work, has little or
no effect on breast cancer incidence.
Light at night can suppress melatonin secretion, and it has been
proposed that night shift work could increase breast cancer in-
cidence (1). In a review of the evidence available in 2007, the
World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) classified shift work that involves circadian
disruption as a probable (breast) carcinogen, based on sufficient
evidence from animal studies but only limited evidence of an
effect on human breast cancer (2).
The available human evidence reviewed by IARC in 2007 was
characterised
as
inadequate
for
assessing
moderate
risks

 reliably partly because of potential confounding and inconsis-
tent definitions of shift work and partly because most studies
were retrospective in design, comparing responses from women
already diagnosed with breast cancer with those from unaf-
fected women. Some retrospective results might have been
moderately biased by differential recall, and/or by differential
participation in the studies between women who had and had
not worked night shifts (3–5). The only prospective information
available in 2007 that directly compared breast cancer incidence
in women reporting night shift work with that in other women
was from two studies of US nurses, and elevated breast cancer
rates were reported for 20 or more years of night shift work (6,7).
Since the IARC review, results from five further prospective
studies have been published (2 in urban China and 3 in conti-
nental Europe) (8–12) and several meta-analyses have been
done (13–18), although the most recent included results from
only five of the prospective studies (18). To provide reliable epi-
demiological evidence, with minimum methodological bias, on
any relationship between night shift work and breast cancer in-
cidence, we now report first results from an additional three
prospective studies and an updated meta-analysis of findings
from all prospective studies, now 10 in total.
Methods
In response to the 2007 IARC review and a subsequent call from
the Health and Safety Executive in the UK for further epidemio-
logical research on breast cancer, we introduced questions on
night shift work into our resurveys of two large UK prospective
studies, and contributed to questions on night shift work in
another large prospective study, UK Biobank. We also planned a
meta-analysis of results from these studies with results from all
other prospective studies.
UK Study Participants, Data Collection, and Follow-Up
Participants from the Million Women Study (19), EPIC-Oxford
(20), and UK Biobank (21,22) provided data on night shift work
and other factors relevant for breast cancer risk. For each study,
participants gave written consent. The design, methods, ques-
tionnaires, and ethics approvals for each study are on the
study-specific websites (www.millionwomenstudy.org, www.
epic-oxford.org, www.ukbiobank.ac.uk), and further details are
given in the Supplementary Material (available online).
Questions on night shift work were inserted into resurvey
questionnaires of Million Women Study and EPIC-Oxford partic-
ipants to test the hypothesis that regular night shift work, par-
ticularly long-term night shift work, is associated with an
increased incidence of breast cancer (23). Participants were
asked whether they had ever regularly worked at night or on
night shifts, using questions similar to those asked in previous
prospective studies (6–8), and fewer than 3% in each study did
not answer the night shift work question (Supplementary
Methods, available online). Those who answered “yes” were
asked about the duration, timing, and nature of their night shift
work. The questionnaires were completed, on average, in 2011
by Million Women Study participants and in 2010 by EPIC-
Oxford participants.
Recruitment for UK Biobank took place, on average, in 2008
(from 2006 to 2010). Participants were asked about their employ-
ment, and those employed were asked whether their current
job involved night shifts never/rarely, sometimes, usually, or
always.
Participants in the three prospective studies were followed
via record linkage to the National Health Service (NHS) Central
Registers, which provide information on cancer registrations
and deaths, coded to the 10th revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (24). The endpoints in these
analyses are first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (ICD-10
C50) or death attributed to breast cancer (ICD-10 C50).
Women with any invasive cancer (except nonmelanoma
skin cancer [ICD-10 C44]) or in situ breast cancer (ICD-10 D05)
registered before the baseline shift work survey, and women
with unknown night shift work status (ever/never or yes/no)
were excluded from the analyses. Woman-years were calcu-
lated from the date women answered the night shift work ques-
tions to the date of cancer registration, death, or last follow-up
(December 31, 2013 in the Million Women Study and EPIC-
Oxford, and December 14, 2012 in UK Biobank), whichever was
first.
Meta-analysis and Identification of Prospective Studies
Relevant publications were identified from computer-aided litera-
ture searches and reviews up to December 31, 2015 (Supplementary
Methods, available online). We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus,
and Web of Science using combinations of the search terms “shift
work,” “night work,” “breast cancer,” “cohort,” and “prospective.”
Prospective studies are those where exposure data were recorded
before the onset of breast cancer. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were extracted from prospective analyses for
incident invasive breast cancer for any night shift work, and for 20
or more years of night shift work vs no night shift work (and, where
possible, for �30 years).
Statistical Analysis
In the three UK prospective studies, we categorized study par-
ticipants into those who reported working or not working at
night; ever or never having regularly worked night shifts for
Million Women Study and EPIC-Oxford participants, and cur-
rently or not currently employed in a job involving night shift
work for UK Biobank participants. Based on the hypothesis that
longer duration of night shift work may be associated with a
higher incidence of breast cancer, we also categorized workers
by duration of night shift work: fewer than 10, 10 to 19, and 20
or more years in the Million Women Study and EPIC-Oxford (du-
ration was not available for UK Biobank). Further analyses were
done examining associations by other categories of duration of
night shift work (<15, 15–29, and �30 years) and by time since
last working night shifts (<10, �10 years before baseline).
Cox regression models were used to calculate breast cancer
incidence rate ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals
comparing various categories of women reporting night shift
work with those who had never worked night shifts (the refer-
ence group).
The proportional hazards assumption was checked by inclu-
sion in the model of an interaction term between duration of
shiftwork and the underlying time variable (age). Since this
term was not statistically significant, there was no evidence to
suggest that the proportional hazards assumption was violated.
Attained age was the underlying time variable, and analyses
were stratified by geographical region of recruitment (and for
EPIC-Oxford additionally by method of recruitment via general
practitioners or postal survey). Analyses were initially con-
ducted without any further adjustment, and the main analyses

 with additional adjustment for: socioeconomic status, age at
menarche, parity and age at first birth, body mass index, alcohol
intake, smoking, strenuous physical activity, family history of
breast cancer, living with a partner, use of oral contraceptives,
and menopausal hormone therapy (categorization of the adjust-
ment variables is described in the Supplementary Methods,
available
online).
For
each
variable,
missing
values
were
assigned a separate category. Chi-squared tests for trend in RRs
across night shift work duration categories involved inverse-
variance weighted regression of the log RR in each category vs
the mean duration within that category.
We also examined breast cancer incidence by night shift
work in subgroups of Million Women Study participants de-
fined by selected characteristics including diurnal preference
(a graded response to preferring mornings or evenings, some-
times called chronotype), sleep patterns, adiposity, alcohol
use, and history of working as a nurse for 10 or more years.
To test for heterogeneity of the RR for night shift work across
categories of these characteristics, we used likelihood ratio
tests to compare multivariable Cox regression models with
and without interaction terms for night shift work and the
relevant factor.
For the meta-analyses, in studies where results for more than
one category of duration of night shift work are available, a single
study-specific estimate was calculated, taking into account the co-
variance between such estimates (25); this single study-specific RR
was used in estimates of the summary RR in the meta-analysis.
Summary RRs combining study-specific results were calculated
from an inverse–variance weighted average of the study-specific log
RRs. Unweighted chi-squared tests assessed heterogeneity across
studies (calculation of a weighted average of several results does
not require homogeneity between them).
All analyses used Stata version 14.0. Statistical tests were
two-sided. Results with P values � .05 were reported as not sta-
tistically significant, but interpretation of the P values took mul-
tiple testing into account.
Results
The UK prospective studies of night shift work and breast can-
cer incidence included 522 246 postmenopausal women in the
Million Women Study, 22 559 in EPIC-Oxford, and 251 045 in UK
Biobank who had provided information on night shift work and
were followed for incident breast cancer. In the Million Women
Study and EPIC-Oxford, about one in seven reported ever having
worked night shifts and about one in 50 reported working night
shifts for 20 or more years (Table 1 and Supplementary Material,
available online). In UK Biobank, 3.6% reported at baseline that
their current job involved night shift work (Table 1). In the
Million Women Study, a subset of participants (n ¼ 1322) an-
swered the questionnaire about shift work on two occasions,
two months apart, with good agreement between the reports
(Supplementary Material, available online).
Nursing was by far the most common job reported by female
night shift workers. In the Million Women Study, 45.0% of all
night shift workers and 61.1% of those reporting 20 or more
years of night shift work had worked as a nurse for at least 10
years (Table 2). Among the female night shift workers in EPIC-
Oxford, almost half reported having worked as a nurse, almost
half had worked rotating night shifts, and night shift workers
worked an average of 8.8 (SD ¼ 5.9) nights per month and
worked 10.2 (SD ¼ 2.7) hours per night shift (Table 3).
There were consistent differences in characteristics between
women reporting night shift work and other women within each

 of the three UK prospective studies (Table 1; Supplementary
Tables 1-3, available online). Women reporting night shift work
were more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status, to be
obese, to be current smokers, not to live with a partner, to take
medications to help sleep, and to report preferring evenings
rather than mornings (Table 1). Some of these differences were
more pronounced when comparing women who had worked at
night for 20 or more years to those who had never worked at
night (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online).
In the Million Women Study, 4809 incident breast cancers
were diagnosed during 1.4 million woman-years of follow-up
after the night shift questionnaire. The adjusted breast cancer
incidence rate ratio for ever vs never night shift work was 1.00
(95% CI ¼ 0.92 to 1.08), with 673 cases among those who had re-
ported night shift work (Table 4). Results were similarly null for
night shift work durations of fewer than 10 years (RR ¼ 0.93, 95%
CI ¼ 0.83 to 1.03), 10 to 19 years (RR ¼ 1.14, 95% CI ¼ 0.96 to 1.35),
20 or more years (RR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.81 to 1.23), or 30 or more
years (RR ¼ 0.98, 95% CI ¼ 0.69 to 1.39), and for night shift work
within the last 10 years (RR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 0.94 to 1.30)
(Supplementary Table 4, available online). In analyses restricted
to women who had been nurses for 10 or more years (Figure 1),
the multivariable-adjusted RR of breast cancer for ever vs never
night shift work was 0.96 (95% CI ¼ 0.75 to 1.23); for 20 or more
years of night shift work, it was 0.88 (95% CI ¼ 0.62 to 1.25)
(Supplementary Table 5, available online). In various other sub-
groups of women, there was no statistically significant hetero-
geneity across any of those considered (P > .05 for all tests)
(Figure 1). For completeness, subgroup analyses are also shown
in Figure 1 for 20 or more years of night shift work, but numbers
are small. Among women for whom breast screening data were
available, 56.1% and 55.9% of breast cancers were screen-
detected in ever and never night workers, respectively, while
33.3% and 32.9% were interval cancers and 10.7% and 11.1% of
breast cancers occurred in women who were eligible for screen-
ing but were not screened (all differences by screening status P
> 0.05).
In EPIC-Oxford, 181 incident breast cancers were diagnosed
during
70 000
woman-years
of
follow-up.
Compared
with
women who had never worked night shifts, the multivariable-
adjusted RR was 1.07 (95% CI ¼ 0.71 to 1.62) for women who had
ever worked night shifts (28 cases). There was only one case in
an individual with 20 or more years of night shift work and no
cases in individuals with 30 or more years of night shift work
(Supplementary Table 6, available online).
In UK Biobank, 2720 incident breast cancers were diagnosed
during 1.0 million woman-years of follow-up. Breast cancer in-
cidence was not statistically significantly increased in women
who were working night shifts at baseline; the multivariable-
adjusted RR was 0.78 (95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 1.00), based on 67 exposed
cases. When women were categorized by their reported fre-
quency of night shift work, the multivariable-adjusted RRs were

 Our systematic review identified 10 prospective studies (in-
cluding the 3 UK studies reported here, total ¼ 0.8 million women,
and 7 other studies, total ¼ 0.6 million women) that had reported
on breast cancer incidence and shift work (Supplementary Table
8, available online) (6–12). Altogether, these studies included 4660
women
with
breast
cancer
who
had
worked
night
shifts
(Figure 2). When results from the 10 studies were combined, the
weighted average RR was 0.99 (95% CI¼ 0.95 to 1.03) for any night
shift work compared with none. There was no statistically signifi-
cant heterogeneity across studies (P ¼ .052).
Information on breast cancer incidence associated with 20
or more years of night shift work was available for eight of the
10 studies (Figure 3A) (6–8,10–12). One study of US nurses did
not report the RR specifically for 20 or more years of night shift
work, so we include its findings for 30 or more years and its
findings for 15 to 29 years of night shift work (as in the 15–29
years category, most would have worked nights for �20 years)
(6). For comparison with results from the Nurses’ Health
Studies, the Million Women Study results are shown separately
for nurses and other women.
Taking all eight studies together, the combined RR associated
with 20 or more years of night shift work was 1.01 (95% CI ¼ 0.93
to 1.10) (Figure 3A), with no strong heterogeneity across studies (P
¼ 0.011). These meta-analyses were repeated using updated re-
sults from the Nurses’ Health studies, which have been published
in a conference abstract only (26) (for Nurses’ Health Study I, RR
for �30 years versus never ¼ 0.95, 95% CI ¼ 0.77–1.17; and for
Nurses’ Health Study II, RR for �20 years versus never ¼ 1.33, 95%
CI ¼ 0.93–1.89). The combined relative risk for 20 or more years
was 0.97 (95% CI¼0.90 to 1.06) with no significant heterogeneity
(P¼0.12) (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Figure 1,
available online).
Information on night shift work for 30 or more years was
available for only four studies (6,8,11). This incompleteness
limits what can be concluded about such prolonged night shift
work, but the combined RR was 1.00 (95% CI¼0.87 to 1.14, P het-
erogeneity ¼ 0.067)(Figure 3B).
Discussion
The totality of the prospective evidence, from three new UK pro-
spective studies and seven other prospective studies, shows no
evidence of any association of breast cancer incidence with night
shift work and, in particular, no evidence of any increase in inci-
dence with 20 or more years of night shift work. Confidence
intervals for the incidence rate ratios are narrow, even for 20 or
more years of night shift work (RR ¼ 1.01, 95% CI ¼ 0.93 to 1.10),
so these findings exclude a moderate association of breast can-
cer incidence with long duration night shift work.
The main limitation of the present findings is that an in-
crease in the relative risk of breast cancer incidence of only a
few percent cannot be ruled out. This is partly because the total
number of cases of breast cancer arising in women in prospec-
tive studies who had reported long-term night shift work is still
less than 1000; this will increase with longer follow-up and pub-
lication of further studies, but is already more than four times
as many as the number available for the 2007 IARC review (2). It
is also partly because women who have worked night shifts dif-
fer in several respects from women who have not (23), so resid-
ual confounding cannot be completely excluded. In the three
UK studies, women who had worked night shifts were some-
what more likely to be obese, to smoke, to take medications to
help them sleep, and to prefer evenings rather than mornings.
Nevertheless, we observed no association of night shift work
with breast cancer incidence in any of these UK studies, either
in minimally adjusted or in multivariable-adjusted analyses. In
UK Biobank, information was available only for current shift
work. Omission of this study from the totality of the evidence

 would make little difference to the results for ever vs never
night shift work and no difference to the results for 20 or more
years of night shift work.
It had been hypothesised that any adverse associations of
night shift work with breast cancer incidence may be masked
by differences in breast screening in night shift workers, but in
the Million Women Study we found no differences by night shift
work category in the proportion of breast cancers detected by
screening. We also found no evidence that the null association
between night shift work and breast cancer incidence was mod-
ified by personal characteristics such as sleep characteristics
(including diurnal preference), family history of breast cancer,
or recency of night shift work.
The conclusions of this report are strengthened by the limited
heterogeneity between study-specific results, despite differences
in design, population studied, exposure definition and assess-
ment, night shift pattern, and control of potential confounders.
Notably, while some studies focused on one occupation or indus-
try, eg, nurses (6,7) or textile workers (11), others included partici-
pants from many occupations (9) or the general population
(8,10,12). To test whether exposures specific to night shift work
among nurses rather than in other occupations could be relevant
(6,7), sensitivity analyses of Million Women Study participants
who had worked for 10 or more years as a nurse were done, but
they showed no statistically significant evidence of increased
breast cancer incidence with long-term night shift work.

 Individual-level night shift exposure information was self-
reported in these three studies and five others (6–9, 12) and ob-
tained via linkage to a workforce survey in one study (10). In the
10th study, it was assessed by combining individual-level infor-
mation on employment in specific manufacturing processes
within a particular factory with data on night shift work associ-
ated with each specific process in that factory (11). Repeatability
of self-reported night shift work in the Million Women Study
was good for reporting of any night shift work and the duration
of night shift work. Women who reported long-duration night
shift work are likely to have had substantial exposure to night
shift work, so misclassification is unlikely to have been so great
as to have masked any material risk.
The 10 studies in this meta-analysis all had data on night
shift work that had been collected prospectively and included a
total of 1.4 million women. Five of these prospective studies,
which included a total of 0.8 million women, have been pub-
lished in the last two years, and their results were not included
in the most recent meta-analyses (14–18). Restriction to pro-
spective studies is important when trying to detect or refute
moderate hazards as it avoids the moderate biases that can re-
sult from retrospective methodology. The totality of the current
prospective evidence suggests that night shift work, including
long-term night shift work, has little or no effect on breast can-
cer incidence. The IARC 2007 shift work review was necessarily
based on limited epidemiological evidence, and, although fur-
ther follow-up is desirable, the prospective evidence now avail-
able shows that classification of night shift work as a probable
human (breast) carcinogen is no longer justified.
