Abstract
Objectives and methods
Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight
fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two
types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Caven-
dish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and
water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were
collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.
Results
Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher
post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13
HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation
(N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sus-
tained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2,
P = 0.002). VIP ranking (<3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were
associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and
xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts
showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848,
Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, ver-
sus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of
immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.

 Conclusions
CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuat-
ing metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with
THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance
on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when
compared to water alone.

Introduction
Bananas are the leading fruit produced and consumed globally, and are an important source of
carbohydrate energy, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and other micronutrients. Of the hun-
dreds of different varieties that exist around the world, the Cavendish banana is most widely
consumed and exported, and provides 13.8 g sugars/100 g (1.9 g glucose, 2.2 g fructose, 9.7 g
sucrose). This banana also contains a unique blend of secondary metabolites such as phenolics
(7 mg/100 g fresh pulp), carotenoid compounds (73 μg/100 g), and catecholamines including
dopamine (9.1 mg/100 g) and serotonin (2.8 mg/100 g) [1–6].
In a prior study, we compared the acute effect of ingesting Cavendish bananas (with water)
versus a 6% carbohydrate drink (both providing 0.8 g/kg carbohydrate per hour) on 75-km
cycling performance and post-exercise inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune biomark-
ers using metabolomics-based profiling [7]. Blood glucose levels and performance did not
differ between the banana and 6% carbohydrate trials, exercise-induced increases in inflamma-
tion were similar and below levels previously measured during water-only studies in our lab.
Aside from higher dopamine during the banana trial, metabolite shifts following 75-km
cycling were not statistically different indicating a similar pattern of fuel substrate utilization.
In a second metabolomics-based study, Cavendish banana compared to water ingestion before
and during 75-km cycling provided carbohydrates (0.6 g/kg), catecholamines, and phenolics
compatible with enhanced performance (5%), diminished inflammation, elevated antioxidant
capacity, and decreased fatty acid mobilization and oxidation [8].
The mini-yellow banana [Musa acuminata AA ‘Lady Finger’ or Pisang mas] has a higher
sugar (5.4%) and phenolic (63%) content than the Cavendish banana (see Methods section).
We hypothesized that metabolite shifts following 75-km cycling would differ in cyclists ingest-
ing Cavendish or mini-yellow bananas in comparison to water only or a 6% carbohydrate
only beverage, and that this may impact post-exercise recovery from physiological stress.
The purpose of this study was to compare ingestion of the higher phenolic mini-yellow
banana with the Cavendish banana, a 6% carb beverage (with the same sugar profile as the
Cavendish banana), and water-only on metabolite shifts (using global metabolomics), oxida-
tive stress, muscle damage, and inflammation following a 75-km cycling time trial. Emphasis
was placed on multiple recovery samples (0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 6 h-, 21 h-, and 45 h-
post-exercise) to enhance interpretation of recovery patterns. Ex-vivo plasma cultures with
THP-1 monocytes were tested for cyclooxygenase-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (COX-2
mRNA) expression and real-time measurements of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to determine if increases in plasma levels of banana-

Participants
Participants included 20 male and female cyclists (ages 22–50 years) who regularly competed
in road races (category 1 to 5) and were capable of cycling 75-km at race pace. During the
10-week period when data were being collected, participants maintained their typical training
regimen, and avoided the use of vitamin and mineral supplements, herbs, and medications.
Participants signed informed consent and study procedures were approved (24 February 2016,
with closure on 11 November 2016) by the Institutional Review Board at Appalachian State
University. Data were collected at the Human Performance Laboratory at the North Carolina
Research Campus in Kannapolis, NC. The study was first submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov on
November 24, 2015, but due to a communication error between the IRB office and the primary
investigator, the ClinicalTrials.gov submission was not corrected, approved, and posted until
December 16, 2016. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this interven-
tion are registered.
Research design
This study utilized a randomized (1:1 allocation, random number generator), crossover
approach, and participants engaged in four 75-km cycling time trials while ingesting water
only, Cavendish bananas, mini-yellow bananas, and a 6% carbohydrate beverage, separated by
two weeks each (no blinding) (Fig 1). Participants completed the four arms of the study, and
data were analyzed with participants operating as their own controls. Data were analyzed from
subjects (N = 20) completing all aspects of the study using a repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA), within subject’s approach. Four subjects randomized into the study failed to
complete all four arms of the study (three due to changes in personal schedules and one to a
training-related injury).
One to two weeks prior to the first 75-km time trial, athletes completed orientation and
baseline testing. Demographic and training histories were acquired with questionnaires. Maxi-
mal power, oxygen consumption, ventilation, and heart rate were measured during a graded
exercise test (25 watts increase every two minutes, starting at 150 Watts) with the Cosmed
Quark CPET metabolic cart (Rome, Italy) and the Lode cycle ergometer (Lode Excaliber
Sport, Lode B.V., Groningen, Netherlands). Body composition was measured with the Bod
Pod body composition analyzer (Life Measurement, Concord, CA).
During the 3-day period prior to each 75-km cycling trial, participants were asked to
reduce the volume of their exercise training as if preparing for a race, and ingest a moderate-
carbohydrate diet using a food list restricting high fat foods. Participants were instructed to
keep the food record current by listing items immediately after they were eaten, to measure
and record the volume using household measures (tablespoons, cups, slices, ounces), to pro-
vide sufficient detail about the method of preparation and include condiments, sugar, oils,
butter, and other visible fats, and to avoid the tendency to eat less or under-report because of
the recording process. The 3-day food records were analyzed for nutrient and flavonoid
content using the Food Processor v. 11.1 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR). ESHA’s port utility

 (v. 4.0) was used to upload the Flavonoid Values for USDA Survey Foods and Beverages
(FNDDS) 2007–2010 database [9], and each food/beverage was assessed for macro- and
micro-nutrients, and total flavonoids.
For each of the four 75-km cycling trials, participants reported to the Human Perfor-
mance Laboratory at 6:45 am in an overnight fasted state (no food or beverages other than
water for at least 9 hours), and provided a pre-exercise blood sample. In accordance with
the randomized schedule, participants then ingested 5 ml/kg water only, or water with
0.4 g/kg carbohydrate from Cavendish bananas or mini-yellow bananas (ripeness stage 5 or
6), or the 6% sugar beverage. The volume of mini-yellow banana consumed was adjusted for
the 5.4% higher sugar content, and the 6% sugar beverage was formulated with the same
ratio of sucrose, fructose, and glucose (2:1:1) measured in freeze-dried Cavendish bananas
pre-, mid- and post-study (Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Refractive
Index Detection, Agilent 1200 series, Santa Clara, CA). Total phenolic content of freeze-
dried Cavendish and mini-yellow bananas was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu
method [10].
After a 20-minute rest, participants warmed up and then began the 75-km cycling time trial
using their own bicycles on CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainers (RacerMate, Seattle,
WA). The CompuTrainer MultiRider software system (version 3.0, RacerMate, Seattle, WA)
was used to simulate a moderately difficult, mountainous 75-km course with continuous
workload monitoring. Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded every
30 minutes. Oxygen consumption and ventilation were measured using the Cosmed Quark
CPET metabolic cart after 16 km and 55 km cycling (level sections of the course). Participants
consumed 3 ml/kg water every 15 min, or water with 0.2 g/kg carbohydrate from one of the
two banana types or the 6% sugar beverage every 15 minutes. No other beverages or food were
allowed during the cycling time trials and 1.5-h recovery. Blood samples were taken via veni-
puncture immediately after and 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise after
completing each of the 75-km time trial. The 21 h- and 45 h-post-exercise samples were
obtained from participants at ~7:00 am in an overnight fasted state. All blood samples were
centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored at -80˚C until analysis. The four trials were separated by two
weeks, after which participants crossed over to the next randomized condition, and repeated
all procedures.
Participants provided responses to a symptom questionnaire within 10 minutes of complet-
ing each of the 75-km cycling trials [7,8]. The symptom questionnaire included questions on
digestive health (feeling full, bloating, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting), energy levels, focus/
concentration, muscle cramping, and overall well-being. Subjects indicated responses using a
12- point Likert scale, with 1 relating to “none at all”, 6 “moderate”, and 12 “very high”. Partici-
pant ratings of delayed-onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) scale (1–10) were recorded prior to
each blood sampling time point.
Complete blood count, glucose, myoglobin
Complete blood counts (CBC) with a white blood cell (WBC) differential were performed
using a Coulter Ac.T™ 5Diff Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL). Exer-
cise-induced shifts in plasma volume were calculated using the equation of Dill and Costill
[11]. Plasma glucose was measured using the YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose and Lactate ana-
lyzer (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH). All samples were analyzed in duplicate and the
average of the two readings was calculated, with calibrations conducted every 5 samples or 15
minutes, whichever occurred first. Myoglobin was measured in fresh serum samples using an
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.

 Plasma cytokines
Total plasma concentrations of five inflammatory cytokines [monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra)] were determined using an
electrochemiluminescence based solid-phase sandwich immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery,
Gaithersburg,MD, USA). All samples and provided standards were analyzed in duplicate, and
the intra-assay CV ranged from 1.7% to 7.5% and the inter-assay CV ranged from 2.4 to 9.6%
for all cytokines measured. Pre-and post-exercise samples were analyzed on the same assay
plate to decrease inter-kit assay variability.
Plasma 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9+13-HODEs)
Plasma 9+13 HODEs were measured using LC-MS as previously described [12]. Chro-
matographic separation of 9-HODE and 13-HODE was achieved using an UPLC system
(Acquity UPLC, Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with the Waters BEH C18 1.7 μm analytical
column (2.1 x 100 mm). For detection of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, the UPLC system was cou-
pled with Quattro Premier XE MS (Waters, Milford, MA) and the system was operated in elec-
trospray ionization (ESI) negative mode.
Global metabolomic platform materials and methods
Sample preparation, control procedures, and analysis were carried out at Metabolon Inc., as
previously described [8,13]. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry (UPLC-MS/MS) platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC with Waters UPLC BEH
C18-2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm columns and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accu-
rate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and
Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution. Metabolites were identified by
automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of
chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred
adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual
inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon. Identification of known
chemical entities was based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of purified
standards.
Complex lipid panel
Lipids were extracted from 75 ul of plasma in the presence of deuterated internal standards
using an automated BUME extraction according to the method of Lofgren et al. [14]. Each
lipid extract was divided between two glass-lined 96-well plates (70% to Plate 1 and 30% to
Plate 2), then each plate was dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.25mL per sample of
dichloromethane:methanol (50:50) containing 10mM ammonium acetate. Flow injection and
mass spectrometry (FIA-MS) analysis was performed on a SCIEX 5500 QTRAP equipped with
a SelexION Differential Mobility Separation (DMS) cell, which was operated in Multiple Reac-
tion Monitoring (MRM) mode using both positive and negative mode electrospray in a Turbo
V ion source. Plates 1 and 2 were subjected to parallel analyses, called Analysis 1 and Analysis
2, with 50 μL sample injected at a flow rate of 7 μL/min for each analysis. Analysis 1 comprised
the PC, PE, LPC, LPE, PI, and SM lipid classes, while Analysis 2 comprised the CE, DAG,
TAG, CER, DCER, HCER, LCER, and FFA lipid classes. Both analyses included 20 MRM
cycles with 20 msec per MRM pair, a settling time of 50 msec, and a pause between mass
ranges of 5 msec. Individual lipid species were quantified based on the ratio of signal intensity
for target compounds to the signal intensity for an assigned internal standard of known

 concentration. Lipid class concentrations were calculated from the sum of all molecular species
within a class, and fatty acid compositions were determined by calculating the proportion of
individual fatty acids within each class.
Anti-inflammatory in vitro assay
The human peripheral blood monocyte cell line THP-1 was obtained from ATCC (ATCC1
TIB-202 Livingstone, MT). THP-1 was maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.05 mM b-mercap-
toethanol, at a density not exceeding 5 × 105 cells/mL. The cells were maintained at 37˚C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured into 24-well plates for the cell
assay.
THP-1 monocytes were subcultured when flasks reached up to 90% confluence with a 1:5
ratio in fresh medium. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a concentration of 3×105 cells
mL-1 24h prior to treatment. On the day of the experiment, medium containing the induction
control (Liposacharide, LPS), positive control (Dexametasone, DEX), or plasma from the
human subjects (pre- and post-exercise, 1.5 h- and 21 h-post-exercise) were added to a set of 3
wells per sample and incubated for 6 h at 37 ˚C with 5% CO2. Three replicates were made for
both the treatments and the controls. At the end of the treatment period, cells were harvested
in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) for subsequent cellular RNA extraction. Cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate for the cell viability assay. Cell viability was measured by MTX assay
in triplicate and quantified spectrophotometrically using a Synergy H1 microplater reader
(BioTek, Winooski, VT).
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from monocytes using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically using the Syner-
gyH1/Take3 (BioTek). The cDNAs were synthesized with 2.0 μg of RNA using commercially
available high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies), following the
manufacturers’ protocols on an ABI Gene AMP 9700 (Life Technologies). The resulting
cDNA was amplified by real-time quantitative PCR using Power SYBR green PCR Master Mix
(Life Technologies). To avoid interference due to genomic DNA contamination, only intron-
overlapping primers were selected. Quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate using the fol-
lowing gene-specific primers as follows: GAPDH, forward primer 5’-ATG GGG AAG GTG
AAG GTC G-3’, reverse primer 5’-TAA AAG CAG CCC TGG TGA CC -3’; Cox-2, for-
ward primer 5’-GCT GGA ACA TGG AAT TAC CCA-3’, reverse primer 5’-CTT TCT
GTA CTG CGG GTG GAA-3’. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplifications were performed on
an ABI7500 Fast real time PCR (Life Technologies) using 1 cycle at 50 ˚C for 2 min and 1 cycle
of 95 ˚C for 10min, followed by 40 cycles of 15s at 95˚C and 1 min at 60 ˚C. Samples were sub-
jected to a melting curve analysis to confirm the amplification specificity. The dissociation
curve was completed with 1 cycle of 1 min at 95 ˚C, 30 s at 55 ˚C, and 30 s at 95 ˚C. mRNA
expression was analyzed using the ΔΔCT method and normalized with respect to the expres-
sion of the GAPDH housekeeping genes using 7500 Fast System SDS software v1.3.0 (Life
Technologies). A value of <1.0 indicates transcriptional down-regulation (inhibition of gene
expression) compared with control cells, which shows maximum genetic induction (1.0).
Therefore, lower values indicate greater anti-inflammatory activity. Values of >1.0 implies
overexpression of the particular gene. Amplification of specific transcripts was further con-
firmed by obtaining melting curve profiles.

 Measurement of cellular bioenergetics and oxidative burst
The human peripheral blood monocyte cell line THP-1 (5 × 104 cells per well) were seeded in
24 well XF assay plates and subjected to real-time measurements of oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using the XF 24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA). Cells were then added to 500 μl of XF assay
medium (DMEM without NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM pyruvate, pH 7.4), and equili-
brated at non-CO2 incubator and 37˚C for 1 h. Following a triplicate 6-hour treatment with
plasma samples obtained immediately post-exercise (50 μL/mL of a pooled sample obtained
from the athletes), 21 measurements were performed over 460 minutes under basal, LPS-stim-
ulated conditions, and the addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, with the first three discarded.
OCR and ECAR were automatically recorded by Seahorse XF24 software v1.8. Basal and LPS
stimulated (10 ng/mL) OCR and ECAR rates were determined by averaging the data points
obtained in those phases. Following LPS stimulation, the mitochondrial complex inhibitors
were injected sequentially in the following order: oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (0.75 μM), anti-
mycin A (1 μM each), and the readings were taken after each inhibitor [15]. Spare respiratory
capacity was calculated with this formula: [(maximal respiration)/(basal respiration)x100]
(https://www.agilent.com/en/promotions/seahorse-xf-technology).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean±standard error (SE). Male and female subject characteristics, and
food record and performance data across conditions were compared using paired t-tests. Bio-
marker data were analyzed using a 4 (condition) x 8 (time) repeated-measures ANOVA,
within-participants design, with changes over time within conditions contrasted between con-
ditions using paired t-tests. Data were checked for normality of the residuals using Q-Q plots.
For the metabolomics data, raw area counts for each metabolite in each sample were normal-
ized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Median
values for each run-day were set to 1.0. Missing values were imputed with the observed mini-
mum after normalization. Following log transformation of the normalized data, analysis by
two-way ANOVA with repeated measures with post-test contrasts was performed and statisti-
cal significance was set at q<0.05. A false discovery rate estimate (“q-value”) was calculated to
adjust for multiple comparisons.26 Fold changes across time points were calculated using
group averages of the median scaled intensity values. These statistical procedures were per-
formed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Orthogonal Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) in SIMCA (Version
14.1, Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) was used to detect metabolites that best distinguished the
time points and/or the trials. The default 7-round cross-validation in SIMCA was used to
compute the diagnostic Q2Y value which is a measure of model prediction ability. Permuta-
tion based validation was used to prevent overfitting. During permutation based validation,
the prediction ability of the model was compared with the prediction ability of each
model built using each of the 999 permutated data sets. The separation observed in
OPLS-DA was considered statistically significant if its prediction ability was found to be
better than 95% of the models built using the permutated data sets. Variable Influence on
Projection (VIP) score was calculated for each metabolite based on its contribution to the
model. Metabolites with VIP>2.5 were considered important metabolites in explaining the
separation. For comparison between time points in OPLS-DA, the normalized metabolo-
mics data was used. For comparison between trials in OPLS-DA, ratios between immediate
post-exercise and pre-exercise were calculated for each subject and used as input data in the
analysis.

 Statistical analyses for human peripheral blood monocyte cell line THP-1 (anti-inflamma-
tory in vitro assay and bioenergetics assay) were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Soft-
ware, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with treatment as a factor.
Post hoc analyses of differences between individual experimental groups were made using the
Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests. Significant differences were accepted when the p-value
was <0.05.
Results
The analysis included 20 male cyclists (14 males, 6 females) who successfully adhered to all
aspects of the study design (see Table 1). The study participant number (N = 20) provided 84%
power to detect a difference with an effect size 0.7 at alpha 0.05 using two sided paired t-tests.
The male and female cyclists did not differ in training volumes, body composition, and
VO2max. Three-day food records collected before each of the four 75-km cycling time trials
revealed no significant differences in energy, carbohydrate, micronutrient intake, or flavonoid
intake (data not shown). Across all four trials, energy intake averaged 2093±51.4 kcal/day
(8.76±0.2 MJ/day), with carbohydrate representing 45.7±0.8% of total energy, and flavonoid
intake averaging 85.7±21.4 mg/day.
Table 2 summarizes performance data for the four 75-km cycling bouts. Performance
times, absolute oxygen consumption (L/min), heart rates, the rating of perceived exertion
(RPE), and plasma volume shift did not differ during the two banana and sugar beverage trials
compared to the water condition. Absolute and relative power (watts) was slightly higher for
the Cavendish banana compared to water condition. The respiratory exchange ratios (RER)
were significantly elevated in both the mini-yellow banana and sugar beverage trials relative to
the water trial. Plasma glucose was significantly elevated during the first 1.5 h post-exercise in
the two banana and sugar beverage trials compared to the water trial, with a significant
rebound in plasma glucose in the water condition following lunch (consumed after the 1.5 h
post-exercise blood collection) (interaction effect, P<0.001) (Fig 2). Participants reported
more fullness and bloating, and reduced muscle cramping, following the two banana and
sugar beverage trials compared to the water trial (Table 2). No trial differences were found for

 recovery for the two banana and sugar beverage trials compared to water (Fig 3). A similar
trial contrast was found for serum myoglobin (interaction effect, P = 0.009), but time point
contrasts were non-significant due to substantial variation (Fig 4). The increase in plasma
9+13 HODEs immediately post-exercise was attenuated for the two banana and sugar beverage
trials compared to the water trial (interaction effect, P<0.001) (Fig 5). Interaction effects were
significant for plasma IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1ra, and MCP-1 (Fig 6 and Table 3), with substan-
tial post-exercise reductions at selected time points for the two banana and sugar beverage ver-
sus water trials.
Metabolomics analysis revealed 1,605 biochemicals of known identity from the global
metabolomics and complex lipid platforms (S1 Table). Fig 7 depicts the centroid plot using
OPLS-DA for all trials, sampling time points, and biochemicals. The length of the full loop for
the water trial (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater (i.e., indicating a greater and
more sustained metabolic perturbation) than for the Cavendish banana (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006),
mini-yellow banana (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and sugar beverage trials (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002).
A total of 109 metabolites increased more than 2.0-fold and 71 metabolites decreased by
more than 0.5-fold immediately after the 75-km cycling time trial during the water-only trial
(q�0.05) (S2 Table). The majority of the 109 metabolites increasing immediately post-exercise
were from the lipid super pathway, with 65% of the 71 metabolites decreasing identified as tria-
cylglycerol esters and 14% as primary and secondary bile acids.
The influence of ingesting carbohydrate during exercise on metabolite shifts relative to
water intake is summarized in Table 4 and S3 Table. The fold change in metabolites immedi-
ately post-exercise was ranked by VIP when comparing sugar beverage and water intake, with
the top 30 metabolites listed in Table 4 (VIP>2.5, q<0.05). Post-exercise fold changes are also
included for the two types of bananas for comparison. All three carbohydrate sources were
associated with significant increases for fructose, sucrose, and glucose, and significant
decreases for multiple metabolites from the lipid super-pathway, the amino acid isoleucine,
and the ratio 2-hydroxybutyrate/2-hydroxyisobutyrate from the glutathione sub-pathway.

 Plasma cortisol levels were significantly reduced 19 to 39% during the first 1.5 h of recovery
from exercise with carbohydrate ingestion (all three sources) compared to water (S3 Table).
Table 5 and S4 Table provides fold changes for metabolites most effected by banana inges-
tion. The VIP ranking is based on metabolite shifts immediately post-exercise for the intake of
the cavendish banana versus water, with comparisons relative to the carbohydrate beverage for
both bananas. Both types of bananas were associated with significant fold changes for several
metabolites from the amino acid super-pathway including 2-oxoarginine, pipecolate, argini-
nate, dopamine 3-O-sulfate, asparagine, tyramine O-sulfate, 3-methoxytyramine, 5-hydro-
xyindoleacetate, and S-methylmethionine. Other unique metabolites associated with banana
intake were increases in 2-isopropylmalate and 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate (food plant compo-
nent), pyridoxate (vitamin B6 metabolism), and trigonelline (nicotinate metabolism).
Immediate post-exercise change ratios were calculated for each metabolite in each subject,
and used as input data for OPLS-DA analysis. Fig 8 depicts the significant separation between
the four trials (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). This analysis passed permutation based validation.
Metabolites important for the separation are listed in S5 Table. These data indicate that

 metabolome shifts were distinctly different with the two banana trials compared to both water
alone and the sugar beverage, and additional assays were conducted to determine if the plasma
samples collected post-exercise differed in two inflammation-related outcomes. Fig 9 depicts
COX-2 mRNA expression in THP-1 monocytes cultured for six hours in plasma obtained
from study participants pre- and immediately-post-exercise, and 1.5 h- and 21-h post-exercise
across the four trials. Relative to the water only trial, COX-2 mRNA expression in THP-1
monocytes was significantly decreased 21-h post-exercise in both of the banana trials.
Following a 6-h incubation in plasma samples collected immediately post-exercise, mono-
cyte OCR after LPS stimulation and following treatment with the mitochondrial complex
inhibitors oligomycin and FCCP was significantly lower in the water-only trial compared to
both of the banana and carbohydrate beverage trials (Fig 10A and 10B). Spare respiratory
capacity [(maximal respiration)/(basal respiration) x 100] was 37.9% in the water-only trial
and significantly lower when compared to 99.3%, 97.5%, and 90.5% in the mini-yellow banana,
Cavendish banana, and sugar beverage trials, respectively. ECAR was significantly lower in the
two banana compared to water and sugar beverage trials after LPS stimulation (Fig 10C and
10D).

 Discussion
Bananas contain a unique mixture of sugars, nutrients, and bioactive compounds such as phe-
nolics, biogenic amines, and carotenoids [1–6]. This study utilized a metabolomics-based
approach supplemented with specific measures of inflammation to determine potential influ-
ences on metabolic recovery from 75-km cycling while ingesting two types of bananas, a 6%
sugar beverage, or water only. Regardless of the carbohydrate source (bananas or the 6% sugar
beverage), carbohydrate intake at a rate of 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes was associated with higher
post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, reduced plasma cortisol levels, diminished pertur-
bation in lipid-related metabolites, and lower inflammation as assessed by total leukocyte
counts, 9+13 HODES, and plasma IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. This finding is consistent with
other studies showing that acute carbohydrate ingestion (30–60 grams carbohydrate per hour)
during intense and prolonged exercise attenuates inflammation in part by increasing blood
glucose and tissue glucose uptake leading to diminished activation of the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS), reduced output of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, epinephrine,
and growth hormone, lowered lipid mobilization and oxidation, and reduced cytokine mRNA

 expression and release from muscle tissue [8,16,17]. Stress hormones have an influence on
genes that control the function of immune cells and their release of cytokines, and exercise-
carbohydrate interactions help modulate signal transduction cascades [18,19].
In agreement with previous publications from our group, cycling intensely for 75-km while
ingesting water in an overnight fasted state was linked to a 2-fold or greater increase in 109
metabolites, with the majority reflecting exercise-induced lipid metabolite mobilization and
oxidation [7,8,20–23]. The complex lipid panel showed that 65% of metabolites decreasing
post-exercise were triacylglyceride esters (S2 Table), reflecting the manifold increase in free
fatty acid mobilization and oxidation. OPLS-DA analysis of the metabolomics data showed
that metabolic perturbation for the water only trial was significantly greater and sustained
than for each of the two banana and sugar beverage trials. All three carbohydrate sources when
compared to the water only trial were associated with significant increases for fructose,
sucrose, and glucose, and significant decreases for multiple metabolites from the lipid super-
pathway, the amino acid isoleucine, and the ratio 2-hydroxybutyrate/2-hydroxyisobutyrate
from the glutathione sub-pathway.
An important aim of this research project was to determine if increases in plasma levels of
banana-related metabolites following acute banana ingestion conferred any metabolic

 advantage during two days of recovery from intensive exercise beyond those linked to carbo-
hydrate intake [7,8]. Banana flesh contains many unique molecules including dopamine and
serotonin, and their precursors tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively [1–8]. Serotonin and
dopamine consumed from bananas do not appear to cross the blood—brain barrier, and
potential bioactive effects in the periphery may include regulation of glucose and lipid homeo-
stasis, and enhanced gastrointestinal function [24–26]. Most of these data, however, are based
on animal studies, and the clinical relevance of ingesting serotonin and dopamine from
bananas is undetermined in humans.
OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant sepa-
ration of Cavendish and mini-yellow banana trials from both the water only and sugar bever-
age trials. This separation included metabolites with significant fold changes and high VIP
scores from ingestion of both types of bananas compared to intake of water or carbohydrate
beverage including dopamine 3-sulfate, dopamine 4-sulfate, and related tyrosine metabolites
(3-methoxytyramine sulfate and tyramine-O-sulfate), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5HIAA,
the primary breakdown product of serotonin) and related tryptophan metabolites (5-bromo-
tryptophan, indoleacetate, kynureine, and 3-indoxyl sulfate). Other contrasting banana-related
metabolites measured in the post-exercise plasma samples included those classified as

a metabolite of vitamin B6 (pyridoxate). Many of these metabolites were identified in a previ-
ous study from our research group [8].

 Some of these plasma metabolites had substantially greater fold increases with mini-yellow
banana ingestion (5HIAA, vanillic alcohol sulfate, 4-acetylphenol sulfate) and others with Cav-
endish banana ingestion (2-isopropylmalate, S-methylmethionine, 4-imidazoleacetate,
2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, eugenol sulfate). Despite these differences, OPLS-DA analysis
showed no differences between banana types when comparing total metabolome shifts imme-
diately post-exercise, or during 2-days of recovery.
COX-2 mRNA expression increases strongly following intensive cardiorespiratory and
resistance exercise in a variety of cell types including peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
muscle cells [27–31]. COX-2 is an inducible enzyme, is abundant in activated macrophages,
muscle cells, and many other cells at sites of inflammation, and converts the essential fatty acid
arachidonic acid to prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are involved in inflammation and also help
regulate numerous processes by acting on an array of cells through several different types of
prostaglandin receptors [30]. A novel finding from the current study was that COX-2 mRNA
expression in THP-1 monocytes was lower when cultured in plasma samples collected 21-h
post-exercise from both banana trials compared to the water-only or the sugar beverage trials.
Fig 7. OPLS-DA and the overall pattern in the data. The centroid was calculated for the samples in each treatment and time point combination.
Water trial is in blue; 6% sugar beverage trial is in red; Cavendish bananas trial is in green; Mini-yellow banana trial is in yellow. This analysis passed
permutation based validation, which indicates that the observed pattern did not occur by chance. However, the low Q2Y score (0.049) indicates poor
prediction ability, especially for the time points that have similar metabolomics profiles, such as pre-exercise, 21-h and 45-h post-exercise. It is not a
concern in this analysis, because complete separations of all of the treatment and time point combinations were not expected. The goal of this analysis
was to examine the overall pattern in the data.

 These data suggest that banana flesh metabolites that increase in human circulation following
ingestion may confer anti-inflammatory effects within monocyte cells as evidenced by reduced
COX-2 mRNA expression the morning following heavy exertion.
The specific banana metabolite(s) responsible for this effect is (are) currently unknown,
and additional studies have been initiated to make this determination. In vitro studies with a
variety of cells including monocytes and macrophages indicate that numerous plant phyto-
chemicals inhibit COX-2 mRNA expression [32–34]. Ingestion of plant phytochemicals such
as those found in bananas may represent an effective strategy to exert anti-inflammatory
effects by inhibiting COX-2 mRNA expression, but more randomized human trials are needed
using tissue samples. In the current study, increases in plasma banana metabolites were

 associated with decreases in ex vivo, plasma cultured monocyte COX-2 mRNA expression but
were not linked to reductions in plasma inflammatory cytokines beyond the effect observed
for carbohydrate intake. These data suggest that within an exercise context, banana metabolites
may function similar to aspirin or ibuprofen that inhibit COX activity but do not function as
cytokine receptor antagonists [34,35]. Markworth et al. [36] reported that ibuprofen reduced
plasma levels of prostaglandins and related metabolites in athletes following resistance exercise
presumably because of inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression. A direct correla-
tion between reduced COX mRNA expression and lowered plasma levels of prostaglandins
when banana metabolites are present in cell cultures will be investigated in additional studies
by our group.

Bananas and metabolic recovery from exercise
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194843
March 22, 2018

 Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples from the water-only trial showed a decrease in
basal and LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using an extra-
cellular flux analyzer, an effect which was countered when THP-1 monocytes were cultured in
plasma samples obtained from the two banana and sugar beverage trials. Furthermore, the
increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes from
post-exercise plasma samples from the water-only and sugar beverage trials was countered
when monocytes were cultured in samples from both banana trials. Inflammatory activation
of monocytes by LPS induces a rapid non-mitochondrial consumption of oxygen by NADPH
oxidase-2 (NOX-2) known as the pro-inflammatory oxidative burst [37]. ATP production in
monocytes is based both on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OCR) and glycolysis in
the cytosol (measured as lactate production, ECAR) [37,38]. Following LPS stimulation,
monocytes have the capacity to increase ATP production by increasing mitochondrial respira-
tion or switching to glycolysis.
Data from the current study indicate an abnormally low spare respiratory capacity of
LPS-stimulated monocytes that lacked the capacity to launch a pro-inflammatory oxidative
burst response when cultured in plasma samples obtained from overnight fasted, exercise-
exhausted athletes drinking only water. This finding is consistent with the viewpoint that the
pre-differentiated monocytes in circulation are a good sensor of metabolic stress [37,38]. This
impairment in monocyte function was countered when athletes ingested carbohydrate from
Fig 8. OPLS-DA for the separation between water trial (blue), 6% sugar beverage trial (red), Cavendish bananas trial (green), and mini-yellow
banana trial (yellow). R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409. This analysis passed permutation based validation. The ratio between immediately post-exercise and
pre-exercise for each metabolite in each subject was calculated and used as input data for this analysis. Metabolites important for the separation are
listed in S5 Table.

 the two types of bananas or the sugar beverage, indicating that the higher plasma sugar levels
was sufficient to maintain mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Metabolic switching to the
glycolytic pathway (ECAR) was inhibited with the two banana trials, suggesting that banana
metabolites had a role in mediating these effects. Frisard et al. [39] reported that LPS exposure
caused skeletal muscle cells to metabolically switch from mitochondrial respiration to glycoly-
sis, an effect countered by antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and catalase), indicating some role
for reactive oxygen species. Several of the banana metabolites measured in the plasma of the
cyclists post-exercise exert anti-oxidant activity including dopamine and the sulfated phenolics
[40].
Conclusions
Improvement of the rate of metabolic recovery from intensive and prolonged exercise
through nutritional support is an active area of research endeavor [18,41]. This study con-
firms and extends the findings from previous investigations showing that the primary nutri-
tion-based strategy to attenuate exercise-induced metabolic perturbation and inflammation
is acute carbohydrate ingestion of either sugar beverages or banana fruit [7,8,16,17]. Fruit
provides more than sugars, however, and this study using THP-1 monocytes supports the
hypothesis that banana metabolites appearing in plasma after ingestion exert anti-inflamma-
tory effects by decreasing COX-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, THP-1 monocytes cul-
tured in plasma samples from the banana versus water trials relied more on the accepted
default pathway of mitochondrial respiration rather than the more metabolically expensive
pathway of glycolysis for ATP production. Taken together, these data support the combined
intake of sugars and phytochemicals from banana fruit by athletes during heavy exertion as

post-exercise, and 1.5 h- and 21-h post-exercise across four treatments (water only, Cavendish and mini-yellow bananas, and 6% sugar beverage).
