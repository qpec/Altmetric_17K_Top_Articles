 RELATION BETWEEN NARROW NETWORKS  
AND PROVIDERS OF CANCER CARE

KEYFINDINGS 
Narrower provider networks offered on the health insurance exchanges are more likely  to exclude oncologists associated with 
high-quality National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers. These findings suggest that narrower oncology 
networks, while offering lower premiums, may involve a tradeoff between cost and quality of cancer care.

THE QUESTION
T
o reduce the cost of insurance plans, health insurers are increasingly 
marketing plans that restrict access to providers (both hospitals and 
physicians). These narrow provider networks allow insurers to offer price-
competitive plans, often through lower reimbursement rates or selective 
contracting with providers treating lower-cost patients. Whether narrow 
networks limit access to high quality providers is not known.
NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, and a subset of them identified as 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Cancer Centers, are 
recognized for their scientific leadership, cutting-edge medical technology, 
and lower mortality rates among severely ill patients. These prestigious 
cancer centers are more likely to attract patients requiring costly care, and 
insurers have a strong incentive to exclude oncologists associated with 
NCI or NCCN Cancer Centers from narrow networks. In this study, the 
authors assess the extent to which narrow networks systematically exclude 
NCI or NCCN-affiliated oncologists, and address the implications for 
whether narrow networks require a tradeoff between cost and quality.
THE FINDINGS
Of 407 markets (rating areas) in the country, 51 had an NCI-Designated 
Center; 27 of them had an NCCN center. The supply of oncologists was 
greater in markets with an NCI-Designated Cancer than other markets 
(13.7 vs. 8.8 per 100,000 residents). 
The authors identified 248 provider networks in these 51 markets. 
Networks in these markets were narrower than in other markets, covering

DR. LAURA YASAITIS
Laura Y
asaitis, PhD is a postdoctoral researcher in Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine. She completed her 
doctoral training in Health Policy at The Dartmouth Institute in 2013, and was a postdoctoral research fellow for two years 
at the Center for Population Studies and Development at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Her research 
interests include the study of large datasets, including surveys and administrative data, to better understand the quality and 
outcomes of health care in the United States. She is also interested in the application of spatial analysis methods to further 
our understanding of local trends in health and health care.
an average of 39.4% of area oncologists versus 49.9% in other markets. 
Despite this narrowness, the average number of covered oncologists 
per 100,000 residents was higher than in markets containing a NCI-
Designated Center than other markets (4.5 vs. 3.8). However, 33 of 
248 networks did not contain a single physician affiliated with an NCI 
center; these networks were narrower (covering only 14.1% of local 
oncologists) than networks including at least one NCI-affiliated physician 
(covering 42.3% of local oncologists). The figure on the front shows that 
oncology network breadth was associated with inclusion of NCI-affiliated 
oncologists, indicating that narrower networks are more likely to exclude 
these physicians.
THE IMPLICATIONS
This is the first study to demonstrate a correlation between narrow 
networks and exclusion of NCI- and NCCN-affiliated providers. These 
hospitals are recognized for their high-quality cancer care, education, and 
research programs. Thus, this finding suggests that narrow networks may 
not just offer fewer providers, but that the limited number of providers 
included may not offer the same quality care as those who have been 
excluded. This highlights a critical tradeoff that consumers face when 
purchasing a narrow network plan: they may benefit from the lower 
premiums charged by narrow network plans, but they may face reduced 
access to higher-quality providers in their market. 
These findings are relevant to replacement proposals for the Affordable 
Care Act, that emphasize shoppable insurance plans for consumers. As 
consumers seek to learn about providers and coverage included in their 
plans, accurate information about these providers is essential. In 2016, the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services enacted rules for publishing 
user-friendly provider directories that include a provider’s location, 
contact information, specialty, medical group, and any hospital affiliations. 
This study’s findings indicate that inclusion of quality indicators in these 
provider directories – such as NCI or NCCN affiliation for cancer 
providers – may prove useful to consumers shopping health plans.
The question this study raises, but cannot answer, is whether or not 
insurers specifically exclude physicians at higher rates because of their 
NCI or NCCN designation, or whether exclusion results from an 
additional correlated factor. For example, group practice size may be 
associated with market power and pricing, and may be a factor in an 
insurer’s choice to exclude a provider. Furthermore, the data do not 
identify differences in actual care quality between NCI and non-NCI 
centers. Future research should examine the relationship between narrow 
networks and cancer care outcomes.
THE STUDY
The authors used a registry of all office-based physicians to identify 
practicing physicians with a specialty of hematology/oncology or 
radiation oncology, and identified oncologists affiliated with one of the 
69 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, and the subset that were NCCN 
Cancer Centers. They examined provider networks offered on the 2014 
individual health insurance exchanges using a previously integrated 
dataset, and identified 51 markets (rating areas) containing at least one 
NCI-Designated Cancer Centers. 
The breadth of each network was calculated as the number of oncologists 
included in the network divided by the total number of oncologists 
practicing in that market. They measured a network’s likelihood of 
including high-quality oncologists within each market by the proportion 
with NCI (or NCCN) affiliation among the market’s oncologists included 
in the network, divided by the proportion of those with NCI (or NCCN) 
affiliation among the market’s oncologists excluded from the network. 
Values greater than one indicate relative inclusion—and values less 
than one relative exclusion. Then, the authors assessed the relationship 
between network breadth and the inclusion measure for all networks 
offered in any market containing an NCI-Designated Cancer Center. 
They also ran separate analyses for NCCN centers, but the results did 
not differ for this subset of cancer centers.
