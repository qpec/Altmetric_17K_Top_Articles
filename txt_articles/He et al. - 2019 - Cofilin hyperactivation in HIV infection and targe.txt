A functional HIV cure requires immune reconstitution for lasting viremia control. A major immune dysfunction 
persisting in HIV infection is the impairment of T helper cell migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as 
GALTs (gut-associated lymphoid tissues). ART (antiretroviral therapy) does not fully restore T cell motility for tis-
sue repopulation. The molecular mechanism dictating this persistent T cell dysfunction is not understood. Cofilin 
is an actin-depolymerizing factor that regulates actin dynamics for T cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that 
blood CD4 T cells from HIV-infected patients (n = 193), with or without ART, exhibit significantly lower levels of 
cofilin phosphorylation (hyperactivation) than those from healthy controls (n = 100; ratio, 1.1:2.3; P < 0.001); cofilin 
hyperactivation is also associated with poor CD4 T cell recovery following ART. These results suggest an HIV- 
mediated systemic dysregulation of T cell motility that cannot be repaired solely by ART. We further demonstrate 
that stimulating blood CD4 T cells with an anti–human 47 integrin antibody can trigger signal transduction and 
modulate the cofilin pathway, partially restoring T cell motility in vitro. However, we also observed that severe 
T cell motility defect caused by high degrees of cofilin hyperactivation was not repairable by the anti-integrin 
antibody, demonstrating a mechanistic hindrance to restore immune functions in vivo. Our study suggests that 
cofilin is a key molecule that may need to be therapeutically targeted early for T cell tissue repopulation, immune 
reconstitution, and immune control of viremia.
INTRODUCTION
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly extended the life 
span of HIV-infected patients, but it offers neither a cure nor full 
immune restoration. The natural course of HIV infection leads to 
multiple CD4 T cell defects (1), including the impairment of T cell 
migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs (gut- 
associated lymphoid tissues) (2-4). Even with near-complete viral 
suppression with ART, normal levels of CD4 T cell repopulation to 
lymphoid tissues are rarely achieved (2, 3, 5, 6), thereby dampening 
immune responses and preventing full immune reconstitution for 
lasting viremia control (7). In HIV-infected patients, the vast ma-
jority of circulating CD4 T cells are not HIV infected (0.2 to 16.4 
HIV+ cells per million) (8). Thus, the T cell migratory defect seen in 
patients likely results from a bystander effect from chronic signaling 
by viral (9, 10) and/or inflammatory factors (1, 2). However, the 
molecular mechanism dictating this persistent T cell dysfunction 
has not been fully elucidated. This has hindered the development of 
an effective therapy to restore T cell functions and to achieve per-
sistent immune control of HIV.
In the human immune system, T cell activity is mainly regulated 
by receptor signaling. Persistent signaling through cytokine or 
chemokine receptors frequently leads to T cell polarization and 
commitment to distinct lineages such as T helper cell 1 (TH1) and 
TH2. In HIV infection, the virus infects T cells through gp120 bind-
ing to CD4 and the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 
(R5) (11, 12). This binding also initiates aberrant signaling and may 
have pathogenic consequences (9, 10, 13, 14). In particular, HIV 
signaling through CXCR4 has been shown to activate an actin de-
polymerizing factor, cofilin, to promote the actin dynamics neces-
sary for viral nuclear entry in blood resting CD4 T cells (9, 15).
Cofilin is an actin-binding protein that binds and depolymerizes 
filamentous actin (F-actin) to regulate actin treadmilling (16, 17), a 
process in which monomeric actin (G-actin) is incorporated into 
F-actin at the (+) end and then dissociated from the (−) end. Cofilin- 
regulated actin treadmilling is the driving force in T cell motility 
and T cell migration to lymphoid tissues (18). Given that cofilin is a 
major part of the motility engine in T cells, we hypothesized that the 
T cell migratory defects seen in HIV-infected patients may directly 
result from cofilin dysregulation by persistent, pathogenic signaling 
occurring during HIV infection (19). Here, we examined cofilin 
phosphorylation in the peripheral resting CD4 T cells of HIV- 
infected patients in a large clinical study. Cofilin activity is regulated 
by cycles of serine 3 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that con-
trol cofilin binding to F-actin for actin severing and depolymerization

(16, 17). We confirmed that blood CD4 T cells from HIV-infected 
patients exhibit significantly lower levels of cofilin phosphorylation 
(hyperactivation) than those from healthy controls. These results sug-
gest a systemic cofilin-regulated T cell migratory impairment that 
needs to be therapeutically repaired for T cell tissue repopulation.
Integrins, such as the 47 integrin, play an important role in 
T cell tissue repopulation. Integrins are transmembrane receptors 
that mediate cell–extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions to 
facilitate T cell trafficking and homing to tissues (20). This homing 
process involves synergistic, bidirectional signaling with chemok-
ine receptors (inside-out and outside-in signaling) (21): Stimulation 
of chemokine receptors triggers chemotactic signaling that leads to 
the assembly of an intracellular complex connecting integrins to the 
actin cytoskeletons for integrin activation (inside-out signaling), 
while binding of active integrins to ligands can trigger further sig-
nals that lead to actin cytoskeletal rearrangement for cell spreading, 
retraction, and migration (outside-in signaling). Given the central 
role of cofilin in regulating actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, we 
tested whether stimulating the 47 integrin triggers synergistic 
outside-in signaling to modulate the cofilin pathway for repairing 
the T cell motility defect. Here, we demonstrate that stimulating 
47 with an anti–47 integrin antibody partially promotes CD4 
T cell motility by modulating the cofilin pathway. Our results iden-
tify cofilin as a key molecule that may be therapeutically targeted to 
restore T cell motility necessary for T cell tissue repopulation, im-
mune reconstitution, and immune control of viremia.
RESULTS
Cofilin activation through HIV gp120-CCR5 signaling
HIV binding to CXCR4 has been shown to activate cofilin to pro-
mote actin dynamics for viral nuclear entry (9, 15). We investigated 
whether HIV-mediated CCR5 signaling can also lead to cofilin acti-
vation in blood CD4 T cells. In contrast to X4 viruses, which infect 
both memory and naïve CD4 T cells, R5 viruses infect a subpopula-
tion of memory CD4 T cells (fig. S1A), leading to their early depletion 
in the gut and chronic immune activation (22, 23). We quantified 
the CCR5 receptor on blood resting memory CD4 T cells and found 
that approximately 30% of resting memory CD4 T cells displayed the 
receptor on the surface (fig. S1B). To determine R5 HIV-mediated 
cofilin activation, we stimulated blood resting memory CD4 T cells 
with an R5 virus, HIV(AD8), or an R5 HIV envelope protein, 
gp120(BAL). As a control, we similarly stimulated blood resting 
CD4 T with an X4-tropic gp120 (IIIB). We observed cofilin activa-
tion by both the X4-tropic gp120 (IIIB) and the R5-tropic gp120(BAL), 
as well as HIV(AD8) (Fig. 1, A to C); this R5 HIV-mediated cofilin 
activation is also mediated through Gi, as pertussis toxin (PTX) 
largely abrogated late cofilin activation (Fig. 1B). In addition, mar-
aviroc, a CCR5 blocker, also abrogated the R5-tropic gp120(BAL)–
mediated cofilin activation (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, both X4 and R5 
viruses activate cofilin by triggering Gi signaling through gp120 
binding to their respective chemokine coreceptors.
Cofilin hyperactivation in blood resting CD4 T cells of 
HIV-infected patients
Given that the CD4 T cells in patients with HIV are chronically ex-
posed to viral proteins such as gp120 (24), particularly during the 
acute phase, persistent viral signaling may trigger cofilin dysregula-
tion and cause a T cell migratory defect, as seen in patients with

HIV (2, 3, 19). We conducted a large clinical trial to examine cofilin 
phosphorylation in blood resting CD4 T cells (Fig. 2A). For this 
purpose, we developed a reverse-phase phospho-cofilin microarray 
that can quantify cofilin phosphorylation in a large number of clin-
ical samples simultaneously (Fig. 2B) (25). Blood resting CD4 T cells 
from patients with HIV, with ART (HIV + ART, n = 95) or without 
ART (HIV, n = 98), or from healthy controls (HC, n = 100) (table S1) 
were purified by negative depletion, unstimulated, and then lysed. 
Blindly coded cell lysates were then profiled with the phospho-cofilin 
microarray (Fig. 2C). We observed a highly significant reduction in 
cofilin phosphorylation in patients with HIV (HIV = 0.968; HIV + 
ART = 1.139; HC = 2.254; P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, ART did not 
significantly restore cofilin phosphorylation (HIV = 0.968; HIV + 
ART = 1.139; P = 0.981). These results suggest that HIV-mediated 
cofilin hyperactivation may result from ART-irreversible, patho-
genic polarization of T cells. This irreversibility appears to resemble 
the establishment of an early immune activation set point that dic-
tates subsequent CD4 T cell depletion independent of viral load (1).
We further examined possible correlations between cofilin hyper-
activation and viral load/CD4 count. In untreated patients, there 
was only a weak correlation between cofilin phosphorylation and 
viral load (P = 0.043, r = −0.205; Fig. 2D), and there was no correlation 
between cofilin phosphorylation and CD4 T cell counts (P = 0.057, 
r = 0.193; Fig. 2E). However, when ART-treated patients were cate-
gorized into immune responders (IRs) and immune nonresponders 
(INRs); the IRs had a significantly higher level of cofilin phosphoryl-
ation than the INRs (Fig. 2F). Both IRs and INRs had the viral load 
suppressed to the limit of detection after 1 year of treatment; the 
INRs had less than 20% recovery of CD4 T cells or a CD4 T cell 
count below 200, whereas the IRs had greater than 20% T cell recov-
ery and a CD4 count above 500. Thus, higher levels of p-cofilin in 
ART-treated patients were associated with a better CD4 T cell re-
covery after ART. We also followed ART-naïve patients after their 
p-cofilin profiling. Some of these patients were subsequently treated 
with ART (table S2). Again, the IRs had significantly higher levels of 
cofilin phosphorylation than the INRs (Fig. 2G). These results demon-
strate that pre-ART levels of p-cofilin can be used to gauge the de-
gree of CD4 T cell damage and predict T cell recovery from ART.
Direct effects of cofilin hyperactivation on T cell motility
Cofilin hyperactivation has been shown to be associated with a mi-
gratory impairment of CCR6+ and CXCR3+ TH cells, which are pre-
vented from trafficking from the blood stream to peripheral organs 
even in patients with aviremic HIV on long-term ART (2). T cell 
migration is controlled by cycles of cofilin phosphorylation and de-
phosphorylation, which are regulated by the LIM domain kinase 
(LIMK) through serine 3 phosphorylation (16, 17). To quantify the 
direct effect of cofilin hyperactivation on T cell migration, we used 
a recently discovered LIMK inhibitor, R10015 (26), to block cofilin 
phosphorylation in A3R5.7 CD4 T cells. We then performed CXCL12- 
induced T cell chemotaxis in the presence of cofilin hyperactivation. 
CXCL12 [stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)] binding to CXCR4 
triggers actin/cofilin dynamics for T cell migration (9). We observed 
an R10015 dosage-dependent inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation 
in A3R5.7 CD4 T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). We also observed a linear 
correlation between cofilin dephosphorylation and the impairment 
of CXCL12-mediated T cell chemotaxis (correlation coefficient 
r = 0.999, P = 0.002) (Fig. 3, C and D). At around 15 M R10015, 
cofilin phosphorylation was reduced to around 50% in A3R5.7, a 
level approximate to what was seen in patients with HIV (Figs. 2C 
and 3A). A 50% reduction in cofilin phosphorylation resulted in a 
20 to 40% decrease in cell migration for human A3R5.7 CD4 T cells 
(Fig. 3C). As a control, R10015 did not affect the surface density of 
the CXCR4 receptor (fig. S2). These results quantitatively measured 
the direct impact of cofilin hyperactivation on T cell motility.
Modulating the cofilin pathway using the  
anti-47 antibody Act-1
To modulate the cofilin pathway, we had previously identified a 
marine toxin, okadaic acid (OA), that can activate LIMK and en-
hance cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization (27). In a 
proof-of-concept study, OA was used to target the cofilin pathway 
to promote T cell migration both in vitro and in vivo in a murine 
model (2). The high toxicity of OA prevents its therapeutic use to 
restore T cell motility in humans. However, in a recent simian im-
munodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque study, the use of an anti–47 
integrin antibody unexpectedly promoted repopulation of CD4 T cells 
in a wide variety of immune tissues, including gastrointestinal tis-
sues (GITs) (7). Integrins are cell surface adhesion molecules that 
mediate the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions for T cell traffick-
ing to tissues (20). This homing process involves synergistic, bidirec-
tional signaling with chemokine receptors (inside-out and outside-in 
signaling) to initiate cell migration (21). Given that the anti–47 
integrin antibody promoted T cell trafficking and homing to lym-
phoid tissues in SIV infection (7), we investigated whether stimulation 
of T cells with the anti-47 antibody would trigger an “outside-in” 
signaling to modulate the cofilin pathway and promote T cell motility.
In human peripheral blood, high levels of 47 were detected in 
a subpopulation of resting memory CD4 T cells (28). In addition, cul-
turing naïve T cells in interleukin-7 (IL-7) can greatly up-regulate 
47 on the cell surface (fig. S3) (28). We stimulated resting memory 
and IL-7–cultured naïve T cells with the anti–human 47 antibody 
Act-1 and then quantified cofilin phosphorylation by intracellular 
staining and flow cytometry. We observed that Act-1 (1 g/ml) can 
directly trigger cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in a 
time course (Fig. 4, C to E, H to J, and M to O), thereby demonstrat-
ing that the 47 antibody is capable of modulating the cofilin path-
way. The time-dependent fluctuation of cofilin phosphorylation and 
dephosphorylation, beginning at 10 min and then returning to the 
basal levels at 15 min, resembles the cycling pattern of actin polym-
erization and depolymerization during chemotaxis (Fig. 4, C and E, 
H and J, and M and O). When blood resting CD4 T cells were sim-
ilarly stimulated with CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand known to trigger 
cofilin activation (9), we observed a similar cycling pattern of cofilin 
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, B, G, and L). The 
47 antibody–mediated transient cofilin activity was also partially 
dependent on Gi signaling, as PTX abrogated late cofilin activa-
tion (30 min) (Fig. 4, C and D, H and I, and M and N).
Targeting the cofilin pathway using Act-1 to restore  
T cell motility
Next, we investigated whether the 47 antibody is capable of restor-
ing T cell migration. First, we used R10015 to induce cofilin hyperacti-
vation to inhibit T cell chemotaxis (Fig. 3); we titrated R10015 on 
blood resting CD4 T cells of individual donors to determine an ac-
tive dosage (10 to 20 M) that can induce a low degree of cofilin 
hyperactivation (less than 50% reduction in p-cofilin), causing a 
mild 20 to 40% decrease in cell migration (Fig. 5, A and B). At these

dosages, R10015 did not affect the surface density of the 47 recep-
tor (fig. S4). Then, we used Act-1 to stimulate T cells in CXCL12- 
mediated chemotaxis. We found that the use of Act-1 (1 to 50 g/ml) 
restored T cell migration in the presence of R10015 (Fig. 5B), demon-
strating the capacity of the anti-47 antibody to rescue the migra-
tory defects resulting from cofilin hyperactivation. As controls, we 
also tested whether Act-1 is a chemoattractant for CD4 T cells and 
whether Act-1 can promote T cell migration in the absence of 
R10015 (fig. S5). We found that Act-1 was not capable of attracting 
CD4 T cells by itself, and nor could it stimulate significantly higher 
levels of T cell migration toward CXCL-12 in the absence of R10015 
(fig. S5).
We further investigated whether Act-1 specifically promoted the 
migration of the 47
+ CD4 T cells by examining the cell subpopu-
lation that migrated to the lower chamber of the Transwell plate 
(Fig. 5C). While R10015 inhibited the migration of all T cell sub-
types, unexpectedly, the inhibitory effect was greater in the 47
high 
CD4 T cells, selectively diminishing their percentage in the migrat-
ing cell population (from 8.90 to 4.52%) (Fig. 5C). Act-1 effectively 
restored T cell migration and increased the percentage of migrating 
47
high T cells from 4.52 to 12.0% (Fig. 5, C and D, and fig. S6). 
These results demonstrated that the motility of 47
+ CD4 T cells is 
prone to inhibition through blocking cofilin phosphorylation; the 
47
+ CD4 T cells may have a higher sensitivity to cofilin hyperacti-
vation likely because cofilin dysfunction can affect the outside-in 
and inside-out signaling from both the chemokine receptor and the 
integrin receptor. This cofilin-mediated migratory impairment can 
be rescued by the anti-47 antibody Act-1, which may act through 
synergistic signaling with chemokines to modulate the cofilin path-
way. For comparison, the percentage of the CCR7+ T cell subpopu-
lation was similarly analyzed and was found to be unchanged by 
R10015 and Act-1 (fig. S7). These results demonstrated that Act-1 
selectively restored and promoted the migration of the 47
high CD4 
T cells (Fig. 5C), whereas it did not selectively increase the migration 
of CCR7+ cells (fig. S7), suggesting that the signaling is likely trans-
duced through the 47 receptor rather than an unrelated receptor.
DISCUSSION
It has long been speculated that HIV binding to chemokine core-
ceptors may trigger aberrant G protein signaling and CD4 T cell 
pathogenesis (11). Nevertheless, this speculation has not been solid-
ified by experimental and clinical data. In this large clinical trial, we 
have demonstrated cofilin dephosphorylation occurring in the blood 
CD4 T cells of HIV-infected patients. Cofilin has been identified as 
a direct downstream target of HIV-mediated G protein signaling 
through the chemokine coreceptors (9). Cofilin hyperactivation can 
directly affect T cell migration (18), as cofilin is a major driver of 
actin treadmilling for cell motility (29). In HIV infection, selective 
impairment of CD4 but not CD8 T cell homing (2, 4) is a major 
hallmark of HIV-mediated T cell dysfunction (3), and this implies a 
direct role of cofilin dysregulation in HIV-mediated CD4 T cell 
pathogenesis. The molecular cue for this cofilin hyperactivation 
likely results from early viral signaling from HIV gp120 (9) and 
chronic immune activation later in the disease course (2). During 
acute HIV infection, gp120 levels are very high with active HIV rep-
lication. CD4 T cells are exposed to these high levels of gp120 for 
extended periods of time before ART initiation. During the asymp-
tomatic phase with ART, gp120 in the peripheral blood is at a low 
level. However, in infected lymphoid tissues, gp120 can be present 
in high concentrations (>300 pg/ml) and is estimated to be in the 
range of 10 pg/ml to 10 ng/ml (30). In addition, chronic immune 
activation persists even with ART. Thus, the combined effects of 
gp120 and chronic immune activation may exacerbate and polarize 
CD4 T cells toward an ART-irreversible pathogenic lineage. This 
HIV-mediated T cell polarization may resemble the irreversibility 
of T cell differentiation and lineage commitment following per-
sistent cytokine receptor signaling. For example, when T cells are 
stimulated with IL-12 or interferon- for an extended period of time, 
they are polarized to express a transcription factor, T-bet, the induc-
tion of which becomes irreversible. The ART irreversibility of cofilin 
hyperactivation also appears to resemble the establishment of the 
early immune activation set point that dictates subsequent CD4 
T cell dysfunction and depletion independent of viral load (1).
While ART alone cannot repair cofilin dysfunction (Fig. 2C), the 
combined use of ART plus the anti–human 47 integrin antibody 
Act-1 has been found to promote T cell motility and tissue repopu-
lation (7). Although high dosages of anti-integrin antibodies can 
block integrin-ligand interaction and inhibit cell migration, these 
antibodies can also initiate an outside-in signal (Fig. 4). In particular, 
if antibody affinity is not optimal or antibody is used at a nonsatu-
rating dosage, then such antibody-induced signaling may synergize 
with chemokine signaling to promote cell motility. In vivo, Act-1 
unexpectedly promoted the repopulation of monkey CD4 T cells in 
a wide variety of immune tissues including GITs (7), suggesting that

in this SIV infection setting, Act-1 was not effective at blocking 
T cell homing but rather may have triggered an outside-in signal to 
promote T cell chemotaxis.
Stimulation of integrin receptors has been known to trigger cy-
toskeletal signaling for cell adhesion and migration (31). Integrin 
signaling is connected to the actin cytoskeleton mainly through the 
activation of downstream Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), 
such as Rho, Rac, and CDC42, which then activate the cofilin ki-
nase, LIMK, to regulate cofilin phosphorylation (27, 31). The 47 
receptor has also been known to trigger actin signaling. Specifically, 
the cytoplasmic tail of the 4 integrin has been shown to directly 
bind to a cytoskeletal and scaffolding protein, paxilin, that is in-
volved in the activation of the Rho GTPase Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 
(32). Activation of these Rho GTPases can lead to the activation of 
LIMK to regulate cofilin phosphorylation. In addition, the cytoplas-
mic tail of the 7 integrin also directly binds to filamin A, a large 
actin cross-linking protein that connects transmembrane receptors 
with the actin cytoskeleton (33). These previous studies provide 
possible signaling mechanisms by which Act-1 may modulate the 
cofilin pathway to promote 47 T cell motility.
Given the time-dependent fluctuation of cofilin phosphoryl-
ation and dephosphorylation triggered by Act-1 stimulation 
(Fig. 4, C, H, and M), it is possible that Act-1 stimulation may result 
in the sequential activation of two pathways: one leading to the activa-
tion of the cofilin phosphatase (slingshot) and one leading to the acti-
vation of the cofilin kinase (LIMK). We also compared the degree 
of p-cofilin fluctuation from Act-1 stimulation (Fig. 4, C, H, and M) 
with that from CXCL12 stimulation (Fig. 4, B, G, and L) and ob-
served comparable p-cofilin changes. However, biologically, they 
are likely very different in terms of the spatial and temporal regula-
tion of cofilin phosphorylation. CXCL12 is a natural ligand to trig-
ger cofilin activity for chemotaxis, whereas Act-1–mediated cofilin 
activity is likely aberrant and not geared toward the precise regula-
tion of T cell motility. Thus, this Act-1–mediated cofilin activity may 
not have biological significance in enhancing normal T cell chemo-
taxis, but it could have therapeutic effects on promoting T cell mi-
gration when normal chemotactic signaling is defective.
A previous study by Teague and co-authors (34) has found that 
direct stimulation of T cells with Act-1 alone did not trigger T cell 
activation. However, when used with an anti-CD3 antibody, the two 
antibodies together resulted in T cell activation. We also confirmed 
that Act-1 alone cannot activate resting CD4 T cells (fig. S8). These 
results suggest that 47 signaling can serve as an accessory or co-
stimulatory signal, similar to what anti-CD28 costimulation does. It 
has been known that without anti-CD28 costimulation, the anti- 
CD3 stimulation alone cannot activate T cells by itself (35). Similarly, 
in the Teague study (34), without the anti-47 costimulation, the 
anti-CD3 stimulation alone also cannot activate T cells. Thus, both 
anti-CD28 and anti-47 stimulations share a similar accessory or 
costimulatory function. It has been known that the costimulatory 
function of anti-CD28 stimulation is to activate cofilin for the reorga-
nization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for the formation

of the immunologic synapse (IS) (36, 37); this cofilin-regulated IS 
formation stabilizes cell-cell contact for full T cell activation (38-40). 
These previous results demonstrate that the anti-47 stimulation 
can replace the costimulatory function of the anti-CD28 stimula-
tion, likely through similar activation of cofilin.
In our in vitro assay system, stimulation of CD4 T cells with Act-1 
can rescue the migratory defect caused by low levels of cofilin hyper-
activation (Fig. 5). However, if cofilin hyperactivation had progressed 
to a high level (50% or more decrease of p-cofilin), then Act-1 was 
not effective in restoring T cell motility (fig. S9). In addition to gp120, 
another viral protein, Nef, has also been shown to alter the cofilin 
pathway to cause cofilin dysfunction (41). It is expected that for 
HIV- 
infected T cells, higher levels of HIV activity would be associ-
ated with greater degrees of cofilin dysfunction. Thus, our results 
suggest that early treatments of both HIV infection and immune 
dysfunction are important to prevent T cell polarization toward a 
pathogenic state in which cofilin-mediated T cell migratory impair-
ment may become irreversible.
Early restoration of CD4 T cells in the gut has been shown to be 
associated with immune reconstitution and effective control of vi-
remia without the need for ART (7, 42). High levels of 47 are as-
sociated with memory T cell migration preferentially into mucosal 
tissues such as GITs (43), in which CD4 T cells are severely depleted 
during HIV/SIV infection (22, 23). A full CD4 T cell repopulation 
in the gut is rarely achieved with ART (3), and persistent cofilin 
hyperactivation is likely a major reason (2). A key T cell subpopula-
tion for maintaining mucosal integrity is the TH17 cells, which are 
depleted in both HIV infection and pathogenic SIV infection (44). 
Although ART restores the TH17 cells in the bloodstream, it does 
not lead to full reconstitution of the TH17 cells in the mucosal com-
partment (5). Virologically, TH17 cells are highly permissive to 
HIV-1, and this permissiveness is linked to the expression of CCR6, 
CCR5, CCR9, and 47 (45, 46). Recently, it has been shown that 
CCR6+ and CXCR3+ TH cells are impaired in trafficking from the 
blood stream to peripheral tissues (2), and these cells accumulate in 
the peripheral blood as a predominant viral reservoir (47). We also 
observed the accumulation of 47
high CD4 T cells in the peripheral 
blood of HIV-infected patients (HIV infection of 0.5 to 2 years, 
ART-free; fig. S10). Our results are consistent with a recent finding 
by Mavigner and co-authors (3), who have investigated the traffick-
ing of CD4+ T cells expressing the gut-homing receptors CCR9 and 
integrin 47, and found that these T cells remain in the circulation 
rather than repopulate the mucosa of the small intestine. In our 
study, we directly quantified the peripheral 47
hi CD4 T cells with 
the anti- 
47 antibody Act-1, which has been shown to promote 
T cell homing to the gut and other lymphoid tissues (7). However, 
the complete homing identity of these peripheral Act-1 high-staining 
T cells remains to be fully elucidated.
Here, we have demonstrated that stimulating blood CD4 T cells 
with the anti-47 antibody can modulate the cofilin pathway and 
repair the T cell migratory defect caused by cofilin hyperactivation 
(Fig. 5). Our study has thus opened a new avenue for testing novel 
therapeutics that use such a “kick and go” strategy to restore T cell 
migration and tissue repopulation for immune reconstitution and 
immune control of viremia. Therapeutically, targeting T cell motil-
ity and the cofilin pathway would bring at least two major benefits 
(Fig. 6): For uninfected cells, the restoration of cofilin phosphoryl-
ation and CD4 T cell circulation and homing to GALTs and other 
lymphoid tissues may help immune reconstitution, and for infected 
cells, the circulation and homing of these latent HIV+ cells to lym-
phoid tissues may lead to their reactivation and eventual contain-
ment by the restored immune system, reducing latent viral reservoirs 
persistent in the peripheral blood and in tissues. In sum, our study 
suggests that cofilin is a key molecule that needs to be therapeutically 
targeted to achieve a functional cure of HIV infection (48).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical study
All clinical study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ethics 
Review Committee of China Medical University (CMU), Shenyang, 
P. R. China, and written informed consent from each participant in 
the study was obtained. We initially enrolled and evaluated 200 
HIV-1–infected patients from the HIV patient cohort of the Key 
Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of the National Health and Family 
Planning Commission in The First Affiliated Hospital of CMU. 
Among the HIV-infected patients, 98 had no previous or current 
ART at the time of the p-cofilin profiling, and 102 had ongoing 
ART for over a year, but 4 of the ART-treated patients had a viral 
load greater than 1000 copies/ml and were excluded from the study 
for possible drug resistance. The CD4 T cell count and viral load of 
these subjects were measured every 3 months. One hundred age- 
and sex-matched HC were enrolled from the HIV voluntary coun-
seling and testing center of CMU. A summary of the subjects is listed 
in tables S1 and S2. Of the ART-naïve patients, 65 eventually re-
ceived ART at around 6 months after the p-cofilin profiling and 
were treated for more than a year. All of these patients receiving 
ART reached undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. ART-treated pa-
tients were further evaluated and categorized into IRs and INRs.

Fig. 6. Model of cofilin hyperactivation in HIV infection and therapeutic tar-
geting of the cofilin pathway. Early HIV signaling through chemokine corecep-
tors (CCR5 and CXCR4) and late chronic immune activation may trigger cofilin 
hyperactivation, impairing CD4 T cell migration and homing to lymphoid tissues 
such as GALTs. ART alone is not sufficient to restore T cell motility. For early, low 
levels of cofilin hyperactivation, stimulation of the upstream regulators of cofilin 
through antibodies (e.g., stimulating chemokine or integrin receptors such as the 
47 receptor), receptor agonists, or activators of G proteins and GTPases may re-
pair cofilin-mediated T cell migratory defect. For late, high levels of cofilin hyper-
activation, it may need to use LIMK (the cofilin kinase) activators or the cofilin 
phosphatase (slingshot) inhibitors to directly inhibit cofilin dephosphorylation to 
restore actin dynamics. Therapeutically, targeting cofilin to restore T cell motility 
may bring two major benefits: (i) For uninfected cells, the restoration of CD4 T cell 
circulation and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs may help immune re-
constitution; (ii) for latent HIV+ T cells, the restoration of T cell circulation and hom-
ing to lymphoid tissues may lead to their reactivation and eventual containment 
by the restored immune system, reducing latent viral reservoirs persistent in the 
peripheral blood and in tissues.

Both IRs and INRs were treated with ART for more than 1 year. IRs 
were those who had a CD4 T cell recovery greater than 20% and a 
CD4 T cell count more than 500 cells/l; INRs had a CD4 T cell re-
covery less than 20% or a CD4 T cell count less than 200 cells/l. For 
isolating blood resting CD4 T cells from study subjects, peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were freshly obtained from the 
subjects and purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifu-
gation, followed by negative isolation of resting CD4 T cells as pre-
viously described (9, 49). Briefly, monoclonal antibodies against 
human CD14, CD56, HLA-DR, CD8, CD11b, and CD19 (BD Bio-
sciences, San Jose, CA) were used. Antibody-bound cells were de-
pleted using Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Purified cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). One million resting CD4 T cells from 
each blood donor were lysed in 40 l of SDS/T-PER extraction buffer 
[Novex Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer, T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction 
Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol 
(Sigma-Aldrich)]. Cell lysates were heated at 100°C for 8 min, im-
mediately frozen and stored at −80°C, and then transported on dry 
ice to Theranostics Health (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for p-cofilin 
reverse-phase protein microarray (RPPA) analyses. A total of 296 
coded cell lysates were printed onto the microarrays and profiled; 
3 lysates did not generate readable signals and were excluded from 
data analyses.
Reverse-phase protein microarray
Cofilin RPPA printing and analyses of cell lysates were provided by 
Theranostics Health (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Details of RPPA 
have been published previously (25). The RPPA directly couples the 
phospho-cofilin detection antibody with highly sensitive amplifica-
tion systems that can yield detection sensitivities to fewer than 1000 
to 5000 molecules per spot with good linearity (correlation coeffi-
cient or R2 = 0.990 to 0.999) and interexperiment precision (R2 = 0.973). 
Published between-run and within-run analytical precision in our 
studies was 3 to 13% CV (coefficient of variation) (50). The RPPA 
technology has been developed and optimized for performance as a 
fluorescence-based calibrated assay, generally identical in design 
and analysis to standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay) or standard clinical immunoassays. Each array consisted of 
patient cell lysates printed in triplicate two-spot dilutions (neat and 
1:4), high and low controls printed in triplicate two-spot dilutions 
(neat and 1:4), and 6- to 10-point calibrators. The analyte concen-
tration was determined by extrapolation to a nonparametrically de-
termined curve fit of the calibration curve and reported in relative 
fluorescence units. For data normalization, each protein analyte 
value (relative p-cofilin value) was normalized to the total amount 
of protein printed on that spot with a fluorescent stain (Sypro Ruby 
Blot Stain; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that binds to the amne 
group of proteins without bias. The protein loading value was also 
obtained by a calibrated assay technique. This total protein calibra-
tor consisted of a protein lysate with a known concentration, which 
upon dilution spans the linear dynamic range of protein concentra-
tion. Each sample value was then extrapolated to the calibrator. The 
following were the quantified averages of the total protein levels 
from each test group: HIV (n = 98), 0.254; HIV + ART (n = 95), 
0.259; and HC (n = 100), 0.252. There are no statistically signifi-
cant differences in the total protein levels between the three groups 
(HC and HIV, P = 0.77; HC and HIV + ART, P = 0.51; HIV and 
HIV + ART, P = 0.64).
Purification of resting CD4 T subtypes from peripheral blood
All protocols involving human subjects were reviewed and approved 
by the George Mason University institutional review board. PBMCs 
were purified from the peripheral blood of HIV-negative donors by 
centrifugation in Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Corning, Corning, 
NY), and resting CD4 T cells were further purified by two rounds of 
negative selection as previously described (9, 49). Briefly, for the first- 
round depletion, monoclonal antibodies against human CD14, CD56 
and HLA-DR, DP, and DQ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were 
used. For the second-round depletion, monoclonal antibodies against 
human CD8, CD11b, and CD19 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) 
were used. Antibody-bound cells were depleted using Dynabeads 
Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For further negative 
selection of the memory and naïve CD4 T cell subsets, monoclonal 
antibody against either CD45RA (0.02 l per million cells) or CD45RO 
(0.1 l per million cells) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was added 
during the second round of depletion. Purified cells were cultured 
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated 
FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin (50 U/ml) (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA), and streptomycin (50 g/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA). Cells were rested overnight before infection or treatment. For 
47 surface receptor up-regulation, resting CD4 T cells were also 
cultured in IL-7 (5 ng/ml) for 3 days.
Cell lines and viruses
A3R5.7 cells were acquired from the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) AIDS Reagent Program. A3R5.7 cells were derived from A3.01, 
which naturally expresses CD4, CXCR4, and 47. HIV-1(AD8) was 
provided by M. A. Martin. Virus stocks of NLENG1-ES-IRES(NL4-3), 
NLENG1-ES-IRES(Yu2), and HIV-1(AD8) were prepared by trans-
fection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells with cloned 
proviral DNA as described (9, 49). Viral titer (TCID50) was deter-
mined on the Rev-dependent green fluorescent protein (GFP) indi-
cator cell (51), Rev-A3R5-GFP (Virongy, Manassas, VA). For viral 
infection of resting CD4 T cells, cells were infected with envelope- 
negative GFP reporter HIV-1 virus NLENG1-ES-IRES, pseudo- 
typed with NL4-3 or YU2 envelope. Infection was performed by 
spinoculation for 2 hours at 1200g of 400 virions particles per cell at 
37°C, in the presence of DEAE Dextran (5 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). 
After infection, cells were washed and incubated for 6 days with or 
without IL-7 (25 ng/ml; R&D Systems). T cells were stained with 
anti–CD45RO-Pacific Blue monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, 
San Jose, CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD45RO and 
GFP expression. For treatment of resting CD4 T cells with HIV(AD8), 
cells were pretreated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 1 hour at 37°C and then treated with HIV(AD8) (103.5 to 104.5 
TCID50 per million cells) for various times. Cells were fixed and 
stained for intracellular p-cofilin. For treatment of resting CD4 
T cells with HIV gp120 (IIIB) (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Toronto, 
Canada), cells were treated with 10 nM gp120 (IIIB) for various 
times. For treatment with HIV gp120(BAL) (from the NIH AIDS 
Reagent Program), resting memory CD4 T cells were treated with or 
without maraviroc (1 M) (from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program) 
for 1 hour at 37°C and then treated with HIV gp120(BAL) (100 nM) 
for various times.
Western blotting for p-cofilin and cofilin
One million cells were lysed in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA) followed by sonication. Samples were heated at 70°C

for 10 min, separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline 
(TBST) for 3 min and then blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 
5% milk. The blots were incubated with a mouse anti-cofilin antibody 
(1:1000 dilution; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and a rabbit anti–
phospho- 
cofilin (serine 3) antibody (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling) 
diluted in 3% milk-TBST and rocked overnight at 4°C. The blots were 
washed three times for 15 min and then incubated with DyLight 680 
goat anti-mouse and DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit antibodies (KPL, 
Gaithersburg, MD) (1:5000 diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 hour at 
4°C. The blots were washed three times for 15 min and scanned 
with the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences).
Intracellular p-cofilin staining and flow cytometry
One million cells were fixed, permeabilized, washed, and then 
stained with an anti-human p-cofilin antibody using an intracellular 
protein staining kit (a gift from Virongy, Manassas, VA) for 60 min 
at room temperature. Cells were washed twice and stained with 
Alexa Fluor 488–labeled chicken anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA). Cells were washed twice and then analyzed on a 
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Multiple donors were 
used for intracellular p-cofilin staining.
Surface staining of CXCR4, CCR7, and 47
Cells were stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)–labeled mouse anti- 
human CXCR4 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), a PE- 
labeled rat anti-human CCR7 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), 
or a mouse anti–human 47 integrin antibody (Act-1) (obtained 
from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program), followed by secondary anti-
body staining with Alexa Fluor 647–labeled goat anti-mouse anti-
bodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were stained on ice in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) for 30 min, washed with cold PBS–0.5% BSA, and then ana-
lyzed on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Chemotaxis assay
A half million cells were resuspended into 100 l of RPMI 1640 me-
dium and then added to the upper chamber of a 24-well Transwell 
plate (Corning, Corning, NY). The lower chamber was filled with 
600 l of medium premixed with CXCL12 (40 ng/ml). The plate was 
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, and then the upper chamber was re-
moved and cells in the lower chamber were counted. To ensure ac-
curate enumeration of cells, only Z2 Coulter Particle Count and Size 
Analyzer (Beckman Coulter) was used. Where indicated, different 
concentrations of R10015 (26) or DMSO were added to cell culture 
and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C before adding cells to the upper 
chamber. Cells were also treated with the anti–human 47 integrin 
antibody (Act-1) or the control mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
antibody for 15 min before adding cells to the upper chamber. Act-1 
was also added to the lower chamber (1 g/ml) with CXCL12 
(40 ng/ml). Multiple donors were used for the chemotaxis assay.
Statistical analysis
Statistical calculations were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 23. 
Categorical data were described and analyzed by frequency and 2 
test. For parametric comparison, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test 
was used to assess differences between groups during p-cofilin pro-
filing (Fig. 2). Spearman rank correlation tests were used to measure 
the correlations between variables. Unless otherwise stated, a P value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
