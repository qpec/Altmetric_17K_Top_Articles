Although viral RNA or infectious virions have been detected in 
the feces of individuals infected with human influenza A and 
B viruses (IAV/IBV), the mechanism of viral survival in the 
gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. We developed a model 
that attempts to recapitulate the conditions encountered by a 
swallowed virus. While IAV/IBV are vulnerable to simulated 
digestive juices (gastric acid and bile/pancreatic juice), highly 
viscous mucus protects viral RNA and virions, allowing the 
virus to retain its infectivity. Our results suggest that virions 
and RNA present in swallowed mucus are not inactivated or 
degraded by the gastrointestinal environment, allowing their 
detection in feces.
Keywords. Influenza; mucus; inactivation; feces; viscosity.
 
The majority of patients infected with seasonal influenza A and 
B viruses (IAV/IBV) show upper respiratory tract symptoms 
and general symptoms [1]; however, some individuals also have 
gastrointestinal symptoms [2]. Previous retrospective studies 
have detected IAV/IBV RNA in fecal samples from individu-
als in whom infectious enteritis was diagnosed after an upper 
respiratory infection [3–5], and prospective observational stud-
ies detected IAV RNA in fecal samples from IAV-infected adults 
[2, 6]. Moreover, infectious virions have also been isolated from 
fecal samples [2, 7, 8].
Although these findings suggest that IAV/IBV may infect 
the human intestinal tissue, the mechanism by which IAV/IBV 
retain their infectivity (defined on the basis of RNA detection) 
in feces remains unclear. Until this mechanism is elucidated, 
previous studies reporting IAV/IBV detection in feces should 
be interpreted with caution [9, 10].
IAV/IBV are enveloped viruses that are rapidly inactivated by 
low pH and vulnerable to surfactants such as soap and bile [11]. 
Therefore, IAV/IBV are thought to be susceptible to gastric acid 
and bile, making it unlikely that infectious virions will reach the 
lower gastrointestinal tract to be excreted in the feces. Usually, 
the mucus secreted by cells lining the intestinal tract serves to 
clear respiratory viruses, including IAV/IBV [12]. However, we 
hypothesized that viscous sputum or nasal discharge may pro-
tect the virions from the gastric acid, bile, and pancreatic juices, 
allowing for intact viruses to pass through the intestinal tract 
and maintain their infectivity.
Here, we tested this hypothesis as the potential mechanism 
protecting swallowed IAV/IBV from degradation in the gastro-
intestinal tract, which could explain the reports of virus detec-
tion in feces. In particular, the presence of infectious IAV/IBV 
or viral RNA in fecal samples suggests that sputum protects the 
virus from degradation by digestive juices. Therefore, we evalu-
ated the resistance of IAV RNA and infectious IAV/IBV in arti-
ficial mucus or sputum samples to simulated digestive juices. To 
this end, we developed a model to recapitulate the conditions 
encountered by a swallowed virus and exposed IAV/IBV to 
these conditions in the presence of artificial and natural mucus.
METHODS
Artificial mucus (guar gum or mucin from the porcine stom-
ach) was prepared at different viscosities (10, 50, 100, 500, 
1000, 2000, and 4000 mPa·s) at 37°C. Sputum samples were 
obtained from individuals in whom acute upper respiratory 
tract infection was diagnosed (ERB-C-634). The viscosity of 
the artificial mucus and sputum samples was measured using 
a Brookfield viscometer. The detailed methods are described in 
the Supplementary Materials.
In brief, 450 µL of simulated gastric acid (pH 2), simulated 
bile/pancreatic juice, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was 
added to 50 µL of virus in artificial mucus or saline (final virus 
titer, 1.0 × 106 focus-forming units [FFU]/mL) and incubated at 
37°C for 1, 2, or 4 hours. Next, 450 µL of simulated bile/pancre-
atic juice or PBS was added to 50 µL of virus in sputum samples, 
incubated at 37°C for 4 hours, and subjected to RNA extraction 
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis [2].
Moreover, 200 µL of simulated gastric acid (pH 2 or 3) or 
PBS was added to 50 µL of virus with artificial mucus or saline 
(final titer, 2.5 × 106 FFU/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour 
prior to neutralization with PBS (750 µL). Next, 200 µL of sim-
ulated bile/pancreatic juice or PBS was added to 200 µL of virus 
with artificial mucus or saline (final titer, 2.5 × 105 FFU/mL) 
and incubated at 37°C for 1, 2, or 4 hours before PBS addition 
(2400 µL), and the viral titers were determined. The inactivation

test was also performed under a low-titer condition, and the 
relationship between the IAV titer and RNA copy number was 
evaluated.
The titer ratio (or RNA copy ratio) was calculated as the ratio 
of virus titer (or RNA copy number) in the simulated digestive 
juices to that in PBS, reflecting the proportion of the virus (or 
RNA) that is not inactivated or degraded.
RESULTS
Artificial Mucus Protects Viral RNA From Simulated Digestive Juices
In the presence of both saline and artificial mucus (guar gum 
or mucin from the porcine stomach), IAV RNA was resistant 
to simulated gastric acid even after prolonged (1-, 2-, 3-, or 
4-hour) incubation (Figure 1A). However, IAV RNA was unsta-
ble in saline and low-viscosity (10 mPa·s) guar gum–based arti-
ficial mucus in the presence of simulated bile/pancreatic juice, 
as evidenced by a decrease of IAV RNA levels below the detec-
tion limit after 2 hours. In contrast, when IAV was incubated in 
the presence of relatively high-viscosity (100 and 1000 mPa·s) 
guar gum–based artificial mucus for 1, 2, or 4 hours, IAV RNA 
levels decreased over time but could be detected even after 4 
hours. A similar trend was observed for IAV prepared in the 
mucin-based artificial mucus treated with simulated bile/pan-
creatic juice (Figure 1B). These results indicate that high-viscos-
ity (100 and 1000 mPa·s) artificial mucus significantly protected 
IAV RNA from degradation by simulated bile/pancreatic juice 
(P < .001 for all comparisons).
Mucus From Sputum Samples Protects Viral RNA
The mean and median viscosities of 21 sputum samples 
were 995.2 mPa·s (range, 134.4–2294.1 mPa·s) and 1101.9 
mPa·s (interquartile range, 414.3–1423.4 mPa·s), respectively 
(Figure 1C). IAV RNA was detected in all 21 sputum samples 
after 4 hours of incubation (Figure 1D), indicating similar pro-
tection of IAV RNA against digestive juices by artificial and nat-
ural mucus.
Artificial Mucus Protects Infectious Virions From Simulated 
Digestive Juices
First, we evaluated the resistance of IAV/IBV (virions) in artifi-
cial mucus to simulated gastric acid. Incubation with simulated 
gastric acid (pH 3) completely inactivated both IAV (subtypes 
H3N2 and H1N1) and IBV in low-viscosity mucus (10 and 50 
mPa·s) and in saline. However, infectious viruses were detected 
in the samples with mucus viscosity ≥100 mPa·s, and the titer 
increased in proportion to the viscosity of the artificial mucus. 
After incubation in simulated gastric acid (pH 2), infectious 
viruses started to be detected at ≥1000 mPa·s, and the titer 
ratios increased with mucus viscosity, although they were lower 
than those at pH 3 (Figure 2A).
When viruses were mixed with mucin and simulated gastric 
acid (pH 3), infectious viruses were detected at ≥50 mPa·s, and 
the titer ratios increased with mucus viscosity. A similar pattern 
was observed for the simulated gastric acid at pH 2, although 
the virus titer ratios were slightly lower (Figure 2B).
Next, the resistance of IAV/IBV (virions) in artificial mucus 
to simulated bile/pancreatic juice was evaluated. When viruses 
were incubated in guar gum and simulated bile/pancreatic juice 
for 1 hour, both IAV (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1) and IBV were 
completely inactivated in saline, as well as in mucus with viscos-
ities of 10, 50, 100, and 500 mPa·s. However, infectious viruses 
were detected at ≥1000 mPa·s, and the titer ratio increased with 
mucus viscosity, reaching ≥0.05 at 2000 mPa·s for both viruses. 
A similar pattern was observed after incubation under the same 
conditions for 2 or 4 hours but with slightly reduced titer ratios 
(Figure 2C).
When the viruses were mixed with mucin and incubated in 
simulated bile/pancreatic juice for 1 hour, infectious viruses 
were detected at ≥100 mPa·s, and the titer ratio increased with 
mucus viscosity, reaching ≥0.1 at 2000 mPa·s for both viruses. 
As above, a similar pattern was observed with longer incuba-
tion (2 or 4 hours) with slightly reduced titer ratios (Figure 2D). 
Overall, these findings indicate that IAV/IBV remain infectious 
in mucus even after prolonged exposure to bile/pancreatic juice.
Finally, we determined the same pattern of resistance 
acquisition by IAV in artificial mucus to simulated digestive 
juices under a low-titer condition (Supplementary Figure 1). 
Moreover, in the inactivation test, the IAV RNA copy number 
was approximately 10–100 times the virus titer under the same 
conditions (Supplementary Figure 2).
Discussion
The 4 principal findings of the present study are as follows: (1) 
although viral RNA was resistant to simulated gastric acid for 4 
hours, it was degraded in simulated bile/pancreatic juice after 2 
hours; (2) highly viscous artificial or natural (sputum) mucus 
protected viral RNA from degradation by simulated bile/pan-
creatic juice for >4 hours; (3) infectious virions (IAV/IBV) were 
vulnerable to simulated digestive juices (gastric acid and bile/
pancreatic juice); and (4) highly viscous artificial mucus pro-
tected virions from degradation by simulated digestive juices, 
as evidenced by their maintained infectivity.
IAV and IBV are vulnerable to external environmental factors 
and are considered to become quickly inactivated and degraded 
in the gastrointestinal tract by gastric acid and bile/pancreatic 
juice [10], which should make the virus undetectable in feces. 
Indeed, our study showed that IAV and IBV were quickly inac-
tivated, and viral RNA was completely degraded and undetect-
able within 2 hours of incubation with simulated digestive juice. 
Since it takes at least 2 hours for ingested food to pass through 
the small intestine [13], even if high-titer IAV/IBV is swallowed, 
virions and their RNA should be completely inactivated and 
degraded in the intestine and should not be detectable in feces.

Therefore, a swallowed virus would only be detected in feces if 
certain protective mechanisms render it resistant to degrada-
tion in the gastrointestinal tract.
Here, we discovered that IAV/IBV become resistant to 
simulated gastric acid and bile/pancreatic juice in the sur-
roundings of artificial mucus with a relatively high viscosity.

To mimic viscoelastic body fluids such as sputum and nasal 
discharge, we created artificial mucus by using several types 
of solutes, which allowed us to exclude confounding factors 
(eg, solute properties). Even in the presence of simulated bile/
pancreatic juice, which reproduced the harsh gastrointestinal 
environment, viral RNA contained in the artificial mucus 
(imitating sputum, nasal discharge, and other mucous mem-
brane secretions) was not degraded and could be detected 
after >4 hours. Furthermore, IAV/IBV maintained in the 
artificial mucus were not inactivated and retained its infec-
tivity for at least 4 hours. When IAV/IBV infect and repli-

discharge) containing high-titer viruses would be swallowed, 
and our results suggest that the virions and RNA are not inac-
tivated/degraded by the gastrointestinal juices, which might 
be detectable in feces.
In the present study, mucus of a relatively high viscosity 
(≥100 mPa·s) was required for IAV/IBV to resist inactivation 
and degradation in the gastrointestinal environment (gas-
tric acid or bile/pancreatic juice). Moreover, a viscosity of 
100–1000 mPa·s was needed for the virions to maintain their 
infectivity in the presence of gastric acid or bile/pancreatic 
juice. All 21 sputum samples containing natural mucus with 
a viscosity of ≥100 mPa·s protected viral RNA from degrada-
tion by simulated bile/pancreatic juice. These results suggest 
a protective effect of artificial mucus, since the correlation 
between virus survival and mucus viscosity was similar for 
the artificial and natural mucus. Despite the assumed vulner-
ability of IAV/IBV to external conditions, several studies have 
suggested that retention of virus infectivity was possible for 
hours to days, depending on environmental conditions [14]. 
Our results show that the viscosity of the medium surround-
ing IAV/IBV directly affects the ability of the virus to resist 
harsh external environments, providing a foundation for fur-
ther research on the relationship between viral protection and 
mucus viscosity.
We modeled the natural situation of swallowing sputum or 
nasal discharge containing high-titer IAV/IBV, which occurs 
upon virus infection and proliferation in the upper respiratory 
tract. Our results provide an explanation for the detection of 
viral RNA and infectious virions in the feces of individuals 
infected with IAV/IBV. Previous studies reporting the fecal 
detection of virions and viral RNA suggested that the virus 
presence was not merely due to contamination but indicated 
its passage through the gastrointestinal tract after oral inva-
sion and subsequent swallowing [2–8]. Our results support this 
theory by demonstrating that viscous mucus protects IAV/IBV 
from inactivation in the gastrointestinal environment, account-
ing for detection of the virus in feces.
Moreover, avian influenza virus (A[H5N1]) was demon-
strated to be capable of infecting the intestine [15], suggesting 
the same potential for IAV/IBV. Since this transmission pathway 
would enable the virus protected by the mucus to reach intesti-
nal epithelial cells, it could be a major contributor to intestinal 
IAV/IBV infection in humans. We are currently developing a 
model to evaluate the possibility of intestinal IAV/IBV infection.
