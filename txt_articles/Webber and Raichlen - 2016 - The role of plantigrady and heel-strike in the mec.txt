The role of plantigrady and heel-strike in the mechanics and
energetics of human walking with implications for the evolution of
the human foot
James T. Webber* and David A. Raichlen
ABSTRACT
Human bipedal locomotion is characterized by a habitual heel-strike
(HS) plantigrade gait, yet the significance of walking foot-posture is
not well understood. To date, researchers have not fully investigated
the costs of non-heel-strike (NHS) walking. Therefore, we examined
walking speed, walk-to-run transition speed, estimated locomotor
costs (lower limb muscle volume activated during walking), impact
transient (rapid increase in ground force at touchdown) and effective
limb length (ELL) in subjects (n=14) who walked at self-selected
speeds using HS and NHS gaits. HS walking increases ELL
compared with NHS walking since the center of pressure translates
anteriorly from heel touchdown to toe-off. NHS gaits led to decreased
absolute walking speeds (P=0.012) and walk-to-run transition speeds
(P=0.0025), and increased estimated locomotor energy costs
(P<0.0001)

reduced locomotor costs and increased maximum walking speeds
in HS gaits are linked to the increased ELL compared with NHS
gaits. However, HS walking significantly increases impact transient
values at all speeds (P<0.0001). These trade-offs may be key to
understanding the functional benefits of HS walking. Given the
current debate over the locomotor mechanics of early hominins and
the range of foot landing postures used by nonhuman apes, we
suggest the consistent use of HS gaits provides key locomotor
advantages to striding bipeds and may have appeared early in
hominin evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Plantigrady is rare among cursorial mammals (Hildebrand and
Goslow, 1998), which typically utilize digitigrade or unguligrade
gaits to maximize limb length, which is a key determinant of the
energetic cost of locomotion (Hildebrand and Goslow, 1998; Kram
and Taylor, 1990; Pontzer, 2007a). Humans represent an exception
to this pattern (Cunningham et al., 2010) as we possess adaptations
for endurance terrestrial running (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004;
Carrier, 1984), combined with plantigrade feet and a prominent heel
strike (HS), during walking gaits, where the foot touches down heel
first on the calcaneal tuberosity in a dorsiflexed posture, without
mid- or forefoot contact. Given the importance of limb length to
cursorial mammals, it is uncertain why humans use a plantigrade
foot posture with a consistent HS during walking (Cunningham
et al., 2010).
A popular hypothesis is that the human HS gait evolved to reduce
the energy costs of walking (Cunningham et al., 2010; Usherwood
et al., 2012). This hypothesis is supported by studies showing
subjects had relatively high energy costs of locomotion (COL) when
asked to walk with digitigrade foot postures compared with typical
plantigrade HS walking (Cunningham et al., 2010). Yet, human
lower limb anatomy is not adapted for full digitigrady and it is
possible that these experiments captured the energetic costs of novel
gaits. Non-human apes may offer more context into how and why
habitual HS walking evolved in humans because we often assume
that traits shared among apes may have been present in our pre-
bipedal ancestors. Extant non-human apes use an array of
plantigrade walking gaits, some of which lack consistent heel
strikes (Schmitt and Larson, 1995). For example, researchers have
shown that our closest living relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and
common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), use a wide range of
landing postures, from a traditional human-like heel strike, to
landings where the heel does not touch down until the second half of
stance phase (see Elftman and Manter, 1935; Vereecke et al., 2003).
Most often, these apes use gaits where the heel and mid-foot contact
the ground simultaneously, which also differ from human HS
walking where initial ground contact is made by the heel alone
(Elftman and Manter, 1935; Vereecke et al., 2003). Thus, the key
human evolutionary shift from the non-hominin ape foot landings
appears to be the consistent use of heel-only landing postures.
The goal of this study is to better understand the advantages and
disadvantages of this shift to consistent HS gaits. To accomplish this
goal, we measured the mechanics and energetics of human walking
with the two footfall extremes seen in ape-like plantigrade walking:
an HS, where touchdown occurs with the heel only, and a non-heel
strike (NHS), where initial ground contact occurs at mid-foot and
the heel lands later in stance. Interestingly, although humans do not
habitually walk with either digitigrade or more ape-like gaits,
Lieberman et al. (2010) found that many individuals adopt NHS
gaits at running speeds, similar to those used at times by nonhuman
apes. Running with an HS foot posture produces rapid and
potentially dangerous increases in the ground reaction force
(GRF), known as an impact transient (IT), just after the heel
impacts the ground (Lieberman et al., 2010). NHS footfalls seem to
benefit runners by reducing ITs at higher locomotor speeds

(Lieberman, 2012) without increasing locomotor costs (Divert
et al., 2005, 2008; Franz et al., 2012; Kram and Franz, 2012). By
specifically exploring the possible benefits of using an HS at slow
locomotor speeds, we hope to better understand why a consistent

 HS evolved in our bipedal ancestors, and whether NHS gaits offer
any advantages that may explan their occasional use in other apes.
Plantigrade walking and effective limb length
As noted by Cunningham et al. (2010), human use of plantigrade
foot postures is unique among organisms adapted for long distance
travel since plantigrady reduces hindlimb length compared with
digitigrade postures. Limb length is a key determinant of walking
mechanics and energetics because when modeled as an inverted
pendulum, the limb acts as a strut during stance phase, with the
center of mass vaulting over the point of ground contact (Alexander,
1976; Gray, 1944; Kuo, 2001; Pontzer, 2005). Long limbs reduce
energy costs in this model by increasing step lengths, which leads to
longer time periods for accelerating the center of mass and reduced
rates of force generation (Pontzer, 2007a).
Characterizing the effects of plantigrade HS walking on the
length of the pendulum strut may help to explain why this footfall
pattern evolved. Researchers typically use either a linear sum of
skeletal elements (Steudel and Beattie, 1995), the height of the hip
in quiet stance (Pontzer, 2007a) or hip height at mid-stance during
locomotion to describe effective limb length (ELL: average length
of the strut over a step). These lengths assume the pivot point of the
inverted pendulum is fixed at ground contact and therefore
plantigrady should reduce ELL compared with digitigrade foot
postures. However, the pivot point translates anteriorly during a step
[i.e. the center of pressure (COP) shifts continuously throughout the
stance phase] in plantigrade walkers. Pontzer (2007b) suggested that
a significant anterior shift in the COP throughout the step (COPc;
see Fig. 1) may actually increase the ELL because the pivot point of
the inverted pendulum strut would occur significantly below the
foot (see Fig. 1B; Pontzer, 2007b). Additionally, Pontzer (2007b)
showed that an estimate of ELL that took COP translation into
account (L′) was a significantly better predictor of the force required
to accelerate the center of mass during walking than hip height alone
in humans.
Based on this view of ELL, an HS walking gait with a plantigrade
foot may significantly increase the length of an inverted pendulum
strut, even if this foot posture reduces hip height from the ground in
quiet stance. Compared with the consistent use of an HS gait in
humans, many of the foot postures used by nonhuman apes lead to
reduced total translation of the COP (Vereecke et al., 2003). For
example, when bonobos land on both the heel and midfoot
simultaneously (Elftman and Manter, 1935; Vereecke et al., 2003,
2005), the COP originates between the heel and forefoot, rather than
directly under the heel. Therefore, a consistent HS landing posture
that maximizes COP translation may be a novel evolutionary
solution to lengthening inverted pendulum struts from an ape-like
ancestral condition.
We use the dynamic similarity hypothesis (DSH) to test this
model of inverted pendulum strut length. The DSH suggests that
the motions of two animals are comparable if they can be made
similar through dimensional scaling (Alexander and Jayes, 1983).
Dimensionless parameters can be compared at speeds where the
ratios of inertial to gravitational forces acting on two moving
systems are equal. This condition is met when organisms walk at the
same Froude number (Fr; Alexander, 1989):
Fr ¼ v2
gL ;
ð1Þ
where v is velocity (m s−1), g is gravitational acceleration
(9.81 m s−2) and L is a characteristic length. Most researchers
assume hip height represents the length of the pendulum strut when
applying the DSH to animal locomotion. However, if Pontzer’s
(2007b) analysis is correct, researchers should instead use the length
of the strut calculated from the true pivot point of the inverted
pendulum (L′). In this study we use both L and L′ in calculations of
Fr to compare HS and NHS human walking movements in the same
subjects. This analysis will help us to determine whether differences

 in mechanics and energetics between these gaits are due primarily to
differences in the length of the inverted pendulum strut. If this
hypothesis is supported, mechanical differences between footfall
patterns found when calculating Fr using L should disappear when
subjects walk at comparable Fr numbers calculated with L′.
Here, we examine two potential benefits of HS walking and one
potential cost using this dynamic similarity analysis. First, since
previous work suggests that ELL is a main determinant of the costs
of locomotion (as described above, see Kram and Taylor, 1990;
Pontzer, 2007b), we determined the effects of HS and NHS walking
on estimates of the energy costs of locomotion. Second, we
measured the effects of foot-contact posture on the walk-to-run
(WTR) transition speed. Changes in ELL should affect WTR
transitions because bipeds transition to running gaits at dynamically
similar speeds, dependent largely on limb length and gravity (Kram
et al., 1997; Raichlen, 2008; Usherwood, 2005). Finally, we explore
the possibility that NHS gaits may reduce ITs at walking speeds,
similar to the effects of NHS gaits on ITs at running speeds (see
Lieberman et al., 2010).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Fourteen adults (7 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 23.7±
4.4 years and body mass of 69.2±16.6 kg took part in this study. All
subjects were healthy and free of injury at the time of the study. In
order to avoid confounding variables, dancers and individuals with
experience running barefoot or in minimalist shoes were not
selected to participate in this study. Subjects performed all tasks
barefoot. Prior to starting, the details of the study were explained to
all participants and informed consent (approved by the University of
Arizona Institutional Review Board) was provided.
Foot posture kinematic and kinetic data collection
The study consisted of two separate experimental activities. The first
task involved walking along a 4 m trackway across a range of speeds
under two conditions: (1) landing with a HS (see Fig. 2A), and (2)
landing with a NHS foot posture at initial contact (see Fig. 2B; circles
highlight estimated COP translation shortly after touchdown).
Subjects were first instructed to walk (HS) at their self-selected,
preferred walking speed for 5 trials (1.14±0.15 m s−1). The same
procedure was followed for a slow self-selected walking speed
(0.78±0.18 m s−1) and a fast self-selected walking speed (1.47±
0.21 m s−1). After the first three conditions were met, subjects were
directed to walk with a NHS gait, contacting the ground with the
distal metatarsal heads (balls of the foot) initially instead of the heel,
with heel contact occurring later in the step (see Fig. 2B). This foot
posture was demonstrated to the subjects after a verbal explanation.
Subjects performed practice trial walks to adjust to this change in gait
before data collection began. As with the HS trials, subjects were
instructed to walk at self-selected, preferred (1.01±0.20 m s−1), slow
(0.78±0.19 m s−1) and fast (1.31±0.21 m s−1) speeds.
Kinematic data were collected at 200 Hz using a Vicon high-
speed, six-camera, motion capture system (Hauppauge, NY).
Twenty-four reflective markers were affixed to the subjects at
joint centers, limb segments, and foot landmarks including the first
and fifth distal metatarsal heads, lateral ankle, and heel. An AMTI
multi-axis force plate (Watertown, MA) embedded midway along
the track collected kinetic data at 4 kHz. A successful trial required
complete, single-foot contact with the force plate using the specified
foot-strike. Trial data were averaged at each speed and foot-posture
before data analysis.
L was calculated from the average hip height (m) throughout a step
following Pontzer (2007b). L′ was calculated two ways. First,
following Pontzer (2007b), L′ was calculated trigonometrically at
touchdown and toe-off using the distance in meters the COP traveled
in the sagittal plane (between touchdown and toe-off) and hip
excursion angle (see Fig. 1C). The two limb lengths obtained from
touchdown and toe-off were averaged to produce an L′ during stance.
Second, L′ was calculated dynamically as the distance between the
hip and the average intersection point for all hip-to-COP vectors for
each motion analysis frame of the step. Dynamically calculated (DC)
L′ was calculated as the average intersection point between all hip-to-
COP vectors throughout the step. Kinetic data at 4 kHz were
resampled to match the kinematic data collected at 200 Hz. For every
frame (200 frames s−1), a vector from the greater trochanter marker to
the center of pressure was calculated in the sagittal plane. The
intersections (pivot of the strut for the inverted pendulum between
any two points) of all combinations of vectors were calculated and
then averaged. Limb length was then calculated for each frame of the
step from the hip joint marker to the average pivot point in the sagittal
plane. While values were similar between subjects, dynamically
calculated limb lengths were significantly longer than those
calculated from touchdown and toe-off only (P<0.001). However,
as noted below, results of locomotor comparisons between HS and
NHS gaits do not change when using either the two-point method or
the dynamic method. This method provided similar results to the
method introduced by Pontzer (2007b; see Fig. S3 for results using
the second, DC method).
Active muscle volume and estimated cost of locomotion
The energy cost of activating muscle to support the body was used
as an estimation of the metabolic cost of locomotion ( _

including bipedal birds, quadrupedal mammals, and humans

1998a,b; Sockol et al., 2007; Taylor, 1994; Wright and Weyand,
2001). Inverse dynamics (performed in MATLAB, MathWorks)
was used to estimate the change in muscle force production due to
differences in foot-posture. _

 (Roberts et al., 1998b). Since k is a constant at most walking speeds
(Griffin et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 1998b), it was excluded from our
calculation of _
ECOL.
Vmusc is the product of muscle fascicle length (lfasc, cm), and the
cross sectional area (A, cm2) of activated muscle (Pontzeret al., 2009;
Sockol et al., 2007). Here, average muscle group lfasc was calculated
following Bieweneret al. (2004) and scaled to body mass for subjects
in this study. A is proportional to the muscle force (Fmusc) produced
during walking and is calculated as the muscle force (N) required to
extend the limb in response to flexion moments (M) at a specific
joint, and the constant σ (where σ is muscle force per unit cross-
sectional area, N cm−2) (Biewener et al., 2004). To estimate costs
across experimental conditions, we assume σ remains constant
despite differences in joint angles during stance phase when walking
with an HS and NHS gaits. This assumption is supported by previous
studies that have used this model to successfully predict energy costs
in humans and other mammals walking and running with different
limb joint postures (Foster et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2010; Sockol et al.,
2007; Wright and Weyand, 2001).
Fmusc is determined by calculating external moments (M) acting
at each joint (Biewener et al., 2004). Moments were calculated using
GRF vectors, limb segment accelerations, and flexion moments
arising from two-joint muscles (Biewener et al., 2004; Winter,
2009). The finite differences method was used to calculate
segmental acceleration (Winter, 2009), and limb segment inertial
properties were estimated following Winter (2009). Net moments
were calculated at each lower limb joint using the free-body method
(Winter, 2009). The extensor muscle forces at each joint (hip, knee,
and ankle) balancing these moments were calculated following
equations in Biewener et al. (2004):
Mankle ¼ Fankle rankle;
ð3Þ
Mknee¼ Fknee rknee� FðGÞknee rðGÞknee� FðHÞknee rðHÞknee;
ð4Þ
Mhip ¼ Fhip rhip � FðRFÞhip rðRFÞhip;
ð5Þ
where G (gastrocnemius), H (hamstrings) and RF (rectus femoris)
are muscles acting on two joints and forces are calculated assuming
the force produced by each is proportional to their physiological
cross-sectional area (Biewener et al., 2004). Human anatomical
moment arms were calculated from equations that relate moment
arms to joint angles (Németh and Ohlsén, 1985; Rugg et al., 1990;
Visser et al., 1990) and scaled to segment length. Relating moment
arms to joint angles allows for an estimation of anatomical moments
rmusc, while joint angles change during locomotion. Finally,
following Biewener et al. (2004), muscle force impulses were
divided by the GRF impulse to calculate the total volume of active
muscle for use in Eqn 2:

Treadmill walk-to-run speed determination
Subjects were also asked to participate in two separate WTR speed
determination procedures, which were modified from Farinatti and
Monteiro (2010). Initially, subjects became accustomed to walking
on a treadmill (SOLE Fitness, Salt Lake City, UT) with a 5 min
warm up. The warm-up consisted of a non-recorded walk at a speed
of 1.33 m s−1. Once subjects completed the warm up, a covering
was placed over the treadmill display, blocking time and speed data
from the subject. Subjects started the WTR protocol using a
programmed treadmill function, which began at a speed of
1.52 m s−1
and
increased
by
0.089 m s−1
every
30 s.
The
transition speed was recorded only when subjects ran a complete
30 s interval, giving them time to switch back to walking if running
at the speed felt awkward to ensure a complete transition to running.
The test was then stopped and the subjects went back to walking at
1.33 m s−1 for a 5 min cool down. Subjects then repeated the WTR
trial using an NHS gait. For the second WTR trial, subjects were
asked to walk with the same forefoot gait used in the motion capture
walkway trials.
Data analysis
To determine whether the effects of HS on walking mechanics and
energetics are due mainly to increased ELL (see Fig. 1), we
compared locomotor variables at Froude numbers calculated with
hip height (L), and L′. Fr using L, and Fr′ using L′, were calculated
and compared for each motion capture trial between each self-
selected speed category (slow, preferred and fast) for both foot
postures to examine the role of ELL in determining the energy costs
and speed of walking.
Between-subject and between-speed differences were tested for
Fr, Fr′, L, and L′ with a repeated-measures two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test, using foot-posture and self-selected speed
category (as multiple conditions). The relationship between Fr, Fr′
and _
ECOL, and Fr′ and IT, were tested using linear mixed-effects
analyses with Fror Fr′, foot posture (HS versus NHS) and ITas fixed
effects, and subject as a random effect having an interaction with foot
posture. Associated P-values were found by likelihood ratio tests of
the full model versus the model without the effects in question. The
WTR transition speed was compared between HS and NHS trials
with a Student’s t-test. For all tests, level of significance was 0.05.
RESULTS
Effective limb length and dynamic similarity
We hypothesized that NHS walking would lead to a shorter L′,
forcing subjects to walk at lower absolute speeds. Indeed, L′ was
significantly shorter in NHS trials (Fig. 3; −0.185±0.029 m,
F1,13=459.8, P<0.0001). Additionally, human HS plantigrade gaits
increased L′ significantly more than adding the utilized length of the
foot to the hindlimb, as in a digitigrade gait (the limb length gained
by the translating pivot point was 24.19±7.16% higher than the sum
of foot length and hip height, P<0.0001). This estimate is likely to be

sagittal plane) would not simply be added to total limb length in a
true digitigrade gait. DC L′ was also significantly shorter in NHS
trials (see Fig. S1; −0.247±0.109 m, P<0.0001) when compared
with HS trials at preferred walking speeds.

categories
(F1,13=8.43; P=0.012), however, post hoc tests showed that the
slow walking speeds were not significantly different (P=0.49). HS
Fr values (using hip height) were also significantly higher
compared with NHS postures at any given self-selected speed
(Fig. 4A; F1,13=8.78; P=0.011), yet there was no significant
difference between HS and NHS Fr′ [calculated using plantigrade
adjusted ELL (L′)] in self-selected speeds (Fig. 4B; F1,13=0.543,
P=0.4744). There was no significant difference between DC HS and
NHS Fr′ (see Fig. S2; slow, P=0.10; preferred, P=0.48; fast,
P=0.87).
Estimated cost of locomotion
Estimated cost of locomotion ( _
ECOL; see Eqn 2) was increased by an
average of 0.029±0.007 cm3 N s−1 at all speeds by NHS walking
[Fig. 5A; χ2(1)=9.92, P=0.0016] when using Fr. However, foot
posture had no significant effect on _
ECOL when Fr′ was used to
adjust for effective limb length [Fig. 5B; χ2(1)=1.26, P=0.2614].
These results suggest the effects of foot posture on the energetics of
walking are due in some part to the increased ELL associated with a
HS gait. _
ECOL was not significantly different between HS and NHS
footfalls after calculating limb length dynamically [see Fig. S3;
χ2(1)=0.19, P=0.6660].
Walk-to-run transition
NHS gait WTR transition speeds (m s−1) were significantly
lower than HS gaits (P=0.0025), and therefore subjects transitioned
to running at a significantly higher Fr during HS walking
(HS=0.426±0.055, NHS=0.365±0.045, P=0.0025). However, when
taking into account L′, there were no significant differences in Fr′ at
the WTR transition (Fig. 6; HS=0.322±0.038, NHS=0.319±0.041
P=0.43). Thus, the differences in WTR transition speed between HS
and NHS walking appear to be due to the effects of foot posture on
ELL. DC dimensionless Fr′ WTR transition speeds were not
statistically different between HS and NHS (see Fig. S4; P=0.34).
Impact transient
NHS walking reduced impact transients by an average of
0.447±0.031 bodyweights compared with HS walking (Fig. 7;
χ12=98.79, P<0.0001). Similar to running (Lieberman et al., 2010),
subjects displayed minimal IT values (Fig. 7) during NHS walking

greater variation and increased with speed (Fig. 7; range, 0.23–1.43
bodyweights).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the effects of both plantigrady and HS on the
human walking gait. By experimentally altering foot posture during
walking, we measured the effects of intra-individual limb length
changes on walking mechanics (i.e. L versus L′ under different
conditions). A plantigrade foot and HS ground contact lengthens the
effective limb (21.9±3.9% compared with NHS L′) by shifting the
COP anteriorly across the entire length of the foot throughout stance.
Our results suggest that HS walking plays an important role in
minimizing energetic costs during walking, which is aided by
lengthening ELL (L′). As hypothesized, energy and speed
differences between HS and NHS walking lose significance once
L′ is used to calculate Fr′. Thus, if human HS and NHS walkers
were two different organisms with limb lengths adjusted for COP
translation, we would conclude that their locomotor costs scale
appropriately with limb length regardless of foot morphology or
speed. Additionally calculating L′ using data from across the step,
both dynamically and using a two-point, touchdown and toe-off
method, shows that translation of the COP effectively lengthens the
inverted pendulum strut. While both methods are valid, we suggest
that for ease of use by future researchers, the two-point method of
calculating L′ is appropriate for most studies.
Our data also support the importance of ELL (and therefore foot-
posture) in determining WTR transition speed. The reduction in
transition speed during NHS walking is well explained by the
increased L′ in HS compared with NHS walking. Using L′, Fr′ at the
WTR transition does not differ significantly between HS and NHS
walking, even though absolute transition speeds are statistically
different. Not surprisingly, because of the importance of limb length
in calculation of Fr, the Fr′ at which subjects transitioned from
walking to running calculated using L′ was lower than values from
previous research (Hreljac et al., 2008; Kram et al., 1997;
Thorstensson and Roberthson, 1987). Increased ELL due to HS
gaits reduced Fr′ at the WTR transition to 0.322±0.038, which is
close to values found for the walk-to-trot transition for horses across
a broad size range (Fr≈0.30–0.37) (Griffin et al., 2004). These
results raise an intriguing suggestion that one advantage of HS foot-
posture is an increase in range of available walking speeds, delaying
the transition to a running gait.
While there are important benefits to using an HS gait, we also
found that NHS postures effectively reduce ITs during walking,
similar to results of studies examining ITs in NHS running gaits
(Lieberman et al., 2010). These results suggest that the evolution of
consistent HS walking in our hominin ancestors came with trade-
offs and that foot anatomy specific to our lineage (e.g. a robust
calcaneal tuberosity) may reflect the tolerance of consistently high
ITs (see Gebo, 1992; Latimer and Lovejoy, 1989).
Study limitations
While our results support the notion that there are trade-offs between
energy cost and impact forces in HS and NHS walking, the
estimation of energy costs from the inverse dynamics analysis relies
on key assumptions that require further testing. As noted by Roberts
et al. (1998b) when developing this method, the link between active
muscle volume and the metabolic costs of locomotion relies on the
assumption that muscle force produced per unit of cross-sectional
area (σ) remains constant across experimental conditions. Within an
individual,
this
assumption
is
upheld
across
experimental
conditions if muscles operate with similar relative shortening
velocities (v/vmax) and in similar regions of the muscle force-length
curve. If these assumptions are violated, the same muscle might
activate different amounts of volume to generate a given force under
different experimental conditions. In our study, it is possible that
changes in ankle and knee kinematics lead to muscle activation at
different shortening velocities or different portions of the force–
length curve, which would limit our ability to estimate the energy
costs of walking between gaits with very different limb postures.
Previous work has shown that comparisons between humans and
other mammals walking and running with different joint postures do
not violate these assumptions. As described earlier, estimates of
active muscle volume seem to reflect the energy costs of both
walking and running in the same individuals (see Biewener et al.,
2004; Ren et al., 2010). Thus, differences in joint angles during
stance across speeds do not significantly affect the use of this model.
This method also accounts for energy cost differences within
individuals using fundamentally different gaits. For example,
despite key difference in joint posture (Pontzer et al., 2014),
between-gait differences in active muscle volume in chimpanzees
walking bipedally and quadrupedally explain differences in
metabolic cost measured through oxygen consumption (Sockol
et al., 2007). Similarly, metabolic costs and active muscle volumes
increased proportionally in humans walking with a flexed-knee and
hip gait compared with humans walking with normal extended-limb
bipedalism (Carey and Crompton, 2005; Foster et al., 2013). This
‘groucho’ gait is an entirely novel gait pattern with limb joints acting
at different levels of flexion during stance phase. Finally, Wright
and Weyand (2001) compared active muscle volume and metabolic
costs in forwards and backwards running. The heel touches down
after the toes in backwards running, making it a novel gait, and yet
the increased metabolic costs were matched by the same percentage
increase in active muscle volume (Wright and Weyand, 2001).
Therefore, while we did not test the assumptions of the active
muscle volume model using direct measures of metabolic cost, we
believe there is strong support for its use here, and this method
provides an important perspective on the potential energetic
advantages of walking with a consistent HS.
Evolutionary implications of HS walking

 bipedal gaits, we believe it is likely that our pre-bipedal ancestors
also experienced variation in foot postures at touchdown, including
both human-like HS, initial contact with the heel and midfoot
simultaneously, and NHS walking, as examined here. If true, the
evolution of consistent HS walking occurred some time within the
hominin lineage, either with the earliest bipeds, or later in human
evolution. By focusing on the two extreme foot postures described
for nonhuman apes (HS and NHS), we have highlighted the effects
of COP translation during the stance phase on locomotor
biomechanics. In doing so, we have shown that a shift to a
consistent HS, as we suspect occurred during early human
evolution, has advantages over plantigrade species that use gaits
with more minimal COP translations.
Foot anatomy in early hominins suggests that the use of a
consistent HS may have been beneficial across much of human
evolutionary history. While the feet of early bipeds lack derived
features seen in the genus Homo that allow for effective endurance
running, they may have been well adapted to HS walking (Bramble
and Lieberman, 2004; Spoor et al., 1994). For example, the
relatively short toes, and therefore shorter feet, seen in modern
humans are advantageous to endurance running because they reduce
plantar–flexor moments at the metatarso–phalangeal joints (Rolian
et al., 2009) and probably evolved with the origins of the Homo
genus. Australopithecus, a hominin genus that preceded Homo, had
relatively long feet, which Rolian et al. (2009) hypothesize would
have detracted from running performance. Our results suggest that
relatively long feet in australopithecines may have led to improved
walking performance through increased translation of the COP, and
therefore increased ELL. Thus, foot proportions in fossil hominins
may reflect competing selection pressures for walking and
endurance running.
This hypothesis requires a walking gait with consistent human-
like HS in species with relatively long feet. The Laetoli footprints
(fossilized footprints found in volcanic ash at Laetoli, Tanzania) are
perhaps the best indicator that, by at least 3.6 million years ago,
ancient hominins walked with an HS (Leakey, 1981; Leakey and
Hay, 1979; Raichlen et al., 2010). Most researchers believe these
footprints were made by Australopithecus afarensis, and while
complete fossil feet are rare in the early hominin fossil record,
estimated foot lengths suggest that these early bipeds had relatively
long feet compared with modern humans (Sellers et al., 2005). By
combining estimated foot lengths with COPc (see Fig. 1) and hip
excursion data collected here, it is possible to predict how increased
foot length would have altered L′ in these early bipeds. Based on
fossil limb lengths and estimates of foot length (Jungers, 1988;
Sellers et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004), A. afarensis (AL 288-1) had
an L′ of ≈0.725 m when using HS gaits, an increase of ≈40.4%
from L for this species (≈0.516 m). In our sample of modern
humans, calculations of L′ increased effective limb length by
32.6±3.3% compared with L. Thus, the relatively long feet of
A. afarensis led to a greater increase in L′ compared with modern
humans.
While long feet may have improved walking performance for
A. afarensis, other early bipeds may have walked without using an
HS. For example, Australopithecus sediba, a South African hominin
living approximately 2 million years ago (Dirks et al., 2010),
exhibits foot and ankle morphology suggestive of more ape-like foot
postures (Desilva et al., 2012; Zipfel et al., 2011). These features
include gracile calcaneal tubers, increased mid-foot mobility,
medial plantar processes indicative of pedal grasping ability, and
an ability to invert the foot similar to extant great apes during
vertical climbing (Desilva et al., 2012; Zipfel et al., 2011). These
traits may improve climbing performance while putting less stable
foot and ankle joints at a higher risk of injury in the presence of large
impact forces during HS walking. Our results suggest that retaining
NHS postures as part of their footstrike repertoire may have allowed
A. sediba to maintain climbing ability by reducing impact transients.
Although reductions in foot length occurred with the evolution of
the
genus
Homo,
possibly
to
improve
endurance
running
performance (Rolian et al., 2009), variation in foot length
suggests the advantages of a long L′ may have persisted in some
species until relatively recently. For example, Homo floresiensis, a
small-bodied hominin living on the island of Flores (Morwood
et al., 2004), possessed relatively long feet compared with other
members of the genus Homo (Jungers et al., 2009a). The foot of H.
floresiensis (LB1) is roughly 70% of the length of its femur (Jungers
et al., 2009a), which is exceptional compared with modern human
foot lengths (54% of femur length) (White and Suwa, 1987). The
long foot of H. floresiensis (Jungers et al., 2009b) would increase L′
to ≈0.797 m, a ≈43.6% increase from hip height (L≈0.555 m). Our
sample of modern humans produced an average L′ of 1.18±0.06 m
(L=0.90±0.05 m) for comparison.
Finally, Homo neanderthalensis feet display a unique mix of
short toes (Trinkaus and Hilton, 1996) and long calcaneal tubers
(Miller and Gross, 1998; Raichlen et al., 2011; Schmitt, 1998;
Trinkaus, 1975, 1983). The inclusion of short, robust limbs
(Holliday, 1997; Trinkaus, 1981) suggests that Neanderthals were
lackluster runners compared with modern humans, raising future
research questions about Neanderthal L′ and the selective pressures
on walking/running. Thus, our results provide a novel view of foot
length in the evolution of human walking and allow us to generate
new, testable hypotheses for inter-specific variation in energy costs
of walking throughout the human lineage.
Conclusions
This study shows that human NHS walking decreases the anterior
translation of the COP along the foot, shortening ELL (L′).
Adopting a plantarflexed foot posture at touchdown forced subjects
to walk at a slower absolute speed, yet did not change the
dynamically similar foot posture adjusted Fr′ or estimated COL.
Additionally, NHS gaits reduced absolute WTR transition speeds
but not WTR Fr′ compared with HS walking.
A long rigid foot may have been important to early bipeds by
increasing walking speed in species that lack adaptations for
endurance running. Our results suggest that both HS gaits and a
relatively long rigid foot may have lengthened L′ in early bipeds,
thereby increasing maximum walking speed without affecting
locomotor costs. While this was likely true for striding taxa like A.
afarensis, other early bipeds, such as A. sediba may have retained
NHS gaits as part of their variation in foot-landing postures to
preserve an arboreal lifestyle, with reduced impact transients
allowing for skeletal features of the feet best suited for climbing.
Future work should focus on additional advantages NHS walking
confers in specific ecological conditions inhabited by species with
more mosaic foot morphology, such as A. sediba.
Interestingly, as endurance running entered the repertoire of early
Homo species, toes shortened to reduce large digit flexor forces
(Rolian et al., 2009). The relationship between toe length (and thus
foot length) and absolute walking speed may have been mitigated by
the acquisition of an efficient running gait, reducing the pressure of
maintaining fast absolute walking speeds. Foot length, therefore,
may be seen as an indicator of selection pressures on walking or
running in the fossil record, and foot length and posture play an
integral role in the evolution of bipedal locomotion. Thus, changes

 in hominin foot length may directly reflect selection pressures on
locomotor speed and energy costs.
