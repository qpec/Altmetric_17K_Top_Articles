In Brief
Bushey et al. clone antibodies against
complement factor H (CFH) from single
human B cells. CFH protects tumor cells
from complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC). The authors
demonstrate that a recombinant CFH
antibody induces CDC of tumor cells,
inhibits tumor growth in vivo, and
stimulates infiltration of the tumor by

SUMMARY
Some patients with cancer never develop metas-
tasis, and their host response might provide cues
for innovative treatment strategies. We previously
reported an association between autoantibodies
against complement factor H (CFH) and early-stage
lung cancer. CFH prevents complement-mediated
cytotoxicity (CDC) by inhibiting formation of cell-lytic
membrane attack complexes on self-surfaces. In an
effort to translate these findings into a biologic
therapy for cancer, we isolated and expressed DNA
sequences encoding high-affinity human CFH anti-
bodies directly from single, sorted B cells obtained
from patients with the antibody. The co-crystal struc-
ture of a CFH antibody-target complex shows a
conformational change in the target relative to the
native structure. This recombinant CFH antibody
causes complement activation and release of ana-
phylatoxins, promotes CDC of tumor cell lines, and
inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The isolation of anti-
tumor antibodies derived from single human B cells
represents an alternative paradigm in antibody drug
discovery.
INTRODUCTION
Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of cancer
deaths, and unfortunately, many current drugs only offer modest
benefits in progression-free survival. We have been studying the
immune response in a distinct group of patients with early-stage
disease who do not develop metastasis as an approach to devel-
oping therapeutic strategies (Amornsiripanitch et al., 2010). Our
goal was to identify tumor-specific antibodies capable of initi-
ating tumor cell death while stimulating a durable, long-term
adaptive immune response. We previously reported an associa-
tion of autoantibodies to a complement regulatory protein,
complement factor H (CFH), with early-stage non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and found that patients with stage I NSCLC
had a significantly higher incidence of anti-CFH antibody than
those with late-stage NSCLC (p = 0.0051). This association led
to the hypothesis that CFH antibodies that arise in lung cancer
patients may promote anti-tumor cell activity and that CFH anti-
body administration might provide a unique way to stimulate a
long-term immune response and treat cancer. We set out to
isolate and characterize human CFH antibodies starting from
the memory B cells of patients with the autoantibody in an effort
to develop a therapy that would recapitulate the native immune
response.
CFH is a regulatory protein that protects host cells from attack
and destruction by the complement system by inhibiting the
alternative pathway of complement-mediated lysis (Ferreira
et al., 2010; Makou et al., 2013). CFH prevents the deposition
of complement C3b on the cell surface by several mechanisms.
Deposition of C3b initiates the formation of cell-lytic membrane
attack complexes (MACs) leading to cell lysis. Thus, CFH inhibi-
tion of the deposition of C3b on the cell surface protects against
cell lysis. Tumor cells take advantage of the protection conferred
by CFH in order to evade destruction by the complement system
(Ajona et al., 2007; Junnikkala et al., 2000; Varsano et al., 1998;
Wilczek et al., 2008). We hypothesize that by neutralizing this
protective protein, patient antibodies to CFH allow complement
activation and tumor cell lysis, resulting in the release of anaphy-
latoxins and modulation of the adaptive immune response, thus
suppressing tumor growth while forestalling metastasis.
In order to develop a CFH antibody as a cancer therapeutic,
targeting the same epitope that is recognized by the autoanti-
bodies of cancer patients would be essential to prevent off-
target effects, since CFH is a ubiquitous protein that binds to
the surface of host cells. CFH is a multifunctional 150 kDa protein

 that is composed of 20 short consensus repeats (SCRs), each 60
amino acids long (Makou et al., 2013). The C-terminal SCR do-
mains SCR19 and SCR20 bind to glycosaminoglycan and sialic
acid polyanions, as well as to membrane-bound C3b and its
proteolytic fragments, on the mammalian cell surface (Ferreira
et al., 2010; Kajander et al., 2011; Makou et al., 2013; Morgan
et al., 2011). CFH antibodies affinity purified from the sera of
lung cancer patients bind an epitope within SCR19, PIDNGDIT
(Campa et al., 2015). This epitope comprises residues that are
predicted on mutational and structural grounds to be critical
for the CFH-C3b interaction (Kajander et al., 2011; Morgan
et al., 2011). In vitro, the CFH antibodies prevent CFH binding
to tumor cells, increase C3b binding, and promote comple-
ment-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Although CFH is abundant
in the blood, it is notable that patients who have these antibodies
show no apparent off-target effects. This, and the fact that the
autoantibodies bind preferentially to reduced over oxidized
CFH in vitro, led us to propose that the autoantibodies bind to
a conformationally distinct form of CFH that exists in tumors
(Campa et al., 2015).
Here, we report the isolation and characterization of high-affin-
ity, human CFH monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from single B
cells of patients with the autoantibody. Using our lead candidate
mAb, we explore the mechanism of anti-tumor cell activity and
demonstrate the ability of the antibody to kill tumor cells
in vitro, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo.
RESULTS
Isolation of Human CFH Antibodies from Patients with
the Autoantibody
We had previously mapped the binding region of the autoanti-
bodies from NSCLC patient sera to a specific 8-amino-acid
segment (PIDNGDIT) of the SCR19 domain (Campa et al.,
2015). In order to clone human mAbs that recognize this epitope,
we pooled the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 11
patients who were shown by immunoblot to express CFH auto-
antibody. Using a biotinylated CFH 15-mer peptide containing
the mapped 8-amino-acid binding segment as bait, we sorted
single memory B cells from the pooled PBMCs by flow cytometry
for isolation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region of heavy
and light gene segments (VHDJH and VLJL) (Figure 1A). VHDJH
and VLJL gene pairs were isolated by RT/PCR from each single
CFH antigen-specific memory B cell. A total of 15 recombinant
mAbs generated from the isolated VHDJH and VLJL gene pairs
were identified that bound to the peptide containing the epitope
(Figure 1B). Gene sequence analysis indicated that these 15
CFH-positive mAbs belong to seven clonal lineages (Table 1).
Although these lineages used different VH gene families, all
used a kappa light chain with a CDR3 of 9 amino acids in length.
The antibodies had VH gene mutation frequencies ranging from
2.7% to 10.9% and VK chain mutation frequencies ranging
from 3.0% to 6.3%, except that both VHDJH and VLJL genes of
Ab7966 had 0% mutation. Except for two immunoglobulin M
(IgM) antibodies (Ab7962 and Ab7966), these antibodies were
IgG3 subtype, as were all 22 autoantibodies previously subtyped
in NSCLC patient sera (Campa et al., 2015).
Most of the VHDJH and VLJL sequences in the individual clonal
lineages had identical sequences except the fourth group in
Table 1. Seven antibodies with unique VHDJH and VLJL se-
quences were selected and produced as purified recombinant
antibodies for further characterization. These antibodies were

PBMCs were obtained from patients positive for anti-CFH antibodies and used
for sorting CFH antigen-binding memory B cells via fluorescence-activated
cell sorting. To minimize false positives, streptavidin was labeled with Alexa
Fluor 647 and Brilliant Violet 421. Labeling with each fluorophore was carried
out on separate aliquots of streptavidin, which were then mixed together prior
to interaction with biotinylated antigen peptide (CFH1110-1124). Cells showing
elevated fluorescence for both fluorophores, indicated by the outlined region
(0.32% of the total), were sorted into single wells for recombinant mAb syn-
thesis. The B cell expressing mAb7968 is designated in pink.

tested for binding to epitope peptide bound to neutravidin (Pep-NA) or to
neutravidin alone (NA). Bound antibody was detected with anti-human IgGg-
HRP and ABTS/H2O2 substrate. Sample 31 is an affinity purified anti-CFH
autoantibody serving as a positive control.

 demonstrated to bind CFH with specificity for the reduced form
of both full-length CFH and a fragment containing SCR19-20
(Figure S1). Thus, the isolated antibodies recapitulate the spec-
ificity of the autoantibodies identified in sera. By surface plasmon
resonance analysis (SPR), six of the seven antibodies had affin-
ities in the low-nanomolar range against the CFH epitope-pep-
tide (Table S1). Taken together, these data confirm that single
human B cells against this tumor antigen express high-affinity
antibodies that have undergone somatic hypermutation.
Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis and Crystal Structure of
mAb7968 with an Epitope-Containing Peptide
To define the amino acid footprint of the recombinant CFH
mAbs, we analyzed binding of seven recombinant mAbs to
alanine-substituted peptides containing the originally described
8-amino-acid binding domain (Figure S2). Mutation of Ile1120 to
Ala completely ablated binding of all mAbs; mutation of Asn1117
resulted in 0%–35% of wild-type binding, and mutation of
Thr1121 result in 1%–66% of wild-type binding. None of the
mAbs were affected by changes in the four residues upstream
or three residues downstream of the epitope that were included
in the peptide.
To investigate the interaction of the CFH antibody with its
epitope, the crystal structure of Fab7968 in complex with a
CFH1,110–1,122 peptide was solved by molecular replacement
and refined to a resolution of 2.0 A
˚ (Figure 2A; Table S2). Most
of the CFH polypeptide backbone (residues 1,112–1,122) was
visible in the scattering electron density, showing specific anti-
body-antigen interactions in detail. In particular, the CFH resi-
dues Asn1117 and Ile1120 had been shown by alanine scanning
to be critical components of the mAb7968 epitope (Figure S2).
The complex structure showed that Asn1117 made a through-
water interaction with heavy chain residue Gly96. It is also
possible that the substitution of Asn1117 with Ala disrupted an
intra-peptide interaction between the Asn1117 and Thr1121
side chains that helped to stabilize the peptide’s a-helical
conformation. In agreement with this, the Thr1121Ala mutation
partially but not entirely abrogated binding (Figure S2). The com-
plex structure also showed the Ile1120 side chain binding in a hy-
drophobic pocket formed by Val50 and Tyr58 on the heavy chain
and Trp96 on the light chain. Mutating Ile1120 to Ala would allow
solvent to penetrate this pocket, disrupting hydrophobic anti-
body-antigen contacts in the vicinity.
Asp1119 in the peptide made an H-bond with Thr56 on the
heavy chain at a location on the surface of the complex. Disrup-
tion of this interaction by substitution with Ala resulted in varying
impact on antibody binding (Figure S2). Thus with this structure,
disrupting a through-water interaction (Asn1117) located on
the interior of the antibody-antigen interface was more detri-
mental to binding than disrupting a superficial direct interaction
(Asp1119).
Importantly, the peptide exhibited a conformation distinctly
different from that observed in other structures of CFH protein
constructs (Herbert et al., 2012; Kajander et al., 2011; Morgan
et
al.,
2011,
2012).
In
particular,
residues
1,117–1,120
(sequence element NGDI) near the C terminus of the peptide
adopted an a-helical conformation in the antibody-bound com-
plex, whereas the same region exhibited a b strand conforma-
tion in natively folded structures of CFH (Figure 2A) (Herbert
et al., 2012; Kajander et al., 2011; Morgan et al., 2011, 2012).

Antibodies were regarded as clonally related if they were inferred to use the same V and J gene segments, had identical CDR3 length, and had 70% or
greater nucleotide identity in the CDR3 region, while D-segment identification is subject to substantial uncertainty, so inferred differences in D-segment
use were not sufficient to rule out clonal relatedness of two antibodies. Clonally related antibodies are grouped. Based on the analysis, seven
antibodies (in bold) with unique VHDJH and VLJL sequences were selected to be produced as purified antibodies for further characterization.

 This was consistent with the observation that mAb7968
bound a conformationally distinct form of CFH (Figure S1).
The presence of the helical element was also consistent with
the Ala scanning results showing a discontinuous epitope for
mAb7968 (Figure S2).
CDC of Cancer Cell Lines by Human CFH mAbs
Because of the location of the epitope within the CFH protein
and inferred mechanism of action, we tested five of the mAbs
in a CDC assay using A549 lung cancer cells. Lung cancer cells
were chosen because we originally discovered CFH autoanti-
bodies in lung cancer patients (Amornsiripanitch et al., 2010).
In the CDC assay, cells are mixed with antibodies and normal
human serum (NHS) as a source of complement and incubated
at 37�C, and cytolysis is measured by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) release. The five mAbs behaved similarly in the CDC
assay; however, we chose mAb7968 for future development
because, in addition to its low-nanomolar affinity for the
epitope-containing peptide, it was highly expressed in cell cul-
ture. When added to A549 cells, mAb7968 increased CDC over
that seen with a negative control human antibody by 101%
(Figure 3). Besides A549 (a NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell line),
other cell lines that were killed by mAb7968 were the H226
squamous cell carcinoma and H460 large cell cancer cell lines
(both NSCLC cell lines), the DMS79 small cell lung cancer cell
line, the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line, and the KATOIII gastric
cancer cell line (Figure 3). Additional cell lines that showed
increased cytotoxicity with mAb7968 were A431 (epidermoid
carcinoma), RD-ES (Ewing’s sarcoma), and FaDu (pharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma) (data not shown). All cell lines
were shown to express CFH and bind mAb7968 (data not
shown).
To confirm complement activation, we assayed products of
the CDC reaction (C3a, C5a, and C5b-9). The anaphylatoxins

C3a and C5a are generated during com-
plement activation and as cytokines for
immune cells are links between the innate
and adaptive immune systems (Klos
et al., 2009). C5b-9 comprises the termi-
nal MAC, a minimal number of which are
required to assemble in order to lyse the
cell (Koski et al., 1983). Addition of
mAb7968 to A549 or H226 cells in the
presence of NHS resulted in increased
C3a release (Figure 4A), C5a release (Figure 4B), and C5b-9
deposition (Figure 4C).
In Vivo Tumor Growth Studies
For in vivo mouse studies, we developed a murine version of
mAb7968 since initial experiments had shown that the human
mAb triggered the formation of anti-human antibodies in nude
mice. To test the effect of antibody on tumor growth, we initially
used an adult-patient-derived brain tumor xenograft, D-270MG,
grown in nude mice (Bigner et al., 1990), performing intratumoral
injections of either murine IgG1-mAb7968, a murine subtype-
matched negative control antibody, or noantibody in each ofthree
groups of mice. Injections were repeated biweekly for 3 weeks,
and tumors were measured. By the end of the 3-week study, there
was significant tumor growth inhibition (Figures S3A and S3B) and
prolonged survival (Figure S3C) in the group of animals that
received murine mAb7968. The primary concern for side effects
from inhibition of CFH by a CFH antibody is renal toxicity (Hofer
et al., 2014). Stained sections from the kidneys of all animals
were examined by H&E and were normal. There were no observed
adverse reactions at necropsy in any of the animals treated with
mAb7968. H&E-stained sections of tumor excised from mice
receiving the negative control mAb show densely packed tumor
cells, whereas H&E-stained sections from the smallest palpable
mass excised from an mAb7968-treated mouse show diffuse in-
flammatory cells without visible tumor cells (Figure S3D).
In order to test antibody efficacy in a mouse with a functional
immune system, we used the KLN205-DBA/2 syngeneic lung
cancer model (Kaneko and LePage, 1978). The murine KLN205
cell line expresses CFH and binds murine mAb7968 (data not
shown). Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.), then
mAb7968 or negative control mAbNctl was injected intraperito-
neally (i.p.) on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. Tumor volumes were
measured periodically thereafter. Differences in mean tumor
1508

 volume were observed in the two groups of mice, with systemi-
cally administered mAb7968 conferring growth delay and inhibi-
tion compared to negative control mAbNctl (Figure 5A). The
magnitude of this difference reached statistical significance
(p < 0.05). H&E staining of a section from the residual tumor
from a mAb7968-treated mouse showed an abundant lympho-
cytic infiltrate that was absent in the tumor section from a control
mouse (Figure 5B).
DISCUSSION
In an effort to develop an immunotherapeutic strategy, we initially
embarked on a search for autoantibodies associated with a
distinct non-metastatic early-stage phenotype that could cause
cancer cell death, modulate the adaptive immune response,
and ultimately produce a long-term cellular response against
the tumor. The current study used a unique approach to develop
a tumor-specific antibody that would target cancer cells without
creating off-target effects. Here, we report the sequencing and
expression of CFH antibodies starting from the B cells of patients
who produced these antibodies. While this same technology has
been used to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV start-
ing from B cells (Morris et al., 2011), this study isolates high-affin-
ity antibodies with anti-tumor cell and anti-tumor growth activity
directly from patients. The process of cloning and expressing
antibody genes derived from selected B cells is significantly
more efficient than production of mAbs in mice by immunization
followed by ‘‘humanization.’’ This allowed us to generate an affin-
ity matured antibody that recognizes a conformationally distinct
epitope of CFH that, when originally targeted by the immune sys-
tem, resulted in a desirable phenotype (i.e., limitation of early
stage cancer and no apparent side effects).
The 15 isolated CFH-reactive antibodies can be classified into
seven clonal lineages because they share the same VH, JH, Vk
and Jk gene families and had the same HCDR3 and KCDR3
lengths. Since the PBMCs that were used for sorting single B

cells were pooled from 11 patients, it is
unclear if antibody members from the in-
dividual clonal lineages were from one
patient or from different patients.
The CFH mAbs have the same speci-
ficity for the conformationally distinct
form of CFH and the SCR19-20 fragment
as the serum autoantibodies previously
described (Campa et al., 2015), which is
important to avoid potential off-target effects. An altered confor-
mation of the CFH epitope is seen in the peptide-antibody
co-crystal structure, and recognition of this conformation in the
tumor environment may be the basis for antibody tumor speci-
ficity. This finding also suggests that conformationally distinct
epitopes may be relevant therapeutic targets.
We showed that CFH mAb7968 killed a variety of tumor cell
lines in vitro, including NSCLC (three histological types), small
cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer. In vivo,
growth of both a subcutaneous brain tumor in a nude mouse
model and a subcutaneous lung tumor in a syngeneic model
were substantially inhibited by this antibody without observable
adverse reactions.
In addition to and possibly more important than the immediate
effect of the CFH mAb on complement activation, is that the ana-
phylatoxins C3a and C5a produced, and subsequently other cyto-
kines and chemokines produced when the cell is damaged, will
modulateanadaptiveimmuneresponse.Inparticular,theanaphy-
latoxins bind directly to dendritic cells, causing activation and
maturation required for induction of T cell effector activity (Surace
et al., 2015). It is this long-term cellular response that could poten-
tially have the most profound impact on cancer outcomes. Further
in vivo studies addressing the immune program will be needed in
order to understand the full potential of this approach.

 Proteins and Peptides
CFH was purchased from Complement Technology. SCR19-20 was purified
as described previously (Campa et al., 2015). The CFH epitope-peptide,
(GPPPPIDNGDITSFP(GGGK)-biotin), encompassing CFH1,110–1,124 that in-
cludes the 8-amino-acid epitope (underlined), plus three glycine residues as
a linker and a single lysine residue for biotinylation for protein capture and
flow sorting was produced; alanine substitution variant peptides for epitope
mapping were also produced (CPC Scientific). A shorter version of this pep-
tide, CFH1,110–1,122 peptide (GPPPPIDNGDITS), was designed for crystal
structure study and was commercially synthesized by CPC Scientific with an
acetylated N terminus and amidated C terminus.
Isolation of VHDJH and VL Genes and Expression of VHDJH and VLJL
Genes as Full-Length IgG1 Recombinant mAbs
PBMCs were obtained from patients positive for anti-CFH antibodies and
used for sorting CD19+/CD27+ CFH antigen-binding memory B cells via fluo-
rescence-activated cell sorting using previously described methods (Morris
et al., 2011). To minimize false positives, streptavidin was labeled with Alexa
Fluor 647 and Brilliant Violet 421. Labeling with each fluorophore was carried
out on separate aliquots of streptavidin, which were then mixed together
prior to interaction with biotinylated antigen peptide (CFH1,110–1,124). Cells
showing elevated fluorescence for both fluorophores were sorted into single
wells of a 96-well tray. The VHDJH and VLJL gene segment pairs of the mAbs
were amplified by RT/PCR from flow-sorted human CFH antigen-specific
memory B cells and sequenced and annotated using methods described
previously (Liao et al., 2013). Genetic information for both VHDJH and VLJL
gene segments of individual antibodies, including gene segment family us-
age, somatic mutation frequency, CDR3 length, and clonal lineage relation-
ships, were inferred using the software program Cloanalyst (http://www.bu.
edu/computationalimmunology/research/software/) as described previously
(Kepler, 2013; Kepler et al., 2014). The isolated Ig VH and VL gene pairs
were assembled by PCR into the linear full-length human Ig heavy- and
light-chain gene expression cassettes for production of recombinant mAbs
in 293T cells for initial screening of CFH reactive antibodies using methods
described previously (Liao et al., 2009). The VHDJH and VLJL genes of
selected CFH binding antibodies were synthesized (GenScript) and cloned
into modified pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) for production of purified re-
combinant IgG1 and Fab antibodies as described previously (Liao et al.,
2011).
Production of Purified Recombinant Antibodies
For production of purified recombinant mAbs for further characterization, the
VHDJH and VLJL genes of selected CFH binding antibodies were synthesized
(GenScript) and cloned into modified pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the con-
stant region of human IgG1 heavy chain or kappa chain (Liao et al., 2009).
To study the effect of antibody isotype, the constant region of Ab7968 was
substituted with the constant region of human IgG3 (GenBank: M12958.1)
(Huck et al., 1986). To study the in vivo effect of Ab7968 on tumor grown
in mouse models and minimize the antigenicity of antibody in mice, heavy-
and kappa light-chain constant regions were substituted with mouse IgG1
(GenBank: BC024405) (Strausberg et al., 2002) and kappa chain (GenBank:
P01837) (Svasti and Milstein, 1972), respectively. Recombinant Fab antibodies
were produced for crystal structure study as described previously (Nicely
et al., 2010). Recombinant antibodies were produced in 293F cells by transient
transfection, purified from the supernatants of transfected 293F cells by using
Protein A columns.
X-Ray Crystallography
The Fab fragment of recombinant mAb 7968 was produced in 293F cells by
transient transfection then purified using methods described previously
(Nicely et al., 2010). For structural studies, after affinity capture using
KappaSelect (GE Healthcare), the Fab was further purified via gel filtration
chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200pg 26/60 column at
2 mL/min with a buffer of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaCl, and
0.02% NaN3. Peak elution fractions were pooled and exchanged into
ddH2O via five dilution/concentration cycles and brought to a final concen-
tration of 18.8 mg/mL.

Cell Reports 15, 1505–1513, May 17, 2016
 Unliganded Fab7968 crystallized in a drop composed of 0.2 ml protein plus
0.4 ml 25 mM citric acid (pH 3.5) and 8% PEG 3350 over a reservoir of 60 ml 24%
PEG 3350 at 20�C. CFH1,110–1,122 peptide was soaked into the crystal by
diluting 0.1 ml of the 20 mg/mL peptide solution in ddH2O with 1 ml of the reser-
voir solution, then adding that solution to the crystal-containing drop and
allowing it to incubate overnight. The crystal was cryoprotected in reservoir so-
lution supplemented with ethylene glycol then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team
(SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Laboratory using an incident beam of 1 A
˚ in wavelength. The dataset was
reduced in HKL-2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The structure was
phased by molecular replacement in PHENIX (Terwilliger et al., 2008) using
as search models Fab and Fc domains composited from the source models
1NL0 (Huang et al., 2004) for the heavy chain and 3QOS (Malia et al., 2011)
for the light chain as determined by BLAST search for sequence identity.
Rebuilding and real-space refinements were done in Coot (Emsley et al.,
2010) with reciprocal space refinements in PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010) and
validations in MolProbity (Lovell et al., 2003).
C3a and C5a Release
A549 or H226 lung cancer cells (5 3 105 cells/well) were incubated in triplicate
in 100 ml cell culture medium containing either 1:8 diluted NHS, 1:8 NHS and
250 mg/mL mAb7968, or 1:8 NHS and 250 mg/mL human IgG. Cell superna-
tants were assayed at 1 hr and 4 hr for C5a and C3a using commercial ELISA
kits (R&D Systems and eBioscience, respectively).
C5b-9 Deposition
C5b-9 deposition was measured by flow cytometry. A549 and H226 cells
(5 3 105 cells) in veronal buffer were incubated in triplicate for 30 min at
37�C with an equal volume of DPBS + NHS that had been preincubated
with CFH mAb or negative control antibody for 30 min at 4�C. Final concen-
trations after mixing were 1:8 diluted NHS, 1:8 NHS and 300 mg/mL
mAb7968, or 1:8 NHS and 300 mg/mL subtype-matched control mAb. After
30 min, cells were washed twice in 1% (w/v) BSA in DPBS (DPBS-BSA)
and then incubated for 30 min at 4�C with a mouse anti-human C5b-9 anti-
body (Abcam) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS. Cells were washed three times in
DPBS-BSA and then incubated for 30 min at 4�C with an FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a
1:100 dilution in PBS. Cells were washed three times in DPBS-BSA, and
flow cytometry was carried out using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) at the Duke Cancer Center Core Facility. Mean fluorescence in-

mAb Treatment
(A) Growth curves. KLN205 tumor cells were in-
jected s.c. on day 0, and mAb7968 or mAbNctl
was injected i.p. every 3 days between days 1 and
13, after which treatment was stopped. The mean
tumor volumes ± SEM for t = 7 mice treated with
each mAb are plotted. p values for the difference in
tumor volumes between mAb7968 and mAbNctl
on days 39, 42, and 45 are 0.027, 0.030, and 0.077,
respectively.

tensity on cells, corresponding to C5b-9 deposi-
tion on the cell surface, was determined using
FlowJo software (Tree Star).
CDC Assays
LDH release assays were performed using the
CytoTox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay
(Promega) to assess cytotoxicity. NHS, CFH, and C1q depleted serum
were purchased from Complement Tech. NHS was diluted 1:8. The number
of cells plated in each well (between 5 3 103 and 1 3 104 for solid tumor cell
lines) was experimentally determined based on spontaneous and maximum
LDH release. After addition of anti-CFH or control antibodies (�100 mg/mL
except where noted), cells were incubated overnight at 37�C. All reactions
were performed in triplicate and LDH release was read in a plate reader at
490 nm.
In Vivo Tumor Growth Study: Syngeneic Lung Cancer Model
Animal care was in accordance with Duke University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee guidelines. For in vivo mouse studies, we
developed a mAb7968 chimeric antibody that contained the VH and VK
region
genes
of
Ab7968
and
the
constant
region
of
mouse
IgG2a
(Strausberg et al., 2002) and mouse Ig kappa light chain (Svasti and Milstein,
1972), since initial experiments had shown that the human mAb triggered
the formation of anti-human antibodies in nude mice. KLN205 tumor
cells (4 3 105/0.1 mL/mouse) were injected s.c. on day 0. On days 1,
4,
7,
10,
and
13,
mAb7968
or
subtype-matched
control
mAbNctl
(200 mg/0.1 mL per mouse; n = 10 mice per group) was injected i.p.
Tumor measurements were made by calipers and volumes calculated as
(W2 3 L)/2. Tumors did not form in three mice that received mAb7968 and
one mouse that received mAbNctl; these mice were removed from the
study analysis as to not bias the results. Two mice that received mAbNctl
had to be euthanized due to ulcerated tumors and were also removed
from the study analysis. All mice were euthanized at the end of the study.
Tumors removed at necropsy were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Five micron thick sections were stained with H&E for histologic
evaluation.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel using the Student’s
t test for assessment of the significance of differences between treatment
groups in the CDC assays, the ELISAs, and the tumor growth assays.
p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
