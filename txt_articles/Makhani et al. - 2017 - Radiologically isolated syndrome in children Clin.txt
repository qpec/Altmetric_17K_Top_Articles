Radiologically isolated syndrome in
children
Clinical and radiologic outcomes
ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe clinical and radiologic outcomes of children with incidental findings on neu-
roimaging suggestive of CNS demyelination (termed “radiologically isolated syndrome” or RIS).
Methods: Clinical and radiologic data were obtained from a historical cohort of children with no
symptoms of demyelinating disease who had MRI scans that met the 2010 MRI criteria for dis-
semination in space for MS.
Results: We identified 38 children (27 girls and 11 boys) with RIS now being prospectively fol-
lowed at 16 sites in 6 countries. The mean follow-up time was 4.8 6 5.3 years. The most common
reason for initial neuroimaging was headache (20/38, 53%). A first clinical event consistent with
CNS demyelination occurred in 16/38 children (42%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%–60%)
in a median of 2.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.0–4.3 years). Radiologic evolution developed
in 23/38 children (61%; 95% CI: 44%–76%) in a median of 1.1 years (IQR 0.5–1.9 years). The
presence of $2 unique oligoclonal bands in CSF (hazard ratio [HR] 10.9, 95% CI: 1.4–86.2, p 5
0.02) and spinal cord lesions on MRI (HR 7.8, 95% CI: 1.4–43.6, p 5 0.02) were associated with
an increased risk of a first clinical event after adjustment for age and sex.
Conclusions: We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with incidental
MRI findings highly suggestive of CNS demyelination. Children with RIS had a substantial risk
of subsequent clinical symptoms and/or radiologic evolution. The presence of oligoclonal bands
in CSF and spinal cord lesions on MRI were associated with an increased risk of a first clinical
event. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm 2017;4:e395; doi: 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000395

The incidental finding of abnormalities on MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord has become
more common due to the increasing use of MRI in the evaluation of a wide range of medical
conditions in children.1,2 Some of these abnormalities are highly suggestive of CNS demyelin-
ation based on their size, location within the white matter, and shape. This finding has pre-
viously been described in adults and has been termed “radiologically isolated syndrome” or
RIS.3–5 Criteria for RIS in adults were proposed in 2009 and require both clinical and imaging
factors including the incidental detection of MRI abnormalities meeting the following criteria:
(1) ovoid and well-circumscribed homogenous foci with or without involvement of the corpus
callosum, (2) T2 hyperintensities $3 mm in diameter fulfilling at least 3 of the 4 Barkhof MRI
criteria for dissemination in space (DIS), as adopted in the 2005 diagnostic criteria for MS,6 and
(3) the CNS abnormalities are not consistent with a vascular pattern.3 We recently reported
a teenager with such incidental white matter abnormalities detected on brain MRI.7 However,

 outcomes following the detection of RIS in
children are not known, and there are no cri-
teria for RIS in children.
Adults identified with RIS have a 34% risk
of developing a first clinical event consistent
with CNS demyelination within 5 years.8,9 Fac-
tors associated with the development of a first
clinical event in adults with RIS include age
,37 years, male sex, and the presence of spinal
cord lesions on MRI. Radiologic evolution
occurred in 59% of adult RIS subjects after
a median of 2.7 years.3 The risk of developing
either a first clinical event consistent with CNS
demyelination or radiologic evolution in chil-
dren (age ,18 years) with RIS is unknown.
The objectives of this historical cohort
study in children newly enrolled in a multicen-
ter longitudinal observational cohort study of
outcomes following pediatric RIS were there-
fore (1) to propose criteria for RIS in children,
(2) to determine the clinical and radiologic
outcomes of children with RIS over time,
and (3) to determine whether any clinical,
MRI, or laboratory marker was associated with
an increased risk of either clinical or radiologic
evolution.
METHODS Study participants. We identified a historical
cohort of children aged ,18 years with incidental MRI abnor-
malities consistent with CNS demyelination that met the 2010
criteria for DIS for MS on MRI.10 All children are now being
prospectively followed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown
in table 1. Children were identified and followed according to
routine clinical practice at 16 collaborating MS centers in 6 coun-
tries between December 1, 1995, and March 15, 2016 (table e-1
at Neurology.org/nn). A detailed clinical history and neurologic
examination were performed on all children. Tests to exclude
other infectious, inflammatory, rheumatologic, and metabolic
diseases (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein
level, antinuclear antibody screen, rheumatoid factor level, double-
stranded DNA testing, vitamin B12 level, angiotensin-converting
enzyme level, anticardiolipin antibodies, and Lyme disease serol-
ogy) were performed based on local practice. CSF analysis and
determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were ob-
tained at the discretion of the treating neurologist at non-
standardized time points and tested using local methods.
Neuroimaging. All children underwent MRI on either 1.5T or
3T MRI scanners. All brain and spinal cord MRI studies included
T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences in multiple planes of
view (axial and sagittal, with coronal images for brain studies)
with or without gadolinium.
MRI abnormalities were first identified by a clinical neurora-
diologist and then confirmed by at least 1 MS specialist at each
site to ensure that the 2010 DIS criteria were met on initial scans.
The presence or absence of radiologic evolution, defined as any of
$1 new T2 lesion, $1 newly enlarging T2 lesion, or $1 newly
enhancing lesion in either the brain or spinal cord, was similarly
determined.8,9
Standard protocol approvals and patient consents. Institu-
tional ethical approval was obtained from all sites. Written
informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians, and chil-
dren provided assent.
Statistical analysis. Clinical and MRI data were collected using
a standard template. We report mean values (6SD) and/or me-
dians (with interquartile ranges, IQRs) for continuous variables
and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. We created
Kaplan-Meier survival curves to illustrate time to either a first
clinical event consistent with CNS demyelination (defined as
a new neurologic symptom and sign lasting $24 hours) or
radiologic evolution where zero time was the date of the initial
scan that met the 2010 criteria for DIS. We used Mann-Whitney
U tests (continuous variables) and Fisher’s exact tests (categorical
variables) to examine the statistical significance of unadjusted
associations between the outcomes of either a first clinical event
or radiologic evolution, and demographic variables (e.g., age, sex,
and race), MRI variables (e.g., number of brain lesions, presence
of enhancing lesions, presence of periventricular, infratentorial, or
spinal cord lesions), and laboratory-based variables (e.g., presence
of $2 unique oligoclonal bands in CSF). We created multivari-
able Cox proportional hazards models for the time to either a first
clinical event or radiologic evolution. Multivariable models
included predictors found to have significant associations with
our outcomes in unadjusted analyses as well as age (modeled
continuously in years) and sex, which we felt were clinically rel-
evant variables. The proportional hazards assumption was as-
sessed using graphical methods. We report hazard ratios (HRs)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered 2-sided
p values ,0.05 as statistically significant. We used SAS v9.4
(Carey, NC) for all statistical analyses.
RESULTS Characteristics of children with RIS. We
screened 39 children, of whom 1 was excluded due to
baseline MRI not being available for review (only neuro-
radiologist’s report). We therefore included 38 children
at 16 sites from 6 countries who met our criteria in the

 current study (table 1). Seventy-one percent (27/38)
of children were girls. The median age at index MRI
was 15.4 years (IQR 13.5–16.5 years). The mean
time from index MRI to most recent clinical assess-
ment was 4.8 6 5.3 years (median 2.5 years, IQR
1.2–7.0 years) and was longer in children who devel-
oped a first clinical event than in those who did not
(mean 7.2 6 5.7 years vs 3.0 6 4.1 years, p 5 0.01).
The clinical and demographic characteristics of the
cohort are summarized in table 2.
The most common reason for obtaining initial
neuroimaging was headache (20/38, 53%). Other
reasons were depression (2), seizure/epilepsy (4), con-
cussion (2), attention-deficit disorder (1), Adie tonic
pupil (1), endocrinopathy (1), leukemia (1), syn-
cope/loss of consciousness (2), known Chiari I (1),
neck mass (1), ear pain (1), and healthy control in
a research study (1).
Initial neurologic examinations were normal in
36/38 children (95%). One child had symmetrically
brisk reflexes and 1 had an uncorrected bilateral visual
acuity of 20/25 without optic disc pallor. At least 2
unique oligoclonal bands were present in CSF, but
not serum, in 57% (13/23) of children in whom
CSF was obtained. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D lev-
els were determined in 19/38 (50%) children.
All children had initial MRI scans that met the 2010
criteria for DIS (representative images in figure 1).
The most common lesion type was periventricular;
$1 periventricular lesion was detected in all 38 chil-
dren (100%). Nineteen of 38 children (50%) also met
the definition of RIS in adults (i.e., initial MRI scans
met $3 of 4 Barkhof criteria/2005 DIS criteria for
MS). Two of 24 children (8%) in whom gadolinium
was administered on initial brain MRI scans had
enhancing lesions. Spinal cord imaging was obtained
in 29/38 children (76%), among whom 5 (17%) had
spinal lesions and 2 of these 5 children had enhancing
lesions. All 5 children had cervical cord lesions; 1 child
also had lesions in the thoracic cord.
Clinical and radiologic outcomes. A first clinical event
consistent with CNS demyelination occurred in
16/38 children (42%; 95% CI: 27%–60%) with
a median of 2.0 years (IQR 1.0–4.3 years) and
median clinical event-free survival time (which takes
into account variable follow-up times in the cohort)
of 5.0 years (95% CI: 2–7 years). Among the 19
children who met the definition of RIS for adults, 10
(53%; 95% CI: 30%–75%) developed a first clinical
event. The phenotypes of a first clinical event
included optic neuritis (4), monofocal brainstem
syndromes (4), myelitis (3), other monofocal signs
(3), and polyfocal signs without encephalopathy (2).
Eight of 20 children (40%) who presented with
headache and 2 of 4 children (50%) with a seizure
developed a first clinical event. No child developed
either clinical acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
or a primary progressive course.
Of the 16 children who developed a first clinical
event consistent with CNS demyelination, 14 (88%)
had $1 routine follow-up surveillance of brain MRI
prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (6 children had
2 scans and 3 children had $3 scans). The median
interval between the index MRI and the first follow-up
scan was 380 (range 22–1,803) days. Two of the 16
children developed a first clinical event in close prox-
imity to the index MRI scans (after 1 and 3 months,
respectively) and had follow-up MRIs performed at the
time of clinical symptoms. Of the 22 children who did
not develop a first clinical event, all but 1 child (who
refused additional MRIs) had $1 follow-up MRI scan
of the brain performed (median 5 2 scans/child). The
median interval between the index MRI and the first
follow-up scan in children who did not develop a first
clinical event was 258 (range 13–1,422) days. Radio-
logic evolution developed in 23/38 children (61%;
95% CI: 27%–60%) with a median of 1.1 years
(IQR 0.5–1.9 years) and a median radiologic event-
free survival time of 1.8 years (95% CI: 1.1–4.9 years).
Kaplan-Meier curves for clinical and radiologic end-
points are shown in figure 2.
Five children were treated with $1 approved
disease-modifying therapy for MS prior to a first clin-
ical event (after radiologic evolution occurred in 4
children and prior to radiologic evolution in 1 child).
Interferon beta 1a was the first-line agent in all 5.
Two of the treated children developed a first clinical
event on treatment (after 1.1 and 17.1 years after the
index MRI and after 3.4 months and 10.1 years on

dren remained clinically stable after 1.7–15.3 years of
follow-up.
Clinical, laboratory, and MRI markers. Children who
had $2 unique oligoclonal bands detected in CSF
(HR 10.9, 95% CI: 1.4–86.2, p 5 0.02) or spinal cord
lesions present on MRI (HR 7.8, 95% CI: 1.4–43.6,
p 5 0.02) were at greater risk of a first clinical event
than those who did not have these factors present, after
adjustment for age and sex (figure 3, A and B). Chil-
dren with and without either CSF or spinal cord MRI
assessments did not differ in key baseline variables,
including age, sex, and race. There were no statistically
significant differences in any of the following variables
between children with and without either a first clinical
event or radiologic evolution: age, sex, race, reason for
imaging (dichotomized as headache vs not headache),
first MRI scan that met the 2005 criteria for DIS,
presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, presence of
brain MRI lesions in typical locations for MS (juxta-
cortical, periventricular, or infratentorial), or serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels.
DISCUSSION We report findings from a longitudinal
multicenter study of children with incidental MRI
abnormalities consistent with CNS demyelination.
We found that a substantial proportion of children that
met the definition of RIS in table 1 (42%) developed
a first clinical event consistent with CNS demyelin-
ation and an even higher proportion (61%) developed
radiologic evolution. This is similar to the 34% and
60% of adults with RIS who have been consistently
reported to develop either clinical or radiologic evolu-
tion, respectively.3,4,9 However, among the children in
our study, clinical and radiologic evolution occurred
faster than among adults with RIS (medians of 2.0
and 1.1 years, respectively, in children vs 5.4 years
and 2.7 years, respectively, in adults).3 This is in line
with prior studies that demonstrated the aggressive
nature of demyelination in children with relapse rates
in children with MS reported as more than twice those
in adults early in the disease course.11
There are currently no formal criteria for the subse-
quent diagnosis of MS in either children or adults with
RIS. Recently proposed modifications to existing diag-
nostic criteria, however, suggest that a diagnosis of MS
can be made in individuals with RIS (who already dem-
onstrate DIS on MRI) who subsequently develop a first
clinical event consistent with CNS demyelination.12
All children in our study had MRI scans that met
the 2010 criteria for DIS, and 50% of children also
met the criteria published in 2009 for RIS in adults,
which required MRI scans to meet at least 3 of the 4
Barkhof criteria for DIS (i.e., 2005 DIS criteria for
MS).3 We used the newer 2010 MRI criteria for DIS
in our study because there are no criteria for RIS in
children and the 2010 criteria are routinely used in
clinical practice for the diagnosis of MS. Because of
our study design, we could not directly compare the
specificity of the 2005 and 2010 MRI criteria for DIS,
but it is possible that the 2010 criteria (which require
fewer lesions) may have lower specificity (i.e., a higher
false-positive rate). Nonetheless, given the high rate of
development of a first clinical event in our cohort, we
propose that our definition of RIS in children (table 1)
be used in future studies.
The most common reason for obtaining neuroi-
maging was headache. Brain white matter lesions,
some that meet 2010 criteria for DIS on MRI, have
been reported in individuals with headaches and mi-
graines.13–15 Our finding that 40% of children with
RIS who underwent imaging for evaluation of head-
aches developed a first clinical event (similar to the
44% in children whose indication for initial imaging
was not headache) highlights the importance of fol-
lowing such children over time to determine which
children with headaches and RIS are at greatest risk of
developing clinical demyelination.
Two of 4 children who presented with a seizure
subsequently developed a first clinical event. Approx-
imately 3% of patients with established MS will have
at least 1 seizure.16 Future studies to determine which
children with RIS who present with a seizure are at
greatest risk for the development of a first clinical
event will be valuable.
Our finding that spinal cord lesions are associated
with the subsequent development of a first clinical
event in children with RIS is consistent with studies
in adults with RIS that have found a similar associa-
tion.8,9 An increased risk of a second clinical event
has also been reported in adults with clinically isolated

 syndrome who have spinal cord lesions.17 In 1 pre-
liminary study of children with MS, the greatest
number of relapses tended to occur in children with
the greatest number of spinal cord lesions.18 All chil-
dren in our study who had abnormalities on spinal
cord MRI scans demonstrated lesions in the cervical
cord. We therefore recommend cervical cord imaging
be considered in children with RIS to identify chil-
dren at greatest risk of a first clinical event who may
need closer follow-up.
We also found that the presence of oligoclonal
bands in CSF was independently associated with a first
clinical event in children with RIS. One prior study
reported an increased risk of a first clinical event in
adults with RIS who had abnormal CSF, but this
association was only significant if there were $9 T2
brain lesions on brain MRI.19 In children with a first
attack of symptomatic CNS demyelination, the pres-
ence of oligoclonal bands in CSF was highly predic-
tive of a subsequent diagnosis of MS.20,21 If replicated,
our findings suggest that in children with RIS, anal-
ysis of CSF for oligoclonal bands should be consid-
ered for prognostic purposes.
None of the individual brain MRI parameters we
assessed were associated with either a first clinical
event or radiologic evolution. A study of adults with
RIS found that the presence of contrast-enhancing
lesions on index MRI was associated with an
increased risk of radiologic evolution, but not a first
clinical event. Studies in children with acute symp-
tomatic CNS demyelination have shown that the
presence of periventricular lesions and $1 normalized
T1-weighted hypointense lesions on brain MRI were
associated with an increased likelihood of MS diag-
nosis.22,23 The nonstandardized clinical reading and
MRI acquisition protocols used in our study did not
permit the assessment of T1-weighted hypointen-
sities, but this could be assessed in future studies.
Five children in our study were treated with immu-
nomodulatory treatments for MS to try to prevent
a first clinical event. Two multicenter clinical trials, 1
using dimethyl fumarate and 1 using teriflunomide,
are currently underway to test whether immunomodu-
latory treatment prevents or delays clinical evolution in
adults with RIS.24,25 Treatment for children with RIS
should be considered, after adequate controlled trials
are performed, if our finding that RIS in children is
associated with a substantial risk of developing a first
clinical event is confirmed.
One limitation of our study is that we analyzed
historical data, and therefore, all clinical, MRI, and
laboratory data were obtained in the past using non-
standardized MRI techniques, and timing and meth-
ods for the collection of clinical and laboratory data
were not uniform. Prospective studies with standard-
ized protocols are planned and will necessitate contin-
ued multinational collaborations.
Our study highlights the importance of the detec-
tion of RIS in children. As in adults, a substantial pro-
portion
of
children
with
RIS
in
our
cohort
subsequently developed clinical symptoms, especially
children with oligoclonal bands present in CSF and
those with spinal cord MRI lesions. Children with
RIS appear to develop clinical symptoms and radiologic
evolution sooner than adults. Further research in larger
cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and to

 identify additional risk factors for the development of
clinical neurologic symptoms following the detection
of RIS in children. Although this work does not address
the issue of whether children with RIS should be treated
with disease-modifying agents for MS, we hope that an
accurate classification of the risk of clinical symptoms in
children with RIS will help in the development of con-
sensus guidelines that are urgently needed to optimize
clinical care in this population.
