Abstract
Treponema pallidum infections occur worldwide causing, among other diseases, syphilis
and yaws. In particular sexually transmitted syphilis is regarded as a re-emerging infectious
disease with millions of new infections annually. Here we present three historic T. pallidum
genomes (two from T. pallidum ssp. pallidum and one from T. pallidum ssp. pertenue) that
have been reconstructed from skeletons recovered from the Convent of Santa Isabel in
Mexico City, operational between the 17th and 19th century. Our analyses indicate that differ-
ent T. pallidum subspecies caused similar diagnostic presentations that are normally associ-
ated with syphilis in infants, and potential evidence of a congenital infection of T. pallidum
ssp. pertenue, the causative agent of yaws. This first reconstruction of T. pallidum genomes
from archaeological material opens the possibility of studying its evolutionary history at a
resolution previously assumed to be out of reach.
Author summary
Among the worldwide prevalent treponemal diseases syphilis is a global threat that is cur-
rently re-emerging. The origins of syphilis and other treponemal diseases are as yet unre-
solved and are subject to an intensive scholarly debate. Until now, assumptions on its
origins and evolutionary history could only be drawn from osteological analyses of past
cases and genetic analysis of contemporary T. pallidum genomes; contributions from
ancient DNA are very rare and have so far failed to provide genome-level data. The
ancient T. pallidum genomes presented here allow us, for the first time, to perform
genome-wide comparative analyses and to assess a connection between osteological mani-
festations of past treponemal cases and specific T. pallidum species. Our study demon-
strates the possibility of retrieving ancient T. pallidum genomes from archeological

Introduction
Treponema pallidum subspecies cause several diseases, among which sexually transmitted
syphilis, caused by T. pallidum ssp. pallidum (TPA), and yaws, caused by T. pallidum ssp. perte-
nue (TPE), are the best known and are prevalent worldwide. The global disease burden is high
for both diseases. Syphilis is seen as re-emerging in various regions of the world including
Europe, North America, China and Australia [1] with 10.6 million cases reported in 2009 [2],
while for yaws more than 300,000 new cases were recorded between 2008 and 2012 [3]. The
origins and evolutionary history of these pathogens remain nebulous, including the perceived
sudden appearance and pandemic spread of syphilis in Europe at the end of the 15th century.
Hypotheses surrounding the origin of syphilis are subject to an extensive scholarly debate, in
particular the New World origin of syphilis with worldwide dissemination starting in the 15th
century [4, 5] in contrast to the hypothesis of multiregional origin that posits an increase in
virulence followed by a pandemic spread in the 15th century [6]. While genetic data from con-
temporary T. pallidum strains has been interpreted as support for the New World origin [7, 8],
there exists potential skeletal evidence in support of the multiregional origin [9, 10], yet this
remains heavily debated [11, 12].
Ancient DNA could help to resolve this controversy by illuminating the evolutionary his-
tory of human-pathogenic treponemes. However, detection of ancient treponemal DNA is
very rare. To date, only short strain-unspecific PCR fragments have been retrieved from a
200-year-old mummy [13] and from European post-Columbian neonates [14]. Furthermore,
even in modern patients with advanced stage syphilis, who may display bone lesions, molecu-
lar detection of the bacterium is challenging [15] casting doubt on the possibility of a successful
recovery of T. pallidum from ancient skeletons [16]. Our latest research on non-human trepo-
nemes, however, was successful in retrieving T. pallidum ssp. pertenue DNA from non-human
primate bones that were several decades old [17].
Here, we use DNA hybridization capture methods in combination with high-throughput
sequencing to retrieve historic T. pallidum DNA (T. pallidum ssp. pallidum and T. pallidum
ssp. pertenue) and to successfully reconstruct three genomes using bone material dating back
to Colonial Mexico with characteristic skeletal manifestations for congenital treponematosis
[18]. Our study establishes the possibility of retrieving ancient T. pallidum genomes from
archeological material and allows us, for the first time, to assess the genomic principle of past
treponemal infections.
Results
Archeological site, dating and osteological analysis of the bone material
We screened samples from five individuals from the former Convent of Santa Isabel, a histori-
cal site located in downtown Mexico City used by nuns of the Franciscan Order from 1681 to
1861 [19]. Burials of 239 individuals (90% of which were foetuses, neonates and infants) were
excavated from the remains of the convent in the 1990s, which were buried in the niches and
tombs [19]. Five individuals were selected for this study based on the appearance of skeletal
changes consistent with treponemal infection at the time of death. Of the five individuals, only
three individuals were positive for treponemal DNA: individual 94A, 94B and 133 (Fig 1, S1

 Fig). We estimated the age of these three individuals using a method based on dentition, as
dental development is considered a more reliable indicator of age than developmental or
degenerative skeletal changes [20]. The dental aging chart established by Ubelaker [21] was
developed using American indigenous populations; however, when evaluating dental aging
methods with a population of known ages, the Schour and Massler atlas [22] was found to
have a higher accuracy of age estimations in individuals in below the age of 5.4 years [23]. Both
methods were, therefore, employed to estimate the age of individuals as recommended previ-
ously [20, 21]. Our results reveal one perinatal individual (94B) and two infants (94A and 133)
[21, 24]. Archaeological context as well as pH—EH quantification studies suggest a burial date
during the Colonial period [19]. Radiocarbon dates of the individuals 94B and 133 suggest that

 both individuals were buried less than 350 years ago (younger than cal AD 1654 for 94B and
younger than cal AD 1669 for 133).
These individuals present signs of infection in the form of abnormal skeletal changes such
as periosteal reactive bone formation and diaphyseal expansion of long bones (Fig 1). Patho-
logical skeletal changes were observed macroscopically and descriptively recorded as outlined
by Buikstra and Ubelaker [25]. We recorded abnormal bone formation and bone destruction,
status at time of death (active or healing) and location and extent of the affected bone. The
resulting data was referenced to paleopathological and clinical literature [25–31]. The individ-
uals displayed varied skeletal completeness and differential preservation due to taphonomic
damage. The most consistent skeletal feature suggestive of infection present in the three indi-
viduals was periostitis, which included a multilayered periosteal reaction and dactylitis (Fig 1)
[32–35]. Periostitis, though not specific to treponemal disease is strongly associated with trepo-
nematosis. It has been described as a “third category” of skeletal indicators of treponematosis
and is present in greater frequency compared to other changes associated with treponemal dis-
ease such as cranial and dental changes [27]. Although these individuals (S1 Fig) do not display
pathognomonic dental changes such as Hutchinson’s incisors or “mulberry” (or Founier’s)
molars which are known to have a broad occurrence (33% and 27% respectively) in individuals
bearing a congenital infection of syphilis, they do display abnormal periosteal bone develop-
ment of the long bones and cranial bones [28]. To our knowledge, dental features associated
with congenital syphilis are restricted to permanent teeth and would only be confidently visible
around 6–9 months of age as only the sites of initiated ameloblast activity are visible before
then [27, 36]. Although each individual was represented by a differing number of skeletal ele-
ments, all individuals presented layered periostitis. Individual 94A, estimated to be a six
month-old infant based on skeletal development [24], displays a systemic, fulminating perios-
teal reaction present on the axial as well as the appendicular skeleton as illustrated by the
severely affected tibia in Fig 1. Also present in this individual was dactylitis (expansive periosti-
tis of the metacarpals), which is associated with treponematosis in the first year of life [27],
among other conditions [26]. Furthermore, this individual displays abnormal reactive bone on
the endocranial surface of the pars basilaris (Fig 1). Individual 94B is represented by fewer skel-
etal elements; however, periostitis suggestive of treponemal infection is still present on the ribs
and an unidentified long bone (Fig 1). Based on the crown formation of the incisors and
molars this individual is estimated to have died at birth +/- 2 months. Individual 133 presents
bilateral periosteal reaction appearing to be active at time of death with extensive involvement
of the appendicular and axial skeleton. As illustrated in Fig 1, the right femur of this individual
displays significant periosteal bone formation with some cortical resorption. This individual is
represented by a nearly complete, albeit fragmentary, skeleton, with four mandibular molars,
two maxillary incisors, and two canines. Dental elements from the individual were used to esti-
mate the age at death as six months (+/- 3 months) post partum [21].
The skeletal changes displayed by the three individuals suggest treponemal infection that is
possibly congenital given their young ages [26, 37]; however, the nature of the skeletal changes,
being non-specific yet suggestive of treponemal infection emphasizes the importance of analy-
sis through molecular paleopathological methods. Ancient DNA provides the possibility to
both identify a causative infectious organism and explore its ecological and evolutionary
history.
Genome-wide enrichment, assembly and analysis of the T. pallidum DNA
Long bones with lesions suggestive of treponemal infections were sampled for all five individu-
als; ancient DNA was extracted [38] and double stranded next generation sequencing libraries

 were constructed for all samples [39, 40]. To reduce the background of environmental DNA,
whole-genome array capture for T. pallidum subspecies [41] was conducted. After Illumina
sequencing to a depth of 98 to 204.5 million pre-processed pair-end reads, mapping to the ref-
erence genome (NC_021490.2) and duplicate removal, between 71,524 and 128,419 unique
DNA sequencing reads were retrieved for individuals 133, 94A and 94B, resulting in an aver-
age of 3.25 to 7.72-fold genome coverage with a duplication factor of 28.64 to 37.25 and 57–
94% of the reference genome covered at least 3-fold (Table 1).
Analysis and authenticity of the retrieved T. pallidum and human DNA
To assess the authenticity of the captured T. pallidum DNA we analyzed nucleotide misincor-
poration patterns characteristic of ancient DNA [42, 43]. The observed DNA damage patterns
of 10% to 17% C to T damage at the terminal base of the DNA fragments support the ancient
origin of the retrieved T. pallidum DNA (Table 1). Human mitochondrial fragments were
simultaneously enriched via a streptavidin-based bead capture [44] resulting in complete mito-
chondrial genomes with haplogroups found today in Central America (D1i2 for 94A & 94B
and H1c+152 for 133). Consistent with the ancient pathogen, 11% to 17% DNA damage was
observed at the terminal ends, thus supporting their authenticity (Table 1). Contamination of
the human mitochondrial DNA calculated using the program Schmutzi [45] in all three sam-
ples was estimated at less than 2% (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of the historic T. pallidum genomes
We reconstructed a phylogeny for the three historic and 39 publicly available modern T. palli-
dum genomes [41] using different reconstruction methods. Our Maximum Likelihood (Fig
2A) and Maximum Parsimony (S2A Fig) trees position two of the historic strains (94A, 94B)
on the branch of the modern syphilis-causing T. pallidum ssp. pallidum strains, while the third
historic strain (133) falls with the modern yaws-causing T. pallidum ssp. pertenue strains. A
precise placement of sample 133, however, within the yaws clade cannot be further resolved
owing to its lower coverage. The strains 94A and 94B are very similar and differ only in one
single position unique to 94A (237,661) in the gene TPANIC_RS01145 coding for a cobalt
ABC transporter ATP-binding protein. Twenty-seven SNP positions are unique to 94A and
94B while three SNP positions are specific to sample 133 (S2 Table). In the Maximum Likeli-
hood tree they branch within the SS14 clade, while they fall basal on the syphilis branch in the

 Maximum Parsimony tree with reduced bootstrap support. This phenomenon could be linked
to DNA mosaic patterns, such as those identified previously in three T. pallidum strains [46–
48], leading to the suggestion that T. pallidum strains may horizontally recombine [49].
Analysis of ambiguous SNP positions in the historic genomes
To further investigate this phenomenon we performed several analyses. We constructed a
Bayesian phylogenetic tree from 1,061 SNP positions after deletion of positions with missing
data from a SNP alignment of the historic strains 94A and 94B with Fribourg-Blanc, Bosnia_A,
Nichols, Sea81-4, Mexico_A and SS14 using BEAST2 [50]. The uncertainty in the branching
pattern of 94A and 94B was visualized using Densitree [51] by overlaying the different tree
topologies from the BEAST2 run (Fig 2B). We found the highest support for an ancestral
placement in 82.16% of the tree states (Fig 2B, blue color). Only 17.66% of the tree states (Fig
2B, red color) support the branching of the historic strains within the SS14 clade, and 0.18% of
the tree states support a trifurcation of the 94A and 94B strains, the SS14 clade (SS14, Mexi-
co_A) and the Nichols clade (Nichols, Sea81-4).
To study the derived SNPs that the historic strains share with different clades in more detail
we also conducted a comparative SNP analysis using 2,294 SNPs among a complete set of 42 T.
pallidum strains and identified the following: for 94A and 94B, 22 SNPs and 30 SNPs, respec-
tively, support an ancestral position (Fribourg-Blanc clade), 19 and 24 SNPs, respectively, sup-
port a position in the SS14 clade, and 4 and 5 SNPs, respectively, support a position in the
Nichols clade (Fig 2C). In general, the loci of these shared SNPs are spread across the genome
and are not specific to certain regions.
ClonalFrameML [52] showed evidence of recombination as previously described [41]:
depending on the applied model we detected between 13 (standard model) and 16 (per-branch
model) predicted recombination events corresponding to the common ancestor of 94A and 94B
(S3 Table). The combination of recombination events from both models (standard and per-
branch) was analyzed by comparing these regions to SNP positions that 94A and 94B share with
different clades (S1 Table). Most of the regions are shared with Fribourg-Blanc and thereby fur-
ther support the ancestral positioning of the historic strains. We also found one recombination
event (346215–347572; TPANIC_RS01590) that is congruent with previous reports on recombi-
nation in two genes (TPANIC_RS01590, TPANIC_RS02370) in the contemporary Mexico_A
strain [46]. Interestingly, for TPANIC_RS02370 no recombination event was observed in the
common ancestor of 94A and 94B pointing to the possibility of a recombination event that hap-
pened later in time. We identify multiple regions where the common ancestor of 94A and 94B
shows putative recombination events with the ancestors of TPA (pallidum subspecies), TPE (perte-
nue subspecies) and TEN (endemicum subspecies) suggestive of inter-strain recombination as has
been proposed earlier [46–48]. Furthermore, the genes TPANIC_RS04240, TPANIC_RS04770
and TPANIC_RS05095, which were previously proposed to be recombining [47–49], were also
detected as part of potentially recombining regions in our analysis (S3 Table).

cause yaws and subspecies endemicum causes bejel. (B) Bayesian trees visualized in Densitree overlaying phylogenetic trees based on the most probable topologies. Blue

 To assess the effects of these findings in the context of single-gene phylogenies, we tested
different model topologies (S2B and S2C Fig) on 1,028 genes in a TREE-PUZZLE analysis
[53]. Out of 1,028 genes, 544, 564 and 509 genes in strains 94A, 94B and 133 have at least one
informative SNP in the gene alignment, of which 221, 180 and 246, respectively, do not reject
any of the model trees. Among the remaining genes, 199 genes of strain 133 rejected any posi-
tioning of the strain within the syphilis clades, while for strains 94A and 94B, 265 and 322
genes, respectively, reject any position within the yaws clade. For all remaining genes, the
rejected tree topologies are listed in S1 Table. We found the highest support for an ancestral
placement of 94A and 94B with only seven and eight genes rejecting this positioning (S1
Table). For the third historic strain, 133, its positioning in the yaws clade has the highest sup-
port only rejected by one gene (proA; TPANIC_RS01715), which contains a SNP (position
376,586) that is specifically shared with Nichols (S1 Table).
Virulence factor analysis
The presence of 61 genes previously thought to be related to virulence based on other studies was
evaluated in the ancient and modern strains. This included the Tpr family, various outer mem-
brane proteins, adhesion proteins, lipoproteins and a few other classes [54–60]. The ancient
strains identified as syphilis harbor all of these factors except TPANIC_RS04235 a homolog of the
FadL family that enables the transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) as well as other hydro-
phobic nutrients [61]. In general, Treponema pallidum seems to harbor altogether five FadL ortho-
logs [62], of which the other four are present in the ancient strains. In addition, previous studies
have described a deletion of the gene TPANIC_1030 in the pertenue strains [41, 63], which is also
confirmed in the ancient pertenue strain 133 (S3 Fig and S4 Table).
Discussion
The origin of syphilis and the evolutionary history of treponemal diseases are subjects of on-
going debate. Ancient T. pallidum genomes have the potential to provide evidence to address
many questions raised in this context. Here we provide the first historic genomes of T. palli-
dum subspecies. Our data is of sufficient resolution to allow for a global genomic and phyloge-
netic analysis. Although our historic genomes cannot directly contribute to discussions about
the origin of syphilis due to their post–Columbian age, our study demonstrates the potential of
successfully obtaining authentic historic T. pallidum genomes when focusing on treponemal
cases in young individuals. More historic T. pallidum genomes, in particular from the pre-
Columbian era, could be able to settle the debate. However, the selection of samples, retrieval
of ancient T. pallidum DNA and comparative genomic analyses pose multiple challenges.
We find strong evidence that the bone lesions in two historical treponematosis cases, one in
a perinate and another in an infant, were caused by T. pallidum ssp. pallidum. Furthermore,
we present skeletal and genomic evidence of T. pallidum ssp. pertenue infection in an infant
individual estimated to be six months (+/- 3 months) of age at time of death. This individual
calls to attention the possible existence of congenital yaws, which has been debated in the liter-
ature due to the apparent inability of T. pallidum ssp. pertenue to cross the placental barrier,
despite the description of potential historical examples [64, 65]. Variation in the ability for ver-
tical transmission has been demonstrated within T. pallidum subspecies, for example the Haiti
B strain of T. pallidum ssp. pallidum also seems unable to cross the placenta [66, 67] suggesting
the possibility of such variation within the pertenue subspecies strains. Thus, the debate of
whether T. pallidum ssp. pertenue can [64, 65], or cannot [67, 68] cross the placental barrier to
cause a form of congenital treponematosis remains unresolved. The severity of the skeletal
response in individual 133 together with the young age at death (6 months, +/- 3 months)

 supports a diagnosis of congenital yaws; however, the known pathophysiology of T. pallidum
ssp. pertenue infections, namely that skeletal changes can occur in infants infected up to four
months post partum [64, 65], challenges an unequivocal diagnosis of congenital yaws for this
case and highlights the importance of further attention to this research question.
Although the individuals included in our study present skeletal changes consistent with but
not limited to treponematosis, producing a differential diagnosis of a greater resolution was
not possible due to the shared signs of yaws and syphilis and the differential preservation of
the skeletons, which compromised the ability to visualize diagnostic patterning of the patho-
logical changes. Likewise, such challenges exist in the diagnosis of clinical cases whereby evi-
dence of the overlapping modes of transmission and clinical features of syphilis and yaws can
be found in biomedical research on modern T. pallidum strains, such as T. pallidum ssp. palli-
dum causing yaws-like frambesiform lesions [69] or T. pallidum ssp. pertenue invading neuro-
logical and cardiovascular tissue as seen in syphilis [64, 70]. However, our genetic results
allowed us to identify syphilis infection in two of the individuals (94A, 94B) whereas one indi-
vidual (94B) presents a likely congenital infection of syphilis. In addition, we identified yaws in
one infant individual (133). Our work demonstrates the value of molecular identification of
ancient pathogens, particularly as applied to treponemal diseases where skeletal responses to
the various pathogenic subspecies are often shared, challenging the development of a confident
diagnosis through osteological observation [27]. Molecular analyses not only provide greater
resolution to the paleopathological diagnosis of osteological changes but they also provide rele-
vant details related to the history and evolution of pathogens we still encounter today.
In the phylogenetic comparison of our historic strains with contemporary T. pallidum
strains, we detected ambiguous SNP patterns in our strains that may suggest a number of
recombination events in its evolutionary past. Although T. pallidum subspecies are thought to
be clonal [71], several studies on modern treponemal DNA have reported evidence for recom-
bination events in various T. pallidum subspecies [41, 46–48]. As recombination mechanisms
are active during treponemal infections, TPA strains could have integrated some genomic
regions from TPE strains during a co-infection of the same host [46, 48]. The presence of yaws
in sample 133 and syphilis in samples 94A and 94B indicates that pertenue and pallidum infec-
tions were both prevalent among individuals in this region, which could have opened the pos-
sibility of recombination events facilitated by co-infections with these subspecies. Further
research on ancient and modern T. pallidum strains is needed to assess this aspect of their evo-
lution, which should be borne in mind in phylogenetic assessments.
Various studies on the pathogenicity of treponemes have suggested a number of genes
potentially involved in virulence, most of which encode proteins that reside at the host-patho-
gen interface. Regarding the presence and absence of these genes we did not detect a difference
in our ancient strains compared to modern ones with the exception of the FadL homolog TPA-
NIC_RS04235, which is absent in our ancient syphilis strains. FadL facilitates the transport of
long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), which are metabolic energy sources and can also aid in patho-
genesis. Uptake of high concentrations of LCFAs released by host cells would assist in suppres-
sion of inflammatory responses thereby enabling the pathogen to colonize the host more
efficiently [72, 73]. However, there are four other FadL homologs present and it is unclear if
they target different compounds with varying specificity [57]. Thus, it currently remains an
open question if the absence of one of the FadL homologs could influence phenotype.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that retrieval of authentic ancient T. pallidum DNA
from historic tissues to the resolution of genomic reconstruction is indeed possible, despite
earlier pessimism [74]. The presence of T. pallidum ssp. pertenue in old world monkeys [17,
75] and our finding that two T. pallidum subspecies likely caused similar osteological manifes-
tations in the past may suggest a more complex evolutionary history of T. pallidum than

 previously assumed. Furthermore, our detection of possible recombination events in the past
highlights an important, and currently underrepresented, analytical component that should be
accommodated in future models of T. pallidum’s history. Our results point out the necessity of
ancient T. pallidum genome-level data to better understand both osteological manifestations
caused by infection of the various forms and their potential for genomic recombination in the
past. Ultimately, these analyses may be able to resolve the origin of syphilis and the evolution-
ary history of treponemal diseases in general.
Methods
DNA extractions and library preparation
For all five samples, DNA from 50 mg of bone powder was extracted in clean room facilities dedi-
cated to ancient DNA work at the University of Tu
¨bingen using a silica purification protocol [38]
with the following modifications: the Zymo-Spin V funnels (Zymo Research) were bleached and
UV irradiated for 60 minutes and the total elution volume was raised to 100 μl. To obtain double-
stranded Illumina libraries, aliquots of 20 μl of extract were used in a well-established protocol
[39] and sample-specific barcodes were added to both library adapters by amplification after
adapter ligation [39, 40]. For all samples, two sets of double-stranded Illumina libraries were cre-
ated: with and without UDG treatment [76]. Extraction and library blanks were treated accord-
ingly. After quantification of the indexed libraries using the IS5 and IS6 primer set [39], the
DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Biozym) and the Lightcycler 96 (Roche), a second ampli-
fication was carried out in 100 μl reactions for each library with 5 μl of library template, 4 units of
AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), 1 unit of 10X AccuPrime buffer
(containing dNTPs) and 0.3 μM of IS5 and IS6 primers [39] and the following thermal profile:
2-min initial denaturation at 94˚C, followed by 6 to 16 cycles consisting of 30-sec denaturation at
94˚C, a 30-sec annealing at 60˚C and a 2-min elongation at 68˚C and a 5-min final elongation at
68˚C. Subsequently, a purification using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Ger-
many) and quantification with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chips was performed.
For the three samples positive for T. pallidum DNA (94A, 94B and 133), a second extract
from 50 mg of bone powder as described above and additional single-stranded libraries were
created [77], and the previously described procedures were followed after the library prepara-
tion step.
Genome wide enrichment and sequencing of the T. pallidum DNA
The genome wide enrichment for T. pallidum DNA was performed via two rounds of hybrid-
ization capture using a one-million-feature Agilent microarray and a well-established protocol
[78]. The design of the microarray was previously detailed by Arora and coauthors [41]. After
array enrichment the libraries were amplified, purified and quantified as described above.
Paired-end dual index sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform
with 2�100+7+7 cycles using the manufacturer’s protocols for multiplex sequencing (TruSeq
PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS).
For the positive samples a second enrichment including an additional set of single-stranded
libraries and further sequencing was performed as detailed before.
Processing of the sequencing reads and reconstruction of the T. pallidum
genomes
Paired-end reads from the three ancient samples, 28 modern samples [41] and simulated reads
(reads of length 100 and offset 1) from 11 complete genomes were pre-processed, mapped and

 post-processed using the EAGER pipeline version 1.92 [79]. After trimming of adaptors and
filtering for reads with a minimum base quality of 20 and a minimum read length of 30bp,
overlapping forward and reverse reads were merged. These merged and unmerged forward
and reverse reads were mapped to the T. p. ssp. pallidum Nichols (NC_021490.2) complete
genome as a reference with BWA [80] using a mapping stringency of 0.1 (-n) and a mapping
quality filter of 37. Duplicated reads were eliminated using PICARD tools Mark Duplicates
[81]. Reads from non-UDG treated libraries were used to estimate the authenticity of the
ancient DNA samples. DNA damage in the ancient samples was quantified using MapDamage
2.0 [82]. SNPs were called using UnifiedGenotyper of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)
[83]. These resulting VCF files were combined and compared using an in-house tool (Multi-
VCFAnalyser). Reference bases and SNPs were called with a minimal coverage of 3 and a min-
imal major allele frequency of 90%. Calls below this threshold are represented as “N”. The
annotation and effect of SNPs within protein-coding regions are identified using SnpEff [84].
All SNPs were concatenated for phylogenetic analysis and downstream analysis.
Enrichment and sequencing of the human mtDNA
Along with bacterial DNA, human mitochondrial DNA from the three ancient samples
was sequenced. The paired-end reads were mapped to the HG19 mitochondrial genome
(NC_012920.1) using the EAGER pipeline version 1.92 [79]. MapDamage 2.0 [82] was used to
estimate DNA damage. Estimation of contamination with modern DNA and generation of
consensus sequences was performed using Schmutzi version 1.0 [45]. Haplogroups were deter-
mined using Haplogrep 2 [85].
Phylogenetic analysis of the T. pallidum genomes
The concatenated full genome alignment (equal in length to the reference NC_021490.2) of all
42 samples (includes the three ancient samples) was used to assess the relationship of the
ancient samples with modern treponemes. Phylogenetic trees were built using RAxML [86]
and MEGA 7.014 [87]. Maximum Likelihood trees were built with the GTR+GAMMA+I sub-
stitution model with a proportion of Invariant sites of 0.01 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Evo-
lutionary rates of the sites were estimated based on Gamma distributions with 8 categories.
Maximum Parsimony trees were generated for all sites of the full genome alignment using the
Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting (SPR) search method and 1000 bootstrap replicates. BEAST2.4.2
[50] was used to reconstruct phylogenies for the SNP alignment of 94A, 94B and selected rep-
resentative genomes (Nichols, Sea81-4, SS14, Mexico_A, Fribourg-Blanc, BosniaA) after com-
plete deletion of sites with missing data. Bayesian phylogenetic tree states were generated with
a GTR-based substitution model with 8 Gamma categories and the proportion of invariant
sites estimated from the data. Substitution frequencies of all nucleotide pairs are estimated
with CT pair initial frequency of 1.0. A strict clock model was set with an initial rate of 0.005.
The priors for the trees were set to Coalescent Constant Population model. All default parame-
ters were used for priors after setting the population model. For the MCMC runs the chain
length was set for 1,000,000,000 steps with a burn-in of 10% (100,000,000) and cataloguing
tree states and log information for every 10,000 steps. Results were analyzed for stability using
Tracer version 1.6 [88]. All the trees were visualized using Densitree version 2.2.5 [51].
Detection of mosaic patterns in the T. pallidum genomes
The contribution of SNPs of the ancient samples was analyzed in detail to resolve the uncer-
tainty of topological differences in the phylogenetic trees using Maximum Likelihood and
Bayesian approaches. SNPs from ancient samples 94A and 94B were compared with Fribourg-

 Blanc (representing the Yaws clade), Nichols (representing the Nichols clade) and SS14 (repre-
senting the SS14 clade) using an in-house tool (MultiVCFAnalyser). SNPs supporting the
ancestral position are SNPs that are shared specifically with Fribourg-Blanc (ancestral SNPs)
but are derived in SS14 and Nichols. SNPs supporting the SS14 position are SNPs that are
shared specifically with SS14 (derived SNPs) but are ancestral in Fribourg-Blanc and Nichols.
SNPs supporting the Nichols position are SNPs that are shared specifically with Nichols
(derived SNPs) but are ancestral in Fribourg-Blanc and SS14.
ClonalFrameML version 1.-178 [52] was used to predict recombination patterns in the
ancient strains. Using a Maximum Likelihood tree generated with RAxML as the initial tree
and the full genome alignment of 42 samples (three ancient samples included), recombination
events were predicted by using the standard model of the Baum-Welch expectation maximiza-
tion algorithm (EM) for 1000 iterations with default parameters. These parameters were
applied to all branches. The recombination parameters were also estimated for each individual
branch (per-branch model) with a variability of recombination parameters of 0.1. The pre-
dicted recombination events from the standard run and the per-branch run were compared
and combined.
For more in depth analysis of any ambiguity in branching patterns that contradict the Max-
imum Likelihood phylogenetic tree we used TREE-PUZZLE version 5.3 [53]. It compares
various models of tree topologies to the constructed maximum likelihood tree and finds the
rejected tree models using various statistical tests. For each of the three ancient samples an
individual full genome alignment fasta file was generated (equal in length to the reference
NC_021490.2) with Nichols, Sea81-4, SS14, Mexico_A, Bosnia_A, and Fribourg-Blanc using
an in-house tool (MutliVCFAnalyser). All ambiguous bases are denoted as “N” in the full
genome alignment. For each gene, the alignment spanning the gene coordinates from the
NC_021490.2 annotation file was extracted and modified to phylip 3.0 format. TREE-PUZZLE
[53] was then used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from the gene alignments and to compare
them with our nine pre-defined model tree topologies. With the Fribourg-Blanc, Bosnia_A,
Nichols, Sea81-4, SS14 and Mexico_A taxa, a backbone tree topology was created using
RAxML. Independently, 94A, 94B and 133 were placed at every possible position on the tree
backbone to generate nine model trees that were used to reconstruct the Maximum Likelihood
tree from the gene alignment (S2B Fig). Model trees 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 represent the branching
of 94A, 94B and 133 with Fribourg-Blanc, Bosnia_A, SS14, Mexico_A, Nichols and Sea81-4
respectively. Model tree 3 represents an ancestral branching point that splits the sexually trans-
mitted treponemes (T. p. ssp. pallidum) and non-sexually transmitted treponemes (T. p. ssp.
pertenue and T. p. ssp. endemicum). Model tree 4 represents a branching that is at a basal posi-
tion within the SS14 clade (ancestral to the split of SS14 and Mexico_A). Model tree 5 repre-
sents a branching that is at a basal position within the Nichols clade (ancestral to the split of
Nichols and Sea81). TREE-PUZZLE [53] generated a Maximum Likelihood tree with the GTR
substitution model and evolutionary rate estimation using Gamma distribution with eight cat-
egories. The search procedure was set to evaluate the user-defined trees (nine model trees
here). Initial Parameters were estimated using a Quartet sampling and neighbor-joining tree
internally. TREE-PUZZLE generated a comparison table of statistical tests by comparing the
topology of the nine gene trees reconstructed from the nine model trees. TREE-PUZZLE
reports parsimoniously informative SNPs. For each gene, SNPs were identified and compared
with the parsimoniously informative SNPs from TREE-PUZZLE. Genes without any SNPs
were discarded and remaining genes were evaluated. Using Expected Likelihood Weight
(ELW) statistics, a phylogenetic gene tree was considered rejecting any of the nine model trees
based on a threshold of 0.05. TREE-PUZZLE was run for 1028 genes. For robust results, the
process was repeated 100 times with the same parameters for 94A, 94B, 133.

 Virulence factor analysis
A gene presence/absence analysis was performed to assess the virulence factors harbored by
the ancient genomes. A set of 61 gene sequences potentially related to virulence [55–57] were
extracted from the Nichols reference genome (NC_021490.2) with 200 bases upstream and
downstream (S4 Table). Reads from the 42 genomes including the ancient genomes were
mapped to the gene sequences of the set with a mapping quality threshold of 0 using BWA.
Read duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicates as described above. The coverage over
each gene was calculated using genomeCoverageBed in BEDTools version 2.250 [89]. Gene
coverage by the reads is estimated at 1x and visualized using ggplots2 package in R (S3 Fig).
Ethic statement
Research on historic human remains presents the ethical problem that informed consent can
no longer be obtained from the individuals on whom the research is being conducted. In
many cases it is also impossible to identify down close relatives that would be able to provide
an informed consent to conduct genetic or anthropological research of their ancestors. Our
research, however, does not include culturally sensitive material such as Native American- or
Australian Aboriginal populations, whereby it is necessary to acquire the informed consent of
the descendants in order to conduct research. Furthermore, we focus on infectious diseases
that potentially affect all human populations regardless of cultural identity. The samples ana-
lyzed in this manuscript are part of Santa Isabel collection in Mexico City. For this study we
obtained a permit from the Council of Archaeology, National Institute of Anthropology and
History (INAH, Mexico City, Mexico) to analyze the individuals from the Santa Isabel collec-
tion (official notice number: 401.B(4)19.2015/36/1027; approved partial report number:
401.1S.3-2017/1065). In addition, this work is also part of an ongoing research project on vene-
real and congenital syphilis identifying osseous remodeling and differential diagnostic led by
