Ramadan fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and is compulsory for all healthy Mus-
lims from puberty onwards. Exemptions exist for people with serious medical conditions,
including many with diabetes, but a large number will participate, often against medical
advice. Ensuring the optimal care of these patients during Ramadan is crucial. The Interna-
tional Diabetes Federation (IDF) and Diabetes and Ramadan (DAR) International Alliance
have come together to deliver comprehensive guidelines on this subject. The key areas cov-
ered include epidemiology, the physiology of fasting, risk stratification, nutrition advice
and medication adjustment. The IDF-DAR Practical Guidelines should enhance knowledge
surrounding the issue of diabetes and Ramadan fasting, thereby empowering healthcare
professionals to give the most up-to-date advice and the best possible support to their
patients during Ramadan.

Introduction
Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and
is obligatory for all healthy adult Muslims. Within the Muslim
community, there is an intense desire to participate in fast-
ing, even among those who are eligible for exemption. The
timing of Ramadan is based on the lunar calendar (355 days
per year), which means that the start of Ramadan varies from
year to year. In some parts of the world, daylight can last up to
20 h in the peak of summer. Climate conditions also vary
according to the date of Ramadan, with people fasting in very
dry and hot weather some years.
Some regions with a high Muslim population, including
the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia, are expected to
see the number of patients with diabetes more than double
in the next 25 years [1]. The Epidemiology of Diabetes and
Ramadan (EPIDIAR) study performed in 2001 found that
42.8% and 78.7% of patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM/T2DM), respectively, fasted for at least 15 days
during Ramadan [2]. More recently, the CREED study reported
that 94.2% of T2DM patients fasted for at least 15 days and
63.6% fasted every day [3].
For fasting Muslims, the onset of Ramadan heralds a sud-
den shift in meal times and sleep patterns. This has impor-
tant implications for physiology, with ensuing changes in
the rhythm and magnitude of fluctuations in several homeo-
static and endocrine processes. Sleeping patterns are often
altered
during
Ramadan
and
several
circadian
rhythm
changes have been noted, including changes in body temper-
ature and cortisol levels [4–7]. When fasting, insulin resis-
tance/deficiency can lead to excessive glycogen breakdown
and increased gluconeogenesis in patients with diabetes, as
well as ketogenesis in patients with T1DM. As a result, the
risks facing patients with diabetes, including hypoglycaemia,
hyperglycaemia,
diabetic
ketoacidosis,
dehydration
and
thrombosis, are heightened during Ramadan [8].
Ramadan fasting, therefore, represents a challenge to both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Existing recom-
mendations on the management of people with diabetes who
fast during Ramadan are mostly based on expert opinion
rather than evidence gained from clinical studies. With so
many Muslims with diabetes choosing to fast and with the
numbers predicted to rise sharply over the coming years,
there is an immediate requirement for evidence-based practi-
cal
management
guidelines.
The
International
Diabetes
Federation
(IDF)
and
the
Diabetes
and
Ramadan
(DAR)
International Alliance have come together to deliver compre-
hensive guidance on this subject. The IDF-DAR Practical Guide-
lines provide HCPs with relevant background information and
practical recommendations, allowing them to deliver the best
possible care and support to patients with diabetes during
Ramadan, while minimising the risk of complications.

Methods
The IDF and DAR International Alliance invited recognised
experts in the field to develop joint practical guidelines for
the management of diabetes during Ramadan. This panel
met on several occasions, and extensive literature searches
for studies related to diabetes and Ramadan fasting were con-
ducted. Relevant publications were identified and results
from pertinent clinical studies (see supplementary informa-
tion for details) were used to develop the recommendations
outlined in this article. Where evidence was missing, expert
opinion was agreed upon. The full version of these IDF-DAR
Practical Guidelines are available for free download on the web-
sites of the IDF (http://www.idf.org/guidelines/diabetes-in-
ramadan)
and

International
Alliance

Physiology
of
Ramadan
fasting
and
diabetes
As a result of daylight fasting, the time between meals during
Ramadan is much longer than at other times of the year, and
sleep patterns often change. The physiological impact of such
changes is most marked when Ramadan falls during the
longer summer days in countries at higher latitudes.
Typically, sleep is broken before dawn to enable Muslims to
eat before fasting begins (suhoor) [5]. Many will return to
sleep afterwards and wake for a second time to start the
day, and some may sleep in the afternoon. Following the
evening meal (iftar), many Muslims stay awake late into the
night. Although the physiological relevance of these sleep
changes is unknown, there is evidence to suggest that glucose
intolerance and insulin resistance may be linked to sleep

diabetes (B) [14].

 deprivation [9–11]. Shifts in cortisol circadian rhythm have
been observed during Ramadan fasting [7], which may be
partly responsible for the feeling of lethargy felt by some Mus-
lims during Ramadan. Hunger rating increases progressively
during fasting hours and can be intense by iftar time [12].
Interestingly, as Ramadan progresses, this tends to be less
severe in women compared with men [12].
Fasting can result in excessive glycogenolysis and gluco-
neogenesis in individuals with T1DM or T2DM, and increased
ketogenesis in those with T1DM [13]. As a consequence, indi-
viduals with diabetes are at increased risk of hypoglycaemia,
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [8]. A contin-
uous glucose monitoring (CGM) study before and during
Ramadan found a remarkable stability of blood glucose dur-
ing fasting hours in healthy subjects, followed by a minimal
rise in blood glucose at iftar (Fig. 1A) [14]. However, major
intra- and inter-individual variability in CGM profiles were
observed in patients with diabetes. A rapid rise in glucose
level after iftar was seen (Fig. 1B), most probably due to the
carbohydrate-rich foods typically taken at this meal [14].
Ramadan fasting can be associated with favourable physi-
ological
changes
among
healthy
individuals,
such
as
decreased body weight and beneficial changes in lipid profile
[15]. The picture is not so clear for individuals with diabetes
and the risks posed by the pathophysiology that disrupts nor-
mal glucose homeostatic mechanisms need further studies.
4.
Risk
stratification
of
individuals
with
diabetes during Ramadan
The principal risks for people with diabetes who participate in
Ramadan are hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, DKA, dehydra-
tion and thrombosis. The EPIDIAR study recorded higher rates
of severe hypoglycaemia in people with T1DM or T2DM dur-
ing Ramadan compared with before Ramadan (4.7-fold and
7.5-fold increases, respectively) [2]. Hyperglycaemia incidence
increased 5-fold among patients with T2DM [2]. A study in
Pakistan, carried out by Ahmedani et al., found that of the
388 patients with diabetes who chose to fast, symptomatic
hypoglycaemia was reported by 35.3% and 23.2% of patients
with T1DM and T2DM, respectively, and symptomatic hyper-
glycaemia by 33.3% and 15.4%, respectively [16]. Lower figures
were observed in the CREED study, where only 8.8% of
patients with T2DM reported a hypoglycaemic event; a major-
ity of these episodes, however, required further assistance or
breaking of the fast [3]. In another study, the rate and duration
of hospital admission for DKA during Ramadan and the fol-
lowing month (Shawal) were higher than the average monthly
rate over the preceding six months. Many of those with DKA
during Ramadan had experienced DKA in the previous few
months [17].
Taking all these risks into account, it is easy to see why
religious regulations, as well as medical recommendations,
allow exemption from fasting for some people with diabetes
[8,18,19]. However, for many such individuals, fasting is a dee-
ply spiritual experience and they will insist on taking part,
perhaps unaware of the risks they are taking. HCPs caring
for these patients must be conscious of the potential dangers
and should quantify and stratify the risks for every patient
individually in order to provide the best possible care. Safety
of fasting is paramount and various elements should be con-
sidered when quantifying the risk for such patients, such as
type of diabetes, type of medication, presence of comorbidi-
ties and personal circumstances [18]. These factors will vary
for each patient, emphasising the need for an individualised
approach.
The 2005 American Diabetes Association (ADA) recom-
mendations for management of diabetes during Ramadan,
and its 2010 update, categorised people with diabetes into
four risk groups (very high risk, high risk, moderate risk and
low risk) [8,18]. The CREED study reported that 62.6% of physi-
cians referred to guidelines for the management of fasting
and, of these, the majority were using the ADA recommenda-
tions [3]. Surprisingly, the numbers of days fasted by the high-
est and the lowest risk groups only varied by 3 days,
indicating that either these risk categories are not efficiently
applied by HCPs or people with diabetes are ignoring medical
recommendations. A recent survey of nearly 200 physicians,
mainly from the Middle East and North Africa, revealed that
not all high risk categories were identified by those providing
care to patients with diabetes during Ramadan [20].
The IDF-DAR Practical Guidelines propose three categories of
risk, based on the most recent available information from
science and clinical practice during Ramadan fasting (Table 1).
These risk categories take into account a more practical
approach while recognising the need to consider the everyday
practice of many people with diabetes. Importantly, these rec-
ommendations have been approved by the Mofty of Egypt, the
highest religious regulatory authority in Egypt. Religious opin-
ion on fasting for each of the three categories is included in
the
risk
stratification
table
(Table
1).
All
patients
are
instructed to follow medical advice and should not fast if
the probability of harm is high. It should be noted that this
opinion may not reflect the religious rulings in all countries,
therefore further regional discussions are needed. These rec-
ommendations also include some essential conditions that
need to be fulfilled by those who are considered high risk
but choose to fast against medical/religious advice.
Patients who are in the two highest categories of IDF-DAR
risk should not fast; however, as previously mentioned, many
of these patients will choose to do so. These patients need to
be aware of the risks associated with fasting, and of tech-
niques to decrease this risk. Those patients stratified to the
moderate/low risk category may be able to fast if both HCP
and patient agree, but appropriate advice and support must
be provided to ensure safety. Once a patient has been made
aware of the risks, they should be offered an individualised
management plan and be advised on the measures they can
take to minimise these risks, as listed in Table 1.

 minimise acute complications. Ramadan-focused diabetes
education has been shown to be effective in reducing the inci-
dence of hypoglycaemic events. The Ramadan Education and
Awareness in Diabetes (READ) study demonstrated a signifi-
cant decrease in the number of hypoglycaemic events in a
group of patients with T2DM that received diabetes education
(from nine events pre-Ramadan to just five during Ramadan)
compared with an increase (from nine to 36 events) in a con-
trol group that did not receive the educational advice
(p < 0.001) [21]. The impact of an educational programme on
the occurrence of diabetes complications during Ramadan
was also assessed in the Ramadan Diabetes Prospective study,
which revealed a downward trend in symptomatic hypogly-
caemic episodes from week 1 to week 4, with only one patient
experiencing
a
severe
hypoglycaemic
event
[22].
Self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is essential for high risk
patients that choose to fast and it should be emphasised that
testing does not invalidate religious fast. SMBG should be per-
formed multiple times during the day and, most importantly,
whenever symptoms of hypoglycaemia or acute illness occur
(Fig. 2). Patients should break the fast if blood glucose is
<70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or >300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) and
should not fast if they feel unwell [23]. Low risk patients also
need to perform SMBG at the following times: pre-suhoor,
midday, pre-iftar and whenever symptoms of hypoglycaemia
or acute illness occur [23].
During Ramadan, there is a dramatic change in eating pat-
terns compared with other months of the year. Dietary rec-
ommendations should be individualised and tailored to
patients’ lifestyle requirements, age, comorbidities and other
medical needs [24]. This makes dietary advice critically
important in the pre-Ramadan assessment. Accordingly, the
DAR International Alliance has developed the Ramadan
Nutrition Plan (RNP), a web-based tool designed to help HCPs
in delivering patient-specific medical nutrition therapy (MNT)
during Ramadan fasting (http://www.daralliance.org/daral-
liance/). Cultural and regional differences can make it chal-
lenging for HCPs to deliver individualised patient-applicable
dietary advice. To assist in this regard, the RNP includes meal
plans for different countries and in different languages. Meal
plans are categorised in several daily caloric targets (Fig. S1
supplementary information). This may aid HCPs and patients
to plan daily meals with the aim of maintaining body weight
if they are lean, or reducing body weight if they are over-
weight or obese. The RNP has been adopted for use in many
countries and it may allow patients with limited access to
HCPs to construct a healthy eating plan for Ramadan. More
details on RNP, the importance of MNT, avoidance of weight
gain and construction of a balanced dietary plan during
Ramadan are provided in the full version of the IDF-DAR Prac-
tical Guidelines.

Diabetes management during Ramadan
All patients with diabetes wishing to fast should have a pre-
Ramadan assessment with their HCP, ideally 6–8 weeks before
the start of Ramadan. This allows enough time to review the
patient’s medical history, stratify the risk of fasting and
develop a Ramadan management plan. The physician must
assess the patient’s glycaemic control, risk of hypoglycaemia

 and self-management capabilities, and ultimately advise the
patient on whether to fast or to seek exemption. A proposed
patient assessment flowchart can be found in Fig. 3.
6.1.
Pharmacological management of people with T2DM
A cornerstone of a Ramadan individualised management plan
is therapeutic modification. The type of medication the
patient is taking for diabetes management influences the
potential risks that fasting may cause and needs careful
attention within the plan. The following sections review the
available evidence for the use of medication during Ramadan
in patients with T2DM and use it to generate evidence-based
recommendations regarding treatment and any dose adjust-
ments that may be required. A summary of the recommenda-
tions for non-insulin therapies and insulin can be found in
Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Details of all studies reviewed in
this section can be found in supplementary information
(Table S1).
6.1.1.
Metformin and a-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose)
Severe hypoglycaemia in non-fasting patients receiving met-
formin and/or acarbose is rare. There are no randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) on these agents, however, metformin
and/or acarbose use in patients with T2DM during Ramadan
is considered safe. No dose modification is needed but tim-
ings should be changed depending on the frequency of dose
(Fig. 4).
6.1.2.
Thiazolidinediones (TZD)
Clinical data on pioglitazone use during Ramadan is limited
to one study [25]. This study found that compared with pla-
cebo, pioglitazone significantly improved glycaemic control
during the early, mid- and post-Ramadan periods. There
was no difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events
between the two treatment groups, but a significant increase
in weight of 3.02 kg (p = 0.001) was observed in the pioglita-
zone group compared with a non-significant loss in weight
(�0.46 kg) in the placebo group [25]. No adjustment to TZD
medication is needed during Ramadan and doses can be
taken with iftar or suhoor (Fig. 4).
6.1.3.
Short-acting insulin secretagogues (meglitinides)
Meglitinides such as repaglinide are usually taken before
meals. In two small observational studies, no hypoglycaemic
events were reported in patients treated with repaglinide dur-
ing Ramadan [26,27]. A third study demonstrated no differ-
ence
in
hypoglycaemia
when
compared
with
insulin
glargine or glimepiride, a sulphonylurea (SU) therapy [28].
Similarly, in two randomised parallel-group trials, a low
incidence of hypoglycaemic events was associated with
repaglinide treatment during Ramadan, occurring in similar

 proportions of patients treated with glibenclamide and glime-
piride [29,30]. The short duration of action and low risk of
hypoglycaemia of these agents make them appealing for
use in Ramadan. The daily dose (based on a three-meal dos-
ing) may be reduced or redistributed to two doses (taken
before iftar and suhoor) during Ramadan, according to meal
size (Fig. 4).
6.1.4.
Sulphonylureas (SU)
SUs are associated with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia com-
pared with other oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), which has
raised some concerns about their use during Ramadan. How-
ever, this risk varies across medications within this class due
to differing receptor interactions, binding affinities and dura-
tions of action.
In a multinational observational study of 1378 patients
with T2DM treated with SUs, approximately one-fifth of
patients experienced a symptomatic hypoglycaemic event
during Ramadan. When this was broken down by drug, the
highest
incidence
was
associated
with
glibenclamide
(25.6%),
followed
by
glimepiride
(16.8%),
and
gliclazide
(14.0%) [31]. Glibenclamide similarly showed the highest inci-
dence of hypoglycaemic events in other studies when com-
pared with second-generation SUs [32,33] and lowering the
dose of glibenclamide did not seem to reduce the incidence
of hypoglycaemia [34]. In some studies, the proportion of
patients on gliclazide who experienced symptomatic hypo-
glycaemic events has been found to be similar to the dipep-
tidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sitagliptin (6.6% vs. 6.7%,
respectively) or vildagliptin (6.0% vs. 8.7%, respectively), and
lower than sitagliptin in one study (1.8% vs. 3.8%, respec-
tively) [33,35,36]. The recorded incidence of hypoglycaemia
during Ramadan has also been low for glimepiride [29,37].
Data on glipizide are too sparse to provide specific advice on
its use in Ramadan.
These studies demonstrate that many patients with T2DM
may continue to use second-generation SUs and fast safely
during Ramadan. Glibenclamide should be used with caution
during Ramadan. The use of these drugs should be individu-
alised following clinician guidance, and medication adjust-
ments are outlined in Fig. 4.
6.1.5.
Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated effective improvements
in glycaemic control and weight loss, and are associated with
a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Because of this, these drugs
could be a safe treatment option for patients with T2DM dur-
ing Ramadan. However, certain safety concerns have been
raised, such as an increase in dehydration or postural
hypotension as well as the risk of ketoacidosis [38,39]. Cur-
rently, only one study has published data on the use of SGLT2
inhibitors during Ramadan. Patients with T2DM were ran-
domised to receive either dapagliflozin or to continue with
SU therapy. Significantly fewer patients in the dapagliflozin
group reported hypoglycaemia than in the SU arm (6.9% vs.
28.8%, respectively; p = 0.002). Incidences of postural hypoten-
sion were greater in the dapagliflozin group but did not reach
significance [40], and no increased risk of dehydration was

 evident with dapagliflozin treatment [41]. A recent survey of
physicians’ views on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors during
Ramadan for the treatment of patients with T2DM reported
that the majority (70.6%) considered them suitable and safe
for some patients [20]. Patients deemed more at risk of com-
plications, such as the elderly, patients with renal impair-
ment, hypotensive individuals or those taking diuretics,
should not be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Most physicians
agreed that SGLT2 inhibitors should be taken with iftar, and
the importance of taking on extra fluids during the evening
after a fast was highlighted [20]. Due to the low risk of hypo-
glycaemia with SGLT2 inhibitors, no dose adjustment is
required (Fig. 4).
6.1.6.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors
Four RCTs have examined the effects of switching from SU
therapy to either vildagliptin or sitagliptin prior to Ramadan
compared with continuing on SUs [31,33,36,42]. The largest
of these studies compared the incidence of self-reported
hypoglycaemic events in 1066 patients with T2DM treated
with sitagliptin or SUs during Ramadan. Overall, the risk of
hypoglycaemia was significantly lower in patients on the
sitagliptin-based regimen compared with those continuing
with SU treatment (relative risk ratio [95%CI] = 0.51 [0.34,
0.75]; p < 0.001) [33]. The risk of hypoglycaemia between sita-
gliptin and gliclazide were equal. A similar risk ratio (0.52
[0.29, 0.94]; p = 0.028) was recorded in a second RCT compar-
ing sitagliptin with SU treatment [35]. Neither of these two
studies investigated glycaemic control. In the multinational
STEADFAST study, patients with T2DM were randomised to
receive either vildagliptin or gliclazide during Ramadan. No
significant difference in the reporting of any hypoglycaemic
event was observed between the two groups. However, the
proportion of patients experiencing at least one confirmed
hypoglycaemic event during Ramadan was lower on vildaglip-
tin compared with gliclazide (3.0% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.039) [36].
Good glycaemic control was demonstrated in both arms of
study.
A number of observational studies have examined the effi-
cacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitor treatment during Ramadan
[32,43–46]. In the VECTOR study, no self-reported hypogly-
caemic events were reported in the vildagliptin group com-
pared with 35 events in 15 patients (41.7%) in the gliclazide
arm (including one severe event). In addition, the change in
glycated
haemoglobin
(HbA1c)
from
baseline
to
post-
Ramadan was significantly greater in the vildagliptin group
compared with the gliclazide group (p = 0.026) [45]. The VERDI
study compared the incidence of hypoglycaemic events dur-
ing Ramadan in patients who received vildagliptin or SU/glin-
ide and found no significant difference in the number of
patients experiencing at least one hypoglycaemic event [44].
However, the proportion of patients experiencing a severe

 hypoglycaemic event and/or an unscheduled medical visit
due to hypoglycaemia was significantly lower in the vildaglip-
tin group (p = 0.029) [44]. The VIRTUE study, conducted in the
Middle East and Asia, is the largest of the observational stud-
ies to date and enrolled >1300 patients with T2DM. Like the
smaller studies, significantly fewer patients treated with a
DPP-4 inhibitor (vildagliptin) experienced at least one hypo-
glycaemic event during Ramadan compared with those on
SUs (5.4% vs. 19.8%, p < 0.001). Patients on vildagliptin also
demonstrated significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and
body weight from baseline compared with those on SUs (both
p < 0.001) [32].
The results of the studies described above indicate that vil-
dagliptin is effective in improving glycaemic control and that
both vildagliptin and sitagliptin are associated with low rates
of hypoglycaemia during fasting, making them attractive
treatment options during Ramadan. These drugs do not
require
any
treatment
modifications
during
Ramadan
(Fig. 4). Other more recently-approved DPP-4 inhibitors (alo-
gliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin) have yet to be studied dur-
ing Ramadan.
6.1.7.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)
A number of studies on the use of GLP-1 RAs during Ramadan
have been published recently. The TREAT4 Ramadan trial
examined the safety and efficacy of liraglutide compared with
SU treatment in T2DM patients during Ramadan [47]. More
patients in the liraglutide group achieved the composite end-
point of HbA1c <7%, no weight gain and no severe hypogly-
caemia
12 weeks
post-Ramadan
compared with
the
SU
group (26.7% vs. 10.3%, respectively), but this did not reach
statistical significance. The incidence of self-reported hypo-
glycaemic events was lower in the liraglutide group [47]. In
the open-label LIRA-Ramadan study conducted in several
countries in Africa and Asia, patients with T2DM were ran-
domised to switch to liraglutide or continue on SU treatment
[48]. Significantly more patients in the liraglutide group
reached the composite endpoint (HbA1c <7.0%, no weight
gain, no hypoglycaemia) than in the SU group at the end of
Ramadan (51.3% vs. 17.7%; p < 0.0001). Patients in the liraglu-
tide arm also demonstrated better weight control and fewer
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared with the SU
group [48]. Adding liraglutide to pre-existing anti-diabetic reg-
imens (including SU and insulin) during Ramadan resulted in
16.2% of patients developing symptoms of hypoglycaemia,
but no severe events were recorded [49]. A small observational
study in patients with T2DM treated with exenatide reported
no significant differences in weight or hypoglycaemic epi-
sodes [50]. Data relating to the use of newer GLP-1 RAs (lixise-
natide, dulaglutide and albiglutide) during Ramadan are
lacking.
These studies demonstrate that liraglutide is safe as an
add-on treatment to pre-existing anti-diabetic regimens and
can be effective in reducing weight and HbA1c levels during
Ramadan. Data on exenatide is limited to one study but, like
liraglutide, the risk of hypoglycaemia during Ramadan is low.
As long as GLP-1 RAs have been appropriately dose-titrated
prior to Ramadan (6 weeks before), no further treatment mod-
ifications are required (Fig. 4).
6.1.8.
Insulin treatment for T2DM
Insulin use during prolonged fasting carries an increased risk
of hypoglycaemia, particularly for those with T1DM but also
for those with T2DM. The use of insulin analogues (basal,
prandial and premix) is recommended over regular human
insulin due to a number of advantages, including lower rates
of hypoglycaemia [51]. Although a number of small ran-
domised trials and observational studies have been con-
ducted to assess some insulin regimens during Ramadan
(Table S1), large RCT data in this area are lacking.
A multinational study reported a significant increase in
mild hypoglycaemic events during Ramadan compared with
the pre-Ramadan period in patients treated with insulin glar-
gine plus glimepiride (p < 0.001) [52]. Two smaller observa-
tional studies found insulin glargine to be safe to use during
Ramadan, with no significant increases in hypoglycaemia
when compared with non-fasting individuals or when com-
pared with those taking OADs [26,28].
A comparison of rapid-acting analogue insulin lispro and
short-acting
soluble
human
insulin,
taken
before
iftar,
revealed that the postprandial rise in blood sugar levels after
iftar and the rate of hypoglycaemia were both significantly
lower in the lispro group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.002, respectively)
[53].
A comparison of insulin lispro Mix25 (25% short-acting lis-
pro/75% intermediate-acting lispro protamine) with human
insulin 30/70 (30% short-acting soluble human insulin/70%
intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH]) dur-
ing Ramadan found that overall glycaemia was significantly
lower for patients on insulin lispro Mix25 (p = 0.004), with
the greatest between-treatment difference evident before
and after iftar [54]. Similarly, in another study insulin lispro
Mix50 (50% lispro/50% lispro protamine) in the evening and
regular human insulin with NPH (30:70) in the morning
improved glycaemic control without increasing the incidence
of hypoglycaemic events compared with regular human insu-
lin with NPH (30:70) given twice daily [55].
A new regimen in which 40% of the daily insulin dose was
given as insulin detemir at suhoor and 60% was given as
NovoMix70, a biphasic insulin aspart, before iftar has been
assessed and was found to be non-inferior to standard care
with a significantly lower hypoglycaemic event rate [56].
Another study found that compared with pre-Ramadan base-
line levels, biphasic insulin aspart reduced all glycaemic
indices following Ramadan without an increase in body
weight or risk of hypoglycaemia [57].
Insulin treatment must be appropriately individualised,
and the recommended medication adjustments and SMBG-
guided dose titrations can be found in Fig. 5.
If a patient is taking NPH or premixed insulin at suhoor, it
is important to check blood glucose at noon before up-
titration of the pre-suhoor dose. If noon blood glucose is
<110 mg/dL and pre-iftar blood glucose is not at target, long-
acting insulin analogues are preferred. It is important to note
that many patients may be on multiple therapies for diabetes
management. The adjustment of each drug is stated above.
For those on insulin and SU, a decision on the need to reduce
doses of both agents, or to start with insulin only, is required
based on individual assessment.

populations
6.2.1.
Adults with T1DM
People with T1DM who fast can develop serious health prob-
lems [18]. Indeed, religious leaders, in unification with many
diabetes experts, do not recommend fasting in individuals
with T1DM, and such patients are categorised as very high
risk. In general, patients with T1DM who have any of the fol-
lowing conditions must not fast [8,58]:
� History of recurrent hypoglycaemia.
� Hypoglycaemia unawareness.
� Poor diabetes control.
� Brittle diabetes.
� Non-compliance with medical treatment.
� Patients who are ‘unwilling’ or ‘unable’ to monitor and
manage their blood glucose levels.
Those who insist on fasting must be aware of all the
potential risks associated with fasting and must have close
medical supervision [58]. A Ramadan study using CGM found
that some patients experienced significant periods of hypo-
glycaemia while fasting, without being aware of the problem
[59]. Patients are advised to test their blood glucose levels reg-
ularly throughout the fasting period (Fig. 2). Most importantly,
glucose levels should be checked at any time when symptoms
of hypoglycaemia are recognised [23]. All patients should
comprehend the dangers of low and high blood glucose levels,
know when to break the fast, and must not fast if they are
unwell [8]. In a non-Ramadan study, patients with T1DM tak-
ing the long-acting insulin, glargine, could fast safely for 18 h
with only mild hypoglycaemic episodes reported [60]. A lim-
ited number of studies have shown that some patients with
T1DM can tolerate Ramadan fasting (Table S2 in supplemen-
tary information). Two small observational studies reported
that patients taking ultralente or insulin lispro could fast
without experiencing severe hypoglycaemic episodes [61,62].
More recent studies in patients using insulin pumps reported
no cases of severe hypoglycaemia, although some episodes of
hypoglycaemia required the fast to be broken and adjust-
ments to the basal rate were needed [63,64]. If patients with
T1DM insist on fasting, then the recommended adjustments
to insulin medication and/or dosing regimen during Ramadan
are outlined in Fig. 5.
6.2.2.
Young adults/adolescents with T1DM
Once a child reaches puberty he/she is expected to fast during
Ramadan. There have been a number of studies, albeit with a
limited number of patients, that have investigated fasting in
adolescents with T1DM. No severe hypoglycaemic episodes
have been observed, but significant periods of hypoglycaemia
during fasting hours have gone unnoticed by the patient
[59,65–68] (Table S2 in supplementary information). The gen-
eral consensus is that fasting should be avoided due to the
observation of unrecognised hypoglycaemia. However, those
patients who insist on fasting need to have good hypogly-
caemia awareness, good glycaemic control pre-Ramadan,
have the knowledge and willingness to test their blood
glucose levels, be able to adjust medication as needed and
be carefully supervised by an expert physician. As with
adults, adolescents with T1DM who fast (and their parents)
must be aware of all potential risks associated with Ramadan
fasting. Frequent SMBG, knowing when to break the fast, and
avoiding fasting on ‘sick days’ are all essential to avoid com-
plications [69]. Children and adolescents on a conventional
twice a day regimen should take their usual morning dose
before iftar and short-acting insulin at suhoor. Adolescents
on multiple daily injections should take long/intermediate-
acting insulin at iftar but reduce the dose by 30–40%, and take
a normal dose of short-acting insulin at iftar but reduce
suhoor dose by 25–50%. For those using insulin pumps, the
changes to dose are the same as those for adults (Fig. 5).
6.2.3.
Pregnant women
All pregnant women have the option not to fast if they are
worried about either their health or that of their foetus. Many
do decide to participate as they feel guilty if they do not
[70,71]. In fact, evidence from some countries indicates that
70–90% of pregnant women observe the fast [72], although
surveys suggest that they may not manage the full month
[70,73,74]. Some studies in healthy pregnant women, without
diabetes, have shown no harmful effects of fasting on baby or
mother [73,75–77], although other studies have reported some
negative outcomes [72,78,79].
Pregnant women with hyperglycaemia (gestational dia-
betes mellitus [GDM] or pre-existing diabetes) are stratified
as very high risk and are advised against fasting during preg-
nancy [8,18]. However, fasting in Ramadan is a personal deci-
sion, and a practical approach would be to explain the
potential effects on mother and foetus, thereby empowering
women
with
knowledge
and
education
regarding
self-
management skills for good pregnancy outcomes. Women
with GDM who are well-controlled pre-Ramadan on diet or
metformin are at low risk of hypoglycaemia, however they
must ensure that they are achieving post-prandial glucose
targets, which is a difficult task after a prolonged fast.
Patients on SU therapy and/or insulin should be strongly
advised against fasting due to the higher risk of hypogly-
caemia. Modifications to diet and insulin regimens such as
those outlined for patients with T1DM will be required in con-
junction with frequent SMBG, focused education and strict
medical supervision by an expert team [8].

Conclusions
With so many Muslims with diabetes choosing to fast during
Ramadan, potentially in some, against medical advice, there
is an immediate need for practical management guidelines
that enable HCPs to offer the most up-to-date information,
advise patients if fasting should not be undertaken, and sup-
port those that do fast. A pre-Ramadan assessment is vital for
any patient with diabetes who intends to fast in order to eval-
uate the risks, educate the patient in self-management of the
condition during Ramadan and to produce a patient-specific
treatment
plan
describing
any
medication
adjustments
needed. Ramadan-focused education and a better knowledge
of nutrition during Ramadan are essential elements for safer

 fasting during Ramadan. The IDF-DAR Practical Guidelines pro-
pose three categories of risk, with patients stratified to the
very high or high risk groups being advised not to fast. With
the correct advice and support from HCPs, many people with
T2DM may be able to fast safely during Ramadan. Patients
taking metformin, SUs or insulin will need to make adjust-
ments to dose and/or timings to reduce the risk of complica-
tions. Newer anti-glycaemic medications, including incretin-
based therapies, are associated with a lower risk of hypogly-
caemia and may be preferable for use during Ramadan.
Patients classified as very high or high risk, including those
with T1DM and pregnant women with diabetes, need close
medical supervision if they insist on Ramadan fasting.
The implementation of these guidelines will require the
involvement of religious leaders in community alongside
HCPs, to ensure that patients receive advice combining reli-
gious and medical directives. The IDF-DAR Practical Guidelines
have been approved by the Mofty of Egypt but religious opin-
ions in other countries may differ, therefore further regional
discussions are warranted.
