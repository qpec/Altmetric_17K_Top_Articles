Abstract
Background: Health guidelines are developed to improve patient care by
ensuring the most recent and ‘best available evidence’ is used to guide
treatment recommendations. The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence’s (NICE’s ) guideline development methodology acknowledges
that evidence needed to answer one question (treatment efficacy) may be
different from evidence needed to answer another (cost-effectiveness,
treatment acceptability to patients). This review uses counselling in the
treatment of depression as a case study, and interrogates the constructs of
‘best’ evidence and ‘best’ guideline methodologies. Method: The review
comprises six sections: (i) implications of diverse definitions of counselling
in research; (ii) research findings from meta-analyses and randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs);
(iii)
limitations
to
trials-based
evidence;
(iv) findings from large routine outcome datasets; (v) the inclusion
of
qualitative
research
that
emphasises
service-user
voices;
and
(vi) conclusions and recommendations. Results: Research from meta-
analyses and RCTs contained in the draft 2018 NICE Guideline is limited
but positive in relation to the effectiveness of counselling in the treatment
for depression. The weight of evidence suggests little, if any, advantage to
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) over counselling once risk of bias and
researcher allegiance are taken into account. A growing body of evidence
from large NHS data sets also evidences that, for depression, counselling is
as
effective
as
CBT
and
cost-effective
when
delivered
in
NHS
settings. Conclusion: Specifications
in
NICE’s
updated
guideline
procedures allow for data other than RCTs and meta-analyses to be
included. Accordingly, there is a need to include large standardised
collected data sets from routine practice as well as the voice of patients via
high-quality qualitative research.
Introduction
English health guidelines are created and regularly
updated with the aim of improving patient care by
ensuring that the most recent and ‘best available
evidence’
is
used
to
guide
treatment
(National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidance,
2017a). As stated on its website: ‘National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines are
evidence-based recommendations for health and care

 in England’ (NICE Guidelines, 2017b). Although
some NICE guidance is also adopted by Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, a separate UK-based
body equivalent to NICE exists; namely the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2017). Mental
health treatment guidelines are also developed by
other international organisations, such as the World
Health Organization (2017) and professional/scientific
bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association
(2017),
and
by
European
and
other
countries
(Vlayen, Aertgeerts, Hannes, Sermeus & Ramaeker,
2005).
This article focuses on: (i) NICE guidelines because
of the organisation’s impact in shaping mental health
care,
not
only
in
the
UK
but
internationally
(Hernandez-Villafuerte,
Garau
&
Devlin,
2014);
(ii) depression, as NICE is currently updating their
depression
guideline
(NICE,
2017d),
and;
(iii) counselling as the intervention, as different
guidelines
have
drawn
different
conclusions
(Moriana, G�
alvez-Lara & Corpas, 2017). Specially, we
focus on the selection and use of evidence. In terms
of overall methodology, in their procedural manual
NICE state: ‘Guidance is based on the best available
evidence of what works, and what it costs’ (NICE,
2014/2017, p. 14). Although the procedural manual
states that randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are
often the most appropriate design, it also states:
‘However, other study designs (including observational,
experimental or qualitative) may also be used to assess
effectiveness, or aspects of effectiveness’ (NICE, 2014/
2017, p. 15). Accordingly, we assess the extent to
which NICE has adhered to its own methods manual in
drawing
up
the
draft
guideline.
While
NICE’s
depression guideline is used as the example, arguments
in this article are intended to have broad relevance for
any organisation developing guidelines across mental
health treatments.
The new revision of the NICE Guideline for Depression
in Adults: Recognition and Management is scheduled to
be published in January 2018 and available as a
consultation document at the time of writing (NICE,
2017d). The previous 2009 NICE Guideline stated:
‘For
people
with
depression
who
decline
an
antidepressant, CBT [cognitive behaviour therapy],
IPT
[interpersonal
psychotherapy],
behavioural
activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider:
counselling for people with persistent subthreshold
depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression’
(NICE, 2009, p. 23). Counselling was included in the
2009 Guidelines but only for those who declined
other recommended treatments; the guidelines were
accordingly critiqued on the basis of limiting patient
choice
(British
Association
for
Counselling
and
Psychotherapy,
2009).
In
addition,
practitioners
offering counselling to adults with depression were
recommended
to:
‘Discuss
with
the
person
the
uncertainty of the effectiveness of counselling and
psychodynamic psychotherapy in treating depression’
(p.
24).
This
recommendation
was
criticised
as
research suggests that both patient hope and a good
therapeutic relationship are important in creating
good
patient
outcomes
(Barber,
Connoll,
Crits-
Christoph, Gladis & Siqueland, 2000). Accordingly,
this recommendation would likely have negatively
impacted on early engagement in counselling as well
as on outcomes for counselling, if practitioners had
implemented this guidance.
The consultation document for the 2018 proposed
guideline states: ‘Consider counselling if a person
with less severe depression would like help for
significant psychosocial, relationship or employment
problems
and
has
had
group
CBT,
exercise
or
facilitated
self-help,
antidepressant
medication,
individual CBT or BA for a previous episode of
depression, but this did not work well for them, or
does not want group CBT, exercise or facilitated self-
help, antidepressant medication, individual CBT or
BA’ (NICE, 2017d; Recommendation 64, p. 252). It
also recommends that the counselling ‘is based on a
model developed specifically for depression, consists
of up to 16 individual sessions each lasting up to an
hour, and takes place over 12–16 weeks, including
follow-up’ (NICE, 2017d; Recommendation 65, p.
252). Importantly, the ‘uncertainty’ directive has
been removed. Hence, the proposed guideline is
arguably an improvement on before, as it moves
towards a principle of matching counselling with
specific issues (i.e., psychosocial, relationship and
employment) together with a crucial note about the
specificity of the counselling model to be adopted.
Historically, the NICE Guideline for Depression has
been
highly
influential
in
shaping
healthcare
provision
for
those
experiencing
depression.
As
described by Clark (2011), the NICE recommendations
for depression from 2004 onwards contributed to the
development and roll-out of the Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, which in
England now provides the bulk of treatment for
depression in primary care (Gyani, Pumphrey, Parker,
Shafran & Rose, 2012). One example of the impact of
the revised 2009 Guideline appears to have been the
cutting of counselling jobs in the NHS, with IAPT
workforce census data suggesting a 35% decline in
the number of qualified counsellors working as high-
intensity therapists between 2012 and 2015, in a

 period where the total IAPT workforce grew by
almost 18% (IAPT Programme, 2013; NHS England
& Health Education England, 2016). Workforce shifts
that apparently follow revised NICE guidelines (e.g.,
counselling not being recommended as a first-line
treatment for depression) underline the importance
of scrutinising guideline recommendations since a
core assumption is that using ‘best’ evidence and
guideline
methodologies
will
lead
to
NICE
recommendations
that
improve
patient
care.
An
implicit question in the remainder of this article is
whether the positioning of counselling as a second-
tier
treatment
for
mild-to-moderate
depression
(only) through NICE recommendations is likely to
lead
to
improved
outcomes
for
clients
with
depression.
Defining counselling as a psychological
intervention
The NICE depression guidelines (2009, 2017d) have
included recommendations for ‘counselling’, but the
definition of ‘counselling’ is unclear. The British
Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)
adopts a generic definition for both counselling and
psychotherapy as umbrella terms for ‘a range of talking
therapies’
(BACP,
2017).
Equivalent
professional
organisations,
such
as
the
American
Counseling
Association (ACA) and the European Association for
Counselling (EAC) define counselling in terms of a
professional relationship that seeks to aid patients
(ACA, 2017; EAC, 2017). What these definitions have
in common is that they are nonspecific: counselling is a
broad family of interventions that includes subtypes of
counselling such as person-centred therapy (PCT) or
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). However – and
problematically
–
the
2009
NICE
Guideline
for
Depression
directly
compared
‘counselling’
with
subtypes of counselling.
The 2009 NICE Guideline for Depression did not
specify a definition of counselling; however, various
definitions
for
counselling
are
provided
in
the
empirical literature. For example, King, Marston and
Bower (2014) reported on a reanalysis of the Health
Technology Assessment-funded trial (Ward et al.,
2000), comprising a head-to-head RCT comparing
‘nondirective counselling’ and cognitive behaviour
therapy (CBT), and defined the counselling used in
their
study
as
‘a
nondirective,
inter-personal
approach’ (p. 1836) derived from the work of Carl
Rogers. In this context, the therapy ‘counselling’ has
clear theoretical and empirical roots and is a synonym
for a type of talking therapy.
In contrast, a 2012 meta-analytic study by Cuijpers
et al.
examined
the
efficacy
of
‘nondirective
supportive therapy’ (NDST) – which they stated is
‘commonly described in the literature as counselling’
(p.
281).
They
defined
NDST
as
an
approach
that
utilises
the
shared
attributes
(or
common
factors) of all talking therapies ‘without (utilizing)
specific psychological techniques. . .’ (p. 281), which
characterise particular types of therapy. Cuijpers et al.
(2012) point out that many RCTs that include
counselling do so as a nonspecific control group and
suggest researchers appear to treat counselling as not
being a bona fide active treatment. In this context
‘counselling’ is neither a category nor an example of a
category,
but
a
shared
nonspecific
attribute
of
psychological therapies in general.
The
outcome
of
the
2009
NICE
guidance
recommendations spurred the development of a model
of counselling for the treatment of depression designed
to be effective as a high-intensity intervention within
IAPT
that
took
the
form
of
a
person-centred
experiential
therapy
named
Counselling
for
Depression (CfD; Sanders & Hill, 2014). The aim was to
develop a bona fide psychological therapy using an
established methodology that involved defining a
range of basic, generic, specific and meta-competencies
for this model of therapy (Roth, Hill & Pilling, 2009).
The CfD (person-centred experiential) model, which is
now available to IAPT patients (NHS England, 2017),
also meets the recommendations in the 2018 draft
guidelines for a model of counselling developed for
depression.
The
reviewed
definitions
suggest
there
are
potentially
two
distinct
forms
of
counselling:
a
nonspecific counselling that utilises generic and basic
competences common to all forms of therapy, and a
model-specific form of counselling, such as person-
centred experiential counselling, which includes CfD.
This distinction between generic counselling and a
bona
fide/active
intervention
potentially
implies
critical
differences
in
the
level
of
training
and
competencies of a practitioner (comparable to the
differences between low and high-intensity treatment
in IAPT) and in the specificity of the model of
intervention used. The 2018 proposed guideline does
not utilise such distinctions, however, the only
recommendation in the draft guidelines is that the
counselling intervention should be one developed
specifically for depression (yet CfD is not named). This
suggests that guideline developers need to make a
concerted effort to use definitions that specify the
theoretical approach and potentially the level of
professional training or competencies.

Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
 The current evidence for the clinical efficacy and
effectiveness of counselling in the treatment of
depression
NICE guidelines for depression draw on two main
classes of data to arrive at clinical recommendations,
namely
meta-analyses
and
RCTs.
NICE’s
methodological procedures state: ‘NICE prefers data
from head-to-head RCTs to compare the effectiveness
of interventions’ (NICE, 2014/2017, p. 103). Further,
the procedures require the detailing of the methods
and results of individual trials. If direct evidence from
treatment comparisons is not available, then indirect
comparisons can be made using network meta-
analysis (see Mills, Thorlund & Ioannidis, 2013). This
procedure,
which
combines
direct
and
indirect
treatment
comparisons,
focuses
on
classes
of
interventions (i.e., broader headings of approaches
rather than specific therapy brands) to arrive at
recommendations
when
comparing
multiple
interventions. The interventions are judged against an
appropriate comparator, that is, a common standard.
The draft 2018 Guideline uses a pill placebo condition
as the appropriate comparator. The Guideline also
considers the cost-effectiveness of interventions. In
this section, we provide an overview of the current
status of evidence regarding counselling as derived
from meta-analyses and RCTs.
Meta-analyses of counselling in the treatment of
depression
In terms of meta-analyses, the aim is to combine data
from multiple studies and to statistically synthesise
the results to create conclusions that are more robust.
There are three meta-analyses of direct relevance.
First, Cape, Whittington, Buszewicz, Wallace and
Underwood (2010) carried out a meta-analysis and
meta-regression
of
34
studies
focusing
on
brief
psychological interventions for anxiety and depression,
involving 3962 patients. Most interventions were brief
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT; n = 13), counselling
(n = 8) or problem solving therapy (PST; n = 12).
Results showed effectiveness for all three types of
therapy: studies of CBT for depression (d: �.33, 95%
CI: �.60 to �.06) and studies of CBT for mixed anxiety
and depression (d: �.26, 95% CI: �.44 to �.08);
counselling in the treatment of depression alone as well
as mixed anxiety and depression (d: �.32, 95% CI:
�.52 to �.11); and PST for depression and mixed
anxiety and depression (d: �.21, 95% CI: �.37 to
�.05). Controlling for diagnosis, meta-regression found
no difference between CBT, counselling and PST. The
authors concluded that brief CBT, counselling and PST
are all effective treatments in primary care, but that
effect
sizes
are
low
compared
to
longer
length
treatments. Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that
for the analysis of the four studies of counselling for the
treatment of depression only, the results were not
statistically significant. However, four studies are not
sufficient to yield reliable results.
Second, Cuijpers et al. (2012) found that studies in
which NDST was compared with CBT resulted in a
small and nonsignificant difference between NDST
and CBT. The authors commented that NDST has
been treated as a proxy for counselling, although it
specifically excludes active elements that may be
present
in
bona
fide
counselling
interventions.
However, they found that the studies with researcher
allegiance in favour of the alternative psychotherapy
resulted in a considerably larger effect size than
studies without researcher allegiance. Moreover, in
studies without an indication of researcher allegiance,
the difference between NDST and other therapies was
virtually zero. The authors argued that such results
suggested that NDST is effective and deserved more
respect from the research community.
Third, the most recent relevant study by Barth et al.
(2013) adopted a network meta-analysis – the same
method used by the NICE Guideline Development
Group – using 198 trials comparing seven forms of
psychotherapeutic interventions, one of which was
‘supportive counselling’. The analysis found significant
effects for supportive counselling compared against
waitlist and that the evidence base for supportive
counselling was broad. However, when that analysis
focused only on the network of large trials, for four of
the interventions, including supportive counselling,
significant effects were no longer found. Barth et al.
(2013) themselves invoked the results of the Cuijpers
et al. (2012) meta-analysis that found no difference
between NDST and other treatments. They stated it was
‘unjustified’ to dismiss supportive counselling as a
suboptimal treatment because, although the evidence
for this intervention was less strong, the size of the
differences between the interventions studied was
small. They concluded that different psychotherapeutic
interventions
for
depression
have
comparable,
moderate-to-large effects.
In summary, when studies with a low researcher
allegiance against counselling together with evidence
from
bona
fide
counselling
interventions
are
considered,
the
meta-analytic
studies
comparing
counselling with CBT for depression suggest either
broad equivalence of patient outcomes or, where
differences do exist, that they are small.

M. Barkham et al.
 RCTs of counselling in the treatment of depression
As
a tradition,
counselling
in
the UK
is
often
associated with Humanistic/Experiential therapies,
and there are a few RCTs which report evidence for
the
efficacy
for
these
therapies
with
depressed
patients
(Goldman,
Greenberg
&
Angus,
2006),
including one that compared process-experiential
therapy (now referred to as emotion-focused therapy)
with CBT and found comparable outcomes (Watson,
Gordon, Stermac, Kalogerakos & Steckley, 2003).
However, only one recent report directly compared
counselling (defined as nondirective person-centred
counselling) to CBT in the treatment of depression.
The original study reported comparisons between
nondirective counselling and CBT for mixed anxiety
and depression and found no significant difference in
outcomes for the two therapies (Ward et al., 2000). A
subsequent reanalysis of the subsample of patients
meeting a diagnosis of depression only, found similar
results with both therapies being equally effective and
both being superior to usual General Practice care at
4 months but not at 12 months (King et al., 2014).
The findings from this study are important because
of the lack of RCT research that might provide direct
head-to-head
trial
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
counselling. The 2009 NICE Guideline for Depression
development process identified six relevant studies for
consideration. One was excluded due to the mixed
diagnosis (Ward et al., 2000) although, as stated, a
subanalysis focusing on patients reporting depression
only was considered (and subsequently published as
King et al., 2014). Data from five other trials were
also used (Bedi et al., 2000; Goldman et al., 2006;
Greenberg
&
Watson,
1998;
Simpson,
Corney,
Fitzgerald & Beecham, 2000; Watson et al., 2003).
However, they were all either low powered in terms
of patient numbers, had patient samples drawn from
the mild-to-moderate range of depression only with
some including subthreshold patients, or compared
outcomes
for
similar
(Humanistic/Experiential)
therapies. The 2009 guideline recommendation was
that counselling should not be considered as a first-
line intervention, as it had more limited evidence,
and
should
only
be
considered
for
patients
experiencing
subthreshold,
mild
or
moderate
depression
who
declined
the
other
treatments
available. As stated, the guideline also added the
qualification about the uncertainty of the evidence
for counselling, and suggested patients should be
advised on this matter.
In summary, while there is minimal recent RCT
evidence
comparing
counselling
as
a
bona
fide
intervention with CBT, the evidence that does exist
supports the general efficacy of counselling. However,
apart from the Ward/King reports, RCT studies are
generally small-scale and lack a standard comparator
such as CBT. The lack of new data may explain why
the recommendations for counselling in the 2009
published and 2018 draft guidelines are broadly
similar. However, unlike the 2009 Guideline, the
draft 2018 Guideline is based on network meta-
analyses.
As
some
commentators
have
noted:
‘Nonetheless,
a
network
meta-analysis
is
not
a
substitute for a well conducted randomized controlled
trial’
(Kanters
et al.,
2016,
p.
783).
More
immediately, perhaps, there needs to be a debate as to
the appropriateness of using pill placebo as the
appropriate
comparator
in
relation
to
decision-
making. To use a nonclinically viable intervention as
the appropriate comparator – something a patient
experiencing depression would never be offered –
does not appear to be the most useful benchmark for
informing
decision-making
regarding
differing
interventions (see Dias, 2013).
Yet,
beyond
meta-analyses
and
RCTs,
other
potentially valuable sources of evidence exist that are
defined by NICE as within the scope of evidence that
could be considered but, unfortunately, have not
been in the 2018 draft recommendations. In the next
section, we argue that there has been an overreliance
on the RCT design, before then presenting a case for
including relevant non-RCT data.
The limitations of currently considered evidence in
guideline development
An overreliance on RCTs
Within the counselling and psychotherapy outcomes
literature, there has been a long-standing debate
regarding what counts as evidence (Kazdin, 2008).
Evidence from RCTs has traditionally been favoured
due to specific features that control for systematic
biases, leading them to be judged as providing the
most
stringent
form
of
evidence.
In
short,
randomisation protects against any systematic biases
in the assignment of patients to treatments. The
component of randomisation is probably the hallmark
most often cited as underpinning the superiority of
trials data in the field of the psychological therapies.
However, the other central element of RCTs –
participants being double-blinded – can only be
utilised in drug trials where the content of the drug
can be hidden to patients and to the professional
providing the medication. Hence, while trial designs

Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy

M. Barkham et al.
Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
 in the psychological therapies are not the strongest
form that the RCT design allows, it has long been held
as the design that yields the most reliable and valid
findings (Wessley, 2007).
While
the strengths
of
RCT designs
are
well
accepted,
no
research
method
is
immune
from
criticism and one of the abiding criticisms of RCTs
concerns their lack of generalisability (Kennedy-
Martin, Curtis, Faries, Robinson & Johnston, 2015).
While statistical work is taking place to develop
procedures in an attempt to address this issue (Stuart,
Bradshaw & Leaf, 2015), by design, RCTs involve the
careful screening of patients to ensure that all trial
participants fully meet diagnostic criteria for the
presenting condition under study. Typically, this
involves screening out patients presenting with any
comorbidities, something that leads to the criticism
that RCT participants are atypical of patients in actual
practice, since, for example, depression is highly
comorbid with anxiety (Kaufman & Charney, 2000).
In addition, by their very nature RCTs draw on a
specific subgroup
of
the population of
patients,
namely those who are willing to be trial participants.
A major reason patients decline to be participants in
trials is that they do not wish to be research
subjects (Barnes et al., 2013). In addition, there has
been
a
long-term
concern
about
the
lack
or
underrepresentation of minorities in research studies
(Hussain-Gambles, Atkin & Leese, 2004; Stronks,
Wieringa & Hardon, 2013). Hence, while a well-
conducted RCT will state that the intention to offer
treatment X (from an intent-to-treat analysis) or
receipt of treatment X (from a per-protocol analysis) is
better than treatment Y in a specific setting, it will not
address the question a commissioner asks, namely:
will it work for us? (Cartwright & Munro, 2010).
Jadad
and
Enkin
(2007),
the
authors
of
the
standard
guide
to
designing
RCTs,
state:
‘. . .
randomized trials are not divine revelations, they are
human constructs, and like all human constructs, are
fallible. They are valuable, useful tools that should be
used wisely and well’ (p. 44). Indeed, Jadad and
Enkin list over 50 specific biases that are possible
when carrying out a trial and go on to provide a
strong warning that unless their weaknesses are
acknowledged, there is a ‘risk of fundamentalism and
intolerance of criticism, or alternative views (that)
can discourage innovation’ (p. 45).
Despite such criticisms, trials have become the
dominant source for informing clinical guidelines.
Yet, as the previous Chairman of NICE, Sir Mike
Rawlins, stated: ‘Awarding such prominence to the
results of RCTs, however, is unreasonable’ (2008, p.
2159). Rawlins further argued in relation to the
hierarchy of evidence used by NICE that privileges
trials data, that ‘Hierarchies of evidence should be
replaced by accepting a diversity of approaches.’ (p.
2159). And indeed, the word hierarchy does not
appear at all in the NICE methods manual (NICE,
2014/2017). Rawlins’ argument was not to abandon
RCTs in favour of observational studies; rather what
he sought was for researchers to improve their
methods and for decision makers to avoid adopting
entrenched positions about the nature of evidence.
However, given the dominance of RCT evidence and
the absence of relevant and available observational
data in the draft 2018 guidelines, it would appear that
Rawlins’ call has not been heeded.
Considering statistical power and nonindependence of
patients in RCTs
A separate but major issue concerning trials, as
identified earlier, is the extent to which they are
appropriately powered to detect any hypothesised
differences. To have confidence in the findings from
RCTs that test the superiority, noninferiority or
equivalence
of
one
treatment
condition
against
another, studies must have the required statistical
power (sufficient numbers of patients in the trial) to
detect such a difference if one exists. The standard
criterion that defines sufficient power for a superiority
trial requires that a study will have at least an 80%
chance of detecting a difference at p < .05 if one
exists.
Cuijpers (2016)
reviewed the statistical power
needed both for individual RCTs and for meta-
analytic studies focused on adult depression. His
analysis should be considered alongside the three
classes of between-group effect sizes traditionally
postulated by Cohen (1992): small (d = .2), medium
(d = .5), and large (d = .8). He identified that a
sample size of 90 trial patients (i.e., 45 patients per
arm) was required to find a differential effect size of
d = .6 (i.e., a medium effect size). Having established
in an earlier article that an effect size of d = .24 could
be considered as a ‘minimally important difference’
from the patient’s perspective (Cuijpers, Turner,
Koole, van Dijke & Smit, 2014), he calculated that for
a trial to determine such a minimally important
difference
between
two
active
treatments
for
depression would require 548 patients – that is, 274
patients in each arm of the trial.
Yet in Cuijpers’ (2016) analysis, the mean number
of patients included in RCT comparisons between CBT
and another psychotherapy for depression was 52,

 with a range from 13 to 178. The effect size that can
be detected with the average trial comprising 52
patients was d = .79, an effect size similar to that
comparing CBT with untreated control groups (i.e.,
d = .71). For nondirective counselling, the analysis
found that the largest study had sufficient power to
detect a differential effect size of d = .34. The largest
comparative
trial
found
in
three
comprehensive
meta-analyses
of
major
types
of
psychotherapy
comprised 221 patients. This is about 40% of the 548
patients needed to detect a clinically relevant effect
size of d = .24. Taking these statistics together, it is
uncertain whether there can be sufficient confidence
in the results of RCTs for adult depression conducted
to date that compare CBT with another therapy
because they likely lack sufficient statistical power
(Cuijpers, 2016).
Meta-analyses are, like single RCTs, subject to
considerations of power. For meta-analyses of RCTs
focused on treatment of depression, Cuijpers (2016)
suggests that for CBT (based on a mean of 52 patients
per study), 18 trials would be needed to detect a
significant effect of d = .24 with a power of .8, or 24
trials with a power of .9. According to his analysis, the
actual number of trials was 46, which was sufficient
to detect a clinically relevant effect. However, he
concluded that only 13 of these trials had a low risk of
bias. This is important, as ‘bias’ is an agreed index of
factors that reduce confidence in the results of RCTs.
For example, a potential source of bias is the degree to
which assessors or data analysts have prior knowledge
of the specific intervention any individual study
participant received. Hence, meta-analyses are also
vulnerable to low power once only studies with a low
risk of bias are considered.
For nondirective supportive counselling (based on a
slightly higher mean of 59 patients per trial), 16 trials
would be needed to detect an effect of d = .24 with a
power of .8 or 21 trials with a power of .9. The 32
trials comparing counselling with other therapies
therefore had sufficient power to detect a clinically
relevant effect. However, only 14 trials had low risk of
bias, yielding the same conclusion that there were not
enough trials to detect such an effect.
In addition to issues of bias and low power, the
statistical analysis applied to the data assumes that the
data – that is, patients – are independent of each other.
However, patients are not independent of each other as
they are nested within therapists. Patient outcomes for
one therapist will be correlated with the other patients
from the same therapist and differ from the outcomes
with other therapists. It is likely that there will be
variability between the outcomes of therapists, a
phenomenon known as therapist effects (Barkham,
Lutz, Lambert & Saxon, 2017). Failure to take account
of therapist effects results in this effect being attributed
to the treatment effect and, thereby, inflating it (or
deflating it if the therapists are not effective).
In summary, despite numerous comparative trials
being conducted, from this data it is unclear whether
one therapy for adult depression is more effective
than another to an extent that is clinically relevant. Trials
are
underpowered
and
require
much
greater
statistical power and less bias to determine differential
effectiveness. In the light of this position, we now
consider arguments for including very large data sets
from routine practice.
Incorporating very large routine practice-based
data sets in guideline development for depression
As stated earlier, the NICE methods manual states
that while RCTs may often be the most appropriate
design, ‘other study designs (including observational,
experimental or qualitative) may also be used to
assess effectiveness, or aspects of effectiveness’ (NICE,
2014/2017, p. 15). And in terms of the development
work in network meta-analysis, the aim is to move
towards ‘the inclusion of studies of various designs,
including observational studies, within one analysis’
(Kanters et al., 2016, p. 783). Accordingly, there
appears to be little reason, if any, for NICE not to
consider high-quality and relevant observational data.
One key development over the past decade or more
has been the growth in the availability of very large
data sets. For the psychological therapies, this is best
exemplified by the implementation of the IAPT
programme in England (London School of Economics
and Political Science, 2006). The IAPT programme
comprises a stepped care approach in which patients
are initially referred for low-intensity interventions
such as psychoeducational interventions delivered by
psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs). If not
successful, these are ‘stepped up’ to high-intensity
interventions comprising CBT and several non-CBT
therapies, including CfD (person-centred experiential
therapy),
a
standardised
model
of
intervention
focused on depression with standards of training and
supervision. Some patients, based on their presenting
issues,
are
assigned
directly
to
high-intensity
interventions.
The
IAPT
programme,
which
was
piloted in 2006 and independently evaluated (Parry
et al., 2011), has been rolled out nationally and has
focused largely on patients experiencing depression
and anxiety but is being expanded to other patient
groups.

M. Barkham et al.
Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
 A key feature of the IAPT programme is the
administration of a common set of outcome measures
– a minimum data set (MDS) – at each attended
session. The MDS comprises the following: the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9: Kroenke, Spitzer &
Williams, 2001), which acts as a proxy measure for
depression; the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7;
Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams & L€
owe, 2006); and the
Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt,
Marks,
Shear
&
Greist,
2002).
The
per-session
administration of the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and WSAS in
IAPT has yielded potential standardised data sets from
routine practice of unprecedented size. In 2015–2016
(the last year for which there is currently data),
almost a million people entered IAPT treatment, with
over half a million completing a course of treatment
(NHS Digital, 2016).
The numbers of IAPT patients for whom systematic
data has been collected potentially makes this one of
the largest standardised data sets on the psychological
therapies in the world. Kazdin (2008), on observing
the general waste from data in practice settings not
being used stated: ‘we are letting knowledge from
practice drip through the holes of a colander’ (p. 155).
Indeed, the collection and use of such large-scale
routinely collected standardised data are a hallmark of
the
research
paradigm
termed
practice-based
evidence (Barkham & Margison, 2007; Barkham,
Stiles, Lambert & Mellor-Clark, 2010). While the
privileging of trials data ahead of observational data
may have been appropriate when the latter comprised
small-scale and unsystematic studies, this is no longer
the case. In the same way that narrative reviews have
developed a clear and systematic methodological
underpinning
to
yield
systematic
reviews,
the
methods of collection and analyses of ‘routine data’
have developed a level of sophistication that can
arguably no longer be dismissed (or labelled) as
simply observational data.
Consistent with this practice-based paradigm, the
proposed 2018 Guideline states: ‘For all interventions
for people with depression: use sessional outcome
measures; review how well the treatment is working
with the person; and monitor and evaluate treatment
adherence’ (NICE, 2017d; Recommendation 37, p.
248). In addition, healthcare professionals delivering
interventions for people with depression should:
‘receive regular high-quality supervision; and have
their
competence
monitored
and
evaluated,
for
example,
by
using
video
and
audio
tapes,
and
external audit’ (NICE, 2017d; Recommendation 38, p.
248).
These
recommendations
provide
the
underpinning not only for enhancing the quality of
clinical practice but also of ensuring the collection of
high-quality standardized data that would complement
trials-based data. However, despite the potential size
of the IAPT data set and its quality, the data are not
currently considered in NICE guideline developments.
Given
that
the
IAPT
initiative
was
shaped
by
iterations of the NICE Guidelines for depression, the
IAPT data itself may contribute to a better linkage
between practice in routine settings, the yield from
RCTs, and guideline development. It also enables
practitioners in routine practice to contribute directly
via their standardised data to informing the very
guidelines that they will have to implement.
The IAPT data set: effectiveness of counselling in the
treatment of depression in the NHS
The
potential
value
of
the
IAPT
data
set
in
contributing
to
the
evidence
base
on
effective
treatment for depression in adults is illustrated by
examining reports and studies derived from IAPT
data. Since 2013–14, IAPT have published annual
reports comparing the number of referrals, average
number of sessions and recovery rates between the
available psychological therapies (NHS Digital, 2014,
2015, 2016). As demonstrated in Table I, whilst a
greater proportion of referrals (approximately 60–
65%) received CBT as compared with counselling,
patient outcomes (i.e., recovery rates) have been
virtually equivalent between the two interventions.
Research studies carried out by different academic
groups that have accessed different portions of the
IAPT data set to undertake more detailed analyses
have also reported comparable outcomes between
CBT and counselling in relation to the treatment of
depression (Gyani, Shafran, Layard & Clark, 2013;
Pybis, Saxon, Hill & Barkham, 2017). In more
sophisticated studies using multilevel modelling to

 account for patient case mix and the nested nature of
data, where differences have been observed these
have been small and clinically insignificant (Pybis
et al., 2017; Saxon, Firth & Barkham, 2017). These
data
demonstrate
that
for
patients
accessing
psychological
therapy
throughout
the
NHS,
counselling is, to all intents and purposes, as effective
as CBT in the treatment of depression for both
moderate and severe levels of depression. These
studies, as well as the publicly available evidence from
NHS Digital, confirm the findings of earlier studies
using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation
measure
(CORE-OM;
Evans
et al.,
2002).
These
studies used routinely collected CORE-OM data from
naturalistic settings before the implementation of
IAPT
and
yielded
comparable
patient
outcomes
between
counselling
and
CBT
(Stiles,
Barkham,
Mellor-Clark
&
Connell,
2008;
Stiles,
Barkham,
Twigg, Mellor-Clark & Cooper, 2006).
In summary, the evidence from the IAPT data set is
that
counselling
is
as
effective
as
CBT
as
an
intervention
for
depression.
This
evidence
of
effectiveness in NHS practice settings across England
accords with the conclusions of Cuijpers (2017), who
reviewed
over
500
depression
RCTs
from
four
decades of research, and concluded that there were
no
significant
differences
between
the
main
interventions,
once
biases
and
allegiances
were
considered. The consistency of the trials-based and
practice-based findings is important in supporting the
value of counselling as an intervention for depression
offered in the NHS in England. However, we argue
that the key conclusion for guideline development
from these findings is that focus of research attention
should
not
be
on
repeatedly
re-evaluating
the
evidence for different interventions. Instead the focus
should move to other factors such as therapist effects
or site effects where there appear to be noticeable
differences in patients’ outcomes (e.g., Saxon &
Barkham,
2012).
This
refocusing
away
from
treatment differences and towards other factors is a
position endorsed by the American Psychological
Association (2012).
The IAPT data set: efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
counselling in the treatment of depression
A 2010 report calculated the annual cost of depression
in England to be almost £11 billion in lost earnings,
demands on the health service and the cost of
prescribing drugs to address the depression (Cost of
Depression in England, 2010). In this context, the
cost-effectiveness
of
treatment
is
important
to
consider.
Determining
cost-effectiveness
with
acceptable degrees of certainty requires large samples,
which the IAPT data set offers in a way that trials do
not. Given the NICE procedural manual states that,
for example, observational data can be used for
‘aspects of effectiveness’, the potential contribution of
the
IAPT
data
set
to
considerations
of
cost-
effectiveness is significant.
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies data
suggest patients accessing counselling attend fewer
sessions on average than those accessing CBT (NHS
Digital, 2014, 2015, 2016; Pybis et al., 2017; Saxon,
Firth et al., 2017). This suggests counselling may well
be cheaper and therefore more cost-efficient than
CBT as it achieves comparable patient outcomes. To
consider this in more detail, a study exploring the
cost-effectiveness of IAPT as a service reported data
collected from five Primary Care Trusts and found the
cost
of
a
high-intensity
session
was
£177
(Radhakrishnan et al., 2013). Using this estimate
alongside figures from the latest IAPT report that
counselling is typically seeing patients for 5.9 sessions,
whereas CBT is seeing patients for 7.1 sessions (NHS
Digital, 2016), this would suggest counselling costs
approximately
£1044
per
patient
and
CBT
approximately
£1256
per
patient.
In
2015–16,
152,452 patients completed a course of CBT at an
estimated cost of £191 million. If those same patients
had received counselling the cost saving could have
been over £30 million.
The potential saving of £30 million is calculated
only from the fewer sessions (on average) received by
counselling patients in IAPT. However, given that
counsellors in IAPT are often paid a grade lower than
‘IAPT-qualified’ therapists (Perren, 2009), this figure
may underestimate the potential saving. Moreover,
while counselling training is typically self-funded,
IAPT CBT trainings have been government funded,
initially centrally and more recently locally. This
illustrates the potential financial implications of how
research evidence is weighed up and then synthesised
into guideline recommendations for the treatment of
depression.
In summary, the vast data set derived from the
IAPT programme needs to be used to complement
data from RCTs. And this is particularly true for
questions concerning cost-effectiveness that cannot
be adequately addressed by RCTs alone. Within
years, there will be patient data on millions of
patients within IAPT services. Its inclusion in the
scope of NICE guideline reviews would be wholly
consistent
with
the
NICE
guidelines
procedure
manual.

Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
 Considering the role of service users’ voices via
qualitative research in guideline development
The
previous
section
has
argued
for
guideline
developers to consider very large patient data sets. In
this section, we argue for guideline developers to
incorporate qualitative evidence that gives voice to
service users. Doing so would be in accordance with
NHS England’s business plan for 2016/2017, which
sets out a commitment: ‘to make a genuine shift to
place patients at the centre, shaping services around
their preferences and involving them at all stages’
(NHS England, 2016, p. 49). NICE has a similar
commitment (NICE Patient and Public Involvement
Policy, 2017c). Currently, while qualitative research
is
included
in
guideline
development,
NICE
processes do not allow such data to be included
in the final summative analyses that shape key
recommendations. Yet a number of researchers (Hill,
Chui & Baumann, 2013; Midgley, Ansaldo & Target,
2014) argue that qualitative outcome studies are
important to consider because they ‘offer a significant
challenge to assumptions about outcome that derive
from mainstream quantitative research on this topic,
in relation to two questions: how the outcome is
conceptualised,
and
the
overall
effectiveness
of
therapy’ (McLeod, 2013, p. 65). Reviewing existing
literature,
McLeod
suggested
patients
themselves
conceptualise outcome much more broadly than in
terms of symptom or behavioural change (Binder,
Holgersen
&
Nielsen,
2010).
Typically,
patients
acknowledge ways in which therapy has been helpful
but
also
where
it
has
failed,
suggesting
that
quantitative
outcome
research
may
overstate
therapeutic effectiveness. Qualitative studies can also
help answer questions about patient experience and
expectations of NHS services, including whether
treatments are credible and acceptable to them, which
have an impact on outcomes.
Turning
to
qualitative
research
focused
on
depression,
there
is
a
growing
literature
on
understanding the experiences of patient populations
such as minority ethnic groups (e.g., Lawrence et al.,
2006a), women (e.g., Stoppard & McMullen, 1999),
men (e.g., Emslie, Ridge, Ziebland & Hunt, 2006) and
older adults (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2006b). Such
studies
elucidate
population-specific
depression
experiences that can be useful in understanding why
certain populations benefit less from treatment. There
is also a literature that seeks to describe the experience
of aspects of depression such as recovery (e.g., Ridge &
Ziebland,
2006)
or
types
of
depression
such
as
postnatal depression (e.g., Beck, 2002). However,
currently relatively little research focuses on patients’
experiences of depression treatment. There is some
research
on
depressed
patients’
experiences
of
computer-mediated
depression
treatment
(e.g.,
Beattie, Shaw, Kaur & Kessler, 2009; Lillevoll et al.,
2013), and mindfulness (e.g., Mason & Hargreaves,
2001;
Smith,
Graham
&
Senthinathan,
2007).
However, there is less research on the major modalities
such as CBT (e.g., Barnes et al., 2013), psychodynamic
(e.g., Valkonen, H€
anninen & Lindfors, 2011) and
process-experiential therapies (e.g., Timulak & Elliott,
2003). The lack matters because such qualitative
research focusing on treatment experiences provides a
method by which theoretical assumptions about how a
therapy ‘works’ can be evaluated against the patient
perspective.
Even
more
rare
are
comparative
qualitative
outcome studies (e.g., Nilsson, Svensson, Sandell &
Clinton, 2007). Such studies focusing on depression
are valuable because they can foster understanding of
whether patients experience outcomes differently in
different therapies. One example is Straarup and
Poulsen’s (2015) study, which compared patients’
experiences of CBT and metacognitive therapy and
found evidence of different understandings of the
causes of depression and what had changed as a result
of therapy.
In summary, qualitative research has considerable
value in terms of capturing patients’ experiences of
psychotherapy that can inform practice (see Levitt,
Pomerville & Surace, 2016). This suggests the need:
(1)
to
consider
qualitative
outcome
studies
in
guideline development and recommendations, and
(2)
encouraging
further
research
focused
on
guideline-recommended treatments and differential
patient experiences.
Towards a broader spectrum of best evidence
Whatever
the
potential
pool
of
data,
guideline
organisations
need
to
establish
and
implement
procedures for making recommendations. A recent
review
considered
how
different
national
organisations produce clinical guidelines. Moriana
et al. (2017) analysed and compiled lists of evidence-
based psychological treatments by disorder using data
provided by RCTs, meta-analyses, guidelines and
systematic reviews of NICE, Cochrane, Division 12 of
the
American
Psychological
Association
and
the
Australian Psychological Society. For depression, they
found poor agreement with no single intervention
obtaining positive consensus agreement from all four
organisations. The authors suggested one possible

Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy

Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
M. Barkham et al.
 cause for the lack of agreement might be subtle biases
in committee procedures, while evidence considered
by both NICE and Cochrane may be overinfluenced
by the key meta-analyses that both organisations
commission to support their decision-making. Whilst
one organisation might favour its own procedures in
this way, the process lacks standardisation across the
different
bodies
and
leads
to
discrepancies
in
guidance.
The finding that guideline processes have led to
different treatment recommendations for the same
condition underlines the criticisms of an approach to
synthesising evidence that rigidly prioritises RCTs. We
argue that a rigorous and relevant knowledge base of
the psychological therapies cannot be built on one
research
paradigm
or
type
of
data
alone
but
should incorporate both evidence-based practice (i.e.,
trials)
and
practice-based
evidence
(i.e.,
routine
practice data; Barkham & Margison, 2007). In this
conceptualisation, trials provide evidence from a top-
down
model
(RCT
evidence
generating
national
guidelines that are implemented in practice settings)
while practice-based evidence builds upwards using
data
from
routine
practice
settings
to
guide
interventions and inform guideline development.
Both
paradigms
are
complementary
and,
most
importantly, the results from one paradigm can be
tested out in the other. Further, a synthesis of
evidence from both paradigms ensures that the data
from trials remain directly connected and relevant to
routine practice, creating a continual cycle between
practice and research and between practitioners and
researchers.
Given
the
points
made
here,
there
is
little
justification for relying solely on trials data and
dismissing evidence from large standardised routine
datasets delivering NICE recommended and IAPT
approved psychological therapies. There are issues
and vulnerabilities with both paradigms and the
evidence they provide, but it is no longer credible to
suggest that the term best applies only to trials data. To
abide by the advice of Rawlins (2008) as well as Jadad
and Enkin (2007), views concerning nontrial data
need to become more accommodating. Overall, a
collective move to a position of considering the weight
of evidence from a wider bandwidth or spectrum
provides a more rounded and inclusive view of
available high-quality data. By applying the concept
of teleoanalysis – that is, the synthesis of different
categories
of
evidence
to
obtain
a
quantitative
summary – it is possible to arrive at more robust and
relevant conclusions (Clarke & Barkham, 2009; Wald
& Morris, 2003). This, we would suggest, is an
approach that would yield both better and more
relevant evidence. Accordingly, IAPT data now needs
to be considered alongside evidence from trials to
form a more complete and accurate picture of the
comparative effectiveness of psychological therapies.
Further,
high-quality
qualitative
data
require
inclusion in arriving at recommendations, particularly
as it is a primary source for patients’ perspectives and
experiences.
Conclusions and recommendations
We have argued for greater precision in defining the
profession and practice of counselling, provided an
overview of research on counselling for the treatment
of depression from meta-analyses and RCTs, raised
issues arising from a sole reliance on trials, and put
the case for broadening the bandwidth of high-quality
evidence using large routine standardised data sets
and the consideration of high-quality qualitative
studies.
Overall,
with
regard
to
depression,
counselling is effective. Some analyses suggest it is
somewhat less effective than other therapies for
depression (e.g., CBT), but when research findings are
adjusted for researcher allegiance and low risk of bias,
such
differences
are
minimal
and
not
clinically
relevant (Cuijpers, 2017). Results from (very) large
standardised
data
sets
in
routine
practice
show
counselling to be as effective as CBT in the treatment
of patient-reported depression and with a suggestion
that it may be more cost-efficient. However, such data
are not considered by NICE even though it is
consistent with the scope of data defined in their
guideline development procedural manual (NICE,
2014/2017).
One clear observation concerning RCTs in the field
of depression is the paucity of high-quality head-to-
head trials relating to counselling. In addition, there
are calls from advocates of RCTs for trials to be larger
and pragmatic (Wessley, 2007). In response to such
calls, there is a large pragmatic noninferiority RCT
comparing CfD (Person-centred experiential therapy)
with CBT as the benchmark treatment that will yield
initial results late in 2018 (Saxon, Ashley et al., 2017).
Particularly significant is the trial’s focus on patients
diagnosed
as
experiencing
moderate
or
severe
depression.
The
results
regarding
any
differential
effectiveness of counselling between moderate and
severe depression will address a key issue as to
whether CfD could be considered as a front-line
intervention. Funders should call for other therapeutic
approaches to be evaluated using CBT as a benchmark
– to determine whether another therapy is, in any

Counselling, depression, & NICE guidance
 clinically meaningful way, noninferior to CBT. In this
way, a robust and relevant knowledge base will be
constructed that aims to ensure quality and standards
of psychological interventions for the treatment of
depression while providing choice to patients. This is
important giving the mounting empirical evidence that
improving patient treatment choice improves therapy
outcomes (Lindhiem, Bennett, Trentacosta & McLear,
2014; Williams et al., 2016).
Finally, in this article, we have sought to make an
argument about re-evaluating the definition of best
evidence
for
guideline
development.
Using
the
evidence base for counselling in the treatment of
depression as an example, we have argued that
guideline developers should move towards integrating
differing forms of high-quality evidence rather than
relying on trials alone. But this requires change for all
stakeholders: for individual researchers in counselling
to
be
strategic
and
ensure
their
work
builds
cumulatively on the work of others; for researchers in
organisations to yield larger and more substantive
studies; for service providers to collaborate in collating
common data through, for example, building practice
research networks; for counselling bodies to devise,
fund and implement research strategies that will
deliver a robust evidence base for practice; and for
guideline
developers
to
accept
a
diversity
of
substantive research approaches that, combined, will
yield best evidence. In doing so, not only will it be
possible to draw more robust conclusions about the
cost-effectiveness of depression treatment in the NHS
and the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of different
interventions, but also potentially the community,
service,
therapist,
and
patient
variables
that
significantly impact on patient outcomes.
