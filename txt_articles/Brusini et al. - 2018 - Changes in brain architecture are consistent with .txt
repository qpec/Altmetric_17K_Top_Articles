The most characteristic feature of domestic animals is their change
in behavior associated with selection for tameness. Here we show,
using high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging in wild and
domestic rabbits, that domestication reduced amygdala volume and
enlarged medial prefrontal cortex volume, supporting that areas
driving fear have lost volume while areas modulating negative
affect have gained volume during domestication. In contrast to the
localized gray matter alterations, white matter anisotropy was
reduced in the corona radiata, corpus callosum, and the subcortical
white matter. This suggests a compromised white matter structural
integrity in projection and association fibers affecting both afferent
and efferent neural flow, consistent with reduced neural process-
ing. We propose that compared with their wild ancestors, domestic
rabbits are less fearful and have an attenuated flight response
because of these changes in brain architecture.

omestic animals show striking changes in behavior com-
pared with their wild ancestors (1). This transformation
evolved during the domestication process, and as a result, do-
mestic animals tolerate close contact with humans and can be
handled with a reduced risk of triggering flight responses or
aggressive behavior. The domestic rabbit is particularly well
suited for exploring the relationship between phenotypic and
genetic changes associated with domestication because (i) do-
mestication is relatively recent compared with most domesti-
cated animals; (ii) wild rabbits are still abundant in southern
France, where domestication took place, enabling comparative
studies of wild and domestic rabbits; and (iii) the rabbit is both a
domestic animal and an experimental organism well suited for
in-depth phenotypic studies. The drastic change in the behavior
of the domestic rabbit was well phrased by Charles Darwin, who
stated that “no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of
the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of
the tame rabbit” (2).
We previously investigated the genetic basis for domestication
using whole-genome sequencing of multiple population samples
of wild rabbits from southern France and the Iberian Peninsula,
as well as samples representing multiple breeds of domestic
rabbits (3). The results demonstrated that phenotypic changes
during rabbit domestication evolved as a result of highly poly-
genic selection, since we observed shifts in allele frequencies at
many loci rather than fixed differences at a few domestication
loci. Furthermore, genetic changes at evolutionary conserved,
noncoding sequences in the vicinity of genes with a role in brain
and/or neural development have been particularly important,
implying alterations in brain architecture. Whether the brains of
domestic and wild rabbits differ substantially, and whether any
potential differences are generalized or localized to specific
brain areas, remain unknown, however.
Results
Experimental Design. To investigate the impact of domestication
and selection for tameness on brain architecture, we evaluated
brain morphology by analyzing gray matter (GM) volume and
white matter (WM) microstructure in eight domestic rabbits
and eight wild rabbits. GM volume was explored using high-
resolution postmortem structural magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and a region of interest (ROI) approach, together with
voxel-based morphometry to assess between-group changes in
GM density. WM analysis involved diffusion tensor imaging,
Significance
A common feature of all domestic animals is their tame be-
havior and lack of fear for humans. Consistent with this, we
have previously demonstrated that genes with a role in brain
or neural development have been particularly targeted during
rabbit domestication. Here we show, using high-resolution
magnetic resonance imaging, that domestic rabbits have an
altered brain architecture consistent with reduced emotional
processing, including attention to behaviorally relevant stim-
ulation, such as fear detection, learning, expression, and con-
trol, as well as compromised information processing. The
results, here based on rabbits, are significant for understanding
both domestication-induced reorganization of brain architec-
ture and how adaptions in brain territories and networks
supporting emotion, cognition, and behavior coincide with an
altered behavioral repertoire.

 used to extract fractional anisotropy maps, reflecting the aniso-
tropicity of water diffusion along and across neural fibers. Tract-
based spatial statistics was used to explore differences in fractional
anisotropy, associated with alterations in axonal structural in-
tegrity and level of myelination (SI Appendix, SI Text and Fig. S1).
Domestic Rabbits Have Reduced Amygdala Size and Increased Medial
Prefrontal Cortex Volume. The domestic rabbits were approxi-
mately fourfold heavier than the wild rabbits (x ± SEM = 4.12 ±
0.25 kg and 1.07 ± 0.04 kg, respectively), yet had only a slightly
larger absolute brain size (total brain volume, 9.55 ± 0.35 mL vs.
7.98 ± 0.26 mL) (Fig. 1A). This resulted in encephalization
quotients (the ratio between observed and expected brain
volume for a mammal corrected for body weight) of 0.22 ± 0.003
in the domestic rabbits and 0.46 ± 0.02 in the wild rabbits (SI
Appendix, SI Text). An altered brain-to-body size ratio was also
supported by an analysis comparing brain volume with foot
length as an indicator of body size, showing that the altered ratio
could not be explained by a difference in body composition (Fig.
1B). This result is consistent with the general observation of a
reduced brain-to-body ratio in domestic animals compared with
their wild ancestors (4).
To highlight changes associated with domestication and min-
imize within-group variability, all brain regions were normalized
to the total cerebrum volume (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text).
We first performed volumetric analysis for the GM ROIs in-
cluded in the rabbit brain atlas (5) after visual checks and manual
refinements (SI Appendix, SI Text and Fig. S1). For each ROI, we
assessed the probability to obtain the observed data by chance,
by performing t tests using 5,000 permutations (SI Appendix, SI
Text). To protect against false-positive results, we performed
Bonferroni corrections taking the number of ROIs considered
into account.
We observed specific and localized, rather than uniform and
generalized, GM changes associated with domestication. We
noted domestication-induced volume changes, with a bilateral
reduction in the size of the amygdala and enlargement of the
medial prefrontal cortex the most salient (Fig. 2). The right and
left amygdala reductions amounted to −10.1% and −8.7%, re-
spectively, whereas the right and left medial frontal cortex vol-
ume increased by 12.1% and 11.1%, respectively (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2 and Table S1). Thus, our data show that brain structures
that generate and consolidate a negative affect (6), in concert
with those that modulate and control fear and anxiety (7, 8),
have been primarily targeted during rabbit domestication. Fur-
thermore, suggestive but not statistically significant volume
changes were noted in the hippocampus and the entorhinal
cortex (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, SI Text).
In contrast to ROI analyses, which reveal total GM volume
within a ROI, voxel-based morphometry estimates GM density in
subregions voxel by voxel, enabling more precise localization (9,
10). In agreement with the aforementioned ROI-based analysis,
our voxel-based morphometry analysis also suggested two clus-
ters of structures affected by domestication, one centered around
the amygdala showing GM loss and one centered around the
frontal cortex showing GM gain (SI Appendix, Table S2). The
amygdala-centered clusters extended bilaterally into nearby
entorhinal and piriform cortices, as well as into the hippocampus
(SI Appendix, Table S2). The cluster of frontal GM increases
included the medial frontal cortex and encompassed temporal
and parietal areas (Fig. 3 A and C and SI Appendix, Table S2).
To further test whether volume alterations occurred uniformly
across the amygdala or were localized to specific subnuclei, we
superimposed volume alterations onto rabbit amygdala anatomy
(11). Voxel-based analyses demonstrated that reductions within
the amygdala were not uniform, but rather were localized to the
entire basolateral area and most parts of the central and lateral
amygdala (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Table S2). These nuclei
support efferent and afferent processing, respectively, and the
basolateral amygdala is pivotal for forming associations between
stimuli (6), supporting that amygdala subregions involved in fear
detection, learning, and expression have been targeted during
domestication.
WM Alterations in Domestic Rabbits Are Consistent with Reduced
Neural Speed and Compromised Information Processing. Next, to
evaluate WM microstructure alterations, we used tract-based
spatial statistics for fractional anisotropy, reflecting myelination,
fiber diameter, and density. Permutation tests involving 5,000
runs and corrected for multiple comparisons demonstrated that
in domestic rabbits, fractional anisotropy was lower in 86% of

 the voxels in the corona radiata, in 69% of all voxels in the
subcortical WM, and in 71% of the corpus callosum (Fig. 4 and
SI Appendix, SI Text). No region displayed significantly higher
anisotropy in domestic rabbits compared with wild rabbits. Thus,
in contrast to the localized GM reductions and enlargements,
WM alterations were unidirectional, uniform, and generalized
across multiple fiber tracts. The altered water diffusion profile in
the WM is consistent with reduced neural speed and compro-
mised information processing (12) and may mirror reduced fiber
density, myelination, and/or axonal diameter. In essence, the
basis for neural conduction is compromised in domestic rabbits.
Such alterations may be developmentally important, given that
dysgenesis of the corpus callosum in humans is associated with
mental retardation (13). Because ascending projections and the
descending projections between the cortex and corticopontine,
corticobulbar, and corticospinal tracts involve the corona radiata
(14), our results support that genetic changes during rabbit
domestication compromises WM functions in both association
and projection fibers. This implicates reduced information pro-
cessing capacity both between and within hemispheres, affecting
both afferent and efferent processes.
Discussion
Previous studies have uncovered a generally reduced brain vol-
ume relative to body size in domestic animals compared with
their wild ancestors (4). The present study based on high-
resolution MRI confirmed a reduced brain-to-body size in do-
mestic rabbits and allowed us to compare the relative sizes of 54
brain ROI. This revealed a striking reduction in the size of the
amygdala but also a profound relative enlargement of the medial
prefrontal cortex in domestic rabbits compared with wild rabbits.
Fear conditioning, when an environmental threat is predicted by
an external cue, is present in all mammals and processed in the
amygdala. In humans, a relatively larger amygdala facilitates fear
conditioning (15), and amygdala enlargement results in or from
certain anxiety disorders (16). In contrast, enlargement of the
medial frontal cortex facilitates extinction, the process of fear
reduction through safety learning (16, 17), and is generally as-
sociated with enhanced emotional control (7, 15, 16). In-
terestingly, a previous study in rabbits showed that electrical
activation of the area in the medial frontal cortex corresponding
to the enlarged area in domestic rabbits inhibited expression of
conditioned responses, supporting its functional role in attenu-
ating the expression of learned behaviors (18). The amygdala
prefrontal network also influences aggression (19), and amygdala
activity is pivotal for detecting behaviorally relevant stimulation,
reflecting its role in salience processing. Of note, automated
reflexive behaviors supported by the amygdala, such as the de-
fense response (20), are apparently attenuated in domestic rabbits
adapted to a life in captivity and in close contact with humans,
where strong flight responses are maladaptive and there is less
need for predatory-mediated fight-or-flight behavior. Moreover,
selective breeding for tame and tolerant animals is expected to
favor nonaggressive and nonattentive individuals, in contrast to
natural selection, which favors aggressive, avoidant, and attentive
wild rabbits. Collectively, these behaviors reflect detection of be-
haviorally relevant stimulation, suggestive of attenuated salience
processing as an effect of domestication. Because we used con-
servative Bonferroni corrections, the risk for committing type I
errors is reduced, but at the same time the risk for Type II errors is
increased. Thus, false-positive results are unlikely, but false-negative
results might occur, meaning that we might have missed true al-
terations in some brain territories.
In conclusion, rabbit domestication has not affected the GM
of the brain uniformly, but has led to circumscribed alterations,
enlarging areas involved in control of emotional behavior and
diminishing areas relevant for emotional memory and reflexive
and learning-related fear processing. In contrast, WM alterations
were more widespread, affected both projection and association
fibers involved in neural afferent and efferent processes, and, we
speculate, implicate reduced communication between hemi-
spheres as well as hampered top-down control. Thus, our study
based on high-resolution postmortem MRI demonstrates that
the brain architecture is remodeled in domestic rabbits, showing
that genetic changes underlying successful domestication re-
shape the structural foundation for brain function.

Specific changes in the size of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex between wild and domestic rabbits. (A) Amygdala (AMY-L and AMY-R, in blue)
volume was smaller and medial prefrontal cortex (MFC, in red) volume was larger in domestic rabbits compared with wild rabbits. The two small areas with
enhanced volume in domestic rabbits visible in the ventral view are not located entirely inside the cerebral region, but mainly intersect superficial vessel
traces, and do not reflect meaningful GM changes. (B) The reduced amygdala volume in domestic rabbits compared with wild rabbits primarily concerns the
basolateral (BL), lateral (LA), and central (CE) nuclei; these regions are denoted in red and superimposed on the rabbit nuclei map (11). (Modified from ref. 11.)

 stress, they were housed in 2 × 3-m enclosures with access to the ground
and wood cages to function as shelters. Both wild and domestic rabbits
had unrestricted access to food and water. The experimental procedures
were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research
of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (Register Project
CGL2013-43197-R), in agreement with the guidelines and regulations con-
cerning animal welfare and experimentation set forth by Spanish law.
Cardiovascular Perfusion Fixation. Eight wild and eight domestic female
rabbits were selected for the imaging studies. To avoid breed-specific effects,
we sampled domestic rabbits of three different breeds: New Zealand white,
Californian, and French lop. Rabbits were deeply anesthetized with an i.m.
injection of a mixture of xylazine (Rompun, 8 mg/kg; Bayer) and ketamine
(Imalgéne 1000, 40 mg/kg; Merial) and then euthanized with an intracardiac
injection of thiopental (Tiopental 0.5 g, 100 mg/kg; B. Braun). Next, using a
peristaltic pump (TPU2AD; Aalborg) we first used a PBS solution to flush the
vascular system free of blood, followed by cardiovascular perfusion fixation
using a 10% solution of neutral buffered formalin (NBF) containing 10%
(50 mM) gadoteridol (ProHance; Bracco Diagnostics), a magnetic resonance
imaging contrast agent (21, 22). After perfusion, heads were separated, and
skin and muscle around the skulls were removed. Brains were maintained
inside the cranium to preserve the natural shape, and were then transferred
to 10% NBF containing 1% of gadoteridol at 4 °C until imaging analysis.
Image Acquisition. Each formalin-fixed rabbit head was placed in a condom
and immersed in Fomblin (Solvay Solexis), an inert perfluorinated oil, pro-
viding a black background for the MRI images with magnetic susceptibility
similar to that of biological tissue. Each sample was imaged at 9.4 T in a
horizontal bore scanner (Varian) equipped with a gradient system with an
inner diameter of 120 mm, a maximal gradient strength of 60 G/cm, and a
birdcage coil with an inner diameter of 72 mm (Rapid Biomedical). Mainly T1-
weighted (T1W) 3D gradient echo MRI images were acquired to a voxel size of
100 μm using the following parameters: field of view, 64 × 51.2 × 51.2 mm3;
matrix, 640 × 512 × 512; recovery time, 8.01 ms; echo time, 4.02 ms; flip
angle, 20°; and four excitations. The scan time was 2 h and 20 min for each
head. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed using a 3D spin echo sequence
with diffusion-coding gradients in 12 directions, and two reference scans
without diffusion weighting were obtained. The following parameters were
used: field-of-view, 80 × 43 × 43 mm3; matrix, 512 × 192 × 192; recovery
time, 90 ms; echo time, 13.24 ms; b value, 1,000 s/mm2; 16 dummy scans, and
one excitation. The scan time was 12 h and 54 min.
Image Registration and Segmentation. Brain extraction (i.e., removal of the skull
from the image) was performed on each anatomic image (T1W image) by an
experienced human observer unaware of group designation, using an interactive
level-set method (23). Subsequently, for each rabbit, all T1W data were manually
registered to diffusion data. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were obtained for
each rabbit using FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox, a software tool for analysis of
diffusion MRI images that is part of FSL (FMRIB Software Library) (24, 25). Finally,
to improve alignment to the T1W data, automatic rigid registrations were
performed on each FA map using the ITK toolbox (https://itk.org/).
After image alignment, GM and WM parcellation were performed by ap-
plying an automatic atlas-based segmentation method using the rabbit brain
atlas (5). The atlas-based segmentation, including a total of 60 ROIs, was
carried out using NiftyReg (26, 27). Further manual refinements of the seg-
mentation of some brain structures of interest (medial frontal cortex, caudate
nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus; SI Appendix, Fig. S1) were performed
to improve the segmentation quality because of the resolution difference
between the data acquired and the atlas used (0.16 × 0.17 × 0.17 mm vs.
0.15 × 0.15 × 7 mm). Refinements generally reduced the size of the ROIs,
resulting in increased anatomic precision. Cerebrum volume was calculated by
subtracting the following six volumes from the total brain volume: the pons,
medulla, left and right cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, and mesencephalon. In
this way, 54 ROIs in the cerebrum were obtained. Between-group differences
in ROI volumes were evaluated using MATLAB release 2016b (MathWorks).
Voxel-Based Morphometry. Between-group differences in GM volume were
analyzed with FSL-VBM (28) (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM), an

plicating reduced information processing capacity both between and within hemispheres.

 optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) protocol (9) implemented
within FSL. The protocol, tailored for human brain studies, was slightly
modified and adapted to rabbit brain images. First, the GM segmentation of
a reference rabbit (randomly chosen as one of the eight wild rabbits) was
blurred with a discrete Gaussian filter of variance 0.1 mm2 to create an initial
reference segmentation. Then, a study-specific GM template was created by
nonlinearly registering the GM segmentations of each rabbit to the refer-
ence and averaging them. Subsequently, all native GM images were non-
linearly registered to this study-specific template to correct for local
expansion (or contraction) due to the nonlinear component of the spatial
transformation. The modulated GM images were smoothed with an iso-
tropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 1 mm, and finally, statistical evalu-
ations were performed using a voxelwise generalized linear model and
permutation-based nonparametric testing with a total of 5,000 permuta-
tions, thus correcting for multiple comparisons. Two types of statistics were
calculated, GMdomestic > GMwild and GMwild > GMdomestic, and voxels showing
a permutation-corrected P value < 0.05 were considered significant.
FA Analysis. To characterize the microstructural basis of WM and evaluate FA
differences between domestic and wild rabbits in the major tracts of the
brain, we used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (29), also part of FSL.
Similar to the analyses with FSL-VBM, the whole FSL-TBSS pipeline was
adapted to the rabbit brain images. FA maps were aligned to a reference FA
map of the same wild rabbit used to reference the FSL-VBM analyses by
applying the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (30, 31), which uses a b-spline
representation of the registration warp field (32). Next, the mean FA image
was created and thinned to create a conservative mean FA skeleton repre-
senting the centers of all major tracts in the rabbit brain atlas. The WM
regions of the atlas include the left and right periventricular WM, internal
capsule, corona radiata, fimbria of the hippocampus, fornix, subcortical WM
external capsule, corpus callosum, and anterior commissure. Each animal’s
aligned FA data were then projected onto this skeleton, and the resulting
data were fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistics, again using permuta-
tion tests with 5,000 permutations. Two types of statistics were calculated,
FAdomestic > FAwild and FAwild > FAdomestic. To define the location of signifi-
cant group differences, we identified all WM areas with P < 0.05 in the
rabbit brain atlas.
Statistical Analysis. Between-group differences in ROI volumes were evalu-
ated using t tests with 5,000 permutations. The statistical tests on VBM and
TBSS results were carried out using the threshold free cluster enhancement
method implemented in FSL (33), as specified in the online user guide. To
protect from false positives, permutation tests using 5,000 permutations
were performed for all analysis, both when evaluating GM volume and
fractional anisotropy. Each hemisphere was analyzed separately. Variability
between groups was evaluated and compared using Hartley’s Fmax test (34),
while independent t tests were used for weight, hind foot, and body size, as
well as total brain volume. In all analyses, P < 0.05 was the significance
threshold.
