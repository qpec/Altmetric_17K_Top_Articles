BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo intracoronary 
stenting traditionally are treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), yet this treatment leads to high risks of bleeding. We 
hypothesized that a regimen of rivaroxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy 
or rivaroxaban plus DAPT could reduce bleeding and thereby have a favorable 
impact on all-cause mortality and the need for rehospitalization.
METHODS: Stented subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (n=2124) 
were randomized 1:1:1 to administration of reduced-dose rivaroxaban 15 
mg daily plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months (group 1); rivaroxaban 2.5 
mg twice daily with stratification to a prespecified duration of DAPT of 1, 6, 
or 12 months (group 2); or the reference arm of dose-adjusted VKA daily 
with a similar DAPT stratification (group 3). The present post hoc analysis 
assessed the end point of all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization for 
an adverse event, which was further classified as the result of bleeding, a 
cardiovascular cause, or another cause blinded to treatment assignment.
RESUL
TS: The risk of all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization was 
34.9% in group 1 (hazard ratio=0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.94; 
P=0.008 versus group 3; number needed to treat=15), 31.9% in group 2 
(hazard ratio=0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.90; P=0.002 versus 
group 3; number needed to treat=10), and 41.9% in group 3 (VKA+DAPT). 
Both all-cause death plus hospitalization potentially resulting from bleeding 
(group 1=8.6% [P=0.032 versus group 3], group 2=8.0% [P=0.012 versus 
group 3], and group 3=12.4%) and all-cause death plus rehospitalization 
potentially resulting from a cardiovascular cause (group 1=21.4% [P=0.001 
versus group 3], group 2=21.7% [P=0.011 versus group 3], and group 
3=29.3%) were reduced in the rivaroxaban arms compared with the VKA arm, 
but other forms of rehospitalization were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing 
intracoronary stenting, administration of either rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus 
P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy or 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily plus DAPT was 
associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization 
for adverse events compared with standard-of-care VKA plus DAPT.

A
pproximately 5% to 8% of patients undergoing coro-
nary stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation 
(AF).1–3 Among patients undergoing first-generation 
stent implantation, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is supe-
rior to vitamin K antagonist (VKA),4 but among patients with 
AF, VKA is superior to DAPT in reducing the risk of ischemic 
stroke.5 As a result, a common practice has been to com-
bine DAPT and VKA to manage patients who have both a 
stent and AF.6 Unfortunately, this strategy, often referred 
to as triple therapy, has been associated with major bleed-
ing rates of 4% to 12% over the course of the first year of 
treatment.7
The primary results of the PIONEER study (An Open-
label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Ex-
ploring Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and 
a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment 
Strategy in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation Who Undergo 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) demonstrated that 
among subjects with AF undergoing intracoronary stent 
placement, administration of either rivaroxaban 15 mg 
daily plus P2Y12 monotherapy for 1 year or rivaroxaban 
2.5 mg twice daily plus 1, 6, or 12 months of DAPT 
at physician discretion significantly reduced the risk of 
clinically significant bleeding (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myo-
cardial Infarction] major+TIMI minor+bleeding requiring 
medical attention) compared with the current standard-
of-care VKA plus 1, 6, or 12 months of DAPT with com-
parable efficacy, although the confidence intervals (CIs) 
were broad for efficacy.8 We hypothesized that a signifi-
cant reduction in bleeding with favorable trends in overall 
efficacy would also be associated with a significant re-
duction in all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization.
METHODS
Study Oversight
The executive committee, in conjunction with the sponsor, 
designed the study. All statistical analyses were performed by 
the PERFUSE (Perfusion Use in Stroke Evaluation Study) group 
using a copy of the Study Data Tabulation Model database. 
The academic members of the executive committee drafted 
the manuscript and made all revisions. Both national and insti-
tutional regulatory agencies and ethics committees approved 
the study. An independent data and safety monitoring board 
monitored the scientific integrity and the safety of the trial.
Study Population
Details of the trial design have been published previously.9 In 
brief, the trial enrolled men and women >18 years of age with 
paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular AF who under-
went percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. 
Major exclusion criteria included clinically significant bleeding 
within the past 12 months, a creatinine clearance <30 mL/
min, anemia of unknown cause with a hemoglobin <10 g/dL, 
significant gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 12 months 
or any condition known to increase the risk of bleeding, a prior 
stroke or transient ischemic attack, stent placement during the 
index hospitalization for in-stent restenosis, and stent thrombo-
sis during the index hospitalization. All subjects provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Study Protocol and Treatment Strategies
Subjects were randomized within 72 hours of sheath removal 
once the international normalized ratio was ≤ 2.5. The respon-
sible clinician prespecified the intended duration of DAPT (1, 
6, or 12 months) and the intended P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, 
prasugrel, or ticagrelor) before randomization. Subjects were 
randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 
mg for subjects with moderate renal impairment [creatinine 
clearance 30–50 mL/min]) once daily plus background single 
antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg once daily (or 
ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or prasugrel 10 mg once daily 
in up to 15% of subjects per group) for 12 months (although 
aspirin could be administered up to 24 hours before the first 
dose of study drug, it was to be withheld after randomization; 
group 1); rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus background 
DAPT with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) plus clopidogrel 
75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or prasugrel 
10 mg once daily in up to 15% of subjects per group) for a 
prespecified duration of either 12 months or for 1 or 6 months 
followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for subjects with 
moderate renal impairment) once daily plus background single 
antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg; group 
2); or traditional triple therapy with dose-adjusted VKA once 
daily to achieve a target international normalized ratio of 2.0 
to 3.0 plus background DAPT with low-dose aspirin (75–100 
mg/d) plus clopidogrel 75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor 90 mg 
twice daily or prasugrel 10 mg once daily in up to 15% of 
subjects per group) for a prespecified duration of either 12 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Coronary stent patients with atrial fibrillation 
who are managed with triple therapy (vitamin K 
antagonist+dual antiplatelet therapy) face a high 
risk of bleeding. 
• This substudy of the PIONEER trial (An Open-label, 
Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring 
Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-
Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strat-
egy in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation Who Undergo 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) demonstrates 
that either rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus P2Y12 inhibitor 
monotherapy or rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 
dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with a reduced 
risk of all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization 
for adverse events compared with standard-of-care 
vitamin K antagonist plus dual antiplatelet therapy.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Rehospitalizations potentially attributable to either 
bleeding or cardiovascular events were reduced 
with both rivaroxaban strategies.

months or for 1 or 6 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA 
once daily (target international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0) plus 
background single antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin 
(75–100 mg; group 3).
End Points
The primary end point of the substudy was the occurrence 
of all-cause death or rehospitalization for an adverse event. 
Adverse events were defined according to the International 
Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Study investigators 
were responsible for reporting all adverse events and indicat-
ing the seriousness of the event, as well as whether the event 
resulted in inpatient hospitalization. Those adverse events that 
resulted in hospitalization are included in this analysis. Two phy-
sicians (C.M.G. and G.C.) blinded to study drug assignment 
were provided with a list of adverse event terms associated 
with rehospitalization. All adverse events were classified as 
potentially attributable to bleeding, cardiovascular causes, or 
other causes through consensus. All adverse event terms, the 
number of events per term, and their categorization are shown 
in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
SAS version 9.4 was used to perform all statistical analyses. 
All patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug 
were included in the analysis; subjects were analyzed on an 
as-treated basis; and for the primary analysis, the data were 
pooled across all strata of DAPT duration (1, 6, 12 months) 
as prespecified. The cumulative percentages of all deaths and 
rehospitalizations for an adverse event observed from the time 
of the first study drug was first administered up to 2 days after 
discontinuation of the study drug were calculated. Two spe-
cific pairwise comparisons were made simultaneously (group 
1 versus 3 and group 2 versus 3) with no adjustment to the 
type I error rate of 0.05. A Cox proportional hazard model was 
used to compare the time from administration of the first dose 
of study drug to the first occurrence any cause of death or 
hospitalization for an adverse event with treatment group as 
a covariate to provide a point estimate (hazard ratio [HR]) and 
2-sided 95% CI. Cumulative event rates were summarized at 
360 days with the Kaplan-Meier method. The Wei-Lin-Weissfeld 
method was used to calculate unadjusted HRs and 95% CIs 
for the multiple event analysis.10 The Wei-Lin-Weissfeld method 
uses a semiparametric marginal Cox distribution and takes into 
account all multiple events of interest that a subject has dur-
ing the study versus a traditional time to first event analysis. 
Because of the nonindependent nature of these data, sand-
wich variance estimation was used. Six subjects from 1 site 
(n=4 in the rivaroxaban groups versus n=2 in the VKA group) 
were excluded from all analyses because of violations of 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines before unblinding. A value of 
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was 
a nonprespecified post hoc analysis.
RESULTS
From May 10, 2013, through July 30, 2015, a total of 
2124 subjects were randomized. The baseline charac-
teristics of the subjects were well matched, as reported

in the primary publication8 (Table 1 and Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The median age was 71 
years (interquartile range, 64–77 years), and 25.6% of 
subjects were women. The median CHADS2, CHA2DS2-
VASc, and HAS-BLED scores were 2, 4, and 3, respec-
tively.8 The time in therapeutic range for the interna-
tionalized normalized ratio was 65% and did not vary 
by region.8 No patients were lost to follow-up, and the 
ascertainment of all-cause death was 100% complete 
in this trial.8
The risk of all-cause mortality or recurrent hospital-
ization was 34.9% in group 1 (rivaroxaban 15 mg once 
daily+P2Y12 inhibitor; HR= 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.94; 
P=0.008 versus group 3 [VKA+DAPT]; number need-
ed to treat=15), 31.9% in group 2 (rivaroxaban 2.5 
mg twice daily+DAPT; HR=0.75; 95% CI, 0.62–0.90; 
P=0.002 versus group 3 [VKA+DAPT]; number needed 
to treat=10), and 41.9% in group 3 (reference group 
of VKA+DAPT; Table 2 and Figure 1). No significant 
interaction terms were found in subgroup analyses 
(Figures I and II in the online-only Data Supplement), 
including duration of DAPT. Both all-cause death plus 
hospitalization potentially for bleeding (group 1=8.6% 
[P=0.032 versus group 3], group 2=8.0% [P=0.012 
versus group 3], and group 3=12.4%) and all-cause 
death plus rehospitalization potentially for a cardiovas-
cular cause (group 1=21.4% [P=0.001 versus group 
3], group 2=21.7% [P=0.011 versus group 3], and 
group 3=29.3%) were reduced in the rivaroxaban arms 
compared with the VKA arm. No reductions were seen 
for either rivaroxaban arm compared with the VKA arm 
for other causes of rehospitalization or for all-cause 
death (Table 2).
The rate of all-cause rehospitalization was 34.1% in 
group 1 (rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily+P2Y12 inhibitor; 
HR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; P=0.005 versus group 3 
[VKA+DAPT]), 31.2% in group 2 (rivaroxaban 2.5 twice 
daily+DAPT; HR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.61–0.88; P=0.001 
versus group 3 [VKA+ DAPT]), and 41.5% in group 3 
(reference arm of VKA+DAPT; Table 3 and Figure 2). 
The relative reduction in recurrent hospitalization was 
greater for bleeding events, but the absolute reduction 
in recurrent hospitalization was greater for cardiovascu-
lar events (Table 3 and Figure 3). There were no signifi-
cant interaction terms in the assessment of subgroups, 
including DAPT duration (Figures III and IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). Although the above analysis as-
sessed the time to the first event, some patients were 
hospitalized on >1 occasion. The risk of multiple re-
hospitalizations for any given subject showed a magni-
tude of event reduction similar to that observed for the 
time to first event reduction (group 1 versus group 3: 
Figure 1. Time to all-cause death or 
first recurrent hospitalization. 
The treatment-emergent period is the 
period starting after the first study drug 
administration following randomization and 
ending 2 days after the study drug was 
stopped. Hazard ratios (HRs) compared 
with the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) group 
are based on the Cox proportional hazards 
model. Rehospitalizations do not include 
first index event hospitalization. Log-rank 
P values compared with the VKA group are 
based on the 2-sided log-rank test. ARR

DISCUSSION
Among patients with AF undergoing coronary stent 
placement, the administration of rivaroxaban in either of 
2 dose strategies was associated with a reduced risk of 
all-cause mortality or recurrent hospitalization for any ad-
verse event compared with a VKA plus DAPT. There was 
a reduction in the risk of both a first rehospitalization 
and all (any) rehospitalizations for adverse events. The 
absolute reduction in cardiovascular events was greater 
but the relative reduction was greater for bleeding in the 
rivaroxaban arms. The number needed to treat with ri-
varoxaban to prevent 1 death or hospitalization ranged 
from 10 for 2.5 mg rivaroxaban+DAPT to 15 for 15 mg 
rivaroxaban+P2Y12 inhibitor. The results of the present 
analysis add to and strengthen the primary results of 
the study and demonstrate that the reduction in bleeding 
and efficacy events was clinically meaningful insofar as it 
often resulted in fewer hospitalizations in these patients. 
Although the results of this analysis demonstrate a sta-
tistically significant improvement in clinical events, there 
is also the potential to improve healthcare value because 
rehospitalization may be costly.
Both the present analysis and the primary report8 
of the primary safety end point (TIMI major+TIMI 
minor+bleeding requiring medical attention) demon-
strated a reduction in bleeding events. In contrast to 
the results presented here, however, there was no dif-
ference in the prespecified occurrence of the rigorously 
adjudicated composite secondary end point of death, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke.8 Recurrent hospitaliza-
tion is a more frequent end point and is ascertained with 
greater sensitivity but less specificity than the traditional 
adjudicated end point of death/myocardial infarction and 
stroke. As a result, the present analysis had much great-
er statistical power (90%) to ascertain a 20% difference 
in the treatment strategies (the magnitude observed in 
the present analysis), whereas the end points of cardio-
vascular death/myocardial infarction and stroke had only 
16.8% power to ascertain a 20% treatment difference 
(Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Although 
many hospitalizations did not qualify as a death/myocar-
dial infarction or stroke, underlying thrombosis or isch-
emia still may have played a role in the hospitalization. 
The fact that bleeding and cardiovascular events differed 
among the strategies but other causes of hospitalization 
did not supports the acceptable specificity of rehospital-
ization as an end point.
Although adjudication of events in clinical trials is 
often based on rigorous definitions and meticulously 
collected source documents, it still relies on an adjudi-
cation process, which, although conducted by experts, 
may still be somewhat subjective. Prior studies have 
demonstrated that conclusions related to the adjudica-
tion of clinical end points often vary across adjudicators, 
clinical sites, and core laboratories dedicated to an end 
point, for instance.11 The rate of concordance varies 
significantly according to the experience and judgment 
of the adjudicator, the availability and quality of source 
documents, and the type of the end point itself.11 Advan-
tages of using all-cause mortality or rehospitalization as 
end points are the near certainty of the occurrence and 
robust documentation of the events (eg, death certifi-
cate or insurance claims data or trial data documenting 
hospital admission), making them objective end points 
that do not require an adjudicator’s interpretation. As a 
result of these potential advantages, these end points 
have been referred to as the gold standard of clinical 
events.12 In contrast, identification of cause-specific mor-
tality or nonfatal events such as myocardial infarction or

The treatment-emergent period is the 
period starting after the first study drug 
administration following randomization and 
ending 2 days after the study drug was 
stopped. Hazard ratios (HRs) compared 
with the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) group 
are based on the Cox proportional hazards 
model. Rehospitalizations do not include 
first index event hospitalization. Log-rank  
P values compared with VKA group are

once daily+P2Y12 inhibitor.

 Rivaroxaban Reduces Recurrent Hospitalization

stroke may be complex, inconsistent, and often inferred 
(eg, assuming that all unidentified causes of death are 
cardiovascular deaths). Although subjects with myocar-
dial infarctions and strokes are hospitalized to establish 
these diagnoses, deaths may occur without hospitaliza-
tion, and for this reason, it is critical that all-cause death 
be added to the end point of hospitalization. In addition, 
all-cause mortality and rehospitalization are comprehen-
sive end points that encompass the occurrence of both 
efficacy and safety events. For example, in evaluations 
of all-cause mortality, death resulting from a myocardial 
infarction (efficacy end point) carries a similar weight as 
death resulting from significant gastrointestinal bleeding 
(safety end point) with no need to distinguish between 
two. Prior studies such as the ATHENA trial (A Trial With 
Dronedarone to Prevent Hospitalization or Death in Pa-
tients With Atrial Fibrillation), which supported the ap-
proval of dronedarone for treatment of nonpermanent 
AF, have used the composite of hospitalization and all-
cause death as a primary means to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of a therapeutic strategy.13,14
Hospitalizations may not have been due to a death/
myocardial infarction or stroke but may nonetheless be 
associated with a poor quality of life and higher costs.

Because costs for rehospitalizations after percutaneous 
coronary intervention involving bleeding and cardiovas-
cular events are substantial, a 10% absolute and a 25% 
relative reduction in the risk of hospitalization would 
likely be associated with a reduction in healthcare costs.

 Rivaroxaban Reduces Recurrent Hospitalization

estimated to be approximately US $8000 (2011 esti-
mate),15,16 similar to costs for common cardiovascular 
conditions such as chest pain (≈$8000), heart failure 
(≈$10 
000), and percutaneous coronary intervention 
(≈$25 
000) that result in rehospitalization. In addition, 
the total cost of international normalized ratio monitor-
ing per year has been estimated to be $2134 in the first 
year and $1170 per year thereafter as long as stable 
levels have been attained.17
The results of the study stratified by DAPT dura-
tion are of interest to practicing clinicians. However, 
there are limitations to exploring the results in these 
subgroups. There was a negative interaction term for 
DAPT duration for the end point of all-cause mortality 
and rehospitalization, and the validity of interrogating 
these subgroups is questionable. The decision to treat 
patients with 1, 6, or 12 months of DAPT was not ran-
domized and was based on clinician preference. As 
might be expected, there were imbalances in patient 
characteristics across the DAPT duration strata (Table 
V in the online-only Data Supplement) and imbalances in 
patient characteristics within each DAPT duration stra-
tum across the 3 treatment strategies (Tables VI–VIII in 
the online-only Data Supplement). In addition to imbal-
ances in these identified confounders, there are likely 
imbalances in unidentified confounders. Last, there was 
no adjustment for multiplicity in testing for these sub-
groups and others.
The results presented here are generally applicable to 
those patients treated with clopidogrel. Given the small 
number of patients treated with novel thienopyridines, 
additional trials would be required to more rigorously as-
sess both the safety and efficacy of concomitant therapy 
with prasugrel or ticagrelor in a larger population.
Limitations
The present analysis is a post hoc analysis. No adjust-
ment was made to account for multiple testing. Accord-
ingly, statistically significant differences between the 
groups should be interpreted in this context. The method 
of allocating events to bleeding, cardiovascular, or other 
causes was not described a priori. This methodology 
could be prospectively applied by others using the ex-
tensive tables provided in the online-only Data Supple-
ment that describe how these adverse events can be 
mapped into the 3 categories. This analysis is based on 
a randomized, controlled trial with specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (including the exclusion of patients at 
high risk of bleeding), and the results of the study may 
not be generalizable to all patients in clinical practice. 
Hospital bills and length of stay were not collected to as-
sess costs. Although the 2.5 mg twice daily plus DAPT 
dosing regimen is currently indicated and available in 
Europe and a number of other countries for the second-
ary prevention of acute coronary syndrome events, the

15/10 mg once daily dosing strategy studied here is 
currently not approved for the management of patients 
with either acute coronary syndrome or AF. Sites were 
unblinded with respect to warfarin therapy, although clini-
cal event categorization was blinded. It could be argued 
that there was a general bias to admit more patients 
on open-label VKA to the hospital. The increase in re-
hospitalization, however, was attributable exclusively to 
bleeding and cardiovascular causes alone. There was no 
difference among the 3 strategies with respect to rehos-
pitalization for all other types of adverse events, indicat-
ing that clinicians were not biased in attributing all types 
of additional hospitalizations in general to VKA+DAPT.
