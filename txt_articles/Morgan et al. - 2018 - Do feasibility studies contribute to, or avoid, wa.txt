Abstract
In the context of avoiding research waste, the conduct of a feasibility study before a clinical
trial should reduce the risk that further resources will be committed to a trial that is likely to
‘fail’. However, there is little evidence indicating whether feasibility studies add to or reduce
waste in research. Feasibility studies funded by the National Institute for Health Research’s
(NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) programme were examined to determine how
many had published their findings, how many had applied for further funding for a full trial
and the timeframe in which both of these occurred. A total of 120 feasibility studies which
had closed by May 2016 were identified and each Principal Investigator (PI) was sent a
questionnaire of which 89 responses were received and deemed suitable for analysis.
Based on self reported answers from the PIs a total of 57 feasibility studies were judged as
feasible, 20 were judged not feasible and for 12 it was judged as uncertain whether a full trial
was feasible. The RfPB programme had spent approximately £19.5m on the 89 feasibility
studies of which 16 further studies had been subsequently funded to a total of £16.8m. The
20 feasibility studies which were judged as not feasible potentially saved up to approxi-
mately £20m of further research funding which would likely to have not completed success-
fully. The average RfPB feasibility study took 31 months (range 18 to 48) to complete and
cost £219,048 (range £72,031 to £326,830) and the average full trial funded from an RfPB
feasibility study took 42 months (range 26 to 55) to complete and cost £1,163,996 (range
£321,403 to £2,099,813). The average timeframe of feasibility study and full trial was 72
months (range 56 to 91), however in addition to this time an average of 10 months (range -7
to 29) was taken between the end of the feasibility study and the application for the full trial,
and a further average of 18 months (range 13 to 28) between the application for the full trial
and the start of the full trial. Approximately 58% of the 89 feasibility studies had published
their findings with the majority of the remaining studies still planning to publish. Due to the
long time frames involved a number of studies were still in the process of publishing the fea-
sibility findings and/or applying for a full trial. Feasibility studies are potentially useful at
avoiding waste and de-risking funding investments of more expensive full trials, however
there is a clear time delay and therefore some potential waste in the existing research
pathway.

 Introduction
Chalmers and Glasziou [1, 2] have pointed out the wastefulness of much research when rele-
vant questions are not asked, the study design is inappropriate or results are either inaccurately
reported or not made promptly available. These strictures have particular relevance for clinical
trials where investment is often large and the clinical benefits more immediate than labora-
tory-based biomedical research. Indeed, one study of almost 8,000 cancer trials found that
20% failed to complete: a waste, not only in terms of funding, but also the time and commit-
ment of the 48,000 patients involved [3]. Trials which ‘fail’ normally do so because they are
unable to recruit the target number of patients. In recent years it has become increasingly com-
mon to conduct a preliminary ‘feasibility study’ to assess whether a full trial is likely to be suc-
cessfully completed.
Feasibility studies ‘de-risk’ the funding of a full clinical trial. If the feasibility study shows
that a full trial would be unlikely to meet the necessary patient recruitment/retention rates,
intervention acceptability amongst other feasibility outcomes then the potential wasted cost of
that trial is avoided. If, on the other hand, the feasibility study shows a full trial is likely to be
successfully completed it reassures both funders and researchers that the cost and effort is
likely to be worthwhile. Yet, while feasibility studies might avoid the wastefulness of funding
trials that will not be successfully completed, they add costs, including the inevitable delay they
introduce in completing any subsequent full trial. Do these costs of feasibility studies outweigh
the subsequent waste they help avoid? The recent growth in number of feasibility studies has
assumed the savings are worthwhile–but as yet without firm empirical evidence.
The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is a major funder of clinical trials in the UK
(particularly through its Health Technology Assessment programme). Feasibility studies to see
whether such trials are likely to be completed contribute to funding decisions; over the last decade
the Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) programme has funded over a hundred such studies.
Whether feasibility studies contribute to, or avoid, research waste was assessed in this study
by investigating the outcomes of such studies funded by the RfPB programme.
Methods
Feasibility studies that had completed by May 2016 were identified from the RfPB project data-
base by searching for keywords, ‘feasibility’, ‘feasible’ and ‘pilot’. While there is some overlap
between feasibility and pilot studies, recent guidance has proposed that pilot studies should be
seen as a sub-set of feasibility studies [4]. Furthermore, a recent extension to the CONSORT
statement to include pilot and feasibility studies will assist future reporting of such studies [5].
Nevertheless, for this study projects identified from the keyword search were scrutinised for
indications that they were investigating whether a subsequent full trial would be feasible.
The principal investigator (PI) for each identified feasibility study was then sent a question-
naire asking them (a) to confirm their study was intended to assess the feasibility of a full trial,
(b) whether the study had shown a full trial to be feasible, (c) whether they had applied for fund-
ing for such a trial and (d) whether they had published the results of their feasibility study. A
reminder email was sent to PIs followed up by a telephone call for those who had not responded.
Responses were collated and examined in the context of the cost of the feasibility study find-
ings for subsequent full trials, and in relation to the timeline from initial funding to (antici-
pated) trial completion.
Results
Key word searches conducted on all 418 RfPB studies that had closed by May 2016 identified
158 unique studies. These studies were then reviewed (by BM and JH) and 120 were identified

 as being concerned with investigating feasibility parameters for a full trial. Questionnaires
were sent to the principal investigators. Fig 1 shows the responses to the survey. Ninety-three
responses were received; four reported not having conducted a feasibility study giving a valid
response rate of 77% (89 responses suitable for analysis). Of those responding, 57 thought a
full trial feasible, 20 that it was not and 12 were not sure.
The four responses stating that a feasibility study had not been conducted were due to one
study being eventually conducted as a full trial, one study being a piece of developmental work
prior to a feasibility study, and two studies where the PIs stated that their studies were not fea-
sibility studies with a view to progress to a full trial.
A total of 27 of the PIs who were sent the questionnaire did not respond. Table 1 shows that
the characteristics of the feasibility studies which responded were not significantly different
from those which did not respond.
An important source of research waste identified by Chalmers and Glasziou was the non-
or delayed publication of results. Table 2 shows the proportion of feasibility studies in this

 sample that had published their results or were still intending to do so. Most respondents had
published their results though about a third were still only intending to do so despite their
study having completed on average over 14 months ago.
The main purpose of a feasibility study is to ‘de-risk’ potential full trial funding. Ideally,
therefore all studies in which a full trial was shown to be feasible should be on a trajectory to
full trial funding. Table 3 shows that of the 57 studies where a full trial was judged feasible 15
had secured funding for further research (including one feasibility study leading to two full tri-
als) including 12 full trials, two pilot studies and two pieces of further developmental research.
A further 17 had tried to secure funding and been unsuccessful but were still trying while 17
reported that they had not yet applied but still intended to do so.
Feasibility studies can avoid waste by preventing the funding of trials that would likely ‘fail’.
The funding for the full trials obtained by the 12 successful feasibility study applicants was just
over £1m per trial (mean £1,163,966, range £321,403 to £2,099,813) implying a rough ‘saving’
of £20-30m if all those which were either not feasible or uncertain if feasible (20 and 12 respec-
tively) had applied directly for and been successful in getting full trial funding. The mean cost
of the feasibility studies in this review was £219,048 (range £72,031 to £326,830).
The timeline of the 15 feasibility studies that progressed along the pathway to full trials
(though some of these involved further development work, including subsequent pilot trials) is
shown in Fig 2 and Table 4. The feasibility studies lasted about three years but then many
paused before proceeding for further funding. That application process and subsequent start
delays added a further year or so to the timeline. The mean time trajectory was about eight
years (assuming full trials complete to time) until final results that might benefit patients
would be produced. The mean time between completing the feasibility study and applying for
a full trial was 10 months (during which applicants might have had to wait for funding call
dates) and, if successful, it took a further 18 months for the full trial to start.
Table 5 shows the funders which researchers applied to for the full trial. These sources are
almost all separate programme funding streams within NIHR. It includes funders which either

 funded the full trial/further research (which may not necessarily have been the researchers first
application) or the first application for a full trial which was unsuccessful. Out of a total of 38
researchers who had applied for further funding a total of 9 had submitted multiple applica-
tions to funders and a total of 19 researchers are still planning applications to funders.
Discussion
About £19.5m was ‘invested’ in these 89 feasibility studies and they leveraged a further £16.8m
with follow-on funding. Forty seven of the PIs said they were still intending to apply for the
full trial and if such future applications were to be successful this latter figure would increase

 considerably. The 20 projects that reported negative and the 12 with ‘uncertain’ feasibility
results represent savings by preventing ‘failed’ trials. With full trials costing about £1m each,
this saving is considerable. However, whether all these clinical questions would have been
judged as priorities [2]–especially three years after the initial study award–and therefore
funded is difficult to judge.
The success rates in obtaining full trial funding for ‘positive’ feasibility studies, however,
were not as high as might be expected for ‘de-risked’ trials. About half of positive feasibility
studies had applied for funding but only half of these had been successful. According to the
responses to our questionnaires, lack of success had not deterred many of these applicants and
subsequent funding might yet be obtained. A further third had not applied but were still
intending to. Even so, each of these feasibility studies that does not proceed to the next step
represents some sort of wasted resource and opportunity.
Publication of the study findings should guide future research in the area and contribute
value to the field. Yet publication figures are not encouraging with just over half having pub-
lished so far. This publication rate is similar to that reported for full trials [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
especially negative ones, though some funders report better results [12]. These figures might
partly be explained by the difficulty in publishing the results of feasibility studies, however the
appearance of more journals specialising in trial methods, such as Pilot and feasibility studies,
may help this situation in future.
Finally, as Fig 2 shows, there are delays in generating conclusive results which may affect
patients’ welfare. Feasibility studies added between 50–100% to the time of a full trial. Some of
this delay was attributable to the research team taking time to apply. Almost half the feasibility
studies that led to a full trial incurred delays of several months between the feasibility study fin-
ishing and the application for a full trial. This may depend on the nature of the uncertainty
parameters the feasibility study was testing: some feasibility studies might have to wait until
the very end of the study to submit an application while others can start preparing that applica-
tion beforehand. The delays between a positive funding decision and a trial starting are likely
to be influenced by regulatory hurdles and staff recruitment. It is not clear how far these can
be further reduced.
When Chalmers and Glasziou identified waste in research they first described poor research
questions and research design. Feasibility studies represent an attempt to get the question and
design right prior to full funding so avoiding the trap of supporting projects that ask the wrong
questions and/or not designed to be successfully completed. When feasibility studies demon-
strate that a full trial is not feasible, they prevent waste. We have estimated that for an outlay of
£19.5 million on feasibility studies in one programme this may have saved the wider NIHR at
least £20 million. When a full trial is feasible, then the costs and benefits are more difficult to
estimate, as the failure of many of the feasibility studies described here to proceed in a timely
manner may represent another source of waste rather than waste avoidance. As Fig 2 shows, it

 takes about 5 years between applying for funding and getting the trial results (assuming exten-
sions are not needed); a feasibility study adds another 3 years to this total. Feasibility studies
might therefore save money but they do not save time. Yet, without prior feasibility studies
research funding for some important clinical questions might be judged as too high risk, and
therefore may not be funded at all. Feasibility studies can provide that reassurance and poten-
tially avoid subsequent waste but at a cost in terms of the time it takes to get an answer to the
question.
