In Brief
Holloway et al. show that an inability of
ADP to decrease mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species emission contributes to
redox stress in skeletal muscle tissue of
older individuals and that this process is
not recovered following prolonged
resistance-type exercise training, despite
the general benefits of resistance training
for muscle health.

SUMMARY
It remains unknown if mitochondrial bioenergetics
are altered with aging in humans. We established
an in vitro method to simultaneously determine
mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 emission in skel-
etal muscle tissue across a range of biologically rele-
vant ADP concentrations. Using this approach, we
provide evidence that, although the capacity for
mitochondrial H2O2 emission is not increased with
aging, mitochondrial ADP sensitivity is impaired.
This resulted in an increase in mitochondrial H2O2
and the fraction of electron leak to H2O2, in the pres-
ence of virtually all ADP concentrations examined.
Moreover, although prolonged resistance training in
older individuals increased muscle mass, strength,
and maximal mitochondrial respiration, exercise
training did not alter H2O2 emission rates in the
presence of ADP, the fraction of electron leak to
H2O2, or the redox state of the muscle. These data
establish that a reduction in mitochondrial ADP
sensitivity increases mitochondrial H2O2 emission
and contributes to age-associated redox stress.
INTRODUCTION
Aging is a complex process associated with skeletal muscle and
strength loss as well as insulin resistance (Baumgartner et al.,
1998; Nair, 2005). The cellular mechanisms causing muscular
and/or metabolic dysfunction with aging remain poorly under-
stood. However, one proposed mechanism of action driving
the aging process is an increase in mitochondrial-derived
reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Jang et al., 2010). Specifically,
increased ROS emission has been associated with motor unit
loss and abnormal morphology (Kuwahara et al., 2010), muscle
fiber atrophy (Kondo et al., 1991; Min et al., 2011), insulin resis-
tance (Houstis et al., 2006), inflammation (Khodr and Khalil,
2001), and apoptosis (Simon et al., 2000). Conversely, trans-
genic
and
pharmacological
approaches
that
attenuate
mitochondrial ROS have been shown to preserve insulin sensi-
tivity (Anderson et al., 2009), mitochondrial content (Lee et al.,
2010), and muscle mass in diverse models (Min et al., 2011;
Siegel et al., 2013) while also prolonging lifespan (Schriner
et al., 2005). Altogether, these data implicate mitochondrial
ROS as a fundamental mechanism of action influencing the
aging phenotype.
Although these elegant rodent models provide compelling
evidence to link mitochondrial ROS with age-associated pathol-
ogies, the data in humans remain ambiguous. For instance,
although indices of redox stress have repeatedly been shown
to increase with human aging (Barrientos et al., 1997; Rizvi and
Maurya, 2007; Sohal et al., 2002), in vitro assessments of mito-
chondrial ROS emission do not appear to increase (Capel
et al., 2005; Distefano et al., 2017; Gouspillou et al., 2014;
Gram et al., 2015). These contradictory findings suggest that
either mitochondria are not responsible for the increased oxida-
tive stress with aging or, alternatively, contemporary in vitro
assessment of mitochondrial ROS emission does not accurately
reflect in vivo responses. In this respect, rates of ROS emission
have almost exclusively been determined in the presence of
succinate, and the subsequent reverse flow of electrons from
complex II to complex I, which represents the capacity of
mitochondria to produce ROS. However, stoichiometrically,
succinate represents a small percentage of the electrons
entering the electron transport chain (ETC; �17%), and the
delivery of electrons to the FMN binding site of complex I
promotes forward electron flow, which has been shown to
dramatically
attenuate
succinate-mediated
ROS
formation
(Lambert and Brand, 2004). In addition, previous assessments
of mitochondrial ROS with aging have been conducted in the
absence of ADP (usually with oligomycin). However, the move-
ment of ADP into the matrix, and the subsequent binding of
ADP to the F1 subunit of ATP synthase, decreases proton motive
force and the production of mitochondrial ROS (Anderson and
Neufer, 2006; Anderson et al., 2007; Picard et al., 2010). Impor-
tantly, resting skeletal muscle has �25–100 mM free ADP (Perry
et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 1996), and ADP transport is a highly
regulated process that is attenuated with rodent models of
insulin resistance (Smith et al., 2013) and improved following
high-intensity exercise (Ydfors et al., 2016). Moreover, there is

 indirect evidence to suggest that the protein required for ADP
transport into mitochondria, adenine nucleotide translocase
(ANT), is impaired with aging in housefly and rat skeletal muscle
(Feng et al., 2008; Yan and Sohal, 2000). Therefore, previous
assessments of mitochondrial ROS emission in the absence of
ADP may not adequately reflect the in vivo environment, and
as a result current data from human skeletal muscle may
underestimate the importance of mitochondrial ROS in the aging
process.
In the present study we re-evaluated mitochondrial bio-
energetics by establishing a protocol in permeabilized muscle
fibers to simultaneously examine mitochondrial respiration and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission in the presence of various
substrates and ADP concentrations. Using this in vitro protocol,
we assessed age-related mitochondrial defects by comparing
healthy young males to healthy older males. We also examined
whether potential age-related defects in mitochondrial bioener-
getics could be improved over 12 weeks of resistance exercise
training. We provide compelling evidence that although the
capacity for mitochondrial ROS emission is not increased with
aging, mitochondrial ADP sensitivity is impaired, such that
mitochondrial ROS, and the fraction of electron leak to ROS,
are increased in the presence of virtually all ADP concentrations
examined.
In
addition,
although
resistance-type
exercise
training improved several aspects of muscle health in older indi-
viduals, the fraction of electron leak to ROS, mitochondrial H2O2
emission rates in the presence of ADP, and muscle redox stress
were unaltered, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial ROS
accompanies the aging process.
RESULTS
Establishment of an In Vitro Methodology to Assess
Mitochondrial Bioenergetics
We first aimed to establish a methodology to simultaneously
measure mitochondrial ROS and oxygen consumption rates in
the presence of mixed substrates, including ADP. The provision
of succinate induces reverse electron flow, preventing the ability
to assess respiratory sensitivity in the absence of rotenone,
which does not occur physiologically. Therefore, we aimed to
use pyruvate to induce forward electron flow after the addition
of succinate, and in this manner a single protocol would generate
the typical capacity estimate for mitochondrial ROS (succinate
supported) and a mixed substrate-supported ROS rate (succi-
nate and pyruvate/malate). Although forward electron flow has
been suggested to attenuate succinate-induced ROS (Lambert
and Brand, 2004), the provision of pyruvate did not alter H2O2
emission rates in human skeletal muscle fibers (Figure 1A). We
therefore reasoned that previous studies used higher concentra-
tions of malate, and the resulting accumulation of oxaloacetate,
inhibited SDH activity. To test this we titrated in malate, and
report that at higher concentrations mitochondrial ROS is
attenuated (Figure 1B), suggesting oxaloacetate, and not for-
ward electron flow, attenuates mitochondrial ROS. Given the
establishment that mitochondrial ROS is detectable with a mixed
complex I (CI) and complex II (CII) protocol, we next titrated ADP
after the addition of pyruvate + malate to determine the ability of
ADP to stimulate respiration (Figure 1C). Using this approach,
maximal ADP stimulated respiration �4-fold and completely
ablated H2O2 emission (Figure 1C), while submaximal ADP con-
centrations altered these bioenergetic responses to various
degrees and enabled estimates of ADP sensitivity to stimulate
respiration (apparent ADP Km; Figure 1D) and attenuate mito-
chondrial ROS emission (apparent half maximal inhibitory
concentration [IC50]; Figure 1E) to be calculated.
Examination of Mitochondrial Bioenergetics with Aging
We next examined mitochondrial bioenergetics with aging using
this methodology. To accomplish this we compared bioener-
getic responses of permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers in
healthy young (26 ± 2 years) and older (70 ± 1 years) individuals
who displayed greater BMI, homeostatic model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.06), and glycated hemoglo-
bin (HbA1c) (Table 1). We recruited young individuals who
were not well trained (peak oxygen consumption [VO2peak]
44 ± 3 mL/kg/min) in an attempt to minimize differences in phys-
ical fitness between the two age groups. Nevertheless, the
skeletal muscle of older individuals displayed reductions in the
proportion, and cross-sectional area, of type II fibers (Figures
1A and 1B), supporting previous reports suggesting the prefer-
ential atrophy of type II fibers with aging (Klitgaard et al., 1990;
Nilwik et al., 2013).
We first examined classical assessments of mitochondrial
bioenergetics in these individuals and found no differences be-
tween young and old with respect to respiration in the presence
(state III) or absence (state II) of ADP or in maximal oxidative
phosphorylation or respiratory control ratio (RCR) (Figure 2C).
In addition, maximal succinate and succinate + pyruvate H2O2
emission rates (Figure 2D), as well as the abundance of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins (Figures 2E and 2F), were
not altered with aging. However, although the provision of
pyruvate did not stimulate H2O2 emission in younger individuals,
pyruvate stimulated H2O2 emission in older individuals (Fig-
ure 2D), suggesting a greater contribution from either pyruvate
dehydrogenase or CI. Regardless, these data support recent
reports of unaltered mitochondrial respiration and ROS emission
capacities with aging (Kent-Braun and Ng, 2000; Larsen et al.,
2012). However, a major control point in bioenergetics is the
movement of ADP into the mitochondria, and therefore we
next analyzed the dynamic response of mitochondria to sub-
maximal ADP concentrations. Titrating ADP revealed the
expected Michaelis-Menten kinetic curve (Figure 3A, inset),
which was used to estimate the apparent sensitivity for ADP
to stimulate respiration (apparent Km). Although maximal respira-
tion was not different (Figure 2A), the apparent ADP Km
was �25% higher in older individuals (Figures 3A and 3B),
indicating an attenuation in ADP sensitivity. This is supported
by reduced absolute respiration, and attenuated stimulation of
respiration, in the presence of ADP concentrations, indicative
of resting muscle (Figure 3C). Older muscle also displayed a
rightward shift in the H2O2 curve in the presence of ADP
(Figure 3D), such that the apparent IC50 value for ADP to atten-
uate mitochondrial ROS emission was increased �8-fold with
aging (Figure 3E). This basic pattern was also apparent when
examining mitochondrial H2O2 emission rates in the presence
of ADP concentrations that correspond to resting free ADP
2838

 concentrations in muscle (Figure 3F), as absolute emission rates
were higher, while the decrease in ROS was lower, in the
presence of 25 and 175 mM ADP (Figure 3F). In addition, the frac-
tion of electron leak to H2O2 was unaltered with aging in the
absence of ADP, but it was higher with aging in the presence
of every ADP concentration examined (Figure 3G), which corre-
sponded to a higher concentration of ADP that was required to
decrease the fraction of electron leak to ROS by half (Figures
3H and 3I). Because ATP synthase content was not reduced (Fig-
ure 2E), we evaluated the expression of proteins involved in the
transport of ADP into mitochondria, a process that requires
ANT (inner mitochondrial membrane) and voltage-dependent
anion channel (VDAC; outer mitochondrial membrane), and
augmented by mitochondrial creatine kinase (mi-CK). Although
ANT isoforms and mi-CK content were not different between
age groups, VDAC was reduced in older muscle (Figures 3J
and 3K), which may contribute to the observed attenuation in
ADP sensitivity. Altogether, these data highlight that although
maximal mitochondrial respiration and ROS emission rates are
not altered with aging, the sensitivity to ADP is dramatically
impaired, resulting in an increase in ROS emission in the
presence
of
submaximal
ADP
concentrations.
Given
the
disparity between the observed maximal and submaximal ROS
rates, we evaluated markers of cellular oxidative stress. Specif-
ically, we determined the glutathione (GSH) and glutathione di-
sulfide (GSSG) as well as 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) protein
adduct content within the skeletal muscle of young and old indi-
viduals. Although GSH and GSSG were increased with aging, the
ratio of GSH to GSSG was reduced with aging (Figure 4A), sug-
gesting the induction of oxidative stress in vivo. In support of this,
4HNE protein adduct content was also increased in older individ-
uals (Figure 4B). These responses were not associated with re-
ductions in the content of antioxidant enzymes (Figure 4C). Alto-
gether, these data indicate oxidative stress occurs with aging,
supporting the current in vitro assessments of mitochondrial
ROS in the presence of ADP.

 ADP (Ludzki et al., 2015). Alternatively, resistance exercise
training increases muscle mass, glucose tolerance, and func-
tional capacity and is therefore an effective strategy to combat
the aging process. We therefore used a 12-week resistance-
type exercise training program in different older individuals to
establish the influence on mitochondrial ADP sensitivity. Resis-
tance training increased (p < 0.05) lean mass (+1.5 ± 0.3 kg),
appendicular lean mass (+1.1 ± 0.2 kg), and leg strength
(+18 ± 5 kg) and increased (p = 0.05) the relative proportion of
type II fibers (Table 1; Figure 5A). In addition, exercise training
increased maximal state III respiration (Figure 5B) and succi-
nate-supported H2O2 emission (p = 0.06; Figure 5C), decreased
theabilityofpyruvatetostimulateROSemissionrates(Figure5C),
and tended (p < 0.10) to increase OXPHOS protein content (Fig-
ure 5D). Markers of mitochondrial ADP sensitivity were similar
between our two cohorts of aged individuals (e.g., IC50
values �150 mM ADP), suggesting a consistent response with
aging. Resistance-type exercise training also improved various
indices of mitochondrial ADP sensitivity, as the apparent Km (Fig-
ure 5E and inset), respiration with submaximal ADP concentra-
tions (Figure 5F), and IC50 to attenuate ROS emission (Figures
5G and 5H) were all improved. However, despite the improve-
ment in ADP sensitivity, and the greater attenuation of ROS in
the presence of ADP (Figure 5I), absolute mitochondrial H2O2
emission rates were similar in the presence of 25 and 175 mM
ADP (Figure 5I) as a result of the apparent greater maximal capac-
ity after training. In addition, exercise training did not alter the ef-
ficiency of the ETC, as the fraction of electron leak to ROS was not
altered at any ADP concentration examined (Figures 5J and 5K).
When examining the abundance of ADP transport proteins,
despite the improvement in ADP sensitivity after resistance
training, VDAC and ANT protein contents were not altered (Fig-
ures 5L and 5M), suggesting a change in these proteins is not
required for ADP sensitivity to be improved.
Given the disparity between maximal and submaximal mito-
chondrial ROS emission rates, similar to the comparison
between young and old individuals, we examined markers of
redox stress. Despite the strong trend for an increase in maximal
succinate-supported ROS (Figure 5C), the ratio of GSH to GSSG
(Figure S1A), and 4HNE protein adduct content (Figure S1B)
were not altered with exercise training, while superoxide dismut-
ase 2 (SOD2) increased (Figure S1C). Once again these markers
of in vivo redox stress better align with the unaltered ROS in the
presence of ADP than with the capacity to produce ROS. This
relationship is also highlighted by collapsing all of the current
data: whereas maximal ROS is not altered with aging (Figure 6A),
ROS in the presence of ADP is consistently higher (Figure 6B),
regardless of training status, which corresponds with a lower
GSH/GSSG ratio (Figure 6C).
DISCUSSION
The present data establish that although maximal mitochondrial
respiration and H2O2 are not altered with aging, mitochondrial
bioenergetics in the presence of non-saturating ADP concentra-
tions are dramatically impaired in skeletal muscle tissue of older
individuals. Specifically, we provide evidence that because of a
reduction in mitochondrial ADP sensitivity, aging is associated
with (1) a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, (2) an increase
in mitochondrial ROS emission, (3) a greater fraction of electron
leak to ROS, and subsequently (4) oxidative stress. Moreover,
we show that although resistance-exercise training (5) increased
the capacity for mitochondrial bioenergetics (respiration and
ROS),
(6)
mitochondrial
ADP
sensitivity
was
improved
(decreased Km and IC50), and as a result (7) mitochondrial
H2O2 emission and the fraction of electron leak to ROS were
not altered in the presence of ADP, and therefore (8) the oxidative
state of the muscle was not affected by resistance training.

 Altogether, these data highlight in humans that there is an age-
related increase in mitochondrial H2O2 emission that appears
to be resistant to improvements following 12 weeks of resis-
tance-exercise training and likely contributes to the greater
oxidative stress that occurs in senescent muscle.
Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial H2O2 Emission Is
Increased with Aging
The notion that increased mitochondrial ROS emission contrib-
utes to aging in humans remains a current topic of scientific
debate (Cartee et al., 2016) as in vitro assessments of mitochon-
drial ROS emission in humans are unaltered with aging (Capel
et al., 2005; Distefano et al., 2017; Gouspillou et al., 2014). In
the present study, although we report unaltered maximal mito-
chondrial H2O2 emission rates with aging (Capel et al., 2005;
Distefano et al., 2017; Gouspillou et al., 2014; Robinson et al.,
2017), we provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial ROS
emission is increased with aging when the in vitro environment
better matches in vivo resting muscle. Specifically, by titrating
ADP in the presence of mixed substrates, we were able to reveal
an impairment in the ability of ADP to reduce ROS emission in
older individuals. Although largely unstudied, ADP sensitivity
represents a major control point in metabolic homeostasis, as
the transport of ADP into mitochondria, and the subsequent
binding of ADP to F1F0 ATP synthase, decreases membrane
potential and the overall rate of superoxide production (Born-
ho
¨ vd et al., 2006), while stimulating aerobic metabolism. The
present data strongly suggest that alterations in ANT or ATP
synthase content do not contribute to the impairment in ADP
sensitivity with aging or improvement with resistance training.

 Recent literature has revealed in diverse models that ADP sensi-
tivity is highly regulated, as acute and chronic aerobic exercise
training (Ludzki et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2012), reactive lipids
(Ludzki et al., 2015), and diabetic rats (Smith et al., 2013) have
all displayed altered mitochondrial responses to submaximal
ADP. Clearly the mechanisms regulating ADP sensitivity need
to be delineated given the diverse implications to metabolic
homeostasis.
In addition to the observed attenuated ADP sensitivity contrib-
uting to redox stress with aging, older individuals also displayed
an ability for pyruvate/malate to stimulate mitochondrial H2O2
emission, suggesting either a greater contribution from pyruvate
dehydrogenase or an increase in superoxide production from the
FMN site on CI. Numerous studies have demonstrated that
pyruvate dehydrogenase content and activity either remain
stable or decline throughout the lifespan (Gurd et al., 2008; Ras-
mussen et al., 2003), while in the present study, a marker of CI
content was unaltered with aging, suggesting that the greater
drive on ROS emission with pyruvate/malate in the older individ-
uals might be caused by impaired CI function (Picard et al.,
2010). In support, it has been previously suggested that an overly
reduced FMN site on CI may be the prevailing source of ROS
emission (Brand, 2010), particularly because CI is susceptible
to cysteine modifications (Staunton et al., 2011). Further to
this, one study in humans (Short et al., 2005), and various rodent
models of aging (Desai et al., 1996; Kumaran et al., 2004;

 Mansouri et al., 2006; Picard et al., 2010), have reported dra-
matic declines in CI activity later in the lifespan, while caloric
restriction, which has been well defined to prolong mammalian
lifespan by 30%–50%, has also been shown to reduce CI ROS
emission in rodent heart tissue (Gredilla et al., 2001). The topol-
ogy of ROS production with aging remains to be fully delineated,
but the stimulatory effect of pyruvate with aging, combined
with the attenuated response to ADP, likely contributes to the
observed oxidative stress in older individuals.
Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Respiration Is Decreased
with Aging
Aging was originally believed to be associated with decreased
mitochondrial respiratory capacity, as various markers of mito-
chondrial content are reduced in older individuals. However,
contemporary research has shown that maximal mitochondrial
respiration is not altered with aging (Capel et al., 2005; Distefano
et al., 2017; Gouspillou et al., 2014), suggesting that a reduction
in respiratory capacity is not a primary cause of the aging
process. In the present study, we support these findings, as
there were trends for OXPHOS content to be reduced, while
we did not observe age-related alterations in leak respiration
or respiration in the presence of saturating ADP concentrations
(maximal respiration). These data are in stark contrast to in vivo
reports of mitochondrial function using 31P-magnetic resonance
spectroscopy
(MRS),
which
have
consistently
suggested
impaired mitochondrial function with aging in resting (Fleisch-
man et al., 2010) and contracting muscle (Choi et al., 2016). In
the present study, respiration was lower in the presence of
non-saturating ADP concentrations with aging, and the apparent
sensitivity of mitochondria for ADP to stimulate respiration was
decreased (apparent Km increased �25%). These data highlight
that mitochondrial bioenergetics are impaired in the presence of
non-saturating ADP in older individuals and likely contributes to
the observed impairment in mitochondrial function with aging as
assessed by 31P-MRS (Choi et al., 2016; Fleischman et al., 2010).

Recent studies have suggested that mild
mitochondrial uncoupling, proposed to
occur because of ROS-induced damage
to the inner mitochondrial membrane
leading to H+ leak (Amara et al., 2007;
Harper et al., 2004; Marcinek et al.,
2005; Porter et al., 2015a), greatly contrib-
utes to age-related deficits in mitochon-
drial ROS (Brand et al., 2004) and/or res-
piratory (Amara et al., 2007; Marcinek et al., 2005; Porter et al.,
2015a) capacity. In the present study, however, despite the
increase in ROS emission rates, reduction in GSH/GSSG ratio,
and increase in 4HNE protein adduct content, we did not
observe age-related alterations in leak respiration or RCR, sug-
gesting the absence of an age-related deficit in mitochondrial
coupling. Moreover, uncoupling would be expected to decrease
the fraction of electron leak to H2O2, but this was not altered with
aging in the absence of ADP and actually increased in the
presence of ADP with aging. These data appear to align better
with recent work demonstrating the absence of age-related un-
coupling when controlling for body fat percentage and physical
activity between old and young individuals (Kent-Braun and
Ng, 2000; Larsen et al., 2012).
Resistance Exercise Training Does Not Fully Recover
Mitochondrial Bioenergetics with Aging
Physical activity profoundly affects the capacity of mitochon-
drial ROS emission and respiration (Gouspillou et al., 2014;
Gram et al., 2015; Porter et al., 2015b). Resistance exercise
training has also been well established as a particularly effec-
tive strategy to increase muscle mass, strength, and metabolic
function in older individuals (Leenders et al., 2013a; Porter
et al., 2015b). In the present study, ten different older individ-
uals completed 12 weeks of resistance training, which resulted
in increased lean body mass and leg extension one-repetition
maximal strength along with a concomitant reduction in body
fat percentage.
In
addition, resistance
training increased
maximal mitochondrial respiration and ROS emission and
strongly tended to increase OXPHOS content, all indicative of
exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Resistance training
has also been shown to increase mtDNA content in young and
old individuals, while not altering respiratory function in isolated
mitochondria (Robinson et al., 2017), further suggesting the in-
crease in respiration observed in the present study using per-
meabilized muscle fibers reflects the induction of mitochondrial

Although aging was associated with a reduction in ADP sensi-
tivity, exercise training increased the ability of submaximal ADP
concentrations to stimulate respiration and attenuate ROS emis-
sion. In an attempt to explain these findings we examined the
content of proteins required for ADP transport across the mito-
chondrial membrane. However, the expression of these proteins
did not align with the observed bioenergetic alterations, as the
content of ANT isoforms did not change with any condition,
and although VDAC was reduced with aging, training did not alter
the content of this protein despite improving ADP sensitivity. In
contrast, the observed changes in ADP sensitivity with aging
and following prolonged resistance training aligned with the
relative proportion of type I fibers. These data raise the possibility
that the observed changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics are
influenced in a fiber-specific manner. Interestingly, in rats, the
red portion of skeletal muscles, which have a higher proportion
of type I fibers, display greater mitochondrial H2O2 emission
potential within the matrix and lower mitochondrial ADP sensi-
tivity (Anderson and Neufer, 2006; Zoll et al., 2003), suggesting
mitochondrial ROS may impair ADP sensitivity, creating a vicious
cycle. It is therefore possible that redox-induced inhibition of
ANT is an explanation for the observed changes in the present
study, as there is also indirect evidence to suggest that ANT is
impaired through redox modifications with aging in housefly
and rat skeletal muscle (Queiroga et al., 2010; Yan and Sohal,
1998), and ANT has three known cysteine sites located on the

 matrix-facing surface that can influence ADP transport (McStay
et al., 2002). In further support of this, resistance training
increased the content of SOD2, a matrix localized antioxidant
in association with reducing the apparent Km and IC50 for ADP.
However, because exercise training also increased the capacity
for mitochondrial H2O2, the improvement in ADP sensitivity did
not attenuate H2O2 emission in the presence of sub-saturating
ADP concentrations. These data suggest that the in vivo oxida-
tive state of the muscle was not affected by training, an interpre-
tation supported by the observed unaltered GSH/GSSG ratios
and 4HNE protein adduct content following training. In addition,
exercise training did not improve the apparent ETC efficiency, as
the fraction of electron leak to H2O2 was unchanged across a
range of biologically relevant ADP concentrations. Therefore,
although resistance training improved muscle strength and
mitochondrial ADP sensitivity in older individuals, H2O2 emission
in the presence of sub-saturating ADP concentrations was not
altered, and therefore the oxidative state of the skeletal muscle
was not improved. These data imply that the rate of H2O2 emis-
sion from mitochondria is consistently higher in older individuals,
regardless of resistance training status. However, future work
should elucidate the ability of aerobic and high-intensity interval
training to improve ADP sensitivity and redox balance in aged
muscle, as these forms of training regimes have been shown
to rectify many age-associated mitochondrial abnormalities
(Gram et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2017), and high-intensity
interval training has been shown to dramatically improve mito-
chondrial ADP sensitivity in young healthy individuals (Ydfors
et al., 2016).
Conclusions
Altogether, the assessment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the
presence of sub-saturating ADP concentrations has revealed
that there are age-associated impairments in mitochondrial
bioenergetics, which are not fully recovered with prolonged
resistance-type exercise training. The mechanism for the
attenuation in ADP sensitivity remains unknown, but oxidative
damage has been proposed as a likely explanation (Feng et al.,
2008; Yan and Sohal, 2000). Regardless of this knowledge
gap, the present data imply that an increase in mitochondrial
ROS is associated with the primary aging process. Moreover,
despite the inability of resistance training to rectify age-related
mitochondrial ROS emission, older individuals experienced
favorable changes in muscle mass, strength, and fat mass,
reinforcing the importance of a physically active lifestyle
throughout the lifespan.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
Ten healthy, young men (26 ± 2 years, 71.6 ± 3.1 kg, 22.6 ± 0.8 kg/m2) and ten
healthy older men (70 ± 1 years, 76.4 ± 1.6 kg, 25.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2) were included
in the cross-sectional, aging comparison of this study. Ten older men (70 ± 1
years, 78.8 ± 2.5 kg, 25.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2) participated in the 12-week progressive
resistance exercise training program. Subject characteristics of the study par-
ticipants are presented in Table 1. All muscle biopsies were performed in an
overnight fasted and rested state between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Experimental
procedures were approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Maas-
tricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands, and conformed to standards
for the use of human subjects in research as outlined in the most recent version
of the Helsinki Declaration.
Pretesting and Study Design
All participants were screened for medical issues and excluded if any chronic
diseases were present before inclusion. Anthropometric measurements,
maximal strength assessment, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
scans, and muscle biopsy and blood samples were collected as previously
reported (Leenders et al., 2013a; Snijders et al., 2015). Supervised resis-
tance-type exercise training was performed three times per week for a
12-week period, consisting of three or four sets (eight to ten repetitions per
set) of leg press and leg extension, in addition to upper body exercises. The
workload was progressively increased throughout the program to maintain
80% one-repetition maximum (1RM). All training sessions were performed in
the morning between 8:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. On average, subjects attended
96% ± 4% of the scheduled exercise sessions.
Mitochondrial Bioenergetics
Skeletal muscle was separated under a microscope into bundles using fine-
tipped forceps, treated with 30 mg/mL saponin for 30 min at 4�C, and then
washed for 15 min in buffer Z (105 mM K-Mes, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA,
10 mM K2HPO4, 5 mM MgCl2$H2O, 0.005 mM pyruvate, 0.002 mM malate
with 5 mg/mL fatty acid-free BSA [pH 7.4]), as previously described (Herbst
et al., 2014). We have previously used exogenous hexokinase to create an
‘‘ADP clamp’’ within our system and reported the absence of an effect on
mitochondrial ADP sensitivity (Perry et al., 2012; depicted in Figure S2). We
therefore do not believe that alterations within ‘‘non-mitochondrial’’ sources
of ADP utilization affect our current interpretations. Therefore, O2 consumption

 and H2O2 emission were determined in buffer Z supplemented with 20 mM
Amplex Red (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 5 U/mL horseradish peroxidase,
40 U/mL superoxide dismutase, and 25 mM blebbistatin, using an Oxygraph-2
K with a fluorometry modular attachment (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck,
Austria). Experiments were conducted at 37�C and commenced with mild hy-
per-oxygenation to prevent re-oxygenation during an experiment (250 mM O2),
in the presence of various substrates, including 10 mM cytochrome c to ensure
outer mitochondrial membrane integrity. The rate of H2O2 emission was calcu-
lated from a standard curve established with the same reaction conditions
using the DatLab software (Oroboros Instruments) after subtracting the fiber
background. All fibers were weighed in buffer Z before the start of an experi-
ment to normalize respiration to muscle bundle weight.
Immunohistochemistry
From the pre- and post-training muscle biopsy samples, 5-mm-thick cryosec-
tions were cut at 220�C. Samples collected from each subject before and after
the 12-week training intervention were mounted together on uncoated glass
slides. Muscle biopsy specimens were stained for DAPI, myosin heavy chain 1
(MHC-I), and laminin to assess muscle fiber typing, as described in detail pre-
viously (Leenders et al., 2013b; Verdijk et al., 2009). No differences in fiber
circularity were observed in response to training or between groups.
Western Blotting
Permeabilized muscle fiber bundles were recovered from the Oroboros sys-
tem and used for western blotting, as previously described (Herbst et al.,
2014). All samples for each protein were loaded on the same membrane to limit
variation, and ponceau staining was used to verify constant loading.
GSH/GSSG Ratio
A small (30–50 mg) portion of each muscle biopsy was homogenized on ice in a
1:10 w/v ratio with phenanthroline dissolved in 7% PCA to determine GSH and
GSSG content on a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (column:
Microsorb 100-5), as previously reported (Tupling et al., 2007). Final GSH and
GSSG muscle concentrations were determined by correcting for sample dilu-
tion that occurred throughout the preparation phases.
Statistical Analysis
The apparent Km and IC50 for ADP were determined using Michaelis-Menten
kinetics and one-phase exponential decay analysis, respectively (GraphPad
Software,La Jolla, CA, USA), as previously described (Miotto and Holloway,
2016; Perry et al., 2011). The first concentration of ADP (12.5 mM ADP) was
not used to estimate the apparent respiratory Km, as this concentration of
ADP did not stimulate respiration in the older individuals and therefore intro-
duced error in the kinetic curve fit. Maximal respiration (Vmax) was determined
as the highest respiratory value obtained. Statistical analyses were performed
using unpaired (young versus old) and paired (pre- versus post-training) sam-
ples t tests (two-tailed). In addition, a few select comparisons were made using
a one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post hoc
analyses. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance was determined
as p < 0.05.
