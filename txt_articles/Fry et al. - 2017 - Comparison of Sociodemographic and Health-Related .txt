The UK Biobank cohort is a population-based cohort of 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom (UK)
between 2006 and 2010. Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40–69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km)
of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5% partic-
ipated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by compar-
ing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle,
and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK
Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas
than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke,
and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70–74 years, rates of all-
cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2% and 11.8% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5% and
18.1% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representa-
tive of the sampling population; there is evidence of a “healthy volunteer” selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assess-
ment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be
representative of the population at large.

The UK Biobank Study is a large prospective cohort study, es-
tablished primarily to investigate the genetic and lifestyle determi-
nants of a wide range of diseases of middle and later life (1). This
open-access resource involves 500,000 United Kingdom (UK)
men and women who were aged 40–69 years when recruited
throughout England, Wales, and Scotland between 2006 and
2010. Extensive questionnaire data, physical measurements, and
biological samples were collected at recruitment, and there is
ongoing enhanced data collection in large subsets of the cohort,
including a repeat baseline assessment, genotyping, biochemical
assays, Web-based questionnaires, physical activity monitoring,
and multimodal imaging. All participants are followed up for
health conditions through linkage to national electronic health-
related data sets.
Our aim in the current study was to examine and quantify
whether the UK Biobank cohort differed from the sampling frame
with regard to a range of characteristics due to the “healthy volun-
teer effect” (2), whereby people who volunteer for research
studies tend to be, on average, more health-conscious than
nonparticipants (3). To investigate this, we compared the
distributions of a range of sociodemographic, physical, life-
style, and health-related characteristics between UK Biobank
participants and 1) persons invited to join UK Biobank and
2) respondents to nationally representative surveys.

 METHODS
UK Biobank investigators sent postal invitations to 9,238,453
individuals registered with the UK’s National Health Service
who were aged 40–69 years and lived within approximately
25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers located
throughout England, Wales, and Scotland. The National Infor-
mation Governance Board for Health and Social Care and the
North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee provided
approval for UK Biobank to obtain the contact details of people
within the eligible age range from local National Health Service
Primary Care Trusts. UK Biobank also received approval to
retain limited information on nonresponders. Overall, 503,317
participants consented to join the study cohort and visited an
assessment center between 2006 and 2010, resulting in a par-
ticipation rate of 5.45% (see Web Figure 1, available at https://
academic.oup.com/aje, for a flow chart demonstrating responses
to invitations).
Anonymized data on sex, month, and year of birth, Town-
send deprivation index (an indicator of socioeconomic sta-
tus), and geographic location are stored in the UK Biobank
resource and were available for 8,761,869 of the 9,238,453
(94.8%) individuals sent an invitation letter, allowing us to
compare the distributions of these characteristics between
nonparticipating invitees and participants. The distributions of
a range of sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-
related characteristics of the UK Biobank cohort were also
compared with publicly available summary data from nation-
ally representative population-based surveys and the UK Cen-
sus. We selected summary survey data that matched the UK
Biobank cohort as closely as possible with regard to population
demographic factors (i.e., both sexes and ages 40–69 years)
and the period of data collection (2006–2010). Where certain
characteristics from the national survey summary data were
only available in prespecified aggregated age and sex sub-
groups, UK Biobank data were stratified into similar groups
for comparative purposes. Formal statistical tests of the dif-
ference in characteristics between UK Biobank and national
data were not performed because of the lack of variance mea-
sures required to test for differences between means, such as
standard deviations, from the comparison populations.
The UK Census collects individual and household-level
demographic data every 10 years for the whole UK population.
Data on ethnicity were obtained from the 2001 and 2011 UK
Census for England, Wales, and Scotland, as these reflected the
census years falling before and immediately after the recruitment
period (4, 5). Data on property ownership status were obtained
from the 2001 UK Census for England and Wales only, since
2011 UK Census data on property ownership were not available
for the appropriate age groups. Data on anthropometric measures,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, and prevalences of self-
reported health conditions were obtained from the Health Survey
for England (HSE) for the years 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010
(6–9). The HSE consists of an annual cross-sectional survey of a
small (n = approximately 5,000–15,000), representative popula-
tion of England through a 2-stage random probability sampling
process, with information on different data items being collected
in a different population each year (10, 11). Since 2003, the HSE
has incorporated weighting to account for nonresponse bias (12).
This includes different weights for nonresponding households,
nonresponding individuals in responding households, and nonre-
sponse at different stages of data collection. For a detailed
description of the data collection methods used in UK Biobank
and national surveys, see Web Table 1.
Age- and sex-specific data on all-cause mortality and cancer
incidence rates for England were obtained from the Office for
National Statistics for 2012, as this date represented the mid-
point of the follow-up period for UK Biobank participants (13,
14). For all-cause mortality, follow-up time (person-years) in
the UK Biobank cohort was calculated as the period ranging
from age at recruitment to age at death or the date of complete
follow-up (November 30, 2015), whichever came first; for can-
cer incidence rates, follow-up time was defined as the period
ranging from age at recruitment to age at first cancer diagnosis,
death, or the date of complete follow-up (September 30, 2014),
whichever came first (among persons with no cancer at recruit-
ment, based on cancer registry data). Cancer incidence rates
were calculated for total cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin
cancer), defined using International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes C00–C97 (excluding code
C44), and common types—prostate (ICD-10 code C61), breast
(ICD-10 code C50), colorectal (ICD-10 codes C18–C20), lung
(ICD-10 codes C33–C34), endometrium (ICD-10 code C54),
and kidney (ICD-10 code C64).
The UK Biobank Study received approval from the National
Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care and
the National Health Service North West Multicentre Research
Ethics Committee.
RESULTS
Characteristics of UK Biobank participants versus
nonparticipating invitees
Of the 9,238,453 men and women invited to join UK Bio-
bank, 503,317 (5.45%) consented and were recruited between
2006 and 2010. Overall, the participation rate was higher in
women (participation rates were 6.4% and 5.1% in women
and men, respectively) (Figure 1A), in older age groups (9%
in those aged ≥60 years and 3% in those aged 40–44 years)
(Figure 1B), and in less socioeconomically deprived areas
(8.3% among persons from the least deprived areas and 3.1%
among persons from the most deprived areas) (Figure 1C).
Participation rates showed regional differences, being high-
est in South West England (9.6%) and East Scotland (8.2%)
and lowest in West Scotland (4.3%), London, the West Mid-
lands, and North West England (all 4.7%) (Figure 1D; also
see Web Table 2 for further details).
Characteristics of UK Biobank participants compared
with national survey data
Sociodemographic factors.
In the UK Biobank cohort,
94.6% of participants were of white ethnicity, which was
similar to the national population of the same age range in
the 2001 UK Census (94.5%) but somewhat higher than in
the 2011 Census (91.3%; Table 1). UK Biobank participants
were also more likely to own their property outright and were
less likely to have a mortgage or loan, to share ownership, or to

 live in rental accommodations than the general population of
the same age range (Table 2).
Physical characteristics.
UK Biobank participants were,
on average, taller and leaner and had a smaller waist circumfer-
ence than the general population, based on the HSE 2008
(Table 3). For example, mean body mass index (defined as
weight (kg)/height (m)2) in UK Biobank men and women aged
55–64 years was 27.9 and 27.3, respectively, as compared with
28.5 and 28.0 in the general population, based on data from the
HSE 2008. UK Biobank men and women were also less likely
to be obese (defined as body mass index ≥30) across all age
groups examined in comparison with the general population.
For example, for men aged 45–54 years, the prevalence of
obesity was 25.6% in UK Biobank and 31.5% in the general
population, with corresponding values of 23.0% and 32.2%,
respectively, for women (Web Table 3).
Lifestyle characteristics.
UK Biobank men and women
were less likely to be current smokers than the general popula-
tion across all age groups, based on data from the HSE 2008
(Figure 2). For example, for men aged 45–54 years, the preva-
lence of current smoking was 15% in UK Biobank and 22% in
the general population; the corresponding values for women
were 11% and 20%, respectively. However, younger smokers
(aged 45–54 years) in UK Biobank smoked more heavily
(≥20 cigarettes/day) than those in the general population (46%
and 41%, respectively, for men; 32% and 28%, respectively, for
women). This difference persisted for older women aged 55–64
years (31% and 23% in UK Biobank and the general popula-
tion, respectively) but not for older men (47% and 49%, respec-
tively; Web Figure 2). UK Biobank participants were also less
likely to be never drinkers but were less likely to drink alcohol
every day than the general population included in the HSE 2008
(Table 4).
Self-reported health conditions.
UK Biobank partici-
pants had a lower prevalence of self-reported health condi-
tions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension,
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and respiratory disease,
than the general population, as obtained from various HSEs
performed in 2006, 2009, and 2010 (Table 5). For example,
among men aged 45–54 years, the prevalence of self-reported
cardiovascular disease was 4.6% in UK Biobank partici-
pants and 10.9% in the general population, and among
women aged 45–54 years the prevalences were 2.4% and
10.3%, respectively.

 (standard deviation, 1.01) years and 5.53 (standard devia-
tion, 1.10) years for all-cause mortality and incident cancer, respec-
tively. Compared with national death rates among persons aged
70–74 years, all-cause mortality in UK Biobank participants was
46.2% lower in men and 55.5% lower in women (Figure 3A and
3B; also see Web Table 4 for further details of age-specific mortal-
ity rates). The total cancer incidence rate was also lower than in
the general population, being 11.8% and 18.1% lower at ages
70–74 years in men and women, respectively (Figure 4A and 4B;
also see Web Table 5 for further details of age-specific cancer inci-
dence rates). A similar pattern was observed for cancers of the co-
lorectum, kidney, and endometrium (Web Figure 3). Lung cancer
incidence rates in UK Biobank were markedly lower for both men
and women, while rates of female breast cancer were similar to the
national average, with the exception of women aged 45–49 years,
in whom the rate was higher in the UK Biobank cohort. In con-
trast, prostate cancer incidence was higher in UK Biobank com-
pared with national rates across all age groups examined.

 DISCUSSION
The rate of participation in the UK Biobank Study was high-
er among women, older age groups, and persons living in less
socioeconomically deprived areas. UK Biobank participants
also differed with regard to several lifestyle and health-related
characteristics when compared with the general population of

 the same age. For example, men aged 45–54 years were less
likely to be obese (25.6% in UK Biobank vs. 31.5% in the gen-
eral population) and less likely to be current smokers (15% vs.
22%), with similar findings being observed for women and old-
er age groups. Furthermore, compared with the general popula-
tion, UK Biobank participants were less likely to drink alcohol
on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions.
Linkage of UK Biobank participants with their health records
during an average of 6–7 years of follow-up also showed lower
rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence than in
the general population of the same age.
These findings are consistent with the well-established
“healthy volunteer” effect, which has been demonstrated
in other volunteer-based cohort studies (15–17). Other
prospective studies have also found lower rates of all-cause
mortality and incident cancer in comparison with national rates
(18–21). The only examined health condition that had a higher
incidence rate in UK Biobank than in the general population
was prostate cancer, which might reflect higher rates of voluntary
prostate-specific antigen testing (and subsequent prostate cancer
diagnosis) among health-conscious men. In contrast, lung cancer
incidence rates were markedly lower in UK Biobank across all
age and sex groups, almost certainly caused by the lower preva-
lence of smoking compared with the general population.
Because UK Biobank participants are, on average, more
health-conscious than the general population, this cohort is

 not the best for estimation of generalizable prevalence or
incidence rates of disease (although some health-related
characteristics of the UK Biobank cohort, such as the preva-
lence of self-reported pain, have previously been shown to
be similar to those of the national population (22)). In order
for a cohort study to produce generalizable associations of
exposures with disease, it is important that sufficiently large
numbers of individuals with different levels of exposures be
investigated with high internal validity (23–26). Indeed, if one
were interested in investigating the association of ethnicity with
subsequent disease risk, the most appropriate study design
would be to recruit a large number of people from different eth-
nic backgrounds rather than have a representative, largely white
population. Because UK Biobank is primarily designed for
investigating exposure-disease associations, the lack of repre-
sentativeness should not be regarded as a limitation (27, 28). As
with all observational studies, it is incumbent upon researchers
to acknowledge potential sources of bias that might affect the
generalizability of exposure-disease associations on a case-by-
case basis, such as residual confounding, reverse causation, and
self-selection bias (24, 29). Although the UK Biobank Study is
still in the early stages as a prospective study, initial publications
have shown expected associations of cardiometabolic morbidity,
self-reported health, and smoking with mortality risk (30, 31).
This study provides an overview of the representativeness of
the UK Biobank cohort with regard to a variety of key character-
istics in comparison with the general UK population using data
from nationally representative surveys. We expect that these
findings will be used by researchers to inform the interpretation
of results or, in some instances, to help generate weighted results
(e.g., in order to estimate nationally representative disease rates).
We were able to compare participation rates for key sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (such as age, sex, socioeconomic status,
and geographic location) due to the availability of such data for
the total sampling frame. The availability of follow-up health
data enabled us to compare death and cancer incidence rates
with age- and sex-specific national rates, and the large size of the
cohort meant that sufficient numbers of cases had accrued to
investigate common cancer types. All UK Biobank participants
are flagged by national death and cancer registries, and loss to
follow-up due to emigration has been minimal (0.3% of the
cohort). Further follow-up is required to determine whether this
“healthy volunteer effect” attenuates over time (owing to the
development of chronic disease as the cohort ages), a phenome-
non which has been observed in previous studies (18, 20, 32).
One limitation of our study is that the national survey data
(available from the UK Census and the HSE) were presented in
prespecified age groups, thereby restricting the comparisons that
could be performed. For the majority of characteristics, com-
parable national survey data were available only for England,
although only 11% of participants were recruited in Wales and
Scotland and the distributions of most characteristics were similar
across the 3 countries. It is also possible that differences in the
wording of questions, answer choices, and data collection meth-
ods might have influenced the comparability of certain character-
istics between the national surveys and the UK Biobank cohort.
For example, the HSE consisted primarily of a verbal interview
that enabled the interviewer to probe the participant for further
information, whereas data on all of the characteristics of UK Bio-
bank participants presented here were collected via a touchscreen
questionnaire, with the exception of information on self-reported
health conditions, which was collected through a verbal interview
with a trained nurse.
In conclusion, the UK Biobank cohort is not representative of
the general population with regard to a number of sociodemo-
graphic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics. UK
Biobank participants generally live in less socioeconomically
deprived areas; are less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink
alcohol on a daily basis; and have fewer self-reported health con-
ditions. All-cause mortality is approximately half that of the UK
population as a whole, and total cancer incidence rates are approx-
imately 10%–20% lower. Although UK Biobank is not suitable
for deriving generalizable disease prevalence and incidence rates,
its large size and heterogeneity of exposure measures pro-
vide valid scientific inferences of associations between exposures
and health conditions that are generalizable to other populations.
