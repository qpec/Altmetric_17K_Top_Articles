BACKGROUND: Extreme cold and heat have been linked to an increased risk of occupational injuries. However, the evidence is still limited to a small
number of studies of people with relatively few injuries and with a limited geographic extent, and the corresponding economic effect has not been
studied in detail.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the relationship between ambient temperatures and occupational injuries in Spain along with its economic effect.
METHODS: The daily number of occupational injuries that caused at least one day of leave and the daily maximum temperature were obtained for
each Spanish province for the years 1994–2013. We estimated temperature–injuries associations with distributed lag nonlinear models, and then
pooled the results using a multivariate meta-regression model. We calculated the number of injuries attributable to cold and heat, the corresponding
workdays lost, and the resulting economic effect.
RESULTS: The study included 15,992,310 occupational injuries. Overall, 2.72% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.44–2.97] of all occupational injuries
were attributed to nonoptimal ambient temperatures, with moderate heat accounting for the highest fraction. This finding corresponds to an estimated
0.67 million (95% CI: 0.60–0.73) person-days of work lost every year in Spain due to temperature, or an annual average of 42 d per 1,000 workers.
The estimated annual economic burden is e370 million, or 0.03% of Spain’s GDP (e2,015).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that extreme ambient temperatures increased the risk of occupational injuries, with substantial estimated health
and economic costs. These results call for public health interventions to protect workers in the context of climate change. https://doi.org/10.1289/

Introduction
The health effects of temperatures have been extensively stud-
ied, particularly regarding mortality and morbidity (Basu 2009;
Gasparrini et al. 2015b). A study conducted in 13 countries esti-
mated that 7.29% of total mortality can be attributable to cold tem-
peratures and 0.42% to heat (Gasparrini et al. 2015b). So far, the
majority of the studies have considered counts of deaths, hospital-
izations, or emergency visits as a health indicator.
Extreme ambient heat has important consequences also in the
occupational sector, with some studies reporting important losses
in work capacity and productivity linked to climate warming, with
associated costs amounting to between 0.1% and 0.5% of GDP
(Kjellstrom et al. 2016; Zander et al. 2015; Dunne et al. 2013;
Hübler et al. 2008). Extreme heat, however, can have additional
consequences in the occupational sector, for example, through
increasing the risk of suffering occupational injuries. Some studies
have suggested this link, also applicable to cold temperatures, but
the evidence is still limited to a small number of studies with partic-
ipants who experienced relatively few injuries and with a limited
geographic extent (Bonafede et al. 2016). Large new studies are
needed to confirm these results and calculate the potentially sub-
stantial associated burden on society. The costs associated with
injuries attributable to cold and heat have not been accounted for in
previous economic assessments of the potential impact of climate
change in the occupational sector.
Several mechanisms are thought to underlie the link between
ambient temperatures and risk of injury in the workplace. Exposure
to high temperatures can lead to physiological and psychological
changes associated with heat strain, which in turn can decrease
workers’ performance and lead to impaired concentration, increased
distractibility, and fatigue (Kjellstrom et al. 2016). These factors
increase the risk of occupational injuries. Similarly, factors related
to working in cold environments, such as thermal discomfort, hypo-
thermia, or reduced mobility while wearing protective clothing are
associated with decreased dexterity and performance among work-
ers, which can also trigger occupational injuries (Schulte and Chun
2009; Mäkinen and Hassi 2009; Rodahl 2003).
Current projections estimate an increase in worldwide surface
temperature due to climate change (IPCC 2014). In its last assess-
ment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) highlights that heat waves will increase in frequency, inten-
sity, and duration (IPCC 2014). Increases in temperatures may
vary in different regions. Indeed, in some parts of the world, it is
expected to be unsafe to work outside during some months of the
year (Kjellstrom et al. 2016). This might be particularly critical in
the Mediterranean region, where projections indicate summer
warming of between 0.6°C and 1.5°C by 2050 (IPCC 2014). Even
though ambient temperature is expected to increase in the upcom-
ing decades, low temperature extremes (cold spells and frost days)
will continue to happen (IPCC 2014), but less frequently.

Research
 Despite their potential importance, so far neither the propor-
tion of work injuries nor the number of lost working days attrib-
utable to ambient temperatures has been quantified. Therefore,
we conducted a countrywide study in Spain to examine the rela-
tionship between ambient temperatures and occupational injuries,
its variation according to workers’ characteristics, and its associ-
ated economic costs.
Methods
Setting
This study was carried out in Spain, a country with a population of
46.5 million living in 50 provinces (excluding Ceuta and Melilla in
North Africa). The predominant climate in Spain is Mediterranean,
with dry, hot summers and winters with balanced temperatures and
low rainfall. Other climates include oceanic (northwest), arid, and
semi-arid (southwest), subtropical (Canary Islands), and continen-
tal climate (mountain ranges). The study period covered 20 y from
1994 to 2013.
Occupational Injuries
We collected daily data on occupational injuries that occurred dur-
ing the study period and that resulted in at least one day of sick leave.
Data were obtained from the Spanish National System provided by
the Spanish Labour Administration. It is mandatory for companies
to register all occupational injuries from formal employment to this
registry. We excluded relapses and injuries that occurred during
commuting, and we did include all injuries regardless of their sever-
ity (whether fatal or not). This registry provides data on sex, age,
nationality (since 2003), type of contract, company’s economic sec-
tor, type of injury, duration of sick leave, and worker’s occupational
class (according to the National Classification of Occupations, ver-
sions 1994 and 2011). We selected specific economic sectors for
investigation based on previous research (Xiang et al. 2014a;
Adam-Poupart et al. 2015). It was not possible to separate occupa-
tional injuries according to indoor and outdoor activities due to the
lack of the typology of work carried out by workers.
Weather Data
Data on daily maximum and minimum temperature were obtained
for each provincial capital from the European Climate Assessment
& Dataset (European Climate Assessment & Dataset 2016).
Temperature data of one single weather station were assigned to
all occupational injuries that occurred in each municipality of the
province. Missing values (0.01% of the data) were imputed con-
sidering: 1) the mean temperature registered on the day after and
before the missing day, if only one value was omitted; or 2) the
temperature registered in the most correlated station for the same
day-month-year, if more than two consecutive days were miss-
ing. Our main results did not change if missing values were
excluded (data not shown).
Economic Data
Our economic analyses were based on a previous study on the costs
of occupational injuries in the Catalonia region of Spain (Abiuso
and Serra 2008). That study provided estimates of the costs of
occupational injuries in 2006 and 2007, and it divided them accord-
ing to a) costs associated with maintaining production (including
overtime payments and costs of replacement and training), b) long-
term lost incomes (total income lost when a worker suffers an
injury and cannot come back to work), c) health costs associated
with costs of treatment and rehabilitation, and d) costs of pain and
suffering (level of disability). The last category uses estimates of
the value of a human life based on Riera et al. (2007), and a disabil-
ity index based on Mathers et al. (2001).
Statistical Analysis
We used distributed lag nonlinear models to model the associa-
tion between daily temperature and the daily number of occupa-
tional injuries. This methodology has been described previously
(Gasparrini 2014). Briefly, these models allow us to describe
complex nonlinear relationships and lagged dependencies by
combining two functions describing the exposure–response asso-
ciation and the lag–response relationship. In the first stage of the
analysis, we fitted a separate time series quasi-Poisson regression
model for each province to estimate the specific temperature-
injury association, reported as percent difference. The exposure–
response association was modeled using a quadratic B-spline with
one internal knot placed at the 50th percentile. We extended the lag
period to up to 4 d using unconstrained distributed lags to include
possible long delays in the effects of temperature. We used sensitiv-
ity analyses to test these modeling choices (Supplemental Material,
Table S3). To control for seasonality and long-term trends, we
included in the generalized linear model a natural cubic B-spline of
time with eight degrees of freedom per year, an indicator of day of
the week, holidays, month, and the number of workers registered
in the social security system (included as an offset term). The results
of this stage were cumulated over all lags to obtain the overall
temperature–injuries association. Figures describing the results for
this stage were constructed on a relative scale (Gasparrini et al.
2012), and they can be interpreted as the cumulative risk of having
an occupational injury up to four days after the exposure for each
degree Celsius increase in maximum temperature.
In the second stage of the analysis, we pooled the estimated
location-specific associations using a multivariate meta-regression
model. The pooled curve was used to define the temperature per-
centile of minimum occupational injuries (PMOI). We then sum-
marized the results of the overall curve by computing the relative
risk at the first and 99th percentiles using the PMOI as the reference,
reported as extreme cold and extreme heat effects, respectively.
The results were reported as percent differences.
All analyses were stratified by sex, age, nationality, type of con-
tract, economic sector, type of injury, duration of sick leave, and
worker’s occupational class. Differences between groups were
tested using multivariate Wald tests (Gasparrini et al. 2015a). To
test the effect of changes in workplace regulations, we also strati-
fied the analysis in two periods. To do so, we considered the year
2000 as the cutoff point due to the implementation of occupational
injury prevention programs. As some studies reported a significant
decrease in occupational injury rates after the implementation of
these plans (Benavides et al. 2009), the two periods considered
were 1994–2000 and 2001–2013.
To calculate the attributable measures (number and percentage
of injuries due to nonoptimal temperatures), we used, for each day
of the series and province, the overall cumulative Relative Risk
corresponding to each daily temperature. Then, we calculated the
total attributable number of occupational injuries due to nonopti-
mal temperatures by summing the results for all days of the series
(Gasparrini et al. 2015b). The attributable fraction corresponds to
the ratio between the attributable and total number of occupational
injuries. We calculated heat and cold fractions by summing the se-
ries for days with temperatures above and below the PMOI, respec-
tively. We also computed moderate and extreme impacts, in which
extreme cold and heat were defined as temperatures below the
2.5th and above the 97.5th percentiles, respectively, in line with
previous studies (Gasparrini et al. 2015b). Empirical confidence
intervals were reported using Monte Carlo simulations (Gasparrini
et al. 2015b).

 We calculated the number of working days lost as a result of
nonoptimal temperatures by considering the empirical distribu-
tion of the number of days of sick leave for each category of
leave duration and the attributable number for both cold and
heat. Finally, we calculated the economic cost of working at
extreme temperatures. We first estimated the cost of each lost
workday due to injury using the results of our study. Then, we
multiplied this by the total number of workdays lost due to
nonoptimal temperatures (previously estimated in our study) to
obtain the total economic cost due to nonoptimal temperatures
per year. We reported the results separately for cold and heat,
expressed in Euro value for 2015 (according to changes in the
Spanish consumer price index).All analyses were performed
with R software (version 3.3.3).

Ethics Committee of the Parc de Salut MAR (November 2014).

Results
The study included all 15,992,310 occupational injuries reported
in Spain between 1994 and 2013. These injuries occurred at a
rate of 50 injuries per 1,000 workers per year, and an average
of 2,189 injuries per day. The two provinces with the largest
cities ― Madrid and Barcelona ― had a mean of more than
300 injuries per day, but accounted for only 28.6% of all injuries
included in the study (Supplemental Material, Table S1). Most
injuries (91%) were bone fractures or superficial injuries, and 47%
occurred in the construction and manufacturing sectors (Figures 1, 2
and Supplemental Material, Table S4). Our study area covers sev-
eral different climates. The daily average maximum temperature
during the study period was 20.9°C (SD 6.9) and ranged from 16.9°
C in Leon to 25.7°C in Seville (Supplemental Material, Table S1).
The coldest provinces in Spain registered minimum values below 0°
C (e.g., Albacete, Huesca, Teruel, Soria, and Lleida). This finding
reflects the importance of cold in some areas of Spain.
The relationship between ambient temperature and risk of
occupational injury is summarized by the pooled overall cumula-
tive curve shown in Figure 3a. The curve for Spain had a U-shape,
indicating that the risk of occupational injury increases in both cold
and hot temperatures. The increases were not restricted to extreme
temperatures but were observed across the entire range of tempera-
tures that deviate from the temperature percentile with minimum
injuries (27th percentile). The increase in injury risk was mainly
associated with temperatures on the same and preceding day (lag 0
and 1), and to a lesser extent with temperatures during the follow-
ing two and three days (Figure 3b and 3c). The corresponding
graphs for each province are shown in the Supplemental Material
Figure S1. Differences among provinces were observed. For
instance, although a large group of regions presented higher cold
effects than heat effects (e.g., Madrid, Toledo, Albacete), in only a
few regions were the effects of heat on injuries higher than the
effects of cold (e.g., Cadiz, Badajoz). Moreover, some provinces
did not have increased injuries with cold (e.g., Almeria, Granada,
Jaen, Valencia, Murcia).

 Table 1 shows the number and percentage of occupational inju-
ries attributable to cold and heat, and the attributable number of
lost workdays. Overall, more than half a million of the injuries that
occurred during the 20-y study period were attributable to nonopti-
mal temperatures (mean, 60 injuries/day). This number accounts
for 2.72% of all occupational injuries, most of which are attribut-
able to moderate heat and cold. Overall in Spain, 13.32 million
person-days of work were lost through sick leave related to temper-
ature, representing an annual loss of 42 workdays per 1,000 work-
ers (Table 1). This overall loss was much greater than the observed
number of sick-leave days due to internal injuries (681,298), multi-
ple injuries (489,119), or burns and frostbite (242,340).
The distribution of the attributable occupational injuries fraction
by Spanish provinces is represented in Figure 4. A different geograph-
ical pattern was observed. The provinces where cold had higher influ-
ence on occupational injuries were located in the northwest and
center of Spain (Figure 4a). In contrast, the highest heat-fraction was
observed among regions in the South and east of Spain (Figure 4b).
This pattern is similar to the spatial distribution of maximum tempera-
tures in summer and winter (Supplemental Material, Figure S3).
In terms of the economic burden, we estimated that this loss of
working days had an annual cost of more than e360 million in
Spain, representing 0.03% of GDP in 2015 (Table 2). The highest
costs were associated with pain and suffering (corresponding to the
level of disability), followed by costs associated with maintaining
production, long-term lost income, and health costs. Moderate heat
contributed the most to the economic losses.
We also assessed the risk associated with extreme tempera-
tures, specifically the first (extreme cold) and 99th (extreme heat)
percentiles of temperature, and found that, in comparison with the
temperature percentile of minimum injuries (27th), extreme cold
and heat increased the risk of occupational injuries by 4% [95%
confidence interval (CI): 2–6] and 9% (95% CI: 8–11), respectively
(Figure 5 and Supplemental Material Table S4).
When stratifying the analyses in two time periods, the increased
risk of injuries with cold and hot temperatures was still observed in
both periods (Supplemental Material, Figure S2 and Table S6).
Although the risk of injury during extreme cold was higher in the
second period, no differences for heat were observed.
Stratifying these risks by workers' characteristics, we found
that, whereas both men and women had elevated risks associated
with extreme cold and heat, in general women had higher risk of
injuries with cold and men with heat. In terms of age, we observed
that older workers had higher injury risk on cold days and younger
workers on hot days (Figure 5). We observed no remarkable differ-
ences in risk according to nationality and type of contract, although
the risk of injury increased in extreme temperatures in both cases.
The economic sectors with a substantial percentage of out-
door workers, namely agriculture, construction, and extractive
industries, showed the highest risk of injury associated with
extreme temperatures (Figure 6 and Supplemental Material,
Table S4). Agricultural workers showed the lowest risk of injury
during periods with the coldest temperatures. In addition, the
strongest significant associations during cold days were observed
for the transport and storage sector, hotel industry, and manufac-
turing sector. Our results found that nonmanual workers were at
higher risk of injury associated with extreme cold.
Apart from hotel industry, all the economic sectors analyzed were
male-dominated sectors, with a high percentage of male workers

 (Supplemental Material Table S5). In the sectors in which we had
enough numbers to stratify by sex, we observed that among workers
in agriculture, similar effects of heat were observed for both men and
women, whereas the protective effect under cold temperatures was
observed only in men. In addition, no differences according to sex
were seen among workers in hotel industry (Supplemental Material

The sector of work and age group were also correlated
(Supplemental Material Table S5). No age differences in the

 the agriculture sector. On the contrary, in construction, transport,
hotel industry, and manufacturing sectors, younger workers pre-
sented lower risk of injury with extreme cold, but they had higher
risk with extreme hot, in comparison with older workers.
Injuries classified as “effects of extreme temperature” and
“burns and frostbite” showed the strongest associations with
extreme heat (Figure 6 and Supplemental Material, Table S4).
Although this association is expected, given that these injuries
have a temperature component in their definition, these two
classes of injuries were not driving the overall results. Rather, the
risk of superficial injuries and bone fractures, which accounted
for 91% of all injuries, was significantly higher during both
extreme heat and cold. Other injury types that were also signifi-
cantly associated with cold include multiple injuries, internal
injuries and contusions, and burns and frostbite. Regarding dura-
tion of leave, short sick leave (<4 days) increased more strongly
in association with extreme cold than with extreme heat.
Results were consistent and sensitivity analyses suggested
that our results did not change depending on modeling assump-
tions (Supplemental Material, Table S3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study reports for the first time the associa-
tion between ambient temperature and occupational injuries at a
countrywide level and quantifies its economic costs. Our results
indicate that ambient temperature could have a significant effect
on occupational injuries. An increase of the risk of suffering an
injury was observed during both cold and hot weather. In our
study, more than one-half million occupational injuries could be
attributable to nonoptimal temperatures. This attributable number
of injuries corresponds to an estimated 13 million person-days of
work lost in Spain due to temperature, or an annual average of 42
d per 1,000 workers. The estimated annual economic burden is
e370 million or 0.03% of Spain’s GDP (e2,015).
Our study, including around 16 million occupational injuries, has
a much larger sample size than samples in previous studies. Most pre-
vious research that has analyzed the effects of heat have shown an
association with injuries in the workplace, although the results dif-
fered between studies (Bonafede et al. 2016). Although some prior
studies observed a linear relationship in the hot temperature range

 with some differences in intensity (Morabito et al. 2006; Adam-
Poupart et al. 2015), others identified thresholds in which the risk of
injury started to decrease after reaching extreme temperatures, possi-
bly due to activation of preventive plans (Xiang et al. 2014b). Similar
findings to those for heat have been found for cold, although the evi-
dence is more limited, and the results are inconclusive (Morabito et al.
2014; Fortune et al. 2014; Bell et al. 2000).
We found that temperature could be responsible of 2.72% of all
occupational injuries that occurred in Spain in the study period.
Comparing this finding with the percentage of injuries registered
due to other factors, we observed that the effects of exposure were
greater in number than burn and frostbite injuries (1.6%), multiple
injuries (1.47%), or injuries with psychological damage (0.12%)
(Supplemental Material, Table S4).
Most of the occupational injuries due to temperatures were at-
tributable to moderate heat and cold. This finding highlights the
importance that public health polices and plans should also cover
the ranges of moderate heat and cold, which are more common
than extreme temperatures and thus account for a higher number
of injuries, despite the smaller relative increase in risk in this
range. This pattern has also been reported by studies linking tem-
perature and mortality (Gasparrini et al. 2015b).
Geographical Differences
A difference in the temperature-related injury shape was observed
among regions in Spain. Whereas provinces in the south (the hotter
regions) showed no cold effects on occupational injuries, others
presented higher risk in working at extreme cold and extreme heat.
These differences might be due to a variation in climate but also to
other factors, such as differences in work activity (occupational
sectors) or in the occupational health prevention actions.
The Biological Mechanisms of Working at Extreme
Temperatures
The biological mechanisms linking the exposure to extreme ambient
temperatures and the risk of occupational injury remain unclear.
Most injuries included in this study were bone fractures and superfi-
cial injuries, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may be
related to decreased concentration or impaired judgment compro-
mising occupational safety (Kjellstrom et al. 2016). Although cog-
nition is already known to be affected by concurrent temperature
exposure (Schulte and Chun 2009), the lag pattern observed in this
study indicates that the effect of temperature on occupational inju-
ries is not limited to the day of exposure, consistent with the results
of other studies (Adam-Poupart et al. 2015). Although our data can-
not provide insights on the mechanisms underlying the delayed
impact of temperature, possible mechanisms include cumulative fa-
tigue and dehydration.
The Economic Burden of Temperature Related
Occupational Injuries
We estimated that extreme temperatures in Spain have an annual
cost of around e370 million . Although our economic analysis
relied on several assumptions, e.g., the cost calculation was based
on an economic analysis conducted only in the region of Catalonia
(Abiuso and Serra 2008), our study provides, for the first time, a
first-order approximation of the economic costs of injuries attribut-
able to temperature. To date, only one study has estimated the costs
associated with temperature, namely an Australian study of 306
injury-compensation claims explicitly classified as heat illnesses
(Xiang et al. 2015). Note that the sizeable costs associated with
injuries should be added to those attributed to climate variables by
other studies, mainly costs associated with reduced productivity
and to absenteeism and subsidies (Zander et al. 2015; Hübler et al.
2008; Kjellstrom et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016). Specifically, lost
productivity is estimated to account for 10% of GDP in some hot
regions of the world (Kjellstrom et al. 2016), and for 0.03% of
GDP in Germany (Hübler et al. 2008). In China, the cost of high-
temperature subsidies was estimated to account for 0.2% of GDP
(Zhao et al. 2016).
Differences in Workers’ Vulnerability
We found some differences in the estimated risk of occupational
injuries according to workers’ characteristics. Women appeared
to be more vulnerable to cold, and men appeared to be more vul-
nerable to heat. Most of the economic sectors analyzed were
dominated by males, but gender-related differences by sector did
not seem to explain apparent differences in susceptibility to tem-
perature between women and men, which could be due thermal
biological differences by sex (Karjalainen 2012). Results from
some studies reporting that women have lower sweat rates than
men in hot climates (Mehnert et al. 2002) could explain the dif-
ferences found in our study.
The age trend suggested that the workers most vulnerable to heat
were the youngest, possibly because these workers tend to do more
physically demanding work in hot weather (Bonafede et al. 2016).
However, we found a reverse pattern for cold temperatures, which
requires further research. Our results differ from those studies
assessing other health effects of ambient temperatures. Although the
majority of temperature-related mortality and morbidity evidence
pointed at the elderly (those older than 65 y) as the most vulnerable
(Basu 2009), our study highlighted the effects of temperatures on
the working population, which is younger and presumably healthier.
In the case of heat, the workers who were younger than 24 appeared
to be the most vulnerable group. Thus, our results suggest thatyoung
adults are also susceptible to the effects of extreme temperatures.
The sectors with a high percentage of outdoor workers, mainly
agriculture and construction, had the highest risk of injury. These
workers usually undertake intensive physical activity, even when
ambient temperatures are extreme (Xiang et al. 2014a). These sec-
tors have also been found by previous studies to have a high risk of
injury during hot periods (Xiang et al. 2015; Morabito et al. 2014;
Xiang et al. 2014b). Note that the ambient temperatures analyzed
in our study reflect the real conditions of outdoor workers but may
not correlate well with the temperatures experienced by indoor
workers. In addition, agriculture workers had a temperature percen-
tile with minimum injuries at the coldest temperatures, which may
be due to different job characteristics (typology, intensity, severity,
and heavy workload) during winter and summer. An explanation for
the differences observed in the economic sectors might be due to dif-
ferent workers’ socioeconomic status. Some studies have found
higher risk of heat-related mortality and morbidity among lower
socioeconomic status groups (Benmarhnia et al. 2015).
Unexpectedly, the highest risk of injury associated with extreme
cold was observed among nonmanual workers. As one potential ex-
planation, a previous study found that foremen and office workers in
the construction industry may be outdoors at work sites and also
exposed to extreme temperatures, sometimes with less protective
clothing than that of manual workers (Burström et al. 2013).
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, our results are based on
an official register of formal workers and, therefore, informal
workers were not included. This omission likely underestimates
the effects of extreme temperatures on occupational injuries, as
informal workers may have less-regulated and more-adverse work
conditions, tend to be employed in low-skilled jobs and to have long
work shifts, and are therefore expected to be more at risk (Culp et al.
Environmental Health Perspectives
067002-8
126(6) June 2018
 2011). Second, maximum temperature was used as exposure vari-
able, and we did not consider other parameters, such as humidity.
Although several indexes can provide better measures of thermal
sensation, some studies have found little differences when using dif-
ferent temperature indexes in the context of temperature-related
mortality (Barnett et al. 2010). Importantly, we relied on ambient
temperatures, which adequately reflect exposure for outdoors work-
ers but likely do not do so for indoor workers. Third, temperature
data wereavailable froma single monitoring station in eachprovince
(locatedinthe province’s capital). However, daily variations in max-
imum temperature within a province were quite homogeneous. In a
subanalysis with four of the provinces having data from 14 to 21
monitoring stations each, the within-province correlation between
stations ranged from 0.87 to 1 (Supplemental Material, Table S2).
Fourth, several changes have occurred during the study period for
which we did not control, such as sociodemographic changes, the
Spanish economic crisis, or changes in workplace regulations.
However, after stratifying the study period in two, according to the
implementation of an important public occupational health policy,
our results were robust. Fifth, the use of a two-step approach to first
fit the curves and then find the minimum could have led to some bias
in the calculation of attributable fractions. However, a recent paper
used simulations to test the method we used (called argmin2 in the
reference)andfound that therewas virtuallynobias in theestimation
of the minimum in multicity studies with enough statistical power
and a clear U-shape relationship, as in our study (Lee et al. 2017).
Thus, we expect low bias in finding the minimum temperature and
consequently low bias in attributable fractions.
Implications
Our results suggest that a high number of occupational injuries
may be attributed to nonoptimal temperatures, and that these inju-
ries result in an important economic cost. Preventive measures to
alleviate this burden could be put in place. On the one hand,
temperature-health prevention plans and actions should cover not
only extreme temperatures but also moderate heat and cold. On
the other hand, specific preventive measures for workers should
be incorporated in those plans, e.g., measures to restrict working
during the coldest/hottest hours, taking rest breaks, ensuring
proper hydration, and wearing appropriate clothes. The identifi-
cation of vulnerable groups of workers may help to focus those
policies to reduce the effects of ambient temperatures on occupa-
tional health.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study highlights the negative effect of exposure
to moderate and extreme ambient temperatures on occupational
health due to increased risk of occupational injuries. Our results
also underscore the potential economic costs of this exposure. We
also identified groups of workers who appeared to be more vulnera-
ble to workplace injury during periods of extreme temperatures.
Considering the predicted increase in global temperatures due to
climate change, this study provides useful information for design-
ing targeted interventions and implementing adaptation plans
focused on the most vulnerable jobs and workers.
